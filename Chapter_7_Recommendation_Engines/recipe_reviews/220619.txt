I'm working on my second batch of this bagel formula.  I use malt syrup as I think it improves the crust a bit.  So far, I've stayed with the Very Hot (475-F) oven and bake to color, a bit less time than called for.  I'm tickeled with the interior textrure and flavor.  If there is one BIG variation, I mix the dough in the evening, oil it very lightly and let it ferment in the fridge for 12-18 hours, allowing about two hours at room temperature to warm before dividing and forming the bagels.  If there is a better formula for bagels at home, I've yet to find it.

I followed the recipe, but not the instructions. I added the 1 1/4 cup of hot water, sugar and yeast together in my KitchenAid mixer. I let the yeast get frothy and then added in the salt, oil and 4 cups of flour (anymore and it would have been too dry!). On speed 2, I let it mix then knead the dough for 15 minutes. I was running late, and couldn't get the dough to the consistency as instructed. It broke almost right away when pulled. I popped the dough a warm oven (I put it on 350F just until the elements were red, then turned it off).
After rising for 2 hours, I punched down the dough and started shaping. I made 8 bagels. I didn't have a full cup of honey, so I added some light corn syrup to make up for what I was lacking, a quarter cup. I also didn't use 16 cups of water, I used 13. I let the bagels bathe and then topped them with grated medium cheddar cheese. They baked for 20 minutes at 475F. I pulled them out, let them cool for 15 minutes then tried them. OMG! Delicious! They will be even better with cream cheese smothered over them after toasting them in the toaster! I can't wait for breakfast tomorrow! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I found the dough tremendously dry. It taxed the motor on my KitchenAid. In the end, I added at least another 1/4C water and kneaded by hand.  To make only 6 bagels would have resulted in rings the size of bread loaves.  I made 18.  12 would have been on par with the generously over-sized bagels in grocery stores.  

The flavour is bland.  One reviewer said he leaves the dough to ferment overnight with a long, slow rise.  I think that would be wise. Otherwise the taste is flat.  These need some sort of topping or schmear, rather than eating them on their own.

Perfect with 4 cups of Canadian flour.  Made 6 giant bagels.  When boiling, mine floated immediately, so boiled a minute on each side.  Kneeded for about 12 minutes, giving a workout to our 800 watt Cuisinart and dough hook.  Will be making this a lot.  Have eaten 2 already, so I'll tell the kids I made 4.

It's quite tasty. I did change the bread to water to ratio to what i know would work from making tons of bread. 1 and 1/2 water and 4 cups of high gluten flour. I also mixed the dough in my bread machine, it's just easier that way. The recipe is exact to my pizza dough 1 and 1/2 water, 2 tbsp oil, 4c bread or high gluten flour, 1tsp salt(sprinkle about that much) and 3 tbsp sugar(a handful), and 1 pkt rapid rise yeast. I decided to go with Onion bagels, so I added onion powder to the dough (about a few tbsp, just sprinked, so dont know the exact amount) . Once the dough was finished I took the advice of adding honey to the water(not sure if it made any difference, just used up a bunch of my honey). It is just like making pretzels or pretzel dogs I dropped them in the water and flipped after about 30 or so seconds then placed them onto a parchment lined baking sheet. I brushed the top of each with egg white then sprinkled with onion flakes. I then baked in a 400 oven for about 20 minutes checking after 15 then every few minutes until they looked done. I turned the oven off, opened the door and covered with foil. I have learned from making, pizza and pretzles that this helps the chew in the crust. Now I just have to keep from eating them all before the rest of the family comes home.

The flavor of these is really good, but I had to rate it down because if I wasn't a seasoned bread-maker, I wouldn't have known to not follow the flour amounts recommended here.

Add your flour a cup at a time if you use this recipe, and STOP adding when the dough is silky and slightly tacky.

I'm on the same page as Mama_B. I also had to add 1/4 cup of water and kneaded by hand. They were my first attempt at bagels so I was happy that they turned out, but they really were huge. I'm going to try again and make 8 instead so they're a more normal size. I was happy with how they tasted right out of the oven, but having one for breakfast the next day, they were a bit bland. I did not boil them with honey, so I will also try that next time to add an extra layer of flavor. Oh, and a bit of advice for anyone having trouble rolling out and connecting their bagels into a ring - I saw in another recipe that they form the bagels into balls and just stick their thumb in the middle to make a hole, then stretch the hole to 1/3 the width of the bagel and form it into a bagel shape that way. I did that and it was very easy. PLAWHON - Thank you very much for contributing this recipe! I was very pleased with how easy to follow it was for a novice baker.

I just made this recipe.  I split the dough into thirds, and made three different types of bagels.  1/3 was plain, 1/3 had cinnamon sugar mixed in, and 1/3 had caramelized onions mixed in.  I am never going to buy bagels again, this was so easy!

I've tried lots of bagel recipes over the years, but never one I liked as much as this one. I ususally use at least part whole wheat flour and sometimes other toppings. All have been good!

I went with this recipe and was very pleased!  I read the reviews and prepared dough the night before - super easy once I calculated instant yeast vs. packaged (it was Arctic Freeze Weekend and I was not going out!).  2 pkgs yeast...  Next morning took bowl from garage and let rise about 2 hrs. then Prepared three types of bagels, Asiago cheese, cinnamon sugar, toasted onion flakes.  Everyone loved them and they were even tastier the next day.  In the future I will definately make double batch - since I had a large pot of boiling water, would like make the most use of it.  Just watch them after 10 min...they brown faster than you think.  Thanks to everyone for your comments for a successful Deli breakfast (and warm kitchen)!!

This is a great recipe! Had to add about 3/4 c more water.   I made 12 nice sizes bagels instead of the 6, they would ha e been enormous. The only thing I changed is how to form them, made a round, then finger through center. These taste like Brueggers bagels.

Like many others found, as-written this recipe produces a hard, dry, rubbery dough that causes a very powerful KitchenAid mixer to emit smoke.  The crumbly dough falls apart into lots of small pieces.  I ended up adding quite a bit of water and throwing the dough into the bread machine to try and salvage it.  It was just too hard and dry to knead by hand.  I'll have to change it a lot next time to make a workable dough.

Because the dough was so dry, almost all of the bagels came apart in the boiling water.  I made 8 instead of the 6 the recipe states to make, and even those were GIGANTIC.

If you use the proportions listed here you will never get the "transparent" quality this recipe describes.  I wonder if there is a typo somewhere?  

Having added more water I found that the bagels did end up with a really nice, chewy texture and they were great (though they had fallen apart some due to the difficulty with the dough).  Next time I'll decrease flour, as well.  Most of the 4- and 5-star reviews, I see, are from people who made changes to the amounts of flour and water.  If you follow the recipe exactly, though, you will be disappointed.

These were really outstanding, and I thought that it was a relatively easy bread recipe (breads can be tricky, especially for novices). The only modification that I made was allowing the dough to rise/ferment in the fridge overnight--which is what professionals do with bagels. Well, actually, I guess I made another minor change in the process. Rather than mixing the yeast in with everything else, I mixed the yeast, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 3/4 cup of lukewarm water in a separate bowl to let the yeast proof before mixing with everything else (make sure to make necessary adjustments in the sugar and water before adding them to the flour). After about ten minutes, the yeast should be foamy (indicating the yeast are alive). 

I'm surprised that no one seems to have mentioned this, but don't go by the reviews that are saying only use 4 cups of flour. The climate can make a huge difference here--specifically humidity level. I would advise starting with 3.5-4 cups, and then add more flour if necessary. But, because the climate is different from one kitchen to the next, a blanket statement that 4 cups is enough may not be true for everyone. 

One final tip--for those who have had a problem with the bagels sticking to the parchment, you can prevent this by lightly greasing the parchment. Obviously, this isn't usually necessary when using parchment, but the wet bagels can become a little glue-like. I just spray it with a light coat of non-stick cooking spray. I haven't tried it with thi

This is a pretty good bagel recipe! I added onion flakes and poppy seeds into the dough instead of on top. Make sure to use the parchment paper otherwise the bottoms get overcooked and to brown.

Wow!  This recipe is holy delicious!!!  I doubled the recipe and was able to make a dozen smaller bagels and 6 regular sized bagels.  I was very pleased with this recipe.  It is exactly what I was looking for and makes an authentic tasting bagel w/the perfect texture.  I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't disappointed.  You won't be either!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It will be made time and time again :D

I just can't get the boiling part down.  They come out a little gummy.  Maybe, I will try again.  I just used an egg wash and skipped the boiling part for now.  They didn't come out like a bagel, more like a mix between bagel and english muffin.  Still good, but that step is crucial for bagels.

So far so good! They're cooked and cooling. I chomped at the bit waiting for 1 1/2 hours before punching down, shaping boiling and baking. I only put maybe a Tbs. of sugar and a Tsp. of honey in the water. I used an egg wash. Baked at 450. They look great. 

USEFUL TIP!!! I found when making pretzels or bagels, to put them into a sieve to drip and let some water evaporate off of them after boiling before putting them on the parchment paper! Otherwise I did have some pretzels turn out "gummy". 

Hope that helps! 

As for flavour. It is what you make it! Its a basic bread recipe, add your own flavours and spices! Allowing it to sit overnight may make a nice difference. I never really care. :) 

Happy Baking!!!

The reason I only gave four star is because this is the first time I made bagel. This is my first bagel recipe, it came out great but as an adventurous cook I will look for other recipe for comparison to see which one is the best that I would use over and over. I don't have any complain for this recipe at all, the taste was great, it came out great, I didn't substitute or change any part of it. Eventhough I am not a big fan of instant yeast but I used it anyway and everything turned out great:)

Best bagel recipe I've ever tried.  The dough was very easy to work with!  As I looked over the ingredient list I noticed it is nearly the same as the recipe I use for French bread.  The instructions made it very easy to know exactly what to expect in every step.  I had my 4-year old granddaughter help me roll out the "snakes" (her term, not mine).  What a great way to get a child interested in doing things in the kitchen--and spending time with Gramma!  I did make a substitution by adding 1 Tbsp. of molasses in place of one of sugar, and because I used whole wheat flour it only took about 2 1/4 cups of flour to reach the consistency suggested.

I've made this recipe 3x now. Definitely use 4 cups of bread flour instead of 4.5. I used 4.5 the first time and had to add water. These are amazing! Better each time. I found if you have the water at a good rolling boil the bagels get even bigger. I've made the recipe into 6, 8, and 10 bagels. It just depends what size you like. I've also done cinnamon and sugar (brown and white sugar, both good) on top as well as cheddar cheese. The cheese does better when its a bigger shred. Making bagels is my new favorite thing :)

Excellent bagels.  I boiled the bagelsin the honey, but didn't need to bake them as long.  In my oven 14-15 minutes would have been enough.  I didn't have parchment paper so I just "sprayed" the pan.  The bagels were dark on the bottom, but so delicious.  This is my new favorite recipe.  Thank you

Followed the recipe but only used 4 cups of flour and 1/4 cup of honey and baked for 17 minutes. They turned out great!! Soft inside  and crunchy on the outside. I ate one hot from the oven and was blown away!! I'll add that I made these with all organic ingredients and they were perfect!

The taste was OK, but every single bagel stuck to the parchment paper. Had to peel the bottom layer off just to get them free. :-(

To dry.  Also, when to dry 4.5c flour in tilt-head KitchenAid bowl will want to "crawl" out the top and also overheat mixer.  Try 1.5 c water 4c flour and adjust from there. Warm the water and mix water, yeast, sugar and 2c flour first then add the remaining flour,oil, salt a few minutes later, then go for the long mix.. 10-12 min on low. I boil in .25c pure cane syrup in 2qt water for 1:30 per side. I get 8 nice size bagels or 6 giants. Watch youtube videos for other methods to shape the dough. roll snake and pinch ends does work.. I wet the ends for better result.

ok, I'm not by any means a novice cook and esp not a unexp'd baker but this IS the first time I attempted bagels, so I followed the instructions to the letter, I had one issue, which is well, quite a big one.  My bagels came out looking amazing and smelling amazing but when I tried to take them off the parchment, they were stuck.  I tried placing a bit of water under the paper on the hot pan to "steam" them off and it worked a bit but there are still 3 bagels that no matter what I do, I cannot get the paper off the bottom.  It's like it's baked right on.  Quite disappointing really because who wants to eat a bagel with parchment paper all over the bottom? :(

I've made these four times now and will be sure to make them countless more. I only add 3.5 cups flour, then add more if needed. The last time I made these I forgot the oil. I liked them so much I plan on forgetting the oil from now on.
Last note, to form the bagels I make a ball of dough, poke a hole in the middle, and then spin each bagel on my finger until the center hole is large enough. I had too many come apart using the rope method.

Super recipe easy, I added diced jalapeños to mine and they turned out fantastic!  I may never buy another bagel with this recipe.  I didn't have any honey for the water but I did have agave so I gave it a try and it worked just fine. thank you for a great recipe!

Great recipe and technique. Made bread yesterday with similar ingrediants so I had dough in fridge. Let it come to room temp and rise in glass bowl, greased and coverd. Followed instructions on how to shape, boil and rest. I used an egg wash on top and sessame seeds. Baked on a cookie sheet with corn meal at 450 for about 20 minutes. Awesome goodness. No  sticking to the pan.  Will be making these again soon.

I have tried a number of bagel recipes and this is by far the best one I've found.  When the recipe is set on the original serving size of 6 bagels, I have been able to make 8 with the same amount of dough.  If you let them rise for another 20-30 minutes after forming the bagels and before boiling them, they will be slightly bigger.  After boiling them, I use an egg wash (one whisked egg with a little bit of water), then add the toppings and bake.  The toppings stay on better with the egg wash.  What a great recipe!

Very tasty.  My dough didn't "stretch" even after letting it kneed in my KitchenAid for the recommended time but it still turned out great.  Also, I used less honey in the water but that was fine.

This was my first attempt at homemade bagels and I think they turned out awesome.  I didn't have the instant yeast like the recipe called for so I dissolved one packet of dry yeast in warm water and hoped for the best.  I did have to add about 1/2 cup more of water to the dough as it was mixing.

This is the first time I have tried anything with dough from scratch.  I was pleased that they didn't seem too complicated, but - as my wife warned - dough can always be tricky.

I had to add a little water to the first batch while it was in the mixer, and in the 2nd batch I put just 4 cups of flour in.  It was still just a smidge doughy so I added a splash of water.  The formula that worked for me was 4 cups white flour and 11 ounces water (all other ingredients in the mixer were the same).

Even with slightly less flour, though, 6 bagels was too few.  The couple of bagels I tried to make at this size were monstrous.  I ended up making 8 decent-sized bagels from each batch (still larger than most store-bought bagels).

The sausage-shape of the dough was actually more like 8-10 inches long.  I found it best to roll each one gently, lay it on the cutting board and cut off a quarter inch (or less) of the end of each roll, exposing unfloured (stickier) dough that would more easily adhere when trying to make the bagel into an actual circle.  I wrapped the dough around my pinky when bringing it together.

I did not use honey. The magic time was 13 minutes @ 475º.

I had about an hour between mixing the dough of the first two batches and the last three batches.  This worked out well.  It gave me about 20 minutes down time between all the back and forth, and the last bagels were on the cooling rack about 5 hours after the first batch went into the mixer.  Fun to make and delicious!

I tried making this three different times in one day, and they all failed miserably.  The first time, I checked the recipe and tried using my bread machine to combine everything.  The dough came out solid and crumbling, and it tore just trying to put it in the bowl to rise.  The second time, I used my mixer and tried adding the flour gradually.  By the second cup it was straining the motor on my mixer and I turned it out to knead by hand.  I never got past two and a half cups of flour - once again it became many crumbling pieces and would not bond together or become elastic.  The third time, I followed the directions exactly and put everything in the mixer at once.  This time was the worst - after the dough became so stiff that the dough hook snapped in half, I figured it was time to surrender.  Would not use this recipe again if someone paid me to.  I use recipes to show me the right way to start, not as a starting point for figuring out a recipe.  This was a terrible waste of time, ingredients, and money.

As other reviewers have said - DO NOT just toss everything in a bowl mixer, and start it. The first time, I made this mistake, and the dough never achieved that "translucent" window effect, but they actually still came out pretty good! The second time, took my time adding the flour & water, and got to the perfect consistency w/ only ~3 cups of flour and around a cup of water. As one other reviewer put it, "Slightly tacky" is the texture you're after. These are a family and friends favorite, and are a great introduction to bagel making!

Yes I will make it again! But I did modify a bit the 1st time around......... I made bagel dogs! And they were amazing! Try it....after you separate the dough roll the balls into a bit longer than your hot dogs, place the room temp hot dog on the edge of each flattened dough, roll the hot dog into the dough & tuck the outside edges in toward the inside covering up the ends, wet the finished edge & seal. Let rise about 15~30 minutes. Then move onto step 4.

These turned out amazing!! If you want a noticeable hole in the center it might be best to make it a bit bigger than you'd think because the dough rises while resting, boiling, and baking!

It went well, the dough definitely is a bit tough for most hand mixers, I suggest going in with hands! Overall, it went well. And I got some pretty good bagels. I achieved the hard outside and soft inside. Some of the bagels came apart during boiling, but I think that was my fault.

I made these as part of our Christmas morning breakfast.  They came out great even though I had my doubts.  The dough was very tough and I needed to add 1/4 cup water and finished kneading by hand as another reviewer recommended.  I also followed the recommendation to leave dough overnight in the refrigerator and punch down and finish in the morning.  We made them into everything bagels by dipping in mixture of kosher salt, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, minced garlic,  minced onions and caraway seeds.  Next time I'd skip the caraway seeds as they have a strong overpowering taste.  The consistency of the bagel could not have been more perfect!  Next time we'll adapt it to make cinnamon raisin bagels.

Love this recipe.  I have always wanted to make my own bagels so I could control the size and limit the calories.  Plus, it sounded like fun.  This is so delicious and easy.  I had no trouble following the directions.  Just followed the recipe and divided my dough by weight so the bagels would be similar sizes.  I made 8 bagels instead of 6 and was happy with the size.  I see no need to buy bagels ever again.  These were slightly lighter than ones I've bought before (which I liked) and they didn't last long in my house.

I followed this recipe (the ingredients) but added all of the ingredients to my bread making machine. It's important to watch the dough because the amount of water depends on the type of flour used. I also boiled the bagels in plain water for about 10 seconds each side.  Best tasting bagels EVER!  GREAT recipe.  I keep making it for my family.

The dough is pretty hard to mix and my kitchen aid stand mixer was struggling, but they ended up GREAT! I used the honey in my water and only sprinkled salt on top. I will be making them again.

I found that recipe asks for too much oil and not enough water in order to happily develop gluten. As a result it was crumbly and oily-dry.

Great recipe. Fyi watch your parchment paper.  Most don't withstand 475 degree temperature. I also only used 4c. Bread flour and seasoned with chives, garlic, dill and different cheeses.  Yummy!!

Best bagel recipe I've tried, and I've tried a few! Followed closely, using 2 packets of yeast. The dough was really stiff, so I added a little more water. My kitchen aid was working hard! I made 8 large bagels, dipped the top in sesame seeds, and they are delicious!! Eating one as I'm typing this the next morning, and I think they're even better today :)

iI made this recipe exactly as is except that I only put 4 cups of regular Canadian flour. As a reviewer had suggested. They turn out great. My nicest looking bagels are the ones that I rolled into balls and then put a hole in the Center and sketched it out. I also put maple and corn syrup in the boiling water. I made them a bit smaller which gave me 13 bagels that are still a good size and perfect for our toaster. I used my kitchen aid stand mixer. Hope these suggestions make your bagels perfect

I made these plain because my intentions were to make bagel sandwiches out of them with egg sausage and cheese.  While I was making them I thought they were going to be pretty ugly but, they turned out looking like a professional had done them.  The recipe was easy to follow.  The only thing I did differently was added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the mixture to act as a preservative. I have found that it makes the bread stay fresher longer without molding.  I made 8 out of the recipe instead of 6 and they were still huge!

Absolutely delicious and particularly easy to make. However- I used parchment paper as the recipe said and it's stuck to the bottom of my bagels now! Next time I will just use tin foil or no paper at all. Otherwise this recipe is great!

Really good!   I made mine the night before and then took it out of the fridge a couple hours before making them.  Kids love them, one daughter rolled chocolate chips in, very popular!
I will say that the dough seemed very tight, I added a tbsp of water and split the dough in half so that the dough hook could do it's work. Each half portion was kneaded for at least 14 minutes.    I read some reviews where people decided to hand knead.... no thank you!  I used the honey in the boiling water, it certainly adds a yummy fragrance!

Today I made this recipe at the very first time. It was really easy and turned out really tasty!! I did take other reviewers' suggestion resolve the yeast and sugar in warm water then add other remaining ingredients, and I also only use 4 cups of flours. I have a really small oven so I can only place 4 bagels at once ( I decided in 8 portion at the first  ). The first batch came out way too big, so I divided the rest 4 into 8 pieces, but it was a bit small. So I think next time I will divide the dough to 12 portions. And I will definitely make this recipe again!!

The bagels taste great but would have been in the oven too long, they started smoking at about 10 minutes because of the parchment paper,  I bought cheap parchment paper, not a mistake I'll make again!  But after I cut the bagels off the paper, they were good!

Best bagels I've tried.....hubby and kids loved them , I used all-purpose flour and I also added half cup water extra  because the dough was way to dry.so that makes for 1 3/4 cups water and the yeast I added 1 and half tbsp.  baked them for 15 mins and broiled them for 5 mins.

I bake all of our bread and I've tried many different kinds. I've never made bagels before, but felt confident that I could be successful. The dough is flavorless, needs to be a little sweeter I think?? I suppose I could add herbs and such to the dough to enhance it? Also, as in other reviews I felt the dough was SUPER dry and impossible to knead with the recommended amount of flour to liquid. I used over 1/4 cup more water, as well as more oil. They plumped up well, felt sturdy, were the right texture I want and cooked quick. My oven smoked a TON while baking though. I put sesame seeds on the bottoms of all of them, topped some with parmesan and garlic and some with cheddar, and some I loaded with everything I had. I say 2 stars as this will make a great starter recipe to base off of, but definitely needs tweaking.

Very good! My family loves them! I put sauted onions in the dough and used about 3 cups whole wheat flour instead of white, with a little vital wheat gluten. Very fluffy, awesome with cream cheese and sliced tomatoes!!
Will be making these again!

Great bagels. Flavor and texture is perfect to my liking. I only boil for 2 minutes, 1 minute a side. Make sure to boil right before you put in the oven, don't let them sit. They'll look funny!

A wonderful, easily adaptable recipe. I took the advice of a previous review and left my dough in the refrigerator overnight. I also substituted 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat flour, and had no problems with density. A definite keeper!

I used parchment paper on top my pampered chef stoneware cooking sheet.  The paper stuck to the bottom of the bagels.  I think next time I'll try no honey in the water and no parchment paper. (I also found the dough very tough, and made my KitchenAid stress out... I hand kneeded the dough for the 8 min).

Recipe is so simple and Easy to make. I only had regular flour and yeast . I increased the yeast by 25% as recommended on line. I used my cuisinart mixer on number 2 speed and dough was perfect. However it was getting late for the rising part so I put it in the frig overnight and got a nice slow rise! Dough handled well after I let it warm up for about an hour. I used the honey in the boiling water as directed and dipped in sesame seeds prior to baking. My only issue was how to keep the dough together on each bagel? I used a tiny bit of water and that helped but a could came apart in the boil. Any suggestions?

Added Asiago cheese to the top while baking - 15 min was perfect. The dough was a bit dry, so I'd say 1 1/4 cup (plus an oz. or two)  to really round out the amount of liquid needed. I added what the recipe called for initially, then gradually added small bits until the dough was just right. Loved the final bake's texture!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written before reading reviews. The dough was way too dry. Unbelievably I was able to add about and 8th cup more water to the dough to get it to a manageable state. It rose beautifully. 
Also I think the bagels would have been much too big following the recipe for cutting them out. In the end I cut 16 pieces for 16 bagels.
If you go this small you will need to lower temp to around 400 and cook less.  I actually don't really know how long I cooked mine for so I will have to play with it the next time I make them. For 16 bagels the heat is too hot and they will end up burning the ingredients on the top.  For the ingredients on the top I made some garlic and onion, pizza seasoning with tomatoes and cheese, and parmesan cheese with tomato. 
Had the recipe needed no changes I would have given it 5 stars. But I feel since I had to figure out how to make some changes in order to get the dough manageable I gave it 3.

Best bagels in the world. So chewy and better than store bought. Only changes was only 1 cup of water (instead of 1 and 1/4th) and only 4 cups of flour (instead of 4 and a half). I've made this so many times!

I made the recipe as stated. There is not much I would change except to add in onion and poppy seed for an onion bagel. I also use baked baking soda in the water for savory bagels and the honey for sweet bagels. 

The taste was great. I didn't get the right texture I wanted the first time, but that I put that on me. This was the first bagel batch I have ever made.

They turned out great.  I kept thinking the dough was too stiff and only used 4 1/4 cups of flour.  I also reduced the temperature to 425 and baked for 25 minutes because 475 just sounded too hot.  I’ll make these again soon!

Ultimately good, but getting there was not easy. Another reviewer said "it taxed her kitchen aid mixer". I can now vouch for that. Dough turned out too dry made as directed. Next time I will use 1 to 1 and a half cups less flour. This should still be plenty to make 6 bagels. The taste was a little doughy, but decreasing the flour should eliminate that issue. I will try these again, with this change.

The absolute best bagels!!! I use my breadmaker for the dough and use less salt (low sodium diet here).  They turn out exactly like the photo.  I will be experimenting with substituting wheat flour next.

I’ve been baking since I was 5 as being past Amish and was really surprised that the author did not mention the dryness of the dough and that more water maybe needed, besides that the honey was different and all came out well.  One of the better bagel recipes I might add. Shared with so many here in the south and they are begging for more. ????

Really good instructions , but needed more flour. The sough this made looked more like a  batter. Could be the climate here though. I added flour until the dough was stiffer than bread dough and didn't stick to the sides. That seemed to do the trick.

Really good recipe. Made with my kids and they loved them! The cook temperature was a little too high for me, it nearly burned the outside while the inside was just done so I will lower it a bit in the future. Otherwise, great recipe

I followed this recipe to a "T" and the bagel dough was not good. It was too tough, did not roll out well, and made some pretty ugly bagels. They were edible but just not good. After seeing how bad this dough was, I used another recipe that made much better bagels. Rating two stars because the taste was fine, but just overall not a good recipe.

I liked these bagels a lot, but I ended up wasting a lot of flour and a yeast packet on the first batch because the recipe did not specify that the water had to be warm. It may be obvious to many people that you should use warm water, but I was very confused when a half an hour went by, and the dough still wasn't the right consistency. I would go back and change the recipe stating the correct temperature so others don't make the same mistake. :(

My first attempt at making bagels, though I do make bread often. More or less followed the recipe. Used slightly less than a tablespoon yeast - a packet is 2 1/4 tsp, I think. Let it sit for the full, and unusual 2 hours. Didn't add the optional honey to the boiling water but did add maybe a tsp of sugar more to the dough. used poppy seeds, sesame seeds  mixed together as a topping.

Didn't turn out as dense and smooth as a bagel. Came out light and absolutely delicious!! Made excellent sandwich buns. I called them my "bagelish" buns.

So as a bagel recipe, maybe because of something I did or didn't do, not great. As a delicious bread bun recipe, i'll be making these again often.

If I were to make them again I would use less topping and definitely turn the oven down. 475 gave the seeds a burnt taste and I removed them from oven at about 14 minutes

This was my first time making bagels. As suggested by other bakers, 4.5 cups of flour was too much. I had to add more water and oil. Because of the excess flour it overworked my Kitchenaid and actually caused it to smoke. It took twice as long to get my dough to even stretch at all. When I put my bagels in the boiling water, they immediately floated. So it was hard to tell if they were ready to go on the sheet pan or not. 475 was too hot, I’m going to go with 450 next time. They did turn out ok. Bottoms were a little brown but for my first time I’m ok with it. Read reviews before trying this recipe I think it needs some adjustments!

The texture was absolutely spot on, and I didn’t even get the dough to stretch the way the recipe describes! I DID NOTISE A DOUGH HOOK, because I don’t have counter space for a stand mixer. Kneading by hand took about 35 minutes, and definitely took some serious elbow grease. Also let the dough rise for 6 hours instead of 2 just because my date night with the lady went on longer than I thought. Best tip is if you’re using kosher salt, DOUBLE the amount — my bagels had very little flavor, which makes me think the recipe was designed using table salt (significantly more potent than kosher salt). Also, I would use an egg wash before applying toppings and baking — mine lacked that certain sheen and eggshell thin crust all the best bagels lack. I also undercooked mine slightly at 12mins and thought the texture was perfect, especially if you plan on toasting them. Good luck!!!

Just finished a batch and these are so delicious! I agree with another commenter that says  to add the flour a little at a time until the dough is smooth but still tacky. I replaced the yeast with sourdough starter (and then reduced the amount of flour and water I added) and that worked out really well! I also sprinkled mine with cinnamon sugar, yum!

I followed the recipe exactly and as written this is a total failure. The amount of water is way off. Secondly, any bread maker knows the water should be warm to activate the yeast. I often make bagels but couldn’t find my tried and true recipe so I tried this one. I am annoyed that people give it a high rating and then I read the ratings and discover that they changed it to make it a 5 star. AS WRITTEN, this is a failure.

As I am new at baking bagels, I followed this recipe exactly.  In order to get the dough to stretch as described by the "windowpane" stage, I had to let the mixer run for 8 minutes more than the instructions stated... still kept it on low.  Otherwise, the texture is beautiful... light, pillowy, and a little chewy.  I would say that the other reviews criticized the taste.  Yes, the taste was very light.  Perhaps I'll look into ways of adding flavor to the dough.  Otherwise, a complete success, and I'm a happy beginner!

Almost perfect!
I didn’t get that shiny top from the pic. I added 2cups of whole wheat flour, instead of the whole amount of bread flour. I did add some honey to the water. Tasted delicious!1/2 hours.

Been making bagels for 10 months with slightly different ingredient amounts and kneading instructions. Was looking to streamline the process. Dough was too dry, nearly burned up the motor on my Kitchenaid pro so I tried kneading by hand and after 11 MORE minutes, tossed in the garbage. I even proofed my yeast before adding! Dont waste your time!

They turned out super yummy but not bagels at all. They were light and fluffy with a nice crust. Also, I made 8 instead of 6 and they were still fairly large sized.

I love this recipe. I’ve used this recipe a handful of times now. My KitchenAid isn’t strong enough to mix the dough and knead it fully, so I let it mix the ingredients for a couple minutes and then knead by hand for a few minutes. I add another2 tablespoons or so of water to soften the dough a little. I spray my KitchenAid bowl with oil and put the dough back in, covered, to let it rise the full two hours. When i go to shape the bagels, i just divide the dough into about 10 pieces (6 pieces makes the bagels too large for us) and form a ball with each piece instead of rolling and connecting the dough into a bagel shape. I push my finger through the dough to make it bagel-shaped and they come out much prettier in my opinion. I don’t add the honey to my water when I boil them because without it has worked out well for me. I top with cheddar cheese, salt or everything bagel seasoning and bake for the same amount of time stated in the recipe. They come out beautiful every time.

Super easy and yummy. I did end up hand kneading because my mixer didn't like it. This made 6 BIG bagels, so next time I will have to make it into at least 8 smaller ones to be able to fit in my toaster.

I just finished my third batch, very good!! I disagree with others about the ratio of flour/water. I used 1 1/2 cups wheat flour so because it absorbs more water I added another 3 tbsp water, but otherwise it is good! I increased the salt to 2 tsp. Pro tip: do NOT flour your surface when shaping the bagels, you need a little resistance to stretch it.

I used this recipe two weeks ago for the first time.  I too found 1 1/4 cups water too dry.  I was pleased with the resulting bagels.   I made another batch of dough Thursday and let it ferment for 18 hours to try that variation.  As honey is a little pricey I decided to make another batch of dough the next day so could boil them all, bake then freeze and used when needed.  The fermented dough did not bake well.  The outside was brown but still not cooked thoroughly.  The batch I'd made 2 weeks ago and the fresh dough both cooked thoroughly.  I ended up putting the pictured ones back in the oven and turned a few times to get cooked through.

This recipe worked out perfectly.  The bagels were crunchy on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside (I added the honey to the boiled water, as suggested).   My family enjoyed them very much!

This bagel is loved by my whole family! Even my extremely picky 9 year old absolutely loves this bagel. We did have to add about an extra cup of water to the recipe, but it was outstanding. Definitely a recipe that will be kept handy, and made frequently.

I added 2T of minced garlic to the dough and sprinkled sea salt on top just before baking.  Got great reviews from my husband and son.  They said it was as if a garlic bagel and a giant pretzel had a baby!

It would have been 5 stars but the first time I made the dough, it didn’t rise and was way too dry. I remade the dough by adding 1 1/2 cups of warm water to the yeast and sugar and letting it sit for about 5 minutes to activate the yeast. Then I added the rest of the ingredients minus the flour and then gradually added only 4 cups of bread flour to my stand mixer (paddle attachment) until mixed then changed over to my bread hook and let it run for about 9-10 minutes. The dough rose beautifully and made 6 bagels.

It didn’t seem worth the effort to me. I made this and it came out OK but bland. I was hoping it would have been better. It’s not an easy recipe. Takes time. Multiple steps. It was interesting and fun, and it’s good to know I can make a decent bagel, but I’d just buy bagels next time. I guess if you don’t have any bagel shops near you this is worthwhile, but even then, Lenders frozen bagels would be tempting to me as opposed to this recipe.

Flour to Water ratio is definitely wrong. Adding honey to the pot of boiling water didnt help, and in fact made it worse. The honey coated the bottom of my pot and stopped the water from boiling.  It just cooked onto the bottom and I ruined my pot. I advise against this recipe as it is.

Easy to follow recipe. I loved the texture of the bagels. Soft and chewy. Very very tasty.  I did make 8 smaller sized bagels which were a good size. I used 2 1/2 cups of high-grade flour and 1/2 cup whole grain bread flour. Kneaded the dough by hand, which was for a good 15 minutes till the desired texture was achieved. I did boil them in water with honey and boiled them for 1 minute on each side as they were floating straight away. Then sprinkled coarse sea salt on them before baking in a very hot oven.  Will be making these again very soon.

Had to add a little extra water, dough seemed a little dry. Also most definitely needs an eggwash before any toppings, gives it a nice glossy finish . Overall easy recipe and good first attempt at bagels!

As I wait for the dough to rise, here is my experience so far:

1. Oops, bought quick activating yeast instead of instant yeast. Google says add another 25% if substituting one for the other. Presumably that's the liquid at the bottom... or is it the foam? Which part is which? I'll add a tablespoon of each - that way I'll know I have the right stuff... Or did I just use twice of what I should? Argh - yeast is confusing!!!

2. Noob question: Canola is a vegetable, right? Yeah, I'm sure everyone does this...

3. Took a while to absorb all that powder. I was really tempted to add water - but ripping the dough by hand would expose moistness, and after a few minutes it was all good. No problems finding that perfect consistency described in the recipe.

Adapted for gluten free: I used Bobs Red Mill 1 to 1 gf flour and added a cup of grated mozzarella cheese to make the first batch. Had to add a bit more water than the recipe calls for. They were beautiful but didn't rise so we're dense and slightly raw. Second batch I used Williams Sonoma cup 4 cup flour but no cheese. Came out perfect. As close to real NY bagel bakery bagels as I can imagine. Daughter wants me to start selling them!

These came out perfect!! It was the first time I've made bagels and my picky eater said they came out as good as "real" bagels. It was really easy to add in flavorings to make everything bagels, chocolate chip, cheddar, and blueberry just by splitting out the dough into batches first.

I like this recipe and I hate bagels, the only changes I make are when I cook them.  When I am ready to put them in the oven I add oil to the pan, it makes the bagels come out crispy and crunchy. I hate bagels because they are so chewy ( whole point of bagels), its mouth workout but if you bake them with oil their not as chewy and have more crunch. I even warm them up with little oil ( half them first) and sometimes top with little cheese. Recipe great as is for chewy bagels, thanks for the recipe.

I love the recipe and my bagels turned out ok. It seems I'll make sure that I always have them in the fridge to have them for breakfast at work, might even add other ingredients for different flavours. It's a thumbs up from me ??

Simply amazing bagels.  I made these for a brunch of 15 people - made a triple batch (first time ever making these) - so simple and what a hit!  Not a single bagel left - guests were happy, not to say impressed:-)

I love this recipe! The taste is great, as is the texture. I would agree with other posts to use 1/4 cup less flour. I have made it the way it is stated, but the dough is dryer, and takes longer to knead. I also added more oil when kneading, to help the texture. Another note, I kneaded by hand because the dough was a bit rough on my kitchen aid.

I'd make these again! I don't have a mixer so I did it all by hand and it was fine. But as many other reviewers said, cut back on flour (I did not, and ended up adding about another half cup of water). I used coconut oil with no quams, but perhaps the vegetable oil would have been more flavourful. Next time I will skip the honey in the boiling water, I think that's why the bottoms of my bagels were a little bit burnt :( I baked for 13 mins at 450 and it was good enough for me! Made 11 big bagels.

These bagels worked!  This was the first time I tried making bagels and the changes  I made were I used a little less flour (4 cups), I used all purpose flour because I didn't have bread flour on hand, and I didn't use instant yeast for the same reason.  Other than that I followed the recipe and they came out yummy :-).

These ended up pretty hard for me but I think that, that might of happened because when I was rising my dough my oven temp was too hot so my dough got a little cooked when it was rising.  I will try this recipe again I will just not cook the dough next time.  : )

The first time I made this as the recipe indicated, except for only adding 4 cups of flour.  This time I am dividing the recipe into 8 bagels instead of 6.  The only issue I have is that they float immediately.  Not sure how long to boil them for, also they were a little big for our needs.  We have LOVED these bagels.

I made bagels for the first time ever using this recipe.  It was amazingly simple to do - although I did have to kneed the dough a bit by hand as my Kitchen Aid was struggling.  I did get 11 bagels as there was way too much dough for just 6!  Split between sesame seed and poppy seed (I added honey to the boiling water for the poppy seed ones).  They came out so light and fluffy!  Sorry, could not give 5 stars due to having to kneed by hand for a bit and the recipe saying 6 bagels - they would have been huge!

I really liked this recipe, as did the rest of the family. I did have to add about 1/4 cup more water , as the original measurements produced a dough that would not hold together. 
I see lots of possibilities with this recipe and various toppings.

I loved this recipe. I made 2 batches today and both turned out fantastic. I followed the advice of others and played with the flour/water ratio.  The first batch I reduced flour, and added in some mixed brown sugar and cinnamon after the dough was formed.. they are delicious! The second batch (sweet onion teriyaki), I sauteed some onions with butter, teriyaki sauce, and garlic, then melted in some brown sugar which turned out very wet so I used a little extra flour.. it really needs to be adjusted based on consistency of the dough itself.  I cut each batch down into 8 bagels, rather than six, and they were very large. I also rolled them into balls and used my thumb to make the holes in the center.  They are so delicious, I made 16 bagels today and tonight before bed, there's only a few left. My family devoured them!

Easy and delicious! I've made these multiple times now utilizing different flours. Most recently, I used Bob's Red Mill Multigrain Bread Mix, and the bagels came out amazing! I added a little extra ground flax (1/3 c), used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and sat the bagels in cornmeal after boiling them. I don't think I'll ever buy bread again! Plus, the kids had a great time checking in on the bread to watch it rise. Magic!

I have not had a good bagel in years, Since I went Gluten Free.  I made this recipe Gluten Free and MMMMMM......  I did change the recipe, only by making it GF, by using GF flour ~ which means I had to cut down on the amount of flour to 3 3/4 cups and 1 extra Tablespoon of water.  I am working on making my own rainbow bagels for fun.  So have added color, used my Wilton colorings to make the colors of the super bowl teams today.

I cut the recipe in a half because I did not have enough flour and used dandelion honey and olive oil as here in Italy malt syrup is impossible to find, well they turned out FANTASTIC! great recipe. Also I don't have a dough hook but working really hard the dough turns out fine!

Fantastic recipe. I did two batches - one with an overnight ferment and the second with the two hr rise. both batches came out deliciously. I didn't have bread flour, so I added 2 1/2 Tb gluten per 2c flour. I find gluten in the bulk aisles or the baking section of my grocery store. I mostly ignored the measurement for water, but simply added until a rough dough formed, then just enough for a more silky texture. the "window-pane" tip was absolutely perfect,so thanks for that.

Great recipe! It exceeded my high expectations. I did make a few minor changes. When I make bread I usually allow the yeast to bloom in the sugar and water before I add the other ingredients. I didn't have instant yeast so I used rapid rise yeast and allowed it to rise once in a bowl and again after I shaped the bagels. To shape them I made them into little rolls and then used an apple corer to create a hole in the middle. The recipe says it makes 6 bagels, but unless you like gigantic bagels, I would separate the dough into a few more bagels.

This was my first attempt at bagels.  The dough was dry so I added water a tablespoon at a time .  You just need to watch the dough and look for the right consistency.  If you add too much water  just sprinkle with a bit more flour.  I think  I kneaded about  12 minutes with the kitchen aid.  It was a little tough on the motor so I just stopped every couple of minutes to scrape the dough off the hook and test the consistency.  As soon as it had some stretch I stopped.  I made  8 sesame seed and  sharp cheddar bagels and lined my cookie sheet with a silicone mat.  They turned out beautifully and I have been told by many people that they are the best bagels they have ever eaten. They were gone within hours.  I  can't wait to make another batch!

My first batch was rather successful. Great flavor. . .and they "almost" looked like real bagels!  with my next batch, I'm going to change the way I form them.  Instead of "rolling them like sausages and forming a circle,” I’m going to form the dough balls and poke a hole in them.   When I tried to do it the way the recipe instructs, they separate in the boiling process.  I'm also going to spread the dough out (but not too flat) and cut it into even parts.  When I tried to do it with the dough in a big ball, I got about 12 different size bagels.  Lastly, I might add a little more salt for flavor.   The recipe is perfect, the baker isn’t.  LOL

The second batch with the changes worked like a charm.  Now I need to play with the baking process to keep the bottoms from sticking and/or getting too dark.

This is an easy recipe and the results are very good.  I made some changes that might be of interrest:
Used 3 cups all purpose flour and 1.5 cups of whole wheat.  
Added chopped dates.  
Others have noted that you will need to use a little more water.  About a quarter cup more.
I boiled the bagels in a mixture of 2 quarts water, 2 T honey, and 2 T molasses.
I didn't use any coatings after boiling.  
I divided the dough into 12 portions.  The bagels came out medium sized and baked up well (18 min @ 475F)

I try to make a batch of these every Saturday morning, then bag them up for the week.

Great for sandwiches with fresh sliced deli meats, or toast them and spread some cream cheese with onion powder sprinkled on top.

They don't last long outside of the freezer though, so be careful when storing those foods that don't have preservatives.

As with most other reviewers, I found i had to add more water to the dough.  Will use 4 cups next time.  Will also make into 12 instead of 6.  Maybe because the dough was a bit dry, but I had trouble getting the ends to stick.  Will try the ball with the finger poked thru method next time - I think that would be easier.  Mine floated immediately so I cooked 1 minute per side which seemed to work well.  The biggest thing I found, which isn't mentioned much in other reviews, is that they browned really fast at 475.  Mine were done in about 8 minutes.  any longer and they would have been burned.  Flavour and texture seem quite good so will make again.

Having only once, many years ago, made bagels that were a huge failure, I thought now after 20 years I would try them again.  I lined up all of my ingredients , all liquids added to the bowl, then all dry ingredients like I would for a bread machine.  I made sure that I used the mixer on low and then found #2 speed was good for my Kitchen Aide.  Be sure to lock the top from rising or bouncing.  The dough rose perhaps longer than the recipe advised.  I made 12.  I put them in the boiling water watched them waiting for them to drop to the bottom, never happened.  Each of the 12 floated immediately!  I turned them, removed them from the water and found them too hot to put onto the topping.  When they cooled off a bit I pressed the tops into minced garlic.  They aren't as pretty as a professional makes them.  But, tasty, even if I forgot to add the salt!  It's that measure-twice-cut- once concept!  The other topping was salt.  Use sparingly!!  All in all I am quite impressed with the effort I put forth.  One question, what does the boiling do for the bagels?

I love, love, love this recipe. The only thing I will change is the size of the individual bagel. They're just too big if you only make six. I think 10 would be perfect for folks that are interested in having a bagel in addition to other breakfast foods.

Took everyone's advice on the 4 cups of flour, glad I did! I definitely heated up my kitchen aid. Dough hooked it for about 12 minutes. The dough did not get translucent when pulled apart. It stretched a little.  I could have added more water (1/4 cup more) based on what other reviewers said. I brushed them with egg whites too. A couple of notes:
Do NOT use wax paper instead of parchment paper. Okay, I'm new to baking and didn't know. I lost the bottom of my bagels. 
I would SPRAY YOUR PARCHMENT PAPER WITH OIL, just in case. 
I made 12 decent sized bagels with the quantities used. 6 bagels would be ridiculously large.  
The bagels tasted incredible. That is for sure, even after I had to slice off the bottoms :). We wanted to eat them all.

This recipe was amazing!  I made it last week and turned it into 8 bagels.  We loved it so much I'm having a deli night gathering with friends tonight.  I'm making 8 plain, 8 with sesame seeds, 8 jalapeno cheddar, 8 cinnamon raisin.  I'm so excited for my friends to enjoy.  Note, for the ones I added ingredients to I also added 1 beaten egg white as a binder.

My first attempt at bagels. My family loved them!! I added carmalized onions on the top. These are my husband's words that he sent me via text on his way to work. "Mmmm. What an amazing bagel. ACTUAL pieces of onion unlike those store bought ones where a microscope would not be able to show evidence of onion remnants". I plan on making more today.

I started this recipe twice and both times the dough is very very dry at the end of the 8 minute mark. I tired adding a little more warm water but still dry.

As stated above the bagels themselves are a bit bland, but they are perfect for sandwiches, cream cheese, butter etc...  my kids love them, they are easy to make and don't last long in my house.  I don't bake them for any amount of time, I bake them to color.  Very nice recipe!

I liked it, I used less flour also, just 4 cups. My yeast musta been bad because they were very dense. But I figured why waste so I cooked the anyway. Dough was tough after 15 min of kneading. They didn't float either. I will try again. I have some dried cherries I want to put in. Wanna find some cherry flavoring to add more cherry flavor. Very easy and taste good!

I made this recipe a few weeks ago, and we loved it! I would give a 5 for the taste, but because of the excess flour, I down graded a bit. I did modify a bit, by adding 1/4 cup oat groats, and 1/2 cup brown flour (reduced white by 1). I did make the mistake with the flour the first time (nearly killed my mixer) but by adding lots of water (by hand) I was able to salvage the dough. Today I made again, this time starting with a total of 2.5 cups flour/grain, and added flour as needed to achieve the proper texture. After the first batch my Husband has been begging me to make again! These are way better than bought, and so much easier to digest! I don't see us buying bagels again!!! Thank you so much for the recipe Plawhon, and thank you Wannabechef for your advice as well!

Delicious!
Dough was a little hard on the mixer.
Bagels were boiled in water (no honey, sugar or salt), and the crusts were the perfect texture.
After baking, the outside was golden and the insides were beautifully soft with nice air pockets.
Final product -10 out of 10!!!

This recipe is much too bready, it doesn't have the right chew in the middle. I only let them rise for 20 minutes and it was still much too airy and tender in the middle. I also washed them with egg to get proper coloring. They had a nice outer texture though. I had to add a touch more water but that just happens with flour. Next time I will half the yeast.

We loved this recipe!  I took my snakes and wrapped hot dogs, boiled them for a minute and baked for about 12 min.  So yummy.  You will have dough leftover if you make a pack of hot dogs.  I used the leftover dough to make plain bagels. I did leave the dough in the mixer for about 12 min rather than 8.  Awesome!  Thanks so much!

I went to my local Panera's to get bagels yesterday but they were out so I decided to make my own. The bagels just came out of the oven and they are wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I do not have a dough hook so I kneaded by hand. I also used 1/2 cup less bread flour since the bread flour I use makes very dense doughs and baked the bagels on a Silpat. I am not a novice baker but I have never made bagels before. The recipe was easy to follow, easy to execute and the bagels are fantastic. Mine turned out a little less beautiful than Panera's bagels, but with practice I think that I can fix the issue. The hardest part for me was keeping the ends together. I had one bagel that released in the water and I had to stick the ends back together before baking. I no longer see much reason to buy bagels. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe creates thick, dry dough that my KitchenAid mixer could not handle--it actually started smoking. I tried hand kneading and it was just too thick and dry. Really disappointed since the reviews were so great :(

I took another reviewer's suggestion and let the yeast dissolve in the sugar and warm water for about five to seven minutes before adding he flour.  I used 4 cups of flour instead of 4 1/2 and added 2 tablespoons of gluten for extra chewiness.  I also added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the honey in the water.  After they were baked, the bagels that were on parchment paper stuck to the parchment paper and so we had to cut off the bottoms of the ones on the paper--I probably used the wrong type of paper.  However, the ones that were cooked on non-stick cookie sheets with a dusting of cornmeal on the bottom turned out much better.  We added herbs, salt, poppy seeds and sesame seeds to the tops of some.

I live on Bagels, but when I Travel To  DR  you don't find them because there are not made here. And if you find them in the super market,  there are  over priced. Good luck trying to find bread flour. I have never found  any. So I google how to make my own bread flour.  Got to say I was a little worry that  the all purpose flour ratio for bread flour would not yield  good raise of the dough. But it  was good bagels after all. I  put the water, sugar and yeast to cream up, and that added to flour.   Used in my kitchen aid with the hook for about 6 minutes . ,  two hours later double was more than double in size. Than followed the rest of the instruction and got great bagels. Even my husband was impress . Will be doing these form now on.  To do my own bread flour. For every cup of all purpose flour you add 1 tablespoon  of all purpose flour.  This is third world country,  it's very hard to find a lot of baking ingredients .

Very easy to follow recipe. Dough took more than 30 minutes to knead with my KitchenAid stand mixer but I didn't have bread flour on hand, only regular flour which may have been the culprit. I also substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil which I do for all my recipes. I baked them on no-stick Reynold's Wrap since my parchment paper is only rated for a max temp of 350. I also didn't bring water to a rolling boil, just a rapid simmer; from previous experience, the rolling boil splashes up too much and disfigures the unboiled side of the bagels. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I loved this recipe. It was very easy to follow and my bagels came out delicious! The only things I have to change (this could be due to different altitudes..) is the time I bake them, and I found I had to add about 1/4 cup more water as the dough was mixing (it definitely gave my kitchen aid mixer a workout!). 15 minutes baking for me almost burned them, but luckily didn't too bad to where they weren't edible. I also added the onion flakes and raisins into the dough batches as someone else said they did. Overall, I was very happy with how they turned out and would definitely recommend this recipe. Just be sure to watch and adjust your baking time (if you need to).

Easy to make but it needs adjusting. It needs more water, at least a cup more. It was very hard on my Kitchenaid, the machine got super hot and I could not get the dough well mixed because I was afraid of ruining my machine. Hard to knead by hand.

This was my first experiment making bagels, the dough went together easily and was a perfect texture when it came time to shape the bagels.  I had a little trouble getting the ends to stick without making it look rough...and when they boiled they got huge! I noticed on my first batch (I doubled it)the "seams" on part of some of the bagels was a little gooey where I guess the water hadn't drained enough when I put it on the cookie sheet. Most the bagels turned out decent looking (even though I didn't use an egg wash or any toppings).  I would definitely recommend toppings, I just didn't take the time to do it on these batches. The taste is awesome, and reminds me of a REAL bagel! The texture is great too. I can't wait to have a bagel sandwich and bagels and cream cheese tomorrow! Thanks!
