Have used this recipe as is for years! Despite the other person saying to drain the pineapple, if you add the coconut do NOT drain it! This recipe is great as is-works great in an angel food pan too!

This is the first carrot cake I've made, and I don't need to keep looking! This cake is so delicious! I followed the recipe, omited nuts, baked in a glass 10x13 for 53 min and was glad I checked it when I did. It would have been dry if left for the full hour. The cake is moist, light, and so full of healthy fiber! I did end up doubling the frosting recipe. It didn't look like enough, and I really love cream cheese frosting ;)

Next time, I'll add more spices to get a spicier cake. I'd also like to try some golden raisins!

Excellent.  Drain your pineapple thoroughly.  Did not have/use coconut.  Thanks for sharing!

Keeper!  Kid approved too!  Make sure you drain the pineapple!  I made this as directed - I did leave out the coconut and nuts - family preference - did not adjust any other amounts or ingredients.  I used a 13 x 9 pan and it was done in about 45 minutes. One note - next time I would probably add a teaspoon of baking powder in addition to the baking soda to give it a bit more lift.   The taste was perfect as written.  Enjoy!

After reading reviews I too decided to substitute 1 cup of applesauce for oil, and the cake turned out beautifully. I added a cup of raisins instead of using coconut. Borrowing from another recipe I also added grated orange zest to the frosting which gave it a nice flavour. Two thumbs up!

A keeper! Made the cake exactly as written. It was moist and sweet enough that I didn't even put icing on it. No leftovers! I look forward to making this again!

first time making, family loved it. for the frosting though i only used 1/2 cup of conf. sugar and add 8oz of cream cheese, it was more cream cheesy tasting instead of too sweet.

Only complaint was that the frosting recipe needs to be doubled. I used half whole wheat flour and half  all purpose flour just because I could and I like to do so when I can. Probably used much more cinnamon than what's called for, but again, that's because I like cinnamon. Turned out really well- even at high altitude! Would definitely make it again.

I love, love, love carrot cake. But--boy, I must have done something wrong with this one! I followed the recipe to the letter, but when it was done it was awful! I'm a baker, love to bake, but this cake I took one bite and cringed. I tried one more bite and threw the rest in the garbage! It left me with a bad, almost chemical, taste in my mouth. I won't make this one again.

This cake is really, really good!  Shortened baking time to 50 minutes.  I could have eaten the batter alone with a spoon.   I should have followed the Calculator1957 suggestion about not draining the pineapple, as it is a touch dry, but nothing a glass of milk didn't fix.  Husband gave it a thumbs up with mouthful of cake :)  will definitely make it again.

Made this for the Canada 150 weekend.  Turned out excellent as usual although next time I'll double up on the frosting.  Like the idea of previous reviewers - cutting down on the icing sugar and increasing the cream cheese.

I drained the pineapple very well and think it could have used some of the juice. I also added a half cup of golden raisins and pecans instead of walnuts.  Very good. I will make again with the modification. I made two round cakes for a layer cake and doubled the frosting recipe to put in between the layers.

This was my first time making a carrot cake. I always had the impression that it was difficult to do. This recipe was easy and the results were fantastic. No more having to buy a Carrot Cake, which is my favorite cake.

This recipe turned out amazing! It was the very first time that I have made Carrot Cake and I am happy to say this recipe is the work and tasted great as it. I made with all the ingredients as stated which made for a great texture.   The only tweak was to the icing.  I added a  small plash of milk to help with the mixing which also gave it a bit of a gloss.  Thanks for sharing!

Great carrot cake, so moist and flavourful. Fairly easy to make and the timing was bang on. I made a few changes, subbed avocado oil for the veg. oil and left out the nuts and coconut, personal preference.  I baked this  in a bundt  pan instead of a 9x13. Great recipe, thanks  Food Eater and sister Beth.

Awesome! Made this for the family and they loved it. Made as directed.
