Excellent!
To make your own buttermilk, combine 1 cup milk with 1 TBSP white vinegar, stir, let sit for 2-3 minutes. You will only need 2/3 Cup buttermilk for this recipe.

I have a few suggestions to those who are having a tough time with this recipe.
*Do not use bread flour
*Do not overknead, you want the lumps there.
*Make sure you watch your biscuits, it may finish baking before the stated time. Some ovens are more hotter than others.
*If your in a hotter climate, try refrigerating your mix until it's really cold before using it in a recipe.
*Make sure your spooning the flour into the measuring cup, you may be adding too much flour.
*You could try to use cake flour, if you don't have any cake flour make your own: before adding flour to your measuring cup, add 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch first, then add the all purpose flour to make a cup-do this for all ten cups.
Hope this helps, enjoy! 
The recipe for biscuits are in the footnotes right under the recipe for the mix.

This is an okay recipe, but real biscuits never use oil (if you're limited on your diet, you can use it but they won't be great biscuits) and use shortening instead (or butter, but that one is tricky). Also this does NOT need refrigeration for storage, UNLESS you use butter. Remember that you buy flour, baking powder, sugar, salt and shortening unrefrigerated and none of those are required to be refrigerated after opening. Why start now? Come to think of it, you don't refrigerate Bisquick either! Using powdered buttermilk is a good idea to stir in before hand, but decrease your flour by the same amount and instead of using water (since you have powdered buttermilk in it already) use milk for the liquid. Finally, a lot of people have trouble with biscuits when you "roll it out on a lightly floured surface." If you do have trouble with that, or have trouble kneading, don't bother doing either. Just mix it up well in the bowl, lightly flour the surface (I use an actual body powder puff which was, obviously, never used for body powder) put it out on the surface, gently pat it out, cut it, and use a metal spatula to carefully peel it off. This will get you by until you're a biscuit expert. It sure helped me in my early years! Overworking the dough makes them tough. Finally, the recipe says store for up to 3 months, but I've stored it for much MUCH longer without issues. That varies due to the quality of the ingredients. Some baking powder will lose it's lift, etc.

Finally – after searching for a long time -- found your really good biscuit mix; thank you!  I hate to use Bisquick because the ingredients on the box note aluminum in the baking powder and partially hydrogenated oils.  Don't want either of those ingredients in my food! I use only aluminum-free baking powder (easy to find – Argo is one brand).   
   If I don't have buttermilk on hand, I make it by adding 2 teaspoons of vinegar to 3/4 cup of milk.  It should be white vinegar; used organic cider vinegar once – interesting taste!  
   Sometimes, I make this marvelous recipe with regular milk and a few spoonfuls of plain yogurt (the acid activates the baking powder).  I use olive oil, and, sometimes, coconut oil, just for a different taste.  Have made this recipe  with orange juice instead of milk (the juice's acid gives the kick to the baking powder).  
   I cut the sugar back a bit.  Sometimes, I add yeast to the liquid and let it rise (no kneading).  Gives a "bready" flavor – good for pizza base.  I always use a Silpat silicone baking liner – NOTHING sticks to it, not even melted cheese or burned brown sugar.  
   Both daughters want me to will my two Silpats to them, ha, ha!

This is a great starter recipe for all kinds of yummy things. My two year old and I made blueberry pancakes using this recipe in place of Bisquck, they turned out fluffy and light. So much cheaper to make verses buying Bisquick and not hard at all.

Thanks for the recipe. I was making biscuits this morning and had no biscuit mix. Luckily I looked on this site and of course someone came through! I will use this from now on as I don't like to use prepacked stuff when homemade is so much better and this was so quick and easy. Thanks!

I can't thank you enough.  I had a bunch of pulled pork that was going to go bad, so I decided to make little 'pork pies' using your biscuit mix.  I was already in my pj's for the night and didn't want to venture out for a box of Bisquick.  You've saved my night, that's for darn sure!  Thank you for your wonderful recipe, from the bottom of this Texas girl's heart.

I make this as a fill in for bisquick, which I never seem to keep on hand. I like to use half whole wheat flour, aluminum-free baking powder and instead of vegetable oil, I use the same amount of Crisco and cut it into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter. Super cinch. This halves well and keeps really well in Tupperware in a cool pantry or fridge/freezer.

I needed a biscuit mix for a recipe and since I rarely use it, the box in my pantry had to be thrown away due to the fact that it was only good till 2010 (oooops). I found this recipe made as is and scaled it down to 16 servings, this was the perfect amount for my recipe and I have some left over to make a batch of biscuits. The recipe I used it in turned out fantastic, so I will never buy a box mix again! Thanks for sharing :)

"To anyone confused. This is not a recipe for southern style biscuits. It is a subtitute for Bisquick type baking mixes at the store." Either way, this worked pretty good. I liked that it was made with vegetable oil instead of vegetable shortening like the commercial variety. I used the calculate button and made 12 servings. It made about 2 1/2 cups and I needed 2 cups of baking mix for a recipe. The mix is like a crumbly version of the baking mix in a box. I used the liquid measurement on the recipe I chose. Other recipes can also be found on the Bisquick or Jiffy website more likely to use this in such as drop biscuits, pancakes.... The other difference is this dough is a tad more sticky, than the commercial baking mix, once the liquid is added when making a recipe. I had to add 3-4 minutes extra on the baking time on the recipe I made. However, great money saver even if you barely use it. I was told on the buzz that this can be made ahead, and froze in a freezer bag, for when needed.

This mix worked great for our picnic!  I mixed it up at home, adding powdered buttermilk, so that all I had to add was water to make the dough.  We used a couple of tablespoons of oil to cook them in our pan on our camp stove.  They turned out soft, and really tasty!

I have been making this for years and I NEVER buy biscuit mix anymore. BTW I do not use this mix for biscuits. I use it for recipes that call for bisquick. Making homemade buttermilk biscuits is so easy, I would not be inclined to make them from a mix. Still, this is a great recipe for the person who does not like to keep commercial mixes in their pantry. VERY CHEAP to make too.

EXCELLENT!    I'm currently living in the D.R. as a missionary.  Finding biscuit mixes is really difficult and sometimes expensive!    I'm sooooo, sooooo happy and thankful to have found this recipe!  My husband was very pleased, and he's really picky.  My kids gobbled it right up!  And even though I had to use shelf stable milk, they were STILL good.  I used about 2/3 cup of milk and mixed in enough mix to make a soft dough, for drop biscuits.   THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!!

Super easy! I only made enough for one batch (6 servings) just to try it out. I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil, used white whole wheat pastry flour and put in only 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder since I was using it right away. I also changed the sugar to 3 tsp to offset the bitterness of the whole wheat flour and baking powder. I used another recipe on this site that uses yogurt instead of buttermilk and the combination was perfect. My three year old did most of the mixing and helped drop the biscuits in the pan. He usually likes to help do everything but eat my biscuits but this time he had three! Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't use this for biscuits, but as a substitute for the baking mix in a box, it's fantastic.  My family requested my cheeseburger balls before the super bowl, and I was out of baking mix.  On to AR to find a substitute I went, and I'm so glad I found this recipe.  I made a much smaller batch, but it worked perfectly.  I will never need to buy baking mix again!  Oh, and I added a bit of white whole wheat flour for some of the AP flour.  No one could even tell!

I did not have the name brand baking mix on hand to make a cheeseburger pie.  I looked for a recipe on allrecipes.com and found this one.  I adjusted the recipe for 4 servings instead of 48.  It worked very nicely and my dinner came out as good as it does with the name brand mix!  I will add this to my recipe box.

Loved it, didn't have buttermilk or vinegar to make it so I just made drop biscuits with regular milk. Reduced oven to 400 and baked a bit longer (4 mins) or so, because they were burning a litle at the higher temp. Came out perfect, fluffy and soft; added some honey to the top once baked and reminded me of churchs honey butter biscuits!

Yep!  This is good and the biscuits are tender.  DON'T knead too much.  Will make them tough as a styrofoam cooler.

Excellent!  I used it in a quiche recipe and it added better flavor than buying a mix from the store.

Perfect! It's homemade and takes little time to mix - much less time than going to the store. I just made some lovely biscuits - thanks!

I scaled this down to 8 servings which made about 2 cups worth of mix but fixed it according to recipe.  I was thrilled how my biscuits turned out.

I have been using a different biscuit recipe from this site for a while now and wanted to try something new.  This recipe was quick and easy.  The biscuits were light and fluffy.  We had biscuits and gravy with them and my husband loved them!

I first experimented with a small batch about half the sized called for in the recipe.  I had never made biscuits before and was not sure what to expect.  I needn't have worried.  This recipe is awesome.  It works every time without fail.  I especially liked the extra tip to add buttermilk.  I used powdered buttermilk (2.5 tbs + 2/3 cup of water) and  1/8 tsp of salt.  The biscuits come out perfect every time.  They are identical to the stuff you get at KFC or McDonalds only they don't have saturated fat.  This recipe is a keeper!

I make this all the time. I switched from bisquick. It got quite expensive. I prefer Bisquick.  this is the next best alternative to Bisquick. I add a little bit more lard to the mix. it takes the mix more fluffy when baking visit a Cyrus and pancakes.

I need to start out by saying I am not fond of bisquits, I made up these because my husband likes them and we had no biscuit mix. They cook up amazing and fast! And they are delicious! I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I just used regular whole milk and they still came out yummy. You have to kinda babysit them a bit or they get dry and hard kinda fast. But I usually babysit my food when I'm cooking anyway so no big deal. I made mine tiny to be served next to eggs and added a dab of butter and honey. these were perfect! Definitively making these again!

This recipe is great!  Thanks!! Best when Tenderflake lard is used.  Just a note to Graceeh - canola oil is very UNHEALTHY. Better to use peanut or olive or grapeseed or walnut or coconut oil - anything but canola oil.  Canola oil is processed using high heat and that destroys all of the healthy qualities by altering the molecules

I have had this recipe for some time but never got around to trying it. I must say this is the very best biscuit recipe I have EVER found. The bread has a nice and moist crumb, great flavor and every one who has tried them say they are the best I've ever made. Thanks so much for the posting, I plan to keep this mix made up and in my pantry for the future use of this marvelous bread.

Wow! I've just made this. Only I set the servings calculator to 6 servings, using 1/3 cup buttermilk (made by adding 1 tsp lemon juice to regular milk). I'd never eaten biscuits before, but these tasted better than what I'd imagined. Thumbs up! And thanks for the great recipe. Next time I might increase the sugar to double though.

I think this is a good basic recipe.  I like the idea of adding powdered milk.  I also leave out the oil and add it when I am ready to mix up a batch, that way I don't have to store it in the fridge.  Just add 1 oz. of oil or a tablespoon of shortening per cup of mix along with the liquid.  This also make great pancakes by adding an egg, a little baking soda for better rise and liquid to the consistency you like.  
By the way the only way you will get biscuits like the photo is to roll out the dough, butter it, fold it over and roll it out again several times.  Then let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes before baking.  You may also have to add more baking powder.  I'm not sure about the amount of baking powder because I haven't tried it with this recipe.

We did this but added one little step: Instead of kneading the dough we mixed, then rolled it out once with a floured roller, spread a thin layer of softend butter then folded it in half and repeated the process about 6 times. Oh my goodness!! They came out so fluffy and layered. We just loved them. And they're GREAT with jam. Thank you so much, it sure makes biscuits at dinner time much easier.

I don't like the taste of commercial biscuit mix, so I never keep it on hand. I wanted to try the Garlic Cheese Biscuits from this site which called for baking mix. I used this Homemade Biscuit Mix recipe and was really pleased. Very easy to work with and tasted great! Thank you!

This is the only biscuit recipe I will use. It is so versatile, and no matter how you change it, the biscuits always come out great. I have used veggie oil, olive oil or grapeseed oil, whatever was on hand, all with excellent results. I have also used wholewheat flour, regular milk, buttermilk and even soy milk and the biscuits  always get rave reviews. If reviewers are having difficulty with this recipe they must be doing something wrong. Again, it doesn't matter what I do to this recipe, my biscuits always come out light and fluffy.

My Mom always had her own biscuit mix on hand, and it was great! I didn't know her quantities, so was happy to find this recipe.  Have never tried biscuits with oil, just shortening, butter or margarine.  I will have to try this.

While I would not be likely to make biscuits with this mix (I prefer shortening) it is a very good substitute for the stuff in the yellow box and has the advantage of being fresh and you know what all the ingredients are.  I have used it for coffee cake and in a quiche type recipe quite well.  Thanks for a very handy recipe.

I haven't made biscuits from scratch in almost 10 years because the first time I made them they turned out wrong.  I was always hesitant to try again.  I braved it today and they turned out great!  There are a few things I'll do differently next time like not roll them out as thin and bake them a little less than the 10 minutes.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

I decreased the recipe by 1/10 amount using the measurement converter on Google; used cream in place of buttermilk; added 1/4 cup grated extra sharp cheddar, rolled out and cut with 2 " round biscuit crimper shape and they made  the lightest, fluffiest melt-in-mouth cheese biscuits ever!

Great mix to have on hand. I also substituted some buttermilk powder for the flour.  I cut the recipe in half since there is only two of us.  When I made the biscuits, I added grated cheddar, chopped green onions and some garlic powder.  They turned out delicious.   Thanks.  I too won't be buying Bisquick again!

I just purchased the ingredients for this recipe so I haven't made it yet.  I am very excited to find a recipe using oil instead of the hydrogenated shortening most of the recipes call for.  I am old enough to remember when they were made with lard.  Those were good biscuits.  However, lard is hydrogenated now also so I don't use that either. Canola is made of a GMO rapeseed so no matter how good the advertising I cannot think it is as good for us as safflower, corn or coconut oil. I use mostly coconut oil or safflower oil. I also am interested in including the dry buttermilk mix.  I am going to go try them right now.

I was disappointed in how these biscuits turned out. They were hard on the outside.  The recipe certainly was easy to follow, but my biscuits obviously were not as good as other reviewers have described.  I don't know if it was something I did.  I will try this again (as I have more mix already made!), and hopefully will have better luck the next time.

Just made these, wow...better than I thought.  I used regular milk and used the milk as an egg wash for the top before baking, they turned out fantastic. you can eat these just plain out of the oven with no butter, there that good, I will use this recipe for making chicken pot pie also.  Thank you for the great easy recipe.

This recipe is pretty good.  I like the fact that it doesn't use shortening.  The biscuits are good with butter and jam, and I have used this recipe instead of Bisquick in a few other recipes... pretty good. I did change 2 things... I added more sugar... given the amount of flour, I changed the sugar to 1/4 cup, and added 1/4 cup dry milk.  The biscuits turned out a little better when I made the changes.  By the way, I used milk to brush on top instead of the egg.

I made this using a 5 qt ice cream bucket for future use. I sub the flour for non-GMO whole wheat flour and also sub the white sugar for non-GMO sugar. I didn’t have any non-GMO or organic salt, baking powder. I could have used organic coconut oil (which I’ve done before and it turned out great! Lots healthier.) which I didn’t have enough so I used veggie oil.

It was pretty easy. I scaled it down to test the recipe. I used dry whole milk powder instead of buttermilk. about 1/2 c of the mix with 2 Tbsp of water and it made one decent sized biscuit. 

I am practising for light backpacking menus and this baked up in a muffin foil just right in a makeshift camp oven. It took about 20 min which is my guess when cooked over hot coals rather than direct heat. 

It will be a pleasure to have fresh baked bread once in a while during my hike.

I used this for a couple of recipes that used biscuit baking mix and it worked fine.  I waited to post my review until I had a chance to use it for making biscuits, and while I'm not a connoisseur of biscuits ( I always used refrigerator biscuits), they turned out real good.  It's nice to have a biscuit mix on hand that doesn't contain a lot of additives.

This was okay. Some in the family liked it and others did not at all. I was glad to find this recipe however because I had run out of butter. I used the mix to make biscuits.

I'm going to be real and say I made these because we were really tight on Cash and food a few days before payday.

I didn't have milk or buttermilk on hand, so I used 1/2 SourCream & 1/2 Water. 

They baked nice in 8minutes. The bottoms were a golden brown and the tops stayed a bright white. Maybe that was the sour cream? They were both crispy and chewy, which I admire in a biscuit.

However, they were a bit crumbly and bland for my taste. I needed coffee to help me choke down a bite that nearly killed me. Paired with coffee and some butter and sugar it was a very good poor man's breakfast. Hot, sweet, and hearty. Defiantly saved us this week!

Wish the actual baking recipe was included.   At the time I needed biscuit mix for a different recipe and this solved my issue.

My biscuits didn't rise as high as store bought. I think it needed a bit more baking powder.

I used a scaled down portion of this recipe for a caraway beer bread (2.5 cups mix, 2 tbsp sugar, 2 eggs, 1 cup beer) and it worked pretty well. I do wonder if I the baking powder amount could be reduced. (I have another recipe for baking powder biscuits that calls for only 1 tbsp baking powder per 2 cups of flour.)

The 10 cups of flour has to be wrong! I just made this recipe and no way did it work! I followed it to the tee! Thanks anyway. Not that we couldn't eat it, it was impossible to eat, let alone put it together.

Nothing like real biscuits. Not a fan even when they're drenched in sausage gravy or topped with chicken pot pie filling.
