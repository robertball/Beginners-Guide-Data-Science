It comes out just as tasty if you put most of the ingredients in the pot (cubed meat, bay leaf, carrots, celery, onion, mixed veg's, beef buillon, stewed tomatoes, black pepper and water) and slow cook it for 10 hrs or so, then add the barley and salt during the last 20 minutes of cooking. MUCH simpler this way and saves time from the original recipe.

Great recipe!  I used stew meat instead of the roast, and used 4 cups canned beef broth (ready- to-serve kind, not condensed kind) instead of the water and bouillon cube.  Thanks to a previous reviewer's recommendation, I put all ingredients except barley and salt in crockpot and cooked it on low for 10 hrs., then added the barley and salt during the last 20 minutes.  This greatly simplified the recipe! (I had hoped it might be done at 8 hrs., but the veggies were still slightly crunchy, so 10 hrs. is the right length.)

Excellent and easy.  I cooked 2 lbs. of chuck in crockpot for 5 hours the evening before I wanted to serve the soup. (Sprayed crockpot with Pam first.) After cooking, I smashed the beef into shreds (in the crockpot with a spoon.)  Then, after sauteeing the vegetables, I put everything in the crockpot (including the uncooked pearl barley) and put the crock in the frig.  I skipped the sugar, and used 2 extra cups of beef broth plus a couple generous dashes of Worcestershire Sauce.  When I woke up the next day, I turned the crock on low and cooked the soup all day.  Everyone loved it!  I will make this again and again.  After reading a few of the other reviews, I'm wondering if some of the reviewers who complained about mushy barley had inadvertently used instant barley in their soup. Whole pearl long-cooking barley holds up much better than instant barley.

This is a lovely recipe and here's an EASY way to do it.  Buy a couple pounds of stew meat (I cut it up even smaller than the butcher does) and put it in the crockpot the night before and sprinkle some Montreal Steak seasoning on it.  The next morning, put four cubes of beef bouillon, sugar, fresh garlic, crushed tomatoes (not stewed), bag of frozen mixed veggies and the four cups of water.  (Will probably come to the top of the crockpot.)  Cook on low for 10+ hours and in the last hour or so, add the barley.  This is a mainstay at our house and even my 14 month old likes it!

As others have done, I put everything in a crock pot, double the barley, use beef broth instead of water and bullion, and add additional veggies (a package of frozen broccoli crowns, 2-3 potatoes, diced, and 2 cans of chopped green chiles). I also use stew meat, cut into bite-sized pieces and brown it with the onion, worcestershire and ground black pepper before adding to the crock pot. The barley doesn't go in until the last hour. Great recipe, a favorite at home and hunting camp. It is even better on the second and third day.

I followed another reviewer's advice and put everything in the slow cooker right from the start.  I omitted the celery and carrots as the frozen mixed vegies were enough.  I used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and doubled the broth.  It was ready after 8 hours.  An absolutely wonderful soup!  My kitchen smelled great all day long.

Wow - thank you so much for an excellant base recipe for beef barley soup. i have been trying for a while to get a beef barley that tastes like my dear mothers - and nothing compared! I used this recipe as a base and it is PERFECT - upon reading lots of the reviews, i decided to cook everything in a crock pot - all at the same time except the barely which went in the last hour! my changes were such -using 10 cups of beef stock (home made) / used 4 bay leaves / less carrot and celary because of the frozen veggies / added 4 cloves of garlic / used crushed tomatos instead of stewed / added worshestershire sauce - about 1 tablespoon / and added fresh herbs which my mom always said makes the difference - added thyme / parsley / oregano AND basil. Upped the pearl barley to ONE CUP - to compinsate for the extra stock. cooked for 10 hours as alot of reviews stated on low in my crock pot.  YUM YUM YUM Y UM YUM! were were licking our bowls clean and i cannot wait to eat more! it is perfection!

This soup was good, with some modifications.  There wasn't enough barley, too many vegetables.  I recommend scaling the carrots and celery down.  Also, like another reviewer, we added thyme, oregano, basil, and worsheshire sauce for some flavor.  Also, I would have preferred diced tomatoes instead of stewed, they were hard to eat with a spoon.  But with these slight changes, the soup was delicious and the beef was very tender!

The was better then I expected--especially since the directions are so poorly written.  I added two cans of beef broth to the roast and cooked it on low while I was at work.  When I came home I removed the roast from the slow cooker to cool and poured the broth into a large measuring cup to skim the grease.  (A chuck roast is really fatty--good flavor, but you gotta drain the grease.)  Once the grease is skimmed add water or more beef broth to total the liquid required in the recipe.  Also, almost all the frozen mixed veggies in the store have carrots already in them--obviously you don't need to add fresh carrots if they're already in there.  I ended up just adding some frozen corn, green beans and peas seperately.  This was really meaty, I guess cause normally I add a pound, pound and a half of meat to my soup/stew, and this calls for a three pound pot roast.  You could use a smaller roast but my family thought the extra meat was the best part.

I'm on my 3rd time making this soup & we love it.  The only difference is that I cut the meat before I cook it (I've used a roast & round steak), and added a can of beef broth while it cooks in the slow cooker.  I just add all the veggies into the crock pot towards the end, a don't saute them, it tastes the same to me.  I also add a packet of gravey mix.  This is a keeper.

Threw the all the ingredients in the crockpot except the barley from the start.  Cooked for 12 hours on low and added barley for the last half hour on high.  This was very good.  Easy and hearty for the winter!

Delicious!  I added 1/2 cup red wine as suggested by other people.  I only used 1/2 the bag of mixed veggies and a 2 pound roast and it turned out very hearty with plenty of meat.  The flavor was delicious and it was more like a stew than a soup.  Just add more broth if you want it more soupy.  I will definitely make it again and I'm e-mailing the recipe to friends!

Thanks!!!!

P.S.  My pet peeve is when people change the recipe and rate it poorly - read the reviews of the poor ratings on this recipe and you'll notice that they didn't follow the recipe so they shouldn't have reviewed it in the first place!

This is a recipe my family has been using for years with slight variation.  My parents owned a restaurant and they tought us that the best flavor comes from meat on the bone so we use beef shank for soup. I have never made it in a slow cooker but do everything in one pot on the stove. Added diced tomatoes. We do take meat out once it is tender, dice it up and keep on the side to add back in later. Veggies get cooked in the meat broth to impart flavor into them as well. We pour the soup over a small amount of tiny acini de pepe pasta which is cooked separately and placed in the bowl first. As most restaurants, my mom always put a tiny dollop of butter on the pasta before the soup goes in.  With some homemade bread, it doesn't get any better than this!!

Cooked in the slow cooker. Browned beef first than transfered. I made some changes to this to give a little more flavor,you can use stew beef in place of the roast also. I added pearl onions, marjoram, thyme,2 tbs. worchestire sauce, beef base (I kept adding as cooking) a little basil, garlic pepper, I used alot of garlic. I used 2 pints of my (self) canned whole tomatoes. I also added 1 1/2 cups of barley. My whole family loves this soup, All the additions made it taste like a gourmet soup at a restaurant.this is the second time I have made this.

Splendid! A rich, hearty, soup that was DEFINITELY better the second day. Next time I won't even plan to eat it for dinner the first day--so worth the wait! My tweaks: 1) I pre-cut the meat into bite-sized pieces and browned it in small batches in a skillet (large batches get too soupy). 2) Next, I sauteed the onion in the same pan. 3) I omitted the frozen veggies and doubled the carrots and celery. 4) I used 4 (14 oz) cans of broth. 5) I substituted canned diced tomatoes for the stewed. 5) I dumped everything into the crock pot at once along with the browned meat and onions and, as per others' suggestion, added the barley during the last hour. It didn't plump fully, so next time I'll add it during the last 2 hours. The soup needed 8 hours on low in order to cook the carrots. I froze two 1-gallon Zip-Locs and still had enough left for a full meal!

This recipie is *wonderful.*  I make big batches of it and keep it in the freezer in meal-sized portions.  I did use the extra beef broth that others suggested (8 cups) since when I put the barley directly into the soup to cook, the barley would have soaked up a lot of the existing broth.  I also added an 8-ounce can of tomato sauce.  I added some thyme, basil, oregano and a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  Made the entire thing in my 18-quart electric Nesco roaster.  It took 12 hours all in all (including cooking the beef first).  I put the barley in 30 minutes before the soup was done.  Thanks, Margo!

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and crocked all but the barley and bay leaf all day, for simplicity's sake. I've made it twice now with rave reviews each time, this is definitely a keeper. Thanks for posting!

After reading the other reviews, I made the recipe exactly and altered it afterwards.  I wanted to see what it was like the way it was written.  I found it quite bland and very thick.  I added 1 pkg. of Lipton Onion Soup Mix with 3 cups of water, 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. basil, 1/4 tsp thyme powder, 2 tsp. worchestershire sauce, and some black pepper (probably about 1/4 tsp).  Next time I would cut the meat up beforehand.  I also would use less meat - probably about half the amount.  It was more like a stew and yet not as good as a stew because of the "soupy" nature and because the meat was strings instead of cubes.  I would try it again with some alterations, but I also would just add everything into the crock pot after the meat was cooked instead of using two pots.

Excellent!  I felt the recipe needed a little more barley.  I also added a couple potatoes and shredded another to thicken the soup.

I didn't have time for a slow cook meal, so I did it stove top. I doubled the stock and barley and left out the frozen mixed vegetables. I sauted the meat, then the onion, carrots and celery and then dumped in the rest of the ingredients. Also added some garlic. Fabulous. As it is written there are far too many veg, not enough broth or barley.

Very good, I did tweak a bit though. 1) I cubed and browned the chuck after trimming most of the fat to make it healthier. 2) I used canned veggies except for corn, because that is what was handy. 3) I did not add sugar, and did not miss it.  I did not add beef bouillon, or water, as I used fat free beef broth instead.  4) I used more beef broth (about 4 cans), which I am glad I did since otherwise this would have been a stew, and I prefer soups. Tossed everything in after I browned the beef in a pan, and let it go for about 6 hours (4 on high, 2 on low).  I really enjoyed this though, and will make it again for sure!

This recipe always turns out well, and it's one of my favorites to make and freeze to have on hand when I don't have time to cook. I do cook the meat first in the slow cooker, then chill the juices in order to skim off all the fat; return the beef juices back to the soup. Also, I substitute 3 cans (or more) of low-sodium beef broth for the water & bouillon. I liked the suggestion from others who added Worcestershire; I used about 2 teaspoons. Good comfort food!

I read the reviews and decided to use 2 lbs. cubed stewing meat.  I put everything into the slow cooker except the barley and bay leaf.  I also put in 2 med. size potatoes and 1 tbsp worchestire sauce.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of peas and 1 cup of green beans (frozen) instead of the mixed veggies.  I Have a 4 quart slow cooker, the soup was right to the top and was bubbling over a few times.  I cooked this on high because it seemed to take hours to get going.  I left it on high for approx. 7 hours.  If you have a huge slow cooker and there is lots of room leftover then I would cook this on low for around 5 hours.  I think I need the 6 quart cooker now so I can increase the size of this soup, it is excellent according to my family, and I think so to.  Served warm buns with it.

This is a special recipe ! I make a swiss steak the day before, sauteeing it in flour and covering it with stewed tomatoes and a can of golden mushroom soup). I cook that in an electric skillet all day and when it's done, I take a moderately large piece off of it and save to make this soup the next day ! I , too use beef broth and water with 1 bouillon cube per cup. Tomatoes and green chilis are wonderful and all the spices you love ! We eat this in bread bowls and sprinke the top with fresh parmesan. Lovely , nutritious and ever so satisfying !

This was the easiest meal I've ever made!
I cut up the chuck along with all the veggies, threw them in the crockpot, and cooked for 12 hours.  I added the barley the last hour of cooking.  YumYum!  Must serve with cornbread!
I did omit the oil; I didn't miss it.

Very good! Healthy and Filling! I did this all in the crockpot...did the meat first ( a steak that needed to be used up and some venison pieces) About the last 2 hours, I added the barley and a can of mixed veggies. So mine was more like a stew, a ton of meat, and pretty cheap because I needed to use up that can of mix veggies. I chopped my meat into bite size pieces....steak will hold its shape in the crockpot and became real tender after 4-5 hours in the crockpot! Served with corn mufins...great Super Bowl meal!

I tried this recipe because it was a crock pot recipe and it was wonderful.  I have to say this WILL BE my vegetable soup recipe from now on. I had a friend's Mother pass recently and I took this to the funeral home for the family to snack on during the showing and everyone raved about this soup.  It's definitely an easy comfort food that seems like you've spent hours preparing.  The only thing I did different was added worchestershire sauce and sprinkled a steak seasoning to the stew meat while it was roasting.  The meat was so tender and falling apart.  Also I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used petite diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, they worked perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent soup, but following other reviews I did change it a little bit!!!
I used Angus Beef already cubed in place of the chuck.  I did not use the frozen vegetables, but used 3 small potatoes cubed with the skins on, 3 small parsnips chopped, handful green beans chopped, handful of peas, 1 medium onion, 3 stalks celery, and 3 carrots.  I sauted the vegetables for about 5 minutes before throwing all ingredients (apart from the barley) into the crock pot.  During the last hour, I added the barley.  Cooked for 8 hours in total.  This was so delicious, my family loved it!

This was excellent!  I made some changes because of time and ingredients.  First off, I made this on the stove.  I used beef broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I added more carrots and celery, and some cubed potato.  I did not use the frozen mixed veggies, but I did add about 1/2 a bag of frozen green beans towards the end.  The taste of this soup was really good, and it was really hearty.  It's a little time consuming, cutting the meat and chopping the veggies, but it was worth every second!

This soup was a hit with my kids, who never were big fans of vegetable soup.  Even my 13-year-old had a 2nd helping!  I used a 3# roast but probably could have reduced to a 2# and also added beef broth since I like my soup less thick.  Very nice blend of flavors and makes plenty.

fabulous recipe! i put all of the ingredients i want into a pot (2-2.5 lbs. cubed chuck roast or beef stew meat, pkg frozen mixed vegetables, 2-3 cubed potatoes, chopped onion, chopped stewed tomatoes or diced tomatoes, bay leaf...), and i add 1 cup barley about 45-60 minutes before serving. as suggested by others, make sure to double the beef broth if you plan on increasing the amount of barley in the recipe - 8 cups water & 8 beef bouillon cubes. i highly recommend adding more barley! i put everything into a pot because it cooks a lot faster (about 3 hours) and i'm a stay-at-home mom who is able to watch it. on the stove or in a crockpot, this is a delicious soup. everyone loves it, even kids!

Thanks for a wonderful recipe Margo! My family loved it. I did cook the roast first in my crockpot with a can of beef broth and left out the bay leaf. Also I didn't use the carrots since they came in the bag of frozen veggies that I bought. I precooked the barley and added to the soup later so as to not soak up the juice. This made alot of soup and I was able to freeze a bowl for another time. Will definitely make this recipe again. Oh yeah, I also added 2 tsps. of worchestire sauce to the soup too.  Delicious!!!

I made this to use up some leftover pot roast, so I went about this a little differently.  First I cooked the barley in beef broth.  Then I sautéed the carrots, celery and onion for about five minutes in about 1 T. of oil.  I added beef broth (rather than the water and bouillon), the bay leaf, tomatoes and black pepper.  I simmered this until the veggies were tender, and then added the cubed pot roast and the cooked barley.  At this point my soup looked pretty chunkie, so I opted not to add the frozen mixed vegetables.  Very good!  And a great way to use up all my leftover pot roast!  I will be making this one again!

Deserves 5 stars for ease and flavor.  When I made this, however, I did some alterations based on what I had available and some preferred cooking methods (reduced recipe in half).  Used 1.25 pds beef stew meat.  Browned each piece till it had a roasted look to it, then dumped them in slow cooker.  Sliced a humongo onion up into 1/2 inch pieces and using same pan, sauteed those until golden, added to slower cooker.  Cut up 2 large fresh carrots (oblong shapes), 2 stalks of celery (regular 1-4 inch slices), and 2 large russet potatoes (peeled and one inch cubes), 4 smashed cloves of garlic, and added to pot.  Used 2 cups of cartoned, low sodium beef broth.  Cooked on low for 4 hours; tasting good.  Added about 1 cup frozen corn and 1 cup frozen peas and the remainder of the broth in the carton, and heated it hot again.  It looks colorful and taste great.  Its a soup, not a stew...decided to not add any tomatoes or flour to thicken.  Just a simple beef and vegetable soup.  Did not add sugar because I didn't use canned tomatoes.  Barley would be awesome, but I used potatoes and so no barley in this batch.  Next time :)  I believe the key to my good soup was browning the meat and the onions before they went into the slow cooker.  Would have done the carrots too, but I got lazy.  Slicing them into oblong shapes, like one inch pencil pieces?...made for nice visual contrast.  Pretty...and tasty.  :)

Yum - this is a winner! I followed reviewers advice and threw everything into the crock pot except for the barley, cooking it on high for five hours, adding the barley during the last hour. I left out the frozen vegetables, adding a few more carrots and a can of corn instead. I also added thyme, basil, oregano and about 1 T. of soy sauce to give it more flavor. Up the barley to 3/4 cup (1/2 is too little and 1 is too much). With these changes it's fabulous.

We had this soup last night for Sunday supper. Incredibly good! Instead of the two step process and changing pans we slow cooked the meat as called for in the recipe and then added the rest of the ingredients to the crockpot about two hours before it was supposed to be done and it worked out just fine. We did add more water to make it "soupier" and added a splash of red wine. With a glass of wine and a good sour dough bread a very yummy and filling meal!  Thanks Margo!

Man was this great.  I added 2 cans of new potatoes, 1 tsp each thyme and oregano, and 2 Tbs worchestershire. I was a little leery about adding the barley in with the beef, it seemed too dry in the crock pot to soften the barley up. But it was fine, the meat gave off enough liquid to do the trick. The soup was thick and had a nice steaky taste, better than most I've had in restaraunts. So great to know how to make it at home now! A wonderful recipe.

Like everyone else, I changed a few things to use what I had on hand. I cubed a round steak instead of using a roast. I put everything in the slow cooker except the barley and cooked it all day. I added the barley about 1 hour before serving time.  Fresh turnip and cabbage adds a nice flavour. Another trick of mine is to save the water when I boil potatoes. I added potato water instead of the water in the recipe. It adds more flavour and vitamins.

This soup was perfect tonight! I used 1.5 lbs of beef shank instead of beef chuck. It was what I had on hand at the time plus my family was sick. I seasoned the shank with hawaiian sea salt and black pepper and seared in a pot with a 2T of olive oil. I was looking for a dark brown coloring on the meat for both sides. I added 4 cans of beef broth and simmered for about 4 hours. I omitted the sugar, beef bouillon cubes, water, stewed tomatoes, and frozen vegetables. After 4 hours of simmering the beef shank and it was tender, I took it out and set it aside. I added fresh vegetables using 4 carrots, chopped, half a zucchini and celery, diced, half of an onion, chopped, 2 garlic cloves and 1 bay leaf to the pot. I cut up the beef and added it back in the pot along with the broth and vegetables. An hour before serving, I added 1/2 cup of pearl barley. Everything seemed to come together nicely so I removed the bay leaf. It was then that I seasoned it again. I added frozen sweet peas, turned off the stove, covered it with a lid. The soup was so flavorful and comforting! Just salt, black pepper, garlic, and the flavors from the beef bones all add to the wonderful tasty soup. The meat is fork tender and melts in my mouth. The vegetables are soft and the barley cooked perfectly! Since I didn't use the cooking method intended in this recipe I rated this 4 stars, otherwise it would have been a 5 stars. I serve with, "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread," also from this website.

Wonderful! I doubled the broth added some extra spice (parsley, basil, and a small amount of chilli powder) I used corn instead of the mixed veggies and added a small can of diced green chilis.

Good, but not great.  Tasted more like polish gulumpke with out the cabbage.  Was actually thinking that if I make it again, I will add shredded cabbage.  Also, the barley soaks up all of the liquid and you have to add alot more.

What caught my attention about this recipe was cooking the meat first in a slow cooker.  I said to myself, now why didn't I think of that? But then I'm thinking why go to a pot on the stove, why not cook it all in the slow cooker?  So, I did.  I cooked the meat for several hours first and then added the other things the recipe called for. I did add potatoes, green beans, corn and lima beans instead of the mixed vegetables. It turned out wonderfully. A nice recipe for a cold snowy day!

This was a very flavorful, hearty stew. I cut up the meat before putting it in the crockpot. I was concerned there wouldnt be enough broth for the barley to cook in, but there ended up being plenty produced by the meat. I added more beef broth than called for, and rather than simmering it all on the stove, put it all in the crockpot on high for approx. 30 mins. at the end. I will definitely make this recipe again.

We enjoyed this soup last night.  Now that the temperature here in the "Windy City" has dropped, it was welcomed.  I only had frozen peas to add (vs. mixed veges) but nobody seemed to notice.  Next time I'll double the broth as the barley seemed to consume alot of it.  Thanks Margo, this hit the spot!

This soup is so good! This is a very hearty soup. I Will reduce the amount of veggies and increase the liquid next time. It has such a wonderful taste, thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe!  I made it in the crock pot and just threw everything in on high for five hours, but added the barley (quick-cooking) and salt in the last hour.  I thought it ended up a little too salty, so I'll cut back on that, but otherwise I will make this over and over again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

By far the best recipe for beef barley soup I've ever made! Hearty and flavorful- warms you up on a cold day! I added chopped green onions as well as yellow onions and 2 tsps. of a jar of liquid spices called sofrito and its delicious!

fabulous! however....per reviews i did add worcestire sauce, used fresh tomato instead of canned, 1.5 lb stew meat, did not sautee veggies, added 3 diced potatoes, 9 oz. corn instead of mixed frozen veggies, 4 cups beef broth instead of water/boullion, and 1.5 cups barley. i put EVERYTHING except salt and barley in a crockpot (low) for ~9 hrs (quite enough). per recommendations, i waited until 20 minutes before dinner time to add barley. nope; still VERY FIRM. turned pot up to high for another 25 minutes...still firm...i say after 9 hrs in pot on low add barley and turn up to high for 1 hr.; that's what worked for me....with these modifications it was DELIGHTFUL!!!! i will make this so many more times....

Good hearty soup! Perfect for cold winter evenings. I made a few changes, but nothing major. I used 2 lbs of stew meat, which I floured and browned first. I also used 2 cans of beef broth rather than the water and bouilon. I added 1 can to the browned meat and let that simmer till the meat was tender. I then added the sauteed veggies, 1 can stewed tomatoes and 1 8 oz can tomato sauce,barley and spices. I also added a few dashes of worchestishire sauce. Simmered on the stove for about 1 hour. Delicious!! My picky husband even gave it the thumbs up.*Update..My very finicky husband loved this soup so much that I didn't get any of the leftovers!! He ate it all!! WOW!! Truley a great recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.

I cut the recipe by half and used beef stew meat.  I did not use a crock pot (since I don't like beef that falls apart...like when cooked in a crock pot).  I browned the meat in a pot and removed them along with the juices.  I sweated chopped carrots/celery/onion in a the same pot, so I could get all the leftover brown bits.  I then added the barley, beef with juices, canned tomatoes (juice included), frozen corn, a teaspoon of Italian seasoning, 1 cup water, 1 can beef broth and let everything simmer for 45-60 minutes or until the barley was done.  This turned out very hearty and tasty.  I liked how the stew meat kept its form and had some texture still.  Will make this again.

I felt 3 lbs of meat was too much for this size recipe, so reduced it to half.  Also excess fat needs to be trimmed.  

There is no need to saute frozen veg so those were added last. Need to specify NOT quick cooking barley (I don't use it, but it's the reason others had soggy barley.) It is MUCH better cooking all day.  Reheated is even better.  Also, leaving the bayleaf in all day til the end gave a better flavour (had to add one the second day because it wasn't enough per instructions given.)

Very tasty! After I cooked the meat according to the instructions, I threw it, along with all the other ingredients back into the crock pot and cooked it all for 5 more hours on low. The only downside to this was that it got too thick. I had to add 2 extra cups of beef broth. Delicious!

INCREDIBLE & BEAUTIFUL!!! I have been making the same vegie-beef stew for 4 years, and it was always good, but I will never make it again! The beef in this soup was very tender and delicious. I didn't have any barley, so I omitted that and used 2 medium cubed potatoes instead. Instead of frozen, I used canned corn, green beans, and peas.  I halved the amount of stewed tomatoes (husband doesn't like them), and it was perfect. Also, I like more broth in my soup, so I added 2 cups of water and 2 cubes of bouillion.  Served with cornbread. Could not have been better, and the colors made a beautiful presentation!

Loved this!  Used the beef and juice from the Easy Slow Cooker French Dip (which is also on this site) and added some red wine and chicken broth, herbs and seasonings.  Cooked the barley separately. Sautéed the vegetables(added broccoli, mushrooms, onions, garlic & a little lite soy sauce). Added the barley and vegetables to the meat and broth mixture with some finely chopped cabbage, raw carrots, broccoli slaw just long enough before serving to get them all hot but so that each vegetables & barley would still have a good texture and separate flavor.  Thanks for this recipe Margo.  This recipe stands on its own and doesn’t need any changes.  I just used what I had and it was still delicious!

All around, this recipies was pretty good.  My husband LOVED it.  I did not use a slow cooker and I used left over roast beef from our dinner the night before.  It was a fantastic way of using up the left overs.  The meat was very tender and the soup had a nice flavor.  It is a very thick and filling soup, definetly to be served as a meal at dinner.  I will probably make this soup again with leftover meat again, I really don't think it would be worth the time to cook a whole roast just for the soup.

Very good soup. It was a hit at our church's Family Night Supper!
I trimmed, boned and cut the roast into bite size pieces before slow cooking. This shortened the cooking time.

Absolutely delicious!  Everyone tweaks it to their liking, here's what I did!  I browned 1.5 lbs of stew beef, half an onion and tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  Then I made 2 cups of wylers beef boullion/2 cubes and threw it all in the crock pot and set it to high.  I also added pepper, half the can of stewed tomatoes and two chopped up garlic cloves.  I cooked it for about 3 hours adding another dash of Worcestershire in between and the bay leaf.  I cut up all the veggies, 4 carrots, 4 celery stalks, 1/4 cabbage, handful of green beans and broccoli, no frozen veggies.  I sauted them all in 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil for about 6 mins and prepared another 4 cups of wylers beef boullion. I fished out the stewed tomatoes that didn't fall apart, cut them up and threw everything in the crock.  I also threw in half a fresh jalapeño, another bay leaf and a whole garlic and a cup of pearled barley.  This soup is so yummy had to write my review!  Thank you for the recipe!

Absolutely the best vegetable beef soup I have ever made!!  I stayed pretty true to the recipe.  I had a hot grill available the night before I was going to make this soup, so I seasoned the chuck roast with salt & pepper and seared it on both sides on the grill.  I placed the roast in the bottom of the crock pot and added all ingredients except the barley and placed in refrigerator overnight.  I left the carrots & celery in larger chunks so they would not break down.  I placed the crock in the pot and set it to low before going to work the next morning. When I got home about 9½ hours later, I removed the chuck (it was in 4 large pieces) and added the barley.  While the barley was cooking, I shredded the beef.  It was cooked perfectly, fork tender and moist, but not falling apart and the vegetable in the larger chunks were tender without disintegrating.  I added the beef back to the pot and dinner was ready!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

As recommended by other reviewers, I used stew meat that I cut into smaller pieces. I cooked the soup for 10hours on low, added the barley, then accidentally left the crock on warm overnight. It still tasted superb! I also added a dash of Worcestershire.

I am just about to do the final 20 minutes of cooking and all I have to say is that even if this is the best tasting soup to ever cross my lips it will never be made again.  It was far too much work and the measurements too vague... what size carrot/celery/onion (1 cup worth, 2 cups??????)   Plus, I shouldn't need a slow cooker AND giant stock pot to make a soup.  Wow, took a quick taste test for salt and pepper, totally overwhelmed by tomatoe now I see why the sugar! Sorry.

I followed other reviewers and put everything in a crockpot at once but added the barley (doubled amount) during the last hour. I also added cubed potatoes at the beginning. I would have given this more stars if the recipe called for more seasoning. I didn't follow the advice of others who suggested adding thyme and oregano but I wish I did. Otherwise this a good, hearty soup.

This was fantastic. I did throw everything in to cook all day, save for the barley - which I threw in about 90 minutes before we ate. (Hubby was 30 minutes late home from work.)   I also removed the salt completely and replaced with a couple teaspoons of cayenne pepper and a splash of Worcestershire Sauce. It gave it a really nice flavor and kick. This was also even better as leftovers!

I thought soup was excellent.  Two suggestions:  when adding the barley to the crockpot, add some hot broth, at least a cup - that way the barley doesn't soak up the fat from the roast.  I let the barley mixture sit in the fridge overnight and was able to take all of the fat off the top once it solidified.  I would also use diced tomatoes, just because my husband doesn't like whole tomatoes, and also I needed to add more water and bouillion, otherwise it would have been porridge like.  Fantastic recipe, will make again for sure.  I used pearl barley, but my uncle told me I should have used pot barley, anyone else have a recommendation?  The recipe makes a lot, I have 3 containers that I have frozen for quick meals at a later date.

This is SOOOO good!  Its a shame that we've been having an Indian summer here in Jersey.. this is the perfect fall soup!  And its really more like a stew..nice and thick..sticks to the ribs!  I made this in my crock pot.  I used a large can of Beef Broth instead of bouillon.. the broth measured to about 5 cups, so I upped the barley to 1 cup.  I didn't have a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, so I subbed some frozen peas which worked out really great.  I used stew meat instead of the roast and it was just fine.  I also added the barley in at the very beginning and it wasn't mushy at all.   I set my crock pot on high for 7 hours and it turned out just perfect.  I will definitely make this again.. especially when its nice and chilly out!

This is an exceptional soup! Very easy as well as delicious.  I have made this soup several times now and my family never tires of it.  I do use beef broth instead of the water and bouillon, and do not bother with the additional vegetables, as the frozen ones are sufficient and makes the recipe even easier.  Serve with a loaf of crusty bread!

This is a great tasting recipe we'll be making for years to come.  I added all the ingredients listed at the beginning, turned the crockpot on low, and let it go until I got home in the evening (about 11 hours).  I removed the bayleaf, skimmed the fat off the top, and shredded the beef and put it back in the pot.  The soup was still pretty greasy, so next time (time permitting) I'd like to cool it completely before shredding the meat, and pull the fat off the top when it is solidified.

Delicious!  I had never made a beef soup from scratch, and this was relatively easy and VERY tastey!
My 2 young brothers-in-law LOVED it.

WOW!!  Next time I will increase the both by 1-2 cups. It was FANTASTIC - even better the second day. Great way to use up all those left over small bags of frozen veggies in the freezer.

This is awesome. I make some changes... I throw the meat into a crockpot, add all the veggies and broth.... everything except the barley. Then I cook it on low for about 9 hours. Turn the crockpot off, add the barley, replace the lid and let it sit for another hour... PERFECT everytime! I also add a lot of crushed red pepper flakes on top of the meat and this gives it a lot of spice, which we like.

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now.  This is the best Fall meal anyone has ever devised.
I cannot believe the requests I've gotten for this the last couple of years.

This is, quite possibly, the best soup ever created.  I put a touch more barley in it and make it more of a stew, but still  alot of liquid.  
Oh, my God, thank you to the original maker of this soup.  It's become a staple on Super Bowl Sunday for us.  And, I make it just about now, late October, to tease our friends and family. 

This is just a great meal, and thank you, whoever posted it first.  It's the best.

This was excellent!  It took time to cook and certainly filled a 6-quart slow cooker to the top!  Very nice for a crowd or when leftovers are desired.  I did make a few changes, based on what was on hand:  used leftover beef which had been cooked in a sauce on the sweet side so did not add sugar nor oil; used 1 c. barley and added 4 cups additonal beef broth; added fresh thyme sprigs and used 2 bay leaves.  Definitely a keeper!

Has a wonderful sweet taste.  I could hardly believe when my 2 year old asked for seconds!!  Very hearty and filling.  You'll want to freeze some because it makes a lot.  And be sure not to omit the barley, it really makes this dish.

I got rave reviews from the family when serving this soup!  I followed the method of dumping all ingredients, except for the barley and salt into the crock pot, then adding barley and salt at the end until cooked.  Wonderful!

This is a great base recipe . I followed the stovetop directions. I browned the cubed chuck roast and seasoned it with Emeril's Essence , fresh ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce. When the meat was browned I added a 1/2 cup of burgundy wine and deglazed the pot and let it cook with the meat until the liquid is reduced by about half. This is a great step to do to add real flavor to the soup. No need to remove the meat from the pot , just add in the veggies and go ahead with the rest of the directions. I added garlic, and didn't use the water or bouillon- used 5 (14 ounce)  cans of beef broth instead. Also added 1 tsp dried oregano and 2 tsp dried basil .  When I added in the frozen mixed veggies also threw in some fresh minced parsley.This was so flavorful and the family loved it. Will make again for sure.

Excellent recipe - I followed the advice of other reviewers and used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed and beef broth instead of water. I also omitted the frozen mixed vegetables and put everything into the crock pot right from the start.  Definitely a keeper - the family loved the barley.  Thank you, Margoc.

This is our favorite soup - I use stew meat and throw everything in the crock pot. (I will add extra veggies if I have them on hand - potatoes, rutabagas, etc)  Make some fresh bread and we have a favorite meal for the cold Wisconsin nights!

This is a very good base soup...I used 4 cups of beef broth instead of cubes & water, used stew meat chunks, add frozen green beans, and baby bella mushrooms. Cooked for 4 hours on high in crock pot. I also doubles the barley which I added the last half hour. Easy and a nice warm supper!

Brilliant! I made a few changes (which I never usually do):

1. Took the advice of of another reviewer and seasoned the meat with s&p, then browned the meat first in a skillet with the onion and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce

2. After meat was brown, threw all the ingredients in the pot together and covered them with water (instead of just 1 cup of water). I did add the barley separately though.

3. Omitted the stock cubes and oil

4. Added 5 bay leaves

5. Added 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder

It looks like a lot of changes, but because I left out the stock cubes, I had to compensate them with stronger flavours in other areas. I ended up adding quite a lot of salt and pepper to make up for the absence of the cubes.

Anyway, it's a fantastic recipe, and lasted me 4 days

I'm reviewing even w/my few changes so I'll remember what I did! I had a couple largish chunks of leftover pot roast I cubed up to use (added toward end). Omitted the pkg of frz veg but added some frnz peas and 3 small peeled/cubed potatoes. My carrots & potatoes got roasted in 275 oven (it was already in use). Used 1 sm can tomato sauce vs stewed tomatoes. I used 3 C of my own beef stock + 2 cups water. I scaled this to 5 servings but used entire bay leaf + some additional dried herbs (rosemary, parsley, oregano, thyme). No bouillion cubes or sugar. 1/2 recipe calls for 1/4 C barley but I used 1/2 C of reg pearl barley (not quick cooking) which I added to slow cooker (low) during last 2 hours. Very easy to change around a little for your own pref or using what's on hand. I also added 3 cloves of roasted garlic I mashed into a paste and stirred in. Was good first day...even better the next! Had enough to freeze for a another time since I cook for two. Very easily adaptable and yummy soup.

LOVED IT!  I did take advice from other reviewers and used stew meat, replaced water & bullion with beef broth and skipped the sugar.  Also put everything in at once and cooked for 10 hours on low, adding pearl barley an hour before it was done. The flavor was amazing and I will be making this again and again.  It was so easy!  i was a little concerned at how thick it was, but it was perfect.

Exactly what I was looking for--yum!  I made the stove top version (about 3 hours total), and the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the recipe needs more liquid or it's more of a stew.  Here are a few things I did for ease and preferences:

cut up chuck roast, brown in olive oil add onion, garlic & celery & cook 2 min.  add everything else but barley

omit frozen veggies--add cubed potato & extra carrots

less sugar ( only 1/2 tsp.)

7 cups beef broth

2  14 oz cans diced tom. (1 diced w/garlic & olive oil)

1 tsp. worsesteshire

add barley 1 hour out--perfect!

Scrumptious :)  I too put everything except the barley in the crockpot at once and cooked it on low overnight for 9 hours.  Then I added the barley for another hour of cooking and removed the bay leaf.  My roast was even frozen!

I added everything to the crock pot all at the same time, like other reviewers did. Lima beans, kidney beans, carrots, green beans, celery, peas, corn, the works!  I "set it and forget" it on low for about 12 hours or so...and wow!  Awesome soup! Definitely add the barley during the last hour and it'll turn out great!

I absolutely loved this soup. The beef was fall-apart, melt-in-your mouth tender. The flavor was excellent. I had hoped to make this last a week, but my husband and I inhaled it in two days. I followed the advice of other reviewers and put all the ingredients (except the barley) together and cooked for 8-10 hours on low and tossed in the barley in the last 15-20 minutes. DELICIOUS!

After reading several reviews, I made a few changes to the original recipe as well.  I used stew meat (cut into bite size pieces), lightly floured, salt & pepper, & browned it, then simmered in 4 cups of beef stock for 1 hour.  I then added 4 more cups of beef stock and added carrots, celery, onion, potato, seasoned salt, pepper, worcestershire sauce, italian seasoning, garlic, 28 oz fire roasted diced tomotoes, 1 cup spagetti/pizza sauce and simmered on the stove top for two more hours. after that I added 1 cup of barley, fresh cut green beans and 1 bay leaf and simmered 1 more hour.  I added a couple cups of water at that point to thin it out. It came out great - my 5 year old even ate it.  Next time I'd add less barley (personal preference - seems to take over the soup once it was cooked).  Great recipe!

I used this recipe only as a starting point.Read many reviews and borrowed from them.Used cubed stew meat, and cut it up into bite sized pieces. Then dredged them in flour, sea salt, and fresh ground pepper, sauteed it in a little oil. I also sauteed the onion in the same pan as the meat. I used 4 cans of beef broth low sodium, and two cans of Red gold stewed tomatoes with garlic, and oregano. I did not drain them. I cut up a half bag of baby carrots, three stalks of celery. I also added a small box of frozen corn. I had a field day with the spices. I added a tablespoon of soy sauce, and dark brown sugar. A pinch of celery salt, basil,oregano, and thyme.
No time for the slow cooker so used a stock pot on top the stove. Simmered all but the barley and bay leaf for about 2 hours. Then the last hour I added the pearl barley and bay leaf, and simmered for another hour. It turned out great!

This is one of the best soups ever with a few revisions.  I used beef broth instead of water, I pureed a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano instead of stewed tom. Turns out perfect everytime.  You can add an extra can of beef broth if you like it more soupy

I wanted to make this soup but I didn't have a chuck roast (I did have stew meat) and didn't feel like pulling out my crock pot then a soup pot, so I just made it all on the stove top instead. I also used beef broth instead of boullion cubes.

I cooked the cubed beef in some beef broth on top of the stove until tender, then followed the directions for the remainder of the soup. It came out great. My whole family loved it and I will for sure make again. I think next time though for a little "kick" I will use a can of chopped tomatos with green chilis in it instead of the regular stewed tomatoes. Oh, and I also added some fresh garlic into the soup, I can't cook without garlic :)

Thanx for the recipe..will be making it again!

Fantastic! I made this the other day to rave reviews! Followed the recipe pretty much except for just a couple of things. I used beef stock in place of water & boullion, and I found it needed 5 cups of stock rather than 4. Also, I used 3 lbs. of beef stew meat; it was a lot faster than starting out with a chuck roast. And, I added my barley right from the start. Other than those minor changes, I followed the rest to the letter and got wonderful results. The soup was hearty and delicious! Served it with a loaf of crusty bread... YUMMY!

I really liked this soup & it was easy to make. I only used a 2lb chuck roast that I seasoned with garlic, salt, & pepper and 1 cup of beef broth. I let it cook on high in the crock pot for 3 hours or so.  Then I followed the recipe as is, but used chopped tomatoes instead of stewed and tons of spices. Will definately make again;

I altered this a bit and it was absolutely fantastic!  My husband doesn't like cooked veggies so I was afraid that he wouldn't like it, but he loved it! 

I cooked this on top of the stove for several hours.  First, I left out the frozen veggies.  I used 3 lbs of stew meat (did not brown) instead of the roast.  I increased the broth using 4 cups of ready-to-use Swanson's Beef Broth, 1 10.5 oz can of Campbells Beef Broth double-strength (did not dilute), and one 14 oz can of Swanson Lower Sodium beef broth.  I also increased Barley & used 2 cups of Quick Cooking Barley during the last 20 mins.   A keeper!

Very good! I cooked my chuck roast in 2 cans beef broth with some garlic cloves & bay leaf in the slow cooker. I did not think there would be enough liquid to cook the barley later if I put the meat in the slow cooker dry! Afterwards I only added 2 cups water & 2 boullion cubes (instead of 4) when I put it all together. Added green beans & peas instead of mixed veggies. A keeper!

Real comfort food.  Very versatile dish.  I think that any minor changes that are made to suit your taste will still come out great.  It's just a good basic recipe.  Changes that I made... added more beef broth, more barley and a little red wine.  I also added everything in the crock pot at the beginning except for the barley which I added one hour before it was done (after 5 hours or so). Delish!!

This is a great recipe. I was hestitant to put the meat in the crock pot with no additional seasoning or liquid but trusted the previous reviewers. I put mine on low and was gone for a long day. I was a little concerned when I got home and the meat was rather dark so I turned off the crock pot and added some leftover sparkling grape juice into the pot while I chopped vegetables. I discovered I was out of onions and forgot to buy the barley but I decided to keep going. I cooked some elbow macaroni and added them in at the last few minutes. Wow, delicious. I sopped up the last broth with a roll. When I was putting up the leftovers, it smelled so delicous I wanted another bowl but I was full. Highly recommended. Next time I am going to put in the barley and onion and it will be even better. Thanks.

This is one of the most delicious soups I have ever made.  I like it because it is high in fiber and nutrients and low in fat if a lean cut of meat is used. I used leftover London broil (thick top round steak) that I had grilled the day before.  I cut it into bite size pieces and put in crock pot with 2 cans low sodium, fat free beef broth. I  sauteed onions and mushrooms before adding to broth. I did not use frozen vegetables but added carrots, potatoes, undrained canned green beans, canned crushed tomatoes.  After simmering for 6 hours, I added a can of creamed corn and the barley and cooked for another 90 minutes.  The beef was so tender and the soup so thick it was a meal all by itself.  If you like you soup thinner, just add addtional liquid-either water or broth. Thanks for the nutritious, delicious recipe!

A shortcut to this recipe is to use your pot roast leftovers from  dinner. The slow cooked beef flavor, the seasoning, the carrots and potatoes and onions, are all there already, with their fantastic slow-cooked flavor. Just add barley (and necessary liquid for it to cook in),tomatoes, and add additional frozen vegetables like peas or mixed veggies. Instead of sauteeing celery, you can sprinkle in celery seed. Simmer according to directions on the barley. This is a no-sweat supper for sure!

This was delicious. I used stew meat, beef broth, and less barley. I threw everything in the crockpot. Added the barley and veggies about 2 hours before it was done.

I am a self learner when it comes to cooking.  This my friends is a no brainer.  Let me explain what I did.  The meat I used was some sort of chuck stuff that was precut into chunks at the supermarket.  (I'm an idiot when it comes to cuts of beef) I put everything into a slow cooker except for the barley and programed it on low and walked away.  A few hours later, I returned to semi cooked meat which I took out and cut them into little tiny peices becasue I didnt want it to be like a stew. I noticed the meat was very dry and tough and thought I used the wrong cut of meat...but boy was I wrong!  2 hours before it was finished, I doubled the amount of barley and sprinked that in.  You'll notice this soup is very watery and thin when its finished.  Never make this soup to eat that day unless thats how you like your beef barley consistancy.  I put it in the fridge when the barley was cooked and the next day noticed how thick and yummy this soup came out.  The beef was soooo tender!  It needs a lot of salt I think.  But be careful when you add it and taste test every time you add it.  I used low sodium beef broth instead of those cube things...and I also omitted celery and added 2 potatoes cut up really small. I hope this helps new cooks.

Made it for 50 people at work and WOW was it great! (One guy had 4 helpings!) Used italian style tomatoes, boxed beef broth, diced stew meat and canned green chilies for ease.  15 people asked for the recipe including my boss!  Left overs are even better.  Definite keeper and will make it again and again.  Thanks Margo!!!!

This was a wonderful, flavourful soup!  I used 2 lbs of stewing meat and threw everything in the crock pot.  I only had a 19oz can of tomatoes (which I whizzed with my hand blender), and added half a can of tomato sauce to make up for it.  The soup was rich and hearty, and was perfect for a cold night.  I think I'll add more barley next time, but other than that, no changes necessary.  Great recipe.

Yummy!  Great to beat the chill that's beginning to fill the night air.  I skipped the celery (didn't have any) and used fresh corn and green beans instead of the frozen veggies.  I also doubled the beef broth.  Instead of the stewed tomatoes I used some of the freezer tomato sauce I had just made (it's kind of like a homemade v8 juice) using fresh tomatoes and various veggies from my garden.  I also added a dash soy sauce along with some thyme.  Definate "do again".

Great hearty soup.  I do make modifications depending upon what is in my fridge.  I never add celery - do not like.  I usually add potatos, corn, or squash.  Also a bit of worcheshire.  I always add extra broth since the barley seems to soak it up.  My very pickey toddler even eats it.

This was just like Mom's. I added shredded green cabbage, extra boullion and some extra water.  It was still thick, more like a stew.  Just how I like it.

I REALLY liked this recipe!  I cooked the meat as directed then took it off the bone.  Put all the other goodies back in the crockpot and cooked it on low for another 4 hours.  Deepened the flavor.  I will surely make this over and over again!  Thanks Margo!

i wanted so much to love this recipe. I used beef broth as recommended. The soup was good but it was missing something. It was satisfying to all and filling but everyone added hot sauce to give it some flavor. I am at a loss for was to add next time around. I guess I will read more reviews for suggestions.

OVEN VERSION.  I needed to make a huge amount because the men in my family eat like football players so even my largest crockpot would have only lasted a day... maybe...LOL.... So I made it in my large Magnalite Dutch oven.  I put everything in at once except for the barley and salt, added lots of veggies, worcestershire sauce, baby Yukon potatoes and mushrooms, substituted the water for beef broth and covered it with two layers of foil and then put on the lid.  Placed it in the oven on 200 degrees for 5 hours before I even took a peak.  My house smelled marvelous!   Overall I let it cook about 6 hours on low in the oven then added the barley and salt and retuned it to the oven for another hour.  It turned out fabulous and hearty.  The beef was super tender and flavorful.  I think adding the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth really made a difference.  My football eating men love it because it's chocked full of stuff.... My son said it's not wimpy soup but a full meal...maybe there'll be some left in the morning for work.:-)

have this many times, love this on a cold winter day or evening, the only thing I do first is cut up stew meat, and add a little flour and brown the beef before putting in crock pot, 2nd change I use all fresh vegetables, 3rd use beef stock instead of water and bullion, tried it with the sugar this last time, and it did balance out the acidity of the tomato's, yummy! gonna make it all winter long, soooo gooood!!!!

My family LOVES this, and i feel good about it because of all the hidden veggies.  I chop the onion, celery, and extra carrots so they aren't as visible for the little kids.  Better than any pot roast dish we have ever had.  I add extra barley to make more like stew and it gives me more servings.  Thinking about adding shredded cabbage.

I have been making this soup for years.  I use stew meat also and put it all together from the beginning except for the barley.  I add that the last hour of cooking time. Very good soup.

I think this has the potential to be amazing. It's a little tasteless as it is, but more spices (especially some hot sauce) make it much better. And please, don't use frozen carrots and frozen celery!

I changed this just a bit but used all the same ingredients,first i floured 2.5lbs round steak in seasoned flour (s&p, montreal steak seasoning) browned it in a bit of oil added the chopped onion then a carton of beef stock, plus 3 cups water and 3 tbs beef bouillion powder.1 15 oz can tomato sauce. Brought that to boil reduced to simmer added a bag of frozen green beans, a bag of frozen sliced carrots and simmered for 20 min. (Our beef is locally grown and this one is very tender even the round steak). I added the potatoes about 20 minutes later and continued simmering til everything tender added a bag of frozen peas ten minutes before serving and heated through. Served with rolls. Thank you very much it was delish!!

Yummy. Like other reviewers said, the proportion of meat to the rest of the soup is pretty. It is delicious but I think for my budget I will decrease the amount of meat next time. I did cube the meat to cut down on cooking time and this worked out well. I also used a cheaper cut off beef and it worked out great. Great add leftovers but you will need more stock to replace the water absorbed by the barley.

I love this type of stew - very hearty, I make a lot of recipes that are variations on this recipe.  Instead of using frozen mixed vegetables, I use fresh carrots and tomatoes from the farmers market.  Also, I always add fresh parsley.

Delicious.  I used leftover roast and cooked everything on the stove top.  And, I used high quality beef stock (in lieu of the bouillon cubes and water).  The barley is fantastic - it was a rich, flavorful soup.

I made this soup for the first time today.I made it with a tenderized steak which i browned first then cut in up into small bite size peices, i threw everything else into the slowcooker, i used a carton of beef broth plus 2 cans of consume, i put a little over 1/2  cup of pearl barley in 2 hours  before it was done, i only had half a bag of frozen veggies left and i threw them in that was plenty enough, And for the taste it was wonderful!! I will be making this every couple of weeks or so!

Such a great recipe. Especially on a cold day! I used vegetable broth in substitution of 2 cups of the water. It was hearty and filling. Goes well with chibata rolls.

We love this soup in our house, it's a meal in itself.  With modifications as others have noted in comments, it's a 5.  Sub beef broth for the fake stuff noted.  Added an onion, some thyme, green beans, peas, you could really modify to suit your diet/family preferances.  I used pot barley instead of pearl, more nutrition.  Takes about just over an hour to cook.  WIth a nice homeade loaf of bread, you have a perfect meal.

I followed Happyhousewife's suggestions and she is right on having a pot full. However, that was exactly what I was looking for.  DH took some to work and when he heated it for lunch, several coworkeers asked if he'd bring in a copy of the recipe.  Happy to oblige!  This is delicious.  Even better heated up.  Served with hot homemade buttermilk biscuits one night and a homemade French baguette for another mealtime.  This warms the innards and comforts the soul and will be a regular on our winter menu!  Thank you for sharing!!

Delicious! I omitted the frozen veggies, doubled the celery and carrots, added an additional cup of water and 1 tsp of beef boullion. I also threw in about a cup of tomato sauce that I had leftover in the fridge. Like many others, I simply dumped everything in the slow cooker, except the barley, which I added 1/2 hr before the soup was done. I cooked on high for 5 1/2 hours. Will definitely make again!

Made this with stewing beef with great results.  Can anything with barley be bad?  I upped the quality!  I didn't put in the mixed veg, only frozen peas and canned corn.  Also used boxed beef broth rather than the cubes and water.  It was a lovely, comforting crockpot full of deliciousness.  CAUTION:  Do not use Instant Barley as it turns to mush and lacks the nutty flavor of real barley.

I am making the stove top version of this recipe as I type. It is still simmering and already the vultures (hubby and 2 boys) are circling and drooling.  The only thing I did differently was toss the beef in flour before browning, browns better and also thickens the soup a bit.  Also, I had a head of cabbage I needed to use up, so I shredded it and added it to the sauteeing carrots, onions, and celery.

This is a wonderful soup.  I did change it a little...I forgot to buy the mixed vegetables so I added more of the carrots and celery and put some corn in the mix that I had leftover.  I also added one teaspoon of thyme.  My notoriously picky father in law could not get enough...husband loved, I loved, kids loved...definite keeper.

meat was very tender and done in 8 hours on hi-did 3 lbs, doing in a chunk make it easy to trim off fat one hour before finished. made mistake of using fire roasted tomatoes w chilis so soup had a bite. would also try with beef broth next time instead of water and beef base. made at least 3 meals-full slow cooker!

This is hearty! The barley adds an excellent texture. Add the barley to the slow cooker as the recipe instructs (I added 3/4 cup, not 1/2 cup) and they plump in the beef stock and drippings. For added decandence, you can add 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream at the end!

The best!  I used a little over a pound of stew meat and just threw everything in the slow cooker (except for the barley, which I added during the last ½ hour) and cooked on low for 4 hours, then cooked on high for another 4 hours.  I added ½ tsp. each of dried basil, oregano and crushed rosemary and 2 cloves minced garlic.  I used a 32 oz. carton of beef broth and a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  By the time I had all this in the slow cooker, I literally had no room for the bag of frozen veggies, so I just left it out - didn’t miss it at all.  All of this added up to one of the most delicious soups I’ve ever made!  The one mistake I made was adding more than the ½ cup barley since so many reviewers suggested that.  It ended up soaking up all the liquid.  The ½ cup barley is plenty!

Superb!  I used chopped stew meat.  Threw everything in but barley ... also used 2 bay leaves.  Added the barley 45 min before it was done.  Cooked everything for about 8 hours.  Delicious!

This soup is hearty and delicious.  I browned the cubed-up beef first,and then put all ingredients except barley into the slow cooker.  I added about a cup of red wine, and took advice of the others:  doubled the broth, left out the sugar.  I love the nutritional punch of Kale so I chopped up some of that and threw it in (SOOOO good for you - I love when my kids eat it!)  I meant to add some sliced button mushrooms at the end but forgot.  Added non-quick cooking barley at the end for about a half hour.  It made just under 4 litres of soup.  Oh, and I also left out the packaged vegetables and just used the fresh ones (plus the kale).  Next time I think I will try a few splashes of Worchestershire sauce just for fun, not that it wasn't really good without it!  Even with doubling the liquid, it is a hearty almost stew-like soup.  You can afford to add more liquid if like, but I find it easier to feed to my kids when it's thicker like this.  Enjoy!

Very good soup. Makes alot, it almost did not fit in my crockpot. I agree with the other reviews to marinate the meat first I did not do that this time but will next time.

This was simply awesome.  I added spinach and a bag of frozen "stew vegetables" (carrots, onions, potatoes, celery) instead of fresh as thats what I had.  So good...

Great recipe on for a cold rainy day.  And it even tastes better after a couple of re-heats.

This came out just wonderful. I did use about 2 cups extra beef broth and also only used 2 boullion cubes. I added Worcestershire sauce, fresh diced potatoes, fresh carrots, frozen peas,corn& green beans.... oregano, basil, rosemary, a little onion & garlic powder, celery seed and 2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with 2 teaspoons water to make the consistancey more of a STOUP. Delicious!! Thanks for the starter recipe!

Very good soup.  The only thing different I will do in the future is usebeef broth/stock instead of the water and bouillon cubes.  The bouillon takes away from it a little.  My family really enjoyed the soup!!

Too many vegetables, not enough broth or barley.  A 2 lb. roast was way more than enough.  The flavor was good.  Like others, I would reduce the vegetables, increase the broth and add a few spices.  I will make this again with the modifications.

This was my first attempt at homemade soup and it came out really good!  I did double the amount of barley and added 2 more cups of broth.  I also used the Italian Stewed Tomatoes, which gave the soup a bit more seasoning.

This was really good.  I seasoned and seared the beef in a skillet, then put it in the crockpot with all ingredients except the barley on "low" for 10 hrs.  The last hour, I added the barley.  Very tasty!

Awesome recipe! Very good comfort food on a winter day! Only change was added about 1/2 cup or so of lentils, and added a bit of Italian seasoning to taste.

This was my first attempt at a vegetable soup/stew, and it turned out great!  I did modify the recipe a bit, by using beef broth, (~5-6 cups) omitting the sugar, and tossing everything in the crock pot on high, which made it super easy.  I also only used about a pound of cut-up stew meat, tossed with flour, and that was plenty.  I went out Christmas shopping, and five hours later, dinner was ready!  It was delicious with a loaf of honey oat bread from Panera.  The only problem is there's only two of us, and it made a whole crock pot full, so we had plenty of leftovers.

This was very good.  I think I'd cook the roast on low for a 8 hours.  I'll try that next time.  As a tip, I made this yesterday and it's much better today.  The meat got much more tender; probably because the tomatoes are acidic and broke down the fibers overnight.  This is a keeper.

This turned out to be the very best of vegetable beef soups.  I used a 2 pound
round roast with one cup of water and a beef bouillon cube in the slow cooker on
high for 5 hours.  Then I sauteed the onion, mixed vegetable,and carrots.  I did not use the celery because I had none.  My family said this was the best soup they ever had...and I agree.  Will definitely be a keeper. Thanks

Just a wonderful recipe when I followed the most helpful suggestions.  I had left-over au jus from prime rib last night, and added that.  What a great a addition this made!  I like others use beef broth in place of the cubes and water. I don't add the fresh celery or carrots.  I rely on the frozen veggies for that, and I don't put those and the barley in till the last 30 minutes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  6/29 The barley cooking in the crockpot is not working for me, it soaks up all of the juice.  I am going to cook it serpate from here on and hopefully that will work.

Excellent soup!  I don't know if it gets better the next day or not as my crew devoured it all in one sitting!  I was hoping for extras to try and freeze as I was testing new recipes to stock the freezer for upcoming school season.  This will not make the freezer list, but has become an instant family fav!

Excellent. Didn't have chuck so I bought an English roast and it was very good. I did use extra beef base for more flavor. I will keep this recipe and make again.
Tx so much :)

This is an amazing vegetable soup.  My family prefers this over all the others I have made.  I added my own choice of vegetables: frozen, sliced carrots, minced onion, frozen green beans, frozen corn, and frozen diced hash brown potatoes.  I used stew beef instead of the chuck roast, and I omitted the barley because my family doesn't like it.  This recipe is going to be a staple in my house.

This is the first time that I have taken the time to review a recipe.  This was a amazing soup and SO EASY!  I doubled the vegies because my family and friends are huge vegitable eaters, and added 2 cans of beef stock in addition to the recipe.  I had so much left over that I was sending it home with my guests!  This was big thumbs up from 5 picky adult eaters, and 5 children, including one who doesn't like meat!  This is going to become on my weekly rotation this winter!

This soup was great.  I cut up my meat first and cooked it in 1 cup of beef broth in the crock pot for 3 hours and added potatoes. I only used about 2 lbs of meat, but it turned out great.  We ate this for two nights(added more broth second night) and gave some to my parents too.

This is a good soup.  I had absolutely no idea how to cook the roast, since I rarely cook beef.  I put it in the crock pot, covered it with water, and cooked it for about 5 hours adding the barley in the last 45 minutes or so.  The meat came out extremely tender and pretty much fell apart.  The only hard part was getting the barley out of the water I cooked the roast in.

I omitted the celery, as I don't care for it.  I accidentally got pureed tomatoes instead of stewed, and I don't think it made a big difference.  I also added a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix for extra flavor.  This soup froze and reheated well.

I used stewing meat, but browned it first, used 1 cup of barley, about 14 oz. extra water, and about 5 heaping tablespoons of low-sodium beef bouillon.  Also used chopped tomatoes in juice, but next time, I'll only use 14 oz. (for my taste).  After browning meat and carrots, celery, and onion were sauted, I threw the works in the crock pot.  It was excellent.  My husband and I ate more than our share !  Will be making this a lot.

I followed the recipe to a T, except for substituting a cup of red wine for some of the water.  I was very disappointed with it the day of cooking--too thick, greasy--ugh. None of us enjoyed it.  HOWEVER, I refrigerated it overnight, skimmed the fat the next morning, and heated it up again.  WOW!  This was just a hundred times better the next day.  My kids wouldn't give it another chance but my husband and I loved it.  I will make it again but I will not eat it until day two or later!  Freezes well.

excellent recipe! I did half the recipe. I cubed the beef, and placed it in the crock pot along with 3 cups beef broth, 2 cans of V8 instead of the tomato, the onion, about 10 chopped baby carrots, (no celery), 1 tsp each oregano and basil, and about 1 tsp of worcestershire and a sprinkle of pepper. I let it cook on high for 4 hours then added partially cooked mixed veggies (so they weren't frozen),3/4 cup barley and the bay leaf. Let that cook for another 1 1/2 hours. The soup was incredible!! I will be making this ALOT!

Instead of going the crock pot route, I just bought an equal amount of beef strips for stir-fry, cut them in half and sauteed them with some olive oil, slowly until they were tender (I kept the lid on the pan).  Meanwhile I had cooked the barley, and added it to the cooking meat (which had now made some broth in the pan).  I added all of that to the already cooking soup, and simmered for a couple of hours.  It was awesome!

This was just great!  My wife & I need easy one-pot dinners on Tuesday nights.   This is definitely one of our Tuesday night recipes.  In that spirit, I added everything to the pot in the morning (as recommended by others) and it was a success.  My kids, 7 & 11, weren't real keen on this one, but they ate it (only way to get dessert!)  Sorry kids, you'll get this again.

I added 1 can of new potatoes(bite size)and 1/2 cup cooking wine. I also seasoned with tyme, basil, oregano, and Lea & Perrins.  The original recipe was a 5 star tasting recipe that was made even better with these additions.

I love, love, love this recipe.  I added a few cloves of garlic,  a couple of bay leaves, worcestershire sauce and a 1/4 bottle of red wine. Standard additions in my house for soups and stews (I used my homemade bone broth)

Loved it! I did make changes - used 3 tsp bouillon to boost the flavor a bit, added basil, and cut out the bag of mixed veg entirely. Instead, I sautéed 1 whole onion, 1 heaping tbsp. garlic, and about 8 oz baby bellas, minced fine. (Hubby doesn't like seeing them!) Used 1 large potato, 2 carrots, 1 cup corn. Oh, and I added 3/4 C barley because some said there wasn't enough. Plus enough water to simmer a while, so 6 cups. Very meaty! Addictive!! :d Recipe says 10 servings - make that more like 7-8 good sized bowlfuls.

I made this soup as written, except I bought stew meat (2 pounds, MORE than enough) and cut it into smaller bite size pieces, and used beef broth in place of water. My kids, who are young adults and VERY picky eaters, absolutely loved this soup...it was gone in two days! Delicious recipe!

I only used 2lbs beef, and I didn't have beef bouillon so I used chicken. I put everything together in the crockpot and removed the beef to cut it up at the end but this turned out excellent. Very tasty soup and healthy!!

This was very good but I did make a few changes. I omitted the bay leaf and I decided to take the lazy way out and just throw it all in at once and cook it all together rather than cook the meat first, thus omitting the oil as well. I have never had barley before so I wasn't sure what to expect but it was yummy. I used almost a cup instead half a cup which absorbed more of the broth than I would have liked it to so next time I will double the broth. Definitely making this again!

Great stew recipe- Frozen steaks - cut up.  Cooked on high - 5/6 hrs.  Used 1/2 bag frozen vegetables, 1 tsp seasoned meat tenderizer, dried minced onion, dried garlic, splash of balsamic vinegar, no fresh veggies, all in crockpot except for barley - added last hour.  Also added some nature's seasons, worcestershire and 1 12 oz. of Ebenezer ale.

Did the 10 hr option as someone else suggested.  Pulled it together about noon, cutting roast into cubes and not using oil to cook other ingredients.  I did add a few shakes of garlic and basil.   Put all in but barley.  Put on low about 10 pm.  When I got up in am added barley, cooked for another 20-30 min and removed from heat.  I have an awesome dinner for tonight.  Have time to make some bread and watch football.

I followed the instructions as written, and although it might have been more work than other reviewers have posted, the end result was delicious. I am hesitant to do the other way (put it all together in the crock pot) since I was able to remove so much fat that otherwise would have made its way in the soup. My only comment would be to increase the about. Of water to 5 cups, otherwise the remainder was great.

This was excellent but I ended up adding a can of tomato soup because it didn't quite have the red tomato-y flavor that I like so much in vegetable beef soup. Turned out amazing! Have already made it twice.

Everyone in my family loved it!  I followed the editor's version because I  wanted to cook it on the stove.  I used beef stock instead of bouillon and used the recommended fresh vegetables and frozen vegetables of my choice which included baby lima beans.  You can't have too many vegetables!  As others have said it is a good basic recipe that you can change to suit what you have in your cupboards or ingredients you prefer.  I'm going to make it again today with bouilion because I don't have any beef stock on hand.  I'm sure that will be good too.  And, I think I'm going to try the spicy Ro-tel diced tomatoes.  You can put most anything but sand in it and I think it will be good.

Made this today and like others, put everything in the crock pot and slow cooked it all day. Very delicious. The only changes I made was used 2 lbs stew meat, doubled the water and bouillon cubes and add a couple tbsp of Worcester sauce. Serving for dinner and freezing the rest. Definitely will make this again.

I always do my best to try the recipe out as written. I made this for lunch on Thanksgiving this year, and I must say that it was AWESOME. The only change that I made was that my mixed veggies already had carrots in it (so I didn't add more) and I also used crushed tomatoes since my husband doesn't like tomatoes. He ate it and was wanting more! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It is a perfect thing to make when the snow is flying and you want to warm up (and hunker down).

Soup came out great. I followed a couple suggestions of other reviewers and used beef broth instead of bullion cubes. I also used stew meat but I think when I make this next time I will definitely use chuck roast, the stew meat was fine but I think chuck roast would add a nicer flavor. I added a little garlic powder and also added some cubed potatoes. Put everything except the barley in my crock pot on low for about 13 hours (let it cook all day while at work). I cooked the barley separate and added it to the bowl then ladled the soup over it, I also made egg noodles  (husband prefers noodles) and did the same thing put noodles in bowl and ladled soup over it. Served soup with crunchy hot French bread. Its definitely worth making.

This was decent but I changed a few things.  I used Better than Bouillon Beef au jus starter because I find it has a beefier taste than their plain beef flavor.  I also used all beef stock instead of water and I added more carrots, celery and two very large yams. Next time I will saute the celery and carrots because even after more than 10 hours cooking time in the crockpot (including 1.5 hours at high) they were still a bit crunchy.  I also would add a leek or two -- also sauteed first -- if I make it again.  All the juice was absorbed after one night in the fridge and it became beef barley stew. Not sure how to avoid this -- more liquid I guess. Overall it was okay --- I think it needed a bit stronger beef flavor (maybe more bouillon?) I even used a pinch of Brown's gravy starter but it wasn't as rich in flavor as I hoped.

I had cubed beef.  With 2 pots I mixed flour, salt n pepper in a bag and shook meat until coated.  I seared in a few tbls of oil and set aside.  Added 4 cups of broth to pot, scraped bits off and added beef.  cook for 60 mins, add barley, bay n 1c water and cooked for 45 mins.  

Sauteed veggies in another pot like in step 2.  followed recipe using only 2 cups of broth.  when veggies were cooked i added 1tsp parsley, basil, and oregano with beef barley mixture.  Simmer, covered for 15 mins.  

The meat stayed together yet cut easily with my spoon.

Loved this hearty vegetable-filled soup! I agree with the other reviewers who suggest that it needs more seasoning. I always make as-is the first time, but I added some extra seasoning at the end to suit our families' taste, including about 3 T. Worchestershire Sauce.  I think next time I would either do it all in the crockpot (low 10 hours?) or all in the soup pot. But it is wonderful enough to make it into my "I Love to Cook Book"!

I took advice from other reviews and my own personal preferences and did the following: used 2# beef stew meat & cut it up into smaller pieces, used beef broth instead of water & bouillon, omitted the frozen vegetables, used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, added worcestershire sauce and a couple cloves of garlic - threw everything in the crockpot and let it cook for 9 hours. I put the barley in about 1hr and 20mins before I served. This was a huge hit!

I made this soup tonight, and as usual, I made a large quantity for freezing. I'm not one to measure much, but I made basically 4 times the recipe. I used about 3 cups of homemade reduced beef stock, 12 cups of water, 12 boullion cubes, 4 12 oz. pkg. frozen mixed veggies, 1 1/2 large onions chopped, 3 tbsp. sugar, 3 tsp. ground pepper, 1 tbsp. sea salt, 8 large fresh carrots sliced, 9 frozen garden tomatoes peeled and cubed, 12 stalks of celery sliced, and 1/2 large head of cabbage chopped. I didn't saute the veggies, but cooked them until tender in the broth mixture. Then I added the leftovers of 3 cubed roasts that amounted to about 6-7 lbs. The soup and broth are wonderful. I will freeze it in meal size portions and add precooked barley when it is used to prevent the barley from getting mushy. I soak and cook all grains in a rice cooker, and then package and freeze them for future use.

Love!  We used 4c of beef broth to cook the roast.  Instead of frozen mixed veggies we added 8 oz each of frozen corn and peas.  As another reviewer suggested we added a dash of Worcestershire instead of sugar.  We also upped the barley to 3/4c.  After letting it sit/cool overnight all the liquid was absorbed so we added 6c more beef broth before eating it today.  It was OUTSTANDING!

There was "Barley" any left once I dished out portions. So good - I took others advice and added all the ingredients to the pot at once and cooked it for 10 hours. Tasted delicious and doubling the barley was a smart move. Yum, yum, yum!

My general sense is that soup in the crock pot is pretty bullet proof, so I'm not surprised that this turned out well. All the same, the flavors and combination were good. I followed other comments and put everything but the barley in the crock pot in the morning and let it cook all day. It smelled great and tasted better.

OMG, this was awesome.  Like others suggested, I just put everything (except for barley and salt) in the crockpot at once and cooked on low for 10 hours.  Instead of the recommended veggies, I used one bag frozen peas, one bag frozen corn, one onion, one bag baby carrots chopped, one can stewed tomatoes.  Also added Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder.  The second time I made it, I left out the sugar and oil and missed neither one.  I also threw in some cubed boiled potatoes the second time in place of barley because I was out of barley.  Prefer the barley but potatoes were fine.  Love, love, love this soup!

This was really good. Next time I will double the water and beef broth since the next day there was hardly any broth it was more like stew instead of soup. Otherwise it was great! I did like other reviewers and threw everything in the crock pot.

This was a good soup.  I did it all in the crock pot by cooking the beef first then adding the fresh veggies for a few hours then the frozen ones the last hour.  I did not add the sugar and after tasting it thought it was a bit bland so added some dried parsley and oregano towards the end.  Oh, used diced tomatoes instead of stewed b/c it is what I had on hand and prefer.

I doubled the broth and carrots (I love carrots in soup).  I kept everything else the same.  It turned out good but next time I think I will try ground sirloin and season the meat well.  Overall, this is a really good basic recipe to build on to suit individual tastes and preferences.

So I read so many reviews on this recipe I decided to try it.  The changes I made were similar to most of the other ones,  the meat, I used chuck stew meat instead of a roast.  Cut it up into smaller pieces and browned it in a pan, and did the same with onions.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and about 3/4 of the way through I wanted a bit more tomato so I used a small can of quality of tomato sauce. I eliminated the sugar, I did use a bit more barley as well.  I used 1 1/2 cups as I wanted my soup a bit thicker.   My own personal addition to this soup was pecereno romano cheese! I added 3 heaping TBS to it when it had about 2 hours left.  Wow!  This is so delish, my picky 10 year old loved it.  My new veggie soup!

I've made this twice and loved it.  My daughter said she doesn't like barley soup but tried it anyway.  She commented on how good it is.  I put the stewed tomatoes through the blender because we don't like chunks of tomato in our soup, but that's the only change I make.

overall this is a very good soup with a few alterations; I added additional beef bullion for a bit richer flavor and cut the frozen veggies in half. After it had been simmering for some time I removed the bay leaves. i really, really disliked the smell and didn't see much difference in the flavor. It came together quickly and it was very easy to adjust according to our preferences without sacrificing flavor.

We enjoyed this hearty soup! Used canned beef broth. Would add extra can for more liquid. Also we like ours a little spicy...plan to substitute rotel tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes. Good basic recipe to tailor to your family's tastes.

This was a hit with my family.  If you like a really chunky soup that has very little broth, this is the one for you.  After dishing out to my 4 family members, I quickly realized that I was left with half a pot of solids and no broth left, so I dumped it all back in and added another 2 cups of beef broth.  Didn't do the mixed veggies... just threw in whole mini carrots and by the time soup was done, our spoons could just cut through them.  So much easier than chopping!  I also threw everything in right from the beginning except the barley.  That only needed adding for the last 2 hours.

My husband made this for dinner today and this is what I would consider a 'hearty soup'.  As others suggested, he added more barley.  He also added kielbasa and 16oz of water with 2 t of beef soup base.

Excellent! The soup was wonderfully thick so the only thing I did differently was to add some V8 juice so the soup would have more broth. ( I guess I could have added beef broth or tomato sauce as well. )

Made this with only a few subs.  I was out of Onion, Carrots, and celery.  I subbed dried onions, celery seed, and the mixed vegetables had carrots, so that was no big deal.  Was very good, and will definately go in my soup rotation!!

Also added everything to the crockpot in the morning except for the barley

I think this is probably a fine recipe for those who like these flavors. My family did not care for it. I thought it was pretty good served on mashed potatoes.

Thanks for a basic recipe. I omitted the beef roast and the beef broth. Simply used all vegetables and vegetable broth. My boyfriend and I thought it was good, especially with the barley.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used stew meat and threw all of the ingredients in the crockpot at once.  Great recipe.

I was looking for a recipe after I had the Vegetable Beef soup at Bob Evan's and really liked it (I'm not a huge beef eater).  This fit the bill exactly!!  So delicious.    I cubed the meat, coated in some AP flour, added to a hot pan I had going with a little oil, minced garlic, some of the chopped onion and a TBSP or so of Worcestershire sauce.  I browned the meat, then added it to my large (oval) crockpot with the veggies. I added 3 small-medium white potatoes (peeled, cubed) and frozen broccoli because I didn't have an entire package of frozen mixed veggies plus I love potatoes and broccoli.  I used all the other ingredients as listed.  I cooked on low for 10 hours without the barley.    We were finishing Christmas shopping and when we came home, the house smelled so good!  We enjoyed a bowl without the barley - so tasty! - then I added an entire cup of barley because of other reviewers who said it wasn't enough and then waited about another hour and had a second bowl with the barley.  I have to say that I wish I would have stuck with the 1/2 cup of barley.  1 cup seemed too much as it sucked up all the yummy broth, and its only going to get thicker now.    By the way this is enough to feed a small army.  It's just my husband and I and we only made a small dent in it last night.  I imagine it will taste even better for lunches this week.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was really good.  I took the advice from a lot of the reviewers and did the whole thing in the crock pot.  I cut up all the veggies and meat, used all beef broth and left it on low all day.  When I got home, I added the Barley and some extra water, and turned it on high for a little under an hour.  This was super filling and really rich!  I froze a container of my leftovers, and when I thaw it I'm sure I can just add some extra broth and it'll be revived!

Add all ingredients except barley into the crockpot. Cook on low for 9-10 hours. Add barley during the last 40 or so minutes.

This was quite tasty, but I made a variety of changes. I threw everything but the barley in the crockpot and cooked it on high for 4.5 hours, then added the barley and cooked for another 30 minutes. I used stew meat, diced tomatoes, beef broth, and added worcestershire sauce/oregano/garlic. I left out the onion/carrots because it was already very thick after adding the mixed veggies and celery... next time, I'll add the onion but will reduce the amount of veggies. I doubled the barley. Very quick and easy, but super yummy. Will make it again!

AMAZING!! Here are my changes: I took others advice and used stew meat instead, cut into smaller pieces. I used 3 cans of beef broth and 1 can of vegetable broth. 2 beef boullion cubes, 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce and I replaced the salt with seasoned salt. I cooked on high for 4 hours and low for 4 hours. When I turned the heat  down, I added 1/2 bag of simply potatoes. Added Barley last hour. YUMMY!!!!

Upped the water and beef bouillion each to 5 (to give it a little more liquid), subbed in pearl onions for the onion, added some Italian seasoning and a dash or 2 of cayenne for some heat.  Have had nothing but rave reviews on this one!  Just make sure you buy a chuck roast with a little fat on it and leave it there for cooking the meat and barley, removing it after it's cooked.  The fat is key to making this a really good tasting soup!

Wow!  This was really good.  I didn't understand how the meat could cook in the crockpot without any liquid so I added the stewed tomatoes with the meat and let it simmer.   It turned out great.  It was a perfect meal for a cold winter day!

I modified this just a bit - I put all of the ingredients in the crock pot to start, then, when the cooking time was almost complete, I removed the beef roast and pulled it apart, discarding the fat.  It was DELICIOUS!  Both my 4-year old picky eater and my 21-month old gobbled it up.

Delicious!  Craving a beef barley soup today and came across this recipe, sooooo glad I tried it!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, just changing a few things to make it a bit easier.  Didn't have the time to cook a whole roast, so used stewing beef instead, which I browned with the onions and a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  Used beef broth and water with bouillion powder, a clove of crushed garlic and 3 small potatoes diced.  Instead of stewing tomatoes used diced ones.  Also used 1 full cup of barley since I love it!  I kept everything else the same (minus celery cause the hubby HATES celery in anything!) and it was amazing!  Simmered it on the stove for 2 hours instead of crock potting it since I started it way late in the afternoon.  Will DEFINATELY make this a staple soup recipe in our house from now on.  Oh Ya! I also put a few splashes of Maggi seasoning into it as well.  Thank you so much for the amazing recipe!!  Cheers!  :)

I've held off on rating this for awhile because I always think I'll make it as written one day, but I just love using this for leftover beef cuts. Steaks and roasts, if I have at least a pound and a half of cooked beef I cube it up and follow the recipe as-written, throwing the bay leaf and barley into the mix and cooking until the barley is done. Like all my soups I do saute the veggies, I really miss the flavor notes that provides when I don't. I typically use broth, adding whatever juice or gravy my leftovers might have. This is probably the best and most impressive leftover-utilizing recipe I use. Thanks very much for sharing.

This was great! I didn't have a lot of time so I sauteed stew bits in olive oil and then removed and left the drippings and sauteed some onion, diced potatoes, carrots and celery. Then threw it all in the crock pot with 4 cans of beef broth and one cup of water and cooked on high for 4 hours and came out delicioso! I also added worchester sauce for a little zing.

As many others have done - I throw everything into my crockpot first thing in the morning and add the barley 30 minutes before dinner.  I do use a chuck roast instead of stew meat.  Just before serving I shred the roast into bite size pieces.  It really just falls apart.  I usually make a large batch and freeze some for later.  My family loves this recipe and I have been asked to share it with many friends and family members.

First time I made it exactly as recipe stated. The taste was very good but there was hardly any broth. Every time I've made it since, I used 7 bouillon cubes and 7 cups of water. After that adjustment, I would give it 5 stars.

This turned out WONDERFUL!  My family is begging for me to make it again.  We used the quick cooking barley and just added to the chuck roast right before adding to the remaining ingredients.  I also substituted fresh tomatoes blanched to remove skins for canned which makes it a little sweeter and beef stock.

This is so good! I made this on a very cold saturday. Along with fresh baked bread, it just doesn't get better. I followed the recipes exactley. It does make a thick soup, so you may want to add more broth if you like it with more liquid.

I made this recipe using 1.5 beef stew meat, used canned beef broth,  and doubled the vegetables and barley, added green beans, corn, peas, potatoes and 2 red bell peppers.  It is delicious.  My aim was to make tons of soup/stew, and use half the beef and more than double the veggies to make it super-healthy for my 4 teenagers.

A huge hit at my house.  All my kids loved it.  I did tweak it a bit...adding additional spices like thyme, oregano, basil.  Also used more beef broth than suggested (not the cubes).  Added cubed potatoes, carrots, celery and frozen peas.  I cooked the roast in the crock pot with 3 cans of broth and 1 chopped onion.  After 5 hours I took te meat out and cut into bite size pieces then placed back in the crock pot to let it sit overnight.  In the morning I made the carrots, celery, potatoes and peas as suggested then added the meat and broth.  Added the barley 1 hour before serving.  DELISH!!

Great soup.  I didn't use the slow cooker but instead floured and browned beef in olive oil before adding the rest of ingredients.

I read through tons of reviews to find the right combination. I finally just decided to wing it. I simmered the meat in a crockpot with about 3 cans of beef broth for 6-7 hours, then I pulled the meat apart and stored it w/the broth overnight. The next day all I had to do was put the rest together and let it simmer for about an hour.  I was so so good but it was even better a few days later. Also I didn't use the water, bouillon, frozen veggies. I just added extra celery, carrots, peas, lima bean & mushrooms. I didn't have any stewed tomatoes so I use crushed instead and there really was no difference.

This recipe is flippin' amazing! I did change it a little though. I used 3 lbs. of stew meat (cut into smaller pieces) browned in corn oil (one lb. at a time). I doubled the carrots, celery, and barely. I also used six cups of beef broth instead of bouillon and water, and I added worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, and parsley flakes. I skipped the frozen vegetables this time, but next time I'm going to try it with them. I cooked everything on high for 6 hours, except the barely which I added two hours before serving.

Very filling and healthy, but this makes A TON!  I think my husband was eating this for lunch for well over a week.  Next time I will either half the recipe or try to freeze some of it. I used stew meat instead of the roast and just dumped everything in the slow cooker at once.  The only drawback is that it has to cook for a LONG time when you do this, but I started it late morning and just put it in the fridge right before going to bed and we ate it the next day. The flavor is always better the second day anyway so it worked out nicely.

loved this, fantastic flavour. I took time to brown the meat before slow cooking, and deglazed the vegetables at the same time putting them in the fridge until they were needed later, so worth the effort.

Yummy good!  I was very pleased with the results of this recipe.  I had ribeye steaks in the freezer so I used them in the slow cooker.  The flavour of the ribeyes made the soup very good.  I rate this a great recipe.

Delicious!  I followed other reviewers' advice and cut up the meat into bite size pieces and added the meat and all ingredients except the barley to the crockpot for 8-10 hours.  I added 1/2 cup pearled barley (not quick-cooking) about 1 hour before serving.

Very good soup! I substituted 11/2 lbs of stew meat for the roast and added an extra 2 cups of broth. I didn't actually follow the directions I sauteed onion, celery carrots and garlic in butter then added the meat with 6c of broth. Simmered on the stove for 2 1/2 hours. Then added the barley (quick cooking was what I had) and a can of green beans.

Easy to make and it tastes like you slaved for hours!  Excellent taste and very flavorful.  All the vegetables are wonderful and so pretty!  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.

Oh god! These are so mouth-watering good! It's very much comfort food as it is camping, I'm sure! I can't seem to put my spoon down once I start eating this! Same thing happens to my family and friends too! You can't go wrong with this recipe since preciseness isn't a necessity---just throw what you want in it and make sure to use pearl barley like others have said. It turns out better than store bought beef stew/soup!

Yummm!!  I think this will be my permanent beef soup recipe now!!  :)  As some other reviewers suggested, I added everything to the crockpot together in the morning (including the barley [I used uncooked pearl, rather than instant], but omitted the sugar altogether) - and cooked all day on low.  I was only able to fit two cups of water in my pot, so when I got home from work, I slopped everything into a big stock pot on the stove, and added the remaining 2 cups of water (simmered for a few minutes).  I also added salt, more pepper, and a bit of garlic powder at this time.  I would rather not have to take this extra step, but until I get a bigger crock pot, I'll continue to make it this way...it's definitely worth it!  Yumm-o!!

I've made this twice:  once with meat adn this was fantastic, and now that we are vegetarians, I left out the meat and used veggie broth instead of water.  I also added a cubed potato.  It was fantastic.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely perfect.  There's not one thing I would change with this recipe (except that I did use beef broth instead of the water).  It was much better the second and third day.  My kids loved it!  This recipe is going in the permanant file!

This was FANTASTIC! I didn't have tomatoes so just left them out. I set the slow cooker to low then went to bed. I added the barley in the morning when I woke up. This turned out spectacular!If you love roast beef dinners, you'd love this recipe.

I've been looking for "that" beef barley vegetable soup for a long time - and this came very close.  I added an extra cup of water as it was very thick, and I even think you could safely add 2 cups (although you may want to add an extra beef cube at that point).  Excellent recipe, will make again.

This was great! And I failed in a big way to follow the recipe. I had leftover pot roast chopped up and frozen so I took that out and used it instead. To make the recipe work I sauteed the veggies then added the tomatoes, spices, thawed meat and barley. I also used beef broth instead of water and added three cups extra to accommodate the uncooked barley. I let it cook for more than three hours on low. It was lovely! Will try it again only try to embrace the recipe more. Thanks.Also I completley forgot the frozen veggies and did not miss them plus I added fresh mushrooms.

The recipe itself was okay, although nothing really out of the ordinary. I wouldn't make it in a slow cooker again, however. There was really no advantage to it as I generally leave beef barley soup sit on the stove at low for several hours anyway.

Yummy--a Sunday night staple in our house.  I've found that when we eat it the second day, it seems to need a little beef broth added to the bowl--other than that--wonderful!  Freezes well also!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and just put everything in the crockpot minus the barley (put in last hour of cooking) and cooked it for 7+ hours on high.  The meat took that long to soften up.  Taste was pretty good but was not exactly what I was looking for.  I think I would leave out the frozen veggies next time, add 1/2 an onion more, more celery and perhaps zucchini, porcini mushrooms and/or potato to the mix.

This soup is the BOMB! I am not a big vegtable soup eater and this I would eat 5 days a week. I did not have Barley so I used a small pasta instead. It turned out great! My family is harping on me all the time to make it again. It is very good!

Okay, so, this was my first soup experience and I am proud to report that it was a success! I cooked a bigger roast than suggested (4 lb...it was just there), added more barley, 2 cups more water and an additional boullion cube. It was a tasty sensation! A bonifide party in my mouth. I hightly suggest making this soup often and inviting the neighborhood.

I browned 1 lb of beef tips in oil, added water, then pressure cooked 20 min. till soft, (with the bay leaf and 1 cube bouillon), added the barley and pressure cooked it again for 15 min., then added the sauteed vegis MINUS the tomatos, water and the rest of the bouillon.  EXCELLENT!

This has the best, richest taste of any soup I've made.  My Mom makes her vegetable soup with frozen vegetables, and I don't like the taste and texture of the vegetables.  However, in this dish, I didn't notice it.  I believe the addition of the fresh vegetables made the difference.  Instead of using bouillon, next time I will just substitute beef broth.  Excellent!

This was my first ever attempt at making soup.  I was amazed at how well this tasted.  I added extra barly to recipe and used beef broth instead of the boullion and added extra water as needed for the final cooking time. I cooked the soup for 1-1/2 hours extra at the end.  Absolutely delicious!!!!!!!

I cooked the meat with some (as in a few splashes) sherry and soy sauce. When the meat was ready, I shredded it, poured the broth out to drain off the fat. Instead of 4 cups water, I used the resulting broth, 1 can of Guinness, and broth to  bring it up to 4 cups (about another 1/2 cup of broth). I sauteed the veggies and just threw them in the crock pot with the rest. I left out the sugar. Awesome.

Excellent recipe.  I sliced the roast into thick slices after I removed it from the crockpot, then shredded each slice so the meat in the soup was like pulled beef instead of cubes.  I also used low sodium beef broth instead of the water w/ bouillion.  We couldn't stop eating this!

Nuked the bouillion cubes and water then put it in with the meat and put it in the crockpot on high for about 7 hours.  Cooled and skimmed off the fat.  Next day, after sautee'ing veggies (used petite beans for the mixed vegetables) put in a Dutch Oven, then added diced tomatoes, as that is what I had on hand along with rest of ingredients.  Great flavor!  Think I will add 4 c. more water/bouillion next time as it was really thick so I can add some corn and more barley, maybe on that one.  Very tasty!  Thanks for a keeper!  (Also think I'll cut meat as for stew as that is what it turns out more to be like, a stew).  It IS just the best combo of flavors.

I'm not usually a fan of vegetable or beef soup, but this is the best I have ever had.  The only thing I changed is that I simmer the soup for an hour instead of 10-20 minutes to better combine all the flavors.

This is a great dish to make ahead, for a homey comforting stew on a blustery day.  I put the roast in the slow cooker with the quart of water and bouillon cubes to cook it, then cut the cooked meat into cubes.  I sauteed the veggies and added the rest of the ingredients, including the cubed meat, broth and uncooked barley.  I brought it to a boil and then simmered it for 20 minutes or so until the barley was done.  I didn't have to add water, but it was thick and stew-like.  If you want soup proper, following my method will require more water added when you cook it.  Either way, the leftovers will need water added, and maybe some salt by then, but leftover this tasted even better than the first time.  I warn you, it looks like canned soup but it tastes a lot better!

We are soup lovers, and we loved this!  I put everything in the crock pot at the same time except for the barley and frozen veggies which I added the last 2 hrs.  (And I substituted stew meat for the roast.) It could not have been easier.  The flavor was wonderful, but I did need to add more liquid. We ate on it all week without getting tired of it.  That's something!

Cooked the beef in beef broth (instead of water and bouillon cubes) then set over night so I could skim the fat off in morning and then finished the recipe. Very tasty every one really liked it.

This is a tasty, very simple soup. Rather than using a roast, I used chuck steak, which was a very cheap cut. Because it was in the crockpot, though, it was very tender and really added to the flavour. I'm going to have the leftovers for lunch today and I bet it will taste even better! The barley is definitely a must, as it adds texture and a good flavour.

I'VE MADE THIS RECIPE TWICE; ONCE THE WRONG WAY AND THEN CORRECTLY. **BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS AND ADD THE BARLEY IN THE LAST HOUR; OTHERWISE, IT TASTES STARCHY. VERY FLAVORFUL AND WARMING ON A WINTER DAY WHEN IT'S MADE ACCORDING TO DIRECTIONS.

Love this soup!  Did some minor adjustments based on other reviews, such as spices and Worcestershire. I think the amount of barley and vegetables is perfect. Soup is the easiest way to get certain family members to eat their veggies!

I make this more so for my wife, she has fond child hood memories of her grandma making this. She says its so good that its just as good as Grandma used to make. But overall the whole family loves it. Instead of the 4 cups of water I use 4 cups beef bullion, I also find that this still isn't enough liquid so I sometimes have to add a few cups of water on top of that. I also use 2 1/2  tables spoons of sugar instead of just 1. I also don't cube cut the meat, it comes out of the slow cooker so soft and tender it can easily be shredded with two forks. Its great serves with garlic bread too.

I took the suggestions of the first review and added the barley for entry last hour. This was not anywhere near long enough for the barley to cook. I ended up putting the soup on the stove and boiling it until the barley was soft. In addition, I am questioning the addition of tomatoes. They added a sweetness that I did not care for and they changed the color of the soup. I did increase the amount of liquid while the barley was boiling.. All in all, a hit.

I will make this one again. It is fairly simple and really tastes great. I used the beef broth instead for the water and beef bullion cubes.

I left the sugar out.. I added 1/2 more of barley. I did the  roast in the crockpot as suggested. I added a whole bulb of garlic  ( I chopped it minced , great for the immune system). I  cut all of my vegetables instead of the frozen mix. DELICIOUS! Fed to the neighbors and still enough for leftovers!

I really like this but think it's better with canned chopped tomatoes, not stewed.

I substituted 4 cups of Low Sodium Beef broth for the 4 cups of water and bouillon. It came out great tasting!  I also made mine in a pressure cooker, so I was done from start to finish in less than 2 hours! Somethings can be done in a pressure cooker and taste exactly like an all day cook. This is one of them! Don't be a hater!!  :-)

My family really enjoyed this. I will be making this again. I did, however, make it differently than the directions. I trimmed and cubed the chuck roast, used beef stock instead of water and bouillon, threw it all in the crock, and added the mixed veg and barley for the last hr of cooking. On the advice of a friend, I quartered a yellow onion and discarded it after the soup was done. It gave the soup all the flavor, without the bits of onion that my kids would be turned off to. The only thing I would change for next time, I would use seasoned diced tomatoes instead of stewed.

Great recipe!  I followed Mihaela's suggestions and added all ingredients in the crock pot except the barley and salt and slow cooked for 10 hrs, then the last 20 minutes of cooking added the barley and salt.  Also took others' suggestions of adding thyme, basil, oregano, minced garlic, and Worcestershire Sauce as well.  Definitely what I was looking for and will make again and again.  Thank you!

This soup turned out delicious!  I, however made a few alterations to mine like browning the beef and "soup vegetables" (carrots, celery & onion) This is a critical step (in my opinion) for adding a flavor punch to any soup/stew/sauce.
The true beef flavor comes from the browning/searing of the meat you are using for the recipe. The key to browning beef is to let it get nice and crusty on the exterior- (not just the grey color it turns when you first add the beef to a hot pan) Additionally, if you want to add even more flavor, deglaze the pan/pot with a little bit of water.  The more you let the beef sear + the more you deglaze- the more flavor you get.  Then use the extra juices into the recipe, of course.  
There was no need for me to season the beef ahead of time, so I left the salt and pepper out until the end of the recipe. (Sometimes salting beef or pork draws out the moisture of the meat, which can make it tough)
Once I finished searing the beef, I set it aside in a bowl and added the carrots, celery, and onion.  I  had some "Leek" left over from another recipe, which I added. Then another flavor punch was the "fennel bulb" which was quartered and added to the sauteed vegetables.  Once they were nice and soft, I added the meat back into the pot along with all the juices that had been released after searing.
After all of that "adding",  I then included the remainder of the recipe ingredients and allowed it to cook in my pressure cooker for 20 min or so.

I highly recomm

I did like some of the other reviews and put everything in to start, except the bay leaf and the barley. I cubed the meat when it was still partial frozen which made it easier to trim some of the fat off of my piece of roast and cut it into cubes. (Personal preference) I cooked in in my Ninja on high for 4 hours and put the barley and bay leaf in the last hour. 

I used cut up onions and 2 bags of frozen mixed veggies. It seemed like a lot so I left out celery and extra carrots. Also, I used beef broth that I had instead of 4 cups of water and threw in a couple of extra beef bouillon cubes. 

My boyfriend loved it and asked me to make it again shortly after so A+ recipe for our family!

I  Will make this recipe again. I modified it some  by adding about  2  teaspoons  of Paprika, 2 tablespoons Worchester sauce,  and used 1/2 gallon of low salt beef broth. I did not measure the water separately, I just monitored the Barley as it cooked  and added water as needed  to keep it soupy . I also added a green pepper  ( diced) since I had one about to turn. I  sautéed all the vegetables except for the carrots and I did not use the frozen vegetables.

Yum, this is GREAT! I thought 3 pounds of beef seemed too much but it is really good, and my family loved it. Followed all measurements but I didn't do it in the crock pot, I did it on the stove and it turned out great. I didn't use frozen veggies, I had a 12oz bag of carrots sliced, and cut an onion and a half (med size) and 3-4 celery stalks, all in my fridge, along with exactly (coincidentally enough) 4C of au jus leftover from the Christmas prime rib. I used a full 28oz can of stewed diced tomatoes & juice and added some Italian seasoning + parsley (about 1t or more, to taste). Waited til the end to put in my barley as I could only find quick barley in the store. YUM! Very good recipe! Next time I will put it in a slow cooker, saving the barley til the end as others have recommended.

I made the changes recommended and accidentally doubled the amount of veggies I added.  My family went NUTS!  
They ate every drop of this soup and keep asking me to make more.  They do want more meat in it next time - an easy fix!  I actually bought a roast and cut it down to bite size and will do that again - eliminating the fatty parts my family dislikes.  Best recipe EVER!

In my opinion the soup was a bit on the flavorless side.  It could use some herbs, although I don't know which ones.  It could have also used lots more liquid, as it was thick with vegetables, beef and barley.  I actually used a pound less beef than the recipe called for and it was still too dense.

This recipe is great! I skipped the step of browning the beef because I often throw things in the crock pot right before I leave for work and who wants to brown meet at 7am?  Still, the meat comes out nice and tender.  I also added a cubed a potato and some extra water because I like my soup more brothy.  I will be making this again!

This is very good!  Like others, I used frozen stew meat (about 2.5 lbs) and put everything in the slow cooker except for the barley, which I added about an hour before serving.  I used beef broth in lieu of the water and bullion.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe, MARGOC!

This soup is amazing! Super easy to make but tastes like you spent hours making! I would suggest only using 1/2 cup of barley. I'm defiantly making this for my husband to take when he goes hunting this fall!

My advice is to watch the video.  The recipe says to put the beef in your slow cooker with no mention of adding broth.  The frozen mixed vegetables should complement what's already in the soup.  I'do choose corn

This was a fun and easy recipe that came out tasting great, if you have never cooked with barley give this a try.

Too much barley, which swells up as it sits. Also, the stew meat was not tender enough.

Very tasty.   I made this recipe exactly as originally written and enjoyed it.   Make sure to use a big enough sauté soup pot when you add all the ingredients together.  I did not at first and ended up with a lot of pots and clean.  First soup for us this Fall and we really enjoyed it.   Makes a lot of soup so you could definitely freeze some or share some.

Very Good!  I cook the chuck roast until falling apart and shred it into the soup. You can use any vegies you like (green bell pepper adds a unique flavor) but I always use the 4 cups beef broth and stewed tomatoes per recipe.  I do use 3/4 cup barley as another person suggested.

Really YUM. I cooked onion with the beef in the crock pot. Not a fan of cooked celery so I just added more veggies. I have to eat gluten free, so I substituted a mix of rice and quinoa for the barley, and used "Better than Bouillon" as a replacement for traditional bouillon to make sure it was safe for me. So flavorful and hearty!

This was great!
We used a 3 lb chuck roast, trimmed some fat and cut into cubes.  Not real small.  Doubled the barley because I love barley.  We did put everything in the slow cooker (10 hours) except the barley right from the start.  Added the barley with about 45 minutes to go and stired the stew at that time.
I used broth and didnt have enough so i put in some chicken broth.
We had spagetti squash parmisian as the vegetable .
That slow cooker is great.  I never would have done this on the stove!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  I make it in the crockpot on low during an 8 hr. work day.  I throw everything except the barley into the crockpot in the morning before I head to work.  When I get home I add the barley about 20-30 minutes before I serve dinner.  Leftovers are great too.  Easy and delicious.  Thank you for sharing this one.

I had to add so much to this recipe that it is not the same.  I gave it just 2 stars because the proportions are all wrong.  I tried making it as directed, but I needed about 10 cups of water for the amount of meat and vegetables, which I didn't change.  I used no tomatoes, which was my preference.  Since I cooked in on stove top, I can't attest to the amount of cooking time, but even then I simmered the beef for over 3 hours until it was tender. If I had added the frozen vegetables, I'm sure I would have had a stew instead of soup, even with the amount of extra broth I added.

Made this last night! I went to work and let my roast cook low and slow, came home and the rest was a breeze! I had everything already home to make this, except I only had a can of whole tomatoes instead of stewed, which still turned out great! My husband and I loved it and will be making it again!

This is an amazingly flexible recipe, as the review variations demonstrate. I had over-cooked the Christmas roast to the point of desiccation, and I didn't know how I was going to salvage the remains. I cubed it, put it in a stewpot with the barley, bay leaf, and a carton of Pacific Brands beef broth. That came to a boil and then simmered as I sauteed the other vegetables - another reviewer is correct - the frozen vegetable mix usually has carrots, so you don't have to add more - threw it all in together, brought it to a boil, then simmered for 20 more minutes. (I left out the tomatoes at my husband's request. That worked very well.) It was perfect with some home-made wheat bread on the side,and it tastes SO much better than Campbell's or Progresso. Thank you, Margoc.

Really good flavor. I sauteed the vegetables then dumped the meat in to cook it and that worked perfectly while also cutting down the prep time to about an hour.

SOO YUMMY!  I adjusted the amount of meat though--we are borderline vegetarians and rarely eat beef.  Halfed the amount of beef, and doubled everything else.  Did it on the stovetop with the directions listed under the recipe in the editor's note.  I through in a little garlic as well.  The barley that I purchased was 10 min cooking time (quick cooking barley) so I added that at the end for the last 12 min.  Had to use Stew Meat because that is what I found at Trader Joe's.  SO GOOD!!!!!!

Sautéed veggies and stew meat together then added the rest. I always add a can of tomato paste as well to thicken it and make it taste a little more tomato like. Instead of a bag of mixed veggies I add a can of green beans and a few potatoes. Turns out wonderful! YUMMM!

This was a delicious soup, and perfect for a cold fall day.  I diced the meat into cubes from the start, and added the tomatoes, bay leaf, water, and bouillon cubes too.  About two hours later, I added the onion and carrots, as well as the mixed veggies.  An hour before I served- I added the celery and some salt.  I used Quaker quick cook barley and cooked it seperately, and just added it in the last 20 minutes before serving.  Total cooking time on high in the crock pot was about 5 hours. It was delicious.

Great soup!  I love how easy it is to adapt to what you have in your fridge that needs to be eaten.  Looking forward to making this often this winter with some homemade biscuits!

Wonderful! I used my own stock from shank bones. I also didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used crushed instead. We like to chew our soup so I think I might add some cubed sweet potatoes and shredded cabbage or Kale next time. We'll be having this again.

Beef barley soup is my husband's favorite.  I put the tomatoes in the food processor for a second so that there were no chunks. He LOVED it and it will be my go to recipe when he wants soup.

We absolutely loved this recipe with a couple minor changes. I used a 2 lb. sirloin tip roast, a bit drier, less greasy but a still a lot of flavor. I substituted frozen green beans for the mixed veggies and added extra carrots. I also used 4 cups of beef broth (low sodium) and mixed 2 bouillon cubes with 2 cups water. Our house smelled wonderful!! Next time I may add a bit more barley, potatoes or parsnips.  So many ways to add to an already great soup!!!

This recipe is good as is but it wasn't great. There was not nearly enough barley for my taste and the tomato was a bit over powering. I think if I make it again, I would triple the barley and I would either half the amount of tomatoes or omit them all together. I like a more beefy flavor.

Recipe was good as written, but to make it even better I threw everything but the barley in the crockpot, added a spash of worcestershire, and cooked it about 6 hours, then added the barley and cooked another 45 minutes. I did use stew meat instead of a roast, and diced tomatoes instead of stew, but it was easy and very filling.

Wow!!!  This soup was AMAZING!!!  My husband ate 4 bowls and all three of my small children ate it up too.  The only thing I did different was to use 4 cups of homemade beef broth instead of the water/boullion combo and I cooked the chuck roast on low for 8 hours. Yum!!!!!

I did this on the stovetop and used beef stew meat instead of pot roast.  I also did not use frozen veggies.  This was simple, delicious, warm and filling to serve on a cool day.  I served it with warm bread. We will make this again.

I absolutely loved this dish!!! I was confused by the frozen veggies after cutting up all those fresh ones. So next time I think I will use all fresh produce. I followed everything exactly as stated and was really impressed! Mmmmm can't wait to reheat some for lunch!!

Followed recipe exactly.  Husband and picky eater son liked.  Daughter and I did not.  If I make it again, I will omit stewed tomatoes since daughter and I do not like cooked tomatoes or tomato saucy stuff.

My family liked this soup. I had a package of stew meat, so I used that. I cut the chunks into smaller pieces. It was only one pound, and it was plenty. There isn't a lot of broth in this soup. Some may wish to add more broth, but only do it if you have the large crockot. It will definitely overflow if you have the average sized one. I follow others advice and added everything at once into the crockpot, cooked for 9 1/2 hour, then added the barley and salt for the last half hour.

I made up my own directions so I could use my crock pot for the entire dish.  I did step two first, then cubed my beef and threw all of the ingredients in the crock pot minus the barley.  I three that in about 45 minutes prior to eating, and it was amazing!

This was THE best beef veggie soup I have ever had!  It doesn't call for a lot spices but we thoroughly enjoyed it. 
If you are having trouble getting your beef to cook through--bite size pieces, all about the same size, put pan on burner with only oil in it until it shimmers, then add meat all at once, yes it will sizzle.  Let stay for about a minute, then stir some. Follow recipe as directed.

I did this the crockpot way.  I cooked the beef in beef broth for 5 hours on high (did not use water/bouillon cubes--just a lot of broth).  Let the beef cool and shredded then sat the broth and beef into the frig overnight so I could skim the fat off the broth the next morning.  Then I added everything else--cooked another 4 hours (adding the barley the last hour).  It was my soup for crockpot Monday at work.  I made a double batch---someone unplugged the crockpot because there was not one drop left!  It is a fantastic soup.

This was a delicious stew. I cooked the chuck roast in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low, added quick barley and the bay and turned it to high while I prepped the rest of the ingredients (about 30 minutes). I used a 4c. carton of beef stock in lieu of the water and buillion cubes. For the frozen vegetables, I used a combination of corn and green beans. I shredded the beef with two forks into large chunks. I liked the flavor and texture of the meat and vegetables cooked separately and the larger chunks of beef made this hearty, while adding a lusciousness to the stew.

Health reasons require that I remove all salt.  I considered other review suggestions before I embarked with taking "liberties" with this recipe.  In spite of my personal recipe contortions, it turned out with that wonderful flavor that I remember from beef barley soup.  With the bonus of significant salt reduction!  Here goes:  I used a cast-iron dutch oven on the stove top, rather than the crock pot. Omit H2O, sugar, bullion, salt, and tomatoes.  I used 1 1/2 lbs chuck roast, trimmed & cut to bite sized.  Browned meat in the (hot) oil. Added my substitutions, and the remainder of recipe ingredients.  I used tomato paste 1TBL (increase fluids additional 2 cups).  Changed Black pepper to 1/2 tsp, added thyme 1/2 tsp.  Used beef stock (from scratch), rather than H2O.  Considered using Worcestershire, not used.  Instead I used 8oz cremeni mushrooms, finely chopped).  Added one finely chopped potato, with skin on. Had only frozen peas, subbed for mixed veggies.  Brought covered dutch oven to boil.    Reduced heat, & simmered for 1 hour.   Discarded bay leaf. Add Barley cooked about an hour longer, or until barley done. Very flavorful Beef Barley soup. Will definitely make again.  Thank you for sharing!!

Especially when following the advice of previous reviewers, this is a super easy recipe.  I sauteed an aromatic of onions, garlic, and carrots (I dislike celery) and then dumped everything (save the barley and mixed veggies) into the crock pot. 10 hours later, I cut the meat and added the barley/veggies.  This is good, but a bit bland for my tastes (and I even added a glug of red wine and some worchestershire sauce to the broth).  While it wasn't my cup of tea, I have a feeling my gram will love this!  Thanks for the recipe, MAROC!

This is a very good soup.  It is thick, but that's what we prefer.  I had never used barley before but we like it.  My husband said it's a keeper and I agree.  I certainly will be making it again.  Thanks for sharing.

AWESOME!!!!  So, so good.  I didn't have a 16 oz bag of mixed frozen vegetables, so I used half a bag of frozen corn and half a bag of frozen peas.  This turned out absolutely awesome and my husband loved it - thank you for posting!

Great soup recipe.  I have made this several times and used varioius cuts of beef including ground beef.  Always a winner especially with my hubby, and my 9 year old grandson.

My wife has been asking for beef barley vegetable soup for awhile.  I saw this and made it and it is perfection.  Tastes just the way I remember my mother's soup tasting!

I've made this several times now.  This is top shelf soup!  The last time my wife mixed in about 1 1/2 c. of mashed potatoes while I was gone to the grocery store.  Totally changed this soup to the better.  I didn't think it could get better.  I was wrong.

Delicious and healthy. I felt like the barley took longer to cook than the "last hour" comments. I also wish it had more broth! it was more like a stew.

This soup is easily the best I have ever had.  My father-in-law loves soups and he requests I bring several batches frozen to him every time I visit.  I put everything in a crockpot, except the barley and frozen vegetables to cook. I do not brown the meat.  I use canned beef consommé instead of bullion cubes for a richer flavor. Be sure to stick to stewed tomatoes as there is a difference in flavor!  Amazing recipe!

Good recipe.  We had some crusty buttered bread to dip in the broth.  I used 1 cup of frozen corn and thyme instead of the bay leaf.

Very good!  I added a bit more barley, cuz I like lots!  I also used a venison roast instead of beef.  My kids loved it!  Oh, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Love, love, love this soup!  I've made this twice now. Cooked stewing beef in broth in crackpot on high 4-5 hrs then put in fridge overnight and skimmed fat in the morning. Sauteed onions and frozen veg (didn't use additional veggies beyond frozen pkg) and then added all the other ingredients and simmered for an hour or more. Awesome and so filling!! Looking forward to trying suggestion of putting everything in crackpot and cooking on low 10 hrs, too!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed editor's instructions on making on the stove. Did everything the same, except added 1 cup of instant barley, and 5 cups of water, 5 beef bouillon cubes, and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Delicious and easy!

Not a huge fan of beef and barley soup, but had some leftover roast and it turned out great! I too put it in the Crockpot early in the day and let it cook all day long adding some frozen mushrooms and carrots when I still had 3 hours to go so they wouldn't get mushy thru the entire 10 hours of cooking. I also added 1/2 a tsp dried thyme at the begining and 2 TBSP of Worcestershire sauce towards the end...it was just what the soup needed!

I did as several others and put all in the crock pot from beginning except barley which I put in near the end.    I went with about 2 lbs of stew meat and followed the rest of the recipe with some added seasonings.  I like the consistency of the soup with the barley and lots of veggies....but I thought it was bland.....even after adding some seasonings and spice to start with.    I will definitely be adding some more pepper and spices to increase the flavor of the leftovers.

Fantastic soup -- even better the second day.  Only change I made to the recipe was to increase barley to one cup and used store-bought beef stock in the crock pot and in addition to the water when preparing soup (oh yeah -- I used "Better than Bullion" paste instead of cubes

Loved this nice hearty soup for a cold VT evening.  Made slight changes based on personal likes and dislikes.  Threw it all in the crockpot and cooked the barley right before serving and added that to the finished soup.  Didn't put in the frozen vegetables but did add a can of mushrooms at the end.  Also added about 1T of minced garlic and probably about 1T of italian seasoning.  Will make this again for sure.

I thought this soup was really good. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because my family is not generally beef soup eaters, but they did eat this.

I made this for my daughter's birthday soup buffet.  This and a creamy chicken rice soup were the hit of the party.  Definitely a favorite of my husband and daughter!  Great with lots of veggies - I put as many as my pot would hold.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I found it kind of bland.  May be it was just the way I prepared it.  I put everything in the crock pot and cooked for 10 hours.  There was too much meat and not enough broth for my taste.  Next time I'll reduce meat by half and add more broth.

Made this last week for the first time and it is an instant favorite!!!  My adjustments were to add 2-4 extra cups broth (we like a lot of broth) , and instead of mixed veggies I just added half a bag frozen corn.  I put everything except instant barley and salt in a large crockpot and after 6 hrs  I shredded the beef and added my barley and salt--cooked till barley was done, about 15 mins.  Served with a loaf of homemade bread and found a dinner to die for!  Will make many, many more times--thanks!!!

EXCELLENT!  Agree totally with MIHAELA's comments.....used 3 lb stew meat cut up and about 5 cups beef broth....you can really add as many veggies as you like....used long cooking barley added at last hour of cooking (cooked 10 hours in slow cooker)

Very good recipe but I did add a little extra spices because it seemed as if something was missing and it needed a little kick of something. But overall I would make this again for sure. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe made a very hearty soup, but the consistancy more resembled a stew.  It was very thick.  I will be making this again.

This is a great hearty soup.  I did as other reviewers suggested and just threw everything in the crockpot (minus the barley).  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed (didn't have any), and I left out the celery and carrot, as my mixed veggies already had carrot in them and DH doesn't like celery.  I added the barley at the end, but mine needed almost an hour to cook (maybe other reviewers used a quick-cooking barley and mine wasn't??).  I also increased the barley to about 1 c., though I will try it with 3/4 c. next time.  Thanks!

Very good. I used ground beef for this and doubled the recipe. I also added a little Lawrys seasoning and garlic powder.

This was really good.  I didn't use the crock pot for this one, and still ended up with a yummy soup.  The bioggest thing I did differently from the recipe is that I used about 1.35 lbs of ground beef instead of the roast, and I actually boiled the beef in a pot of water and then used that as the base of this soup.  I did end up using the entire box of quick-cooking barley, and it was perfect.  Very hearty and comforting!

This is a great recipe. One change I make is to use beef broth instead of water and bouillon cube. I also use top sirloin - it costs more but tastes great. You can sear the meat first for a little extra steak flavor, but not necessary. We never have bay leaf, so we skip that step. We also don't add any sugar. We do, however, add fresh cabbage which is wonderful. We used to use our crock pot, but it would be filled to the brim, so we use a large, tall stock pot/dutch oven with plenty of extra room. We got about 25 big bowls of soup out of our last batch. Low fat and delicious!

I did alter the recipe a bit as I did not have have stewed tomatoes on hand; the soup was delicious without.  I also added some cut up potatoes--great soup for a cool fall night.

Loved it!  I followed the suggestions and put all ingredients(except the barley) into the crock pot at one time (no cooking the meat ahead or cooking the veggies on the stove).  Not only that but my meat was still frozen when I put it in the crock pot!!!  It turned out excellent.  My husband loved it and raved about having fresh soup.

Fantastic soup or stew, depending on what you want to make of it. Followed the recipe with the exception of using a package of pre-cut stew beef instead of the chuck roast. My wife doesn't usually like leftovers, but she couldn't wait to take this to work with her, where her coworkers were jealous of the wonderful soup her husband had made for her.

This is a great vegetable soup! I added fresh vegetables instead of frozen. (carrots, green beans, onion, corn, peas, tomatoes) Makes a lot, so I froze the rest for quick heat up meals.

I used the all in one pot method mentioned earlier (with an unplanned substitution of diced tomatoes for the stewed) and this was awesome.  I'll be making this again for sure.

Excellent soup.  I added some add'l spices; garlic powder, thyme, parsley and a little worsteschire.  I also cooked the beef with all the other ingredients except veggies and barley for about 7 hours on low.  Came home and sauteed veggies and threw them in for another 2 hours. Then made some quick barley on the stove top and added last.   Soup was a little greasy so I think next time I will do as the recipe says and cook meat separate then assemble soup, hopefully leaving the fat behind.

Very good base recipe. I threw everything into the crockpot, and added the pearl barley (upped the amount to one cup) and salt during the last hour. I had to doctor it quite a bit to get good flavour though, the recipe as is is quite bland. I had 4 cups of beef broth as well as 2 cubes of beef buillon, a tsp of minced garlic, and some garlic powder. I marinated the cubed beef overnight in montreal steak spice and garlic powder. At the end of it, my boyfriend said it was the best beef barley soup he had ever had, and he can't wait to bring it to lunch tomorrow. Thanks!

Cut meat into soup-size cubes. Put all but barley straight into crockpot. Used beef broth instead of bouillon. Doubled barley (long-cooking pearl), added for last hour. My family was wild about it!  Would add extra broth next time, and possibly a packet of gravy mix as suggested by another reviewer.  Will become a regular winter comfort food for us.

Very delicious and not too difficult. I used 2 lbs. roast and 5 cups of boxed beef broth. Next time I'll add less sugar & some worstershire.  Browning the meat made for extra flavor; Slow cooked for 2-3 hrs. on high and 2 more on low. Meat fell apart.  My 1st attempt at this soup & was definitely worth it.

Very good soup. I only used 2 lbs of roast (leftovers) and think 3 would have been too much. Next time I will double the barley an possibly add another bouillon cube for flavor.

This was a great recipe! So easy to make. I added 6 cups of beef broth or 3 cans and put in 1 cup of barley instead of 1/2.  Delicous and hearty especially on a cold night.

This is a great comfort food.  I substituted leeks for the celery for a slightly different taste treat.  It was delicious!  Serve it with fresh bread made in those wonderful bread machines and you have a meal sure to please.

Delicious rich beefy flavor.  My family begged me to make this again.  Removing the cooked beef and chopping it up (minus fat, etc) is a little time consuming, but the end result was worth the effort.

I gave this 4 stars because I tweaked it quite a bit. I used stew meat cut into really small cubes and browned them in oil with garlic and onions. I added 1/4 cup red wine and reduced it. I put the meat into a large pot and added diced carrots and celery, 2 tetrapacks of beef broth, 1/2 tsp marjoram, 1/2 tsp thyme, 2 tsp beef buillion (instead of salt) and 3/4 cup pearl barley. 

I brought it to a boil and covered the pot and simmered for 1 hour. I then added 1/4 cup flour (shaken in 1/2 cup  cold water to eliminate lumps) and added it to the soup to thicken it just a bit. 

I was DELICIOUS and my 3 kids had 2 helpings each!

This soup is so hearty and delicious!  I used a better cut of meat and kept it in the slow cooker on low for about 9-10hrs (along with the other ingredients besides the barley).  The meat was so tender!  I would leave out the salt though because there was enough salt in the beef broth (I didn't use low sodium).  I will make this soup again!

I simmered beef chuck bones over night in the crock pot.  Removed the bones and added all the other ingredients.  Did not use the sugar, used Mexican style tomatoes and a 1/2 - 1 tsp of thyme, basil and 1/4 tsp of oregano about an hour before serving.  Next time, no oregano!!!  Everyone loved it, I can't give it 5 starts since I changed it up some.  Will make again!

This was okay. I skipped the step of slow cooking a roast and just bought chopped up stew beef and added some lean ground beef. I also didn't add the water and bouillon but instead added two quarts of beef broth (my soup was a lot meatier than the recipe called for). I added two chopped up potatoes and I also added some garlic, a little bit of oregano and basil for flavor. 

This is a good base for a beef barley soup/stew, but I think as written it was a bit bland and I had to add a bit more flavor to it.

Very Good soup.  I tried to 1/2 the recipe, but there was not very much broth in relation to the vegetables and meat.  I ended up adding broth and making a bigger batch.  I used left over rump roast that I had cooked in the crock pot for supper the night before.  I sauted the onions, but just threw everything else in a big pot and boiled for 15 minutes and simmered until my husband got home.  Good recipe.  Will use again!

Well, I started this about 1pm today for supper and also skipped the slow cooker since time was a factor.  I used boullion and water and hoped it would be okay.  I also used petite diced toms instead of stewed (did not have those) I doubled the veggies (fresh) and it is amazing!  My kids and I just sampled it and my 18month old is begging for more and my boys all gave it 5 stars and want dinner now!!  So thanks for the great easy recipe - I know my husband is salivating on his way home thinking about supper!!

This was very good but I did make a few changes. I used 1 cup barly to make it thicker, used beef broth to replace the water and bouillon, added chopped potatos and I made this on my stove in a soup pot. I did not have time to use the slow cooker that day and it was wonderful.

A great, easy, and hearty vegetable soup. My family really enjoyed it with some warm Jiffy cornbread. I made it per the directions except that I did it all in a stock pot on the stove. I had to add a lot more broth to bring it to the soup consistency I wanted, and the leftovers will need more broth still. Personally, I didn't think the barley was even necessary as the vegetable taste overpowered it.

This is the best beef vegetable soup I've ever had!  I followed the "short-cut" instructions from other reviews (throw in everything but the barley and salt, cook for 10 hours on low), but ommitted the salt, added two dashes worcestershire, and subbed brown sugar for white.  It was wonderful, and this is my first time making beef vegetable soup, although others in my family make it often.  Very easy, forgiving, and flexible - a keeper!

Excellent soup!  The only thing I can add is that I had no broth left in the slow cooker after adding and cooking the barley with the roast - the broth was completely absorbed by the barley, but the soup was really outstanding. I wouldn't change it in any way.

This is a wonderful recipe! Each time I've made it, I get rave reviews. The only thing I really alter is I use my own beef stock, then use the meat from the bones (beef short ribs are amazing to flavor this!). I also use fresh veggies instead of frozen. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I think I must have done something wrong--I cooked my meat until tender, and it was so soft, in just fell apart, and then I added it to the remainder of the recipe, and in was just a mushy mess.  I think it would have been better if you cook the vegs. with the soup etc. all at once like some of the other reviews said.  It was o.k.

My husband's favorite winter meal.  I actually made it into a slow cooker recipe.  After the beef is cooked in the slow cooker, I add the rest and cook it for 4 to 5 hours on high.  It is really good.

This was a good basic soup.  I like to add different things to my soup, so my version was not true to the recipe but it did give me a good basis for the other thigs I like to add.  I only found instant barley at our grocery store but it worked o.k.

I'm only giving this a four because I used 1 extra cup of water/broth, but this thought it needed more -- the barley soaks up almost all the liquid (especially by day 2).  The flavor was good.  I did use red wine in addition to the water it called for to deepen the flavor.  I have a similar recipe I like more, but this is good nonetheless.

Needed more seasoning. As the recipe calls, the soup is somewhat bland and ordinary, but some fresh rosemary and thyme really perk it up.

I made some alterations to keep the whole thing in the slow cooker. I have to say it come out better, especially the second day, than I thought it would. I got a very chunky, meaty soup, but it took a long time to get the potatoes and carrots done. Also, it needs more barley, which got lost in all the rest of it. We also found that adding a little lime juice helped a lot to brighten the dish. All in all, not bad, quite tasty, but an all day affair. It could do with some re-working.

This was awesome, although I just used this recipe for a starting point.  I don't know where to even get barley so I used 3 lbs of leftover top sirloin roast, added two bags of frozen mixed veggies, chopped and boiled potatoes, 3 cups of water with beef bouillon cubes, about 8 oz of V-8 and some velveeta cheese.  It was the best my husband, sister and I have ever had.  Even the three 5 year olds ate it and LIKED it!

Great soup!! The only  changes I made was instead of water and bouillon I just used beef broth. I also had to add more liquid until is was as soupy as I desired. I also cooked my roast in one can of broth and seasoned the roast with worchestire sauce, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I froze it and have been eating it for days.

yes....this is good!  After reading the reviews, seems like there's many way to make it and it's still good. I cooked the 7 blade chuck in the water and bouillon 1st - then I had to deal with the fat so I'll try the original recipe next time !  Also only used a 14 oz. can of tomatoes and I liked it with the fewer tomatoes. Yummy !

This soup is best after it's sat together for a day.  I'm going to add more veggies next time, and make sure I cut up the beef into smaller bites, but the flavor is delicious!

I've made this several times with either venison, caribou or beef and it's excellent every time.  It's a nice chunky soup that has a nice thickness due to the barley.

We loved this.  I had to make a few alterations due to a tomato allergy and because I didn't have any roast.  I used ground beef, 1/4 cup balsalmic vinegar, and 1 can artichoke hearts in place of the tomatoes.

This was awesome! We recently went on a ski trip and I had made this the night before so that we would have hot soup after hitting the slopes. (We kept it in one of those thermo-electric warmers in the car). OMG!! We couldn't get enough of this. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my dad when he was sick and wouldn't eat anything.  Needless to say he was eating bowl after bowl of this stuff and he still talks about it.  Not to mention how wonderful it made my kitchen smell.  I will be definitely making this again.  Hopefully under more positive circumstances.

This was really easy and very good.  I made the roast as directed - dry in the crock pot.  The meat was very tender and I was able to cut it into small cubes which I prefer for soups.  I followed the recipe except I added 1 cup of red wine and Better Than Bouillon Beef Base.  I also didn't add the barley back to the pot until right before serving.  Makes a lot - flavor was rich and wonderful.  Will make again.

This soup was a big hit with my coworkers. I added 3 cups more broth because I used instant barley - will use long cooking next time. I don't see where it tells you how much liquid to cook the meat in in the crock pot so I added 2 cups of beef broth. Also used fresh and canned veggies instead of frozen. Will add some potato next time.Very tasty recipe.

My favorite recipe of all time!! I have made this soup with left over prime rib as well as with shredded stew meat. It is very forgiving and you can make it quite quickly if need be. I use aboutl half of the tomatos and a little more pepper. Definantly a keeper!!

I have made this several times and in large quanities. I usually omit the mixed veggies and just use a little carrot and celery. This ends up so fantastic. I could eat it twice a week.

Anyone looking for a fantastic soup recipe STOP LOOKING it's right here. My husband came home one day and said he need to take a pot of soup to work the next day for a soup and salad potluck, thank goodness I found this recipe, it was a big hit at his work (the crock pot came home empty). The mother-in-law makes a similar soup that he has raved about for years but now he says mine is way better than hers. Until that day I had never even thought of trying to make something so complicated (at least thats what I thought) but it goes together fairly easy and the whole family loves it, including the kids. The only thing I change is I use beef base instead of the bouillon cubes. Totally awesome

This was alright. A bit blah, not quite what I was expecting. I also don't like to put much work into soups or stuff that goes in a crock pot, so its a lot easier to throw the veggies and stuff right into the crock pot instead of wasting time on the stove. That would be the best time to put in the barley too as some of it dried up because there wasn't quite enough meat juice to get to them. I ended up adding a lot more barley, water, and boullion cubes and there still wasn't enough broth. I'm going to have to dig up my mom's version...much better! (My husband did like this though. I just thought it was boring.)Oh yeah, I nixed the tomatoes, I'm not a fan of tomatoes in my beef and barley soup, or any beef soup for that matter. Tomatoes = tomato soup or chili and that's about it in my world!

yummy. This is a great recipe. I have used stew meat instead of the roast. I took my stew meat and browned it first then I followed the recipe except I have not used the frozen mixed veggies. Try it. It speaks homemade.

This is GREAT! Even my husband who is not a big stew or soup fan, says this is awesome everytime we have it.  I made it during a Big Cook, preparing for our new baby and it freezes very well.  I believe we got 5 meals out of one recipe.  I made it exactly by the recipe and the only thing I would do differently next time is add more barley.  Thanks for the great winter recipe!

My family gobbled this up.  My husband usually finds my soup don't have enough taste  but he loved this one.  You can really mix and match the ingredients to suit your family's likes.

This is a great recipe. No need to brown the meat first. I cook the meat a day in advance, refrigerate, and then skim off some of the fat. Much better flavor than Campbell's.

Great tasting recipe. My kids and husband wondered what in the world I had fixed when they looked at it in their bowls but the skeptics were soon hushed as they ate every drop and licked their bowls clean. I fixed it to the letter of the recipe and it turned out great. What a wonderful, healthy and satisfying meal. I'm very glad I tried this one. We weren't disappointed.

I have just come in and edited my original rating of this recipe.  I have been making this soup in winter for 7 years now and it is a family favorite.  Slow cooking the beef makes it so tender.
I would say this soup is actually closer to a stew, so I usually increase the amount of beef stock to make it soupier.
It is definitely better on the 2nd day when all the flavors have developed more, and I also find it freezes well.
My kids (aged 5 and 1) also love this soup.
Delicious with crusty bread.

I followed the recipe exactly - but in my case it was necesary to add another 8 cups water/ 8 cubes beef bouillon just to get it  to a "thick soup state"  I had an army to feed and it did the trick.  Absolutely delicious!

I substituted caribou for the beef in this recipe, and used a turnip and a few potatoes in place of the frozen mixed vegetables. As other reviewers suggested, I added the barley towards the end of the cooking time (which for me was about 10 hours). In fact, there wasn't room in my crock pot for the barley, so I had to cook it separately and combine it with the rest of the soup in a bigger stovetop pot at the end. This dish was wonderful. We ate it all week long without ever getting tired of it, and it just kept getting better and better. Highly recommended!

I cooked my roast overnight in the crockpot w/ 1 can broth and bayleaves. Only used 1/2 the roast and frozen vegies, strained broth from pot, fat lifted off,& three potatoes cubed.
 It filled my pot to the rim. Was ready in three hours but added some mashed potato flakes to thicken a bit. 
sure didn't look appetizing but tasted fantastic. Even my kids liked it. I just wish it was thicker. 
would make it again.

Even though this recipe required a few extra steps, it was well worth it!  Everyone loved it and my husband who told me he hated beef barley soup (after I had already started cooking it) couldn't get enough of it.  Thanks for this recipe.  I'll make it often!

This recipe was good. It makes a ton of soup! I have a large crockpot and it was to the brim with soup! I used stew meat and risotto rice. I didn't have barley on hand and didn't want to go to the store. I'm sure it would have been better with barley. They kids weren't real in to it, but they were also sick.

Easy and tasty recipe to make.  I use canned mixed veggies instead of frozen, they are not as tough to chew.  My family loves it.  It is even good when made with little meatballs instead of beef cubes.

This soup is delicious! I used less meat (2.5 lbs) since I could not find a 3 lb package in the store,  then increased the barley by 1/4 cup. It was still a bit too much meat for me so next time (and there will be a next time-so yummy!) I will use half the meat and double the barley. The amount of vegetables was perfect.

I did not have mixed veggies. Used frozen corn and frozen peas. Fresh carrots and celery. A little garlic. Beef was cubed previously roasted. I had cubed fire roasted tomato’s so that is what I used. Forgot the sugar but added some dried tomato’s. Put it all in the crock pot except barley. Added 4 additional cups of water as it looked too thick. Used 3/4 cups of barley. Will use 1 to 1 1/4 next time. Absolutely delicious. Made one giant bowl for dinner and three quart containers for later.

Flavor is great, but the roast does not need 4-5 hours in a crockpot on high. More like 3.

Amazing.  Didn’t follow directions exactly, used leftover prime rib, added all ingredients except frozen mixed veggies and barley, to crockpot cooked all day on low.  1/2 hour before serving turned to night, added frozen mixed veggies and barley.  Easy and delicious!

I've made vegetable beef soup for many years but always put in ingredients "by eye"...didn't use a recipe.  This recipe is very close to what I always did and we love it.  I put everything in the slow cooker at the same time and used beef stew meat. Added diced tomatoes and frozen vegies.  Also used a 32 oz can of beef broth instead of the bouillon, cubes.

I followed the editors notes and with the exception of needing to add 4 cups of aditional broth it turned out great. ( Because I made it a little early, I belive the barley must have soaked up the liquid)
 I will definitely make this again!

Incredibly good. Marinated cubed meat with Montreal Steak seasoning, Worcestershire and red wine vinegar for a while and then cooked everything in the slow cooker for about 10 hours (except added the barley during the last hour). I think I also tossed the beef in flour and browned it first so it didn't shred. Skipped the mixed veggies and added potato, mushrooms, corn, carrots, green beans. I think I also pre-cooked the onions, and sauteed the mushrooms in sherry. Might try cooking the beef with broth the day before like many reviews suggest and then throwing everything together.

Very good and easy recipe.  I used leftover tri tip that we had bbq/smoked. I added potatoes and more barley as we like a thicker soup.  Good flavor and easy to make.

This is a huge hit and I have made it several times. I add all the ingredients at the beginning with the exception of the barley. I let it run all day ~10 hours. I add the barley for about the last 20 minutes and it comes out great every time!

Very good veggie soup.  Much easier than the way my mom makes it (which is amazing soup), but I need a faster cooking method.  
*Used 3 cans tomatoes because we like a stronger tomato base soup.
*Added an extra bullion cube because of the extra tomato liquid.
*Didn't have frozen mixed veggies, so added frozen corn, frozen peas separately and a few fresh green beans.
*Added an extra stalk of celery (4 total - would have added more if I had room in the crock).
*added quinoa instead of barley for last 45 minutes instead of barley since there is more nutrition in quinoa.  Quinoa was good.  Next time I might try Farro to see which I like better.

I saved this recipe a while back and finally made it yesterday and it was delicious! I halved the recipe. Added a sweet onion rather than the green onion. Also added 4 garlic cloves and some fresh mushrooms. All the flavors meld very well. I made fried garlic Rye bread to go with it. Just put a tablespoon of sunflower oil in a pan, make sure the oil is hot. Brown Rye bread on both sides, let cool slightly and rub garlic clove on the bread. Or you can get frozen garlic cubes at the store and use that also. It went so well with this soup!

This recipe was awesome.  I had leftover roast from a previous meal, so simmered a cup of beef stock with the bay leaf for about 20 minutes.  Then I  removed the bay leaf and put the broth on the cut up pieces of roast, along with all the other ingredients.  Let it cook on low for about an hour.

Good soup! It will fill you up!
I had chopped onions,carrots and celery that I needed to use or lose, also had 2 small potatoes that I added.
To me it needed more spice, so I added some Old Bay seasoning to it. 
I cooked mine on the stove, but will try to do crock pot next time.
Now what do I use all this left over barley in, I have two peanut butter jars full, and I only cook for two!??

This is a great soup version of Sunday roast dinner. I made it in my Instant Pot and it turned out wonderfully! Sautéed the beef (with the onions, my preference) in the pot, added everything else, and cooked on high for 20 minutes. Beef was tender, barley was perfect, vegetables were cooked.

I make this soup through all seasons...it freezes well in individual portions.
I make this soup on the stove top and use no water or bullion cubes, instead, I use Bone broth from turkey, chicken and beef
it is found in the supermarket and all 3 ingredients in the bone broth results in the most heavenly and nutritious soup.
I also use beef shank for the meet and it is such a tasty beef cut.
Use the bones of the meat in the cooking, removing when serving.
People ask me for this recipe after it is served in my home
Thank you for this recipe.

I have been making this recipe for 2 years now. Excellent, hearty soup and have 4 containers for freezer lunches left over for my construction  worker room mate. The only change I made was not adding the frozen veggies as I add turnip and lightly browned mushrooms into the mix. I also up the barley to 1 cup because we like it. Top up liquid if required during stove top simmer.

I made this for 20 servings. I listened to other reviews and threw it all together.  I used stew meat that I seared first.  I used fresh carrots and celery then a can of corn and green beans. I used beef broth instead of water. I also cooked it on the stove top. It's amazing and I haven't even added the barley yet. This is going to be a great seller.

I add more fresh veggies, and use beef broth 3cups. Then saute veggies and add 1c. water, if I don't have stewed tomatoes, our store runs out of them, I use diced. Otherwise this is a great crowd pleaser!

This soup was really delish! I seasoned the meat ( chopped sirloin) with McCormicks Montreal Steak seasoning and worstershire sauce. I added celery to the onion and carrots. Otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. Very tasty!

I had a big, ole beef bone with lots of marrow so I found this soup recipe to help me make beef barley soup. I didn't completely follow the recipe, but close enough. I used the beef cut from the bone, and the broth of course. I used fresh celery, but dehydrated carrots and onions. The rest of the seasonings came from the recipe. My husband raved about it. I'll make it again!

I used my mom's old pressure cooker (its at least 50 years old) to cook the beef roast after braising in there first.  That left the drippings and a bit of olive oil to cook up celery and onions.  It's nice to do everything in one pot!  Less mess!

I used all the same ingredients except I wanted to use a crockpot. Braised meat in some oil, then added to crockpot. Sautéed onion in a tablespoon of butter and added to crockpot along with 4 cups beef broth, and bay leaf and cooked for 4 hrs on high. Added barley, chopped carrots, and celery along with tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt & pepper and 2 cups beef broth. Cooked in crockpot another 1 1/2 hours.  There wasn’t any left by halftime of the super bowl.

This soup is amazing!  I did the stove top method in the editors note.  Worked perfectly. I did add a little thyme and oregano, and had to add one more cup water with dissolved bullion cube. Delish!

I used Stew beef instead of cooking chuck roast.  Sauteed fresh vegetables, added beef back in, added beef broth & put in oven at 375 for 3 hours.  Last hour I added frozen corn & green beans with 1/2c barley.  Everyone loved it!  Served it with savory brown bread.

I used low sodium chicken broth in place of water. I also used beef  “Better Than Bullion” instead of cubes or powder. I added chopped cabbage to the sautéed veggies. It was delicious and easy. The only tricky part was pulling apart the cooled chuck roast.

For the most part, I followed the "stovetop" version of the recipe to a "T".... just substituted beef broth instead of water/beef cubes, and added a cup of wild rice and 2 more cups of beef broth and a second can of diced tomatoes.  What a hearty soup!!

Although my family is not usually fond of soup or vegetables, this is one soup that  gets eaten to the last drop every time. I find that as long as the meat/broth/barley/vegetable ratio is followed, the types of veggies can vary widely with great results.

So good. So easy. So healthy. 
I used  cut the recipe in half  and followed the stove-top method, and used about a pound of leftover pot roast, diced. 
Spouse loves it!

This is a fantastic soup! I made a couple small changes: I used diced tomatoes, rather than stewed; I used beef broth, rather than bouillon (and added a little sea salt because of the lower salt content); and I used stew meat, rather than a roast, because it's what I had. This was a huge hit, even for the picky kid. 10/10 will make again.

I used the stove top method to make this soup. Cut water to 2 cups and added 4 cups of beef broth. Simmered for 2 hours. Was amazed how good this was since there were not a lot of spices in the recipe.

I've been using this recipe for at least 5 years, it's awesome. I change some things and add mushrooms. I recently got an instant pot and I make the meat in the instant pot, searing and then pressure cook with 2 onions for 1 hr. Then I shred and cook the rest in a stock pot on the stove. Never disappointed!

Delicious!
I made the stovetop version.
Browned the meat and then sauteed the onion in the same pan. When onion was cooking, I deglazed the pan with a half cup of red wine and added the stew meat back into the pan and gave the meat and onion a quick mix before adding 4 cups of beef stock and 4 cups of water with 4 bullion cubes. I also added a teaspoon of basil, oregano, thyme, salt, and minced garlic. Added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and 28 ounces of diced fire roasted tomatoes. Used two bags of mixed veges and added cooked rice the last 45 minutes. Even better a couple days later.

Awesome soup! I used stew meat, and I forgot the bay leaf and the mixed veggies. But I doubled the carrots and the onion I used was really big. I also doubled The Barley like I saw some other people did, and it was good, but that was really a lot of barley. I didn't have 10 hours, so I cooked it on high for 6 hours and it turned out excellent.

Okay.   The beef should have been cut up vs just shredded from a big slab.  Too stringy (know I know for next time).  Would also prefer more barley.

This is a flavorful hearty soup.  There is not a lot of broth, which suits my family just fine. I made it according to the recipe. The chuck roast is the perfect cut of meat, but I did skim off the fat after the meat was cooked.  Next time I might skim the fat before adding the barley.

This was exactly the taste I've always wanted in a homemade vegetable beef soup. I added in some precooked and diced potatoes in the soup boiling section. My skeptical kids LOVED the soup!!!

Very tasty!  I made this in my dutch oven following their directions.  I added about 1/2 cup of V-8 juice which gave it a little zing.   Will definitely make it again!

I followed suggestions of other chefs and put all items  (save the barley) in the crock pot overnight on low.  Let it rest in the refrigerator during the work day, then skimmed off the fat before re-heating.  On the side, I made the barley following package directions until all the liquid was absorbed, then added it to the reheated soup for about 30 minutes before serving!

The canned tomatoes turned this beef barley soup recipe into nothing more than glorified hamburger soup, minus the hamburger. I used homemade, super-reduce beef broth with homemade French onion soup stock, garden carrots, onions and celery, with fried sliced mushrooms but the canned tomatoes over-powered the robust beefy taste I normally achieve with other recipes.

Very good! My family ate it up! I seared the meat before adding it and put the vegetables on the bottom of the crock pot right from the start. I added 1 cup of barley the last hour. Only needed to cook about 6 hours on high.  Took some liquid out and thickened it with corn starch in a sauce pan. But I wouldn't do that if I was in a hurry.

This is the third time making it! It’s so so good. I don’t add Bay leaves because I almost choked on it once, when I forgot to take it out. So that’s the only change to the recipe. Try it! You’ll love it. 5/5 rating !

I used leftover smoked beef brisket that we had in the freezer instead of chuck roast and man oh man, this soup was out of this WORLD! I also used the stovetop directions, not the slow cooker version. This recipe is going into the rotation whenever my hubby does a beef brisket on the Big Green Egg. WOW!!!

This turned out great. I just wanted to mention that for those of you (like me) who are cutting the portion size in half that this stew will be fully ready in 7 hours on low in a slow cooker with barley added after 6. I sometimes forget when I’m cutting the portion size that cooking time is significantly reduced so keep an eye out!

I followed the stovetop recipe and it was spectacular!  I found that I needed to increase the broth to 6 cups rather than 4 cups.  I also minced the celery and onions and let it simmer an hour and half longer before adding the frozen vegetables.  It was my first time making beef barley soup.  I only hope that it will freeze well.  Next time I’ll half the recipe.

NIce and hearty.  I made as directed except omitted the celery and carrots as my frozen mixed vegetables already had them.  So I used two 10 oz. packages of those.  I also used low sodium beef broth from the box instead of cubes and water.  I did not saute the chopped onion but rather put it raw at the beginning.  Finally, I went ahead and cubed the chuck roasts before adding, rather than cubing them after cooking.  I used two chuck roasts with a total weight of about four lbs., but once I trimmed the fat they clocked in at 3.25 lbs. and this was fine.   I made this in my six quart slow cooker and the recipe about maxed it out.  When I was done I doled it out into  2.1 cup reusable/disposable containers to freeze and take to my elderly mom, who doesn't like to cook much anymore and who loves soup and stews.  I think I got eight of those from this batch, allowing for a little head-space for freezing.  The final product tasted great to me, and she enjoyed it as well.

Amazing and versatile recipe! It's easy to adjust veggies and barley to your taste or for a lower carb version. I usually use leftover beef roast and put it all in the crock pot on low for a few hours.

I used chuck stew beef, substituted beef stock and  cooked  in the crockpot for 5 hours on high.  I added baby bella mushrooms, a few petite potatoes, a pack of dry onion soup mix, and  8 ounces each of  frozen peas, lima beans, and  green beans in the last 30 minutes I used Quick cook barley and added in the last 10 minutes..  This recipe makes a lot of soup, but fortunately it is delicious! My husband loves it!!

I found that using pre-cut stewing beef works just as well as tediously chopping up a chuck roast; who has time for that?  I certainly don’t.  Also, I did not cook the beef alone in crock for 4 hours.  Again, a logistic hurdle that reaps negligible benefit, if any.  Here’s what I did:

Browned the beef tips in a skillet on high (gas), searing in juices.  Threw it in crock with all other ingredients as instructed.  Cooked on LOW for 10 hours, but in actuality it probably cooked longer, then left  on warm all next day. You cannot  “F#%!?” this up, the longer it cooks the better.  Wife said it was “amazing”, kids liked it too.  Lastly,  I used a can of crushed tomatoes in liiu of stewed, which enhances the viscosity.  That’s my 2 cents, do what you want.

As others have done, I put everything in a crock pot, doubled the barley and used beef broth instead of water and bullion.  I put all ingredients except barley and salt in crockpot and cooked it on low, then added the barley and salt during the last 20 minutes. For the frozen veg I added corn and peas plus more fresh carrots and celery.  I thought it turned out great and the meat was tender and moist.

I will definitely make this again. I added in extra barley which turned it into more of a stew. It was delicious. Next time, I will add more water if I add extra barley.

This recipe was delicious. I ran into a few minor obstacles since I live in Belgium.  They don’t eat barley here and looked at me cosseted when I asked about it in the store...in typical Belgian fashion, they sent me to a beer store for it. But, I settled on Arborio rice instead and it was ok.  Also, the only sell dried bay leave pieces...not whole, but it still seasoned well.  Overall it was a lovely recipe that I did on the stovetop.  Perfect for a rainy day.

This is a great recipe! The first time I made it I put all the ingredients in a slow cooker as someone has suggested would be easier and save time. I noticed that the vegetables were mushy, so the second time I made it I did it exactly the way the recipe was written, and it came out perfect. The meat was tender, and the vegetables were perfect. This is a dish I will make more often.

I loved the Recipe itself, but for someone who is good/experienced cook and "watching my Sodium" (as many people are), I know that ANY/ALL "Bouillion" adds no less than 1300mg of sodium per "cube". With that said, I used Grass-feed beef and just used Sea Salt and did the rest of the recipe as directed. Superb!

I followed the recipe except for the following exceptions. I used beef broth instead of bullion cubes and I added half a bell pepper I needed to us, as well as cutting the kernels off an extra ear of corn that I had on hand. The one thing I did that really went off the given plan was that I had beef stew meet that I had smoked for a couple of hours. This was a hearty soup that was filling and satisfying. I can see following the recipe more closely next time or using it for a base and adding extras that I have on hand.

Very good soup as is or a great base for experimenting. I usually do it on the stovetop with stock/broth, pearl onions, fresh vegetables, fresh basil and an additional  bouquet garni (bay leaves, thyme, parsley, crushed peppercorns & split garlic) in cheesecloth. Serve with a crusty baguette and a dollop of sour cream on top. Great in the fall or early spring.

Very tasty. Will make this again! As many of the reviews suggested, I did just add all ingredient's in slow cooker at one time, except for the barley which I added the last 40 minutes.

This was SO good, and perfect for cold nights!  I changed a few things based on personal preference and others' reviews.  

-I used stew meat. Browned small cubes in dutch oven and used that instead of crockpot. (Remove meat to saute onions)
-Omitted carrots and celery
-8 cups of bouillon
-1 cup pearl barley
-4 bay leaves, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp basil (all dried)
-about 1T fresh thyme and flat parsley
-1T worcestershire  

This method only needs to simmer for 2.5 hours or so, which is why I made it this way (ran out of time!).  The meat was very tender and good!  

After meat and onions are cooked, add all ingredients to pot EXCEPT barley and veggies.  Add barley in last hour.  Add frozen veggies in last half hour.

I followed the most helpful recommendations.  Cut up the roast, put everything in the crockpot ( except the barley).   Cooked on high 6 hours.  Added the barley and waited 45 minutes.  It was perfect.  I did sauté the celery first because I was nervous it would be  tough.  Skipped the carrot cause was in my mixed vegetables.  Skipped the onion and used onion powder due to picky kids.  Used 28 oz tomato sauce instead of chopped tomatoes also due to picky kids.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Served with French bread.

after i seared the beef, i deglazed the pan w/some beer; then put in slower cooker overnight for the beef to get tender (lid slightly open for evaporation) with the large can of  crushed tomatoes, beef broth (same amount as the can) and all the seasonings (thyme too).
in the morn, i added a bag frozen veg and some chopped up mushrooms. so comforting!

Recipe was great! I didn't have the time to cook it in a slow cooker so braised the beef in the oven and cooked the barley on the stove top then followed the recipe as if the beef had been cooking in the slow cooker for 4-5 hours. I used vegetable broth and water in place of just water. Turned out fabulous and leftovers are even better a day or two later!

I really just used this recipe as a guide and I made it on the stove top instead of in the slow cooker. I took advice from other reviews and added basil, oregano, and thyme for flavor. I also browned stew beef with Worcestershire sauce, pepper, onions, and a little bit of celery. I also used diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.

First time ever to make beef/veggie soup. Very easy and delicious! I put 2 of the 4 cups of water and 2 of the 4 cubes the recipe calls for in the crock pot with the roast.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Family and friends for dinner loved it!

The soup was delicious!  My only disappointment was that the chuck roast I used (recommend  in the recipe) was stringy and too much meat.  I would like to try this again with another cut of meat and less of it.

Good foundation for making. I made several changes after reading the reviews.
1. Placed everything in the crockpot except the barley , soup base, & salt. Cooked for 5 hrs. on high
2.Reuced the meat to 2lbs and used some beef soup bones.
3. Used 6 cups of water ,fresh veggies, chopped whole tomatoes. No sugar
4. Added rosemary, thyme, & dried  shallots .
5. After approx. 4 hrs. added beef soup base, salt, & pepper, and Worcestershire sauce to taste.
We loved Anne will make again.

I gave it a 5 star, because my soup was fabulous. I had 5 leftover beef ribs from a Rib Roast that I boiled to make my broth. (about 6-7 cups)  I followed the directions for the stove top version from there on out, minus adding water, and it was delicious.  Most of my meat was from the boiled bones and about an extra cup of diced left over from my roast.

Company has enjoyed this and my husband. The only thing I did different is instead of beef broth my husband makes onion soup with sauerkraut juice I use this instead of beef broth.  I also cook my barley on the side and we add it to the soup as we serve.  I found the barley soaks up the broth if left in the soup.  I also add shredded cabbage.

Turned out great! I blended the meat and vegetables in the last two hours in the crock pot to blend the flavors better than simmering on the stove. I also used stir fry vegetables, which gave a little crunch!

This was really savory for a cold winter day. 
Instead of the bag of mixed vegetables, I added a can of cubed potatoes, but kept everything else the same.  Iknow it would be great with the extra vegetables, too.

Good basic recipe.  Cooked beef in broth for about 45 minutes with onions at low heat.  I briefly sautéed the vegetables in butter before adding them to broth.  I thought broth gave better flavor than using bouillon cubes.

Made this recipe and did exactly as others suggested regarding placing everything in the crock pot. I did use about 3 cans of the canned beef broth and added the barley at the last 30 minutes. Very hearty and tasty. Will be making this again.

Just put it all in the crock pot and let it cook.  I was concerned that there wasn't any thyme or extra spices in it but I always try a recipe with the ingredients as is first. It  turned out FABULOUS!!!

My family rated this soup 5 stars.  I had to use more heart healthy eye of round beef roast and omitted all oil .   I cooked the beef separately the day before in crock pot.  Next day I cooked the vegetables and the rest of the soup on the stove.  Following advice of other reviewers, I doubled the broth, added 1 T Worchestershire,and 1 tsp basil.

Just cook in Crock pot for 10 hours or so and add barley last 20-25 minutes of cooking. Seen this review from another on this site and agree with her worked great. Also cut back on celery a little much and used a box of Swanson beef broth in place of water.

I read others experience and I made it mostly as directed.  My only changes were I used the mixed veggies and onions. No  celery but added minced garlic , 1 t. . My opinion is not to use as much meat and more  broth.  Other than that, it was delicious!  Thanks to my cooking family.

Nice to have on a cold day. The only change I made was I used a 2lb chuck roast instead of  3lb. I'm glad I did cause I think there was just enough meat.

I used all organic ingredients including  homemade bone, beef stock plus commercial consume. Added some organic nutritional yeast and some dry sherry...WOW ! I gave 2qts to a young family just home with their new baby. They wolfed all of it in one session. Very intense beef flavor. The base recipe is superior.

I added everything except the barley to the slow cooker and cooked on high for 5 hours. Added the barley 2 hours before I wanted to serve it. I only used one can of tomatoes.   Tasted it when I got home, it was very bland.  I added chopped garlic, dried thyme, dried oregano and a few dashes of worshirershire sauce.

I simplified it even more. I first browned stewing beef with the onions, then added all the ingredients at once, (minus the barley). I simmered it covered for 3 hours, added the barley and simmered for another hour. It turned out great! All veggies were soft, but kept their shape, and the beef was perfectly moist. Great recipe!

I cooked the meat first then sliced it on a power slicer and made approx 1/4 " cubes  I then cooked all the vegetables and added the ingredients and the meat and let it simmer for about an hour on Low. I  had enough to make 12 500 Mil bottles and I have been enjoying it a couple times a week. I am down to one bottle now so will likely double on on ingredients this time seeing it turned out so well.

Made stove top editors version.  I cut up meat, and the leftover fatty meat I cooked in 6 cups of water for the broth.   I personally did not add tomatoes, frozen vegetables, nor sugar.  Did have leftover veggies I added along with celery and carrots and onions.  Added 3/4 cup barley instead o 1/2 cup and another 4 cups of broth at the end.  Excellent soup - definitely a keeper. Nice hearty soup for sure!

A delicious meal with a salad and some French bread. I read the comments and added more barley, spices, and vegetables and I'm glad I did. I also cooked it for 10 hours on low. Next time I will try some Worcestershire sauce too. This recipe is a keeper with the modifications.

Although this is tasty I made a fair number of substitutions. First I don't do frozen mixed veg, so I added two extra chopped carrots, two large-ish potatoes chopped  and 8 oz package of sliced mushrooms and a cup of frozen peas at the end. I always add a can or two of tomatoes to all veggie soups this one no exception they were not stewed however. No bouillion, beef cubes and water used homemade beef stock instead.

Used Bob's Red Mill vegy soup mix and cooked on the stove for 45 minutes after browning stew meat. Good but need to add some spices.
Did not add sugar or stewed tomatoes.

Very good recipe!  Flavors  simmer nicely together.  

A fast variation for stove top that I did was used ground beef, brown it and saute fresh veggies with it (I added garlic, Worcestershire ,potatoes,  mushroom and green beans).  Drain.  Put ingredients back in large stock pot.  Double & add the beef broth, sugar and tomatoes.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 45 minutes. Serve with crusty bread.  Perfect.

I've made it in a instant pot pressure cooker in two stages. I've cooked the tomatoes with beef in first stage and the remaining ingredients in the second stage exactly as the recipe. It took about 1 hr 15 mins in total. Our family loves this family. I've made it a few times now and have saved it as favorite. Thank you for sharing.

I've made this soup several times without variations from the original recipe and I always get rave reviews -this is definitely my go-to beef barley soup recipe.

It was very good. I was surprised how sweet one tablespoon of sugar made the dish. Next time I'll decrease sugar a little, but that's the only change I'll make.

Very tasty! And fulfilling. However the soup is a bit sweet so next time I'll reduce the sugar to half a tablespoon.

So easy and quick. Great, hardy meal. Rather than bouillon and water, I used a box of beef stock. Came out fine.  Also a good way to get kids to eat veggies.

I made this soup and gave some to neighbors and we all loved it.  I am making it in January for a soup potluck we are having.  It was handy to use the frozen vegetables at the end.  I did everything in the crock pot which makes it much easier and less mess.  Twyla

I did what some others did, used more beef broth. I also added gem potatoes and mushrooms. I made it for a Church dinner so I needed to stretch it out.

My middle child hates soup on principle.  He LOVED this.  I left out the celery and used ground pork, added garlic powder.  My family wants me to double the barley next time.  Shared with several coworkers and family, too.

My husband loves this soup.  I make it almost exactly as the recipe calls for.  However I don't add the barley to the crockpot with the meat.  I put the barley in about 15 min before I am ready to serve the soup.  
Also, I used beef broth instead of water and beef flavoring.

Maybe it's me, but I like some herbs in my soups and stews and the salt and pepper just didn't cut it.  I made the recipe first and it was very bland.  Instead of a package of frozen vegetables, I just threw in a handful of frozen corn.  Otherwise it would have been too many vegetables.  Meat came out tender and it wasn't a bad recipe - just need to add some spice to it.

It was really good. I even got a compliment from my picky husband to make it again. My 3 year old ate just the meat but asked for 2nds. The only thing done different was I didn't have any onions so I did 1 tbsp dried onions and u cooked on stovetop in dutch oven for few hours because I cut up meat before cooking to cut down on time.

Loved it! Freezes very well too! I made this on the stove in my dutch oven, browned the beef chunks first, then sauteed the veggies. I also used beef broth instead of the water and cubes. Will definitely make again.

This is the best soup recipe I have ever made. I did use a two pound roast and two bags of veggies. I did not add extra carrots as they were in the frozen veggies. That is the only change I made and I just love this soup!

This was quick and good. I subbed a bag of peas and carrots for the chopped carrots, used a drained can of petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, left out the sugar and pepper and doubled the broth.   Very filling soup that is good for calorie counters (like me...haha).

I used leftover steak and threw everything in a pot (I used a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes instead of same size chopped stewed tomatoes) and let it boil for an hour then let it simmer on medium-low heat for another hour or more until it was time to eat.  It was delicious.  I served it with homemade corn bread. :-)

Pretty good flavor. Just cut up the chuck roast into smaller pieces and cook it with everything at once in the crockpot on high for about 4 hours to make it faster. Can also use frozen carrots and onions instead of fresh to make it easier.

I followed the recipe as is and added 3 cloves pressed garlic. I think that if you throw everything in the crockpot, it will come out more like a stew or pot roast. When I make it again, I will reduce the amount of sugar by half.

For my Gluten-Free family, I tried Quinoa instead of Barley. Quinoa is so mild and small that it basically just dissappeared into the soup. I followed the recipe, but left the Quinoa out until the last 20 minutes of the dish, when it's burbling on the stove. I also ended up adding 2 more cups of broth and water. I recommend this soup. It's a really hearty, good tasting soup that is great for winter. I think next time, though, I'll use rice and have less meat .

The flavor was delicious.  My only complaint is that it was way too thick for our liking so I added a Knorr's Stock-Bouillon cube and an additional 3 cups of water.  Once the beef/barley was done, I strained and kept the liquid and skimmed off the fat. Did not add any frozen veggies at all but did add a couple of cubed potatoes.

As with many others, I took this recipe as a base.  Used 3 lbs Stew meat, which I seasoned (Penzey's Turkish blend), dusted with flour and browned.  After every batch of browning I deglazed the pot with water and added that to the crockpot; chopped three large carrots, 3 large celery stalks, and one small onion.  Added one can of 28 oz stewed tomatoes (undrained), salt and pepper, and then mixed in some Italian seasoning for flavor.  Cooked on low for 6 1/2 hours then added 1/2 cup Quick Barley and continued to cook for 15 minutes.  At the very end I added 2 cups frozen veggie blend I partial cooked in microwave. Served with cornbread and it was great and super easy since most of the work done ahead of time.

I reduced the veggies and barley by about half and the beef to 8oz (leftover roast)because I only wanted supper and lunch. I ended up having to add all of the tomatoes and broth. It is still way too thick for soup, in my opinion. I think I'm going to freeze it as is to save space and add broth when I actually use it. I used the stove top method because I was trying to make a small amount and the slow cooker instructions seemed off. I think there is liquid missing, but maybe a 3lb roast really does release enough liquid to cook a cup of barley.

Excellent soup.  We used our home canned stewed tomatoes which had onions and garlic in them.  We also used our home canned carrots and frozen baby lima beans in place of the frozen mixed vegetables.  Other than that, this recipe gets 4 thumbs up --- my boyfriend and myself!!!

Very yummy but not enough barley, I added more the next day.  I didn't add the tomatoes and I did add bouquet garni because there wasn't any seasoning in this.  I will make this again.

really yummy! I followed the recipe except I didn't add the tomatoes. I also added more water because I added two bags of frozen vegetables. I added the frozen veggies about an hour or two before I served the soup! Definitely a keeper!

I just cut up the beef in bite size pieces and brown it then either make the soup in a pot on the stove, or dump it all in a crockport. I don't add the sugar, and I use beef or vegetable canned broth sometimes you need to add more water if cooking on the stove, and adjust the seasonings if needed to your taste. I don't always add barley either.

made from start to finish in the crock pot using up the last of venison in the freeze. Venison can be a bit tricky but using this method it was tender and moist. Added about 3 oz of tomato sauce also taking up space in my fridge. All in all good recipe. Thanks.

Tasted so delicious. I did it in a pressure cooker and it was done in about  30 - 40 minutes. Browned the beef first then removed it, sautéed the onion, carrots and celery with all the spices to wake up their flavor and added all the other ingredients. I used a can of tomato paste instead of stewed tomatoes and popped the lid on and voila!!

I saute the vegetables and then throw everything in a crockpot and cook on low for 8 hours.  We like it better without the roast but if you do put it in I would recommend half the amount.  It was more like a stew than a soup with 3 pounds in there.

Loved this soup! I did make changes based on other reviews and my own preferences.  First, I only precooked the beef; everything else just went raw into the crock in the morning.  I cut the beef into large pieces and seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning, cooked ~3 hours the night before and then cut into bite-sized pieces.  I left out the frozen veggies but used a whole 1-lb bag of carrots, added 3 large red potatoes in bite-sized pieces, and about 1 cup of butternut squash pieces as well. Left out the sugar and tomatoes, added a splash of soy sauce, upped the barley to 1 cup, and made about 10 cups of beef bouillon but only added enough to fill the crock.  I kept the extra 2 cups or so to add to leftovers.  I think this recipe was even better as leftovers.  Easy and delicious, smelled great to come home to!

Made this recipe today in the slow cooker today. I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes and used beef broth instead of bouillon cubes and water. I omitted the sugar and the salt. It turned out fabulous. I would make this again.

Cooked on the stove.  Totally awesome!  The chuck roast yielded an awesome broth.  Very seldom do I rate a recipe as 5 star but this was one of those times.

Great Soup!! I really enjoyed flavor of soup. I could not find beef bouillion at the store, so instead I replace with beef base powder and also used thinner meat to cook and it only took an hour to cook and boil in soup. Overall great recipe!! Thank you very much!!

I cut up a chuck roast and put it, the fresh veggies, 4 cups of beef broth, the spices (including a tablespoon of worsteshire sauce and a tsp of thyme) and half of the tomatoes (not a huge fan) in the crock pot and cooked on low for 5 hours.  Then I added in the frozen veggies and cooked for 3 more hours and then added 3/4 cup barley to cook for the last hour.  It was perfectly cooked, but a little bland, even with adding the worsteshire sauce and thyme.  It was very a hearty meal and I will make it again, just with some more spices.

The only change I made was to substitute beef stock for the water/bouillon.  I made the soup a day before I planned to serve it so that I could refrigerate it and then skim the accumulated fat before reheating and serving.  The soup was full of flavor and full of veggies.  Next time around I might add additional barley.

Fantastic!  Oh so easy with prior reviews as a guide.  Meat, broth, package of frozen veggie soup mix, tomatoes.... just throw it all into the crock pot for the day and stick the barley in at the last hour.  Couldn't get any easier for a fantastic meal.

I found this soup to be bland, I went back to check to see if I left anything out and I forgot garlic.  I will have to see how it is tomorrow.

This was just okay for us.  I guess we just like a smoother soup without all the chunks.

This is very tasty.  However, I followed others reviews and added more barley (1 cup).  It was a big mistake since I abhor oatmeal.  Next time I will leave the barley out all together.  I also use stew meat that i cooked in slow cooker with one cup of beef broth.  Like I said,  excellent soup flavor but I couldn't tolerate the barley.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a very awesome soup! I had so many compliments and people wanting the recipe it was unbelievable! The only thing I did different was to add a high quality roast that was 4 1/2 lbs. that I hand cubed. Very, very good!!!

This soup was so good I couldn't even believe that I made it LOL I did make a few a adjustments just to speed up the time.  I browned the meat in olive oil than sauteed onions and garlic and steamed the veggies just a bit.  I did add some Worcestershire and it was absolutely perfect will defiantly make again and very soon.

Tasty soup.  I bought some cubed stewing beef and just threw everything into the slowcooker for the day.  Much easier as I was pressed for time.  I also used homemade beef stock in place of the water and the stock cubes.   This recipe is worth a try.

Made it twice now, it's a nice hearty soup.  I used beef stew instead of the chuck and then tore it into shreds once it was cooked.  I used beef broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes, made it nice and rich.  Everybody ate it up, delicious.

Used a chuck roast (less expensive than beef stew) and 32 oz. carton beef stock.  I prefer fesh veggies, so I cut up a sweet potato, rutabaga, frozen corn, green beans. Very colorful. Also used Italian seasoned ( basil & garlic)canned tomatoes. Put everything inot the crock pot. roast fell apart.

This was really good and easy.  I had leftover shredded beef in its juice from a dinner a couple nites ago.  I threw this in the crockpot along with all other ingredients except the barley.  Let it go all day and added the barley when the veggies were done.  Excellent!!  I used broth instead of boullion.  I'll make this again.  Thanks.

I was somewhat hesitant to toss everything in my slow cooker without browning the roast for additional flavor, but based on other positive reviews, I took a chance.  Absolutely delicious.  Tossing in the barley for the last 30 minutes was just right.  Other than the cooking style, I made no modifications to the original recipe and was very pleased.

This was very good.  I changed a few things:  I used venison steaks (backstraps) instead of the roast.  I sauteed the veggies I used in butter before putting them in the crock pot.  I also used a jar of salsa instead of the canned tomatoes, I added some diced tomatoes that I had frozen this summer.  I also added some green peppers that I had frozed.  I added some Thyme and Basil.  I left out the frozen veggies called for.

This really is excellent and easy.  I add the beef and broth and let it 'do its thing' in the crock pot for a couple hours, then added fresh chopped green beans, carrots and onions.  I also added some frozen corn.  I was happy when both of my parents had seconds!

Thanks for sharing this! I cooked everything in the crock pot. It makes quite a bit. My parents were over when I made this, they took some home and called the next day wanting the recipe as well....(I also used low sodium beef broth instead of water). It's great as leftovers too...

After reading many of the reviews, I used stew beef instead of roast and put everything in the crockpot at the same time except for the barley. I also added a packet of dry beef onion soup mix and cooked for the full ten hours. I don't eat beef but it smelled great and my husbands only suggestion was that it may be better if the beef was shredded..Said it was more like a stew than a soup with beef chunks.

An EXCELLENT SOUP!!!  Whatever veggies you put in will be fine, the main thing is the seasonings and the meat you prefer.  I used a chuck roast, (easier to cut up after cooking) I added a can of beef broth as I had extra meat and veggies & probably a little extra barley.  I go heavy on spices ALWAYS.  I didn't add vegetables while cooking meat as I used fresh and didn't want them "mushy".  30 minutes or so does it, but it is a personal preference. Can't wait to make this again!!!

I used venison for this soup and my sons and husband loved it.  Personally, I think I needed to soak the venison in some milk for a bit longer than an hour.  I don't like the gamey taste of the venison but will try it with beef next time for a 5 star rating!

This soup was excellent! I used stew meat and marinated it overnight in Worcheshire sauce, garlic and Monreal Steak Seasoning. The next day I browned the meat and sauted the carrots, onions and celery before putting it all together on high in the crockpot. It was excellent and made about 17 (1 cup) servings. I used 1 cup barley and it was a bit much for me. I also used 6 cups broth and I think 8 would have been fine. Overall, a very good recipe.

Fantastic!!  My family ate it up and asked for more!  It made enough for an army though.  There are 5 in my family and we were eating it leftover for a week, yet it was still delicious every time. Next time I will double the amount of barley.  I added potatoes and corn to the soup and they were an excellent addition.

Amazing!  It's my boyfriend's new favorite. Hearty and comfort food at it's best.  It's one of the easiest things I make to boot!  Definitely try it.  Love the barley, too.  Hearty, a bit of a change from the usual routine with pasta, rice, etc. and lots of heart healthy fiber. Seriously...yum!

This recipe was just average for me and my husband.  I added some thyme and italian seasoning, plus some mushrooms.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  We did eat all the left overs without complaint.

I used her recipe as a base and other reviews to make a delicious soup! Thanks so much for the basics! I cut my meat up first, then dredged it in flour and browned it in my stock pot. Then I added one small box of beef broth and let it simmer. After that I added onions, celery, carrots, potatoes, garlic, a large handful of barley and two cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano. I also added a second box of beef broth, two bay leaves, some parsley, some thyme, and salt and pepper. I added a little water to top it all off and let it cook as long as possible. The best beef barley soup I have ever had!! Thanks so much for all the help!!

Very very good recipie. I added 2 more cups of water and 2 boulion cubes to make the soup go further for a fundraiser. It was a hit!!! It was the second soup to become empty out of about 10 different soups (and second only because I divided it between 2 crockpots.)

I was looking for a recipe to use leftover roast from Sunday dinner.  I used my roast, but I shredded the meat and threw everything in the crock pot in the morning before work.  8 hours later had yummy soup! Thanks for the recipe!

Not my favorite recipe. My husband really liked it but since I'm the cook in the house, I decide what goes on the table! (Not really, I just thought that sounded good. I'll probably have to make it for him again soon)

This soup was very good. I, like others, added additional seasonings and I also threw in some worchesshire sauce to give the broth a little depth.  Delicious!

I thought this was ok, but my husband didn't like it. I'm not sure what went wrong because we like a lot of different vegetable soups. It did taste sweet to me, so if I tried it again I'd leave out the sugar.

The barley in the crockpot turned out mushy- so I ended up not using the barley out of the crockpot, I just cooked the barley seperate and added it to the soup.  Excellent flavor!  I let it all cook together on the stove for about an hour to let all the flavors meld.

I followed the suggestions from previous reviews. I cooked the stew meat in a crockpot for several hours. I stored it overnight in the refridgerator. Then I added all the ingredients except the barley. I cooked the soup in the crockpot for the day. An hour before serving, I added the barley. It was very thick so I added another cup of water. 5 out of 6 people in our house loved it. Those are pretty good odds around here!

Tasty yummy good.  I put a whole box of Quaker instant barley because I could find no other kind at the store.  As suggested, I out in everything this morning into a crockpot (after browning the meat a bit in a pan with some evoo and pepper)and put in the barley for about half an hour.  With the homemade honey wheat bread from yesterday-we ready for  tasty meal!

Ingredients make for a tasty soup.  I cooked the meat then added it to a pot with the other ingredients  so I didn't have the fat from the meat in the soup.  Maybe I needed to buy a less fatty piece of beef.

My family loves this soup. It is so easy it practically makes itself. I start it before I go to work, finish it up when I get home and everyone just gobbles it up. They always ask for seconds. I've found it to be perfect as is and didn't need any changes.

Yum!  I didn't add the oil or frozen vegetables (just did carrots, celery, onion, canned tomatos). Did add a little basil, oregano, and garlic halfway through too.  I also didn't read the directions right and put the barley in at the beginning with everything else - it turned out great anyway! The barley can only soak up so much of the liquid.  It was thick and savory.  Thank you!

I really enjoyed making this one.  The smells permiating the house as it cooked all day was well worth the wait.  I wouldn't shorten up the process at all.  The soup was awsome and can easily be modified slighly for items you may want to add or subtrack. Thank you for sharing!!

3 pounds of meat is a lot.  I made the crock pot version recommended by some reviewers and it turned out great, but very, very meaty.  Next time I will cut the chuck roast in half.

What a wonderful recipe!  I did not cut the meat up very much, because it just fell apart.  My husband also loved the larger chuncks of meat in this soup.

Very good....I used beef chuck stew meat already cubed, 5c. beef stock instead of the water and boullion, a bag of frozen mixed veggies(corn,peas,carrots,and green beans), 1 can of diced fire roasted tomatoes in their juice, and increased the barley to 2/3c, also added S&P and dried thyme. Threw it all in the crockpot and let it go for about 7-8 hours. Hearty and delicious. Great dinner for a cold night!

Love this recipe.  Great for a cold day and makes enough leftovers for the week.  I omit some of the tomatoes and usually get about a 2lb roast.

I am not a big vegetable soup soon fan, but it was good.  I didn't measure the ground pepper and put a little too much of that in, but other than that--my own error--it was fine.  The only comment my wife made was that it didn't have enough "fat" in it.  I guess that means that this is pretty healthy recipe.

This recipe is GREAT!   I've tried many beef-vegetable slow cooker recipes and my husband finally likes one.  He says this is the best soup I ever made!

I did things the lazy way though.  I used cubed Chuck roast meat, browned it and threw everything int he crock pot all together.  I didn't sear any veggies or cook the meat in the crock first, just put it all together at the same time and called it a day.  Turned out great.   Already have my second "batch" in the slow cooker today!

WAY too much beef.  Use less than half what the recipe calls for... or better yet, DOUBLE everything else. This keeps fabulously.
Otherwise, GREAT flavor.  I'd also probably add more barley, too.

This is so delicious!  I put everything in a crockpot and cooked on low for 10 hours.  I added the barley about 30 minutes before I served it but it was still too hard.  We ate it anyway, but I left the rest in the crockpot to cook on low for 3 more hours and it is now out of this world.  Next time I will make the soup before I go to bed and leave it on low overnight.

This was great!  My husband grilled steaks the night before.  I cut up the leftovers instead of using fresh meat.  The grill added great flavors and made the dish even easier and faster than ever.  I'll definitely make this again.

WOW! Great recipe. I did add a can of beef broth when I slow cooked the beef. That made it so tender that it just fell apart. I followed the recipe exactly, I think next time I would add more barley, and a bit less wine. I used a cabernet which was a pretty powerful taste. Cant wait to try the leftovers today.

I have made this recipe time and time again - it always turns out great!  I too use beef broth instead of the water and it adds a little extra flavor.  I have also made it without the barley and it is just as good.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was average/good. Made a nice meal but none of us loved it so much that I plan on making it again. Was a nice recipe.

Great soup!  I tried to follow the recipe, but there wasn't enough broth in the slow cooker when I cooked the meat. I added the barley later with the water and boullion.

This was very good.  I cut up the roast and cooked everything together. When reheating extra water added in is a must.

I scaled this from ten servings to five and it still made a LOT of soup. I had some prime rib roast left over from Christmas and I thought beef barley soup would be a good way to use it up. I did add more broth than called for so I would have more soup and I added five small red potatoes. I will use more barley next time. My wife didn't like it as much as I did so I'm giving it four stars. MMMMM good!

This recipe was simple to make and turned out great.  A little thick so I added more stock.  Leftovers were great.  My son said "Mom, how can something that looks this gross, taste soooo good!"  What do you expect...he's 7!

This was great.  I was a little confused since I don't cook much.  When I put the roast in the crock pot I didn't know if it needed water or not.  I decided to put some in and everything turned out great.  I tried to skim fat from the top as it went along so I didn't think it was very greasy.  I would try it out.  It really was good!

Wow, this is delicious!  Just made it yesterday to take to some elderly sick friends, and was able to sample it since it makes quite a bit.  Really tasty!  I did add another 2 cups of water, and 2 more cubes of buillon.  Glad I did that, as I think it would've been way too thick otherwise.  Other than that, followed the directions.  Very good soup for a cool day and makes excellent leftovers!

The only thing that made this time consuming was the slow cooking the meat the day before!  That's SO easy, but takes some planning.  I added two more carrot sticks and another 1/2 c barley.  I also used beef broth instead of the water/boullon cubes which worked out GREAT!  It's easy and takes VERY HOMEADE!  My family LOVED IT!  No need to add salt/pepper at the end.

Really good, really hearty, and best of all, really easy.  I used canned beef broth instead of bouillon, and it had a great taste. The frozen veggies are another great addition.  We had this for dinner as a one dish meal.  Enjoy!

This was a great soup. Very hearty, meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and easy. I was a little confused by the instructions, but if I erred, it was on the side of great!

I loved this soup and have made it many times since finding this recipe. I don't take the the time to use the slow-cooker(Which I am sure would make the meat more tender!!),I fry or roast it in the oven!!!

I made this recipe using the method suggested by ROBNSTEF and it was incredibly easy.  My husband raved about it but I thought it was a bit salty (maybe the bouillon cubes?) Will probably make again with a few modifications.

This was amazing.  It has certainly become a staple in my recipe box.  I didn't have too much time so I cooked the roast in the oven and the barley on the stove in some beef broth.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor was amazing.  It was so hearty and healthy tasting.  I will definitely be eating this again.

I used the basic recipe to get me started, then I went off on my own with other ingredients and order of cooking. I did brown the meat before putting it in the Crock-Pot, and I never took the meat out once it went in. Pretty good soup with leftovers to freeze for another time.

I've made this twice now and everyone loves it (except the nine year old, but he doesn't like much). I followed the suggestion that has you cook the meat over night with montreal seasoning and add the barley half hour before serving. I did use stewed tomatotes and left them big so the kids could push them aside if they wanted, too. Great for busy parents!

11/16 - I used stir fry veggies with baby corns and now the nine year old loves it, too!

Use a large pot.  Makes a lot.  More barley, less beef okay.  Mixture of beef broth and boullion works nicely.  Only sauteed the onions.  Frozen veg and celery can go in direct.

I doubled the amount of barley, eliminated the celery (for a family member who doesn't like celery), used low sodium canned tomatoes and used low sodium beef broth in place of the water and beef boullion to reduce the sodium content. This soup is so delicious and freezes well.

Oh wow! This was great! I didn't follow the directions well, but it still turned out awesome. I cooked the meat (I used venison steaks) in the slow cooker with a large can of beef broth and a chicken bouillon cube and 1 cup water. Which I still used for the soup. But I did add an additional small can of beef broth and 2 cubes of bouillon with 8 oz. water. I didn't have frozen veggies so I used canned. I added extra celery and onions. Also doubled the barley like some of the reviews mentioned. I also added ground red pepper to add more zip. My family loved it, even my kids! Look forward to making it again!!!!!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I am so clueless when it comes to cooking and had NO idea what barley even was (you should have seen me at the grocery store looking for it!). If you are just as clueless as I am, I finally found the barley (with some assistance) in the ethnic food section. I will make this recipe again.

Very good! Used left-over beef roast and threw all in a crock-pot. A nice hearty meal on a cold November night!

This is by far the best soup I've ever made - it's actually more like a stew, as it is so thick and scrumptious.  I've made it twice in the past week.  My husband just loves it.  I made some Italian Herb bread in my bread machine to go along with the soup ~ spectacular meal!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I thought this soup was very good, my husband liked it okay.  Very easy to put together, and it smells so good when its cooking.  I put in more vegetables and a little more seasoning.  I like my soups very salty.  Will make this one again.

Real easy to do, but just took awhile because the meat had to cook for awhile.  Otherwise, really good filling soup.

This is a great soup recipe. With a few minor changes it was something that even my picky husband liked. I left out the oil,replaced the tomatoes with beef broth and it was still great.Will make this again.

This soup was a big hit! Great for lunches the next day.  Only suggestion is to skim off fat from the beef/barley mixture.

Finally, a great beef soup! It may take longer to make due to the use of the crock pot but it is worth it. Toni Q

Great soup! I used stew meat and left out the tomatoes (kids wouldn't eat them). Needed more salt. I will make this again.
