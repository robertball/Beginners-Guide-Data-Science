Tasty and easy to make, I think next time I will use shredded Parmesan instead of grated.

Excellent!  I prepared according to the recipe and had it as my dinner tonight.  I used 4 good sized garlic cloves.  The recipe says five but garlic cloves vary in size quite a bit so I just had to wing it - I really love garlic so was quite pleased.

Lots of compliments at Easter Brunch. I used Asiago instead of Parmesan. I will definitely make this again!
