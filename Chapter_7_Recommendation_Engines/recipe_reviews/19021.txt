My sister and I made this recipe for my parents anniversary party and it was incredibly delicious.  I wonder if the other reviewer used butter flavored or microwave popcorn.  My sister and I used plain popcorn popped the old fashioned way in a pot with oil.

I took this to my family for our Christmas party.  It was the joke of the party.  If you attempt this one, it was very salty, and buttery.  You might want to sweeten it up a bit and add more cinnamon.

I agree with the other person...this was WAY too salty and buttery and I DID use an 'on the stove' type popper with oil!!  REALLY yucky and not sweet or cinnamon flavored...I'd definately use MORE cinnamon, NO salt, sugar and more food coloring (cinnamon popcorn isn't pink...it's RED!)

I made this a while ago, but i used a tablespoon of oil and some margarine to for corn, just so they were coated.
once they had popped, i put them aside in a bowl and in another pan i melted some buttery margarine added some sugar and cinnamon until a thick paste formed, i then added it to the popcorn, but tested it first to see if it was sweet enough.

I make this every year. I was given this recipe when i was a freshman in college. I microwave my popcorn without butter or salt. I put 1/4 cup of popcorn kernels in a brown lunch bag and microwave for about 1:30 minutes. I then pour on topping and bake in oven for the hour to dry it out. I get requests for this recipe all the time.

I used unsalted butter and Airpopped corn. Still was way buttery and I couldnt taste the cinnamon oil at all. I will have to search for another recipe. Darn. Good thing popcorn is cheap.
