04-05-16 ~ My husband loved this version of sloppys made with venison rather than hamburger. I made as written and he enjoyed them for several days in his lunch. He asked that I made them again, using this recipe. Based on his review, not mine "5-stars, for sure".

These were so good. I made a few modifications. I browned the venison with jalapenos and garlic, and use brown sugar in place of the molasses because it's what I had on hand. I've never put jalapenos in sloppy joes until now but it totally works and really adds a nice flavor. I topped with pickles and pickled jalapenos. If you want to kick it up another notch, red chili flakes would work really well in these as well. Great recipe!!

My picky teenage daughter even lived this!  I didn't have a jalape√±o on hand, so I added pickled peppers and pickles instead.  I also added some Worcestire sauce and a couple of splashes of chipotle Tabasco.  I buttered and grilled the buns.  Turned out great!! I made a bit more sauce because we like it sloppy!  I will definitely make this again!
