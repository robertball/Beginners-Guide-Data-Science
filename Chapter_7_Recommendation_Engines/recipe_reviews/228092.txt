I cooked onions and the broccoli in EVOO and a little sesame oil. Then added the chicken on one side of the same pan. When it was cooked through, I added all the honey and ginger. I also added some amino acids. Everyone loved it!

No joke this recipe is amazing!! I don't own a wok so I used a frying pan and it turned out marvelous. I cooked chicken until it was kind of crispy then added the honey and ginger for a few then removed it onto a dish. I then cooked the rest of the veggies and added the rest of the honey when the veggies were about done. I only had a green bell and it turned out fine. Thanks for the great recipe, this will be in my family's rotation!!

The family loved this meal - had a good sweet but zesty sauce. I cut down the honey just a bit and also added sesame seeds. Definitely a keeper!

I'm putting this as a 4 because I really liked it, but my husband found it too sweet - and he loves honey. I liked the sweetness and the spice of the ginger. I also added two cloves of garlic and one teaspoon of crushed red chilli peppers, so that might've added some zing as well. My sauce was a little watery, so I added two teaspoons of corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit. Very tasty with minor changes.

Loved it!  I used already grilled chicken breasts which really cut down on the cooking time so it was quick and easy.  The leftovers were even good on the second day.

my mistake was not making the recipe exactly as written the first time.  I read a few reviews and decided to cook my veggies a little more.  That was a bad move.  overcooked veggies.  Also, I had only two breasts so I made a smaller amount, but when tasting it - found it so bland that I ended up adding soy sauce,  red pepper flakes and more ginger and honey.  I am going to try again and do the recipe right the first time.

Added mushrooms - a little too sweet for husband, but he said put it in the regular line-up anyway.

I had some fresh pineapple leftover from a fruit tray and some veggies from veggie tray.  What a delicious way to make that veggie tray go farther!   I thought it might be too sweet but it was delicious!  I had to used ground ginger (1 tsp) because I didn't have fresh.  I also added 2 T of soy sauce.  I also mixed 2 T of corn starch with some cold water and added it with the simmer because I like a thicker sauce.  Veggies added: green and red peppers, carrots, broccoli, celery and some frozen peas.

My family liked this recipe but I think we would have liked it more with a bit less ginger and honey (maybe because I didn't have as many veggies though) Also, next time, I think I'll try browning the the chicken first to make it a bit crispy on the outside before adding honey. I had run out of broccoli so added sliced carrots and extra red peppers.

Really easy, quick and delicious! Serve with rice or solo. I added garlic with the honey, ginger and chicken. Then, I added sliced mushrooms with the rest of vegetables and pineapple. My husband had seconds, so he must have liked this recipe.

Very delicious. Did cook the chicken first so I didn't miss out on the tasty bits left behind in the skillet, plus I didn't want the veggies to get soggy. I've omitted sugar for a year now, but honey is great in moderation. I put a dab of sugar free apricot preserves in the mix to increase sweetness and a bit of soy sauce and hot chilli sauce. Just a few tweaks to make it my own. Thanks.

This was quick and easy, I used frozen mango because that is what I had. Would rather have more seasoning but will definitely keep this recipe on hand!
