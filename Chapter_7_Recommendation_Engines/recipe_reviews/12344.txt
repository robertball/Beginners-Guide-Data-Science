I have waited almost six years to rate this recipe. I lived in China for 4 of those years teaching at a university.  My students were eager to learn about American customs, holidays, food etc, but less interested in food because they were sure that McD's fully represented that genre.  So I wanted to introduce real Am food. But Chinese kitchens do not have ovens, so we had to buy a toaster oven.  They also only have tiny rolling pins to make Chinese dumplings - jiaozi.  So this recipe was my answer.  Well, six years later I have made several hundred apple, pumpkin, minced meat, turkey pot, chicken pot, chocolate, blueberry, peach and probably a few other kinds of pies using this recipe.  Top crusts are made by patting out onto a piece of plastic wrap on a plate.  I have only great things to say about the results!!!  Thanks for wonderful memories, great tastes and cross-cultural fun!

This pie dough was very strange and oily when I was trying to pat it in the pie pan. A rolling pin does make it easier to get a consistant thickness in the crust (next time) but figured I'd give it a go. Had enough dough to also make a small tart so as an experiment I prebaked the tart shell for 10 minutes before pouring the sweet potato pie in it. Both pie crusts were very good especially since they are much healthier (used canola oil). The prebaked shell had a little more texture, both were crisp and had good color around the edge. Very good flavor (not oily in my opinion) but I used the "Pecan Sweet Potato Pie" recipe which is sooo good that the crust is secondary. I will definitely use this recipe from now on but will use a little less oil, 1 teaspoon sugar, and less water to start. Probably prebake the crust too but either way ... very easy and healthier ... won't be going back to butter or Crisco.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I've always made my crusts with butter and/ or shortening, so they were fairly time-consuming & difficult to work with.  But I whipped this crust up in 5 minutes, & it was delicious-- flaky, tender, & crisp (my pie crusts have tended to be soggy).  I'm so glad I discovered this recipe at the beginning of summer so I can use it for all my fresh fruit pies!!

Christmas morning as I was prepping my desserts, I found out the frozen pie shells I bought were all broken up.  I figure I would just make one myself, only to find out that I did not have any shortening and all the stores are close for Christmas.  

I did a search for pie crust with no shortening and found this site.  What a great relief!!  This is the easiest pie crust ever!!  I was a bit skeptical at first considering I was going to make a crumb apple pie and a pecan pie and one of the reviews mentioned it was quite salty while another review mentioned it is best for quiche but not as a dessert pie crust.

I did not want to take a chance on it being to salty, so I put less salt than it asked for.  I was going to try to use smart balance instead of oil but did not want to be to aggressive, so I used canola oil in lieue of peanut oil.  I do intend to use whole wheat flour and splenda next time and I will post a review for it when I did.

Overall, both apple and pecan pies turned out better than if I would have used a store bought frozen pie shell/crust.

This pie crust tasted so wonderfull and especially easy and mess free.  I definitely will email this recipe to everyone I know.

I really enjoyed this recipe! It was simple and quick to make. I made 2 sweet potato pies using this recipe. With the first pie, I press the dough into pie pan. That worked very well. With my second pie, I actually put the dough ball in between two pieces of wax paper and rolled it out using the palm of my hand. (I discovered that it actually works just as good, if not better than using a rolling pin.) This is too worked very well. 

As for the taste, great. The texture was wonderful. It was very flaky and hearty. Unlike other reviews, I did not find the crust dry, rather it complimented my pie filling well. 

I will never buy another storebrand pie crust or slave again to make homemade pie crust. 

This recipe was fabulous! Thanks again!

I will never make a pie crust with unhealthy shortening again.  I use canola oil for a heart-healthier crust.  Roll this between two sheets of waxed paper.  Couldn't be easier.

This makes a decent pie crust.  Honestly, pie crust is just better with shortening or lard, but I will keep using this recipe for health reasons. I made pumpkin pie with it. In order to get the crust to hold to the walls of my no-stick pie pan, I had to chill the pan with the dough in it for 15 minutes or so, and then push it up the sides.  After chilling it kept its form well.

I found this recipe here a few months ago when I needed a pie crust, but had no rolling pin.  Now, many pies and praises later, it is the only one I use.  It is very simple, and turns out perfect everytime. A definite 5 stars!!

I had no shortening in the house so I tried this recipe.  I love it!!  No pastry blending or rolling dough out getting flour everywhere!!  It well served it's purpose as a pie crust... and quite frankly, even if I have shortening I will probably make this one instead.  This was the easiest dang pie crust I have EVER made... and tasty too!

This deserves 5 stars for it's practicality alone! As a grad student, time and money are both limited, and this crust fits the bill. Here in France we make-up 'tarte'(a quiche type of dish with more cream and less egg) with all the rests in our fridge, much like in America casseroles are invented. So, I use this recipe quite often, and have even gotten compliments! Taking the time to make a real crust will never be worth it again, as this tastes quite nice. However, I doubt I would use this recipe for a dessert type pie; this is for salty food only. 'Chapeau Bas' to the originator of this recipe!

Ok - I wasn't sure about this recipe but this is a keeper!  So easy - light and flaky.  I did  a double batch for a two crust pit - it wasn't the prettiest pie I ever made but the taste made up for the less than perfect looking crust.  I did put the dough into the refrigertor, in rounds and then gently rolled rather that pat - still - was super easy and delicious!  UPDATE:  I did this again - 4 batches (used Canola Oil) and rolled on a floured mat.  Lined the pie pans and let rest in the refrigerator.  Filled topped and baked.  They are GREAT.  So easy.

I was looking for a simple pie crust recipe that did not contain loads of lard or other nastiness. All The ready-make ones from the store were full of hydrogenated fats too.  This pie crust is the hands down winner.  This is a great no mess pie crust AND not as unhealthy as many other recipes.  Win win.  Mix all the ingredients with a spoon directly in the pie pan and then just press and shape!  Couldn't be easier.  I substituted 1/2 C of the flour with whole wheat flour for my pumpkin pie crust and it was perfect.  I upped it to 1C whole wheat and it turned out too tough.  I also bake it for 20 minutes at 375 before filling it with the pumpkin pie mixture.  I also would not lighten up on the oil content, I tried and you really lose a lot of the flakiness and contributes to toughness.  This is a super recipe for any pie whether it be sweet or savory.  Happy baking!

My grandma has been using this for years and our whole family loves it! One other thing that she will do is instead of patting it out for a top crust she will just use the crumbled dough on top and make a crumb top.

I have never made a pie crust and I will never try another one either! This was the best crust I have ever had. I used it to make a blackberry and raspberry pie. I was a little worried because some of the reviews said it was a better crust for salty things rather than sweet so I substituted 1/4 tsp of the salt for cinnamon sugar....then I rolled out a top layer for the pie between 2 pieces of wax paper and brushed egg and sprinkled sugar on top and it was amazing!

I used canola oil instead of peanut oil and found this crust to be very easy to prepare-much easier than the shortening recipes.  The crust was flaky and very good and I found it to be better than the shortening crusts so we are kissing those pie crust recipes with shortening goodbye forever!  I didn't press this into the pan. Rolling between 2 sheets of waxed paper made this easy and mess free and simple to transfer to the pie pan, just roll, turn the paper over the pie pan and peel off the waxed paper.  Couldn't be easier!

Definetely easy to make, which is a plus. A bit difficult to make even without a rolling pin, but it's not a dealbreaker. Make sure you dont't make it too thick - It never browned for me so I just kept baking it, and overcooked it, otherwise great recipe overall.

Not the best pie crust I've ever tasted, but the total ease of preparation makes up for that! Like the recipe says, it definitely is a great choice when a top crust isn't necessary, because I find, for me anyway, flakiness isn't necessarily something I want in the bottom crust. This seemed to me like it made a little too much dough for a 9-inch pie pan, but it might have been perfect for a 9-inch deep dish, I'm not sure, I only had regular. It also seemed rather greasy to me, but as I've never made a traditional pie crust with butter or shortening, I'm not sure if this was more or less greasy than the traditional way. All in all, not a bad tasting crust and way easy!

I love this recipe!  I could never make a pie because I could never make pie crust. But this is the easiest and quickest. I made two crusts and was able to roll one out between plastic wrap to make a top crust for my apple pie. It was delicious. Definitely recommend this.

Not bad at all - was actually able to get a crust in the pie pan in one piece which is a bloody miracle for me!  Did pre-bake for 1 0mins at 425 and then added a quite thick spinach, leek and ricotta filling and still found the base a bit under done after baking for additional 45 mins at 375 so may want to pre-bake longer, (maybe an extra 5 mins at), if you are making a similar filling.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy and tasty! Honestly, crusts are not my favorite part of a pie, but this was fast, easy and does not include crisco. I used this for a Dutch apple pie and it was perfect. After reading some of the reviews, I used only 1/4 tsp salt, and I used the smart balance vegetable oil that I had on hand. I prebaked it for 5 minutes before adding the pie filling. I will never even consider using crisco in a crust now! Thanks for the recipe!

** I just used this recipe with Namaste Gluten Free Flour blend and melted coconut oil for a fruit pie, and it also worked wonderfully. The texture is a little denser, which I suspect is from the gluten free flour.

Flakey, yummy! So easy and with items I always have on hand. I did 2 fruit pies, then did a savory one and added some italian seasoning to the dough. They were all excellent. I will be using this crust from now on for all my pie crust needs!

Instead of the oil, use slightly less than 1/2 cup cold butter, cut in by hand using a pastry blender until it looks like damp beach sand and turn out into a pie plate. Use the back of a spoon to press the dough against the pie plate. Butter is just better. This makes a flaky crust. Double the recipe for a two-crust pie. UPDATE: 1/5/10-I used this recipe to make a savory pie over Christmas and this time used olive oil that I put in the freezer for an hour beforehand to make it good and cold. After mixing, I put the prepared dough into the freezer for another 1/2 hour then pre-baked it for 15 minutes to set in pan. Turned out great!

This was easy and DELICIOUS! It was said to be "the best pie crust on this Earth!" Someone even told me it was and I quote, "This is comparable, (after the second bite) no scratch that, this is BETTER than Marie Calender's crusts!!!" Now there's a compliment! :o) Thanks so much for the post! You've made me better than famous! lol

An excellent recipe for when you're in a hurry.  Definitely more a crust than pastry, so if you realize that this comparison is pointless, you'll enjoy it.  I have made this in part with olive oil for a rustic tart and it tasted very good.  I have also made a top crust with this recipe, simply smoothing it out between two sheets of baking paper, and it worked fine.

Really good, easy pie crust. I used this for a chicken pot pie I made for Sunday dinner and it was perfect. I doubled the recipe and followed another reviewers suggestion to roll the dough out between two sheets of plastic wrap for the top crust.

A good, quick substitute for a regular butter/shortening crust.  When baked and filled, it's still a pretty light pastry crust.  I'll definitely use this again when I'm crunched for time!

I made this recipe for pie crust not knowing what to expect.  It turned out well, no one made any issues with the taste, but I found it very hard to flute the edges with a handsome border.  I usually get lots of compliments on the how pleasing to the eye my pies look.  Not this one!  It was right down ugly!

Fabulous! Easy! Seriously took five minutes to make a double batch! I used canola oil and unbleached flour. Best with savory dishes verses sweet. I poked it with a fork all over and blind baked it for a shepard's pie. Everyone had seconds! YUM!

Healthier version... I used whole wheat pastry flour and canola oil. I brushed with  a small amount of beaten egg before adding my filling for a blackberry tart. The result was tender with great flavor. I previously made this with white flour and canola which was also good, but like the whole wheat version much better.

This pie crust was so easy and tasted great. I used vegetable oil and 1/4 tsp of salt. I did have to add a little extra water because it was slightly dry. I made pumpkin pie which had to be baked for an hour and the crust didn't burn at all.

Simplicity alone gave this recipe a good rating.  I can take the foundation of this recipe and "tweak" it to fit my needs.  It works for sweet or savory pies.  I make it with canola oil and whole wheat flour.  I just reduce the salt a little and add a bit of brown sugar and/or cinnamon for sweeter dishes. I have rolled it between 2 sheets of wax paper and that works too.

I can't begin to tell you how much I love this recipe.  I thought I'd never be able to make a pie again.  I use it most often for quiche or pot pies.  I prefer olive oil and use that instead and think the flavor is good with it.  Thanks for giving me the ability to make pies!

For such a simple recipe this was amazingly good. I especially liked that it did not shrink when baked. It was pretty flaky and tender. Certainly worth it when you want pie, but don't want to spend a ton of time on the crust.

I tried making this with peanut oil at first. Then realized the flavor was overpoweringly "peanutty" so I made another batch with canola oil and a few drops peanut oil. That added a nice touch without being overpowering anymore.

This was a nice easy recipe...it was great to make a pie crust without having to roll it out. I made this with Donna's Cheesy Quiche (from this site), and it came out great. Not sure if it would be as good with a sweet pie or not......

I don't have that 'light touch' needed for traditional pie crusts so this was a perfect fit for me!  I put it between two pieces of waxed paper to spread it enough to top a chicken pot pie.  This recipe nice surprise.

I really wanted to love this recipe. I make a lot of pies and am tired of making crusts from scratch sometimes. I've been making crusts for over 25 years. I found this crust to be dry, tough and lacking in flavor and won't use this recipe again.

Great Pie Crust and So easy! I used this as a crust for a last minute quiche and was amazed at how flaky it was. I used safflower oil since I did not have any peanut oil.  I will definitely be making this again. Thank you Karin

VERY GOOD!  The simplicity of the recipe concerned me ... no sugar, no milk, etc. but I tried it as is only substituting peanut oil with canola oil and olive oil mixture.  
Pressing it to the pan took awhile for me since I was very concerned about it being even throughout.  I then stuck it in the freezer while I worked on my apple pie filling.  When I took
it out of the freezer it was rather dry and hard looking.  
Like the other reviewers, I was impressed with the result.  It only did not get a five star because there was a very "pressed" feel to the crust and was not the light flakey taste but hey, it's not that kind of recipe.  
And also, that may be me pressing it too much trying to get it evenly distributed.
The crust turned out crispy and tasty.  I will use this recipe again even when I do get my rolling pin back.  (I may try rolling it next time to save time on pressing).
I used to buy Marie Callendar's premade crust which was excellent but gets pricey and inconvenient.  I'll be doing this instead when in a pinch and don't feel like rolling out a crust.

This is the best pie crust ever. I love how easy is is to make and use. I even use it for top crusts; just place on waxed paper and pat out to the needed size and place on top of pie. I gave this recipe to my sister who could never make pie crust and she has now started baking pies both single crust and double crust. I don't use peanut oil however, I use canola oil and have even used olive oil for savory pies like chicken pot pies, YUM. I plan to make this my only pie crust and will continue to encourage others to try it.

The ease and simplicity of this recipe, alone, deserves 5 stars*****
Any oil can be used and many additives, depending on your pie, work well too!

You've got to try this pie crust! I'm so happy I found this, I made an apple pie for Thanksgiving in Sept with fresh apples, cooked it half way, froze it, and baked it the rest on t-day. The top and bottom crust were great, it just takes a little coordination getting the top crust onto the pie. It is somehow still flaky and I don't dread making a homemade crust because it only takes a couple minutes.

This was strange.  It seemed goopy at first and I reread the directions to make sure I had enough flour and I did it anyway. Easy to do, tasted okay, flaky, BUT this stuck horribly.  Weird being made with oil that it would stick and the first piece did not make it out of the shell looking half way decent.  Will try to make this again because it was so easy to do, but would rather not use this again and take the time to make a crust that you must roll.  I do like the idea, just don't like having to scrape off the crust from the baking dish.

This was alright if you're in a pinch for time.  I'm glad I followed the suggestion to use 1/2c whole wheat flour (also cutting the salt by half) as it gave the crust a little more flavor and texture.

This crust was superb! I decided to make an attempt at my first homemade apple pie, and wanted to try something simple. This turned out fabulously, although I did add a little bit of sugar and cinnamon to the mixture (which worked out very nicely).

Excellent. So simple and easy, it was exactly what I was looking for. This is my new go-to pie crust recipe. As per others' suggestions, I use the full amount of salt for a savory pie, or 1/4 tsp each of sugar and salt for sweet pies.

easy and quick to prepare with little to no mess.  makes a great crust! i get tons of compliments... i use 1c white flour and 1/2c white whole wheat flour by king arthur to add a little fiber, and canola instead of peanut oil because of allergies.

A great basic no roll pie crust.  I used this for a banana cream pie and just sprinkled some sugar on the pie before baking.  The result was a good flaky pie crust which only took minutes to make.  The pie itself was wonderful and the crust was not soggy.  I think this deserves a 5 star because it did exactly what the recipe intended.

I was really, really hoping this would turn out to be a 5 star easy crust recipe. But, it is not. The taste is definitely in my opinion, just 1 star if even that. For quickness, it would get a 5, as it is super easy. My family however, goes for flavor. This one did not work well. I used this recipe for Quiche. We ALL ended up peeling the crust off the Quiche, and just eating the egg mixture. We tossed the crust. If you can imagine what a mess of flour mixed with oil would taste like, then you have a feel for what this recipe tastes like. I am really disappointed, b/c it would have been great to find wonderful tasting, quick crust. I'll keep trying. :0

I had been dreading learning to make my own pie crust because it seemed so messy and labor-intensive, but today I tried it with this recipe and it turned out fantastic! It took me 5 minutes to throw the ingredients together, then I blind baked it before using it for my quiche, and it was perfect. Instead of having to remember to pick up pie crusts at the store, I can just throw this together; it really is so easy.

Very good! Loved the flavor! I used Canola oil instead because that's what I had on hand. I used this for a beef pot pie and it was a hit! My 3 and 1 year olds loved the crust! I deff. will use this again and will try it with pumpkin over the weekend!

Great recipe, I cut it to  2/3 scale to make a 9 inch bottom and 1 1/2 to do a 9x13 cobbler bottom.  I mixed it in the same pan I used it in both times and it came out great.   I did bake it for 10 minutes before I filled it, because the carmel apple pie I was using had comments about soggy crust.

Absolutely great for the chicken pot pie I made last night, but a COMPLETE DISASTER for the lemon meringue pie!!! Chicken Pot Pie:  I pressed the crust into the pan, filled & baked the whole thing to perfection.  So easy!  Five stars!! Lemon Meringue:  I pressed it in the pan, it slid down before I could get the filling in, so I pressed again & refrigerated.  It slid down again, so I could not pre-bake it.  So I went for it.  Huge mistake.  I kept baking & baking until my meringue was tan all over & still, it did not set up past the cm or so that stuck out from the meringue.  I should have known better, it's my own fault.  Don't make the same mistake I did!

The 1st time I attempted this recipe was for lemon meringue pie and I found the vegetable oil had too strong a flavour - greasy tasting.  I made it again for quiche using melted margarine and it turned out excellent.  I also tried making 2 batches for an apple pie, and found that if you chill the dough you are able to roll it out for slicing if you want to make a cross hatch top crust. This is a great vegan pie crust recipe!

I just made this pie crust for a quiche that I was making. I could not believe how easy it was to prepare and to flatten to fit the pie pan. Initially thought that it would be too greasy...but I prebaked for about 15 minutes before adding the quiche ingrediants and it came out perfect, delicious and flakey. Thank you for a great recipe.

I tried this recipe and the other No Roll Pie Crust recipe on this site, head to head.  The other one was better.

Excellent pie crust. So easy to make, and with ingredients that are always on hand. It was very flaky and satisfying. I'll never be intimidated by pie crusts again.

This was just wonderful!!  I tripled the recipe and used Safflower oil instead of vegetable or peanut, and only 1 tsp. of salt since I made this crust for a pot pie and the filling was already salty. I also spread not more than a tblspn. of butter over top of crust for a browning effect.  This is for sure a keeper.

I just used this for apple dumplings and it worked great! I doubled the recipe, formed 6 balls, flattened on counter, and formed around apples. I think my usual dough would have been hard to work with. I'll be using this again-Thanks!!!

I have to admit it:  I was skeptical.  However, I was also very desperately without shortening or butter (I know, I know... How could I be completely out of such ordinary kitchen staples!?).  The crust wasn't as flaky as others, but it definitely did the trick in my pumpkin pie.  I can certainly buy in to the validity that this crust recipe would work splendidly with a salty-type pie as well as sweet.  Thanks Karin!

I used vegtable oil instead of peanut oil and this crust turned out to be my best ever! I am so pleased. There was enough for me to make a top & bottom crust too! Since I dont have a rolling pin here, I just smoothed out the top crust between two pieces of wax paper with my fingers. Also, before baking I brushed the top with a little milk and sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar. Delish!

This is the first really successful pie crust I've ever made!  I always have a hard time with rolling out traditional crusts.  I was wary of this recipe because of the oil (I made it with vegetable oil because that's what I had) and it turned out great!  I made a dutch apple pie with it and it held together without crumbling, but wasn't tough.  The only issue I had was that I wasn't able to push enough crust up on the sides to properly flute the edges.  I used a 9 in. dish.   An 8 in. would've probably worked a little better.

Very simple to make. It's my go-to recipe now. I made 6 pumpkin pies over Thanksgiving. It is a light crust. Not tough at all.

This was a super easy and fast pie crust recipe!  I added the ingredients to my bowl, used my handheld mixer to mix together for 30 seconds, gathered the dough together in a ball, and pressed it into my pie plate.  The dough is rather oily, but it makes it so easy to spread into the pan.  I prebaked the crust in a 375 degree oven for 20 min., and the oiliness absorbs right in.  I made this for a quick chocolate pie.  The crust isn't flaky, which I wasn't expecting it to be for it being so fast and easy.  It is more of a crumbly type of crust.  So it may not be something you would prefer for sweet pies if you want a flaky crust.  But overall it was a great easy crust when your needing one on a whim!  Thank you for the recipe!

I have always hated the mess and production of making my own pie crust so became lazy and used ready made store bought.  I decided to try this given all the great reviews and preference for cooking from scratch.  All I can say is, WOW!  This sure looked weird while I was working with it but it baked up beautifully and tasted heavenly.  I used canola oil since I did not have peanut oil on hand.  I doubled the recipe and made a lattice top by rolling the top layer between 2 layers of wax paper.  It was challenging to lift and place the strips on the pie, and there were many breaks but it all looked great when it was done.  I made the Fresh Blueberry Pie 1 from this site (which makes a fabulous pie) and sprinkled a little sugar on the top layer.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

To update, over time, I was missing that buttery taste in pie crust so I’ve started replacing 1/2 the oil with melted butter. Oh my!  Heaven!

Great and healthy BUT there needs to be a little more flour in this recipe. I have made this type of pie crust for years and lost my recipe which was published maybe 40 years ago. I would start with adding 1/4 c flour and finish the mixing with one hand as you can feel the play dough like consistency. And why does no one roll out the dough between wax paper, which makes it simple and able to roll a thin crust. Of course I usually add a little flour on the paper as needed. This is truly an  easy crust to make!

This tasted amazing as a crust for Chicken Pot Pie IX!  I only had coconut oil so used that.  I cannot imagine a better oil for best flavor.  Very easy to mix together two seperate crusts.  I patted the first one into the pie plate and pressed the top crust onto a piece of tinfoil then inverted onto pie filling and peeled foil off.  Not a pretty crust, but pretty darn good!

I can't believe how easy this recipe is! It deserved more positive reviews. Absolutely amazing pie crust. I also cut down the oil a bit and added slightly less water. Pulsed all the ingredients together in my food processor and pressed into my pan. For ease alone, this recipe is absolutely deserving of 5 stars!

This is the same recipe I used to make my first pie when I was 8 yrs old. I lived in the mountains in California and went out and picked fresh blackberries by the stream then made my pie. The crust tasted good by didnt look so good, lol.   I make this crust when my arthritis is acting up, it is easier on my back.  I am now 57 and have taught my grandkids to make this crust as well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I used this for a quiche and it was perfect.  Quick to throw together and baked nicely.  Not a typical flaky crust, but great for a no-fuss alternative.

This makes an excellent and really east crust! I used it in an 11 inch tart pan with removable bottom to make the fudge pie recipe from this site. Fantastic! I make it a sweet crust with 2 tablespoons of sugar and cut the salt in half. I also didn't use as much oil as called for. Crispy, flaky and far more stable than I would have expected. Slid right out of the pan and off the bottom with no cracking or falling apart. I will never make pie crust the hard way again!

This is a terrific pie crust. I use it all the time. All you have to do to roll it out just right is put it between 2 sheets of wax paper and use a rolling pin. Not to mention you don't actually have to use peanut oil, I've used Canola, Vegetable, and Corn oil with this recipe and it yields the same results. This saves money since everything you need is probably right there in your cupboard.

I LOVE this pie crust recipe.  This is the only one that I use anymore.  I usually add 2 tbsp sugar to the dough, only when I'm making a more mild pie.  I find that it helps to give the crust a touch of sweet.  When I make pumpkin pies, I add just a dash of ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, and all spice to the dough.  Perfect!

This is not as delicious as the traditional crust with butter or shortening, but it is much more healthy ---that is, if you use light-tasting olive oil, or organic canola oil. Also, it's much much easier than a traditional pie crust.  However, it's probably a little more difficult if you need to double & make a top crust. Great for vegans.

I thought that I would try this recipe instead of going to buy shortening, however, it was not as tasty as the shortening pie crusts or the store bought pie crust.  I will try again before deleting this recipe from my folder.

I want you to know that I dont normally make pie crusts but I made a home made potpie the other night using THIS CRUST and it was AMAZING. 
It was EASY, FAST, AND TASTED FABULOUS. My husband said it was the best pie crust he ever had. It was crispy and flaky. Thanks so much for sharing this. I will never buy another pie crust again.

This is an absolutely great pie crust recipe. The crust will come out flaky, buttery and golden, so if you're like me and have a hard time getting that perfect pie crust result with traditional rolling pin recipes, try this.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I rarely ever made my own pie crust before; but this was so easy and delicious, not to mention healthier.  I will be baking more pies and using this recipe!

I used corn oil, as I did not have peanut oil on hand.  I quadrupled the recipe to for my quiche and it was excellent!  I also used it for an apple crumb pie, and it worked well for that as well.  For both dishes, I placed the crust into 4 or 5 inch pie tins.  Very easy to use, cost effective, and practical.  Thanks a bunch for the recipe.  I will definitely being using over and over again! :-)

this crust works best when you only need a bottom crust. It also would help if you bake the crust for 10 min, cooling, and then place the filling. I found my bottom crust to be too gooey. It was very difficult to make a top crust with recipe because it does not roll out easily. tastes good though, but not flakey.

Very simple and quick, and perfect for the recipe I used.  I made the Walnut Honey Rum Pie on here and it calls for an unbaked pie crust, so that's what I went with and it worked just fine.  this is very flaky and is pretty easy to press in the pan.  I ended up with a small ball of extra dough, but I think my pie pan is small (it's glass) compared to others, so I frequently experience that issue.  Thanks for the recipe!

If you're really in a bind & need a quick crust or possibly a vegan crust, this recipe would get you by.  But I'd suggest using a recipe which includes butter or shortening.  This one was just very bland.

This was an easy recipe.  At first I was nervous because of the consistency.  I made two crusts and prebaked the bottom crust for a chicken pot pie.  I was very surprised that it tasted as good as it did.  The dough broke apart very easily, though and I had to rework it for the top crust.  The taste and simplicity of it was great, though so I will definitely be using this for my savory recipes.  I wouldn't use it for fruit pies, though.

This crust is amazing.  Takes only 60 seconds and tastes better than any crust I've ever had.  So much cheaper than buying pre made.  I'm hooked!

This is very similar to "the family recipe" my mother taught me when I was just a little boy. Its easy to work with and easy to adjust to different kinds of pies. Use sugar instead of salt for a sweeter flavor (and add a little extra sugar, just because). I still roll it out as it makes it easier to work with in my opinion. I also just used a vegetable oil instead of peanut oil for allergy reason. Comes out very good.

I've used this several times and am just getting around to rating it.  I love this recipe, it's perfect and flaky for a last minute crust.  The peanut oil is a must.  I'm wondering how it will work with some rolled oats in the mixture.

I made this recipe as written.  The peanut flavor was so overpowering that it overshadowed the flavor of my quiche.  To it's credit, it is extremely easy.  I think canola oil or another lighter flavored oil would work much better.

I made this crust exactly as written, except using canola oil instead of peanut.  Maybe that would make a huge difference, but I don't know why it would.  My crust was tough, oily, and not worth eating.  I won't use an oil recipe again.  The health benefits are just not worth spoiling your pie over.

Used whole wheat flour and sesame oil for my quiche.  I stuck it in the freezer for about 10 minutes, prebaked it for 5 minutes before putting in the filling, and I think as a result did not turn out flaky at all.  I probably should not have made the substitutions.  By the way, 1/4 of the recipe filled up 8 spots in my mini muffin pan.

WOW, I loved this recipe.   I used canola oil in place of the peanut oil because that's what I had on hand.  It came together in a bowl with a fork in about a minute.  Can't be much easier than that, and it's a cinch to press into the pan.  I pushed it up over the edge of the pan so that I could make a fluted edge and it was so easy to do.  Very Delicious & Flaky crust.  I will definitely make this one again.  I made it for the ZUCCHINI CREAM PIE by Shirley Mutchler from this site which was also wonderful.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Very easy and quick.  I rolled out the dough (easier than spreading with your hands).  Used whole wheat flour (heart healthy) and canola oil.  Turned out great for my Turkey pot pie.  Way tastier than store bought frozen crust.  The whole wheat especially gives it way more taste.

Didn't like it! Tasted fine but acted like a formed powder. Would work well with something juicy like fruit pies/crisps/cobblers... otherwise, just wrong.

This recipe amazed me.  I didn't expect it to turn out well at all but it was just too easy not to try.  The dough looked strange to me when I was pressing it in the pan and it just seemed wrong.  But it turned out beautifully.  I used it for a pumpkin pie and it was great, the only thing I would change is to sprinkle a little sugar on it next time when making a sweet pie.  I will definitely be using this for pot pie soon.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This crust is great for just about anything you would need a crust for!  I've used it for dessert pies (using vegetable oil instead of peanut oil), and for a chicken pot pie (using sesame oil-this adds a great flavor).  I really loved it because all of the ingredients are things that most people would normally have in their kitchens.  This is a must try.

I used a rolling pin although it says it's a no-roll crust as it's much easier to flatten out the dough. This recipe really SAVES a LOT of my time (no need to use shortening) and IT WORKS SO WELL (really crispy crust)!! I'm sure gonna use this recipe instead of others for the rest of the pies I'm gonna make in my life!

This was a good substitute for a lard/shortening  pie crust. Not as good as my mother's pie crust, but better than my traditional pie crusts and much easier.  People who had it turn out tough probably over handled it.  I stirred gently until just mixed.  It was not as thick as I expected,  but turned out tasty.

I suck at making pie pastry. I've been cooking for 25 years, mostly a good cook - but pastry is my sworn enemy.  This was easy to make, easy to work with, and I didn't screw it up.  I added a wee bit of sugar and cut back a bit on the salt (for an apple pie). Doubled it to make 2 crusts.  It was good, and more importantly, I didn't screw it up!

This crust is so easy, and it baked beautifully. I didn’t find it oily at all once it was baked.

I kept to the same recipe above and made little pie crust by rolling it out in pieces, shaping with open end of a cup and they came out light and flaky.   Will keep this recipe.

I've made a variation of this for years when I need a single crust.  I've always used canola oil just because that's what I have on hand.  I use 3 T Milk instead of water and add some sugar (up to 2 T).  I mix the ingredients right in the pie pan, spray the outside bottom of the glass measuring cup to flatten the mixture out and up the sides. With any crust it's best to limit your warm fingers working with the pastry.  I put it in the refrigerator while I make the filling.  My husband says it's the BEST crust he's ever had...and we're 73!

Wow, I'm impressed.  I have, like many others, avoided making pies because the crust is usually the problem.  So out of desperation, I tried this recipe.  I have to admit, I'm  sold on this method.  I live overseas, and can't often get Crisco and other shortnings don't have any appeal to me.  Nor lard.  Butter is very expensive, so I tried vegetable oil and it works!!  Took all of 5 minutes from start to pan and while at first I thought the dough was runny, it patted in the pan perfectly smoothly.  I made a double batch to cook in a 9x13 pan, and could have tripled it to fill the pan.  The flavor is good, and the crust is light and flaky.  I did bake it for about 10 minutes before I filled it with pumpkin pie.  I foresee more pies in my future, which is wonderful because I love them!!  thank you for this terrific recipe.

I have always had a difficult time making pie crusts. No matter how careful I am, my crusts have always turned out tough until I tried this one.  I have made this one several times and it turns out perfect every time. Canola oil works great, however I usually use coconut oil for cooking so I thought I would try that in this crust. It worked great. All I did was melt it in the microwave, which occurs at a much lower temperature than most oils. Once that was melted, I threw in the flour, salt, and water, mixed it up and it was ready. I do use extra light coconut oil most of the time because it only has a hint of coconut smell or taste and disappears when hot. This allowed me to use it for both sweet and savory pies. For sweet pies though, I put in about a tablespoon of sugar and it does not affect the texture at all. I have also thrown in a little bit of butter with the coconut oil for flavor. It just needs to melt and be mixed in. This is one of the best recipes I have ever used. Thanks for sharing it.

I tried this recipe, I am sick of the usual shortening crust, tasteless.  My husband loved this & so do I.  I used perfect pastry flour instead of all-purpose flour & after mixed I let it rest 10 min. before pressing it in the pie plate.  It is great, tastes almost like a shortbread.  Even use it for pies that are always two crust pies and crumbled the 1/2 of double recipe over the top.  Sorry I didn't rate this sooner.  Try it you'll like it.  Very easy!

I wanted to make pot pies with Holiday left overs but I never have luck with pie crusts. I tried this one and it came out perfectly my first time. I didn't change a thing. Except I make pot pies a lot more often, the family loves. I do pre bake my bottom crust a few first. Yum!

I just made this recipe and it was ok. I love pie crust, but this crust was very bland and lacked any flavor at all. I followed the recipe exactly however next time I will be adding some sugar. I also made a lattice top for my blueberry pie with this crust and it worked fine. I will definitely continue to use this recipe with some additional tweaking.

I saw this in the latest reviews and I was curious. So I had to make it. After reading reviews I cut the salt in half. The dough's texture when I was bringing it together in the bowl was good. It was fairly simple to shape it in my quiche dish, which was one of the things I was worried about. The other thing was taste but the general verdict was that it was very good. Whilst this won't replace my favourite all butter crust from this site, I can see me using this again if I'm in a hurry or don't have the ingredients for my usual crust. Glad my curiosity led me to this one. Thanks for the interesting recipe Karin.

This alternative crust is a tiny sacrifice on taste for a huge return on time (and still way better than a store-bought crust). If it wasn't for this recipe I would never even bother trying to make a pie. Also great if you don't have a rolling pin handy. Be warned that it is a bit on the salty side.

Excellent. Thank you for a healthfully made pie crust recipe. Only thing I did different is used unbleached flour.  I always use peanut oil as it is much, much better than most oils you buy at the store. Next time I will try rolling it between 2 pieces of waxed paper so I can crimp the edges of the crust. I really could not tell any difference in taste, compared to the shortening type I used to make.  Will always use this recipe from now on.  Worked very well with the Chocolate Chess pie I made yesterday.

I used this recipe for my pumkin pies this year b/c I was cruched for time and forgot to buy shortening. I loved the result! This is not as good as traditional pie crust but there is so much to appreciate about it. It has a good flavor, saves soooo much time, no fussing with cutting shortening, running/cleaning equipment, chilling utensils, etc and not near as much guilt about eating it as the ingredients are healthier--I'm going to try using whole wheat flour next. I didn't have peanut oil so used a canola oil blend instead. Wonderful recipe on so many levels that I may never go back to traditional crust. Many thanks for sharing!

I read some of the reviews a made a couple minor changes.  I did use just a little less oil (I used olive oil), added 1 tablespoon sugar, and just added enough ice water to make it the consistency I needed.  This is a very easy pie crust and turned out great.

I used this with a peanut butter cream pie so I needed to pre-bake the crust first. It took a while in the oven (36min.!) but it was super easy and definitely served it's purpose!

I had to use up a bunch of veggies on the fly with ingredients I had in stock, so I threw together a squash/zucchini/red pepper pie, and used this crust- it came out PERFECTLY. It was just the right measurements for a good textured crust, and coated the pie dish without being too thin or goopy. Will definitely make this crust again!

I used this recipe for a pumpkin pie and it turned out great! I used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil because I didn't have peanut oil on hand. The crust was easy to work with and baked very nice. I may try this crust next time I make pot pies! Thanks for the great time-saving recipe!

Delicious, easy crust.  I do not have time to bake, but always have tons of fruits and vegetables on hand, due our orchard and generous garden.  This was very simple and flaky, however, to save time I made the crust the night before, pressed it into the pan then popped it into the fridge. By the next afternoon it already had mold growing on it.  So I'm guessing the crust needs to be used immediately.  Luckily I had crust left over and baked a single serving size pie that night and was able to experience this great crust.  Next time I will add herbs to the crust and fill it like a quiche!!

I followed the directions and came out with a crust that was very greasy and had a texture like graham cracker crust.  Didn't hold together at all.  I may try this again and see if I did something wrong the first time. Couldn't get it to brown either.

Oily, but it works (although it's much better for quiche than pie).  It is very quick to make though!

I was making Thanksgiving dinner, complete with pumpkin and pecan pies, for my boyfriend's family in Ireland. I've never learned how to make pie crust, so I was delighted to find a recipe for one that I didn't have to roll out. It came out just perfectly. I think I might have added a pinch of sugar, but other than that no changes. The crust provided the necessary crunch without distracting from the pie filling.

This is great when you are in a huury. It mixed up quick and I am shocked at how easy it formed to the pie plate. I used vegetable because that it what I had and it turned out great. Very tasty.

I'm a missionary in Peru.  We don't have many ingredients available here in the Jungle, nor do I have time with two small children to mess with picky recipes!  This recipe is too good to be true!  It's easy, fast and very flaky!  I will be giving this recipe to all of my family and friends!

I am always looking for something easy, taste great.  This fit the bill.   Used Whole Wheat pastry flour and canola oil.   Even made a second batch to use as top crust for apple pie.  Just spread it out using my fingers.  Everyone loved the pie.

I was a bit hesitant to use this recipe, but it was too convienent not to try it.  It turned out perfect for the quiche I used it for.  Not sure if I would use it for a pie though.

The easiest pie crust!  I never made one from scratch, and now I won't buy a pre-made one again!  I had no peanut oil, and used vegetable oil instead and it still turned out great!  Very flaky!

Oh my goodness, so easy! I did not have peanut oil so I used 1/4 cup of canola oil and 1/4 cup olive oil.  Worked out great! Will definatly use again since I don't have a roller!

I loved how easy this was.  It turned out perfect for me.  I also used an olive oil/ canola mixture.  The olive oil gave it nice flavor.  I used this with a quiche.  I will definately use this again.

Sooo easy and so good.  Excellent recipe and so quick!  I was thrilled that it turned out so great!  Did I mention how easy this was!!  I used a food processor for the mixing to make it even easier.  Wow!!!
