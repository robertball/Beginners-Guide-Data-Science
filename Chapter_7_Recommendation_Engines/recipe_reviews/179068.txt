My husband and kids LOVE this. To make it a little easier, I cut the tortilla into 1 inch pieces with a pizza cutter and toss it with the salsa, beans, chilies, half the cheese and a can of Campbell's condensed tomato. I spread it in a greased 9x13 baking dish and sprinkle it with the cheese and onions. Super easy and my family just inhales it. Sounds kind of weird but it really is comfort food and totally kid friendly.

Not a bad replacement for your standard boxed taco dinner, but this recipe just still came up a bit short. The beef with enchilada sauce was a bit bland for my taste. I think I would add taco seasoning to the meat if I were to make this again. It seemed like this recipe really took large amounts of all the ingredients and was a bit difficult to prepare for the results. The results were decent, but I doubt I'll be making this again.

This was simple and delicious too. I Made my own enchilada sauce and used corn tortillas. I cut this in half and so I only used 1/3 can of beans, 1/2 can of chiles, and 3 tortillas and did 3 layers ending with sauce/cheese. I cooked the onion and green chiles in with the beef and added a little salt and garlic too. This was not easy to cut into wedges, the layers slid and the bottom tortillas was too hard to cut through without making a mess. Overall, this was a very tasty dish and I will definitely make this again, Thanks!

Very good.  I used the recipe to make single enchiladas but would like to try the stack next time.

The family ate this every day until it was gone. We made some small changes to fit out personal tastes  - all in all, this was a hit and easy to make!

This was easy enough if you mix the refried beans and ground beef together.... I made my own enchilada sauce because I didn't have any canned. This was tasty and was easy enough to throw together.

Very fast & easy. I did use my own homemade sauce and a lot more cheese.  Nothing out of the ordinary but tasty.
