This is a great recipes but I did make a few revisions to make it even better. Instead of two cup white sugar I used 1 cup white and one cup brown, I  also only used used one tsp baking powder. The recipe creates a firm dough and maintains is "criss cross" shape. well. This one is a keeper! Thanks!

I've been making these for years. (The recipe I have calls for just one egg, and no salt or soda.)


The quality of the peanut butter makes a big difference in how these turn out. Since I make these for a friend who is a celiac, I use an old-fashion pb that is made with just ground peanuts. The cookies are much tastier than ones made with pb that has oil, sugar, mono- and di-glycerides and such.


I've discovered a few things that make these easier to make. 

I don't measure the peanut butter, I just use an entire 18 ounce jar.

I line the cookie sheet with aluminum foil, I don't try to move individual cookies to the cooling rack, I just slide the foil on to the cooling racks.

I usually make a BIG batch of dough (2 or 3 jars) and shape most of the dough into 2 inch diameter rolls, wrap in foil and freeze. They keep for several months. When I'm ready to bake then, I let the dough thaw just a bit and slice it into 1/4 in slices and bake as usual.

This is a great recipe for peanut butter cookies, but I have to rate it only 4 stars because of the changes I make to get the best results. I cannot emphasize enough...NATURAL peanut butter. And not that new "natural-no-stir" garbage. Also, the sugar is a bit much for my taste, so I do as other reviewers and decrease by half a cup. If you're having trouble getting the consistency you want, don't be afraid to throw in a couple tablespoons of flour. White chocolate chunks will make an unforgettable combo. Again, I cannot emphasize enough, NATURAL peanut butter â€“ the results will literally melt in your mouth.

To make these cookies even simpler:
1 cup of peanut butter, 1 egg and 1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup choc chips (optional).  They always turn out fantastic!!

awesome cookies.  The thing is, if you like cakey cookies, you won't like these.  If you like flat cookies that are crispy on the outside and a little chewy in the center, these are the cookies for you.  These DO spread, so give them the 2 inches between each cookie if you want nice looking cookies.
Definitely do as others have and cut that sugar down by 1/2 a cup.  I got EXACTLY 36 cookies out of this recipe.

I'm not a big fan of peanut butter cookies, but this is the exception.  I made a few adjustments and now these are my favorite cookies ever!  I used all natural peanut butter, cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, omitted the salt, and added 3/4 cup chocolate chunks.  The result is a batch of wonderfully fragrant, nutty cookies that are neither too chewy nor too crispy.  I tried this same recipe in a pinch with regular peanut butter and it was nowhere near as good; it tasted like most p.b. cookies to me, sweet and bland.  Try it with natural peanut butter, and you'll never turn back.

I made these cookies using splenda and I am just thrilled with the results!  They held together well and tasted great.  They were a little dry but that is probably because of using splenda instead of sugar.  But that's ok, when it comes to sugar free and low carb foods, you can't expect perfection.  I figured this out to be approximately 2.5 carbs per cookie and if you use all natural peanut butter it has 0 sugar content!  I used a cheap off brand peanut butter and they had a perfect shape! So this is a great low carb cookie as well as perfect for the diabetic!  THANK YOU!!!  God bless you for sharing this, I know that my Pastor will be thrilled when he gets these sugar free cookies (he's diabetic).

OMG!! First, these are ingrediants that are always found in the kitchen so you can make these in a moments thought. Second, these are so so good!! This will be my household peanut butter cookie recipe for now on. I finally found a peanut butter cookie where you can actually taste peanut butter, and I do NOT think it is overwhelming. The texture was even perfect for rolling the balls. I pressed the balls lightly with a fork before baking. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I've made these for years, and almost always just bake them without pressing down, then push a chocolate kiss into them as soon as they come out of the oven.

A note to the reviewer who had trouble with crumbling.  I've learned that this recipe has to be made with brand name/high quality peanut butter.  They can turn out either crumbly or like hockey pucks, otherwise!  I cannot taste an appreciable difference in most peanut butters, but I do know that there is *something* different, and that difference makes a big difference in these cookies.  Some store brand etc. pbs will work, but it's hit-&-miss, trial-&-error to figure out which will and which won't.  It's easier to me to just make sure I've got Jif or something comparable on hand to make these.

Holy. Freakin'. .

These really are the best peanut butter cookies ever. I was skeptical as I was mixing them up, thinking to myself, 'Best ever? Pfft, I doubt it. Peanut butter cookies are peanut butter cookies --- They all hold the same level of yumminess!'

Imagine my surprise when I took the first still warm bite and discovered that these truly WERE the best peanut butter cookies ever, oh my.

I don't understand how a few additional ingredients can produce such a wildly different cookie than following the standard peanut butter/egg/sugar recipe on the back of all the jars of peanut butter out there, but it can, and it does, and by George, am I glad I decided to print out this baby.

I will, quite literally, ever bake any other kind of peanut butter cookie ever again. They really are THAT crazy delish!

To everyone out there reading this and contemplating whether or not to choose this recipe: DO IT, DO IT, DO IT! I swear you won't regret it!

These were outstanding.  Mine came out crackly and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside--very pretty, too!  I do think it's a must to use all natural peanut butter (crunchy is awesome).  I used the ingredients in the recommended amounts, but changed how I mixed them together.  I dumped my 16 oz. jar of crunchy peanut butter out into a bowl and mixed in the oil very well first.  In a separate bowl, I mixed together the sugar, baking soda, and salt.  Then I mixed that in with the peanut butter (otherwise, I didn't see how the soda and salt would be evenly distributed).  I did mix the eggs in separately after adding the vanilla.  My dough was very pliable and formed into balls easily.  I barely pushed my cookies down with the fork and they came out perfect.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and baked them on tin foil (with no grease).  They were very easy to handle once almost cooled.  I will make these again and again.

I'll need to do an extra hour on the treadmill to make up for all the cookies I've eaten since I made these last night. I used Smuckers Natural PB Crunchy in the glass jar.  I followed the directions exactly. I rolled the little balls in sugar and left them that way. That way they don't spread out. each one came out perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing! I will make them again in a much larger batch for work and family.  Thank you for a very simple and tasty treat. Peanut Butter anything rules! Review add-on: I use 1/2white sugar,1/2 brown sugar. EVEN BETTER. I've made these about 15 times now. Each time with same natural peanut butter. NEVER had any trouble with the dough at all. not oily, not crumbly like others are saying.  each time they are perfect!

These cookies didn't turn out the way I'd hoped. I reduced the sugar and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown as suggested. They tasted really good but they spread quite a bit and were too thin. Next time I make them I'll add a couple Tbsp of flour just to stiffen them up a bit. They didn't look like the picture at all. I did use a good brand name PB.
***Tried making these cookies again with a few changes. I used all natural peanut butter and added 1/2 tbsp of flour or so. I also rolled them in sugar before pressing down with fork. They turned out so much better this time. I really think it was the natural peanut butter that made the difference (natural - just ground peanuts).

These are our favorite PB cookies!  Easy, simple gluten-free recipe.  We had several issues trying different types, but have settled on natural bulk crunchy PB.  The brand of PB does not make as much difference as the order things are mixed.  Make sure to mix eggs, sugar, vanilla and baking soda together first.  I whip this until it forms soft peaks, and then add PB slowly.  The longer the PB is mixed in, the thicker the batter becomes.

i followed the recipe exactly.  i read it more than twice to make sure that this recipe does not call for flour.  so i baked as is and it was terrible.  it's by far the worst peanut butter cookie ever.  it went flat on me, and everyone stated that they could taste the egg in it.  we sold two cookies for a quarter and we had lots of leftovers.

These were okay, although they turned out incredibly flat!  I was hoping they'd be nice and plump like the picture, but no luck!  I wonder if using natural PB is the secret?  The flavour was fairly decent, and they did satisfy my craving for peanut butter.  I'll continue my search for the perfect peanut butter cookie.  Thanks though! UPDATE: I made these using natural peanut butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added a heaping tsp of flour into the mix.  Turned out much better!  Definitely at least a 4 star recipe using the natural PB (the kind that's just ground peanuts and salt).  Thanks for the tips, guys!

These are very peanut buttery!  They melt in your mouth!  They taste similar to the middle of a Reese's PB Cup...except firm and chewy.  DO NOT overbake these!  They get hard and crunchy and don't taste as good!  Expect them to be EXTREMELY soft when you first remove them from the oven.  Don't be fooled...they are done.  This is how you know they will be chewey!  Next time I will replace half of the white sugar with brown sugar to make them chewier.  YUM!

Wow, so simple, and absolutely delicious. The only adjustments I made were to use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, and I also added a dash of vanilla extract.  Yummmm, I will make these again and again!

These are truly the best peanut butter cookies ever, just as is. However, after ready the other reviews I did try some of the suggestions. A couple that worked for me was adding a small amount of flour and another, splitting the sugar to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown.  Another thing I tried and has been an extreme success according to those who have eaten my cookies is I substitute 1/4 cup of the peanut butter with 1/4 cup "Nutella".  Oh my gosh did this make these cookies amazing! All who have tried them just rave about my cookies.  I hesitate to share my secret, but can't keep it to myself.  It is just too tasty! I just made another batch tonight. Thanks to the creator of these cookies and thanks to all those that made suggestions for slight changes.  These cookies are amazing! FYI: I prefer Skippy Creamy peanut butter.  Natural is just too greasy for me.

PHENOMENAL!!! I just made these cookies, and they are simply amazing, so easy to make, and I had all the ingredients already so I didn't have to go to the store. I used one whole jar of natural peanut butter (creamy), one cup of natural cane sugar, and one cup of dark brown sugar. I put tin foil on the cookie sheets for easy cleanup. My family cannot stop eating them...the only problem is that I hope I have enough left for Bible Study tomorrow!

I had a craving for PB cookies but didn't have enough flour for a regular recipe. I was so happy to find this! These cookies turned out perfect! The dough was very greasy to work with, but the finished product is not. Anyone who said that these cookies turned out terribly must have done something wrong with them! This recipe yielded 4.5 dozen nice-sized cookies for me, instead of the 3 predicted.

Been making these for years, bake only 10 min exactly. or they will turn hard. Also use brown sugar for softer cookies, white sugar for crispier cookies. add choc chips if desired

I'll admit I was skeptical about this recipe as well as intrigued, but it turned out as promised.  I made these to take to my sister's house for Easter.  She is trying to eat gluten-free and this seemed like a good recipe to test.  I baked them for 10 min. and they came out soft and chewy.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar.  A big thumbs up.

As if its not been established, these are very good cookies.  Meltaway, rich and very peanut-buttery.  Only new advice I can add is to recreate a mistake I made.

When I made my first batch, I mis-read the directions and did not press my cookies flat with a fork to make the criss-cross pattern.  I expected the balls to flatten out (like a chocolate chip cookie will...).  Halfway through baking, I checked and saw that the ball shape remained.  I removed the pans, pressed the cookies and returned the pans to the oven.

This mid-bake press did made for a better cookie shape then pressing the completely uncooked dough before it went in the oven.  I found myself sort of re-shaping the dough after I pressed my subsequent batches.  So, if appearance is important, maybe but the cookies in as balls, and press down flat halfway through the baking period.

Minimally important, but maybe worth sharing.

I loved these cookies! My major complaint about pb cookies is that they don't taste enough like peanut butter--these are rich and very peanutty. I found that at 8 minutes in the oven, the cookies are chewy and fudgy. At 10 minutes, the center of the cookie remains chewy, but the edges get crumbly and the cookie practically turns to powder in your mouth. If you've made them but wished the texture was different, I'd suggest playing around with the baking time. Great recipe!

Update: Having made these a couple of times now, I'm going to strongly disagree with the reviewers who suggest using natural peanut butter. I think the dough is MUCH easier to work with using the cheap stuff. I appreciate the sentiment, and if I were eating a pb sandwitch, I'd use the natural stuff, but Jif or an off-brand, with its uniform (albeit processed) consistency is a better choice for a somewhat finicky dough. Also, this dough does NOT age well--make the cookies immediately. I found that even a few hours in the fridge were enough to make the dough impossible to roll. And keep it covered between batches! Still my favorite pb cookie recipe.

i am on a wheat free diet and these were awesome!  i used all natural almond butter in place of peanut butter and added about 1/2 cup white chocolate chips.  delicious!  the only thing i can say is that they were fragile.  make sure to cool completely before storing - they might have been 95% cool and i put in container and when i took out they were all broken apart.  this may be why this happened.  next time i will try just 1 tsp baking soda because another reviewer said this makes firmer cookies.

Exactly the peanut buttery cookie I was looking for!!!! I only made one change: I used 1 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar, instead of 2 c white sugar. Yummy! Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe.   FYI: If you use all-natural peanut butter, which I did, there's PLENTY of oil in the batter (in my case, a little puddle of it at the bottom of the mixing bowl by the time the last batch went in the oven), so you don't need to grease the cookie sheets. And because of all the oil, you really do need the 2 tsp baking soda, so don't cut that amount.

These just did not work for me, ended up having to bake them for 40 mins before they stopped just being goo! Felt like i should have added flour. Again they spread into one big cookie. To be honest i think i made them too big so maybe stick to small cookies with this recipe? Won't be making these again anyway, felt like one big bowl of fat with all that peanut butter in there! Threw the batch out, what a waste!

Really easy to make, my 4 yr. old helped. They came out great.  I used crunchy peanut butter, so it'd have a little something extra. Also used foil on the cookie sheets as it seems to let the cookies come up easier. Ended up with almost 4 dozen cookies. Definitely a recipe I'll use again.

Every year I make homemade frozen cookie batter to give to friends as a Christmas gift, wanted to try this recipe out.  Made this last night in the food processor, step by step as the recipe directed.  (Accidentally omitted the baking powder).  The Flavor of these cookies is wonderful! I had a hard time not eating the raw batter, hehe. BUT my problem was that the batter was too crumbly to roll into balls.  I used the brand-name "Natural" smooth PB, and even added extra oil from another jar.. they were still crumbly but manageable.  I mixed 2 w chocolate chips, 2 dipped in sugar, and 2 not pressed with a fork to see results.... VERY soft upon removing from oven as some have noted, but when cooled, they are the perfect chewy cookie! Must press w fork, will not spread much (at least w/out baking powder hehe). 1" balls made 2" cookies.  I tried adding a stick of butter, and even though it added a pleasant flavor, not much change in the results.  I think the PB does make a difference - if most of it is dry + unmixed, the batter will be drier too. 5* for flavor tho. And I think the frozen log idea would work great!

Yum these were so good! I used regular creamy peanut butter, and thought they tasted fine. I noticed in the pictures of the cookies that they were a bit flat, so I added 1 tsp baking powder. (actually I cut the recipe in half- so I used 1/2 tsp in the halved version). I brought them to my youth group and they all loved them and took seconds! They were beautiful cookies- they looked just like peanut butter cookies are supposed to look.

I was the project manager for these peanut butter cookies.  I decided to add a pecan right on top.  the envisioned turned out to be the best decision i ever made with these cookies,   it added a nice bite to it with a little toasted nutty favor.  We halfed the recipe and added 3/4 cup instead of the full cup.. turned out yummy and perfect as always. I hope everyone enjoys making these cookies as much as MAA did.

This was a great recipe! I made it with the whole jar of Smucker's 16 oz. crunchy natural peanut butter, and decreased the 2 c. of white sugar to 3/4 c. of white sugar plus 1/3 cup of brown sugar. The cookies were excellent and plenty sweet.

I made these this morning, without checking to make sure that I had enough sugar.  I wound up using 3/4 cup of sugar & 3/4 cup of Splenda.  Much to my surprise, they were delicious!  They melt in your mouth and have a wonderful peanut butter flavor!!  Everyone at work loved them, too.  :)

I couldn't imagine making cookies without flour, but I got over that and tried these.  I'm so glad I did!  They were gobbled up in no time and I will be making them again.  My own original tip for any peanut butter cookie recipe came to me like and epiphany; If you like big cookies but you also like making the criss-cross pattern, use a potato masher.  They make a perfect pattern and you only have to press down one time on each cookie.  Your friends and family will wonder how you did it.  I also rolled the cookie dough balls in sugar, then dipped the potato masher in sugar before flattening each one.  Once you start using your potato masher, you will never want to go back to a fork!

These cookies are awesome!  My daughter and I made a traditional flour recipe yesterday and they turned out awful, dry and tasteless.  You can definitely taste the peanut butter in these and they weren't dry at all.  These were the perfect combination of crunchiness and chewiness!

We definitely listened to the other reviews.  We used 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar and they were still on the sweet side.  They needed to cook for a full ten  minutes or they were too mushy and falling apart.

I needed a little treat so I just made 1/4 batch (yes with 1/2 an egg)!  Tasty but a little different without the flour.  I would make them again.  I would say they are VERY sweet - you need a huge glass of milk with them and probably should eat a head of broccoli after!  I used slightly less than the sugar called for, but still a little too sweet - this may have been because of the pb I used.  Thanks for the recipe!

either something is wrong with my ingredients, or something is wrong with the recipe. I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm assuming 500+ reviewers can't be wrong so it must be something in my pantry... but these just did not come out good at all!! They're sooo crumbly I can't even pick them up! There is also a strange scent to them that isn't pleasant at all when they come out of the oven. I used a brand new jar of natural peanut butter, and just made some awesome chocolate chip cookies this week with my other ingredients (sugar, baking soda, vanilla, and eggs) so I can't imagine what it was... so until I figure it out, I'm blaming the recipe!

This is the greatest peanut butter cookie recipe! Easy, and delish!!!! My family are big fans of the peanut butter cookies so we have tried a few, and this one is yummy! I take out of our oven in 9 minutes so the middles are soft with a slight crunch for the edges!!!

I took the advice from other reviewers and cut the sugar by half and coupled the white with brown sugar. I LOVE PB  cookies and these are SO good! Thank you!!

Well here is my experience with these cookies.  They are very easy to make and tasty too but the sugar has to be decreased by at least a half a cup or they are waaaaaay to sweet.  Using brown sugar instead of white made them chewier but I am telling you what type of peanut butter you decide to use is ALL the difference.  The first time I used Skippy natural they were super easy to roll into a ball and they turned out flat, soft and chewy.  The second time I did everything the same but used Santa Cruz organic peanut butter.  The dough was crumbly and they turned out a lot thicker, no spreading at all.  The flavor was very good each time but the difference in the cookie using organic vs non-organic amazed me.  So I guess it's up to you and how you like your cookie!

I just love this recipe! We make them once a month.  I always use all-natural peanut butter (sometimes smooth, sometimes crunchy) and I usually split the sugar with 1/2 brown sugar.  I love that these are gluten free, so we can share them with our friend that avoid wheat products. This is the best ever!

Very tasty cookies, but I should mention a couple of things.  First, if you use all-natural peanut butter (and you should), you might want to think about draining some of the oil off the top of the peanut butter because these little babies are GREASY.  Not in a bad way really but after I ate one I kind of felt like I shouldn't wipe my hand on my clothes, LOL.. for fear of a grease stain.  I like using chunky peanut butter because the little nuts really add something for the texture.  REDUCE THE SUGAR by half a cup, maybe even 2/3 of a cup.  With 1 1/2 cups sugar, these are still plenty sweet (I use 1 cup white and 1/2 cup light brown).  I don't want to think about how many calories these things have, because they're worth it.

I wouldn't recommend adding chocolate chips or anything else unless they are small and you do so sparingly.  I threw in the MINI Resses baking cups the first time I made these, and they ended up falling apart in the oven.  Also, don't try to make them much bigger than the recommended 1" ball--they hold together well at that size. Don't press them too much with a fork; I do it lightly and don't flatten them much.  My cookies are not thin or crispy, they are chewy and decadent!

Surprisingly good!  I was wary of a cookie recipe with no flour. I used a whole jar of creamy peanut butter and rolled them in sugar before putting on the cookie sheet.  They looked flat and I thought they would taste dry but they are so yummy!

I logged on to get a Peanut Butter Cookie recipe, and today was my lucky day!  Not only was this recipe extremely easy; they're delicious!  I was amazed to find a flourless/butterless cookie that could taste so good.  I followed the recipe exactly, and used Skippy creamy PB. I baked them on an air-sheet covered w/ non-stick foil or Silpat for 8-min.  They baked thoroughly and were golden and moist.  A 1" ball made a 2" cookie.  I got the same batch out of the recipe as it states. (I'm usually short!) I can't wait to try this again with Spenda!

I just made these cookies. I think they taste good. I went off somebody elses review and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. I also kind of went scant on both cups of sugar, because a lot of people said it was too sweet.  For me it was kind of hard to stir the cookie dough, but all in all the cookies turned out pretty good.

I substituted one of the cups of sugar with brown sugar, and halfed the cup of white sugar (1 1/2 cups sugar)I didn't have to grease the pans & I used a whole 18oz jar of Crunchy jiff. My daughter wanted pb&j cookies so on top of the teaspoon of vanilla extract we added a teaspoon of strawberry extract. The color of the cookies is kinda pretty and there's just a hint of strawberry which is just perfect for people like me that don't care for too much going on in a simple cookie. I also used an icecream scoop to scoop the balls of cookies. Made it a lot faster! 
* a note of caution to all... My family was in the hospital the whole month of October 2012 from "natural" Costco peanut butter. Salmonella. My niece actually got kidney damage and has to have surgery to fix her kidney on the one side. Salmonella is highly contagious! We had to be quarantined at the hospital. Some common side effects are diarrhea and/or fever, stomach upset etc... Pretty serious. Please wash your hands, work area, foods, tools completely and I recommend cooking the cookies the full 10 minutes to make sure the egg and peanut butter are cooked completely.

I've made these twice before with Skippy All Natural PB and they were very pretty and very tasty although a bit too sweet.  Yesterday I tried the suggestions to use real all natural PB and cut back on the sugar.  A real disaster!!  I used Smuckers (which had the oil sitting on the top in the jar) and I cut back the sugar by 1/4 c.
The dough wouldn't roll into balls without breaking apart.  I struggled with it and baked some anyway.  Ended up with hard cookie lumps.  Tried to fix the dough by adding some Skippy.  Handled better and cookies taste okay, certainly peanut-buttery, but so dry they are hard to swallow!  Was a waste of ingredients and of my time.  Gonna keep looking for a real "best" PB cookie.

Very good cookie, but a bit too sweet. I even used 1/4 cup less sugar than called for and it was still too sweet, besides that, an excellent, easy cookie.

Yum! I was having a pregnancy craving for peanut butter cookies so on a whim I decided to give these a shot. I followed the recipe as written but just cut it in half. I still ended up with 21 cookies. I also made about 9 of them with some chocolate chips baked in. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

these cookies are clearly missing some sort of binding ingredient. i followed this to the mark, and am an accomplished baker. i am actually angry that an entire jar of high quality natural peanut butter( just like suggested) was wasted on this venture. i would not ever make this again, or reccomend it to anyone i knew.

The taste was really delicious. Cookies were just the right texture...slightly crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.
I used regular creamy peanut butter. I followed the advice of others and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, using half brown and half white. I'm giving this four stars because of the modifications I made. 
I was surprised by how much the cookies flattened out after baking. I thought all that baking soda would make a puffier cookie. I also tried some with chocolate chips stirred in. They were phenominal.

These were good - I'm sitting here eating them right now while my family is sleeping!! Very easy to make. I used half brown sugar and half white as other reviewers did, and I used natural peanut butter. I think I still like the Eggless Peanut Butter Cookie recipe on this site the best, though. Thank you for the interseting and easy to make recipe!!

Like others said, these were a complete flop. They totally spread out paper thin in the oven so there was absolutley no criss-cross pattern to be seen. They were sticky and bottoms were beginning to burn before they were done.  What a disappointment.

I thought these cookies were absolutely awful.  My husband and daughter wouldn't eat them, I had to throw the whole batch away.  What a waste of ingredients.  They spread out on the cookies sheet and made 1 giant cookie that was greasy and hard.  Not for me.

These really are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made!  They are very soft and chewy.  I found that you need to let them cool on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes, otherwise they fall apart when you take them off.  Thanks for a great recipe...this will be my peanut butter cookies recipe from now on!!

I have been making these cookies for four years now, and a read some of the bad ratings. Try this with all natural peanut butter(Laura Scudder's). It makes the cookies taste much better(very peanut buttery), also cut the sugar just a little if you find them to sweet. I usually do 1/4" less. And you must use the full amount of baking soda. They will seem dry and none sicky when you roll them, don't forget to smash them with a fork(twice). Last tip, you need to cool these on a rack. It helps keep them from crumbing. This is the only peanut butter cookie I have every liked, and I hate peanut butter :)Thank you for the great recipe.

A very tweakable  recipe. A couple minor things, one, the quality of peanut butter definitely makes a big difference! The suggestion to using natural peanut butter is a valid one. You know the saying, "That's how the cookie crumbles..."? Less expensive PB will do just that! natural PB will allow a little one to take a bite without holding the rest of it in pieces in their little hands.

The second one is two-part. Salt is only necessary if the cookies are going into storage or cookie jar for more than a week....basically a preservative...it DOES take away from the taste a little, so eat them up and share, leave the salt out!

Baking basics...baking soda gives cookies a lift. If you make the rolled balls slightly bigger, you don't need it. If you like a thinner cookie, leave it out and keep the balls the size the recipe calls for. 

If you like a softer, "cakier" cookie, use confectioners sugar (no sugar-grit?), and use baking powder (baking-basics for cake-rise), but only use half of what it calls for compared to the baking soda....

this recipe worked perfectly!
and i noticed some people saying they were too flat & crispy.
the way i found to avoid this is to roll the batter/dough/whatever into fairly large sized balls (haha) and just flatten the VERY TOP with a fork to make those nice crosses. as long as you don't squish em down too much they come out pretty fluffy. they gotta stay nice and ball-shaped.

O M G! I loved baking these. I was looking for the best pb cookie recipe to bake for Jesus, but didn't know what He wished me to make. After some prayer, I stumbled upon this recipe, and, PRAISE HIM, I found the greatest one of all. I made 'em for my pastor, and he began speaking in tongues. Needless to say, they were totes delish! I did make a few minor adjustments for His sake. I included holy water instead of the vanilla extract in order to cleanse the dough from its sinful past. THX!!!1

this recipe is great! i loved it! i changed it up a little bit the second time i made them (which proves that it was amazing) because i didnt have all the ingredients.. namely sugar. i used 3/4 caster sugar and 1/4 icing sugar, adn instead of normal peanut butter, i used crunchy peanut butter. it was awsome!

These cookies were tasty. Just very crumbly because they had no flour. They were also SUPER sweet and very rich. I probably won't be making them again

Very good, very easy.  My kids' favorite and I can have cookies in their hands in 20 min.  Sometimes I'll do 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown b/c I like them a little less sweet.

This is excellent for celiacs and diabetics! I used natural peanut butter (no sugar, salt, oil), 1 cup dark agave, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 grinds of sea salt, 1/3 cup egg whites, lightly beaten. I reduced the cooking time to about 6 minutes.

these were quite good! i used natural peanut butter, and swapped out some of the white sugar for brown (about 1/4 cup worth). i think that made them even better. they were a bit greasy though, and the dough was a bit of a pain to work with. oh, and i added some pb/choc swirl chips too!

Good recipe. Daughter likes them. They are very peanutty.

It's odd that the reviews on this cookie are so bi-polar. We used Costco organic peanut butter (peanuts + oil) and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. We baked for 8 minutes (our oven runs very slightly hot) and let them sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack.

Ours kept their shape through baking (reasonable spread). We must have rolled our balls slightly under an inch because we got 48 cookies out of the one recipe.

I just made these, and they come out very different if you roll them in sugar before you bake them. Mine cooked better if with the sugar rolled on them. 10 minutes is definitely enough, although they will look undercooked when you first take them out. However, either rolled in sugar or not, there was way too much sugar in the mix (I used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar). Also, make sure you use a medium egg, I only had extra large in the fridge and the mix was a little greasy. They still came out okay, but they're not on the top of my list.

These cookies are very very good. But, next time I make them, I will take the advice of some people here and make changes. 2 cups of white sugar makes these cookies way too sweet. Also, all that white sugar made theme taste gritty.  Next time, I will try cutting back by half a cup and possible switching out part of the white sugar for dark.

If you're looking for a soft cookie, I didn't think these were soft.  They were crispy, and I only left them in the oven for 8 min.  I tried less time, but they would just crumble.   Good peanut butter flavor, if you want a crispy cookie.

Gave 4 stars because I modified the recipe heavily to fit the dietary needs of my family and don't want to mess up the ratings.   Tried using egg replacer and sunflower butter...worked ok but needed more sugar.  Wouldn't recommend my modifications as it is just to crumbly and not sweet or chewy enough.

I use light brown sugar instead of white sugar. Love love love these cookies. We don't have any problems with crumbling or texture, they're perfect.

The cookies turnout perfectly chewy - mmm!
-----
I have been making these cookies for YEARS now - absolutely the best PB cookie recipe!  I use a full 16 of jar of PB (crunchy or not) and I cut down the sugar to 2/3 c white, 2/3 c. brown.  Sometimes I only bake a dozen cookies at a time and I roll the remaining dough into balls and pop them into the fridge - they keep for several days. This way I can make fresh, from the oven cookies for 3 days!

These were yummy and perfect for me.  I did cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups.  I think next time I might even go down to 1 cup and they would still be delicious.  Just because I take lil' steps to be a lil' healthier.  :)  Oh, and by the way I probaly should have reduced baking soda as well since I reduced sugar.  Will do that next time.  Texture is crisp and chewy depending on how long you cook them.  If you like them chewy just pull them out a few min. early and let them finish cooking on the stove top.  Like them more crispy obviously leave them in a few extra min.  Thanks for sharing this easy and tasty treat. This one deserves a hug.

Excellent and easy.  Split the sugars - use one cup white and one cup brown.

These cookies really live up to their name. When I made these insted of using all of the sugar I use 3/4 cups of white sugar and 3/4 cups brown sugar. The recipe says to leave them cool for 5 minutes, well you do need to. After cooking the first pan for the max of 10 minutes they still felt undercooked. But after the 5 minutes they firmed up. So don't over cook them. You will end up with one tough cookie. But over all this is a GREAT recipe. I plan on making them again.

These are probably the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made! I have had a very hard time finding a really good peanut butter cookie recipe. This one is so easy, and very unique! I used Jif peanut butter, and they were a little flat, but tasted great! Thanks for sharing, I will use this recipe often!

These are just the best! So yummy...divine with a big glass of cold milk. Very addictive!

These are great for gluten sensitive people. We made several batches and gave them in pretty tins for xmas. They freeze and ship well.

Wow, I cannot believe this recipe got such good reviews!  I did not care for it.  And I am a peanut butter freak.  Wayyyy too sugary.  In fact, the cookies were gritty.  It was like a spoonful of peanut butter with too much sugar.  I will never make these again and next time I find a recipe that looks too good to be true, I think I'll assume that it is.

Wow!  Very good!  I only made half a batch and added 1 TBS of flour and 2 TBS of milk as recommended by one reviewer.  (Double if you are making a whole batch.)  And they came out PERFECT.  So good!  Thanks for sharing!

These were delicious!  I didn't really bother measuring the ingredients so I just used a whole jar of reduced fat peanut butter, which I believe came shy to 2 cups.  I listened to the other reviewers and substituted half the sugar for the brown sugar.  Added an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  Forgot the salt but didn't make a difference.  They were pretty crumbly when I took them out of the oven but I let them sit for about 15 minutes in the pan before removing them onto racks and they hardened a bit. They came out soft and chewy and very peanutty.  Perfect for the holidays!

Great recipe and so easy! I've been looking for a PB cookie recipe that's chewy & this is perfect. I do agree with some reviewers that it's a tad sweet, in future I will swap half the white sugar for brown, and add abt 3-4 tablespoons of flour. Oh and the original recipe yields like almost 70 cookies instead of 3 dozen. Halving the original recipe gave me 36. :)

These were really good, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Next time I may reduce the amount of sugar and just use brown.  They were a little sweeter then necessary.

As other reviewers have said, this recipe is easily tweaked to be diabetic/low-carb friendly.  I used a cup of Splenda and half a cup of granular maltitol in my version of the recipe and got very convincing results.  Maltitol (like any sugar alcohol) has two drawbacks:  it's relatively expensive, and eating too much of it will give you awful gas.  Spiking your Splenda with it, however, will make the Splenda behave more like regular sugar during baking, so you'll get "cookie" texture (which is a bigger sticking point even than "cookie" taste when it comes to low-carb baking).  And because there's only half a cup in the whole batch, you won't be waking up in the middle of the night in gastric distress.

My husband, the reluctant low-carber, devoured these -- both the half-batch I made with unsweetened carob chips and the half-batch I made plain.  (My mother made a batch for my Stage II-diabetic uncle, and the ingredients were approved by the nursing-home dietician.  So if you've got friends or family who really, REALLY have to watch their blood sugar, these will fill the bill and nicely.)

WOW are these great! I didn't give 5 stars because I changed a few things. I used 1 c. chunky p.b. & 1 c. creamy. I used 1 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. brown sugar. When adding the baking soda I also added a pinch of cream of tartar, so the cookies didn't turn out flat as pancakes. I added a little over 1 tsp vanilla. I also added peanut butter chips and sprinkled sugar on top before baking.  Don't forget to line the cookie sheet with foil - it works great and makes clean-up a breeze.  These look & taste good enough to sell at a bakery!  YUM!

I would love to know how tealeaves got her cookies to look that way w/out flour?! LOL. W/out flour these WILL spread some (those of us who like to eat healthy, but w/out totally depriving ourselves, overlook minor imperfections in appearance or texture). I have made many flourless cookies & have made this several times. I use a natural peanut butter and splenda and no matter where I take them, they are gobbled up! If you are wanting a traditional flour based p'nut butter cookie, then you will be disappointed. These are still very good, healthier and have a much richer peanut butter flavor (with no flour weighing down the taste)

I have been making this recipe for many years. I make them often year-round and always at Christmas as well, just sprinkle some green or red sugar on top before baking to give them holiday dazzle. I have tried many different brands of peanut butters with this recipe over the years and have had the best results with JIF Reduced Fat Creamy peanut butter. Using "natural" peanut butter is not recommended.

I never thought I'd say this about anything, but there is way to much sugar in this recipe. The cookies were so sweet that I could have cut the sugar in half and probably added more peanut butter. A natural peanut butter would be best with all of this sugar. Needless to say, this was not the yummy peaunut butter cookie recipe that I was looking for.

These were great, esp. for gluten-free. I used 1 16 oz. jar of Smucker's Organic Peanut Butter, 1 c. Splenda with 1 c. sugar. I baked them on a stone and let them sit as recommended. The kids had fun rolling the balls and eating them! I think I would omit the salt next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is OK if you are looking for something super-easy.  My prep/bake time was only 10 minutes, so that is a plus.  The cookies were better than store-bought but I prefer a peanut butter cookie made with a traditional recipe.

My mom makes these without baking powder.  Different peanut butters will give different results...some spread all over, some don't spread at all.  These have ruined me for any other peanut butter cookie.  All others taste puny after you've tried these!

The only thing I did different was leave the baking soda off. These are delicious soft cookies! My husband has been hinting every day since I made these a week ago that "he needs some of those peanut butter cookies to keep his strength up." Lol. I caved- I'll be making more tomorrow.

Best recipe for peanut butter cookies. I made with 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, used natural peanut butter. They have a wonderful texture. Took to a meeting, they were a hit. I could smell the PB fragrance through the container!!

Absolutely love these! I'm 13 and just started baking a lot and love it. I brought these to Texas for my grandma and grandpa over Christmas and they loved them too. My mom never likes peanut butter cookies but she loved these, a lot!!!

Perfect!  Great option when you have gluten free people- but makes everyone happy because it doesn't taste "gluten free". Cookies freeze pretty well too.

As my dad would say "it was almost good." Did not hit the mark for us even though they turned out great. Used natural pb, 1 tsp soda and a few chocolate chips. It was almost too sweet, but really lacked any good flavor. I'm bummed as I have recently been put on a dairy free diet. I could sub margarine or shortening for butter but I hate that stuff. Oh well. The cookies turned out very pretty though.

These cookies are simple and delicious; a deadly combination! It took me about an hour from start to finish. I love that the recipe is gluten free (depending on what peanut butter you use). I was looking for a great peanut butter cookie recipe that would not fall flat when baked. This recipe did the trick. I did use half brown sugar and half white sugar as was suggested in some other comments. I feel like this made the cookies a little chewier than they might have been otherwise. I will definitely be making these again and again. Instead of doing the criss-cross, I used chocolate hearts in the centers. They did not last long. I suggest making at least a double batch if you have a cookie monster in your house like I do.

I baked this recipe as is before and it was not bad at all but still not what I wanted.. so this time I did make a few revisions to make it even better. here it goes; 
1 1/2 cups peanut butter  3/4 cups white sugar 1/2 cups brown sugar 
2 eggs 1.3 teaspoons baking soda 1 pinch salt 1 teaspoon vanilla powder 1 tbs baking powder 1/2 cups flour 
 I first add the sugar mix, eggs and baking soda in the peanut butter beat for 1 minute. when everything is semi mixed added flour salt and vanilla powder. mixed more for 2 min. 
Preheat oven to 350Â° Shape dough into 1 1/4 inch balls. Place about 3 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten in crisscross pattern with a fork. sprinkled with white sugar. bake at 350Â° for 5 min and lover the heat to 300Â° for another 10 min. this is going to be my keeper version!

Some helpful hints to this recipe:
1. Use half half brown sugar, makes the cookies chewier.  If you like a crisp pb cookie use all white sugar.
2. Use warm peanut butter.  I refrigerate my natural pb due to the oils, but found that the cold pb was harder to work with in this recipe.  Warming the pb makes the sugar incorporate better.  Like room temperature butter in other cookie recipes, you need the pb to be room temp here. 
3. use natural pb for more peanut taste, use other pb for more sweet sugar taste (those other peanut butters have sugar added).
4. Don't skip the salt, it cuts into the sweet.  Just a pinch will do.  that is 1/8th tsp or less. 
5. As other reviewers stated, I cut by 1/2 cup and was pleased with the sweetnes.  I used 3/4 cup white and 3/4 cup brown.  

These cookies were difficult to roll (crumbly and greasy) but turned out delicious and perfect texture.  Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside with a wonderful peanut taste.

Truly the  best peanut butter cookies ever.  They have a nice, crumbly texture.  I reduced the sugar by half a cup and they were perfect.  The whole family loved these.  I will be making these often.

I halved the recipe and omitted the pinch of salt, as the natural peanut butter I used seemed to have plenty.  The dough seemed fine until I added the baking soda, then it seemed to "seize" and became very crumbly.  So much so that I was afraid that it would not even hold together enough to make cookies.  It just *barely* did.  The flavor is quite addictive, I found myself going back for a second cookie shortly after finishing the first.  If I can just figure out how to make the cookie more moist and a bit chewy, this could well be my new favorite PB cookie recipe.  I think I'll try using half brown sugar next time to see if that helps.  I'm glad I tried it, if I can just get it tweaked slightly it will go from excellent to awesome!  (At least to my preferences... YMMV)

These are super simple and easy cookies with a few things that you always have in the house. These were very good! If you're just looking to make them as just peanut butter cookies then you've found the recipe. Good for bake sales. I would not recommend these for peanut butter blossoms as they are not a thick cookie and I like my peanut butter blossoms to be thicker and not so delicate of a cookie. I only used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar as other suggested. Everything else exactly the same for simple cookies.

These are nice, but they aren't the crispy, chewy, peanut buttery morsels that I've been looking for; they are a bit too sweet, too brittle and the texture isn't quite toothy enough for me.

Not a peanut butter cookie fan, I made some for my hubby (his favorite) and chose this because of the ratings. I even loved them. I chose chunky pb, and I did use half brown/half white sugar, but that's it.  So easy, so incredibly good with a cold glass of milk! Keeper!

I love these!  I make them with artificial sugar, about 1/2 the amount listed for white sugar.  I sometimes use reduced fat peanut butter for less calories.  With these changes, they are not quite as good as the recipe as written.  Sometimes I leave out the baking soda and the cookies do not spread as much and are chewier, it provides variety.  These cookies have really helped me to stay away from higher carb sweets and I am so grateful for the recipe.  I am looking forward to trying it with natural peanut butter and other "nut" butters.

Greatest cookie I ever baked.... I tweaked it a little and used baking powder instead of baking soda. I also used brown sugar (2 cups packed) instead of white sugar which gave it a carmel twist. i baked them for about 10 minutes.... great cookie!

I absolutely love to bake and these cookies were horrible! They tasted like chalk and dissolved in your mouth.

These were REALLY awesome and full of peanut butter. We did use half brown sugar / half white sugar, but I know these would taste just as good with just white sugar. They were crumbly without being too hard. It was easy, tasty and totally family friendly! ps. Don't be afraid of how simple this recipe is! Ours didn't spread as much as they warn you, but maybe that was the brown sugar?

i added a few minutes to the cooking time because the cookies were a little fragile and undercooked on the bottom.  otherwise, great.  my 5-year-old did all the work.

These are amazing. I used half crunchy half creamy peanut butter....After reading reviewers who state they had crumbly batter I can't help but wonder if they are using peanut butter that happens to be refrigerated. If so maybe next time use room temp, and for those who have cold peanut butter let it warm up so the oil becomes liquid rather than solid.

These really are the best! The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly, and they were awesome. The second time I made them I used half brown sugar, and they were a bit chewy, but equally as awesome!

these cookies are addicting, but i can't help but think i did something wrong. i didn't see any posts that mentioned how crumbly the dough would be. i could not get the dough to form a ball easily. they kept crumbling and falling apart on the cookie sheet. i followed the suggestion of others and took 1/2 a cup of sugar out. i added butterscotch chips and they were okay, but if i did that again i would reduce the sugar to 1 cup as the chips make it so sweet. can't wait to try again and see if i can make this a 5.

These are amazing.  I don't want to make any other peanut butter cookie recipe ever again!  Have to let them cool on the pan for a bit before moving them so they don't crumble, but it is so worth it.  Taste and texture reminds me of reeces peanut butter cups.

These are my go- to peanut butter cookies.  Like the others I decreased the sugars by 1/2 cup, andd used 3/4 cup white, 3/4 cup brown sugar.  I omitted the salt, used a name brand peanut butter (Skippy).  I also added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.   I have also tried these with Splenda instead of the sugar and no chips, and they were wonderful.

These are amazing.  My kids can't stop eating them.  Per some other raters suggestions I decreased the sugar to 1 and /1/2 cups, and used 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white.  I added some chocolate chips to the batter.  Really delicious!

These cookies are easy and delicious.  I am not a baker and followed the recipe with these modifications: less sugar as other reviewers suggested -1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup raw sugar.  I also used all natural peanut butter and added semi sweet chocolate chips to half the batch.  At first I thought the cookies were undercooked, but as another reviewer wrote, the cookies appear undercooked at first (after 10 minutes baking) but are perfect after cooling for 5 minutes. I ended up with about 40 cookies and my boyfriend & I could not stop eating them - YUM!

These cookies are simple, easy and wonderfully peanut buttery!! The BEST peanut butter cookie I have tried. My family ate them all up and I had doubled the recipe! Made exactly as stated and used Jif. I have found store brand names just don't have enough flavor. Bake no more than 8-10 minutes. They appear to be not done, however after cooling they are perfect!

These are really good. People are always amazed there is no flour. I always get them a little too crispy though. I'll keep searching for a softer cookie, but this one works for now.

Not a bad cookie.  Really flat.  I had to bake up to 12 minutes per batch and could really taste the baking soda in them.  They're good in a pinch with some milk, but I don't think I'll make them again.

I made half the recipe for my husband and me. I followed the recipe to the tee and they turned out great! Tip: Make sure you only cook them for 8 minutes - I put the first batch in 2 minutes before the other batch (cooked for 10 minutes), and the second batch (which cooked for 8 minutes) was better tasting. Thanks for the awesome recipe! I will definitely make it again!

These cookies are so good! They melt in your mouth and are so easy to make, even if you're a perfectionist like me. I got so many compliments on them and even I liked them- I'm not even a big fan of peanut butter cookies! The best. Absolutely the best.

every time i make this , it is a huge hit. However it is way better and soft when you hand mix it instead of an electric mixer. Def recommend and will always use this recipe.

Wonderful little critters, they are! Went to Pops in the Park Concert and was trying to find something that would be delicous and travel well. Made exactly as indicated...made a big hit ... to the point I was asked to post the recipe on the meetup's website. Thanks Bakingnuts for a super peanut butter cookie! (Next time I plan to try them with 1/2 cup less sugar and use brown sugar instead of white).

These were so easy and SO good. In my batch, the dough spread quite a bit, so small marble sized balls were all I needed. Thanks for this recipe!

These are hands down the best peanut butter cookies ever!!!!!  My family loved them and asks for them!  Changes I made were to use Natural chunky peanut butter, 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar, and 1 Tbs. flour.  The best!!!!!

I love this recipe! I'm home from college and Mom doesn't have much in the way of baking ingredients in the press when I'm not around, but everyone has PB and sugar etc. These were incredibly easy to make, DO cut down on the sugar! At least by half, especially if you're using generic PB and not unsweetened natural PB. There will be enough sugar in the generic, believe me! And don't panic if they're a bit soft and crumbly when you take them out of the oven, after 5-10mins cooling time they are perfect dipping cookies for that big glass of milk :) I cut the batch size down to just 12 cookies and I had no problems, and I didn't squish the dough-balls out too much, just a gentle press, so they came out big and chunky. I get all my recipes from this site and this has by far been the greatest success! I rated it 4 because there really is far too much sugar in the recipe, but I didn't heed any of the other reviewers warnings so it was more my own fault than the recipes!

These are the easiest cookies in the world to make and they taste wonderful. instead of baking them on 350, i bake them on 325 for 20 minutes, and instead of making 36 small cookies i make 6 HUGE ones on the cookie sheet. I'm just too lazy. However i have never tasted a better peanut butter cookie in my life. I will make these forever.

Excellent!  Used baking powder instead because I didn't have baking soda. Turned out great!

Great recipe! I made a little changes to the recipe..used only 1 & 1/2 cup sugar, divided the dough in half, and added about 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to half the dough. The chocolatey dough was kinda dry so I added about 2 tablespoons of milk into it. Then I rolled a teaspoonful of the regular dough, and a teaspoonful of the chocolatey dough together, placed them on the cookie sheet and pressed with a fork...the outcome ~ great looking, great tasting peanut butter cookies! My boyfriend and his mom loves it. Would have used crunchy peanut butter or some chopped nuts in it, as I prefer some crunchiness in my cookies, but I ran out of both. Thanks alot for sharing the recipe!

These cookies are awesome!  I made a half batch.  I'm a culinary arts school graduate and I can't say anything bad about these at all.  The dough was not overly oily and held it's shaped beautifully.  I added 1 tbsp flour and 1 tbsp cocoa powder because I love chocolate and peanut butter.  I used Peter Pan Honey Roasted Creamy Peanut Butter.  Yummy!

UPDATE!  I made another half batch using the Peter Pan Honey Roasted and instead of 1 cup, I used 3/4 cups and 1/4 cups Nutella.  I also cut the sugar in half because Nutella is so sweet.  Amazing!

this recipe is absolutely amazing...the cookies end up soft and chewy with a slightly crispy edge and a great taste of peanut butter for you peanut butter lovers. I've made it three times just this week for friends and myself. The only thing is that these cookies spread out A LOT so give lots of space

I tried this recipe and consider myself a very experienced baker, and by far one of the worse peanut butter cookie recipes I've ever tried.  They were too crisp, because of the no flour.  Not like a true cookie, more like a thin sugar cookie.  If you like a true substance cookie this recipe is not for you.

These cookies were the best! I loved them! They're so easy to make and they have the best taste!!! Though, if you don't cook them long enough they're kind of crumbly. But I cook them for about 14 minutes and they're SOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!

My 5 year old son and I just made these and they live up to their name!!!  He did everything but beat in the egg super easy recipe.  They are being eaten faster than we can bake them. I cut the recipe into 24 servings but used 1 tsp. vanilla, pinch of salt, 1 whole egg, 1 1/3 cup PB and White Sugar oh and 1 1/3 tsp. baking powder.  I baked them for 8 minutes at 350.  And I didn't coat them in sugar beforehand be sure to have a nice tall glass of milk.  Very impressed with this recipe LOVE IT!!!

These cookies will not look done after 8 to 10 minutes. Take them out anyway. If you don't, they will proceed to melt into a puddle of goo and then burn. What you'll get after 8 to 10 minutes are big, crumbly pieces of semi-baked dough. They're edible, but they're far from the best cookies ever.

This recipe is very similar to a recipe that my father in law loved. I haven't made them since he died as I tucked the 
recipe in his pocket. (I didn't have a copy.) The kids got up early this morning so I thought I'd throw this together while they were eating breakfast.

I used a whole jar of Adams chunky peanut butter and used half white/half brown sugar. I stuck the batter in the fridge for a couple hours to firm up before I made it. These turned out great. I underbaked them just a little to make them moist. Not just like the recipe my father in law loved but darn close. I think next time I make them I'll add unsalted peanuts and chocolate chips.

I plan on seperating these into baggies for lunches during the week and sticking them in the freezer. They will be thawed by lunchtime and will be less likely to break.

EDITED TO ADD: For those of you who think about using Adams peanut butter for this recipe, DON'T. It was way too oily for this recipe, which caused the cookies to spread. They tasted good, but were way too messy. Next time, I'll use a more commercially processed peanut butter, like Jif or Skippy.

These cookies were great.  I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but I went ahead anyway because I was looking for a quick easy cookie that my fiance could share with his coworkers.  I substituted Splenda for baking, Splenda brown sugar, and egg beaters for the sugar and eggs.  I also had some unsalted peanuts lying around, so I crushed them into pieces, mixed them with some Splenda brown sugar, and rolled the cookies in the mixture before pushing the cookies down with the fork.  The cookies were a huge hit!  I will definitely be making them again.

WOW This cookie recipe is a keeper. I made a quite a few changes... and had to make an adjustment...  

After I called them 

Louisiana Blackstrap Peanut Butter Choclate Chip Cookies

Well.. people couldnt get enough. 

First I forgot the vanilla extract. DOH!
Bet they are better with it! Skipped the pinch salt too. Didn't miss the salt, the peanut butter has enough. 

Used 1/2 c white sugar
used 1/2 cup molasses (Full flavor black strap Brer'r Rabbit molasses) 

[** I would use 1/4 cup next time for more general appeal... if you are not crazy about molasses go with the brown sugar 1/4 c]


I added a tbsp of flour 
I added a tbsp of 2% milk
I added a tsp of baking powder 
I added a pinch of cream of tarter
I added a cup of rolled oats
I added a bag of tollhouse semi sweet chocolate chips
I used Super chunk Skippy peanut butter and added a tbsp to the 2 cups. 

Put it together with a hand mixer... and really mixed it... the dough is some oily and due to so many chocolate chips and the chunks of peanuts tended to fall apart a bit but held together nicely in a ball.
 I used cold water on my hands to form the balls 

Rolled the balls in white sugar

Placed them a good 1 -2 inches apart but needn't have they didn't spread that far on...

 foil covered pans, Pam sprayed
( both air light and standard) 

Rinsed fork with cold water after making impression, which stayed. 

Baked for 10 minutes in preheated 350 oven.

As I said, with all my modifications, these didnt spread much, and k

I was really disappointed with these cookies! I agree, they were really easy to make, but mine flattened out like a pancake and had the consistency of toffee. I think there was too much oil in the peanut butter (just regular store-brand). I'd imagine that a peanut butter with less oil wouldn't have the same problem. I gave it 2 stars though, because even as a toffee-pancake, it did taste good!

I had decided that I would probably not like these cookies even before I made them (based on other reviews).  But decided to try anyway and they are very good.  Reminded me of making peanut-butter balls with all of the rolling.  It took me more like 15 minutes to prepare as I took time to roll the cookies out in uniform.  As other reviewers suggested, I also split the sugars in half, one half brown and the other half white sugar.  Delicious! Don't know why so many other people had problems with the consistency, if you mix all the ingredients well and roll the cookies out into tight little balls, they come out just fine.

I thought these cookies were delicious, but I was surprised how much my kids & hubby LOVED them! I used 1 jar of natural peanut butter which is all we use lately anyway.  I added a couple pinches of Cream of Tartar as suggested in another review, and the cookies were not flat at all. I also used brown sugar to replace about a 1/4 cup of the white, and for the white I used organic sugar. The dough was a little drier than I expected, with some of the cookies being a bit crumbly on the edge, but I think that's my own fault for not measuring carefully enough.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My 5 yr. old daughter made these with me.  Used 1/2 natural almond butter and 1/2 regular chunky peanut butter. Also, used 1/2 brown sugar. A little sticky when doing the criss cross on top, but she had fun just mashing them down a bit with her fingers.  So good! We could not stop eating them!  In half the batch we added oats, yum!!

I tried these on a whim, we don't have peanut butter cookies in New Zealand so I'm not sure how they were meant to taste. They just tasted like peanut butter with sugar in it to me. I didn't have any problems with the dough, and the cookies came out looking just like th e picture. It was hard to tell if they were 'done' since they didn't brown. The sugar was still crunchy, I am unsure if I cooked them for long enough. It was easy and fun to make but I didn't much care for the flavour. Might be an acquired taste.

I reduced the amount of sugar by a 1/2 cup and used crunchy natural peanut butter for the recipe. Due to the nature of natural pb, the dough turned out quite crumbly and a little hard to work with. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. The result was a melt-in-the-mouth pb cookie that was not too sweet and had just the right thickness. The cookies spread and puffed up a little during baking, but didn't meld together like other reviewers mentioned. Maybe it's the natural pb I used. I'd definitely use this recipe again, but with smooth pb next time.

These cookies were amazing. They tasted great, but can tend to be a little sweet. Personally I loved them, but my mother said that they were a bit too sweet, but still very good. The only thing I would suggest is to make sure that you let them sit after they have been cooked. Waiting less than 8 minutes can lead to a messy disaster (even though it is a fun treat to eat all the crumbs up =D )

I was looking for a cookie recipe that didn't involve butter because I didn't have any. I had a sweet tooth like no other. So I tried this recipe and it DEFINITLY hit the spot. I made these and they turned out good. I could only eat one because it was so sweet but it did fill that craving for sugar. The only pointer that I have is to let the cookies sit on the pan for about 5 minutes before taking them off because they will fall apart if you try doing it right away. They turned out great and my 2 year old loved it.

These were "pure heaven"....will have to see how they stand up tomorrow.  Not sure if they will be soft.  I am putting them in a container with a piece of white bread, maybe that will help retain the softness.  My husband gobbled these all up, and after about 10 told me to take them away, he couldn't stop!  Said they were the best ever!! 
KUDOS and enjoy all :)

I just made these this weekend with  mini M&M's (1 and 1/4 cups of mini M&M's). They are simple and great...and were scarfed down by kids and adults alike! I think the color of the M&M's made them a little more festive. They come out soft and bursting with awesome peanut buter flavor.
Also, these baked up just fine without the baking soda (my recipe didn't call for baking soda). Try them!!! =0)

Wow this recipe really was quick, easy
and delicious! They were crispy and chewy
at the same time and I loved them.  Next
time I will spread them out further apart
because I ended up with one giant cookie!!!
LOL but that's a good idea for a real 
cookie monster!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. The flavor is very good, but they are just too greasy. I could tell even as I was rolling them, that the outcome was probably not going to be the best. I'm going to share them with a friend for his birthday and feel like I'll need to apologize for the heaviness of the grease! My kitchen smells great, though!

I was looking for a whey free recipe and this popped up.  I loved it!  Not only was it easy, but SUPER tasty too!  I followed the advice of others and used natural peanut butter so there is no extra sugar in it.  I also split the sugar and used 1 cup Brown and 1 cup white. I used creamy peanut butter the first time Imade these and am trying crunchy today!  Either way, this is definitely a keeper!

Totally simple and totally fantastic!  We are NOT gluten free and bake plenty with flour, but the truth is that when it comes to peanut butter cookies the flour just gets in the way of the great combination of peanut butter and sugar!  A real peanut butter lover's dessert. p.s. Under bake them slightly for a softer cookie. YUM!

I liked the REAL peanut butter flavor, but is was almost like putting a teaspoon of peanut butter in your mouth.  I think next time I make these, I will cut down on the sugar and add dark chocolate chips to give more of a peanut butter cup flavor.

Awesome cookie; love the taste. I used just regular ole Albertsons brand PB and the taste is just fine. I did have to throw in three (or so) tablespoons of flour to make rolling easier. This recipe is a keeper!

I've been making these cookies for years.  The recipe is on the side of the Kraft Peanut Butter jar and has been for years.  I don't change a thing in the recipe and if you like a crispier cookie you just bake it for a little longer and if you like a chewier cookie you bake it a little less.  Couldn't be easier.  You can add chocolate chips or raisins if you like.

I agree. Best ever, and gluten free, too. Made a great gift for my neighbor after a celiac diagnosis.

These really are the best peanut butter cookies ever. I added a half a teaspoon of almond extract which made them even better!

I made the commonly suggested adjustments -- 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 brown and natural peanut butter. I did have the problem with crumbling. They are less sweet than standard fare, which I like, but I was not overwhelmed as other reviewers were.

As written, these are decent cookies.  The second time I made them however, I did half brown and half white sugar, which turned out much better in my opinion.  Making them again tonight on request of my boyfriend.

So good!  I didn't use baking soda or salt and reduced the sugar by more than half.  I made a 1/2 batch and used 1 cup pb, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 egg, 1/2 tsp van.  Turned out great!

Great cookies! Made them from an office christmas party and everyone loved them. Once you remove from the oven they are easy to fall apart so just be carefully moving to cooling rack. So simply though!

Wow these were great and super easy to make! Everyone thought they were regular cookies until I told them they were flourless. I will make these often. Only thing I might try is cutting the sugar to help with the sugar and carb content.

Awesome! I used Peter Pan peanut butter. I also substituted 1/2 of the sugar with brown sugar. And I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. This is a must try, easy, with ingredients you always have!

Tasty, but a little crumbly.  And the sugar didn't really melt into the cookie.  It had a grainy texture, but the flavor was delicious!!

This is the second time I've made these cookies and they are sooooo good. Both times I used half white half brown sugar and added chocolate chips. First time I made balls and flattened a bit with the back of a fork to make the traditional imprints and they came out exactly as I put them in. They did not spread, but were still good. Second time, I flattened them into a cookie shape thinking they would come out the same but no - this time they spread! I had huge cookies that tasted even better than the first. So, I'll flatten my cookies from now on and make them a bit smaller. I used superchunk skippy both times and reading the reviews I see people debating over the peanut butter used. I wonder if maybe it's the difference between creamy and chunky? I would use a more expensive peanut butter either way but mine came out crispy on the outside and nice & chewy on the inside. I will make these often, Thank You!!

These cookies are amazing!  I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I also used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and made some of the cookies with chocolate chips.  I had heard of this type of recipe before but had never tried it.  They really are the best peanut butter cookies EVER!!!

These cookies suck. They did not hold their shape at all n just spread flat... :( They don't taste that great either. This was just a waste of my perfectly yummy peanut butter! I'm very disappointed! Never again.

Found this recipe this past holiday season when I was looking for treats to bake for family and friends. I loved it. The simplicity was well welcomed when I set out to bake 36 dozen cookies. Aside from them being super easy they are quite tasty, very crunchy and I personally love a nice crunchy cookie. I have recently adopted a low to no carb life style. These cookies fit right in. I baked a batch today using splenda rather than sugar, and instead of 12 cookies I made 40 mini cookies, making each cookie roughly 1 carb each. They are lighter and more delicate than they are with sugar, almost like shortbread. Will use this recipe for the rest of my baking days, thanks so much for sharing.

I made these cookies last night, but this evening wanted to bake them. I set the batter out on the counter so it would get to room temperature, but even at room temperature the batter didn't look right to me. The raw batter looked and felt like sand. I used natural creamy peanut butter that did have cane sugar as an ingredient.They just fell part after staying on the cookie sheet to cool for 5 minutes per the instructions. I will never attempt to make these again.

I just finished making these for my SIL's birthday. He is a cookie monster and will love them. This is much nicer than the 3 ingredient recipe and doesn't take any longer to make. They are also lighter and grow a bit, so I had a couple holding hands.lol I also put a few balls in tiny muffin tins and pressed in a mini peanutbutter cup. yummmy..

SUPER GREAT RECIPE.  TRY IT WITH 1/2 peanut butter and 1/2 Nutella Chocolate Hazelnut peanut butter, and substitute one cup of white sugar with one cup of brown sugar . . . DELICIOUS & AWSOME. ALSO, TRY TOSSING IN SOME PECAN PIECES IN THE INGREDIENTS. GOOD STUFF.

Very easy to make, super sweet so next time I will decrease the sugar. I didn't have baking soda so I used 1 tsp of baking powder...held criss cross pattern great.

My eight year old daughter made these for my husband who is a peanut butter cookie connoisseur. She gave him one and he loved it! These cookies are tasty and so easy to make. We'll definitely be making these again.

These were ok but I think they would be better with flour. They broke apart very easily and were not the chewy texture I like.

I was hesitant to rate this recipe because I did use other's suggestions and did not make it exactly as recipe called. However, I don't see how the recipe would have been any better if I had not made the minor changes. I used all natural peanut butter and only 1 t baking soda. Also I used 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar. The consistency was awful. I don't know how to describe it but you didn't really want the cookie in your mouth. The taste was "different". My guess is that it's because of the all natural pb. I wouldn't say I wasted my ingredients but I know now that flourless peanut butter cookies are not for me.

I am so glad I only had half the ingredients for this recipe, sat down with a cup of iced coffee and ate far too many of them, they are so scrummy one leads to another and there you have it - another 4" on the hips, enjoy these amazing easy to make cookies..

I love this recipe! First, it's gluten-free and I have Celiac's. Second, if you add a chocolate kiss at the end this mocks real kiss cookies. Third, I actually rolled out this dough and made cut-out Christmas cookies with sprinkles, worked great! I do recommend the 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar as somebody else suggested. Easy, versatile, and most importantly delicious. This recipe truly deserves the title, "Best Peanut Butter Cookie Ever".

I've never eaten or made peanut butter cookies before (they're not that common in Australia), but these were super tasty!!
I read HEAPS of reviews before I made them and these are the small changes I made:
I used 375 g (1 container) of natural crunchy peanut butter and then made up the rest with regular crunchy peanut butter. I only used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I added 1 cup of white chocolate chips. I used the aluminium foil idea (fantastic), where I lined my baking trays with UNgreased al foil, put my 1 inch balls on and pressed very slightly with fork. Baked for exactly 10 mins. They came out very soft and kind of looked uncooked but I removed the al foil sheet, with the biscuits still on and placed on a cooling rack for about 5 minutes or until they were solid enough to be transferred off the foil and on to the cooling rack. Left them to cool for about 2 hours and... they were perfect, so much chewy goodness!! I stored them in air-tight plastic containers and they were still perfect the next day. I can't say how long they last because mine all went in the first 2 days! 
I only made 29 cookies (I must have made them a bit big).
I will definitely be making these again!

Very good, but the texture was missing something.  I imagine due to the lack of flour or something (but this recipe is very good for the gluten free aspect!). Texture was quite grainy, but the flavor was delicious and it was easy to throw together.

This was a quick and easy recipe that I had all the ingredients for late at night. I made larger cookies, and ended up with 21 cookies total. My cookies didn't 'run' and they turned out great and puffy.

I love to bake these cookies because they are SO easy and healthy for a cookie. You can eat two without feeling bad! Also, everyone in the family loves them. I bring them to family gatherings all the time and everyone loves them. They spread out nicely so you feel like you're eating more!!! BEST COOKIE EVER, and i don't generally even like peanut butter cookies

Excellent recipe! Easy to follow, low cost (we had all of the ingredients on hand), and very tasty.  If you are not a fan of sugar (I am one of those) reduce the amount of sugar you use to about 1cup to 1 1/2 cups.  My husband loves the cookies super sweet. But I think I will cut down on the sugar next time. The cookies are very good with a nice cold glass of milk!

I didn't really like Peanut Butter cookies until I tried these, but they're my dad's favorite. I have now made them many, many times. My sister has Celiac Disease, and they're naturally Gluten-Free. I substituted Splenda for my diabetic friend. I agree with the other reviews, you can taste the difference if you use natural peanut butter.

Love them! So easy to make, makes a lot too. I gave them to my coworkers and they all loved them. I used 1 cup sugar, 1 cup brown sugar and next time I might even use less sugar. I used all natural organic pb. Quality is key.

I used a mixture of white and brown sugar. When I was rolling out the dough balls I was concerned with the amount of moisture in them. Then, when I pulled them out after about 12 minutes I thought they had a strange looking texture. However... none of the above mattered because when I ate one, I quickly found myself going back for another, and another. Addicting. Can't eat just one. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

This was a great easy recipe, but I had to split it into fourths. They just came out of the oven and look rather humongous. I hope I didn't overdoe the baking soda. I always find that with peanut butter cookies one can do no wrong. However, I probably shouldn't try them with limited supplies again.

Great recipe! I took the suggestions and decreased the sugar by half a cup. I also used half splenda brown sugar and added 70% dark chocolate. My husband loves them - I will definitely be making them again.

If the idea of granulated sugar and peanut butter gets you excited, you will like these. They were better than my mother-in-laws, but not really that great. 

FYI: I halved the recipe and got 32 cookies using the 1" ball suggestion.

Took the first reviewers advice, these were very good and only somewhat fragile. I made big cookies and used a sugar covered glass to form them. I sold them at a garage sale and took the left overs to a small group. They were gone (doubled) by the end of the night. Thanks!

Made as written, (except 1c white/1c brown sugar) & added plain M&M's....WOW! I could not stop eating them, no really. I can usually grab one cookie and be done for a few hours or the next day, but I really could not help myself with these. I definately have found my PB cookie recipe, my diet hates them, but YUMMY!

These were excellent. But I did make some changes. I used all Brown Sugar and that really helps to be able to shape the cookies better without them being so crumbly and I also added chocolate chips. Super Yummy!!!

Great peanut butter taste in a wonderfully chewy cookie. I used natural peanut butter with flax seed added so I warmed it a little in the microwave before adding the other ingredients. Everything a pb cookie should be. Thanks!

WOW!  Excellent cookies.  I did tweak the receipt a little after reading alot of the reviews. I changed to 1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar, 1/2 Splenda white sugar, and 1/2 cup regular sugar.  I also only used 1 tsp baking soda.  I used 1 heaping cup of Jiff regular peanut butter and 1 heaping cup of Jiff crunchy peanut butter.  I can't believe how good these cookies are!

Oh No! The cookie dough was extremely greasy and falls apart. I cook w/ my 5 & 7 year old who struggled to make balls and were so disappointed. The cookies spread so much that they couldn't even tell where they did their fork imprints. After all were made...yes they were edible but I would never make them again. Very disappointed :-(

My family loves these cookies!  I only use 1.5 c of sugar and natual peanut butter is a must.  Chocolate chips are a nice addition.  I did make these Vegan by using 2 Tbsp of Ground Flax beat into 6 Tbsp of non dairy milk.

I have been making these cookies for years, but with just the PB, egg, and sugar. I agree with another reviewer that you have to use the natural PB. This is a great recipe that calls for minimal ingredients and are a cinch to make. Also, very versatile.

These were very good. I didn't make any changes to the quantities in recipe and used a cheap brand (Aldi) of PB. I did find that once baked, you needed to be patient. They are not a "eat them right out of the oven" type of cookie. To keep them from spreading, I did not press them flat with the fork, only enough so you could see fork marks. But I had to cook them a few minutes longer because they were thicker. I let them cool a good 10 min. on the baking sheet because they were incredibly delicate, as in, fall apart like dust. They firmed up enough to carefully move them to a cutting board to firm up all the way. Once completely cooled, I would agree: these are the best peanut butter cookie ever.

Very very good. The dough was harder to work with than I expected (it was pretty crumbly -- I had to press it into balls because it wouldn't roll), but they turned out great. Just like everyone else said to, I left out 1/2 of sugar but I did everything else just as written in the recipe.

This is the Best peanut butter cookie recipe I've ever tried. I made it right away,  after I was done reading it and some of the reviews. I still can't believe how wonderful these came out. Instead of 2 cups sugar, I used 1 c. white and 1/2 c. organic brown (which is like light brown). I figured the brown sugar would make them a little bit more on the chewy side. I also mixed the eggs, vanilla, and soda with the sugars, and beat them really well before adding the peanut butter. The texture is really great. I took some photos and one is of how lovely the texture is. (Pardon my photos, I had to use my Blackberry--hubby's got the camera). Peanut butter cookies are my husband's favorite. He will be surprised when he gets home from work! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

These cookies were excellent AND easy! I have a fear of making cookies because they usually run off and make one huge cookie sheet, they're overcooked, or they taste like sweet flour. NOT THESE THOUGH! They were exceptional and delicious! Thank you for sharing!   I did include somethings to make it mine. I added a about a tablespoon of flour, some chopped roasted peanuts, and 2 chopped up heath bars. Heavenly!

Had to try a flour-less cookie. I can't believe they are this delicious. So simple to make. They have to be low calorie. Practically health food! Husband loves the strong peanut butter flavor. I too cut sugar by 1/2 cup and used half brown half white. And I used Adam's all natural peanut butter. Ten minutes on parchment paper. Perfect! I made half the recipe to test them out. Waiting to see the four left are like in the morning. Fast fast fast, no muss to make. Will take them to fellowship tomorrow night.

I just made this recipie, but I put a twist on it, I added about a 1/4 cup of cream cheese to the peanut butter when creaming. The result, a super soft most peanut butter cookie. I also used crunchy pb because I llike texture, and for health reasons, the sugar was subsituted with splenda and i added another 2 tsp of splenda brown sugar. it made an amazing cookie.

I cut the recipe in half because I only had half a jar of peanut butter. I also cut the sugar a little as per reviews. The mixture was really crumbly but it pressed together into balls pretty easy so I wasn't too concerned. I pulled the cookies out at 10 minutes and let them cool for a few minutes on the sheets because they seemed soft.   The final product is okay. I wish they were a little more peanut-buttery and moist.

I used old fashioned peanut butter, and that's the only reason I can possibly think of that caused these cookies to spread out and be incredibly greasy and crumbly.   I saved them by adding more than a cup of flour after the first sheet of cookies.  Although it may have been the type of PB I used, I will probably not try this recipe again (although adding the flour made an okay cookie).  I suggest you carefully consider what type of PB you use - the more natural types are thinner and certainly didn't work for me.

You can also omit the baking soda and vanilla...instead of 2 cups of peanut butter, try 1 cup of PB and 1 cup of Nutella...It makes peanut butter brownie chewy gooey delish cookies!!!

I thought these had an egg-y taste to them.  They were okay, since I didnt have butter to make the normal PB cookies, I thought id try this.  I probably wouldnt make this again.

Outstanding!  I'm a very picky peanut butter cookie connoisseur and was skeptical about preparing a recipe without flour.  I prepared the recipe exactly as stated and the cookies had a great peanut butter taste (stronger than other recipes I have tried) and the sweetness, for us, was just perfect.  Be sure to let the cookies cool on the sheet b/c they are crumbly.  Soft and delicious!

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever made! I have tried many different versions, and this one will be my go-to recipe from now on. The best part of it is that there's NO flour involved, which makes it so much easier to prepare. The cookies mixed well, baked well, and were a perfect balance between crispy and chewy. My entire family loved them. Highly recommended !!

The trick to these cookies is to wait for them to cool before removing them from the cookie sheet, or else they'll just fall apart.  These cookies were nice and soft, and very tasty.

I admit I was skeptical with these! I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough ingredients, but WOW! They really are the best ever! I love a chewy cookie and these were chewy centers, crispy outsides! Thanks for the great recipe!

These are good but crumbly. Make sure you let them cool almost completely on the sheet before moving them to a cooling rack or else they will fall apart afterward. Also they are really sweet. I would decrease the sugar and try to add more of something else to keep them together.

These cookies were great! I followed one reader's trick to easily measure the peanut butter (use a measuring cup filled with 1 cup water - add peanut butter til water reaches the 3 cup mark, drain, and you're left with 2 cups peanut butter) and am eternally grateful! Anyone who ate one of these cookies said they were amazing, and I thoroughly enjoyed them myself!

Good but I added 1/2 c flour and only used 1 tsp baking soda. I also chopped up some peanut butter cup candies in them and the kids loved it.

Yes it was easy but it was not the best ever. I followed other reviewers suggestions of rolling in sugar which actually helps the cookies not spread out as much (because they really do). I found the cookies lacked the salty peanut taste of other recipes and was very sweet which makes sense since sugar is a main ingredient. They end up being somewhat flat and the texture is crumbly almost crunchy. I also think that the picture that the lead picture shown of this recipe is taken from another recipe because there is no way these cookies can be that thick without flour!

WOW!  This is so simple even I did it without error! I am an average baker so I listened to the  suggestions.  No salt, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown and 1 tsp baking soda.  I am not sure if  my  1" balls were a little off but I averaged about  44 cookies per batch. Oh and the most important suggestion use the NATURAL PEANUT BUTTER wowza what a difference in taste... very rich.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

This was pretty good though I'm not sure it was exactly what I was looking for.  Mine seemed quite fragile and I'm just hoping they stay intact when I put them in the gift basket I'm making.  My husband and I both agreed that they were way too sweet.  If i use peanut butter with sugar in it again, then I will probably half the sugar.  If I use no sugar added peanut butter, I will probably still decrease the sugar by at least 1/4 cup.

Wow, I never heard of making PB cookies this way. I was out of butter and needed something for a bake sale, these are perfect. I did use all brown sugar because I was out of plain sugar. These are so soft and so good. I will be making these for the holidays. Thanks!

I used high quality organic peanut butter and followed the recipe exactly.  They were so oily they melted into a flat, gooey mess on the cookie sheet.  Don't know what went wrong, but this one didn't work at all for me. If I try this again, I will try a different brand of peanut butter and cut the sugar way back.

This is the first time I made peanut butter cookies, but they seemed flat and dry. Either way they still tasted good. I think my preference is just soft cookies.  *don't press down on the fork too hard* because it cracks the dough and makes the cookies way too flat.

These were the best cookies ever and so simple! I made these cookies for my dad and I'm only 13! He loved them even though he's not a peanut butter cookie kind of guy and I just couldn't resist them. Since I just live with my dad I decided to cut the recipe in half and substitute half of the white sugar for brown sugar. I can't wait to make these again!

I was in the mood for some peanut butter cookies last night and wanted something quick and easy to put together. This fit the bill perfectly. I made no changes to the recipe and these cookies are so soft and melt in your mouth. I couldn't resist having a few more this morning and they are still as soft and delicious. Nice recipe, thanks for sharing.

I brought these to work and had people raving about them for weeks- several people asked for the recipe! Some reviewers suggested using natural peanut butter, which I'm sure turns out great- but I used the cheap, generic peanut butter and they were wonderful.

I was a bit skeptical about making these cookies because of all the sugar and no flour. But I was wrong! These cookies were delicious! The only change I made was 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also used Jif peanut butter (1/2 crunchy & 1/2 creamy). They tasted amazing, reminded me of the big yummy peanut butter cookies we got at school. The only complaint I have is that this recipe doesn't make enough for my large family (It made about 2 dozen big cookies for me). I had to make a second batch and the 2nd time I added peanut butter chips and they turned out wonderful. This is a great recipe. Definitely a keeper, one that I will make often! Thanks!

I have a new peanut butter cookie recipe! Definitely a Kepper! These were super easy to make. I didn't grease the cookie sheets and they didn't stick at all. I used half extra crunchy and half creamy organic peanut butter. It's very important to let them cool for 5 min as the instructions indicate as they are very soft right out of the oven.

I was a little hesitate about the no flour thing, and was wondering how on earth this were gonna hold up, cause when you heat of peanut butter it melts right? Well I decided to go ahead with the recipe just for the kids, if they didnt work out oh well. I have to admit I was surprised at the taste. I did cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and I used crunchy peanut butter for one of the cups and creamy for the other cup. All in all the were great. I let the dough chill for a little while which made making the ball easier. Dont worry when the come out of the oven they look soft, they harden up some when cooled. be careful cause they do swell up so make sure you leave anough room on the cookie sheet. They were soft the next day so great. I will make again. I only gave it four stars cause they really dont roll you kind of just got squish the dough into a ball, not to bad though!

These were terribly dry..the only thing i did differently was use baking powder instead of soda (i doubled the powder) because i didnt realize i was out of the soda, so that might have made them dry for some reason..it is a shame, because they sound good from the reviews!

I think something went terribly wrong. I made a half batch because I live by myself and only needed like 9 cookies. I used splenda instead and since some people only used 1/2 cup splenda for the normal batch, I used 1/4 cup of splenda. i also added 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and 1 tbsp of flour. I used 1/2 egg and baked at 350 for about 6-8 minutes. It didn't even look like cookies and just crumbled. I guess next time I might follow it exactly rather than exploring with this.

This results from this recipe were confusing. The dough was terrible - crumbly and yet horribly oily, when I tried to roll it into balls the oil was literally running through my fingers!!  I dont think it was the fault of my peanut butter - used Kraft creamy with 25% less fat.  The cookies spread all over the pan and each other (unsurprisingly,) but after cooling they were quite tasty. very chewy with crispy edges.  After the first sheet I worked in over a cup of flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  they still dont look like the photo, but its an improvement.

These should be called Worst Peanut Butter Cookies ever-
I cut the recipe in half and used half brown sugar and half white sugar to replace the full cup of white sugar. 
The result was impossibly crumbly dough.
I added an extra egg, and another cup of peanut butter to get a somewhat rollable dough. I was able to roll these cookies, but in the end they were disgusting.

These were easy and delicious! I followed the directions in the original recipe (even used JIF).  I used a 1 inch scoop to make the cookie balls, and the recipe made exactly 36 cookies.  I guess natural PB would be great.....and they are sweet but yummy....so using less sugar I am sure tastes good too. What I loved about this recipe is the PB taste....not like the dry PB cookies you get when using a recipe with flour.  My whole family says YUM!

I had a really hard time with this recipe. I'm not sure if it was all the sugar but I couldn't even roll the balls without it crumbling, and they seemed to really spread out of the cookie form while baking. I ended up throwing it all out and finding a different recipe. Sorry, maybe some of you have had better luck but I had none.

I enjoyed this recipe and so did my family. I followed suggestions from other reviewers and cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups. I also used natural peanut butter. I thought the dough was dry and was slightly challenging to work with but the end result was great. I made balls of dough and rolled them in white sugar before placing on a cookie sheet. I made fork depressions and baked for only 10 minutes. They do not turn golden brown, but take them out as they are done! They were very crumbly right out of the oven, but after they cool they stay together.

I just tried these, and they were very easy... However, they break apart, so if you are making them for children, you may want to kick them out to the lawn to eat them. The taste was ok, but VERY sweet for me personally. I wouldn't make these again, since they did not impress me much...

I can't believe how great these cookies turned out!! I would've never thought that using just 3 ingredients would make such awesome, chewy cookies. My family loves them & they're easy enough for my 3 girls to make them.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  The cookies were way too sugary and fell apart easily.  I used natural peanut butter, so I can't even imagine how sweet they would be with your average jiffy-type peanut butter.

this really didn't work for me.  the flavor was ok, but the texture was weird.  also the cookies were breaking apart when i tried moving them to the cooling rack.  i used splenda instead of sugar - perhaps that's the reason it didn't work, though i've never had a problem using splenda with any of my baking.

These were the perfect cookies to make. I was a little worried because my dough was a little crumbly but the cookies came out perfect. The only thing I did different was the salt. Couldn't see the point of it and didn't need it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am a big fan of Peanutbutteriest Cookies from this website, but I found this recipe to make for a friend who can't eat gluten, and I was shocked at how good they are!  My husband liked them too, and he doesn't normally like PB cookies.

These cookies are wonderful. They are one of the easiest cookie recipes out there, they are very quick and they turn out great! When I made them I used Natural Organic peanut butter, and I cut out a 1/2 cup of sugar. Everyone that comes into contact with these cookies eats at least 2!

I tried this recipe after making the 'other' one with ONLY sugar eggs and peanut butter.  The difference between them couldn't be stronger,  From a cookie that was crisp on the edges to these that resembled a hockey puck.  They are NOT the best peanut butter cookies ever and I won't make them ever again

YUMMY! I made this for my boyfriend for Valentines day. He's not a big sweets person but he loves peanut butter cookies. I can't say yet what he'll think of them since I'm giving them to him tomorrow. The dough was perfect consistency so I was a little worried that it would be too dry (after reading other reviews about the dough being really oily and runny but turning out great). I couldn't resist so I tried what was supposed to be a bit, I ended up eating two cookies. THey were delicious! I'm going to make them for myself but try using the splenda. 

*****I just wanted to follow up after my bf devoured the cookies. He loved them and wants me to make them again!

These were darned good cookies. I don't know if they're they best, but they work for me. I like them best when they are a couple of days old instead of right out of the oven - to me they're a little denser and fudgier than when they're fresh.

i googled "best peanut buter cookies ever"

I have been making this very recipe (printed from this site!) for about 3 years now. And I have made NO changes or modifications. I LOVE it! These cookies melt in your mouth. I use the cheap store-brand peanut butter and they taste wonderful. I always get compliments on these cookies when I make them!

My family loved these cookies.  My parents thought that they were the best peanut butter cookie ever!  I used 100% creamy natural, (no hydroginated oil) peanut butter.  The kind that you must stir and stir. I was concerned at first, but the end result was fabulous.  The batter was oily and thick, but no worries.  The cookies were soft and chewy.  I baked a few a little bit longer and they turned out crunchy and crisp, just the way I prefer. I also used egg beaters.  Next time, I will try raw sugar.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I do not bake because it is too much work,  These are the easiest cookies I have ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception, I rolled the bolls in sugar, then pressed with a fork.  They were perfectly cooked in exactly 12 minutes! They are so light and just melt in your mouth!  My Husband just came back for his 3rd helping after a huge ham dinner!!!

I made these last night and decided to play with the recipe some. If you follow the recipe you will get a light "airy" type cookie. If you are looking for a more soft chewy cookie, this is how to get it. After I made 2 dozen of the recipe cookies I added 1 tbs of flour and 2 tbs of milk. If you wanted to make the whole batch that way just double it. I cooked for the same amount of time, and they spead out some, so don't look for the criss cross on them but they were a wonderful soft and chewy PB cookie. I will be making more today.

Wow! these are so supurb and addictive.  I was really worried about them when the batter was crubmly when I rolled them into balls, and then when I transferred them to cool, they tended to fall apart.  But once they cooled, they were chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  So delicious!  Definitely a keeper!  Who needs to add all that butter that most PB cookies call for?  Tasty hint - they are really good frozen as well!

My husband loves these. I cut the sugar to about 1 1/2 cups and only bake about 7-8 minutes. The other review where they were complaining they were crumbly obviously over cooked them. They were soft and yummy!

I loved this recipe! The cookies came out perfectly chewy and taste like store bought! I love how simple the ingredients are. I followed the ingredient list to a "T" and used chunky peanut butter. I am usually terrible at baking from scratch but this recipe made me feel like a pro! Thanks!!!!!!!!

These deserve 0 stars but you can't give anything less than 1 star.  I will NEVER make these rotten things again.  Horrible taste & texture.  A complete waste of time & ingredients!  They wont even stay together.  You pick them up & they crumble apart.  They're like taking peanut butter & sugar & just eating it but dry.

My boyfriend, the peanut butter freak, really enjoyed these (even though I used 'off' brand peanut butter vs. his preferred Jif).  The recipe made a lot of cookies and they were very easy to make.  Liked the simple, basic ingredients.

These really are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  I found it difficult to roll the cookies into balls with the chocolate chunks in them so I rolled the dough and then jammed two chocolate chunks into the top.  It was easier and also made them look nice.

Quite tasty; quite crumbly.  You have to watch the salt -- the brand of PB we use has very little, and it was noticeable.  The second batch, we added a couple of pinches and they were much better.

These are really good I only gave a 4 because I made some changes. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of golden brown sugar then I added 1 cup of chocolate chips. They came out soft and chewy and not too sweet. My boyfriend really enjoyed them so I made them for a Christining. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.

I think this could have been a good recipe, but I followed others' suggestion to use natural peanut butter.  I had never tasted natural PB before, and when I tasted it just before making this, I didn't really love it, but I thought it would be okay in the recipe.  On the contrary--the taste was quite strong.  I think I'd have liked it better with regular peanut butter.  Also, they were very crumbly.  That could have been the fault of my peanut butter choice.  I might try this one again, but with a different PB.  Just be sure to use a PB that you like in this recipe.

We love these. I have made them three times in the past two weeks. I didn't change anything, and they came out great. In my second batch, I wrapped the dough around Hershey kisses. They're rich, but so good. I also tried the recipe with natural peanut butter, but we didn't like them as much that way.

delicious and very easy! I added mini m&ms and mini chocolate chips.  Be aware, they come out of the oven nice and plump but flaten right out when they cool--don't judge before you taste them, you'll love them!

These cookies really were delicious!  I made it with 1 cup of white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, and 1/2 cup flour (instead of 2 cups of white sugar) and they turned out moist, chewy, and very peanut-buttery!  I will definately make all my peanut butter cookies using this recipe from now on!

Add me to the list of reviewers who felt like these just tasted like peanut butter and sugar. I didn't enjoy them. They were way too soft, even after I increased the baking time.

These cookies turned out delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems at all.  In addition, I used the only peanut butter I had (Sav-a-lot brand) and they were still perfect.  I am not sure that using a name brand is necessary.  I will make these again soon.  Thanks!!!!!!!

These were really good, but maybe not the best ever!  Soft and chewy and really peanut-buttery!  I'd definitely make them again...they were so easy to make.

These were delicious!!  I used 1c natural crunchy peanut butter, and the the 2nd cup I used dark chocolate peanut butter (from Peanut Butter and Co.), and let me tell you- yummy!  Next time I'll try other reviewers' suggestions at 1 1/2 cup sugar, but these were the perfect consistency and very easy to make.  Thanks!

I decided to make these cookies at the last minute tonight. My kids helped and all I can say is "Very Scrumptious". These were the easiest and most delectable Peanut Butter Cookies I have ever had. My husband doesn't like peanut butter but when he came home from work tonight he took one bite and said that they tasted like Gourmet cookies. After I put the criss cross on the top of the cookie, I also put a Reese's Pieces on top. I have committed this recipe to my memory and will use it often. Thanks!!!

It was okay. I baked mine for 12mins because I like them a little harder. I will try the recipe again. My children loved them.

I agree with  using a cooking stone as well. They were ok, but I guess I just prefer  the old recipes which include flour and brown sugar. Dough was a bit too sticky. Came out too flat as well. I would not recommend  making  fork imprints on them.

I tried this recipe, and my 2 year old son helped.  I wanted to say that it works better on a baking stone than a baking sheet.  The dough is too soft and a baking sheet too thin.  So the bottom will get burnt.  However, on a baking stone, it was absolutely delicious and super easy!

THESE COOKIES ARE UNBELIEVABLE! Peanut butter cookies are my all time favorite cookies, so I have dried a lot of different recipes. And my cookies are always horrible. My husband even has a saying such and such will happen, when my wife makes good cookies.(Like when hell freezes over!) I told him one day he will eat those words, and today is the day!

My absolute fave peanut butter cookie.  In my opinion, it tastes best if you use natural peanut butter and omit the salt.  Some chocolate chips tossed in there can't hurt either.

I am on a low carb diet so I used about 1/3 the sugar called for and added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.  They are a wonderful treat with very few carbs.  Thanks, Sandy.

These were ok, nothing spectacular. I thought they turned out really well, but they didnt taste enough like peanut butter to me. These would probably be good with peanut butter chips too.  Still reccomend if you want a quick peanut butter cookie, was enjoyable nonetheless.

I'm an avid baker, but this recipe won't make it into my recipe box!  Like some of the others, I found these cookies very greasy, too sweet, and they flopped after I baked them.  I won't be trying this recipe again.

I liked these a TON! I made them for just a little snack, and they were great. I put them in for 7 minutes instead to make them chewier, and they turned out good. Really easy and fun to make with younger kids. Goes awesome with a glass a milk!

I tried this recipe using Splenda the second time. When using Splenda, the cookies will be darker and somewhat gritty - but for a diabetic, they are tasty peanut buttery treats.

Just got finished making(and sampling) these cookies, and let me say, they really are the "best peanut butter cookiese ever"!!!  I've been looking for a flourless peanut butter cookie recipe, and now I've found it and won't go back.  Thanks Sandy!! And by the way, the cook time for these cookies was perfect, any loner in the oven and they'll burn.  Wonderful cookie!

I made this recipe for my husband's Christmas party.  I was so proud when he came home and told me that these were the only cookies EVERYONE ate.  There were none left and now I am getting calls from his co-workers for the recipe!  I think everyone should try this one!!!

Making dough was very quick. Baking time was longer than expected. It took 15-20 min to bake, otherwise they fell apart.

The trick with this recipe is that the peanut butter that you use really matters. A lot of the reviewers recommend using all-natural peanut butter, however, I had to make some changes to get all-natural pb to work. I used smucker's natural peanut butter. The dough came out crumbly and didn't really stick together into pressable balls. I solved this by adding 4 tablespoons for shortening. I suspect if you used a commercial peanut butter that has factory-added oils you might not need to do this. After the modification, the recipe turned out fantastic and was a huge hit.

I also cut the sugar to 1.5 cups as some reviewers suggested and thought it was plenty sweet.

I coated the cookies in dipping chocolate which was also a big hit. 

Also one more pointer. The peanut butter (and shortening if added) end up being the main ingredients. Their flavor is basically the flavor of the cookie. If they don't have a good taste raw, the cookies won't taste good either so spring for good ingredients on this one.

I made these according to the recipe and we agree. Best peanut butter cookies ever. My husband always gets heartburn when he eats peanut butter cookies but not at all with this recipe. I will definitely use this recipe from now on.

Used crunchy Jif. No adjustments. Cookies were flat and looked chewy and tasty, but did not taste good at all. Maybe it was too much baking soda? Remixed the remaining cookie dough with butter, flour, egg, etc. so it didnâ€™t go to waste.

I read some reviews and decided to cut the sugar to one and a half cups ( I did 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar).  I was too lazy to do the fork thing but I sprinkled sugar on top. They were delicious and soft and I'll definitely make them again!

I used a suggestion from a reader and used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar.  I also used crunchy peanut butter  They are awesome.  I have made these about six times.  This is the only recipe I use now.

I did this recipe at 5000 feet, and I did cut the leavening by half, and also doubled the vanilla as a high altitude adjustment.  I also did half brown sugar and half white sugar as others suggested.  I have to say, the cookies were disappointing at best.  They just taste like peanut butter with lots of sugar in a crunchy form... I tried this recipe again, adding about 3/4 cup of coconut oil and 1 cup of gluten free flour... and theyâ€™re better, more delicate, but not perfect.  In the attached photo, the darker cookie is the one made from the original recipe, whereas the lighter one is the one with coconut oil and gluten free flour.  I didnâ€™t overbake the darker one- it just has a higher concentration of the dark brown sugar.

Wasn't my favorite peanut butter cookie. Very very crumbly, but if that's the cookie you like, I won't judge. Its  very confusing, no butter, no flour. VERY sugary. Not my favorite.

Thank you for this!  When I was a child I used to make a similar recipe with my gran and my mom but over the years the recipe was lost and I'd yet to find anything that was similar to share with my daughter and maybe someday grandkids but yours is as close to gran's as I've ever found.  Not quite the same as I think her's contained oats of some sort, but lots of nostalgia here for me.

I really like these cookies--simple and tasty, and gluten free for my friends that need that. I've made a similar recipe for a long time, but it doesn't call for soda, salt or vanilla. I recently tried a recipe that called for soda and this recipe. I didn't think the soda added much; it did puff them up while baking, but they flattened while cooling off. I didn't really like the added salt in this, and the vanilla was wasted, as I couldn't even taste it. I made 1/4 of this recipe and got 12 cookies. Flatten them a bit as the directions state. Mine only took 6 minutes. Don't overcook these. They should still look undone, then let them cool for at least 5 minutes, otherwise you will get a crumbly cookie.

They were really good at first but they get really hard after cooling. The simple solution is to put it in the microwave for a few seconds to get it into an edible consistency but I wish it wouldnâ€™t harden so much.

Didnâ€™t make any changes, but my cookies turned out flat and extra crispy. Had to basically peel them off of the baking sheet :/

I only buy crunchy peanut butter.  Used Jif Extra Crunchy.  It was a challenge rolling them with the many nuts in it, holding together but I prevailed.  When you put them on the cookie sheets and fork them down they meld together just fine and bake up as if you had no problems.  Was really leary of a no-flour cookie recipe but I was hoping eliminating it would bring out more peanut butter flavor and it did!

I use organic pb and 1/2 cup brown sugar and add some oats.   Delicious and yummy.  Do not overtake!   I keep them.   Chocolate chips are also a wonderful addition.

I have been making these cookies for a few years now and some of my friends actually beg me to make them - they are the tastiest peanut butter cookies ever.  When I first started making them I read some of the other reviews and made some slight adjustments - I use organic peanut butter ( a must) as it has that extra oil that make the cookies more moist.  I use 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown (although you could probably use a little less of the white).  I also mix the baking soda with a little warm water before mixing it is so it doesn't clump (very little, like a teaspoon full)  The best part though - I mix about 1 cup of Reese's Peanut Butter Chips in as well.  These are the best cookies ever - just saying.    Also, just before putting them in the oven I put a little extra salt ( I use Pink Himalayan Salt)  on top  - so good!! Enjoy :)

OMG, best peanut butter cookies I've ever baked! I'll never make peanut butter cookies with flour again! If you prefer a chewy, creamy, not super-sweet PB cookies, these are for you. I took several suggestion from previous comments and used a full 18 oz. jar of Jiff Natural PB, omitted the salt, and modified the sugar to 1 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar.  I also chilled the dough for an hour before scooping, which made it very easy to get them on the cookie sheets and gently fork-flatten them.  Definitely let them cool on the cookie sheets themselves until they set.  SO EASY AND YUMMO--MAKE THESE NOW!!! :-D

Don't be fooled by the high reviews - this recipe is obviously getting something wrong. These cookies are a greasy mess that spread into one giant inedible blob. I followed the recipe exactly. Most of those high reviews made changes to the recipe - no baking soda, 1/2 sugar. If you have to change it, it doesn't deserve 5 stars ...

After the first batch I mixed some flour into the rest of the  batter in hopes of not wasting all the ingredients, but that too was a waste. Ugh.

If you need an easy to make, gluten free cookie, these are great! My hubby doesn't eat gluten free (I made them for my sis-in-law's bday - and she's gluten free), and he tried them and really liked them - and his favorite cookie is peanut butter cookies, so I wasn't sure he'd like the gluten free version. 

These come up light and crumble easily. They have a great peanut butter flavor.

I made it and it was soooooo good :D and we didn't have normal salt, so I used garlic salt, and that made the recipe WAY better, anyone reading this review should try using garlic salt, it makes it greasy, but the dough does taste super good!!! I love this recipe!!!

These are super easy, use just a few ingredients, and really satisfy a peanut butter cookie craving! I made half a recipe because I didn't need a lot of cookies.... Used up some creamy peanut butter and then added some crunchy to equal one cup....Used half white and half brown sugar, and added a little extra vanilla.  Rolled the cookie balls in granulated sugar, did the crisscross and baked - yum!! The dough came together great to roll the cookies....just be careful when removing from the baking sheets.  I had one cookie casualty due to me removing fron cookie sheet to the cooling rack too soon before the cookies had set.... of course that was great for a taste test! :)

Just wasted a whole jar of peanut butter on these. I followed the recipe to a T, and this is not my first time making peanut butter cookies. Dough does not clump together at all. Crumbles. So disappointing. Cookies were flat and dry.

These turn out very crispy! However, they're a bit too sweet and I would have preferred a softer cookie.  Otherwise they're very easy to make.

I've made these cookies a couple times and they are super easy and so delicious.  Some revisions though.  I used a jar of extra chunky peanut butter.  1 cup sugar/1 cup brown sugar.  Added 2t of almond extract .  No need to use a fork.  they flatten out just fine on their own. Bake 7 minutes with small cookie scoop

These are so good! I let my teen and his friend make them. I just pre-measured the ingredients, and then showed them how to put the cookies together. We did add a bag (10 oz) of peanut butter chips. They were very peanut buttery and delicious! I prefer a crispier cookie (rather than soft) so we used the two cups of white sugar, rather than using both white and brown. 
The only thing I might do different next time is to add some salted chopped peanuts. This recipe is delicious!

I enjoyed these cookies. I followed the suggestion of other users and used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white (instead of two cups of white) and I also added about 2 tsp of flour since a few users complained about it being hard to roll up the dough into balls. 

The cookies came out great and were very tasty. Not overpowering on the peanut butter as some cookies are and they were nice and crispy/chewy. I would definitely make these again.

This is so easy and quick the cookies are awesome.  I did use natural PB and 1 cup each of brown and white sugar but those are the only alterations I made.  They came out flat and chewy just like I and my family like our cookies.  I will definitely make this over and over.

This was a quick and simple recipe. I made it quickly as a treat for my 9-year-old son, daughter and their friend who was visiting. We didn't have any stick butter on hand so this recipe was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. I only gave it four stars, however, because they were a little dry. Good in a pinch when you don't want to mess with flour and butter.

Thought these cookies were great. I too used Splenda to save calories. These might be a keeper.

Amazing, and spectacular recipe really easy; however, I would recommend cooking for 10-12 minutes, and adding vanilla extract and salt just for more of a flavorful balance. Also adding a little crunchy peanut butter with the creamy adds a cool texture!

Tops for peanut butter lovers!  I made these with one cup sugar and one cup brown sugar as suggested in the first review.  I also used premium brand name peanut butter. Delicious!! Please note these are very fragile when they come out of the oven and need to cool on the pan for a few minutes, before moving to a rack. Enjoy!!

Very good! they are EXTREMELY easy to make! they taste good, and they are virtually mess free! It toke me 2 minutes to clean up! My one complaint about them would be, they are to sweet in my opinion. I would put 1 cup of sugar instead of 2. Overall, they're great cookies!

This recipe is my new go-to recipe for peanut butter cookies.  Like many, I used a combination of white and brown sugar.  I was looking for a nice chewy, peanut buttery cookie to bake and this one fit the bill.  I used a brand named peanut butter and they were excellent.  Next time, I will use the natural peanut butter to see how much more yummy they will be.

IF I were to attempt these again, I would definitely use natural unsweetened peanut butter. I made the mistake of using your typical smooth sweetened variety and these cookies came out way too sweet. Even for my wife, who has a VERY sweet tooth, described them as "like chewing on granulated white sugar". Proceed with caution...

This was the crappiest recipe for cookies that I have ever used!!!! I was not happy with the results at all. If your trying to make these cookies please look for a recipe with flour!!!!!  These cookies were extremely flakey/flat, and they did not taste like good quality peanut butter cookies. And while making the so called batter, it was the most oily thing I have ever touched!!

A little dry. An an extra egg and they will be a little less dry.  Other than that, they don't last more than a day in our house. This recipe makes about three dozen.

I followed the advise of others and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, and added a tablespoon of flour.   I too used all natural peanut butter.   Absolutely the best peanut butter cookies I've had in my life!   This recipe is a hit in my house.

It's good, I made a couple of different versions with variations in baking, and the most popular one was on the lowest tray in the oven, baked for 9 minutes, and WITHOUT the fork pattern. Although, I might suggest a tad bit less sugar, as it tastes reeeaally sugary. Hope I helped!

These were so easy to make and turned out perfectly!  I also subbed half the white sugar for brown.  It definitely gave some depth of flavor.

I used the most recommended modifications (substitute 1c white sugar for brown sugar and reduce baking soda to 1tsp). They're pretty sweet, if I make again I would likely decrease sugar to 3/4c white and 3/4 cup brown.

Cookies ended up with a good flavor, but very dry and very crumbly. I ended up just adding the bits to my oatmeal and yogurt, but that wasn't their intended purpose.

These were too sweet, too crumbly and do not have enough depth of flavor.

The first two trays of cookies spread out on the baking sheet to become one cookie.  For the last sheet of cookies I added about 1/3 cup flour.  Overall taste was okay but a little sweet.

Delicious cookies! I followed the suggestions of the reviewers and reduced the sugar by  1/2 cup. I also added chocolate chips. I made sure not to over cook them and they do come out of the oven soft but they solidify fairly quickly. Yummy! I'll definitely make them again!

Was looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe that didnty include brown sugar since I didn't have any and found this one. Was very hesitant at first because I didn't understand how you could make cookies without flour. This recipe is great!!! They aren't too sweet and not cakey at all like other reviews said. They are crispy and delicious and was super easy! Will definitely make again

Love these! The vanilla really makes them. I used all-natural crunchy peanut butter (that's what I had on hand), and guessed with the vanilla and baking powder (I used powder) and salt. They might be a bit sweet - I might try cutting back on the sugar next time.

I don't know why people are having so much trouble with these. Mine didn't spread flat, and they weren't gooey. Mixed by hand; do not beat to liquidity with a mixer! This recipe is very forgiving. I was a 1/4 cup short on peanut butter, and it was chunky. All these people who say it has to be natural are wrong because my cheap store brand PB worked fine. Now it was Christmas Eve afternoon, rainy, and I just wasn't going anywhere. But I was short an egg for everything I wanted to make. Or rather short an egg white. So I made this with an egg plus a yolk. I used 3/4 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugars, but remember I had less of other ingredients too. They are fantastic, so imagine how good they could be if I'd been able to make them the right way!

Used an all natural peanut butter since many folks recommend that.  It ended up being a bit oily.  I also used 3/4 of the sugar, but was still too much.  Next time, I will use an all natural peanut butter but I'll drain off some of the oil and I will use 1/2 the sugar.

I actually know the sharer of this recipe.  I didn't like peanut butter cookies, but one day when she shared a batch at a meeting, I embarrassed myself eating them.  I've made them many time since and they are always a huge hit.  The fact that they are gluten-free is a plus.  As soon as I find a substitute for the eggs as a binding agent, they'll even be vegan!

Really good cookies! I actually made half the amount, 18, and only 10 pretty big cookies came out. I made some changes to the recipe, though. I added 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead, which made a huge difference. I also cooked for 12 minutes instead of 10. They expand a lot and tend to be pretty thin. The cookies came out amazing this way! The ingredients seem pretty simple and basic, I didn't have to go out and buy anything! Usually a staple for everyone to have in their kitchen. The texture was also perfect for rolling into balls and taking off the sheet. Definitely will be making again, and will be using a natural peanut butter due to the high suggestion of this in the reviews. :)

This unfortunately was a waste of good peanut butter - turned into a big, gooey, un-eatable mess.

The mix melted into one big flat puddle that burnt on the edges before it hit 7 minutes in the oven.

I made these exactly per instructions and they turned out great! I was so hesitant because my husband tends to be pretty picky with what he likes and doesn't like but these were a hit! I will definitely make these again but next time I might try pressing a Hershey's Kiss in the middle like one reviewer mentioned.

OK, color me skeptical. In spite of reviews really wondered just how these would be....no flour?? no butter, crisco....all the  usually in peanut butter cookies?? I have searched for years for a pb cookie like the ones I had as a child, every Friday in school they had the most scrumptious pb cookies in my memory.  So, having all the ingredients on hand....who wouldn't(?) I decided to give these a try.  I used entire 18 oz jar of Peter Pan peanut butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar. Two eggs, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp baking soda....I use a sugar spoon when making cookies as it gives a nice sized ball. Rolled top and sides in granulated sugar (yeah...its a cookie folks....so, yum)  Put on my criss cross and baked them at 350 on foil covered, sprayed cookie sheet for 8 minutes and 22 seconds.  Let them cool on rack for at least 5 minutes before moving them to rack to continue to cool. The smell in my entire house screamed Peanut Butter!!!  So, anticipation watering my mouth, I jumped in....omg!  Sandy delicate texture...total peanut butter taste, like no other I have had. These are so totally worth trying. Will try them with Splenda, my daughter doesn't digest sugar....may up the soda just a bit using the Splenda. And look forward to trying them with Natural peanut butter...no additives...Outstanding, and thank you to the original poster and for all the reviewers! 60 cookies 1 inch ball 2 inch cookie. Do not overbake. time depends entirely on your oven and your type of p

Took the advice of others and replaced one of the cups of sugar with brown sugar and cut down baking soda to one teaspoon. They turned out perfect! I also sprinkled a little bit of sugar on top of the cookies before baking. Best peanut butter cookies I've made so far!

The recipe is true to the directions and produced a nice pretty batch of cookies.  The taste of the cookies was just ok for me. They had too much of an egg-like taste which I am not accustomed too when eating peanut butter cookies, I am normally a big fan of peanut butter cookies.  I guess gluten free products is an acquired taste that I definitely have not acquired yet....at least not as it relates to these cookies. I don't think I will make this version of these again. Thanks.

This is my go to recipe! They really are the best! My friend  requested them for her next visit and I'm happy to make them! These are chewy cookies. If you want for of a cake like cookie. Substitute the baking soda for baking poweder, but put 3 times the amount. It works, because I just did it. =)

Love these cookies.  I added the suggested one tablespoon of gluten free oat flour.  Also, I used someone else's suggestion and whipped the eggs, and vanilla until they formed soft peaks, and then added the sugar, and continued mixing well.  I reduced the sugar, I used 3/4 cup of natural cane sugar, and 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  (I think next time, I will reduce both to 1/2 cup as the cookies were still a bit sweet for me.). Then I added the peanut butter (used a whole jar of Smuckers Natural creamy, 16 ozs.), and the tablespoon of GF oat flour, mixed well, and then added the salt and soda.  I made small balls, and used another person's suggestion of using a potato masher to lightly flatten the balls - this is a GENIUS idea, one little squish and you're done.  Baked them for 10 minutes, and they came out crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and made perfect little 2" cookies.  This is the only recipe that I will ever use for peanut butter cookies.  It's perfect.  Thank you so much!

I made one batch as directed in this recipe and they turned out very dry and crumbly. Edible, but certainly would not serve them to guests. 

I added butter to the remaining batter and they were perfect. The recipe I used was: 
1 cup of NATURAL peanut butter
1 cup of regular creamy peanut butter
1 cup of white sugar
1 cup of brown sugar
2 eggs
2 tsps baking soda
1 tsp vanilla
3/4 cup light butter

Baked on an aluminum foil lined cookie sheet lightly sprayed with cooking spray at 350 for 9 1/2 minutes. (This allows for easier removal.) For a festive holiday cookie, allow to cool slightly and place a holiday kiss in the center of each cookie.

Well, I was looking for a super easy recipe as I just don't have the bakers touch, and figured I'd try these. The recipe is very easy and with all the great reviews, I thought they would turn out great...wrong.  I made them with natural organic pb, 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of brown sugar and they were YUCK! I really do't think it's the recipe though because normally only 1 out of 10 new recipes that I try turn out haha I was hoping this was one of them.

Pretty good plain but I would change it to 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup white then add cinnamon a little milk and melted butter and using all organic ingredients makes it a pretty healthy cookie and then would rate it at 5 stars

I tweaked this recipe just a bit. I did only 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar (instead of the 2 cups of sugar). These cookies just came out of the oven and are so warm and yummy. I found this recipe to be super duper easy which I like because if its too complicated I don't even try it. I could eat all of them.....but I think I will leave some for the kids! lol

Quick and easy to make and turned out well. The texture is a bit weird to me, but not bad. You have to let them cool well because they take a while to set. I used chunky peanut butter, and added a bit of cocoa. Definitely keeping this in my recipe box!

I used granulated sugar and had to add a third egg to make the dough stick together.  The taste is pretty good but they are very greasy when forming the cookie.  Mine did not spread at all.  I will try this recipe again either with powdered, less granulated or some brown sugar.  Two members of my family are gluten free so it is worth experimenting.

The children (with adult supervision, of course) made  these cookies last night.  Phenomenal! I'm rating it a 4 simply because there are no 1/2 stars, otherwise it would be 4.5.  I'm subtracting 0.5 stars because it is tooooooooo sweet.   Next time we make this, we are going to use 1/2 - 3/4 less sugar.  We added semi-sweet chocolate chips and it proved to be a delicious addition to this super simple cookie recipe.  This is a definitely "MUST SAVE"!

These cookies were pretty easy to make which I appreciate. I made them just as the recipe specified. I didn't give them a five because although these were good - I'd might make them again sometime  - but they didn't blow my mind. Maybe I should try the all natural kind as others had suggested. I just used skippy because that's what I had. Overall it was a good cookie, it was just not the best peanut butter cookie recipe that I've ever had/made.

Made these as directed using the top-rated review.  If substituting with Splenda, use 2 cups. The cookies were not that sweet using only one cup of Splenda. (Note: When I sub Splenda, I usually use half the measure because Splenda is sweeter.) We recently bought commercially made flourless peanut butter cookies and they were crumbly, but full of sugar, I am sure. These are a treat even though you must wash them down with coffee or milk.

Was looking for peanut butter cookies that look like the picture...made the recipe exactly as written but they spread.  Taste okay...just not super thick like I was hoping for.

These were the worst peanut butter cookies I have ever eaten. They are so chewy, not good chewy, make your teeth stick together chewy. Next time, I would add flower and take out some of the sugarâ€¦ which would make it an entirely different recipe.

The PROS of this recipe are, 1.) these cookies were BOTH gluten- and dairy-free, perfect for my family and I, 2.) the cookies were easy to make.
The CONS of these cookies are that, 1.) the cookies were a bit dry, and 2.) I had to cook them a bit longer than required, or they'll crumple as I tried to take them off the parchment paper.
But why 5 stars out 5? They were gluten- and dairy free, which means a LOT, and they turned out better than the last batch of peanut butter cookies (with a different recipe for pb cookies) I made.

What I'm surprised isn't mentioned more is that this is a gluten free cookie recipe! Just made my first batch. Followed the recipe except pressing down with a fork, then I pulled out of the over about 3 minutes before finishing. I pressed a spoon to the center of the cookie and filled with strawberry preserves then finished baking. Made a great PB&J cookie. No problems with the cookies being flat, I actually thought they were quite plump.

I made these with natural peanut butter and 1 C white sugar and 1 C brown sugar. They were perfect! Don't forget to grease your baking sheets well for these.

I thought I had peanut butter but didn't.... However I had almond butter and used that instead. It still tasted really good although id probably use less sugar or try a mix of brown sugar like someone suggested.

I made this because I was looking for a dessert that didn't require butter.  Trying to form the dough left my hands literally dripping with oil.  It kept falling apart; I needed to really squish it together.  The final cookie was deemed ok by my kids, but I find it leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.  I think it's the baking soda that is leaving bad taste.  I won't make these again.

These cookies are fabulous! I was pretty sure that I was a terrible baker, due to the fact that all my cookies were coming out spongy. Then I tried this recipe. I only changed one thing and that was that I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. Thanks for giving me the courage to continue baking and not just give up!

These went super fast, everyone loved them! We rolled half in sugar before we baked them, and those had to be pressed with a fork. The other half was super awesome too, but no need for the fork. Not sure why, but I really enjoyed them both ways, but there really is no need to add extra sugar. We made these a day ahead and baked them all at once. Every last one was wonderful, beautiful, and the best peanut butter cookie I ever ate. :) (no I didn't eat all of them, it was tempting though)

Loved this recipe! I used crunchy natural peanut butter (the kind you have to stir). We did have to add a bit of water to the dough as it started to turn crumbly using the KitchenAid mixer. (I think we over mixed.)  The cookies turned out crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside - my perfect kind of cookie.  You can try cutting the sugar by 1/4 a cup if you don't want as sweet a cookie but if you make just as listed they are good too! I used parchment paper for easy clean up and cooked exactly 10 minutes. The cookies were not "gritty" and cooked perfectly. As others have mentioned, space them as indicated for a more perfect looking cookie - and these will be on the flatter side. Now that I know this is an excellent recipe on its own, I'll try some of the other tips (1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar, using part Nutella, etc.) My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

I can't say I was a huge fan of these cookies...they did not hold together well and came out very flat. This may have been my fault though because I used applesauce to replace the eggs. I do this frequently with cookies and it usually makes them even better but these just didn't work. However, I must say that they did taste good...and the dough was absolute perfection :)

Would it be okay to mix this and refrigerate overnight, baking them the following day? Need them for an after-work function and would like to bake them right before the event, if possible. Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer some insight! I can only post this if I rate the recipe--so, since it sounds great, I'll rate it pretty high, even though I haven't tried it yet. :)

My husband is a huge peanut butter fan so any time I am in a "baking mood" he always wants a peanut butter dessert. I made these because I wanted to bake but didn't have enough flour for most recipes and came across this recipe. This is now my husbands new favorite cookie recipe that I make, and that says a lot! I cut the recipe in half and adjusted the sugar like other reviewers mentioned. I also used skippy natural PB, and add semi-sweet and white chocolate chips and baked for 8 min. I have made them twice now and my husband still gives them 5 stars!!

I found this recipe to be a great one. Quick and easy, very simple and would work well for baking with children "although I have none." I just made the balls larger than recommended for a more chewy center. Again good recipe.

They were crispy but not tooo much that it would disolve in your mouth. I used 1cup of jify peanut butter and 1 cup natural pb... Best cookies iv made by far... Enjoy!!!! All my kiddos including the biggest, my hubby, loved them and they did not last.

I'm getting ready to move, and most of my kitchen stuff is packed away. I also just went through the last of the butter last night. I wanted to make some cookies for my boyfriend tonight, though, and found this recipe. I did a few things differently, because as I mentioned, I was working with limited supplies. 

Firstly I used I.M Healthy Soynut butter, because I don't use peanut butter. BF loves it though, so I thought he might enjoy these cookies. I used 1/2 cup sugar, 1 egg, a pinch of salt, and 1/4 tsp vanilla.

They needed to cook about 10 minutes,and the insides are pretty gooey, but they hold together well especially after cooling. I think the soynut butter, something I've had trouble adjusting to,  since I still remember and long for the taste of PB, actually works pretty well with this recipe. With the soynut butter, though, they seem to be a bit sweeter (nothing a tall glass of milk can't fix!)

7/10, would make again. Perhaps with a different type of soybutter next time.

This recipe makes absolutely exquisite peanut butter cookies. With just enough saltiness yet still very sweet, these cookies are perfect for get togethers, parties, etc. I would definitely recommend this recipe. From children to adults, everyone will adore this simple snack!

these cookies were just awful! i read all the positive reviews and i love peanut butter cookies, so i thought id try these. biggest waste of time ever! i split the recipe in half and used half cup brown sugar and a half cup white sugar. they were crumbly, but not in a yummy-cookie way, but they just fell apart. after 8 min they just started burning. then biting into them tasted like hardened sugar, with no peanut butter taste at all. never making again.

This cookie was good. Not great. However I must confess that I did use coconut palm sugar in some and honey in the rest as we don't eat refined sugar or wheat in our house. The honey was better than coconut sugar but both unfortunately crumbled apart and I don't think that's just substituting the sugars cause honey is quite wet. I used natural peanut butter. They were definitely not like some great flour butter and sugar peanut butter cookies I've made before. But since I don't get to eat cookies anymore it was a nice treat. Not great just nice.

First Time Rating!
Quick Back Story:  I'm 3 months pregnant and had a sudden, intense craving for something sweet.  I checked the pantry because I wanted to make sugar cookies, but I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I checked AllRecipes for recipes with the ingredients that I had on hand and I discovered this one.

Result: I love this recipe!  It's so quick and really easy. I made this recipe by using super chunky peanut butter the first time and used the chunky peanut butter again with chocolate chips added the next day.  I combined this recipe with a glass of skim milk and I am in peanut butter heaven.

I did not care for this recipe. The first batch cooked as I was taking off cookie sheet just crumbled. The 2nd I made a little thicker, same thing crumbled as taking off cookie sheet. I tasted the bits, has a great flavor but cookie does not stay together.

Had a craving for cookies but didn't want a lot of work and these were perfect. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar as one reviewer suggested and I'm glad I did. They do spread so don't put them too close together. Great peanut butter cookie recipe!

Good recipe, but it doesn't need the baking soda. I used coconut sugar and honey instead of the white sugar. They were perfect after 8 minutes in the oven.

Great recipe. I did make a few revisions. I used 1C Jiff Creamy peanut butter and 1C Almond butter. 1C white sugar, and 1C brown sugar. Also another trick to get the cookies moist is to add honey. After I mixed all the ingredients, I added some honey to the mixture. I really didn't measure it, I just squeezed some from the bottle, maybe 1/3C. I rolled the dough balls in a little flour before baking. Turned out great!

Found these just yesterday, tried them right away, great cookies but should be made with less sugar..maybe a 1/2 cup less. Next time I will try them with less sugar.  But do enjoy them, they're great.

Thanks, BAKINGNUTS. My only real suggestion to anyone using this recipe is to not touch these cookies until they're at least room temperature. I halved the recipe and left out the baking soda and salt on purpose. I made the cookies 'drop cookie' style because that was the consistency of my dough. Sampling one straight from the oven, it was a crumbling apart mess and not done enough on the inside. No problem. After giving them two minutes more in the oven (12 for total baking time) and leaving them where they were on the cookie sheet, they are quite good for a quick cookie to just whip up on the spot. They're light and salty (salty just from the Peter Pan peanut butter I'd used), which was one reason I'd purposely left out the salt and sodium bicarbonate, but, since no flour is used in this recipe, I really don't even understand any purpose for adding those two leavening agents. These cookies are peanutier-tasting than the customary type recipe, but after cooling they have just the right amount of chewiness that I like. So, thumbs up.

I took these cookies to the care facility my grandpa is in. Luckily, all the residents could have one! They all loved them and asked for more. Best peanut butter cookie recipe out there! They are still good days after you make them!

I made these and they were delicious. Going to make them tomorrow with less sugar and a little jelly on top. I'll add even more peanut butter and will be back to let everyone know how they turned out!

This is a very good cookie.  I wasn't sure how cookies made without flour would taste, but I was certainly surprised.  It was very easy and quick to make.  My family loved it.

I have been making these for more years than I can remember...and they are always a hit!  I have made them using every kind of PB you can think of and I have found the cheap store brands are as good as the "Pure Peanut Butter"   I have been making them for the last couple of years by omitting 1/2 Cup of the sugar thenrolling the balls of dough in the sugar I omitted.... THEN...as soon as I remove them from the oven, I press a chocolate candy melt of the center of each freshly baked cookie...the chocolate melts but still holds it shape.  This makes them taste very much like the peanut butter blossoms.   Another way I make these is to roll the dough balls in sugar and press the fork pattern on them...remove from oven, cool, the drizzle with melted chocolate chips or candy melts. Always a hit.
Happy Baking ...Enjoy!

Great recipe!! They are delicious!
 I love that fact that it's flour-less and have to say, I agree 100% with the other comments, that using natural peanut butter makes the difference!

I tried this recipe the other day and I was very happy with the outcome.  I put the cookies in the cookie jar and 2 days later they were gone.  I did add mini m&m's and I also used  super crunchy peanut butter.  The  hunky peanut butter took it I thought to another level.  This is a real keeper.

Just made these cookies...not what I was expecting.  How can one mess up 6 ingredients?  The dough was very oily and the cookies spread and came out very thin and crispy.  On a good note, my boy's say they taste great, so all is not lost.

These cookies are Awesome!!! My only criticism is that there is a little too much sugar and I agree with other reviews about cutting the sugar down a 1/2 a cup. Otherwise these are definitely one of the best peanut butter cookies I've ever baked!!

After reading reviews, I made these using 1/2 cup less sugar.  Very good but I'll reduce it 3/4 cup next time and then down to 1 cup if necessary.    Mine did not spread while baking (I used the Jif I had on hand and 1.5 tsp baking powder--could not taste it in the cookie).  I also used my little melon ball thingie and it worked great.  Be sure and let sit in pan for a few minutes before taking them out, they're very soft out of the oven.  I use parchment paper and just slide them out onto my cold tile table.  Very fast to make.

Some trial and error got me to the best cookie ever--first I used a store brand natural peanut butter (as many people recommended, the kind with the oil...). The cookies were a bit bland; I was pretty sure they needed more salt. I followed the ingredients as listed and didn't read any reviews about saltiness. 

I tried another batch, but this time I used Smuckers Natural peanut butter and salt was the fix. Smuckers has salt in it, about 100 mg per serving, the store brand I used had none at all. This batch looked better and tasted outstanding!

Easy cookies to make, especially with kids. My picky 3 year old kept eating them!  I substituted 1 cup of white sugar for 1 cup of light brown.  I also used a whole 16.3 oz jar of creamy Skippy.  Cookies are just the right amount of moist and crunchy without being overwhelmingly peanut buttery.

Simple enough to put together but unless you are using the best peanut butter you are going to get almost peanut brittle like pancakes on your tin. I had to use a muffin top pan to get any shape to these and they were toffee chewy. Will not be making again.

I made these for valentine's day and shaped them into hearts. The cookies turned out great! I'm not a big fan of peanut butter cookies, but these were sooo good. They came out thin but nice and chewy. My husband just loved these also. My mom tried them and fell in love. Just one note: I did the half brown sugar and half white sugar that was recommended. I will try just the white sugar to see how they taste also.

These are the BEST peanut Butter Cookies I have ever made. I know Im not tooo bad of a cook LOL but the other ecipes are always soo oily and buttery; ususally calling for shortening. This one seems very light, and i also used an air bake cookie sheet. You can get one from Ross or Marshall's or TJ Maxx for cheapo price;) They are garaunteed to be clean n clear under the cookie. Thanks for the Recipe! I will be keeping this forever!

Gee I'm not sure what happened to me here.  I've always made peanut butter cookies with this basic recipe (flourless) and they've come out sensational.  Following this one...not so much.  I added 1/2C chocolate chips to experiment and they came out poor.  They weren't hard, but they were crispy and airy.  The dough had trouble holding together with the chips so maybe that was why?  I feel that it could also be due to the baking soda; I think 1tsp would have sufficed.  Their presentation is very nice but their taste is just not up to par with peanut butter cookies.

These are great!  I did have to do this twice though, increasing the oven to 375, but i have to do that sometimes anyway when dealing with my personal convection oven.  These are dense and verrrry peanut buttery, best when eaten about an hour and half after baking. I too am not a big fan of peanut butter cookies, but I've been trying to recreate the infamous peanut butter fluffer-nutter from Chucklet & Honey and this is close for the sandwich part, now all I gotta do is figure out that dang fluff!

Followed the recipe exactly except I did one cup white sugar and one cup of brown sugar.  It was fantastic and so easy to make.  My 3 year old was so proud of baking!  We will definitely be making these again, they were so easy and good!

Soooo good! I followed the recipe exactly and my family of 6 devoured them all in less than a day. I pressed the dough with a sugared glass before baking, but ran out of granulated sugar so I had to top them with Splenda. They tasted wonderful and I will absolutely make them again.

I was really excited for these and they just didn't work. They we're too sugary to where you couldn't taste the peanut butter and they kept burning! I had to make a ton of adjustments to these and it just wasn't worth it.

have made these three times using exact same recipe, Jif creamy 18 oz jar. First time they were amazing, crispy outside and chewy but cooked on the inside--perfect cookie, and they stayed thick. Second time they flattened out like pancakes and seemed greasy. This time they don't seem to cook at all even after extra time and 5 mim cooling. 2 stars are for lack of consistency, which changes everything.

With some changes, I was able to make some exceptional peanut butter cookies. I used 1 cup Skippy - Natural No-Stir creamy peanut butter and 1 cup real peanut butter. (By real, I mean the kind that is made literally only by grinding up peanuts. I was able to find this in the healthy/bulk aisle at my grocery store.) I decreased the sugar to 1 cup and decreased the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. I also added about 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I had made these once before and found them to be entirely too sweet, so halving the sugar suited my tastes. Also, don't be afraid to add about 1 tablespoon of flour if your dough needs it.

Awesomely quick and easy to make with my 3-year-old. We used brown sugar instead, but the cookies could not have turned out any better.

Seriously the easiest cookie I have ever made... and very low mess!  Very yummy, but pretty sweet when you use jiff.  I think I would reduce the sugar a bit next time.  I also put chocolate chips onto the top of half of them. Yum!

AMAZING! I loved this cookie. I took the advice of others, I reduced the sugar. I used equal part of brown and white sugar Â¾ cup of each. I also added 4 oz of Hershey semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. I love peanut butter and these were the best peanut butter cookies that I have ever had. They turned out beautiful. Tips: Do not get worried when you start rolling the cookies into balls, they will be very greasy. I used Jif peanut butter not sure if it makes a difference. Important not to over bake the cookies.

Thank you!!!! I love to bake and have been struggling with PB cookies. Too hard and not enough peanutty flavor or doughy tasting. I wanted peanut flavor, crisp, chewy, and delicious.  Isn't that what peanut butter cookies are about. First I listened to reviews and used foil to line my pan. I cooked on 375 with speed bake mode( I like a little crisp browned areas on top like some of the pics). OMG these are awesome. I might take out 1/4 sugar and use crunchy PB next time. By the way I used generic PB and these were GREAT. Flat, crisp, and chewy yum yummy gumdrops!!!! I am so excited!!!

I didn't change anything when I made this recipe except I added m&m's to the mix. I would have given them a 5 without the m&m's though. They came out delicious. If you're looking for a really soft cookie this is not the recipe to use. These are chewy but they are not super soft. Don't bake them more than 12 minutes, they turn to bricks if you do. My father tried this recipe in two batches the same day I made mine and he left one batch in for 15 minutes and he regretted it later. I'm supposed to tell you that these are good with coffee too (according to the peanut gallery) ;)

These cookies did not last in my house! I added chocolate chips to one batch and they were out of this world. I took the advice of others and let them cool completely between batches before moving them to the cooling rack and not one cookie crumbled. They were slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The only modification to the recipe I made was at the suggestion of others as well~I reduced sugar to a cup and a half  but to add a twist I rolled the balls into sugar before baking. Will use this receipe over and over again.

This is amazing! I did the recipe modification suggestion above, using all-natural peanut butter and cutting the sugar to 1.5C. I would never have imagined a flourless cookie would come out like this! All my coeliac and gluten-free friends are going to hear about this!

good flavor, but very crumbly batter and crumbly cookies.  a mess for little ones to eat.  perhaps it was because I used natural peanut butter.

SOOOOO good!! we ate about 15 each the night we made them. i only strayed from the original recipe a bit and it worked out perfectly! i used 1 cup white  1 cup brown sugar. also replaced maple syrup for the vanilla extract. but these cookies are AWESOME! so easy, so quick, i highly recommend them! oh, also, it was really helpful to chill the dough in the fridge (covered) for a bit before putting them on the baking tray! ENJOY!

We loved these cookies!! I did substitute 1 cup of Splenda for 1 cup of sugar, to make them more "friendly."  The texture and flavor were great!  I increased the cooking time to 11 minutes for a little more crispiness.  I will use this recipe again!!

I cut recipe in half because it's just me. I used Adam's Peanut Butter. The only pb I use. (the kind you stir the oil in) I used brown sugar instead.  Dropped them by teaspoonful and didn't flatten them on cookie sheet. Let them cool off a couple minutes so they wouldn't crumble. They turned out fantastic!  This is a keeper for me!

These are the best peanut butter cookies ever - melt in your mouth good!!  I used reduced fat peanut butter (25% less fat) and cut the sugar down to 1 and 1/3 cups instead of the 2 cups.  Quick prep, quick cook.  It doesn't get any easier than this.  Ideal recipe to do with children.

I really wish I had read the reviews about cutting the amount of sugar in half before I made these. Definitely wayy too much sugar for me, and I'm a sugar fiend. Otherwise good except the baking time took a lot longer for me to get a good consistency. Maybe some ingredients were off?

These are outstanding. I used a 16-oz jar of Smucker's Natural Creamy. The cookies didn't spread as much as I'd expected; I could have gotten more on the cookie sheet and didn't need to space them more than maybe 1.5" apart. But wow, these are addictive, and nothing like the store-bought stuff. So easy and fast, too. Thanks so much for this recipe. This is the only peanut butter cookie I will ever make. Perfection!!

I found these cookies good in the edible sense but way too sugary for my taste.  I don't know if I would make these again when there are so many other great recipes out there...like the one in Joy of Cooking!

This is really good. not 5 stars good but a really good no flour, in a hurry cookie. I just realzed we had no cookies for Santa tonight and whipped this up in about 20 minutes. We only had 1 egg left so I just halved the recipe. I find that the trick to not have hard cookies is to not overcook them.  8 minutes seemed about perfect. They are a tiny bit dry but still very tasty.

These are great cookies but they weren't exactly what I was looking for. I did use half brown sugar and half white which I think added to the flavor I was going for. But the texture, while good wasn't like I remember from the PB cookies of my youth. I did like the intense PB flavor from these and the softness. I will make these again but will try a recipe with flour to see if that is what I am missing.

AMAZING. The flavour is really peanut-buttery. I halved the recipe because I didn't want that many and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of the 1 cup white like others suggested. You really do need to wait for them to cool before trying to remove and eat them. I'm impatient, so I tried to remove them after only 3 minutes of cooling and they tore on me. Also, make sure the balls are really quite small because they grow like crazy and spread out a lot, 2 inches of space between each one wasn't enough for me. SO GOOD though! I would definitely make them again, plus the ingredients and those perfect ones that everyone usually has handy :)

Because of the lack of flour, these cookies fall apart very easily. That being said, the flavor is great!  I rolled mine in sugar before baking.

I have renamed these cookies to OH MY GOD Peanut Butter Cookies. These are the best and the easiest to make. Years ago I used to make the best PB cookies and somewhere along the way I lost the recipe, I have tried numerous recipes over the years but none of them had a really good peanut butter taste, then I found this recipe and as I said OH MY GOD. These are the best.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! So easy! I did do 1/2C dark brown sugar and 1 & 1/2 C white sugar, and I added 1/2 Tbsp flour- the flour probably was not needed. This recipe is a total keeper.  I would not use any kind of organic peanut butter because the consistency would be too runny.

After reading all of the great reviews, I was excited to give this recipe a try.  I don't know what I did wrong... I followed the directions exactly.  However, my cookies came out paper-thin and not like the ones pictured in other reviews.  The taste was not bad, but nothing to rave about.  I even tried to add flour as one of the reviewers suggested, but this helped little and the cookies were too crumbly to even eat after adding the flour.

I don't know what to say but YUM!  I brought these to work and everyone raved.  They could not get over the fact they were flourless.  I used chunky pb and followed everything but the cooking time, only because my oven runs a bit hot.  Amazing, will make again and again.  Thank you!

Cookies were good.  I did cut the sugar in half (& it could have used another 1/4 or so off).  sorta crumbly, but good.  I added chocolate chunks, and you definitely need to cut the sugar more if you do that.

Very easy recipe which I loved, this cookie was too sweet for me and I used only 1 cup of sugar but next time I would use 1/2 cup and maybe try brown sugar instead of white.  The texture is great crispy on the outside and chewy in the centre.  Make sure you leave lots of room as these cookies spread.  Also I used peanut butter with salt already added so no need to add salt.

Made half the recipe and they turned out fantastic.  Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, but left everything else the same.  They are VERY peanut butter-y.  A glass of milk with these is a must.  Would absolutely make again.

Made these and took them to church. Husband, my kids and teens at church loved them! Another youth leader even requested the recipe. Great that they can be "gluten-free" too. Yum Yum.

I was looking for a quick cookie recipe as I couldnt be bother to nip to the shop!  I came across this one & it was great!!! Lovely, simple recipe & taste amazing!!! I only buy whole earth natural peanut butter not that  stuff thats loaded with salt & sugar, which I think probably makes them taste better! Even my son liked them & he does like peanut butter!!

This is a great peanut Butter cookie recipe.  I did take the advice of another review and used 1/2 cup less of the sugar.  I also put a dove chocolate in the center of each cookie and of course this is what made the cookie even more Fantastic!!!  I will use this again!!

Very peanut buttery.  Easy to make.  I reduced sugar to 1 1/2 C. and used half white sugar, half brown, but added milk chocolate chips.  Next time, I'd reduce it even more.  Very crumbly dough.

These cookies tasted good. I made this afternoon and the kids couldn't stop eating them. As suggested, I used natural peanut butter but next time I will have to add a couple Tbsp of flour to give them a better texture.

These are perfect if you want quick, easy, but delicious cookies. They are thin, moist, and chewy. I made the recipe without making any revisions to it and my cookies were just fine.

These cookies are good, but not the best. They are almost too sugary, when you bite into them there aren't chewy, more gritty. However, they taste really good.

These cookies have a weird consistency! They did not look done at 8-10 minutes. They are somewhat thin and chewy. They look nothing like what the picture shows.  Not what I was expecting. They were ok tasting, but they're far from the best cookies ever. I will try another recipe next time.

Made these as a trial version to my own recipe and turned out great. I did reduce the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups & were still very good. Took them to work & they were gone in no time and asking for more. Will be making these again.

This recipe makes the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had. I was a little concerned by the lack of flour and the few ingredients, but I made it exactly as the instructions say (although I used reduced-fat Jif) and it turned out great. If you like chewy cookies, this is a good recipe. I like that there is no extra butter in the recipe, and it is so simple.

These cookies tasted good, but the consistency was just dreadful.  I dont know if it is because I used natural peanut butter, but they were crumbly from the beginning.  I could barely keep them together enough to put on the cookie sheet.  I made 24 cookies, and then could not stand it anymore and pitched the rest of the dough.

This recipe is odd, and flourless. The dough is tasty, but I have had better. 
I would recommend cookie for only 5 minutes.

This is the most peanut-buttery peanut butter cookie I've ever eaten!  This is definitely for peanut butter lovers.  The recipe is super simple, quick and tasty.  The cookies are pretty dense, but soft and moist.  Yum!

These were some of the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made. I used all natural peanut butter as some other reviews had suggested. I do not think that the other kinds would have made them this good. I also added some choc chips and peanut butter chips.  yummy!

These were pretty good for peanut butter cookies. I'm really not a fan  of peanut butter but some how I ended up with 3 tubs of peanut butter in my pantry and I had to use some up.  This was really simple, too.  My fiance said they were great (he likes peanut butter cookies.)

Absolutely delicious!  These are so chewy-not cakey at all like traditional peanut butter cookies.  The name says it all.  They are the best I've made.  One thing I did different was roll them in sugar before creating criss-cross design.  This was not needed and I will not do this next time I make them.  They are perfectly sweet just the way the recipe is written.  No modifications needed here.

There were unbelievably easy and delicious!! I used the natural peanut butter, as suggested by some of the other users, and had a slightly heavy hand on the vanilla.  It was a tad hard to mix because of the viscosity of the peanut butter but using two spoons like salad tossers, the batter came together very nicely.  I will definitely make these many more times!!

Awesome recipes!  Instead of egg though, I used some syrup and added some flour to it, and it came out jsut as lovely.  (We don't use many eggs here since I am a vegetarian.)  I also made a chocolate drizzle icing that I put on half the cookie out of some left over hot cocoa mix.  Thanks for sharing this recipes!!!  Made our night!

I followed the recipe almost exactly - I cut down on the sugar a bit and used half white and half brown.  

The texture after mixing was a bit questionable, but I shaped them the best I could anyway.  After baking for 10 minutes the bottom of the cookie was cooked but the top was really really raw.  I ended up having to put them under the broiler for a couple minutes.  After the cookies were sufficiently cooked and cooled, they more or less fell apart.  They were thin, flat and very fragile - the edges were nice and crisp but the middle fell apart easily.  I'm eating one with a fork at the moment.  The cookie's flavour is quite good but the texture/consistency is horrible.  I would recommend finding another recipe unless you like eating cookies with a fork!

I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I didn't add vanilla those were the only things I think I changed. They were delicious but they fall apart easily.

This recipe is great.  Ive made them with natural peanut butter, and the result is a denser cookie. I didnt like it as much, neither did my roommates.
  I found the best results by using the recipe as is, no changes, except chocolate chips! Theyre amazing!!  Always rave reviews about them.

Edible, but I did not care for them... these turned into oily, overly crunchy rocks.  There clearly needs to be something to bind the ingredients together...

Perfect cookie! My daughter HATES peanut butter, but she's been eating the cookies since I've baked them! I gave the cookie 4 stars because I added some original butter in it so that it would not split up while being baked, and I also put the dough in the fridge for an hour before cooking so that the cookies were beautifully shaped. It has a great taste, I recommend it to all bakers!

These were moist, but you can hear the sugar crunching between your teeth when you eat them.  Lacks something, but not bad for a quick easy cookie.

Really good cookie. My kids found it too peanutbuttery. I did not think so at all but I will add less sugar next time and just barely flaten them with my hand instead of using the tines of a fork, they turned out too crumbly to hold that way.

These are pretty good.  I think they would be even better if I substitute one cup of white sugar for brown sugar.  I will try that next time.  Other than that I would change a thing.

Not too bad. My husband absolutely LOVED them, but I am not a huge fan of the extra chewey texture. I made them with reduced fat Jif peanut butter, perhaps this is why they did not come out softer? Next time I will try with regular peanut butter and provide an update.

I was a little hesitant trying this recipe. I was affraid it would turn out something like the Peanut Butter Playdough from grade school. To my surprise and the delight of the hubby and kids this recipe produced a delicious cookie. We liked best that the cookie stayed moist and tender, even the batch that I slightly over cooked. No dry floury mess. This is definately a keeper.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made and were a huge hit with my family. I was asked to make them twice in one week. The only change I made to the recipe was instead of using 2 cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown. This is a keeper!

These cookies are great!  A bit crumbly and dry, but wonderful and rich!  I cut sugar by 1/2c., omitted salt, threw in a few tablespoons of flour and a bit extra vanilla.  Perfect!  Easily veganized with some egg replacer :)

I'm not sure if it was become I substituted half of the sugar with brown sugar but these didn't come out that well for us.

My boyfriend and I made these cookies using all natural peanut butter, as others have suggested. I'm not sure if it was because we aren't used to the natural PB, but these cookies came out tasting a little bland to me. They were also a little too dry and crunchy for my taste, I prefer softer cookies.

When I make the fork-indentations, they tend to crumble (A LOT) on the edges, so they're not gift-worthy appearance-wise, but the flavor is pretty darn good.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars only because I found that I missed the flour in the recipe. This recipe was super easy and it did make a good tasting cookie.  I used 16oz natural pb, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup white sugar, 3t vanilla and nixed the salt.  I will make these again when I have a craving for pb cookies without having all the ingredients for traditional pb cookies. I think next time I'll add 3/4 cup chocolate chunks, too! I did like the fact that there is no butter in the recipe.  I would recommend trying if you haven't, you may be pleasantly surprised!

This is a really good recipe for cookies.  I rated it a 4, as I made some changes after reading other reviews.  I put in 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 wheat germ.  I kept everything else the same.  My kids are loving these.  I will making these again for sure.

Just made these and I have to say they're pretty good! Usually, I don't seem to have any flour around so this is pretty convenient. I didn't have the two cups of PB so I cut the recipe in half and it turned out great. And it made plenty of cookies. The trick's not to overbake these. That'll keep 'em chewy. I even tried rolling the balls in some sweetened coconut that I had leftover. Would definitely try this recipe again, especially with some brown sugar.

Yum!  I used organic peanut butter with the only ingredient being peanuts.  The dough was a little sticky but the texture and taste once cooked was fabulous!

Our first attempt results were a sandy, crumbly texture. I will try different ways to make this because they tasted good and when using Splenda are dietetic.

Excellent.  I used 1 1/4 Cups sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar. Also used Jif peanut butter, a tad over 2 cups. Was not gritty or overly sweet.   I used Reynolds non-stick foil and sprayed it with cooking spray.  Baked for 8 min.  Was chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  I am not allowed to eat wheat, although I prefer peanut butter cookies with flour, this is a great exchange.  Will defn. keep this recipe.

I gave these three stars because my fiance ate HALF of the cookies when he got home from work. . .and the only reason he didn't eat the other half is because I hid them.  HE loved them, I wasn't so crazy.  Next time I'll make them with powdered sugar instead of the granulated.  They did have a bit of a grit to them.  They are flat cookies, so I chilled the dough and then dropped them without flattening with the criss-cross.  I used reduced-fat crunchy PB and can't imagine using regular because of how greasy mine were.  Natural PB would be awesome.  Dust the bottoms AND tops with a little powdered sugar (they're not the prettiest cookie).  Take my advice and you won't be disappointed.  I'll make them again.

This is a stellar recipe!  I used this as an alternate to my usual tollhouse cookies, and they were a huge hit!  One of the guys at work keeps asking me to bring them in again!  Just remember to let them cool before taking them of the tray, and they will melt in your mouth.  I did have to make them look like the peanut butter cookies of old so I pressed them with a fork dipped in sugar... YUM!

One word....three letters.....YUM!!  Prep time for these cookies is minimal and they taste fantastic.  I doubled the recipe for Christmas cookies this year and should have quadrupled it!  The new Reynolds Release foil is great for these, too!  No messy greasing cookie sheets!  You won't be sorry chosing this peanut butter cookie recipe!  This one will stay on my "regulars" list for Christmas, for sure!  :-D

MMMmmmmm!!!  I just made some of these super yummy cookies, and I love it!  It's fast and easy.  When the cookies were baked for 8 minutes, the cookies had a crunchy outside, and chewy middle.  When they were cooked for 10 minutes, they were just crunchy.  =9   For anyone having trouble with cookies baking as one, try chilling the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes or more.  That should prevent it from melding together. :)

My mom has been making these exact cookies (but without the baking soda or salt) since I was little, and everybody loves them!  Can't say enough good about them, you just have to try them!

These were the easiest cookies to make!  My co-workers liked them alot.  I don't particularly care for peanut butter, let alone the cookies, but these tasted pretty good.

These were easy to make and tasted okay, but I prefer my regular peanut butter cookie recipe. They had a tendency to burn on the bottoms for some reason--I checked my oven, and the temperature was fine. I won't be making them again soon.

I have made these outstanding cookes about 10 times and they are wonderful!  I've taken a batch to the office before and they were gobbled up by my coworkers.  Several folks asked for the recipe.  I use Kroger brand natural peanut butter when I make them and they turn out great.  Be sure to stir the oil back into the natural peanut butter before using it.

This is a great recipe.  I never met a peanut butter cookie I liked until I made these!  You do need to cook a little longer and make sure the balls are small, but they are delicious!

A really great cookie, easy to make, although i had to cook it a bit longer (12 minutes) than what the recipe called for. It went over great at my New Year's Eve Party.

This recipe is FABULOUS for first timers and kids!
It makes a lot of cookies for the small amount of ingredent used.
The only down side is a slightly too sweet, grainy cookie.

I'm a mother of 8 children ranging from 11 years
to 18 months, all of whom love to help in the
kitchen.  I love this recipe it was fast and very 
easy.  We made a double batch and the kids all
agreed that this will be our number 1 recipe
for cookies.
