This bread was very good, and I like the fact that I didn't have to make a special trip to the store to get the ingredients!  I intend to serve this as an after school snack!  I really enjoyed this recipe, once I made the following adjustments:

I had to add a BIT more water (gradually) so that I could work with the dough.  The recipe didn't specify to do so, but I did chill the  dough prior to baking, with good results.  Also, I added the "three sisters," cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, to the sugar I put on the dough.  I also doubled this recipe, and it was BARELY enough, everyone liked it so well!  I followed the directions for rolling out and frying, but after about four of them, mine were too doughy, and I personally don't like oil, so I took the rest of the flattened balls (I rolled all of them and the flattened them all at once), laid them out and cut them into strips with a pizza cutter and baked at 345 until golden!  Served with honey butter, and both blackberry and strawberry preserves  (and vanilla ice cream), these went faster than I could bake them!  The next time I make this recipe, I'm going to try baking small rounds of it over inverted ramikens to make little edible dessert bowls.  This is a keeper!

I substituted flour for pancake mix. I was looking for an easy recipe for my fiance' to make. I rolled them a little thinner than recipe called for, and fried them as directed. They were very good, even with pancake mix. I then mixed some butter and honey together to make honey butter and dipped the bread into the butter. MMM!

Very simple to make. I substituted 1/4 of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour and liked the "nutty" taste that resulted. Very similar to chapatti, just sweeter.

This recipe was so easy and wonderful. Tip: I added sliced banannas to the center before re-rolling it, and it tastes just like bananna roti I used to eat in Chaing Mai, Thailand. Drizzle some sweetend condensend milk on top for the truly authentic version. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good, and simple, since these ingredients are always on hand.  Also can be made more or less sweet with the amount of sugar added.  Requires some messy rolling, however.

you need to sprinkle this with sugar at the end or it is just a tortilla. and dont roll them out thin, roll them out medium.

i liked this a lot. its REALLY delicious if u use brown sugar, too- but keep it away frum the edges and really coat it in flour so the sugar doesnt burn. i rolled it in some cornmeal, also, for added flavor and crunch. after making the balls, i just made however many of the breads i wanted, then refridgerated the rest for when i wanted to make some. My only complaint is that it takes a lot of effort to roll it thin.

This was great! it reminded me of a flat version of pita bread. the only thing I would do different next time is add more sugar, and roll it paper thing before cooking it. I will be making it again.

I really liked this recipe. I used cinnamon and sugar to make this a great flat bread to put my favorite fruit pie filling on: Apple. These also go well with apple butter, peaches and just about any other fruit one can think of to make a quick, easy dessert.

I hate working with dough, but this is a REALLY simple recipe and I loved the sweetness of the bread.  I used about a teaspoon of sugar or so with each golf-sized dough ball and these came out wonderful!  I will definitely make again, maybe using some other spices too.  Yum!

Not impressed. I don't have a rolling pin, so I made these a little thick. The first one I had was interesting, but the flavor got old really quickly. They would have been more bearable with jam or honey, but in my opinion, if something needs a sweet and tasty topping to make it sweet and tasty, then it wasn't that great in the first place.

Good! Mine puffed up on the skillet. They were pretty sweet so my husband left his bread for last and called it "dessert". I ate mine with my food (Aloo Pujhia and channa masala) and really liked it.

Cooks up like a tortilla + tastes like a tortilla = a tortilla recipe.  A tasty tortilla, but not what I was looking for.  I made them as I cooked, adjusting the amount of sugar and playing with the thickness.  Like a previous reviewer said, I agree medium thickness is good. It was only sweet after I started sprinkling cinnamon and sugar over them right after cooking.  It ended up being much like the cinnamon tortilla chips I use with fruit salsa.  Not like any sweet Indian bread I've ever had.

Pretty good. I substituted the white flour for wheat flour cup for cup. I liked it best with a truly light sprinkling of sugar--just enough to complement the salt and nutty wheat while keeping it from being a dessert. This went great with Lentil Soup (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Lentil-Soup/Detail.aspx)
Thanks!

Good recipe. However the second rolling for me was very, very messy - the dough was incredibly sticky. I ended up having to soap my rolling pin to get it clean. :(  So I won't be making this again although I really did like it.

I agree with the reviewer that compared these to fried tacos.  I did fry them vs cooking in a thin layer of oil.  I did fold in the sugar (and cinnamon and nutmeg)as described, however it really needed a coating of the same after cooking.  I rolled in advance and then layered the prerolled breads with wet papertowels, so I could fry after guests arrived.  Everyone liked, but they didn't seem "Indian" to me.  I will try a naan recipe next time.  But, considering the ease of the ingrediants and a quick prep; these were pretty good.

I don't know if it was my mistake, but the bread was awfully chewy. Too hard for my liking. Maybe it's because I had to use quite a bit more water than suggested. Or maybe it was because I patted it out too thin. In any case, this combination of ingredients and techniques did not work.

Ours didn't puff up quite like that, but we let them sit a little before frying them. We're going to keep trying until we get it right!

This was good considering the number of ingredients in it!  I've been stuck in a hostel for a week until the cheque clears so I can sign a lease and really wanted to make something sweet - this was perfect.  Easy, and I didn't have to buy any perishibles.

Yummy, and an easy bread to make, but involves a lot of rolling!

My whole family just loved this.  I used this as the finish to an Indian food night and everyone just went wild for it.  It was so easy and fun to make.  I drizzled honey over it to add some extra sweetness.

If you're in the mood for a sweet bread, these roti will quickly hit the spot.  With ingredients virtually no kitchen is without, it isn't necessary to plan ahead to make them.  The dough comes together quickly, and they cook up fast on the stovetop.  The sugar lamination is a pleasant surprise when you bite into them.  They're certainly no pastries, but for their intended purpose as a simple, sweet flatbread, they more than merely fit the bill!

Tastes good, but it turns out different every time we do it. My husband rolls it out a lot thinner than me, and we sometimes use different types of frying oil.

This should not be categorized as a diabetic-friendly recipe. Between the sugar and white flour, this would raise the blood glucose level very quickly.

Wonderfully easy recipe!  Instead of using flour to roll the dough, I used a very fine corn meal, for just a little something extra flavour wise, and for a slight crispness.  Love serving them with pumpkin soup.

I thought it tasted okay, my hubby thought it tasted like flour tortilla with sugar and he ate almost all of it.  I added cinnamon and sugar together to give it a better flavor.

I woke up this morning with a craving for homemade donuts, but I knew that our plans for the day would not give me enough time for a yeast dough. I was actually looking for something more like a Navajo fry bread when I came across this recipe for Indian (from India) bread. And boy am I glad I did.

The dough comes together quickly and easily and really doesn't even need to rest for very long. You do want to be careful not to overknead and create a tough texture.

On the step that calls for sprinkling sugar over the dough before folding it into a square, I suggest instead dipping one side into a bowl of sugar. The amount that sticks will be just enough to give your fried bread a slight sweetness without making it impossible to roll out.

I like to roll these out just slightly thicker than a pancake. This will allow them to fry up fast without getting overly chewy.

I don't know how these might taste after sitting around for several hours, as they simply didn't last that long. But they were as good, if not better, after they had cooled down for about fifteen minutes after frying.

My husband and kids both loved this, as did I. We'll definitely be making them again.

Edited to Add: I realized after making these again that I didn't quite follow the recipe. I added the sugar to the dough initially, and then I added more sugar during the process of rolling out the small dough balls. It works perfectly to give you a sweet bread that is perfect for breakfast.

This recipe has become a staple in our home! It turns out great every time. Sometimes I switch things up and use salty/spicy seasonings and serve these with dinner. The original recipe is also great with a light drizzle of honey while they're still warm. Wonderful recipe!

I liked it, I substituted the veg oil for softened butter. I also added allspice, cinnamon & cardamom to the sugar, also as most others who commented, I made mine a bit thinner. But worked well. ty!
