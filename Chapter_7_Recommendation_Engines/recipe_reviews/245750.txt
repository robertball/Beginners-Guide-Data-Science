Perfect icing recipe for the carrot cake I made. 
I didn't like using cream cheese for  frosting since 9 out 10  carrot cake frosting recipes posted call for cream cheese. The only thing I modified was using confectioner sugar instead of granulated as the recipe suggested. 
I'm sure there are plenty of lactose intolerant people out there would consider this recipe as a wonderful option since it turned out superb!

This is nothing more than a sweetened whipped cream. I find many Black Forest cakes use a stabilized whipped cream. This is good in a hurry, but I will try to find a durable frosting to be able to decorate any more Black Forest cakes I make.
