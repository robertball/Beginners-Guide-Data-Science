This was so delicious I made it three times over the Holidays. Everyone loved it. Followed the recipe ingredients exactly, however, changed a couple of procedures the second time. There is no need to break up the white chocolate and dip into the dark.  Simply spread the melted dark chocolate over the white. As long as you add the shorthening, the dark will stay in place when you break up the bark. I also switched from hard peppermint candies to the soft. It will not stick to your teeth the way the hard does. The candy literally melts in your mouth. Ohhh so good. Thanks for a real keeper.

This turned out great, just be sure to spread the white chocolate really thin or it gets to thick when you dip in dark. I also did a batch dipped in chopped peanuts, very good too. Nice addition to my chrismas baking tins.

I gave this 5 stars despite hating this recipe....because I only hate it since I can NOT stop eating it!!!  It is sooooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I have to say, I got some aggression out while smashing the candy to smithereens, which was awesome.  I used a hammer.  I highly suggest that method.  Also, I didn't bother with the measurements of the pans.  While helpful as a guide, let's face it, this isn't meant to be a pristine, uniform candy.  It is like broken glass...pretty in its own right, but who cares about particulars?  So, Daughter and I broke it up and tasted it to make sure it warranted the melted milk chocolate step...yep, you can stop right there.  Delicious!  But, take it to the next level and dip it in the chocolate?!!!  Oh my!  Absolutely wonderful.  Too bad for everyone else as it will likely be gone before they try it.  Thanks for sharing :)

So yummy and pretty. The only thing I changed was to add a little peppermint extract to the white chocolate mixture.

This is an excellent, easy recipe, but it can be easier. Instead of breaking apart the white chocolate and dipping it in the milk chocolate, just remove the chocolate from the pan, keeping it on the foil. Melt the milk chocolate, then spread it in a thin layer over the white chocolate, using an offset spatula. Break in to pieces when set. Easy-peezy!

This recipe could not get easier! I decided to use a food processor to blend some of the peppermint candies, and I put the rest in a zip-loc and smashed them up with a meat mallet (great stress reliever, haha). This gave me two different textures in the candy and worked out really well. It's so good!

This is so good! I didn't use the shortening because I never have in cooking and think it's gross. I poured the white chocolate mixture, let it cool, then poured the semi-sweet chocolate over it, sprinkled it with holiday m&m's, let it cool, and then broke it apart. I didn't use peppermint extract and I thought it had a strong peppermint taste withou it. I chopped the peppermints in the blender. The size of them ranged from snall peices to dust. It was quick and the white chocolate turned out great. Delicious!

After stupidly burning the first white chocolate in the microwave, I redid it. I will definately make this again.

I brushed the semi sweet choclate on top of the white chocolate which is much easier that the dipping method called out in the recipe. So yummy!

These were so good. I wish I had made a double batch. Sent these to family for Christmas and they all loved it. And it was so easy.
