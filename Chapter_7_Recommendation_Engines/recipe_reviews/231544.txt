MissiFizzle...the garlic and annatto powder are SUPPOSED to be listed twice, you ADD more after you brown the chicken!!  Maybe then it would be a 5 star recipe, a lot more flavor!!

Great recipe!  Yes, the annatto and garlic are listed twice, because they are used twice...SMH.  McCormick now has ground annatto (Achiote Molido), so it's a little easier to find in larger grocery stores.  The second time I made it I used reduced sodium soy sauce, and it definitely cut down on the saltiness from when I originally tried the recipe but kept the same great flavor.  This one's a keeper!

I am making this recipe for the second time. It's great! Since annatto is a coloring (and I couldn't find it), I substituted a little turmeric. Last time I made it with chicken, this time I mixed pork and chicken and used a slow cooker. It was also wonderful! Since you end up with a ton of sauce, I thickened it with cornstarch at the very end and served it over UNSALTED rice. The sauce is quite salty (guess you could use low-salt soy). It's a very satisfying dish with flavor combinations I am familiar with in marinades but yet, with the vinegar, it turns out to be a very different taste experience...one that we loved! Oh...I wish I could find coconut vinegar but read other adobo recipes and used apple cider vinegar; again, delicious.

best and most authentic adobo i have made. the first time I had to use turmeric (no annatto available) and palm vinager (no coconut vinegar available) and it came out really nicely. the turmeric imparted a noticeable ginger flavor but it was subtle. The second time I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. I marinate my chicken over night and up to 24 hours and i use air chilled chicken - it sucks up all the marinade so I use only 4 LBs chicken and that seems to work fairly well giving enough gravy to fully cover the rice. I also only use thighs and legs...lots of collagen and it gives the gravy an incredible sily mouth feel. Leftovers were even better than when it was first cooked. SO GOOD!!!

My family really enjoyed this dish and we have tried many versions. We just used regular vinegar because that’s all I had. Good!

This is my second time making it. The first time I didn't have annatto powder so I subbed for sweet blend tumeric (it has lots of cinnamon in it which added a special magic to the flavor and not to mention it made it smell even better, if you can believe that) and paprika. This time around I found annatto powder and I still added  the sweet blend tumeric because I couldn't live without it. Absolutely wonderful and it was an instant hit at home. Thank you. :)

It was a great success! I substitute with  Apple cider vinegar and this gave it a great deal of flavor. Also substituted coriander and turmeric  for some of the annato.

My husband enjoyed this more than I did. The vinegar marinade was a bit to strong for me.

I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was tender but my family didn't love the flavor.
