My daughter made this as a small Christmas gift for her friends. She made it as a sand art mix by layering the ingredients in a small baby food jar (4 oz. size). She added a circle of Christmas fabric over the lid secured with a rubber band and then tied a piece of wired star garland around the top to cover the rubber band. They are very pretty and make 10 servings. (Scale recipe to 10 servings to get the perfect amount to fit in the jar.)

A wonderful idea for small Christmas gifts.  As the only large containers of instant tea I could find were sweetened, I reduced the sugar considerably (1/4 cup) and it still tastes great.

Loved  flavor but way too sugary. I will modify sugar next time with more unsweetened products. Has an orange spice flavor was was nice and fast. Had to add an extra cup of unsweetend tea and Lemon Kool Aide Packet due to high sugar taste.

This is a quick recipe that is very tasty.  I too am making up several to give as gifts in decorative mugs for the holidays.  Dry mixes are great for gift giving and I appreciate those who submit them!

This recipe has several versions... in the one I like the best, substitute the 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup of Wylers (or similar) lemonade mix. I also add a "smidge" of ground ginger and nutmeg!

My kids love this, it is a holiday favorite. It was a favorite treat from my childhood. Recipe is excellent as is, but we like it a bit spicer so I usually double the spices and add a bit of nutmeg to it. So glad this recipe was here, I had lost my copy and was kind of "winging it" to make it. It's nice to have the actual recipe on hand.

This is my favorite hot drink recipe! The perfect drink for flu season or sore throats! I now make it "almost sugar free"; I use Splenda instead of sugar (only half the amount) and double the tea for a richer flavor. My family & co-workers love it!

This is really good, but I do caution people to add sugar gradually.  Obviously the Tang already has sugar, and one of the two teas I bought was also sweetened (there was no unsweetened option for the lemon instant tea at my grocery store).  I only added about 1/2 cup sugar, and it came out the right sweetness for me.  If I would've added the full amount, it would have been WAY too sweet.  Overall, this is a great base recipe.

I used to drink this as a kid and was reminded of it reading a memoir. It smells the same; mmm. I'm letting the flavors blend as suggested before sampling. I did use 1 cup lemon instant tea since I didn't want to buy both lemon and plain instant tea.

Made for Christmas gifts.  This brings back great memories.  My Mom would make this for us in the winter to warm up.   In the summer she would make it ice cold for a refreshing drink.

I just made this recipe and enjoyed the it very much. I changed it up a little. I didn't want such a tangy taste so I 1-1/2 cups. I also did not have cloves on hand so I substituted with pumpkin pie spice and it turned out great.

My family has been drinking this beverage for generations.  I can remember drinking it as a small child at my Grandmother's house and my mother said she had been drinking it since her childhood as well.  What a wonderful tradition to continue during the cool months.  My 3 son's love it!!

I used Decaf diet Lemon-flavored instant tea.  I did 2 cups Tang, 2 cups diet instant tea, 1/4 cup sugar along with the teaspoons of cinnamon and cloves.  About 1 tablespoon of mixture to small mug of hot water.  Person can always add a tad more sugar to their cup if not sweet enough.  Tasted yummy.  Hubby likes it too.

One of my favorite (non-alcoholic) drinks. But I swear this is the exact recipe from the instant Nestea container... I haven't had any in a year though so I can't be sure.

Good on a cold day, but a little thin.

I make this in the winter and everyone loves it. It is easy and quick and so much better than hot chocolate on a cold winter night.

I remember this tea from when I was a child.We lived in the mid-west where it was always cold and there was always snow for Christmas! It was always a creative holiday gift idea. I remember making a simpler version of Russian Tea ( Just sweetened Instant Tea and Tang)as a girl scout. I am going retro this year.... so I am giving baby food jars filled with the tea mix and a recipe card for the holidays.

Just like what we used to make for Christmas gifts for our teachers as kids.  Yummy, citrus cinnamon flavor!  I added red hots to make the cinnamon more pronounced and to add color.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband found this to have a little too much tang, so we added just a small amount (1/4 cup) more of instant tea. Other than that, it was a perfect replica of what he loves to drink in the winter!

I just made this for a party as a nonalcoholic option for people. They all loved it!  I couldn’t find plain powdered tea, so I just combined everything but that and brewed plain tea to add the mix to. This is a yearly event, I think they’re going to be expecting this along with the Glogg now!

Good stuff! The only thing better is brewed with Simply Orange, lemon juice, 4-6 bags of black tea, and a stick of cinnamon. This is an inexpensive, speedy, and delicious alternative.

Good to drink when you have a winter cold or the flu.  Another thing you can do is make Instant Apple Cider and add a few spoonfuls of this mix to your apple cider.

Reminds me of when I was a child and my mother made this during the holidays. Love it. Plan on giving a jar of it away for Christmas.
