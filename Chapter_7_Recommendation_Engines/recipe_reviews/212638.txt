Gave this one a try last night, though I had to make some last-minute substitutions (my store was out of the large portobellos, so I bought a 8oz pack of baby bellas). Since I had smaller mushrooms, I cut up the entire package (each mushroom into four slices) and added them to the frying pan with the onions and tomato. I also added about a tbsp of worcestshire for flavor during the saute process. After adding the spinach and cream of celery, I added 1/4 cup whole milk to make it a little smoother in consistency (while keeping all of it in the frying pan). I put the whole oven-safe frying pan into the oven at the recommended temp until it was bubbly (10 mins), then added a layer of 1/4 cup mozzarella (was out of parmesean), and then the bread crumbs. Gave it a quick broil to brown it lightly and voila! It was very tasty, rich, and satisfying, especially eaten with some herby bread. Not the prettiest casserole, but we didn't spend much time looking at it. Next time I'll try it with the big portobellos, but this method isn't a bad option if those can't be found.

Quick & Easy. I added some sauteed garlic and black pepper. Try to cook down the tomatoes as much as possible. With the juicy tomato and condensed soup, there seemed to be too much liquid when I pulled them out of the oven. Overall a great recipe that you can spice up anyway that you want.

This was good I added 1/2 a  brick of  cream cheese to the filling mixture it  made it a little creamier.  I also cut up  the steams and sauted them with the onions rather than throwing them out. Also I used can tomatoes and frozen spinach it was  what I had on hand. I will make them again.

I'm so glad I read the reviews before cooking this because a whole can of soup would've been too runny.  I used crm of mushroom soup instead of celery and it worked out great.  I don't think this is a stand alone meal, though.  A side of potatoes or rice would work well.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious recipe, and a great meat-free weeknight meal. These were very creamy and filling, even my BF (who wasn't excited about a meatless meal) really enjoyed them.

What a surprise! I was expecting something bland and watery, given the lack of spices in the ingredients. I thought this dish was absolutely delicious. I made several substitutions because I didn't have all the ingredients: I used condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery; frozen spinach instead of fresh; olive oil instead of vegetable oil; and I cut out the bread crumbs altogether. Healthy, hearty, easy, and full of flavor!

Pretty good, definitely think a whole can of soup is too much, a half would have been a lot better and the cream of celery over powered it. cream of mushroom would be better we think. definitely will try again though!!

This was pretty easy to make and it was good! The mixture was a little watery, but I let it sit for a while and some of it evaporated.  The store didn't have whole portobellos, so I used sliced ones. I arranged them on the bottom of the pan and spread the sauce mixture over it.

First couple bites were good then I started to get overwhelmed by the salt from the soup (and I used low sodium).  Had to load up on the Frank's Red Hot to balance the salt.  Wanted to like this since portobellos are a fave.

I wanted to cut the fat so I eliminated the cream and this quick and easy dish was still awesome. To add some kick, I added salt, red pepper to the onion, tomato, spinach mix. It was good!

YUM!  I followed the proportions loosely and ended up with more filling than mushroom caps.  I scooped out a zucchini and filled that as well.  I missed the step about precooking the vegetables before stuffing, but I just left mine in longer and it worked fine.  They were so excellent!

After reading some of the reviews I decided to go with Cream of Mushroom and use only half a can.  I also used baby bellas instead of the full size.

it was ok, but seemed like it lacked something.  i might consider swapping out the cream of celery for cream of mushroom, and possibly even adding some ground turkey.
