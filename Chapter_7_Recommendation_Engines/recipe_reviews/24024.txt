The added protein is a great idea, but the protein in protein powder supplements are destroyed when cooked.

Came out perfect the first time!  I used whole wheat flour and Splenda for baking; EVERYONE loved these...even my non-healthier eating peeps!  Cook for longer than recommended if you use regular size cupcake pan...I used mini and they came out perfect at about 12 minutes!

What a waste of time and ingredients! Despite baking them for three times longer than the recipe suggested, I still ended up with something the consistency of pumpkin pie.

Doesn't work at all, I cooked each batch for over 60 minutes and all that came out was mush in a muffin pan!

I add protein to recipes by substituting cottage cheese for milk and sometimes oil. I made the Pumpkin Nut muffins (on this site) and used cottage cheese instead of buttermilk and doubled the amount of nuts. They were great and had natural sources of protein.

This recipe was WWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY out of whack. These are the modifications I made: cut the oil in half, increase the flour by a cup, and half the protein. Also, reduce the spices. With these modifications, the muffins turned out beautifully.

This recipe is great for us health nuts.  I gave it a little more health flare by using whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose white, splenda instead of sugar, and 1/4 cup egg beaters instead of 1 whole egg and 1 egg white.  I also didn't add walnuts, so they were relatively small and great for a snack.  I think next time I might use canola oil instead of vegetable oil.

These were good but flat and mushy on the inside. I left the protein powder out as we didn't have any and added an equal amount of flour. I think the reciepe may be missing Baking Powder. Not so sure I will try it again to figure out.

I had to modify this quite a bit, but the result was surprisingly good and much healthier than the original recipe. I cut out the oil COMPLETELY and did not replace it with anything. I substituted whole wheat flower, No-Salt (a salt substitute), 1/3 cup of egg beaters (instead of whole eggs), Truvia mixed with 1/4 cup of sugar and cut out the nuts entirely. It also needed more than 16 mins in the oven. Also, the recipe fails to mention that Whey protein should be used- others curdle in high heat. I prefer vanilla Xrated Complete Whey Protein Powder.

Moist flavorful, and no one will know there is very little fat. I used plain Greek yogurt ,vanilla extract, and raw sugar, as well as WW pastry flour for a little more of a clean version.

I was excited when I found this recipe because I felt it would be a healthy way for me to have something sweet.  However, I have tried to make them a couple of times but they do not rise.  They come out heavy and they aren't very good.  I don't know if I am doing something wrong but I don't think I will try to make them again.

Not worth adding the protein powder. Very gritty despite mixing thoroughly. Took an hour to bake and not the 16 allotted in the recipe. Next time Iâ€™ll omit the protein powder and add a leavening agent.

Like everyone else said their wet inside like pumpkin pie. I followed the recipe exactly but I added vanilla. I cooked them longer (43 minutes ) but the consistency stayed wet and pie like no matter how long I left them in. Good flavor but doesn't get cake like as you would expect a muffin to be. Lots of organic ingredients wasted here !

I used whole wheat flour, omitted the oil entirely and did not replace, used Splenda instead of sugar, omitted the nuts,  added 1 tsp baking powder, and used 1 cup of flour and 2.5 cups protein powder instead of the measurements given. This gave them a slightly spongier texture then I suspect they would otherwise have, but keeping it low-carb is important to me.  I baked them for 25 minutes. They rose perfectly and baked beautifully. I do not think these are incredibly delicious, but they are pleasant enough and suit my purpose (high protein, low-carb, cheap snack for work) well enough that I will probably make them again.
