Tastes like what you'd get if you ordered pad thai from an Irish pub.

Sadly, I made changes...just because I wanted it to be like what I've had at a restaurant...added chicken and shrimp, green onions and used fire sesame oil...otherwise I stuck to the recipe...absolutely loved it!

After reading all the "I made it" reviews and considering the comments that the recipe was bland I looked at a few other recipes online and made a couple alterations to the sauce and kicked it up a notch. Instead of the chile sauce I used approximately 3 tablespoons of Sriracha Sauce, 4 cloves of minced garlic, 3 tablespoons of fresh ginger, red pepper flakes (to taste) and just about a 1/2 fresh squeezed lime. As for the veggies you can use whatever you have in your fridge. Before serving  squeeze the remaining lime, stir and add 3 chopped scallions. I also did not use the cilantro and peanuts because I did not have any; and used smooth peanut butter because that is what I had on hand.

My teenage son loves Pad Thai and this recipe is so easy and good.  I add grilled chicken for that extra protein boost.  He loves it!

We added chicken and it was delicious! Very easy Pad Thai. We couldn't get bean sprouts but it was still great.

Absolutely delicious. It was a huge hit. Will definitely be making it again. Only difference I did was add chicken

My husband isn't a big fan of Pad Thai; but he loved this recipe - as did I.  Bonus is that it is quick and easy to make -- will be making this again.  Thumbs up!

We had this for dinner tonight.  My son, husband, and I all felt there was too much lime juice, so when I make it again, I will  cut back on it.  Otherwise, I thought it was.

This recipe turned out as written (I even tripled it for our big family)… BUT, no one really enjoyed it enough to make it again. Don’t let this put you off trying it - my family is notoriously picky!

It has a good flavor but pad Thai is sold in 8 Oz so I doubled everything and shouldn’t have. It was very liquidy and ended up mushy because of the time I had to cook it for the liquid to evaporate

I added a boneless skinless chicken breast that I grilled and then shredded. The lime juice was slightly overpowering and so next time I make this I will put a little less in. Great recipe and very easy to make.

I used low sodium soy sauce and a bit more red pepper flakes.   Will definitely make it again.  
I love Thai food and have tried at least a dozen sauces.  Not only does this one not require any unusual ingredients; but, it is the only one that compares favorably with my favorite restaurant.
