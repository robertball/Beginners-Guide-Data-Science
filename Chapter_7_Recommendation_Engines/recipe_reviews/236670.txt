I've been making this soup for years. It's a simple, comforting and hearty soup, one that even picky kids will usually eat. You can add baby spinach during the last minute or so of cooking to up the nutrition factor. You can also substitute basil for the parsley; even dried basil works during the winter months.

Great quick hardy soup.  I used the spinach tortellini instead of the three cheese ones and it turned out great.  It is a dish that seems like  you went to a lot of work, but it is so easy.

I loved this recipe.  The only change I did was instead of Chicken Broth I used the dripping from the roast chicken I did on Saturday.  I also added some black pepper.  This recipe is fast and easy to put together.  Will be making again.

What a fun way to use tortellini...This recipe is SO easy and delicious! Much healthier than eating soup out of the can!

My kids LOVE this soup.  Super easy.  Use chicken/prosciutto tortellini (found it at WalMart!), add frozen peas and shredded carrots for last 5 min and fresh spinach in last minute.  Topped with parm cheese and basil.  I like it myself too.  Can't beat the ease of it, and it's nutritious!! Thanks!

Brilliantly simple recipe. I LOVED this! I used homemade turkey stock for the broth and added a touch of salt, dried basil, and garlic powder in addition to the parsley until I reached a flavor I was happy with. I couldn't believe how yummy this soup was!

I am sorry, this did not work for us. I followed the recipe exactly with all of the 5 star reviews posted in August on this recipe. I used the amount of tortellini suggested and it soaked up all of the liquid! I ended up having to re-add almost a similar amount of broth back to the recipe. It really didn't have much flavor by that point. I tried the suggestions of garlic, spinach, etc. of the other reviewers and it just did not work for us. The parmesan clumped to the spinach and the tortellini was over-cooked by the time I added the extra necessary liquid. Unfortunately, most of this got tossed after making an effort to fix it. To whoever tries this recipe, I would suggest with starting with half the amount of tortellini and watch it carefully. I guess, I just like this type of pasta better in an anti-pasta type salad. It needs the extra flavorings. I tried two other Barilla recipes this week, with better results, that I will post a picture for. This was trial and error with knowing how much pasta to add per how much broth. Maybe, a tomato based broth would also be more flavorful? I am not really sure.

I've been out of town for more than two weeks and came home to a minimal pantry and located this recipe. I had 4 cheese ravioli and enough chicken stock to make this; however, since I was using full size ravioli I needed 9 cups of broth total which made 4 large servings. Easy peasy and delicious. Will be making this again.

I took the hint of the reviews about the blandness of this soup recipe and instead of using parsley, I subbed basil.  Husband LOVED it.  Very easy to make for a quick lunch or filling easy dinner.

Purely simple. Nothing fancy. I didn't measure, just used the amount of stock for us and added tortellini until it looked like the right amount for soup. Perhaps the addition of some veggies (sauteed onions, celery, carrot, spinach) would add flavor as well as eye appeal. It doesn't take long to saute veggies and it would add so much depth to this recipe. Even though it's lacking in flavor, I prefer this over a canned soup.

Ease of preparation was great.  The flavor was seriously lacking.  Soups is one of the house favorites, but this one didn't cut it.  If I were to do this again, we would definitely need some veggies like onions, carrots, spinach, leeks, celery....SOMETHING.  I had to seriously jazz this up to get the kids to eat it at all.

Sorta bland to the mister and I, but the kids absolutely loved it.  We will be making again due to their love of it and the ease of cooking it!!!  Maybe next time I'll throw in some veggies to cook in the stock for 30 or so before adding in the tortellini.

Yum!!  I used vegetarian chicken broth and added some dried parsley, minced garlic, pepper and italian seasoning while cooking and doubled the tortellini.  Definitely a keeper!

Great flavor! But measurements do not make sense. Broth must be doubled.

I have made this soup for lunch dozens of times. It is both  light tasting and filling which hits the spot on a chilly day. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
