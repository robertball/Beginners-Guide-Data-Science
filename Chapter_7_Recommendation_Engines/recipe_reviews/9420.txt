This is a great recipe but I think that people that aren't familiar with sugar cooking need to know that it is very difficult to make a recipe like this on an electric stove and they need to understand more about sugar crystalization. One sugar crystal in the pot after it is cooked will ruin the candy. I always make sure that I take a wet paper towel and wipe down the sides of the pot after the mixture comes to a boil to remove any undissolved sugar; I never put a spoon into the mixture after it comes to a boil (it might have sugar crystals on it) and I never stir or move the fudge after it is cooked (do not stir the butter and vanilla into it) until it is cooled to at least 115 degrees. Then, and only then, beat like mad until it loses it's gloss and then pour it quickly into your pan. It shouldn't take a long time to reach the desired temperature if the size of the pot is large enough and if it's heavy enough it will not burn. It takes about 10-15 minutes from beginning to end of cooking for me.

Very difficult to make properly. I butter sides of pot after sugar is poured in so it lessens the chance of crystallization. I recommend reading further (top) reviews to ensure you follows steps properly

Best fudge ever…hands down. Every time I make this, people say it's better than in the specialty fudge shops. I use Ghirardelli cocoa and I add a couple dashes of salt to cut the sweetness a bit. I never use a candy thermometer. Depending on the quality, they can be unreliable. I keep a shallow dish of ice water near the pan and test it periodically. I think a lot of people have failed results, because they aren't sure what exactly "soft ball" stage is. When you dribble the chocolate mixture in the water, it should not cloud, and will immediately form a semi-solid mass. Think of it as the consistency of a tootsie roll you've been keeping in your pocket all day. When you squeeze it, it should be soft, but you don't want it to run. Once it's reached this stage, beat the hell out of it with a wooden spoon and Voila! Gourmet fudge. It's worth the sore elbow.

Excellent recipe. At the end, I was left with a lot of very hard, crusty remains in the pot. I was going to soak it and hope for the best but then I came up with a better idea. To clean the pot, add some milk and reheat it, while swirling it around and scraping the sides. It will all come off and you will end up with the best mug of chocolate you’ve ever had. And an utterly clean pot. I recently had a $5 mug of hot chocolate a local luxury chocolatier, and it was indistinguishable from the one I made last night with all the leftovers in the pot. Why soak it with soapy water  when you can make yourself a free mug of utterly decadent hot chocolate?

I've made it twice-loved it both times! I used to watch my grandmother make fudge when I was little. I've ruined a few batches on my own.  There is nothing wrong with this recipe. You just have to be careful. Fudge can be frustrating to make. Thanks for all of your helpful tips.
1st batch came out just as I remember it. Firm, but not rock hard, and not sugary either. I was concerned, because it was snowing at the time I made it.
2nd batch: Snowing again. And this time I wanted it to be JUST a hair softer than before, so I took it off of the heat sooner. Too soon. It took forever to set. Both times I took it off of the heat and immediately added the butter, mixed it in, and then added the vanilla. The first time it didn't take too long to beat the sheen off of it. The second time it wasn't done, but I'm SO glad I didn't give up and throw it out! I got out my hand mixer and just mixed and mixed it...I'm guessing I mixed it for at least 20 minutes until it lost it's sheen! I kept going because I could tell that as it cooled it was thickening. The second time was much softer, and not as good as the first at all. But still worth the effort.
I make mine on an electric flat top stove with a thermometer and the cold water test-no stirring after it comes to a boil. 
I just wanted to list both of my experiences in case somebody was tempted to throw out your fudge if it didn't seem to be setting.

This is the same as the old world french fudge recipe that's been in my family for generations.  It does take precise timing, strong arms for the beating stage, and even a little practice.  But even the failures are delicious, testing the gooey soft-balls is fun in itself, and scraping out the pan is one of my favorite childhood memories.  This is a different world of fudge than the marshmallow creme/chocolate chip concoctions so popular now, and has a much more RICH, deep cocoa flavor.  Growing up with this fudge, I've never understood the appeal of the 'quick & easy' recipes, as fudge for us was a tradition.  I wouldn't recommend doubling the recipe in the same pan, as it's hard to beat as it is.

I've been making almost exactly this recipe for 25 years using 3 cups of sugar instead of two and 1/2 cup of butter divided. It always turns out perfectly. I always add 1/4 cup of butter to the pot in the beginning and a TBSP of corn syrup once it reaches a boil. Sifting the cocoa with the sugar blends it well and helps avoid cocoa balls. I've never bothered to let it cool after reaching the desired temp, just remove it from the heat and plop in the butter and vanilla and start stirring.
For reference, I never use the softball method, too arbitrary. Get a good candy thermometer, and if you are new to this, cook it to 240 F.. You'll have to stir it for quite a while after removing it from the heat. If you want to shorten the stirring time a little, cook it to 242 F. but wait to do this until after you've made it a few times. No higher temperature than this though, otherwise you'll be making a rock. 
When to stop stirring? A lot of recipes will tell you to pour when the shine comes off but I find that's a little late. 
For the record, the stirring is absolutely necessary. The stirring forms long crystals of sugar. The longer and more plentiful they are, the finer the grain of your fudge.
Lastly, this recipe claims to make 60 pieces...um, nope, more like 18 to 24.

This recipe was on the Herschey's cocoa can for many years and I made it back in the 50's when I was a young girl. The marshmallow, chocolate chip recipe came out in the early 60's. I like it too, but to me it's not true chocolate fudge.As others have stated, you must leave it to cool to 110 degrees before adding butter and vanilla and then beating.

This was DIVINE! Nothing like the marshmallow/chips recipes. I'm not sure if I got the texture right, but mine was slightly soft (comparing this to the marshallow/chips fudge), but melted in my mouth.

I calibrated my thermometer (way off! like 10-15 degrees), set it on low/med-low the entire time and it took approx. 20-25 or so min. to reach the softball/slightly firm ball stage (I was afraid it would be gooey). I let it cool for about 1-2 minutes, then stirred in vanilla/butter (cut into cubes). Beat it mercilessly until it lost its sheen (3-5 minutes...), then threw in walnuts and beat it a little more. Turned out excellent.. hope this helps some first-time real fudge makers like me! Thanks!! ***Forgot to add that it's a good idea to double the recipe or use a smaller dish, if you'd like your fudge to turn out like the picture.***

This was my first attempt at making traditional fudge.  I used salted butter and it tasted fine.  I followed the recipe as is.  I was surprized when it took me about an hour to get the fudge to 114 degrees c.  This made me a bit nervous.  I also had to adjust the flame a few times to keep it from a rolling boil and each time the fudge lost volume as it heated. This made me so nervous I had to get a glass of wine and pull up a chair to get comfortable as I waited. Finally, it reached 114.  It cooled a bit and I added the remaining ingredients and some walnut pieces.  After a good 10 minutes of stirring,it
lost its sheen. I used a warm knife to cut the pieces when it cooled completely.
It was like "bud'da".  Smooth & creamy.
Um um good! I'd make this again but I'd add a bottle of wine to the recipe  :)

This is that old recipe I've been looking for!  From start to finish (ie eating it), it took an hour and a half.  Be patient, and note that the times aren't given in the recipe.  Expect to spend about 10 minutes getting to a boil while stirring, about 20-30 minutes of simmering to get to 238 degrees, another 20 minutes to cool down, and another 5-10 minutes of stirring.  It didn't lose a lot of sheen, but it got so thick and I just got so tired of stirring that I poured it in the pan.  It set immediately.  I think the times will differ for everyone depending on several variables ie the stove temp, the weather, etc.  Just be patient.  It's worth it to have REAL fudge again.  I think even vendors that pride themselves on "homemade" fudge are using the marshmallow/chip recipe.  It is so nice to go back to basics.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Excellent.  Be sure to add that the fudge should cool to 110 degrees before beating.

I too used to make fudge with thus recipe in the 50s. It used to be on the Hershey's Cocoa Tin but I couldn't even find it on the Hreshey site. I have been looking quite a while for this exact recipe. Like others, making fudge with choc. chips & marshmellows just dosen't cut it. Thanks!!!!

This is the fudge I grew up with and have always made. My family loves it with raisins instead of nuts (we have several nut allergy's in the family). You have to really watch the temp when you make it and make sure that all the sugar is melted BEFORE it hits the boiling point. If your fudge turns out sugary or over cooked, you can "fix" it by putting it back in the pot with more cream and melting it down and re-cooking it. Just remember all sugar melted before you hit the boiling point.   2nd problem many people have is not beating it long enough or starting to beat it before it's cooled down.  The recipe says to start beating right away. Don't do it. Wait until the fudge cools to around 160. My mom always said to wait until you could touch the bottom of the pan and keep your hand there.

I DID IT!!!!!! This was possibly the most effort I have ever put into any food. My arms feel like noodles but I did it! During the stirring like mad process I ended up sitting on the floor with the pot between my legs cursing every man in the olden days who thought women were useless. LOL it was a lot of work but it is an amazing recipe and completely rewarding :) TRY IT

This fudge is delicious and not too difficult to make.  The instructions are, however, a bit misleading.  Step 2 tells you to "reduce heat and simmer."  This will not work.  You can't reach the temperature of 238 degrees while simmereing.  I went online after 20 minutes without a temperature change and found others calling for a "boil" during the heating process.  Once I upped the heat, I had the temperature in 10 additional minutes.  You should not need to cook the fudge longere than 15 minutes to get it to 238.

Would be nice, too, if there was a bit more description on what "loses its sheen" means.  Mine barely changed at all after 20 minutes of beating the daylights out of it and I poured it onto the pan.  Set up fine and turned out perfect.

There should also be an instruction not to start the beating until the temperature of the fudge drops to about 115 degerees F.

This is the best fudge I have ever had! This was the first time I have ever made fudge (not counting microwave, chocolate chip, sweetened condensed milk kind).  I followed the advice from other reviewers, other internet sources, and one of my mom's old cook books.  I buttered my pan first, added some salt and instant coffee powder in the beginning, only string it until it reached a boil over low heat, put in a candy thermometer and waited until it got up to 236 degrees F (it took a while), turned off the heat, cut up and left the butter to melt on top until it cooled to 110 degrees F without disturbing it, added the vanilla and stirred it until it became really thick (it took 5-10 minutes and gave me a blister on my hand), and pushed it into a buttered 8x8 inch pan.

It came out great, and very smooth and creamy.  It was thunder storming while I made it so it was probably pretty humid but that didn't seam to cause a problem.  I cut it into 64 squares (1 inch cubes) with no problem.  Will definitely make this again especially since I can with very basic ingredients.

this is the same recipe my mom used to make (I am 55) hands down the best fudge recipe . cooking with sugar is tough . a couple hints , once you have mixed the cocoa, sugar and milk thoroughly set the timer on your stove to 22 min, set the temp on the dial to about 8.5 out of ten , stir constantly. Once it boils set the temp down to 4. I lift the pot just off the burner for about 2 min to let the heat relax a bit . then set it down, leave it be do not touch it or stir it. start testing for the soft ball stage when there is about 2 min left on the  timer. Have a clear glass of cold water , use a clean spoon dip it in a let 1 drop of liquid fudge drip in , when it hits the bottom of the glass it should be a firm little ball with a tail. if it lands and splashed down flat it is too early. by about 1 minute.
if you reach in and grab the little ball from the glass it should squeeze flat very easily but stay together , that is the soft ball state.Remove from the heat and drop in the butter and vanilla, beat constantly for about 10 minutes , until it is getting dull, really what is happening is it is cooling at the same time , once it is dull it should still be liquid enough to pour into the pan like a thick pancake batter. Let it cool on a counter before you refrigerate it . Hope that provides some of the instruction that is always missing from recipes.

It only took me 7 tries to get success here.  I've learned a lot.  First, make sure your pan is deep enough so it doesn't boil over (try 1).  Second, calibrate your thermometer in boiling water (tries 2 and 3, I bought a new one when I realized the old one's tube freely moved along the measurements).  Third, check for soft ball, as mine goes at 234F.  And finally, let it cool until 110F before beating the sheen off.  My successful 7th try also included a pinch of cream of tartar (to turn some sugar into glucose and keep it from turning into a rock) and 1/4t of salt, based on other fudge information out there.  But I think leaving it to 110F to beat made the difference.  Good luck!

Wonderful recipe, I love that it can be made with just a few ingredients that even a beginner usually has. 

Just need to re-emphasis a few things. 
Combine the sugar, coco and milk before heating the mixture. This not only saves time and vigilance watching the mixture boil but brakes down the sugar crystals (to an extent) before they can threaten to transform into chocolate toffee but also makes the initial stirring easier and less necessary. 

Using this method the second time I attempted this recipe the fudge almost boiled out of the pot, and would have if not for quick reflexes and a bigger pot handy. Now I use the rising process to indicate when to turn down the heat. 

Testing the consistency without a thermometer can be tricky but an easier way to gain a visual indication is to drip a bit in a glass/bowl of water and rather than testing its buoyancy, if it does not go cloudy it is usually fine, however I wait until the drop floats for the best consistency. 

To re-emphasis what other members have stated, wait until the pot cools before adding the butter and vanilla. Again not using a thermometer, a good indication is when you can touch the pot without immediately removing your hand. 

Quick work is needed for the final mixing and poring ready to set. There is no real difference with brown or white sugar. The result is defiantly worth the sore hand. 

1.So again, Mix before heating. 
2.If its cloudy, its not ready.
3.Let it cool before adding the final ingredients.

Wonderful, tastes just like my mom used to make.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  Perfect as is.

I used to make this every St. Nicholas day ( on an electric stove) for my kids stockings, sometimes late at night before Saint Nicholas arrived. It can be a kind of a fussy thing to make but if you get used to its trouble spots, it is fun and easy.   Here is what I know about this recipe: 
1. You must run a sink with cold water.Turn the faucet away from that sink when you are finished. Then lightly butter the pan or marble where you will be putting it
2. Go ahead and mix all the ingredients at once, I have never put the butter and vanilla in last, I was always afraid to, because once I let a drop of water in it as I was beating it. It wouldn't set, it turned into just chocolate syrup.
3. Bring it to a rolling boil stirring all the time so that you don't burn the chocolate (a very bad flavor.) I usually stir it with a small whisk. Keep every bit moving (like making kettle corn.) Once it is boiling, check the time. Boil for 5 minutes.
4. after 5 minutes take from the heat, begin by stirring it away from the heat for a bit then slowly lower it into the water, keep stirring, you should eventually feel it thicken a bit on the bottom of the pan, then lift it out of the water and let the temperature equalize throughout. Keep stirring, and watch the sheen on the surface, if it starts to show signs of pulling or loses it's gloss it is time to pour. If not repeat the water step. There is a tiny window where you should pour it out. Once you have done it a few times you'll know it. :-)

This is the best fudge I have ever had!  I'm a first time fudge maker, I followed the instructions, and it came out perfectly.  I was afraid that I hadn't beaten it long enough but after about 30 seconds of "have I beaten it long enough?  Is it losing its sheen?  I think it's losing its sheen..."  I just decided to go for it.  I had stirred for 12 minutes.  After I poured it into the prepared pan, it set up to an amazing velvety soft fudge in about 15 minutes.  I should also note that I used almond milk and vegan margarine because my son is allergic to cow's milk protein, and I didn't expect it to turn out at all, I'm amazed that it did!

Fudge is a little tricky, even for those of use who make it often. I was expecting this to turn out under-or over-cooked. I had to transfer the mix from a medium sauce pan to a large skillet when it started to boil over, and it still turned out amazing. It was creamy, and had a deep chocolate flavor, much better than the "fake" fudge made with marshmallow fluff. 

I did not simmer the mixture, either. I let it boil on medium-high heat until it reached 234 degrees. I did notice that when I tried to let it cool to 110 degrees like other reviewers suggested, it was almost too hard to stir because it had already started to harden. My advice: trust your own judgment for when you should add the last ingredients.

This recipe appears easy, but even with a thermometer I still screwed it up. It's not just the temperature you need to watch for, but the cooking time. I was so focused  on reaching the correct temp that I did not cook it long enough. End result: the fudge never set up! But here is a yummy saving suggestion: stir in confectioner's sugar and use as fudge frosting for the Chocoate-Zucchini cupcakes! A better end result on what could've been a total waste of quality ingredients. Lesson: So next time you screw up, invent a new recipe.

Great basic old-fashioned fudge recipe! An accurate candy thermometer makes all the difference with finicky fudge. Once you've reached the initial boil, I would suggest simmering to softball stage on no higher than medium-low heat to prevent scorching.  Stirring after the initial boil can cause the sugar to crystalize, which will give you a gritty-textured end product.

This is the old fashioned fudge that your grandmother used to make.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was printed, and it was perfect.  The key to perfection is the candy thermometer and beating it until the gloss is gone.  (You can also let it cool for about 5 minutes before beating, and you won't have to beat it as long.)

I followed the recipe almost exactly as written, and without a candy thermometer. I only fudged it a bit when I used my hand held electric mixer. (hehe see what I did there?)

In total it took about 45 minutes from start to finish. This is possibly the best fudge ever! Easy to do, but you'll doubt yourself the whole way through the first time as I did.

I used the cold water technique with 2 ice cubes, although I never got a pliable ball; I decided to remove from the heat one a dribble sort of hung at the top of the water for a millisecond before falling to the bottom. 

Once it was off the heat, I let it sit for about 2 minutes and then I beat it on low using the electric mixer for a total of 5 minutes or so. I probably actually over-beat it a slight bit, as it didn't really want to come out of the pan as it was already starting to set! 

Next time I'll double the recipe to make thicker brownies as it only really makes about 16 medium sized thin pieces once sliced.

This is exactly the type of fudge my dad was wanting me to make. Very simple and turned out wonderfully =) Just a note to some, especially those who don't have much experience making fudge...fudge making requires patience. It WILL reach the correct temp on simmer. So just be patient and if for some reason it does not turn out the first time (or even the second or third), try again. Eventually you will get the hang of it.

DElicious.  However, my sister said she would only give this 4 stars because it takes FOREVER to make.  20 minutes to reach a boil (we used med-low heat so the chocolate wouldn't burn), 20 minutes on low heat while simmering to reach "soft ball," at least 20 minutes to cool and another 15 minutes (felt like 4 hours) to stir until sheen was gone.  Seriously, this takes FOREVER to make, but if you are not in too much pain afterwards, the result is wonderful!  Also keep in mind that it takes awhile to set in the pan.  We made the recipe twice because it doesn't yeild very much if you want thick fudge.  The second time around we ran out of milk and used 3/4 c. milk and 1/4 c. heavy whipping cream and that worked too, maybe even better!!

I buy my fudge at a local farmer's market because it's the same fudge I remember eating as a kid. I decided to try and make my own with this recipe and I'm glad I did! Turned out perfectly! The flavor is to die for and the texture is wonderful. Nice and firm and a little crumbly. DO NOT overcook this or you'll end up with a thick, difficult to work with mass that still tastes great but isn't very presentable. That was my first try but we ate it anyway.Took a long time to reach the desired temp, but that's to be expected. Thank you Kim C.! Creamy fudge and no cook fudge just isn't real fudge. I guess quite a few people sacrifice taste for convenience. Too bad, they're definitely missing out on a treat!

If you're like me, never made fudge or any kind of candy, save yourself a couple of failed batches and go to the 'how to make fudge' section in this site. Youtube also has some how-to-make fudge demos where you can actually see what softball stage looks like, what the fudge should look like when you stir it, etc. Good luck.

Great recipie this was my first time making fudge but i am fairly skilled at caramel.  There were a few reviews that said you can't make it with an electric stove top but i did.  To help defuse the heat i used a cast iron skillet underneath my pot and it work great.  To make sure there were no sugar crystals on the side of the pot i mixed the sugar, coco, and milk in a seperate bowl as best i could then carefully put the mixture in the pot.  It turned out great, 5 stars.

My arm is really tired, but this is delicious. Smooth and soft but firm enough to hold its shape, this is some real fudge. It was easy too, I got it on the first try with the advice of other reviewers (the soft ball test, don't stir in the butter until it cools to 110-115 degrees). I had to "simmer" it at a pretty high temperature to reach 138 degrees though, not much under what I boiled it at, and then I stirred the hell out of it. I added a couple dashes of salt before boiling (will use a little more next time actually), and I was out of vanilla so I added some double strength coffee like another fudge recipe on here. So good, I will be definitely make this again and maybe experiment with additions. Thanks!

Awesome recipe.  Just like my Mom and Grandma made.  Was my very first time making fudge (or any candy for that matter).  Followed the directions to the letter, and it came out perfect.  Read several of the reviews here...which really helped me to 'take my time'.  Once the mixture starts boiling, it slowly rises in temperature as the liquid boils off, about 1 degree/minute.  When my digital thermometer hit 238, I turned off the flame, and started stirring again.  Poured it into a buttered 8x8 dish and 30 minutes on a cooling rack, it's as good as Grandma's house on Christmas eve.  I may try some pecans in it next time. Thanks for sharing!

This fudge has the most awesome taste!  I also love that the ingredients are so simple.  No nasty marshmallow cream, blech!  Thanks to other reviewers I had success.  I didn't have a candy thermometer so I followed a couple suggestions.  I was worried about the sugar crystalization thing I read about, so I was very careful at when I mixed it all up that there was on sugar residual on the sides of the pan.  Once it began to boil I kept it at a hard boil for 4 minutes and then did the cold water test.  It wasn't ready so I let it boil for another couple minutes.  I did the cold water test again and the fudge did stay together in a little lump.  I let it cool down for about 10 minutes or so, until it didn't burn my finger anymore.  No one was kidding about beating 'til an arm falls off.  I'd say I beat that stuff for 15 minutes.  It felt like forever!  I was worried about it not setting due to the fact that it was raining (it's always raining in the winter in Western Washington!).  I put it in the fridge.  It did not set completely, but it was so delicious that no one cared that it was a little soft.  On the next dry day I'm going to try it again and see if it sets.
Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Horrible explanation of the recipe. The reviews give more direction than this. Read reviews before trying to make this because it says nothing about the amount of time you should stir or how long to keep it simmering. Mine turned out completely runny and never set up due to not knowing the length of time to stir. that makes a HUGE difference.

This recipe is delicious! It turned out great the first time I made it. It doesn't yield a whole lot though (the only reason I'd give it 4 stars). I tried to make a double batch two times since my single batch and couldn't get them to turn out. The fudge in the double batches got thick, but never completely hardened like my first batch. If the fudge isn't hardening, did I not let it cook long enough, or did I not stir long enough? I'm also wondering if it would help if the butter or milk was reduced in the double batch. I saw in another recipe that 4 cups sugar was used to 6 tbsp butter (instead of 8 tbsp this recipe would require for a double batch).

This turned out really really yummy. This was my first time making fudge and I have an electric stove so I was worried.  When it got to the soft boil stage it looked like this photo and I took a picture because if it turned out I wanted to remember that this is how it's supposed to look. I thought I'd share for other worriers. If it looks like this, you're doing it right ;-). Try it,  it wasn't that hard (except for the beating until it loses its shine party,  my arm aches) and it's so good.  My husband says it's better than his grandpa's and that's the highest praise possible! Thanks!

Let me start with this: I have never made candy before, I own an electric stove, I don't own a wooden spoon or a candy thermometer,so this adventure was doomed from the start!  I had shoulder surgery about 6 weeks ago so I knew I would not be able to beat the mixture. Here is what I did. I used the heaviest pot I have and used cold water with a few ice cubes in it to make it super cold. I cooked the mixture until I thought I got a soft ball. Took it off the heat and added the butter and vanilla. Then I let it sit until it was somewhat cooler. Since I could not beat the dickens out of it by hand, I used my electric mixer on low until I was sure the sheen was gone. The results: the mixture set before I could get it in the pan. I scooped it out and pressed it in the pan. The mistake I think I made was beating it too long and/or cooking it too long. The fudge tastes absolutely delicious! I will make this again and alter how long I beat the mixture. Oh and I made delicious hot cocoa with the remains from the cooking pan as suggested by another reviewer!

I've only made marshmallow fudge in the past but with all the chocolate chips, it gets pretty expensive. This is a nice and inexpensive alternative and it's fantastic.

I followed lots of the reviews and it turned out perfectly. I mixed everything together and whisked it because my cocoa was pretty chunky - it might be a good idea to sift the cocoa if yours is lumpy but otherwise you can just whisk it in. I whisked it on medium heat for about five minutes and then it started the boil. When it was boiling, it got very bubbly and doubled in volume. This is when I stopped stirring and lowered to low heat. I didn't have a candy thermometer so I used my meat thermometer and after around 20 minutes, it was at the appropriate temperature. I took it off the heat and added the butter and vanilla right away (didn't leave time to cool as some people suggested, I forgot) and started stirring. After five minutes of stirring, it was still a bit shiny but was starting to stiffen and pull a bit in it's texture, so I scraped it into my pan. It set really fast in the fridge - about an hour - and it's the prefect softness. I put it in a banana bread loaf pan and it is a good thickness - I think it would be too thin if you use the larger pan.

Great recipe! And totally do-able for someone who has never done fudge like this before.

This recipe came out as a frosting. It never did set up, it remained liquid. I followed the instructions word for word, but this came out a frosting instead of fudge.

This is wonderful!! This is only the second time I've tried to make "real" fudge (with out choc. chips)  This first time turned into a rock collection.  It's been a few years since then.  I decided to try again.  I read a lot of the reviews and tips on how to make fudge.  I don't have a candy thermometer so I used the glass of water method.  I ended up cooking it for twenty five minutes total. I checked it ever five because I wasn't sure how long it would take to make it there.  I do have a gas range so that helps with the reducing to simmer.  I let it sit for 10 minutes after it reached the soft boil stage to cool off some.  Then I added the vanilla and butter.  I stirred it for 30 minutes until I thought it was losing it's sheen.  It set up pretty nice maybe just a tad soft but not to soft to pick up.  NO crystalizing and wonderfully smooth!!  My 14 month old son keeps begging for more tastes!  Imagine that! :)  Thanks this is wonderful.  I will make for Christmas and New Years!!
Tip:  use a wet pastry brush around the edges of the sauce pan to make sure no sugar crystals get in.  This is much easier than a paper towel.

Okay I don't know if my scoreing is the nicest, but I had troubles with this recipe. I had it simmering for a LONG LONG LONG time and it never got to the softball stage... I began to think that maybe my thermometer was broken so I tested with the cool water.... and it never formed into balls. Finaly I just said forget it and added the vinilla and butter and followed the rest of the directions and it still came out okay... but was kinda hard to get out of the dish... I followed all the drections and just got stuck on that one part... it just never worked for me. the taste was still really good. i didn't have a problem with mine burning... even after it sat on simmer for like 20 mins... it didn't even burn after i turned it up and let it sit longer hopeing for it to get to the softball stage. But yeah.. only problem for me was temp problems.

Just like Mom's DON'T FORGET TO BUTTER THE PAN FIRST TO SAVE ON YOUR POT!!!!  This is exactly what I have been trying to perfect and it wasl ALWAYS runny.  You DO have to beat for quite a while to get to the "non-glossy" stage.  I added peanut butter and oats.  PERFECT!!   Thanks

THANK YOU!  This was the fudge my grandmother always made and I couldn't find her recipe.  She has been gone for 3 years and thats how long I have been deprived of this wonderful fudge.  She always made it in her cast iron skillet.  The ppl that had problems with it setting up,  if its humid in your house, or raining outside, your fudge will fail.

My Mom has been making it for 50 years, and as far as I'm concerned, no other fudge comes close. Our freezer is full of Christmas cookies right now, and I have no problem resisting any of them. But I'm afraid my Mom is gonna kill me when she finds out her fudge is almost gone...:)

Just like my grandmother used to make. So velvety smooth, and what fudge should taste like.  Nothing like the quick marshmallow fluff stuff that most people today try to pass off as fudge.  People, real old fashioned fudge does take time, and yes…it does take a bit of actual physical labor. This is not a “pop it in the microwave and it’s done” type of candy, so don’t even bother (and please don't rate it) if you won’t take the time or won’t follow the directions, because chances are you will end up with a grainy brick. In saying that, this recipe is simple enough that even first time fudge makers can make it turn out perfect…if they just take their time, and they follow the directions. This is 5 stars all the way!

My mom made this in the 50s with no measurements!  To cool, she put in a sink of cold water and beat.  No waiting for the temperatue to drop.  Always perfect, except on a rainy day! Mom's gone now, and now have the exact measurements; she "felt" the right amounts. The charm and magic of our farm mothers.

My ex husband mastered this fudge and didn't use a candy therometer.  His mom started making this fudge years ago.  I could never get it to turn out smooth and creamy.  I finally bought a candy therometer, made it and it turned out AMAZING!  Love it with nuts! HANDS DOWN this IS the best fudge EVER!  And I can now make it myself.  (If I could give it 10 stars I would!  It takes work, but it is well worth the effort of stirring!

I started making fudge when I was 12 years old. I am now 58. This is the recipe I used back in '64 and continue using today. Sometimes I use nuts the more the better for me. However, this recipe is just as good without nuts. I never use a thermometer although thats a good idea. I use the *test for soft ball* way to to know the fudge has cooked long enough.

I am so excited that I cannot fail with these everytime I make them. I have even used Hearshey's Dark Baking Cocoa, for us dark chocolate fans! For other New fudge makers or those without a thermometer, do this recipe exact and for me, boiling time is about 15 minutes! A little less for those who like them more chewy and a little more for those who like it more done with a snap to each bite. You decide and enjoy!

WOW! I made this yesterday with my seven year old son and I must admit I was convinced it wouldn't come out right. I am happy to say I was wrong! It came out great. I read through many helpful reviews before I started, and I think that is why it worked. Be sure NOT to stir or move after it comes to a boil and while it is cooling, very important. I added 2 tsps of cold coffee along with the butter and vanilla (because coffee enhances the flavor of chocolate) and the taste was awesome. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have never made fudge before and followed this recipe EXACTLY as described.  I did think it was taking a long time to reach the correct temp, and was afraid it would burn, however it did not burn.  I made a double batch and served it to people who look forward to and enjoy Grandma's Fudge every Christmas.  They said it tasted just like Grandma' Fudge.  It was EXCELLENT!!!!!

Does anyone know approximately how long to beat the fudge for? Because mine just doesn't seem to be setting! and also is beating with an electric beater an option or does it have to be by hand?

This fudge turned out amazingly!  As always, I had a heart attack waiting for it to come to temp, took about 25 mins, but my candy thermometer is an old friend, and trusting it got the fudge perfect.  Once it hit soft-ball stage, I dropped the butter in pieces, and let it sit until melted, the stirred it for about 10 mins,  it was still a bit glossy, but was firming up well.  Put it in a pan lined with parchment paper (so it can be lifted right out of the pan, and cut easily), turned out great.  Kudo's to the reviewer who suggested making hot chocolate with the mixture that stuck to the pan, that was also delicious.

Not bad!

I found the ratio of sugar to cocoa to be a tad too sweet, so I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Doubling almost everything (1 cup cocoa, 2 cups milk, 3 cups sugar, but 5 tbsp. butter) makes a nice thick batch in an 8x8 pan. Warning: This modification is only for those who take their chocolate seriously!

Like some others, it took me a few tries to get this right. My fudge kept overcooking, so I did the soft ball test in conjunction with a candy thermometer, and found that mine is usually done at around 232 degrees (I'm 750 feet above sea level). I also learned that it's important to use a good quality pot - otherwise, it heats unevenly and parts get burned to the bottom. 

Overall, this is a delicious recipe - much better than the stuff at the grocery store! Super cheap, too!

Fantastic recipe. It was my first time making fudge ever and it turned out 100x better than expected. I made it exactly as the recipe said with perfect results.

Will definitely make this again, might toss in mint extract or chopped walnuts next time for a bit of variety.

5 stars for the experience! I just became a member so i could rate this recipe and its reviews!  thanks so much for all the hints!  i am an amateur fudge maker and amazingly it came out!  phew - that was the most chaotic 20 minutes of my life!  in a mixing bowl i premixed the first 3 ingredients with the addition of one instant coffee packet which in hindsight is too overpowering and i tried to compensate with 2 more rounded TBL of cocoa. i had everything ready before i began including the buttered pot and baking pan.  once the mixture came to a boil over medium on my gas range in 2 minutes of heating i lost all order and continued with the soft ball testing 30 seconds or so.  after 9 failed tests i took a fresh spoon and tasted the texture which instantly reminded me of the "velvety smooth" texture i had read in reviews.  i took a moment to ponder whether it was done and decided to take it off the heat.  after a minute or so i added the cut up butter and vanilla.  stirring once it had cooled to the mid 100s took about 7 minutes.  it was very evident the fudge was starting to thicken about half way through.  from what i can tell it is smooth and yummy!  fyi i used 2% milk and it was a rainy day.  the fudge is perhaps slightly too sweet and i may adjust that next time but first i will let the taste-testers try it.  i will definitely make this again!  thanks for the recipe!

I made this and got impatient and poured it into the pan before it had totally reached soft ball stage and it didn't set. After much debate I put it all back in the saucepan the next day and reboiled it and this time didn't cut corners and it actually worked and set correctly the second time around. I made it for my grandparents and boyfriend and they raved it was the best fudge they have ever eaten.

I like that just a few things I had at home could make fudge that being said this recipe was short of some needed information.  First of all the soft ball stage took some time, the hand beating also to loose the sheen also took a long time it would have been nice to say aprox how long each step would take eg.. five to ten min to soft ball stage etc.. or till hell freezes over what ever just to give an idea of how long is needed to make the fudge.  After all is said and done the fudge came out nice, chocolaty, smooth wish it was a little more firm but the kids are enjoying eating it from the fridge ah gotta luv teanagers.  This recipe is worth a try if you have nothing better to do for an aprox an hour.

Fantastic!!!! I have just made this for the first time and boy it was very simple. I am so p[leased I gave it a go!! I will be making some more very soon... Although I would add the 8"x8" tin is a little too large for the amount and I will be making it in a slightly smaller tin next time as the fudge is too thin.. and could only make 36 decent size pieces. I let the mix heat a little more than 114 degrees too then after beating in the butter and extract I plunged my pan into a bath of cold water to speed the process up and used an electric mixer to help me out as I don't have that much energy! Finished off with a bit of beating with spoon when it got too stiff for the mixer then poured into the pre greased tin. Voilà really simple!!! I also poured a mug of milk into the pan like someone else suggested and heated it up and now I have a lovely mug of hot chocolate. Brilliant can't rate this enough!!! And I don't even like chocolate!!!!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! It does take a bit of practice and a really good thermometer. Fudge is so difficult to make if you aren't sure what you're doing. My advice is buy a lot of sugar and practice. When you get it down it will be so worth it. This recipe is an excellent way to start. Set aside some time, be patient and follow the directions exactly. It is so worth it!

Delicious! I've made cooked fudge over 50 years using a very similar recipe. I added black walnuts and blawck walnut flavoring to give it that extra zing!  If you want to cool off the fudge quicker when it's removed from the stove, set the pan in an inch or so of cold water in the sink to beat it.(Don't get any in the fudge). Just pour it soon as it starts to loose the glossy look because it will set up fast.

A big thank-you to SAILSELAN to remind us not to beat the fudge untils it cools to 115º. It's been ages since I made fudge and had forgotten about cooling it before beating. This step will save your arm, I only beat the fudge for not quite 3 mins. This fudge is sooo creamy, melt- in-your-mouth, GOOD.

This was my first time making fudge. My Mom used to make this recipe many years ago, but we lost her a few years ago and we never knew her recipe. My Dad was reminiscing about her wonderful fudge and I was determined to find out the recipe, and I am thankful to have found it on this wonderful site. When my Dad tasted it for the first time, tears welled up in his eyes and nearly made us all cry out loud. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I can count on one had the number of times I've made 'real' fudge...but this time I was in the mood for 'real', so I did it. Followed the recipe EXACTLY (which means I used a thermometer) didn't stir after boil, let it cool (took a good half hour to cool enough to add butter and vanilla). When I started to beat it (thank heavens for mixers) it took no more than 5 minutes to lose gloss and stiffen up. I almost didn't get the nuts (oh, guess I did change the recipe, sorry) stirred in. No sugar crystals. Just smoooooth chocolate goodness.

This recipe did not turn out well at all.  I followed the advice of others and let it cool down before adding the butter and vanilla.  BIG mistake.  I could barely mix it. It just tasted like chocolate, not like fudge.  And within 10 minutes of pouring it into a pan it became so hard that I could use it as a weapon.  I think I'll try a different fudge recipe next time.

I am thankful I found this recipe. I have been looking for a simple and tasty fudge made with cocoa. It took about 30 min. for it to reach soft ball stage (I don't have a candy therm. and I couldn't wait until I had one to make this). I used too small a pan and it boiled over, but other than that it went smoothly. The hardest part was beating it until the shine was gone. I thought my arms were going to fall off but it is good that I burned some calories considering how much of this fudge I am going to eat.

*Update*  I've made this about 4 X since the first attempt and followed the instructions of waiting until it hits the right temp and cooling down b4 beating. IT IS INCREDIBLE. the flavour and texture are out of this world! Be patient! it is soooooo worth it!*
I just finished making this and I don't think it's going to set...it's more like a ganache at this point....BUT, it's my fault if it doesn't harden b/c I became very impatient towards the end.  I have an older stove so the temp wasn't consistent ...it would simmer , then almost stop so it took a very long time for it to reach 238 F.  Also, I only let it cool to about 140 b/c I couldn't wait any longer as I was sampling it along the way.  THe taste & texture is DEVINE!!!!! Even if mine doesn't completely harden, without question, it will be eaten (probably by the end of the day).  My advice is to follow the tips from the other reviews & WAIT until it cools to 115 or 110 ( or whatever they said) before beating.  Also, don't wear heavy clothing...I broke out in a sweat while beating it and had to take off my hoodie!  All that aside, this fudge is smooth and chocolatey and is exactly what i was looking for.  I will definitely make it again & next time exercise more patience....

Wow. I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out perfect - even on an electric hob without a candy thermometer. Thanks to those other reviewers who gave tips about fudge-making.  - couldn't have done it without you!
Perfect consistency fudge, creamy delicious flavour and texture. 
The only reason I've not given this recipe 5 stars is because there is more detail required in the recipe, mainly with regard to the sugar crystals, timings and temperatures.
Many thanks though - this should give my fiance enough energy as quick snacks throughout his triathlon this weekend!

This recipe is amazing! I made a mistake and only brought it up to 220 degrees the first time I made it, and it came out like fudge sauce. Which is great for ice cream, but for this fudge make sure you get the temps right. And make sure you let it get down to 115 before beating at the end. My second attempt turned out the perfect old fashioned fudge. Much better than the mushy new type of fudge. Thanks for the great recipe.

I have never been able to make fudge, but I made this (without a candy thermometer) and it tastes just like Grandma's.  I did have to stir it after it boiled or it would've boiled over, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Not too bad.  You have to "simmer" for a long time to get soft ball stage.  I simmered (mostly very slow boiled) it on Medium and stirred occasionally.  If you don't stir, it will burn.  It took about an hour to get it to soft ball.  Let it cool a few minutes before putting in the vanilla.  It's too hot for it.  It will lose it's sheen in about 10 minutes.  Other than that it turned out great.

I have been making candy for years and use a professional thermometer. I found this recipe a complete failure. Not stirring the chocolate caused it to burn. Try stirring and a higher flame so that you get to the soft ball stage quicker. Then you will get excellent results

the end product if fine. The fudge tastes great.  However, the recipe itself is terrible.  If you are a first time fudge maker, like I was, it will be helpful to know that the mixture you bring to a boil and then simmer EXPANDS a great deal.  I used a large pot that wasn't even halfway full and the mixture boiled over and made a crazy mess.

This is the recipe my Grandfather made, passed it down to my Mom who taught me.  You have to make sure it gets to the "soft ball" stage otherwise it does become sugary (238F).  When you beat it by hand with a wooden spoon, put the pot in cold water in the sink, this helps to cool it down and as it starts to harden on the sides, it is ready to put into the pan. It should set immediately. Then pour milk into the pot so as not to waste any chocolate and have a wonderful mug of hot chocolate with a piece of fudge!

I just want to mention that although you shouldn't underbeat, you can definitely overbeat this fudge.  Some recipes say to beat for 15-20 minutes...NO.  This will result is waaay too crumbly fudge.  This is a crumbly fudge to begin with, since it's a candy, but if you beat it for too long, it will crack and crumble when cutting through it.  I only beat for about 4 minutes (until the butter is nicely incorporated), and have never had a problem.

This is the recipe I grew up on. It was always a special treat when my mom would make this and we waited around the kitchen to taste the "tester ball". I am shocked I came across this. I see all the comments about it being hard and crystallization of the sugar. I was making this recipe before I could cook. A candy thermometer is a must, unless you are a pro like mom or sister. I have found rainy days or high humidity will mess it up. I'm sure there is a scscientific reason for this. But it is so worth the trouble. In fact my kids beg for this stuff. It is great with walnuts added.

First time trying this recipe and it didn't go well.  I'm experienced with making candy and understand the various techniques. etc.  I used my candy thermometer and a pan of water to test for soft ball stage beginning when my thermometer hit 230F.  I followed the recommendation I saw from several people & let it cool to 115F before stirring even though I thought this temp was a bit on the low side.  Added my butter & vanilla and ended up with a bunch of chocolate rocks and dust.  I tried a bite of one of the rocks and the flavor was excellent, so I know this is a good recipe.  I will try again but will listen to my gut as far as how long to cool before adding the butter & vanilla and start stirring.  IMO, 115F is way too low.  Will post another review after my next attempt.

I'm really a novice at candy making. Just bought myself a candy thermometer. But I have my masters in biochem. That said, I followed the recipe to the letter and treated it like the chemical rxn it really is. And it turned out perfectly! Used exact quantities of ingredients on an electric stove on a rainy NY day. While bringing to a boil I used a wet pastry brush to rinse down sugar crystals from the sides of my calphalon 2.5 quart stainless. Also rinsed my wooden spoon off for same reason once sugar became more or less dissolved. Once it came to a boil I inserted thermometer and turned heat down to simmer and did not touch until proper temp was reached. Turned out fantastic. Ask my toddler, she stole three squares before I caught on to her lol!

This is the kind of fudge we used to make as kids. Excellent. I remembered well how it took great patience and time to create creamy, sweet (but not sickenly,sweet like the condensed milk kind of recipes)fudge. Follow the recipe and cok it over low heat. You won't be disappointed.

FIRST TIME REAL FUDGE MAKER! Read the reviews and picked up on the Hershey's can recipe. Used the old can recipe and followed for the most part but used heavy cream 40% and the results are fantasic! I had no thermometer so I used the drop test and all was fine. I will try the 110 degree temp next time to aid in less beating. My boyfriend would not let me use chocolate chips or the box mix so I have found this recipe to really be much better and almost as easy. Goodbye to premix kits and the awful marshmellow creme mix. They don't even come close. Wish I had a slab of marble to pour on, this tempurs the mix much faster. Tomorrow I will make him Tiramisu. He always says nothing better than lovin from the oven!!

Wow - this is a wonderful recipe; however, the success or failure definately depends on a) getting the mixture off the heat just as soon as the soft ball forms in ice water and b) you're going to beat this for awhile - however, just as soon as it begins to lose it's sheen - STOP!  Pour it into your pan and wait for chocolately heaven!  (I made this recipe once before and it turned out awful - dry and crumbly.  Made the necessary adjustments and it was absolutely wonderful!)  Good luck!

If you are someone that likes baking quick breads and cookies with no patience, this recipe is not for you.  If you want to learn and are afraid to mess it up, try making a few batches of simple syrup (you'll never buy fake lemonade again!) and then progress to caramels (sugar wax, taffy, whatever) to get the hang of working with sugar.  This is a great recipe.  Simple ingredients and I was able to talk someone through it as I'm just getting over the flu and he hasn't worked much with sugars.  It was a little gritty because nobody is perfect.  X-)    BUT my five year old took a highly anticipated bite and whispered, "It tastes like chocolate cake and candy," with huge eyes.  That alone earns it five stars.  Easy to cut and get out of the dish.  We doubled the recipe and followed a lot of the tips in the reviews.  The small amount of grittiness was probably because the sides of the pot weren't swiped down very religiously.  Made it on an electric stove in a large pot usually used for boiling pasta.  Simmered very slowly to get as accurate of a temp reading as possible.

Even though my user name may suggest otherwise I have NO experience making candies. First attempt I accidently added butter before cooking (and another TBS after) and it still came out wonderful, I believe this is the same recipe my mother used but this came out better (she never had a thermometer). I was worried about using BOTH an electric stove AND alluminum sauce pan so I put a cast iron skillet down first and my saucepan on top of it. I did use a $3.00 candy thermometer that was actually calibrated pretty good, took me 45-50 minutes of simmering before hitting soft ball stage.

I give this 5 stars but they weren’t easy to achieve. My first try landed somewhere between dismal flop and tragic failure. As I was staring at the wreckage, all I could think of was, "Where am I going to get a new pot?". My second try, the thought running through my head was, "I am a genius chef, with unlimited powers." I blame my first failure on my thermometer. Both of them. After reading many reviews, I knew a thermometer was critical. No silly, arbitrary "soft ball stage” for me. So I went out and bought one, forgetting that I already had one. So I used both. I calibrated the one that could be calibrated, and commenced to cook. Short story shorter: I followed directions to the proverbial T and my fudge ended up the approximate consistency of lead.  Indisputable culprit: the thermometers, which, despite the calibration, showed a difference of 30 degrees. While surveying the wreckage of sugar and cocoa, I turned to desperation and tried just warming it up again. Amazingly, it quickly morphed back into a dark, glossy, delectable-looking substance. I immediately poured into a bowl and mistakenly started beating it, the last thing it needed. I also scraped the bowl out. All major faux pas’. But after it cooled, it was very tasty. Grainy but tasty. Give this batch to the kids. Two hours later, I tried again. Did everything the same but now highly skeptical of my thermometers. Resorted to the “soft ball” method, which worked perfectly.  Fudge came out amazing. End of story.

This by no means is "easy" fudge that is why I gave it a low rating.  Mine never hardened up.  For a first time fudge maker, I wish the directions would have at least gave an idea of how long to let it boil.  I got nervous about burning it so I don't think I cooked it long enough. Even though I did use the candy thermometer.......

epic fail!! haha...dont know what I did wrong, boiled and simmered for almost an hour to get it to softball stage.  After that I let it cool and added butter and vanilla and stirred and stirred and stirred to make it lose the sheen.  Added some walnuts and bam it set up in about 2 seconds, didnt get all of it out of the pan before it turned HARD..haha.  The taste is good, presentation, not so much.

This was my first time making fudge and it came out amazing! i did do it a little different though. I have an electric stove so I had to experiment with the temp a little. I cooked it on med and did stir with a wooden spoon occasionally so it would not burn. I tested often for soft ball stage since I do not have a thermometer. It took about 25 min to reach soft ball stage. I did not wait for it to cool as I could see it hardening quickly, so I added the vanilla and butter almost immediately. I stirred for about three minutes and added some pecans. It was getting really thick so I put it in my pan and patted it down to fit. It set in about 20 min. It has an amazing flavor! I will make this again!!

this took me over 30 minutes just to get it to boil, I don't know if it was because I don't have a double boiler or not, but it was frustrating.

Followed recipe to a T... Fudge was just not good. It didn't taste like fudge it tasted like chocolate. Very disappointed. Might be better with about 1/4 cup of cocoa rather than 1/2 cup.

YUMMM!!  I made this fudge today and it was fantastic.  I followed the directions and while I let it cool somewhat before adding the butter and vanilla, I think it only cooled down to about 140 or so before I added everything.  It was getting pretty thick and hard to stir at that point.  Once I added the butter and vanilla, I only had to stir about 3 minutes before it lost its shine and started to harden.  I quickly dumped it into my foil lined and greased pan and pressed it down with my hands.  30 minutes later it was set and ready to cut!!  YUM YUM YUM!  Just like my grandma used to make.  I am so happy to have found this recipe!  Thank you for posting it!

This seems to be a very popular recipe. I usually make terrific fudge, but this was the first time I made it with cocoa. It scorched on the bottom of the pot. No matter what I did, it always scorched. I gave up after my third try. I think I will stick with unsweetened chocolate instead.

Wonderful recipe.
Tweaked it a bit, let it cool before adding butter and vanilla and mixing. But otherwise the recipe was fantastic.
It was exactly what I was looking for, a REAL fudge recipe.
There will be bad reviews, as fudge making is NOT easy for many people and it fails easily.
I also say either double it, or use a smaller pan so it isn't thin.

First batch was a little runny. Second came out perfect. Not to sweet like most fudges. Oh and if your fudge doesn't thicken save for ice cream topping. YUMMY

OMG! This is the first time I've made fudge, and it came out PERFECTLY on my first try! One caveat though .... the directions here are incomplete. Fortunately, I didn't rush off to the kitchen with this recipe, kept reading, and learned that after removing from heat and adding the butter/vanilla extract, it should NOT be stirred or even disturbed at all until the fudge has cooled to 110 degrees. 

Otherwise, I followed the directions and ingredient amounts precisely, except to add walnuts while stirring out the gloss.

It took a full hour to cool down to 110, next time I'll place the bottom of the sauce pan in cold water to speed this up a bit, and will use a bit less than the 8 ounces of walnuts, and add them sooner, before the fudge has become too thick. My stirring time was only about 10 minutes, and the fudge must be moved quickly as it is drying rapidly. 

Make your fudge this way, and you'll be very pleased!

First before I begin, this fudge taste good. Besides that there are several errors in the recipe.
The yield is way off. I made a double batch of this fudge and even added nuts. I was preparing to pour into a 13 x 9 pyrex pan when I looked at the depth of fudge in the pan. I was using a 3 qt sauce pan which is about the dimensions of an 8 x 8 pyrex pan and it only registered about an 1 to 1-1/4 inches on my wooden spoon. So I switched to an 8 x 8 pyrex pan and the fudge ended up about 1 inch thick. I like a thicker fudge so it was good that I switched pans. Secondly the directions lack sufficient information. I'm a guy and I don't do these recipes but every now and again. So I'm not expert. But ladies I can boil water. My wife lets me do most of the cooking since I retired. Anyway the directions need to be fleshed out more in detail, such as what temperature to start with? High, medium or something else. Also it doesn't explain how long to cook it on a boil or how long to let it simmer. Lucky for me my nice wife had a candy thermometer which help me work through the lack of info. Hopefully this recipe will get edited for guys like me. Thanks for letting me share.

This was an excellent recipe! Yes, it's difficult to make--all fudge using the traditional method is--but it's sooooo worth the effort. Just be careful NOT TO STIR once the chocolate is boiling (sugar crystals in your candy=bad) keep it on a nice low temperature, cooking slowly over a long period of time, and beat the living crud out of it once it's at the right temp/stage. It's hard work but your tastebuds will thank you. 

I didn't have a candy thermometer or a wooden spoon, so I just used a metal one and whipped it 'til I thought my arm would fall off. But it was, bar none, the best tasting fudge I've ever had. The 'easy' kind doesn't compare.

I'm so glad I found this recipe! It's the closest thing to my mother's recipe that I have found. She passed away 8 yrs ago and I miss her dearly. We all loved her fudge & consider it to be the real thing.  I had a general idea how she made it but needed the specifics, like amounts and the temp...very important to use the thermometer!  I prefer these simple ingredients & the sugary texture as opposed to the creamy ones. I'm one of 7 children & I just sent this recipe to all of my siblings to enjoy :) THANKS SO MUCH for giving us Mom's recipe back.

So, funny story about this recipe. I have this exact recipe passed down to me from my Grandma, but I never met my Grandma so I always made it the way my mom made it. That meant when we tested the fudge in water the fudge needed to make a hard ball (not a soft ball) and it was never beaten. It was always more like a......chocolate hard candy almost. I managed to tweak it so that it was more grainy and soft, but not really FUDGE. So THIS time after reading this recipe it came out like fudge! I'm so excited! I wish my Grandma was around for me to have asked her how SHE made it :D

I love this recipe. I mix mine with a stand-up mixer, so I stop mixing after 2 minutes 30 seconds. If the consistency is too runny, I continue mixing in 30 second intervals. I don't mix until the mixture looses its gloss because the fudge will turn out too dry. It's my fault for using a stand-up, though.

Really good - I didn't make it best the first time but it tasted so good. So I will make again. Not sure what went wrong - when I took them to a friends they seemed melted. At my place they stayed solid - so maybe it was too warm at the friends?

I think this fudge is the best and easiest fudge I've ever made.  It is nothing like the marshmallow cream/chocolate chip fudges I've made and didn't really like. The texture and flavor are exactly what you get with the expensive fudges from the shops.  It took 10 minutes to make, an hour to cool, and voila, designer fudge.

Great fudge!  It's the first time I  make this type of fudge. Be patient in letting it simmer, it takes a while, you will see it decrease in volume some.  I stuck to it (since i did not have a cooking thermometer) and I kept dropping  drops of fudge in the cup of cold water. I had to change the water several times, since it got all cloudy at first. Finally, after a while, I saw balls of chocolate in the water and I knew it was done.  I also added toasted walnuts to mine, after adding the butter and AFTER mixing it thoroughly till it lost its sheen (about 5 min. of vigorous stirring). It set perfectly in the pan!

I have finally found the lost recipe which was lost from being passed down from my Grand Mother to my mother and then to me. The only difference is that our old recipe called for brown sugar too. So I substituted 1/2 of white with brown. Turned out well. 

I also recommend NOT to stir it after the initial mix together. I kept a few clean dry spoons on the side to periodically test for the  "soft ball" stage.

This was my first attempt at making fudge and it turned out perfect. I read the reviews and followed the hints the other reviewers suggested. Great recipe that reminded me of the fudge my mom used to make.

This is the first time for me to make fudge.  I mixed the cocoa and sugar in the pan with a wisk to get rid of any lumps, then I poured in raw, whole milk.  I continued to stir on med. heat with the wisk, and as soon as it started to bubble, I quit stirring.  I used a candy thermometer, and was surprised how long it took to get to 238 degrees also.  I wanted to cover the pan, but didn't, just watched the mercury slowly climb.  As soon as it hit soft ball stage, I shut off the flame and tossed in the butter and vanilla.  I waited until the thermometer read 115 degrees and started to stir with a wooden spoon. I had to sit down and hold the pan between my knees to stir it.  When the gloss disappeared, I grabbed my pan, turned around to pour it, and the fudge set up like concrete!  I managed to get it out of the pot into the pan, pressed it like a graham cracker crust, threw it in the oven at 200 for a few minutes, pulled it out, pressed it some more then threw it in the refridgerator.  It's a little crumbly, but oh, heaven in a pan! it melts in your mouth, so yummy!  Think I'll start stirring around 130 degrees and have the pan ready.

I love this! A friend of my mother's made fudge like this. I've never made real fudge before, just the chocolate chip/marshmallow kind. I followed the directions, but I was unprepared for how long it took to get to 238F. However, it turned out delicious! Now if only I can stop eating it...

Mt first attempt at this recipe was an epic fail. I went out this morning and bought a candy thermometer because I will not be defeated by a fudge recipe ;) The second batch was heavenly.

OMG! Words cannot express how absolutely AMAZING this fudge is. WOW! This was my first time making fudge and I have to admit, as a novice, I was both nervous & skeptical, given the temperamental/scientific nature of fudge-making & all the very specific do's & do not's. I bought a candy thermometer specifically for this recipe. I followed all the advice in the reviews (for which I am indebted) to the letter. I used dark cocoa & 3/4 cup 1% milk, 1/4 cup half & half cream. I brought the mixture to a boil over slightly above med heat, stirring constantly, then turned the heat down to med-low & stopped stirring. It took a total of about 30 mins to heat to 238 degrees. Then I removed it from the heat to cool, still not stirring. It took 30 minutes or so to cool to 110. At this point I almost threw the works in the garbage, as it was next to impossible to stir (very stiff). But because of the advice in the reviews I kept going. I transferred the 'thick goop' to a plastic mixing bowl & beat the hell out of it with an electric mixer until it lost its sheen (I don't know how anyone did this by hand!). I mixed in 1/2 cup of chopped toasted pecans right before tranferring it. I pressed the fudge into a 6x8 glass dish lined with wax paper. I used a smaller dish than what the recipe called for because the reviews said the recipe didn't make a lot. The smaller dish allowed for thicker pieces. This was a time-consuming endeavor, but WELL worth the effort! I can't wait to serve it at Xmas!

This is the fudge recipe I grew up with.  I have been looking for it, but it is so hard to find fudge that doesn't contain condensed milk or corn syrup.  This is a wonderful fudge, the other stuff isn't fudge at all!

Making this fudge is act in patience.  Good fudge cannot be rushed.  It has taken me years to perfect it.  You need a good heavy pan to make this in and a candy thermometer.  My mom always made this and this is my dad's favorite fudge so I try to make this for him.  He loves it with chopped pecans in it.

Great recipe but I agree with some of the other users in that a person inexperienced with cooking sugar (such as myself) would benefit from a few more details in this part of the instructions.  As it is I ended up with an excellent fudge sauce, which goes well with ice cream.

Simple and great recipe. Look if you are having trouble, then slow down. You are probably rushing. Just a tip, it's better to over mix than under mix so if you think it might not be beaten enough...then do it a little longer.

Wow! After reading the reviews I was a nervous wreck making this but it turned out just perfect! It only gets 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the aount of effort entailed. They aren't kidding about the flavor though - it is creamy and incredible!  I would definitely say do NOT make this recipe for your book club or the cookie exchange without doing several practice runs first, it is a very tricky / skilled recipe. Plus any candy recipe won't set right if the humidity is high. If you just want something sweet to eat, well go for it!  I buttered my pot and used about 5Tbsps cocoa and 1 square baking choc. since that's what I had in the house. I admit, I stirred it a couple times too, (clean spoon each time to avoid crystals!) only because it seemed like it was burning to the bottom. It took about 30 minutes at a boil to reach even a semi-softball stage, more like a "goop in the water" stage; but it worked. I let it cool, started up the mixer, and after about 7 minutes it still had a sheen but was thickening. I decided that was good enough for me and put it in the pan, and it set just fine in about 45 minutes in the fridge. I stirred peanut butter in the top too - simply outstanding!

It's awesome fudge!!  You just have to know how to work with candy.  I actually put the pot into a cold water bath in the sink to cool it down a little quicker. (A big thick pot holds the heat for a long time) and used my electric hand mixer to "beat" the fudge.  Worked out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!!

So I feel the urge to make fudge one night and I cannot find a recipe that does not include bakers chocolate, of which I do not have in my pantry, and I keep thinking to myself, "Back in the day that had to have made fudge without running down the store to pick up the baker's chocolate!" I'm skimming through the recipes and I see "Old-Fashioned Chocolate Fudge". "This is it!" I think, and having never before made fudge, I begin my culinary journey. As I set off I realize quickly that along with the baker's chocolate, I do not own a candy thermomator, and this may pose as a problem as the challenge of the soft-ball test looms in my near future. Patiently, I work through the process of dropping the sticky substance into a glass of water and desperately waiting for something to form that distinctly resembles a soft-ball. This never happened. I re-"google" what exactly the soft-ball test is...victory! I used cookie cutters to cut out the fudge after it hardened and created some nice Christmas treats.

First fudge recipe I got to work for me...arm is sore, but it's totally worth it.  

I'd highly recommend this: took me all of 5 minutes to measure everything out and get it together.  Once it was boiling, I used a digital thermometer to watch the T, and then let it cool to about 180degF before I stirred like crazy.  When it hit about 110degF, I poured it into my prepared 8x8 glass pan, and it solidified like a charm...and tastes WONDERFUL!  

One minus: it makes a small batch.  The only problem I have with this recipe is that I want more  :)

As a first time fudge-maker, I was very nervous when I set out to try this!!  I read every review, and got so many very helpful hints.
To my delight (and that of my 5 year old son)it has turned out wonderfully!!!  My arms are aching from all of the stirring, but it is smooth & creamy, and soooo much better than any fudge I have bought recently!  Melt in your mouth awesome!!
The tips about ensuring no sugar crystals got into the fudge after it started to boil, what a "soft ball" is (I can't find my candy thermometer, I know it's here somewhere!!), and not to give up on the stirring were excellent advice!
This recipe has become a new family favorite..."nummy" is the quote from my chocolate encrusted sous-chef!!

I followed the recipe exactly. Before I go on I just want to say that I gave it three stars because I liked the taste of the fudge. However I was expecting a consistency of something like a Hershey bar except just not as hard as a Hershey bar. Mine came out similar to a fudge Brownie instead of fudge candy. Even after 24 hrs the bottom of the fudge was still very soft and sticky. I did not have a thermometer to check the temperature so I used the drop in cold water to test the consistency of the mix. Question is why did it turn out and stay so soft on the bottom. I don't know if I beat it too long or not long enough. My mix stayed shiny even after several minutes of beating. So I guess I don't understand the beating until the sheen is gone. This is my very first time ever baking anything from scratch. My wife does not bake not even when all it requires is remove from package and bake at 400 deg. for 18 minutes. So if anyone can help me to understand why my fudge came out so soft on the bottom after cooling I would appreciate it. How can I make it come out right the second time if I continue to follow the recipe and do the same thing each time?

This is far and away the best fudge ever. I originally got this recipe from the back of the Hershey's Cocoa tins long, long ago and have been making it ever since. 

It can be a bit tricky and you can't rush it. You must be patient. And on humid days I don't even bother making it because typically it will not harden. It does make nice topping for ice cream however if this happens :-)

This is one of my favorite recipes for the holidays along with divinity and christmas tree shaped spritz cookies!

This is the same recipe I grew up making for Fudge.  I'll admit - True, Fudge isn't the easiest thing in the world to make for a novice - but for anyone comfortable baking and cooking, it really is quite simple.  And the results are well worth it. 

The biggest caution I know, since so many expressed problems with their fudge not setting - is that Fudge (and chocolate) is temperamental - if the humidity is too high, it will not set.

My grandmother taught me to make this recipe when I was a child.  I've never understood how marshmallow creme and chocolate chips can be considered fudge - seems like cheating to me!  I'm 24, so knowing how to make this isn't common among my peers.  It's a secret weapon.  Thanks for keeping it going!

There must be an art to making fudge.  I followed the recipe exactly....my failure seemed to be in the last two steps.  Perhaps I didn't work fast enough, even though I was making a conscious effort to.  The taste was excellent, but the texture was all wrong.  I think fudge is one of those things you have to see someone make a couple of times in order to be able to get it right....at least the old fashioned kind without marshmellow cream, etc.

I had problems with this recipie.  I simmered it for one hour and kept dropping bits into water to see if it was a "soft-ball"  Once I had determined it was, I beat it mercilessly with wooden spoon as directed and poured it into a pan.  It never hardened properly.  The texture was like thick frosting.  The taste was too sweet and though I used Cadbury's cocoa powder, the chocolate taste was a bit off.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I don't think I will try it again.

Delicious fudge, but it takes forever to make. The heating stage took nearly an hour. Then I beat it and beat it and it never really lost it's gloss, so I poured it in the pan anyway. If I'd known how much work it would be, I would have doubled the recipe, because it really was quite tasty and I might want to make it again.

This is the same recipe my mother has been using for 50 years, I loved it growing up and has become a family tradition. When ever I make other kinds my family says it's just not the same!!

Loved this old fashioned recipe!! It tought me patience.. Be sure to cool slightly before beating.  Be sure it reaches the 238° F. I'll be making this again with some toasted walnuts!!!

Had to make two batches of this fudge as I followed the advice of Sailselan and Cindy, who in previous reviews advised against logic to cool a softball candy to 115F before you mix in butter and vanilla and beat. Know that if you do this you will break your arm trying to mix into a toffee candy and if you can mix it the fudge will be crumbly.

Instead, if you let the mixture cool a little bit before you mix in the butter and vanilla you will be beating less time, but make sure it is warm enough that you can still stir the mixture adequately and the fudge will set up creamier and smoother. The flavor and texture is worth it.

I have made this a few times, using a slightly modified recipe.  I add a cup of chopped walnuts along with the vanilla and butter.  Also, I add a tablespoon of light corn syrup after adding the milk and stir in before I turn on the burner.  Once the mixture begins to boil, I turn the heat down to med-low, cover with a lid and allow it to "sweat" for two minutes.  After two minutes, I remove the lid, place the thermometer into the mixture, and leave it alone until it reaches the desired temperature.  I discovered the "sweating" tip from Alton Brown's show on making fudge.  Works great for me!

I made this fudge following the ingredients in the recipe.  It turned out good.  Luckily I read many of the reviews as I found the original directions a little vague.  After I reached the soft ball stage (138f) I removed my pot off the burner without disturbing the contents and added the vanilla and butter. I did not mix it at this time.  I waited for the ingredients in the pot to cool to 110f as recommend by other reviews. I then used a wooden spoon and beat the ingredients together. The mixture began to lose its gloss and thicken.  I also used a hand blender (low-medium speed) at this time to help with the beating.  I poured the fudge into my prepared pan.  I think next time I may use a smaller pan to put the fudge in so that I can cut thicker squares.  This recipe was great because once you bring everything to the initial boil you don't have to continuously stir the mixture to get to the soft ball stage, like many other candy recipes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the same recipe my mom made when I was growing up and everyone loved her fudge!!  I thought it was on old family recipe from the south because I never knew of anyone else that made it this way.  It is hard but melts in your mouth.  I'm happy I now know how to make it for my family.  I cook mine in a large iron skillet. My mom always used the cold water test.  I use a thermometer ;)  Perfect every time

Never make it on a humid day.  The flavor was great, but it was sticky and too soft.  I'm going to try making it again when the humidity level is lower.

I give this only three because when I made it exactly as stated, it tasted much too dark (to the point where it tasted more like cocoa powder than chocolate) and would not set.  I tried some of the other reviewers recipe alterations and liked the taste a bit better, but then found it to be too sweet after cooling.  And it still came out like soup.  So then I made it to my tastes: 2.5c sugar, 2/3c. cocoa powder, 6T. butter divided, 1.25c. milk, 1T. vanilla, and 1/4 t. salt.  Loved the taste...had to cook it to 255 in order for it to get to a soft ball when dropped in cold water.  It COULD be that my thermometer is inaccurate, but I cook candies (taffy, caramel, etc) frequently, and I never have problems when following the instructions (at least not by a difference of 14 degrees).  Anyway, I chose to use this recipe because of the method--I'm kind of old school that way :)  I will say this, though, don't judge the taste until after it has cooled and set completely.  It will likely taste dark when it is still warm and soft, but the sweetness intensifies with cooling.  Good method...generally accurate instructions, thought the ingredients could use a few tweaks, but overall not bad.

Brand new to this fudge thing and it turned out amazing!!! I undercooked it the first time and it refused to be beaten(it was like syrup). I put it back on the stove and boiled the heck out of it and I got my soft ball within 5 minutes of it being boiled on medium heat. After that I let it cool for 10 minutes and it was beautiful!!! If I can do it you certainly can

Thank you so much for this recipe. I haven't made it yet but I know it is good. This is the fudge my mom always made but I never had the recipe. I can remember it so clearly because after she put in the vanilla and butter, it was my job to beat it. I had to hold the bottom of the pan under a slow stream of cold water to help it cool down and heaven help me if I got water in it. For all of you who have ever made fudge. If it doesn't set, call it spoon fudge and serve it with spoons. I have made many batches of peanut butter spoon fudge until I found 2 recipes on this site. My spoon fudge days are over.

So yummy. I made this three days ago and it has not crystallized yet, I wiped down the sides with wet paper towel and I did not stir after it came to boil and until it had cooled down to 140°F. It has strong chocolate flavor but that is a part of how delicious it is. I'm making a new batch tomorrow because this one disappeared too quickly :)

I'm an idiot, so don't do what I did, and don't let my mistake stop you from trying this fantastic recipe. It really is delicious! I made it with fresh goat milk, which is excellent in fudge. My mistake, after doing everything else so carefully, was to pour the hot fudge into my stand mixer bowl for beating, turn it on and forget about it until I had overbeaten fudge shards flying around my kitchen. (You can use a stand mixer for this, but you have to pay attention and stop the mixer right when the fudge loses its shine. Don't go do something else like I did!) In spite of my mistake, the flavor was great, and I'm saving the shards to use as a topping for cakes, ice cream, etc.

I finally go this recipe right. IT IS AMAZING!!!! It does take a lot of work, patience, and listening to what others have advised, if you are a first time fudge maker. I am a first time fudge maker. I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 inch pan of it. I totally thought I messed this recipe up because it would not set and solidify. So I followed another reviewers advice, I stuck it back in a pot nuts added and all and boiled it again. I then pulled it off the stove when my candy thermometer reaches 240 degree (F). I waited until it cooled again to 110 degrees (F). I put it in my kitchen aid blender with the flat blending attachment and set it at 4 speed. It took about 30 minutes until it got very thick like it would almost set in the mixer bowl. Then I poured it in the pan. Another 10 minutes to let it set for sure and I had excellent fudge. Everyone absolutely love it. This has been a rewarding experience. GREAT FUDGE sure to be a hit.

I made this fudge EXACTLY as written and it didn't thicken.  I know something must have gone very wrong, but I don't know what.  I used a candy thermometer to make sure the temps were right but to no avail.

Thank you, this is the same recipe my mother used. I can also remember when she would try to make it on rainy days, it never would harden for her and we would eat it with a spoon. this is by far the best fudge ever. you can also add peanut butter to this but it will harden it almost instantly.

5 stars for the taste...it's wonderful.  First time I made it, I didn't cook it quite long enough and after beating it to death, I ended up keeping it in the fridge and we ate it with a spoon.  Tonight I made it for the second time [with a candy therm. this time] and I followed the instructions...and about 20 secs into beating it, it was not even spreadable...now it's dry and crumbly...  :-(   Maybe the third time will be the charm.

Merry Christmas everyone. Just made this fudge and it was outstanding. THANK you for all the extra hints...... My gram used to make this and my mom.. I used to start the beating hahaha  but never finished .. Gram and mom would.. I DID it all today.. They would be pleased.. Great recipe and love the simplistic of it.

This tasted good, but my fudge making skills aren't very good and it didn't set, most likely because I didn't beat it long enough. My husband has used the soft chocolate as a spread on crackers and bread, and likes it very much more than peanut butter or Nutella.

First try - NOT GOOD. I think I may have dropped a drop of water in the hot liquid as I was testing for soft ball stage. It didn't change at the time, but the end result was weird. As one lady said, after I pulled it off the heat, I waited to 180 then put butter and vanilla on top. I prepped for the mixer - elbow hurting- when I began mixing, in like two seconds, it was matte and glopping up. There were no grains of sugar - and I stopped stirring at soft ball stage and took off heat. I did put it in a dish, and if it still tastes good, I may coat it with something and serve as truffle or something as others have done. Later today - round two. I have prepped for it. I have put in 1/2 TBSp corn starch. We shall see how this round goes. I am not giving up. I will go broke before I give up. (2) cooked for a second time and it was a PAIN. BUT it came out crispy like a familiar honeycomb candy I recall from England. It is yummy. Look forward to round 3.

this was my first attempt at fudge and it was AMAZING! the BEST fudge i've ever had. it is best if you line the pan with a thin layer of butter and put it in the fridge before you put in the fudge. this makes the fudge come out without sticking. this is a great recipe

I think this is a good recipe, but I'm terrible at making fudge and candy.  The flavour is good, but mine turned out crumbly and dry.  Not sure if I let it cool too long before beating or if it just got over cooked.  Ah well, fudge defeats me again!

it is delicious but i suggest you might want to double or triple the recipe it is very thing depending on the size pan you use.         although it is delicious so you should try it. the only reason i didn't give it a five is because i tdoesn't make a bunch like i said it is kind of thin layered so i hope you enjoyed it as much as i did

I looked and looked for an easy fudge recipe and came across this one. This recipe doesnt explain well enough on how long to stir or exactly what sheen is. I will never make this recipe again.

Awesome Fudge. Easy to make if you  READ OTHER REVIEWS FOR HINTS!!!!  My 10 year old son and I just made this.  It was my first fudge making experience  EVER and it came out great.  I am certain that reading hte helpful hints helped.  We have a digital candy thermometer and that really made it easy and fun.  Thanks to everyone who contributed to this recipe.

For goodness sake, I tried this recipe twice! I just threw away the recipe cos I am not going to make it a third time and fail again. I'm upset cos I have lost my time and have this unsatisfied chocolate craving!! I wonder what went wrong as I did have the right temperature with my candy thermometer. I guess I beated it too long? or did not allow to cool long enough before beating? I followed the recipe...I'll go read all the reviews to try to see where I failed.

Very good fudge from "the old days", much richer chocolate flavor than the quick methods out there today.  I wish I had followed the tip from another reviewer to let it come down in temp before I started beating in the butter/vanilla, I think it would've been less tiring that way!

Nothing about this recipe was easy.   I'd like to say I'd try it again, but I'm going to move to another recipe.  I used to do recipes with the bakers squares.  Perhaps I will return to that.  I heated up slowly, but when I went to a simmer the whole thing plateued.  it took forever to get to 138 degrees.  I waited til it cooled and when I added the butter I stirred.  it didn't take too long to lose it's sheen.  It went all at once.  I couldn't pour it into the pan.  It began to crumble before I could even flatten it.  Now it's just a pile of crumbs.  Nothing smooth or creamy about this mess.  I made better fudge last week with a different recipe.  I'm sad to say I won't waste my sugar on this recipe again.

This is the fudge recipe I remember growing up with at home. I'm 64 and my Mom and Grandmother made this all the time, the only thing is it sure doesn't last long. My grandaughter and I made this for her first time she was very willing to help stir, she couldn't wait for it to cool and set up. She informed me it was well worth the wait. Looking forward to making this again soon. It's totally awesome.

This recipe was delicious. My first time making fudge. I was a little worried b/c when i added the butter, it still only looked like hot fudge. I didn't realize how long I had to beat it with the spoon. Just be patient and it will thicken up. Will make this again

I attempted to use an ice-water bath to determine the 'soft ball' stage; however, it did not work for me. In the end, though it tasted pretty good, the texture did not exactly resemble a fudge. If you are to use this recipe, I advise either a candy thermometer or lots of cooking experience.

This was my second attempt at fudge and it is great!  I must admit that you have to be patient with this and make sure the temp comes up to soft ball and be sure to beat the mixture long enough (it seemed to take FOREVER..ha ha, but took about 20 mins)  I will definitely make it again.

I followed this to the letter, was a total flop. I used both a thermometer and water test and it did not harden up. It tasted quite nice but was very soft when picked up and was very messy. Not sure what I did wrong. Not sure how one reviewer did it in 15 mins it took me alot longer then that to get to the right temp.

This is exactly what I was looking for, turned out great. Does take a while to reach temp. but well worth it.
I did let it cool to 110 before mixing in the vanilla and butter, thanks to everyone for that tip. I will definatly make this again.

Well...this recipe reminded me of the fudge my mom used to make..so I tried it.  It took FOREVER to thicken.  I had a new candy thermometer I used for 1st time, and it never did reach the temp. it was supposed to.  Finally, I completed the recipe and put it in fridge..turned out okay.  I just didn't have a lot of luck.  It was VERY sugary tasting.  I'll stick to the "Chocolate Peanuty Fudge" I usually make off of this site...MUCH better.  I'm giving this recipe a 3...not very creamy at all, and I followed recipe exactly.

Best if made on clear, dry day. Too much humidity can effect this recipe. I always let it cool to room temp. after adding butter and vanilla and before stirring.

I was looking for a recipe like the one my grandma used to make at Christmas, and I think this is the exact one.

It's no easy task to get it right, and its definately an arm workout, but worth it for sure.  I love the super chocolatey and not-too-sweet flavor of this fudge.  It makes me think of Holidays growing up!

This was my first time making candy and it came out GREAT!  It took forever to cook though and my arm began to hurt while stirring it but I am sure I will get used to it because I will definitly be using this recipe again!

This fudge is good and fairly easy to make, but the recipe is missing a crucial step. The mixture should be allowed to cool before the final stirring phase begins. My first batch burned because of this.

DEEE-LICIOUS!!!  I've only made it once, but I will definately do it again.  It wasn't too hard.  It took afew minutes to get the right temp, but well worth the effort.

There is a tiny story with this fudge. My mom had given me a recipe that she had written on a recipe card with splatters of cocoa and a ring of chocolate where she must have set something on it while reading it. My mom passed away a few years ago about three days before her 90th birthday. I have moved that recipe card through so many homes and areas with a divorce and relocation and for the life of me I can't seem to find it. I decided to google it and see if something came up with the ingredients as I remembered them just not how much of each. This recipe is the same as my mom's and it is the best fudge I have ever had. If I hadn't have eaten it all with my son I would have posted a shot of it. Next time... So I printed it off and I added three little circles of cocoa mixture off the bottom of my measuring cup to make it look like the one my mom had. That is until I find the original with my mom's handwriting as it is here somewhere hopefully tucked into a random cookbook possibly but as my son says that doesn't matter as we have found the recipe. :-)

OP is right, made well this makes the best, Real, fudge,  This was very similar to the recipe my Mom used. Her's used 2oz unsweetened baking chocolate instead of cocoa.   These instructions leave a lot to be desired, they are over simplified and the demo bears that out..it should never look that dry and thick when you put in in the pan to set up.  That said, for those who said it was too liquid, this does require a candy thermometer and does not rely on time.. It Must be brought to the proper temperatures in order to become fudge..or it will fail.  There is a lot of technique to making candy..and this does not cover all that goes into making good fudge.  It's a lot of work and even then it can fail as fudge..but it can be used to make a fudge sauce or frosting by remelting and adding milk..so it doesn't have to be a total waste; just disappointing if you were craving fudge!  Go watch a YouTube demo of fudge making to see the techniques that apply to any old fashioned fudge recipe.

My mom always said "when you can hear it crackle, it's time to pour". That's how I always stop stirring at just the right time.

The written recipe does not match the video. In the video it says to cool to 110 before adding butter and vanilla but the written directions do not mention that.

Those who live at higher elevations, read this. 

Once I got the right temp for my elevation the recipe was perfect! I remember this recipe from my childhood and had successfully made it in the past. But I now live at 4700 ft and after two failed attempts (consistency was way too hard although I followed directions exactly) I googled “soft ball stage” and found info about cooking temps at higher elevations (see link below). I made the temp conversion as suggested and my fudge was perfect!

I made this yesterday, my very first fudge, for our neighbours gathering and ... PERFECT ! Everyone asked for the recipe! But I did accidentally make a change to it ; I forgot to add the vanilla and butter and I have to say that I will never add them the next time I make it ; it was just great  the way it was!
Instead of making squares I cut long 1 inch strips and rolled them up and placed them in mini cupcake liners, sprinkled some shredded coconut and ground walnuts ... mmm!

Delicious! I didn't exactly follow directions to the letter, too impatient. I didn't think it would set up like fudge, so I poured it into a pie crust, let it cool and put ice cream on top.  Ah-mazing.  It is similar to the Mississippi mud pie that used to be served at a restaurant that was called Po'Folks near Atlanta years ago. It's all I can do not to finish off the whole thing right now!  Thank you for this recipe!

Not sure what I did wrong!! Taste was good, but was too hard--not fudge consistency at all!! First time, I'll try again!! I cooked to 236 and then cooled--one of those things was too much.   If at first you don't succeed, try try again!!!

My fudge came out so delicious! As this was my first time making fudge, I wasn't sure if I had done it right, but I brought some to work, and everyone said it was the best fudge they had ever had. I couldn't get it to stir thick like the video, so I just poured it into the glass pan and stuck it in the freezer for half an hour. I'm not sure what I had done differently. I am going to make it again for my Christmas party!

After one lowers the temp to let simmer, how does one expect to get the temp to 240 or so? I had to return my batch back to boil. Did I miss something?

Finally!  I found the fudge my mother use to make.  I am not a fan of creamy style fudge, I prefer to have a bit of a crunch.  I made this for my family and everyone loved it.  They all said exactly the same thing, "It's moms fudge!"  We will be making this more often for the grandchildren, they adored it.  I made it exactly as written and it turned out fantastic.

I used Hershey  special dark coco.  I ran into one problem using a glass top range.  I was unable to regulate the heat and get up to tempatire. I attemptd to keep the burner on high and still had the burner cycle on and off.  Ended up with what turned out to be a awesome hot fudge sauce.

WHOA !!!!  I have never made fudge before in my life but decided to give this recipe a try...and I'm glad I did.  I made this as directed with no changes and I think I've died and gone to Fudge Heaven !!  I was planning on giving this as Christmas Gifts, but my inner Ebenezer Scrooge has reared his head and this batch is MINE !!  

Thank you for a truly phenomenal recipe !!

Such a great recipe! Easily made dairy free with equal parts of canned coconut milk (keeps it creamy) or almond milk (not as rich and creamy). Tastes delicious either way!

The only change I make is when I take the pan off the heat i put in a sink full of  ice water as I beat it.  It speeds up cooling process.  If you beat it too long & it gets grainy, just add a bit more milk - 1/4 to 1/2 a cup & reheat it again until it reaches the soft ball stage & beat again.

This is my go to basic fudge recipe that I've used for years. Its foolproof - as long as you follow the instructions to the absolute letter - and use a thermometer. 

I always double up and use a thermometer - and do the soft ball test - because once you've taken it off the heat, that's it sunshine - you can't go back and fix it. 

I use 1tb real vanilla extract personally, but each to their own. 

As a guide on the beating part - you really cannot 'overbeat:' this stuff. You'll know you're there, when it becomes very thick and viscous - as opposed to the liquid it is when you first add the butter and vanilla - and - it is starting to cool enough that you're noticing its sticking to the sides of the saucepan and drying. Personally, after all these years making it - I've never noticed an appreciable difference in the glossiness - so I never follow the mix 'losing its gloss' as a gauge. 

Make it properly - and you'll be rewarded. One small error and it doesn't turn out perfectly. Still - even if you stuff it up - scooping it out of the pan with a spoon - on top of vanilla icecream is awesome! 

Happy fudging!

I have never made old fashioned fudge before and this turned out beautifully.  I followed the advice on other reviews and buttered the pot before adding ingredients, used a candy thermometer, and wiped around the edge of the pan before stirring.  Turned out creamy and delicious.  Thanks!

This is the fudge my mom always made for holidays. I learned how to make it from her and now I'm teaching the nieces and nephews. It does take practice to figure out just when to pour it into the pan. Mom always said it has to be gloppy.  When it's done right it is the best.

This is my favorite ever recipe for chocolate fudge. I don't like the fudge with the marshmallow fluff in it. Funny as it sounds it is to smooth and a little mushy. I like my fudge a little grainy and firm. This recipe comes out perfectly! I have used it for 2 years and the ONE batch (so far) that didn't firm up (my thermometer wasn't accurate) it made the best suace for ice cream!

From someone in the middle of cooking this fudge, how the heck are you suppose to know when it gets to 115 or 110 degrees Fahrenheit when I don't have a candy thermometer?

This is strictly old fashioned fudge and the best!  The only way I make it.  Only thing I will change is, spray your cooking pot with Pam as it prevents "sugaring!"

I have never tried fudge, as it's not popular where I live. I have never made it as well. So after I had bough a candy thermometer I decided to give it a try. No stirring and no shaking during simmering. Waited it to cool till 140 F (had no patience to wait further). Then mixed in butter, vanilla and shredded coconut. After beating this vigorously I spooned it out in the pan generously sprinkled with more shredded coconut and then put it in the fridge only for an 1 hour! (yes, I'm too impatient). And it seems to me I made everything right, as it was so easy to slice and not chewy/grainy at all (and with a beautiful coconut bottom). Anyway I give it only 4 stars, as IMO it's OVER-SWEET. After eating a few squares I've got a toothache. I'm sure it's necessary to cut down the sugar.

I just made this, following the exact recipe and I am so impressed. This was my first time ever making fudge and it turned out fantastic. It has the minimalist of graininess, which was amazing as I messed up twice. (I misunderstood the starting directions and didn't stir it till it started to boil, and wasn't able to remove all of the crystallized pan edges). 
I'm very happy with the results and can't wait to master this.

I tried this recipe because it seemed easy, but I obviously screwed it up.  I must not have beaten it long enough?   After cooking, beating, etc.,  I put it in the pan, put in the fridge and went out for a few hours.  After returning, it was still not set.  However, it is a really delicious sauce!  I'm going to try this again, I must not have cooked it long enough either,  even though my thermometer was reading around 238 degrees when I removed from the heat.  It is raining today, I don't know if that is a factor.  But I am determined, and I'm going to give this another go!

This recipe is perfect!! After adding the butter and vanilla, I stirred for about 15 minutes. Thought that might help newbie fudge makers like me who have zero idea of how long to expect to stir. Mine has set up beautifully. Woo hoo!!

This is the fudge recipe I grew up with in the 50's...love it!  What memories I have of my sister and I making this fudge, and how wonderful it was!  If it didn't set up or harden, not a problem, we just ate it like it was! Truly fond memories of those experiences!  Yum!

This fudge is AWESOME.  I think I messed up a little because mine came out pretty dry, but it melted in my mouth and tasted delicious. I will definitely make this again, it is so much better than the marshmallow and chocolate chip fudge that I tried before.

Since failing with a different recipe, I was on a mission to make fudge.I buttered my glass pan and went to work at 5am. It's now 755am and my perfect fudge is cooling. I used 3 cups of sugar, 1 cup milk, 2/3 cup cocoa. 6 Tb salted butter, 1 1/2 Tb vanilla and a 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Cooked for 20 mins on medium. A little sweet but good. Next time I will wake up & have coffee first & use the amount of sugar called for.

As they say, 3rd time is a charm. My very first time making fudge ever and I chose this recipe because of the baking cocoa and because the recipe makes it seem easy. Well, I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it is not that easy. After 2 fails resulting in goo and reading the reviews with the stirring tips I got it right!!! It has not yet fully cooled but the texture is good as well as the firmness, and it tastes great!

I never write reviews, ever, but after waking to a boyfriend begging for fudge, I was dreading the complicated task.  Despite all the reviews,this way really easy to make.  As long as you're able to accurately read a thermometer you can successfully make this recipe.  I do suggest using an electric mixer, it makes the task a lot easier!

My husband and I have made this recipe twice, we didn't quite understand the directions the first time but got a friend to help us the second time and it worked out great. The fact that you bring it to a boil then let it continue on simmer with the thermometer and make sure the temperature gets ALL the way to 238 F is very important. Yummy :)

This recipe is very yummy but it does NOT yield 60 pieces in a 8x8 pan even if you double it.
Use a smaller pan and it might cut up into 20 medium pieces

Well this seemed to work.  We tried two other recipes first that failed badly.  It could be that here in calgary near the mountains with our higher elevation boiling point is different.  We only went to 225 and it was at soft ball stage.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a simple yet traditional recipe for fudge and this proved to be a great one. I had a little trouble knowing when the soft-ball stage occurred- for me it took nearly half and hour simmering. It would have helped if the time was listed in the recipe so those who don't own a candy thermometer would know. I beat my fudge for 5-10  minutes after adding the butter as suggested in the betty crocker cookbook. Great recipe- I do recommend.

This was the best fudge hands down that I've had.  Very smooth and creamy and not overly sweet.  It's the first time I've ever made fudge and it turned out great.  I followed the directions exactly.  I also topped it with a peanut butter and cream cheese topping.  Yummy!

This is my mother's fudge recipe.  I have been looking for it for a while now.  Follow the tips in other reviews for terrific results.  You will not go back to the marshmallow/chocolate chip stuff!

I love this recipe! I found it on this website back in 2005 and have been making it every year for Christmas since.  Everyone loves it, including my husband and son who say they are not fans of chocolate.

My mom taught me how ot make this version when I was 15, using the soft ball method. Sometimes I liking adding a bit of smooth peanut butter to cut the edge off the rich chocolate flavor.

DELICIOUS..... But not quite worth the hassle, in my opinion. It didn't yield anywhere near 60 pieces, and maybe I did something wrong, but it came out kind of grainy, (maybe the sugar didn't dissolve properly). Not that it wasn't good, because it was, and it was eaten quickly, but next time I'll stick to the marshmallow/chocolate chip recipes. 

This was my first fudge recipe that I didn't make with marshmallows and chocolate chips, and it still tasted very delicious, but it was no better or worse than the chocolate chip/marshmallow kind., and neither my husband nor I were able to tell a difference between this recipe and the one with the chocolate chips.

My husband and I made up a batch of this decadent treat for Christmas. Of course, being first time fudgies, we tried to follow the advice in the comments section. We took the advice of one who said to wait until the cooling mixture reaches 115 degrees F before adding the butter and vanilla and beating it. The fudge lost it's sheen very quickly and set up as we were pouring it into the pan. It was crumbly and hard and although it tasted great I decided to attemp a "fix". I crumbled the entire batch, put it into a microwave safe bowl and heated it up on high power for 3 minutes. I added another tablespoon of butter and re- beat the mixture until it started to lose it's shine and quickly presses it into a pan. Our family loved it. I can't wait to  make it for our next special occasion.

I make this fudge every Christmas, only my recipe is a little different.  Same ingredients, but the measurements are different.  I got it off of the Hershey tin years ago, as others have stated.  It is the BEST!  Nothing compares.

I'm a man, and I can change, if I have to, I guess, but i cannot seem to get this fudge thing right!  this is definitely an art that i can't get the hang of.  My mom used to make this, and I wish I had gotten training from her on how to make it before she got dementia.  I have tried this 10 times over the last 5 years, and I either undercook it and get syrup, or overcook it and get gorilla glue.  I will agree this is the best tasting fudge if you can get the hang of it.  I appreciate all the suggestions, and I will give it another try!

I enjoyed this recipe although it was my first time making any kind of fudge, I felt I had done a fairly good job for my first time.  I added peanut butter at the very end because I'm pretty sure my mom used this same recipe for her peanut butter fudge when I was young.

I used a thermometer and went against my better judgment which told me it wasn't hot enough and stopped at the temperature recommended. I wound up with sauce instead of fudge.

One point I haven't seen in recent reviews is that the chocolate chip or marshmallow fudges are expensive to make in comparison to something with simple (and more economical) ingredients, which attracted me to this recipe in the first place.

Excellent recipe, but you need a good candy thermometer.  If you havent made real fudge before it may take a couple of times (it did for me) but it was worth it.  This fudge is the best I have ever tasted!

I was just reading this recipe and I make some fabulous fudge myself. My grandma used to make the hershey's  fudge recipe off of the can, so I learned when I was 11 to make fudge and now that I am 29 I don't have a recipe.  but I do get lots of orders for me to bring my fudge to Christmas gatherings...    I put creamy pb in mine as well as marshmallow cream and I also add pecans sometimes :) I never put butter in it and it always turns out great:)    Fudge is an art for sure but anyone can make it. They just have to be patient and practice. Mine comes out great tasting every time but sometimes it is harder or softer depending on how busy I am around the house with the kids....:):)

This was fairly good, but too sweet and milk-chocolate tasting for me.  I'll be looking for a darker, more semi-sweet recipe.

First time I ever made fudge and it was perfect!  Took about 16 minutes to reach 238 degrees. Used a hand mixer on low for the beating (about 4 minutes til it started thickening)  and tossed in 1/2 cup toasted black walnuts right before turning out.  Firm with a creamy texture. Fabulous recipe! Thanks!!

Spec-friggin-tacular!  I followed the directions exactly and other than the fact that it took a little longer than I expected to get to temp, it worked out perfectly.  In the last minute of beating it, I added a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans, just cause I love em.  This was wonderful.  A great recipe to share with friends, this is a keeper!  Thanks!

Ok as others have said, not a beginner recipe!  I've never made fudge before and it took me 3 tries, but it was so worth it!  Very yummy fudge! My recommendation to all those new to fudge making is to not overboil (I dont have a candy thermometer).  The first time it was a runny mass because I dont think I beat it enough.  It does take awhile to lose it's luster (I'd say at least 5-8 minutes of continuous beating).  The second time it was a dry clump as I over boiled (as soon as it is in the soft ball stage, remove from heat, add ingredients and beat!).  I will definitely be using this recipe again!  YUM!

It set okay, but it was sickening sweet. I suggest upping the cocoa or reducing the sugar.

I can't give this five stars because it's...so...very...hard! As a first time "real fudge" maker, I found the directions a little unspecific and hard to follow. I wish there had been some time estimates listed. Overall, though, this came out really well though! The taste was really good, and though it was hard to make I really enjoyed both making it and the end result. :)

I was craving fudge, never made it before but this recipe was perfect. Easy to find ingredients, just the right sweetness-yield was smaller than expected but that might be a blessing. made about 40 1"x1"x.75" squares. Yummy though.

Excellent fudge! I had never tried making fudge before so I wanted something easy on my first try & this was great. The batch made a perfect amount for our little family with some left over to share. I added 1/2 tsp of mint extract & they tasted almost exactly like Thin Mints.

The nice thing about this recipe is the pure and simple ingredients. It tastes like home-made fudge should taste. 

I followed the recipe exactly except added chopped pecans when it was starting to loose it's sheen.

It is a little difficult to prepare this fudge. Be patient. As other reviewers have mentioned...butter the saucepan before you start. Don't allow any unmelted sugar to get into the mixture once it starts cooking. Be sure it is to the right stage/temp before removeing it from heat and don't stop early on beating time.

This is the exact same recipe that my grandmother has always used.  It was nice finding it online.  Make sure you let the fudge cool to 110 before beating.  I love this recipe and was going to add it but saw it was already here.

I am 60 years old and never made "cooked" fudge as I grew up on the marshmallow kind.  I always liked this type better but was not sure that I could do it.  It is so easy with a good candy thermometer and very good candy.  First batch was great and second batch is on the stove.

Definatly the best tasting fudge ever, however the night after I made it my hands and arms hurt so bad I could hardly get ready for bed and I had nightmares about cooking fudge that night. DO NOT use a double boiler or a small pan, it will take hours to reach the right tempatures, if ever. Use a big thick pan and use all the hints and suggestions in the other reviews, mine turned out perfect the first time. Another tip is to beat it by an open window on a cold day, or in front of the open fridge. This way you wont have to beat it for more than 5-10 minutes tops, although you may have to flatten it in the pan by hand. Yum!

This was my first attempt at making cooked fudge and I was very pleased with the results.  I followed the suggestions of others and made sure I let it cool before adding the butter and vanilla. I didn't have a candy thermometer so don't be afraid to make this if you don't have one either. It was more work than the quick fudges, but worth the "trouble".

This is a delicious recipe.  It wasn't quite as firm as I like, but making perfect old fashioned fudge is a skill that I have yet to master.

I'm giving this a "2 star" because it DOES taste delicious---but I followed the recipe to a "T!" and the 'fudge' never got hard .... it's just really hot fudge ... maybe my family can put on ice cream or something--but I'm disappointed considering the time and effort I spent on this recipe. I was exciting thinking about the yummy fudge I would take to our group's meeting--now I have to rush around and make something ELSE. I don't feel I bit off more than I could chew--I've been baking/cooking ever since I was small. I "get it" and this recipe is NOT THAT complicated, but it IS time-consuming. I just feel very let down. Perhaps will this work for others ... but I only recommend it if you're not planning on actually taking this recipe to a function and are prepared for a failure.

Very good. Just like Real old-fashioned fudge, there is nothing sudle about these. But hard to make. The only problem I had with mine was a little gooey, my fault as I've never made fudge before. I will definitely try again!

This turned out great, very smooth and rich. It is a tie as to which one is better this one or my old one, which I believe came off the  cocoa box. If you're in the mood for no grain fudge this is it. If you like a bit more texture in fudge stick with the one that came off cocoa box. Just my opinion, anyway.

flavor is great, however, I wish I had read the reviews as the directions were lacking more detail.  Did not say to let it cool and then to add the butter and vanilla.  Also, did not say not to stir while boiling it which I had done.  It has not set up the way it should, but hopefully it may soon.  Not quite the texture I was hoping for.

I am so excited to find this recipe!! I wish I could give it more stars. It is so WONDERFUL!! Not quite my Dad's recipe, but so, so good. Thanks to the reviews I read, I might know now what I was doing wrong on my Dad's recipe (stirring it while it boiled), so maybe I can get it to work, but if not, this is awesome!! :-)  Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting it.

This is the same recipe my mom uses for fudge and it is always great.  It's better to make it on a day when the humidity is low and always cook it slowly to the desired temp. You can also add additional flavoring (rum extract, etc) in place of vanilla.

This recipe was handed down from my mother and its a family tradition now. We add about 3 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter making it more peanut butter/chocolate fudge. We also do not use a thermometer. Instead we time a hard boil for 4 minutes. Comes out perfect every time!

this is the first time I've made this fudge and it turned out GREAT.  I didn't even have my candy thermometer to use (broke it last year).  My husband and daugher loved it.  Although how she got 60 pieces out of it I don't know...we like BIG pieces of candy.

I followed it as written, but when it started to bubble I think I lowered it too low. It took a long time to reach 238, actually even when I upped the heat it still never reached there and it smelled a little burnt so after doing the ball test I finally removed it from heat. I didn't stir it or anything just left it to cool. When it was about 120 I added the butter and vanilla and whipped like crazy.It never lost its gloss and after about 5 minutes and a very sore wrist I decided to put it in the foil and see what happened. About 20 minutes later I went back and I had fudge! It actually hardened. Its so rich that just a tiny piece will satisfy. I definately think adding the butter and vanilla after it has cooled helped. I tried making fudge twice before but they never set, so this recipe is a keeper!

This worked GREAT even without a candy thermometer.  First time making fudge, too!  Came out really smooth and rich.  I stirred in the butter when it was about 170 or so because it was getting really thick at that point.  It took almost 40 minutes to get to soft-ball stage.

Oh wow! this fudge was amazing! I made it for my sister who was wanting fudge (craving really, but anyways) and my entire family loved it, even my boyfriend who doesn't normally like fudge! I did have some trouble though; I couldn't get it to reach soft ball stage (likely because my stove is old and enreliable) so I periodically raised the heat, slowly, till it tested done. I waited for it to cool to 120 degrees F then I beat the butter and vanilla into it with a wooden spoon. Poured into pan and pressed down flat with hands and wax paper. Extremely good recipe, will make again!

Another important hint: never ever make this fudge when it is raining! It won't harden.  Somehting about the humidity I guess.

This recipe was terrible. It did not set and I think it was due to the milk. Most traditional fudge recipes do not include milk which hinders the haredening process. I do not recommend this recipe as did the reviewer before me.

This is somewhat similar to my family's traditional fudge recipe.  It's not easy to get the timing perfect, but the end product is immeasurably better than the "quick fudge" recipes filled with chocolate chips or marshmallow cream.

This recipe is great, I love doing things the old fashioned way and after the 2nd try I got this to set, the goo does work well in a cake I made as a filler

This is absolutely Great.  I am not a fan of the "easy" fudge recipes and this tasktes exactly like my Grandmother's old recipe.  I did add pecans to mine and it was great.  Husband and kids loved it!

I was a firt timer but this recipe made me a forever fudge maker. It takes forever to simmer up to the right temp but patience is the key. The taste is delicious and the consistency is perfect. Be ready to stir for at least 5 full minutes or longer at the end for fudge to lose its sheen. I only got 36 pieces out of mine so i would suggest to double batch it if you are using it for an event or something. Thank you Kim C. for the recipe.

I followed directions EXACTLY, but it turned out hard, brittle and tasting like a chocolate-chip. It made a terrible crumbly mess.  Guess I just prefer ordering it from the proffesionals, at least theirs is smooth and creamy!

I'm sure it was great, but I never before had the opportunity to enjoy fudge that wasn't insta-fudge (with confectioner's sugar and marshmallows) so I was unsure what to expect.  Was a little grainy and brittle, but might've been my fault.  It was my first try.  Good flavor.  Took FOREVER to cook though.

I was afraid this would not turn out because all I had was 1% milk, but even that worked!  It did take longer than I expected to have to beat it, and it was initially thinner than I expected, but it did thicken and eventually lost the gloss and did just beautifully!

This is a nice old fashion recipe without all the marshmellow and chip stuff in it.   I had no trouble with mine burning, maybe the lady's burnt because she had it too high or used the wrong type of pot.  The secret is to make sure you beat it long enough after the fudge has boiled.  YUMMY!!!!

This fudge is really good.  It's not too quick to make but after it's done the taste is great.  It takes a long time to get it to the stage where it will harden but it's totally worth it.  My husband loves making it!

This turned out just the way I like it. I'm going to try leaving out the cocoa and adding 3 tablespoons of instant coffee. So I made it!  I also used 1/4 c. Liquid coffee mate, cinnamon and vanilla cream flavor. And reduced Milk to 3/4 c.  It turned out amazing!

I made this twice. The fudge would not thicken. I used candy thermometer and cooked it for 40 min. and still wouldn't get to 138 degrees.

Don't be scared off by reviews saying you can't make this on an electric stove. I've been making fudge for forty years, have won prizes, and have never had a gas stove. If you know your pans and your stove, you'll be fine. You need a good steel pan but even if you don't have a heavy one, you can use a burner trivet (if you don't have one, you can make one out of a wire hanger.) Most electric burners have numbered dials from 1-10. I find that I can bring the mixture to a boil on 5 (takes a bit longer than with a gas stove) and then let it simmer between 3 and 4 and I get perfect, non-grainy fudge every time.  A good candy thermometer is also your friend here, as well as learning how to do the soft ball test in cold water and buttering or oiling the sides of the pan before you begin. Don't let anyone scare you off of trying a recipe just because you don't have a gas range.

This is the first time I've made fudge and it will probably be my last time.  I followed the recipe  exactly as stated.  I've read all of the reviews so I would know what to expect and listen to tips of other fudge makers.  It took forever.  There is nowhere  that states how long this takes.  I even watched the video and they made it look so fast and easy.  The wonders of editing.  They said to use a medium pot.  So I did.  The candy thermometer is to big for a medium pot.  The chocolate mixture kept almost boiling over.  I had my temperature at 4 on an electric stove.  I had to turn it down to 2.  But at 2 the temperature wasn't getting above 225.  So I had to turn it up again.  After about 45 minutes it finally got to the right temperature.  I also kept doing the ball test in the cold water.  Many, many times.  So after about 1 hour I could finally take it off the stove to cool.  I cooled it to the stated temperature that other people suggested.  Then added the other ingredients.  Then began to beat and beat and beat.  I have blisters on my fingers and my hands cramped.  I had to get the hand held electric mixer out.  Wow!  it started to thicken and get less shiny,  and then with my luck the electric mixer burned out.  It couldn't handle it.  So back to mixing with the wooden spoon.  Then I tried a whisk.  It did get very thick but still shiny.  I gave up after mixing for about 45 min.  I dumped it into the pan and spread it out as best I could.

BEST homemade fudge I've ever had! And even beats some fudges I've gotten at specialty shops. I made this recipe exactly how the recipe says and it's so creamy, everyone I gave some to said it was "pure bliss" ! 
This will be my main fudge recipe always!

Easy and delicious. Just like my mom made 50 yrs ago. So many recipes are too complex, extra ingredients and this is simple. Caution tho use a candy thermometer.

I didn't make changes except listening to the video it said to let it cool to 110 degrees. That was a Huge mistake. It wouldn't mix at all. I was very disappointed.

Followed recipe exactly. After stirring for what seemed like forever, I reached the temperature stated. After pouring into the pan the fudge never got hard. Made many easier fudge recipes.

Simmered even boiled this and it did not ever get to 238 degrees.  Need to mention that you need a gas stove for this recipe.  Turned in to a very Thick chocolate syrup and never set up the way it’s supposed to.

This is a good, very sweet fudge, but not as creamy as I had hoped.  Use a large pan because it does expand while cooking.

Well I did everything it said and also read reviews and I let it cool 110 but I think the problem was was when it says to steer until the shine goes away was the mistake because it just started setting and I think you want a little shine in it from the fudge that I remember tasting so good. I should have just stirred it all in till the butter mixed well and then poured in a pan but it wasn't a total failure it was still soft enough to cut but it was kind of crumbly and know shine.

No changes needed, just have to be patient, it takes a while to remove that shine, but that is the secret to great chocolate fudge.

I will definitely make this again. So simple and only 5 basic ingredients. Anyone can make this. Takes a bit to bring to the right temperature to make it "rise". Must hit temp but well worth it.

It tasted phenomenal, but I definitely did something wrong because it didn't set properly. My thermometer was a little finicky, so I'm thinking I didn't hit the proper temps. I beat it for 25 minutes and it never lost its sheen! Definitely trying again though, because the flavor was great. We ate it with spoons!!

I did get very impatient and I did not have a candy thermometer so obviously, it did not turn out as I planned. But even when you don't do it right, it tastes amazing! It has a very very soft texture so it was pretty gooey but my sisters and I scraped it out of the pan. I suggest using the recommended candy thermometer because the guesswork is very difficult and there is a large chance it will not turn out right.

My dad used to make this recipe and he always did the ball roll in cold water to test it. it was delicious. Unfortunately, since he passed away, my sister and I have tried to make this several times, and we very rarely have success.  I tried again last night and I got the firm ball in about 12 minutes, but the fudge never set up. It was very running. About  how long should we cook it after it starts boiling? Any help would be appreciated. I miss this fudge!

I use to have a fudge receipe that always came out spot on. I 've never used white sugar and I really think it changes the flavour quite a bit. The directions are very vague as well. I have no idea how long you are supposed to boil sugar? Etc. It came out grainy and it was like a thick syrup. I beat the xxx out of it for like 25 minutes and never lose the glossy look. A total disaster and a waste of product and time. I really need to find my old recipe.

At a glance, this recipe seemed to require too much sugar for my preference, so I reduced sugar by half.  I also added some pecan nuts. I used an infrared thermometer, and the temperature reading hovered around 60 degrees centigrade (140 degrees F) after simmering the mixture for a while and did not seem to reach 114C or 238F forever. The smell and color of the mixture suggested it had been simmered enough, however. Thinking that the temperature inside the mixture was higher than its surface temperature measured, I took my pan off heat. Although I didn't wait till the temperature came down to 114F or 45F before adding butter, what resulted had appropriate consistency, looked like what is shown in the video, and tasted great.
When I made this for the second time, I replaced butter by cacao butter to see what would result. Well, I ended up with something more like chocolate mousse than fudge.

I finally was able to make my fudge turn out by using this recipe!  I've made a few unsuccessful attempts with another, but all the tips made this a very helpful, delicious recipe.  I buttered the pan and made sure to keep my spoon out of it after it came to a boil (while it was simmering).   I live at a very high altitude and found 221 F was the right temperature to take the pot off the burner.  I only had to stir for 8 or 9 minutes and the fudge nearly set in the pan.  
It was a tad too rich for me and I'm guessing it was the cocoa.  I will be trying it with cream to see if that helps balance the strong cocoa flavor.  Or maybe I'll substitute some unsweetened chocolate for the cocoa.  But overall, we loved the recipe!

I simmered it for  over  40 min.. Maybe I don't know what simmer means.... better stated would be "reduce to low boil"?  Did the drop in water roll into ball, flatten thing...  So yeah, ended up with really good hot fudge!  ;)

This was soooo good!  I changed it a little - I used half-and-half instead of milk, I doubled the recipe, and I used coffee for half the liquid. I thought it was NEVER going to get to 238 degrees, and when it did, I was scared it wasn’t really ready because it was so liquidy. But I poured it into my dish, and what was left in the pot was hardening right up, and once it was cool, it was the most delicious “mocha” fudge ever!  Love love love!

I used heavy cream in place of the milk, and 1/2 cup of the sugar was brown sugar because I realized I didn't have enough white sugar. I also mixed in a package of chocolate chips with the butter.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  I ended up with soup.

I repeated the cooking process, I ended up with soup again.

I  boiled the heck out of this stuff for over 10 minutes, and I still got soup.

Somethings missing from this recipe or the cooking instructions are not correct.

I love Hershey's cocoa fudge more than any candy or dessert.  This recipe is very similar to the old one I remember as a kid.  I've made both with successes and failures, but i do think this one works better...I've now made this one 3 times and the ingredients are the same, just different measurements, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  This one uses 2 cups sugar instead of 3, one half cup cocoa instead of 3/4, still plenty rich chocolate cocoa love,  1 cup milk instead of 1.5, and half stick butter instead of whole stick.  Still cooks great and spreads out nicely in a 8x8  buttered pan.  I use a 10 inch non-stick skillet on a 10 inch electric stove eye, it cooks evenly, and let it get to 238F on candy thermometer, takes mine between 15-20 min, then add butter, vanilla, nuts, and set on rack to cool to almost room temp, then beat and it's excellent!!!!  Thank you for this recipe.

I made this fudge last Christmas(2017) to give with other assorted sweets gifts. 
I made several batches last year. In one batch I added 1/4 of a bag of cinnamon chips to the recipe. They were very well liked.  
I am using this recipe again this year.
Also....it is the easiest fudge Ive ever made and 
I don like fudge made with marshmallows.
Thank you,
Cynthia Carpenter

This is just like the fudge my dad used to make when I was a kid, and brings back great memories. Thanks for the super recipe!

One thing: Make sure you use a tall pot, since mine bubbled up so much I had to change pots mid-way through cooking.

Turned out good but after I removed from heat and added vanilla and butter I let cool down to about 120 degrees before stirring. Don't know if I needed to but the I was taught.

The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because it is more difficult to make. I did not concern myself with oiling the sides of the pans, etc and being over the top about sugar crystals. I just followed to recipe to see how it would go. The one thing I did do though, is wait until it cooled to around 110 degrees before adding butter, vanilla and stirring. I was pretty wimpy stirring and thought if its grainy then I didnt want to put all the work into stirring it, so I used a blender. Not such a great idea. I mixed it too much and it became a firm mass. Lesson learned. Although I do think it would have turned out fine if I had done it by hand. Definitely a different, richer flavor than the marshmallow fudges and a good recipe because of the simple ingredients. However, my personal preference is to take the easier route and less finicky recipe and go with the marshmallow ones. I will definitely try this one again though.  Thanks!

This recipe is anything but easy. I made 3 batches and all three  turned out disastrous will never try this one again. The first one never solidified, second one turned to a gelatinous mess, third one is so dry it is like sand. The directions to this fudge is misleading and awful. The video for preparing this is also misleading.

I always make my "famous" peanut butter fudge for the holidays and decided to add a chocolate fudge too. I picked this recipe and really liked the taste and texture. I think the directions should include the length of time it should take to reach the temperature of 238 after coming to a boil. I thought I had overcooked but it finally reached temp and came out great,

My mom has made a variation of this recipe to frost birthday cakes since I was a young child. I love this stuff. I’m not sure if her recipe calls for the butter though, so I might cut or eliminate the butter next time. I’d probably also add a little salt.

My husband does not like the kind of fudge made with marshmallows and chocolate chips so I thought I would give this recipe a try,  it came out perfect.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, I did add about a half a teaspoon of salt with the chocolate and sugar and I followed the advice of others by letting it just sit and cool till it reached about  110 degrees...I will say the stirring process is killer on your arms..I will make this again for my husband but everyone else is getting marshmallows and chocolate chips, good chocolate chips, but still....my arms are tired...lol

First time making fudge and it was a big hit at the office. I incorporated a few tips from a blog post, namely that I let the mixture cool for about 20 minutes before beating in the butter and vanilla. I didn't have a candy thermometer so relied on the soft ball method. This fudge was so smooth that my colleagues commented it almost tasted like a brownie.

I have tried this twice and followed the directions as well as the tip to let it cool to 110 degrees.  It took forever and never set well and the taste is just ok.  The texture is closer to a very stiff frosting making it hard to cut.  Not trying it a third time!

I onlt gave this 4 outta 5 stars because I had to rely on so many user comments for extra tips to get this recipe to turn out. That being said,  this is an awesome recipe!!! It's just like what we made when I was a young girl. Gas stoves,  and candy thermometers are always great for even cooking,  but this recipe can be made on an electric range using the softball method no problemo. It's all about elbow grease,  and timing. That is all we had growing up,  and with some practice I managed to crank out a praiseworthy batch reminiscent of my past.  Thanks,  for sharing this. I look forward to smearing some coconut mixture between two layers of this,  and topping with almonds for an "almond joy" variation.  Yummy!

Very easy recipe. I substituted erythritol for sugar and cut back the amount to 1.25 C.  I  sprinkled the top with powdered Swerve and they were a hit.

This is also a great hot fudge topping recipe for ice cream if you don't cook it so long. Depending on how long you cook it, it will form a shell on the ice cream. The longer you cook it, the harder it will get when poured over the ice cream. When making it for  2 people,  use Tablespoons instead of cups and double it. You can also cook in microwave around a minute and a half to just under 2 minutes,  depending on your wattage. Great hot fudge topping! Been one of my children's and grands  favorites for 40+ years.

I made this exact same recipe 2 times over and both of them did NOT work out at all.. this recipe should explain more details on what needs to be done.. I attempted this 2 times and Messed it up both times kind of makes me mad knowing I waisted all that milk and sugar for nothing.. .( edit I made this 3 ties now and same exact result! )

I was flying blind, so to speak, when I decided to make this fudge. I wanted true old fashioned fudge and I think this was it. I didn’t think it would turn out at all and I’m glad I didn’t read the reviews because they would have scared me away from this, but I forged on and this was the best fudge I’ve had in years. I just followed the directions. Beginner’s luck? Maybe! Oh, I did add pecans.

I grew up on this cocoa fudge & as far as I am concerned it is the only chocolate fudge worth making. None of the other recipes comes close, especially the marshmallow cream fudge. It is very tricky to make. The one tip I have is be sure you do not scrape the sides of the pot when pouring it out or you will get sugar crystals in the batch.

Made it on an electric stove...just kept adjusting the heat as needed. Used Taylor Candy Thermometer and mark on thermometer marked "Soft ball stage' was perfect.  It set up perfect. I am adding a bit more butter next time and I might have some fun with various kinds of cocoa powder. This time we used Scharfenberger so it is gooood!

Disappointed to see that it didn't turn out for everyone. I took the suggestion of another reviewer to wait to until the mixture cooled to 115F before stirring in the butter and vanilla, and the consistency came out perfectly! although it all but set in the pan. I didn't even bother smoothing it out.

It would help if you told us to boil it until the ball test works. i was very confused and messed it up the first time because i have never made fudge before. maybe adding that in would help people like me. i had to look at someone else making fudge to be sure what i did wrong.  but i did fixnit and it is delicious

I had made it for my Chemistry Honors class and my group had added mini chocolate chips, and this of course, did not change the outcome besides making it a lot sweeter. If you follow the recipe you should have no problems. I would definitely make it again.

Probably the best fudge I ever made. And so simple!!! Mine was soft and kinda sticky when it was cooled but I liked the texture. Maybe I did something wrong? Either way... AMAZING.

I halfed this recipe and followed the directions as written. I added 1/2 cup of walnuts. The fudge was fabulous. I have never liked fudge, but this was amazing. My husband loved the fudge and he is the connoisseur.

Can you say SWEET? Where did you find this recipe, on the back of a cereal box or something? My only other problem was that I refrigerated the fudge overnight, and at 9:00 the next morning, it was more like pudding. I liked the coloring though.

I have made this twice and it never turns out like I see in the video. I beat it until my arm is ready to fall off and it still doesn't become solid. I'll not waste my time with this recipe again.

I attempted to make this recipe twice and neither time did it come out right. The first time I made I thought maybe I didn't get it to a rolling boil good enough because it wouldn't thicken and it never hardened once poured. The 2nd time I made sure that it was a pure rolling boil and then put the candy thermometer in and brought it to 240° still runny and wouldn't harden. I can not chance wasting more  sugar,  cocoa & milk for it to work.

Growing up Mom made this fudge all the time, we hovered like rabid dogs until it was done. When she came down with cancer last year it was one of the recipes we touched on, I never knew her recipe came from the Hershey cocoa can. She was too sick at the time to show me how to make it :(.  I can’t find it on the Hershey site so I found this one. I don’t remember her beating it so much to cool it,and she usually made it with peanut butter. So tonight I tried my hand at it. The first batch burned and boy was that a hot mess. I was much more careful with the second one and so far so good, it’s setting now and tastes similar to Moms. I used canned milk (she always did) on the first batch and I’m wondering if that is why it burned? Can I use canned with this recipe? Also, it seems grainy using whole milk, is it supposed to be like that? Tomorrow I will try it with peanut butter and canned milk.

I made it exactly like the recipe said.  It took a LOOONG time for it to come up to 238 degrees at a simmer.  I am just licking the pan now and it is very good. Will be anxious to try it after it has set up and cooled.   Bottom of the pan got somewhat cooked on but will come off when soaked I'm sure

Wonderful old recipe!  Be sure to use whole milk, good quality cocoa, and real butter, if you want it to have that good, old-fashioned fudge flavor.  Remember, when Grandma made it, she probably didn't use skim or lowfat, and butter 'spreads' weren't even around.  An occasional 'splurge' on real foods is a good thing.  Enjoy!

This recipe worked out great! I didn't have a candy thermometer and used the suggestion of the cold water drop and it worked out perfectly! I made a second batch and added 1/3 cup of peanut butter in the final stage along with the butter and vanilla and it tasted wonderful! Thank you!!

Not sure what I did wrong. I used a thermometer, let it cool to 110, added the butter, and beat with a spoon. I ended up with fudge powder and not fudge :-(

Any ideas on what I did wrong?

OMG! Perfect for a first time fudge maker. My hubby loves it, it's not too rich. I added walnuts. Awesome!
Be patient when allowing to simmer and reach correct temperature. It's key.

I followed directions but with an electric stovetop not sure it got to temp , and it was taking so long I think it acquired a burnt taste. Hoping it will set up.

First of all, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The only thing I did differently was I used a hand mixer instead of beating it with a wooden spoon.  It turned out perfectly and in spite of what one reviewer posted, I used an electric stove.  The key to this fudge is to use a good candy thermometer to get it to a perfect soft ball stage.  I used the mixer simply because I'm getting over a rotator cuff injury in my shoulder.  I mixed it on low for about ten minutes.  I think this actually worked better because the fudge didn't turn out grainy or dry.  When you first put it in your 8 x 8 pan it's going to feel a little sticky.  This is normal.  I put the pan in my refrigerator and it set up perfectly.  The flavor is rich and chocolatey and it reminds me of the fudge my mother made for Christmas when I was a little girl.  I can't wait to make a couple of batches for my family this year.   So many people are afraid to try  making fudge or any other type of candy.  A lot of other people like to make it sound like it's impossible to make unless you're a professional.  This isn't true.  Just take your time, follow the recipe, and have fun.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

The taste of this fudge is sooooo good. I messed it up like I do with most fudge I attempt haha this was my first try at chocolate fudge, and using a candy thermometer. I did not follow instructions thoroughly (tried following reviewers) and not using proper pan, so it's really my fault. But the taste is great which is how I know that it can be great when done correctly. I beat it until I couldn't no more, my hands are sore haha. Next attempt at making chocolate fudge, will likely be using this recipe and following insctructions better. Thanks!

Thanks! Great recipe! I added my peanut butter cup filling while it was still warm. Simple and easy. Allergy free: I tried Carob with earth balance soy free and rice milk. It didn't turn out like fudge more like thick syrup, which went great with rice chex cereal! I will try and use the fatty coconut milk next time and let it simmer alot longer.  For the sub on peanut butter I'll use Sunbutter.

First time making this, was a little intimated after reading some of  the notes but it was a pretty simple recipe. I followed one note and used 3 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup of butter (1/4 in main batch, 1/4 added with vanilla) and 1 tbsp of corn syrup (added just before it starts to boil). Started mixing once it started heating and didn't stop until I poured it into my silicone 8x8" pan. Skipped cool-down period entirely. I made this on an electric stove without any problem, have a good Thermapen for taking temps, heated it to 240 on medium-high and immediately off of heat once it hit 240. Used a very high non-stick saucepan, mixed with a wooden spoon, scraped it out with a silicone spatula, very little stuck in the pan.

It isn't exactly the "fudge" I was thinking of, but it is good and very chocolately (I used Hershey's Dutch process dark chocolate powder). Reminds me of hot-fudge frosting from a can or ice-cream topping. Good comments from everyone.

I'll probably drop the recipe down to 2 cups of sugar and try more milk or heavy cream. Thanks for sharing.

Perfect. Although, the stove top candy method, which this recipe uses is laborious compared to the "pop in microwave, and transfer to the fridge and an hour later, done" method. You need to keep an eye out on the mixture turning into candy, and have patience. However, it does make absolutely wonderful, old fashioned fudge.

I made it exactly the way it is written and it came out just like the fudge my mother made in the 50's and 60's.  Perfect. However, I used very fine sugar or Baker's sugar (NOT confectioner) and it was a real blessing. No sugar feeling just pure creamy fudge. My mother would have been so proud of me, she tried to teach me for years and it never came out, not even once.  She passed in Dec 2016 and she must be helping me from up above.  Thank You so much for the recipe.

I've made this recipe several times now and for some reason the results are slightly different each time. I think I have finally figured out how to make it the right texture. So, for all those attempting this recipe, here are the tips I found useful. First off, I found 8 x 8 to be slightly too big as fudge comes out too thin. 7x7 works better in my opinion. To avoid getting sugar crystals, as soon as the boiling mixture reaches 237°, I wipe down one side and using the clean side, pour the mixture straight on top of butter that's sitting in a bowl that's in another bowl of ice cold water.  Put vanilla on top. Wait about 10-15 min without touching it at all, then, using my hand held electric mixer beat it for around 2.5 min, until its sort of not liquid anymore, I'd say it starts to look like beaten eggs just after they start forming soft peaks. As soon as that's done, pour into prepared pan. You literally have 60 seconds here before the fudge sets so work quickly.

Followed the instructions exactly, and made 0 changes. I did not have a candy thermometer on hand and used the cold water test instead (which I googled for a while and watched videos on to make sure I did it correctly). 

Pretty good, the fudge was very smooth and 'melt-in-your-mouth', but pretty chocolatey. It also ended up being *very* soft, so that it was more like taffy instead. I whipped it for about 15 minutes with a spoon and let it set 24+ hours in the fridge. 

Might make again, but I would use less chocolate and cook it longer, and probably use a thermometer to be more exact.

Recipe was OK, But don't trust the "savings" I went to Walgreens for the sugar on sale.  Manager said they never received any of the sugar shown in the ad, and didn't know if they would ever get it.  He said the company's runs many ads  and never ships the product to the store.

In all fairness, I'm a newby with fudge so I'll take some fault for the outcome. I followed directions exactly to the letter. When the fudge soup cooled to 115 I stirred in the butter and vanilla; the whole thing seized and hardened rapidly- too rapidly. I had to take a chopper out and chop the mass into pieces add milk and reheat. I'll try it again and if anyone can identify what I did wrong, please let me know. I stopped stirring when it boiled; turned the heat to 4 and let it heat until two degrees from 238 and took it off the heat and cooled it. then I transferred it to mix the butter and vanilla. Nuts were added last. The taste was perfect but the texture was rock hard.

I wouldn't say old-fashioned fudge is easy to make. Maybe it's easy if you're familiar with it. My mom made it when I was a kid; homemade fudge on a Friday or Saturday night was such a treat! Because of watching her make it as I grew up, I have always been familiar with the process. Even still it can be difficult; even my mom screws up the fudge sometimes. That said, this is the best-tasting fudge recipe in my opinion. I like the foolproof ones too, but, in my mind, this kind of fudge will always be real fudge. I always add some peanut butter to the recipe because it tastes good and you don't have to beat the fudge as long.

This is a wonderful fudge. My Grandmother taught me how to make candy using the water test (I don't use or need a candy thermometer). Making any kind of candy takes practice and patience. I am currently teaching my girls the ART of candy making. Thank you for sharing! It's a keeper

Great results but took forever... next time I will not lower the temp too much because it took over an hour to reach 240. I used the ingredients listed in Jackie' s review (Hershey' s tin) and I only had Hershey' s Special dark cocoa (I think regular would be better). I also added 1Tblspn of corn syrup @ the advice of cindy. At the end,  I added toasted walnuts and it was delicious. 
I also took the advice of Wert23 and added a cup of milk to the dirty chocolate pot and she was absolutely right...it was thee best cup of hot chocolate ever. Yummy!!

I would recommend a pot that is larger than 3 qt and not a "medium saucepan."  On simmer the mixture grows and will go over the edge of a pot that is too small. 

I'll either have delicious fudge or great ice cream sauce. Stirring until the sheen disappears...how long is that? It seemed like 15 minutes.

The heat on the thermometer never went past 180 even after 45 mins of simmering.  Finally I tried a soft-ball test and it was soft-ball, and more firm even (I should've tried sooner but was relying on the thermometer) so even though the temperature was still 180 it was obviously done.  I let it cool to 110 before touching it. As soon as I added the butter and vanilla and started stirring, it lost it's sheen super fast (like less than one minute) and then almost immediately after it  turned to an almost powder-like solid consistency, like flash crystallization.

The good side is that I used the runny fudge mixture that I tried making twice into hot fudge for ice cream.  I had enough small jars to give out to friends.  The bad side is that I ran out of ingredients and couldn't make fudge from my old tried and true recipe.  Really recommend the hints that are in the reviews be added to the recipe itself.

I've never made fudge before. The first time I made it, it did not set properly. This is probably because I did not have a candy thermostat and did not know how to fathom the soft ball stage  and had not discovered the fact that there's  video attached (Yeah! some of us are a little slow). The reviews and the video really helped in making the second batch a perfection (still without the thermostat!! So thank you for posting the recipe and the rest of you for the excellent insight into technique!

Not sure what I'm doing wrong. Won't set up. Re-heated it and started again. Cooled to 110 and again Mixed with a wooden spoon for almost 20 min. Put it in the refrigerator for over an hour
 Still won't set :/ I can use it as a drizzle or chocolate syrup, so not a total loss I guess. Still gave it a decent rating because I'm sure it's me, not the recipe :)

My mom was wanting this for Christmas. She was like fudge is impossible to make. So everyone (herself included) has gone to the marshmallow kind and it isn't as good. I decided to make it for her and found this recipe. Thanks to good recipe and great advice in the reviews this first time fudge maker made 2 (not 1) perfect batches. My mom was amazed and thrilled! Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper.

This is not a review cause I haven't made it yet.  Just wondering if this a little crunchy, or is it the creamy soft kind of fudge you get in the Fudge shops?   I don't like mine soft, but have never seen a recipe or found fudge that is the old fashioned crunchy kind that my mom made.

I was looking for a basic boiled fudge recipe from the old days, don't like the marshmallow. I haven't made it for years so of course made a mistake. I stirred it the whole time instead of what the recipe called for, which was not to stir once it was boiling. It boiled forever, and when I thought it had to be ready and it actually did reach a soft ball stage I poured it out. I knew immediately I did something wrong. I am sick. I made a double batch for Christmas. I did put a bunch of walnuts in it and am praying the consistency will harden as it is in the fridge. Good recipe, though. :)

Look at the first highest reviews for tips. The biggest problem we had was we didn't stir it long enough. We ended up needing to beat it with an electric mixer for 10+ minutes for the shine to actually go away and for the fudge to actually set.

fantastic recipe. so simple, and i didn't have to go and buy any ingredients, all basic staples i keep at home. i love the fact that you can swap over the milk and butter to make it vegan if need be. the texture was perfect, although i might add a little more cocoa to make it less sweet next time :)

This did not work at all. For some reason it didn't harden. I now have a whole ton of chocolate syrup on my hands. I don't blame the recipe though. I am sure I just did something wrong.

At first, I was really skeptical.  I boiled/simmered the mixture for a long time, mixing constantly, and it seemed to never get to the soft ball stage.  I eventually just turned it off and added the butter and vanilla.  After stirring it for 15 minutes, it eventually got thick and set up nicely.  It turned out to be really delicious and creamy, and the sugar gave it a little bit of grit (which I like).  I made it last night and it's nearly gone now! Very good.

Really rich and delicious. I would recommend a thermometer for sure. Mine set as I was pouring it because I wasn't sure what I was looking for with "sheen." Next time, I know! Great old school fudge.

best fudge recipe i found so far, however i do not cool it down after it reaches temp. i remove from heat add vanilla and butter and stir stir stir until it looks like it wants to set up if i dont stir a min. i also dont grease my pan i use parchment paper, pour on top and let cool down to cut. It disappears quick in my house:)

I hadn't made this old fashioned Hershey's cocoa fudge for years.  I had forgotten just how absolutely delicious it is.  You must know it is going to take some time and you can't hurry this fudge.  It still has the best flavor and truly melts in your mouth.  Follow the recipe as is and you will enjoy some tasty fudge.  I did add one half cup of chopped walnuts.

I did not care for this recipe. It made no sense to me to reduce to simmer during the boil but I went ahead and followed the directions and all it did was lose too much heat and then at the simmer it was on the heat too long and burnt in the pan. I'll stick to Hershey's recipe.

I cooked this using my candy thermometer to 238 degrees.  I let it cool to about 160 degrees before adding the butter and vanilla.  After adding the butter it lost it's sheen in about 1 minute and got really crumbly.  I have pressed it into the pan and I'm hoping once it cools I can possibly cut it.  I was really hoping this would come out good because I am making goodie trays for work.  This one will not be going into the trays.  I will stick to another no fail recipe I have.

The taste is great and double the ingredients would make this a favorite. Pretty thin, and I don't see 60 squares coming out of it.

Im goin to be makin this fudge for the first time this week. I remember when I was little watching my grandma make it every year. I remember she always buttered the plate she poured on & I couldnt hardly wait for it to set so I could have some. Im hopin mine will turn out just as good as hers always did. I even have the big pot she used to make it in so how can it go wrong. lol

This is my all time favorite fudge! It does take precise timing to turn out just right! Its been our family recipe for years! At least the original Hersheys cocoa one is. No better fudge!! I use an electric mixer instead of spoon, works faster!

My mom made this fudge since I was little. I love it. She adds a bit of peanut butter with the butter and vanilla. She used smooth. I use chunky. It does take patience and a candy thermometer is really useful. This always reminds of evenings with my mom when I would visit her on weekends after I was grown and gone. She got the recipe from the Hershey tin of cocoa.

I made this last night and let me say OMG !! It just melts in your mouth . It took me almost an hour of cooking it I don't have a candy  thermometer  It says to not stir but I stired it the whole time but I used a wire whisk to stir. It does not make very much .I got a thin layer of an 8 x8 square pan . I WILL be making this again and hope it will turn out as good as this batch !!!

Great! Traditional fudge. Substituted unsweetened almond milk and it turned out perfect. Electric stove simmer setting would never have reached 238, so upped it a bit and waited. Took some time, but totally worth it. Makes for a nice gift. Thanks!

this recipe i have used since i was young and it came from my Grandmother she taught my mom and mom taught me but one thing i have not read on here is that when you are making this Fudge is it wont make when it is cloudy or rainy i have tried to make it at any time and if it isnt dry it wont set up no matter what i have done but it is the best Fudge you can ever eat. I dont know where my Grandmother got the recipe but i was so glad she did i have enjoy making it and i give it out for Christmas present evey year i mix it with no bake cookies.

Just made this recipe... have never made fudge like this before, and did not have a candy thermometer, but it turned out great! Just used the soft ball test (maybe tried 4 times before it stuck together in a ball instead of dissolving into the water). Let it cool about 10-15 minutes and then beat with a wooden spoon for about 8 minutes and it lost its sheen and set! Spread it into the pan...had to do this quickly before it hardened up (which happened very rapidly). Hoping it will taste as great as all the reviews claim!

I made this recipe tonight, and I admit that I did it twice.  Failed the first time, because I took it off the heat a little bit premature...I was convinced my candy thermometer was broken.  Second time, the recipe came out perfect.  It is delicious, and was very easy :)

I lost my recipe, so glad I found it. I used to make it a lot it would be creamy as butter. I cooked the butter with everything else.

I tried this and it hasn't quite set yet, so I have my fingers crossed.  I added raisins and a 2 tbsp. of maple syrup, topped it off with unsweetened coconut flakes and a scintilla of powered sugar.  The mixture tastes great, and if it doesn't set properly, I'll try again!  Very happy that I found this recipe and practicing now before the holidays!  Thank you for this recipe and thanks to everyone for all your helpful tips.

This recipe is so easy. I  have  made it twice now 1st time with nuts 2nd  time no nuts. I used a candy thermomoter.Followed the recipe to the letter. Turned out perfect. I don't like fudge that melts in your hand because it is so creamy. This is the perfect fudge for  me.

My mom made this when I was a kid.  Like another reviewer said, it is similar to the one that used to be on Hershey's cocoa; the difference is the qty. of each ingredient.  This is the only fudge there is, in my opinion.  It is truly a treat!  Might take a little longer to make, but it is WORTH it.

maybe it's just me but this did not yield a lot of fudge at all. it wouldn't even cover the bottom of the pan. so maybe in the photographs people doubled or tripled the recipe? i'm also not sure how you would get sixty squares from this. it is good though.

Fab, the third time I made it I felt brave enough to deviate from the recipe and throw in a handful of chopped white chocolate at the end with the butter. It gives a milky lighter taste and a more "fudge-like" colour.

This was my first attempt at making "real" fudge. It was good but it was a little soft (probrably my fault). NExt time I think I will stir it longer. It tasted REALLY GOOD

Very good fudge and excellent directions.  I thought I was going to have to stir a long time at the end and couldn't believe how quickly it set up.      Beginners do not be afraid to try this recipe.

Another failure.  We good chocolate sauce but nothing close to solid.    Skip this one unless if you want fudge topping for ice cream.

Excellent!  This is the first time I have ever made fudge that worked.  Thank you for this recipe.  It was a big hit by everyone.  I will make this now every year.

I have been making this fudge for years, like many, it is on the hershey tin.  My father use to make this when I was a kid.  I have an electric stove/range and have never noticed any difference between using a gas stove.

this was great. Had to make fudge for a stock show. The recipe that we got from teacher was a flop and didn't have very good directions. We found this one and turned out great, second time trying to make fudge. We didn't have a candy thermometer, couldn't find it so the other reviews were a great help.

Didn't work out for me. It isn't an "easy" recipe... it is a "classic."

As I was beating, and looking for the sheen to disappear, it suddenly turned to a hard dry mess. 

I am going to throw away old cheap candy thermometer and look for an easier to make fudge recipe.

This is a wonderful treat. Bit too sweet though. But I guess without that sweetness it wouldn't be just right.
Anyway I'm thinking of using this as a layer for a chocolate or a vanilla cake. Would be lovely. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  I received several compliments from others at a gathering I brought this fudge to.  I was given a recipe very similar to this one, with the same ingredients but in different amounts, and I couldn't get it right.  I had no problem at all with this one, and without a candy thermometer.  Definitely a keeper!

I loved this fudge!  I'd never made fudge before, and this worked great.  I would say that it's not for an inexperienced sugar cook though - it requires some skill to keep it from becoming grainy.

This is just like my gramma makes it! I'd much rather have this that the gooey fudge made with marshmallow creme. Yeah, it's good, but this stuff is solid and still melts in your mouth. Thanks!

Excellent taste.. Although it did'nt firm up even after SEVERAL minutes of beating. I followed the recipe to a T. I would suggest this however, it would be great for those who get it to firm. I used no-name Premium Cocoa.I will try this recipe again.

This fudge is delicious!It was the first time I ever made fudge and it turned out great! Its the easiest thing in the world =D !! The reason I gave it a 4 is that it burned my pan and some of the mixture was all burnt on the bottum =( and it wouldn't come off. But it is still great, I just don't know were I went wrong and how it burnt my pan!

The ingredients were great and easy, they were just around the house.  It didnt really take anytime to make and it was so worth it! They were so good and rich of chocolate.

I gave it 4 stars because I do not believe that it was "THE BEST" but this recipe is really really GREAT! If you like more of the candy type fudge...this is the recipe for you! I definately satisfied my fudge craving :)

I wish I had seen the reviews first, because I think I stirred in the butter and vanilla too soon, and I don't know much about candy cooking.  I used my thermometer, but it came out kind of crumbly.  It tastes okay, like chocolate, but the consistency is strange.  But, I didn't have chocolate chips on hand so thought I'd give this a try.  At least it will satisfy a chocolate craving!

I had no luck with this recipe.  I could never get it to set-up. I did everything to the letter and beat and beat and beat with a wooden spoon.  I'm sure it is something I did wrong since everyone else is having so much luck with it.  I wish it had come out for me since I dont like marshmellow creme in my fudge.

Mine didn't turn out.  It acted like it was going to but didn't.  I am new at the fudgemaking so that could have been my problem.  It was VERY delicious though!  Ended up making the best fudge icing for a cake I made so I didn't waste it!!

I have been looking for years for a fudge recipe we used to cook from the Cordon Bleu cooking magazines when I was a child, and I think this is it!! I remember that it would often fail, but when it did work, it was sublime. Chocolate fudge made to any other recipe (even from a shop) is not quite chocolate fudge to me.

My friend and I made this recipe last night, and it was definitely yummy!  We halved the recipe , which made it rather thin, but with a frozen raspberry or blueberry on top is was delicious!  Will definitely keep the recipe in mind, especially as it calls for ingredients that are normally in my house.
