Amazingly delicious! My family raved about this meal that is full of flavor from every angle. I used Johnsonville Brats and 3 lbs. red potatoes unpeeled. Although the gravy is thin it is very rich and soaks into the potatoes in a delightful way!

This was my first time having Bangers & Mash. It wasn't bad, especially the gravy, but a little too time consuming as written for a simple meal. I would suggest getting the potatoes on the stove first, then brown the sausage, put it in the oven, sautee the onions and start reducing the gravy before mashing the potatoes. Also, it took me at least half an hour to boil the gravy down by half, probably because of the humidity here in Florida. I turned on the A/C to draw some of the moisture out of the air and it seemed to help speed things up. The potatoes seemed a little dry as is, so I tossed in another splash of milk. Adding a splash of beef broth to the potatoes might not be bad, either.

My husband wanted a traditional Irish meal for St Patrick's day, and said this was the best version of Bangers and Mash he has had! Great flavor, and the sauce was awesome..a little on the thin side so I added some cornstarch to it to help thicken it up just a bit. Will definately be serving this on more than just St Patrick's day

I've never had Bangers and Mash, so when I ran across this recipe then I knew I had to try it! The red wine sauce is absolutely delicious, but as stated it is a thin gravy. I like mine thick and there was no problem to thicken it up. I used a bratwurst and although it was still good, next time I will try a different sausage. Maybe something like Kielbasa, as I think it would compliment the onion gravy nicely. Of course the choice of sausage is down to preference. No complaints about the mash. I love mashed potatoes and I've never tried adding mustard powder. It gave it a nice little kick! I don't really understand the reviews that say this recipe is time consuming. The most time consuming part is the mash, which takes about 20 minutes to make. I just left the gravy on to simmer while the potatoes were boiling. In under 30 minutes, I had a meal on the table. It doesn't seem like much time to me! I served it with fried cabbage, which rounded it out nicely. This is not a fancy meal, but I'm very happy that I tried it. This is one of those heart warming comfort foods which I will definitely make again and again! Thanks for the great recipe wsf!

Giving this recipe five stars, even though I made a slight change to save time. I lived in England for a while, and this recipe is PERFECT!!! It's everything I remembered. My change in the timing was to cook the sausage first, then get the onions cooking in the sausage juices while I started the potatoes boiling. Also, to save time on cooking down the gravy, I added 6 cups worth of beef bouillon, but I halved the water and the wine. This made it cook down much faster so that it was ready when the sausages came out of the oven and the potatoes were done. AWESOME RECIPE!!!

I'm afraid that the way I made this wasn't exactly traditional, but I had to use what I had and stick to my low-carb diet.  I used whipped cauliflower instead of potatoes and butter-flavored pan spray for the mash, but did add the mustard.  Also I used fresh chicken sausage instead of pork.  Even with the changes this came out great.  I can't wait to get skinny and make it the way it's written.  I just returned from England and didn't meet a sausage I didn't like.  Hence the return to the diet.  This was an excellent recipe, thanks for the post.

Loved it! Soooo good and so easy to make.  First time to ever eat an Irish Banger (bought mine at Trader Joe's).  The broth was soooo flavorful. I baked french loaves to eat the sausages in & sauted cabbage to go along with this meal and cooked few slices of bacon til crispy to put atop the mash along with the onion gravy. YUM!

My husband and I loved this dinner, I only wish I had steamed some cabbage to go with it. My very american and very picky daughters wouldn't eat it, but thats not the food, thats the kids. I also thickened the gravy, after the 10 minutes to cook it down I noticed it was as described and a bit too thin for my taste. I only added about 3T of flour to slightly thicken. Two cups of wine for the gravy, 4 cups of wine for the cook....Thats the way to do it!

So I've made this twice and this is what I have liked so far. I just used the gravy recipe and put it on mashed potatoes! Excellent! I made my own beef broth, 3 boullion cubes in warm water. I also followed another reviewer and added a half cup of cold water mixed with corn starch (the more starch the thicker the gravy) I used about3 heaping tblsp. And for the wine I used one called "red"  which left a very nice bold flavor. I let all that boil On high heat only stirring a COUPLE times . It took about 30 minutes for it to decease to half its volume. But EXCELLENT BROWN GRAVY!

I just made this tonight, and it was absolutely delicious!

Next time, though, I'm going to halve the gravy.  After giving my 4 servings a generous coating, I still had a good sized bowl of gravy left over.

Used pendleton bratwurst, amazingly simple and bland, but that lets the mild flavors shine.  not something we would eat every night, but a great change of pace and inexpensive meal.

First time trying bangers and mash, and I am glad I came across this recipe. the wine is a great addition to a traditional beef broth based gravy. I also added some thinly sliced red pepper with the onions for a little added color. Make sure you do cook down the wine well so it does not overwhelm the flavors. I put the bangers back in the pan with the onions and juices to heat up. Served it hot with the mashed potatoes, with some cubed up Kerrygold cheese on the side. Since my family appreciates veggies, I made some roasted brussel sprouts for a side dish. Awesome recipe, great way to celebrate St. Patrick's Day week, even though I am Italian, we are all Irish on St. Patty's Day! Can't forget a nice cold beer with the meal!

EXCELLENT! I only used one cup of wine, and thought that was plenty for us. I did thicken the gravy slightly, but that was my own preference. Next time, I will halve the gravy b/c I had a TON leftover. After the gravy was done, I just threw the cooked sausages in to soak in the delicious juices. As for the potatoes, I used all the ingredients, but didn't measure anything, just did it all to taste. I will absolutely be making this over and over...a hearty, delicious meal! Thanks for sharing. :)

Sauce was good. Made a lot though and took a while to reduce. Would use a pan next time. I personally did not like dry mustard in the potatoes. Would leave that out next time.

I made this last night along with bean and bacon soup to honor my British heritage.  Everyone loved it!  I made two minor changes to the recipe though:
-I thickened the gravy after reducing it by adding a cornstarch slurry with 1/2 cup each of cornstarch and water
-I used julienned onions instead of diced.

SOooo yummy! I didn’t have red wine, so used 2 cups of water with two packets of dissolved apple cider mix. The gravy, the onions, the potatoes, the brats.... Heavenly! And my 9-year-old son said it was filling! Laaaa! The angels are singing! I’ll definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe!

Perfect comfort food!!  I changed up the order of prep.  Cooked the sausages on med/high heat so they got nice and brown..just put them off to the side, not really nec to heat up the oven.   Added a bit of butter to the pan  and softned and lightly browned the onions.  I used my own homemade beef broth which I'm sure helped with the awesome flavour!  Once I got the gravy simmering I started the potatoes; as it does take well over 10 min to reduce the gravy..more like 45.   Just throw the sausages in the gravy for a couple of minutes to warm them up before serving.  I served with pan fried brussel sprouts.  Try making your own bone broth peeps, it's so easy and delish, you'll never use bouillon cubes again! :)

Really delicious. Really liked the light mustard taste in the mashed potatoes. The gravy was excellent but I used much less liquid, only 2 cups of beef broth and 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar (didn't have red wine), I also added some corn starch as I prefer gravy to be thicker.
It came out excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it, but I've yet to meet the Irish guy that was satisfied with 1/2 cup of potatoes and one sausage,  I think you need to double the sausage if you are going to feed 4 people.  Very tasty.

My family loves this! I've made it three times so far. As noted, the gravy is very thin, and just by preference I thicken it with flour and corn starch. There tends to be alot of gravy, so I freeze the leftover and use it next time, which makes it a super-fast meal! Perfect weekend meal!!

Absolutely fantastic!!  Took a chance and made this recipe for my 'new' family after hearing a story about a trip to Europe they took 10 years ago. Now I have been requested to make it often. Even those who didn't care for Bangers, liked this dish. :-)

I have never had bangers and mash. While at Fresh Market I saw "banger sausage" .  I forget what he said the ingredient was that made it a banger sausage  The butcher gave me a link as a sample. I will pan fry the sausage and use some left over mashed potatoes and gravy for my first experience.

I made this gravy last night to go with our bangers and mash and it was WONDERFUL!!! The only thing I would suggest is maybe doubling it as the more gravy the better. I didn't use quite as much onion as in suggested but I think that part is a personal preference. Thank you so much for this reciepe, it's definitely a keeper!!!!

The gravy was better than my best roast beef gravy! I did use a bit less liquid based on reviews.

I am visiting friends in England, and decided to make this recipe for them. Well, nothing was left on the plates. The only thing I did extra, was to slightly thicken the onion gravy. I used a red Shiraz caber at and beef oxo for broth.

Made this for Father's Day lunch, so I had to serve 7. I used brats, so the cooking time was a little longer than stated. I ended up not increasing the gravy, and sliced the onions, rather than chop them. After the gravy was made, the brats were still not cooked through, so I added the gravy to the pan containing the brats and stuck it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes, which finished cooking them and kept the gravy hot. Next time, I will cook the brats on a lower heat in the skillet and get them more cooked through, although the oven was effective and it let the brats soak up some of the juice.

This is the best Bangers and Mash I have ever had and I have been to MANY pubs. My family eats until it hurts with this one. I add the mustard to the gravy and a Tsp of worchestershire. I have made this for the boys at my firehouse and Ill be making it during a week long Renn Faire by request. Cant say enough about this one

Substituted the red wine for a bottle of Prohibition Ale, served it with green peas and it was fantastic!  I never realized how simple the gravy was to make, so thank you a bunch for sharing this traditional recipe.  Family and I loved it!

This was very good - did not add the mustard powder to the potatoes, but otherwise kept to the recipe. The gravy reminds me of french onion soup, without the cheese, of course, but its very tasty. I had real Irish sausage that I picked up at Costco, complete with the "rusk" that makes the sausage split open with a "bang" when its cooked. At my house, this recipe is much preferred to corned beef and cabbage for St. Patty's Day.

Not a bad recipe to use as a general reference. The red wine is kind of unnecessary (but works), and the mustard powder is purely a matter of taste; personally, I think bangers and mash should be a minimalist dish with simple, hearty flavors. But nonetheless, not a bad recipe.

Really nice gravy.  I already had mashed potatoes, so didn't use that part of the recipe.  It does, however, make a TON of gravy - I ended up freezing about half of it.  I intend to use it on top of hamburger steaks...

Only used the onion part. I added flour and made a roux before adding liquids for a thicker gravy. In the end, I added a little thyme to give it a flavor boost.

We frequently meet our children and their families at a local Irish/English Pub, and of course this is our go to dish.  It seemed simple enough to make at home.  I did find a few surprise ingredients in the recipe, but I think it turned out better than the restaurant's dish.  We will still dine at the Pub but now we will order other dishes, who knows it may even spark an  interest in trying to make another dish. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  This will definitely be a go to recipe for our family gatherings.

I followed the recipe and really enjoyed our meal. I tweaked the potatoes, as my family likes creamy mash potatoes. I added more butter and milk and then used an electric whisk to mix them. 

For the gravy I made a roux of equal parts butter and flour, to thicken up the sauce. I melted 1/4 cup butter in pan and slowly whisked in 1/4 cup flour. 

This was an easy recipe and my whole family enjoyed it!

This is my go to bangers and mash recipe. The mustard in the mashed potatoes is wonderful - just be careful depending on the potency of your mustard powder. I switched brands once  and it was so overpowering it was nearly inedible, but easily adjusted. This also holds over well in a crockpot for parties!

The star of this recipe is the bangers.  I used quality bangers from the local butcher and they were delicious.   Since my family is more used to a thicker gravy,  the thin gravy produced by this recipe was different.  It tasted fine, but it was time consuming to cook down so much beef broth.  You also needed a ladle to get all the onions with the gravy when you pour it on the potatoes and bangers.   Next time, I may use an alternate recipe for the gravy to make it thicker.

As written we give it 4 Stars. We prefer it with some modifications bringing it to 5 star in our book. (We prefer guiness in lieu of the red wine, use red onions, some minced garlic, and a spoon of browning sauce. We love it this way.

Super easy to make! The red wine onion sauce was fantastic. Added sweet peas to the dish...this will definitely be included in the fall/winter rotation

The only changes to this recipe I made were to use a plant-based sausage.  Absolutely delicious thin gravy the family loved it as did I.

Really simple and flavourful.  Made as written and loved it.  Second time I used a gf lager and a splash of wine then added 1/2 cup water with 2 Tbsp cornstarch to thicken.  Popped the bangers in the oven on 420 for 15 min.

8.8.18  I bought real English Bangers at a sausage market in Sarasota, so they were the real deal, delicious!  First thing I want to say is there is w-a-a-a-y too much gravy in proportion to the sausage in this recipe.  I reduced the gravy by 50% and had more than enough to cover the sausage and potatoes with a little left over. I changed from chopped to thinly-sliced onions in the gravy, since that’s the way it’s always been served at a restaurant or pub.  I made the gravy, tasted it, and thought the flavor was very weak, so I added a little dijon, chopped garlic, splash of worcestershire, and black pepper.  Although the recipe author states the gravy would be thin, it was just pure liquid (not gravy to me), so I thickened it a bit with a cornstarch slurry to reach what I think is gravy consistency.  The mash was good, although I thought the dry mustard was totally lost.  Don’t typically do this the first time I try a new recipe, but yes, I did make a few changes.  Had I put this on the table exactly the way the recipe was written, it wouldn’t have been enjoyed nearly as much.  The key to this recipe is really good sausages and really good gravy, and we were fairly happy with the way this turned out.  Thanks for sharing.

I'm a big fan of bangers and mash so I purchased the banger sausages from Whole Foods, used Yukon Gold potatoes and followed the recipe. The result was a little disappointing. The gravy, despite being sufficiently reduced, was bland. I feel like I was missing a few ingredients. I will keep looking for better recipes and try again.

As the author notes, this is indeed a 'thin' gravy, and not at all what one would expect in this country (USA).  I found the '10 minutes to reduce by half' to be quite inaccurate. It took more than half an hour on a pretty solid boil. All-in-all, totally worth the wait!!

I was out of beef broth so i used some beef "better than boullion" mixed with mushroom broth.  I also used a tablespoon of prepared dijon mustard instead of dry mustard in the potatoes.  Probably could have used more to make a more significant flavor, but I was feeding my kids too and they like a more simple dish.  I finished the bowl with a sprinkle of finely chopped green onions.

Nice easy to make dish.  My wife has spent much of her life in the UK and says that it was authentic.  I sliced the onions to resemble the photo, but she says that they should be chopped finer for more authenticity.

This dish was delicious. I was able to find bangers at the grocery store in Canada. For the gravy I recommend adding a lot of corn starch when the liquid is cool so it thickens up as it was very watery. I will definitely make this again!

It all tasted good, but the gravy was incredibly watery and ruined the meal. The sauce flavor was tasty , but was so overly  watery that it was not even possible to scoop it up to even enjoy it. Also there was way too much potatoes and gravy  compared to the sausage amount.  There was  enough of patatoes and gravy  for six  people yet only enough sausage for two people.

Incredible taste.  Next time I make it I will cut back on the amount of beef broth and wine - we ended up after boiling down the mixture for about half an hour with at least 2 extra cups of the mixture.  I’ll freeze it for later - yum!!!!  (We used a Syrah - excellent!)

great recipe but i think i need a skillet bigger than my entire stove in order to fit 6 cups beef broth 2 cups of wine and 2 large onions, also this will not reduce its volume to half in ten minutes, more like 100 minutes .

Cooking time for this dish is really about 2 1/2 hours+

after reducing the gravy for about 1 hour and 45 minutes on very high it still needs to be thickened( i use 2 table spoons of corn starch) , best to start the gravy very first as it will take the entire cooking time x2 to reduce.

This was great! We used brats (5 links) and 3 medium/largr size russet potatoes, which was just right. If you love lots of potato you might want to use one more. Even reduced by half, there was WAY too much gravy. We ended up throwing a lot away because it was way more than what was needed. Next time I'll halve that part of the recipe. But the flavor was great.

Found bangers at Costco and thought we'd give this a go.  I just mashed potatoes like I normally do.  It all went together better than it would be individually.  We did not care for the gravy.  I was surprised since it has such great reviews.  I followed gravy recipe to a T, except let it cook down longer.  The red wine flavor was too strong (and we love red wine!).  I would make this again and just use brown gravy.

I made it as written this time with only the addition of a slurry to the gravy to slightly thicken as we like our gravy a bit thicker. Having said that, this recipe makes WAAAYYY too much gravy for 4 sausages.  Next time I will use half the onion, half the broth, and a quarter of the wine, as it seemed to be a little too strong on the wine side.  Recommend brats for your sausage as it'll give a bit more spice to the whole recipe.  I have never used ground mustard in mashed potatoes before, but was thrilled with the taste and the way it worked with the gravy.  Wasn't sure if husband would like it but he really did and wants me to make it again.  Will say that you really should start the gravy before anything else as 10 minutes to cook down to half is unrealistic. You can get the gravy completely made beforehand and then reheat if necessary.  Oh, and save yourself a pan and put the brats on a grill.

This gravy was really good. It smelled incredible cooking, and even more amazing in taste. I used 4 small onions. Pinot noir for the wine.  I guess my broth wasn't salty enough, but I'd rather that than overly salty...easy to add, not so easy to take away! Will make again.

I liked this better than a recipe I got from U.K. So far I'm not a fan of the sausage itself, but my son and husband loved this recipe. It was certainly simple to make. I do wish I would have made some soda bread with it, but alas mashed potatoes was all the carb I wanted on the table. Great recipe. Thank you for sharing it.

this was a big success at our church potluck. super quick & easy.  to make serving easier I cut the brats (used local favorite) into slices and threw them in the broth/gravy in the crockpot. definitely look forward to making this is summer with leftovers :)

I made this dish to celebrate St. Patrick's Day and boy was it fabulous!  I followed the directions other than thickening up the gravy with cornstarch.  To round out the meal I served it with a fresh batch of no-knead bread.  This one is a keeper, thank you sharing such a fabulous recipe!

It was ok.  As written, the recipe is time consuming and just plain un-user friendly.  If you're decent in the kitchen, you can cut the nonsense and have this  on the table in 30 minutes.  I cooked my potatoes and sausage at the same time (different pans obviously) then set the sausage aside, covered, and made the gravy (in the pan I cooked the sausage).  While that was simmering (read: reducing) I mashed my potatoes and steamed some broccoli.  Dinner, done.  For anyone who doesn't like the thin consistency of the gravy, make a cornstarch slurry with a little beef broth and add that.  Or just let it reduce in your pan for a while.  And unless you want a gallon of leftover gravy, you can cut your broth & wine amounts in half (or even more) and still have enough to go around. (I cook for one and I used 1/2 cp broth & 1/4 cp wine, reduced on med heat for about 5 minutes.)

I found that the gravy was not to my or my husband's taste. It also took a lot longer than 10 minutes to reduce by half. I expected it to be thin as per the cook's comments, but it was not very flavorful (at least not flavors we liked). While we like bangers and mash, this is not the gravy we will use going forward.

I made this tonight..my husband and l loved it! Pretty simple and the gravy goes perfectly with potatoes and sausage. I ate this at a restaurant so I was inspired to try this, my dish tasted even better! ..and cheaper The gravy I did a little differently. I cut the red wine and beef stock in half and added 2 tbls of cornstarch for thickener. Wow! So yummy ??

My alterations: I split my sausage and cooked them down in beer until they got a nice sear.  I also added garlic, parsley, and mushrooms to my reduction. Oh and I used homemade instead of store bought red wine.

Wow! Amazing flavour in the sauce! Followed the recipe almost exactly but modified by also adding in fresh mushrooms to the sautéed onions (about 4 minutes before adding the broth and wine) - but only because we love mushrooms. Used sausages marketed as "bangers" - mild flavoured sausages that let the true flavour of the sauce enhance them. I liked the dry mustard in the potatoes (who knew?) . Thank you to the submitter! Will be making this anytime we crave true comfort food.

Despite the fact that my sauce didn't look the same (I used a really dark red wine and it was nearly black - not appetizing to look at) this was a delicious dish. 

I made two changes, first off I lightly browned the "bangers" and then baked them in the oven (425 for 18 minutes -  taken from an Ina Garten recipe) and secondly I added mushrooms to the gravy.  Really good recipe.

This was very tasty, it did take awhile to reduce by half but the wait was SO worth it... Probably should have followed the suggestion by another allrecipes member to thicken the gravy just a tad, I'll just do that next time... Don't know the last time I got "splashed" by my gravy ;)

Great recipe! I'm not a huge gravy person, and wondered why everyone raved about this gravy so much, but it's SO good!! Some edits I would make to the recipe:
1. Like most people said, thicken the gravy just a tad. I added 3 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with a little cold water (you want it to mix before adding to the gravy to avoid clumping) and then mix it in while it's warm before it boils. 
2. Some people said this, but cut the gravy recipe in half. You don't need that much unless you're cooking A LOT of sausage to taters to go with it
3. Typically, sausage recipes have you throw like a cup of water in on the skillet and cover. So the skin on mine was a bit burnt.  I would just follow the cooking instructions on the package of whatever sausage you buy, they all vary depending on thickness and such. 

Honestly, the only thing unique about this recipe is the gravy. You can cook sausage and mashed potatoes anyway you normally do. I thought the ground mustard was a good touch to the mashed potatoes. I like a lot of flavor on my sides, so I threw in a couple other spices too, to make it interesting. 

Would totally make this again!! Enjoy it with a cold glass of beer :)

Mmm I was sure skeptical at first but OMG! This was delicious! I didn't have the correct amount of red wine/beef broth so scaled it down for 2 with 1 can beef broth/1 cup red wine. Turned out awesome! Don't let the sauce fool you being thing because it soaks up in the mashed potatoes perfectly! And be sure not to forget to add the dry mustard to the potatoes because it made the mash PERFECT! Great recipe and you gotta try!

I made this recipe for an Irish themed work potluck and it got rave reviews.

I changed around the order of things for timing sake. I put the potatoes on to boil first. While I did that, I put the wieners on (I used Johnsonville Beer 'n Bratwurst Brats. They were delicious. After the Brats were done, I put some butter in the same pan and sautéed the onions in the Brat drippings. All those delicious drippings would be a shame to go to waste. I put the wine in to burn off the liquor for about 5 minutes first, then the beef broth. After it reduced by half, it tasted DELICIOUS, but I was a little afraid people would complain how thin it was, so I removed some of the liquid and beat in some cornstarch before returning it to the gravy. I didn't feel it needed any additional salt, but I did add some freshly cracked pepper. All together it was really darn good. We all decided the gravy could be used for a number of things, including over a steak, which I think is a divine idea. Maybe with a few mushrooms? Yes please!!

I did not add salt to anything, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This is actually the 3rd time I've made this and I love it every time. Fortunately we live near a meat market that sells lots of specialty sausages, such as Irish bangers and andouille.  I made this on St. Patrick's day. You can go anywhere and get corned beef and cabbage, but in my home there is always something different like bangers and mash or a nice Irish coddle with freshly baked soda bread... yum. This was a great meal and my husband and I loved it, and I will make it again, I'm sure.  Thanks for this awesome recipe, it's been saved as a favorite of mine for quite awhile now :-)

Made this tonight. Used Irish banger sausages from Fresh Market which are to die for.  Adding dry mustard to the potatoes is genius. I also used more (soy) milk and less butter. Turned out great. IMHO, the sauce ingredients could be cut in half. Had a huge amount left over when everything else was gobbled up.  Hope it freezes well since it's absolutely delicious.  Used a bit of corn starch to thicken. Added  mushrooms  to the sauce (cooked separately) at the very end. Husband almost always doctors sausages however they're prepared by adding condiments. This  is the first time he's said this didn't need anything more. Definitely a winner!

Good but next I'll use less wine and more beef broth as my gravy turned out red!  And slice the onions instead of chopping.

Pretty great recipe, the gravy was delish.  The potatoes were dry alone, but were balanced with the loose gravy.  Dry mustard was tough to mix in, would premix with the milk  next time.  

Timing was all wrong - start the gravy first, potatoes next, bangers last.

Gravy was a bit thin for me so I added flour to the onions and then added the broth and wine. I also put the sausages back into the gravy, turned the heat down to low, covered and simmered for 1/2 hour. Served with the mash, peas and carrots, and a fresh salad. Perfect meal for a cold, winters day.

This was very good! I used regular pork brats from the supermarket, and like many reviewers I sliced the onions into strips, not chopped/diced. I let the gravy reduce way more than half, and thickened it with just a tablespoon of cornstarch. It was still thin, but had more flavor and depth to it. Overall a great dish! I served it at a UK-themed potluck birthday party last night, and only heard raves.

This hit home with the Irishman in our household who seems to be genetically wired for ANYTHING Irish and can pinpoint a good Irish dish from a bad one.  I made this for breakfast on St. Patrick's Day and was able to find Irish Bangers at Whole Foods at the last minute for the occasion.  That's what I get for procrastinating.  I think otherwise, you'll have to plan ahead and order online from a retailer on the East Coast if you want to use traditional Irish Bangers.  I didn't skin the potatoes because they hold all the nutrition of a potato.  The onion gravy was BOMB!  I usually have to hide ANY vegetables from my husband, being strictly a steak and potatoes guy and all, but he willingly ate several extra bites past his point of "FULL" all the while oozing with great compliments regarding the onion gravy.  I think next time, I might try to stew the bangers in some Guinness for a bit before moving them into the skillet and reserving the Guinness reduction for the onion gravy.  YUM!!!

"Baby, this is excellent"...This is what my husband said to me as soon as he started eating this meal.  I followed the directions as close to it as I could. I used a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and some Swanson beef flavored Flavor Boost in place of the beef broth as I didn't have any.  I also used a package of Johnsonville Smoked Sausage in place of the individual sausages.  It was ridiculously delicious!  I will, however go back and make this again the EXACT way it is written, but no complaints here!  Thanks for the recipe!
And THANK YOU to Johnsonville!

OMGosh - This was really good!!! I first used the smaller pork links, but added Bratwurst. The potatoes were less done - had to use only electric appliances because our propane line was being replaced, so had to microwave, & mixed them in my KitchenAid. They had some small chunks, but were very good like that. I wondered about the mustard powder, but followed the recipe & it was marvelous! Lots of onions,which I chopped fine. Seemed a lot, but was perfect, as the wine/beef broth sauce tasted savory. I didn't have enough beef broth, so I used half wine, half broth. I served this with a small loaf of Brennan's Irish Soda Bread from this site, which I cooked in my convection/toaster oven & it was all so good. One of my best meals. The family raved about it! I will definitely make this again!

We picked up some bangers from our farmers market and I couldn't wait to try this recipe! It was wonderful only the gravy still wasn't reduced after 20 minutes of boiling. We ate it like it was but I am sure it would have been a 5 stars if the gravy was right. So start the gravy first then work on everything else. Thanks for sharing!

We LOVE this recipe.  Something about the gravy with the wine just makes the taste,  I am trying to introduce new meals to my boyfriend and he was pleasantly surprised.

This was a great recipe with only really one complaint...I found the potatoes to be mediocre...I added some sour cream and cayenne pepper to give it a little more flavor.  The gravy was on point.  I took other users recommendation and thickened it up using a mixture of flour and oil and also added browning and seasoning sauce to darken it up.  After those alterations, the gravy was just like what I have eaten in Ireland.

Awesome recipe and easy to make.  I used bratwurst and added the 1/2 cup of cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  We loved it!
