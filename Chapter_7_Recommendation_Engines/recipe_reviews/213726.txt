I found this recipe searching by ingredients because all I had at home were eggs, spinach and feta. I used regular wheat bread, and also a few wheat tortillas that I also had lying around. I didn't have any oregano.   I made eight of these for me and my fiance for breakfast. I think saying one cup is a serving is a little misleading. Three or four will fill you up. I really liked how light-tasting these were. I used about five whole eggs, and then two eggs with just the whites, to make the egg mixture a bit fluffier.   Overall, these are great because they're light and very easy to make. I'm not judging the flavor too much because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. My boyfriend ended up adding hot sauce to his, probably because of the blandness, which is probably my fault, not the recipe's.

I made these this morning! The only real changes I made were adding mushrooms, cutting it down to two eggs and subbing in egg whites and a few extra spices. My neighbor raved over them! and so so easy to do! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Delicious "change of pace" for breakfast! I had fresh basil from the garden so I substituted that for the spinach. It worked out very well. I really liked the crispy "cup" and the soft, flavorful egg mixture inside. The egg cups looked as good as they tasted. I feel that most people will eat 2 egg cups (rather than 1) for a serving. Will be making again.
