This is an unusual, but delicious dip! I served this with plain bagel chips. Inexpensive to make, too! I never would have thought to mix garlic, onion powder and pineapple, but it definitely works! UPDATE: I tried this as a spread on bagel ham sandwiches to make a Hawaiian bagels and it was amazing! If you have some dip left over, try it!

Even without the onion and garlic, which my husband can't eat, this is a great dip for not only chips and pretzels, but for fruit as well.  It does NOT stick around long either.

I have been making this for some time, but using only cream cheese and pineapple. It is creamy and refreshing and I think it is best served with pretzels.

LOVED IT! Had a girls night in with a bunch of girlfriends and it was a real hit. I did add a pinch more onion powder and garlic though for a little more flavor. Thanks, will definately make again.

This one was okay, not as popular as the cheesy/chile dip I served the same night. The flavor reminded me a lot of the popular breakfast combination of pineapple and cottage cheese. One of my guests said that that the pineapple made it refreshing. It was just okay, maybe I should have served it with another cracker (I served with Melba toast, which was a little too crunchy for this maybe)

i made this dip with only 1 can of pineapple, and 1 clove of garlic. i tried it instantly after making it. the garlic was WAY TOO OVERPOWERING!!!!
it honestly tasted garsely, but thought it may be one of those dips that need good quality fridge time to settle. much better after a day of sitting, but tasting it initially has ruined this dip for me, it just reminds me of my first taste. a word of advise to all those going to make this, try AFTER it has had sitting time! my family loved it though.

I make this dip all the time.  I make mine much simpler and it comes together in 5 minutes.  I buy Dean's French Onion dip, crushed pineapple, and King's Hawaiian bread.  I drain the pineapple, add to the onion dip, cut a hole in the center of the round loaf and place the dip in the center of the loaf.  It just makes life simple and is great for a fast treat to take to a party or get together.

I served with bagel chips and crackers, people ate it but I didn't care for it.  The garlic was a little over powering even after preparing the night before, I would have prefered just pineapple and cream cheese.

I ended up using only 1 cup of pineapple because I didn't realize that I didn't have enough (note: two 20 oz. cans will get you 2 cups after it's drained!).  It was still pretty good!  Something different...I didn't find the garlic overpowering at all.  I took it to a party last night and noticed that those who tried it came back for more.  :)

I made this for my wedding reception on 10-10-10 and it went over very well!  The guest thought that the catering company had made it.  With only 4 ingredients,it was very simple to make. I also put some pieces of pineapple on it for effect. Or you can use sliced almonds. I highly reccomend this.

I made this recipe for a party last weekend and it was a total hit!  Everyone was raving over it and asking for the recipe.  Making it again for company this weekend.  Served it with pretzels like someone recommended and it was the perfect pairing.  Also didn't have fresh garlic but it was just fine with garlic powder (1/8 tsp per clove).

This is so good!  I have also had it without the garlic and onion powder, but with a dollop of pineapple jam added to the pineapple and cream cheese, and served with CORN CHIPS (like fritos).  This seemed so unusual but it was unbelievably good!!!

This is the best ever.Seemed an odd combo at first but well worth trying. I put it in the food processor to blend and smooth it out. I reduced garlic to just one clove and added chopped green onions after blending to add color.  Rave reviews when I served to 2 different groups.

This was different and delicious!  Everyone raved about this, and it was gone very quickly.  The only change I made was that I didn't have onion powder on hand so used a little seasoned salt and pepper.  I used one larger and one smaller garlic clove, so it wasn't overpowering at all.  Served with sliced baguette.  Yummy!

Whoa!! Onion!!  I made the mistake of putting all the onion powder in at once, and it overpowers the dip. I think if you add it 1/4tsp at a time until you like it, all will be good.  I used it as a spread for a ham & veggie sandwich ring and it worked out fine, even with the strong onion flavor.

My fella made this for us one night as a snack and I was hesitant at first, as I don't care much for sweet dips.  WOW...this is great.  It hits all areas of your palate...creamy, sweet, savory and heat (garlic).  Thanks for sharing this -- I will be making it for the next party or pot-luck!

Sorry, this is not what I remembered of a dip I used to love. It was awful, runny, even though I drained the pineapple really well, and a funny taste.  I am giving it 3 stars even though after one taste I thew it away, because perhaps it was that it just did not live up to my memories.  Very, very off taste to me.  since others have reveiwed it so hightly must just be me.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving for an appetizer. I did add a few things though. I thought it was delicious on it's own, but I experimented. I added feta cheese, almonds and sunflower seeds for some crunch and the nuts added a little color to the dip. It was described by one as "off the charts good."  Pretty sure that's a good thing.  I will definitely be making this dip again. I served it with BIG wheat thins... was perfect with them as they have a slight sweetness to them. :-)

Yummy! I didn't have onion powder so I put some chopped green onions in; other than that, I followed the recipe. This is excellent!

At first I was intrigued, but I do like each of these ingredients independently, so why not, right?  I got some good reviews from guests who couldn't figure out exactly what was in this dip that was so good!  Creamy, garlicky, and a little sweet.  Great with salty Triscuits.

I served this at a New Year's Day party and it got mixed reviews.  They either hated or loved it.  I substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and it was pretty garlicky.  Think I'll reduce it a little next time.  We tried it on a variety of crackers etc and found it was best on pretzels and thin rounds of good sour dough bread.  You do need to make it at least a day ahead of time so it can mellow a little.

I served this July 4th with plain bagel chips and adults and teens loved it. I did not use onion powder.  I doubled the recipe so I would have plenty for a group of 20 but it made way too much. I would suggest 1 1/2 times if you need more . Definitely allow time to chill it as this is key , I tasted it right when I made it and then again chilled....big difference.

Made this for my family for father's day and it received several compliments.  I agree with previous reviewers that you must wait overnight for the flavors to meld.  I served with bagel chips as suggested.

I've been making this dip for years.  The only thing I do differently is add about an inch of grated ginger.  It tastes like Hell when you first make it.  Resist the temptation to make and serve.  Let the flavors meld in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before serving.

I have made this before, however during holidays I add chopped pecans, green onions, and shredded sharp cheddar.   To dress I crush toasted pecans and make the cheese into a ball and roll over the toasted nuts.  Always a hit!

The dip was not what I was expecting.  It was very heavy in garlic, and I love garlic.  Once I added more cream cheese the taste improved but the dip definatly did not make you saw WOW.  Dip was NOT a hit.  If you are looking to WOW others keep looking

This recipe was pretty tasty.  Much better the second day, once the garlic permeated everything.  I ate it on pretzels.  I also ate in a tortilla with black beans. Next up I'm trying cucumber sandwiches.

This was okay. Unlike some other reviewers I didn't think the onion and garlic was overpowering at all. I thought it maybe had too much pineapple. I think maybe a little bit of finely chopped ham might make this dip better. Might add some ham to the rest of the dip to see. Don't know if I would make it again, but I like trying new things, so thanks for sharing!

This dip tasted great, I served with ritz crackers, ham, olives, and a variety of cheese cubes for a get together and everyone enjoyed it.  The only issue I had was mine came out a little too thin.  I did drain the pineapple, but I will make double sure to drain extra good and barely add back any of the juice if at all.  Will definitely make again to go with cheese platter.

I just finished putting this recipe together and even before I had a chance to refrigerate the dip, my husband and daughter had each had at least 3 crackers!

Like someone suggested, I put the ingredients in the food processor.  I like a little more texture so next time I would process the cream cheese, garlic, and onion powder with only 1 cup of drained, crushed pineapple and then stir in the remaining cup after. I kept all ingredients and amounts as listed in recipe and love it.

I will be serving this tonight for our Girlz Night Out group with bagel chips and also toasted baguette rounds with a small piece of deli ham.  I think it will be a hit!

I do like this!  I have to admit, I didn't do much measuring at first.  I added only one clove of garlic, and I guess I put in too much pineapple juice, because it was really runny...So I just added more cream cheese, and got it to a nice consistency.  I recommend keeing the garlic to a minimum...probably half a clove is plenty...and I like garlic.

Instead of fresh garlic which was too strong/overpowering for this dish(and I love garlic), I used 1 teaspoon of roasted garlic that you buy in a jar. I served it with pumpernickel pretzels. It was a great hit!

This was Ok. When they say 2 cloves garlic, boy they mean it. I love garlic so I thought I'd be smart and add a 3rd lil clove..oh man was I wrong. Way too much! Other than that, this was good. Served on a soft thinly sliced sourdough baguette.

This was OK.  I thought the garlic was way too overpowering.  And I like garlic. I also only used 1 clove of garlic, and it was still too much.  I think next time I would just use 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead. Also - this dip gives you the WORST garlic breath!

Very interesting flavors! I had fresh pineapple which I crushed with a potato masher. I also didn't have onion powder, so I minced a little red onion for some color. Served with crackers although I'm sure it's even better with French bread slices. Next time I will choose smaller garlic cloves. Nice find! Thanks!

This dip is delicious and can't be any easier to make. I followed the recipe  and the sugestions to make it the night before. Served it with bagel chips and it was hit.

Can I give this, like, ten stars?? I was skeptical, but I had a little cream cheese left over to use up, and pineapple for another recipe I'm getting ready to make. I made this, put it on some thin toast, and it is truly one of The Very Best Things I have ever put in my mouth. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

One of my favorite go-to recipes for dips. The garlic and onion powder smell a little over-powering at first, but once the dip has been chilled, the flavor is perfectly balanced.

Sorry! I followed the directions exactly and no one could eat it. The kids said it tasted like tuna pineapple. The garlic was strong

Saw the reviews and thought I would try.  No onion power, no garlic for us.  Too much of an effect on something so good. Will try small amount of green onion and 1 Tablespoon of pineapple jam. Also a dash of lemon juice to cut the sweet taste.  Family and friends like this much better.

This one was very much liked in the party. I used only 1 cup pineapple (instead of 2), and skipped the onion powder. So the dip was creamy and not too chunky. I will use this again!
I served it with whole wheat pita chips (homemade: just cut whole wheat pita into diamond shape, drizzle some olive oil, and bake for 20 minutes. They turn out crisp and healthy).
