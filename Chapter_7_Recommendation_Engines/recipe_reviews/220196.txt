We LOVED your chowder, Wyattdogster! Thank you! I made two small changes for convenience purposes only. I had Cajun-style sausage in the freezer to use. I simply fried it with the vegetables, adding 1 large chopped carrot. I also used evaporated milk instead of the cream as I had planned to freeze some of it for later use. My friends on the Buzz recommended the canned milk as it won't seem curdled when I reheat the chowder from it's frozen state. I shared the soup with my sick brother and he loved it too. He was able to eat two ladles full and relished every bite. Now, that's success! Thanks again!

Enjoyed this a alot although 2t dried thyme is WAY too much imo. I used just under 1t and it was still a bit too much. Followed the submitter's suggestion of adding a can of creamed corn - liked the texture much better. Thanks!

This was fantastic. I followed recipe almost exactly except used red potatoes and about half the thyme. I also threw in a few slices of turkey bacon and used chicken andouille sausage as a lighter alternative. This had a great spicy flavor and was a hit with the hubby.

Really too much thyme, for our taste. Next time, will only use 1/4 tsp. But I WILL make it again! Very spicy-good. Dropped corn muffin in just before serving.

Changed a couple things. Based on my spouse’s lactose intolerance, left out the cream. Used 1/3 cup of flour thickening and all the dinner guests were very complementary. Thanks for the recipe, now shared again.

Great flavor.  I do wish that the broth was a little thicker.  I think it would be improved with some cans of cream corn instead of the heavy cream.

This was really very good. I added 2 minced jalapenos for some xtra peppery goodness. Try sprinkling smoked paprika on top--delish!

EXCELLENT! I used a whole red and green pepper, just to use them up, and I omitted the thyme b/c I had none on hand and we are not fans of it anyways. Also, I reduced the cayenne by half, b/c I didn't want it to be too spicy for my little guy. This had such a wonderful, hearty flavor! We like our chowders a bit thicker, so I used a cornstarch slurry, just to tighten it up a little (I had no creamed corn on hand). Hubby raved and insisted on taking the leftovers to work for lunch tomorrow (believe me, that's a major compliment). I will def be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was amazing. I would not change a thing about this recipe. My entire family loved it. My youngest doesn’t like spicy food but he gobbled this up. Today was a hot summer day. I can hardly wait to make this again when some snow is on the ground.

Easy to make and a wonderful meal on a cold winter night. I added a little more cayenne pepper and a handful of chopped smoked dried tomatoes.

This was delicious!  Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews that suggested easing off the cayenne until after I had put it in.  This was more spicy than I or my husband cared for but it was good.  I did add the creamed corn.  Also, I waited to add the cream until the very last minute before serving instead of with the potatoes.  We had it with garlic bread to soak up the juice! Yum!

I made this and took out the diced celery, bay leaves, thyme  and the cilantro. I served it at the restaurant I work for and everyone absolutely loves it. It is now become one of our daily soups.

Very Good! This one is a keeper. The only thing I might do different is add more cayenne pepper because I didn't get much spice.

Delicious! I didn't have olive oil so I used avocado oil, instead.  Also, I removed the casings from the sausage and just crumbled it with my hands before cooking.  I will definitely be making this again.

I have to say, I'm usually not a fan of Creole cuisine, but I happen to have some Andouille sausage in the freezer and a couple of ears of corn that needed to be used up in the fridge, when I saw this on Allrecipes Facebook feed this morning. I cut the recipe in half and used yellow pepper in place of the green (as we don't care for green peppers), and I used fresh corn in place of the frozen. This turned out absolutely delicious! I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it.  I made Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread (also from this site) and a small bowl of this with a piece of that was lunch! I'd totally make this again!

Excellent recipe! Would highly recommend. I omitted the cayenne pepper (didn’t have any on hand), used 3 fresh ears of corn instead of frozen, and followed the recommendations from others by decreasing the amount of thyme by half, and adding one can of creamed corn as a thickener. Turns out it still was not the thick consistency I was looking for in a chowder, so I made a simple flour slurry by mixing some of the soup liquid and two tablespoons of flour in a bowl, and whisked it into the simmering soup during the last 5 minutes of cooking to increase the soup’s viscosity. Worked perfectly! Next time I will omit the creamed corn all together and thicken the soup with the slurry. I didn’t need to add any additional salt or pepper as the sausage and chicken broth already provided enough seasoning. I also used half-and-half instead of whole cream, and omitted the cilantro (personal presence.) Delicious! Will definitely make this again!

Apparently I really like Thyme because I didn’t see that comment until after I added 2t. Very flavorful and hearty for this snowy day. The spice was just right for us. Not sure how to keep the milk/oil from separating, so it doesn’t look great, but I have no problem eating it.

I would agree with others than about a third less stock makes a better chowder.  Otherwise I made it to the recipe.  I like the cayenne and thyme in the recipe...gives it heat but also depth of flavor.

I will definitely make this again!  I kept everything almost the same.  The only difference was that I used half n half, 3 ears fresh corn, cut the thyme to 1/2 teaspoon, and made a medium roux with 3T butter and 3T flour. Added the roux at the very end stirring until slightly thickened. Amazing!

Delicious!  I didn't measure my chopped veggies, just cut them up and threw them in the pot.  I had one lone carrot in the vegetable drawer, so that also, went in the pot.  Before adding the heavy cream (although I used Half and Half) I ladled out a large bowl full to make it dairy-free for a friend at work. She is gluten and dairy intolerant, but I know she will enjoy the flavor of this chowder.  I then proceeded with the recipe and we really enjoyed it.  After looking at two grocery stores for andouille sausage, I had to use 4 Pepper Spicy Kielbasa.  Upon Googling it, it told me kielbasa was a good sub.  The soup is delicious and has a nice spice to it, but not too spicy.  Thanks Wyattdogster, for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper in our house.  Can't wait to see how the girls at work like it.

Made this recipe, thinking my girlfriend would like it and I would love it. Turns out I like it and she LOVES it!  Only thing I change is using less chicken broth (approx. 4cups instead of 6) as she likes soup with more food then broth.  IP: If using less broth, reduce the Cayenne Pepper accordingly, unless you like spicy soup.

I've made this chowder twice and played with the seasonings.  I like using fresh sausage but since it adds a lot of heat I cut down on the cayenne. I also took the advice of others and limited the thyme to 1/2 tsp which is just enough.  My twist on this is to use sweet rather than white potato. Finally, I thicken the broth with  flour and milk to give it more body.  This is a great cold weather dish when you really want to have something hearty and filling.
