This is a very dense gingerbread, just what I was looking for.  The only thing I changed was I increased the spices a bit as we like things a bit spicer.  I found this recipe to be plenty moist but I didn't cook it quite as long as the recipe called for, only about 45 minutes, but that could just be my oven.  This cake gets better with age so make it a couple of days before you need it, the flavours seem to mellow.  I served it with warm brandy sauce for our family dinner and it was delicious.

Made this nostalgic gingerbread for a gathering of 35 home school kids. Out of the 35 only three didn't care for it. Since molasses has a rather strong taste I was a bit surprised that so many kids loved it, but it brought requests for seconds! Several Mom's asked for the recipe which I gladly shared. I made 3 slight changes. I added about 3 T home made applesauce, 1/4 C sour cream and added a bit more of each spice. I baked this in 2 medium loaf pans, sliced when cool and then sprinkled with powdered sugar.

I changed the cinnamon and ginger to 2 tsp. and the cloves to 1 tsp. Flavor is excellent but next time I will add 1/2 c. applesauce to add a little moisture.  Will definitely make again.

The aroma alone is well worth 5 stars. I used Splenda, added 1/2 cup applesauce and doubled the spices. I used a 9" square baking pan, oven temp set at 350 and the gingerbread was perfecttly done in 35 minutes.  I can see whay other reviewers complained of the gingerbread being dry and suggested adding applesauce for extra moistness.  So, be sure to check for doneness after 35 minutes or it could be way overbaked at 60 minutes. This will definitely be a recipe I use often.

This was a fantastic recipe.  Followed it to a tee except went heavy on ginger...1 tablespoon.  Added a little extra of the other spices too.  We like it spicy!!  Added a teaspoon of nutmeg!  Wonderful!!!  The house smelled wonderful my husband said I have to make one everyday to make the house smell that good!  My nine year old loved it too.  Sprinkled it with powdered sugar and served it with whipped cream!  This was my first gingerbread but I won't be trying any other recipes...this one nails it!!  Easy, moist and delicious!

Delicious and easy.  I used 1/2 cup of canola oil in place of the butter and it was great.

I thought this was delicious.  I doubled the spices and took it out of the oven 5 minutes early (usually they are more moist that way).  I would try adding applesauce to give it more moisture.  I see a lot of reviews that say the molasses taste is too strong.  I tasted the cake right after baking and thought so too.  But after I left it overnight, the flavor mellowed out and it's perfect!  Using a bundt cake pan would probably make it even more attractive.  Try it warmed up with whipped cream!

Loved this. Delicious, moist and easy to make. Will be making this again soon. 1 hr baking time is to long. Mine was done in 40 mins. (good thing i checked on it!) it would have been overbaked and dry if i kept it in there for the entire 1 hr. Will be making this again soon :)

I don't normally rate recipes, but felt compelled to grade this one.. 'cause, honestly, it was like trying to eat a molasses brick. Despite following the recipe exactly and cooking in a properly working oven, the crumb and crust were not tender and the cake, as a whole, was far too dense. The molasses overwhelmed the other flavors, although that could be 'cause I used Brer Rabbit full flavor style ( I do love molasses!). Will not try this recipe again.

Pumpkin!  I've made this several times and loved it, but my favorite batch was when I added just over 1/2 cup pumpkin to it.  The pumpkin makes it so nice and moist as well as gives it a firm texture.  I doubled the spices with the pumpkin and it is just right.  I will definitely add pumpkin every time.

3 points:  1. I used whole spices (except ginger) and ground them fresh for the recipe; the amounts given were very good and the results flavorful. But I can see pre-ground spices would be very bland, in the amounts given.  2. the seasoning was OK, but not well rounded. The second time, I added 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper and 1 Tbl orange zest. Much better. In the future, I'll also add a 1/4 tsp orange essence or oil.  3. Pan size is all wrong. The batter filled 9" square pan within 1/2" of the rim. I scraped it into a 9"x13" pan and it still baked up 2" thick. (Of course, the recipe does call for an unusually large amount of leavening; a more normal amount would be 1/2 tsp soda.)     I had no problem with dryness, which I find interesting considering the larger pan and how frothy the batter is. FYI, I baked it 40 minutes.

I made this recipe exactly as written and found the spice quantities perfect for us.  I have learned that most spice cake recipes taste better the next day after the spices have had the time to meld and develop.  If you donâ€™t like molasses, this may not be the recipe for you however.  The next time I make it I will reduce the baking time and start checking the cake starting at 45 minutes. The cake had a great texture but was a little dry which could be my oven, not the recipe.   The added bonus of making this recipe -  the house smells phenomenal!

This is very similar to my Irish grandmother's recipe.  She used dark brown sugar in place of the white and always swore the "secret" was to use one cup of very strong, black tea, instead of plain old water.  I've used Chai tea, steeped well, with great success.  The added flavor from the tea gave it a bit of a spicier kick.  For a moister, denser cake, I use 1/4 butter and 1/4 low-fat sour cream instead of 1/2 cup butter.  Overall, still my favorite "gingerbread" recipe!

I doubled the cinnamon and ginger but followed the rest of the recipe. I baked in an 8x8 pan but it only took about 45 minutes. Very strong, spicy taste and not too sweet, so if that's your thing, you'll love this one!

Baking time of one hour appears to be a typo. Checked 3 other similar recipes that gave time as 30-to-35 minutes. I baked for 42 minutes and the cake was well done and a little too well done on the outer edges. The cake was still very tasty with good old-fashioned spicy flavors.

Made exactly as recipe stated and baked for one hour.  It is dry overall and crusty on the top.  It is edible but would need some changes to be made again.

Lots of people keep saying this is dry- it's because of the butter.  Try making it without butter and instead using 1/4 c. vegetable oil and 1/4 applesauce.  It is delicious and very moist this way.  If you have apple butter on hand, that's an even better option than applesauce.

Perfect dense gingerbread- just cook it only 35-40 minutes. I have made this many times and it has never come out dry and I don't add applesauce. I do add extra spices though because we prefer it that way. I have made this many times and love it! Thanks!

I really wanted this to come out perfect but it ended up being dry baked for an hour... I should have read the other reviews but I was actually letting my 13 year old help me bake this... It smelled so heavenly while baking, we served with whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon on top! :)

Easy to make but somewhat bland.  I like flavorful, robust food and am not afraid of a little spice.  In keeping with other reviewer's suggestions, I added extra cinnamon and ginger plus added nutmeg.  The end result is quite good but not the rich, zesty gingerbread I was hoping for.  Also, I had no problem with the bake time.  I checked it after 45 minutes but it wasn't done all the way so I baked it for the recommended hour and it came out fine.

I might make this again because of how easy it is to prepare but I will keep searching for a recipe that yields the strong gingerbread flavor that I am looking for.

This gingerbread recipe is WONDERFUL... dense and flavorful and exactly the way my grandma used to make it! Like other reviewers I also doubled up on the spices, and only cooked it for 45 minutes in a loaf pan... it was perfect. I'll never search for another gingerbread recipe again, this one is IT! Thanks for sharing.

This turned out amazing. The only changes that I made was I added an extra teaspoon of ginger and cinnamon. I also added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg.
I made it for church and everyone loved it.

This was very good! I made some changes to make it lower in fat. I used 1/2 corn oil and 1/2 applesauce instead of butter. I didn't have any molasses so I used lite pancake syrup. I also used dark brown sugar instead of white. I doubled the spices as suggested by another member and I agree that it needed it. I also agree to bake it for 45 minutes instead of 1 hour. It was perfectly moist enough. It sliced up beautifully. I topped it with my own recipe for a spiced drizzle.

This had a nice flavor but was very, very dry.  I cooked for 50 min.  I probably will try a different recipe next time.

I made this as written so I could give it a fair review, it was a decent cake but I wholeheartdly agree that 1 hour was WAY too long mine was done in 45 minutes, and it needs more ginger and spice to get more of a gingerbread flavor.  I made a simple glaze of butter and powdered sugar.  Next time I may use brown sugar instead of white.

I used half oil and half butter which made the texture great. However, the molasses taste is too strong for my taste.

Made this recipe exactly as written, and it was fantastic!  Delicious warm with a dollop of whipped sweetened cream and just as good the next day served with applesauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't have enough molasses, so I ended up using only about 1/2 cup, maybe a little more.  I also added some leftover canned pumpkin, about 1/2 cup. I baked mine for about 40 minutes.  It turned out great, very moist and flavorful.

I don't like to give a bad review unless it is really really bad. But this gets 1 star. We like gingerbread, but I don't know what happened with this recipe,  it was so bad i threw the whole batch right into garbage while it was still warm! I followed recipe to a T but it tasted really awful. Very flat and left bad after taste. It was moist but the flavor wasn't like gingerbread. It may have been the cook but i won't be making this again!

I used Crisco instead of butter and I omitted the cloves (we don't care for them), added 11/2 tsps of the ginger and cinnamon as we like it spicier.  I only baked it for 30 mins in a 9x13 pan and it was perfect moist and spicy.  Loved it!

This was VERY GOOD! My 8 y/o especially liked it. I made it exactly according to recipe. Only alteration was baking time. I set timer for 45 min, but it was a bit overbaked. I would recommend starting to check for doneness at 30-35 min.

Not sure if I did something wrong here but it was WAY too sweet and sickly tasting. If I was to make again I would definitely cut the molasses down by half. It was also very dry. Maybe it's just not the recipe for me, as I can see so many other people liked it!

This was a wonderful gingerbread!!  I did not add any more spices than the recipe called for.  I liked it as is.  On the second go around I substitued 1/4 cup of the water for 1/4 cup applesauce, and it came out a little moister.  I made it as a bundt cake, using the same baking time and it turned out perfect both times.  I topped it with a pear/cranberry sauce and whipped cream and it was the hit of my ladies' night gathering.

This turned out great. I think I was feeling reckless while making it, because I added probably 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt and a bit of almond extract for no good reason at all. But it's delicious! I also took suggestions and added more of all the spices, and also added nutmeg.

Just made this for my husband who recently had heart surgery and is very conscious about what he eats.  He loves gingerbread and ginger snaps and I wanted to make him something he liked but felt OK about eating.  The changes I made were to increase the spices (esp the ginger) as others have mentioned, replaced the sugar with Splenda and the flour with King Arthur's whole wheat flour. He loves it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fairly good, but a little plain by itself.  I made it with a lemon sauce and the sauce really perked it up.

This recipe was a rockstar. Simple easy and full of flavour in my opinion. I had a number of compliments on it. I will make it again for its easiness and great flavour! I used a smaller pan 8x8 still worked out great. I didn't bake it the full time either...just 45 or 50 minutes

I followed several posters advice...used a 9 x 13 pan, cut back on the time to 35 minutes; used butter flavored Crisco in place of butter, and added 1/4 cup or so of applesauce for moisture; also used double the amount of spices. And lastly, and probably most important, did NOT use the strong blackstrap molasses, but rather used a sugar cane molasses. With these changes, this is worthy of ten stars!!! Will be serving for Thanksgiving tomorrow....yum.....

I really wish I would have read the reviews first.  As someone said, It was dry as a bone, minus the flavor.  And I only cooked it for 50 minutes...would not make again.

I made this for a social gathering. Everyone loved it and said how moist it was. I took it out of the oven after 50 minutes, not the recommended 60. It's a keeper!

This is a very good gingerbread recipe.  I made it for my mother's birthday, as she loves gingerbread with lemon sauce.  This recipe does use a heavy hand with the molasses and spices, so beware that if you like a more mellow flavor. 
 My family happens to like strong flavors like that though, so it worked out great.  It is also a very dense and moist cake. 
 Because I was making it for a large crowd, I doubled the recipe and baked it in a half sheet pan.  The only thing that didn't go correctly for me was the baking time.  I put it in the oven at 350 degrees and it was done after 30 minutes, instead of the hour the recipe says.

I followed the directions exactly, but was suspicious of the 1 hour bake time. I set a timer for 40 minutes- the knife came out clean but I kept baking anyway- probably a total of 52 minutes- and it was great. The texture is nice and light. Next time I make it, I would reduce the ginger and increase the sugar- just my preference.

I have made this recipe multiple times, and I love it! It is moist and has a little bit of a sharpness, from the molasses and spices. 

I have been experimenting with different types of molasses, which has been interesting. Each type changes the taste slightly--I was hunting for strong, warm flavor, without too much sharpness. My favorite molasses to use has been Golden Barrel Unsulphured Premier Baking Molasses, which I found on Amazon.

I've made this twice now and the dish you cook it in and the amoutn of molasses makes a big difference. The first time I put it in mini bread loaf tins - it filled 3 - and it was really dense and dark and molasses-y - so strong that it knocked you out. We loved it! The second time I put it in a big bread loaf pan and couldn't squeeze the last 1/8-1/4 cup of molasses out of the narrow necked bottle, and it came out less strong and airier, breadier. I liked that less. So I guess with regards to the density/moistness/strength thing, just pay attention to your pan shape and size and molasses amount??

Fantastic recipe!  I couldn't stop eating this bread.  Doubled up on the spices and followed the rest of the recipe as exact and it came out great.  Would definitely make again.

Turned out delicious. Added half cup of apple sauce and a bit of oil for moistness. Also doubled cinnamon and added pumpkin pie spice. Put it in two 9 inch pans and topped off with vanilla icing and caramel drizzle. Sooooo good.

I will make this again!  I changed a few things because of my personal preferences.  Used pure sorghum (not sorghum pancake syrup, which has other ingredients), instead of molasses, because I don't care for molasses.  Other reviewers increased the spices, so I gave it a try and liked it.  2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1, 1 TB ginger instead of 1 tsp, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp mace, 1/4 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp coriander.  Saw a reviewer that added applesauce, so I added 1/2 cup home canned, unsweetened applesauce.  I used my tube springform pan, and the gingerbread tested done in 40 min.  I cut the bread in half and froze one half for the Christmas morning table.  The other half lasted less than a day.  I had lots of taste testers!  This gingerbread differs from the French Pain d'Ã©pices in that it uses molasses (I used sorghum) instead of honey.  I just may try it with honey sometime.

Great recipe! It is very easy to throw together; I only wish it didn't take an hour to bake. I made it gluten free, but forgot the xanthan gum, so if it doesn't come out right I'm not going to blame the recipe for it. It's in the oven now so I haven't tried it but I tasted the batter and it was pretty good. A bit of a spicy kick, but still good. Will probably make again.

I upped the spices, except for the cloves.  About double for the cinnamon and maybe 1/4 tsp more for the ginger (I was nearly out and just used the rest of what I had).  I also added in about 1/4 cup of applesauce (I used one single-serve cup of applesauce) and cut the salt in half.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  It was delicious!

Took the advice of previous reviewers and doubled up on the spices.  Turned out really well except that I should have taken it out of the oven at 50-55 minutes rather than leaving it in for the full hour.  May be just my oven.  Will definitely trying this one again!

This is a pretty good recipe but not quite as robust as I would have liked.

Very good, kids gobbled it all up kept asking for more! I messed up on the measurements a little and added 1/2 cup of milk to it and used a bread pan. Will try harder next time to keep with exact recipe. I will cook again.

Something happened! The batter was a bit salty, not overwhelmingly so, but it didn't have the sweet taste I expected! Any advice?

Great, traditional gingerbread cake.  Dense and flavorful.  I had to use  8x8 pan and it still turned out great, nice and thick.  Will bake again!

Per previous reviews, I doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also did not set the timer for
1 hour and then walk away. I checked the cake from time to time until it was just about done and then took it out. This is absolutely delicious!!! My only frustration with it is that, as written, the cake overflows the pan. Maybe it's my altitude; I don't know. So instead of a lovely gingerbread smell filling my house, it smells like a campfire. :) Nevertheless, the gingerbread comes out tasting like Christmas and making you crave more. My recommendation is to use a 9X13 instead of a 9-inch square pan if you find that the batter comes almost all the way to the top of the pan. If I need to double the recipe, I'm not sure what I'll use that's larger than a 9X13 and deep enough, but it will definitely be worth finding out. This recipe's a keeper!

This was absolutely, positively delicious. I doubled the spices. The whole house smelled incredible. And, the taste after it came out of the oven--scrumptious! Thanks for the recipe! This may become a holiday classic.

I made this after reading the suggestions!!  I doubled the ginger and cinnamon, used real butter, and added a 1/2 cup of applesauce!!  I'm making it again today!! Just came over here for the recipe!!!  And it is better if you make it a day ahead!! more mellow! I just put whipped topping on it!!  no need for sauces!  they just take away from the wonderful flavor!

This cake came out very good.  I changed a few things- used canola oil instead of butter (I was out). I needed to replace the egg because of an allergy, so I used 1/4 cup applesauce mixed with 1 teaspoon of baking powder, set aside to activate and then added when the egg was supposed to be added. I followed one reviewer's suggestion of using a cup of hot chai tea instead of plain hot water.  The cake only baked for 45 minutes and that was almost too long.  Nice flavor and came up nice and spongy- in my opinion, the perfect cake texture!  Tasted great warm with vanilla ice cream!

I have never been a huge molasses fan, but this cake was delish.  I used a 1/2 C of canola oil versus butter and I used an 8x8 pan.  I baked it for an hour exactly and it turned out great!  I tried a little bit the night I baked it and the flavor is definitely better the next day.  More mellow and the flavors have all mingled together, plus the texture is better.

I LOVE gingerbread and couldn't wait to give this a try.  I didn't have quite enough molasses for the recipe, but I think the full amount would be WAY too much - the molasses flavor was a bit strong.  I really enjoyed the gingerbread though.  It seems to be an acquired taste, as none of my family or friends wanted to try it!

I added more spices and not quite as much molasses as it called for.  It was good but next time I think I'll make it with a brandy sauce.

Excellent, just the right texture and taste. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices and it was perfect.

This was a easy recipe and it was PERFECT!  Husband and brother 2 thumbs up. I always review before making and I tried a cup of hot coffee instead of water and doubled the spices and 40 mins cooking time. Wonderful.. already in my recipe book!!!  Thank you very much

This was an easy recipe and my family loved it!!   I changed the recipe by doubling it, then only using 1/2 the butter and subbing 1/2 c applesauce for the other half of the butter and I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices.  It was delicious served with a dollup of fresh whipped cream!!

I have tried many recipes on this site and this is the 1st one I have felt compelled to review. 
Absolutely fantastic!
have made this 3 times in 2 weeks, (husband keeps taking some into work for his mates)
only suggestion is to double up on the spices.

Definately a first rate recipe. I followed some earlier suggestions and instead of butter used half oil and half applesause and for the spices, I doubled them all for an excellent gingerbread. My husband just loves it. We will keep this as a favorite family recipe.

Very good.  It wasn't as moist as I had expected but that could have been my oven's fault.  We added whipped cream on top which made it perfect.  Good flavor.
