To my mind, not at all like Salisbury Steak.  This was very, very good on its own.  I cooked on low in the crockpot for 8 hrs; dredged the meat in flour and seasoned salt, then browned, then layered in crockpot with onion and all the liquid called for.  
After 8 hours, I pulled everything out and made a delicious gravy with the liquid.  The cube steak was falling apart as it was being served - I've never had such great-tasting, tender cube steak!  I served with buttered egg noodles and brussel sprouts.  Yum!

Cube steaks are tough and very bland so they need lots of "doctoring." This recipe adequately tenderizes the steaks, but contributes hardly any flavor. The only seasoning is a bit of Worchestershire. Even after adding salt and pepper, my family found the meat and gravy to be ho hum. Another problem with this recipe is the gravy prep. When making gravy properly you blend flour with fat and get a smooth paste before adding liquid. This recipe has you add flour to the fat AND broth so the flour immediately clumps up. The solution would be to retain your pan drippings when you brown the meat, add flour to those drippings and then add broth last.

Yes, yes, yes!  These are soooo good.  Nice and warm and homey feeling.  I only use 4 cube steaks, dry onion soup mix instead of the onion (4 yr. old won't touch them), and add mushrooms.  All the other recipes I'd found called for mixing ground meat with bread crumbs, then frying, etc.  I call those meatloaves, not salisbury steak..lol.  Thank you, Nanci, for such a great comforting recipe. *Update* : I've found that seasoning the steaks before you dredge them in flour makes them even better.  I just use salt, pepper, and garlic powder, but you could use whatever you like.  I have also started thickening the broth with a cornstarch/water mixture.  That way, you definitely don't get any lumps from the flour.

I have made this twice using 4 cube steak.  First time I added quartered mushrooms and chopped the onion instead of slicing.  Came out pretty good so I tried again.  Second time I omitted to worchershire, chopped the onion and sliced 8 oz mushrooms.  Seasoned steaks with salt and pepper and then dredged in flour and browned. Then I added onions and sauted until limp and then added mushrooms and lightly browned.  Added two cans beef stock, salt & pepper to tasted and added 1/4 teas. garlic powder. Simmered on stove for 2 hours.  Last 30 minutes of simmering, I removed some broth and blended well with 1 tables cornstarch and returned to pan and continued simmering 30 minutes.  Served with mashed potatoes and sauted zuchinni.  Great gravy! Thanks so much for submitting.

My family loved it. Used lipton onion soup mix instead of onions. And served with rice. Was very tender and my husband asked for more. Didn't make enough gravy for my family so I made our favorite packaged gravy and mixed it in with the gravy as noted in the recipe. Turned out perfect. This is a keeper in our home.

This was great but I only really used it for cooking technique. I used New York Steaks pounded and cut in thirds. More seasoning all around:  about a teaspoon each of celery salt, garlic salt, fresh ground pepper in the flour.  Added about 2 Tbsp. fresh rosemary, then some thyme and bay leaf sprinkles,  and 2 cloves garlic to the broth.  Used one fewer spoons of Worchester -- because of other comments. And splashed in about 1/4 cup cabernet sauvignon-- to make sure it tenderized.  Great flavor.  Also strained and de-fatted the remaining broth after adding flour and whisking.  Made the gravy very smooth. Placed steaks back in gravy to serve.   Will continue to tweak, but really good start. Great comfort food. Update -- Now, I saute the onions in the pan after browning to scrape up the bits of goodies on the pan, then deglaze with a splash or two of red wine. Bring to boil to cook out a bit of the alcohol, then add the broth and other seasoning. Also, if you're using an iron skillet (recommend), you might need a bit more broth if the pan is larger...

This recipe smelled so good cooking and the first few bites were great, then the Worcestershire sauce started overpowering the dish.  I would make this again, but cut the Worcestershire sauce back to maybe one teaspoon, or not use it at all.  All in all, it was an easy dish to make and the meat was fork tender.

This was a VERY decent dish.  I only had three cube steaks, so I scaled the recipe.  I also omitted the onion as my daughter wouldn't eat them.  I used parsley, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper to season the flour then dredged and cooked everything on the stove in a can of beef stock, then thickened with the remaining flour as needed.  It was YUMMMMMMM over the steaks and some baked potatoes.  Thanks!

OK, so here's the deal.  I had all of the ingredients except the beef broth.  So I improvised.  I used 1 cup water, 1 cup white wine and 3 beef bouillon cubes (the little ones).  I did season each piece of meat as I was frying it with garlic salt and McCormick Season All.  All I can say is "Oh My God!!!"  My husband had 3 1/2 pieces.  It came out really good.  I also did NOT make the gravy since the wine was going to add flavor to it.  Totally YUMMY!  With my changes it's a definite 5 star meal. Oh, and I only baked it for 1 1/2 hrs. We were hungry.  Still very tender and moist. No need for 2 hours especially if you cook it covered.

I think Anne Marie's comments were a little harsh. I made this just last night, and it was delicious! I'm not a big fan of cube steaks, but my husband is, and we both enjoyed this very much! Our "steaks" had tons of flavor just from the beef broth. (I used Better than Bouillon). I did add a bit of cayenne to the dredging flour (I married a Cajun!)...but if you're worried this won't have enough flavor for your liking, spice up the dredging flour a little. I will most definitely be making this again....soon!

This tasted really good. It does take some time to make but if you have the time it's worth it. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the time. My family really enjoyed it. Thank you.

AS IS, this is a 3-star recipe. It is too bland and too time consuming given that the flavor is just so-so.  That said, the best ideas I have seen are to season the beef before dredging in flour and add some other seasonings. It IS a good starter recipe, but not good enough to repeat AS IS.

This was absolutely delicious!  I had to use more oil than called for for the frying. I also seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, and garlic powder with parsley on both sides before I breaded it with the flour.  I used 3 onions and a large can of mushrooms in the layering.  Since we like a lot of gravy I added some water to the beef sauce in the pan (after I removed the meat, onion and mushrooms at the end of the 2 hrs. cooking time) added some more salt and pepper, and enough flour to make it thick.  After it was the consistency I wanted, I returned the meat etc. to the pan with the gravy and returned it to the oven on 225 for another hour.   Turned out EXCELLENT!  I don't like Round Steak, but this was enough to change my mind!

Po-mans Salsbury!  Yummy!  I was tempted to put in some red wine and fresh mushrooms much as the orginal recipe but deceided to leave it alone.  Canned mushrooms worked excellent!  Today was my second time using this recipe and I am soooo impressed!  Thank you Nanci!

My family REALLY loved this recipe!  Its a comfort food that will stay in my recipe box.  I didn't need as much flour as called for.  I would like to make this in the slow cooker next time.  I used beef broth because we like the flavor and used some beef gravy mix that I make (from the Make a Mix book).  The gravy mix added quite a bit of flavor in my opinion.  I also added a splash of soy sauce.  I feel this is a kid friendly recipe and my kids, grandkids would eat this in a flash.

This one was fork tender, but I had a couple of issues.  First, I too added seasoning to the flour.  Salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  I was a little concerned when I put it all in my dutch oven that the broth wasn't completely coving the meat.  I put it in at 350 for the alloted time and when I pulled it out almost all the broth had evaporated.  If I did this again I would completely cover my meat and onions with the broth and turn the oven way down to maybe 300.  350 for 2 hours is a long time.  My oven temp is spot on and I use very good enamel pots.  I was able to salvage the gravy by adding the rest of my box of beef broth and heating it up.  I had no issue with whisking the leftover flour into my pot and getting it to thicken without lumps.  Thanks for sharing.

Like others here, I made it a bit different.  I marinated the steaks in soy sauce and smoke flavoring the night before.  I used one envelope of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and two cups water instead of broth.  I baked in glass pyrex dish for only one hour with foil on top.  Very tasty!

Really really tender and yummy.  I agree with reviews about seasoning before flouring - used plenty of garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  Also agreed on lumpy gravy - the flour coating does clump off when cooking.  I ended up straining the gravy into a saucepan and also strained off the layer of fat.  I added more broth as we like extra gravy.  I thickened it up with a mixture of flour and cold water which I whisked into the gravy (over med. heat).  We didn't love the strong Worchestershire sauce flavor so will use a little less next time.  All in all... it's a keeper :)

Decided to use this recipe for venison cube steaks. Very good the first time around, the second time around I added some cooking wine and sliced red peppers; it was even better and has been requested by my children at least once a week!

Very tender!  It reminded me of my mom's cube steak, but this was much simpler.  Mom does it on the stove top and cooks for about an hour instead of two.  I felt that the seasoning would be lacking so I added salt and pepper to the steak and seasoned the flour with salt pepper and about 1/2 ts of garlic powder.  Also included mushroom when I added the onion.  We enjoyed the gravy with rice.

I am giving this a 5 because this cooking method by far produces the most tender cube steak.  However, like other reviewers, I am big on flavor so I did season the steaks after frying with salt, coarse ground pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, Tony's seasoning and coriander.  I also added a little sherry to the gravy and a few more spices to perk it up.  Bravo for finding a way to make this inexpensive cut of meat tender!  I plan to experiment with it a little more by adding mushrooms, fresh garlic and a little more onion.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is excellent.....  I did season the salisbury steak overnight though with some of my usual seasonings, but otherwise I followed the rest of the directions to the T.  Will definitely make again, my husband and 3 boys loved it...

I was very satisfied with how this turned out. I salted and peppered the steaks liberally before flouring.  I floured them, chopped an onion and some mushrooms, and then floured a second time.  After browning in a large skillet, I removed the steaks and added the onion and some mushroom to the skillet, put the steaks back in, and instead of using beef broth, I used an equal amount of water and a packet of beef/mushroom gravy.  This removed the need to make a gravy afterward.  My skillet has a lid and the whole thing went into the oven -  two hours seemed about right to me -  it was great.  Hubby wanted more, this is a keeper.  Just make sure you season the steaks well and don't be stingy with the worcestershire.

This is so good!  I actually put all of the ingredients in my slow cooker and left it there while I was gone to work.  The steaks cooked about 8 hours and then when I got home, I made the gravy.  This is definately a keeper recipe in our house!  Thank you!!

I love Salisbury steak and I thought this was an easy way of making them. I only made 3 steaks, but kept everything else the same.  I liked the way the onions caramelized after baking.

My mother used to make cube steaks when I was a kid.  I remember chewing and chewing and chewing and practically needing the heimlich maneuver when it came time to swallow.  I don't know if it was notalgia or a momentary lapse in sanity that made me buy the dreaded meat at the store.  But I did. 

I decided not to fry like mom did, and found this recipe to discover they should be slow cooked.  The only addition for my dinner was I added portabella mushroom slices with the onions.  It was amazing.   Tender, tasty meat and a lovely brown gravy.  I rate this 5 stars for simplicity, flavor, and I will use it often.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good, easy to make.  We order a side of beef and I usually have so many round steaks I get sick of them.  This is definitely something I will make oveer and over again.

We really liked this one! The meat was tender and flavorful! The fam doesn't care much for Onions so I substituted 1 package Onion soup mix and 1/3 cup cooking Sherry. I thought it was a little salty but my husband thought it was perfect. (Next time I'll use 1/4 cup) Even the kids liked it!

We all really liked this.  I added spices to the flour before I dredged the steaks.  And like other reviewers, I used beefy onion soup mix and brown gravy mix with about 2 cups of water.  The steaks were fork-tender and the gravy was already made!

This was very good,but did make some changes. Skipped the onion and beef stock-instead used a can of french onion soup,a can of golden mushroom soup and a can of beef gravy. Seasoned the meat AND the flour. 2 hours was perfect @ 350 degrees(as my oven seems to always cook"hotter") Might try this in a slow cooker next time.

The majority of my family loved this one! The cooking time is the key to this, it definately makes the cube steaks tender! I followed some of the other reviews and made sure the flour was really seasoned.  I added fresh mushrooms, cut back on the worchestershire sauce, added 1 pack of onion soup mix and prepared 2 packs of our favorite beef gravy.  I was hoping there would be leftovers for work the next day, but the family liked this too much to leave anything behind.

This has become one of the favorite recipes in my house! The only adjustment that I make is adding a packet of Onion soup mix, this gives it a nice taste! I do not have a dutch oven so I fry the beef in a frying pan and then put everything into a baking dish and pour the remaining oil from the frying pan into the baking dish. This is excellent with mashed potatoes, and the meat is so tender that it falls apart when I'm serving it! Absolutely delicious! It also can be adapted into a slow cooker if you don't have the time to stand by the oven, but I prefer it in the oven!

I browned meat in a skillet first, then cooked with remaininging ingredients in the slow cooker for about 5 hours.  I seasoned the meat with steak seasoning prior to coating with flour.

This was good! I tried it with a can of Campbell's French Onion soup, which added a lot of flavor but didn't turn as great as I imagined.  Next time it will be plain beef broth with a little extra water to bring it up to 2 even cups and cut down on some of the heavy saltiness of canned broth. I also swapped the onion slices for canned mushrooms which was marvelous! 

The sauce was thick enough right out of the oven but I would advise adding maybe a tablespoon or two of flour and ¼ - ½ cup of of flour to make it a little creamy. 

I took a hint from another reviewer and took an hour off the cooking time - don't do it! The steaks were tough. Even though I’m wary of it becoming too tender (I like cube steak a little bit chewy) I will definitely cook it the whole time and not uncover it next time. 

Thanks for the great recipe this isn’t as “sorta” as I thought it would be.

The best recipe for cube steak I've found!  I seasoned the meat w/seasoning salt, garlic salt, and pepper as I was browing it, then dredged it in flour.  For the 2 cups of stock, I added water to skillet I browned the meat in, then added a little more water to come to 2c.-delicious! I also thought the gravy was thick enough after cooking-I didn't add any additional flour.  Served it over mashed potatoes and peas and had a wonderful supper!  Thanks, this will definitely be "my" cube steak recipe!

We loved this recipe!  Instead of 2 cups beef broth, I used one 10.5 oz can of beef consomme soup and made up the rest with water.  The gravy turned out a beautiful, deep brown with a perfect consistency.  The cubed steaks were fork tender after 1-1/2 hours.  I served with mashed potatoes, steamed carrots, and hot yeast rolls.  Thank you Nanci for sharing!

This is one of my favorite beef recipes at All Recipes.  I make it with 4 - 6 cube steaks and use the largest sliced yellow sweet onion available. Vidalias are best in season (May).  For the beef broth I use a 10.5 oz. can of Beef Consomme' with 1 can of water added.  I always make this in a heavy Dutch oven.  Serve with mashed potatos slathered with the gravy and baby green peas. Oh, and don't forget to add some hot buttered biscuits. YUM!

I added a packet of dry onion soup and a bouillon cube with water instead of the broth. This was easy and yummy! The trick to getting this steak tender is the cook time.

Delicious! Maybe need to season the meat before browning it. Other than that, it was very good.
Update - 4/27/12 - Made this again for dinner and I seasoned the meat with garlic powder, salt, and pepper prior to flouring. Perfect meal! Thanks for the easy recipe!

Good basic recipe..but I also added spices to the dredging flour(as others have) then 2 tblsp of Kitchen Bouquet in the broth(makes it a darker broth/gravy) with a tblsp of liquid smoke, as well as an extra can of beef broth...then I divided a bag of frozen mixed veggies(peas, corn, carrots, beans), with the onion layers...YUMMO ! :-)

Made as directed and the cube steaks were fork tender with decent flavor.  Will probably make again as this was really easy.

I made this because I had some beef that was a bit too tough. I wanted a recipe that required a slower/longer cooking time. So I gave this a try. Even though I did not use cube steak, the recipe turned out to be all I expected and more. It was very good. Ill make it again in a few days and I will be using the called for cube steak and expect it will be even better. Thank you for the recipe.

Yum!  I did season the steaks with garlic powder and season salt before dredging in the flour, and I used a little less Worcestershire (because I ran out)... meat was very tender!

Wonderful and tasty!  I doubled the beef stock and Worcestershire sauce for extra gravy.  So tasty.  I've made this twice in the last two weeks.  I didn't want to turn the oven on as it's still hot here in Florida - I used an electric skillet and it came out fork tender.  You won't regret trying this recipe.

Very tender. I used water, 1 pkg onion soup mix, and 1 pkg brown gravy. Baked for only 2 hours and no need to make gravy after. Just serve as is, the gravy made itself.

I didn't give it five stars since I altered the recipe.  It was great.  I didn't coat the steaks, I lightly fried them in olive oil until browned.  Took them out and sauted the onions for a couple of minutes.  Then added cubes potatoes to the onions.  I added the steaks back in and poured the beef stock and worchestershire sauce over the top.  Covered with foil (I used a cast iron skillet, so no lid) and cooked in the oven for 2 hours.  Next time I will add carrots to it too.  I used the broth and flour to make a pan gravy, which is a little more runny than thick.  Very tasty.  Oh and one last thing, I seasoned the meat with pepper, garlic, and season salt before I fried them.

This was a perfect cold night, warm tummy meal!  Be sure to season the steaks as you brown.  And double check the seasoning again as you make the gravy.  I used low sodium beef broth to keep it from getting too salty, then added a pinch to the gravy.  I also added fresh mushrooms with the onions.  To add the flour without lumps, mix 2 heaping TBSP flour with about 1/2 C cool water in a shaking jar (cleaned jam jar, gladware container, canning jar with lid etc.)  Shake until the flour is incorporated (no lumps) and add about half to the boiling cooking broth with fast stirring.  Let boil a bit to check how thick it will be and add more if necessary.

This recipe was awesome, my family really enjoyed it! I followed it just as stated, with the exception of seasoning the meat with salt, pepper & garlic powder before coating it in flour. Thanks for a great recipe for cubed steaks, we'll be making this again!

I noticed that some of the reviewers complained about the meat being dry and bland. I always use a recipe as a guide, meaning if it seems to be lacking enough seasoning, I add more. I did add additional seasonings and I cooked it for an hour and a half. I also made a paste using cornstarch instead of flour and added it to the broth. It had just the right amount of thickness. My husband liked this recipe so much that he asked for seconds. This is something I will be making often. It was very good. Thank you!

Very simple and easy!  I chose to cook this in a crock-pot (my 18-month old son makes cooking right before dinnertime a challenge :)  
I did take the advice of seasoning the beef (onion powder, garlic powder and fresh black pepper) before rolling it in flour.  I also browned it in Olive Oil before putting in the crock pot.  I then added the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, onions and mushrooms.  It cooked for eight hours...served it over mashed potatoes and with brocolli.  My husband asked to put it on the rotation!  Easy and delicious.

I made this today and my family loved it.  Like other users, I seasoned the meat before dredging in flour.  I also added mushrooms.  I like the fact that after browining,the dish pretty much cooks itself. I popped it in the oven and then went shopping.  When I came home, it was ready and delicious.

Too bland. I kind of like the idea but the meat turns out so bland. If i ever make it again i will probably season the meat differently and i will make the dish in a skillet at low heat.

Yum, yum, YUM!  Awesome steaks!  I made as directed, made my beef broth with boullion, and only used 4 steaks.  I cannot wait to make this again.  So good over rice.  The whole family gobbled these up.  I didn't even put knives on the table, we didn't need them.  I may try a little bit more broth next time, just to increase the gravy a little bit, and maybe fresh mushrooms, but other than that, wouldn't change a single thing.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I never realized cube steak coud be this good! What a wonderful recipe! Thank you so much Nanci. I did add 3 teaspoons of minced garlic (we love it)but that's it. Very easy to follow, and we were amazed you CAN cut it with a fork!

I used venision cube steak and couldn't tell the difference!  This was great. I cooked it for only 1 hour in a Dutch oven in the oven.  I made more gravy using a mixture of chicken and beef broth and extra flour in the drippings.  My family loved it - this is a keeper!

Delicious. I used only 16 oz. of meat, but still used a full can of beef broth cos I didn't know what I was going to do with 2/3 cup of broth. I added a little pepper and cooked covered for one hour, uncovered for 20 minutes, served with mashed potatoes, and it was perfect.

I was very impressed with this recipe. Like other reviewers, I made this in the crockpot. The meat came out so tender that I could pull it apart with a fork. I did add about 1/2 t black pepper, 1/4 t paprika, and 1/4 t thyme to the gravy just to spice it up a bit. It's excellent served with white rice.

These are great and easier to make than "regular" salisbury steak.  The only change I made was to add lots of fresh, sliced mushrooms in the layers with the onions.  YUM!!

This turned out pretty good. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy just to thicken it up some.

Pretty good, enough unlike the TV dinner type salisbury steak that I gave it a try. I salted and peppered the steaks before coating them in flour. The kids all ate it, which makes it a winner in my book. P.S. I just made this for the second time and increased the worchestershire sauce to 3 Tbs. That brings it up to a "5 star" recipe! We had no leftovers!

This is ultimately the best Salsberry steak ever I will definitely be making this up again I will for sure forgo the ground beef and used chop steak forever! The only thing different I will do is add a little seasoning to the gravy because it was slightly bland but other than that awesome!

It's fantastic!!  I wanted the Salisbury steak taste but had no hamburger on hand and did have these cube steaks (4).  The only thing i did different was throw in an envelope of Lipton onion soup mix and keep the cast iron skillet on the stove top.  It was so good!!   My gravy was fantastic!!  thank you this one's a keeper!!  i do not know what the people that said it was not flavorful did wrong.....

this was good.. gave it only 4.. because I took some advice from reviews.. I had deer cube steaks & I did  seasoned them heavy.. used onion powder, garlic salt, pepper, and a little Cayanne pepper .. used one small onion 2 cloves chopped garlic and mushrooms,  a packet of Lipton onion soup mix, mixed that well with beef broth..I used 1tbs of Worcestershire, after arranging it in a Dutch oven I poured 1/2 can of beer.. I did not have anything left over for gravy so I just use what  that I had on hand.. I do have to  say that mine 10-year-old and five-year-old gobbled it up and asked for seconds!! so winner in the cookbook.. thanks for sharing!!

I made these in the crockpot, like a previous post suggested.  Added a couple chopped cloves of garlic, a small can of sliced mushrooms, and some garlic salt, onion powder, & black pepper.  I used cornstarch to make a gravy at the end of cooking.  Delicious!!!  Cube steaks were so tender they were falling apart.  Great gravy!

I used a tbsp. each of EVOO and butter and seasoned the flour with salt/pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, basil and oregano. I used one can of Campbell's double strength beef broth.  I didn't bake mine, just cooked it on the stove for an hour or so after I browned the cube steaks. (It was too hot to turn the oven today.) This was good for a quick meal with few ingredients right before Grocery Day. My family enjoyed it. I think it would have been bland if I hadn't seasoned the dredge. This really did remind me of something Mom would have made when I was a kid. This was very cheap and filling dish to make.

I doubled this recipe so I could freeze enough for 2 people in individual freezer bags. Wonderful when you are in a hurry.  I also added sliced mushrooms. Added  some wine to the broth.

The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is our cube steaks fell apart.  The taste was great and we served it over mashed potatoes.  We did chop up some cremini mushrooms and added those with the onions in layers.  I also used bullion paste to make the stock.  We didn't even need the flour in the end as it was thick enough.  I'm really looking forward to leftovers.

I LIKE OTHER REVIEWERS SEASONED MY FLOUR WITH GARLIC POWDER, PEPPER AND ONION POWDER TO THE GIVE THE MEAT MORE FLAVOR. MY HUBBY REALLY LIKED THE DISH.  MY ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THAT THE FLOUR CAME OFF OF THE MEAT AND WAS JUST FLOATING IN THE POT (NOT SURE IF ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS ISSUE) SO WHEN IT CAME TIME TO SEPARATNG THE MEAT AND ONIONS FROM THE SAUCE- IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT.  THE GRAVY AFTERWARDS WAS VERY DELICIOUS. THX

Half way through cooking, the house was filled with a wonderful arome and we could not wait to eat.  It is easy and wonderful but make more gravy and serve it over rice. You will love it.

I love this recipe.  I used a packet of onion soup mix though, because I thought the onions would be too much for the kids.  My husband loves this recipe!  We live on a ranch so we have alot of beef and its always nice to find something interesting to do with round steak.

Thank you my family loved it. My husband has always loved cube steak and I just didn't know how to cook it right. He ate every bite and i wished I had made more. We're gluten free so I used a gluten free flour and it turned out great. What a nice recipe for these  budget times.

Sorry for the previous mistake of only 1 star...my  mistake that seems I could not edit!    Another good one...because of my daughter's intolerance to wheat, I used Pamela's Baking Mix in place of the flour and added seasonings, browned the 8 cubes of steak, put it in 3 c. of beef broth and added just a touch of Worcestershire sauce. Simmered on the stove for 2 hours, and at the end used some cold water with cornstarch and added to the pot. Served over mashed potatoes...yummy and easy!!!!!

This recipe is fantastic. I followed Nette's suggestion to use additional spices and also spice up the flour. Then used two Knorr's beef bullion cubes and four cups of water to make more gravy. I also de-fatted the broth but I did it before adding the flour. Also, I took about 1/2 cup of de-fatted broth, added the flour and then whisked it and added it to the remaining  broth to make the gravy.  Not a lump in sight.

I made this recipe exactly as is, and my family raved and asked (as they were eating it) when they could have it again!!! When preparing the steaks, I salt and peppered each side before I floured and fried. It similar to chicken fried steak how it is floured and fried, but a great alternative to the white gravy. Plus if you cook it for as long as the recipe says, it comes out really tender. A pot of mashed potatoes is just the thing to go with it. Another family favorite, thank you!

We had gotten 1/4 of a cow from my fiance's uncle who raises cows so we had a few of these cube steaks that I didn't know what to do with because they always turn out tough and bland. This recipe didn't really help it. I could blame my steaks but I know that we have really good cuts of meat because every thing else we have is awesome. This was just bland, even the gravy, and I even added garlic while searing the steaks on the stove. It didn't really give the steaks any flavor and they were still tough. It wasn't the worst cube steak I've ever eaten, but it wasn't really good either. sorry.

I have made this a few times now and it gets rave reviews always. I like that it is so easy and prep time is minimal. Had my sister over for dinner one night and she loved it. I serve it with a salad and mashed potatoes!!! Truly a comfort food.

My husband loved this.  I thought the gravy was really thick and that was before adding flour so I didn't add any more.  I served it over noodles and it was really good.  I thought that it was a little on the salty side but I may have added a little too much boullion to my water (substituted for the beef broth).  Would make this again.

Very easy recipie to follow however, it left the meat rather dry. Perhaps with some "tweaking" I might be able to solve that dilemma.

This was an okay dish.  Everyone ate all their food but it was missing something.  I added extra worchestire sauce but it was still bland.  Next time I think I'll take the advice of others and season the steak before coating it in flour.  I also think I'll add mushrooms to the dish.  Another thing I'd probably add is an envelope of dried onion soup mix to add just a little more flavor.  Not bad for a starting recipe but you need to tweak it a bit.

This didn't "WOW" me but my hubby liked it. I seasoned the meat with cajun seasoning and onion powder before browning. I also added a can of mushrooms and used 2 onions. I think it would be better over mashed potatoes (we had it over pasta)I may try it again because I like the part of putting it in the oven for 2 hours to get it tender.

My family loved these. I have made them about 5-6 times now and just forgot to come back and review. I gave it four stars because it's a great starter but needs flavor. I did add seasoning to the flour before I dredged the steaks in it. I added pepper, garlic powder, and seasoned salt. I also made the gravy the proper way (on the stovetop with drippings) rather than have a lumpy mess at the end. I served this with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. Also good with sweet white rice. YUM. Sounds like dinner for tonite!

My husband's favorite food is cubed steaks, but to me, they always come out tough. Not anymore! These are extremely tender and very flavorful! I added garlic salt to the steaks, but made the rest as written. I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could!

This is the first recipe I tried from this site, and boy was it good!! I cooked mine in a crock pot like other poster's did. I added seasoning (seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic) to meat before dipping in flour. This was so good and tasty, will make again.

I really like this recipe, since I'm not a mushroom fan, since it doesn't call for mushrooms, plus it's easy to make with cube steaks rather than combining ground meat with egg, etc.  I add 1/2 tsp. each of salt and pepper to the flour.  I didn't have much liquid left after cooking so I added only a few tbsp. of reserved flour and some milk to create a nice gravy. Near the end I added an additional 1 tsp. worstershire sauce just for personal preference, though I'm sure it would have been fine without.  I ended up with a little extra gravy but when has that ever been a problem?  Very good, very simple, very inexpensive.  Thanks Nanci!

I have prepared this dish with both mashed potatoes and egg noodles and it was excellent either way. I did add some garlic and seasoned salt but only because I like the taste that evolves. I do most of the cooking and my wife and grand kids ask for it a lot.thanks nancy

I really wanted this to turn out, and it didn't. My husband who is the human garbage can took one bite and said he'd eat no more. I think it was the texture of the meat. We will not make this again.

years ago my former mother-in-law gave me her recipe for "swiss steak" which was similar to this one. her recipe called for dredging both the beef & onions in flour (which i did). note: remember to scrape up all those brown crunchies in your pot after frying the cubed steak. these leftover meat bits are an essential part to making a good gravy. thanks nanci!

I hate to be in the minority, but we just didn't care for this.  The first couple of bites were great and then it was "how do I finish this".  My husband who usually will eat anything without complaint said we could get rid of this recipe.  Maybe we're just not cube steak people.  Sorry!

Fantastic, easy dish. Although it does cook quite a while, the prep work is so minimal and the food is so good, this has quickly become a family favorite. We make it with beef tips and the meat just falls apart. I will be making this for years to come. Thank you!

Really good.  Husband liked a lot and said it warm comfort food.  I added s+p and a little garlic powder.  Other than that, just followed the recipe.  Very easy and very good.  Tasted great with mashed potatoes.  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is good, it is just not fantastic or anything. I ended up adding more broth at the end so there would be more of the gravy. I also added salt, pepper, and garlic because I thought it was lacking something. I'll probably make it again! Thanks!

Like another reviewer, I prepared this in a crockpot.  The meat was very tender but I would say the gravy could use more seasoning.  Extra pepper and some garlic might be good.

It tasted more like a roast than salsbury steak. I thought the meat was tender, but for flavor..it just didn't taste like salsbury steak to me..not even 'sorta'.

I gave this 5 stars because it is one of the easiest and best tasting cubed steaks I have made.  It's very tender and flavorful.  I served this with the honey mustard roasted potatoes and it was very well received.  My family doesn't like gravy so I omitted the final step and just served with the juices in the pan.
