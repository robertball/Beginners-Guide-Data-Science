YUMMO! I made two different batches. One I made as written and the other I used tarragon instead of rosemary. Both were equally delicious. I do recommend rubbing a little oil on the peel part that is facing up so that it doesn't get all dried out. I will make these often! PS-they didn't even need cheese or sour cream but just a little salt and pepper.
