I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and he rated it as better than German chocolate, which has been his favorite since I have known him!  Thanks for the new and interesting recipe.  I will make it again!

Wow! I can not believe more members and visitors to allrecipes.com have not tried this keeper.  I found it easy to make, great looking and great tasting. The chocolate glaze compliments this nicely nutty cake in such a pretty way that it makes it wonderful for entertaining.

One of the best, quickest and child friendliest recipes ever. My kids and me loved it, we just ate it in 2 hours, this says a lot, they usually dont like sweet stuff. The kids I babysit love it too.

This is ridiculously good. I whipped it up last-minute after being asked to bring a dessert to an impromptu going-away party, as these were the ingredients that I had on hand. I brought it to the party where it was devoured, and immediately made another one the following day that we DIDN'T need to share! My only adjustment was to add organic hazelnut extract to up the hazelnut flavor, about 2-3 tsp.

great tasting cake! I love hazelnuts so I added nutella to the glaze as well as made a middle using marscapone cheese, powdered sugar and fangelico. Split the cake in half and spread. This one's a keeper.

This cake is "so friggin' good" (to quote my husband).  By far the best way I have found to use up the huge bagful of hazelnuts that my mother-in-law dropped off a few weeks ago.  Although shelling the nuts takes a bit, the cake itself is quick and easy to throw together. I had wanted to make the glaze as well, but realized too late that I didn't have any cream, so instead I added a half cup of mini chocolate chips to the batter and left the finished cake plain.  I did not have high expectations when I took it out of the oven because it looked really hard on the top, but after it cooled and we tasted it, it is sooooooooooo good.  I cooked mine a half hour and having left it a little tiny bit underdone made it almost have a "brownie-like" consistency.  Very good...one of the best cakes I've had.

This is incredible-lots of flavor and not too sweet.  I used almonds; pistachio or pecans would also be quite good.  In fact, maybe even peanuts would make an interesting variation.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Fantastic tasting cake and the texture is great. It makes a great dessert to impress guests with. I was all out of cream and had no way to get some, so I made a chocolate pate, sprinkled icing sugar on the cake and served it with the chocolate. Was still delicious. Thanks for this one!

I had a bunch of hazelnuts I needed to do something with (sent hubby to the store for 1/2 cup of hazelnuts, he came back with 5 cups!). So I tried this recipe.  I thought it was really good.  I was a little nervous when it cooled and was hard on top, but it turned out great, and it was easy.  I will definitely make this again. Next time I'll try some Frangelico in the glaze for a little more hazelnut kick.  Since it is dense I made up the extra whip cream I had, and that went really well with it.

If you like a dry cake (which my husband from Germany does like) then you will enjoy this one. I served it with whipped cream which we agreed helped it a lot. It was not my personal favorite but again my husband really enjoyed it b/c it was his taste.

FYI, if you sub the chocolate chips for 1 cup of Nutella it makes the glaze even more amazing!

My family's most requested dessert for birthdays and special occasions! Those who prefer moist and fluffy cakes will be disappointed: this cake is all about dense and intense, with a magnificent crust that might strike you as dry if you're looking for soft. I adore the texture and flavor of this cake; that it's gorgeous and dead easy to make is just icing on top.

This was a HUGE hit. The cake could have been just a little more moist, but I might have just baked it too long. Otherwise, incredible. Rave reviews from family and friends.

I've made this twice for dinner with friends, and it was a big hit!   I used hazelnuts that we brought back from Italy, and they were wonderful!  I like that the cake isn't too sweet.  I would make it again to take to a gathering of friends!

The base turned out nice crumbly, however it's a little hard. I added a bit syrup to make it a bit soft. 
Also as soon as the cake was out I generally tend to add the frosting so the moisture is captured immediately. 
Also the frosting that I made was not the one showcased in this recipe. Made one without the milk, recipe from the same website.

Excellent cake.  I just chopped the hazelnuts and used a spoon to beat - so easy.
