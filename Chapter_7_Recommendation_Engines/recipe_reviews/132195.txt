These were absolutely fantastic.  I often substitute butter for shortening, but I didn't for this recipe, and I am very glad.

I found them best after they had fully cooled.  After about a day, the outside was crunchy and the inside was like a chewy brownie.  The marbling of powdered sugar as the cookie expanded got lots of good reviews from my cookie eaters.

These are also fun to make with kids, as rolling the dough balls leaves a chocolate film on the hands -- slightly messy, but enjoyable!

This one is a keeper, but...  follow the recipe!  (you *must* chill the dough!)

This recipe is pretty tweakable. I used cocoa instead of chocolate and oil instead of shortening, and it was still great. Im glad I ran across this. Definitely worth it.

I have been making these cookies since I was a child! We call them Chocolate Crinkles. Couldn't find my recipe (until after I found this one) and it's almost exactly the same. We substitute 1/2 C cocoa plus 4 Tblspn shortening for the chocolate squares, and we don't add the baking powder. I tried that in there, and made no difference to the cookies. Baking on Parchment is a MUST - so much easier! OMG try Dark Cocoa instead and WOW yummy dark chocolate cookies!

WONDERFUL!  Made these for a party and they were the first to go (and there were lots of other cookies there!)  I followed exact but added a bit more flour because some people mentioned they spread, mine did not at all!  The key to this recipe is to make sure your dough is COLD when rolling (chill at least 3 hours) and do not OVERCOOK.  I only baked mine for 12 mins (and my cookies were big - I only got 3 doz out of this recipe) then allow to cool on the cookie sheet for 5-10 mins then remove to cooling rack until completely set.  They may not look completely done when you take them out but if you overbake these they will be so dry and awful.  And my kids had a ball rolling in the powdered sugar...so this is a keeper!

I've been making a similar cookie for years, which I got off of a box of margarine. The only difference is that I use melted margarine instead of shortening and I omit the nuts. They are easy and fun to make and deliciously chewy!

Growing up we called these Chocolate Crinkles.  I had an Aunt that made them for family gatherings.  I am so happy I found this recipe.  These are absolutely fabulous and taste just like I remember.  Some of the reviews said that these were dry, they won't be if you do not overcook them. Do not overcook these cookies, they should be lightly crisp around the edges and soft and gooey inside.  I timed them at exactly 7 minutes in my convection oven, then let them set for 2 minutes on the cookie sheet before removing.  I did not change a thing in the recipe!!!!

Delicious cookie and very attractive. 

I used butter instead of shortening as I avoid transfat.

They spread quite a bit when you use butter and you MUST use either a silpat mat or parchment paper or you lose 10% of the cookie when you take it off the baking tray.

WAY TOO DRY, texture was like sawdust, and not much flavor.  Husband was not pleased.  I was ashamed of these cookies and I consider myself a reasonably good baker.  Will never make again!

I make these every Christmas. My family loves them. A couple of tips: 

- bake on parchment paper
- watch very carefully toward the end of baking.  If they're even slightly overbaked they will be dry.

And finally... press a Hershey's kiss into the center of still warm cookies.  Delicious!

The only drawback is that it's a time consuming process.

I am very impressed by these cookes. i cooked for exactly 12mins and took out (they look undercooked at that point but are fine once they cool).  They are soft, and yummy and great. I was worried they wouldnt have much flavor to them, since when i bake i always taste things as they are being made, and the dough wasnt exactly tasty (and i find i like even pancake batter) so i was half tempted to trash it and go make other cookes. so glad i didnt!  I guess its the confectionary sugar that makes them taste so good. they are great. Since it is fall and i wanted to make something cute, i added some orange food colouring to the confectionary sugar (took alot of work) but the orange and brown cookies were worth it all.   So good i am making more today.  Also LOVE that the number of cookes they suggest it will make is right on the money. i used half the recipe so should have gotten 24 cookies, i got 25 so that was great. Seeing as most recipes say 24 and i get something closer to 12.

I make these every year.  One of my husband's sisters got the recipe in her home ec class many years ago.  The only difference in the recipe is instead of shortening it uses the same amount of butter.  I've substituted shortening but I can taste the difference.  I omit the nuts and I roll my cookies into a ball about the size of a golf ball, then take them out while the center is still a little gooey since they still cook a bit while cooling. When it's holiday time, I always have friends call me to see if I've made them yet!

My mom made these quite a bit when I was growing up and I have carried on the tradition.  Our whole family loves these.   DO NOT OVERBAKE.

IF YOU OVERBAKE them they will be very dry.  When you take them out of the over the should look a little "wet" between the cracks and will be rather soft to the touch.  After cooling, they become firmer.

If these cookies didn't work for you the first time, get a good brand of chocolate and use BUTTER. I made these EXACTLY as the recipe says the first time through. Yuck. They stayed in ball form (I finally smashed them down with the bottom of a glass) and they were so dry. Second time making them I used half the recipe, but with a 1/2 cup butter, and melted that with 6 tbls of Ghirardelli cocoa powder (instead of squares). This made all the difference! Moist, and delicious. Chilling them is so important! Overnight if possible. Also, DO GREASE your cookie sheets. The powdered sugar really makes them stick. Promptly placing them on wire racks works best for me when cooling them.

They were okay, but not quite what I was looking for. The cookies like this I remember were more moist/chewy and these were a bit dry. I won’t make again.

I know many people loved these cookies, so remember that this is just my own personal opinion.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and did not leave out any ingredients.  These cookies looked fabulous and were most definitely moist, but I thought they lacked flavor and were a little bland.  If you are looking for a rich, chocolately cookie, this is not it.  If you want a mild chocolate flavor, this just might be the cookie for you.

I didn't enjoy these cookies.  All I could taste was sugar.  Texture was fine, but flavor wasn't there.  Probably would have been better if added some cocoa powder or used half butter half shortening.  Sorry, but I won't be making again.

What a great gift for my son this Christmas.  He was wanting recipes of his paternal grandmother.  All had been lost in a fire, this was among his favorite.  In the reviews I actually found the version of her recipe using cocoa instead of the chocolate squares. Made them and it is right on! Many thanks.

These cookies were rich and delicious and worth the small extra effort involved. I don't recommend only cooking half the dough and saving the rest for cooking later, though. My second batch, cooked a couple days later, were noticeably drier and crunchier.  But they were really great dipped in my coffee :)

We usually don't follow recipes exactly, we substitute with egg whites, applesauce, margarine, etc, but this time we decided to follow this recipe exactly. The cookies came out great, but they didn't taste as good as I would have liked for how many calories they have. They tasted like they were a lower fat/calorie version.

WOW! I made these the first time with cocoa powder. Everyone loved them but not as much as when I used half vanilla, half mint extract with white chocolate chips! They were so delicious! I am going to try with raspberry extract next! Thanks!!! These will be made often!

fantastic cookies.  I had the recipe once, but lost it.  You must follow the recipe exactly and watch your oven time - it is easy to overbake cookies.  These are just scrumptious, just like I remembered them.

These are delicious, attractive, chewy cookies that are a hit with everyone in my family and office. I used a 1" serving scoop to make it easier to create uniform balls of dough. Well chilled dough is key. I used a silpat baking mat and found that to be very helpful. We love these cookies!

Keeper enough said! It is just a very, very good recipe. I did keep the dough over night in the fridge and finished them in a little over an hour! I used semi-sweet chocolate that was the only one I had at hand at the moment and reduced the 2 cups of sugar to 1 1/2 cups and still was not too sweet. Next time if using semi-sweet chocolate I think I can still just use 1 cup of sugar and it will be still perfect as the little powdered sugar will compensate!

holy  on a cracker these cookies are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly. Next time I will leave them in for a little less time(oven runs hot)
Will definitely be making these again and again!

Tip- I noticed some reviewers saying they would leave the cookies on the baking sheet to cool. When my husband was helping me take them off the sheet we found the longer they stayed on the stickier they got (that was after heavily greasing them with cooking spray)so I would recommend getting them off the moment they come out the oven then letting them cool on a cooling rack.

I love these cookies, but I have modified the recipe slightly.
1/4 tsp salt
4 oz unsweetened chocolate
1 tsp vanilla
6-8 oz semi-sweet ghirardelli chocolate chips
Remove nuts

Melt unsweetened chocolate and shortening in Microwave. Beat in sugar. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Mix in vanilla. In a bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Pour in the egg mixture until smooth. Fold chocolate chips into dough. Chill dough in the refrigerator 3 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lay parchment paper on cookie sheets.
Place confectioners' sugar in a bowl. Roll dough into 1 inch balls. Roll 1 inch dough balls in confectioners' sugar to coat. Arrange 3 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Pick up parchment paper and transfer cookies from cookie sheet to wire rack.

Made these today for my daughter's bake sale at school..sure they'll love them! The one thing I did discover is that in between baking I had to return the dough into the fridge. It was sticky and hard to roll them, but otherwise a good recipe! of course I had to taste test them...mmmmmmm! lol!

These were good although mine were kind of hard. I might have overbaked them. It's easy to do because of the color.

Delicious and easy! I substituted half a cup of safflower oil for Crisco and it turned out fantastic! The cookies taste light and are not overly sweet due to using unsweetened chocolate. I highly recommend this recipe.

These were delightful! I needed to have left them in the fridge longer but I had a time constraint. They still tasted great; they were just stickier and more difficult to roll. Also, I substituted toffee bits for the chopped walnuts.

I thought these cookies turned out well, though next time i will bake them for a couple minutes less and maybe add chocolate chips for some added texture/flavor. They look very attractive.

These cookies were absolutely delicious! However, i used choco chips instead of choco bars... They were alot of fun to make too. In my opinion, they were better after they sat for a day.

I went strictly by the recipe and they turned out perfect.  Not a great baker so I was so happy with the results.  Taste was awesome and I will make them again.  I have cookie baking day at my Daughter's with her and the Granddaughter's and little Great Granddaughter's.  Can't wait to make these cookies with them. Thank you!

These came out great! Using a mini-baller with a squeeze handle that 'ejects' the dough into the powder sugar really helped minimize the sticky hands. Of course, powder sugar gets everywhere!

This recipe was delicious! I read the reviews and substituted the shortening for butter and baked them for 7 minutes instead of 10, but they came out a bit too chewy - but they were completely edible that way~! Next time I'll bake them for 10 minutes. Really a GREAT cookie. I will be making them again this week!!!

Made some like these years ago but had lost the recipe. My mom used to love them. This is it! I use half butter half margarine in place of the shortening, as I never seem to have shortening on hand, and they came out great. I also used cocoa and the addition of more margarine as I didn't have enough unsweetened chocolate. Good to know I can substitute. I made the first batch using only a rounded teaspoon, and then got lazy and made them a little bigger. I far prefer the smaller ones so next time I'll be more patient. Thanks for posting this!

I'm not sure what I did wrong but these did not turn out the way I thought they should. Although they puffed up in the oven, they turned flat as soon as I took them out. I was expecting a more soft and chewy type cookie. I put the dough in the fridge over night. I had to adjust the time for each batch since they were either too hard (and flat) or too soft (and flat) to put on the wire racks. Any tips would be appreciated.

I shaped my dough using a melon baller and experimented on the baking time. I followed the recipe and baked the cookies for 12 minutes at 350F and they were dry. At 9 minutes the cookies baked just right and turned out moist.

This is absolutely one of the best chocolate cookie recipes I've ever used!  I live in a 'developing' country and don't always have access to everything.  I substituted coco powder for the cooking chocolate and it worked perfectly.  Recipe is VERY versatile and is now one of my 'own'.  Thanks!

These were really yummy!  I had some trouble with rolling the dough into balls as it was very sticky but I didn't refrigerate it as long as recommended so it was probably my fault.

I followed the recipes exactly as written, only substituting pecans for walnuts.  The cookies came out awesome.  So tasty and they look great w/ my other Christmas cookies.  Definitely a keeper!
