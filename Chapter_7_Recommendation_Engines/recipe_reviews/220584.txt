This is soooo good! I add about a tsp of brown sugar to help caramelize the cabbage but still retain it's crisp/tender qualities. Brussel sprouts are TDF prepared like this. I half them, steam them for a short time then throw them in the skillet. My future daughter in law says, "I now like brussel sprouts!"

I love this recipe but I put onion and green peppers in the bacon drippings until they soften and then add the cabbage.

I've been making this for years..I shred the cabbage instead of chopping it cooks more evenly.
BIG TIP:  you can also use pre-shredded cabbage from the grocery store, which makes it fast and easy.
I add whatever I have avail. onion red or yellow, celery chopped finely.
I also have prefried bacon in my freezer which is very convenient.  And I keep the bacon grease in the refrigerator for seasoning other dishes. 
My husband loves this dish.  And even if you don't like cabbage, you may want to try this, it just might change your mind on cabbage.

Saute chopped onions with the cabbage and when everything is soft, mix it,along with the bacon,into mashed potatoes. That dish is called Colcannon and served with melted butter in a well you make on top of the potatoes! I make that every St Pat's Day along with Corned Beef Wellington!

My mom was from the south, we also ate this all the time. She later added tomatoes and we ate this over rice.  Brings back plenty of memories.

I made this for dinner tonight (wanting to get back to my southern roots). Oh my goodness, it didn't disappoint. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar when cooking the cabbage, just as my grandmother did. I saved the leftovers and plan to eat them for lunch tomorrow. I am in the process of trying to figure out how to add a picture. For the first time in a long time, I took a picture.

Now that I've found this recipe again, I just wanted to give a review.  I made this last night and it was yummy. I used 2 small heads of cabbage, so I doubled the bacon drippings amount. That was a bit much. Came out a lot greasier than I like but still edible. The only other minor changes I made were, I added 1 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and only crumbled 10 strips of bacon into the cabbage. Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will stick to the 1/4 cup of drippings.

I have been eating this most of my life. My best friend's mother made this and I loved it so she would make it when I went to visit. I make it exactly like this recipe and try to never make too much because I can't stop eating it! I like it alone or as a side dish. It's great with some boiled or fried potatoes. Meat is not needed for this meal because there's BACON!

I absolutely love fried cabbage and bacon, but for "Bubble and Squeak" you need very fine diced potatoes and l clove fine diced garlic, salt and pepper.  Don't OVERCOOK the cabbage.  It's fantastic with a little "bite" to it.

Raised in the South, we love our cabbage.. any way you fix it! I had to modify this recipe a bit with bacon drippings only since I didn't have any bacon on hand. My family loves everything spicy, so I seasoned it up with some garlic salt, salt and pepper, and a drop or two of liquid smoke flavoring. Then put a lid on and sauteed til wilted and crisp tender. YUM!!

Wow! This......was......amazing!!!!!! Our family has decided to call it cholesterol cabbage. Lol but man oh man did we all enjoy. The kids and the adults. Including my hubby who had sworn off cabbage after traumatic cabbage events in his childhood. Everybody asked me to make this again and we were all fighting for it. I've not made any of the similar yet more compiles recipes on this site, and I won't. This is fabulous without any extra effort.

Definitely a side rather than a main dish, but it was good. We only used about half the bacon, too, and it was still great. Thanks!

This was good. I of course like everyone else made it my own. I made it as stated above and added extra cabbage, all beef smoked wieners and parmesan cheese and then when I dished it up I added hot sauce for my own taste. It was amazing!!!

This is so good I would marry it if I could! It's fast, easy, and divinely delicious! My whole family wanted seconds, and still went back for more, when I had to tell them it was all gone. Will definitely make again.

We had almost a whole head of cabbage left in the fridge from another recipe and I didn't want to waste it. I'm so glad we tried this, it's delicious but definitely a treat with all the bacon!!

I love fried cabbage!  I add some beef bouillon and reduce it, and add a little cider vinegar to serve.
Cabbage is a gift that proves God loves the Irish!

I've made cabbage dishes that have bacon grease in them before, so I knew that I prefer less than what this recipe called for. I probably used 2 T instead of 1/4 cup. It turned out great! I added a little Better than Bouillon to season as well as some salt. My company ate almost the entire bowl. Very good!

I tried to make this but didn't have cabbage and I only had ground beef, so I had to imagine it with bacon.  I must have a good imagination because it was so good I can eat it all day.  Next time I will get bacon!

it doesnt get a 5 star due to the salt content ...I've been making this for years, but at the end, I add some cider vinegar, and serve with wide egg noodles and grated cheese. Dinner in one pot!

Super easy! Made it according to the recipe, but i did remove some of the bacon grease, and added the bacon back at the end so it was crunchy. No sugar either, very good.

I added boiled potatoes and fried them along with the cabbage.  Sometimes I use leftover steamed cabbage and just fry until warm.

Next time, I'll add 1/2 tsp salt and not bother measuring out the grease.  It comes out to about 1/4 cup anyway, so just remove the bacon and throw in the cabbage!
