Since I don't eat meat or dairy I made this with vegetarian bacon instead of prosciutto, and Earth Balance margarine instead of butter.  It was amazing, took it to a dinner party where everybody else was a meat eater and it was a huge hit.  Didn't need any salt just a little pepper.  I did add a dash of basil and oregano.

This is a great recipe, although we thought it was way too lemony and we love lemon.  I would cut it back to about 1/4 cup or so.  We made the recipe as is and didn't change a thing.

This was SUPER!  I made the recipe as written except for the added salt.  Prosciutto is salty enough.  We all loved it, even the 4 year-old.  It smelled wonderful while cooking and was very fast and easy to make.  YUMMY!

Fantastic! This was perfect just the way it was written. Savory and fresh. The pine nuts add a nice flavor I wouldn't normally think to mix with asparagus.

This is a keeper. I scaled the recipe as it was just for two, had only one rather old lemon on hand so skimped on the juice, and wanted to serve with pasta so I upped the fat just a bit and added a few spoonfuls of pasta water at the end then stirred fettucini into the pan.
I'll make this again when I have more lemon in the pantry.

Yummy! I adjusted the servings for 3 and it was enough for my husband and I. I only used 1 tablespoon of butter, cut back on the garlic and chopped the asparagus into bite size bits. I mixed it with Whole Wheat egg noodles. It was a GREAT, HEALTHY dinner! Thanks!! Others said it had too much lemon, we actually ended up squeezing more lemon on it afterwards. The prosciutto, lemon, pine nut and asparagus combo worked very well!

Love everything that goes into this dish, but for me the lemon juice was overpowering.  Next time I will squeeze half a lemon over everything, instead of using 1/3 cup of juice.  Totally lost the flavor of the other ingredients, and the asparagus all but disappeared.  Great idea for a combo, but the porportions are a little off for our tastes.

This was very good, although next time I'll double the prosciutto.

Great recipe! I cut down the butter A LOT and would maybe add another element so that the salt/lemon wouldn't be so overpowering. A friend suggested dill? Will try that next time.
