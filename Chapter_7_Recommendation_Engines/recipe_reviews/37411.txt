i thought it was peculiar to place the sandwich mayo side down on the grill, but it worked fine and was a unique process. this is a quick, alternative to traditional grilled cheese. next time i'd try spreading a light layer of pizza sauce inside the sandwich, in addition to the mayo mixture on the outside -- just to add more flavor.

Strange enough the kids & I enjoyed these for lunch today.  I did spread sauce (exquisite pizza sauce, from this site) on the inside of each slice of bread, and I also used turkey pepperoni, but it really was very good.  It was better than those "hot pockets" that they sell in the stores.  Thanks ;)

This was really tasty.  I didn't have any mayo so I used creamy ranch dressing instead and worked great.  I great change for lunch!

I managed to eat one, but did not enjoy it. Pizza sauce would be an excellent addition. The mayo mixture was my least favorite part. Since substituting pizza sauce for the mayo would be a significant change, I can't see giving this recipe a good rating.

This was a really good sandwhich. I made mine on rye and added some pizza sauce on the inside. Was very filling I was only able to eat half.

My kids enjoyed this sandwich and it was super easy to make.  I will add a pizza sauce for dipping.

I won't make this again, and I followed the directions to a perfect T. I don't know what happened, but from now on I will stick to just plain grilled cheese sandwiches
