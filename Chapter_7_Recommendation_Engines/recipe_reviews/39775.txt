Very yummy and moist!

I cooked the sauce for 2 minutes and made a glaze out of it instead of sauce.  Looked very pretty and was delish!

Delicious!  I think I'll make double the sauce next time...  Everyone said they could eat that with a spoon!

Very good, but as my husband said not earth shattering.  The one thing I recommend is to serve it at a large dinner party or something similar.  Since it was just the two of us the sauce presented better the first night.

This cake was so good!  Based on some of the other reviews, I didn't even make the sauce, but it didn't need it.  My husband told me I could make this cake anytime I wanted!  :)

ABSOLUTELY YUMMY! Made it for work and EVERYONE raved about it and it didn't last very long!  I actually added some chips to the batter before baking.  The sauce made it - I used a ratio of 1:1 of evap. milk to chips (1/3c of chips to 1/3c of evap. milk.) This wasn't thick, but delicious!  A definite keeper.

Wonderful!  I made this for a birthday and even my non-cake-loving brother went back for seconds.  The butterscotch sauce definitely *makes* this cake.  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I made double the amount of sauce and it all got used up.

Very, very good and moist!  Made this cake for my church group and they ranted and raved over it and wanted the recipe.  I also doubled the sauce, which is so yummy!

This recipe is very good baked in 4 small loaf pans and served as a bread (without the sauce). My husband is normally not a sweet bread eater, but he raves over this!

I had this cake last fall and begged for the recipe. I made it for the first time yesterday for friends, have another one in the oven for our family as I type. The only problem I've encountered is "cooling melted chips to room temp"  When I did this yesterday and added to egg mix, the chips got firm and I ended up with pea sized chunks in my batter.  Today I made sure my eggs and pumpkin were room temp and added chips right after melted.  Batter turned out perfect.  As for the sauce, just gently reheat the next day.  I didn't find reheating a problem...

What a hit!!  I didn't make the sauce since I was made it a day ahead.  Heavier than a cake - more like a bread.  Next time I'll put in extra butterscotch chips...what can I say, I have a sweet tooth!

The cake was ok, a little heavy but the butterscotch sauce was AWFUL.  It tasted like evaporated milk. 
Not one person in my family ate it, it ended up scraped to the side of the plate.

As others have said... I'd double the sauce and don't expect it to keep overnight.  The cake itself is wonderful and was incredibly popular at the party to which I took it.  Next time I think I might serve it with whipped cream as a replacement to pumpkin pie.

I've been making this cake for several years and it's always wonderful.  I make it according to the recipe, no changes.  It looks beautiful, serves a large group, can be a morning treat or evening dessert. It also tastes better the second day. My trick to bundt cakes is Baker's Joy Cooking Spray.  I never make the sauce, the cake itself is perfect. This is a family favorite  and says, "Welcome  autumn."

I have made this cake for thanksgiving for 4 years now and people keep asking if I'm bringing it again this year.   I certainly am.  I wish I had a better way to present the sauce though.

I made this for the first time and it turned out very yummy!  I did not make the glaze but just dusted the top with powdered sugar. Recommend as a tasty and low fat treat.

This is REALLY good! Will definitely be added to my recipe box. The only thing I did differently was decrease the amount of sugar to 1 cup, and it is still very sweet. I might even use less next time.  But other than that, a great cake, and very simple to make.  Oh, and I made a vanilla glaze instead as I didn't have enough butterscotch chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The cake came out very nice. I didn't make the sauce, it was nice and sweet already. I tried it again in bundtlette molds but it didn't come out very well. I'm sure it was my fault though.
