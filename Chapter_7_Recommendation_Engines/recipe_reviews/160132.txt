I have been using this recipe for years and we love it.  Our favorite version though is to use the Simply Potatoes  Southwest Style hashbrowns instead of the plain hashbrowns.  This gives it a real kick and has tons of flavor.  If I use the Southwest style I leave out the onion.  I don't usually have cornflakes on hand, so, I generally just use crushed Ritz crackers instead.  The potatoes do stay a little firm which we like, but, if you like them softer - I would saute the potatoes a little before mixing everything together.

This is the only way I prepare hash browns for company now. It is so good and very easy to prepare the night before and throw in the oven in the morning.  The only changes I make are that I use half of the cheese and double the onion. I like big chunks of onion, too. You will not be disappointed! I've tried this with and without the topping and I really prefer it without. UPDATE: This is still my favorite way to prepare hash browns, but I have tried a few additions with some really great results. The best meat additions are either 3 heaping Tbls. Canadian Bacon, diced small or Pancetta, finely diced and sautéed. And adding just a pinch of red pepper flakes kicks up the flavor enough to make you wonder "WHAT is in there"?

I make this ALL the time at breakfast!  I discovered this recipe at the hospital I worked at.  They make this casserole and it always goes fast!  I also make this minus the topping(ill have to try that) and instead of cream of chicken soup I use cream of mushroom.  I also cook the potatoes in a bit of olive oil first for about 20 min in the skillet to soften them.  They can be a bit to crunchy if not cooked before baking.  This casserole is DELISH!

great and simple recipe we use for parties all the time.  I did change a few things. We like these to be super cheesy..so we double the amount of shredded cheese, and use a 4 cheese/taco blend, as it has more flavor and then we add 1 package of cream cheese that has been melted a bit.  it makes this recipe super cheesy..we also do not add the crumbs on top, but the last 1o minutes we sprinkle another packag of shredded cheese on top and let it melt.  YUMMY!

I get requested to make this for every Holiday/Party I attend. I use Cream of Mushroom Soup for my vegetarian friends and family and Crushed Garlic and Cheese Croutons on top instead of the cereal. The aroma just gets your tummy growling!

I've been searching for a perfect cheesy hash brown recipe for a long time! I finally found it. Made in a crockpot and had on med high for two hours.

My husband LOVES this recipe, which we found on the package. That version didn't include the topping. We've experimented with various cream soups and really like the creamy green chile soup. It adds a spiciness that we prefer. It is very greasy, so he doesn't get this often, poor guy. Also, the very firm texture of the potatoes, even after cooking can take some getting used to.

If you like cheesy potatoes, this is a great simple dish, you can add ham, turkey or chicken to it.  You can also add whatever spices, cajun spice is great.

Baked this casserole for 1 hour and hash browns were not done. I will either increase cooking time or up temp to 375/400 degrees.  Liked flavor and ease of putting it together

I love this recipe. One good tip, use a shallot instead of onion. They melt so you get the onion flavor but not the extra crunch. It's great when the kids whine about the onion.

Everyone's favorite side this past Mother's Day dinner.  Used 2 cups sour creme for a double batch, and added salt and pepper;  otherwise stuck to the recipe.

Served this for our Christmas brunch and it got rave reviews. I didn't follow the recipe exactly: I had a bag of 24oz hashbrowns (instead of 20oz), used the whole 8oz container of sour cream (instead of 3/4c), and used almost a cup of chopped onion (instead of a 1/4c). Also, I cooked it for an hour (instead of 45 minutes). If I made it again I would probably use 1/2c of onion, but my Christmas guests said they really enjoyed the excess amount of onion =) I loved how simple it was to put together.

I did keep to the recipe except I didn't have cornflakes so I crushed up some Garlic Cheese Croutons. Worked Great!  This is good as is or as a base but to get five stars I had to add some onion powder and garlic powder after the first serving.  Wow what a difference.  For the cheese I used Kraft's Triple Cheddar Mix.  This is a great base to use to make your own.  Next time, I'll add some more onions, I loved them when I tasted them here.  I'll also go ahead and add some more seasoning as listed above, but you really can't go wrong with this base and it is so easy!

I thought this was okay. Make sure to use the shredded and not cubed potatoes. My potatoes were slightly uncooked. Also, I cut the sour cream back and apparently it is really needed. My casserole got dry 30 minutes into baking. However, the flavor overall was fine. I still much preferred the restaurant style hash brown casserole on the site, by the submitter Marbalet. I have been making that one for years.

I used cream of mushroom soup and panko bread crumbs dusted with a bit of paprika and topped with cheese.  For the cheese, I used one 8 oz pack of Mexican blend Sargento, which does not have added spice.  Instead of onions, I used some minced onions for a subtle flavor that did not interfere with the other flavors.  Five stars with the modifications.

We've always called these Aunt Ethel's Escaloped Potatoes as she handed the recipe down to us. I wouldn't change a thing except we bake for 45 minutes, then sprinkle the topping on and continue baking 30 minutes more. They're delicious and a real crowd pleaser! I use store brand, frozen, country style hash browns to save money and they work great. I also take the whole box of corn flakes, crunch them and place pre measured amounts in small zip locks for freezing.  Just pull one out of the freezer and it's ready to use, no fuss no muss.

This is my favorite dish in the world. My mother has been making it for years. I get requests for this nonstop! Only change is adding a can of cream of mushroom. OR only cream of mushroom or cream of broccoli if I want to make it vegetarian. Oh and I use Kellogg Crumbs instead of actual cornflakes.

A really yummy and easy recipe.  I make a few tweaks to the recipe for my taste-buds however. First, instead of cream of chicken, I use cream of mushroom soup and I replace the corn flakes with French's Fried Onions! Great recipe!

WAY too much cheese versus the amount of hash browns! 40 ozs. of hash browns would make this a good dish. I will do that next time. If not, rename this recipe, "Cheese....and more Cheese (with hash browns)".

Delicious!  I used Ritz crackers for the topping and added a little bacon - because what isn't better with a little bacon - but it was a big hit!  Potatoes are a little harder than you might be used to, but it's great.

My bag of potatoes was 30 oz, so I ended up increasing the other ingredients accordingly, and omitted the topping. Got rave reviews at the church potluck!!!

These potatoes were really good.  I have made a similar recipe for years using frozen hashbrowns.  I find that the Simply Potatoes are easier to mix with the other ingredients.

For a pot luck supper, use the hash brown cubes and add a cup or so of frozen peas and carrots.

I took others' advice and baked for 1 hour and then put the croutons on and baked for another 20 minutes. This ensured that the onions and hashbrowns were tender.

I made this recipe and it was a big hit!  I made a double batch because we were having company for Christmas, and it was everyone's favorite dish.  I did use the Simply Potatoes Southwest Style Hashbrowns and 1 cup Tillamook medium cheddar, 2 cups Tillamook sharp cheddar, and 1 cup Tillamook colby jack.  I did have to add approximately 10 minutes to the bake time, but I think that will vary depending on your oven and what type of baking dish you use.  Just do a test taste at the designated time and see if it needs a little more baking.   Delish!!!

I made this with some substitutions, and I think it turned out amazing! 
I used 2 bags of shedders potatoes, I used about 1cuo minced onions which I sautéed in the butter and cooked with the potatoes a bit.
More substitutes: 1/2 can of cream of chicken soup (instead of a whole can), then I (added) used about 1 cup of ricotta cheese, and (increased) 1 cup of sour cream.
And I cooked it about 1 hr 15 mins to get the potatoes fully cooked.
Super creamy, and delicious!

One of my favorite recipes for a side dish. Great for breakfast or goes well with hamburgers! I change the recipe and use french onion chip dip instead of sour cream and onion. Still get's the same flavor but without the chunks of onion. A family favorite!

Yum! You can't go wrong with sour cream, sharp cheddar and hash browns! I always put extra corn flakes and butter on the top, and a little salt and pepper in the mix.

No need to put buttered corn flakes on top. Either leave it off entirely, or use crushed potato chips.

So yummy. I made 2 batches. 1 with sour cream and 1 without. My husband and mom dont like sour cream and I couldn't have snuck it in there without them noticing. It was great either way and super easy to make! I used it as a breakfast dish and a potato dish for dinner.

My first time making this and it was OK.  I followed the recipe exactly, and It could have cooked a bit longer.  The hash browns were a bit firmer than I would have liked and I think fresh grated cheese would have made all the difference over the packaged grated cheese.  Not a hit, but everyone seemed to like it.

I have made this every year for Christmas and Easter with our ham dinner for the past 10 years. Everyone loves it as the recipe is written, however, I have used panko bread crumbs a few times because I didn’t have corn flakes on hand with not much difference. This Christmas I am going to use crushed Cheez It’s for the topping.

My whole family loves this recipe. It is also great the next day! 

I wonder if anyone has made it two or three days in advance or can you combine the ingredients and freeze it until you are ready to bake it.

I used Dell's has browns. Put 1 cup of diced onion and baked it for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Putting the cornflakes on the last 45 minutes. Everyone loved them! I will definitely be making this again.

Very good! Easy to make on a busy night. 3 out of 4 of us went back for 2nd & 3rds....My son (8) doesn't like anything potatoe , my daughter (7) loved these. My husband doesn't give food compliments very easily, everything is always "just fine" or "good" & he raved on and on about these. Thanks!
Also, I don't measure things when it comes to this kind of recipe &  it turned out perfectly. I even forgot to set the timer, so I guessed at that too. Might be a fool proof recipe!

Love this dish! Only thing I don’t like about using the cream of chicken soup is the little bits of nasty chicken you end up finding in the dish. Trying to think of a substitute for this soup.

Fabulous!  I added a little green pepper.  It wouldn't be as impressive without the crumbs on top.  It freezes well too!

Will definitely make this again! We used cream of potato soup so i added a little milk cause it's not as thin as other cream soups.  We used triple cheddar cheese & sharp cheddar mixed together. It was delicious!!!!

I followed this recipe exactly as written for Easter brunch this year. The recipe was easy to follow and the dish simple to make. The casserole came out ok and was well received. The reason for the 4 stars rather than 5?  For me, there wasn't so much of the taste of the potatoes, it was overwhelmed with the amount of butter, sour cream and corn flakes.  Otherwise, it's a safe dish for a first try for a crowd. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These were a huge hit at my niece's birthday party... I left out the topping as I was keeping them warm in a slow cooker and did not want the topping to become soggy. Even without the topping, these disappeared! Great recipe!

I followed the directions. I did not think there was enough flavor  the first time, so I added lots of sweet peppers, salt,  and red pepper flakes.

I love the versatility of this recipe. Instead of using the prepackaged hash, I grated russet potatoes, squeezed out the starch, and sauteed them in a pan with onions and green peppers. I opted out the broth because I didn't have any, threw everything into a pan, and baked it as directed. It still turned out delicious. Would make again, maybe next time with the broth and compare the two.

It was delicious. I did not use as much butter as the recipe called for.  Hashbrowns needed to cook longer.  I think I will use a bigger casserole dish next time so that it cooks more evenly.

I have made this so many times I cannot even count. It's absolutely delicious and easy to make.  I make this recipe as written except for the topping  I substitute panko breadcrumbs, Italian breadcrumbs or ritz crackers for the cereal. For holidays I make it the night before letting it sit overnight in the refrigerator then I bake it the next day.  Always a crowd pleaser. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

I love this recipe, it's easy and delicious. I changed a few thing though. I used fresh yellow potatoes and cube them, I added a generous amount of rosemary, basil and garlic. I also used onion powder for ease, but chopped onions are good too. And I omitted the topping. I might try it without the butter next time, it seems to have enough fat and grease with the cheese and sour cream.

Great! Wonderful leftovers. I mixed 1/2 of the shredded cheddar with the batter and the other 1/2 with the topping. I used Ritz crackers in place of corn flakes.

I used o'brien potatoes and sour cream and chives.  Delicious!  If you're looking for low carb or low calorie, this recipe is not for you.    Once a year at Christmas or easter won't hurt.

Every year my mother-in-law would make these Cheesy Potatoes for Chriistmas and everyone looked forward to this dish on the holiday meal table.

She did one alteration which made these suburb.  Instead of Hash Browns, she used a package of O'Brien Potatoes (the ones that are frozen with the red and green peppers and onions already in the package).  MMMMM-good!  And easy peazy!  

If you use this idea, omit the onion in the recipe as it's already in the package!  This way you do not have to chop up an onion and the square potatoes are absolutely the bomb!!

We also omit the cornflakes as this dish is already perfect and no need for the topping.

I want to make this dish but  I wonder how it would taste with non dairy sour cream such as Tofutti.  Also, I may use Panko bread crumbs.  Plus I can't use Cream of anything so I may find a good substitute.  Oh the joys of being Lactose Intolerant.

Great recipe. Mixed in same casserole dish and then baked it.
Used panko crumbs instead of the bread crumbs. 
Definitely tastes great for a treat, but would not consider it to be a healthy food with the cream cheese and butter.

GOOD FAST. Nice for  a change. Easy to make ahead and take for kids. I did not make topping and only used 2 tbsp. of butter in the potatoes .

I've been making this for years - exactly as written but without the topping.     Everyone likes it and the leftovers are great for breakfast with a piece of ham.

I used spicy Italian sausage which actually made it edible.   However, even without the meat it was too greasy. Flavorful but too much fat. Maybe less cheese?

I made this for my in laws Christmas dinner it was awesome !!  I used Ore Ida shredded potatoes instead of the simply potatoes. I doubled the recipe as I was making it for 15 people. I added 2 cups of taco blend shredded cheese along with the cheddar cheese it calls for. I baked it at 400 degrees for an hour, until you see the golden brown of the potatoes and corn flakes.  My family loved it... I will be the one who brings cheesy potatoes every year now. :)

I made this but since I didn't have pure cheddar cheese, I used a cup and a half of shredded Mexican cheese blend and half a cup of shredded Italian cheese blend that I bought at Kroger. I topped it with crumbled seasoned stuffing mix. It was absolutely amazing. Hubby went back for seconds so my plans to have enough for tomorrow night's dinner are gone, lol.

These are so good! I did not use corn flakes I used butter crackers (Ritz) for the topping. I did cook the first half hours at 350 and the second half hour at 375. After I read a review that 350 for an hour was not long enough. YUM!!! ADDICTING!!!

I used in addition to cream of chicken cream if celery and topped with French fries onions. This is a hit for work pot lucks.
