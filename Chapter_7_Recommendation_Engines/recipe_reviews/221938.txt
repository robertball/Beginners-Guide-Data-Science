Spinach and artichoke dip how it should be, no mayonnaise! Mayo is a cheap replacement for cheese, gross!
I've made this recipe as a dip 4 times and as a pasta dish 2x (cook a box of pasta like penne, bowtie or medium shells al dente and mix the artichoke juice into the sauce mix then stir in cooked pasta and bake). 
 
For Thanksgiving I bought a nice casserole dish (w/ lid and metal holder) and made this dip and presented it to the host. Everyone loved the idea!
I use sour cream as I don't buy GY (I'm learning to make my own), cut down on the pepper, and use 1TBS of Sriracha instead of the red pepper flakes. The small amount of sriracha gives the dish a nice flavor but does not make it spicy, my 2 year old eats it up.

YUMMY! I did make a few slight changes, but nothing too major...I halved the recipe, using a whole 10oz. frozen chopped spinach. Also, I only had sour cream on hand, so I used that in place of the greek yogurt. As far as the crushed pepper flakes and black pepper, I just used both of those, to taste b/c I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids. I baked this about 20-25 minutes, until it was bubbly. Great flavor, and a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I loved this recipe.  I made it for a party and everyone just raved about it.  The only thing I changed in it was the cheeses because I couldn't find the Asiago or the Fontina cheeses.  I used grated fresh Parmesan cheese that you find in the cheese or deli section.  I also used Monterrey Jack cheese.  It was absolutely delicious.

I made this tonight for a family get together. Everyone thought it was really good, so much so that I ran out of chips, oops! I liked how it wasn't all greasy. I changed a few things: sour cream instead of yogurt, pre-shredded 4 cheese mix instead of the cheeses listed, and halved the amount of pepper flakes and half the amount of pepper since I knew some guests don't like spicy foods. I goofed and didn't realize how much this actually makes, lol! I ended up with a full 9x13 pan of it. One thing is that after 8 minutes in the oven it wasn't even warm all the way through. After 20 minutes it was warm, but wasn't hot like I wanted, however it was OK and people were hungry so I took it out anyway. This will definitely need more time in the oven to get nice and hot. Thanks for the recipe :)

This recipe is delicious, especially because there is no puddle of grease on top. I use fresh spinach (1 or 2 bags) and cook it down with the garlic. My teenagers ask for this and scarf it down!

Yum!!!! Better than most restaurant appetizers - I used sour cream instead of greek yogurt and I susbstituted the 5 cheese shredded italian mix for the aisago & fontina cheeses (same amount as recipe)  It's not greasy like recipes with mayo which I loved. This will be my new go-to

This was very good.  I made it according to the recipe exactly.  We love spicy food but we took it to a party and some thought it was too hot!  So, if I take it to a party or social event, I will cut down on the red pepper flakes by half.

Two tablespoons of black pepper seemed really high, so I went with one tablespoon. The dip was REALLY peppery, and I love spicy stuff. It should probably be two teaspoons or maybe a half a tablespoon of black pepper. The red pepper amount was great.

This was delicious! I made it for a Super Bowl party and it was a hit. It was so nice to find a recipe without mayo. My husband loved that this dip wasn't greasy. The only change I made was to use a tbsp of sriracha sauce in place of the red pepper flakes as another reviewer did. It really added flavor and a nice level of spice that wasn't overpowering. I also had to bake it at 350 for 30 minutes before it got nice and hot. Great recipe!

Delicious! This is my go-to dish now for all gatherings. I used fresh spinach and sautéed that first with a few onions. Everyone love the Greek yogurt - much healthier and tastier than mayo.
Thanks for the recipe!

This was sooo good but I am a cheese fanatic so next time I make it I’m doubling all cheeses to make it creamier. However made it to recipe the first time and honestly was really good. Almost.....almost reminded me of my Dad’s ( he makes the best!!)

Let me preface this by saying one of the things I love about Allrecipes is being able to look at a recipe, as well as other's reviews to see any changes, tweeks, etc. and then either make it as the recipe calls for, or as I see fit for me and my tastes (or make it with ingredients I have on hand).
  That being said, I looked at several recipes for spinach artichoke dip and this one looked best to me.  However, I did not have all the ingredients called for, and since there is only one grocery store within 15 miles of where I live, and they have you by the throat and rob you with their prices, I substituted with what I had on hand.
  I used Italian 3 cheese blend shredded cheese as well as parmesan and romano cheese.  I did not have plain Greek yogurt, so I used some sour cream and some mayonnaise.  Instead of red pepper flakes I used Ghost Pepper hot sauce (I love, love, love hot chiles).  Finally, instead of cans of artichoke hearts I used artichoke tapenade.  
  It was absolutely delicious!  
  If I have a chance to make it verbatim according to the recipe, I will try that also.

Delicious! I left out the red pepper flakes, only because I don't like them, but made everything else as written. This is creamy, rich, and it tastes amazing on little diced pieces of sourdough bread for serving. I had this out as an appetizer for Christmas and we ate half the pan!

Awesome recipe!  I used 2 c. Trader Joe's shaved 'Parmesan, Romano & Asiago Cheese' mix instead of 1c asiago and 1c fontina cheeses, and the dip was great :)!
