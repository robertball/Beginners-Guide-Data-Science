I was so glad to see this recipe! This is the style of rice pudding we (my 3 sisters and I) were raised on. My Grandma always called it "Poor Man's Rice Pudding" because of the small amount of rice used. I remember her telling me that her Grandmother had made it for her when she was a little girl! This is the original comfort food in my opinion! The only thing Grandma did different(from what I remember) was to add about 1t. each of vanilla and cinnamon to the recipe. Again, thanks so much for the great memories and giving me the chance to share this with my kids!2/01/08 I have to add some add'l comments to my original review after seeing the bad reviews this recipe is receiving. As the submitter states you have to stir this pudding every 15 minutes during the first hour so that the rice gets distributed evenly. Also, this pudding takes a long time to cook. Two hours is the time I usually end up baking it. Finally, the pudding usually ends up with a brown "skin" across at least part of the top after baking. This is o.k., it's supposed to be there. My sisters and I used to fight over this part! I guess it just depends on what you were brought up with. To me, the thick, stove-top type of rice pudding just doesn't taste good at all. This recipe, on the other hand, is sublime :)

You've got to be kidding!  The whole mess went down the sink.  It was just hot milk with a little bit of rice floating around in it.

This IS old-fashioned rice puddng, and it IS suppose to be rice cooked in sweetened milk - exactly what my mom and grandmother use to make.  I love it, and I use Splenda!  Thanks for bringing it back.

This was the best low fat rice pudding recipe I have found.  I suggest that you put some flavoring into the milk while it is warming for example vanilla or almond extract.  The pudding has a lovely color and is very creamy and good.

This is great in a pinch! You don't need much to make it and it turns out wonderfully creamy and yummy! Not at all runny like I thought it would be. If you follow the recipe, it does turn out. You may need to bake it for up to two hours to achieve the desired consistency. I recommend adding some almond or vanilla extract to boost the flavor a bit. I added some cinnamon. It would have been better if I had added the extract as well. It's perfect for the kids because it's not too sweet. I skipped the salt.

Yu-um!  This was my very first time making rice pudding.  I did have to cook for 2 1/2 hours instead of 1 1/2, but it was soooo worth the wait.  I'm trying a little vanilla in the milk next time, just for fun, like some of the other readers.

Excellent!  I used to get this as a kid, it sure takes me back!  I used reconstituted milk to make this and it turned out fine.  Also, mine finished faster than others' apparently did.  Keep an eye on your cooking time -- it may vary.

Always the best recipe! I, too, was raised on this one. I even make it with skim milk, and it's still fantastic.

Just like I had growing up! The rice will absorb all of the milk it just might take longer in different ovens. I left out the salt as my Mum never used it. Really nice treat, thanks for posting it!!! Also add some raisins (1/4 cup) and some freshly grated nutmeg with other ingredients.

my grandmother always made us rice pudding growing up. this recipe is so close. We use cook rice instead add some cinnamon and vanilla and you got a winner. The cooked rice cuts the cooking time in half

Amazing! This recipe turned out delicious. I'm not a big fan of rice pudding, but my boyfriend is, so I decided to try this one out. I added vanilla extract and cinnamon sticks for extra flavor. The rice pudding turned out to be delicious and creamy indeed! I must say that I really do like rice pudding :)

This was the recipe I was looking for.  Growing up, my mom made a baked rice pudding all the time, and over the last 20 years, since she died I have been looking for the recipe!! This recipe was close, but not quite it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it took 3 hours at 300 to cook to be thicker.  When my mom made it she had to make it for 6 kids and my two parents, so the recipe was doubled.  The best bet, that I am going to try next time is 1/2 cup of rice to the quart of milk...add in some raisins, and the teaspoon of cinnamon.  Everything else is good.  Stir it every so often for the first hour and wait for the top to brown...mmmmmmmmm!!

Yes! Traditional English rice pudding like my mum made. This is not the thick, stodgy american-style (no offense intended, just trying to clarify). This is the runny, creamy English-style.  I just ate my first delicious helping, and I thought a couple of tips might be helpful:  out the outset this seemed like it would make a very small amount, but actually it made five generous helpings.  I used 1 cup half & half with 3 cups 2% milk to make sure it was creamy enough. It was plenty creamy, in fact next time I will use all 2%. I used 1/3 cup of brown rice (not white) and it worked just fine, but I did have to cook it for 3 hours. It was more sweet than I needed - next time I will try 1/4 cup sugar or less. I did not need to cover it, but I did stir it every 15 mins for 1 1/2 hours. Thank you,  Kim!

I'm sorry but the recipe did not hold true to the amount of ingred that were posted.  I doubled the recipe and ended up using 2 cups of rice to absorb all the milk. In the end it was wonderful but I yhink you need to recalculate.

I gave this four stars instead of five due to the cooking time recommended. This is exactly like my grandmother's recipe except I have to cook it for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, stirring every 1/2 hour. Otherwise it would be soupy with the rice still hard, as JoSH noted.

Wonderful recipe.  I was short 1 cup milk BUT happened to have Great Value French Vanilla coffee creamer which a friend had left.  I used a cup of this, 3 cups milk and eliminated the sugar due to the sweetness of the creamer.
My oh my..........I think I'll try hazelnut next time.  It was a hit!!

Thanks for this quick and easy rice pudding, my 11yr old son and I were craveing something sweet late one night, but I live in the country and I had everything for this recipe when I saw it online. It hit the spot. I'll be making it again.

It was literally soup and the rice did not even have any texture.  I cooked it about the minimum time.  I also added cinnamon and vanilla.  It was a fiasco and very upsetting considering a lot of the ingredients I used were organic.  What a terrible, terrible waste.  I also added about 1 tbsp. extra rice, which clearly didn't help.

I made this recipe as a kid about 30 years ago and have been looking for it ever since! I used skim milk and it still came out thick and creamy although I did cook it about 2 hours (although I could have taken it out 15 to 30 minutes earlier...I used a jasmine rice and rinsed it even though the recipe said not too...I ate some of it warm, right out of the oven and then added a touch of cinnamon before chilling it...it doesn't necessarily need the cinnamon but I love cinnamon! I will make this again and again! Creamy, simple, and not too sweet!

Used 1% milk and Splenda.  Made as written and it came out a bit runny.  My British mother, who's been eating and making rice pudding for 80 years, advised a change to 275 degrees and baking for 2 hours.  Tried that the second time and it became thicker and creamy.

This recipe uses way too much milk.  It's like sweet rice soup.  Additionally, I added approximately 1/4 cup raisins, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, another tablespoon of sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla.  Delicious, but if I make it again, I'm cutting the milk down by 1/3.

This is the bread pudding I remember my mother making when I was a child.  I was raised in a poor household and nothing was ever wasted.  I had some left over cranberry orange scones I made for St. Pat's day so I decided to try this recipe using them.  Delicious!  The only thing I added was a little cinnamon/sugar on the top.  I didn't even bother with the sauce since I didn't have any cream on hand and didn't feel like running to the store for it.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe and bringing back some very happy childhood memories.  Almost forgot. I did use about a cup of 1/2 and 1/2 since I had it available.

This is not "CUSTARD" style rice pudding!!!!  Yay!  I finally found the recipe my mom taught me to make.  I add vanilla bean to give it some depth, you can add extract at the end if you don't have beans.  Thank you so much for posting!

Be prepared to cook & cook & cook! 
I quadrupled this recipe because of the number of people that I would be serving. After 2 hours of cooking (on the stove because of the amount), it still was not ready & I thought that I had a disaster. I let it sit in the hot pan with the lid on for another 1/2 hour & did not see much improvement. Finally, I set the pan outside to cool (cold night, but not cold enough to freeze) overnight. Luckily we had another dessert. When I checked it in the morning, the rice had really puffed up. After reading some more reviews, I understood that it is supposed to be runny not thick like an American pudding. I had some for breakfast with some peaches on it & it was delightful!

Really good. Like other reviews I added tsp. vanilla, tsp. nutmeg, tsp. cinnamon &, 1/4 cup of raisins to the scalded milk. I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. (I think brown sugar makes everything taste better.) A note to anyone who thinks 1/3 cup of rice isn't enough WRONG!!! Unfortunately the first time I made this recipe I thought 1/3 cup of rice wasn't enough so I added 1/3 cup more. Definitely not a good idea. I had to add 2 more cups of milk an hour into making it. The next time I followed the recipe & it came out wonderful. Thank you for adding this recipe so I could make it.

This is the old-fashioned version; raw rice, milk, sugar, butter.  (You might want to add vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, etc).   Or even dress it up with half and half or cream, add raisins or other dried fruits.  Thanks for posting.

I have made this recipe several times and every time it has been amazing. It's incredibly simple and easy to customize depending on what you like. Regardless though it always turns out delicious.  The last time i made this recipe i made just a couple changes to customize it to my preferences. Be warned that if you want a thicker texture you will need to cook it longer than the time listed (my preference is about 2hrs 45min)  

I prefer a little creamier flavor without having to add eggs so i substituted 3/4 a cup of the milk in this recipe for heavy cream. I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the milk and a pinch of cinnamon when scalding. I put this in a water bath before putting it in the oven (helps it  to cook evenly) and stir this about every 15-20min. When i notice it's getting close to my desired thickness i let it cook (unstirred) for an additional 45min until a nice skin forms on top (i enjoy the skin). Let rest for a few minutes when removing from oven to help it set. The type of rice you use can make a big difference in flavor. I used basmati rice.

Old Fashioned for sure!! Delish! Added a couple more tsp. sugar and a splash of vanilla. Like my Mom & Grama used to. Love this recipe. Not disappointment in my house. Trick is to scald the milk and it really makes for a creamier pudding.

My first failure with allrecipes.  I've ended up with a very watery mess with a thick crust/skin on the top.  I added sultanas hoping to soak up some of the extra liquid, but it doesn't seem to be helping much.  It's been cooking for 2 hours, I'm going to leave it for another half hour - I'm not sure it could get worse.

I followed others advice with adding vanilla and almond extract. It took about 2hrs to cook. My husband raved about it.  Never again will I buy rice pudding from the store.

The only changes I made were to mix in some cinnamon and to bake for 1hr and 50 min.  I probably could have kept it in the oven a tad longer.  In the future, I would add some vanilla to the milk for extra flavor.  I, however, enjoyed the taste and loved the consistency.
