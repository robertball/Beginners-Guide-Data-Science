I used for potstickers... YUM!!!  If you are one of the unlucky rolling these out by hand, I found that rolling out each of your 4 pieces into a square smaller than recommended, cutting into 9 equal smaller squares, and then rolling each square individually to size worked best for me, and there was no problem getting them thin enough using this method.  Do yourself a favor and fill each one (or have a helper do it) as you roll it out - I had a horrible time with them sticking together having put the finished wrappers in a big stack and ended up wasting most of a batch.  But the few potstickers I managed to make were so good that I saved my filling for the next day and tried again.  A lot of work but well worth it!

Perfect every time. Made in the food processor because it decreases kneading time. Pulse to form a ball and then knead by hand for a few minutes. BE AWARE you may need to add a few drops of extra water to make the dough softer! Don't add too much, though, or you will have paste. Also VERY IMPORTANT to let the dough rest for at least 1/2 hour (covered) before working with it. Otherwise, your arms WILL fall off! GREAT SUGGESTION ABOUT USING THE PASTA MACHINE by another reader. DUH! I can't believe I didn't think of that! Anyway, thanks, Steven for this recipe. I live in Italy in a small town where Wonton wrappers don't exist.

What a FUN and fabulous recipe!! I was sooo impressed with how these fried up! Restaurant quality indeed.  One suggestion though... when working with the dough be sure to keep the extra dough balls moist under a damp towel, it will be much more pliable this way.  Thanks Stephen.

This recipe is VERY hard work if you have to roll the dough out by hand (w/ a rolling pin). If you have a pasta roller machine you'll save a lot of time and effort (and might spare yourself sore arms the next morning). I only needed to add 2 tsps. of extra water. Don't be fooled into thinking you need to add a lot more water. If the dough is sticky it will stick the rolling pin... Roll it out thinly for best results!

Great recipe!  And I don't even mind making them with a regular old rolling pin: it's pretty good exercise.  :)  The only little thing I would suggest is to make sure you use a large or extra-large egg; if not you'll end up having to use more water with the dough.

These turned out really good.  Just make sure you roll them out REALLY thin, otherwise you won't get the crispy texture.

I agree with others - let the dough rest for half an hour. As for rolling it out - I use a pasta machine. works like a champ. If you want thinner sheets yet, take two of the thinnest sheets and stack with plastic wrap between them. Roll them again and presto two sheets half the thickness.

My first attempt at making peking ravioli, and the store didn't have wonton wrappers.  Luckily, I found this recipe.  I didn't have much experience at making dough of any sort, but this recipe was really easy and quick.  And the peking ravioli came out excellent!

Wow, this was a lot of work.  I did it because they don't sell wonton wrappers where I live, but in addition to making the stuffing for the wontons and fried rice to go with it, it took a long time.  This is a Saturday project if I ever do it again.

I rated this recipe a four because the recipe calls for way to much flour.  I believe the reason people were having trouble rolling the wraps out is because the extra flour makes the dough tough.  I used only 1 1/2 cups flour and the dough rolled out perfectly.

a five for the actual dough. a 1 for the amount of work vs. product. if you don't have a pasta maker, and you can get wrappers from the store, save your self the frustration and hours of time and get the pre made wrappers.

I actually cooked these. I boiled them for 5 minutes in a steamer pot, and I removed the excess water after they were boiled. They turned out great.   I stuffed them with cheese, mushroom, and minced spinanch, and I drained out the excess water by lifting my steamer out of the pot.  A wooden rolling pin is a no-no!!! You will pull out your hairs with frustration!!!.  Use a wine bottle. or a ceramic rolling pin, and roll the small dough balls in some yellow/white cornmeal.  I made small balls the size of a quarter and rolled them in the corn meal all at once to save time.  Don't worry about it, most of the cornmeal will fall off when they are steaming, or boiling in the pot.  I also used cornmeal on my surface to roll dough, to preventing it from sticking. When you finish roll the dough, put the stuffing in, and use a fork, to press the edges together, and then dip the filled wonton in the yellow cornmeal again and put them on a tray.   It would prevent them from sticking.  I took swanson chicken broth, I added some garlic powder, ground pepper, salt, & a dash of worcestershire sauce.  When I plated the cooked wonton I added broth as needed.  Also, if you make pork/chicken stufffed wonton steamed, you can add fresh cut scallions to the broth, for more of a chinese flavor. It is a healthy dinner meal idea.  I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour to make my dough.  I wanted to stay away from fried foods, and the steamed turned out great!!!

Very good recipe and easy to follow. I made these for the first time tonight and they came out beautifully. I used them for the "Pork Dumplings" recipe found on this site. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

to roll out thinly, it is imperative to use CORN FLOUR sprinkled on when rolling.  i read this somewhere, maybe someone else's review, but it works a treat!  when stored with flour it will just eventually get pasty and sticky (and doesn't even roll out as thinly)but corn flour is what they use when you buy them ready made.  i made a lot, and put them in the freezer.  corn flour. mine looked professional.  it was perfect.  another tip, roll out this and other pastry doughs, pie crusts etc, between a clean old bed sheet (or a pillowcase).  i cut a rectangle, put the dough in the middle, fold over the cloth and use the rolling pin over it.  you will be surprised.  it prevents the dough from sticking to counter tops and just makes it easier in general.  have fun!

Great recipe!  I made for the 1st time tonight and now my husband is busy filling them.  Definitely use a pasta roller to prepare the dough.  Time saver and ensures the dough is thin enough.

This recipe worked out perfectly! I did need to add a bit more water, but that was all. The key to this dough is to allow it sit, covered at room temp to rest for easier rolling. The dough was beautiful to work with. I actually made the dough the day before, wrapped it and put it in the fridge. The next morning I took it out to come to room temp and 'rest'. I used a pasta machine to roll the dough to the thickness I wanted. Very easy and VERY delicious, waaaay better than store bought (and cheaper too)...A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Simply perfect.  I ran out of wonton wrappers and I live in the middle of nowhere.  The corner store has 12 varieties of beef jerky but suprisingly, no ethnic foods.  This was perfect and I will never buy wrappers again.  Thanks a bunch.

My son and I made this recipe yesterday and followed it exactly.  We found the dough easy to work with and had no trouble at all except with the sheets sticking together.  I suggest letting them cure a little individually before dusting with flour and stacking.  Instead of making squares, we used a 3 1/2" circle cutter to make rounds and made potato, onion, and cheddar perogies.  Any scraps I deep-fried and drizzled with honey and sprinkled with powdered sugar for a sweet snack.  I had no wasted dough.  Personally this is the recipe I'll use to make ravioli, dumplings, eggrolls, and perogies from now on. It is very versatile and easy to make.

These worked out really well for me.  I took the advise from one review to divide each ball into 9 pieces then rolled them out to the right thickness individually - that was a great tip. I filled them as I went too (made crab rangoons) and I was very pleased with this recipe.

This recipe was so easy. I needed wonton skins for a desert recipe and could not seem to find the pre made ones at the store, so I made these, they came out beautifully. it was a big hit for our holloween party. I stuffed the wrappers with a few tiny marshmellows, chocolate chips, and red jam; fried them to make SCARY SMORE'S

I use this recipe for making fresh noodle, after the dough rest, I put in the pasta machine, and make it thin starting with #8 and go down to 1.  Then I put thru the spaghetti cutter on the machine.  This made a lot of noodle, you can freeze them and use it later.

Just what I was looking for! Made the dough in the bread machine, rolled it out thinly with a pasta maker, used it as an egg roll wrapper.

I followed the recipe but changed the ingredients.  1) I used 100% whole wheat flour instead of all purpose  2)I used sea salt instead of regular salt  3) I used vegetarian cage free eggs instead of regular eggs  4) I fried the dough in peanut oil    It was so delicious. I am using this for a pot sticker recipe but I cant stop eating them by themself.  Its like a very dellicious mini pita! I am having a hard time rolling the dough so I really do recommend the significance of a flat surface (im using paper plates on top of my washing machine.

This was an interesting recipe to work with.  I didn't have to use extra flour to roll it out -- it didn't stick at all.  Unforunatley, I found it just about impossible to roll this dough as thin as it should have been.  I allowed my dough to rest for the specified ten minutes, tried to roll it out, and found that I could only roll it so thin.  I kept rolling, but it never got any thinner.  I used this to make pot stickers, and let's just say they wound up being a little bit of filling with a ton of dough!  And, they took twice as long to cook as the dough was twice as thick as it should have been.  I'd try this again, but only if I get a pasta maker first, as someone else mentioned.  Overall, I found this to be just okay.  They tasted fine, but the fact that they wouldn't roll out properly killed it for me.

This recipe is wonderful!  I usually don't keep any white flour in my house, only whole wheat, so I thought, "What the heck!" and I made them with all whole wheat flour!  I did have to add a couple TBS extra water, but nothing much.  I kneaded the door for a few minutes in my kitchenaid, and then let it rest under damp paper towel for about 30 minutes and it was very easy to roll out!  I was able to get it PAPER thin with no tearing at all!  I dusted them with flour to stack them, and they did not stick together at all (and they sat in a pile for about 40 minutes)  Perfect!  They taste wonderful and fry up nice and crisp!  Thanks!

These were great! I substituted whole wheat flour instead of white. My egg rolls turned out great and were healthier than bleached flour. Super recipe.

Super easy, really delicious. We used them for the side crackers egg-drop soup that my boyfriend and I made last night. Rolled the dough out, sliced into random shapes, some thin strips, some wedges, whatever. We baked them with a little Pam on both sides and they came out muuucch better than the restaurant style ones, which are fried and heavy. Super awesome!

Thank you so much for submitting this recipe! They were so fun to make! I rolled them out with a rolling pin which was kind of hard and time consuming - but well worth it. It makes a ton too!

I actually thought this recipe was pretty easy to make.  I used my pasta roller to roll these.  I used them to the 5th setting which made them pretty thin.  I think the thinner the better so it's a good balance between wrapper and filling.  Will make again.  Excellent and easy even if it was a bit time consuming.

Great recipe! To make it gluten free, add 2 tsps of guar gum, or xanthan gum. Also, I used a half cup of water. I haven't eaten anything with wontons in years so this was amazing!

Great recipe.  I used my Pasta roller attachment for my KA-Mixer.  I must have rolled them too thin as I rolled them all the way to 10.  They held together for the pot sticker filling, but when I steamed them, they didn't lift out.  I read on line to only roll them to 6.  I will try batches at 6, 7 & 8 this time around.  It was so incredibly easy and fun to make.

Thanks you soooo much for this recipes.  Everywhere I look, and every recipe I find calls for wonton wrappers, but noone seems to make them.  I knew it had to be easy, and this is, and they are just what I needed.  Thanks again!!!

These wrappers are very easy to make.  I used them for the wonton soup recipe here, and they turned out great, but next time I will make them ultra thin., as they had a doughy texture and taste.

Great recipe. I made the dough and let it rest under a damp kitchen towel while I made the fillings (the dough needs to rest to make it easier to roll). Rolled out in abit of corn meal. I'll use this recipe often.

Great Wonton wrapper recipe!! Makes them perfect! Also my son me likes me to cut them in strips, fry them in the deep fryer and sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on them. Yummy! Almost taste like taco bells cinnamon twists:) Oh and after cut these freeze really well!!

Thanks so much for this absolutely terrific recipe!! I've never made anything like this before and really thought it would be impossible to make these at home, but I tried the recipe and found they are actually BETTER than the chinese restaurant versions I have tried.  I stuffed them with a small amount of cream cheese and sealed the edges with a little water before I deep fried them.  They are great.  Will definitely make these again.  I LOVE them!

I used these for crab rangoons, yuuuum. Better than restaurant. I was a little worried about making this recipe at first because people said it was so hard to roll them by hand. I followed the recipe, except I let the dough rest for 45 minutes. They were so easy to roll out. Just make sure to roll them paper thin,  or there will be waay to much dough when you fry them. I also used flour to knead the dough, and then mixed half flour half corn meal to roll them. Also, make sure to knead long enough, it took me 15 minutes.  So don't think you need a pasta maker to make this recipe.

Rolled them out bigger and used them as egg roll wrappers. Good for someone on a budget, but I think I'm probably going to splurge and buy the real thing next time, since it took quite a while to roll them out, and then it was tricky to wrap the egg rolls to cook.

If I ever need a workout I will use this recipe again.  The dough was fine but it was impossible to rollout. Like other reviewers said: you will need a pasta maker.  But a great recipe.  Spot on.

Perfect and exactly what I was looking for! Like another suggested, make sure you roll these really thin or they end up hard instead of crispy. I think if rolled out correctly, you will end up with more like 28 or 30 wrappers.

I forgot to cover the dough with a wet paper towel, so it was pretty rough to work with. Extremely hard to roll out and took me a long time to get it really thin. But all in all, the taste is amazing! It's way better than the store bought kind. I used a meat and cabbage filling and fried the wontons.

The dough makes very good wontons but do NOT make without a pasta maker. They are extremely dificult to roll out thin enough.

Very good recipe. I used my pasta machine to get it rolled thin enough. The dough was very easy to work with using corn starch instead of flour for the "flouring" of the work surface and the machine. I filled as I rolled so didn't have a problem with anything sticking together. I will make this again.

Okay I have to admit I just stopped after a while. I was rolling these out by hand and the work it takes is incredible. I will only ever attempt this again with a pasta maker. The ones I made were great and the real deal but it took A LOT of time to roll out! I ended up sending my husband to the store to buy them. At just two bucks for 36 wrappers it wasnt worth my time to make by hand.

These turned out great!  I heeded some reviewers' warnings to make sure to keep the wontons moist, so we cut paper towel sheets into four squares, wet them, and placed a wonton wrapper in between each moistened towel square.

Lovely recipe.  Make sure you get the dough paper thin.  I also used corn starch instead of flour when rolling the dough out.  Pretty close to wonton wrappers!

Really pretty easy, but they stay a little to moist.  They aren't as dry or as easy to deal with once filled as store-bought.  I probably will use again with a little meddling.

Quick tip. Use a food processor and pulse it to bring the dough together. Knead it for a few minutes like you would pizza dough.  I have a Marcato Atlas Wellness 150 Pasta Maker and I highly recommend it rather than rolling them out by hand.  I make the wontons into 5" by 6" rectangles and make my own hot pockets. Put in pepperoni, mozzarella, and marinara sauce.  Fry them up and then freeze them for quick lunches.  MUCH better and cheaper than buying them at the store.

Perfect recipe for homemade wonton wrappers! I prefer to make everything myself when possible, used fresh eggs from my chickens. I used the wrappers for a pork dumpling recipe found here, and they worked perfectly. I followed the ingredients as listed, kneaded the dough till smooth, then I ran through my pasta machine down to about #3 thickness, cut into squares. I plan to keep the same recipe for larger wrappers, making egg rolls.

Incredibly good! I wanted to make crab ragoons and apparently where I live no one has ever heard of them because there was not a single store selling the right wrappers, only those rigid spring rolls wrappers. At 6 pm, after checking I don't know how many stores I was tired and I lost all hope. As  usual when I'm desperate, I turned to Google for help and when I found this I couldn't believe it was so easy to make them. The best part is that while eating them what we liked the most wasn't the filling or the sauce but the crunchy, tasty wrapper. Life saver and better than anything store bought.

I use this recipe all the time! Mostly because we love crab rangoon and the other reason being wonton wrappers are not sold in our area. If I do have any criticism about this recipe, it is that the dough is often times hard to roll thin enough and almost never gets that bubbly, crispy outside that I expect. But overall, a great recipe!

Used these to make some awesome veggie potstickers.  To be fair, I have a Kitchenaid with a pasta roller, so that made it many many times easier to deal with.  This is a very firm dough so, as previous comments said, having a pasta roller will make your life a lot better when you make a lot of pieces at a time.

I have mixed feelings on these - I was really impressed with the few number of ingredients, and easy it was to make the dough.  But I don't have a pasta maker, and had to roll these out by hand. The taste was good, but not worth the effort in the future.

thought it was going to be really hard, and i was afraid the whole time (i had no back up) that they wouldn't turn out. To my very pleasant surprise they turned out great! I couldn't get caught up in perfection, but once fried(I made egg rolls) they were awesome. Such a cheap option! You have to roll them out then and it does take time but I thought it was worth it!

My dough would just not roll out thin enough so they ended up being a bit chewy when we ate them.  The flavour was delicious though.

I used my pasta maker to roll these out and it was actually really simple.  Nice recipe, the dough is nice and easy to work with compared to others I have tried in the past.  It would be a lot of work to roll out by hand though.  I also used my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook to knead the dough.

I used this recipe for the won tons I made from another recipe on this site. I didn't mind rolling them out by hand. I enjoyed it. I also covered the dough with a wet towel while I mixed up my won ton filling. Then I went back to making squares. I didn't get them as thin as store bought won ton wrappers, but they still cooked up crispy.

Honestly, this is a great recipe for wonton wrappers. My 13 yo that cooks...a lot, made them with no trouble in the preparation. The only really big issue is rolling this business out is HARD! We have since decided while it is nice to make wonton wrappers at home it is like making your own butter, it's just energy and cost effective to buy them from the store. The materials cost about as much at the store as buying the stuff and making it at home AND it taste just the same. But it was a fine recipe

Tried to use the wrappers to make egg rolls. Okay, but too thick and still mushy on the inside even when cooked until almost burnt.  Even tried rolling them thinner than suggested in this recipe.

Stoked I took the time to read reviews. Definitely cover with a warm towl and let rise for 30-45 minutes. I happen to be an extra unfortunate individual with nooo rolling pin. Took my bamboo cutting board and dusted it with flower. Flattened the dough out best I could by hand , pizza crust style. Then, with a dough scraper, cut the circle into six equal slices. Flattened out each piece and broke again into four pieces. Rolled all of the pieces into balls, let rest on parchment paper in between the board. I floured my board again and flattened each circle first with my palm, and then with the bottom of a measuring cup, also sprinkled in flour. I used the scraper to cut each circle into a square, then gave them on final mash. Made a few more with the circle scraps. Drained and pressed a can of spinach (usually use frozen, but had none on hand), sauteed 3/4 of an onion with a can of mushrooms in 2tbs butter, then tossed them in my mixer with 8oz room temp cream cheese. Filled the wraps and fried in sunflower oil. Made a dipping sauce with a little soy sauce, orange juice, and a tiny bit of oil/flour roux. Superb!

I am really glad you posted this recipe. I hate store bought wonton wrappers. This recipe was easy, although I did find the dough to be a bit sticky and difficult to roll out. For a healthier version I boiled these, but have yet to find the best filling. Thanks for sharing!

I'm currently in a place where they do not sell wonton wrappers. When I first went online the prices for these wrappers are sky high and by the bulk. Fortunately I found a recipes and now I can make crab rangoon whenever I please. Thanks. The only problem I had was the amount of time it took to roll :(.

Excellent for pot stickers; only needed to adjust the water just a couple of Tbs. more to get that elastic smooth dough. Quickly made it in the Cuisinart food processor. Roll out the skins as thin as possible, making them cook and crisp quickly. Don´t roll them too large because the edge flaps collapse when heated.

These were good! A little time consuming, because I put my own concoction in it, but good! I put cheese and sauted onions and bell peppers in it. SO GOOD! We dipped them in some sweet and sour sauce!

I absolutely loved the way these turned out.  I used them for Asian chicken rangoons and the flavor was great. The consistency could have been a little crunchier but that was all my fault for not frying them a little longer.  They were definitely hard work and I don't plan to make them very often, but I will be excited to make them again for special occasions in the future.  I've even considered using this recipe for other different types of fillings.  It would make a GREAT chimichanga.  My husband couldn't stop eating them.

These worked great, I kept in the fridge till the next day. Easily rolled out thin, even though I used a glass. I sealed them with egg whites and they kept their shape great. Cooked up wonderfully~

This Recipe is awesome! I made Jalapeno, Cream Cheese,Cheddar cheese  for the adults and my husband could not stop eating these i only got to try  3 of them! I just did plain wontons for my kids they loved them! We are going to try to make pizza rolls with these! I can't wait to make egg rolls with these they look just like the egg roll wrappers my mom used and boy are they expensive at the supermarket! Who knew they were so easy to make ! These are so easy to roll out and fun to make!  I'm gong to try homemade ravioli also with these!  I can't wait to make wonton soup with these ! the fillings are endless for these they are definately resturant quality ! I would give this an even higher rateing if i could!

This recipe is so good.  I am allergic to crab, but LOVE crab rangoon.  Most of the crab rangoon I've ever had didn't even taste like it had crab in it, so I wanted to make a crabless version.  I haven't made that yet, but I did use this recipe to make home made chow mein noodles and it fried up ultra crispy and good.  Then I decided to make home made egg rolls from a recipe submitted by Mendy Ling and I used store-bought egg roll wrappers and I really do believe that this recipe would have made those egg rolls even better (and they were fantastic) than they were.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

I found these rather simple, the 1st time I made it rolling out was kind of a pain, making sure every surface was well floured helped the 2nd time.  This made awesome cream cheese wontons, my husband loved them, definitely a staple with my chicken fried rice!

These came out perfect - but at a price! I like to do everything myself so I can call it "completely homemade" but after 4 hours and still rolling these out, I gave up and bought won ton wrappers at Walmart for less than $2. I'll only use this recipe again in a pinch because it was so time consuming. They did, however, roll out beautifully. I didn't have any problems with them sticking to my rolling surface, or to each other. And you can roll them very, very thin, which makes for a better potsticker in the end! Thank you for the recipe, and for the workout! :)

I wanted to make the wontons I get at my local chinese place but I couldn't find wonton wrappers anywhere. These fit the bill perfectly, they tasted just right. Be careful to roll the dough out thin enough other wise the wontons will not get crispy in the middle when fried. I gave this recipe 4 stars because since it is so labor intesive I will buy them next time.

These worked out great for me! I don't have much experience with making dough, but it was VERY easy! I used the wonton wrappers to make chips for Italian Nachos. Since I didnt need the chips to be the same size, I cut the dough into small balls. That made it much easier to get them very thin.

Great Recipe! I paired Asian Orange Chicken(also from this site) and Crab Rangoons for a sensational dinner. My kids told me these were the best Crab Rangoons they had ever eaten! 
I shaped the dough into a ball, wrapped in plastic wrap(I sprayed plastic wrap with non-stick spray) and let set for 30 minutes. I had no trouble rolling out the dough. 
Thanks for sharing!

I wanted to make Cindi's egg rolls from this site but getting the wrappers where I live wasn't easy. Some friends recommended this recipe to me. If I'd known making them was this easy I would have done it long ago. The hardest part is rolling them out thin enough, it did wonders for my arm muscles. I'm sure I'll use this again. Thanks.

These wonton wrappers were excellent for the Wonton Soup that I made from AllRecipes©. I would recommend using this recipe to make your own wontons instead of buying them.

Very easy recipe to follow and so much better than any wrappers I have ever bought.  I double the batch but egg rolls get eaten very quickly at my house.

I made the dough in my breadmaker, using the "dough kneading function"  (which does not bake the dough).  I also used high-gluten bread flour to make them super chewy.  We loved the results!

had to add a little extra water. I suggest rolling it out very thin but made a lot and held up well.

Turned out great. I read the reviews from others who tried to make this before. I used my kitchen aid mixer which helped a ton. I had to add an extra 1/4 cup of water as the dough was very crumbly. I added 1 teaspoon of water at a time until it finally formed a dough ball. So total was 1/4 cup of water. I let the dough rest for 30 mins. Then used my kitchen aid pasta roller attachment. Saved me so much time.

On my first attempt at making these wrappers, I learned not to be stingy with the flour.  I should have dusted them or used wax paper between the layers when I stacked the finished wrappers on a plate.  I had the most amazing looking tower of eggrolls, but when i went to  fry them, two of them ripped because the were sticking together.  Lesson learned.  But the effort was still worth it, they came out absolutely delicious.

I had to double the egg and the water mixture because the dough was too tough and dry. Personally, this recipe was okay but it does need some changes.

This takes a while to do. Rolling it out is a pain if you don't have a pasta machine. But I was set on making crab rangoons for a potluck and of course, none of the food markets that were open at 9 pm had wonton wrappers. 

So overall, great recipe. Everyone was incredibly impressed that I made everything by hand but it was a simple, foolproof recipe. I ran out of time so instead of resting with a damp cloth, I wrapped it in plastic wrap and let sit overnight in the fridge. Let it rest on the counter for about 10 minutes then rolled out with plenty of cornstarch. Don't use flour when rolling out. It will make it tacky. Use cornstarch!

It is a great recipe for wonton wrappers.  The one reviewer brelax27 is not so bright, rating a 5 for the dough and a 1 for the work (GTFOH).  The "work" is well worth the product.

Easy to mix up, a workout to roll them out. The recipe I made with these was awesome but the rolling out was difficult. Might have to buy a pasta machine to ease the burden. I will also try again letting the dough rest a bit more and perhaps using a bit less flour. 

Had no issues with them sticking together as there was enough of a flour dust on them after rolling.

Made these exactly as written.I used my pasta machine and they were so easy and quick to make I was amazed; however when I filled and fried was when the amazement really set in.These are better than I could have hoped for. 

ps .I cant imagine getting these rolled thin enough without the pasta machine.

Was good but highly suggest a pasta machine. Don't think it's possible to get to 10 1/2 in. by hand. I also used 2 extra teaspoons of water. Other than that was perfect for the crab ragoons!

I have a gluten allergy so I can get premade wontons. And I love n prefer to cook from scratch. Thank u for adding this recipe. I made wontons from scratch for the first time n then continued to make wonton soup. The only thing I have to do with try to roll out the wontons much thinner to make them like real wontons but my husband didn't complain so not bad for first time lol. Thanks again.

Recipe turned out great, although I wasn't able to get 9 wrappers out of the smaller doughballs.  For me, each small doughball was good for 1 egg roll or 2 crab rangoons.

I've grown up next to or near at least one oriental store my whole life, so it's been a struggle when I moved away. I've never had to make Wonton Wraps before but this recipe was great. I let the dough sit for 30 minutes and used a little less flour. Unfortunately, I did have to roll it out with a rolling pin and that was a tad time consuming. Making more today and I'm planning on using a circular cookie cutter, maybe that will cut 5 or 10 minutes off cooking time?

I have not made your recipe yet but wanted to add that when I spent time in Japan I made many of these into Gyoza, which is similar to a potsticker. I learned that after cutting these out and after making them to put them on waxed paper dusted with cornstarch and that is what keeps them from sticking together. I would make many pans of them and freeze them between the cornstarch dusted waxed paper that were layered high in a plastic container. When I wanted to fry some up, I would just take out what I needed. Very nice way of storing them!

These roll out fine with a rolling pin. I think you would get a better wrapper if you had a pasta machine. When the wrappers are cooked after using a rolling pin I felt like the wrappers were too thick. Tasted good, but not the thin wrappers you would expect.

I made them exactly as the recipe says. Awesome! I was wondering though, has anyone tried to make them with other flours? Like rice, spelt or buckwheat? If so, how'd they turn out? 
Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe to make cream cheese wontons. The texture was perfect! I didn't even have a rolling pin so I used a cylindrical glass to roll the dough. I put in some extra work, but I had so much fun. This is a great recipe

Perfect recipe!! definitively agree with most of the comments. I had to add more water than the recipe says but in the end it all worked out!

Made by hand rolling when I couldn't find any wonton wrappers for a potstickers recipe in stores. These turned out exactly like the store-bought ones in terms of taste, I'll have to work on my rolling technique to make them more even in shape. Loved them, so simple and turn out wonderful.

this recipe is perfect for a light and elastic dough that will fry up well ... but a couple of things i noticed, i definitely did not get 72 won ton wrappers out of this recipe. also, you have to be very careful about the dough sticking together so after assembling the won tons (or whatever else you're making) be sure to lay them out in a single layer on parchment paper (or something similar) and keep covered with a slightly damp towel. this dough did not work very well with baking. but this dough is definitely perfect for frying! i filled with curried mashed potatoes, sauteed onions, corn and peas. delicious!

Got a late night pregnancy craving for cheese wontons. Found this recipe & it was very easy with a few tips. Make sure you let rest at least 30 minutes. Roll paper thin, or else they will be too pastry-like. If frying with a filling make sure you seal tight, dont want any cheese in the oil popping you!

This recipe was perfect. While it was annoying filling up all the wontons/dumplings this recipe yielded(about an hour with a rolling pin and pastry cutter), it tasted great and was easy to make. I already used these wrappers for gyoza, wonton soup and fried wonton. All came out great. I even filled some with a banana filling for a sweet dessert. I see no reason to change it or try anything else. Loved it.

Good recipe if you don't have the option to buy wonton wrappers at the store.  I was planning to buy some, but the store was out of them.  I was lucky to find this recipe!  The only problems I had was that the dough was rather dry, and I had to keep adding more water.  I probably could have added even more water.  Also, it was hard to roll the dough thin enough.  I thought it was as thin as the store bought wrappers, but when I went to eat the egg rolls I made (by the way, I used the "best egg rolls" recipe on here, delish!) they were soft instead of crispy, and I could see they were too thick to be crispy all the way through.  Oh well, I will try to roll them out thinner next time.  But overall, a great recipe to use!

I made these tonight for crab rangoons. They tasted delicious! The only bad thing I have to say about this recipe is that, by hand, it is pretty difficult to roll them out to the thin sheet that they are supposed to be. Other then that, they fried up great, and I can imagine that they would be great for anything else that calls for wonton wrappers. One tip that I do have is to not stack them on top of one another (Even with flour in between each one). Believe me, they will stick. Luckily, I didn't stack them all so most of them came out perfect. :-]

This recipe was fun and simple. I loved making these wrappers and my mom liked them but I wish I could have figured out how to make mine a lot less dark.

It worked great for a pot sticker although it was hard to make thin. Next time I'll make it with a little more water.

The recipe would probably be alright if I only knew how to handle the dough. Although my dumplings tasted great in wonton soup, they were hideously ugly!  I think I'll leave it to the experts from now on, and just buy the wrappers from the store! =)

Easy recipe with great results. The dough is very hard, so it takes quite a bit of muscle to roll it out to the perfect thickness for wontons.

Maybe I didn't roll them thinly enough or maybe I should fry the wontons the next time, since I steamed them. They did not tasted as the ones we usually have at our local Chinese. They were a little but tough but allover they tasted good.
My stuffing for the wonton was: ground chicken, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, salt, pepper and green onions. This tasted really good.
I will  def.make wontons again but probably will buy the wrappers.

I like this recipe because it cooks fast and keeps its shape.  But mine didn't come out crispy so I'll keep looking.  
I used it with the crabby creamcheese wontons from this site and love that filling for crab rangoon.  I just need to find a recipe for crispy wonton wrappers now and i have a hit appetizer.

I tried this directly as follows and I could not - for the life of me - get all that flour in. My dough was elastic with the other ingredients but I had a lot of flour leftover in the bowl.

I made these tonight for some soup. They tuned out good! I stuffed them with ground beef and hoisin sauce. Then I just boiled them in the chicken stock for about 7 minutes. They were a little hard, but I think that is because I overcooked them a little. Thank you for the recipe-I will be making them again! :)

Extremely tasty.  I used these to make pork egg rolls.  I wasn't sure if there would be enough dough or not, so I made two batches (not a combined batch as I didn't want too much of an arm work out).  I think that made enough average sized egg rolls for 6 people (about 2 each).  I used Cindy's egg roll recipe (on this site) with pork stew meat (sliced up on a cutting board after cooked) and slightly less cabbage slaw.  To make sure the egg rolls stay closed when frying in oil (almost covered, in high pan), moisten dough to pinch closed, put in oil with seam face down, and press down with spoon.  The dough puffs up and tries to open.  Definately roll as thin as you can and don't over stuff!  Yum.

This is a MUST in any recipe book! They were a huge hit with family, neighbors and friends. I found that these won-tons taste better and better each time I make them!!!
