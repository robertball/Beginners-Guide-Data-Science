We LOVED this recipe, but we made a few tweaks: 2 bell peppers, caramelized with the onions (butter, brown sugar, salt), and lite sour cream instead of yogurt. We also used ground turkey instead of veggie meat. Absolutely delicious!

I am very surprised this has not received more reviews.  As it stands, it's a 5 star, but it leaves so much room to play w ingredients as well! We love it and make it often.  We use ground beef or ground turkey -- sometimes I saut√© fresh garlic with the veggies, and sometimes we add cilantro on top.  This is great any night of the week but we do love it in the fall and winter on football days!  In the summer we also use all of our ingredients from our local farmers market...even our organic beef.  What a great recipe to utilize readily accessible staple ingredients! Our 3 kiddos love it too!

Used soy chorizo and it was muy fabuloso!  It didn't need the yogurt (but it was good with it), as it was wonderful without it.  The spiciness of the chorizo blended well with the sweetness of the potato.

I really liked this recipe, it's healthy and tasty. I read other reviews that you can substitute other vegetables so I used zucchini and green onion, that's all I had in the kitchen. Very good!

This was very good as written, with some adjustments to our personal taste I think it could be amazing.  Next time I think I will add in garlic to the onions and peppers, and a few spices.

Yum!  Microwaved my sweet potato since its faster, used regular ground beef, and didn't have yogurt.  It was great, will be making it again!

I was lacking quite a few of the ingredients so I switched up the recipe quite a bit. I used a green bell pepper instead of red and also added some red-pepper flakes because I didn't have a green chile pepper and used butter in the bottom of my skillet--not olive oil. I didn't have yogurt so I sprinkled mild cheddar cheese and I used regular ground beef 80% lean. This is very far from the original recipe, but the concept was what I was after.

The final product, even after so much switching around, wasn't bad. It is very filling. It took an hour to cook my large sweet potatoes and in the end my dad, my mom, and I split one potato into quarters and I couldn't even finish my share. (We're not big eaters to start with).

On the whole my version wasn't bad, but my version isn't something I'd really go out of my way to have again. Maybe when I have the right ingredients I'll try it again. This was just an alternative to the hamburger helper my dad intending on making and I'm getting to really hate hamburger helper!
