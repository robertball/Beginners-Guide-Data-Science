Good flavor! I omitted the nutmeg and I added 1 tsp of REAL vanilla.  Note: the baking time/temp needs adjusted. I'd suggest lowering temp to 350 and baking longer.  I followed the recipe (450/15) and it was really dark on the outside but the middle was still gooey.

I am the person who posted the recipe and wanted to comment on the baking time- the 450 degree temp results in a shortcake that is chewy on the outside and soft on the inside (which I love).  If you do not like this then bake at a lower temp for a longer period of time.  

Also this batter does not pour like a reviewer noted- it is thick and you have to spread it.  If yours turns out this way, you are doing it right! Hope that helps!

ONLY reason this is getting a 3 star is because my worst fear came true. The oven to 450 degrees was too high - so it was golden and crispy on the outside and underdone in the center - I even tested with a toothpick, which came out clean (maybe it is my oven, but doubt it, I even baked it longer than recipe called for). JUST BEWARE so this doesn't happen to you, now I have to re-do and adjust to 375 or so.....

4-24-2016  ~Weird.  Everything about this is weird, both before I baked it and after.  First of all, this is not a batter you pour into the pan as the instructions direct.  It is a thick batter you plop into the pan in spoonfuls and then spread out.  Second, the 450 degree oven temperature spooked me and justifiably so.  But I plodded on, curious to follow the directions as written. Needless to say, it did not bake in the directed time.  Not at all.  I kept adding a few minutes at a time until the cake tested done (covered lightly with a piece of oil so as not to overbrown the top). But it was weirdly firm.  Weird after baking as well.  Weird texture. Weird firmness, almost hard.  I did not feel good about serving this at all.  I was prepared to trash it.  Hubs said he thought it was weird too.  This was right before he said yum, he loved it.  Apparently he liked everything I disliked about it.  Two stars from me, a solid four from Hubs, I guess averages out to a 3–star shortcake between us.

I made this according to the recipe. It was wonderful. Softer than I expected, but it was great paired with the strawberries.

Exactly what I was looking for!  This is an easy-to-make, tasty shortcake recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly as it was stated, only change is that I added a 1/4 tsp. cinnamon & baked it at 350 (mainly because our oven over bakes too easily at higher temps).  I will make this again!

I have used this recipe for two years now, every strawberry season. The only thing I change is I use cinnamon instead of nutmeg (My husband hates nutmeg. Hope to try it someday with it.), and I double the cinnamon. I have no problems with the baking time and temp as other reviewers have had. I think this is so good you can eat it on it's own. The only thing I would tell someone trying this for the first time is the recipe says to pour the batter into the pan. You can not pour this, it is a soft dough that you press into the pan.

First off, this will probably be my go to shortcake from now on.  That said, due to reviews I made several changes and will do so again the next time I make this.  Because so many said they had to add baking time, I followed the directions from Trisha Yearwood's  shortcake recipe on foodnetwork.com  and baked this in a 9 inch pan instead of  an 8 inch.  (recipe is very similar)  I was able to bake at the required 450 degrees for 15 min.  I did decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup (personal preference) and thought 3 tsp(or 1T baking powder) was sufficient.  I love nutmeg, but wondered how I'd like it with strawberries so I decreased the nutmeg to about 1/8 tsp.  This was just right for me but think I'd have liked the full 1/4 tsp. as well.  Maybe I'll add some vanilla next time as well, but only as an experiment.  I really think the only necessary change on this recipe would be to either add some baking time (and risk overbrowning) or to change out your pan size from an 8 inch  to a 9 inch size.  The rest of my changes are purely personal .  We really  did love the taste and texture of this shortcake!  Thanks for this submission!

I followed the recipe exactly as written (though I did have to bake an extra 10-15 minutes before it was set in the middle) and this was a FANTASTIC shortcake recipe! We had guests over, and all 5 of us LOVED this recipe. Delicious (especially with some fresh made whipped cream - YUMM!)

This was so yummy.  My son wanted strawberry shortcake for his birthday and this was perfect.  Everyone loved it!  We ran out of strawberries so some of us just poured a little milk over it and it was delicious.  I took the advice of other reviews and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes, perfect!  Great flavors, not to sweet and loved the nutmeg!

Delicious! I followed the recipe, except I omitted the nutmeg and baked at 350* until golden brown and a knife inserted came out clean.  Next time I will do the same, except I'll cook it in my casserole dish instead of  the 8x8 pan so it's not so tall.

This was really fabulous.  We all loved it.  The nutmeg was perfect.  I followed the recipe as written except for cooking it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Beautiful color and texture.

I couldn’t get it to cook in the middle. And I think it had too much baking powder...I could taste it. Also didn’t have the shortcake texture I am used to.

This was so thick and hard to spread in the pan.  I added more milk.   I had to bake it longer than said, and it was very crumbly .

Not being a fan of nutmeg, I swapped that out with vanilla. Also I baked mine in a muffin-top pan. Takes me a few tries to figure out the timing, so this first try was more crisp cookie texture. I do like hard cookies, so that was fine with me.  And it is pointed out numerous times how dry the batter is, it was for sure.  I will make this recipe again, be it for shortcake or over sized snicker-doodle cookies (adding cinnamon sugar to top).

I made this today and doubled it in a 9x13 pan.  I lined it with parchment.  Baked it at 350 unitl it was golden and checked the center with a toothpick.  After it cooled, i put it in the fridge overnight for today.  This morning, i cut it into squares and plated for later.  Topped it with strawberries (soaked the strawberries in a homemade simple syrup) and put that over the cake with homemade whipped cream.  It was delish.  The cake had a wonderful rise to it.  The last shortcake i made from a different recipe didnt' rise much.  Def would make this again.  I have a really nice photo but for some reason it won't let me add that!

Everyone at our party loved this. Great flavor! My mistake was baking it too long. I did change the temperature to 350 and baked for just about 20 minutes (when it was brown on top as instructed in the comments).  I waited just a bit too long to take it out. I was worried.  t had a crusty outer layer and soft center and the strawberry juice softened it up just perfectly.  Im going to make this again. Thanks for sharing!

My family and I absolutely loved this short cake.  I used both strawberries and black berries for my topping and of course whipped topping.  My only complaint is that it got a little too done on top.  Next time I will bake at 375 to 400 and see if that solves the problem.  The taste and texture are both wonderful.

Followed instructions for the mix to a T, baked in my brownie pan divided into 9 wells, on convection at 350° (auto reduced to 325°) for 15 minutes, but they still looked pale so I turned it up to 400° for 5 minutes and they came out golden brown and delicious

There is no way this recipe was tested. It doesn't figure. The temp is too high, the batter doesn't pour as the recipe indicates,  and it is way too dry without adding more milk then whats called for. 
     I kept adding milk until it was  at least spoonable into the prepared pan. ( I am assuming a prepared pan means butter/margarine and dusted with flour) although it didn't specify. 
Also I added vanilla since i was already adding liquid. 
lowered the temp to 350 and 25 minutes. Actually came out pretty good. Hard to screw up the taste using  good ingredients . 
I would love to talk to the person that tested it.

I followed the recipe, just omitting the nutmeg. I spooned it into a round cake pan and baked it at 350 for 30-35 minutes until the top started to get golden. It's really good with sugar, milk and strawberries. The taste and texture are wonderful- tastes so buttery. This is the type of short cake I grew up eating.

Came out really light and delicious, just like my shortcake to be more dense. Cooked at 375 for 20 minutes and perfectly cooked. 4 stars because the temp and time listed on the recipe wouldn't be appropriate for this cake, glad I read the comments.

Didn't change a thing but did mess up on the oven temperature.  Still was great.  Even better when you get the temperature correct.

While the shortcake looked done on the top, it was very under-done on the inside.  Suggest lowering the temp and increasing baking time.  There is NO way this will be done in 15 minutes.  I followed the directions as they were written and I will make adjustments in the future.

To add on.....this is the absolute WORST recipe I've ever tried.  I have now made it 3 times and not once did it turn out right.  I followed the directions explicitly and it was NEVER done.  I ended up throwing it away all 3 times.  Just buy an angel food cake or make one.  It will be 100 times better than this crappy recipe.

This is the exact recipe I was looking for - this is the type of shortcake I grew up with - didn't change anything in the recipe and I don't feel it is necessary.

I make it all the time.  My husband loves it.  I do add a little more milk as it seems a little dry, and I lower the oven temp to about 400 and bake it a little longer.

Great shortbread cake and the nutmeg is a nice touch. I halved the recipe and added 1/3 cup cane sugar to sweeten it up. I like it sweet and rustic - pressed dough into a glass pan and it's perfect!

I was looking for something to make and ran across this.  I looked at the recipe, read the reviews, and immediately jumped up to make it.  It just finished....YUM!  (of course I had to take a corner off to taste it).  I made the recipe as is except I replaced the sugar with Swerve (doesn't mess with your blood sugar) and replaced nutmeg with cinnamon and vanilla.  I just sat down to not only write this but to add it to my recipes as I will be making this again and again.  I can't wait for my family to have dessert tonight!  Thank you so much for sharing this deliciousness.

I love it!  Baked at 425 degrees in convention oven.  I used my hands to do the final mixing and patted into the 8 inch pan.  Crunchy on the outside, soft inside.

This is a very good short cake. I made it for strawberry short cake kabobs. I cut it up in 1`inch cubes. Way better than the bought short cake. Easy to make.

Wish I would have read the reviews first but it still came out yummy. Reduced sugar by a quarter cup. Used heavy cream over milk.

This cake is nummy.  However, while the temp is set high to give the golden crisp on the outside it should likely be turned down through the cooking process to facilitate the inside cooking as well.  Mine was burnt on the outside and raw in the middle.  Followed directions exactly however, I did need to add a bit of extra milk as it was still very powdery when mixed.  So now need to cook another one as the parts that were cooked tasted real good and were a nice texture.  Also quite easy to make with my kitchenaid mixer doing all the work.

Absolutely fantastic! Most perfect cake recipe for strawberry shortcake! It's sweet but not too sweet and is strong enough for the strawberries on top. I didn't alter anything and plan to use the recipe for many other desserts as well.

This was a very nice shortbread recipe that I made to go with my Easter dinner. I made fresh strawberry sauce to go on top and it was very delicious. I recommend this recipe.

My favorite spring/summer dessert! This recipe is so good! If I'm making it for my husband (diabetic), I substitute most of the sugar with Splenda. I love it so much I'll eat the whole pan myself. ?

I followed the recipe exactly (except I added 1/2 a tsp of nutmeg instead of a 1/4) and it came out so perfect! I didn't have to adjust the temp or the time and it still came out evenly cooked. Definitly the best strawberry shortcake I've ever had.

I love this recipe! I made it just as written and the nutmeg flavor is wonderful. This will be my go-to recipe for strawberry shortcake from now on.
