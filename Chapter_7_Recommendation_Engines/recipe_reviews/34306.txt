I'm not sure if it was just me, but I had a really hard time getting these thin enough even using a flat spatula & silpats.  If they are not thin enough they end up being way too chewy.  If they get too brown you have literally about 3 seconds to get them rolled before they become too brittle.  The actual taste of the cookie was ok.  I'm not sure I'll try these again.
