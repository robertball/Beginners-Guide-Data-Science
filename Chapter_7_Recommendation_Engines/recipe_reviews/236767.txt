Delicious! Looked for a recipe where I had the ingredients on hand. Didn't but easily added my own replacements. Seasonings on hand to mix with butter: minced garlic, basil, parsley. Cereal on hand: Post Great Grains. Turned out well: tender and juicy! Thanks!

Loved it. Super easy. I used butter, garlic infused olive oil, and a little salt because I didn't have the saute things. Worked really well. Also cut my tenders in half so they would cook quicker. It was a big hit, chicken didn't dry out and all around yummy. Will definitely make again!

I used the recipe minus the butter.  I just fried in canola oil, and it still had a good flavor.  This recipe needs salt, but after I cooked and salted it, the family did enjoy!

Kids liked this one. I couldn't find the sauté express so I used the LOL butter spread of the same flavor and added olive in to the pan. Pan fired in batches and finished off on the oven for 15 at 375.  I added dried parsely, paparika and onion opweder to the bread crumbs.

I followed the recipe except I just browned the chicken in a skillet and then put it in the oven to finish cooking.  Thus, didn't need as much oil!  Family really liked it!

I cut the tenders into cubes.  I coated with ranch dressing, and rolled in corn flakes.  When I ran out, I rolled in Panko.

I used clarified butter for pan frying. Next time I will reduce the flour to 1/3 cup and use 1.5 teaspoons of dry ranch dressing mix (I use the bulk season jar). I also plan to add more spices; garlic granulated, salt and pepper. Hubby was very happy with this recipe and I loved the ease and simplicity. It’s a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

this was delicious! But took a lot longer to cook than the recipe said. I'll cut my tenders in half next time
