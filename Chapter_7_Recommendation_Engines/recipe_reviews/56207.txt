My mother taught me this recipe and in fact it appears almost vervatum in the 1958 "Thoughts for Buffet" cookbook on pg 211. It uses 2 eggs (separated with whites stifflybeaten and folded in as last step) no water but 2 Tb lemonjuice and 1 Tblemon rind.itis delicious.my mother taught me to bake it with the mold (I use bundt pan) sitting in pot of water in theoven. I would liketo try a healthier version with less butter sometime.

This was very good...but it was nothing like pudding. It turned out like carrot bread or cake. We sliced it and put butter on it.
