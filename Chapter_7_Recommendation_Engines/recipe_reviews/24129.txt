I used bacon instead of sausage.   I precooked the bacon and crumbled it onto the cresent rolls.  Very good!

okay - i didn't follow the recipe exactly... i browned some onion, mushrooms, turkey sausage (already cooked).  i used refrigerated pizza dough, rolled it out onto jelly-roll clay pan. i cooked this for about 8 mins on 400.  Then i spread the sausage concoction, 5 eggs mixed with half n half, smoked paprika, a little nutmeg, white pepper,  salt.  Then i spread with cheddar, monterey jack and fresh grated parmesan cheeses... baked 15 more mins at 375.  Let set 10 mins. But it was wonderful!

This recipe turned out very well and will likely be my lunch for a couple of days :) I did substitute a few things like fresh bell peppers and mushrooms. Next time I make it, I'll likely use fresh tomatoes as well. 

To TRACIOK, I think I know where you went wrong. Next time, try just staying with the suggested amount of eggs. It doesn't seem like enough, but they will fluff out.

I prepped this the night before.  I basically did everything the night before except baking it.  I set it in the fridge overnight and then popped it in the oven the next morning.  This turned out great.  My eight year old loved it.  A few personal tweaks I made were: used turkey sausage, added fresh mushrooms, omitted  the chiles and seasoned for taste using onion powder, basil leaves and oregano.

This didn't work out for me.  (but I didn't follow the recipe exactly).  I used fresh mushrooms instead of jarred, and topped the pizza with another crescent roll.  and 6 eggs wasn't enough - I upped it to 10.  It was a watery mess.  I'm guessing it was the fresh mushrooms, or having a top made a difference.  I did increase the bake time ... i will try again.  I  hope to see successful reviews from others!

This recipe was awesome. I used pepperjack cheese instead of mozerella. I also doubled the cresent rolls.  I highly recommended it.

Very good and easy to make. I put the bottom together the night before. I used sausage links cut up because that's what I had and left out the tomatoes so my children would like it. I think it would be even better with the tomatoes though. Will make this one again, maybe with bacon?

We skipped the mushrooms and tomatos, was good but I think next time will cut the cheese in half. Way too much grease from the cheese and it over powering.

Delicious!!  I used canned tomatoes without the chilies, and it was a big hit at my house.  The crescent rolls were a bit of a pain, but I may try a different brand next time we have this yummy breakfast.

Tastes good, although I don't think I'll be cooking this a lot, way too high in calories and made me feel lazy after eating it.

Very tasty! And easy. A bit too hot for us with the chiles, but they can easily be left off or replaced!

This breakfast pizza was yummy! It is a little spicy, but we like it that way. I made it exactly as written except that I added a few green peppers and fresh mushrooms (saut√©ed for a little bit in butter). I baked it for 8 min and then added the egg mixture and needed to bake it another 10 min. so the eggs were set.

I didn't have chilies and i used fresh tomatoes.  It was really easy and so delicious.  I baked the rolls in the oven for about 10 mins before adding all the goodies. The crust was perfect. I also had to cook mine about 15 extra minutes for the eggs to set.

I skipped the mushrooms and Worcestershire sauce b/c I didn't have any; and only used 12 oz of cheese. I had to bake longer than stated in recipe, but it was delicioso!! Will definitely make this again.

I just made this and it turned out beautiful to look at but I was highly disappointed when I started to dish it out. It was way too watery and I followed the recipe EXACTLY! Not sure if I would try this again.
