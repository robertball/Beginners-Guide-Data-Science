1.20.20  Couldn’t taste a whole lot of banana flavor, but that’s OK, because these turned out well.  Looked a little homely coming out of the oven, so I did give them a light dusting of confectioners sugar which gave them just a bit more eye appeal without a ton of calories.  Very quick to make, tastes like a tender cake doughnut with nice texture, but a heck of a lot healthier than deep frying.  Bake4fun, thanks for sharing your recipe.
