I did make some modifications on this recipe but it served as my inspiration for a really nice lunch.  I cut way back on the mayo because the amount of dressing for only 1 12 oz package of broc/slaw mix is just too much.  I cut the mayo to 1/3-1/2 cup and it was still plenty creamy and enough dressing for the salad.  I also subbed rice vinegar (about 2 tablespoons) because it made more sense (to me) with the asian flavor of the sesame oil.  I did not use the ramen seasoning packet at all.  I'm sorry, I just can do it - way too much sodium and the meaty flavor of the packet just doesn't work for me.  I did use the full amount of sugar and oil called for.  I honestly think that this recipe could have used 2 of the 12 oz packages of the broccoli slaw.  I ended up using a bit of red onion and scallions to give this just a bit more color on the plate.  Between the ramen, sunflower seeds and slivered almonds, this salad has a ton of crunch.  Next time, I will stick with the mods I already made and up it with the extra package of slaw mix.  The addition of some chopped cilantro and some julienne red pepper would also add a bit more color.  I will also stash this one away in my recipe box for later.  I think the addition of some shredded chicken (or cooked shrimp) could easily turn this into an entree salad.  Thanks Donna!

I have a gluten free kiddo so couldn't do the ramen noodles.  Instead, added the 1/4 cup of slivered almonds (without toasting in the pan) and added about 1/3 cup of dried cranberries.  Turned out great!  Followed everything else to a "T" and really enjoyed it.

I did not make any changes. You can't rate something you don't follow to the letter.  This was a nice twist on my regular brocolli salad.  I will make it again.

made this exactly as recipe called for.  it was very good and I will definitely be making again.  One thing I noticed is the recipe called for onions but the photo shows green onions..  I made it with red onion and it was very tasty.  

Next time I think I will add sliced apples.

Very Good. My changes: Mixed sauce in large serving bowl. Omitted sesame oil, almonds, noodles & sunflower seeds *didn't have them on hand*. Added 2 bags of broccoli slaw to sauce. Added 2 large cut up apples & 1 cup of craisins.

Utterly delicious!  I toasted the sunflower seeds for extra crunch and used pistachios rather than almonds.  While this recipe makes a lot of dressing, it keeps well in the fridge until next time.  Believe me, there will definitely be a next time for this slaw in our house!

The only thing I didnt add was sunflower seeds and only because I didnt have any in the house; otherwise I followed it to the T and for once it came out like I wanted it too!  My honey loved it and and went really good with grilled lamb chops, apple sauce and little colorful new potatos!  Next time I may add raisens or fined chopped green apple.

I made it and everyone at our dinner party loved it. I used green onions instead of a regular onion. And I toasted the almonds separately from the ramen because the almonds brown faster. Really great tasting slaw.

I've made this for several occasions (and several dinners) for the past few years and it always turns out well, and people always comes back for seconds.  The crunch adds interest and the flavours are great so it seems more special than just a salad.  Love this recipe!

I was looking for an Asian slaw recipe and this was perfect. I made this without the Ramen noodles, olive oil and sunflower seeds (because I did not have the noodles or seeds in the pantry ) and it tasted delicious. Sometimes I add raisins or Craisins.
