This is a wonderful recipe!  I added black beans, carrots, and more garlic.  A very light, clean, and refreshing soup that is super yummy too. Perfect with a hunk of your favorite bread.  You can always experiment with your own favorite seasonings. Highly recommend this versatile soup! Thanks so much for sharing!

I changed it to more of an Italian flavor...Basil and a touch of Oregano instead of the Cummin...At serving, sprinkled with Parmesean Cheese and finely chopped green onions..Served with crunchy Garlic Bread

This is a great soup recipe - I did "doctor it" with additional seasonings such as Worchestershire sauce and a bit of oregano and basil (minusing the cumin), and, I took all the seeds out of the tomatoes prior to adding to soup.  Everyone LOVED it!

Wonderful summer soup.  I put a lot more corn than was called for and cut back the broth to 4 or 5 cups so that it would be thicker.  We added some hot sauce when served.

Very good soup!  Would recommend other spices than cumin, since not everyone likes it - garam masala and fresh cilantro, Italian seasoning, or my favorite, Hungarian paprika, both sweet and hot.  Found that it needed to simmer a bit longer, about 25 minutes. Added a pinch of sugar to counteract acidity, a bay leaf (remove at the end of cooking) and less veg broth, 1 carton + 1 cup of water. If you have fresh parsley, add some to the soup at the table. Excellent use of green tomatoes if you're not into frying or canning/pickling them!

This soup had a surprising tanginess to it. We thought it was a little bland, but bacon bits really perked it up.

This was a great recipe.  I really loved the fresh vegetables and combination.  I varied slightly based on ingredients I had.  I put allspice, a potato, a shallot, and a dash of worcestershire and it was great.  Will definitely make this again.

I was looking at 1/2 bushel end of season green and red tomatoes at end of October, with lots of fresh frozen corn in freezer.  This looked like a winner and it was!!  We did add leftover roasted chicken, including broth, and garbanzo beans, but I'm sure it's just as good stand alone.  Also, had made roasted green tomatoes the night before and used that, thickened the soup nicely.

I have a garden!  I have been making this soup for years, after finding the recipe here.  Made exactly according to the recipe, giving it 5 stars.  Just now, I used chicken boullion cubes instead of vegetable broth and also a Knorr's cube that my daughter brought in from Thailand, giving it a kick.  Soup tastes really good even though it is not even finished.

This soup is great eaten like tortilla strip soup. Place tortilla chips/strips in the bottom of the bowl and pour the soup over it. Garnish with grated cheese.

A wonderful soup!  And a perfect end to the reign of my over zealous tomato plants.  I used 6 medium green and 6 mixed bag-ripe yellow and red tomatoes, 8 cups of instant veggie broth, added a handful of chopped up fresh basil, a couple little yellow squashes and a can of red kidney beans.  Then just to punch it up (we like things smokin') I threw in 3/4 cup of Bueno brand frozen hot red chile puree.  The cut sweet corn is such a great compliment to the tangy tomatoes.  Awesome!!!  My meat-mongerin' family didn't even notice that we were going Vegan for the night and hunkered-in like it was steak!  Took me all of 1/2 hour to make a huge pot.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  What a practical, delicious fall dish.

This was a good recipe to use for my green tomatoes. I also added carrots, a bit more garlic, green beans, and red & green peppers. It was a bit more bland than I typically like my soups, but I will use this recipe again, maybe add a little seasoning.

Very good! We had an abundance of both fresh red and green tomatoes.  I added a few things as was suggested by previous reviews.  Used 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce,1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes &  fresh basil to taste.

Fresh & tasty soup! Added black beans and a bit of cayenne pepper & worcestershire to make it a bit heartier and more zesty.  Will definitely make this again with next fall's green tomatoes!

I had some green tomatoes that I knew wouldn't ripen on the vine, now that it's the end of summer, so I found this recipe and we LOVE it!  I made some modifications based on the other reviews and here's what I came up with... a 'Mexican' version.  I put in three cloves of garlic, 1 1/2 tsp each of ground cumin, dried oregano, sweet Hungarian paprika and ground chipotle; 1 bay leaf, 1/2 cup (packed) each of fresh basil and parsley, pureed in the blender, and .   I added 11/2 cups of canned, diced tomatoes.  I used a 14 oz tin of black beans,  3 cups of frozen corn, 4 cups of chicken bouillon stock and a pinch of sugar.  It was just the right degree of 'hot' for us with the chipotle.  I added a breast of shredded chicken at the last minute (just popped it from the freezer into the pot to cook, then shredded it after).  We topped it with grated Tex-Mex cheese, cilantro and tortilla chips.  Amazing!!  Definitely a keeper! Thanks everyone for your great tips.

Pretty delicious soup!
As recommended, I 
- used 4 cups of broth
- dash of Worcestershire
- served topped with Parmesan
- used Basil and Oregano instead of cumin

I used some potatoes and a little pasta in place of green tomatoes. Added a can of kidney beans.

I made it today! Delicious use of my green tomatoes. That is why I gave 5 stars:) I added coriander as well as the  cumin. And since I had homemade turkey broth I used that instead of veggie broth.

I used two cans of crushed/diced fire-roasted tomatoes instead of red tomatoes, and added a can of black beans.
Update: This has become my go-to "kitchen sink" soup recipe, meaning I use whatever I have in the pantry or fridge. This time I used black beans, fire-roasted tomatoes and a can of enchilada sauce. I also added some leftover rice and garnished it with crushed tortilla chips.

This has to be the BEST start for Gumbo. I started to make the soup and kept thinking " something is missing" it tastes good, but it can be great.  I added chicken leftover from the fridge and some okra from the garden,left over rice and Adobo and white pepper and the family is raving about it. Some crusty bread and this makes a great meal. Thanks for the start-up.

This is a great recipe for a hot summer day. I increased the amount of corn slightly and used tomatillos rather than green tomatoes. I also increased the amount of garlic to 3 cloves. The soup is slightly spicy but also refreshing.

We have friends who are vegans, and they loved this soup just as much as we did (and we like a bit of meat with our meals)  I added a chopped leek (was in the fridge) and tomatillos since green tomatoes are a seasonal item here in MN.  I also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and frozen corn instead of fresh.  The weather dudes are talking inches of snow tonight. . . fresh is what is on hand.  I also added a can of black beans per another reviewer and I added some chopped jalapeno since most reviewers recommend more heat.  The jalapeno gave just enough for heat for those with milder palates, but some of us added a dash of hot sauce too.  Thank you for this idea.  A taste of summer in the winter.

This was a good soup and a good way to use up some garden veggies. We followed the directions except adding in a few peppers (From the garden) and a can of black beans. We increased the spice level by adding some taco seasoning and increasing the cumin.

This soup is delicious - nearly perfect.  I like it best without any seasoning at all... no cumin, no italian seasoning.  The flavor of the vegetables is perfect.  I only use 3 cups vegetable broth because we like a thicker soup and because my red tomatoes are very juicy.  A sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top makes it just right.

My boyfriend, the soup junkie, really enjoyed this; I thought it could have used a touch less cumin. I used only 4 cups of broth and ran the stick blender through it to thicken it up a bit. I’ll garnish the leftovers with fresh cilantro. I think this would be great with roasted green chiles. Nice, simple soup.

Wonderful summer recipe!  I did as others suggested and added some black beans.  I offered tabasco on the side.  It was an excellent soup and the leftovers were even better.
