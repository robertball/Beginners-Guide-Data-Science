I didn't make the cucumber salad but the salmon and sauce was really well. You can buy bottled ponzu in the Asian section of most supermarkets or make your own (basically soy sauce and citrus). To the other reviewer: why would you rate a recipe without even trying it?

I don't know what went wrong. The ginger-scallion "crust" ended up being nothing more than soggy, oily ginger, scallion, and garlic pieces sitting on top of salmon. I followed the directions exactly. I assumed it was supposed to get crunchy on top. Am I wrong there? I don't know, but it looked so unappetizing that we couldn't even eat it. I was so disappointed because it sounded so good. I am mad that all of that mincing was a complete waste. :(  Oh, and 92 grams of fat per serving? You've got to be kidding me!

This dish is sublime if prepared according to the recipe. It literally tastes like a $34 entree at a fancy restaurant. I made it for a Valentines day dinner and my husband loved it. Make sure you also prepare the cucumber salad and Ponzu cream sauce--it's the combination of these with the crusted salmon that make this dish so outrageously delish.

This recipe inspired me to finally join "all recipes.com" and write a review at last.  I made this last night for the very first time.  I agree with Jimmy D, Fireguy needs to make the whole recipe and Jimmy D, the cucumber salad was amazing and really added to the dish - you guys need to make the whole thing.   My guests loved the salmon and I would definitely make the dish again.   My husband seared two whole salmon fillets (48 oz - giving me 12 x 4oz fillets) on the grill for me and then I rubbed them with the honey and ginger crust.  The crust didn't crisp up for me either but the flavours of it just soaked into the salmon.  I would recommend using less peanut oil.   Also, if cooking for a smaller number, stick to 8oz per person - the original recipe works with 4 x 8oz portions - as it's so yummy, a smaller portion of 4 oz is not enough!  The ponzu butter was to die for!   The 4 stages means a little bit of work but this recipe is truly worth it.

Wow - reviewers weren't kidding, this was amazing! Complex blend of flavors and textures that complemented each other beautifully.  I made this as listed except for the ponzu butter sauce, which terrified me a little with the amount of fat involved. O.o I used 1/2&1/2 instead of heavy cream, and cut the 1/2cup of cold butter to 1/4 cup. Still VERY flavorful and creamy.   I also didn't have ponzu sauce so I made my own: 3 parts soy sauce, 2 parts vinegar, 1 part orange juice and 1/2 part sesame oil.   Most of the work here is prep, with the actual cooking taking very little time. Make sure to get the ponzu butter to the stage where you're reducing by half before you throw the salmon in the skillet to sear, if you want things to come out done all at about the same time. =)

This was the 1st time i baked salmon.  This recipe turned out pretty good.  I didn't make the cucumber salad or butter but the ginger scallion was very good.

A lot of prep work, but worth every second!  I used wine in lieu of the rice wine vinegar and cut the butter in 1/2, and was amazing!

The first time I made this dish I only made the crust portion of this dish and it was delicious.  The second time I made it I used pork chops instead of salmon and it was even better!

I got rave reviews from the friends I cooked this for, but I feel a little put out that the "Ponzu Sauce" doesn't print out on the shopping list, and even if it did, I was unable to find it anywhere.  I read that it weas a sweet citrus sauce, so I used some marmalade instead, but who knows what that taste did.  Bottom line, this recipe is a pain in the butt to make, but it yields great results.

My In-laws are Japanese, I made this dish for my husband and his family. They loved it! The only suggestion they made was to maybe add a bit of sugar with the cucumber salad. It was a but too tart. Other than that it was phenomenal!!! The prep time is well worth it. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This dish was really nice. To make crust crispy, I fried it a bit until they got crispy, and immediately put it through a strainer and seared the salmon with the strained oil (strained it a few times to make sure the oil was clear). The salmon had a really nice flavor to it from this oil. The crust was nice and crispy.  You have to make all three components of the dish as the sauce is a bit rich and the tangy pickles cut through this.

Maybe Ill food process the ingredients for the ginger crust so that it can soak in a bit more, it didnt have as much impact as it could have had. besides that everything was abslutly great. didnt get a chance to make the salad, will next time!! and i never used the ponzu butter becuase i never noticed it till now. it was great without!

I wanted to try a recipe that used Japanese ingredients like mirin and ponzu...this was soooo good.  I've never cooked japanese food before, so I wasn't sure what it would end up tasting like; but this was so easy, and the flavors were awesome.  I would definitely make this again.  The only thing I changed was using sake instead of dry white wine because that's what I had on hand, and it tasted great.  I'm going to try this with chicken I think....and maybe some japanese rice.

A wonderful combination of tastes.  Make sure to drain the cucumber salad well or its liquid will dilute the ponzu butter on the plate.    The 'crust' didn't fry well for me, but was still tasty.

This is really a deliciou recipe. Worth all the effort. I used part of the salad and sauce on salmon as given in the recipe (for the hubby) and part of it on mushrooms made just as salmon. It really was extraordinary! And I did use evaporated milk instead of cream and used smart balance butter (in reduced quantity too) The ponzu butter separated a bit but it was still very good!! Lastly, I made ponzu sauce at home with 1/3 quantity soy sauce, 1/4 quantity lemon juice and instant dashi granules. Thanks for a fabulous recipe Ryan.

Very nice Asian "fusion" dish. I don't think a recipe with cream and butter could qualify as a traditional Japanese dish, but no matter because fusion cuisine demands a high price when dining out and with this recipe you can have the same quality at home. It actually is not that hard to prepare either, the salad is done in advance and you can prep the "crust" in advance as well. When you are ready to actually cook the salmon the whole thing only takes about 15 minutes. I made this recipe just as written and served it with steamed white rice. The salmon was perfectly cooked; moist flavorful and tender. The sauce was lovely, no extra salt needed with the ponzu sauce I had, I would definately taste the sauce before adding any salt. This is a gourmet quality recipe.

Made this for the hubby last night and it was amazing. It def tasted like it came from an expensive restaurant. It just took awhile to make since there were so many diff components. Next time around shouldn't take as long. I have made so many diff types of salmon and this has to be the best. :)

I had to make my own Ponzu sauce. Could not find it at any of the four grocery stores in town. My crust was soggy. Waiting to make the butter until after the fish was in the oven was a little off on the timing.  My hubby and two children thought it was alright but it was a unanimous vote that this recipe was not worth the preparation effort. Also, many of the ingredients were not on hand. I don't do much Asian inspired cooking so the cost to buy everything for this was just too much for something that was rather blah. I always try to make as written the first time I make anything. Perhaps if I had deviated and broiled the fish I would have had a better result. The fish WAS moist and cooked well it just had a soggy "crust". I think anybody who has these ingredients already in their pantry and broils their fish at the end will like this. Also, if you have knife skills that allow you to mince quickly this may be more worth it to you then this was to me.

This recipe was fantastic, the best salmon I have had! The Cucumber salad was a wonderful addition to the fish. Easy to make and looking forward to making it again!

Made this last night for my wife's bday. Followed recipe exact and it was one of the best meals I've ever made. Definitely start ponzu butter before starting fish. And to the ppl who couldn't figure out how to brown the crust...have u ever seen the broiler setting on your oven?  Your rights to review should be revoked.

Phenomenal. I made it vegetarian by using tofu in place of salmon and I skipped the cucumber salad. Fresh ginger is a must!
