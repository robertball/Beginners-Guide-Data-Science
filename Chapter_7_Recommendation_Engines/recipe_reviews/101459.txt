Yum Yum.  Since I am pregnant I have a craving for Penn Station Subs.  Hubby hates this...no drive through and they are always busy.  Now I can do this on my own.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for the post.

I made this with a bit of filet mignon that needed using up, and I pretty much just eyeballed the dressing. It was SO delicious! I would definitely recommend it. Thanks!

This was a really good sandwich. I made two batches, one with real meat for the family and one with Smart Strips veggie strips. Both batches were good. I forgot the horseradish and added too much steak sauce. I also added a slice of american cheese to each sandwich. Hubbie was not impressed, 1 daughter went crazy and loved it, other daughter could careless. Good possibility I would make this again.
