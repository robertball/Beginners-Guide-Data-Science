I made this right away for the boys for lunch after I saw Keri talk about it on Facebook. I did not have tomatoes with green chili peppers (aka RoTel), I used one can of diced tomatoes and one half can of diced mild green chilies. I also used reduced fat sour cream. I did add a little fresh ground pepper. My kids and husband were skeptical that they would like this but I'll tell you--they absolutely loved it. What the kids didn't eat, my husband inhaled. EXCELLENT way to use up pantry items everyone has to make a filling and cost-effective lunch. Next time, I'll take Keri's suggestion and throw in some leftover taco meat or maybe use homemade taco seasoning in place of the seperate seasonings. Thanks for the winner--this one's going in the wooden recipe box.

"Souper" easy and delicious.  I cut the recipe down to half for the 2 of us and proceeded as directed.    It was the perfect amount to go with a huge tossed salad for our dinner with just enough left over to go to work with DH for his lunch.   Who doesn't love mac n cheese and to put it in a soup?  Perfection!!

So simple and so great tasting! I made it as directed except I couldn't resist throwing in a can of cheddar cheese soup for extra cheesy goodness.

Really surprised how good this is! I love making soups and usually make soup in the crock pot with lots of goodies and that means lots of chopping! Not this time! I did makes some additions such as diced smoked sausage and a can of corn and I sauteed an onion with the sausage. Added lots more milk and a packet of dry chicken gravey mix. I often add this to soup for flavor and gives it some body. I will be making this again! Thanks!

Wonderful on a chilly night.  However, I don't rinse the macaroni, I just drain it.  The 'starch' makes for a thicker soup.  I've also added bite sized chunks of browned ground beef to make it even heartier!!

I made this recipe as written at first (with the exception of adding a beans for protein) and it was way too garlicky. I usually like garlic, but it was too much. So I added a can of cream of chicken soup (cream of cheese would have been better, but I didn't have any). Then it wasn't spicy anymore so I added a little hot sauce. I may make this again out of necessity, but it's not something is plan out making.

Definitely cut down on the garlic if you make this, but otherwise, it's great!
Great concept, but looking at the garlic, I thought 1 Tbsp seemed like a lot... I used 1/2 Tbsp, and it's still WAAAAAY too much. Nigh inedible.

This was a great way to use up pantry items...my family dug into it before I pulled out the sour cream. Even hubby had some and didn't say nothing about the tomatoes in it. One thing to remember as I didn't watch this like I should was making sure not to over cook your noodles or it will make the batch taste watered down. That was solely my doing. But with a quick adjustment with broth and milk it was fine. Will make again. TY Keri

I didn’t think it would be good at first, but it’s super good!  Gotta add ground beef next time!

I liked this. I'm not a fan of mac-n-cheese, so this really spruced it up. I used chunky salsa because I was out of Rotel. I thought it was a bit heavy on pepper and garlic powder, so I just sprinkled those in to taste. I'll probably make this again.

It is not a soup as all the liquid is soaked up by the mac and cheese.

I only used 1 cup milk and 10.5 oz macaroni and cheese.  I will make it again.   It was very easy and fast to make.

I followed the recipe exactly and all I got was a spicy, over cooked pot of hardly cheesy glop. The pasta kept absorbing all the liquid I put in. There was way too much spice (for my taste.)
