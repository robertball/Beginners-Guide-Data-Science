The flavor was okay.  I personally felt it was way too salty.  I might try to make this again by cutting the soy sauce in half.  I might also add some oatmeal or rice to make it a little thicker.  I had a really difficult time with the burgers sticking together; they just fell apart.  I like the idea of using tahini and almonds though.  I felt like the almonds gave it a nice texture (and I'm REALLY big on texture).  This is at least worth experimenting with.

These patties taste amazing. I agree, they do fall apart  sometimes...do they need to be flipped anyways? I think they just need to be heated and crisped on the one side a bit. But these are on the regular rotation in our house- everyone enjoyed the flavor and texture. I may suggest switching the soy sauce to light, for less saltiness or even tamarind sauce for the flavour, but I enjoy it with regular or tamarind just fine.

These burgers are a great vegetarian option, and fun to make! With just a little tweaking they won't fall apart, and aren't too salty.

Assuming you aren't intolerant, add a few tablespoons of vital wheat gluten to the mix. It helps glue the burgers together and adds some protein. (Tossing all your ingredients into the food processor also makes the chunks small enough to pack tightly)

Replace some of the soy sauce/tamari with water to cut the salt and keep the mix moist enough to hold together.

these tasted really good. they did fall apart quite a bit, especially trying to flip them over. I recommend them, just dont expect them to look pretty.

Don't tell the people you are serving this to the ingredients unless you want them to eat something else!

I reduced the soy sauce by half and these were salty to the point of being inedible. They didn't hold together and the flavor was just off.
