My family has been making this since I was a little girl.  We use a spring form pan and line with lady fingers then the filling.  Chill and serve.

This recipe is GREAT as I said in my first review.  Perfect cassata cake that is even better than any NYC Italian bakery I have ever tasted because it is not sickly sweet and made with fresh filling rather than bagged pre-made filling.  ***BUT***  DO NOT use the chocolate for the top...I always use the whipped cream frosting (made with a teaspoon of gelatin) from this website.  I have never seen nor have I had Cassata cake with chocolate frosting.  The combination of this cake with that frosting is PERFECT!!!  =)

This was awesome! I made this for Easter and served on top of cake dessert shells. I changed the recipe a little bit, instead of chocolate squares I used mini semi sweet pieces. My big Italian family couldn't get enough of this.

Recipe calls for too much cinnamon.  Suggest cutting cinnamon down to 1/4 tsp.  Also suggest using mini choc chips in place of choc squares.  If you're looking for enough filling for only one layer, be sure to cut the recipe in half as this recipe yields enough for 3 or 4 layers.

A bit too grainy~ I tried another recipe that used butter and a flour mixture.  It was a bit more work, but it was smooth and yummy.
