We thought these were missing something...maybe more sugar? Sort of bland and we really couldn't detect the cheese, even though I topped them with extra cheese before baking. I also topped some w/ a slice of jalapeno from my garden, and that added a kick, which was nice. I don't know that I would be making these again, but Thanks for sharing the recipe. :)

We really liked this recipe made as written.  Next time I might add a little more cheese and hope it doesn't mess up the consistency.  My husband loved them as is.  I made full recipe and made six large muffins.  Will make again.

They were a little dry and pretty tasted like cornbread only. But good. And you can eat what you want, instead of cutting a whole pan of cornbread.

I agree with some of the other reviewers - it needs something. I'm adding more salt, sugar, & cheese to the other half of the batch & hope they will have more flavor. I made 12 muffins (see photo) & still have half of batter remaining.

We were disappointed with the muffins. It was too dry and could not taste the cheese. I have a couple recipes we really like and will keep using them. I don't recommend these.

I didn't have the whole kernel corn to add. I used buttermilk instead of milk....and doubled the amount of butter and cheese.  Also I added a 1/8 teaspoon of powdered onion in each muffin....it added just a hint of onion taste.  Also, I used Bob's Red Mill corn meal.  An amazing blend of flavors leading to a delicious cheddar cheese corn muffin!

These are bland and not really worth the effort to make corn muffins from scratch instead of a mix.

I  used habanero monterey jack cheese for a little extra heat. These muffins were moist and delicious. I would use this recipe again.

Usually cornmeal anything is dry but these were moist and delicious. I didn't have kernel corn in my pantry so substituted cream corn and added a few drops of hot sauce. I also doubled the cheese with sharp cheddar.

These light and tasty muffins are so easy to make.  I actually got 14 muffins from this mix, instead of 12.
