I've made lots of versions of Chocolate Pecan Pie.  This one is the one I use when I know it's got to be good.  Tastes like an undercooked brownie in a pie shell... delicious!!!

Originally I wrote my review based on the fact that I had never tried pecan pie before and so I didn't know what to compare it to so I gave this recipe the benefit of the doubt.  However, after trying pecan pie for the first time not to long ago I realize now that this does not compare.  I wouldn't make this again.

Wow! This pie is sure to cure any chocolate cravings. It was simple to make and tasted fabulous. Just be warned that it doesn't exactly have that "pecan pie" taste- it does taste a little more like a nutty brownie. But you should definitely try it!

This recipe pleased both the traditional pecan loving (my mother in law) and the "not a fan of pecan pie" (my husband).  We will definitely repeat this one.
