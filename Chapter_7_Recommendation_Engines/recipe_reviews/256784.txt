Excellent! I loved this take on a bean dip using white kidney beans and  salsa verde. The Mc Cormick white chili packet really tied it all together. There is only two of us and I barely had enough to scrape up enough to take to work tomorrow. It was that good! This was spicier than I had anticipated and that is a good thing! If you like it really spicy use pepperjack cheese. This will go over very well for any type of party you are having I promise you. Super simple and 5 stars all the way!

Delightful. We did one jalape√±o mixed in and added the second one on the top.
