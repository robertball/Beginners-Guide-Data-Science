Tried and true!  I use this for most everything all the time.  I have also subbed superfine white rice flour in place of the brown and it works perfectly.  I have a 5 litre jar with this ready in house always.  I use this cup-for-cup in cakes, cookies and sweets.  For crepes I take away two tablespoons adding buckwheat flour to the mix.  For savoury and bread recipes that I am converting I typically use 3/4 cup of this mix to 1 cup regular wheat flour adding 1/3 cup of another flour (sorghum, millet, quinoa or similar) because it adds some flavour and nutrients.  Thanks for sharing.

I converted this blend of awesomeness to a self-rising flour by adding 1.5 tsp baking soda, 1.5 tsp salt and 1.5 Tbsp baking powder.

I made this flour and used it in the "Fluffy Pancakes" recipe on this site.
It was so good it was hard to tell it was gluten free. 
Thanks a ton!

This is bar none the best GF flour substitute. I use it in all my non GF recipes and baking and the results are always delicious. Family and friends would never know it was GF if they weren't told.

This is really a great 1 for 1 gf flour substitute! I've been using for quite a while with just about everything! I have also subbed white rice flour for the brown (all I had at the time) and it still is wonderful!

So far so good. I used this to sub the flour in Tasty Buns. I did add 1/4 cup extra flour to the dough because I needed to form the veggie burger buns. My sister loved it! Next up will be banana bread.

Substituted cornstarch for xanthan gum. Made Greek Yogurt Pancakes with it and they were wonderful. Two new recipes at once!  So grateful to have found this flour recipe. It is definately a keeper.

This is amazing! I used white rice flour instead of brown rice flour. Only change after reading reviews. Made crepes and they were fluffy and delicious. Would definitely recommend this over pre-made gluten free all purpose flour.

My wife has a gluten sensitivity that has been getting worse lately. Iâ€™ve agreed to do a gluten free diet with her, but we have been struggling giving up certain things. I tried this recipe to make her favorite thing: Blueberry Pancakes. The pancakes came out fluffy and delicious and there was no way I could tell they were not made with wheat flour! I am really looking forward to trying to make my own bread with it. Fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This is the best gluten free flour recipe I have found to date.  GF flour tends to have a graininess to it--this recipe is much better.  I have used it in brownies, cakes, pumpkin & banana bread, etc.  I did end up doubling the xanthan gum after the pumpkin bread wasn't holding together well and it improved.
This recipe is SO much better than store-bought GF flour.  Thank you for sharing!

This is great. I make one bowl chocolate cake with it, and it turns out fantastic. Would never know it is gluten free.

This is the best substitute that I have found for wheat flour. I use it in EVERYTHING.
