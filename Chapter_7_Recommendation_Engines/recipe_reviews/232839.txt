These were great!  Next time I will thinly slice the pork vs. shredding it, I think it will make it a lot better!

Loved it! Used a pork roast, cooked in crock pot with Asian seasonings covered with liquid before shredding.  Cut ginger down to about 1 1/2 Tbsp.  Cooked cabbage and carrots with meat mixture.  Serving with sriracha really did great things for this dish.

Yummy.  This is so good!  I decided before starting the recipe that I wouldn't cook the pork in the oven, for a couple of reasons.  First, pork tenderloin is a premium cut and really doesn't require cooking in the oven, shredding, and simmering for twenty minutes to be tender.  Second, it's too darn hot to use the oven!  I did as reviewer Cabinluvn did:  cut the pork into strips.  Cooked until no longer pink, then proceeded with the recipe.  Ran out of hoisin so supplemented with bottled stir-fry sauce.  I also cut back a bit on the cornstarch; the ratio of cornstarch to liquid seemed a little high since the hoisin is already thick.  Used multigrain wraps.  We really enjoyed this and will likely have it often.  I feel that this is a healthy dish except for the sodium; not sure how to address that!  PS:  Used ground ginger; if I had used fresh, I would have cut it back.

What a great idea and easy way to make moo shu!  I probably wouldn't add the hoisin to the meat mixture, but rather spread it on the tortillas before adding the pork, etc.  Will have to try this soon.  I'll let you know how it works out for me.

Used thin cut pork chops that I sliced into thin strips and stir fried. Then added the green onions, ginger and garlic. Then added the sauce mix and simmered on low for 20 minutes. Will cut that to 15 minutes as the sauce cooled away. Didn't do the carrots and it was very good just the pork and cole slaw. Will gomintonmy favorites file

Great recipe!  Like others I sliced the pork instead of shredded it and I would recommend cooking the cabbage in the skillet with the meat. We also used fresh tortillas from a local tortillarilla and served it with plum sauce.  Yum!

Next time I want to use chicken ...  thinking of adding eggs too.  Hmmmm.  Wonder if it would be alright with spring roll wraps instead of tortillas.

Not a fan.  I would agree with the other reviews that thin sliced would be better than shredded.  It just turns mushy.  The cabbage was better in my opinion raw not cooked.  It also got mushy (I tried both ways).  I also thought that it was better not heating the tortillas.  Again, it just added to the mushiness.  The flavor wasn't terrible, but I will not make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used a little too much fresh ginger in mine and would reduce the amount next time. I also added the coleslaw mix to the meat mixture to partially cook it and that was a good move. I will definitely make this again!
