Quick & easy "throw together" meal.  3 adults in our house, and we all liked it.  I've made it a few times.  I get the canned chicken at our wholesale club (BJ's), but I'd bet Costco or Sam's Club probably has canned chicken.  The only change I made is adding a bit more milk, because the finished casserole tends to be a bit on the "dry" side.
