The recipe was very easy to follow and the results were a visual pleasure and spectacular taste. I opted to toast and add hazelnuts and decorate the top. I baked my cake in a 9 x 2“ chicken pot pie dish from Pottery Avenue. The cake lifted out so smoothly on top of my cake stand. I couldn’t have asked for anything more! I wasn’t sure what gram flour was so I put graham crackers in my food processor and used that And held back some of the brown sugar.
