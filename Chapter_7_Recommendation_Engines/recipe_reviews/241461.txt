I liked the idea of the pepper and onion stuffed meatloaf, but, we weren't crazy about this recipe.   The meat mixture was very loose and seemed to have too much liquid in it.  I had to add some additional crackers to help bind the mixture.   Once cooked, although the meat wasn't bad all I could taste was tomato and peppers.  There wasn't much other flavor and seemed very one note and bland.   I don't plan on making this again.

This turned out beautifully! I actually made a mistake and combined all the veggies with the meat mixture, but it still turned out fine. The meat mixture was a little loose, but the flavor was terrific! Great recipe!

The meat recipe was rather loose which confused me.  But the flavor and texture once cooked was fantastic!!  Have made it again and cannot wait until it is out of the oven.  My husband and I ate all of the leftovers.  Will make sure that I make it when the grandkids are over!  They will love it!!

This was a hit in our house.  Nex5 day leftovers was even more flavorful. Made extra to put in freezer for another night.

We love this recipe, this meatcake has so much flavor!  I didn't have any saltines so we used italian bread crumbs and it worked fine.
