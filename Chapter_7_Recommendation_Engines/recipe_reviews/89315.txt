kids loved it. i didn't see many adults eating them though. I used Nutella and ground hazelnuts. They looked pretty and were really easy to make.

These were very good and very easy to make.  I used granulated sugar instead of powdered for the top and it was just fine.  I will do these again for sure.

These turned out pretty good.  When you roll up the dough, chill the "log" well before slicing or else you will have a soggy dough mess (like my first batch!) especially if you are baking these on a hot summer day, like I did.  Also, instead of sprinkling the pastries with powdered sugar, I sprinkled them with the leftover chopped hazelnuts.  They turned out pretty yummy, although kind of expensive to make if you don't already have these ingredients on hand.  I would probably make these again, but save them for a special occasion.  They would look stunning on a Christmas cookie tray!

This was very bland. I had high hopes as I love puff pastry and Nutella. What a disappoint for our cookie exchange. Cookies lost their crispness after only one day. Will not make again ever!

These were okay the first day they were made, but by the second day they had turned hard and unappetizing. My son, who LOVES Nutella, didn't think much of them.

These were okay. I didn't add the icing sugar and only had walnuts.

Good for what they are - think PB on Toast. Don't think these are the sweet cin-sugar ones then be disappointed. Using Choc PB and diced Choc Chips will sweeten them up. Watch that over cooking does not happen.  May use any nut butter and may mix in Cocoa powder if want chocolate. Diced nuts would be tasty as well. Can make icing with milk afterwards for sweeter taste. As is this would be better for those that can not do so much sugar/carbs in the diet. It's an alternate splurge than the cin-sugar cousins.

Did not find this easy, the filo leaves kept ripping and then the cookies burned.  The second batch was in four minutes less and still burned on the bottom.

Loved this. You should make it in  a cool kitchen because the dough softens which makes it more difficult to spread. My 11 yr old still did pretty well with that task. Goes down like butter... We could eat 1/2 the batch at one sitting if we let ourselves.
