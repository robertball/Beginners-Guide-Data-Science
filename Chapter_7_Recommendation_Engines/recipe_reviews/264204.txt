So delicious, will definitely make many more times! Didn't have jalape√±o peppers so I added 2 tsp ground fresh chili paste. Also added about 2 Tbsp cream cheese to the mixture.

I liked it, and would make again. Who doesn't like the mix of salsa and sour cream?

This is an easy and delicious dinner.  I cut the chicken into pieces before putting it in the oven.  I topped with lettuce tomato, and avocado.  What a great keto (or not keto) meal!
