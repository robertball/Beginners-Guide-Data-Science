My slow cooker is large and I used 2 lbs of ground beef and added 1 large can of diced tomatoes, just cutting back on the tomato sauce.  I also do not have a low setting for 4 hours, but cooked it on high for 4 hours and it was fabulous.  What a fantastic way to top of spaghetti.

Ver nice and thick although I did add a bit more sugar, a chopped green pepper and basil and oregano. The family all liked it and I will definately make it again.

I used Italian herb tomato sauce instead of the plain puree. I also added about twice the amount of sugar required. While browning the meat I added the Italian seasoning to it as well as some fresh ground pepper, salt, and a little bit of cayenne. I added about 1/2 teapsoon of chili powder to the sauce as well. It turned out really well and it's great to freeze the leftovers for a quick meal another day.

Great recipe! Easy and fast. Everyone loved it at our dinner table. About the only thing I will do differently is to let the onions saute a little longer. Try this recipe. I think you'll really enjoy it! Thanks Jenn!

I made this twice and each time I tasted a "burnt" flavor. Not too sure any tomato sauce is meant for the slow cooker.

This is a flexible recipe, and a great way to make spaghetti sauce ahead of time to put in quart baggies to freeze.  Loved it.  Thanks

Recipe creator indicated they didn't know exact measurements for spices, so keeping that in mind, I doubled the amount of Italian seasoning, added more garlic, and also added some beef soup base.  Seemed to have a strong taste of the tomato paste, almost bitter.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. We're a small family so I halved it, doubled the garlic and the seasoning, added a couple of small hot sausages and threw a bay leaf into the slow-cooker for good measure; we had delicious leftovers for days

Hmmm, not sure about this one.  I had read that I should add dry herbs at the end of slow cooking so I waited til the end of cooking and the sauce was good, but on the bland side.  I made a triple batch and have since used the  sauce as a base for chili and baked spaghetti where I can add flavourings as needed.

This lacks the robust flavor of Italian sauces.  Tasted too much like sauce from a jar with beef added.  Definitely needs more spices.  It was very easy to make.

This was very good! I added some extra spices and some broccoli towards the end. This made a great dinner, and even good as left overs the next day. Thanks!

This was really awful.  There was no taste.  I had to add a lot more seasoning to even give it taste and that still wasn't enough.

I had company coming over for supper but I wasn't sure what time they would arrive. This sauce worked really well. I cooked it for 4 hours on low. When I put it all together I was a bit concerned that it tasted very tomatoey but after 4 hours it was delicious. I have some leftovers and they will go into the freezer. To make the meal easier I pre-cooked the spaghetti for about 3/4 the time needed and rinsed it in cold water. I kept the water simmering on the stove and kept adding water and then when my guests arrived I turned the pot back up to boil and put the mostly cooked spaghetti in the pot. It only took a couple of minutes to finish cooking and we were eating within a short time of their arrival. I would do this again if I needed a meal like this.

No need to use the slow-cooker.  I make this quick sauce on the range.  It is very good. Feel free to add additional spices such as oregano, basil, Italian seasoning.  I have used a pound of ground beef and a pound of  loose Italian sausage.  Makes a nice meat sauce.
