This was a quick and easy recipe but I recommend quite a few changes. I used 4 TBSP of vinegar, 1 TBSP of fresh rosemary, and only marinated for 5 minutes. The vinegar was still a bit overpowering, but I used the mushrooms to make a pizza. With the pizza sauce, the marinated mushrooms had just the right flavor.

I made it again and made changes so I guess it isnt the same at all.  I used white wine instead of the vinegar and added basil and garlic.

Don't marinate more than 30 minutes, because they'll get a bit too tart. Otherwise these were very good.

This is exactly how you can get them in a restaurant as an appetizer. Usually $10! Very easy to prepare on your own.

I marinated the mushrooms for 30 minutes and they were simply too tart for my family's taste.  Also, four tablespoons of dried rosemary was too much.  The mushrooms were covered in crunchy rosemary.  Overall this recipe was a disappointment.

Heres a twist on the same recipe. Instead of marinating the mushrooms, I grill the mushrooms plain and then reduce the balsamic and drizzle it over them. To get real fancy, I'll top with some blue cheese crumbles and serve with a few grilled shrimp as an appetizer. Kind of a play on Surf and Turf.

i used whole baby portabellas which worked just fine.  these were good, but not great.  maybe i had too high of an expectation.  i will try again and cut down on the vinegar and add some pineapple juice and garlic to add more depth to the marinade.

I didn't really care for this recipe - I found the balsamic vinegar overwhelming.  Sorry.

Too much dried rosemary.  like eating sticks.  should have been fresh, and definitely not 4 tablespoons.

what a waste of perfectly good portabellas.

4 tablespoons of rosemary has got to be a typo. 1 teaspoon is plenty. I also did not cut my mushrooms in 1/2 inch pieces because that would have made in nearly impossible to grill without losing them to the bottom. I mixed all the other ingredients together and then just poured it over the mushrooms and let them marinate that way. A bit tart yes but I enjoyed these very much.
