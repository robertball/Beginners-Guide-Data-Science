This was really good. I found using my little trio dumpling set worked great in making cute little turnover pies. They were tasty and easy to make. Will make these again. And what's really nice is that I can easily change out the flour and pie crust for a gluten free alternative for an inlaw that's going to be visiting! Yeah me.

Instead of "turnovers," I guess I made "baked apple pies," but shaping them differently was the only change.  The Splenda provided just enough sweetness.

These were so good. The crust was wonderful on them and I just used an affordable store brand crust. I used the apples, I had already, which I believe were gala apples. It took about eighteen minutes for my apples to cook down. I used a Norpro mini Apple mold to cut the shapes and help fill and seal them. So, I went with round pies. I got four and then pressed out the dough scraps and I got two more. I still used the 3 Tblsp. of filling in each. They were filled plenty. I was left with a good 1/2 cup, or a little more, of filling. It was no problem, because it is fine on its own like a thick apple sauce. I baked the pies on a parchment lined sheet, sprayed with Pam. They took twenty minutes to bake. I just wish pie crust, was a little more healthy because I want to keep eating more. ty

I'm not a big cooked fruit lover.  After accidentally pulverizing my apples (and, incidentally, making applesauce), I REALLY loved this recipe.  My only recommendation is to really make sure you cool down that filling.  If you put it onto the pie crust warm, you'll have a lot of difficulty putting it onto a cookie sheet.  Roll out the crust, position it where you want it on the cookie sheet, THEN fill it.  Otherwise, you could end up with a mess.  I rolled it out on parchment paper and transferred the turnovers that way.  This is really worth trying!

These were near perfect. I did bump up the cinnamon to a tsp. These would be even better with homemade crust...

Made with 3 Gala apples and a cup of blueberries. Also used real sugar. Brushed the tops with a beaten whole egg and sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar! Excellent. 
For the crust, I used the recipe here: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/fried-pie-pastry/detail.aspx

These turned out really good. I used 1/8 cup sugar instead of splenda. I also drizzled some icing on top.

I am highly pleased with my eight turnovers.  I am sure that the recipe as is would have been wonderful, but I read the reviews and decided to change it up a bit.  First, I bought Pink Lady apples at the local farmer's market, a recommended alternative to Granny Smiths.  Second, I increased the cinnamon to 3/8 tsp and sprinkled just the slightest dash of pumpkin pie spice on it to get just a whiff of nutmeg and allspice, etc., without overpowering the mixture.  Third, I used my own favorite crust, which is a marvelous cream cheese pâte sucré to which I add just a bit of baking powder to make it fluffier.  That crust takes an optional tbs of lemon zest.  I took about an equivalent amount of zest that I had left (I zested one whole large lemon) and added that to the apple mixture as well.  The result was fabulous.  I took a small bowl with a nice rounded rim--about  4.5" in diameter, and used that  to cut circles in the dough.  A circle is quite easy to fold over whereas a triangle doesn't work as neatly, at least for me.  Thanks to the cook who recommended filling the pastry with the dough already in the pan, I followed that advice, folded the circle over and crimped it with a fork.  Learning:  next time I will apply the egg wash (I used a whole egg with a tbs of water which makes a shiny wash) by lifting up the turnover with a large flat spatula so that the egg wash doesn't drip onto the pan and collect around the edges of the turnover(s).  Not a big issue, but it tends to br

These were delicious. I only had Cortland apples & did not have Splenda. So I used the Cortland's sprinkled with 1/8 c. white sugar. Absolutely delicious. Had about 1/2 c. extra filling.

I had a difficult time rolling a 1/4 pie crust into a circle.  I also think adding some sugar to the outside might make it tastier.

Overall, taste level was as good as I expected.

I will try this recipe again BUT I think next time I won't cook the apples in advance, or will cook them less.  They were a bit too mushy for my taste.  I used Granny Smith.  Other than the texture, the taste was great - I appreciate the fact that this is a recipe that uses Splenda instead of sugar.  Really nice.
