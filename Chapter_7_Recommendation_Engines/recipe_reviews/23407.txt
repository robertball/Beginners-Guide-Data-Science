More like a mini-biscuit rather than a scone, but yummy none the less. I used all-purpose flour rather than self-rising, so I added 3 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of sea salt (for 2 cups of flour). So easy and so quick.

Karla, great recipe! Thanks for sharing. I've made these several times and they always turn out light and fluffy. Tonight I made them with 2T finely minced chives, 1t garlic powder and 3T asiago cheese (along with the Parmesan you suggest). Yummy! This is a keeper!

Very easy to prepare.  Definitely reminded me of fast food chains' breakfast biscuits.  I didn't have self-rising flour on hand, so I did the trick of adding 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt per cup of all purpose flour.  Ended up a little too salty, but still very good.

Wow!!!! These are darn good, they're great! It's such a simple recipe that I actually doubted it at first, but they are sooooo yummy and cheesey. I added more parmesan and some romano as well. These can also become herb cheese scones too. More people need to discover these!!!! Hello people????????

Use the same recipe but a little less liquid and make drop scones (like the previous reviewer also) – it’s less work.  Self-rising flour was not on my shelf so I looked in a cookbook for another scone recipe – it required 2t. baking powder so that is what I used before looking at the previous reviews on this recipe. When I bake these again I’ll use 3t. baking powder and more parmesan.  Sprinkling a bit of the cheese on top sounds like a good idea too. We thought the salt was just right but I used kosher salt and quality parmesan - don't know if that made the
difference.

These ARE good. So cheesey and gooey. I added more cheese cause i'm an addict. They came out perfect and smelled so good while baking. I have never made a bread/scone recipe before and I'm so happy my first came out this great. Thank you Karla

Easy and Yummy. Only change is to put more grated parmesan on top, and dab a little bit of milk to make the scone look golden. Takes a bit longer than stated as well, about 15 minutes.

These were excellent, and reminded me more of biscuits than the scones that I have had in the past.  Next time I might add a little more Parmesan cheese because I don't think I could taste it that much.

Definitely more like biscuits than scones, but who's complaining?  Yes, these would be way too salty if you added the salt called for bc the recipe calls for self rising flour, which already has salt in it.  I, too, don't have self rising flour and just used 3 tsps baking powder and 1 tsp salt to adjust (1 cup of self rising flour has 1 1 1/2 tsps baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt).  I sprinkled a little bit of cayenne into the dough itself instead of sprinkling onto each biscuit.  I didn't put in the salt called for in the recipe, and instead of cutting into biscuits (I am lazy), I just made drop scones with my small cookie scoop.  they don't spread much so you can put a lot onto one cookie sheet.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was also my first time making scones.  I was delighted with how simple it was.  Doubly delighted that they tasted so good.  My only problem was that I wanted to eat them all myself.
Love them thanks Karla.

These were pretty good. Like other reviewers, I also added more parm and sprinkled some on top too. I was hoping for a fluffier version, but we really did enjoy these Karla.

WOW! LOVED these! I am all about quick and easy recipes, so instead of rolling them out and cutting them into rounds (which ends up taking a whole lot of time), I just scooped the dough into a mini muffin pan and it easily makes 24. The cayenne pepper sprinkled on top is amazing. Parmesan scones with a bite. Awesome!

These would have been good biscuits, except they were way WAY too salty. I would suggest cutting the salt down to a 1/2 tsp.

Great recipe - thanks so much to pomplemousse for the substitution on self-rising flour!  Worked perfectly.  I added in herbes-de-provences (which has a lot of rosemary), oregano, garlic salt, garlic powder, and extra parmesan. I used chili flakes for colour instead of cayenne (which would blend in more).  Basically this is a great recipe, to which you can add any herb or seasoning you prefer - the recipe itself is totally sound.   I flipped them over after 14 minutes and did another 2 or 3 to brown the tops (personal preference).

I made these scones for a work potluck.  I was afraid nobody would eat them with all the cookies and brownies to choose from but every single one was gone by the end of the party, and there were still lots of cookies left.  I used four cheeses: parmesan, romano, grana padana, and mahon.  I subbed buttermilk for the milk for a tangier taste and more tender crumb and added a little extra to make drops instead of rolling and cutting.  To bake, I melted a pat of butter in the pan, grated some cheese over it, dropped the scones in, and grated more cheese over that. I topped with paprika because I didn't have cayenne.  I made this recipe because I had a bag of self-rising flour and no idea what to do with it.  Those who found it too salty might check your flour--mine had salt already added so I didn't use more in the recipe.

This was a nice modification of the standard baking powder biscuit.  Since I didn't have a 1/2 cup of parmesan, I ended up using 1/4 cup parm and 1/4 cup mozzarella.  Also, I omitted the salt entirely.  This one's going in my recipe box.

Like other reviewers said this recipe is more of biscuit than scone. First time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. It was good but lacked some flavor. Second time around, I added some pesto (I just had some leftover pesto in the fridge). It turned out flavorful and delicious. Btw, I didn't want to bother cutting the dough into small pieces, so I used muffin pan.

Loved these! I added a cube of frozen minced  garlic (from Trader Joes) to the butter as I melted it, which gave a nice garlick-y twang. And I added about a tbsp each of dried basil and oregano (I'm not a measure-er, I just eyeball it) to the flour mixture. Also I added about 50% more cheese.  The result is yummy!!..............Plus, I was surprised that the oven temp was so low.  Traditional biscuit (face it, scone is just a fancy word for biscuit) recipes call for an oven temp of 425. So I baked my last pan at 400 and loved how crispy these were on the outside.  Obviously I had to bake them for a shorter period of time............Thanks for such a great base recipe.  I really needed this type of appetizer for a book group meeting.................PS-this kind of recipe would be awesome made as a pull-apart: roll the dough into large marble sized balls, roll in garlic butter then parmesan and pile them in a bundt/tube pan. Pour over the extra butter and parmesan and bake till done. My mouth is watering just thinnking about that!

These were incredibly salty, and the dough was so sticky I ended up having to add another full 1/4 cup of flour to it. It was nearly inedible it was so salty. The texture was fine, but if I ever tried to make it again I'd cut down on the amount of water, and cut WAY down on the amount of salt.

It was delicious, even my fussy hubby finds so too. However, I find that it's too salty.. should have read the reviews/pitfalls before baking.. will do it again but probably not add any salt at all! Used 1 cup of self-raising flour and 1 cup of multi-grain flour, and changed the milk to 'skim milk'. For those following ww, I've calculated the points using mastercook.. it should be 2 pts per scone (with skim milk). Pl correct me if I'm wrong.. :p

This was really good except for one thing.  It was very salty.  Well, I confess, I did use Kraft grated Parmesan cheese and I used a little more than 1/2 cup but I also cut down on the salt to one teaspoon.  I didn't have self rising flour so I used 3 teaspoons of baking powder.  It is delicious, light and fluffy but just 1/2 teaspoon would have been fine for me.

These scones are really very good but I found them to be much too salty. The parmesan itself is salty and with 1-1/2tsp added was too much. I will definitely make them again but with only 1/2 tsp salt.

These were soo good! I'm not sure what texture I was expecting, but these tasted like biscuits to me. Either way, they were outstanding.  They make a ton, though, and I might halve the recipe next time. Will definitely make again.

This wasn't a very tastey addition to our dinner. While the biscuit did puff up, it tasted very baking powdery, and the cheese didn't mesh well with the cayenne pepper or the biscuit style. Can't imagine how to make this better.

The salt measurement in this recipe is way too high!  These scones would have been great but they were too salty. If you make these, cut down on the salt.  They turned out light and fluffy, but nobody could eat them because the salt was too much; I used exactly what the recipe called for.

I omitted the cayenne pepper.  Instead, I added 1 T Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the dough to make delicious Prmesan Herb Scones!  Very good!

I think my scones were just OK. Nothing fantastic or extraordinary. There was just a hint of cheese flavour and they weren't that fluffy either. Maybe my self-rising flour wasn't strong enough. Anyway I'll give it a second shot.

These turned out pretty well, although not as fluffy as I expected. I didn't knead the dough, just dropped them, so that may be why. I'm definitely keeping in this one in my recipe box.

This was my first attempt at making scones and I was very pleased with them. I was trying to find a lower-fat version of cheese scones and this seemed to be the one. - I knocked back the parmesan to 1/4 cup, used only a pinch of salt and the second time used 200ml of reduced fat milk and 200ml water to get the dough abit less runny. I made drop scones and mixed half the cheese into the mixture and sprinkled the rest on the tops which was lovely - I think it brought more cheese flavour out since I didn't use all that much in the first place. I LOVED the cayenne pepper 'bite' to these and have made them 4 times now, great for morning tea thanks!

This scone is too salty and it tastes like very salty bread than scone. Will look for more fluffy scone recipes.

I found that if I just barely mix the wet and dry and then without kneading just plop lg spoonfuls onto baking tray they come out much "fluffier" not to mention funky organic shapes! we love these.

Tasty, but a little tough, maybe using no High -gluten flour next time will help. They froze well, and popping one in the toaster oven with dinner is a great convenience.

I made these and added some chopped fresh chives, garlic powder, extra parmesan cheese and some grated Asiago cheese.  I also brushed them with milk before baking and sprinkled a little grated asiago and chives on them.  I still found them to be kind of boring and blah.  Probably wouldn't make them again.

Awesome! I used an empty 6oz tomato paste can to cut out the biscuits (these aren't really scones).  They came out perfect.  You can substitute the cheese for nearly any add-in, i.e. dried fruit, nuts, cinnamon and raisins, etc.  It's a great "base" biscuit!!  Thanks very much for the recipe!

Made a batch of these in parmesan, and a batch in cheddar & garlic for variety. I noticed the absence of salt and added a pinch. I also added an 1/2 c egg and sourcream blend instead of 1/2 c water. (Ok, so I substituted alot.) These turned out great, tho. I liked them alot. Next time I make a batch of parmesan I will devinately add an herb. my hubby said they were the best biscuits he's ever had.(Oh well.) 
I will make them again and again. I grated the butter in to mix easier.

I added garlic and onion powder to the flour mixture and they were still kind of bland.  They are very doughy for scones as well...I doubt I will make these again.

I just made these scones and they're pretty good.  Had some leftover ham so I chopped about 1/2 cup and added it right before kneading, also cut back on salt since ham is salty.  I've also made scones where you just knead the pile of dough into a large circle and score it into 6 triangles. So that's what I did wth these and they turned out good.  Great for lunch!

These were just a little weird for my liking. Everyone else that I fed them to seemed to enjoy them, but I didn't. I don't know what it was, but I won't be making them again.

These were really yummy - I added more Parmesan though as I thought the first batch was a little plain.

Like other viewers suggested, I added extra parmesan cheese; in fact, I almost doubled the amount called for in the recipe. These were very moist and good, however, mine turned out kind of doughy and tasting a little flour-like. Perhaps I cut mine too large for the cooking time specified (I didn't have a cookie/biscuit cutter, so I used the mouth of a drinking glass.) The cayenne sprinkled on top added a nice, lasting kick.
