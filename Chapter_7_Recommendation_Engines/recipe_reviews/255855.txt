I made this as my first vegan dish using Tofu. It came out great, and I could barely taste the Tofu, which had me wondering what the fuss was about with Tofu! I am wondering of a way to make it so the dish maintains consistency, as the ingredients kept sliding off the noodles! Otherwise it was very flavorful and noodles were super tender (I did pre-boil mine for about 5 minutes before baking though). We rated this a "keeper"so I will make it again for sure.

This was delicious. The pasta was cooked to perfection and I didn't add any water as the sauce was enough.
