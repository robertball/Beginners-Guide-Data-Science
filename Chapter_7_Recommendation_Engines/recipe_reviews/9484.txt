This would have been wonderful if I had made it for a romantic breakfast or brunch but as she said it was served with turkey, I made it with Thansgiving dinner.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  It was very out of place with the rest of the holiday dinner.  I have to say, it was quite tasty and I'll keep the recipe.  However, next time I'll serve it for a special breakfast in bed with fresh OJ and wheat toast.

After 19 years of hosting my family's Christmas dinner and trying 19 different stuffing recipes that were awful, I served this stuffing and everyone LOVED it - it is outstanding.

Wow!  This was so easy to throw together for a quick main dish dinner, and it tasted like a stromboli or calzone (without all the time and work).  I used ham instead of proscuitto and added some provel in with the mozzarella. My husband said I could make it again, and my 3 year old said, 'I love the food you made, Mom'.  Thanks!

I used this for my potluck debut in my very judgmental family's thanksgiving.  It earned me a place among the great aunts, and has been asked for twice since.

This recipe is awesome! I've made it 2 times in the past week. I left out the prosiutto and only used 6 eggs...The first time I made it I used 4 eggs. This reminds me of a stromboli. I gave it 4 stars because of its texture....Not so fluffy but I will experiment with it and see if I can get it to be more fluffy. Will be something I make a lot of regardless.

AMAZING! I had 40 people last Thanksgiving and all thought this recipe was incredible! Thank you to the cook who submitted it! What an amazing treat. Everyone thought this was going to very salty however, it was not!

This is a very unique stuffing recipe and it has become a holiday tradition for our household.  I usually improvise on the ingredients since I don't always have prosciutto, pepperoni or salami.   In the past I have used ham, turkey bacon, onions, and green peppers.  Each time I make it, it turns out great.

This was incredible.  I prepared this the night before my Christmas Eve meal.  I used a loaf of Italian bread, cubed.  Instead of water, I poured 1 can of chicken broth over to moisten the cubes. I did not use prosciutto, but Canadian bacon, instead.  I chopped and seeded a large, ripe tomato and sliced 6 green onions into the mix. (I had to use them up.) Put all into a sprayed casserole dish and refrigerated overnight.  My gosh, you should have heard the family, asking where in the world did this recipe come from?  It is now going to be prepared all year long.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I'm not a big stuffing eater but this recipe caught my eye because of the salami. I made this for our Christmas dinner and was highly pleased! A definite change from the normal stuffing, a change which was very welcomed! I will definitely keep this recipe in my recipe box and use it again!

My husband's grandmother used to make this stuffing for the holidays. My mother-in-laws version was awful. I mean it takes effort to make something that bad. I made this recipe (to a T) which is "just like Grandma's" and my mother-in-law is so ticked off. I don't think she was a fan of her mother-in-law. ;) I'll be a holiday hero! Thanks!

This is definately more of a side dish than a stuffing but having said that I did cook it in a casserole dish and I will be making it again for Xmas day 2008. It was delicious and it will be made alot.

i baked this separately in a casserole dish as was suggested by others and everybody loved it. Very filling and rich, almost tastes like pizza, will definitely make it again.

Only after cooking this stuffing in the Thanksgiving turkey did my husband tell me he does not like stuffing cooked inside the bird.  Regardless, this was very tasty.  I am not a big fan of onions, and almost every stuffing recipe has onions in it, I was very glad to find this one.

This is really wonderful...and really easy to make! I was skeptical when I put it in the oven, but it turned out just fantastic! It was devoured almost instantaneously! My only problem was that it was way a bit too salty, so just be careful that your salami and prosciutto aren't too salty!

I have been making this every Thanksgiving and Christmas for years.  It’s everyone’s favorite no matter who I make it for.  I use Martin’s cubed potato bread and pretty much double all the meats and cheese.  If you buy the meats from the deli (especially the prosciutto) and have them slice it super thick, it’ll make it easier to cube later.

I didn't like this at all. I guess I had my hopes too high that it would taste like the stuffing the lil italian guy used to make with all the italian meats. 2 stars because my mom really liked it, however; my bf and teenagers did not

Thank-you Grandpa!  I've used this recipe every Christmas since 2003 and it ALWAYS goes down well with my extended family.  It is like a main course in itself though so I do reduce the meat content.  Jonny, London, England

Love this Stuffing. Want to make it all through out the year but prefer to save it as a special treat for Xmas dinner. Bake it as is the day before in a casserole dish and reheat it on Xmas day. Can't wait.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and the reviews were GREAT!  I baked it outside of the turkey, and it was a bit "fluffier" that way.  Excellent find!

This was absolutely fantastic. I made it for our familys christmas brunch. Although it sits very heavy in your tummy, you cant seem to get enough. Some even liked it a bit cold.

I have made this on many occasion for several years. I change up the breads and I soak them too . Fresh cheese too. It is always a hit . I do make traditional stuffing for the boring people :-) !

This was very good. I will make it for my next pot luck.  I might add some green peppers and possibly  onion.  Someone  said it tastes  like stromboli, AND THEY ARE CORRECT.

The meats were a overpowering. Must have done something wrong. Very salty, not a big hit.
