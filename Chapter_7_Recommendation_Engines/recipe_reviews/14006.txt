After reading all of the reviews, I was expecting an incredible veggie dish, unfortunately it was just ok.  It has a lot of potential to be great, but it needs more spices and lots and lots of cheese.  Also, mine was very watery and I think the can of tomatoes has to be drained.  I added double the amount of parmesan she called for, but I felt that I needed more.  Whenever I got a little bite of that cheese, it was yummie.  Next time I will layer in the cheese to the whole mix.

I honestly can't rate this based on my tastes because I didn't even get a bite! This dish was a big hit; hence the reason I'm giving it five stars. I made this as a side for my sis-in-laws "moving down to N.C." dinner party. I took BHERNAN'S advice and cooked it on top of the stove, only because I didn't have any more room in the oven. The only thing I did differently was adding, (I know, I'm boring) garlic and onion powders, a bit of cayenne and cooked it al dente, as opposed to a softer texture. Even the non vegie eaters went nuts over this. Thanks AnneBelle!

The vegetable medley was absolutely wonderful.  I included red, yellow, and orange peppers as well as a few slices of red onions. The presentation of the dish was pretty, and very tasty.  I placed mozzarella cheese on one side of the dish, and Parmesan cheese on the other side, and it was great.  The dish had a great taste.  My daughter, who is not a vegetable eater, enjoyed the dish very much.  I will place this in my recipe repertoire, and will make it many more times to come.

WAIT...Before I give this recipe the praise. You have to notice it doesn't say what to do with the Green Peppers and Garlic!! Saute the peppers with the rest of the veggies then add garlic a few minutes later. Thats my instruction. I give it 5 stars because it rocks...Good Job.

Great recipe!!  I cooked it on the stove instead of the oven and also used mozzarella instead of parmesan. My fiance couldn't stop eating it until it was gone!

This is now my new summer favorite!  It was yummy before the parm was added, but the parm really brought all the flavors together.  DELICIOUS!

Was good. I added mushrooms and I think I would have liked it better with some butter added and mozzarella cheese along with the parmesan. I think I'll stick with my very plain way of sauteing my squash and zucchini with just some oil, butter, garlic, salt and pepper.

This was a great way to use up my ever growing supply of zucchini! It smells wonderful when cooking, too. I highly recommend trying this recipe.

Since I love zucchini cooked Italian style, with olive oil, garlic, onion and tomatoes, I thought I'd like this variation as well. But I really wasn't crazy about it.  I couldn't see sticking this in the oven once it was already cooked, so I didn't.  You run the risk of turning it to mush.  I used fresh oregano and basil and found it distracting with the mildly flavored zucchini.  I found the same with the bell peppers as well. I found it all overbearing. Since tomatoes are in season now, I used fresh, which is a good choice when they're available. But the flavors just didn't come together for me.

Always looking for ways to get the family to eat more fresh vegies.  Salads can get tiring after awhile.  This is a great addition.  The vegies can be varied although some, like broccoil, can be a bit overpowering.  Better with fresh basil.  For some reviewers who feel the need to add more cheese, if you learn to use less, like this recipe does, you will find your waistlines shrinking. Eventually more cheese will seem like too much.  A strong cheese like parmesan doesn't need great quantities.

Have been making this (or very similar) for years.   Even those who do not care for zucchini gobble it up.   I do add some hot pepper flakes and sometimes, before serving, top it with crumbled feta cheese.

I've been making this dish at least once a week for about 3 weeks! I play with it a bit, adding extra squash and zucchini, adding orange and yellow peppers, extra garlic and extra basil, and sprinkle mozzarella blend cheese on top before baking. It tastes great and is helping me lose weight!

My whole family loved this recipe.  It tastes like summer- fresh and warm. I added some herbs from our small community garden plot- thyme and basil- and it was perfect.  I will definitely make it again- even my tomato hater thought it was delicious!

This is the dish that everyone always makes me bring to gatherings. It is so good, even people who rarely eat veggies will rave. Serve it with a risotto, such as asparagus risotto, for a wonderfully filling vegetarian meal (even if you're not a vegetarian -- I'm not). The leftovers can be thrown together and it tastes even better the next day, and can be used as a side dish with roasted chicken or some such. Fabulous, versatile dish.

This was good.  I could definitely see why other reviewers said that it was a little mushy. I drained my vegetables before I baked them and then again before I added the cheese. I also added italian seasonings in addition to the oregano that it called for.

Very good!  I drained the tomatoes and only used about 1/4 of the can.  I skipped the baking part, too.  My wife and I enjoyed it.

I made it a second time and used the veggies as a filling, added slices of swiss cheese, and made a grilled sandwich out of it.  Absolutely yummy!  Thanks, AnneBelle!

This is so tasty! It was a bit on the juicy side, though, and I'll follow the advice of other reviewers and drain the tomatoes before adding next time. Good stuff!!!

This was delicious. It made for a scrumptious bbq side dish and brought a nice change of texture from the steak and bbq chicken.  MONEY SAVER TIP:  Use 2 T of McCormick italian seasoning in lieu of the basil/oregano.  More cost effective than buying individual spices.

Very good!  Followed the recipe almost exactly.  I didn't have green bells, so I used a red bell pepper.  I also only had a can of tomatoes with green chilies, so I used that instead of the diced canned tomatoes.  It really gave it an extra kick!

I served it with brown rice cooked in chicken stock, with onions and celery added.  The family went back for seconds and thirds!  I only ate the veggies and rice.  Hubs had his with a steak.  Our dd had chicken.  Excellent recipe, and will make again.  What a great way to use up all those summer time veggies!  Thank you.

Not bad!  I just did a couple of modifications and came out with an awesome vegie dish.  (1) I read the other reviews and added much more in the way of herbs.  I much more prefer fresh than dried, but sometimes the garden doesn't give over.  I did use fresh oregano, which gave it a really nice flavor.  I never use salt and pepper but it wasn't necessary, because canned tomatoes generally are high in sodium.  (2) I really like my vegies crisp.  With that in mind, I sauteed the onions and peppers first and added the squash later.  I did not sautee as long as the recipe called for.  (3) My can of diced tomatoes was only 14.5 ounces.  (4) I served it over rice.  I didn't feel that it came out "soupy" at all, but was happy for some liquid at the bottom for my rice.  Hubby was happy, I was happy, and I've found a new way to use yellow squash and zucchini!

First of all, the picture does not do this dish justice!!  It is excellent!  I only changed it a little bit.  
Instead of 1/2 tsp of basil, I used 1 tsp.;
Red bell pepper instead of green;
Did not use salt;
Drained the tomatoes (basil, garlic & oregano flavored);
Mixed in the parmesan before baking;
Baked for 10 mins.;
Added 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella to the top and baked for an additional 10 minutes.

This would make a great filling for vegetable lasagna!!!!

I really loved this recipe!! I omitted the green pepper(personal preference),used extra parmesan mixed throughout and italian seasoned diced tomatoes for simplicity.  This is definitely a keeper! Mmmmmmmmmm!!!

Great recipe. Went very well with the rosemary and balsamic vinegar chicken breasts I had made. I used fresh minced garlic (from a jar) instead of crushed. Also, I used red onion and added asparagus as well as mushrooms. Also, used more Parmesan. Overall very tasty even though there was some mushiness. Will make again.

Tasted exactly like ratatoullie (sp?) without the eggplant.  Vegetables and Italian seasonings.  Nothing particularly special.  I liked it; no one else in the family really did.  I used all fresh garden vegetables and spent a lot of time chopping, so I was disappointed when the kids wouldn't eat it at all.  Most of the flavor comes from the Parmesan cheese, which I added before baking.  Probably won't make again--too much prep time for not great results from my not-usually-picky family!

I did not do this in the oven.  I added a pkg.
of long grain and wild rice with herbs (pre-cooked), pureed the can of diced tomatoes with the basil and oregano, and omitted the cheese and cooked in a nonstick skillet. This was even better as leftovers.

This was a great recipe. I did make a few changes. I added 1 tsp basil and 1 1/2 tsp oregano (I love basil) and used minced garlic because that's what I had on hand. I also added mushrooms. When it was all done, I added the veggie dish to some orzo nd it was a DELICIOUS whole meal.

This is a good recipe, except the veggies got real watery the next day.  It's fine if you're not planning on eating it as leftovers though.

My family has made this recipe(or close to it) for 40 years....I have made a 2nd version for the last 20 years by adding chili powder and cayenne pepper and cheddar cheese grated at the end as topping...which gives a Mexican flavor.

This was a very good recipe...actually my first using summer squash. I halved the amount of oregano and that was still plenty for us. Even my picky husband tried it and went back for a second helping. Thanks, we will make this often.

This was wonderful! I made this according to the recipe but I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of 16 oz and I did not have the watery problem some have experienced. I served this with Rice-a-roni on the side but it would have gone well over pasta since it makes enough sauce without being watery.
Both of my children cleaned their plates and had seconds. My husband prefers to have some kind of meat for dinner, and even he said he could eat 10 plates of that. I will be making this again and again. Thank you for a healthy and satisfying recipe.

I'm not sure what the point of baking after sauteing was- the consistency did not seem to change much. I will just use the first part of this recipe to get the blend of herb and vegetable flavors. I agree with the other reviewers that adding the tomatoes gave too much water.
This froze well and tasted great after reheating.

My one-year-old, who is a very picky eater, had thirds when I served this!  Also, I microwaved it for 10 minutes instead of baking, sprinkling parmesan on half way thru microwaving.  Then I grated Mozzerella cheese over it.

This dish was so quick, easy, and my family enjoyed every bite until it was all gone. I made it all on the stove instead of sticking it in the oven, what i did was sautee squash and zuchini along with chopped onion in 1 T. butter. I than added a half chopped tomatoe seasoned with basil and oregano and added it to the veggies when it was done i added alot of parmesan w/ romano. yummmmmy

Not sure if this was supposed to happen, but the veggies were baked almost dry after 12 mins. I ended up chiselling them off the dish. Very disappointing. My advice is to omit the baking stage.

This was really a nice addition to dinner, it did seem like it needed a little tang from something but I couldn't put my finger on it. Still definately a new fave. I added the spices before the tomatos, and next time I think I will use fresh spices.

Good versatile veggie dish.  I let veggies simmer in their own juices for about 20 minutes instead of sauteeing them.  And I cooked them all at once instead of adding tomatoes later.  Also used rosemary & thyme instead of basil & oregano and Bistro Blend Mozzarella instead of parmesan.

Made this the other night for hubby and 2 teens.  One teen didn't care for it, but other did. It was very easy to prepare and very good.  I used stewed tomatoes instead of diced and added a can and a half.  Tasted great, and better the second night.  Might add ff onions next time. Good SB recipe.

My family loves this!  I made a couple of changes to it though.  First, I added cubed eggplant.  I placed the eggplant, zucchini, and squash in a bowl with a liberal amount of salt and allowed to sit for several hours, draining the liquid every so often.  Then I rinsed the excess salt off and drained before adding to the pan of oil.  I also drained most of the juice out of the can of tomatoes.  I found out after making it the first time that it can be a bit watery.  And of course, added extra cheese!

I am giving this four stars because even though it was good I had to make changes.  Instead of using parmesan cheese I used mozzerella which was much better.  I also used italian seasoning instead of the basil and oregano. I also had to drain the mixture before I put it in the oven and again after I took it out.  If you like your veggies a little crunchy do not cook to long on the stove. I will be making this again with my changes.

This is similar to a ratatouille (especially if you added some eggplant).  I used 1/4 tsp. oregano due to family preferences & substituted a red pepper for the green, as I had it in the house.  I saw no point in adding the parmesan only at the end so I sprinkled it on at the beginning of the baking period. I actually like it when parmesan bakes even longer on dishes & becomes a bit crispy. If you wanted to speed this up, you could microwave the vegetables just for a little while 1st, drain them, & then bake the dish at a higher temperature.

This is a great dish that is quick and easy to fix. Here are my suggestions to improve this already delicious dish.  After cooking down, the squash releases some of its juices.  To cut down on the liquid, I drained the jusice prior to adding the tomatoes.  Also, with the variety of tomatoe products available, I used a mix of Italian & jalapeno diced tomatoes. This recipe is a keeper!

I've been coming to this site forever, but have never reviewed anything. I'm a beginner cook (still in college), but I thought this vegetable medley was fabulous. I made the whole thing and it only took three people to finish it off! Thanks so much.

This was great, I didn't have any onion and I added a mushrooms couple of potatoes (sauteed a bit longer than the other vegetables). Very versatile recipe. Thanks.

Great vegetable dish!  I cut back on the yellow squash to one and added broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus and spinach.  Just warm them up with the rest of the vegetables.  Drain the liquid before adding the tomatoes.  Top with mozzarella and parmesan.  Delicious.

This was pretty good! I roasted the veggies in a roasting pan for about 30 min, then added tomatoes and roasted until the liquid was absorbed, then I put on the cheese until melted.  I didn't have parmesan, so I used cheddar, probably about a cup. Will make again!

this was a nice, light, simple dish.. nothing out of the ordinary.. but i was looking for something that would help clean out the veggie drawer in my fridge before i restocked.. i made very minor alterations.. used all zuchinni, half the bell pepper, doubled the garlic, and subbed fresh roma tomatoes that i chopped up for the canned.. i also added some already cooked shrimp to make it more of a meal for a light lunch.. im sure this would go well with pasta if i used the canned tomatoes with liquid.. ty for the recipe

Yum!  Simple to make on the stove top - I just put it under the broiler to melt the parmesan.  I didn't have any tomatoes so I used a bit of spaghetti sauce to pull it all together, which worked great.  Also added mushrooms.

I made this for supper and it was just okay but since I had lots left over, I reheated it for lunch the next day and it was GREAT!  I added fresh corn cut from the cob because I had extra. It's 5 stars if made a day ahead to allow the flavors to meld. I'm making more now to toss in the freezer.

I'm not a veggie lover, but this is great... well, I did use Rotel because I didn't have any diced tomatoes and I added a crumb topping (crushed saltines and parmesan).  Even if I made it by the recipe I would add Frank's Hot Sauce because I put that on everything.

We enjoyed this very much.  We used squash and zucchini right out of our garden and instead of dried basil we used fresh (also from the garden).  We used the canned tomatoes but think we'll try it with fresh tomatoes from the garden once they start coming in. Rather than heat up our kitchen, we used the microwave.  Will definitely make this again.  Totally delicious.

I personally don't like green peppers very much, so next time, I think I'll add mushrooms instead. I topped mine with 1 1/2 cups of fat-free mozzarella and it was delicious. My kids still wouldn't eat it because it looked "yucky". LOL

Needs a lot more herbs. But turned out great! I used olive oil spray, a little on the pan and some directly on the veggies. I added 1 tsp tarragon, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 3 bay leaves, 1 tsp cilantro, 1/2 cup moz cheese, 1/2 cup chopped asparagus, 2 tsp (chili paste from the publix produce section so good). I drained the tomoatoes and cooked it all stovetop. Great healthy side dish!

As written, this recipe is just ok. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. 30 minutes in the oven is definitely too long--after 20, I took it out and put it back in the pan for just a few minutes to add the parmesan. The taste was good, but it was far too mushy and watery. I thought it would be better over pasta, so I tried it again, using the same ingredients, only left it in the oven for about 12 minutes, again returned it to the pan to add parmesan and to reduce it a little. Then I tossed it with some bowtie pasta, and I thought it was definitely much better this way.

I love this recipe! I make it at least once a week all through the year. It's best during the summer season. The only difference is that I use red peppers opposed to green and fresh basil and parsley along with the oregano and I usually do it in a big saute pan. Too hot in the summer for the oven.

Mmmmmmm, good. I'm dieting and I made this as a main dish, doubling the recipe for larger portions. Still low enough ihn calories for my diet and filling enough to hold me over til the next meal.

Thanks for the recipe.

Seemed a little bland - I added more bell peppers and used fresh tomatoes. It still came out a little watery so if you use canned tomatoes, be sure to drain it. I also added mozzerela to the parmesan. Good stuff!

This was excellent! I didn't have a bell pepper but I added some mushrooms to the sauteed veggies - it was a natural fit. I also added more basil (about a teaspoon) and some garlic salt. It was the perfect recipe for using up that summer squash.

Excellent!  I made this recipe, as is, for a bridal shower.  It was the dish that everyone requested more of!

For veggies, this is really good. I recommend using the larger size diced tomatoes (not petite) & draining them. I also didn't bother baking- just simmered after adding cheese. Summer's almost over- so enjoy now!!!

This has become a family favorite.  My husband loves it, and asked that I even serve it with Father's Day dinner.

A little too much onion for us.  Will try it again with about 1/2 as much.

Looked very nice, very colorful!  It was also easy to make and I didn't change the recipe at all, except cutting it in half.  I will make this again!
