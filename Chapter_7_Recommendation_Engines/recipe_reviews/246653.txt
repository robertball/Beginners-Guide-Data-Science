The sauce was very runny. And you'd better love Gorgonzola cheese. In all fairness, I had 2 extra ounces of Gorgonzola cheese that I needed to use before it went off so I just added it to the sauce. But I think even 8 oz. instead of 10 oz. would have been too much.  We liked the radicchio, but 2 cups wasn't  enough for the sauce. Luckily I went ahead and wilted a whole head thinking I'd use the remainder in another recipe, instead I added it to this one & still wished that I would have had more to add. It really helps to cut/compliment the flavor of the Gorgonzola. It didn't take 5 minutes to wilt the radicchio on medium heat on my stovetop.  I didn't add any extra salt as the cheese provided plenty. We didn't even notice the taste of the nutmeg, so you might want to taste this & add more as you go along. I'll try this recipe again using 4 oz. Gorgonzola & 4 oz. of something else. I think I'll also use either rotini or campanelle pasta in place of the gnocchi.

Radicchio and gorgonzola are an arranged marriage by the gods themselves. This pasta is that divine. I topped it with some chopped walnuts. As we enjoy the flavors of radicchio and gorgonzola, next time I will double those amounts in the recipe. Take note that the serving sizes are extremely generous, 1 serving fed two people. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this with pasta based on reviews and also cut the Gorgonzola to 6 oz and then added around 6 oz of Gouda.  The initial taste was wonderful but it was very rich.   I do wish I had chopped my radicchio a lot finer though.
