I like to make this broccoli when I'm making an "asian" themed dinner. You can make this lighter and lower in salt by eliminating all the extra salt called for in this recipe as the light soy sauce provides all the salt the recipe needs. Two tablespoons of sesame oil was way too much for us the first time I made it, so I'll usually add a teaspoon at a time until I get to the right taste. Rice wine vinegar is also good used in place of the regular white vinegar, if you have that on hand. I like to add either toasted sesame seeds or chopped roasted peanuts and a touch crushed red pepper for added flair. My kids aren't much for broccoli but they'll eat this up willingly without complaint. It's all about trying what works for your family and making it good for who you're feeding. NOTE: Using the dressing for this recipe and substituting broccoli slaw works well for this recipe, too. GREAT for making wraps with cold teriyaki pulled pork.

This was a treat – a flavorful, colorful and healthy treat. I don’t like my *cooked* vegetables crunchy, so I increased the cooking time to about 3-4 minutes.   I adjusted the seasonings somewhat to suit my own tastes which I believe we always should do.  Keeping the amount of soy sauce the same, I reduced the vinegar, oil and sugar by half - I prefer it that way, but won't fault the recipe as this is purely subjective.  As for the sesame oil, the type wasn’t specified, so I used regular sesame oil and then the tiniest dribble of the fragrant and potent toasted sesame oil.  I garnished it with toasted sesame seeds and served it at room temperature.  Broccoli never tasted so good.

Instead of boiling the broccoli, I steamed it for about 4 minutes, until crisp-tender (which means I didn't use the 2 T of vegetable oil and 1 T salt). The whole recipe was simple and delicious. My 38 month old asked for seconds!

This is really good and a nice way to spruce up regular 'ol broccoli. I used a steam in bag of broccoli to save time. I cut back the sesame oil to one Tbsp. and used low sodium soy sauce. I also used rice wine vinegar vs. white vinegar and added some cracked black pepper and let this set for a couple of hours. I served this at room temperature with some toasted sesame seed over top and overall, very tasty.

Simple and delicious. I served it cold, halved the sesame oil(picky kids) and sprinkled with sliced almonds. I prepared the broccoli & dressing in advance but didn't combine them until 15 min. before dinner as I thought the vinegar in the dressing might discolor the broccoli.

I used a bag of raw broccoli slaw and cut the sesame oil in half. Used one tablespoon agave nectar instead of sugar and added 2 tablespoons roasted sesame seeds, 1/4 cup raisins, and some slivered almonds. Just mix the dressing with a wire whisk and pour over all ingredients let all ingredients marinade for an hour or two and enjoy. So yummy, I ate the whole salad by myself!

Excellent! Just what I was looking for. I cut down the sesame oil a lot (2 tsp instead of 2 tbsp), and steamed the broccoli.

I don't like broccoli but I know I should add it to my diet so I'm always looking for a good recipe that makes me want to eat it.  I've finally found it!  I love the sharp flavor of the soy sauce and vinegar.  Such a wonderful taste in every bite.  The only thing I did different was boil the broccoli a litte longer, I like it soft.  I will definitely be making it this way from now on.  Thanks so much!

Very good flavors going on in this recipe.  The sesame oil makes it a bit too nutty for my taste, so I reduced to 1 T. and also added some red chili flakes to introduce heat (I love spicy).

I steamed my broccoli omitting the need for oil and salt because the soy sauce is salty enough. Substituted rice vinegar, cut back on sesame oil (taste preference) and added grated ginger and chopped scallions. The ginger gave it a little extra pop. I served it cold and it was devoured. Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't overly impressed by this unfortunately. I thought  2 tbl. of sesame oil sounded like a lot, so I only used 1 tbl. and that was still all I could taste. Not a lot of depth of flavor here. Also, I think it would be better if you used rice wine vinegar instead of plain white vinegar! With some modifications this might be good!

This is a tasty salad, but the sesame oil is a little overbearing.  I mixed my broccoli with the rice from the Asian Salmon recipe on this site.  Much better mixed in.

I steamed my broccoli and tossed with ingredients. I did however substitute white vinegar with rice vinegar and used only 1Tbsp of Sesame Oil.  This was very, very good. A definite keeper.

I'd make it again but with some modifications. IMO this would be five stars with rice vinegar instead of distilled white, some grated ginger, and 1/2 tbsp brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I added some sriracha sauce at the end for heat, but that can make it pretty spicy for some so its not something I'd recommend for everyone.  Overall its pretty good and very easy to make, with the modifications stated above I think it would be just awesome. Thanks for sharing!

This really isn't a salad, but whatever it's called, it was just okay for us.  I didn't use any vegetable oil, no salt, halved the vinegar, 1t sesame oil; oh, & regular soy sauce (Sorry to those who don't like it when we do that) ... I also used 2T confectioners sugar - thinking it wasn't going to dissolve in the cold ingredients.  It's an okay recipe just needs a little spice - ginger, red pepper?  Thanks though, ChristyJ!  I enjoy lots of your other recipes!

I did make some changes to the dressing based on my personal preferences (for example, I knew this would be way too much soy sauce for me) but I think it still needs some work.  I cut back the light soy sauce to 1 Tbsp, used only 2 tsp toasted sesame oil (since it's stronger in flavor than regular) and used honey for the sugar, and Szechuan pepper infused sea salt.  I forgot to add red pepper flakes, as others had mentioned, but I think I would also use rice vinegar instead of regular distilled and perhaps add some orange juice to the dressing.   Even with my reductions, it was still very soy sauce-heavy.

Perfect alternative to heavy mayonnaise base salads that usually make their appearance at barbecues. I did adjust the oil to 1 tlbsp, and used seasoned rice wine vinegar, so ended up omitting the sugar. And added the sesame seeds. Very yummy! thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Made exactly as written except didn't add any salt.  Doesn't need it.  Will also use the sauce recipe to pour over ramen noodles instead of using the packet they come with.  A keeper!!

Good for picnic or potluck.Super-easy and quick to make. Made some new broccoli fans, too.
When I converted it to 10 servings, Iended up awash in dressing; it went right back in the colander til it  wasn't dripping. And it needed jazzing up ; I had a can of Szechwan seasoning in the back of the cupboard and used it liberally.

My family thought this was delicious Christy! Soy sauce has plenty on it's own so I skipped the salt and to give the salad some color, I added shredded carrot. Made this in the afternoon and served it chilled. Thank you!

Instead of doing all the work with the broccoli, I just bought broccoli slaw. I also added some green onions, and toasted sesame seeds.  It was excellent.  It's a new favorite side dish!

It is a good recipe that I will make again.  My only confusion was the amount of boiling time.  It took more than a minute to come to a second boil.  I let it go 90 seconds.  I will only let it go 1 minute next time even though it does not heat enough to boil after the broccoli is added.

Followed recipe to a "t" except for the sesame seeds, and I loved it!  A great new easy and quick way to eat steamed broccoli.

Unfortunately we didn't enjoy this at all.  The sesame oil was entirely too overpowering.

I love broccoli...but this recipe was not what I expected.  It was good, but I thought from the previous reviews it would be better.  Perhaps I made an error.

This tasted amazing.It is also super easy.I did exactly what the recipe said except I mixed in some sesame seeds at the end. My nanny and parents loved it. Also my 7 year old sister finally ate some vegetables. To me this tasted a lot like the broccoli you get at a Chinese restaurant. I will definitely be making this again.

Killer broccoli recipe!  This might be the best broccoli I've ever had.  I actually chose seconds on broccoli instead of bread - that NEVER happens :)  And my 3-year old even loved it!  I made this as is except I used a microwave steamer for the broccoli to make it a 5-minute side dish instead of waiting for water to boil. A quick shake of sesame seeds and a handful of sliced almonds made this over-the-top fabulous!

I use seasoned rice vinegar so I left out the sugar. Also added garlic. Next time I'll probably throw in some red pepper flakes. Thank you.

I initially had my doubts thinking this would be bland but gave it a shot. To my surprise I loved loved it. Super easy to make and with just a few ingredients packs a good amount of very nice flavor. I did cut back on the sesame oil as I think it gets overwhelming quickly and added toasted sesame seeds for a nice crunch. My new favorite way to have broccoli!

This was a good base but I had to change a few things. I added shredded carrots and onions and some garlic. Next time I would decrease the soy a bit and add sesame seeds to top it off. But over all a nice change for our broccoli.

This was really good and tasted authentic (at least as authentic as the Chinese restaurants I've been too). I am a cook who hates to measure and I think I probably over-guestimated the vinegar, so make sure you measure the ingredients as directed for this one. I really enjoyed it and it was very easy to make.

This was a pretty good recipe for a quick weeknight meal, and a new twist on brocooli prep. I added some teriyaki sauce to the dressing to punch up the flavor a little more. Thanks.

Great recipe!  I was looking for something quick to make with broccoli.  Added one clove fresh garlic, didn't do the ice bath so broccoli would stay warm, added toasted sesame seeds.  Thank you for sharing. Will make again and again!

This was great.  Just what I was looking for.  My husband said next time use the same dressing as the Asian Chicken Salad (another favorite of ours) with the broccoli.  I didn't have seasame seeds, but will definately add them next time.

This was terrific. I cooked the broccoli without the oil as I really didn't think it would need it. The dressing was wonderful. I bought more broccoli tonight to make this again this week. I'll try this with sesame seeds sometime.

Excellent!  Went great with the chicken dinner I had prepared.  I myself just steamed my broccoli and actually added a little more sesame oil to the dressing (just because I love the taste).  Thought it was a superb way of making broccoli.  Thanks!

If looking for a sauteed crispy broccoli recipe to go with stir-fry skip this recipe. It is definitely more of a cold salad like dish. To cut the sodium and calories, I eliminated the salt and oil to cook the broccoli. I didn't see how either were neccessary. I also cut the dressing in half, as I only wanted a light coating. I used rice wine vinegar as my only change initially. When I tasted the dressing, it was way too sweet and cold. I popped it in the microwave for 30 seconds and then ended up adding a pinch of garlic powder and about 1/2 tsp of dried chives to cut through the sweetness. Recipe is fine, but I prefer more of a hot broccoli side dish with my meal especially if it is cooked completely.

This is great! I steamed my broccoli in the microwave for three minutes and then mixed it in the dressing, for which I used 1/2 tsp sesame oil and 1/2 tsp olive oil. I agree with other reviewers that a full two tablespoons of sesame oil might be a lot, and you should add it to taste. Will make this again, thank you!

EWWW!!! I love broccoli and I couldn't eat this. I just rinsed it off and will now try to find a cream of broccoli soup to make in my vitamix so that I don't have to throw away my pot of green goodness. This was just bad.

The adults at the table thought it was okay...different. The kids at the table did not like it at all! If i tried it again, I'd go lighter on the vinegar, and maybe try Apple Cider vinegar.

I felt that it was a little too sour for me. If thats up your alley still give a shot. I think I will use this as a starting off point in preparation of future broccoli salads.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and it turned out great. I did add some freshly sliced button mushrooms (raw) when I tossed the broccoli with the dressing. I also let it marinate on the countertop for an hour or two. This allowed the veggies to really soak up the flavor. I will definitely make this again!

slight changes: i put about half a cup of water and the broccoli in a covered dish and microwaved it for about 4 minutes. in a small bowl, i made the dressing, using half the sesame oil (only because i ran out) and half the salt. then i drained the broccoli and poured the dressing into the dish and mixed. it was great!

Very good! I added some red pepper for color, and some leftover brown rice I had in the fridge to soak up the dressing. Yummy!

Flavor was too strong for me, but I like the boiling broccoli/plunging into cold water technique... it made the broccoli nice and green and soften it just enough to eat.

I'm always looking for new ways to prepare broccoli, as it is the only green veggie my picky son will eat. Unfortunately, he didn't like this, but the rest of us thought it was great! Next time, I leave some broccoli plain for the aforementioned picky child, but the rest of us are getting this!

I thought the sauce for the broccoli was PERFECT! I served it warm and coupled it with the Thai Style Tilapia (another on this site) and the combination was terrific! Thanks so much.

I thought this was very yummy! I will have to go buy more sesame oil so I can make it again! I made it with tofu and broccoli - yum!
