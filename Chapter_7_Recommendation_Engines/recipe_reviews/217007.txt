The dressing alone gets five stars! The flavor is so complex--slightly sweet, savory, citrusy. I subbed shallot for onion because I prefer the milder flavor, and I'm glad I did, because it was still a dominant flavor. I also used 2T olive oil and 2T water instead of the full 1/4 cup. The texture was like a thin mousse: fluffy, but loose enough to coat the salad nicely. I think you could add water until you get the desired thickness. I liked it better without the Parmesan. This was so easy and so yummy--a definite keeper!

I think I am going to love this.  The dressing tastes great; mine turned out pretty thick though.  Is that typical for others?

The recipe is not bad, but we weren`t impressed with it. The dressing sounded spectacular, but turned out just nothing especial for us. All we could taste was avocado. I added a little more olive oil and the dressing wasn`t very thick.

The dressing was really good. The fresh herbs makes this. I wouldn't bother if I didn't have fresh herbs. Although I read the reviews and added more liquid ( grapefruit juice) to tarten it up as well as to  thin it out. It made twice as much dressing as I needed, perhaps with the additional liquid.

  The salad itself is a good platform to add to. For the future, I will add  mandarin orange, and  maybe mushroom slices.  After allowing the dressing to blend,it is not quite as oniony  as it was when first made. I would NOT add more pieces of onion as the picture depicts.  Although the color presentation is beautiful. I am a BIG onion lover, so this is saying something. Maybe using shallots if you are just going to serve the dressing rapidly rather than in a few hours like I did.

Also, maybe croutons or something to add a little crunch would spiffy up the salad as well.  Next time I will use love loaf with a smear of blue or Camembert cheese or crostini as accents

Do NOT use the cheap Parmesan that is dry and grated from a green can... that will look terrible and lack flavor.  Get a nice hunk of cheese and shave it,don't grate it.  Don't even shred it...    


Overall, This is a recipe that will go into rotation, with a few tweaks.. I will use it as a main course as suggested.

Sorry but I followed the dressing recipe to the letter but the end result was inedible. I checked the recipe to see if I had the vinegar amount correct as that was all I could taste.  Asked my daughter to try it and she said it was awful..  I don't know what went wrong but this was a pre-brunch disaster.
