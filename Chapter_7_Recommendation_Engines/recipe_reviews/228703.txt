Let me start by saying that these burgers were DELICIOUS! However, when I was making the beef mixture, I quickly realized that 3/4 cup of the soup would be wayyyy too much. I quickly removed the meat before I had mixed it all together, so I probably only mixed in about 1/2 a cup. They were still really moist and didn't want to hold together, but somehow they did -- I cooked them on the stove instead of the grill because I was out of charcoal, and they ended up cooking fairly well. I had some mushrooms that I needed to use up, so I sauteed them and then added the sauce and heated it all up. I spooned plenty of the sauce mix on top of the cheese, and the burgers were absolutely delicious! I would recommend only adding about 1/4 cup or so of the sauce to the beef mixture, however, and serving the rest of it on top. I will definitely make these again with this simple change. It would definitely be a four-star recipe if the measurements were adjusted.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I can only give this recipe 1 star because the recipe doesn't work.  Using the amount of sauce it calls for the burgers are too moist and they don't stay together on the grill.  I managed to get one on the bun but the texture and the flavor just wasn't good.

I rated this only 4 stars bc when you mix the sauce in the meat, the burgers don't stay together. I think adding more meat or less sauce may fix that, however. Otherwise, it was quite tasty! I added the red bell peppers and spinach leaves because I love those ingredients with mushrooms. Other than that, I followed the recipe!

This is a great quick and easy recipe to make burgers for  a large crowd.  It had a subtle flavor that can easily be adjusted to suit personal tastes.  Good base recipe!

These were ok, but I agree w/ others that said that the sauce was too much for that amount of ground beef. I only used 1/4 cup of the sauce and that was plenty, IMO. I did not use the additional sauce on top of the burgers b/c, frankly, I'm not a huge fan of it...it's too runny and the flavor just doesn't hit the mark with me and my family. I am no stranger to using canned convenience items, but this wouldn't be something that I would buy, sorry...

I am giving this 4 stars, but that is with making it a little better than the recipe depicts and following the other reviewers. I only had 1 lb of beef, so I used 1/4 cup of the sauce only! What I can't understand is, are these really sauces, a flavoring, or something else? I don't normally open a can and just use a small portion of it. I would rather buy a smaller can or container of what I need for a recipe. I couldn't find the seasoning so I just used 1 tsp of hamburger seasoning. I broiled them instead of grilling and topped with homemade onion rings.
