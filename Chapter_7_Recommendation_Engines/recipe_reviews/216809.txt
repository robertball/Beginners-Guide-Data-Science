My husband and I tried this recipe last night. It took a while to cook, and was well worth it.  I have never been a fan of this particular veggie, but have been wanting to expand our veggie repertoire.  This recipe helped to accomplish that for me!  It smelled wonderful, and the Parmesan cheese and garlic worked wonders for this under-appreciated vegetable. I will make this again!  I didn't make any changes.  Thank you Christine for submitting this!!

Wow, have made this several times and there are never any leftovers.  I sprinkle all the ingredients over the brussel Sprouts and then pour the heavy cream on top and I do not take the cover off at the end.

Now I love brussels sprouts cooked anyway you want, but this was an outstanding dish! Like some others I found that I had to cook these much longer than the directions called for but they were well worth the extra time. The parmesan sauce thickened upon standing. I have to admit I put the leftovers way back in the fridge so they would go undiscovered and I had them all to myself the next day!

These were okay, but not as amazing as I expected them to be. The recipe doesn’t state whether to slice the brussels sprouts thick or thin. I guess mine were too thick, because they took forever to soften. The finished product was a little on the bitter side. My husband didn’t care for this side dish.

I have not eaten brussels sprouts in approx 40 years and had a hankering for them one day so I made these. I'm a convert. These were really good and even most of my kids liked them.

I love Brussels sprouts but the boyfriend and father do not. Men.... So I tried to hide the taste some what with this recipe. This was a big hit. I did add chopped up garlic and onions in the sprouts filled by the parmesan cream. Then baked as directed. 15mins before done I added on top a mixture of butter nutmeg and bread crumbs. Let it brown the served. Besides the long cooking time very very good.

I loved it, made it for family whom not all are fans of brussel sprouts, well they are now,just one little change to recipe and that was to boil sprouts in chicken broth(did not let them get to soft) to take any bitterness out,worked well.

I have made this recipe several times and its always I hit, I usually put some extra cheese on top. I increase the heat to 350 and cook for 90 minutes before I uncover to crisp up the top. Enjoy!

I had this at a friend's house and it was delicious. I went home and made it the very next night. Because fresh sprouts take so long to cook, I boiled them first to soften. Only ended up baking them for about 45 minutes. She also added bacon crumbles on top so I did as well (hey, everything taste better with bacon!)

Loved this, I roasted them first for about 30 minutes to get them crisp then put them back in the oven with cream and parmesan for about 20 more minutes. Very good!!!

The only reason I give it three stars is because I added more cream to mine where it probably wasn't necessary. Would have been fine with the amount given. I liked the added touch with the nutmeg. That gave it a lot of the flavour. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It will for sure be made again. With the appropriate amount of cream next time!

Omg these were outrageous! I paired it with lemon garlic chicken and it was perfect. Mmm mmm mmm. I used a blend of shredded cheeses. Parmesan Asiago and Romano.  And of course I added extra cheese.

Made this recipe as directed and it turned out delicious!  I did bump the oven temperature to 350 because many people said it took longer to bake than the hour and fifteen minutes. It baked up perfectly. The sprouts were on the soft side, which I like and browned nicely those last 15 minutes uncovered. Next time I may bake then a little longer uncovered to brown them more.

It was good but not enough flavor for my family so I added cut up left over highly spiced chicken to it and it was better. I might make it again.

I could not wait to try this right out of the oven! I used 12oz of shaved sprouts. Next time I want to add some chopped artichoke hearts to it. Love this recipe.

So good had seconds. I used coconut milk instead of cream. Normally, brussel sprouts would get a pass.

I must have sliced my sprouts too thin because at 45 minutes they were mushy. I like the flavor, but will see if my husband can get past the texture before asking what he thinks.

I added 4 cloves of garlic, because we love garlic! Thought it was pretty good, but next time I make I will add panko bread crumbs and a little extra cheese to top and broil.

Made was written. Very good flavor, Brussels sprouts were tender. Wife and daughter liked this dish also. 
Next time might add a little bacon, spread some panko or bread crumbs on top for a little crunch.

Tasty and I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts. Cook time is far less if you use frozen sprouts. Mine were overcooked after 50min, but I would certainly try again and check them more periodically.

We generally have some type of roasted Brussels sprouts on Thanksgiving, so we wanted something totally different to use up the leftover sprouts.  This fit the bill, was very delicious, and leftovers kept well without losing or changing flavor.  We did not alter the recipe in any wya.

This was fantastic!  I too added bacon since I was already frying bacon bits for a different  sprouts recipe when I decided to check the web for something else and ran across this.  The sprouts I had were quite a bit smaller than what I usually buy, so they did overcook just a little.  I think if I hadn't cut them in half they would have turned out better.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

This is awesome. It's not undercooked or over cooked as others have reported. Just halve the Brussels sprouts if they are normal size or quarter if they are huge. Follow recipe exactly. They are perfectly cooked. There is no way this serves 8 though. Definitely 4-5 servings. Maybe it serves 8 for those who think a helping of vegetables is 3-4 small bites.

It was perfect when I turned the temperature to 375 degrees for sixty minutes, cut the cream to one cup, and added 1 cup of shredded Swiss cheese during the additional 15 uncovered minutes.

This is a crowd pleaser. I bring it every year  for the last three years to our church's harvest dinner. I make two pans and bring little if anything home. I have to say we dropped the nutmeg after the first year.  I add bacon chunks to kick it up a notch. Next year I'm thinking of using asiago.

I was not sure of this recipe ~ BUT I was pleasantly pleased! I bought a large stalk of Brussels Sprouts  that needed to be cooked ASAP. I wanted a fast recipe.  This was it. I only made a few changes. I read 1 review that said coat Brussels Sprouts with lemon before you cook, + they will keep green color. I did not have heavy cream - I used half + half. The only other thing was the lemon. We love lemon in our house - I used 1 whole fresh lemon . We did not find the lemon over powering - just delish! We just added grated pepper. My sister who hates Brussels Sprouts ~ she dove right in.

This dish was amazingly delicious! I love brussel sprouts, but wanted to try something different with them. This recipe did the trick.  It was very easy to make, and had such wonderful flavors. I will definitely be making this again!

Pretty good. I added a pepper blend and red pepper flakes. I'll probably make again and add sharp cheddar. I also cooked on 350 and 20 min on 300.

I think I followed this recipe exactly but mine were severely overcooked.  I started with fresh ones.  The sauce was totally evaporated except for some curds of it.  I only cut the sprouts in half.  I think a higher heat and a lot less time would work better.  And lose the foil, I think it was like steaming them for an hour.  But as I said, could have been operator error.
