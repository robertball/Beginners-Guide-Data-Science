This recipe worked well. However, I did make some changes. I used the serving converter and made enough for 5 people. I substituted frozen corn for the cauliflower and I omitted the cream cheese from the mashed potatoes. Someone else complained about the milk not being enough for the mashed potatoes. Honestly I didn't even look at those measurements. I just made real mashed potatoes the way I always do (and I never measure there either) and it worked just fine, so probably "mashed potatoes to taste" would be a good addition to the recipe. I also forgot to add salt. Even without salt, this dish came out well and it was a hit with the kids (1 and 3). It worked great for finger food for my 1 yr old, and even my husband enjoyed it. It is super easy and a great quick fix meal. I would definitely recommend it, and it will be on our repeat menu as well. I give it four stars, for being a good, balanced, tasty meal. The only reason I wouldn't give it five is because five seems like it ought to be reserved for something really fabulous, ingenious, or out of the ordinary.

I found this recipe as I sought to rid the fridge of a head of aging cauliflower. It was delicious- preferable to the recipe not containing the cauliflower. I did omit the cream cheese in the recipe, and everything turned our wonderfully! Thanks!

Great basic recipe!!!  I used ground beef, minced garlic, and made my own real mashed potatoes.  Hubby and I loved it but will tweak it according to our tastes.  Am going to sprinkle red pepper chips in meat and onion mixture to make it spicer.  I see endless variations in this future pie.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was very, very, good.  It made wonderful leftovers.  The only thing we changed was that we only used two onions, that was plenty. Also, we used real mashed potatoes instead of instant.  But it was a very good recipe that we'll use again when we have company for dinner.

Excellent!
I mashed the cauliflower w/the potatoes (can't tell it's even there).  I also added about a cup of sour cream to the cream of mushroom soup.
I have three recipes for Shepherds Pie, and I think this is my favorite. My kids like it with corn better than with green beans.  This is a versatile recipe.

This recipe was worth a second helping! Omitted the cauliflower and added mushrooms to the ground beef. My family loved it!

Great recipe.  Never made this before.  Cut down a little on the onions and cooked the vegetables a little first.  Had lots of leftovers that heated up well and tasted just as good as the first day.

I was worried about making Shepherd's pie because I like spicy fun things (I am Italian!); but this recipe is very, very GOOD.  I defintely loaded up on the garlic powder - but even so, this recipe was awesome!   My English roommate and my Irish boyfriend gave me STANDING OVATION after the first bite!!!  I will definitely make this again and again!!!

*Makes a HUGE amount of food!!! The cream cheese made the potatoes taste really rich and delicious. ONE TIP TO ALL: salt beef/onions well, as I found it was a little on the bland side. But still definitely worth making.

I made this tonight and the only change I made was to halve the recipe.  I was very unimpressed.  While I liked the addition of green beans and cauliflower, the dish was very bland.  I had to double the milk because the potatoes were too dry. I don't think the cream cheese added anything special to the mashed potatoes.  Would have liked something with more oomph.

Decent recipe, but a bit bland. I think the cauliflower may have something to do with it.

Delicious! I used fresh veggies and pre-boiled them. I as well mixed the mashed potatoes with the cheese. I also used regular sirloin instead of ground and soaked it in A-1. Also use garlic salt between layers! It was SOOOOO GOOOOOD!

Very good-a rib-stickin hearty dish. I cut everything in half and it still made a lot! I used beef broth in place of cream of mushroom, after sprinkling a little flour in.   I also added some sliced fresh mushrooms instead of green beans, and a tablespoon or so of worcheshire.  Loved the addition of cauliflower!

First, Way too much onion & potatoes. I would recommend you use 2 large onions & only 8 potatoes. Second, this has a pretty good flavor but if you're looking for a traditional Irish Shepherd's Pie than don't cook this one. Not bad & a bit different. Makes great leftovers.

Delicious.  I added green beans, peas, carrots and celery.  I also made my regular mashed potatoes to put on top instead of following the directions in this recipe.

sub beef for ground turkey and added italian seasoning. cut recipe in half and still made enough to feed a small army. we ate it but it left something to be desired. added a lot of extra seasoning. not a fan of the cream of mushroom soup.
