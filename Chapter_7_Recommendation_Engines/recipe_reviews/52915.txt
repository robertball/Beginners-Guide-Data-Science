There is normally a two-to-one ratio of liquid to rice, and normally rice is simmered for 20 minutes.  I knew this before I tried the recipe, but decided to trust the recipe for some reason. Bad idea!  After 10 minutes, most of the liquid was gone, the rice was far from being done, and the rice was sticking to the bottom of the pan and beginning to burn.  I had to add more water (didn't have any more pineapple juice) and simmer rice until it was done.  I didn't care for the flavor, but by the time I went to eat it, I was thoroughly disgusted with the recipe for having the incorrect liquid-to-rice ratio and incorrect simmering time, and disappointed in myself for following the recipe and not my own instincts, and this may have tainted my judgment of the flavor.

Yummy and super easy to make!!! I only had 1 1/2 c. of pineapple juice on hand but I added 1/4 c. of water and the pineapple flavor was still there!!! Next time I'll add a little more curry since DH and I love curry!!! Our 1 year old even loved this rice!!! Mild and sweet with a great flavor. And the fact I can make it all in one pot is a plus....less dishes to clean up!!!! Thanks so much Kat for posting this recipe...we'll definately have it again soon!!!!!!

I had great hopes for this recipe, in spite of the mixed reviews.  I generally have no problem with rice, in fact I have a reputation for making perfect rice everytime.  Not this time, though.  I knew that 10 minutes would not be long enough to cook the rice, so I cooked it for the traditional 20 minutes.  When I removed the pan lid, I found the hard rice all stuck to the bottom of the pan, and the pineapple juice bubbling merrily away on the top.  I hurriedly scraped the bottom of the pan, and the rice wasn't burnt, just a bit toasty, so I covered the pan and cooked it for another 10 minutes.  By that time, the rice had absorbed most of the juice, but it was blown-out and gluey.  I didn't care for the flavors either.  Between this recipe and another unsuccessful recipe from this site, dinner last night was a disaster. Sorry.

I was short on the juice with only about one cup, so I added a cup of water to make a two-one ration.  I also upped the cooking time to about 20 minutes.  The rice came out cooked to perfection.  I must say that, as curry lovers, my husband and I found this to have a bit too much curry.  I will make it again but reduce the curry by at least half.  For those of you who have a problem with rice sticking to the pan, make sure you reduce heat to as low as possible.  If you still have problems, coat your pan with a tad of vegi oil, though in this recipe, the butter should help.

My husband and I loved this rice! Wow! I used 1 cup juice and 1 cup water for 1 cup of Jasmine rice. I also omitted the celery salt and add dash regular salt.

Although I was searching for a recipe for rice cooked in pineapple juice, this turned out not to be what I was looking for. My family did not care for this dish. I believe it was the celery salt that did it. My husband thought it had a "pickle" flavor. Also, I only used about 1/2 tsp of curry, as I didn't want it to overpower the other flavors.

This has a good flavor and the curry powder gives it a nice "kick".  We prepared this with pineapple juice and brown sugar marinated porkchops and it was a nice compliment.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was pretty good considering the trouble I went through to get it cooked.  It definetly needed more liquid.  I suggest 1/2 pineapple & 1/2 water.  I will definetly make it again though.

Unless you like your rice REALLY sweet, I would not recommend this recipe.

I made a few minor changes to this recipe.  I used canned pineapple.  I cooked the rice in the juice with the seasoning but then to finish it off I added the pineapple and a can of rinsed kidney beans.  I also cheated by using instant rice.  Its was really good though both I and my fiancee loved it.  I even took the leftovers for lunch the next day.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. The pineapple was a bit tangy and overwhelmed the curry. This recipe will probably need some tweaking with added spices to enhance the curry flavor.

I think the problem with this recipe as written is using pure pineapple juice as the liquid.  Looking at other reviews, those who used some water had better results, and googling using fruit juice to cook rice shows recipes that use half juice, half water for the liquid.

I used my electric rice maker to make this recipe and used as much juice as the amount of water recommended in the manual. My rice came out crunchy, for the first time in over 4 years of regularly making rice this way.  I liked the flavor (I subbed regular salt for celery salt), so I'll try again, but using half juice, half water.

This didn't come out quite a good as it sounded. I served it with Peanut Butter Noodles (recipe also found on this site), and that saved it somewhat, but by itself it was not great. The pineapple flavour was pretty much lost to all the curry, and the rice came out crunchy and had to be cooked longer.
