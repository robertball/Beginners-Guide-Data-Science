There are two almost identical recipes on this site - this one and "Gunline Coffee."  The Gunline Coffee has sugar and this one does not.  I wanted to see which one I liked better so I made up a batch of this recipe and tasted it.  Definitely needed sugar.  The Gunline Coffee recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups sugar, so I added that and it was much better!  Otherwise this is a great mix, love the cinnamon and nutmeg.  It would make a great gift!

My sister-in-law turned me on to this coffee. It is awesome.  I made this for somegifts for Christmas.  It was a big hit.  One thing, I used fresh ground nutmeg.  Awesome coffee.  And I am not really a big coffee drinker.  Thanks.

This recipe needs sugar.  For a single serving, I needed to add 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar to make it better.

YUM!!!This is really good! Personally, I don't add any extra sugar but I do put 4 Tablespoons of the mix into an 8-oz cup of hot water (just like any hot chocolate mix). To make it a bit richer, try adding a dollop of milk, half-and-half, or cream.

Very warming relaxing drink. I put some sweetner (supasweet) in it afterwards but the recipe is fine as it is. I don't drink alcohol but it would be a good idea to put something in this like rum or brandy and serve it to relatives at holidays.

This is great for camping! I remember camping with my dad when I was a little girl and his camp-brewed coffee always had grounds in it and was bitter.  Those were the days, but this is the simple choice for decent coffee.  Bring the mix already made and just add hot water!

just wanted to make a comment,some people complained that it needed sugar,I think it is better this way beceause people can add sweetness according to their own taste using sugar or sweetner.

My mom used to make this for company when I was a little girl (in the '60s) and it was called Brazilian Coffee.  The only difference is that she added sugar and put whipped cream on top and sprinkled it with cinnamon.  She would also make it with fresh brewed coffee by adding cocoa powder, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with the whipped cream on top which would melt into the coffee instead of using the cream or creamer.  Everyone always loved it.

I am totally hooked on this!  I mixed a baggie of it up for a recent camping trip & I loved it so much that I use it at home - better than any instant coffee mix around - very similar to a mocha if you don't add the spices.  I use a sweetened creamer so it is plenty sweet.

Halved the recipe to be sure I liked it.  Used regular non-dairy creamer and sugar free hot chocolate mix and decaf coffee.  Was good with 3tsp mix but next time will try 4tsp.  Added a pack of splenda.  I'm going to give out as Christmas gifts this year.  :)

This was very good.  After trying it I added another half cup of coffee crystals and about half a cup of sugar.  I used 4 heaping teaspoons of mix, added water then 1 teaspoon of sugar free coffee syrup.  Next time I will probably use vanilla flavored creamer.

I needed to add more than 3 teaspoons of the mix in my 1 cup of water so it didn't taste so diluted. I'm okay without the added sugar since we are trying to cut back on it.  At the same time, I like the fact that we can also adjust the sweetness if we want to by adding as much or little sugar as we want in each individual cup.  The cinnamon and nutmeg is subtle and a delicious addition.  I like to add cream or milk and sometimes even a splash of Vanilla Syrup (Torani's brand) in this for a more decadent treat.

Best Fireside Coffee Recipe so far! No sugar needed, there is sugar in the hot chocolate mix. I even tried it with caramel flavored hot chocolate mix. That was amazing!

I got this mix as a Christmas present and it's quite different. I was curious what was in it because of the smell of the mix, but as I drank it, I started to enjoy it. Definitely different from what I am used to. But I like it.

As other reviewers have pointed out -- the difference between this recipe and the 'gunline coffee' on this site is the sugar... And we all thought this recipe needed the sugar too!

Just made a small amount to check out the taste - which is delish!  I tried it in a cup of hot water - excellent - then I tried it in a cup of coffee in place of the expensive flavor creamers - 1 tsp in a cup of coffee  and a bit of sugar substitute- Perfect - I really like the nutmeg and cinammon flavor and it doesn't need refrigeration.  THANKS SO MUCH for this keeper.

Always a hit.  I make it often around the Holidays. It makes a great hostess or teacher's gift.  Put it in a pretty container or mason jar with a bow - Done!  Also good to have around for those cold winter days.  Something different than plain hot chocolate.

Good coffee treat. It needed some sweetness. I added a packet of Splenda.


Edit 10/9/17:  I made this again and left out the nutmeg. I liked this way better. The coffee was richer.

My sister-in-law gave us this mix as a Christmas gift last year (2014). We liked it so well that I mixed up more later and I'm getting ready to make another batch now.  I did not add any extra sugar (like the other recipe on this site calls for), however occasionally I will add one packet of sweetener to a cup.  And, depending on the size of the cup I'm using, I may add 4 tsp instead of 3.

Pretty good, it actually does need some sugar through. I added it to taste but next time will incorporate it in the mixture. I also used decaf coffee and mint chocolate hot cocoa. Really nice around a campfire and with a hit of bourbon in it :)
