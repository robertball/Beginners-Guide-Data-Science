This was very good! We had a late dinner so we were looking for something quick. We threw this in with ground turkey bamboo shoots baby corn and water chestnuts and served over rice. Also used only 1 onion diced canned tomatoes and powdered ginger. I will definitely make this again.

This sauce is like one my mother cooks a fair bit. I was suprised at the way the tomatoes went with the soya sauce and ginger to be honest. I used this as a base for a vegetable stir fry. I parboiled snap peas carrots baby corn and then tossed these into the sauce with some fresh button mushrooms cabbage and green caspicum. The sauce isn't overly spicy a good basic recipe to know. My only change was to only use one whole onion.

This sauce was different but good. I found it be both sweet & salty....a taste I am not use to. I did find the salt a little over-powering at first (I don't think it needs the extra 1/2 tsp as the soy sauce has plenty of salt already!). I would try again.

fairly close to what I make:) I would suggest trying corn or canola oil instead of olive oil to me the olive oil added an off balance taste. For a little bit of an earthier tasting sauce try using just a tiny bit of sesame oil

This is really good! I omit the tomatoes and use it with broccoli red peppers onions and stir fry noodles. I add lots of fresh garlic cloves. We love it! Thanks!

I used this sauce when I had a bunch of vegetable left-overs in the fridge. Made a great stir-fry. Thanks!

This sauce was okay but nothing to really rave about. It was too oily -- 5 tablespoons was too much! I would use this recipe again as it was simply and quick but I would sub 1 tablespoon oil for an extra tablespoon soy sauce. Also I only used one whole onion and that was the perfect amount.

Definitely a keeper! I thought 2 onions would be too much after finely dicing one and seeing how much was there. One onion was perfect. Also 1 tsp of garlic would never be enough for me so I just minced up 2 nice sized cloves and threw them in. Powdered ginger was a fine replacement for the root but I can't wait to make this again with the fresh stuff!

This was an okay sauce. If I make it again I will add a bit of red pepper flakes and maybe more ginger. I only had one tblsp of soy sauce so i used 1.5 tblsp of bragg's liquid aminos and a tblsp of rice vinegar to make up for it. The flavor was nice on my noodles broccoli squash and bell pepper just rather bland. I think this is a good base flavor to add to.

It was quick but I didn't find it to be very flavorful. It was bland. I followed others reviews and reduced the amount of oil and onion. In the end I added more soy and some wine and that made it edible. But that said the receipe was not what I was looking for nor will I use it again.

I took the suggestions and used less onion. I also added 1 Tbsp of red wine vinegar and 1 tsp of red chili paste. The chili paste gives it some nice heat. Without it the sauce may be a little blah.

I was in need of a quick stir fry sauce for my veggies. I made this one last night (without the onions and tomatoes). It was extremely easy and quick. My only substitutions were splenda for the regular sugar and ground ginger because I didn't have fresh ginger on hand. Mixed everything in a small bowl microwaved it for a minute and poured over my veggies. My husband said it was the best veggies I've ever made (and they were from frozen!). He had THREE HELPINGS and asked for me to make this again today. Thank you for the quick easy and tasty recipe!!

A great recipe. I would have given 5 stars except I made the following changes:  (1) Used 4 T Sesame Oil instead of 5 T Olive Oil. (2) Used 1 medium onion instead of 2 and quartered and sliced it very thin. (3) Reduced soy sauce to 2T. (4) Omitted the salt. (5) Added 1/4 t crushed red peppers.  OMG! This was the sauce I used tonight with wok-seared green beans and it was a meal by itself. Thank you for posting this recipe.
