I made this for our Easter Sunday dinner.  This was so rich, so delicious... AND SO EASY!  The only labor I expended was crushing the San Marzanos  by hand, and ladling all the fat out of the sauce that pooled to the top.  That's it!  Time and your dutch oven will do all the work for you.

I didn't change the recipe at all, or make any kind of substitutions.  It took about 5.5 hours for the meat to fall right off the bones.  There were some slightly stubborn pieces of meat with that silvery connective tissue holding the meat to the bone, so I just let those particular pieces simmer in the sauce for another half hour, and they released when the connective tissue dissolved.

I was wary of making this and was afraid it would be too greasy (bad experience making short ribs once), but it totally wasn't!  I didn't have time to refrigerate it to chip the fat off, so I just used a flatter ladle and poured the fat into one of the San Marzano cans.  The sauce was silky and rich, the meat was so flavorful, and I cannot wait to have the leftovers tonight for dinner.  Thank you, Chef John, for a very special recipe and for guiding me through a cut of meat I never used before!

I genuinely believe this is one of the best dishes I've ever made. So easy and hands-off, and intensely flavorful! I did add a dash (probably 1/4-1/2 tsp) garlic powder after tasting the final sauce, to fit my family's taste. I also wish I had added more red pepper flakes, as 1/4 tsp can't be tasted in the final sauce at all. Some notes that may help others:

This was my first time working with oxtail, and I didn't realize that some of the bones have little "caps" about the size of a nickel. It was easy to pull out the primary bones, but my husband got a "cap" in his ragu - whoops. Next time, I will go through the final sauce very carefully before serving. 

We used two cans diced tomatoes plus one small can tomato sauce in place of the 4 C sauce (just because it's what we had on hand). Some additional sauce would have been welcome - it was pretty meat-forward the way we did it - and also we ended up with about a half an inch of burnt-on goo in the bottom of our pan that was hell to remove. :( So DO use that 4 C recommendation as your starting point, don't go skimpy like us! 

The bright side of using diced tomatoes (and the reason I will probably use them again, albeit in greater quantity) is that the sauce was a little more chunky, so no fat skimming was necessary. All liquid left in the sauce WAS fat, so we just poured it off. Couldn't be easier. The dish still turned out moist, flavorful, and absolutely delicious, and the sauce stuck to the pasta well.

Absolutely delicious and flavorful! Best tomato sauce I've ever experienced. It's really easy to make and just takes lots of time to cook properly. Really hard to mess this dish up. Just keep cooking on simmer until the meat falls off the bone. Great dish by Chef John and highly recommended.
Thanks to you sir.

This turned out even better than I expected it would. I made it the day before I planned to serve it. After skimming off the fat the next day, I brought it back to a simmer and cooked another 45 minutes or so. The meat falls off the bones and the sauce is incredibly rich with all the oxtail flavor.

This recipe is really easy to follow and takes the worry out.
Since  I was pressed  for time, after  I had broiled the oxtails, I put everything in the pressure cooker for 75 minutes.  My husband and kids loved it!
I also switched the white wine for red wine and added some sweetness  with whole prunes.

This was delicious. I added diced carrots and celery to the onions, used one can of tomato paste, a box of crushed tomatoes and a box of sauce (both by Pomi), and I heavy handed the sherry vinegar (shy of 1/2 cup). I used 4.5 lbs of oxtail and added white button mushrooms -quartered, and I doubled the herbs. I also added two packets of Sazon by Goya ( the plain one with corriander). My family devoured it!

Excellent! Very easy also, just time consuming but worth it. House smelled great all day. Planning to make it again and the leftovers aren't even gone yet.

This was really tasty! I added a bit of diced carrot and celery to the onions/garlic, and instead of simmering on the stove top, I placed this in a 225 degree oven for 4-5 hours instead. My burners on my gas stove have a tendency to burn things, even when on "low", so the oven was the better route for me. In hindsight, I would add the carrots and celery a bit later, as they did burn on the pan a bit while roasting the oxtail (my fault). Overall, the flavors were spot on, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. We tossed this with ziti, but rigatoni would be great as well. Will make again!

This was delicious and fairly easy.  My only problem was finding large pieces of oxtail.  The grocery stores in my area only carry one brand of oxtail in shrink wrap packages.  After opening the packages I discovered one or two large pieces of oxtail in each package and lot of smaller pieces, from nearer the tip of the tail, I presume.  So, my presentation was not as pretty as Chef John's because I had to remove the meat from a lot of small pieces of bone, but it still tasted great.

I switched things up as I found the recipe to be a bit boring, it turned out 5 stars.  Amazing.  Added 3 diced up slices of bacon while browning oxtails, then let them melt away into the sauce.  Omitted the rosemary.  

Enjoy!

Always appreciate Chef John's take on cooking! I reduced the amount or garlic from 6 to 2 cloves and served over fresh linguine. This recipe is VERY HEAVY and RICH and needs to be balanced with light bright flavors. My 4 star rating is based on the fact that I am a carnivore and don't mind picking the meat off of bones and the fact that we really appreciate the nose-to-tail philosophy of using the animal. But I skimmed off a full 8 ounces of fat, as the chef recommended.

I use red wine instead of red sherry vinegar. It was very good, please try it.

I cooked the ox tails in the oven as described, but then went with my slow cooker to finish as I couldn’t mind the stove that long., as I had errands to run.  This did allow me to pour off the fat from the drippings in the pan after deglazing it with the chicken broth, then put the tails and onion along with some chopped celery and carrot I wanted to use up, and the rest of the ingredients into my crock pot.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours, then low for 4 hours, but it needed a couple more hours after that before the meat fell off the bone.  It was worth the wait.  I think next time I will use red wine instead of sherry vinegar though, just a taste preference.

I loved this recipie! Just made it and everyone scraped their plates clean!!! I used 4 cups crushed tomatos and 4 cups tomato sauce! (I like a lot of sauce) Great consistency and the sauce stuck onto my pasta really well. i added some garlic and onion powder at the end and some sugar to counteract the acidity of the tomato. Definitely will make this again- it was amazing!

I’m literally on my second helping! This is sooo good. I didn’t use noodles but put my own spin on it using rice. I cooked the rice in the broth while adding water to the broth as it was super thick. I didn’t put the oxtails in the oven either. I just cooked them straight away on the oven using the said ingredients and it didn’t take 5 hours to cook either. In the end the meat was falling off the bones.

I followed the directions exactly but it was a bland letdown. The sauce didn’t even stick to the pasta, which I didn’t rinse before using

This happened to my onions. Not sure what to do next.
