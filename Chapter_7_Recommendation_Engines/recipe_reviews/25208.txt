Wow, I have NEVER tasted a better muffin in my life and I am not kidding!! Although I always try to lean my recipes out a bit to make them more healthy. I used FF Half/Half and substituted applesauce for the butter with just a splash of olive oil. I also use Whole wheat or Oat bran Flour and mix half and half with the white flour.

I used sour eggnog and it was also a nice flavor enhancement. They were a huge hit at the office and I'll make them again!

I really liked the idea of this muffin, but the recipe as is doesn't work.
I revamped it as follows:
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tsp each of baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and vanilla
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1/8 cup canola oil
1 egg
1/2 cup cinnamon chips

In a large bowl combine all the wet ingredients, mix throughly.
Add cinnamon, baking soda and baking powder.
Add flour and stir until almost all flour is mixed in, add chips and stir to combine.
Fill greased muffin tins, I got 12 large muffins, bake at 350, check at 20 minutes, my oven bakes hot, should take 20-25 minutes

Great use of a wealth of bran cereal I was gifted. I bought a bunch of bags of Hershey's cinnamon chips right around Christmas and stuck what I didn't use in the deep freeze so I was able to make these without substitutions. I ended up making a half recipe of this--12 muffins. To make it a little healthier, I used whole wheat white flour and cut the buttermilk by half and substituted homemade organic applesauce. I actually got exactly 12 muffins out of a half recipe of this--that almost never happens! 12 big muffins, as a matter of fact. 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they were perfect. Good with the cinnamon chips but I think these would be just as good with dried fruit (like raisins) or even chopped apples. It's really a good base for you to play with and make healthier (if you so desire) or throw in whatever you may have on hand. NOTE: The recipe does not say to soak cereal in milk. I've made bran muffins before out of bran cereal and I've always had better results if I soak the cereal in the milk/liquid for about 10 minutes before adding in the other ingredients. If you soak it, you won't have such an issue with wet batter, too. I think using whole wheat white flour helped with that a bit, too.

This is a nice muffin.  I especially like the "cinnamon chips" thing!  It adds flavor and texture.  Some reviews rave about this recipe as being so "healthy"- but I beg to differ.  Don't get me wrong, these are really good, but eating a muffin is like eating a piece of cake (flour, butter, sugar, etc).  Just because you throw some bran in a recipe, isn't going to make it "healthy." :)  This recipe is definitely tasty though.

I had to add about an extra cup of flour because the batter was really runny, and I didn't use the cinnamon chips because I didn't have any--just increased the ground cinnamon.  They were awesome--we loved them!

I have to say this is the best bran muffin recipe I have ever made AND tasted!! The cinnamon gives these muffins a delicious flavor, and the buttermilk adds an incredible moistness!

The batter seemed too moist, but the muffins came out with an okay consistency. Overall the muffins were okay, but not exceptional. Kind of bland.

FLAT. I was sooo disappointed with this recipe, I had high hopes with the cinnamon chips sounding so good, but they didn't rise.

I have found, for the best results to let the batter sit for about half an hour to allow the bran cereal to thicken it up. I also make sure to crush the bran into the measuring cup when measuring out the cereal.  This recipe has a nice mild bran flavor to it and my kids love them.

I rarely rate anything under a 4 but felt that this recipe can be excellent (complaints about if being runny) but should sit at least 5 hrs. (or overnight) before baking.  You will see a big difference.

These came out really good with a few changes.  I only used 2 cups of butter cream since everyone said it was runny, I used applesauce and olive oil instead of butter, and we added some frozen mixed berries for flavor.  It made about 20 good sized muffins.  Will make again! :)

This recipe doesn't work! I followed it exactly as is and my batter was literally liquid and I had to pour it into the muffin tins. They also didn't raise (even with 2T baking powder!). The up side is that they still taste pretty good even though they look like flat little hockey pucks! I have NO idea what I did wrong!

I did not care for this recipe. But my husband and brother in law liked them and that's who I made them for so I guess they passed. I omitted the cinnamon chips for a healthier muffin....I'm assuming that's what made them taste good. Although I would never eat these, the weird boys that live with me will so I will make them again.

Very good. I cut the cinn. chips in half though to cut back on some of the fat and they still tasted great. Also, I didn't have to bake mine for quite that long so you might want to keep an eye on them. Great muffins!

DISASTER MUFFINS!!!
I was so excited to try this recipe, but I was more than disappointed by the results.  Firstly, the recipe calls for way too much buttermilk and way too little flour, making the batter a runny liquid mess.  Secondly, the recipe calls for TWO TABLESPOONS of baking powder.  Why?  Again, that is too much.  The cinnamon was too strong as well...enough to make your nose run.  The muffins were far from done after 30 mins in the oven...I left the them in for another 5...and another...the tops started getting dark so I took them out and cut one open.  IT WAS RAW!  Flat, crunchy tops with sticky goo underneath.  I covered them with tin foil and they were in the oven another maybe 10, 15 minutes?  THEY WERE STILL RAW!!!!!  The batter was way too wet.  Either use half of the buttermilk, or double the flour.  Now I have two dozen inedible muffins to deal with.  They’re really more like baked pudding.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and this is what happened.  Needless to say, I will NOT be making these again!
Edit: Like the other reviewers, I have to agree that the recipe is a good idea.  But the measurements are WAY off.  I like the idea of buttermilk for moisture and flavor, the cinnamon, the chips...but this recipe needs to be altered drastically in order for it to work.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and the muffins turned out terribly.  The batter was extremely thin, and all of the cinnamon chips sunk to the bottom of the muffins.
