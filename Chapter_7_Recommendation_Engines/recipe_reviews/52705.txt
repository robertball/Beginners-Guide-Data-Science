I used frozen white corn and homemade italian seasoning that I scaled back to a half teaspoon. My husband and kids ate every bite.

Unbelievably tasty! I was skeptical, but the combinations of spices and heat transform a boring corn side dish into something special. I used a micro-steamable bag of corn, then followed the recipe. Use the high heat recommended. Delish!

Hubby really liked this.  I smelled a little strong while cooking but the over all taste was very good.  Easy too!  Thanks.

Very good. Gave 4 stars only because I had to add more salt at the end for our liking and another 1/2T of butter, but I will make again.  Thanks!

Very, very simple, quick, and cheap! My one year old loooved it; this is all he wanted to eat for his dinner. The rest of us really liked it, too. I think this side dish would go well with most any kind of meat entree, but tonight we had it with baked chicken, and they were great together. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again for a quick weeknight side dish.

Used rendered bacon fat instead of butter and added some fried onions along with about a tbs of flour and left it to simmer slowly. ADD SALT! You will need it.

I roasted and ear of corn in the microwave and gleaned the cob with a knife then added diced onion, bell pepper, tomato with green chilis, celery, black beans and garbanzo beans, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper and a dash of balsamic vinegar. Fold all that together and chill in the frig. Bon Appetit!

I didn't like this at all, and I really thought I would.  At a minimum, it needs more salt.  Won't try again.

We love corn, we love italian - but this was anything but irresistible. Maybe fresh/cob corn would be better but I had to add more butter and seasoning and the flavor of the corn didn't shine much.  Maybe this recipe is for people who don't like veggies much - akin to pouring velveeta all over your broccoli and then saying you like broccoli.......

My son loved it, my husband didnâ€™t like it.      My dilemma , lol

I think it needed slightly less Italian seasoning and little more salt.

This was very easy but not exactly irresistible. Tasted like buttered corn with italian seasoning.

Easy and very good. Will make again. Blanched corn on the cob for about three minutes and then cut off the cob. Will try again with frozen corn. Might even throw a little finely chopped red pepper in that as well.

06.25.17 ~ Delicious corn doesn't get much easier than this recipe.  I pulled a package for fresh-frozen corn off the cob from the freezer and proceeded with the recipe.  We liked the Italian seasoning and the extra flavor it gave the corn.  It paired nicely with homemade pizza.

I needed something quick as a side and this recipe is so easy with all the ingredients on hand.  I was surprised by the reaction, it was so positive!  Loved it and I felt embarrassed because of how easy it was.

Very good!  We kind of get in a rut with making the same old veggies with every meal, so this was a nice change and everyone liked it!

I mixed this up with some wild rice, and served it up with some good tilapia.

Ready to have it again!

I did try this recipe and it was sooo excellent.  I scaled back
the Italian seasoning a bit & used fresh corn from the cob.
