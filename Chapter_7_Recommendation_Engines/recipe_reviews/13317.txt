I've fallen back on this recipe more than once this winter, and was happy with it each time.  The spices aren't too strong, especially with the sweetness of the carrot.  I didn't find it necessary to use oil when I cooked the lentils and vegetables in water on the stove instead of in the pressure cooker.

Blah and too sweet. I didn't think the whole cinnamon nutmeg cloves thing would work and it didn't.

Very warm flavors, and very tasty but just a bit sweet. The sweetness is similar to that of a squash soup. We added some dried red pepper flakes to give it a kick at the end. Would be good garnished with some toasted sage leaves.

I was weary of the onion soup flavour mixed with, in essence, pumpkin spice flavour. In fact, I didn't care for it. I tried to adjust by adding some roasted pumpkin then added some firm tofu. Texture is a plus for me, because it gets nice and thick. I added some stock the next day to thin out the leftovers. In the end, I'd make this again but would cut the "pumpkin spice".
