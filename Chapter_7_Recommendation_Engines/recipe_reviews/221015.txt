Great recipe! I made a few changes. I didn't make the glaze. I didn't have ginger or Egg Beaters. I used 4 whole eggs. I cut the amount of oil in half & substituted applesauce for the other half. Score one for Mom: my kids had no idea they ate their veggies for dessert!

Nice muffins!! Used more zucchini, less oil.  Added a crumble to the top. 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 flour, 3 tbsp butter. Mix until forms crumbly texture. Sprinkle over each muffin before baking.

I followed the recipe but made muffins and used a whole fresh pineapple that I put in the blender for a few seconds, then drained the excess fluid. I did not frost them and it was not necessary. I made large muffins and they cooked in 25 minutes.This was very yummy!!  Thank you!

This cake is great! I used 4 eggs, as suggested in another comment, and cinnamon chips instead of the raisins. Added a cream cheese frosting and decorated with toasted coconut flakes and pecan chips. Delicious! We loved it. I put it in my recipe box, will definitely be making again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Most excellent cake.  I was excited to see that zucchini was included in this recipe, as I would have added it at this time of year.  I  used 4 eggs, used walnuts instead of raisins, and did a classic cream cheese icing, but that was as far as I strayed from the recipe, and it was yummy.  My friends at work loved it.

The spice flavor is great in this cake! I love that it has a little zucchini as well as the carrots. It did come out a bit sweet though...
I definitely did some substitutions - used all white sugar, for example. 4 eggs seems a bit much to use as a replacement for the substitute.
Definitely recommend this because the ingredients are pretty simple. It's a cake great for any time of day, packs a lot of flavor, and doesn't even need an icing (the recommended icing was either too sugary or too watery when creating it).

If this recipe were titled "Fruit Spice Cake", I'd be giving it 4 or even 5 stars. The pineapple and raisins are powerful, the cake is good (though very wet), and the icing was brilliant. But there's no flavor of carrot whatsoever. If you're looking for something with a distinctly carrot flavor, ... keep looking. I'm glad I tried this out a week in advance of the birthday party, because it's not going to work for the person who requested carrot cake.

Made this cake, took it to work to share and my co-workers absolutely loved it!!  I substituted a few of the items, mainly because I didn't have what the recipe called for.
Used Grape-seed oil instead of vegetable oil
Used 4 whole eggs
Didn't have zucchini, so substituted with (1) cup of shredded apple (fuji).  
(1) Teaspoon of baking soda and (2) teaspoons of baking powder... mainly because I don't like the stronger taste of baking soda.
I don't think the substitutions I made would have changed the outcome of the original recipe much... It is one of the best cakes I've made.
Thank you for sharing your recipe Molly :-)

I made 3  cups of grated carrots because I didn't have zucchini. It turned out excellent! Very healthy and loaded with goodness! Yummy!
