I liked that the apple Pucker tamed the bite of the Crown. I made sure to shake this very well in my cocktail shaker. The colder, the better. Not my favorite, but drinkable.

This is very good. I usually serve it over ice instead of as a shot.

I thought this was just ok. Maybe I am just not a sour girl!  I was looking for shot recipes for a party I am hosting next week.  I don't think is is what I am looking for.
