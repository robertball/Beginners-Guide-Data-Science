I had to write a review after reading this recipe card.  I have been making this exact cake for nearly 20 years.  You can easily cut down on up to 1/2 the oil, and about 1/4 of the sugar if you want.  You can also replace 1/2 of the sugar with brown sugar or bakable splenda.  Yes, the cake get's alittle mushy after 24 hours, but really does it last that long at your house?  Not mine!  Finally, why are we peeling the apples?  Unless you really don't like "crunchy" or just plain don't like apples, leave the skin on.  It brings a whole new depth to the dish.  Plus, you will get the health benefits!  Give it a try.  The cake is awesome.

Excellent bread--even pleased the very fussy eaters.  Freezes well.  However, I make some modifications.
Reduced oil to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  Reduced sugar to 1-1/2 cups.  Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg.
I used granny smith apples, peeled and sliced, which added just a little tartness, but any cooking apple would be great this recipe.
When cooled, sprinkle with  powdered sugar.

This is a REALLY delicious apple cake!  I peeled the apples quickly w/ my Starfrit Apple Peeler.  I cut back on the oil (maybe like 3/4 cup) and a little less sugar.  As I was mixing, the batter was dry so I added milk.  I added milk until the consistency was 'cake-batter-ish).  I baked for 20 minutes then added a streusel topping I made (1/4 C Sugar, 1/4 C Flour, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 3 tbsp of butter).  Baked for another 20 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.  It's wonderful!!!!!

I had never made an apple cake before and someone at work requested it for a potluck, so I took a stab at this one and everyone loved it!  I also substituted 1 c. of brown sugar with the white and added the streusal topping that someone else had suggested.  It was very moist and tasted great!  Everyone was asking me for the recipe!  This would also work great with a powdered sugar glaze too!

I have been looking for my Grandmother's 'Apple Squares' recipe for years and this was close.  They had a great taste but they were just too oily for me.  I would go with one of the other suggestions on this board and reduce the oil ( and possibly the sugar as well. )

I've been making this apple cake for many years and have never had it fail. For my own personal taste, I usually add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, as well as 1 Cup of chopped pecans or walnuts. Raisins are also a nice addition. I usually use about 1/2 cup. The dough will be very stiff and require mixing by hand with a heavy duty wooden spoon. You can use a 9 X 13 greased and floured pan or a 10-12 Cup Bundt Pan. If using a bundt pan, bake at 350 degrees for 55 to 65 minutes or until the cake tests done using a toothpick or cake tester inserted about 2 inches from the edge. Tester should come out clean (free of dough). Also, if using a bundt pan, you will have to scoop dough from bowl and pack it evenly into cake pan. This is easy to do if you wet your hands first.

I really liked this recipe. Instead of oil I used melted butter as I don't like the taste of the oil .. it was really good. The entire recipe was great and I will definitely make again .. very moist.

This was a great cake! I had to keep checking the recipe, because it didn't quite look right (a lot of apples!), but it turned out great and didn't last a day in my house.

I added brown sugar, then served it with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. DELICIOUS!!!

YUM! As was suggested in the reviews, I replaced half the oil with applesauce, changed the sugar to 2/3 cup white and 2/3 cup brown, added a pinch of nutmeg, used 2 large apples, and topped it with streusel (1/4 c flour, 1/4 c sugar, 1 t cinn, 3 Tb butter) that I put on halfway through baking. I split the batter between 2 9" round pans. Perfect and YUM! Will make it again!

I don't know what happened but this did not come out for me at all. I think I over beat it. It was very thick. This was easy but mine ended up in the trash.

I've been making this for years, too.  This recipe is my favorite part about this time of year.  The "batter" is supposed to be thick like cookie dough and it would be good if they would tell you that.  I have found that the cake actually has a slight cookie-like crunch to the crust that really adds to its overall deliciousness.  While the oil is a healthier way to make the cake, using melted butter makes it come out SO much better.  Feel free to use up to 1/4 cup less butter than indicated, too.  I first stumbled upon this recipe as one for a Bundt pan and that is still the way I make it.  I drizzle it with a bit of glaze before serving.  I've often thought that the addition of some cranberries could really be nice, too.

This cake was excellent! I don't understand the reviews that said it was a gooey mess - turned out to have a great consistency for me. But I did follow a couple of the recommendations I read.....1 cup white sugar & 1 cup brown sugar vs 2 cups of white and instead of 1 cup oil I used 1/2 cup oil & 1/4 cup melted butter.  Once I added 1 cup of chopped pecans and sifted powdered sugar over it when it was done. I cooked it in a Bundt pan for 55 min. The batter is very thick, almost like cookie dough, but don't worry.....It looked beautiful, smelled wonderful and tasted great!  Perfect for holidays and very easy! Two thumbs up! Thanks!

Excellent recipe, not too much work.  Mine took a lot more baking though, after 30 minutes it was well browned on top but not cooked in the middle so I had to turn the temperature down and cook it for another 25 minutes.  I have an electric fan oven, but it is getting old now.  Tasted delicious, especially warm with walnut ice cream!

This is almost exactly how Grandma taught me to make Apple Cake when I was a kid. Grandma uses butter instead of vegetable oil and she always adds a teaspoon of baking powder, nutmeg and cloves. This is comfort food for me. I make a lighter version now with applesauce in place of half the butter, whole wheat flour, and organic apples. GREAT with ice cream or frozen yogurt melting over slices of the warm cake.

I am absolutely sure this recipe would be delicious as written. Since I'm pregnany however, I made a few small modifications to 'healthify' it a tad and it was still wonderful. I cut the sugar back by a half cup, using a blend of 1c white and 1/2c brown. I used 1c whole wheat flour with 1c white flour. Fibre is my friend these days. And I reduced the oil to 2/3c, adding in 1/2c plain yogurt. This makes a moist, yummy, perfect cake. The dough seems thick and not cake like but the apples ad moisture to the batter as they bake. Oh and one last thing, my 9x13 pan had mysteriously walked away when I made this, so I used a springform pan. Had to up the baking time to 50 minutes. Cheers all.

This would be a five-star recipe if only it called for HALF of the sugar. I made this for a neighbourhood get-together and am so happy I halved the sugar. It was gorgeous with that amount, and totally sweet enough. A neighbour made the same exact recipe but followed it to a 'T'... I'm so happy she did b/c we were then able to compare the two cakes back to back. The one with the full amount of sugar was cloyingly sweet - way too sweet - and was denser and almost gluey. Mine was much lighter in texture, but still perfectly moist. I must admit that when making the cake I was a bit nervous as I'd never seen such a thick cake batter before. Don't fret - it is very thick but still works a treat. I will make this cake again and may even cut down the sugar some more, and will reduce the oil by 1/4.

I've made this cake twice in the last few weeks.  It's very easy and sooo tasty.  The hardest thing is peeling and cutting up the apples!  The only change I made is to slice the apples instead of dicing them.  Don't think it matters much either way.  Oh, and I served each piece with a large dallop of whipped cream.  Yum! 
I made it Sunday for my mom's birthday dessert.  She is 84 now and insisted on taking a large piece home.  Very very good.  Thanks!....an update 10/06/08 I made this again on Sunday, this time I used a 1/4 cup less oil and I still sliced the apples instead of dicing.  Mine took just about 38 minutes.  Once again, very very good!

AMAZING! This is the best apple cake ever! I did make a couple changes. I used only 3/4c of oil..but subbed 1/2c for applesauce. I also used the suggestion of 2/3c white sugar, 2/3 c brown sugar. I also had to bake it for nearly 50mins before the bottom of the cake cooked. But even if it hadn't it wouldve still tasted amazing!

Since it is only my husband and myself, I halved the recipe using the calculation device. I used 2 granny smith apples, 1/2 tsp. of baking powder instead of the soda, and 2 tablespoons of milk since the batter was so stiff.I also used the struesel topping and baked for 40 min. The result was outstanding. It was moist,lots of apple flavor. Yum!! I should have baked a whole recipe. I could eat the whole thing myself!! Thanks for this marvelous recipe!!

5 stars with alterations - 3/4 c oil, 3/4c brown sugar and 3/4 c white sugar. I also added 1 t mixed spice.  I like this cake more than some apple cakes because it holds its shape well - it's not all soft like a German apple cake.

I never made apple cake before, so I researched many recipes before deciding on this one. First time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. It was way too sweet for our taste and a little on the oily side. But I think that is a personal preference. Next time, I used one cup of sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. And used only half a cup of oil. It was perfect. I had to bake a little longer because my oven tends to be on the cooler side for the set temperature. I think this cake is more of a muffin texture for me - not a complaint, just an observation, I loved it. I say that because my family likes to eat this for breakfast than dessert. It never stays long enough for me to see how it tastes after a day or two in the fridge. I think next time I will half the recipe and make it in a nine inch round pan. Thank you for an easy and great recipe.

It didn't look right (not like a batter at all - more like soft crumby mix) but it cooked up perfectly.  I left the skin on my apples and still fabulous (extra nutrients and easier!).  This is very rich with the amount of oil - almost a streudel without the cake part.  It was a hit - would be great with ice cream or whipped cream.

Awesome cake!!! I do cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and the oil to 3/4. I also add a cup of chopped walnuts to it.

This was horrible!  I made it for my son's class the night before I needed it and ended up having to quickly make something the next morning.  It was mushy and gooey. i couldn't even slice it!   I thought that I could turn it into some kind of apple cobbler for my family so that I wouldn't waste it by putting ice cream on top but even that wasn't palatable.  I will not make this again!

loved this as a dessert. however i was worried throughout the baking process. didn't know to what extend foamy mean so just beat the oil and eggs until a lot of bubbles were present. i added all the dry ingredients at once which i think i should not have done because the mixture was dry and i didn't think it was going to blend it. i persisted but the mixture was not a batter. it was very stiff unlike any other cake mixture I'd made before. The suggested baking time was not nearly enough. The cake was a nice colour but was still wobbly in the middle. A further 30 minutes later I decided to remove it from the oven. Despite all my concerns it turned out to be really moist. Next time I will add walnuts or sultanas but I'm not too sure what I could do about the suggested time being doubled what is suggested in the recipe. Any suggestions?

Terrible. The batter did not pour into pan - it was more like a crumble and had to be pressed into the pan. Too sweet and oily. The only tasty part was the apples.

Here's the thing.  The flavor... AMAZING!  I'm giving it 3 stars because like some other reviewers, it would not cook.  Even after 50 minutes it was still very mushy on the inside with a hard crust on the top.  I think you really have to cut down the oil or something.  It was more like a bread pudding.

Very easy, very good.  edit:  this time I used 1 cup brown sugar and one cup white sugar.  3/4 cup oil and didn't peel apples .  This time I used my 9 x 13 glass dish, took way longer to cook, approx. 55 mins. Very good

Delicious!, i made a few changes, because I wanted it to be healthier...1 cup white flour and 1 cup of kamut flour...3/4 cup sugar (2 cups is excessive!) I then put about half the batter in a loaf pan, layered a mound of extra apples on top and then topped it off with the remaining batter. I mixed all the wet ingredients in a cuisinart, and the dry in a bowl before adding to the wet. Result was  a beautiful apple loaf!!

This is the best!  My batter was also very thick, so I added about 2 tablespoons of milk. Instead of 1 cup white sugar, I added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  It turned out perfect!

wow total flop for me. The picture at the top is very decieving. Mine turned out like a crumble and not a cake. I will use it as a topping to ice cream and that about it. I would definely add alot of milk if i was to ever try this recipe again.

I used half applesauce and half oil, splenda for the sugar and half whole wheat and half white flour.  Since I grated the apples, I ended up with almost 4 1/2 cups of apples, but I think that just added to the moistness of the cake.  The cake came out great, even with my little changes.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent, moist cake.  I made this on the weekend and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe as written but baked in bundt pan instead of 9x13.  Sprinkled with icing sugar after cooled.  Very easy and very tasty.

This was very good and so simple to prepare. After reading all the reviews, I did substitute 3/4 c. melted margarine for the oil, and used brown sugar in place of half of the white sugar. I also spiced it up just a bit, with a pinch of nutmeg and cloves. My apples were Red Romes, and they did very well in this. I made a glaze of powdered sugar, milk and vanilla, and just drizzled a criss-cross pattern over the top. I will definitely make this again.                      Update, next day-omigosh, this is even better! It seems even moister and the flavors have blended beautifully.

I love this recipe. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and used raw Turbino sugar instead of white sugar. I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and left the peel on the apples. It was fantastic!

Excellent! Like others, I halved the oil, but used butter instead. I also spiced it up a bit more with fresh ground nutmeg and a tad of cloves and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  YUMMY!

Though mixing the thick batter is physically taxing, it is well worth the effort for this delicious dessert. Using Splenda and Canola oil keeps the fat and calories down and the result still tastes great!

Fantastic--this will become a part of my go-to dessert rotation!  Easy and delicious.  Make it even easier by not peeling apples--saves time, adds nutrition and tastes the same!

Very easy to make!  I made it in two 8 inch round pans and it came out perfect in 35 minutes. I agree with some of the reviewers that you could cut out a bit of the sugar because it's really sweet but it's also great as-is!  I'm also celiac so I used gluten free flour and my hubby said you couldn't taste a difference :)

Thanks to IBNITWIT who suggested NOT peeling the apples!!!  It was a HUGE time saver and the taste is great!  This cake is fabulously moist.  I'm going to take it to the office because I can't possibly eat that much cake in a day or two.  Thanks for this recipe :)

We really like this!  I cut the sugar by 25% and the oil by 1/2, but replaced the missing oil w/ 1/2 C applesauce.  The cake is still very moist and tender, not ridiculously sweet, perfect with a cup of coffee & a great use for all of the apples we picked.

I added 1/4 tsp. allspice, reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, and reduced the oil by 1/4 cup as well. It was thick and chunky, but I didn't add any milk or anything because I trusted that the apples would cook down and make a dense, moist cake. I think you could halve the oil and it would still be awesome. I'll try that next time, because this was delicious - even better the next day! I might add nuts, too, and as someone mentioned, a dusting of powdered sugar would look nice.

I've made this recipe for years but have always made it as squares. I lightly sprinkle the top with cinnamon nad sugar which gives it a crispy top. Make a double batch, your kids will inhale the first one.

Fantastic cake! I took the advice of some others and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup. I also used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar and added milk until it turned into cake batter. And the streusel on top is great! Definitely will make again.

This is a great recipe as is. But I did make some changes, not because it needed it but to suit our personal tastes. I cut the oil in half as others suggested, used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white, increased cinnamon to 3 tsp and added 1 tsp nutmeg. Someone mentioned that the cake gets soggy quickly so to prevent that we left it uncovered - problem solved.  I will make this cake again.

Wow! This is a GOOD cake! I made it for a ladies meeting at church and there was SO many desserts that I feel proud that out of them all, 7 or 8 pieces were taken so plenty of leftovers! HE HE, more for us! After finally dicing up all the apples and putting it in the batter, it reminds you of a caramel apple and when you bake it, it's a baked caramel apple! This recipe deserves for anybody to make it. For any reason.

really good way to use up apples w/ pantry ingredients. i halved the amount of oil, used 3 tsp cinnamon, and left the apple skin on.  half of the batter was poured into an 8x8 and the other half was poured into a loaf pan. one for home and one for the hubs to take to work.  i added 1 c of raisins rolled in flour (had some to use up) to the loaf pan batter. they were both done after 45 mins. after cooling and removing from pans i dusted w/ powdered sugar.

My family loved this.  Used 1/2 c oil, 1/2 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar, and it was still a bit sweet.  Next time I may omit the white sugar. Kept the skins on the apples.  Also added about 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  Baked at 350 for well over an hour.

A good recipe.  I cut the oil down to 3/4 of a cup like the reviews suggested but I found my batter too dry at the end.  Because it was so dry I added some milk until it pulled together nicely.  The cake turned out great and was very tasty.

This is delicious and one of the easiest cakes I've ever made!  I had to make a few slight changes (because I have a tendency to start baking/cooking without checking first if I have all the ingredients...) I used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c non-fat vanilla yogurt and 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar.  The texture was perfect, and the cake was super moist.  I baked mine for 30 minutes exactly.

All in all, it was a tasty cake considering how extremely easy it is to throw together. It also makes your whole house smell wonderful while it's cooking! Everyone really seemed to like this except for me. I guess because I am a "texture" person and I thought it was too mushy. I actually reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and I'm very glad I did! I would make it again sometime and either add more flour or cook it longer than the recipe says too.

This is a great cake. I made some changes, based on some of the reviews: I used only 1.5 cups sugar (would have made half of that brown sugar if I had any), and I used 1/2 cup butter and only 1/4 cup oil. I also added pecans. It's delicious.

I incorporated suggestions from multiple reviewers, and really enjoyed this cake.  Changes: I left the apple peels on, substituted applesauce for half of the oil, replaced half of the flour with whole-wheat pastry flour, reduced sugar to 1.5 cups (using a combination of white and brown sugar), added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  The cake turned out nicely, and after leaving it on the counter in a covered container I liked it even better the next day!  However, even after reducing the sugar I found the cake to be too sweet.  Next time, I'll reduce the sugar even further.

I left out 1 tsp of the cinnamon, otherwise it's too strong, and I added 1/4 cup of oatmeal.  Instead of oil, you can use butter for a nice rich flavor.  I used the suggestion of baking for 20 minutes, then covering the cake with a crumble topping (1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 3 tbsp butter) and baking 15-20 more minutes. YUM!!!

Okay - So I found this today and made it for the Jewish Holiday of Rosh Hashana.  FANTASTIC!  I mean really quite perfect for someone who has no time for anything w/3 kids pulling at my pant legs!  I had all the ingredients. The only thing that was a bit time consuming was dicing the apples, but other than that, it was really  easy. It's "done" when the top has a nice golden-brown to it. I highly recommend it!

Made this recipe again today, and I'm trying not to eat it all by myself!  My modifications were: 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup sugar instead of 2 cups sugar, 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup regular flour instead of 2 cups.  I'm wondering if there's a way to make it with less oil next time.  Wonderful moist cake.

This is the best apple cake ever! My family loves it. I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. I also used 1 egg and 1/2 cup egg substitute, and no one could tell the difference. It's still 5 stars in my book!

This recipe was quick and easy to assemble.  Instead of chopping the apples I shredded them because my son does not like chunks of fruit in cakes.  Also I substituted half the oil with apple sauce to reduce the fat.

This is a delicious cake, especialy made with Vietnamese cinnamon.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, too, which gave it good flavor. However, the proportion of batter to apples seems a bit low---I didn't really get a "pourable" batter.

5 stars with the following modifications (as others suggested): 1/2c oil instead of 1c, 1c white sugar & 1/2c brown (reduces sugar by 1/2c), 2T milk as batter was a bit dry and finally I added 1/2c raisins and an extra Apple because it needed to be used! Yum, I was out of vanilla extract and used equal measurement of maple syrup.  The dough will be very chunky like cookie dough but bakes up perfectly.  The top has a nice crust and the cake is moist.  I did post 3 pics, mixed, going into the oven and the finished cake!

This got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. Made a few changes -- brown sugar instead of white and reduced it to 1 cup because also substituted apple sauce for the oil. Used 1/2 cup oats and 1 1/2 cup flour. Came out amazing!

This cake is super easy to make.  It's very moist & full of chunks of apple.  I only used 1.5 cups of sugar & thought it was plenty.  I served it with homemade whipped cream.  Yum!

Easy as heck. I am a true non cook, and I decided I did not want to throw out another wilty apple (especially the ones the kids leave in their lunch boxes and forget to tell me about).  What a waste, especially since I buy the good organic ones.  So I wanted a simple, easy recipe using basic pantry items to turn those slightly shriveled up apples into something fabulous.  This was great and the result was yummy. I will definitely do this again.  I used olive oil, which was fine.  Next time I might use less sugar.  Thanks for this recipe!  So proud of myself!

This is great!  Instead of 1c oil I used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c dark rum. I also shredded the apples.

As written, this is pretty good. Heavy for a cake though. Definitely need to reduce the oil, and up the spices. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Ginger would be good as well as clove if you like it. I'm making this again this evening, replacing some oil with butter and reducing it overall in the recipe.

You will not be disappointed, although i did bake for 55 mins and I also reduced the white sugar to 3/4 and also added 3/4 light brown sugar i also cut the oil to 1/2 cup as many previous reviews noted.

Yum! I added some cloves, and did half white sugar and half brown sugar. When the cake came out of the oven I poked holes in it and poured caramel ice cream topping all over it. Delicious!

My cake turned out to be perfect. As suggested by other reviewers, I reduced my oil and sugar to 1cup. I added few chopped pieces of figs for flavor. Took 40-45 mins to bake. Loved it!!

I made this when my in-laws were here for a long weekend and they asked me to make a second since we gobbled up the first! After reading other reviews I used 2/3 cup oil and 1cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Yummy!

It's a nice basic cake, but it's not great. I did use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and added a bit more vanilla since I love the taste. But believe the reviews that say it is mushy after a day or so b/c it does get mushy! I froze half of it to avoid an entire wasted cake. Probaly wont make again.

I was trying to find a recipe for an apple cake, and came across this one, boy was I lucky.  It automatically reminded me of my grandmother's recipe that was lost years ago.  I did make some changes like some other reviewers have done, but it was so moist.  My husband just loves it.  It was so moist.  I put confectioner's sugar on it, but it was not needed, as it was very sweet with out the sugar on top.  The changes I made were I only put 1/2 cup of oil in and put 1/2 cup applesauce in. also put one cup of white sugar with 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also added allspice and nutmeg, as we like a spicier cake than some.  It is a keeper in our house, and I WILL make it again.

I just baked this cake and the result was a delicious, aromatic apple cake. Only problem was, my cake was crumbly, and fell apart if taken out of the baking pan. I used 3/4 c oil, 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 c brown sugar, 2 large apples. It could be because I read the recipe incorrectly by having only 1 egg, which is the binder for this whole thing. Regarless of the down fall, this cake is a keeper and I will bake this again, with 2 eggs.

I made it tonight, and I think it needs more flavor.  Maybe mixing the apples in a cinnamon/sugar mixture before adding to the batter?

Used 1 cup brown suger and 1 cup white suger. Only used half the oil and added some 2% milk, just over 1/3 cup. Threw in some toasted nuts since I had them on hand. I used 3-1/2 jazz apples.  It took much longer than 35 minutes to cook, I let it bake 55 minutes but probably could have left it another 5 minutes or so.

This was a really good cake and everyone that tried it loved it. I only gave it a four because the cooking time was way off for me, and it came out really ugly. I made a powdered sugar glaze to cover it up though, and it made it even better.

OMG this is sooo good! Very easy, and I just used one mixing bowl! When I saw the batter, I was afraid that it was going to be dry, but it was very moist! I did, however, lessen the amount of oil to 1/3 cup, the sugar to 1/2 cup and cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.. it came out perfect! :) Thank you!

This cake was really good! Instead of 1 cup oil I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup melted butter. I also reduced the sugar by a little over a 1/4 cup using a mix of brown and white sugar and I think I'll use even less next time.  The middle of the cake didn't cut very smoothly but the rest held together fine. I baked it in a 9 inch round cast iron pan and so the cooking time was longer.

AMAZING!!!!  Even after my attempts at making it a little healthy!!!  I used wholemeal SR flour as well as the baking soda.  I substituted half a cup of applesauce for half a cup of oil and cut out about half a cut of sugar.  Really yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was so very good!.  Good way to use up those apples from the apple orchard this time of year. I cut the recipe in half using the recipe calculator they give you and they dont change the pan size only the ingredients.  I didnt realize that until after I greased and floured the pan but oh well this was still awesome!!

I substituted half the white flour with whole wheat (my secret ingredient), half the white sugar with brown, and half the oil with applesauce. Two good-sized Granny Smiths were the perfect amount. Shared this yummy cake with family, friends and co-workers. It was a big hit! Next time I might try a drizzle of caramel sauce over the top, or maybe add nuts. Any way you try it, it's DELISH!

This cake made the house smell delicious but unfortunately I found it had way too much oil and cinnamon. Most reviewers have suggested cutting back on the oil among other things but I made it exactly as per the recipe's instructions to make for an accurate photograph. I made it for my mum on Mother's Day and hardly anybody went for a second slice like they do for my usual cakes. I guess we are not big fans of cinnamon so I probably won't make this one again.

Well, I was kind of curious about what would happen if I substituted the oil with 1 cup of unsweetened homemade applesauce, and it still turned out SUPER!  It was moist, chewy, sweet...my family loves this cake--and it didn't turn out gooey at all for me!

This recipe is delicious! The cake is very moist and my family LOVED it! It was gone within 2 days! I made a simple glaze to drizzle over top, which added to the subtle sweetness of the cake.

I got this recipe from a friend, only her directions included 1 cup of chopped nuts, and to bake at 350 for 45-60 minutes. The cake is sweet, and I find that adding 1 cup of chopped pecans makes it divine. I also top with a cream cheese frosting of 6 oz. cream cheese, 3 tbsp. melted butter, and 1 - 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. It is simply the best!

I also added milk to this recipe to make it cake consistency. Then I folded in 2 egg whites beaten to stiff peaks with about 1/4 cup of white sugar.  After cooling, it created a gooey topping that just added to the cake's moisture! Sooo tasty!  I also recommend adding less oil and more apples.

Really delicious cake, and SO-O-OOOOOO simple! Made it this evening with the ingredients in the cupboard - didn't have enough apples so substituted one cup of raisins. Also added some mixed spice along with the cinnamon for a bit of added depth of flavour and spiciness. Mmmmm. This went like...well..hot cakes... Thanks Judy.

Just slightly mushy for my taste which is why I will give 4 stars instead of 5...however, easy easy easy, good in a pinch when you have a playdate.  The kids loved it and my husband who is more of the baker of the family was very happy.  I even used brown sugar becuase I didn't realize I was out of regular sugar so I was nervous, but it was very good.  I might even just use the brown sugar again.  It's almost like a fresh version of an instant cake recipe just without all the processed stuff.  Someone had said it was a lot of work, no way.  Just a good electric beater and I even cut the apples and chucked it all in the bowl, mixing time was quick.

This cake is FANTASTIC. I got sick of dicing apples so I decided to do a half recipe but now I regret it because it all disappeared so fast. I added a lot of extra cinnamon because that's just personally how I like it, and it was great. This is going into the recipe box. I LOVE YOU JUDY!!!

This cake was delicious, but it turned to mush overnight even though it was in the fridge.  You said it stores well, I wish you had included how you store it.

This cake is fantastic! I get raves every time I make it. I made a couple minor changes, mostly just to suit my taste, subbing brown sugar for half the white, and adding a little nutmeg.

I  had a can of pineapple and used it instead of apples. I added just a little milk to the batter to where it was more like a cake batter. It turned out amazing.

instead of vanilla i used a splash of red wine, and I had really large apples so 3 would've been fine. I used the juice from all of the apples, though, and they turned out really moist. Also, I always bake in a muffin tin... these baked for 25 minutes

I made it - lovely smell. Not enough batter for pan so moved it to an 8 x 8. It was raw in the middle but the top and sides were good. Reduced sugar to 1 c, reduced oil to 1/2 c. Seemed fine. It. Sprinkled coarse sugar and almonds on top. 
It was a good cake other than not being baked long enough.

I switched the full cup of oil for 1/2 C unsalted butter and 1/2 C oil.  Also exchanged 2 C white sugar to 1 C dark brown, and 1 C white.  I'd already spiced up the cut-up apples with cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/8 C sugar and tossed with cornstarch to help coating the fruit a bit more.  I used a 9" round cake pan lined with parchment paper.  Total bake time was a bit longer, with an unreliable oven, so it took 1 Hr/08 minutes.  I did let it cool overnight before I gave in.  I wound up with a rich, not overly sweet cake with a moist crumb and fabulous flavor. I will make this my "go-to" for apple cake  from this point forward. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this apple cake today. It was easy and came out great. I followed the recipe exactly.  I used Granny Smith apples, which came out great. You don’t want to use sweet apples - tarty apples such as grannies or Macintosh are best in apple cakes. I definitely would make this again!

This was delicious, sweet, and moist! I would give it 5 stars if I hadn't needed to make any changes. My modified version included: No vegetable oil. Instead I used 1/2 cup melted butter (unsalted, or if salted, add less of the salt this recipe calls for. 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. I kept the skin on the apples. And next time, I will use whole wheat flour with baking powder, instead of white flour. Thanks to others who made the suggestions of no oil, butter instead, brown sugar instead of white sugar, and less sugar, etc. Thanks!

My husband loved this cake. I've made it 3 times now. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone moaned with the first bite. The second times, I used a bit less oil and sugar and I liked it consistency better, a bit more cake like, a bit less oily. The third time, I added some raisins, about 1 1/2 cups and it was really good. I think some nuts would be a great addition, but I didn't have any on hand. Next time...

I love the idea of using diced apples in a cake. However, I found that the sugar needed to be cut down by 1/2. I used brown (confectioner's sugar) in place of white sugar. It works wonders with the apples and cinnamon. I also made this as a loaf. For the loaf version (which tends to be narrower and taller), adjust bake time to 45-50 min!

I wanted a smaller cake, so halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan.  As others suggested, I reduced oil and sugar amounts too. I doubled the cinnamon and LEFT PEELS ON the apples.  I found it needed a couple tablespoons of water to make the batter moist.  It was a delicious cake and quick to make.

After reading some reviews, I used 1/4 oil and 1/4 melted better instead of the 1 cup oil in the recipe.  The cake came out great, moist and my family loved it.

Easy to make and moist and delicious. Only modification I made was to add a crumble topping, like you do for apple crisp.

I made this cake this morning and it didn't turn out as I expected.  I wasn't able to slice it--when cut, it was very crumbly and I had to scoop it out with a spoon.  The  batter was thick.  The result tastes good but just not what I was expecting.  Any recommendations?

I made exactly as the recipe.  Recipe says pour into pan but my cake was so thick that I almost had to get help to spread it in the pan.  It smells wonderful and I'm hopeful.

In my opinion this recipe should not be called a cake. Its not a sponge recipes, its more like a bread pudding. I am an experienced cake baker and I should have known better after reading the instructions. 

The taste IS good, although its vary sweet. I tried to make 2 8 inch rounds for my sisters birthday and they were way to crumbly and cooked through, had a strange texture. I wont be using this again.

I'm sure this recipe tastes Amazing as is but I wanted to make something a bit healthier for the kids. I substituted all of the oil for low fat vanilla yogurt (1 cup yogurt) and I cut the sugar in half.   I also substitued 1/4 cup of flour with wheat germ.  It still tastes good and the kids loved it.

This recipe is one of my families favorite. Every where I go with this cake; I 'm asked for the recipe. I started making copies with me before hand so I can just hand them out. It's a moist, delicious comforting desert. It's wonderful. Thank you for sharing the recipe...

followed most of the suggestions, like less oil and sugar, and to add brown sugar and nutmeg,left skin on...i used my favorite honeycrisp apples and am not impressed with this. it is a little flavorless. mine baked in the 9x13 pan and was done at 40 minutes.  not sure what else would make it better, maybe the applesauce and butter suggestions.  at least my hubby likes it, not sure i am making again.

Followed the recipe to a T . . . but unfortunately the cake came out mushy at the bottom and would not come loose from the pan.  I cooled it for half an hour . . . maybe that wasn't enough?  I found the end of the recipe to be vague because it didn't specify whether or not the cake was supposed to remain in the pan and for how long it was supposed to cool.  I'm afraid to try this again.  :-(

Really, I want to give this recipe 4 1/2 stars! Like others suggested, I could have gotten away with cutting some of the sugar and substituting 1/2 the oil with unsweetened applesauce. Definitely do not skimp on the apples; they may look like a lot while you're pouring the batter in the pan, but it's absolutely the right amount when you bring it out of the oven! Partway through I realized I only had about half of what was needed of the flour left in my pantry, so I substituted 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour for the other half. (And it didn't detract from the flavor at all.) Other than that, this is a delicious cake that could star as both dessert and breakfast.

I love this recipe but I do suggest either reducing the oil or replacing it with applesauce. I also like to lightly top the cake with a raspberry sauce at about 5 minutes before the cake is finished. This gives it an extra kick of tart sweetness and keeps the top moist. As it is, I give it 4 stars. With the raspberry topping and oil modifications, my family gives it a 5!

This cake was super good!  Did what others suggested - cut down oil and used 3/4 cup.  I also used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar.  Like many others, I noticed batter is super thick so I did add milk, slowly, until batter was more the consistency of cake batter.  I also added a streusel topping and it was delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

Just made this cake and it turned out delicious! Best apple cake i have ever tried/made. I used 1 cup of organic sugar instead of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and it turned out great :) at the end I topped it off with just a little bit of condensed milk and some side fresh strawberries. yummy :)

First, I'd like to say that I really LOVE this recipe (as does my whole family.) Unfortunately, I cannot five it five stars because I do have to make a change every time I make it. The batter can be extremely thick, more a dough than a batter. I thin it a little with milk to make it less viscous and it turns out just wonderful. Also, I only use 1 1/4 cups of sugar and 2/3 cups of oil. It is really a delicious cake!

This recipe was very quick, versatile & easy to put together. I was a little surprised at the consistency of the batter (perhaps because I substituted brown sugar--the German kind since that's where I live) but the cake was delicious! As someone else suggested: don't bother peeling the apples. I was skeptical but I was running late so I took a chance. It did not affect the texture.  I can't wait to make this again! Thanks for sharing!

Very moist so make sure to bake for full time so it's not undercooked in the middle.  I added 3 tsp cinnamon as well as 2 tsp allspice.  Wonderful.  Don't frost it - that would ruin it!  Thanks for sharing!

Loved it. Though it was a little disconcerting after being mixed up. I loved it, friends at work loved it, and the several missing pieces of the pan when I got home tells me boyfriend loves it too!    I might try it with melted butter instead next time to see if it makes it even better!

Very good apple cake. Every bite has lots of apples. Make sure you cook it for 40 minutes to make sure it's cooked all the way. The cake is super moist and crumbly at the top. This would be great with coffee.

Fantastic! I did substitute a portion of the oil with extra apples, cut down the sugar and left the peels on the apples as other members suggested. The cake stayed moist and was absolutely delicious! Thank you!

Thank you for an excellent recipe! I brought it into work and everyone loved it.   I used about 2/3 cups oil and started getting a bit worried when the mixture looked more like cookie dough, so I added a bit more oil and it turned out great!   I also added raisins and topped it off with crushed hazelnuts. I followed other recommendations to reduce the sugar to 1/2 and added brown sugar. It worked perfectly but I personally think the sugar can be further reduced.  The cooking time was longer than I expected - I had to bake it for an hour, maybe it was just my oven!

This was an easy recipe even though my timing was off and the cake fell. It still tasted delicious and we used it as ice cream topping instead of eating it like a cake. It was gone in one day. YUMMY !

Easy to make and delicious. Great way to use up apples. I used Gala apples and they baked perfect. The cake is very moist, probably because of so much oil. We served this with vanilla ice cream, but I thought it really tasted better on its own.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

as is I have to give only 4 stars with changes it is a 5. Used the suggestions for 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 brown sugar to replace part of the oil and white sugar also added the strusel topping. I had no problem with it getting to mushy. All in all a great cake will make it again - and again i'm sure.

Great recipe -the house smells fabulous!  Followed the slight modifications in other reviews: reduced oil to 1/2 c.; used scant 1 c. white sugar and scant 1 c. loosely packed brown sugar.  Baked in a bundt pan for 45 minutes (but I know my oven bakes fast).  Easy and delicious!

This is by far the BEST fruit-type cake I've ever had! I changed one thing, and that was adding a small amount of brown sugar and cinnamon over the top so that the crust came out a little more crispy than what the original recipe called for! WONDERFUL!

Yum yum yum! This is so good, it reminds me of banana bread but with apples! But then it tastes like apple pie, but as a cake! When you first make the batter you think that there are too many apples but they get smaller as they bake.

This is yummy!  Very moist and full of flavor.  It almost had too many apples in it for my taste though, so next time I may only put in 3 cups.  I added 1/2 cup of hazelnuts and used 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I made them into muffins so will be having them for breakfast!

Very good! I followed the suggestion of others and used 3/4 cup of oil and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. The batter was VERY thick like cookie dough so I added a little milk to thin it out a bit. It turned out very moist and not too sweet. I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. I had to bake it a lot longer than the recipe stated approx 50 minutes. I think next time I'll bake it in a smaller pan because its a rather short cake. Its about the height of brownies. Will definitely make this again!

Really tasty cake, but turned out a little dry. So I added a few tsps of apple juice to the batter. Turned out not bad! Made it a few times already and they all turned out delicious.

This cake does not need frosting! It's a very good autumn dessert that is easy to make and tastes wonderful. I made this tonight for my bible study group and got rave reviews from all! I replaced all of the oil with applesauce and added a pinch of nutmeg, 1 extra tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of ground ginger as suggested by other reviewers. This was wonderful and moist! I will make this again for sure, thanks Judy!

Tasty cake! I followed other reviewers and replaced half the oil with applesauce and cut the sugar to 1 cup. I chopped the unpeeled apples in my food processor. It's best if kept in the fridge. Great item to send in the kids lunch box.

I made this cake on Tuesday night, and it was a moist and tasty treat for the rest of the week! Rave reviews from friends and family. I didn't have enough apples, so I supplemented with some apple sauce instead, which I think contributed towards it being so moist. I ended up baking it for 65 minutes, far longer than the suggested 30 minutes.

Very good!  Husband tried real hard not to ask for a second piece.  I used fresh farm apples. I didn't have any nuts on hand, but will add them the next time i make this.  I will also try some golden raisins too! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was easy enough for my 13 year old to put together and good enough to repeat.  Top with a homemade carmel sauce with whipped creme for a fancy dessert, or dust with powdered sugar for a less sweet, delicious dessert.  A very good recipe, thank you!

Made this for dinner tonight and enjoyed it very much.   Have made similar cakes but think we prefer this one.  After reading other reviews I used 1/2 melted butter rather than all oil and had to cut back on sugar some.  Did not have enough apples so added raisins and next time I think I will also add some halved fresh cranberries.   It has many options.

This is a good recipe. The first time around I used a low fat soy oil. BIG MISTAKE. It came out too mushy and couldn't hold shape. I threw almost the whole cake out it was a complete failure. BUT 2nd time I used 3/4 cup of Canola oil which worked well. I used half white half brown sugar. I also sprinkled some extra cinnamon on top, which was a nice touch. I baked it for 40 mins in a 10X14 (aprox) 1" pan. A little difficult to cut, but delicious and will be happy to offer it to friends.

This cake is great!  I followed other suggestions and did 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown, and also used less oil.  So moist & delicious.

I didnt like this At all. I even reduced the oil due to other reviews and it was still too oily. I put this in a 9" cake pan and I had some extra batter, so I put the rest in to cup cake pans. The cupcakes turned out better because they didnt seem so oily. If you are going to make this I suggest making it as cupcakes rather than a cake.

I made this cake today for the first time and I was not impressed.  The batter was more like "cookie dough" and when I added the apples, it got "sticky".  Also, it took over an hour to get done.  My husband didn't think much of it.  I probably won't make this one again...I will try other recipes though.  I don't give up that easily.

Yummy. Easy to make except for peeling and dicing the apples- but well worth it!

This was moist and delicious! My family really liked it and I felt good about them eating it because I overloaded it with apples and it still turned out great.  My son said it didn't have enough spices so I will try it again with more apple pie spices.

Made this yesterday for a birthday party, everyone loved it!  My daughter (16) had two pieces before I even had the chance to serve everyone.  My two year old nephew would take a bite then say, "good cake! I want more!".  Used other hints and cut down on the oil and used apple sauce and also added struesel topping-this was awesome!!!  Thank you so much!!

outstanding!  Made it with changes suggested. Replaced 1/2 cup of oil with applesauce, replaced 1 cup of the two cups of sugar with brown and added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  My cake was moist and full of flavor.  Be sure to put in a dash of nutmeg and a bit extra cinnamon.

Yummy, yum! I changed the recipe by using 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil for the 1 cup oil and 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the 2 cups white sugar. I also added a crumb topping before baking made of 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup ground flax seed, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. I was able to make 7 mini loaves. One of the best apple cakes I hae ever eaten. For the people complaining of the cake being soggy, DO NOT refrigerate this cake! It will be just fine on the counter for a coupe of days, don't worry!

Lots of compliments!  I did some of the suggested alterations - 3/4 cups of each white and brown sugar and half cup applesauce/ half cup of oil.  We just loved it without any glaze and it stays wonderfully moist.

Wow, this got great reviews from friends and family at Rosh Hashanah.  I left the skin on the apples, reduced the oil, added more milk (we use rice milk), and added the topping suggested by another reviewer.  Fantastic!

Great taste and was easy enough to make.

Only a bit mush, but not as bad as said in some other reviews. 

I'll add another 1/4 cup flour on top of the recipe next time when I make it.

very good cake, but alittle time consuming to peel and dice all the apples.  Even my picky eaters enjoyed this cake.
