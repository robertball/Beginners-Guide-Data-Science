i make different variations of this smoothie all the time and love it. the smoothie is good as written but you can change it up too. a whole scoop of vanilla protein powder, or use different flavors of nuts and more peanut  butter (the salted caramel is my fave :P) chocolate almond milk or coconut milk... it's good stuff.

Another smoothie combination to start my morning, with a strong banana taste and only a hint of coffee and chocolate. I used stevia instead of honey.

When the first thing you say when you take a sip is “ooohhh”, you know it’s a winner! Delicious. I will make this again and again. The coffee adds a nice touch.

Fairly new to breakfast smoothies but this definitely the best one I have had. I added a while scoop of protein rather than 1/3. Easy to make first thing in the morning.
