AWESOME! I don't know what some of the other reviewers were talking about in regards to lack of flavour. I thought the flavour was wonderful.

I have made this recipe with chicken and another time with a mix of large shrimp (1.25 ilb,) and scallops (1 ilb.). I seared those seperately with a little olive oil, salt, and fresh cracked pepper and then added them in at the end. Both versions of this recipe were great.

As for changes to the recipe in general besides what type of protien I used, I could not find roasted Italian cherry peppers, so I substituted an equal amount of sliced roasted red peppers and added 1/2 tsp. crushed red chili flakes. I put the flakes in with the garlic, at the beginning, to bring out their flavour. The 1/2 tsp. was just enough to say 'hey, I'm here, I'm spice, but not too much spice'. If you wanted this dish to have more kick, I'm sure you could use a whole tsp. without overpowering the other flavours. 

Also, the spaghetti sauce I used was President's Choice Marinara sauce. If you're not Canadian, you might not know this brand, but it's a groccery store brand of okay quality. It worked out great.

This recipe is the best!  I put everything (except pasta, of course) in the slow cooker.  When I got home from work the house smelled wonderful and it tasted even better.  My husband, who isn't very fond of chicken ate 2 huge helpings.  Thanks for the great recipe.

this was fast and easy and the taste was fantastic.  I had a roasted garlic spaghetti sauce that I wanted to use - this recipe was perfect.  I couldn't find roasted italian cherry peppers - we put out spicy cherry peppers on the side... but the dish was great even without them!

Okay, I made a mistake and used PICKLED sweet peppers (the kind with vinegar but no sugar added) and I have to say it was AMAZING, quite possibly the best tasting sauce I've ever eaten.  The flavor will be largely affected by your choice of spaghetti sauce so choose a high quality one.  Other than that, I added salt and lots of freshly ground pepper.

Everyone ate this all up!  I cooked the mushrooms (8oz.), onions, and half of the garlic together.  I took note in the reviews that it needed something more flavor wise, so I added kosher salt and thyme to the mushrooms.  I cooked the chicken separately and I didn't bother salting it because the sauce has plenty of sodium in it, but i did add italian seasonings and the rest of the garlic.  Once the chicken browned I combined everything and used a 1/2 cup of red wine and it was perfect.  I didn't have any roasted cherry peppers on hand but will try next time or brown sugar, it was great without it.

This was a very easy and very well accepted meal.  The italian cherry peppers added a great spicy kick to the meal.  This dish would have received five stars if it had a little more flavor.  I felt as if it was missing one key spice for flavor, perhaps some fresh kosher salt.  Lastly, I made this with spaghetti instead of linguini as this was all I had on hand (actually, I forgot to buy it at the store).  My one additional suggestion would be to NOT skimp on your jar of spaghetti sauce and buy a top notch brand.  Afterall, this is where most of our flavor is coming from.

This was so delicious! A friend and I made it together and were very pleased and impressed with the result. It was very spicy (which I liked), but if you aren't too keen on spicy things, I suggest you tone down the Italian Cherry Peppers.

My husband & I both loved this. It's an excellent tasting sauce. All I added was a little salt and pepper. I gave some to a friend and she's taking the recipe to her son in Wisconsin. This is definitely a keeper. Yhank you, Star...

This left my lips burning with 1/2 the cherry peppers!  Next time I'll do this with just some red pepper flakes. Otherwise, very very good. My family doesn't eat mushrooms and onions, so we added a small yellow and green squash instead.  I agree that you should buy a good sauce as that really helps the flavor.

Very tasty..... super quick and easy.  I couldn't find the specific peppers listed at my small town grocery, but used sweet cherry peppers which were still pretty spicy.  Whole family enjoyed this.

Very flavorful and easy to make.  Go lite on the pasta and you have a healthy choice as well.

This is yummy.  We had it over rice instead of the suggested pasta.

This was pretty good. Next time I will use shrimp intead of chicken (Chicken doesn't relly add to the flavor, kinda boring). I couldn't find the cherry peppers, so I used roasted red peppers and spiced it up with crushed red peppers.

I made this on my own, but very close to this recipe! I made it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs, used a fresh red pepper, sliced very thinly, lots of fresh chopped garlic, mushrooms & onions & a can of tomatoes. I didnâ€™t have any wine so I deglazed the Pam with chicken broth! Sooo yummy!!!

We thought this was an easy and fun twist on spaghetti.  We love cherry peppers and loved the bright pop they provided against the depth from the wine and sugar.  Really needs the right spaghetti sauce though because this could get unbalanced very quickly.

Hubby thought it was delicious! Will definitely make again. Roasted my own peppers, and it worked great.

The sauce was good.  Tastes just like spagetti.  I didn't care for the chicken in it.  I think it would be better with hamburger meat.  Unless you were watching your figure, I would not recommetd this recipe to anyone I know.  Sorry.
