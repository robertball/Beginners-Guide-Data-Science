I personally think that these sandwiches have got to be some of my favourite.  However, I got spoiled years a go by a local Vietnamese family restaurant.  I would like to offer a few additions to this basic recipe.  That is, try adding some sliced jalapeno chilies if you like some spiciness.  The local shop also sprinkled some Maggi seasoning sauce.  One thing that has been left off of this recipe that I have never seen NOT included is shredded marinated carrots.  Finally, consider marinating the pork and charbroiling it.  You also might consider pulling out some of the bread inside each sliced half.  I know this sounds a bit wasteful, but it will make it much easier to manage and hold all these ingredients/fillings.

needed the carrots to make it authentic:
thinly slice carrots then add it to a bowl containing a mixture of some rice vinegar with 1 teaspoon sugar. You can also marinate the onions and cucumbers in this mixture as well. Do this part fist, so it can marinate fully while you are assembling the sandwich.

“This is the BEST sandwich I’ve ever eaten!” said my 10 year old daughter. “Hey, even the hot sauce is tasty” said her 9 year old brother as he tore through another huge bite. No leftovers. Clean plates. No dinner conversation. Just lots of crunching and half-closed eyes while hungry people devoured these wonderful sandwiches. While I had been leery of the hot sauce, the lime juice seemed to magically cut it so that it was indeed not too hot for everyone to enjoy, REALY enjoy! This will go on our list of things to serve company in the future. 

We prepared all the ingredients for this recipe and then when the meat was ready had fun assembling our own sandwiches.  I had purchased a boneless pork loin and had the lean end cut into twelve quarter-inch slices that we broiled. We used whole wheat hot dog buns. While the buns were great for the shape of the cucumber slices, I think a whole wheat hamburger or Kaiser type roll would have held up better to the lime juice. They were so delicious though; no one seemed to mind that their sandwiches kept getting soggy with the extra lime juice we kept squeezing on ?

A sandwich with fresh ingredients like this is always good, but this isn't terribly authentic. Missing the pate and fresh jalapeno pepper slices. Also, pickled carrots and onion are usually found in these types of sandwiches.

Yay! I love vietnames sandwiches. I sliced the meat thin and marinated it in a blend of viet sweet chili sauce and viet hot garlic chili sauce. I marinated matchstick carrot and the onion in sugar and vinegar and I added a couple of the veggies they put on at the vietnamese deli's where I live: daikon and sliced jalepenos. We all really enjoyed it - thanks!

Being Vietnamese, there are a few things that are missing if you want something similar the authentic thing as this was not as flavourful as it should be.  As mentioned earlier, the loin chops need to be seasoned, it was too bland for my liking. Pickled carrots and daikon (chinese radish) is a must (julienne carrots and daikon and put in vinegar and sugar to marinate). Also, pate needs to be in there (it may sound gross to some but it's a Viet's replacement for the mayo). Add Maggi seasoning soy sauce as well. Thai chili peppers can be added for more spice as well as chives. Lastly, lightly toast the baguette... it gives it an extra touch.  Happy eating!

We thought this was very tasty. Even my hubby who is suspicious of any Asian food that is NOT classified as Chinese had two! I did toss the cucumber with matchstick carrots in a bowl with seasoned rice vinegar with a bit of sugar and let them 'pickle'a bit while I prepared everything else. The chop slices marinated in the garlic chili sauce for an hour or so. Very juicy and flavorful, thanks for posting this recip

Oh.
My.
Goodness!
I made per the recipe except that I couldn't find the chili sauce with garlic.  I found sweet chili sauce in the Asian section of my grocery and made this for dinner guests.  The flavor combination was delightful and this will be a keeper!  Thank you!

I made this sandwich (with the Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion & Mint salad) for lunch when the in-laws came to visit and it was a huge hit!  We only had 3 butterfly porkchops on hand and that was plenty for four people.  Marinated the meat first in some sweet chili sauce & lime juice before grilling.  Then the hubbie sliced the pork into thin pieces and we layered this with the veggies.  Also added julienned carrots per one reviewers suggestion.  Excellent!

I'm part Vietnamese and growing up I only ate Vietnamese/Chinese food.  This recipe is way different than what I am used to...maybe because all the Vietnamese people I know come from a different part of Asia than the author of this recipe?? LOL  (also, i have never seen them have lime juice or chile sauce with garlic or red onion)  Anyway, this how I've seen it and how I've been eating it for over 20 years...  The example below is for ONE 6-7inch french bread split lengthwise  -slightly Toast the french bread  -2 teaspoon of pate mixed with 1 teaspoon of mayo (no substitute please) -optional: add fresh sliced chili peppers to this mixture (up to you how spicy) -spread on the insides of bread -use Pork "meatloaf" (called "Cha" at the oriental markets.. they also sell these freshly fried! mmm...but I don't get the fried one for this sandwich) -garnish with cucumbers, pickled carrots, sliced jalapenos, and you definitely must have cilantro!  Very simple!  Don't let pate scare you away!

A delicious change from the typical turkey or roast beef sandwich I usually make when time and/or effort is in short supply.  I particularly enjoyed the nice blend of sauces and how they complemented each other.  I'm not a big fan of lime but it gave the sandwich just the right amount of zest.  I was surprised at how the chili sauce did not overwhelm all the other flavors; it looked like it would be really tangy but was not.  The pork was very juicy in the manner cooked.  My favorite herb, cilantro, was a great addition as well.  I'd definitely make this sandwich again but I would give myself a little more time to prepare because "ready in 15 minutes" is tough to do when preparing all the components of this meal.

I'm viet, and the sandwich is very good, you can also thinly spread pate on the sandwich and i know my family puts a few pickled carrots (thin strips) in there too.  Nice.

Very good. I found about 20 different chili sauces in my market and didn't know which one to use. I opted for a Thai red chili garlic sauce. The sweet/spicy flavor was perfect. I think we may try another type of bread with this. It was a little difficult to manage and distracted from the fresh flavors. Maybe a Naan or Pita would be better. Love the flavor combination of the filling. Yum!

This is an outstanding and easy recipe!  The flavors meld together perfectly to create a delicious sandwich.  The only change we made was to use pork tenderloin in place of the boneless pork loin chops.  This is a keeper!

Wow,one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in my life.  I followed the recipe mostly, but I already had  pork roast in the crockpot, so that is what I used for meat.  I did marinate the cucumbers, carrots and onions and cilantro as directed.  The baguette was crunchy and fresh.  The fresh lime juice cut the richness of the pork and I was in heaven.  Thank you so much for something different, will treasure this recipe.

Husband's Verdict: "Refreshing" Did bean spouts in lieu of the red onion, because husband won't eat raw onion.  The bean sprouts gave a little 'snap.'

Husband loves Banh Mi sandwiches, and this is a good, customizable recipe. I make them pretty much as written, but he prefers his without onion and with grated carrot and plenty of fresh jalapeno slices. You can also add radish, beansprouts or shredded cabbage. Don't forget the Sriracha!

Very good. I marinated the cukes with carrots/onions in a dressing of rice wine vinegar, cilantro, and honey. Then mixed the mayo with the chili sauce and assembled. The mixture of crunchy/chewy with spicy/sweet is very good.

Really tasty and very fast, but it was missing something. Added thin sliced pickled jalapenos, and julienne carrots pickled in vinegar and a little bit of salt and sugar. Added some honey and lime to the pork marinade and bf ate three! Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and the sandwiches were ok.  I have had traditional vietnamese sandwiches and they tasted different.  These seemed like they were missing something.

This is the first time I've posted a review on this site. I use the recipes all the time but I have to say this is my hands down favorite.  Everyone in my household dubbed this "The Best Sandwich Ever Eaten."  Loved this. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent and authentic.  If you have it, spread a thin layer of pate on the bread for more authentic flavor.  And an addition of pickled julienned carrots too!

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, my husband who doesn't rate anything at a 5, did so with this one. I don't even really care for cucumber or cilantro but, ohhhh the mixture of them together along with the mayo and lime and chili sauce, my taste buds were shouting for joy. I can't wait to try the carrots with it.

When I told the man that we were having Vietnamese sandwiches for supper, I got a blank stare. Two great big sandwiches later, he gave me the go-ahead to make them again. If I can get him to eat raw red onion, you know it's a keeper. The only change I made was the pan fry the loin chops. I will probably use more mayo and chili sauce next time.

Fantastic!  The tastes all blended together really well.  Next time will use less of the chili sauce but that's personal preference.  Excellent and very fast meal!

I finally made this tonight and it is wonderful!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated some carrot match sticks in rice vinegar and 1 tsp sugar.  My husband loved this sandwich so much that he ate 2 of them.  This is something that he does not do because he is probably one of the pickest men on Earth.  Thank you so much for sharing, we will be making this again.

I marinated onions and cucumber with shredded carrots in rice vinegar and sugar and marinate the pork for half hour before grilling. Really yummy! Grilled the pork on a forman grill. It will be even better in the summer grilled over charcoal.

This was really great! Did't have pork chops the first time I made it, so used chinese simmered chicken from the night before & used marinated jalapenos & carrots (marinaded in vinegar & sugar). DELICIOUS... the jalapenos & carrots really made the sandwich. It was very refreshing, as well as a nice change from the usual sandwich. thanks for sharing!

Wow!  What a great sandwich!  I followed some tips from other readers & I marinated some match stick carrots & also smeared some liver pate on the bun & boy oh boy, it works & tastes perfect!  After just my first try, I think I will add more cilantro (which I love the fresh taste) & maybe get my deli counter to cut me thick slices of pork loin roast instead of me making it in the oven myself.  I recommend everyone to try this at least once.  I hear it's called Banh Mi in Vietnamese restaurants.

This a great use for leftover pork tenderloin.  I always add marinated/pickled carrots and daikon radish and jalapeno slices.

I've made this so many times now, it is one of my favorite dishes!!! I ususally marinate the pork in a mixture of vinegar, olive oil, sherry, sugar and spices then I put it under the broiler. I love Vietnamese food and it is nice to find a recipe that doesn't have a thousand ingredients in it that still tastes good.

We were skeptical, but this was great. I used a small pork tenderloin sliced into medallions and cooked them on the george forman to shorten my cook time. We also used sriracha hot chili sauce. Thanks!

My husband and I liked this a lot.  It was a bit too hot for the kids.  Hubby liked enough to ask for the leftovers for lunch (quite unlike him). I marinated the meat ahead of time in lime and chili sauce and then did not drizzle the sandwich with lime sauce (last step).  Also, based on other reviewers' suggestions, I let the cucumbers, red onion and some matchstick carrots marinate in rice vinegar and sugar while we barbecued the meat.  I used just a bit of dried cilantro instead of fresh since I didn't have it on hand.  The result was very nice.  I'll definitely make it this way again.

This is, without a doubt, a keeper!  My husband and I went crazy over the combination of flavors.  It was simple to prepare as I grilled the pork and brushed it with the chili garlic sauce.  You can control the heat by adding more sauce at any time.  We definitely will make this one again and again.

We were all skeptical of this sandwich by the name, but we were soooo wrong. Delicious!!!!! I did use pork roast sliced, hoagie rolls, and put the garlic and cilantro in the chili sauce before spreading on the meat.

I have never tasted a sandwich like it.  I loved the contrasting flavors of the garlic sauce and lime and the cucumbers and cilantro add a freshness that makes a completely satisfying sandwich.

We love these sandwiches.  I make them all of the time.  They are fantastic just as written, but I sometimes add marinated carrots and jalapenos, because my husband likes hot things.  Easy and great!!!

Easy to make. Could also use leftover pork from a roast, just warm up & add extras.

I have made this several times and always look forward to it. I add carrots to cucumber and onion that have been marinated in lime juice, rice vinegar and a little white sugar and kosher salt. I slice the carrots and cucumber into ribbons with a potato peeler. I also use roasted pork tenderloin which is easy to prepare.

I would make this again; great use of pork chops. Don't skimp on the chili sauce, lime or cilantro on this sandwich, or it will be boring! I did add shredded marinated carrots, which I think added something (shred 1 large carrot, cook 1 minute in microwave, splash with rice vinegar, lime, and a bit of olive oil and water, and let sit while you prepare the sandwich).

We really enjoyed this.  Used bean sprouts instead of the onion, but it was easy to adjust to different preferences of spiciness with the chili sauce.

We loved this recipe!  Great, fun new way to use pork chops.  I followed it almost exactly and thought the flavors were fantastic.  I used sriracha and it worked perfectly.

This was excellent, and super easy.  I used siracha chili sauce and crushed garlic, and rubbed this on the pork before broiling.  The second time I made this I made a salad-version for a picnic (the first was too messy for picnics), which turned out quite good and even faster.  In addition to the pork, cucumber and red onion, I used romaine lettuce and dressed with a mixture of mayonaise, chili sauce, garlic and lime juice, and served with slices of french bread.  Yum.

Followed recipe except for chile sauce - couldn't find any. Found the pork chops to lack flavor - perhaps spice up or marinate prior to broiling. Spread pate on bread as suggested. Overall, good flavor except for pork. Don't know that I'd try this again.

Made this tonight. It was good and the whole family had good things to say about it. I followed the other suggestions of pickling the onion, carrots, and cucumber.  Never pickled before but just followed a simple recipe I found of 1 cup water, 1 cup rice wine vinegar, 3/4 cup sugar and 1 tbls kosher salt.  Heat it up on stove and pour over veggies and let sit for 10 min. I was worried about how this recipe cooked the meat so I did cook it on the grill with the chili sauce on it.  I added more sauce once it was on the sandwich. My son can't have gluten and he loved it even without a roll.

It's good, but it's not a banh mi sandwich. Some of the key ingredients are missing, like the smear of pork pate, the jalepeno pepper, pickled carrots & daikon (radish)-which really make the sandwich more or less--etc. Plus there's a special pate they use that's not like normal pate, and same w/the mayo. Without the pickled veggies, it's just kind of another sub sandwich. The local Vietnamese mom & pop place I always go never puts onions in it, but some places, like Lee's, do, but then again, they're more of an Americanized sandwich chain. Majority of places do not. Even though it's not an authentic banh mi, this is still a good looking submarine sandwich.

This sandwich was AMAZING and SUPER quick and easy to make. It was ready in 10 minutes! 
I admit that I did not measure the ingredients, just tossed them on the sandwich (but did add more cilantro later). My husband preferred his with "lots of lime". He gives it two thumbs as well. We will definitely be making this again and again! :)

Seriously, this is one of the best recipes I've found on this site.  I made a pork loin a couple nights ago and had leftovers, so I used this for the pork.  I didn't use any cilantro and instead of baguette, used slightly-toasted stadium sandwich rolls.  SOOOO good.

I liked this a lot, so I give it a 5, my husband gives it a 4. I made it twice, both times on kaiser rolls. The first time I added some pickled carrots (rice vinegar & sugar to pickle matchstick carrots) & the 2nd time I didn't add any carrots. I husband thought it was better without the carrots. I used dried cilantro instead of fresh. I found the chili sauce with garlic at Safeway. I liked this a lot, will make again. Thanks.

SUPERB!!!  I absolutely loved this recipe.  It was super-quick, easy, and delicious!  I will be making this again in the very near future, for sure.  My only change was omitting the chile sauce; we like spicy food, but the flavors were already so good without the sauce that we didn't feel like we needed to add it.  Thank you so much!!!

I liked this sandwich in that it is different. However, I thought it was kind of on the dry side and boy the sirachi was hot. I even cut the amount in half. With some type of additional dressing and a toasted bun, this would be much better. I did like the idea of using a whole boneless pork chop on the sandwich. Mine took twice as long to broil, but it was still easy to do.

Followed other reviewers advice and added marinated carrots and plenty of lime juice, also added sliced jalapenos, fabulous! Will definitely become a staple when splitting up those family packs of pork loin chops for a weeks worth of dinners... yum!

These are delicious!

*I've made this twice now.  This is what I did the second time...I mixed all of the seasonings the lime juice, and added a little fish sauce, a little light soy sauce and a touch of hoisin sauce in with the mayo and slathered this on the bun.  I also pickled my red onions in some rice wine vinegar.  

Next time, I'm going to use thinly sliced strips of pork and make it as above.

Great recipe. I subbed zucchini for the cucumbers because it's what I had and also topped it off with spicy mayo and siracha. A great recipe! In addition, I added carrots because that's what I'm used to eating in typical Banh Mi sandwiches. For the sauce, I also tossed it with honey + siracha and the lemon juice.

OK. This is how I did it. Used a French baguette, cut off the ends and sliced it in half. On one half, I hollowed it out, and spread liverwurst on it. Then I put a long sliced cucumber on it, topped with thinly sliced pork roast, pickled shredded carrots, cilantro, and thinly sliced jalapeño peppers. I chose not to use the chili paste with garlic, but if you like it a little hotter, go ahead and use it. This is close to how the banh mi shop in my neighborhood makes 'em.

I do not know if this recipe would be 5 stars without what I did however it has all the potential.
Added ingredients: Jalapeno, Carrot, and Soy Sauce
I had thicker pork chops so I pound them out to about 1/4" thick and then marinated them with olive oil, soy sauce (could use any thing you have, salt, pepper and garlic powder. I cut these into strips to fit into the hoagies we had, about 1 1/2" x 3" strips in my case. The pork came out tender and flavorful!
I cut up cucumber, jalapeno, carrot, red onion, and cilantro and mixed with ~2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice and salt and pepper. This sat around while I got the rest going.
I mixed the garlic chili with the mayo so we only had one sauce to deal with but this really didn't change anything. We had the sauce on the table and added it to our liking because it was so good.
Personally, I thought this was better than authentic Vietnamese sandwich stands I've been to which is sad, but we don't love pate, which is usually throws me off when I will eat one.

This recipe was great! I did follow what many of the reviewers said and marinated the pork before broiling. I also added potted meat, which definitely added more depth to the sandwich. Marinating the carrots in vinegar and sugar was also a good addition and a some thinly sliced jalapenos really topped it all off. Will definitely make these again, very fast and easy!

Stove cooked the Pork.  I cooked it in canola oil, onion, and sriracha.  
The Sriracha Sauce and the Cilantro really make the sandwich!!!

This is a VERY good sandwich! I had to add carrots that another reviewer suggested; it was add a teaspoon of sugar to a bowl with rice wine vinegar and let the carrots marinate while you prepare the sandwich. It came out bomb.com it was so good!

Loved this recipe and I don't care if its authentic or not it was fabulous, although my wife (who is Thai) and I could only manage a 1/2 sandwich each so the other half is there for later. Did as others suggested and marinated the carrot and onion also mixed mayonnaise and sweet chili sauce and chili sauce with garlic together. Will definitely make again, just smaller.

I love these sandwiches! I was short on time when I made these so instead of the red onion and cilantro, I got a bad of cabbage and sliced carrots and a large cucumber. I had to broil my pork chops for longer than 10 minutes, about 20 minutes until there was no pink in the center. I then placed each pork chop on the bread, brushed the chili and garlic sauce over it and added the cabbage and carrot mixture and the cucumbers. Everyone loved it and this is one of my go to summer meals since I can make it quicky and is great on a hot day.

This is my go to for an easy tasty meal. My boyfriend loves themI jazy up the mayo by adding freshly minced garlic and lemon juice to it and let it sit for 45-min-1hr, and marinate the pork in olive oil cilantro and lime slices then grill them  I also dont eat meat so i trade the Pork in for a boca spicy chicken patty.

We've made these sandwiches exactly as described several times, and the flavor combination is delicious!  Only variation we've tried is using charcoal grilled, rather than broiled, porkchops and it's excellent too.

I'm usually not big on pork, but these sandwiches are one of my favorites!  They have great flavor and a good kick.  They're yummy if you just follow the recipe, but like others, I enjoy adding some matchstick or shredded carrots that have been marinated in rice vinegar along with the onions.  I like to use bolillo rolls for the bread.  Every time I make these, my husband and I both have seconds.
