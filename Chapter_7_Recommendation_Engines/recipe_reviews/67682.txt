WOW! Great smoothie. I used frozen tropical fruit instead of canned, and a frozen banana. I could drink this every day!

I just love, love, love this!  After seeing the posted picture, I decided to add to each serving glass a sprinkle of ground cinnamon on top, a purple jackmani clemantis bloom & paper umbrella.  Very festive for a refreshing change!

Yum!...What a wonderfully, refreshing and nutritious beverage...especially on a hot day.  Add a muffin, and it makes a great breakfast.

This was a delicious smoothie.  I used a frozen banana and some extra ice to make it a little thicker for our tastes.  My children loved the tropical fruit flavor.  One of our favorites!
