I love, love, love these patties! The only changes I made were, 1) adding about 1/2 cup of chopped onions to the hot oil and rice, and 2) to use a light-flavored olive oil rather than vegetable oil, in keeping with my efforts to make healthier food choices. I didn't have to alter the amount of water, or change the recipe in any other way. Not sure why onions would not be included in the recipe, though. To me, onions are the backbone of flavorful, savory cooking. I love how these patties were not dry or cardboard-like, as so many vegetarian "meat" recipes can be. Thank you for this recipe, SHECOOKS2. It is a keeper! Even my meat-and-potatoes husband liked them.

I cooked this as written minus the cheese.  After 40 minutes the rice/lentils still had a lot of water so I just took the lid off and let it simmer until it thickened up.  My food processor was too small to fit it all in so I just  did the lentils and rice in there and then threw it all in my stand mixer.  That worked fine.  I don't love that they are fried but they are soooo tasty.  What a treat!  I can't wait to try them as "meatballs" or as a lettuce wrap.  I have one in the oven to see how they bake up and it looks good so far.
Update....I have made this several times now...all very tasty.  My favorite way is to freeze them uncooked, individually packaged, and I just thaw them as needed.  I cook them in an iron skillet with a little oil.

Excellent.  I'm not a vegetarian, just a lady lookin' for a recipe to use up some lentils.  I made this as written, with the exception of throwing in about a 1/4 finely diced onion. I made small patties, like sliders. I served them on little buns with mustard & ketchup. I never said a word to my husband about what they "really" were. He loved them.  Still thinks he  was eatin' a burger!

I have made these three times now, and this time I did not put the grains in the food processor as I found the consistency is too much like mashed potatoes.  Tonight, they were great!  When I browned the uncooked rice, I added a medium chopped onion and two chopped stalks of celery along with three cloves of garlic.  I used Lundberg's rice blend of red, brown and wild rice. When the grains were cooked, I simply stirred them into the bread crumb & egg mixture, added 1/2 tsp pepper and 1 TBSP Italian seasoning, and fried the patties in olive oil.  The texture is way better when you don't use a food processor.  Don't mash the grains at all, as they are mushy enough!

I followed the recipe exactly, and I liked what I got, but it wasn't what I thought I was going to get!  the 6 cups of water was way too much for me, I don't think I ever got it quite thick enough.  so when I went to make the patties, I couldn't for the life of me get them to keep their shape, even after cooling completely.  so instead I used my cookie scoop to make about 80 meatless balls... I baked them for 30 minutes at 400 and they were delicious!  the other thing I must have gotten wrong was the processing because these had no semblance of meat texture, and of course they didn't taste like meat, so I don't think I will be able to pass them off as meatballs.  they taste like  mashed potato actually.  but they are really tasty, and my 2 little kids gobbled them up so I can't complain!  I will start with less water next time, and try processing them less to get a better texture.

One of my favorite veggie burger recipes. I froze some and took it with me on my vacation. They might take a while to make but are well worth the effort, thanks for the recipe. Edit: I tried making them into "meatballs" today and they were excellent. This is definitely a staple for me now :)

Absolutely wonderful.  I added some fresh thyme and Tabasco sauce for extra flavour.  I didn't have any Parmesan cheese but added 1 1/2 cups grated tofu for extra protein. I also chilled the mixture in the fridge for 1/2 hour to make it easier to form the patties.

Excellent! The best Vegie Patties EVER!! 
Bake 350F 20 minutes, then flip and bake 20 minutes more.
I make bean patties all the time. They are good fast food. I slip 2 of 'em in a baggie and pop 'em in my purse. They are great right after the gym.

My family loves these patties.  They are addictive!  We make the recipe as listed except we use regular lentils (we can't find red lentils).  This recipe makes a lot, and we heat the leftovers up for snacks and for lunches.  Great texture and nice flavor.

these are pretty good, and hearty for a vegetarian meal. i like them best made with short grain brown rice and brown lentils (cooked in the rice cooker.) i add dried onion and garlic and additional herbs. i also prefer to cook them with a bit less water (broth would be good, too), then the lentils were less mushy and needed less breadcrumbs to hold together. really good with a zesty marinara or puttanesca sauce and melted cheese, parmigiana style.

Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  I only used one egg, Italian seasoning and garlic salt.  Barely any of the cheese.  Fried into a patty.  Served it to my gluten free husband with just the rice, lentils, seasonings and cheese.  He even really liked it!

I'm rating this dish compared to all foods not just veggie patties.  I'm not a connoisseur of veggie patties, but I would guess as far as those go it is probably pretty darn good.  I would recommend these to vegetarians; however, I'd be hesitant to recommend them to others - it didn't wow me.  I followed the recipe as is.  In order to get a really thick consistency as required, it took me significantly longer to cook than directed.  I ended up cooking them on low without the cover at the end.  This recipe makes a lot! It wouldn't all fit in my food processor.  Some of it I just stirred by hand and the consistency was fine.  The patties cooked up nicely (give them some time to cool so they aren't too sticky) by just using cooking spray.  I cooked them on medium-high heat until browned.

definitely better when you cook the origional way that the directions suggest (on a skillet or grill) I tried them in the oven and they weren't as good, but they are phenomenal on the skillet..

These are great! Cheap too! This recipe made dinner for my family of 4 for 3 nights.  I didn't cook the recipe as stated since I had lentils and brown rice in the freezer.  Getting the right texture was not hard.  I also added cooked onion, 1 extra egg, and real garlic.  I fried them and put avocado on top.  They were really moist inside.  My 6 & 9 year olds ATE THESE UP!

The water ratio on this recipe is way off thus the reduced stars.  These remind me more of falafel or a moo shu pancake than an Italian patty.  I cooked 1/2 an onion with the rice as some others did.  I reduced the water to 5 cups and still needed to finish cooking with the lid off to get a drier consistency.  No need to use a food processor as the red lentils and brown rice cooked to a mush.  In addition to the seasonings called for I used seasoned bread crumbs and red pepper flakes.  Using a #30 scoop I made 58 patties.  These will go nicely with an Asian sauce.  I will make these again with my changes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was a wonderful main dish for our meal tonight, a tasty and much healthier alternative to ground beef, which we almost NEVER eat any more.  Such a clean, "meaty" taste and an added benefit of fiber.  My husband even gave it a thumbs up.

The only things I did differently were to add about 1/4 cup diced onion in the skillet while browning the rice, and I used Romano instead of Parmesan, because that's what I had on hand.

After cooking the rice and lentils, I did have to cook down the remaining liquid, as it wasn't as thick as it was supposed to be, but that was no problem at all.

This is a keeper, thank you!

These are delicious.  

However...I have the same issue that another reviewer did, though, in that the end texture is close to mashed potatoes.  I fried the uncooked rice, as directed, then boiled and turned to low, as directed.  When the cooking time was over, the rice and lentils were completely disintegrated, and the mix had the consistency of thin oatmeal.  I cooked it down a little more, then added the crumbs etc. and stuck it in the fridge.  I didn't see any point in using the food processor, as the texture is so fine already.

6 cups of water was WAY too much for the rice. I thought I ruined the recipe but it turned out fine once I turned the heat up high & stirred continuous to let some of the water on top dissolve from the simmering. I then put the rice into a large bowl & then the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to let it cool. I didn't even use the eggs! The burgers stayed together great. Melted some cheese on top & yum!

This is amazing! I'm newly vegetarian and I'm so happy I found this recipe. I couldn't find red lentils so I used normal lentils and used sweet chipotle Panko bread crumbs for a little spice and these are to die for! Thank you for the recipe :)

These were absolutely delicious!  I made them double size for larger buns.  My only problem was that I had too much water, but draining off the excess worked well.  Since the lentils and rice were so wet, I didn't add the eggs.  I reduced the cheese and eliminated the salt to make this low sodium.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks!

This was my first attempt at a vegetarian patty, both making and eating.  I have to say, I was impressed.  I did use Italian bread crumbs, Olive Oil, reg. lentils, and Italian blend of cheese.  It is what I had on hand.  It made an incredible number of patties, which is good.  Extra for the freezer.  Thank you for sharing!

My non-vegetarian friends at work devoured these.  I have used them as an alternative to burgers, served as the meat substitue with mashed potatoes and gravy, and as crispy meatballs.  I was warming one up for my lunch in the kitchen at work and one of the Board of Directors said "what is that, its smells better than our lunch!"  Their catered, fancy lunch no-less.  I make one batch at at a time and flatten them out into patties and freeze them uncooked, that way when I want one I just pull one out and cook it up.

Thank you for a great recipe! I cut the recipe in half but still used 2 eggs. I also used a very generous half of the spices, and just a small amount of cheese. I did not have an issue with too much liquid, however, I did cook the rice and lentils on low for a VERY long time. After cooking for this amount of time I saw no need to use the food processor, so I skipped that step. I added one small chopped onion to my sauté pan when I was browning the rice. I washed the pan while the finished lentil/rice mixture cooled, and used the same pan with a small amount of oil to brown the patties. I topped the patties with our favorite arribita sauce and put them in the oven while I made penne pasta and creamed spinach to serve with them.  After adding a little shredded mozzarella at the end, we enjoyed a great veggie parm dinner!

I've made this a few times, and really like it.  What I like most about the recipe is that it's very versatile.  The first time I made it as directed.  I've since made it with black beans, red beans, and a 15 bean mix.  I used a cup of oatmeal one time when I ran out of bread crumbs.  I have to be very careful not to over process the mix, otherwise it gets too gummy and you lose the texture of the beans.  I've also found that 6 cups is too much water.  5 works just fine.  This recipe is time consuming, so I make a double batch and keep them in the freezer.

Pretty delicious recipe, exactly what I want in a lentil burger. 

Only a couple qualms--
Like many others said, 6 c of liquid is WAY too much.  Recommended ratio for lentils:H2O is 1c:2c and for brown rice it is about the same so with 2.25 c of rice/lentils, 5 would be ample and you could probably get away with about 4 and add a bit during cooking if necessary.

I also did not really process the beans and lentils just because I prefer a more 'chunky' burger but they would certainly be delicious if they were processed like in the recipe!

Other than that it looks really good!  Forms together well which is sometimes a big issue for burgers like this.  I added a few other spices like some smokes paprika and a bit of hamburger spice packet just because that's how I prefer burgers of any type to taste, but these are tasty enough without!


These are INCREDIBLY cheap and easy to make and combining rice with lentils gives all essential amino acids so this is just as good as a hamburger or chicken burger in terms of macros/nutrients!  Good thing to think about if you can't afford meat!

Like others I used onions, real garlic and a variety of spices. Yum! Going to be eating these regularly from here on out.

Found them very thick and a bit sticky so they were hard to make into patties. Put lump in fry pan & cooked until i got a crust then flipped and could spread with the edge of the spatula outwards. Repeated a few times and got lovely patties no no goop on the hands.  Tasty and texture great.  Can't wait to experiment with other spices and a bit of hot sauce and......well you get the idea.

I made this vegan, without egg or cheese. I'm sure the cheese adds a heap of flavor that was lacking in these, but they were still okay. I'm wondering if red lentils are really the way to go - my rice and lentils cooked fine, but were totally mush. I had taken the lid off after 25 minutes so all the water would be absorbed/evaporated by the end, which it was. The recipe says to process this mixture. There was nothing to process - it was mush. So I'm wondering if brown or green lentils were used in the original recipe. Those wouldn't disintegrate like red lentils. Overall the texture was similar to baked potato, which wasn't what I was hoping for. I might try this again with barley and brown lentils, which stay intact when cooked. I'll also need to compensate for the lack of cheese, possibly lack of egg if my lentils and barley come out like I expect. Also I followed another reviewer's advice and baked at 350 for 40 minutes - I made 10 dozen small meatballs with a melon scoop. So much better and cheaper than the frozen meatless meatballs at the store!

just made this last night and though it took longer than 40 minutes (because the rice alone cooks for at least 40 minutes) I am extremely happy with the results! delicious and I will use this recipe as a backbone for many other flavorful patties :-)

I was really surprised how good these tasted, given the ingredients.  I used a 17 bean and lentil mix, simply because it's what I had on hand.   I also used Italian Seasoning instead of the basil (personal preference).  Worked great.  They are very flavorful and firm.  They taste great alone, or on a sandwich.  They also taste good hot or cold.  I did read one review where she said the texture was like mashed potatoes.  I did notice that the ones that were more well done on the outside had a firmer, meatier texture on the inside.  So I think you have to make sure they're fully cooked through to get the firmer texture.  It is a little labor intensive, but I think most veggie burger recipes are.  Hubby and kids came back for seconds!

Love this recipe. I can go most days without eating meat. My carnivore husband actually ate these and didn't give me any grief about the taste. I used 5 cups of water instead of the 6, which seemed to be just right. I will be making these again. I can think of many neat variations I'd like to try.

I have to eat dairy and gluten free so adapted the recipe a little.  I fried some onion with the rice, used one clove of fresh garlic, and substituted the cheese and breadcrumbs for 3 cups of crushed Rice Chex.  I also added a little fresh parsley.  I blended about 2/3 of the ingredients but left 1/3 of the rice/lentils unblended to add texture.  There was a lot of water in the rice/lentil mix so I left the lid off for the last 15 mins of cooking.  The texture and consistency were perfect.  I chose to bake the patties in the oven rather than frying them.

This recipe works like a charm, I used regular lentils and forgot to put the rice, egg and lentils in the food processor together and it still worked nicely. Thank You Shecooks2!

These are some of the best vegetarian 'meat' patties I have tried to date (well, patties that don't include gluten anyway).  My husband did the skillet-heat-'em-up part of the cooking, and he did not have the patience to cook them through as one reviewer suggested *sigh*. I enjoyed these fine alongside a pasta and tomato dish, and enjoy them quite a bit in wraps (and that's a good thing, cuz these made a bunch!).  Depending on how the rest of these freeze, and how much they change on the inside when left on a slower griddle for a longer time when I get around to cooking the rest of the batch, I might make some of these up again, keeping some in the freezer for myself. However, these are a bit of work, and I'm fine with plain beans.  Plus, my family is still not sold on "meat substitutes."  They can deal with meatless meals, and that's saying something, since my husband used to require gobs of ham in his own bowl of pinto beans.  Now, as long as there are some nice sides the the beans, he thinks of brown bean supper as a very nice meal, guest-friendly even (think fried potatoes, cornbread, salsa verde, and something akin to fried okra, oh, slaw as well).  Missing one or two of those sides, and brown beans, even without meat, are still a VERY user friendly meal to him today.  However, 'meat substitute' is what he thinks when he hears 'bean cake', and maybe that's why the bean cakes never translate over for him.

BUT THESE ARE GOOD ALL THE SAME.

Delicious!  A little difficult to handle before frying but worth the effort.  I separate the patties with waxed paper then freeze.  I like to reheat and cover with salsa to eat for lunch or eat in a bun like a hamburger for dinner.

I'll be honest I am giving this a three because maybe I made this recipe wrong, but I didn't like it at all. I disliked it enough that after a couple bites I threw the whole thing out. The only thing I did different was halved the recipe and added some pepper. I was so sure I would like it because I love rice. I don't know what happened.

Made these last night and they were great! I actually made some into “meat balls” to have a vegetarian spaghetti an meatball dish.  I tried to “fry” them in my air fryer, but found they didn’t really get the nice colour I was looking for so I switched to a little oil in a pan and way way better.  Don’t skip the frying in the pan, that is what makes these meatless meatballs / patties so great.

I thought these were okay. The flavour was good but the texture was a bit mushy for my liking. I might try with short-grain brown rice next time and brown lentils as I think they'll keep their form a bit better. I have celiac so I made these gluten free by subbing the bread crumbs with 2/3 C. GF breadcrumbs, 2/3 C. oat flour, 2/3 C. rolled oats. I also diced and sautéed an onion and used chicken stock instead of water. I'll try them again with the different kinds of lentils and rice and see if that helps with the texture.

Great base recipe, thank you. Like everyone else I changed the recipe to suit my needs. I used quinoa, ground oats and skipped the Parmesan cheese. The eggs aren’t really necessary. I like to sauté vegetables, whatever I have really, and add them to the mix. I agree with another reviewer who said they don’t need to go in the food processer (the texture is better without). This recipe makes a lot of burgers and they freeze and re-heat really well.

OMG. I wasted all that time in the kitchen. I made this recipe exactly as it said. Measured everything perfectly. It looks like baby diarrhea. When making it into patties it sticks so bad to your hands. It's so messy. I couldn't get it to cook all the way through. I realize because of what it's made of it should be a little moist I'm assuming, but the inside wasn't cooking at all despite making the patties thin or trying. Again, you can barely form patties it's so sticky. Also, make sure the food processor you have is big industrial size otherwise all of this isn't going to fit. I had to just throw it all away. I was supposed to have dinner on the table by 7pm. By 7:30 I threw in the towel and ordered pizza. I'm so mad right now. I have so many dishes to clean now and all for nothing. :(
