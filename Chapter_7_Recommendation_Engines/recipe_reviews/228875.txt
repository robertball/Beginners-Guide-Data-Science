I have made this a handful of times and it's always been a big hit. I do make a few adjustments though; first I pre-cook the bacon until it's about half done, I don't like mushy sprouts and that's what you get in order for the bacon to crisp up. Next I pour the bacon, any grease from the pre-cooking, the syrup, sprouts and s&p in a bowl and mix it all up, then I add just enough olive oil to coat usually only a couple of tablespoons is needed. I definitely line my baking sheet with foil because the syrup really gets sticky and I cook at 400 for only about 20 minutes. These small adjustments make it perfect every single time.

We love brussel sprouts but I had some issues with this recipe.  First of all the 40 minutes at 400 degrees is WAY to long.  You end up burning the syrup.  Next time I will half them and they should be done in about 15 minutes (the minimum time I think you need for the bacon to cook)  I took mine out way before the 40 minutes and they where  whole and they were cooked through to tender.  I would also just put the olive oil to coat maybe several tablespoons 1/4 of a cup is a lot especially with the bacon rendering out fat.  Make sure you line your pan with foil or you will need a jack knife to clean your pan.  I would be willing to try this again with these modifications.

My brussels hating husband has requested these again and I did not even have bacon! Soak sprouts in salted water for 1/2 hour first. And line the pan with foil. Possible cut down on the oil too if bacon is fatty.

I have made this several times. Great the way it is written and easy to change up.  I now cook my bacon until it is halfway cooked and slice the brussels in half, just a preference for us, cuts the cooking time down.  I use the fat from the bacon and some olive oil to just coat, but not 1/4 C.  The bacon makes more fat while it continues to cook.  I add garlic and walnuts.  Thank you for sharing.  BTW, my husband hated brussels...not anymore!

These are like candy! I added a couple of tablespoons of oil and a couple tablespoons of maple syrup with salt and pepper into a zipper bag.  Boiled the Brussels sprouts in salted water for five minutes, cooled and then halved them. (That makes them more tender.) Tossed them in the bag with the oil, syrup, and seasonings to coat.  Spread them out on a sheet lined with foil. I didn't add bacon. They took almost 45 minutes.  So yummy!

Trimmed off bottoms and cut sprouts in half lengthwise. Tossed all ingredients together in bowl (loosely measured ingredients) to coat, then spread out in stoneware baking dish. Baked till sprouts were browned all over and tender, and bacon crisp. Teenage kids loved it. Not a drop leftover.

375, folks ... at 400, mine were already black on the bottom after 10 minutes. Turn the temp down and they're nicely browned/carmelized and tasty, with the bacon bits crispy and the whole thing yummy!

I've made this several times after eating something like it at a restaurant one night.  A couple of variations are interesting.  Tossing in either some chopped walnuts/pine nuts and/or craisins.  Or good just the way it's written.

Amazing. I never had brussel sprouts before, heard to many horror stories of how bad they tasted. I knew I could find a good recipe here, and boy was i right. These were awesome. They are now a regular on my side dish rotation. The only change I made was that I used half olive oil and half Hazelnut oil. MMMMmmmmmmmmm.

Love this recipe.  I use less oil, half the sprouts and cook for about 20 min at 400.  Perfect!

Fantastic! I made this just as directed and it was loved by everyone; even those who after eating every last bit of their second or third helping, still insist that they do not like Brussels Sprouts.

Made this recipe tonight for dinner.  First time I have ever made Brussels Sprouts, second time I have ever eaten them.  Recipe was easy and turned out very well.  I mixed the oil, maple syrup, salt and pepper before tossing the brussels sprouts.  The rest of my dinner wasn't done in time and the out leaves burned, so make sure you don't over cook them!  My mother-in-law (not a big fan of brussels sprouts) even liked them.

These are fabulous and I will defiantly make again.  Like a lot of the other reviews I did slightly alter the recipe.  I cooked the bacon before and decreased the olive oil to a couple tbls and used the bacon grease.  I also added onions, because I love onions and cut the brussel sprouts in half length wise. I decreased the cooking time by about 10 mins set the temp to 375° instead is 400°.  Try them, you defiantly won't be disappointed.

The first time I cooked this I followed the recipe.   Everyone loved it.  I made note that next time I'd need to cook it for 5 less mins.  Just cooked it a second time and since I'm trying to lose weight, I modified it a bit.   Used only 2T olive oil and 2 packets of stevia instead of the yummy maple syrup.   It was still really good!!   Let's be honest,  nearly everything tastes great with bacon anyway.   :)

YUMMY!  Tastes exactly like a restaurant near us.  I pre baked the bacon for about 10 mins at 400, then reduced oven to 375.  Tossed bacon, 3 tablespoons each of pure maple syrup and olive oil with the sprouts that I have previously halved.  Spread on same cookie sheet and roasted for 40 minutes.  WOW!  Thanks for the recipe!

Holy cow this is delicious!! I cut my Brussels sprouts in half and added cut-up carrots. I also added more bacon just because. I didn't measure the olive oil but drizzled it and the maple syrup very conservatively. I added freshly ground sea salt and pepper to taste. Put on some plastic gloves and mixed it all together. I baked it at 400 for at least an hour, possibly more, stirring it all once about half-way thru. Some may consider my version over-done but I like it like that.  Some of the Brussels sprout leaves were so incredibly crunchy like potato chips! My 11-yr-old asked me to make this once a week!

Due to other reviewers mentioning issues with burned syrup and over cooked sprouts, I made this recipe by sauteing the brussels sprouts in olive oil and used real bacon bits from Costco added to the  pan. Then I reduced the maple syrup by boiling it down so it coated the sprouts when added later in the cooking process. They turned out great.

I followed other reviews and pre-cooked the bacon in my cast iron skillet. Instead of olive oil, I used the bacon grease and mixed with the maple syrup. I cooked at 400 for 20-25 minutes and it turned out perfect. I used a glass oven safe Pyrex dish and lined with foil, but it wasn't necessary. The glaze wasn't as thick and syrup-y as I thought it would be. Still delicious yet subtle! Easy recipe to make!

Loved it but agree with the other reviews - cook the bacon first to crisp it up and replace most of the olive oil with the bacon grease.

cooked at 375 for 30 minutes and turned out great. I would use less oil next time since the fat from the bacon creates grease too. It made enough for two adults.

I love this! My 8-year-old begs for more! : )  I usually add onions because I love them so much and am generous with the syrup. It's even good without the bacon! - an option for vegetarians or those wanting to be heart-healthy.

This was every bit as good as it sounds! I cut the oil down to 2 tbs and tossed the sprouts in the oil/syrup mix rather than pour it on. Saves a few more calories! But they roasted up beautifully and had an amazing flavor. I did soak mine in salted water one hour prior to cooking them, as a few reviewers and other websites suggest. They we're much less bitter than the few times I've had them before. Not sure if it was the brining process or what.

We have made these again since their arrival for Christmas Dinner. So yummy. The maple caramelization pairs nicely with nutty char of the little green sprouts.  We used cayenne instead of pepper to give it hint of spicy at the end of the bite.

Shared it with my office mate and was surprised that it was not as sweet as she expected it to be. She asked for the recipe to make for her family and friends.

For starters you have to like the taste of Brussel sprouts; my wife does not but the others in the family do (thank you democracy!) It is easy to cook with some latitude in cooking time.  If you love bacon, you will appreciate this bacon friendly dish.

The basic recipe was good,but changed it several ways. I cut the sprouts in half, half cooked the bacon, and cut back on the oil. Mixed everything together and placed in a foil lined baking sheet. Drizzled renaming sauce over and put in oven. Now the timing.  I used an electric convection roast setting at 375°. 20 mins max,  perfectly roasted.

I made this for the first time today and it was a huge hit. I mixed all the ingredients in a bowl first then placed them on a cookie sheet. I added in green beans as well. I found the cooking time seemed excessive and they seemed ready after about 25 minutes so I took them out. The brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked .

I loved this.  I have a couple of maple syrup bottles in my cupboard and didn't really know what to do with them.  I love brussel sprouts and bacon so I made this and it was great! Only 4 starts because the instructions says to cook for 45 mins, when in fact it took me only 23 mins and by that time things were starting to seriously burn due to the maple syrup.

Definitely a repeat recipe, and one I’ll serve to friends. I’d like to echo the remarks about being overdone at 400 for 40 minutes. The bacon was inedible, but the flavor and sprouts were wonderful. Always a good reason to try on my wife first! I used Nueskes thick cut bacon, the fat rendered out and kept the sugar from burning. Next time I’ll try either reducing the heat to 375, and/or cooking until the bacon is done, the sprouts should be done by then also.

This is a requested side dish at my house . I did cut back on the salt. The amount of time this cooks is very dependent on the size and the freshness of the Brussel Sprout . Check them 10 minutes earlier than you want them better to sit in a covered bowl than to burn.

I haven't liked Brussels Sprouts until recently.  I'd had Brussels sprouts with bacon a few months ago, but the difference with this recipe is the maple syrup.  I really didn't taste the maple flavor, but the syrup added just enough sweetness that I enjoyed the Brussels sprouts a lot and will use this recipe next time I make them.

WOW!!! I will be making this Often! Everyone raved and went back for more. Even good cold from the fridge! Like others, I cut the sprouts in half and drizzled only a few tablespoons of oil to coat them. I partially cooked the bacon and cut the baking time in half. This dish is 5-star restaurant-worthy even though it's a cinch to put together! Thank you!

Great flavor, but too much fat (oil) as written. As others have suggested, I precooked the bacon and drizzled the fat along with the bacon with no additional olive oil. It came out great. Next time, I will skip the drizzle of bacon fat and just let the bacon continue to render as it roasts.

My guys loved this dish.  I cooked the bacon half way through before I added it to the brussels sprouts.

I made the recipe yesterday for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit.  More than one person said that these were the best brussel sprouts they've  ever eaten.  Many requests for the recipe. I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I was asked to bring this every Thanksgiving.

This was the first time I have ever had brussel sprouts. And I love them!!!  Here are the changes I made however...
I didn't use olive oil. 
I did use maple bacon, no syrup. 
I halved them ( only the big ones, I kept the small ones whole.).
I only cooked them for about 15 minutes, because I can't stand mushy veggies. 
I will be making this again!

The only thing I did differently was that I added about 1.5 tsp of balsamic vinegar and omitted the salt.  It was amazing served with steamed kale and grilled salmon in a garlic butter sauce.

Sprouts came out tender but not as sweet as I had hoped.  The bacon came out burnt and everything was way too greasy between amount of olive oil recipe calls for and bacon fat.  I will try this again but will cut olive oil by half, add a little more maple syrup and cook for less time (maybe 35-40 mins).

This dish received rave reviews! I did make a couple of changes, though. I made a smaller batch, in an 8x8 with 3/4 of a pound of sprouts, stems removed and halved. I used 6 pieces of bacon, baked on their own at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, then chopped and added to the sprouts. I only used 3T of olive oil and the same amount of real maple syrup. I cooked the dish at 375 degrees for 40 minutes and it was perfect!!!

We loved it. We followed another reviewers advice and half cooked the bacon but did not use the bacon fat. Tossed in a bowl with the syrup, bacon, pepper and enough oil to coat. Roasted 20 mins turning halfway through and it was delicious!

The sprouts burned, unfortunately. I think it was the combo of the olive oil and maple syrup. I usually use butter vs. olive oil. I think maybe I would cook as I normal do and add everything else at the end.

Yum! I don't know exactly how much brussel sprouts I had but I think it was about 1 lb. I only used about 1/8 cup oil and half the salt, pepper and maple syrup. I cooked it for exactly as called for and it came out delicious.

This  was wonderful!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions.  I cut the brussel sprouts in half, partially pre-cooked the bacon and I used bacon grease in place of some of the olive oil.  This was seriously awesome and I will be making it again for sure.

This is an amazing recipe just as written, but it also lends itself to substitutions.  I've added diced butternut squash, and sliced apples which adds some color and sweetness.  I don't care for bacon so I've left that out or served it on the side.  It's the perfect, no fail side dish for a houseful of company.

Made these for just me tonight, and didn’t really measure. I halved 6 large Brussels Sprouts, and tossed them in a bowl with some EVOO, 4 pieces of cooked bacon, a handful of Craisins, a sprinkling of Lawry’s Seasoned Pepper, and then drizzled maple syrup over all. Transferred them to a foil lined pie pan and cooked them a total of 25 minutes at 375. They were absolutely perfect!

After reading several reviews, I precooked my bacon half-way and parboiled my sprouts before cutting them.  They never crisped up and were mushy - I was so disappointed.  My friends said my mistake was parboiling them - so DON"T DO IT!!  I will try this again someday without that step!

This is the best brussels sprouts recipe I have ever tasted.  Everyone at the Christmas table agreed with the assessment. I used thick-cut pepper bacon and cut my sprouts in half. They carmelized really well.

Do not roast  at 400 deg! I’ve done 375 for 40 mins and 350 for 40 mins. All of our other holiday casseroles needed 350. When cooking at 350 for 40 mins, turn off the heat and leave in oven for about ten minutes. And then they are perfect. I’ve never had so many compliments and recipe requests as I do making this for guests and family.

My husband didn't think he liked brussels sprouts until I made this recipe. I only had frozen brussels sprouts so I microwaved them for a few minutes before mixing with the oil and syrup. It only took about 25 minutes to bake this dish in the oven after that.

The seasoning is great, however I like my bacon crisp and my brussel sprouts charred a bit.  We had to leave them in longer in order to achieve this and the brussel sprouts were a bit mushy for our taste.  Next time we will partially pre-cook the bacon and then halve the brussel sprouts and throw them in with the maple syrup for 1/2 the time.

Wonderful recipe !    I could eat it every day of the week.   I did halve the sprouts and also partially sauted & drained the bacon pieces prior to baking in the oven with the sprouts,  didn’t want to have the whole dish soaked in bacon grease,  much healthier to use olive oil instead.   I also added a bit more maple syrup towards the end to make sure there was a fresh coating on top of the sprouts.   Wonderful wonderful wonderful.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit, even with my pick y mother-in-law. Doubled the recipe for 2 lbs. of sprouts and followed the the tips to pre-cook the bacon and only add enough olive oil to coat. Flavor was perfect. (Hint: add as much bacon as suits you - I added 12 strips to mine.) My husband requested that I only cook brussesl sprouts this way from now on.

Easy recipe. I diced my brussel sprouts in 1/4's. Microwaved my bacon and dumped the bacon drippings in with the oil and maple syrup. Turned out great in about 1/2 hour bake.

I don't really like green vegetables except for green beans and Brussel Sprouts were at the bottom of the list for sure. I am trying to change my eating habits and this recipe will certainly do that. I have made it twice now. The first time I couldn't eat it because the maple sugar burned to make it inedible. That's an easy fix, add the maple syrup in the last ten minutes. The Brussel Sprouts were still a little black, so next time (and there will be a next time) I will cut back a little on the cooking time. That could just be my oven though.

This was AMAZING!  I did follow some of the recommendations, partially cooked the bacon, did not add any olive oil (used the bacon grease), and just a bit of garlic powder.  Would have been even better with the suggested walnuts!

Made this based on the Once Upon a Chef recipe - Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Bacon, Pecans and Maple Syrup. Additional items included tossing them in maple syrup and balsamic vinegar, then coating in chopped roasted pecans.

Made according to recipe but halved the sprouts.  Delicious with smoked turkey!  Different way to make brussel sprouts.  Will make again but shorten cooking time as the sprouts were mushy maybe because I halved them?

Cannot begin to tell you how much I LOVE these Brussels sprouts! I’ve made these at least 5 times now. Much better with fresh than frozen, of course. I added a little extra bacon because... bacon. And I may have purposefully added a tablespoon or two of bacon grease into the mix after just wanting that extra deliciousness. So amazing! I make 2 lbs of sprouts for just my husband and I and we have to force ourselves to leave sone leftovers to take for lunch the next day. Roasted chicken and a salad and it’s a fall favorite.

We loved the flavour of the Brussels sprouts and I would gladly make them again. I halved the maple syrup (that was a big mistake!!). I par-cooked the bacon in the oven on parchment (400F, 15mins), and then used the same parchment to roast the sprouts. We had a lot of larger sprouts that didn't quite cook enough, even though we cut them in half before roasting. I only wished they crisped up like in other reviews. Thank you this is a great base recipe, I recommend trying it!

Tasted great, but I couldn’t detect the maple syrup at all with the other strong flavors, so I will omit that next time to reduce sugar.  (I probably didn’t use as much as the recipe called for, since there was so much else going on.) Thanks!

so good! I read through some reviews and decided to half cook the bacon. I then spread it over the cut in half Brussel sprouts with the drippings. I didn't use oil. then I drizzled maple syrup over them 
I like the crispier so I found the temp and time accurate. you do want to watch them as every oven is different

Following other suggestions, I cooked the bacon 3/4ths done in the microwave before adding it to the second 15-minute roasting. That suited me perfectly as it ended up nice and crisp. Also instead of cutting the sprouts in half, I found a couple of packages where the sprouts were uniformly small. This made it even quicker and easier.

Didn't have bacon so skipped that, took others advice and cut cooking time in half (400 degrees for 20 minutes) on foil lined baking sheet. Added a few cloves finely diced garlic (we love garlic).  These were delicious, sweet but not too sweet, just amazing!  My husband who declared he doesn't like Brussel sprouts, kept going back for more!  This will definitely be added to our veggie rotation!

I stopped cooking at 30 minutes but the brussels sprouts were already mush. This was to have been my side-dish tonight but although the flavors are good, the texture is disgusting. Editors: PLEASE update your cooking time.

Fantastic! I used a bag of 16oz frozen brussels and molasses instead of Maple at 350 degrees (because I had a chicken baking at the same time) for an hour wasn't crispy, but delish just the same. I do agree with other reviews that  1/4 c of olive oil is a bit too much.

Much better than another brussel sprouts recipe I tried recently. My wife and I liked the slight sweetness from the maple syrup and bacon makes anything better.  Not yet a fan of brussel sprouts but with recipes like this they're growing on me. Slice them in 1/2 to get better coverage of oil syrup and spices. Also they'll cook a bit faster 30-35 minutes.

The general idea is amazing.. I steamed the sprouts for 10 minutes first.  next time I'll mix everything in a bowl first to provide greater coverage.

It was an easy to prep and cook recipe and the taste was delicious. I reduced the maple syrup by one tablespoon and premixed it with the olive oil before adding to the sprouts. I cooked it a tad longer than the instructions because I like some char on the outside but a soft inside for the sprouts. They are a bit oily due to the oil and bacon so next time I will use half the recipe’s call for bacon.

These were the favourite appetizer at our girls night. 15 women with good taste loved the brussels. I will make these often.

The bacon did not crisp like I thought it would, so I cooked longer.. then the sprouts were a little overcooked. I would precook bacon some if I make again.

I made it twice so far. After the first time, I made a couple of minor changes, and it came out even better. So much so, that even my adult children and their friends really liked it. The changes were: cutting whole sprouts in half, placing the ingredients in a bowl and mixing in the olive oil, maple syrup, etc., and, I added 3 gloves garlic diced. After placing on the foiled cookie sheet, I then sprinkled on the bacon and baked for 38 minutes. Great green vegetable dish that's easy to prepare. BPM

I used more bacon than called for ;) and fried it a bit before adding it to the Brussels sprouts. I used Canadian seasoning salt and and pepper to taste. I used 2 Tablespoons of Olive oil rather than 1/4 Cup. I ended up putting the pan on the top rack of the oven for the last 45 minutes of cooking the Turkey. And the temperature was set at only 350 F. I thought they turned out really good. I felt I could have added a slight bit more Maple syrup though but  it didn't really matter. I loved this recipe.

Very good- i looked at comments and precooked bacon enough to render some fat but not cooked allthe way. Timing will depend on sizeof sprouts,i halved mine and it took about 25 min to get a good roast on them with them being soft. Overall a good recipe. Made for Christmas and there were no leftovers!

An excellent recipe that has people who thought they didn’t like brussel sprouts eating them!  Line your pan with foil, or you’ll be scrubbing for a while.  We use already (mostly) cooked bacon in the recipe, so it crisps up during this cooking.  I like the caramelization of the maple syrup on the sprouts, and it will do that if you leave them in the whole time.  Some people here are calling it “burning” but it is a caramelization, so adjust your cooking time accordingly.  We also mix the sprouts and syrup and toss them in a bowl rather than drizzling, it ensures they all get coated.  Enjoy!  This is a keeper!!

This was absolutely delicious! I froze my garden Brussels Sprouts in 2 cup servings (approx 1/2 pound) so I halved the recipe and didn't have bacon but had leftover grilled brats (I used 2) so cut them up and mixed them in halfway thru the baking time.

I altered a little bit...I halved the sprouts cooked for about 20 min at 400.  They were a little mushy,  Next time trying a lower temp. I used pre-cooked real bacon bits.  I also put them under the broiler for 3 minutes to crisp them.   They were very good!

I love this recipe. I make it 1-2 times a month. My boyfriend looks forward to this side dish every time. I have made it with pure maple syrup and with sugar free syrup. I added a little swerve to sweeten to make it more Keto friendly. It isn't as sweet as using pure maple syrup, but they still hit the spot.

The only change I made as stated by others, is I used the bacon grease instead of olive oil to drizzle over the b.s. and par cooked my bacon which completed cooking this dish in 20 mins! Delicious recipe! Thank you!

I made this exactly as written except doubled the recipe.  I don't think I would've needed to quite double the  "sauce" topping. I had no issues with anything sticking and cleanup of my baking dish was a breeze, I would imagine because of the amount of oil in the recipe.  It was a hit at our extended family Thanksgiving celebration and will make it again.

Roasted Brussels sprouts are nature's candy. Add bacon and maple syrup and there's no way this can miss. Not a healthy way to prepare veggies, but at least you get the plant fiber and nutrients.

This was really easy and delicious but 40 minutes at 400 degrees is way to long!! I needed half the time. The syrup was burnt but luckily my boyfriend liked the crispy burnt pieces, me not so much. Next time I will do everything the same just cook it less.

I love Brussels sprouts and am always looking for an interesting recipe for them.  This is one! YUM!  I did take the suggestions of tossing all in a bowl first and baking at 350.
You can never go wrong adding more bacon, as mine were crispy before the sprouts were done and obviously, they shrivel.   After 20 min., remove pan, stir and replace for another 20 min. OR until done.  All ovens work differently. Just keep on eye on what your're cooking!

I cut down the oil (mixed oil, syrup, halved sprouts in bowl, first). Put bacon pieces on top and roasted for 30 min. Might precook bacon a bit so it is crunchy.  Definitely foil line pan.

Modified recipe:  cooked bacon until almost done prior to adding that brussel sprouts.  Added bacon grease + 1 T olive oil instead of 1/4 c olive oil.  Cut brussel sprouts in half.  Cook time decreased to 20-25 minutes.

I’m still not a fan of brussel sprouts. I will say, however, the maple sugar and bacon was quit the treat and definitely helped the sprouts go down better.  LoL!  One of these days, I will find a recipe that makes brussel sprouts more palatable to me.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. I halved the brussels sprouts , and like others, used just a drizzle of olive oil, the 3 Tbls. of maple syrup and roasted them for about 35 min. I'll definitely make them again and include a handful of pecans. Oh and I did pre-cook the bacon until it was slightly crisp

oh my gosh, this was so good! my father in law said it was the best brussel sprouts he ever had. I lined the pan with non stick foil, definitely a good idea with all the sticky. could have baked a little less, but other than that, turned out perfect. a keeper.

Two stars just because after 33 minutes my bacon and loose pieces of Brussel sprouts were burnt to a crisp!  The only change I made since I don't use foil is parchment paper.  My oven isn't the problem because all other times and temps work fine on whatever I am baking or roasting.  I would give it 5 stars based on flavor alone based on the three bites that weren't so burnt and I will make this again with temp adjustments.  Just be aware that it is up to you to check what you are baking and not just leave it to the timer!!!!!!

I modified the original recipe. I cooked 1/4 pound of bacon in a cast iron skillet. I then sliced the brussels sprouts after cutting off the end about 3-4 times and put them in a bowl. I put EVOO over the sprouts and mixed. I took the bacon out of the pan and drained off all but 2 TBS of the bacon fat. I then tossed the sprouts in the bacon fat and 3 TBS butter then cooked them for about 2-3 minutes on the stove top. I added the Maple Syrup and a drizzle of honey. Mixed well and then put the skillet in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes. It was delicious but a bit different. I do thank the author of this original recipe for the inspiration to my final product.

Very easy and very tasty!  I'd recommend less oil.  Using the amount the recipe calls for, and then the fat from the bacon and the liquid from the maple syrup, made it hard to brown the outside of the sprouts.  When I made it the 2nd time I used half the amount of oil and achieved the caramelizing that the photo shows.  I will definitely be making this dish a lot.

This was an easy and very tasty way to cook brussels sprouts! I liked the slight sweetness of the maple and the saltiness of the bacon. I loved it, although my other family members who did not previously like brussels sprouts were not very impressed. Also, I cooked my sprouts for 20 minutes, and they were done. I tossed them twice during that time, I agree with other reviews that 40 degrees is too long.

This is the absolute BEST way to make Brussels Sprouts that the whole family will love.  I used the best Quebec maple syrup and Canadian bacon.  The sprouts this year we’re a bit big, so I quartered them; soaked in salt water for an hour before baking.  I added some red bell pepper strips for color.  Cooked until blackened.  Amazing!  It’s vegetarian candy.

Made these yesterday for Christmas as my annual "something different" side dish. I had a large group and so I doubled the recipe and did 2 lbs of Sprouts (Sam's club had a convenient bag of them) I followed the recipe and used some thick cut bacon slices that I cut into the 1/2" pieces and sprinkled over the halved sprouts.  They caramelized beautifully and the bacon crisped up very nice. There was hardly any leftovers. I bet sprouts will be included in future meals.

Well, when everyone at the table eats Brussels Sprouts, you know you've hit a home run.
Don't rely wholly on the time in the directions..... as the saying goes, "Ovens Vary".  Mine came out a little more caramelized than I really like, but they were still good.  Start watching your sprouts in the last 10 minutes pull them out when you hit the desired color and texture.

These were excellent but as another reviewer mentioned the bacon takes longer to cook than the Brussels, so precook the bacon half way prior to roasting the whole shebang. We had these with our Christmas dinner and everyone thought they were amazing. I was really pleased with them!

I precooked the bacon to cut down on the amount of oil.  Other than that, I just watch carefully to keep from burning.

The flavor was OK, but lacked a real maple flavor.   Next time, I will cook the brussel sprouts about 30 min. and reserve a bit of maple syrup to drizzle at the end.

OMG my family & I couldn't get enough of these Brussel Sprouts.  Next time I will double the recipe.  Simply delicious.  I put everything in a Ziploc and shook it really well to coat then placed in a dish and baked.  Warning:  Highly addictive!

4 stars bc I had to reduce the cooking time like someone else suggested.  I also used way less o.oil-not1/4 cup.  I just drizzled the sprouts.  It tasted great and I'll make it again.   Ate it with rice.  p.s I added green beans bc I was short on the sprouts and it worked.

This is simply scrumptious.  I made almost two pounds of sprouts thinking I could eat them for lunch the next day.  They were devoured in one meal.  My husband said they were so good, it was mealtime magic!

I love brussels sprouts with bacon. Frying them was a new method of cooking them. They turned out fantastic! The sweet with the salty was a great combo. I followed the recipe exactly. I will make these again!

I made 6lbs for Easter expecting there to be some leftovers. Nope. None. Everyone loved it.

I baked on convection, so I turned it down 25 degrees and cooked it for about 35 minutes instead. It's easy to burn the smaller pieces and it doesn't taste good charred, it gets bitter, so I advise watching these closely at the end of the baking time.

Made  using a bag of frozen Brussel sprouts that  I wanted to use up and some frozen pearl onions, both thawed and drained.  The bag of Brussel sprouts was only 12 oz so I made up the difference with the onions to equal a lb.

 I took other reviewer's suggestions to pre cook my bacon until it was about halfway done.  It  was perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing!  It's great just like it is.

This recipe was excellent and enjoyed by my entire family.  I did cut down the olive oil to just a drizzle, though, because I felt the bacon would release enough fat while cooking.  I had these in a 350 oven for a while because of something else I was cooking at the time, and brought the temp up to 400 after I removed the other item.  I took them out when they were tender and nicely caramelized.  Great taste!

This was good, but a little overwhelmed by the maple syrup.  I think it would be better to cook the bacon separately and stir it in at the end, as it was more greasy and sweet vs. savory and sweet.

I do NOT like most vegetables, and I would not normally eat brussels sprouts, but these were  good. What's not to love about bacon and maple syrup? It wasn't super sweet, either. Just a touch sweet and savory to counteract the bitterness of the sprouts.

Made this dish for our St. Patrick's Day dinner and it was devoured by self-proclaimed brussel sprouts haters!  Made minor adjustments based on other reviews.  I let the sprouts hang out in boiling, salted water for 5 minutes, then halved them. Parcooked the bacon with a sliced shallot and used the rendered bacon juice (! - ahhhh) in lieu of olive oil.  Three tbls of maple syrup.  Roasted at 400 F for about 25 minutes.

Its a basic bacon and brussel sprout recipe, but the added ingredient of maple syrup adds another layer of flavor to the recipe. Make sure you stir more times than half way through as the added sugar of the maple syrup will  lend itself to burning the sprouts  quicker.  My hubby actually enjoyed the leftovers of the dish  more the next day. Easy and delicious side dish!!!

Made it with garlic salt once and it was great but the original recipe is wonderful just as is.  I'm not sure if that's cranberries or raisins in the picture but it doesn't need anything else...though I may try that next time out of curiosity.

I made this recipe tonight 2/23/2017. this was my first time making any Brussel sprouts.  and my 2 and 1 year Olds loved them. so did my husband.  I made it with some fish and it complimented each other perfectly.  definitely will be making it again. I also decreased the oil to 3 tablespoons.  and added 1 green pepper and 2 small onions.

Really great flavor, but cooking time us too long.  Brussel sprouts were over cooked and mushy. Will try again, but cut tine in half.

I made this dish for Christmas Eve. I hosted about 10 people and they all loved it. For whatever reason, I forgot to add the maple syrup. I bought regular bacon and added it in the brussels sprouts.

I made it with a few of the others' recommendations. I halved the sprouts and I cooked the bacon about half-way. I also used all 3T of maple syrup and then just enough EVOO to cover everything. I cooked it about 10 minutes, then stirred, then 10 more minutes. Definitely do not need any more time than that (may do less next time). You will definitely want to lay down aluminum foil. I might try my silpat next time, but have never used that with something so sticky. The sprouts and bacon tasted like candy! So very delicious.

I agree with some of the other reviewers.  The temperature and timing don't jive.  I'd cook them on 400 for about 20-25 minutes.  And in all honesty, I'd have liked a bit more maple flavor in mine.  I'd make it as directed then add a bit more syrup at the end so it's got a more distinct flavor.

1 hour in the oven is way too long and 1/4 cup oil is also way to much. However, they were delicious.

I listed to some of the other reviewers and pre-cooked the bacon half way.  Nice side dish..  The sweet of the brussels sprouts with syrup was a wonderful compliment to the other side dish of jalapeño cornbread casserole.

Overall, I enjoyed this recipe, but, I agree with others that 45 minutes is way too long. Also, I fried the bacon part way first and added the bacon drippings over the mixture in the pan.  I got many complements from people who don't normally like brussel sprouts.

The recipe as listed calls for too much olive oil.  reduce about about 35% and you should be okay. 

Also, I made this in a EZ foil and it came out well with minimal clean up.

We really liked this! I used less olive oil& only 2 tbsp of syrup. I also used bacon bits& stirred them in at the table. Due to calories. Great but they took less time-about 25 to 35 minutes.

I made this  as a take along. I will need to make again. It was just ok for me. A great nutty flavor but did not notice any sweetness from the maple syrup?  They did get over cooked a bit due to the hostess put in hot oven instead of warm oven until serving time. I used fresh sprouts from the stalks. They looked pretty when I arrived but after the hot warm up they all shrunk.

I have never been a brussel sprout fan, but my husband loves them. I do love roasted vegetables so decided to give this recipe a try. How can you go wrong with bacon in it??  My hubby loved them and so did I. The flavors are brought out in a crisp and delicious crunch. I will definitely do this again and can now add brussel sprouts to the shopping list.

This was good! My husband said they were the best Brussels sprouts he's ever had. I ended up turning on the broiler for a minute or two because I found the crispy crunchy pieces were the best. Will make again with a few adjustments. Definitely does not need 45 minutes unless you like them really soft inside.

My husband and I both really love this dish - good sweet and savory flavor from the bacon to compliment the slightly bitter flavor of the brussels sprouts.  Baking also makes the brussels sprouts very well cooked.

Great Recipe!  Made an infamous vegetable enjoyable.  Had a recipe very similar to this at a restaurant known for its brussel sprouts.  This one did to disappoint.

This recipe is simple and delicious.  I mean DELICIOUS.  I am a lifelong brussel sprouts lover, but my husband of 20 years has always hated them and refused to eat them....until he smelled this cooking.  He now calls me at work to ask if I can bring home brussel sprouts to cook for dinner.

Did as others suggested and half cooked the bacon, then used the grease and maybe 1Tbsp of evoo, omitted salt. Lined cookie sheet with foil and mixed everything in a bowl before dumping on the pan. Cooked 20-25 minutes.  Everyone loved it. Definitely produces soft sprouts, not al dente or crispy as some roasted sprouts recipes call for, but it was very tasty. Nice flavor of sweet and salty. And if you have people who don't like the taste of sprouts, don't worry...their flavor barely comes through!

Great recipe, great dish!Ifollowed the advice of others and cooked the bacon about half way.  cooked on stone ware.  Next time I'll cook a little longer to get more carmelized brussell sprouts.

this was an excellent recipe. I did make a couple changes. I used a half lb bacon, cooked till slightly crisp and I boiled the Brussel sprouts for about 10 minutes before baking. Baked for 35 minutes. tasted delicious.

My first try at cooking brussel sprouts...easy and delicious.  I did halve these and mix them with all of the ingredients in a blow before I laid them out on the pan.  Agreed with others to put foil down.

I do not love brussel sprouts in general - but LOVED this.  Everyone loved them - except my mother who prefers her brussel sprouts boiled to death.   I will definitely make these again.

I grew up HATING brussel sprouts.  I had them for the first time, again, a few months back while on a business trip in Chicago.  I was intrigued because these were NOTHING like the ones I grew up hating.  I have found that I can even get my son to enjoy them.  But then again, isn't everything with bacon better?  this recipe is easy, quick to throw together and has a nice blend of sweet, bitterness from the brussel sprouts and smokey from the bacon.  nice mix and balance.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year. It was a huge hit for the whole extended family. I even got a request for it this year again. I've made it a few times in the last year. Very yummy.

I saw the recipe this morning and had to try it. We bought a pound of sprouts and 4 slices of very thick bacon. After we ate all of it, we wished that we had double the amount and no other food what-so-ever. All three of us LOVED it. Can't wait to have it again!

These were really good but I used fresh ones and it took a lot longer to cook them, plus as much as I tried to the sizes weren't uniform so some cooked at different rates.  I'll try them again using frozen ones!
