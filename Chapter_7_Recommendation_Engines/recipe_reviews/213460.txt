This was really, really good! My Sicilian boyfriend approved. I used minced garlic, and a little extra since we both love garlic. There was a lot of extra oil and bread crumbs, though, so I might suggest reducing the amount to maybe half.

Used thick cut boneless ribeye's and was great! You don't need as much bread crumbs & cheese as called for. Use about half. I will use this recipe again.

This would have to be one of my new favorite recipes.  I made this for my husband because he is half sicilian, so I thought this would be kind of cool to try for him.  It is so easy to make and is absolutely delish!

I tried this and it was good.  I would have rated it higher, but it tasted a lot like Shake N Bake just not as quick.

I am of Sicilian decent and I grew up with this dish.  You should use a thin rib eye for this recipe.  Any thicker, and it is a waste of good meat.  You just need to coat the steak in olive oil and seasoned bread crumbs and bake.  The trick is to cook on 400 for only 15 minutes, so that the inside is still somewhat pink.  If it over cooks, it will be less tasty and a little tough.  A great quick recipe that is simple to prepare.   I know it is good because my Neapolitan husband likes it!

flavor was fantastic and so very easy to make, but recipe amounts seem really off!  after reading reviews, decided to use 1/2 c each of seasoned bread crumbs and cheese - probably could have went to 1/3 cup each as still had left overs!  also, just poured about teaspoon or so of (garlic flavored) olive oil on each piece of steak and then rubbed on all sides - was plenty.  baked at 400 degrees until reached desired doneness on instant read thermometer.  can't imagine using a rib eye or t-bone, seems like a waste of a good cut of meat that should be grilled - used 4 beef tenderloin steaks about  1.5"+ each.  everyone LOVED the flavor and they we SO TENDER.  only disappointment is that I was thinking the outside breading would be a bit crispy, which it was not at all.  will definitely be making this again!

I kind of disagree with those who swear you need a great cut of meat. You definitely don't want something tough, but my wife and I don't see how you would want a ribeye or a bone-in steak for this meal as you can't really see what you are eating after it has been breaded. We used a flat sirloin and trimmed the outer layer of fat. We then sauteed some mushrooms, red peppers and onions and put those over the steak. We followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was very good and very easy to make.

I added one tablespoon onion powder and substituted the salt with adobo. This is my husband's favorite. He asks me to make it for every special occasion. Not to mention my kids love it too!

Great flavor! I was trying to recreate the flavor from a favorite restaurant thatâ€™s no longer around. This recipe did not disappoint! Combined with a side dish of Italian green beans using the same breading, polenta, and a salad, it was a great meal!

The recipe submitter stated that any good cut of steak could be used and beef is SO high right now that I had to use what was on sale which was ribeye. This turned out fantastic! It did look a little more like a pork chop but the taste was delicious. Mine was so tender that it was basically falling apart on the grill. Yes, I used the grill instead of the oven but that is the only change I made. I will definitely make this again!
