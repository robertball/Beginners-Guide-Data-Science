This was delicious!! I didn't have mushrooms so I left that out, and added some chopped onion in with the spinach. I used half a bag of spinach and one can of "italian" diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic added to it. I also used 1/2 the vinegar called for since I used half of almost everything else. I will be making this again!!

Made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it!  Didn't have fresh spinach so used frozen and that worked just fine.  This dish may be a bit too tangy for some, but you could easily reduce the vinegars.  We loved it just the way it is.

Loved this recipe! My husband doesn't like tangy so I replaced the red wine vinegar with white wine. I also used orzo since I ran out of spaghetti and it was delicious! Definitely keeping this as one of my staples!

Easy, quick dinner that everyone enjoyed.  I did add onions and sauteed with mushrooms.  I did not add fresh spinach until I added diced tomatoes.  I used pitted kalamata olives rather than black olives

It was delicious!  A bit too tangy though... any suggestions on reducing that would be appreciated.

What a great tasting and healthy spaghetti dish. My husband just raved about it and said I can make this one again anytime. I did change a couple things, I replaced the red wine vinegar with red wine, but still used the balsamic vinegar. I also cooked a bit differently letting the sauce simmer without the spinach for about 20 minutes. I then added the fresh spinach into the sauce right before my noodles were done, just basically stirred it into the simmering sauce until well wilted, this way we could really taste the full robust flavor of the spinach. I like the tartness the balsamic vinegar gives the sauce, but glad I used the red wine or it might have been too tart for my taste. The feta was a great topping for this dish, but hubs insisted on Parmesan cheese on his, I took a taste of his and like the feta much better. Thanks hokiemom for a new dish for our meatless Mondays...this one is a keeper in our house.

Used a bit less balsamic vinegar.  I think next time I will use even less.  It was pretty good.  Thinking about preparing this Italian based.

I made this as written, except I made the whole pound of spaghetti instead of just half. I thought that there was too much liquid in the saucepan for just half a pound, but I was wrong. Half a pound would have been fine. However, the vinegars would most likely have overwhelmed the dish with just a half pound of pasta. The whole pound seemed to dilute it enough to where it could be tasted but not overwhelm. Overall a good recipe.

This is soooo good! and easy and use what other veggies you have in the fridge!  Could just be because I love feta?

This was great, I stayed to the recipe exactly except for adding tofu for some protein. I was a little concerned it would be too tangy with the vinegars but my husband and I thought it was wonderful. Will definitely add this one to the rotation.

This did not turn out when I made it. The boiling vinegar turned my fresh spinach into a disgusting paste and overpowered the other flavors in the dish. I ended up with a nausea-inducing, vinegar-flavored mush to put over my spaghetti noodles, and I had to order pizza for supper. Maybe some of the substitutions suggested in the comments would help make this dish better, but I never plan on making it again after how the basic recipe turned out.
