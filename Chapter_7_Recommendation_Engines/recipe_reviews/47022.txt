I have been using this recipe site for a couple of years now, but this is the first time I have ever submitted a review.  I read the other reviews and decided to give this recipe a try since my family loves fried rice.  After making this dish, I must say, it is AWESOME!!!  I have no idea why some of the reviews said it was bland.  All I can figure out was that they did not make it correctly.  Everyone in my family thought this was a very tasty dish.  I'm glad I read the reviews and remembered to use COLD rice that had been in the refridgerator over night.  I can't wait to try this recipe again with chicken....hmmmmm, or maybe even mini shrimp.....yummy!!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe Glo!  I will be making this on a regular basis.

Unless your feeding a group of training sumo wrestlers, I'd cut this recipe in half. I had four hungry mouths to feed and there are still plenty of leftovers (which is ok to me!). I made 3 changes: First, I scrambled the eggs in a seperate dish rather than do it in the leftover sausage grease. Second, I added just a splash of oil to the grease (to make sure there was enough) and when heated, I added the cabbage & then the cold rice (why must it be cold? I don't know). Finally, when the rice was slightly browned, I added a pkg of frozen (thawed) broccoli stir fry veggies instead of chopping my own, which has brocoli, onions, mushrooms, red peppers and water chesnuts. Once adding the eggs/soy sauce, this is a pretty dish and VERY filling. Would repeat this recipe again! Thanks Gloria!

I never thought I would be making my own fried rice.  This recipe caused quite a problem for me.  My family loves fried rice and I used to order it at least twice a month from a local restaurant.  Since I have started making this recipe my family no longer wants me to order it from the restaurant.  This is the BEST fried rice we have ever eaten hands down.  It has such a great blend of flavors and is also fun to experiement with by adding or substituting ingredients.  Thank you so much for this recipe Gloria.

My Kids really liked this. I used boil in a bag rice so that I could rinse it in cold water to make the rice cold quicker. I also left out the sprouts(Kids don't like)I did use other suggestion and added broccoli florets(thawed)I used a big wok and put the cabbage in the sausage grease and added some oil. at the end I made a well in the wok and put in 4 beaten eggs and let it cook for a minute and then mixed the egg in. My kids liked it and they won't usually eat cabbage.

This recipe makes SO much rice!  I ate it for days and it just got better.  Maybe I will half the recipe next time since it's only me and my boyfriend, but I will make this again.  I did add some cilantro to the eggs, and some oyster sauce, it added an excellent flavor!

I like this fried rice a lot and it is super easy to make if you buy coleslaw mix and shredded carrots.  It is one of my go-to meals for an easy dinner.

This fried rice dish was wonderful.  Easy to prepare and delicious.  My whole family just loved it.  It did make a lot but the leftovers were just as good as the first day.  We all really liked the sausage added to it.  Very good - would definitely make again!

This was fantastic. My partner and I both loved it and we have very different tastes. Things I changed: I skipped the peas, I used turkey sausage crumbles, and used a "red" rice that I had leftover.

Next time I might try sautéing some garlic along with the cabbage at the beginning, chopping the carrots smaller (or leaving them out), and maybe making the sausage a little spicier with black or cayenne pepper. 

We will definitely be making this again.

I more than halved this recipe and used Chinese Sausage as my ground pork sausage. Served it as a side with a chicken stir fry. Very yummy, kids loved it.

I made this as a side dish,,therefore, I omitted the sausage.  But it was wonderful..great advice on chilling the rice and cooking the egg separately.  Also, I didn't have cabbage, so I ommitted it.  Thats the great thing about fried rice, add whatever you have on hand.  Next time I'll add the sausage, I'm sure it will be even more amazing.  Thanks!

Fantastic, I didn't think cooked cabbage would be good but it was. I found this recipe looking for a way to use up leftover pork loin. Just one question: why would anyone discard pork fat and replace it with oil?

I used to make this all the time, I forgot about it but found it the other day browsing my recipe box for something different.  One major time saver:  Use a package of cole slaw shredded cabbage with carrots.  It works just as well and saves the skinned knuckles!

I've made this recipe many times, and it always turns out great!  I use frozen peas & carrots, and once didn't have bean spouts, but it is always very tasty.  I omit the green onions (don't care for them) and use low sodium soy sauce.  Always a hit when I take it to potluck dinners.

I can't believe my kids ate three servings of this!  I was skeptical of the pork sausage but it added a wonderful flavor.  I just used 1 cup of uncooked rice and 1 carrot which was plenty.  It did lake a lot more effort than I was hoping for.

Made this for dinner tonight but had to customize it to my households healthy pantry. I basically cut the recipe in half. Substituted 1/2 pound Jalapeño Chicken Sausage from Trader Joes for the standard pork sausage. Traded out: 6 cups of white rice for 2 cups of Quinoa, cabbage for spinach, canned bean sprouts for fresh green beans, onions for 2 gloves minced garlic, vegetable oil for EVOO and finished with crushed red peppers instead of green onions. It is very filling and very easy to make, just wish I would have not cut down the recipe so that I would have a yummy and nutritious lunch for the next few days.

I cut recipe in half, used cold brown rice, 2 eggs, 1 T. olive oil, no cabbage or bean sprouts (didn't have either), and added about 1/2 C frozen corn along with peas.  I cooked sausage in a pan, then used my wok for the rest of the cooking.  I waited until after adding the rice, then pushed mixture to the side and cooked the scrambled eggs in the wok.  This came out great and cannot wait until I get some cabbage to add to it, I don't think that I will add bean sprouts though, just a personal preference.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Even my picky husband (never eats a stir fry) tried it and really liked it. **UPDATE...I finally got the cabbage to try this with, and let me tell you it makes the difference.  I have made this several times using different vegetables, but I always have to use cabbage.  Thanks again.

I used this recipe as a guide for my own tastes. Used shrimp and thinly sliced pork loin with a few slices of small dice Canadian bacon. Added cumin seeds sauteed in oil and mushrooms and fresh cilantro at the end. Also used brown rice instead of white. Very good! Wished I had oyster sauce as I read somewhere it really makes the dish.

Definately a keeper!!! My teenager LOVED it, the hubby ate 2 huge servings and the girls, well the 7 yr old liked it and the almost 6 yr old turned her nose up at it..but that's just her! This was really good and easy. Be sure to follow the directions and cool the rice down before using it...I know another reviewer was wondering why...it makes the rice not mushy while frying.

I will add some ginger and garlic the next time to give it some more flavor. I laughed when I saw someone review it as bland as they omitted the sausage...hello, that gives it more flavor :)

Definately a keeper...thanks Gloria!!!

This was fantastic!  All five of us loved it.  My brother asked for the recipe because he doesn't want to order fried rice ever again and my teen daughters asked if we could make this from now on instead of ordering fried rice.  I thought we'd have left overs to bring for lunch, but no such luck.  For those who complained about it being bland...I agree with others who have said if you leave the sausage out you must use more seasonings to take it's place.

It's a keeper. I bought cheap sausage which was a mistake, otherwise I killed it. I used sesame oil and a spoonful of chili sauce. Splash in some rice vinegar with the soy. Brown rice after a day of rest and give the onions credit.

This is fried rice the way it was meant to be!  I mean, most recipes I see use freshly cooked rice that is added to the frying pan while still hot.  No, No, a thousand times No!  You must start with  previously cooked, cold rice to get the best, tastiest, most traditional fried rice!  This recipe has earned my eternal respect.  Thank you!

Sorry, I found this recipe to be neither good OR easy/quick to make.  I didn't like the beansprouts; they tasted much like they did right out of the can.  I added all amounts of salt, pepper, and garlic powder and it helped a little.  I didn't even start to add the bag of frozen peas and carrots to it.  But I'm really ticked because this was advertised as easy and quick, which it was neither.  I also dirtied up all kinds of bowls, skillets, plates, etc.  Spent the better part of my short night putting this together.  The recipe was way too much for my skillet, which I thought was a large.  Made a huge mess of the stovetop too.  Not a repeat here.

This was very tasty.  I had some ground pork to use up and thought I would try this recipe.  Sure glad I did!!!  This makes a LOT of fried rice.

This recipe is great - and a LOT.  I will cut it in half next time.  Hubby loves it too.  He didn't want it when I told him what we were having but once tasted he ate it happily.

Was great even though I omitted the cabbage. I also used brown rice instead of white. This will be my new recipe for fried rice.

I made this for Father's Day and the family loved it! It was a huge amount of rice and I found that we didn't have a skillet large enough for all of it. I was going to cut it in half, but boy am I glad I didn't! We ate it all. I ended up putting as much rice as the skillet could hold in and it still turned out fantastic. Thanks!

This is amazing.  Didn't have t o change a thing.  It makes a LOT, so it's great when you have a lot of people to feed.  I was skeptical of the sausage when I first read it, but it was AMAZING.  I have made this at least 5 times and everyone always loves it!  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this a few times using a variety of meats.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  It has turned out wonderful every time no matter what meat we've used (sausage, bbq pork and even crab).  I have to agree with others, you might want to half the recipe.  The first time I made it I had enough for an army and had to make it in 2 pans.

Good recipe but make sure your rice is cold before you fry it. I generally cook the rice the day before and then fry it the next day. I also used frozen mixed veggies. It turned out great.

Yummy, this was excellent!  My only subs were about a lb of snap peas for the sprouts/peas and a little more soy to taste.  I also cooked everything in 1 pot.  Sausage - brown, scoop to plate.  Egg - scramble, scoop to same plate.  Then sautee veggies, dump in rice, dump in sausage/egg...done!  Thanks!

Very good.  Very pretty with the peas, cabbage, and carrots.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it was missing a little something... just not enough kick for me.  My modifications:  I added crushed red pepper to my own plate.  I substituted frozen sugar snap peas for the regular peas, added a few tablespoons of a ginger sesame sauce, and used finely chopped pork roast from a prior meal in place of the sausage.  It was a great dish for using up leftover meat. Will definitely add this recipe to our meal rotation!

This is a favorite of ours. I've also made it with shrimp& crab, scallops,chicken,cubed ham. This is a great recipe that you can add ingredients and make it "your own". It's a little bit of work to make but it's a lot of fun and the "MMMMMM, this is good" s you'll get make it worth the effort.

What a great recipe! My husband raved about it all during dinner, suggesting that next time we could try it chicken or shrimp instead of the sausage to see how it tastes. Not that we didn't like it with the sausage!

This was delicious!  I omitted the onion, added leftover pork loin and cut the sausage in half (due to the pork loin) and it was wonderful.  Thanks for a great fried rice recipe!

This was absolutely awesome!  I left out the bean sprouts because i didn't have any and I left out the egg to cut down on fat a little bit.  I think next time I'll try making it w/ some chicken.

Mmmmmm, Mmmmmm good.  Now I can finally make my own fried rice that out rivals even the fried rice I get at the Chinese restaurants.  You can't beat this one for a unique taste that will leave your taste buds asking for more.  Would give this 10 stars if I could.

Just wonderful! Best of all - it's so easy to make. Spicy sausage boosted the flavor. Unless you're feeding a large crowd, half the recipe. The amount of the ingredients seemed small at the time but when added all together, I could have fed my entire subdivision.

Fantastic recipe! I used spicy pork/venison cajun sausage and instead of soy sauce, I used a spicy Szechuan stir fry sauce since I was out of soy sauce. As I was cooking it, I was doubting my changes but it really spiced it up a bit and overall the combination of ingredients is amazing. Great dish!

This was my first time making fried rice. It was for my daughter's birthday to go along with her pick of Orange Chicken from Costco. I didn't add the sausage since it was a side dish, but it was fabulous. My whole family went back for seconds. I had to make it a second time that week. I did add fresh ginger and sesame oil since I had it in the house. Thanks!

I made this a few days ago, and decided I'd drop a quick review.  I'd rate it 3 1/2 if I could.  My overall "complaint" is that I found the result was on the bland side.  It didn't taste bad, it just tasted a bit boring.  I'm still eating the leftovers, and today for lunch I jazzed it up a bit with some Lawry's seasoned salt, and a bit of Franks Red Hot sauce... and I gotta say, it tasted pretty darned good!  With some tweaks, I'd make it again, adding some more spice, and a bit of hot sauce, right from the get go.

This is fabulous!  I omit the bean sprouts because they are never on hand, and I sometimes use kielbasa instead of ground sausage.  Also, I usually half the recipe and still need a bigger pan.  I never liked cabbage before this dish.

I am the daughter of legz. this recipe is great with leftover rice. instead if you don't have pork you can use bacon. you can also use mung sprouts than cabbage. I recmend it to mothers who's kids don't like veggies.

I made this rice with chicken instead of sausage and it turned out GREAT.  My family loved it.  I did have to add a little oil to the pan after taking the chicken out because there wasn't anything to fry the egg in but other then that I stuck to the recipe.

Delicious!  This was my 1st attempt at fried rice, and it was a big hit with the whole family.  I followed others' advice and cut the recipe in half and used broccoli stir fry mix.  Will definitely make again.

So far I have made this recipe twice. once with sausage & once with chicken.  I actually prefered it with the sausage, much to my suprise!  Both times I omitted the green onion and carrot, and it still turned out delicious! will definatly be making again.

Good fried rice. I changed it though to make it healthier. I used fat free soy sausage (I don't eat meat), I used brown rice instead of white, and I used egg beaters instead of eggs. I used a frozen peas and carrots blend also.Very good. Loved the taste of the "sausage" in there. It made a huge amount too.

I liked the way it turned out, haven't had much luck with fried rice in the past, but I felt that the sausage overwhelmed the other flavors.  Next time I will try a more mild meat.

Made 1/2 batch, this would easily feed 6 people. I found it to be ok but probably only about a 3 1/2 star rating.  It was interesting, but not quite what I want in fried rice. Thanks anyway.

Fabulous. I cut the recipe in half and still fed our family of 6. Used all of the sausage, added mushrooms and extra soy sauce. The sausage is good in this- I was hesitant. Probably not a meal for work days....it took longer than the 40 min. it says. Really really good!

Although this fried rice dish was very good, I can't say that I "loved" it.  I would make it again though.  I agree with  other reviews that experimentation with other ingredients might be worthwhile.  Smoked meats, and/or perhaps sauteed chopped onion (in addition to scallions) to replace the sprouts might be well worth trying.

Very tasty -- I didn't use bean sprouts, mainly because I was too lazy to go to the store to buy them!  I will definitely make again and throw in whatever leftovers I have in the fridge -- I think it would be great with some mushrooms and chicken too!

Great fried rice recipe.  I didn't read the recipe correctly the first time I made it and used fresh, hot rice.  It tasted good, but came out kind of mushy and gummy.  Now I see why the recipe calls for cold rice.  The second time I made it I used rice that was refrigerated overnight.  This time the fried rice turned out perfectly.  My husband requests this dish at least once a month and it is great for using leftovers in.

Very good fried rice.  The flavor of the sausage really blends well with the vegetables and rice.  It is also good with any leftover chicken, beef or ham that you might have on hand.  Good dish for experimenting with different meats and vegetables.

This was a big hit with my Husband.  i left out the sausage for my portion, and it was great.  Added some fire roasted red pepper for more color.  We have lots of leftovers frozen for lunches, especially since i misread and used 6 cups of Raw rice, and had to adapt the scale of the rest of the ingredients!!

I have never tried to make my own fried rice before, but this recipe was very easy to make.  I made the recipe for my family and they just raved about it.  Even my 9 year old daughter who is a very picky eater loved it!  This encouraged me to take it to a company get together and I am not exaggerating when I say that over 10 people asked me for the recipe.  Thanks, Gloria!!!  I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand.

This really wasn't anything to rave about. I like my ham fried rice much better. We ate this dish but no one wanted seconds- it wasn't bad...but definantly not one of those recipes that you hang on to. I think the sausage over powers the dish- unlike when it is made with ham.

It had potential and I had tried a new pressure cooker with rice, so had lots...of dry cooked rice.   Made lots of changes (thus 3 stars)  in accordance with what I had, mainly because I seldom make fried rice.  I will make it again, with the correct ingredients, and remember to cook the egg on the SIDE or else it  turns the rice mushy!

Possibly one of the most amazing dishes ever!  I cheated - I had vinegar cole slaw (no mayo) and used that instead of chopped cabbage, but I kept everything else the same.  This is insanely delicious!

We served each bowl with a sunny-side up egg on top.  My teenage daughter said that she would eat it again for breakfast!  I did add a couple cubes of frozen ginger and garlic to the cooking meat.

I made this for dinner last night.  Quite tasty in my opinion.  My husband was hesitant to try it as he dislikes cabbage, but because he enjoys sausage so much and because he was hungry, he gave it a try.  He seemed to like it enough for seconds!  Lots of leftovers, but I like leftovers.  I shredded 5 nice-sized carrots and used a 16-oz. bag of peas.  I like soy sauce so used more than 1/4 cup.  Also added an extra egg or two.  No green onion and no sprouts. Question:  would it be easier to use a wok and cook all ingredients together rather than sausage, remove; egg, set aside; etc.  Next time!

It was ok. I think I would rather have another meat. Sausage was pretty strong . Used ground sweet sausage. Love the basic ingredients.

This is the best fried rice I have ever had!  Something so satisfying about creating the "best" yourself.  I used 3 fresh duck eggs in place of the 5 chicken eggs.  Also, I used fresh beans sprouts in place of the canned.   The only thing I would have done differently is add more carrot, as the three I used were a bit small. No doubt. I will make this again.

Followed the recipe to a T .... and it was sooooo BLAND. My suggestion would be to have a Kikkoman stir fry seasoning packet on hand to rescue the dish if needed.

Made this with out veggies because I have veggie haters. They loved this and I can always make a small batch of veggies and add it for the two of us that like veggies. Super versatile will be making this again and again.

I followed the recipe word for word.  It was good.  My husband didn't care for it though so I probably won't make it again.  It was a lot of work as well which is another reason I won't make it again.

WOW!  After reading the reviews I thought I would cut the recipe in half.  So glad I did not!  A family of 5 (with three hungry boys) We ate all of it!  I used left over pork tenderloin instead and added more veggies, peas, green beans etc.  It was terrific.  Thanks Gloria!

Delicious! I made this with pork loin instead of sausage, and it still turned out great. I would recommend using a little more soy sauce than what's listed, and definitely keep in mind this probably makes about 12 servings, not 8!

This rice was good. I only made 1/2 the recipe, I was only cooking for 2 and we had plenty of leftovers.
The rice is not hard to make but there are a lot of steps to it. It would work out best if all the prep work was done ahead of time. While assembling the rice there wasn't always time to do prep work. The last step when adding the green onion I also added a bit of cooked shrimp. 
I thought the rice was good and flavorful, but I was not a huge fan of the sausage. Next time I will do shrimp, chicken or beef. 
I will agree with other reviews, cold rice is a must!! I have used hot in the past and that's when it gets mushy.

Awesome. I used turkey meat and peanut oil, and I'd run out of cabbage so a bag of frozen peas and carrots had to suffice. But even so, it was really, really tasty.

I usually try several recipe's a week to keep my family from being "bored". Our family loves asian food so I decided to try this recipe and we loved it. My kids are 3,3, and 6 and they even asked for seconds. The only substitutions I made were snap peas and broccoli instead of bean sprouts and green peas. The sausage I used was mild country sausage. I did add a little extra oil and soy sauce and let the carrots cook for a little bit before adding the cabbage. Great Food!

I don't really get much flavor from this dish. It needs something more. Maybe some garlic or more green onions? My kids loved it! It wasn't difficult to make. It would make a better side for you than main dish.

This is a great starter recipe.  I had never made fried rice before, and it's so easy and good!  The first time I made it, I found it a little bland, so the second time around I started first with some fresh ginger and garlic in the oil, and also added sesame oil to mixture while frying (in my wok).  It makes a lot, but fried rice is good any time of day!  Yum!

This recipe was good but a bit bland.  I added oyster sauce and sesame oil and that seemed to help.  I also would cut the recipe in half because there was so much left over I had to freeze a bunch because we just couldn't eat it all.

I loved the taste of this dish.  Though, the 6 cups of rice was a bit much for me to try to fry all at once.  Next time I will make half an order.  Also the rice has a lot of ingredients and steps.  So I make sure to cook it ahead of time and freeze it in zip lock bags for a quick family dinner later.

I made this WITHOUT the sausage because we were using it as a side dish for pork-chops.  It was delicious, just the flavor I wanted.  It really does make a LOT, but I went ahead with the full recipe because I knew it'd be a good left-over for packing in lunches.  I actually had to make it in two batches because we didn't have a wok or a skillet big enough for the whole mess!

Great fried rice!  Reminds me of the Japanese steak house!

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I had to cut it down since it was just for me and my husband, and half of the recipe was still enough for 3 meals! Easy way to impress loved ones and make them think you spent all day in the kitchen.

This was good but it had to much meat. Next time I will use less. I also think it would be better with ground beef instead of pork.

I made this with left over chicken sausage and omitted the bean sprouts because I forgot to get them at the store.  My fiance loved it and I thought it was pretty good.  An easy and tasty way to use leftover rice and sausage.  Thanks.

I will try this again, and make sure my rice has enough time to chill before I make this recipe. The rice did end up rather mushy because it wasn't old enough. The flavor was pretty good, though. We ate this as a main course. If it wasn't so labor intensive I would try it as a side dish!

This stir fry was okay, but I have had many other that were better.  Some of it was due to the fact that I didn't use sausage, which is loaded with flavor.  I used chicken and shrimp and found myself adding sesame oil and more soy b/c there was no flavor.  I will stick to the House Fried Rice recipe for next time.

I made this using chicken, and it turned out well.  I also added substituted celery for the cabbage.  I'll use a bit more soy sauce in this recipe next time, it was a bit bland for my tastes.

The best!  It did make a huge amount...ate off the leftovers for 4 days!  Flavors get better each day.  Will make this again.

Fabulous!  Perfect blend of ingredients.  I used low fat sausage and it turned out wonderfully.  Will be making this again!
