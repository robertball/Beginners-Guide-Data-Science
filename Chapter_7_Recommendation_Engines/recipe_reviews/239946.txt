These also taste great when you use the mint flavored Oreos.

A co-worker made these and brought them to work - everyone LOVED them.  The white chocolate on the outside and ooie-oreo goodness on the inside! Glad I came across this recipe and can make them myself now.

18 cookies at a time x 2 in food processor.  When crumby, add half of the cream cheese.  Becomes very fine.  Small scoop yields approx 48 balls.

What can I say?! These little balls of sin are just too easy to make for the amount of satisfaction they bring to your mouth.  Friends have been asking me to make them again for the remainder of football season. ...little, popable, truffle-like balls of joy.  RECOMMEND: keep them in freezer for a cool blast when popped.  They'll never freeze hard.

So easy and delicious! Melted Hershey’s Kisses instead of almond bark to coat Oreo balls then sprinkled crushed candy canes on top. After coating each ball placed them in mini muffin/cupcake wrappers. Great recipe!

Excellent!  I've made these for years but have used regular chocolate for dipping.  The vanilla flavored almond bark changed everything!  It's a crunchy outside with a creamy inside.  Really good!  I had to make these twice this holiday season since everyone wanted more.

These turned out great! I used white chocolate morsels instead of vanilla almond bark. Honestly I could have used 2 12oz bags of white chocolate morsels to fully cover the Oreo balls better. But taste awesome!

I've been making these for years!  Like another reviewer, I use a food processor, then freeze the dough for about 15 minutes before making the balls.  I used mint oreos last year, this year I found peppermint ones!  Everyone loves these, especially with a drizzle of chocolate or sprinkles on top.

Used the blender to crush the Oreos, then mixed in the cream cheese with my hands. Put them on a wax paper-lined pan in the freezer for an hour. Melted the white chocolate in the microwave and used two forks as suggested to dip the Oreo balls into the white chocolate. Since these were for Christmas, I sprinkled a little bit of red and green sugar on the top (must be sprinkled on right away as soon as taken out of the white chocolate before it hardens). Delicious, very, very rich! I now see why the mint oreos would be good as well. I may try that next time.

I ended up having to make 5 batches of these in one weekend to satisfy my family.
Tips:  
*  Make sure cream cheese is room temp
* Refrigerate mixture for 15-30 minutes before forming balls
* Use melon balls scooper for uniform balls
* Refrigerate balls again before scooping
* I used was paper so after dipping that came off easily

This Christmas surprise treat was added to our traditional (in demand) recipes of buckeyes, orange balls, rolo pretzels w/m&m’s and/or pecan tops... and, wow! Everyone loved them. I chose to dip balls into melted dark chocolate (candy chips) one at a time, quickly sprinkling with various holiday colors of sprinkles. Chilled then drizzled melted white chocolate chips (through bagged tip) atop sprinkled balls. Very festive!

The concept of this recipe is great, but if you don't like white chocolate (like me) then just use milk chocolate and it will still be one of the favorite desserts for the occasion!

I make these all the time! I like using mint Oreos as well. I put mine in the freezer after putting chocolate on top. I am not a big fan of Oreos but I love these! In my opinion, I like it better with out chocolate on top! Ty for the recipe!

I can never find almond bark so I dipped in melted chocolate chips. Used mint Oreos for half (doubled recipe). Put cookies in food processor with cream cheese. Freezing well.

These are awesome !  Even better when you dip them in white or chocolate almond bark!  Or put a popsicle stick in for an easy cake pop.

Made a double batch for my daughter who loved this. I must admit I never even sampled a bite.  I am not a big Oreo fan and made these when I was doing all my Christmas baking so there was just a lot more to sample around the same time. I will make again as kids loved these.

These are great with the vanilla almond bark instead of chocolate coating. I like to sprinkle some extra crushed up cookies on top to make them look nice.
