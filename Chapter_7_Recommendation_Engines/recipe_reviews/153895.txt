Being from Virginia I was raised eating spoonbread. Very good but I never allow batter to cool before mixing in eggs, just temper.  I added a little sugar  **Tip- heat casserole dish in the oven, once hot place 1 tbsp of butter in dish to melt.  Pour batter and bake.

Yum, yum, yum. The first time I had spoon bread was at Christiana Campbell's Tavern in Williamsburg, VA.  I have been looking for a spoon bread recipe like that for ages.  This one is definitely a keeper.  Just remember to put a nice pat of butter on top and let it melt down! Very good.

This is actually a great base for spoon bread.  When I worked in kitchens, we'd add whatever we had lying around that couldn't be used to something else.  I took this recipe and added about a cup of sauteed peppers & onions, a cup of frozen corn, 2 cups of cheese, green onions, parsley, and diced sausage of some sort.  It turned out great and it useful for cleaning out the fridge.

Made this spoon bread with taco soup and doubled the recipe, my family loved it!! Taste just like my mother use to make. I didn't wait for milk and cornmeal to cool, but tempered eggs into mixture and preheated pan in oven with tbsp of butter as another reviewer suggested.

Made this tonight. I didn't have time to let it cool so I whipped the cornmeal mixture in my stand mixer to cool it enough to add the eggs. (I saw another recipe that called for a stand mixer)  It turned out light and fluffy with a custardy middle.  Wonderful. We enjoyed it with butter and then with some honey for dessert. (Might add a tiny bit more salt next time.)

Although this was quite tasty, it wasn't as creamy as I'm use to having spoon bread.  I'll look for my old recipe...

Not very flavorful on its own, but it was a great side with tangy tomato sauced baked chicken.  I really liked the texture of the spoon bread and the crispy, chewy "crust".

There are lots of recipes for Spoonbread. Many of them containing corn. I prefer mine without corn (save the corn for corn pudding!). This recipe proved much simpler, and yielded a wonderful result. Made it. Loved it, as did my other half, who proceeded to finish the pan before the evening was finished. I was told this was a "keeper", and to make it again soon. I like mine a bit sweet, so I added a 1/4-cup of sugar. Next time I make it, I'll also add 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla. Otherwise, a prefect recipe.

My friend who hails from Virginia brought spoon bread over for me to try then I found this recipe, which tastes just like hers. She says 'use a lot of butter'. This is good old comfort food. Yum

I made this just as written with the exception of waiting the hour for the cornmeal mix to cool.  I simply tempered the eggs and went on with the recipe.  This was very good and would be excellent with chili.

Too salty as is. I also added sugar for some sweetness. Also, just temper the eggs by adding a little bit of the batter to the eggs at a time, much easier than what the recipe says to do.

Had never heard of spoonbread before so decided to give it a try...very glad I did. My daughter and I ate almost the whole thing between us with only one small piece left. Just delicious with maple syrup on top! We will definitely be making this again!!

This looks soooo deliciously good! Can I use this for the top of my tamale pie?  I didn't want to use a plain old cornbread recipe. I'd like to know as soon as possible so if you can, Please email me at dilisana@aol.com with your response too. I'm afraid I may miss your comment. 
Thanks!

First time I ever had spoon bread was when my aunt brought it on thanksgiving a few years ago and since I had yet to find a recipe that yielded the same sweet, fall-apart results. I added a few dashes of sugar to my recipe. I also added whole corn (decobbed of course) and only two eggs as that's all I had lying around the kitchen at the time. Very savory and comforting, almost like eating buttery grits!

I made it but added 1/4 of sugar, approx 1 cup frozen shoe peg corn (I added it Frozen To the warm mash to cool it down) and about 1 1/2 cups of shredded monteray jack cheese. I also backed the salt down by half.....Delicious!!!

I grew up eating an old family spoonbread recipe. This version is less eggy than my family's recipe, which I actually prefer. I like the firmer texture and I think the corn flavor is more prominent. I made a few minor changes from the recipe- tempered the eggs to save time as suggested by other reviewers, and I also added some chopped green onions and frozen corn for additional flavor. The flavor of the spoonbread was great & would be delicious even without these additions, I will definitely be making this again.

Wonderful!! It is great as-is and easy to tweak to various tastes and flavor profiles.
