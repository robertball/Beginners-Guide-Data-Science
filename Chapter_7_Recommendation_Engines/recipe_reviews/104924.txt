There are too many competeing flavors and textures in this sandwich. In addition nutritionally the calorie chloesterol and sodium values are very high.

I made this for my husband and two boys--I DID NOT TRY THIS MYSELF. I made four sandwiches from one pound of ground beef. I did sprinkle each patty with salt/pepper before cooking. I used whole wheat bread cheddar cheese and added thinly sliced red onion. Thumbs up from all four. My husband must have liked it he ate two.

Great combos! My husband loves hamburger and eggs together. Make sure it's lean beef and you can lighten this up a bit by only using one slice cheese and ham...YUM! Use a good thick bread too. Thanks Oscar!

I fixed this burger for my husband and he liked it ok. It does seem to have a lot going on under the bun but I have visited several restaurants in the south that actually have these on their menus. The only differences are that some make egg salad out of the egg to go on the burger instead of a fried egg. In most cases the ham is substituted with bologna we call them "Bologna Burgers" down here. In any case this is a good burger when looking for something different. I would make it again.

Venison is the leanest "ground beef" I know and that is what I used. I had sliders in my freezer that were already formed into patties so I used 2 of those in place of one large patty. I also used mustard in place of the ketchup and mayo out of personal preference. I see other reviewers complained of too much going on under the bun but really it is all of that going on under the bun that makes this supa-dupa! We enjoyed these very much. The one complaint I have is that 1 egg kind of gets lost under 2 slices of cheese and 2 slices of ham and the egg is supposed to be the star of the show. The next time I make these I will only use 1 slice each of the cheese and ham.
