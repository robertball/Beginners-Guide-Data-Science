Skipped both the chestnuts and the dates, and since they were optional, I didn't think they would make much difference in my overall opinion of this dish. Can't really put my finger on what it was that I wasn't that crazy about. Basically, it was a stew with a slightly off taste. I guess I was hoping that it would be more of a glazed sweetened rib, but it wasn't. I think I will stick to a more traditional savory stew next time I make stew, and find a more glazed BBQ type recipe for the short ribs.

Very tasty!!! I skipped the soaking and didn't have time for it to simmer quiet as long as indicated.  Skipped the corn syrup/waterchestnuts/dates/green onion, used whole button mushrooms.  The person who said they had to use extra water probably didn't cover the pot while simmering.  Next time I'll add more potatoes and carrots.

The end result is worth the wait, its an excellent tasting dish.  I had a problem with the recipe, i just dont see how this dish can cook that long with only 2 cups of the reserved broth.  I had to add 2 more cups of water, one at a time during the cooking time.  Next time i will reserve more of the broth to add.

Very good!  My husband and kids all loved this recipe.  I didn't add the nuts because I didn't think my kids would eat it.  I also forgot the mushrooms but plan on adding them next time.  Thanks!

This was very good! I omitted the dates, chestnuts, and corn syrup. I used a little extra brown sugar instead. I boiled the short ribs in the water and then transferred it and all my ingredients to the crock pot, where I cooked it on high for about 5 hours. I cooked it for a half hour longer with the lid off and added a little cornstarch slurry to the broth to thicken it up a bit before serving. This one is a keeper for my family!

Where I am from there are very few asian families (less than 1% of the population) but there is a Korean family that owns the only oriental mart around for hours. They have a "deli" inside, where they serve this dish. The only difference is they add a can of drained white hominy. The menu lists it as "Korean Menudo" (possibly due to the fact that 70% of the population there is Hispanic). It is delicious and fairly easy to prepare. Perfect for a fall or winter night

Very yummy!  I followed the recipe and it took way too long for my liking.   Next time will try slow cooker.  I left out the corn syrup, dates & chestnuts and was kicking myself for forgetting to buy sesame oil.  It still turned out great but know the sesame oil would have made it heavenly.

We liked it a lot.  I had to make some substitutions, based on what I had on hand (white wine instead of rice wine, honey instead of corn syrup, no chestnuts).  My husband and I loved it.  We raise beef cattle and I used to have trouble figuring out what to do with the short ribs, but this will be my go-to recipe now.   Also, I did keep the lid on the pot throughout and had plenty of liquid left for the sauce.

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have any rice wine so I used regular white cooking wine. I also omitted the oil, corn syrup, mushrooms, dates & chestnuts. I cut the garlic clove amount in half & used splenda brown sugar blend instead of brown sugar. I added a sweet potato in with the carrots & white potato, and my husband & I both enjoyed it thoroughly. I did have to add a  little broth, because I used a lot more potatoes & carrots than the recipe called for. This is a keeper which I will surely make again.
