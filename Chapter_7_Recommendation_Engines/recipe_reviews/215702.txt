This recipe bought back such wonderful memories.  I remember my grandmother as well as my mother making this the same way with  raisins, brown sugar and lemon juice. I was so excited finding this recipe after misplacing my mom's.  I was not disappointed.  Thanks so much.

I've been looking for a recipe like this. Just like grandma's. Even better the next day.

This is such a great recipe and everyone in my family has loved it.  That being said, it is a little sweet and ketchupy in my opinion.  My brother liked that about it and was basically drinking the sauce.

Tastes exactly like my Bubbe made for us. Served with lightly steamed baby carrots and mashed potatoes. I love this recipe and so does my husband!

I followed the recipe as it.  It was delicious.  I did double the sauce so has extra.  I also covered the rolls with cabbage leaves to keep moist.

This recipe was the closest I could find to recreate my mother's stuffed cabbage. I cut the recipe in half, used balsamic vinegar instead of the Citrix salt, used homemade sauce with the cabbage pieces, raisins,and sugar added. I baked it in the sauce for 1 1/2 hours covered at 300 degrees.
Everyone in the family loved the sweetness and tanginess of this filling meal.

I like this very much. The only change I made was to add more vinegar. The rolls do taste better the second time around. The next time I make these I will double the recipe and freeze some for another day.

Followed everything, just had no idea how much salt and pepper to add.  Found the sauce excellent.  Will spice up the meat next time.
