This recipe was pretty good. I adjusted so that it had a cream base and it was even better!!!All I did was add 1 1/2 cups of milk, 1 tbsp. of flour and some salt and pepper. My husband LOVED it!!! It was outstanding! A must try!!

I modified this recipe a bit... a little less seasoning, couple more garlic cloves, tiny bit of olive oil, and added small chunks of mozarella cheese to the pasta... and it turned out to be a GREAT recipe.

Oh, and a pinch of salt and pepper.

Saw this in the recent reviews so I whipped me up some for lunch. I cut the butter back to 1/4 cup, the spices to 1 tsp, used 2 big cloves of roasted garlic & I browned my butter because I love the flavor...served it over egg noodles. Even though I cut back on the butter, I still had some left, that I didn't need. This would probably coat  at least two servings of pasta unless you like it swimming in butter. Thansk for a tasty lunch Christine!

This recipe was right on for flavor and ease of preparation.  I increased the spices a bit and added 1-1/2 cups of milk and 1 tbl. of flour as suggested by one review.  It was restaurant awesome. Perfect amount over angel hair pasta with scallops.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!  Darlene

IT was great.  Just what I was looking for. used it on my seafood pasta dish.   One thing I can't figure out is how you can change the recipe then give it lower marks because you did not like it!??  Seems to me your changes .  .  .  never mind.

I made this for my girlfriend to put on grilled chicken breast instead of pasta.  I cooked the chicken breast, then coated it in the sauce on the frying pan, letting the flavour cook through for a couple minutes on medium-low heat.  Tasted amazing.

I made this recipe but I changed it up quite a bit. I stuck with the 1/3 cup of butter. Then I added a Tbsp of minced garlic. After it sauteed for a few minutes to get the flavor into the butter I added about a Tbsp of flour to thicken things up. Once it was thickened I added milk a Tbsp at a time until the sauce smoothed out a bit and because the consistency I wanted...something that would be a little thinner but still all hold onto my gnocchi's without puddling at the bottom of the bowl. As soon as I got the right consistency I added a pinch of sea salt for flavor and a shake or two of italian seasoning which really made the sauce. It was AMAZING!! Thanks for the basics for what because a staple in my house! I think I may make this an can it for my family!

I loved how simple this sauce was.  It tasted great.  I also reduced the amount of herbs and added more garlic and some pepper.  My husband said it tasted like the dipping sauce we just had at an italian restaraunt!

I used this sauce as a base for my pasta, only I added milk and cornstarch to make it thicker. I thought it was really good in flavor but I had to add quite a bit of salt. It was still good, and I will continue to use it when i don't want to have a marinara or tomatoe sauce pasta. I even liked it better than store bought alfredo! It was good.

Delicious!!!  I did what the others suggested and added more garlic and less of the herbs and my picky eater loved it!  I added frozen veggies to make it a meal in one dish.

very good/quick base (instead of 2 dollar pkg from store). Saute onion, garlic, mushroom?, spices + grnd pepper, butter, evoo, chicken stock/wh wine, milk3/4c & corn starch to thicken, plus whatever cheese laying around. Bingo on pasta or+veggie or+chk breast...oops went wild again ;)

I used this recipe tonight and it was tasty.  Probably a bit too much oregano for my taste also, but it's a good starting point for me to improvise my own calculations for it.  I also added a bit of olive oil and served it with bowtie pasta/brocolli.  Reguardless of what ratings anyone else gave this, I'm glad it's up here so I can learn it :)

I just tried this recipe to put over the top of my raviolis... definitely a great start! I minced up 6 small garlic cloves, used a stick of butter, probably a tsp and a half of italian seasonings, 1/3 tsp of onion powder, 1 tsp garlic salt and some pepper... I also added 3/4 cup of milk and some flour to thicken it up. It was good!

this sauce is ok...maybe the reason why it didn't work for that other person who used 1/4 cup of basil is because it doesn't SAY 1/4 cup...it said 1/4 tablespoon...hahah

This is a good recipe. Full of flavor. I used Italien Seasoning. I wanted a cream sauce so I added a little flour and about 1 cup of half/half.

Excellent sauce. I made this for my husband to go on my Uncle Sammy's gnocchi tonight. It was quick and easy. Did not have basil, so used McCrormick's Italian Perfect Pinch. Worked out very well. Burned first batch beyond repair. Had to ditch it and make fresh. Was more attentive to second batch, but still nearly burned. Must improve my Vigilance!!!! Hard when I am trying to cook & remove gnocchi while preparing the butter sauce so that both will be hot when all of gnocchi are ready.

I roasted a whole head of garlic, placed it in the food processor, then added melted butter, the seasonings a bit of chicken broth and lemon juice and gave it a whirl. It went very nicely over stuffed shirmp. Thanks!

This was great!  Like others suggested, I made this into a garlic cream sauce. I added a Tablespoon of flour when the garlic was done cooking, and stirred in 1 1/2 cups heavy cream.  After the sauce was thick, I removed from heat and added 1/2 a pound lump crab left over from making cold Crab Cocktail Dip (recipe found on Allrecipes). The crab got hot without overcooking.  Delicious!

Oh my goodness.  This was SOOO delicious and decadent.  I did two cloves of garlic, and used Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle (California basil, Turkish oregano, minced garlic and thyme) in place of the recipe-listed herbs.  This will be having repeat performances in my house!

I loved this recipie! But, I don't like oregano so I left it out and added a touch of parsley and a bit more garlic and it was amazing. I served it over spinach and ricotta filled raveoli and it was wonderful!

I was pleasantly surprised.  Starving after I put my baby to bed and realized that my quick and easy pasta was not going to be so easy since I was out of red sauce (and out of tomatoes, etc.)  I whipped this up in a jiffy w/o the oregano and it came out great!!

Quite good, but I made several changes. I cut oregano down to 1/4 tsp as recommended. Good choice. 2 cloves of garlic, and I added mozzarella cheese. I added steamed broccoli at the end and poured over pasta. Excellent!

Simple, easy, delicious. Anything with this much butter is going to be high in calories though so just be aware when spooning it onto your pasta, seafood, or chicken.

Just an ordinary butter sauce. I could have made the same thing in the microwave. I poured it over homemade gnocchi and it was just decent. I used 2 garlic cloves. The recipe didn't specify if you diced the garlic and added it or just crushed the clove and removed it later.

I give it 4 stars because I changed it some. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used ready-to-use minced garlic-probably about 1/2 T. I used 1/4 C butter, 1/2 tsp Parsley, 2 tsp Oregano, 1 tsp Basil.  I had a cooked chicken from Costco and wanted to use some of it up, so I took some slices, chopped them up, and added them into the sauce. letting them sizzle and soak it all up. Then, I put that over the noodles. Yum! Thanks for the start up on it! (:

This was great!  I added milk to make it a bit creamier and a touch of cornstarch to thicken it.  I also added mushrooms to mine and it was so good over bowtie pasta and grilled chicken!  Tasted like restaurant quality!  I will make this often!

Quick and easy recipe. I had everything already in my kitchen! Suggestions by other reviewers to add milk and flour were good. Without them, the sauce would just be reeeally buttery. I eye-balled the basil and oregano and went by taste. Reduce the butter to 1/4 at least or else it's just waaay too much.

My family & I really liked this.  It is very flavorful, easy to make and contained ingredients that I had on hand.  It's a really nice change from heavy sauces.  It's great for the summer.  Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic leaping-off point for a huge range of possibilities. For a single (large) serving of pasta, I halved the butter, about tripled the garlic, left out the oregano, kept the basil, and added a little black pepper. I'm sure I'll make it again, too.

I was looking for a simple garlic sauce recipe for dinner tonite and came across this one. First I read many of the reviews of others and decided then to give this recipe a try.  OMG it turned out better then what I expected. I did however make some changes, based on reviews/suggestions from others and made this a cream sauce.  I used half & half and cornstarch to thicken.  As I always do when I am cooking , I tasted as I was making this and had to add more salt, pepper and garlic, for my taste.  My husband, who is a picky eater said this was very good with a thumbs up.  I gave this recipe a 4 star only because of the changes I made. The next time I make this I will use fresh herbs instead. The dried herbs took some time to soften up in the sauce, but this is a recipe I will use again and again.   Thanks  for posting this delicious recipe.

This recipe is great! I followed what reviewers said to make it a creamy sauce. Added milk and a tsp. or so of flour to thicken it a bit. Poured it over angel hair pasta and then poured the remaining over sautéed chicken-taste wonderful!! Even better the next day.

I use this recipe as a foundation for my own creative mind. I love this recipe! I used oregano, basil,parsley flakes,  butter, a dash of garlic salt, garlic pepper, salt,olive oil, pepper, italian seasoning, and roasted herb seasoning! It came out amazing! Im paring the sauce with fettucine, shrimp, and broccoli cuts! Yayyy!

I made a roux first, just 1 tbsp. flour and 1 tbsp. unsalted butter, then added 1 cup heavy cream, then added some white cooking wine, red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, & dried parsley, and fresh grated garlic( 3 big cloves of it). Then I drained a can of small clams, poured a little bit of the clam juice in the mixture, added the clams and cooked some shrimp in it too. I then made homemade noodles, and poured the clam/shrimp sauce over them.

I thought it was really delicious and easy to make. I only changed it a little by using pre-crushed garlic from a jar instead of crushing a clove myself and I used little of a lemon & pepper spice. I poured it over spaghetti and everyone enjoyed it.

Perfect.  Exactly what butter noodles should be.  

I lessened the amount of oregano a bit and added a pinch of black pepper, but I'm sure it's just as good as written.

I, too, added some flour in the form of tapioca starch and almond rice flour. I decreased the herbs, added garlic salt and pepper, and 1 1/2 c of milk. Great sauce for my egg noodles. One kid hates parmesan cheese, so it's like alfredo minus the strong cheese.

Very Basic recipe, I think fresh basil and some Red Chili Pepper flake with added production cream would bring it together for an overall nappe texture.

I was less than impressed. Nothing special about it. The dried herbs kind of took over and were very overwhelming. Won't make again.

This sauce tasted really good over some bowtie pasta. I also added extra milk to make it creamier and reduced the amount of basil. A little bit of extra salt wouldn't hurt either.

Meh. Too many dried spices - gave the pasta a gritty texture. Bad. Overwhelmed the butter and garlic. The only things I did differently were to add a splash of olive oil, and I minced, rather than crushed my garlic. I have no way to crush garlic right now! I'll try it again, with fresh herbs (or none?) and perhaps some milk and flour as suggested by other reviewers.

It was alright but seemed like too much garlic.  Next time I would just use garlic powder and just sprinkle a little bit to give it flavor without overwhelming it.

I followed a users suggestion and added milk and flour until it was a little creamy.  This also helped to stretch the recipe to make about 4 servings.

There was just too much oregano and basil. It overpowered the garlic and butter. But it was a refreshing change from tomato sauce.

Delicious!!  I had leftovers the next day and after re-heating, the little voice in my head told me to add some sour cream (sounds strange, I know) so I did and wow!!  There were only enough leftovers for me, but my husband grabbed a fork and couldn't stop eating it!

GREAT TASTE! We "doctored"it up with some heavy whipping cream and fresh basil and parsley. Also melted some garlic/herb cheese into it.  Use your imagination and it only gets better.Thanks for the foundation.

Made this to put over some ricotta cavatelli, used jarred minced garlic and used salted butter.  Tasted great with some parmesan cheese, suspect it would be best with fresh-grated asiago or romano.

Great sauce!  I used a whole stick of butter, because I made a whole lb. of spaghetti.  I cut back on the oregano- too strong, the basil as well.   I also used extra garlic.  The sauce was great and VERY easy to make.  I added some Bertolli five cheese spaghetti sauce and that brought out the flavors even more.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

way to much oregano and basil. That is all I could really taste. I listened to others and add salt. I tired to fix it but it was just way overpowering. I add tomatos and cheese. Will try my own version next time.

A very nice side dish sauce. I put it on pasta with veggies and diced chicken breast to make it as a main dish but it just didn't quite give that 'main course' feel. 

I can't help but think that this would be spectacular on grilled corn on the cob. Mmmmmmmmm....... corn.......

The recipe had way too much oregano and basil.  It also needed more garlic.  I added BBQed chicken sauteed with italian dressing.  That tasted very good.  I also only added about half of the suggested herbs and put in some italian seasoning.  Parmesian cheese tasted good too.

The seasonings and garlic were a little too strong for my kids.  I substituted 2 Tbs. Italian Seasoning for the individual seasonings and added steamed broccoli and bits of chicken to my pasta!!! I also added quite a bit of salt.  In the end--Very Tasty  KH

This recipe was great, although you may want to cut down on the oregano, that is s very strong herb, and add a little more garlic. And maybe even suggest a tint of salt.

I made this for my girlfriend to put on grilled chicken breast instead of pasta. I cooked the chicken breast, then coated it in the sauce on the frying pan, letting the flavor cook through for a couple of minutes on medium-low heat. Tasted amazing.

As usual I try to go through the comments and take everyone's suggestions.. I followed the directions except the oregano and basil I just used a couple of dashes of both.  I used sliced red onion and chopped tomatoes for color and flavor. It was absolutely amazing.

I followed one of the reviews and I’m glad I did. I added flour and milk to make a cream sauce. The seasoning level for this recipe would have been too much if I hadn’t added the milk and flour with some salt. (1 1/2 cup milk and 1-2 tablespoons flour)

Great base. I always add broken saltine pieces and cook until crunchy. Also good with capers and top with Parmesan when served.  (It’s not really garlic butter sauce if you make it creamy but I’m sure that’s good too)

Great base with many possibilities!
I too made it into a cream and tossed it in with garden fresh steamed brussel sprouts.  It was awesome!!!  Served with smoked sausage really topped off the flavor burst.  A must try!  Thanks for sharing!

This sauce was good, although heavy feeling for a light sauce. I made it just as the recipe stated and tossed it over some linguine before adding some fresh cherry tomatoes to liven it up a little. Next time I might make it a cream base but it's overall great!

I didn't really change the recipe, except that we didn't have the right herbs so I substituted herbs de Provence.  I steamed carrot slices and green beans until barely cooked, then tossed them in this sauce.  My son and husband loved it!

Sooo good and simple. wanted to make a pasta sauce that wasn't as heavy and thick as the usual speghetti sauce.  consider: adding lots of garlic, Itallian seasoning, can of fire roasted tomatoes. once cooked I added a long pour of heavy cream and did not stir it in. looks so pretty. topped angel hair pasta with this sauce then fresh basil and ramano cheese. Cheers

Modified with more fresh garlic cloves (2), margarine instead of butter, some minced onion flakes. Added a bit of olive oil , 1 tbsp flour to make a rue and 1.5 c milk and some 4 slices of mozza cheese. I topped with fresh shrimp, cause I had some....D' LICIOUS....mmmm! SO a creamy garlic butter sauce was created!

This was a great sauce as is.  It was flavorful and easy.  The second time I made it, I added milk to make it a cream based sauce.  I also added cooked pieces of bacon to the sauce.  Delicious!

Love it, I just followed the  other reviews and added a splash of milk, salt , pepper,  and cornstarch instead  of flour and it was amazing! I added shrimp and scallops with a squeeze of lemon, num num num. Next time I will try flour, because my  cornstarch  kinda stuck together. Maybe I didn't whisk it in fast enough... but Im sure if you stick with the basic and make a little twist of your own, it will be amazing!!!  =)

This recipe was really good!  Very rich.  I served it over leftover egg noodles that I rewarmed in the pan with the sauce. The only thing I feel the recipe might need would be some salt and pepper, but that's personal preference.

This is a good recipe, but I tweaked it by adding a bit of whole milk and salt. I did use garlic powder instead of a clove. I poured it over cooked pasta and mixed in a bit of mayonnaise. Not all too "healthy", but delicious!

I was worried about the chicken getting cooked through so I sliced 3 big chicken breasts in half. I'm so glad I did because in barely 30 min the cheese and croutons were brown. Chicken was cooked through perfectly! Family loved it! I served it with angel hair pasta that had melted butter, garlic, and italian seasoning. Perfect meal!

Very good.  Use 3/4 of the  butter,  and about 1/4 to 1/3 of the oregano.  Used a touch of garlic salt as well.  Also added broccoli and shrimp...yummy!

Added more garlic, steamed broccoli, sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms to the sauce on linguine pasta and the family loved it.  It is a great  sauce to work off of.

Came out really well.  I followed some of the suggestions in the comments and added flour to thicken it.  It's so simple and quick it makes even a newbie like me feel like a home cook.  I'm sure to make this again and try not to forget the cheese.

My family liked this recipe. I followed the other reviews and added 1.5 cups of milk and 1 tbs of flour to make the sauce thicker. I also cooked sausage and peppers on the side and combined them before adding it to the pasta. Lastly, I added red pepper flakes to the plates for me and my husband. He is very picky and liked it.

This is a very good basic recipe. Obviously, if you look at the other reviews, this recipe can be customized to suit your taste with respect to herbs. I did (like everyone seems to do) alter the recipe just a bit. I added a bit of olive oil to the butter while melting, because my mother taught me to ALWAYS add a bit of oil so as not to scald the butter. I also substituted parsley instead of oregano. Just my preference. I also added salt and pepper to taste. The fam loved it, and it was very quick and easy. Yes I will make it again.

This was very good! I followed a tip from a review and made it a cream base which was so simple and worth it. I did had a taste before adding the milk and flour and it would have still been good without it as well.

I was making some porcini and truffle ravioli (from Trader Joe's) and I needed a simple complimentary sauce. This recipe was enough for a 1/2 lb.  my only variation was adding a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a tablespoon of chopped walnuts. Perfect!

I, personally, luuuv garlic, so I added an extra clove and increased the serving size of the entire sauce to suit the fam. It was a little too much for the youngsters, but everyone else enjoyed it.

This sauce was great, however we felt that it was lacking just a little bit and added a pinch of kosher flake salt to give it a bit more seasoning. Great recipe. Used it with pasta shells and ate it with veal. LOVED IT!

This was a good recipe. I only used 1 tsp oregano (personal taste). I had leftover spaghetti and added the butter sauce and then put it on the oven at 350 while I cooked the meat for supper. This allowed the spices to mingle with the butter. It was really good.

I didn't really get the taste of the spices that were added into the butter. I mainly tasted butter. I did make the sauce as I put the water on to boil for the pasta and then right after I drain the pasta I put it right into the sauce to heat it back up.

Nothing too special about this.  Not bad, though.

With the addition of milk and flour as another reviewer suggested, this was excellent! Next time I'll use half unsalted butter/half regular butter, as it was a little on the salty side.

Simple recipe - gave me the idea to experiment. Didn't have much in the apt. so I started throwing things together as I do:
Butter (salted)
Garlic Clove (minced)
Two sprinklings of basil and oregano (at the beginning and a bit more at the end)
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Sweet Peas
a teaspoonish of flour (to thicken it a little)
a teaspoonish of romano cheese

Then I coated it over penne

Not bad for an experiment. mmmmm

This was very good.  I sauteed the garlic only for a couple minutes so it would be stronger (I love garlic).  I brought it to work for lunch all week and my co-workers pretty much hovered over me, drooling as I ate!

Very nice.  I added a bit of salt and substituted garlic powder, but will try minced garlic next time.

Great in a pinch - I had a late night pasta craving and nothing resembling sauce in the house.  I used a few shakes of Italian Seasoning, some dried parsley flakes, a little salt and a lot of fresh ground pepper.  If I could have any pasta sauce, this would probably not be my first choice, but it is pretty tasty and you're practically guaranteed to have all the necessary ingredients on hand.

I too used a lot less oregano and basil.  I played around with the amounts of butter & garlic to get the desired taste.  I even added a little olive oil.  It was great tossed with pasta!

this is a great simple recipe. i added a quarter teaspoon of black pepper and combined it with sauteed chicken, asparagus, and the zest of 1 whole lemon for a quick gourmet meal.

This was perfect! I made some chicken that came out dry so I made this sauce and drizzled it over the chicken. I then poured the rest over some Linguine! Yum!

VERY GOOD!!!!  Easy to make, I served this sauce with "Crushed Black Pepper Fettuccine" noodles and it was great.  I made it for V-Day and it was just the perfect touch of flavors in every bit.  thank you for the recipe.

Overall not a bad taste but, has too many herbs, it seems like that's all your eating, cut down on the herbs and add more garlic and butter to make this a better sauce.
