I really hate to do this but as written I can only give this a 3 at most. The biggest issue with this soup is that it was entirely too salty and I love salt. I would recommend leaving out the teaspoon of salt and use low sodium chicken broth. I think tortilla chips would have been a nice garnish but not the kind from the bag because that is just more salt. The chicken really held the spice mix flavor the way the directions had you do it but on the bad note, you end up with a very oily soup to the point you can see it floating on top of your bowl and it leaves a coating on your spoon. My last complaint is actually an easy fix and that is that there simply was not enough substance. There was a perfect amount of chicken and tomatoes but you really had to fish around to find any beans. I would definitely recommend adding another can of beans and be sure to rinse. All in all this had a really deep rich flavor and was super simple to prepare but for what it is worth, I just think it needs some adjustments.

The best thing I've ever made in my slow cooker!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of my picky children.  The only thing I did differently was to not cut up the chicken breasts beforehand; I just put them in whole because in the past my pre-cut chicken has turned out dry & tough in the slow cooker.  Putting them in whole made them tender and easy to shred/cut up before serving.

This soup was awesome!  My family loved it!  I did alter it a bit, tho, as it's what I had in my pantry.  Instead of pinto beans, I added a can of Ranch Style beans & Bush's Grillin' Beans Black Bean Fiesta, gravy and all.  I did omit the tsp salt and am glad I did.  I didn' t have any tomato sauce so, so I improvised by taking a half can of tomato paste and adding water to make 1 cup.  The seasoning on the chicken was outstanding.  I added the oil to the bottom of the pot and spread it all around, coating the sides as well.  After 4 hrs, I shredded the chicken breasts and put the meat back in the pot for two more hours.  Perfection!  I made the cheddar bay biscuits (a la Red Lobster) to serve alongside.  I will surely be making this recipe again.

This was so delicious! The cream of chicken soup really makes it stand out. I goofed and bought the diced jalapenos instead of chiles, but it still ended up great. Spicy, but great. I like salty food and I didn't think that this was too salty. The only reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 was that it turned out soupier than I would have liked. When I make this again (and I will make it again) I will use 3 chicken breasts and 2 or 3 cans of beans to bulk it up.

Love this recipe! The chicken gets a little dry in the slow cooker no matter what ya do and that's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. I used cannellini and black beans instead of the recommended. Delish with some sour cream!

I made this as written with the exception of using chopped frozen green chili peppers and took the advice of other reviewers in omitting the salt. The recipe was easy to make and had a lot of flavor. Thanks for sharing.

This came out wonderfully with some of the suggestions made: no oil or salt, low sodium stock and soup.
I also cooked the chicken breasts with skin and bone in, then removed later and shredded the chicken. I added some chipotle flavored sauce at the end and served it with cilantro, sour cream and cheese as garnishments. Turned out great!

I substituted Fage fat free Greek yogurt for the cream soup, and used black beans because they were in the pantry. Great soup. Loved the creamy texture.

This was a great soup recipe. A switch from my normal chicken soup. I did spice it up a bit more with jalape√±os and rotel. I also added extra spices. Family loved it. Will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.
