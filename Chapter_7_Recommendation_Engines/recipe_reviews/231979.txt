I have several recipes for sloppy Joes but this is one of the easiest and most flavorful recipes, with the fewest ingredients I have found. Some people comment it is too sweet, but not for my family we tend to like sweet. There is one ingredient I do like to add to various hamburger related recipes that adds vegetables and stretches the recipe, and that is the Bellaire brand Southwest Vegetable mix. For those of you not familiar it is a combination of chopped green peppers, onions, black beans, and corn. It is located in the frozen vegetable section of the grocery store. Costco has small pretzel buns that go perfect with sloppy Joes.

This is a really easy recipe and the sweet pickle relish adds another dimension. Next time I will cut back the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. It was a bit on the sweet side.

I made this in a dinner pinch. Turned out great. I substituted 2oz tomato paste with 6 oz water for the tomato soup. I also used 2 tablespoons of fresh minced garlic for dried. A dash of mesquite flavor and some pepper made the taste perfect.

This might be our new favorite way to make sloppy joes. Like the other reviewers, I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 c. I used ground turkey and it was delicious!

Next time I will reduce the sugar by half. It was pretty sweet. I bought really good chili sauce which makes a difference with the flavor.  Definitely quick, easy and no complaints from the family.

Quick and easy. I cut the brown sugar in half and added 4-5 drops of liquid smoke. I also minced a clove of garlic and added in with the onions because we add garlic to everything we cook in the deep south!
Geauxcook!
