I doubled the recipe to have enough for 2 x 9" round layers.  I also substituted vanilla extract for the almond extract, as I was giving this to someone and didn't want to worry about nut allergies.  The cake was a nice texture with a perfect flavor.  The measurements for the frosting seemed a little on the small side and I don't particularly like sugar frostings on cakes, so I made an orange butter cream frosting for the cake.  Finally, I embellished with some Mandarin orange sections for a nice presentation.

Just average to me, with a more coarse crumb I wasn't crazy about.  Further, it was a little more "wet" than I prefer as well.  I think it could use a little more flour, a good quarter cup. Also, I saw no reason for the 2 T. water so I just made up for it with orange juice but I think that extra 2 T. of liquid could be eliminated altogether. It had a nice, bright orange flavor, but I believe that's only because I doubled the amount of orange zest to a full tablespoon.  Not my favorite orange cake.

This little cake is pretty darn good!  I wanted the icing more orange-y, so I added grated orange rind, 1/4 tsp orange extract, and more orange juice to make it more spreadable.  Followed the cake portion of the recipe to the T.  Also, to enhance the eye appeal, I added some orange food coloring to the icing as well. Thank you Kathleen for the nice recipe.  I'll be making this one again.

This is a nice cake. Beautifully moist, good orange flavour and the frosting was good too. I did use 1 1/2 T of orange juice in the frosting to get the consistency I like. Thankyou Kathleen for a recipe we all enjoyed.

I thought this was wonderfully different!  The cake is moist and perfectly complimented by the thin layer of tangy frosting.  I used vanilla extract and some lemon juice in both the cake and frosting.

Really enjoyed this cake. Quick and easy! The frosting needed a little more orange to it (in my opinion) so maybe some orange rind might make it taste better.

Pretty good. The cake was a bit dry but had good flavor. May be somewhat my fault as I used regular flour in place of the cake flour (all I had at the time). The glaze also had a nice flavor. Would make again.

I made this cake Easter and it was a big hit. The men were very complimentary of it and it didn't last long.It tasted just like an orange HOSTESS cup cake.

OK, I LOVED this cake.  Unfortunately, or fortunately, I accidently doubled the butter the first time I made it.  The crumb was dense and melted in your mouth.  Many oohs and ahhs were heard. The second time, I followed the recipe and, probably not to anyone's surprise, it was not a delectable.  It was a lighter cake, certainly a healthier cake, but definitely not as many moans and groans of delight.  So take your pick, fabulous and rich or lighter and healthier.  Both great.

This was a HUGE hit with my party guests!  The cake was easy and very delicious.  I added extra orange zest to the batter and to the icing for flavour and altered the icing to a spreadable thickness by using more butter and icing sugar.  LOVED IT!

This cake is beautiful. It has a thin, crispy layer on the outside and a gorgeous moist (yet definitively cakey) layer on the inside.
I admit to just using the zest and juice from a whole orange, along with the tablespoons of water. I also had to bake it for a while longer (read: 50 minutes), but I've served it uniced and it's gone down a treat.

Making this again, and again!
