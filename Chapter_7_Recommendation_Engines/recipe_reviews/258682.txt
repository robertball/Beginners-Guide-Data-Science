This is very good. Great combo of flavors. I made a few changes because of what I already had. I had made cold brew ice cubes for another recipe. So I used about 1 cup of cold brew cubes (no regular ice cubes)and 1/2 c non-frozen coconut milk. It still came out creamy and icy. I added about 1 tsp coconut extract just to bring that flavor through more. I used a packet of sweet-n-low instead of sugar. The chocolate and caramel syrups on top really made the drink, and lastly, I sprinkled on some toasted coconut flakes. *This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

Delicious!! I used coconut caramel and whipped coconut cream (although it sank) and nutella because I didn't have any chocolate syrup. This is so refreshing! Thank you for the recipe.This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.
