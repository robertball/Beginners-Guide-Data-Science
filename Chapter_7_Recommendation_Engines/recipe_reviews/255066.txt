This was so simple it was ridiculous. And ridiculously good. The measurements are a bit awkward (3/4 cup of beans when a can is 1 cup, etc.) so I just adjusted the proportions and am looking forward to leftovers! Also used black beans labeled "spicy" so didn't need hot sauce and used a lemon instead of a lime because that's what I had. This is a keeper. Thanks!

I've made this a few times already. This is a quick and tasty meatless  lunch to make up with items I always have around. It's a nice base to make fast changes to - depending on what is in the fridge.  Thx for sharing! I liked it with habanero peach chunky salsa, and added some cherry tomatoes.

I made this as written the first time and it was pretty good!  Next batch, I added the black beans, cilantro and lime to the brown rice.  I then set up a “bar” with corn, chopped peppers, avocado, diced tomato, salsa, cheese, and sour cream.  That way everyone could add whatever they liked.  We’re trying to cut back on meat consumption and this was so tasty and hardy that we never missed it!

Loved this dish, made no substitutions. All the flavours blend very well together, it's quick to throw together and even the kids liked it! My neighbour asked for the recipe!

Very good and filling.  I didn't have bean so used shredded chicken with a little lime juice.   Would definitely make this again.  Easy!

I made this for my family last night. Its real simple. I just had the kids mix everything up to eat it combined and they loved it. I added fresh cilantro as suggested and didn’t include the avocado since they aren’t big avocado fans. Swapped the rice for Mexican rice. Overall easy peasy!

I have made this dish several times. Each time it gets better.  I invited friends over for dinner and served this dish. Everyone enjoyed dinner that evening.

I added grilled chicken with a squeeze of lime juice. Good, healthy food, and also yummy! Very simple to make. Honestly can't believe I never thought of doing this before now!

Quick, easy, flavorful.  I used instant brown rice and it took only a few min to put everything together.
