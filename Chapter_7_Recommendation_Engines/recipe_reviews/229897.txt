Way, way way TOO SWEET!  Unless you are using all Granny Smith apples this tasted like sugar--with a bit of apple flavoring.  Scale back the sugar to 1/2 cup, or even less.  I used a mixture of pink lady and granny smith apples and I'm glad I waited to to add sugar until nearly the end...otherwise I would have had to toss the entire pot away.

I used Splenda Brown Sugar in place of the white sugar.  I was so happy with this recipe.  I am not a lover of Apple Butter but was making it for someone else.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted it.  I loved it!

I combined the advice in the reviews with the original recipe, and it came out pretty good. I used both white sugar and Splenda brown sugar with Granny Smith apples.

Yes, I add some ginger for a little kick.
