This soup was excellent and an superb way to use up our Christmas Eve prime rib.  My family of 7 loved it and I loved the idea of not wasting a single ounce of an expensive prime rib (including the bones).  Made as directed, but next year I will try simmering the bones in my crockpot overnight and then the next day doing the reduction.  This might save on time because like another reviewer stated this took longer time period to reduce than the recipe called for.  Since there were no measurements on the amount of water to cover on the bones, this time would vary person to person, depending on how much water they used.   I simmered for about 2.5 hours on the stove and then finally ended up just boiling to reduce.  Hence my idea to use my crockpot next time then either do a boiled reduction or do a simmering reduction.  Thanks Emily!  It was a hit with all 5 of my kids, and it was a hit with me because I finally have an awesome recipe to us with prime rib leftovers.

Loved this recipe. I had a 12 pound prime rib so I had 5 bones. I upped the recipe accordingly. I also knew I would want more meat so I cleaned and cubed a steak sized portion to add to the ribs so we could have more meat in the dish. So I guess I made it a stew/soup. Yes it is time consuming, but what good soup or stew isn't.  Because I heavily season my prime rib roasts, I waited until after I added all the cooked ingredients before adding any salt or pepper. I did not add mushrooms because even though I love everything else, that is one thing this cook doesn't eat! lol I also chopped about three quarters of a bunch of green onions and threw them in about 5 min before it were finished to get some of the flavor into the soup.  Bottom line is... the flavors were great, it was worth the effort and I look forward to making it again after my next prime rib. Thank you Emily!

I used the pressure cooker (20 min) for the bones. Added quick cook barley and it was an amazing soup that disappeared.

This recipe needed adjustments. Added red wine and Kitchen Bouquet to make broth richer. Also used Portabello Mushrooms, not button, and added onions, carrots & garlic to give it more depth. Definitely time consuming but well worth it. Served with crusty Artisan Bread and we couldn't get enough.

VERY good soup!  I did start with sauteing chopped onion and celery in butter, then added the prime rib, beef stock; added carrots and two potatoes. I already had rosemary, garlic & thyme coated on my prime rib from the day before, so that added wonderful flavor.  Thanks Emily!  This was so good and a great way to use up every bit of that expensive Christmas prime rib!  KEEPER!

This was great!  I added some more veggies, used two cans of beef broth and a some steak seasoning.  A great use of left-over prime rib when you just can't eat another sandwich.

I used a 7 rib 18 pounder for New Years. It was easy to cook and came out great. I cooked down all the ribs in a crock pot overnight. Pull the bone from the meat and let the meat cool too. Its easier to seperate the fats and connective tissues when cold. I also doubled the broth and added some chicken bouillion (shhh..dont tell the ribs), also a few each celery and carrots. Turned out great and made myself feel good about spending so much on the initial roast. Enjoy

I liked it a lot. My 18 year old son, however, went nuts. He ate everything besides the small bowl I had. I asked him how many stars he'd give it out of five and he said, "twelve constellations". This recipe rocks. Enough said.

A little time consuming, but it's worth it!  I used barley instead of the potato, just because that's what I had handy. Came out excellent!

My husband and son just raved about this soup!  The only thing I found was, it took too long for it to cook down.  Leave plenty of time to cook this! Worth it!

I'm making this right now and so far, it smells delicious. Question - what is with the nutritional information?? I really can't see that it would be 1800 calories for ANY soup, let alone a broth based soup that you've skimmed the fat off of?

This takes a long time to cook so make sure you plan for it.  It's a great way to use up leftover prime rib, and good flavors,  but I felt like it needed some more vegetables in it to make it heartier.

While my husband thought it was too salty, the rest of us loved it.  My teenager had 4 bowls for dinner.  I added carrots to this recipe and extra steak.  I will make this again next time we have prime rib.

Made this in my Ninja Crock Pot. Used our leftover Prime Rib and bones from Christmas eve and let it cook done ALL day. Sauteed some shallots and fresh garlic then added 2 32 oz cartons of Beef stock.  About an hour before I served it I added carrots, potatoes and mushrooms.  Added a dash of Worcestershire sauce, fresh rosemary and black pepper.   No need for other seasonings as the Prime Rib was already pre-seasoned when I bought it.   I did add flour to thicken it up.   AMAZING flavor!   Definitely want to make this again.

This was so awesome!  We had been at a friends house on New Years Eve and ate prime rib, they had bones left and I said I would look for a recipe to use them.  My only wish is that it made more!  Shared some with our friends from New Years they are saving all their future bones for us! Time consuming recipe, but definitely worth it!

This recipes is great and is a great`way to use up left over standing rib roast. I followed as written and added some extra pieces of meat.  It came out a bit salty. It may have been the brand on broth I use so I would advise waiting to season with salt until half way through final simmer, then add if necessary. Overall this was fantastic and I am psyched I found something good to do with left over roast.  I finally feel like I used everything.

Terrifc Soup! Skipped the potato and added 4 small sliced yellow onions.  Hubby said it was perfect and any other additions would detract from the original flavoring of the Prime Rib stock.

4-2-2018  ~After all my years of cooking and baking, it still is remarkable to me what one can put on the dinner table that is nourishing, delicious, and inexpensive all at once.  A soup like this is a case in point.  Think about it – a couple of bones (prime rib or otherwise), simmered for hours, with everything but the kitchen sink (whatever you have on hand basically) added to the broth to make a substantial soup.  I’ve been making soup like this for decades, and I followed this recipe loosely.  I find no need to reduce the broth.  If you’ve got “good bones,” pun intended, and enough of them, there is no need for that.  I did use roasted prime rib bones, some meat attached, along with celery and its leaves, parsley, a few cloves of garlic, a little salt, a bit of tomato paste and a glug of red wine.  Something I tried that was new for me was to make this in the slow cooker and while it turned out perfectly, I really didn’t find any particular advantage to that.  Not a fan of potatoes in soup, after straining the broth I used an appropriate pasta for soup instead, along with some odds and ends I had in the fridge – mushrooms, carrots, zucchini and celery.  This was a home run tonight, as it always is.

Really great!  We do a 7rib roast so I freeze the ribs in 2 packages (3 in one, 4 in another), then make this recipe on 2 different occasions.  I also double the beef broth to 4 cups, add 3 chopped carrots and 1 celery stalk chopped.  I do not adjust the salt or pepper, it's seasoned enough.  Great recipe, thanks!

This is the 2nd time that I have made this with our leftover Christmas Eve prime rib. Very good! I cut the mushrooms in half, added sauted onion, extra beef, added the au jus from the meat and served with a homemade crusty bread (Easy Whole Wheat Bread) from this site. Amazing!

What a great way to use the leftover bones and meat! My family loved it.  Based on someone else's comments, I used the crock pot and put the bones in with beef broth for 6 hours. Then, I cooked it as written. I didn't used any extra salt or pepper since it was already in my prime rib.  I also had a bowl of shredded raw  lettuce to top off the soup to add a crispness/freshness to the soup. I also bought a loaf of roasted garlic bread to accompany this hearty meal. I would do it again. There was nothing wasted from the prime rib. Thanks!

This was fantastic!!! I froze the bones from our Christmas Prime Rib until I was ready to make soup. I don't know why some reviewers complained about the time it takes, good soup takes time!!! I substituted barley instead of potatoes, other than that, pretty much followed the recipe. I will never throw out prime rib bones again, no matter how tired I am!

This recipe was good.  I was confused by the picture, it looks like onions and carrots were added too.  I did add the extra vegetables plus celery.  It is yummy and even better the next day.

I recently purchased a small rib roast and had the butcher slice it into steaks.  As I've had my eye on this recipe for some time now, it was finally time to do something with those bones.  I used my toaster oven to roast them first and then followed directions to make the soup.  I did sweat a finely minced mirepoix ,  several teaspoons of tomato paste and a dash of herbes de provence (had neglected to use a rub on the bones) in a bit of butter before adding to the the stock.   Another addition was some farro that I had on hand.   It's amazing how much meat can be salvaged from these bones.  Not as surprising is the fat content.  The step requiring the reduced broth to be refrigerated until the fat congeals should not be dismissed.  I do like the idea to simmer the bones overnight in a slow cooker.  I'll probably give that a try the next time.  This soup was a solid 5 stars for us.  Great soup!

I added 3/4 C frozen pearl onions with the potatoes. Then 3/4 C carrots along with the mushrooms. With 5 minutes left, I added the frozen peas, which gave it great color.

Found this recipe this year and decided to try it after Christmas (bought an extra rib or two and saved the bones) -- Oh.My.Goodness....this soup is amazing and I WILL be making it again. If I could give it 10 stars I would! The broth was amazing and the left over beef in it was so, SO, good.  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

Amazing!  My husband and kids loved this soup!  I added onions, carrots some soy, red wine and west. sauce.  Also green onion tops and green onion whites.  They dipped some cut white onions into milk and then flour and fried them for topping of the soup.  My husband swears this was better than the prime rib itself!

I have made this the past 2 years and am going to make it again this year.  Love it, and the whole family does too! My father-in-laws birthday is Dec 26, so I make a Prime Rib Roast for Christmas and then make this delious soup the next day for his birthday.  I feed about 12-16 people, and they all love it!

I made this but did one thing different. I seared the steaks real fast on a grill with steak seasoning. It gave that char-smoke taste to the soup and added a another depth of flavor. Great use for left over steak.

I also had too much water left over after simmering the prime ribs, but that was ok as I like a soup instead of a stew. Only change I made was added barley per family request.  I had some wonderful dried porcini mushrooms on hand that really added to the flavor as well. And couldn't help myself with some of my dried rosemary as we love it on prime rib! Thanks Emily for a great recipe.

Followed recipe to a tee, except for beef broth. Only had 1 cup, used two bullion cubes and added 1 cup of water and reduced. Very good, everyone enjoyed it! Will make again, next time we have Prime Rib.

This soup was delicious! The recipe is a good starter, but I made some additions, per some of the other reviews I read. I added red wine and kitchen bouquet to make the broth richer, and cut up a couple of carrots to add too. I used portobello mushrooms  and sauteed celery and onion in butter to add. When the vegetables were done, I added cornstarch to thicken a bit. VERY tasty!

The soup is delicious but there was confusion as to what to do with the stock in the pot after Step 1. We tossed it out and realized we probably should've used it.  Made additional beef broth and it turned out great.

This is a great use of a very expensive cut. I really like using the bones to enrich the stock. I did add onion, garlic, and Worcestershire as well as a bit of Italian herb mix. We enjoyed it immensely. Next time I want to add some mixed vegetables along with potatoes, carrots and mushrooms. Thanks for a great recipe to use those costly ‘leftovers’.

I was skeptical because this recipe calls for just under 3 cups of liquid (under because you skim the fat off the 1 cup of homemade broth)   Since you can't really buy 2 cups of beef broth, I added 2 cans.  The consistency came out perfect.    

It is odd that the picture shows carrots but none are called out in the recipe, however, I think this person has provided an excellent base recipe which would be good with the addition any combination of soup parts;  carrot, celery, shallots, etc....  

I decided to make it as-is and found it to be fantastic!  Beef, potato and mushroom have a very distinct flavor and this is spot on.    The only thing I did different, besides the additional broth, was to garnish with fresh grated horseradish and Parmesan cheese along with the chive.  Oh, and I added a little more leftover prime rib besides just the bone meat.

Not sure how to rate this? My husband like it but the kids would not touch it. To me it was missing a lot of flavors, maybe add an onion, garlic, carrots, celery and barley or small pasta. I do not think I will make this again but I liked the idea of saving the ribs for another use.

The smell in my kitchen was unbelievable! I made this using leftover bones. The butcher cut me steaks from my prime rib roast and left the bone telling me it was great for soup. I followed the directions but was short on time so I made some changes. I but the raw rib bones in a pot of hot water adding two sodium free beef bullion cubes to it. While I boiled that on high I chopped up my potatoes and carrots( diced them). Next I chopped up an onion and  sautéed it in butter and garlic with the carrots in a seperate pan.  I then turned down the temperature of my stock from high to a little above low when I could see some of the bone sticking out. I added a cup of hot water from microwave to cover bone. After about 2 1/2 hours I took liquid off stove strained it. Placed it in my garage to cool quickly( after 15 minutes it was slightly cool and I skimmed doff some of the fat) placed it back in pot added my onions, carrots, potatoes, and a can of au jus to the liquid. Brought it back to rolling boil for ten minutes added some pepper. Turned it to simmer placed my left over prime rib in it which was diced and placed the lid on this soup. It simmered for another half hour to 45 minutes. Served with crusty rolls and it was the best soup ever!

This was delicious. My husband wanted a stew so II added a roux. Also a splash of cream. Was DELICIOUS. 
Mushrooms gave it a real nice flavor.

Too much pepper. I had to add lemon juice, Beef broth, and heavy cream to try to fix it.
