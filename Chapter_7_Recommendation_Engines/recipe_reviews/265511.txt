This is delicious! Prepared as is and was wonderful. I used a hand blender to puree all the ingredients except for the tomatoes which I added at the end. This will be my go to dip to bring to many gatherings! Try it you will not regret it!

Tasty!  Very creamy - made as directed except no jalapeno or cumin - wanted a more mild taste. Next time might use one tomato IN and mix another after blending.

Good stuff. Nice twist between hummus and guacamole. Did recipe exactly as written.
