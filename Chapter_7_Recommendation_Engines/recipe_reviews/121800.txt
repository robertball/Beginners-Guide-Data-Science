Oh this is SO good--tastes like apple pie without the crust! It could do with a little less sugar, depending on the size of your apples. I used honeycrisps and doubled the recipe--added a dash of cinnamon. Served with Apple Stuffed Chicken Breast from this site, and the combo of flavors was incredible!

I made caramelized apple dices for a dessert apple pizza. I took a lot of liberties with this recipe: I used 4 apples (peeled & diced), a little less butter and a bit more sugar, and a lot of cinnamon. This made a nice cinnimon "sauce" at the bottom of the pan - I thickened it by adding a little bit of quick oats.  The apple pizza was quite delicious!  Thank you for the inspiration, Helen!

I used 1 tablespoon of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of the 1/4 c. brown sugar and a Honey Crisp apple. Yummy!!!!!!

Extremely easy and quite tasty, but way too sweet for a side dish!  If I ever made this again, I would either reduce the brown sugar or serve it as a dessert.  I used Granny Smiths, and they worked well.

(I haven't tried this recipe yet!) Hello, Can anyone tell me if this recipe can be canned for later use?  If so, does it need to be canned in a syrup of some kind?  Thank you :)  I am making xmas presents with canned fruit and this apple recipe sounds delicious!!
