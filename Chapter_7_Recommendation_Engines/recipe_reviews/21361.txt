I made this for lunch one day, and I did modify it a bit, based on personal taste preferences.  First of all, I double-dipped the tomato slices...flour, egg wash (1 egg, w/some milk), and then flour again.  It created more of a crunchy texture which I really love.  For the gravy, I only added about a teaspoon of brown sugar, because 2 Tbsp. seems like an awful lot.  I guess it's a matter of taste, but I liked it with less sugar.  But, it turned out very good, and I will make it again!

I remembered fried red tomatoes and gravy that my mom used to make and was excited to see this recipe. It wasn't quite what I remembered. The brown sugar made the gravy way too sweet.

This was a very strange side dish.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It was also very sweet. Different, but I won't be making it again.

I saute'd a sliced onion in oil first,then placed in same pan with saute'd tomatoes. I breaded tomatoes with Italian bread crumbs before frying and mixed 2 T cornstarch to half and half before adding to skillet after removing tomatoes. Very substantial dish and a good way to use tomatoes that are ripe

The flavor was good, but the tomatoes turned out mushy. I think I'll try this again with fresh, slightly green garden tomatoes this summer.

My grandmom made this for years, then my mom and now me! The only 2 changes I make is no brown sugar and add a little spicy brown mustard to the sauce for a great tang! Yummy with a ham slice and corn fritters.
