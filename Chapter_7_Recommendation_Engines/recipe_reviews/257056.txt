I agree with the recipe poster, this is delicious and it's easy to put together.  I followed the directions exactly except instead of putting the batter all in one pan, I made 4 small loaves. Probably took about 40 minutes to bake.  For my 2 c dried fruit, I used a combination of currants, raisins and dried cranberries.  Best served thickly slathered with butter and a cup of tea.  Mmm Mm good.  Suggestion: really grease well the bottom of the pan.  Barmbrack is an old Irish recipe, usually made with yeast as the rising agent, but I like this version because it's so quick to put together.
