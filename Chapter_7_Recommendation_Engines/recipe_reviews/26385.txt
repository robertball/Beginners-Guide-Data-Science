Wow - this really does taste just like what my mom used to make!  I cooked the chicken for 2 hours at which point the meat was falling off the bones, so I stopped then.  It took a lot longer than 30 minutes to get the fat to congeal (probably about 2 hrs) so the overall cooking time was about the same.  I didn't add the second tsp of salt as the bouillon is already so salty.  Definitely a keeper!

Good but not great. And overly complicated. If you're making stock, why the bouillon? (Or vice versa.) 4 hours is *FOREVER* to simmer chicken. It'll be done in less than one. It adds salt twice (Thrice if you include the bouillon.) Always add salt *LAST* or it will make things tough (Even rice). You start with fresh parsley and switch to dry (???) when once is enough. You add celery twice when once will do. Still, it makes good soup. But simpler would be better. ;-)

Oh boy, for how sick we have been over here (eg: I just went out with the girls, and I'm still sober enough to be typing (HA!) :)  This is a good, classic soup that hit the spot for all of us this week.  Nice & easy on the tummy.  I used fine egg noodles, but could have gone with the rice as well.  Thanks for the comfort & good recipe Robbie!

This was my first time ever making chicken soup from scratch, and although I had my doubts that it would really be *that* much better than soup from a can -- I was very pleasantly surprised.  This soup was absolutely delicious, and the smell was heavenly (my daughter came home from school and asked "what smells so wonderful?").  I used egg noodles but followed the recipe pretty much as written.  Note: it was pretty salty, but we like our soup that way.

This super soup was a family pleaser!  My kids really liked it - my husband too!  Only changes - added 3 chopped garlic gloves, used canned carrots and peas because I was out of fresh!  And omitted the salt at the end.  Will make again very soon!

So I know exactly what to do next time:  Cook egg noodles in the pot, rinse, put away till you need them. In same soup pot,cook approx 8 chicken thighs (after removing skin) in water - bring to a boil, simmer for 25 minutes or so. Remove them, cool them, pick meat off. Put pot w/broth in fridge, wait for fat to rise to the top, then remove. Return pot to stove, add chopped carrots, celery and onions, bay leaf, celery seed, pepper, 3 bouillon cubes, marjoram, parsley, & a little bit of thyme. Bring this to a boil.  Reduce heat and add chicken and noodles - let this simmer for a good 2 or 3 hours. Remove bay leaf and enjoy!  Soooooo good!

This was a very easy and delicious soup.  I actually tweeked a little.  I hate celery, so I left that out and added potatoes and peas.  It was delicious. Will definitely make again.

This soup is really good. I usually make up a giant batch of broth with a rotisserie chicken and I don't measure the veggies. Recently I used leaks. Thanks for a great recipe.

Super flavorful and super yummy.  I would omit that last tsp of salt and maybe just salt to taste next time.  I also just used chicken thighs, as I hate the thought of cutting up a chicken.  And I cooked whole wheat egg noodles and added them when the soup was done.  mmmmmm.  supergreat soup.

I have made this receipe several times and it always comes out good. I usually add a little dill which gives it a nice taste. We make a meal out of it and I make Matzo Balls as well. 

Believe it or not Manichewitz makes the best matzo ball mix. They are light and tasty.

Excellent soup! My only change would be to cook the rice before adding it to the soup otherwise it will absorb too much liquid and you end up with chicken rice casserole.

Don't you just love comfort food... and this is the best.  I would say that this recipe does not need any carbs (assuming you're cutting back). It stands on its own. As to the chicken... don't boil for 4 hours, just simmer for about 2. Then remove the meat from the bones, return the bones to the stock, and simmer for another hour. If you don't want to stick the stock in the frig, and then wait an hour or longer for the fat to separate... strain the hot liquid through a China Cap, and then use a fat separator to remove the grease. Oh...  add more veggies. Try some peas and some white-button mushrooms, or whatever you like. I spooned the hot soup over some thinly sliced napa cabbage. Then I thinly sliced some white button mushrooms, and placed them on top before serving... EXCELLENT.

Would love to give this 5 stars, but as-is it's too salty! I ended up adding several more cups of water to dilute the saltiness. In the second step I added extra carrots and celery for nutrition's sake, and a few cloves of garlic (I was trying to chase away a cold). I also only had fresh parlsey so I just added what I had and it all came out great! Thanks for sharing this recipe, I've always wanted to know how to make "real" chicken soup from "scratch"! It was well worth the work and time involved!

As for flavor, it nice, as for amount of chicken to water...not so great. I followed to a T and even at a simmer, my liquid ratio decreased and had loads of fatty oil then liquid. I know I used almost exact amount of weight on the chicken because I used a scale to weigh it. And I was so disappointed to having way way to much meat and not enough liquids. I was glad I had extra chicken stock prepared from a previous recipe to compensate for this recipe. I can't begin to figure out why it did that, but 4 hours was way way to long, my meat was soo tender that when combining liquids and vegetables and chicken to the 2nd part of this recipe was very thick with shredded meat that the liquid still got lost and putting the rice on top of it just soaked it right up. I'm not sure if I'd make again honestly but if I did..I sure wouldn't use 3 pounds of meat to 2 quarts of water. Sorry, that is way to much. I wasn't pleased with the overall out come of the recipe.

VERY GOOD!  I followed the recipe substituting chicken broth for the bouillon and omitting the salt as that can be added individually to taste as desired.  Thank you Robbie Rice for another VERY GOOD recipe!  (Also loved the Chicken Pot Pie IX!)

This was a great recipe to get me started and able to use ingredients I had on hand.  I used a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store deli which I believe cut back on the fat.  I placed all ingredients in a crock pot except for rice and let them cook on high for 3 hours then reduced heat to low for 3 more hours.  Strain liquid with cheesecloth and chill to allow fat to rise to the top. There really shouldn't be much fat to skim.  Return liquid along with deboned chicken, mixed veggies, and cooked wild rice.  I did not add the herbs and spices a second time as this recipe suggested.  The soup turned out rich and flavorful.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Great clasic soup recipe! Followed ingredients except the celery seed (didn't have any). The cooking times were off as others noted. Chicken was cooked within two hours, broth took longer than two hours to cool to the point of removing the fat. I couldn't wait so I skimmed off some of the fat and left the rest. I added potatoes instead of noodles. My husband (the typical soup maker in our family had seconds). Thanks.

I'm not a big fan of chicken soup but this was definetly a "keeper". Look out for the small bones though, they can be hard to winnow out.

I've been cooking since I was Five years old. (my grandmother an Italian imiagrant in the early 1900's taught me). But for some reason never cooked chicken soup until today and must say that this was the easiest recipe to follow with the best results I've ever incured. Thanks Robbie Rice

Really the best chicken soup i have ever had.  It feels strange to do all the cooking only to strain the vegtables out and throw them away but it really makes a zesty and flavorful stock. Fresh ingrediants make all the difference and a young, smaller chicken packs more flavor.

The spices in this soup are perfect.  We love it with egg noodles.  My husband asks for it at least once a month.

Edited to add: the first half of this recipe is my go-to anytime I need to make chicken stock.  Like I said before the spices are perfection!

Yes!  I had tried homemade before and it seems like I just had to keep adding more cubes to make it taste like anything.  This is so amazingly good. Did not add rice, but egg noodles.  Thank you!

My family likes dark meat, so I used boneless chicken thighs and chicken soup base rather than bouillon.  I did not add any extra salt since the soup base, although less salty than bouillon, still had enough sodium to flavor the soup.   The stock was quite flavorful after three hours and my meat actually shredded when I tried to cut it into chunks.   Next time I would add more rice because the half cup got lost in the soup a bit. Delicious!

My first attempt at ever making chicken soup - it was DELICIOUS!  Only change I made was to add dill and parsnips (something my grandma has always done).  I also found it really salty - so next time I'm not adding any salt. :)

This is the best chicken soup I've ever made & I've been cooking for 50+ years!  I use one chicken but double everything else. I use orzo instead of rice, but I divide up the soup first, freeze some & don't add the orzo until we're ready to eat it.  I always make this the day before we want to eat it - the flavors really "gel" overnight. I sprinkle mine with a little grated parm, my husband skips it.  It's simmering now - smells delish!

I give this recipe  a five star rating. I love homemade chicken soup.  My wife and I are very busy at our careers and I sometime purchase a cooked chicken for dinner. After dinner, I remove the meat from the chicken and place the bones in a slow cooker with celery, carrots and onion.  I slow cook it all day while I  am at work.  In the evening I add about two cups of additional stock and make my soup from that. Additional chopped carrots, and celery with the left over chicken makes the soup complete.  I add the noodles cooked seperately so as not to absorb all the broth.

I love this recipe.  I make it several times throughout the winter, it keeps our family warm on cold days.  Sometimes I make it with rice instead of noodles.

sorry, but this was a waste of my turkey carcass. all that bouillon made it taste like it came from a packet. i was expecting much more of a homemade taste. this disappointed me. maybe there was just too much bouillon? i had to add another 2 qts of water after the soup was finished to make it edible

I found this recipe to be overly salty. Suggest substituting low sodium chicken stock for the bouillon. 1 cube = about 1/3 daily sodium, therefore 6 is quite alot. 1 teaspoon of salt is not needed. Suggest salt to taste. Other than that, it was fine.

Very tasty recipe.  I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken, which is most likely why I was missing a little flavor, but it was still tasty.  My husband enjoyed it, it thought it was too much "stuff" and not enough broth, so next time I will make an additional pot of stock and freeze what I don't use.  Thanks fro sharing!

I used this recipe for my first soup making experience.  It wasn't real easy, but I was able to come out with a soup that everyone now wants me to make more of.  I feel the recipe is a bit vague on some things, but overall it works very well, and tastes even better!

My hairdresser donated a kidney to his sister (and he's diabetic!) so on my first appointment when he came back, which also turned out to be his birthday, I brought him some of this soup.  He LOVED it. He's raved about it every appointment since. He keeps reminding me his birthday is in October and he's expecting more. Like everyone with every recipe, I tweaked it a little and don't even measure anything any more, but I use about half water, half canned broth for extra flavor, use boneless skinless breasts to cut down on the fat, don't cook it as long, and go the egg noodle route.  Well done Robbie--thank you from me and my hairdresser!!

I have never made home made chicken soup before but after trying this recipe I will never eat it from a can again!!  This was fantastic and so easy to make.  Followed the recipe as is except substituted Aicni de Pepe shape pasta instead of rice.  Gave some to my father in law who said it tasted even better then my mother in law's recipe...shhhh don't tell her!!!

this is by far the BEST chicken soup recipe i have ever had! i did alter the original recipe a little bit, i found that there was not enough broth to my liking so i doubled the amount of water and the seasonings, i also used pre-cooked rice because when i put it in uncooked all of the broth got soaked up.  happy cooking!

Very good, very simple. I never add boullion to my broth but tried it this time. Good but 1/2 as much would have been better. Also, no need to cook 4 hours: the broth is ready easily in 2. Thanks for keeping it real!

I made this for 25 to serve and sell at a high school football game, I thought it would go over well since the cold weather was here...it was a hit...sold out and was asked to make it again at our next home game.The only thing I changed is I did not add salt as the chicken broth granules takes care of that, I did not add the additional onion at the end and I used medium size egg noodles. Of course the next time I will make it for 40!!!!!

Very flavorful chicken soup. Used thin egg noodles instead of rice. Will use egg noodles again, but thicker noodles would be better.

My family really enjoyed this recipe and my 5 year old daughter kept complimenting me on the soup.  I did the broth/chicken separately from the soup and skipped the boullion to reduce the saltiness flavor.  I always freeze the broth to skim the fat more quickly.  I saved some of the chicken for other uses and omitted the celery from the soup itself.  Otherwise followed the recipe closely.  It was fairly thick with the rice, so if you prefer it more brothy, you should reduce the rice.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was just wonderful. I used chicken thigh-leg quarters instead of whole chicken and matzo balls (using Manischewitz mix as suggested) instead of rice. Chilled the strained broth overnight & it made it easy to skim fat from top. Because I like a more juicy rather than chunky meat soup, the recipe yielded a good bit of boiled chicken to use in other recipes.

This soup was wonderful!
I added a tbs of minced garlic. Seemed like alot of chicken and not much broth so I added 8 cups more water and 4 more bullion cubes. Used little star pasta instead of rice. Will definitely make this soup again!

Very good recipe.  I used chicken thighs and legs and added a can of chicken broth along with the water and bouillon cubes.  I also added some sage to the thyme/salt and pepper.  Very good soup!  Came out delicious.  Thank you for the recipe

This is a great "get-well soup". I make this often and it disappears quickly. I always use Kluski noodles and add more carrots and peppercorn. It's the best chicken soup.

I have made this soup several times. I don't do the two sets of veggies. I just chop the onion carrots and celery in with the chicken pieces and bay leaves and cook until the meat falls off the bones. I then add the bouillon and the rest of the seasonings and cook for another 30 minutes or so. I usually use noodles instead of rice. I love this recipe and it is so flavorful. My husband and I love the leftovers too.

I changed a few things: I used 2 quarts of water, 1 quart chicken broth, 3 bullion, 1 cup uncooked rice, cooked only 2 hours (plenty of time) and added more seasoning to improve taste. I like my soup hearty and with more seasoning to kick it up a notch, so those who don't, I wouldn't use my last two suggestions.

I used kosher salt, which tends to be milder than table salt; even so this turned out a little too salty.

Skimming the grease was a pain.  I agree with another rater that the 4-hour cook time was not needed.

Overall, this soup is definitely not worth the time it takes.   Next time, I'll find a simpler recipe.

This recipe is so good and so flavorful.  I am single, so I ate on it all week and never got tired of it.  I decided to use something different than bullion.  I used the equivalent of a paste I had purchased called Better Than Bullion.  It was so good that after a week of eating it, I still want to make another batch!

This is JUST LIKE my Mom's chicken soup...from the preparation to the end product.   The only thing my Mom added was barley & lentils.  Since neither my husband nor I can have those 2 ingredients, it didn't matter.  As for the comment about needing to make boullion cubes...back in the day, that's what they used...my only change was using the already prepared chicken STOCK (not broth), 2 packages each pkg contains 4 cups and 4 cups water.   The rest was absolutely the same.  We don't use chicken with skin, so skinless is fine, but you will still have to skim it since chicken is a fatty protein.  For those of you who never tried Motzah Balls...Manischevitz makes a prepackaged mix...you just add water...stir it up and form the balls by hand.....after you strain your soup and add the new ingredients, wait for the soup to finish the final 30 mins cooking and then drop (gently) the formed balls into the soup.  They only take 5 mins and your soup is done....DELISH!!!    I LOVE ALLRECIPES!!!!

Simplified this tremendously and came out great. I cooked the chicken in a slow cooker for 4 hours in 4 quarts of vegetable broth adding peppercorns and parsley. Since broths vary in the veggies they use, I made sure I used a brand with most of the ingredients called for in the recipe, in this case Chef's Cupboard brand. I followed the rest of the recipe as written except I omitted the bullion cubes.

The family has been fighting off some colds, so we wanted to go for the real deal chicken soup. This was perfect! So simple, my 2 year old and 5 year old were able to help. Nice flavor without being too spicy. I love the noodles too! They don't get mushy like egg noodles can. We will be making this one again. Thanks for sharing!

This had a great flavor, but took FOREVER to make.  I started it at 4:30 in the afternoon and I was still up at 12:30 in the morning finishing it off so I could go to bed.  I only cooked the broth an hour and a half, too.  The rice was completely lost in the soup.  The flavor was excellent, but due to taking so long, I will hesitate to make this again.  I live in Colorado, so I don't know if that made it take longer (water boils at a lower temperature here), but it was just too much time.

This is by far the BEST chicken soup I've ever made! It was a little salty when it was finished so I had to add a little water. Next time I'll add salt last. Also, I didn't use a whole chicken, I used a ready made rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store and added that after the stock was done. This cut the cooking time more than half and it still tastes great! Overall, I would DEFINITELY recommend this recipe!

Now this is how "true" chicken soup is made. In my way of thinking, the broth must be made with the whole chicken to achieve the full rich flavor of homemade chicken soup. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

Yummm!! This is my go to chicken soup recipe from now on...excellent flavor!! Made this last night for my boyfriend who is sick, he raved and raved over this soup (thank you Robbie!!). I kinda ate two bowls ("taste testing") before he could get home.  I kicked it up a bit with some jalapenos, Adobo seasoning, fresh cilantro, garlic cloves, and chipotle chili powder in the first step (omitted the buillon). In the second step, I left the diced chicken out and added it back to the soup after the rice and veggies had cooked. I did have to add some additional stock at the end to thin it out. I just went to my freezer and thawed out some corn stock for a little more depth. Oh, I used thighs since that was all I had on hand. I plan to make big batches of this to freeze when I catch chicken on sale.

I'm giving this 2 1/2*. Hubby said what it needs is = FLAVOUR. If you are really sick and can't even stomach the idea of eating food this would be for you. It is bland. Like hospital broth bland. Dd said, 'did you add any flavour'. Yes, I added extra bouillon, worcestishire, hot sauce, more herbs, salt etc. "Oh," she said. "You can't tell."

This is a great chicken soup recipe.  We substituded dried chives for the parsley and the minced onion.  We like garlic and added three cloves of fresh garlic.  Excellent!

Very, very good. I only used bone-in chicken breast and did not cook as long. Now let's see if my 10 year old will eat it.

This is one of my favorite recipes to date from this website!  I have made it so many times this winter that I've lost count because people have requested it again and again. I have made a few variations to the recipe; I added fresh garlic.  Sometimes, I will use boneless chicken breasts and chicken broth as well as a stick of butter depending upon the amount of time that I have.  I have also substituted egg noodles instead of the rice at times.  Whichever way I've doone it, it doesn't matter!  The results have been the same and people have raved over this soup.  Thanks for an absolutely wonderful recipe!

Turned out great for me.  Followed the recipe most of the way, with a few changes.  (1)  Didn't add the salt.  The 6 boullion cubes were salt enough.  (2)  Used a 3 lb package of bone-in chicken thighs.  Only needed to cook them for 1 hour and 45 minutes, the meat was falling off the bone.  Otherwise, followed as written.  Best chicken soup I've ever had.

Ok Cooks, this recipe is delish! I started with a rotisserie chicken (herb I found was the best) because I just can't cut up a whole chicken :(  I followed the directions exactly (the first few times) except this time I only did about a 1/4 teaspoon of salt and just through all the ingredients into the pot at once (except the rice--added at the end). Then I added the rice, simmered for a half hour and wallah...perfect Chicken and rice soup!

This was yummy I used chicken stock I had already and didn't use any bullion. I found out I was out of celery so used celery salt instead. It was really tasty for a chilly day.

I made this according to the directions except that I  used 1/2 the salt called for and didn't have celery seeds.  This was wonderful - thank you!

Absolutely delicious!  I used skinless boneless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken (not much fat to skim off!), added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, and subbed homemade dumplings for the rice.

So Easy So Good!!! Best chicken soup I've made.  I had a chicken left over from last night and some frozen chicken stock from a previous recipe.  I made just as described but only boiled my stock for two hours because the chicken from last night had so many spices in it and bc I added my own stock.  I used 1 full cup of rice and did not add the extra tsp of salt.  It turned out fabulous!!! Thank you!

My first attempt at homemade chicken soup and it was great!  I used chicken broth instead of boulion, reduced the salt, 1/3 substitution of dried parsley for fresh, and used leeks instead of onions because my bf hates them.  Like another reviewer, the chicken was falling off the bones after 2 hrs, and it took several hours for the fat to separate in the fridge, so I let the stock sit overnight.  Perfect for both of us with colds!

Very tasty. I think because of all the herbs used, when boiling the chicken. I did just a small change to the recipe, I added one more herb that grows in BG and, after the chicken was boiled, I strained the broth, added the veggies. After they were ready, I pureed the soup and then added the cooked chicken and rice. It had a nice yellow-orange colour. After it was ready I added three spoons of cooking cream.

Used thighs only (I don't have the patience for picking out all of the bones otherwise) and chicken soup base as we like a strong taste and added more of the veggies, just personal preferences.  Went with the noodles.  Really, really tasty soup.  This is the only one I'll use from now on.  Hubby was un-sick in no time.  Great recipe, thanks!
