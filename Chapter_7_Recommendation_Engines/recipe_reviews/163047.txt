This salad is okay, but I don't like black olives and I thought it was missing something. I substituted Kalamata olives for the black olives, used basil instead of cilantro, and added chopped cucumber. You can also add a can of garbanzo beans to make it a vegetarian main dish. We topped with feta cheese, for a real Mediterranean flair. With the modifications, it was great!

This is a very good healthy salad.  I decided to get "creative", and I added a large spoonful of a great artichoke tapenade (Gertie's) that I got at Costco....it was a huge jar & I was looking for more ways to use it up. The second time I made this salad I  used  roasted red peppers (in the jar)  in place of the dried tomatoes in the dressing.  Yum, yum.  A great salad to experiment with!

Excellent salad. Someone mentioned having the feeling that something was missing.  I agree, I added a 1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese and a little bit of salt and it worked great for me.

Delicious!  I doubled the dressing,  used basil instead of cilantro,  kalamata olives,  and made it one day in advance.  Before serving,  I added feta cheese and some finely diced red bell pepper for colour.

I've been looking for more ways to include healthy grains into my family's diet, and this salad worked perfectly as a side. It was yummy, satisfying, and easy to make!  I'm going to have the leftovers for lunch today. 
I didn't change anything, although the olives I bought at the deli were marinated in olive oil and mixed with pine nuts which was a nice addition to the salad.
I might add some chili pepper flakes next time, just to give it a little kick.

One of my favorite recipes.  Barley is a nice change of pace for a salad.  I add chicken and feta cheese.

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly and threw in a handfull of pine nuts at the end. I thought it was delish just after making and look forward to tomorrow since every one said it gets better. Thanks for a great recipe.

Diced green pepper and red onion made great additions to this recipe. Better after 1 day once the flavors meld.

This was a great recipe idea. I put my own spin on it because I wanted noticeable chunks of sun dried tomatoes in every bite. I used a good basil pesto, thinned with a bit of the olive oil and balsamic, for the dressing, omitted the cilantro, and stirred in chopped sun dried tomatoes along with the olives. Delicious! I might try some finely chopped red onion too next time - and there will definitely be a next time!

Pretty good I used basil as well because I do not care for cilantro very much.  I agree it needs something so I will have to experiment!

I first followed the recipe exactly and then started messing around with i (more garlic, cilantro and black olives).  The great thing is you can use any kind of grain (I like either th ebarley or brown rice) and teh longer it sits the better it gets..  Everyone who tries this LOVES it!

A great base salad for eating all by itself, or by adding some of the items suggested by others (e.g. feta cheese, etc.).

This is a great salad. I found this recipe when I was trying to find something to do with a box of barley that wasn't soup. I mixed it up and took a taste before I placed it in the fridge and I was impressed with the flavor. I did add some feta cheese to it but what really kicked off was the mix of the olive oil and Balsamic vinegar. I will be making this again all summer long.

I really liked this salad!  It is hearty without being heavy.  Even my husband liked it.  I used chicken broth instead of the 2 tbsp of olive oil in the dressing.  I also added cooked peas and squash.  I will definitely make this again!

This is really flavorful.  I was liberal with the vinegar and garlic, but I don't think I needed to worry about enough flavor!  I think I'll try it with basil and feta next time.

This is a really easy salad to experiment with! I followed the recipe but added in red onion, red and yellow peppers, and cucumbers. I think feta would be a nice addition as well, but didn't have any on hand.

This salad was delicious! My grocer was out of sun dried tomatoes, so I used Classico Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto and added a little crushed garlic, balsamic vinegar and olive oil for the dressing. It was so good I am making a second batch to take to a friend.

I replaced the cilantro with 2 Tbsp of basil pesto and omitted 2 Tbsp of the olive oil. I also added some blue cheese. Overall, it is a delicious side of salad.

This was surprisingly good.  I didn't have barley but I used PC brand Brown Rice with Barley and Spelt.  Otherwise made as directed.  Even those in the house who aren't crazy about cilantro liked it.

This isn't a bad starter recipe, but it definitely needed some add in's after my initial tasting.  I chose to add an additional tbsp of vinegar, but used red wine for this (I had already used the balsamic), I used a two ounce can of sliced black olives and 2 ounces of sliced green olives with pimento's and about 1 tbsp of the olive brine.  I cooked the barley itself in beef broth for additional flavor.  When I was mixing the salad, I used about 1/2 a cup of chopped green pepper and added 1/4 to 1/2 a cup of parmesan cheese (I wish I had feta, but used what was on hand).  I had used oregano in the sun dried tomato puree and also threw in a handful of fresh spinach (extra veggies!).  At the end I added salt to taste in addition to the cilantro, though I used dried.

Absolutely loved it!  I was looking for a basic barley salad recipe to work from.  I used fresh basil instead of cilantro, substituted pitted Kalamata olives for canned black olives, and also added toasted pine nuts and cherry tomatoes.   I will definitely make this again!  Tips: (1) Be sure to use good quality balsamic; (2) I rehydrated the sun-dried tomatoes in a small amount of hot water for 10 minutes for smoother blending, using the liquid also.

This is a good salad. I loved the texture of the barley. I used kalamati olives and some garlic powder. It was a great side dish for steak night and I ate the leftovers for lunch.

I'm sorry, I just didn't care for this.  It seemed very bland, even though I added chopped cucumber and pine nuts.

I gave this 5 stars but  I did change a few things. I used canned drained diced tomatoes because I didn't have sun dried. I also didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and some bottled Italian dressing.  All in all it was very tasty and my family loved it. It was even better the next day......yum. I will surely make  this again.

I will be making this again. I used my ninja express chopper to purée the tomatoes and garlic. Couldn't find regular sun dried tomatoes, so I bought smoked sun dried tomatoes. Loved it! Cilantro was fine with me and texture was kind of cool.

I have to say that I was not impressed with this salad when I tried it a couple of hours after I made it.  But my mother had forced me to eat ice cream with her so my palate was probably not tuned in to healthy food!  However, when I had it for lunch the next day the flavors had melded and it was so much better.  I will probably make it again and try some of the herb flavored or garlic sundried tomatoes just to mix things up a bit.  Feta cheese does help too.

This is delicious! I've never cooked with barley so looked forward to trying out a new whole grain. I took a few of the suggested comments and added a little salt, used Kalmata olives instead of regular black olives, and added pesto to the purée. I didn't have fresh herbs so tossed in dried basil. I also only had rice vinegar on hand, which worked fine. Great result and will make again.

Followed the recipe as written . For the 2Tbs of olive oil used to blend, I substituted Balsamic vinaigrette dressing. 
I chilled the salad, and it's delish!

This is great!  I took the hint from MrsBoumendil and added pine nuts.  Delicious.  It doesn't say in the recipe if sun dried tomatoes in oil are used or just the dried one.  I used just the plain dried ones (much less calories) and it worked out perfectly.

Can't wait to eat some more.  Yummy!

This is a great salad and very easy to make!  I accidentally got quick cooking instead of regular barley.  I used 1 1/3 cups with 2 cups of water and only cooked it for 8 minutes.  This worked. Although, I am going to be more careful and buy regular pearl barley next time.
