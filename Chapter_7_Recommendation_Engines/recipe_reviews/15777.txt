Delicious. Have been looking for this recipe, so much like what my mother made. I changed it a bit, used less milk (only 1 1/3 cup, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 Tlbsp butter, and did not cook as long. Baked at 400 degrees for 8 min, then at 350 degrees for about 30 min. If it gets too brown, lower temp even more.  This is a TRUE RHUBARB CUSTARD PIE!!!

This pie was really tasty, but it made way too much filling for a 9inch pie crust.  I had to dump almost half of the milk mixture out for it to fit, even though I followed the recipe perfectly.

My husband really liked it but I thought it was too sweet (I like rhubarb to be tart).  I had to bake the pie an additional 20 minutes to get the custard to set.  The recipe doesn't specify how to beat the egg whites--glossy, soft peaks, stiff peaks?  I beat them 'til glossy.

Very nice, but I also found there was too much milk mixture. 1 - 1/4 cups milk would've been enough, I think.

Like another reviewer said, this custard tastes like my Mom used to make many years ago. I did not use a pie crust as I wanted a healthy version of rhubarb custard. I've made this twice and put the custard in a 6 x 9 pan and baked as indicated in the recipe. I bake it until the custard is golden brown and set in the middle. It takes quite some time to bake so be patient and wait till it is golden brown and set. MOST IMPORTANTLY.....add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the mixture prior to baking ! It really makes this recipe complete.  TY for a great recipe!

Turned out great... I used my own pastry recipe, which uses yogurt instead of ice water and vinegar and I put 2 tsp. of rose water in the filling. I find the rose flavour a perfect complement to rhubarb and strawberries.

Delicious! I used Dr. Oetker's  pie dough for the crust. I added 2 tbsp. sour cream instead of milk.  I didn't share it with anyone I ate it all myself!

The recipie didn't say how long to beat the egg whites so I went with soft peaks and it worked.  Would cut the milk back a bit next time as I needed an additional 20 minutes and in fact after that just turned the oven off and left the pie in the cooling oven for another 15 minutes.  Very tasty!
