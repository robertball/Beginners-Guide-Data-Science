This recipe surprised me. I made this for a family who requested this particular recipe. I'm not a fan of  cod fish unless it's beer battered and fried, but this came out great!
I followed 99% of the recipe as I did not have and could not find fish bouillon cubes, so I used chicken bouillon instead. I also used panko breadcrumbs which held up well as I reserved a uncooked portion of fish for the next day and the topping was still crunchy when it was baked.  This is a must try!

This was a great way to prepare fish. I had Spanish mackerel fillets. I sliced lemons very thinly and placed them under the fish for extra flavor and it really added some  punch.

This was the best fish I have ever had. I used fresh cod fillets and put thin lemon slices under them when I put them in the pan. I used chicken boullion instead of fish boullion. We had leftovers the next night and the fish tasted just as good the second time. I will use less salt next time because the boullion is salty. I will be making this dish a lot.

made this for the first time about 2 weeks ago. I followed every step, except for the fish bouillon which I did not have, Used chicken bouillon instead and placed salt and pepper on the cod, before placing the butter and crumbs mixture as suggested.  Came out just right.Really delicious.

Absolutely delicious!  Used only 1/2 c. Italian flavored bread crumbs and just enough margarine  to moisten them.  Used fresh dill and I used a lot as we love dill.  I will cut out the salt and pepper on the fish and only add them to the bread crumb mixture.  Used chicken broth, didn’t have fish broth.  Can’t wait to make this again!

I followed the suggestions of others and put slices of lemon under the fillets and used the chicken bouillon. (Use less salt if you use the bouillon or less bouillon cube.) I used Panko bread crumbs and tossed in whatever spices I had at hand since I didn't have dill or tarragon.  The MAJOR difference is that I used  2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil rather than butter to moisten the crumbs.  That way I don't have to feel guilty about my cholesterol.  I enjoyed it as did my husband and will make it again.  It's fast and easy as well as tasty.

Three stars might be unfair.  I subbed panko for bread crumbs.  In the future I will be sure I have bread crumbs on hand. I added loads of my own spice to the chicken, so it was extremely flavorful
