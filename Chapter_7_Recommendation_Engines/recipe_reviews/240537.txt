I love bacon as much as the next person and frequently find that a dish that includes it is better because of it.  Here as well – but for us the amount of bacon called for would have been a case of bacon overkill.  Half the amount was perfect – its presence was known, but it served as an enhancement, not a main ingredient that would dominate.  Too much of a good thing… is not good.  One other thing – you know how it is when people come over, you’re in the kitchen cooking and you’re talking and trying to follow a recipe at the same time – and if you notice you messed up at all it isn’t until after the fact and it’s too late.  Well, it was because of gabbing in the kitchen that I forgot the lemon juice.  And I think the omission made this so much better.  The bottom line?  This was just excellent, a hit at the dinner table.  But next time I make it I will do it the same way, with half the bacon, no lemon juice (and a good dab of butter).

As per the other reviewer, I would also double the spinach because it really cooks down.  My only addition to this recipe was to add a little chicken broth (or white wine next time) to the sauce so the pasta wouldn't be so dry...this was OUTSTANDING!!!

Loving bacon and Linguine! Great combinations here. Next time I would double the spinach (because we love it) and the tomato. I also would leave the lemon to be squeezed on as to taste. I didn't care for it but my s/o did. I feel like it took away from the bacon taste. A good sprinkling of freshly grated Parm and you have a great meal!

Good recipe. I followed it as written and still feel it needs depth.  Next time I make it, because its worthy enough to make again, I will use sun dried tomatoes with the combo of lemon juice, lemon zest, and olive or hemp oil. I am a fitness geek so I will also tweak cooking according to my caloric intake and health preferences. All 
the bacon and bacon grease was a bit rough for me. I made this as a side dish to a piece of salmon so the lemon was pleasant. Thank you for sharing your recipe. It will be a good addition to my rotation.

This was fantastic and so simple! I am definitely adding this to my roster. I decreased the bacon to 4 strips and doubled the spinach, as per other reviewers, but I think I would triple or even quadruple the spinach next time as it cooks down to almost nothing. I also doubled the garlic (certified garlic lover here). I didn't think I'd enjoy the lemon flavor, but thought I'd try it and I'm so glad I did... it was delicious.  Mmm... such a lovely, flavourful pasta dish!! (PS: I forgot to cut the bacon before frying it, so I took a pair of scissors and cut it into half-inch or so pieces afterwards. It was very easy to cut this way :)

This was a hit. I didn’t read the other reviews first so I made it pretty much as written; however, I did add more bacon and probably more than 4 oz of pasta.  This was easy and tasty; next time I will definitely add more spinach and more tomatoes.

This was a great quick lunch. We agreed the portions were small, I would definitely double the spinach and tomato next time and consider serving with bread sticks (because I love a side of carbs with my carbs!). I didn't measure the lemon juice, juice squashed half a lemon into the pan with my hand, but can see how too much would overpower this dish. Overall, would make again!
