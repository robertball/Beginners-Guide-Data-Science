This was wonderful! I combined this recipe with Linda's recipe on this site---'Potato Plum Dumplings'. It was very tasty, soooo good! (See posted pics). My 3yo and I had such fun making this, it was very messy, LOL! We enjoyed, thanks for the memories!

These are very good, but alot of work.  I froze quite a few and plan on warming them as the author suggested by browning.  I think they would be even better that way because I felt like they need some texture.

This was a fairly easy dessert to prepare, and it's great for summer! I'd reccomend anyone who loves peaches to try this one out!

My dad is Slovak and my mom is Czech, (I am born in Canada) and these surprised them nicely over Easter weekend.  Sweet, delicious, light and yummy - just the right blend of peach to dough ratio... I made one change.. I steamed mine on a double boiler instead of boiling them - i put about five dumplings per go on the steamer and steamed them about 20 - 25 minutes... WOWZA!!! Try this now!!!

My husband and daughter remember the peach dumplings my Mother in law (a Czech lady) used to make.  They loved them and wanted me to try to replicate them as she has passed away and I was unable to find her recipe anywhere.  I was delighted to find this recipe because she also used potato so it sounded similar.  My husband and I went to visit my daughter and we made these.  I have lots of pictures of the "making".  They turned out so perfect..delicious and bringing back many fond memories for our family.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I have been looking for this recipe forever, my grandmother(Czech) made them and used sugar, butter, and bread crumes then bake them after boiling. So good, thank you

Hi, My mom and her mom used to make these, but their recipe called for scalded milk, butter, egg, and flour.  I'm looking for that recipe.  Does anyone have it?  They, too, used vanilla wafers, butter, and sugar on top.
