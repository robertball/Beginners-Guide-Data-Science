These potatoes were SO delicious. Easy to make, too. The only modification I made was adding extra butter and a little bit of olive oil. I also mixed all of the ingredients, with the exception of the butter, which I dotted on once they were on the foil, in a large bowl before assembling them on the foil. I threw them on the grill and forgot about them! Flip once...yum. Be sure to PAM the heck out of your foil, too. Also, make sure you slice your potatoes THINLY; otherwise, they'll never cook right. I'll make these again & again.

Quite yummy. I used baby red potatoes. I didn't use the grill. Instead, I put them in a baking dish and covered them with tin foil. I baked them at 350 for about 35 mins. They came out tender and flavorful.

I used cubed, unpeeled red potatoes for this dish.  Parboiled for 5 minutes prior to grilling.  Added a splash of olive oil and double wrapped in foil for grilling.

I am always looking for different variations for my potatoes on the grill. This recipe is wonderful. The only change I made was that I used dried Italian seasoning instead of the fresh parsley because I didnt have any. I also sprayed the foil with PAM and this really kept the potatoes from sticking. YUMMY!!!

There's nothing like potatoes on the grill.  I used a small foil tin vs. foil packets that I sprayed with Pam to keep everything from sticking.  I cut the recipe in half and used a combination of vidalia onion and red onion, added a little olive oil and italian seasoning.  I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used parmesan instead.

This is a great fill-the-grill recipe. I have made it several times now and our standard is to include mushrooms. Skimping on the butter does no harm. Delicious!

I had to cook the potatoes for a bit longer than stated on the recipe, but they turned out very good. I added just a few extra spices for additional flavor.

Great recipe!!  What a tasty way to do potatoes on the grill...super variation on the old steak and boring baked potato!  After reading several reviews, I made the following changes:  used red potatoes, skin on, slice about 1/8" thick.  Increased cook time by 5 minutes (10 each side, 5 to melt the cheese).  Used a foil pan, covered with a piece of foil, sprayed both the pan and the inside of the foil cover -- EASY CLEANUP!!  Omitted the white onion.  In the foil pan, just placed the potatoes, garlic, and a few pats of butter.  Crisped up several slices of bacon & chopped some green onion.  In the last five minutes of cook time, peeled back the foil, tossed in the cheese and bacon.  After 5 minutes, removed from grill, sprinkled with the chopped green onion, and served with side of sour cream.  Talk about melt in your mouth!  Mmmmm.  My new man was very impressed and loved these potatoes!  Will make again and again and again!!  Side note:  these also made great breakfast potatoes the next day -- just heat & serve!

Great, easy recipe.  I used vidalia onions and red potatoes and then grilled over an open fire camping.  It worked perfect!!  Just remember to use PAM and flip your packets frequently.

Good recipe!  I have been making these potatoes for years but never put cheese in them. What a great twist from the plain. I used Sargento's low fat mild cheddar cheese and I can't beleive its not butter to watch fats. I also put pam on foil to prevent sticking and I had no trouble like other reviewers. Awesome results!Thanks for sharing!

This was a great dish! The only things I changed were to omit the onion (we are not fans), add a pound of fresh mushrooms, and doubled the parsley. I also drizzled a little olive oil over the top. I made this in one of those cheap aluminum cake pans you can get at Wal-Mart because it seemed like an awful lot of potatoes to put into foil. Sprayed the pan liberally with non-stick cooking spray and I had no problem with anything sticking. I did do one thing differently that I think made a difference... after cooking on the grill for 20 minutes, I took the pan inside, covered the potatoes with cheese, then stuck the pan under the broiler for 5 minutes. This gave it a nice crisp top, yum!

I was tempted to make the recipe healthier by omitting the cheese, but I made the recipe as written... and I'm glad I did.  Very good twist on the potato/onion foil packet recipe.  I may try it next time with a different cheese -- parm or cojack.

These were good, but nothing special.  I only used 3 potatoes since it was just hubby and I.  I made the assembling easier by melting the butter and mixing in the minced garlic.  I poured this over the potatoes and sprinkled them with dried parsley.  They did take all of 20 minutes to cook and some of the potatoes and onions stuck to the packet.  I recommend spraying the inside of the foil with pam before adding the ingredients.  You could even mix everything together in a large bowl and then pour it into your foil packet.  That way, the butter would be distributed evenly. Instead of cheddar, I sprinkled a little parmesan over the top. These did have good flavor and were fun to make along with our steaks, but these just didn't knock our socks off.  Glad I gave these a try.  Thanks Kelly

I made these last night on the grill
my husband raved and raved about them,
and I thought these were the best I've
ever made on the grill. We will be having these often, and I'll make them in the oven this winter, too good to only have in the warm weather.

Be sure to PAM the heck outta the foil to avoid sticking! These were pretty good but even with the Pam - some of the potatoes/onions still stuck . I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried - and less of it. I also added some fresh mushrooms and a dash of onion/garlic powder. Overall - pretty good for coming off the grill and went well with our grilled kabob dinner! Pretty easy to make too. Thanks!

Really good and super easy.  I didn't add the cheese because I didn't have any.  The potatoes ended up tasting a lot like home fries.  I will definately make again, because I loved not having any pots and pans to clean up.  I will start experimenting with other herbs too.

We thought these were good, and nice when BBQ-ing. I nuked the potatoes for a few minutes in the microwave to speed up the cooking, then tried Reynolds Release foil for the packets-that stuff is great!

I have been making these for years....recently I added McCormick Barbaque seasoning....no extra calories, but lots of extra flavor for each layer.  Vidalia onions are always the best.

This dish had a great flavor especially because the onions caramelized while on the grill. I had never done a foil packet on the grill for sliced potatoes before, but it was a simple way of cooking them and I didn't have to heat up the oven. Overall, a really tasty dish that goes well with grilled steaks!

Pretty good potatoes.  I read some of the reviews and see a lot of people had trouble with them sticking -- use the Reynold's Non-Stick Foil, it really does work.  I didn't use as much cheese, and they could have used a bit more salt or something to give them some zing, but they were really tender and were sure a lot easier than trying to flip them in a skillet.  This is a good recipe to play with....

Recipe was simple and very tasty.  I needed something to throw together last minute for a cook out and this was perfect.  The first time I grilled it as they said, the second time I put it in the oven for about 25 minutes on 400.  Both ways delicious! May try to put on grill pan next time to get them more crispy.  Thanks!

Easy and really good. I used olive oil instead of butter and cut the cheese in about half. You could add some herbs like chives or basil, but I think they're great as they are, too.

I found these to very delicious.  I however, made them in the oven.  I put tinfoil on the bottom of a baking pan and put them in the oven for 25 minutes, put the cheese on it and then another 10.

These are some really good potatoes.  The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle some chopped green onion on top when serving!  We have had these twice now.  I find that the potatoes brown more when just sprayed over with PAM insead of adding all the butter between them.  I think all the butter is too much fluid which then steams them.  I still add a little butter for flavor though.  Thanks forthe recipe - we love it!

This was easy and would be great for camping.  I added fresh rosemary and omitted the cheese.  This wasn't an outstanding recipe, but a good alternative to cooking indoors on a hot day.

I buttered the foil, which worked well to keep things from sticking.  I think ghe proportions are off here.  I had ALOT of potato left over, and needed more butter.    The cheese was close, but I needed a bit more.  Maybe I sliced the potatoes too thin?  My guests liked these alot.

This recipe was very bland. I did not add the cheese to try and cut down the fat. I sprayed the foil with Pam. The potatoes were moist and did not stick. If I make this again I will add the cheese and use the suggestion by another review that said to add basil.

I've made this dish at least four times this summer and it is wonderful. My husband and kids really like it. Remember to spray the foil with cooking spray, otherwise the potato mixture sticks to the foil.

This was very good.  I did take other reviewers advice about spraying the foil.  I added by own blend of seasonings in order to spice this up (basil and rosemary).  This turned out very good.  Thank you for the post.

These were really good.  I made my bf's the regular way and used Pam and no cheese on mine to reduce the fat, and both turned out really yummy.  Its so easy and cheap, I'll definitely make them again.

This is a nice recipe that I would like to tweak in the future. I ended up having to cook the potatoes much longer than recipe suggested. Also added much more garlic.

These were really good. Although I prefer to slice the potatoes almost to the bottom and place onion, butter, and garlic in between each slice and cook the potatoes individually. This is definitely a time saver as me way takes more prep time.

Have made this dish many times and in winter I put it in my toaster oven for one hour.  I alternate the potatoes and onions and sprinkle cheddar cheese between the layers.

This is a great recipe & super easy.  I've made it a few times now & have found my favourite version:  use baking potatoes, pre-cook for about 2 mins in the microwave before hand so they're almost cooked through.  Add real bacon bits, a bit of onion powder and Kraft Tex Mex Shredded cheese.  Yum.  I don't continue to grill the potatoes after I add the bacon bits & cheese - I just add them at the end, and re-cover the foil for a few minutes.  By the time you open it back up the cheese is melted just fine!

My husband made these last night for us and I have to say that these were the best potatoes I have ever had! We had them with hot dogs and we barely touched the hot dogs at all. We are having them again tonight. This time we won't forget to add the garlic and will use some celery salt as well. 

One word of advice I will give you is that you should make sure that your foil is the wider variety and is sprayed with Pam or something. I have regular sized Reynold's Wrap and had to make the packet into a long cigar like form to be able to close it which made it a bit difficult becasue we weren't able to close the packet back up after adding the cheese.

I made this recipe the other night, and everyone loved it!  I used red potatoes and left the skins on, but otherwise followed the exact directions.  The potatoes were absolutely delicious!  Next time I make it I'll spray the foil with cooking spray, since some of the potatoes stuck to it, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  The leftovers were even great warmed up for lunch the next day!

This is a good recipe though it's hard to get the potatoes not to stick to the aluminum foil.  I also don't add as many onions.

I took these tailgating so I mixed everything in a bowl ahead of time. I agree with the other reviews...be sure to spray your foil with pam first, I didn't and quite a few potatoes stuck. Very tasty and easy to prepare.

I have one word for this dish, YUMMY! 
So easy and delicious. I've tried this with fresh chopped cilantro instead of the parsley and liked it even better. We've started making this every time we fire up the grill.

I've been making these for years, although , I use  Tony Chachere's For my seasoning and I place 3 strips of bacon on top of the potatoes. The bacon juice adds tons of flavor. I normally open the foil for approximately 15 minutes, to finish them off. This allows the potatoes to brown just a bit.

These were delicious.  Did not add the cheese which is unusual for me as my theory is "everything is better with cheese".  Leaving it off sure did reduce the calories and the potatoes and onions were yummy. Just used a  lot of butter, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Everything is better with garlic powder too.

This is a great recipe and I have been making a variation of it for years.  I do toss the sliced potatoes in a little olive oil,  garlic powder and salt and pepper prior to adding them to the foil.  I also add the ingredients in small layers to ensure the cooking of the potatoes is more uniform.  Potatoes, onion, butter, garlic, and so on.  Finally at the end I add shredded cheese and bacon.  Great taters!!

Recipe was ok, definitely needs some spices.  I used an aluminum pan and really greased it so the potatoes would not stick.  I will definitely try again adding some garlic powder, garlic salt, basil, onion powder.....

These were OK but nothing exciting - could use more flavor.  However, side dishes many times are not terribly exciting anyway and it's nice just to have a variety.  I usually have red potatoes around so that's what I used, unpeeled.  (I noticed most of the pics are unpeeled.)  I also never have fresh herbs around so I use about 1/3 dried.  I also cut back on the onion, and used them for flavoring only as I didn't eat them.  It's always a curious thing when most others think something was easy and I thought it was a hassle - I knocked these down a notch cause of hassle factor.  (I could get much the same results in foil in the oven, more easily.)  They really need to be thinly sliced and my food processor does a terrible job of this - but no I didn't use a knife. :-)  I have a manual slicer thing which is easy but still time-consuming.  They obviously don't fit on the foil and would be difficult to turn so I didn't.  And my budget doesn't allow for foil bags - store brand rolls are ridiculously cheap.  So it did work out, but not what I'd call "easy."  They did come out nice and tender, but took longer than 20 minutes.  One interesting note, though, is that I didn't have trouble with them sticking, or at least no more than a couple of minor spots.

Wow! I love this recipe!!! The potatoes turned out perfectly cooked and soooo delicious that I used the left over to fry the next morning for breakfast! I did add much more garlic as my family and I love garlic. I also noted that next time I want to remember to put some olive oil maybe on the bottom before placing the potatoes as they did stick pretty good. Other than that, highly recommend!!!!

Try using a cast iron skillet on the grill. Cover with foil and make sure not to burn.  I prepared them this way and they were out of this world good!

I cooked these for Memorial day cook out and they turned out great.  Family loved them.  I did not change any thing but I did add some thing.  Whent he potatoes were done I opened the foil sprinkled alot of chedder cheese and real bacon bits.  And then covered them back up for about five minutes and removed them from the grill and they were a hudge hit with my family.  My husband loved them thanks.

I made these for a barbecue.  The flavor was good and the clean-up was easy.  I sprinkled about a teaspoon of cajun seasoning over these before baking and it added quite a zip.  I gave 4 stars because most of the cheese stuck to the foil even though I had liberally sprayed it with Pam.

Potatoes, butter, cheese.  An ideal potato recipie that can be modified to your liking ie. bacon, mushrooms.  Easy to make and the only word of advice is keep the potatoe slices equal and grease the foil.

I've always had a problem getting the taters done when the rest of the bbq was done, or vice-versa. NOT ANY MORE!!!This is a wonderful and very tasty recipe and I'll use it probably exclusive when bbq'ing. I followed it exactly, except I didn't have fresh fresh parsely, so I just sprinkled dried parsely over it. The other thing- I used a disposable 11 3/4 X 9 3/8 X 1 1/2 inch Lasagna pan and it worked great, just covered it tightly with aluminum foil. For the three of us, there was plenty left over that went nicely the next morning, nuked, with our eggs and bacon....Yummy. Thanks Kelly and much thanks to Allrecipes for a "drop dead good" website.

Fabulous potatoes!  I'm always looking for new recipes for the grill and this will definitely be used alot! I forgot to read the reviews first (again!) so next time I will use premade foil bags and spray them - also will try other spices and mix w/ olive oil to toss w/ potatoes before pouring into the bag.  We even added mushrooms and carrots -the cheese is a definte MUST!!

I thought this was really good!  I made mine with mini red potatoes, and I used a little bit garilc powder instead of fresh.  I also didn't use parsley since I didn't have any, but I was going to use dry parsley and I forgot.  I may add that next time to see if it's better.  They turned out great anyway.  In my opinion, they don't even need cheese.  But my husband loves cheese so I added it anyway.  We also used sour cream.  Very yummy

We ran out of propane so I baked these at 450 F for about 35-40 minutes and microwaved them a little longer in a casserole to finish it off.  It was delish!  I used non-stick spray on the foil and had no sticking problems.

Yummy!!  I love recipes that are quick (thanks to the food processor slicing the potatoes) and that can be cooked on the grill, keeping the heat and mess to a minimum.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Good but not unique.  After reading about the potatoes sticking, I sprayed the foil as suggested and added a little of my beer to it, didn't stick.

Wonderful potatoes!  I couldn't believe how easy these were.  I did add a bit more butter and also added garlic powder.  We forgot to flip them, but still seemed to turn out great!  Next time I'm going to use a Reynolds foil bag.  I highly recommend these!

Made this recipe last night and it was a big hit!  I paired it with NY Strip steaks and green beans.  I made a few changes to the instructions.  I put butter pieces on the foil before I put the first layer of potatoes. (Next time I will spay Pam and the butter so they will brown up on the bottom but not stick) So, I placed the sliced potatoes, crumbled butter, the onion, garlic, salt, pepper, a shredded cheddar cheese and a sprinkle of dry parsley on each layer.  I grilled that mixture for  25 to 30 minutes then I placed the remaining cheddar cheese on top for about 10 minutes.  It came out great!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will keep this in my rotation for my family.

Was so good, and leftovers was great even reheated. If you like onions, then use a good amount. I used sweet Vadaila onions, and garlic, and mixed it all with evoo, and then dotted with butter. After cooking, I topped with shredded sharp cheddar and let it melt. Amazing!!

These were pretty good.  My husband really liked them and he's more of the potato lover in our house.  I used green onions instead of white as I had some chopped and ready to go.  I also added a little extra butter. :)

I have made these and I have added to it.  I love adding left over bacon on these, just adds another flavor to them.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Made a half batch of these today.  Didn't have fresh parsley but used dried.  Everything else was as written.  Hubby and I both love it!

These are great.  You can also put them in an aluminum bake pan and cover with foil.  I added chopped bacon too as a variation. Delicious!

Yum! I really liked these!!! My hubs wasn't a fan (he says our potatoes were too bland for his liking) but unless I am heavy handed with the salt shaker, he thinks EVERYTHING is underseasoned lol! As many others have done, I too grilled my potatoes in a shallow tinfoil (i.e. disposable) baking pan. Although convenient, I think I'll use non-stick foil next time. The layer of potatoes on the bottom of my dish were B-U-R-N-T!!! Had I used foil, I would have been able to flip my potatoes to prevent them from burning (there IS a reason for the foil...). Thankfully, I made three layers of potatoes, so there was plenty to eat that wasn't burnt. NOTE: I just sprayed my pan (generously) and each potato layer (lightly) with Pam - no butter was necessary. If you are looking to cut calories, this offers a simple solution to do so. Placing my potatoes under the broiler for a few minutes quickly melted my cheese layer, but this step was not necessary, IMHO. The heat from the potatoes melts the cheese just fine (you can skip the last step of this recipe alltogether). Thanks for sharing, Kelly! This worked out very well for me. Not only did this pair well with my grilled chicken kabobs, I was also able to avoid heating up my kitchen during one of the Midwest's hottest heat waves in years. :-)

I've never grilled potatoes before and this turned out pretty good. Better than expected actually. I did have a problem with a little bit of burning but that could have just been me.

Not bad, but not the best potatoe recipe either.  I was looking for a different recipe for potatoes, but my husband still prefers the lipton packaged seasoning on his potatoes.

I added substantially more garlic, chopped chives and about 1.5 tsp crumbled bacon (the latter on top of the cheese). Divine. Thanks !!

These were great at our tailgate party this weekend.  I made exactly as the recipe indicated except used Natures Seasoning instead of salt and pepper (I seasoned after I sliced the potatos to 1/8" and washed--so the seasoning stuck to each potato). Also I used a foil pan on the grill so didn't flip or stir.  They came out perfect!  The next day I warmed up the left overs by adding more cheese to the top and bacon bits.  It reminds me of a "kicked up" version of the twice baked potato!  GREAT and SOOOO easy.  I love the convenience of using the grill for every part of your meal on hot summer days.

The great thing about recipe is that it is the basic of the recipe. You can add some many different things. Like Bacon,
cilatro, peppers, rosemary whatever you have a taste for. I do dice the potatoes and spray the foil with PAM so they do not stick to the foil.

This recipe needs a lot more of something to give it some real flavor. I was pretty disappointed in it considering there are hundreds of potato recipes that are just as easy and taste much better.

I made these with red potatoes and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  The turned out to be pretty darn good.  The only problem is that they werent done when we went to eat dinner.  It actually took like 45 minutes for them to be done! So by the time they came off of the grill we all had eaten and nobody was hungry.  They did taste really good, i just wish they were done in time!!  We are having them as left overs today :)

This was delicious!  I did add a few more herbs, like fresh rosemary and a little basil, but this would have been great without it.  I've never though of adding cheese after they come off the grill, neither slicing the potatoes thin.  Just terrific.  Definitely will spray EVEN non-stick Reynolds next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

These did not turn out well at all for me.  I did forget to buy the  foil bag, so maybe that would have helped, but the potatoes turned out very dry, and there was not much flavor to them at all, even with the garlic and onions in there. We were disappointed, as they sounded so good!

Great recipe.  Quick and easy clean up for working parents.  I usually slice the potatoes a little thicker to even out the cooking time with the meat/chicken that we're grilling at the sametime.  I'll need to try adding the beer - couldn't hurt.

These were very good!  We love making potatoes in foil on the grill and these were the best.  The key is to slice the potatoes thin and get them close to the heat, otherwise, they sometimes take a long time.  As it was, we cooked them over medium heat (we were grilling pork chops simultaneously) for much longer than the recommended 20 minutes.  Great flavor!

Loved these potatoes!  I do feel like they lacked something.  I think we'll try pepperjack cheese next time, and definitely a Reynolds wrap foil bag!  Thanks for all the great tips!

Absolutely delicious. Have tried it just following the recipe and with the mushrooms added.  Good both ways.  The mushroms make it a bit more watery and not as crisp, though.  We are going to make it again and again.
