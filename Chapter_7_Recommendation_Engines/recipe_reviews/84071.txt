Yummy, yummy my four year old daughter loves these. We make these instead of pancakes and dip into maple  syrup. A few things I do, first we use onion powder instead of onions, omit the celery. I also let the cheese sit at room temp. as it makes it easier to knead into the sausage. I also use a broiler pan that has slots on the top. So the grease runs down into the bottom pan. Instead of sitting on cookie sheet. It cuts don on the grease and the clean-up...

Other versions recommend 2 c Bisquick.  I started with 1 1/2 cups and added a bit more.  Next time I will use a scant 2 cups.  Be careful you keep these at 1" balls.  Freeze easily.  Then thaw them 5 minutes (not 15) and bake them for 18-20 minutes (not 20-25) so they won't be dry.  Everyone really liked these, and the mild flavor was good for kids.

Between the two sausage ball recipes I tried today, this one suits my taste the best. The addition of the onion and the celery is what makes these stand out from your usual sausage balls. I don't think I have ever eaten any made with onion and celery before, and in my quest to be a little different, I think this will be my new recipe!

This is the BEST recipe for sausage balls!!  If you like a spicier version get the HOT Jimmy Dean sausage and look for the Zesty Sausage Cheese Ball recipe on the back of that package.  They are the BOMB!!!  Beware though.....if you're the type that likes to have a few leftovers at the ned of the party....do not make these....as there wil be no leftovers with this recipe.    Also....do use Jimmy Dean sausage as there is very little waste with their brand...and they turn out perfect everytime!!

Well, personally these were not my favorite.  Not what I was looking for.  They were VERY moist and almost sweet.  They weren't bad tasteing.  I would've liked a sausage cheese ball with more HEAT.  They were very greesy (but it is sausage after all).  If you are looking for something a little different, these are for you.  I guess I wanted something a little hotter and more bread like.  To be fair, I did use mild store brand sausage.  I bet if I went with a different brand in hot instead of mild it would make these better.

Holy Cow!! The best sausage balls ever!! my family has made sausage balls every holiday season since the beginning of sausage! I can remember sitting and mixing with my hands when I was little! These are the best.. I've had them too dry, too greasy, you name it.. but if your a sausage ball lover this is the recipe.. Never had I had them or made them with onion and celery.. I used hot sausage to give plenty of flavor.. I wanted to spread the celery and onion love and used my mini-processor to finely mice them.. instead of the 2 teas. garlic I used 1 teaspoon of garlic salt and 1 teas. of reg salt.. Used low carb bake mix(carbquik)  -- This make these very low-carb.. Yum.. hot or cold grab and go goodness.. For all who are first0time sausage ballers- Yes they are greasy- hey you got 2# of sausage and a # of cheese. what do you think?? drain on paper towels out of oven.. Make sure your baking sheet has sides....   Yes they are stiff to mix.. Put all your ingredients in a bowl and let come to room temp..  These are almost impossible to mix with a spoon.. so... Wash those hands and take off those rings and dig in!! Never tried it but maybe a good processor would do the job...  Gonna make some more today... Like I said with the low carb mix these guys are awesome for snacks!!!

Excellent- we really liked them. Made them the day before the party and froze, then thawed 15 minutes before baking. Great!

I served these last night at a party and they were a big hit!  They were gobbled up immediately.  I did not change the recipe at all.  They were awesome!  Will be making again.

I've made these several times and they have always been a hit.  The first time I followed the directions exactly and they were perfect.   To improve on perfection (???) I halved the pepper (wife was the only one to say they were too spicy so why modify the recipe for her?  Duh!); and used a broiler tray to reduce the fat in the balls.  They still tasted great to me (and also to my wife).  Fun to make and something the grandkids could help with.

We have been making these for my whole life I can remember, and it's so easy my mom has passed this down to me. Our recipe is a little more simple bc we omit the onion and celery. Its just three ingredients for us!! For the health conscious I always use heart smart bisquick and reduced fat cheddar. Also I always buy one pkg of hot sausage and one turkey sausage or reduced fat sausage (can't remember if Jimmy dean or Owens). We always have these for bfast Christmas morning before opening presents and its a fast thing to make the night before, freeze balls, then pop in the oven in the morning. I also made for a party last nught and they were gone!!

I have been making these for years, but the recipe can be simplified. 2 lbs breakfast sausage (I use Bob Evans) 2 c Bisquick & 2 c shredded cheese. I've never used the veggies, but I'm sure it would be OK. I never have any left to take home!

My co-worker made these with the Maple flavored sausage.  I was quite suprised how great they were.  Love the celery flavor also.  I will be making these for my New Years Eve Party and future get togethers.

I have made these a number of times and they have been a hit.  It is not for health-conscious people or those watching their caloric intake! I have used both Jimmy Dean and off brands of sausages with no difference in taste noted.

I made this recipe for a potluck at my husband's job. Another recipe I found called for 3 cups of baking mix with just one pound of sausage, so I increased the baking mix to 3 cups and used the 2 pounds of sausage.  The result: almost 9 dozen tasty and tender sausage balls!  I also added about a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little extra zip.  Next time I make these I will use one pound of regular sausage and one pound of hot or substitute pepper jack cheese for part of the cheddar.  Some like it hot!

Yum! Yum! Yum! I used zesty sausage and got rave reviews. In one batch I did add the onion and celery and one I did not. It was definitely better with the onion and celery. I baked them the night  before and just warmed them in the morning. Delicious!!! This is a keeper and will be on the menu for Christmas morning! Thanks for sharing!!!  Here is a tip to avoid a mess. I baked them on my broiler pan that I lined with foil. The grease drips through thus avoiding a messy cookie sheet.  Also, let them cool a bit before removing from the pan. Enjoy!

Really good. They roll out better if you let them sit on the counter a little bit. The pork and biscuit mix will combine easier.

I have been making these  for years!  They are soooo amazing!  The only down side is......EVERY time we have a family function, I am in charge of the Sausage Cheese Balls!  I ALWAYS make a double batch because we eat half of them right out of the oven and the other half goes to the party!!!  You cannot lose with this appetizer!

I have tried other recipes but this is far better,  You must use Jimmy Dean or a lean pork sausage and I added pepper jack cheese with the cheddar (1/4 jack,3/4 cheddar) and they are requested at every party.  Gone within minutes.  Also do not put more biscuit mix than called for or they will be too dry as other recipes are that call for 2 cups. I have made these at least 10 times and always a big hit.

My family loves this recipe and I've made it over and over again, as is, except if you want a little more kick to it, just by the spicier sausage.  Very easy to throw some of them into a freezer bag, thaw and bake when you are ready.  A repeat for sure!

Hubby requested these so I did not add celery or minced garlic.  They turned out perfectly.  I used Jimmy Dean sausage and they were not that greasy.

These are fantastic, and left overs are great warmed up and used as a breakfast meat. I omitted garlic and used 1/2 the amt. of onion and celery, both minced. I suggest using small mild sweet onions for a more delicate flavor.

YUM, these are one of my favorite appetizers! I do omit the celery, and sometimes use garlic powder in place of the fresh. These are always the first to go at any gathering. These also freeze beautifully. If you haven't tried these yet, you should...SO GOOD! :)

These aew delish! I used JD Sage sausage and omitted the celery, just a preferance. They turned out great, but I would use a broiler pan next time so the grease would drip out instead of sitting on the sheet pan. Really good though!

Made these with a friend and they were delicious! I halfed the recipe and it still made a whole 9X12 baking sheet of them. Instead of Jimmy Dean Sausage I used grass-fed organic alternative from the farmer's market and gluten/wheat/dairy-free baking mix, and they were still amazing!

This is the best recipe around - with the additional ingredients of onion and celery.  Plus this recipe has less bread in case you are watching your carbs or watching your starch intake.  Everytime we make these they disappear!  My husband always makes me a special batch with cayenne pepper!  Love em!

My mom made these last year on New Year's Eve and all year long I anticipated her making them again!  I finally printed off this recipe for myself.  They are delicious by themselves, but I prefer to dip them in pancake syrup!  My mom makes the variation listed at the bottom of the recipe with more Bisquick, (that's what she prefers to use) and 2 cups of cheese.  AMAZING!  I recommend to anyone for a nice weekend breakfast, or a party appetizer!

I made these for a seniors Christmas party and they were voted the best appetizer there.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased.  They weren't greasy and didn't fall apart when you took a bite.  They are on my favorite recipe list.

Good recipe. Made a few changes. Used bisquick, about 2 cups, mixed all dry ingredients together first. Used salt, pepper, garlic salt, and lawrys seasoning salt. Added onion to jimmy dean sausage, 1 hot and 1 mild, kneaded in. Then added dry ingredients and kneaded then added cheese[4 cups]. Mixed together and made 1" balls. Cooked on a broiler pan so the grease would drain off[ A MUST ]. Cooked on 350 until brown on top then turned each ball and browned the other side. They will make you slap yo mama!!!

Loved this receipe and so did the family.  I only had 1lb of sausage, so used 3/4 c flour, 2 1/4 C sharp cheedar cheese, a little less then 1/4 C each of  celery & onion, and only 1/3 tsp garlic powder.  Be sure to dice the onion & celery very fine.  Used the other tip and used my broiler pan so some of the grease ran off.  Will make again and again

Update: I made these again, but this time formed them into patties for breakfast sandwiches with eggs on bagels.  They turned out well.  I halved the recipe and served as part of a huge breakfast, they were the first thing gone!  They needed longer than 20 minutes for me.  Good use of bisquick.  Wonderful dipped in ketchup.

made as written. I mixed the sausage and bisquit with the finely chopped celery and onion first. that took maybe 10 minutes, but it all came together finally. then added the cheese. I rolled the balls as big as large walnuts. I used parchment paper. they took @ 30 minutes to brown. they were a hit. this recipe will be made many more times!

I love these sausage balls! My whole family, even my dad (who eats nothing) loves these. I make them for every holiday gathering and for football snacks for my hubby. They are so easy. We like to dip them in mustard too.

I left out the onion and celery since my family does not like these in recipes.  I added a few dashes of hot sauce, and I also used Smithfield's ham sausage, which is less greasy than regular sausage.  I make these and serve them with mustard.  None are ever left over to freeze for later !  Great party or snack food for guests.

Used JD SPICY sausage.  I didn't have celery and am not sure it mattered. Baked on a cooling rack sprayed with pam over a jelly roll pan lined with foil...easy cleanup and not greasy at all!  They were sooo tasty!  Can't wait to make again!!

Delish! These were exactly what I was looking for for  Thanksgiving. The only change I made was that I mixed one roll of regular JD sausage and 1 roll of hot. It turned out to be the perfect combo,  the meatballs have a little kick without being too spicy. Will def be making  again, these are very easy to make, wish I would have doubled the batch!

This is an awesome recipe!  I get requests for this all the time! I've used this recipe since I found it in a Better Homes and Garden book in 2000. I always add the additional baking mix and cheese for  firmer texture and less grease. I use PAM to spray the baking sheet to prevent the melting cheese from sticking! My son requests these any time we have a reunion.

I just made these sausage cheese balls and my husband gave the thumbs up!!The only change I made was to use 1 lb of hot sausage and 1 lb of regular sausage and they had just the right amount of bite.  Now I hope they last till I get to the party!!

These are perfect! The ease of making them even makes them better! I made some exactly as written and others without the celery and onion and both are awesome. I will always keep some of these in the freezer from now on. They are perfect for breakfast, appetizers or a snack anytime. YUM!

These were easy and delicious. My only problem was they stuck to the pan a bit so, it was not so easy getting them off the baking pan onto the serving dish.

These are SO DELICIOUS!!!  This is the second time I've made them (NO changes to the recipe) and the second time I've received RAVE REVIEWS for them!  They are definitely a winner appetizer or brunch food and I will make them in the future.

FYI - When I serve them, after baking, I place them into a crock pot on low and they stay nice & toasty until they are GONE!  ;)

Yummy, yummy, yummy!
One of the BEST appetizers I have ever served! People LOVE these! Count on folks asking for a small doggie-bag. Believe me, they won't go to the doggies either! Perfect to freeze and store in portions for a quick appetizer in the future.  No need to improvise the ingredients either. They're perfect as is.
Bon Appetito!

I've been making these for 20 years.  All my co-workers and family request them  at the holidays.  My tips to make them perfect:  1.  let the sausage come to room temperature before trying to mix everything, but you will still have to get in there and use your hands to mix (use the biggest bowl you have).  2.  Mince the onion and celery and garlic really fine.  Don't leave them out, they really improve the taste.  3.  Don't use any other type of sausage than Jimmy Dean and they won't be too greasy.  And for god's sake, don't pre-cook the sausage!   4.  Make sure to use Baking Mix (like Bisquick or Pioneer).  Plain flour will not work!  You will have golf balls.  5.  Bake them on parchment paper on baking sheets.  Anything else and they will stick (because of the cheese).  5.  Make the balls a uniform size.  About an inch seems to work best for even cooking and a slightly crispy outside.  6.  My sister told me a few years ago about adding cream cheese to the ingredients.  I add about half of a package and it adds another layer of flavor.

Excellent flavor, I made this exactly as listed in the recipe. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I thought the balls fell apart a little when picked up with a toothpick. Next time I will add slightly more biscuit mix, I think the balls could be a little more firm with more mix. The celery and onion add a nice flavor.

Who would have thought, you could improve on cheese and sausage balls?  I do add the onion and celery, omit garlic (so far) but do add worcestershire, which puts this right over the top deliciously good.  I add about 1/4 c. water to mix together, just drain off any excess, put them in the fridge even overnight, to make it easier to make into balls, and cook on a broiler pan so the grease drains off into the pan below. My hubby loves them too and I will definitely make these again :)  Oh yes and flavored sausage makes it perfect, maple is good but sage is the best!!

The first time I made these, I made them as is. They were pretty good, surely worth four stars. I really liked the added crunch and flavor from the celery and onion, but I still found them a little bland for my taste. The second time around, I kicked it up a notch by using hot sausage instead of regular, and substituted 3/4 c pork seasoned stuffing mix that I crushed up into bread crumbs for 1/2 of the baking mix. Between my neighbors, my boyfriend, and myself they were gone in minutes! With my changes, this recipe is easily worth ten stars!

Yummy! I made ahead/froze and threw in the oven just the number I wanted for a party.  Rave reviews!  I used 16 oz regular sausage and 16 oz hot to spice it up a bit.  I had a bit of a hard time getting it all mixed together so I don't know how I'd get more baking mix in for the "firmer" balls.

This was really good.  I added some thyme and sage. Sage gave it a stuffing kind of taste.  Used Jimmy Dean hot.  Not too spicy, but had a kick.   Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and even placed the balls on a broiling pan like others suggested. The balls came out greasy and bland. Only 3 balls of the entire batch got ate.

Excellent! I always have to add something so parsley & thyme stepped it up a bit for mine. I did increase the Bisquick to 2 cups because I wanted to bulk it up some more. Was perfect!  Thank you.

Always a hit with family and friends!!  I serve mine with bottled Heinz chili sauce.  I used to mix by hand but since arthritic pain prevents this nowadays, I use my KitchenAid Pro600 stand mixer and it mixes this recipe like a treat!

I make these every year for either Christmas Eve or New Years Day. I use panko bread crumbs instead of "baking mix". I always mix 1 package of regular with 1 package of hot Jimmy Dean sausage because I found they lack a little kick if you use all regular. 

Make them ahead of time and freeze then take out about 15 mins before needing to put in the oven. Spread out into a single layer so they thaw quicker. I keep them fairly small so they are more of a pop 'em size. If you go smaller adjust cooking time to 15 minutes!

I have had people ask for something to dip them in but I generally dont serve with a dip. If anything I use a spicy brown or dijon mustard.

TIP: If you bought regular sausage and want some kick add 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for 2lbs of sausage. Mix well!

I have made this recipe many times and it has always been a hit! The recipe is perfect as is, but I have modified it from time to time, usually to fit ingredients on hand. It can be made without the onion or celery, although I prefer them, and the pepper can be cut back a little for those who prefer less. The sharp cheddar can be substituted with other cheeses on hand like mild Cheddar, Colby Jack, or Mexican blend.  I usually put them on paper towels to soak up some of the grease before moving them to a serving plate. I have been requested to make these during the Holidays many times!

Unfortunately, I used a baking sheet with no edges and grease got all over my oven. These were extremely greasy and too meaty tasting--not cheesy enough. I was overall very disappointed with how they turned out. Also, they stuck to the pan very badly so they had no bottoms.

These were okay. They tasted better right out of the oven than later on at the buffet table. Also, they made a huge mess in my oven. They leaked a lot of grease, which spilled over onto the bottom of my oven and made me have to clean my oven before I resumed baking again. I think it might have been because I did not use the Jimmy Dean brand of sausage? So be careful of that.

I make these every year for Christmas. Soooo good!! Instead of celery I add chopped jalapeño, onion and diced red bell pepper or pimentos to give it the festive red and green. I also cut back on the baking mix as I don’t like it quite so bready. I just add a quarter cup at a time until it’s the consistency I like. Up to about 1 cup, maybe a little more. And extra cheese!!! Very tasty!!

Made during the holidays for breakfast.  Great recipe!  Omitted garlic and pepper, as the sausage had enough spices, including extra sage.  Used only 1 pound of sausage and about 2 cups of cheese.  1/4 cup each of celery, green pepper and onion and almost 2 cups of mix made 22 sausage balls.  Found a dip recipe made with sour cream, mayo, and grainy mustard.  Delish!

Good and simple but not amazing.  All of them were eaten at the party but it wasn't the rave I  expected from the reviews.  Worth making again though just because of how easy they are

Great recipe and easy to put together.  My 1st go around they didn't seem to have a lot of taste to them so my 2nd batch I added Parmesan cheese and Garlic & Herb seasoning to them by rolling the balls in this mixture before cooking.  Everyone raved over them @ thanksgiving!

It's the same recipe that I've always used from the side of the sausage roll.

These are fabulous and exactly what I was looking for!!  I used hot sausage but otherwise left well enough alone.  These are my new go-to!

I was thinking that using only mild sausage would not be spicy enough, so I made mine with half mild and half hot sausage. They were plenty hot. We enjoyed them. Will probably make a batch of mild only for the kids.

I make these with a twist.  I don't want sweet.  I add bacon and use cooked Eckrich sausage (skinless) and they are amazing.   This is number one for all parties with my family.  Change these up with different cheeses and spices  for your taste.

This recipe is really good! I made it three ways...as is, add bacon, and added bacon and Franks red hot sauce. All three were a hit...especially with a side of ranch. The onion, celery, and garlic makes this recipe stand out from the others I've tried. Perfect Super Bowl snacks food.

Pretty good, but was missing something. Maybe too bland like a sausage roll or something, but I also made too much for 4 people! Will make again but will try adding something to the mix

My family loved these and my daughters dipped then in ranch dressing. We made them for Thanksgiving. Next time I'll probably use onion powder and celery powder to help mold them better.

Absolutely amazing!  I was tired of the same old same old appetizers and made this on Thanksgiving and again 2 days later for a football party and they disappeared quickly at both parties. People were raving about how wonderful they were. I made them exactly as written and did add the garlic!  Yummy!

Best sausage balls I've ever made - love the celery and onion.  I finely dice the onions and celery, but it adds color as well.  Very pretty!

Perfect the way it is, but when out of fresh garlic, I've used garlic powder (1/2 teaspoon) and it was just fine.

I've been making these every year for Christmas since the recipe first appeared.  I make them the day before and bake them right before guests arrive.  I do suggest lining your pan with aluminum foil and giving it a light spray of Pam.  Saves a major cleanup headache.

I have been making these around the holidays for years now.  They are a hit and requested at all parties.  They can be changed and tweeked by what type of sausage you use.  The best part is that I can make a ton of them at the beginning of the season and throw them in the freezer.   It saves a lot of time once the schedule gets busy.

I add fresh minced garlic instead of store bought.. 
If I do use store bought, I use the kind you put in the fridge, not the dry.
I am asked to bring these to every work event and I never have any left overs.
UPDATE: I have started eating low car so I have recently replaced the Bisquick with a 3oz bag of plain pork rinds. Tastes awesome, I just have to hide from hubby or they won't get to work.

Finally tried the recipe to the letter this AM because it sounded so good and I had found 4 recipes, all about the same.  We didn't like the sausage balls...I agree with more spice needed and a sweet dipping sauce.
Baking on a rack over a pan will help with the grease drippings..wouldn't make them again.  Glad I tried it before serving to company.  Reviews are very helpful.

Followed recipe to a "T" first time and found them a little bland.  On my second run, I used one pkge regular sausage and one pkge spicy.  I also decreased the cheese and added a bit more baking mix to firm them up a bit.  They turned out delicious!

Have made many times to take to church and the  family always complains I don't make them at home. I have used regular or hot sausage to add a little zip. I've used extra spices if I don't have a hot sausage. They are a top favorites and everyone loves them. Anyone else have a problem with them sticking to pan? Still trying to work out that small problem. They Bake well from frozen and so are a great make ahead appetizer or to have on hand.

Just made these.. I left out the celery (we're just not a fan).  They are good.. I feel like they need something else to spice them up just a tad.. but I overall they are a hit! Freezing the rest and making them for my Christmas Eve party tomorrow.
