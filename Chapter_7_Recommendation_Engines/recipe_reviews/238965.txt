I absolutely love this cake! I think this is the perfect coffee or tea cake & will use this as the base for strawberry shortcake.  
The cardamom is not overpowering and, while I thought buttering the pan and using bread crumbs were odd, they gave the cake a buttery crunch which I loved (next time I'll be sure to use unsalted butter, though). I did not bother with the "topping" because I did not want the cinnamon to affect the cardamom.
