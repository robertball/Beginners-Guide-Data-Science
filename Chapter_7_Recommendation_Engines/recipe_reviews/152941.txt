This is a winner! It does taste just like the Greek dish.  I used a can of crescent rolls I had and is worked perfect.  I suppose you could top it with pie crust as well.  I also used fresh spinach chopped.  We will make this again.  Thank you so much!

I made this at a family gathering and everyone loved it, or they are very good liars! They also asked for the recipe.

Good and quite easy to make, though mine came out a little dry.  The provalone at the bottom was my favorite part. :)

I thought this was blahhhhh.  Nothing special at all and I love spinach pie.

Flavor was delicious. If I make it again, however, I think I'll stir a beaten egg through the mixture to make it stick together a little more.
