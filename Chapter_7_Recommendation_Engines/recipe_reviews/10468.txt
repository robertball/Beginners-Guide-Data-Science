I like the flavor of these cookies-not too sweet. But I found them to be very difficult to roll even after refrigerating the dough overnight. Very messy, of course the kids loved that part, but I didn't! :o)

Everyone always asks me where I got the recipe. I think they are the best sugar cookie I have ever eaten they are easy to mix but not so easy to lift and put on the sheet but after that watch out they disappear fast. the only recipe I use now!
