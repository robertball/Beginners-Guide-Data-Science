Ohhh, don't ever cook pasta with oil in the water! That is my only criticism of this recipe.  In fact, it really IS lovely linguine. While the pasta was cooking I heated the olive oil, butter and garlic, just eyeballing everything rather than precisely measuring.  Rather than serving it OVER the pasta I just tossed everything altogether. Simply a beautiful as well as delicious side dish pasta.  I served this with "Creamy Mustard and Tarragon Chicken," recipe also from this site.

Excellent basic simple recipe to adapt to your style.  Fast and easy....I cut back on the butter, added hot pepper flakes to the butter and garlic at the beginning, then added alot of parm/romano cheese.  Adding the cheese made it more of a sauce. Very good flavors with the extra garlic and pepper flakes....without them it probably would need some help.  A definite keeper.

Great dish, no reason to change anything. I've been a fire house cook for 24 years. This is an excellent dish. If people change ingredients then create your own recipe and post. And for Naples comment, there is nothing wrong with adding olive oil to your boiling noodles when the dish is oil based with olive oil or butter. Your misconception comes from pasta dishes where you don't want oil in the noodle water as it causes the sauce to repel from the noodle on the plate. Enjoy!

Five stars isn't enough for this great recipe!  Thank you Marikabar for posting it.  I made this gluten free with brown rice spaghetti noodles and it is so good my gluten eating husband declared his 37 year favorite pot roast meal has been replaced.  It is very similar to a garlic spaghetti we used to get at a small family Italian restaurant years ago.  

I made a few changes to accommodate my pantry and being gluten free.  First I halved the recipe which makes enough for 2 people to eat to just short of gluttony.   I've found it isn't necessary or even desirable to cook gluten free noodles in oily water so I  used the olive oil in the garlic/red pepper mix along with the butter.  I used 1 teaspoon of dried thyme along with 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil with the garlic for my seasoning.  I served this as a side dish with grilled pork loin chops and Italian flatbread and fresh cherry tomatoes.  I should also admit to making it twice in four days!  It's that good!

This was really delicious and different. I cooked the garlic and warmed the peppers in the pot that I cooked the linguine in to avoid using another pot. Then I put the drained linguine back into the pot with the other ingredients. Added some grated parmesan on top and it was wonderful. Thanks!

First of all, being Italian, I was pleasantly surprised to see that someone finally used the correct word, linguinE, instead of linguinI. I found this pasta dish very delicate but tasty at the same time and I'll make it again for sure. On a personal note, I don't understand people who completely change recipes and then give them a low rating. If you want something elaborate with 300 different flavors make something different, but if you want to try a light and delicate pasta dish, just stick to the recipe and rate it for what it's meant to be.

I loved this recipe. It was extremely quick and easy to make. I substituted minced garlic and dried thyme for the fresh garlic and thyme. I added a little more peppers, and a little bit of other seasonings as well. Served it with some garlic bread. Very delicious!

Delicious meal, very light. I didn't have thyme, so I used basil and oregano as a substitute, which seemed to work. I also added Parmesan cheese on top, which complimented the dish well.

Made this for lunch & it was pretty good (I cut the recipe down to 2 servings). I used dried thyme as my thyme plant has gone dormant. I also added a bit of olive oil to the butter, used to saute the garlic in, to help prevent the butter from burning. Topped my plate w/ freshly grated parmesan & served it w/ a flaky croissant. Good lunch...thanks MARIKABAR!

Very nice, and very easy.  I didn't put oil in the pasta water--instead, I used olive oil in the pan to cook the garlic, then added about 1/3 of the butter and the rest of the ingredients.  I'm not exactly sure I understood the amount of the red pepper--I have a huge jar of red peppers from Costco, and there were only three in there.  Perhaps they are big; I don't know, but I used two for about half the pasta, which resulted in a lot of roasted red pepper.  I suppose that worked just fine, as it was pretty good!  I also put the linguine (I used spaghetti) in with the sauce, mixed it in, then served from there.  Very nice with salad and texas toast.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very Good surprisingly since it is so simple. I used dried spice instead of fresh and added chicken. I put it over bow tie pasta. It was great! I will definately make this again.

This is pretty bland and with all the changes others have made to improve it... well, it's just not all that tasty to me.  If you wanted a whole meal of it, you need more than 2 ounces of pasta for each person. And a few more veggies and less better.

This was worth five stars to begin with! Simple, few ingredients and delicious! I did add sun-dried tomatoes and more garlic (I'm a garlic fiend), but the recipe listed was great on it's own. Thank you!

I ditched the thyme and used basil instead - yummy! This is meant to be a very light dish, so if you are looking for hearty, look elsewhere. But if you want a light, tasty dish that you can put together in a very short time, this is a great dish for you. I thought it was very good for what it is. If it's too light for you as a meal, make it as a side dish to something heartier.

Other than adding twice the amount of garlic, & using dried thyme rather than fresh, I didn't change a thing & it is delicious!  I used 2 t. dried thyme that came from my garden last summer.  I also roast my own peppers when they are getting old.  I cut them in large pieces after roasting & keep them in the freezer to add to recipes as needed.  This is a perfect meal for meatless Mondays or Fridays during Lent.
