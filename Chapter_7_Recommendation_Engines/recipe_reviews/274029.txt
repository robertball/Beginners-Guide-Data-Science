I chunked the chicken instead of having strips. The chicken was very moist. Otherwise I done it like it said. I served mashed potatoes with it. We put the chicken beside and used the sauce for the gravy. I'll probably make it again.

Liked it very much, though since I didn't have the amount of chicken called for, I changed the sauce ingredient amounts (by look and feel) and it was very hot, which is saying A LOT for us. But it was delicious.

I made it like it said, except I halved the chili powder since I am sensitive to hot spices. I used two chicken breasts, and only had enough of the spice coating for half of it. So I had to make up more coating to finish coating the chicken. I thought the sauce was a bit thin, and wondered if it should have some flour added to help coat the chicken and thicken the sauce. It was OK, even Husband wasn't too impressed with it. I served it over rice and added peas for the vegetable. It didn't take that long to make, so I can see it for a busy weeknight dinner.

This was the strangest chicken dish,  it lacked flavor, in fact it lacked everything.    I was embarrassed to serve this.
