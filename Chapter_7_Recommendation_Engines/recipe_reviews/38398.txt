This is a great recipe!  I turned this into a cobbler to cut down on the cholesterol. I eliminated the pie crusts and substituted a crumb topping made from brown sugar, oatmeal & walnuts.

A 5 out of 5!!!  This pie is terrific.  Normally, I have a difficult time making good pie dough, but this one was absolutely delightful, both to work with and to eat. :)  I didn't have time to chill it 4 hours, so I only chilled it for 1 - and it still was a dream to roll out.

I used my own frozen raspberries, blueberries, and rhubarb in this recipe, and the fresh apples called for.  By the time I put that into my pie crusts, there simply wasn't any more room for the strawberries - so I left them out, and didn't even miss them.  One thing I would suggest: serve this pie when it's totally cooled off, *not* warm from the oven.  I served it warm, and the juice from all the berries made it really runny.  I was a little upset at first, thinking I didn't add enough flour or something, but when it cooled off, it was a perfect consistency and thickness.

I will be saving the pie dough recipe for all my pie recipes from now on, and I'll DEFINITELY be making this recipe again!

After reading all the reviews, I figured this pie would be delicious with whatever you put in it, and I had a large amount of strawberries, blueberries and nectarines in my fridge that needed to be used up quick. I halved the recipe for one pie and used my three fruits and as one reviewer suggested, used 4T cornstarch in place of the tapioca since I didn't have any. I also used a storebought crust, just being lazy I guess. So yummy, not too sweet, a little on the tart side from my nectarines, it's just a good all around recipe that you can tailor to whatever you have on hand.

Ok, so I used this recipe and comments as a "guide!" I used frozen mixed berries, rhubarb, an apple (total fruit about 6 cups) and Pillsbury pie crusts. I partially defrosted and drained the fruit. Used one cup of sugar, 1/3 cup flour and about 1 1/2 tablespoons of tapioca.  I made one pie and it was fabulous! I will make this again! Everyone raved about it!

This is the first bumbleberry pie I have ever made or tasted and it is divine!! (After searching the internet and reading up on the history of "Bumbleberry " pie, I decided on this recipe because it seemed like the tastiest mixture of fruit, and I was not dissapointed.) I have made 5 of them already.  I have to say that the pie crust is very easy to make, as well as light and flaky, but it was missing the flavor that butter gives to a crust, so I think I will use some butter in it next time. Try it! It's a wonderful addition to your pie recipe collection!

These pies are excellent- my husband loves fruit pie and he said that pies don't get any better than this! I used frozen mixed berries(I cut up the whole strawberries) and rhubarb and did not thaw the fruit. I also made the crust with half unsalted butter and half shortening and increased the salt to 1/2 tsp. Also, dotted pie filling with butter and brushed crust with milk and sprinkled with sugar crystals. Yum, yum!

This is my new favorite pie! I left out the apples, because we don't like them, and it was still delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time is to pre-cook the bottom crust for a few minutes. Mine wasn't as brown on the bottom as I would have liked.

This is the first time I've ever had, made or heard of Bumbleberry Pie, and since I had most of the ingredients on hand, I had to give it a try. I used 1 1/2 cups each of frozen strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries, thawed and drained, no rhubarb, and 1 red delicious apple, which came up to 1 1/2 cups. I subbed 2tsp corn starch for the tapioca and went with my own crust and this? Is just too yummy. Another commenter said that this pie is very forgiving of substitutions and I have to agree. Like other commenters, I also agree that this pie needs to cool before you eat it or it will be runny. This might also be a good recipe to use for just a one berry pie - either way, I have a feeling this is going to become a new summer staple around my house!

I made this pie with a crumble topping of oats, brown sugar, flour, walnuts and butter. It turned out delicious and it didn't last long! I also used cornstarch instead of the tapioca. Very good pie, not too sweet. Highly reccomended!

I love this recipe! This is going to be a pie I make every year it is so good. It has the perfect amount of sugar, not too sweet at all I did replace the tapioca with 4 Tbs of cornstarch, because I never have tapioca on hand.  As wonderful as this recipe is as is, you can change out the berries to suite your tastes. I replaced 1c raspberry with blackberry. I also replaced a cup of the apples for cherries. and thought they added to the pie.

I don' t normally write reviews but this pie was so delicious I was compelled to write one. I have made homemade fruit pies for years and always find it difficult to get the right consistency and balance between sweet and tart.  This recipe nailed it! The various fruit favors had a party in my mouth- WOW! I will say making the pie was a little labor intensive as it took me a while to cut up all of the fruit. I used my own tried and true crust recipe and this pie couldn't have turned out better. Many thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Love, Love, Love it. I leave out the strawberries and use the apples, rhubard and a frozen berry blend of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries. I use enough to make 6 cups of total fruit (for one pie) and I must admit, I use my own crust recipe, but it is very similar!. Super delish! Thanks for bringing back memories of my restaurant days and serving bumbleberry pie.

My Mom's favorite pie is Strawberry Rhubarb, but no one else in our family likes it. So if one is purchased or made, my Mom ends up with a lot of pie to eat. I happened upon a pie at our local farmer's market that included berries, apples and rhubarb and I thought it would be a great compromise for all involved! Then I was overjoyed when I found a similiar recipe in here, that I might be able to duplicate. The filling as everyone has said is awesome! I however made this pie with a crumb top and next time I may even make it into a crisp as that is my preference. I'm not a great pie maker, unfortunately. Thank you TeddyMom1 for sharing your recipe!

Great recipe!  I made it today to take with me to a dinner party.  Rave reviews all around :)  Easy too.  I used my grandma's pie crust recipe, but followed this one exactly for the filling.  Just tart and sweet enough.  Will definitely make again... and again...

This was great! This is only the second pie I have ever made and it turned out great. I used store bought crust due to time constraints. I made it for my church Thanksgiving lunch and surprised all the older ladies that a guy can bake. I only brought home one small piece from both pies. I had a little trouble finding rhubarb but after four different stores I finally found it. I used frozen for all the fruits except for the apples and had no problems. Make sure that you let them thaw out a little first so you don't have to much added moisture. I also recommend having a very large bowl when combining everything as it made it much easier and very little risk of some of it spilling out. Will definitely make this again.

P.S. I have to thank my wife as she did help with some pointers as I was putting it all together. I was very glad for the help as I didn't want to screw it up!

This pie was excellent.  I used my own crust, frozen berries and fresh granny smith apples.  I defrosted the rhubarb slightly so it would bake at the same time as the berries and apples.  My family loved it.

This is the first fruit pie I have ever made and it couldn't have turned out better! I made this with apples, rhubarb, strawberries and blackberries, and it is by far the best pie I ever tasted. I'll never buy a pie again. This recipe was so simple and so delicious, so there's no comparison when it comes to the store-bought ones.

This was my first attempt at a pie, and it turned out perfectly.  My family and work friends are still talking about it 3 months later.  I will definitely make this again.  The only change I made was to add 7-up instead of water.

Oh my goodness!  This pie surpassed my expectations and was declared by my husband to be "the best pie I've ever had"!  He offered me $300 not to take the second pie to a potluck today! I made my own crust and prepared the filling exactly as directed, (except I forgot the lemon juice).  I followed one reviewers suggestion to wait until it cooled before serving, and it was not the least bit runny.  As a matter of fact, it was perfect!  Thank you for my new favorite pie recipe!

I have made this recipe many, many times and always get RAVE reviews. I DO cheat and use pie pre-made crusts when I'm in a hurry. However, last fall, I entered the pie in the local pie-making contest, so I HAD to make the crust from scratch. It was awesome...and I made the recipe completely as directed. By the way, my BUMBLEBERRY PIE won 2nd PRIZE. You won't be disappointed with this recipe, fellow pie lovers!

Soooo good! Recipe made one 9 inch and one 10 inch pie...The pastry was really good.  Not overly flaky, but really good. Definately a summer keeper that we'll be making often. Oh...and I followed the advice of another reviewer to let the pie cool completely before cutting! Thanks!

That's a good pie. I didn't put in the rhubarb because we don't like it and it was wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!

I made this recipe without the rhubarb and it was a hit.  Everyone loved it.  I did not use all the dough and at 350 degrees the pies still needed to cook for an additional 20 min.

Love the different flavors and textures of this pie.  The juices came together nicely, and were neither too runny nor too gummy.  I did not use the recipe for the crust, as I have a favorite pie crust recipe that I stick with.  If you are lucky enough to have all of the fresh fruit called for in this recipe, definitely give this one a try.

I made this pie using my own crust recipe, but I can testify that the filling was great. Not too juicy and not too much thickener - just right.  I couldn't find rhubarb, so I used blackberries which worked well. The pie was tart maybe a touch more sugar could be added if you like it sweeter.

This pie was ok, not great or terrible just in between. The grocery store did not have any rhubarb so I made the pie exactly per the recipe minus that. I like berry pies to be sweeter. This one was not sweet enough for me. Personally I would rate this three stars but the other two friends who ate it each rated it a four and a five so I went with four stars.

The 1st time I used the crust recipe given.  It is beautiful to work with, but I prefer the taste of my own.   The filling is fabulous!  Give it ample time to cool or the berries will ooze everywhere.

YUMMY!!!!  I did not use strawberries or rhubarb, but some apples, raspberries,blueberries and dried sweetened cranberries.  It was a little runny, so I would add some cornstarch next time.  The taste was out of this world-Great Recipe!  Oh, I used a different crust recipe.  I had some left and made one with a crumb topping    too.  SOOOOO GOOOOD!

Amazing!  The best summer berry pie I've ever had.  Followed the recipe and it came out perfectly.  Have made once with fresh berries and once with frozen.  Definitely better with the fresh berries.

I used what I had on hand - 4 cups apples, 2 cups rhubarb, 2 cups blackberries and 4 cups strawberries. I also used 4T cornstarch in place of the tapioca, and store bought pie crust to save time. I'm allergic to strawberries, but my whole family said this pie was perfect. Just the right sweet-tart combination and great flavor. Thanks!

This pie is mmmmmm good!  I decided to add some blackberries as well.  I suggest that you use a cooking apple such as macintosh as the others are a bit hard and needed to cook longer.  Also because of it being a bit running when not completely cooled...try another teas. of tapioca to thicken it up.  Otherwise...it's fantastic!

Not very good.  Haven't had a lot of bumbleberry pies - mostly store bought.  I had never made one before and much prefer a store bought one to this one, although I prefer to do my own home baking.

5+++.  Excellent pie & crust recipe.  I used the crust recipe as is - perfect & very forgivable.  Like the other reviewers, I made substitutions using what I had on hand ~ 12 cups of mixed strawberries, peaches, blackberries, and rhubarb.  I didn't have the tapioca, so I used corn starch per another reviewers suggestions.  Came out perfect, & the best tasting pie ever.

This is the perfect pie. My favorite. Note: I thought the pie was a little thin, so I double the filling recipe. As a result, the tapioca never cooked all the way. Next time I'll experiment with instant tapioca. Update: Instant tapioca is no good. The texture of the whole pie was really gooey and weird, and I missed the texture of the regular tapioca beads. It is definitely worth using regular tapioca even if that means sacrificing the deep dish pie.

This makes such a juicy flavorful pie! I substituted cornstarch for tapioca. Had never tried rhubarb, pleasantly surprised. I would recommend including the apples if you do the rhubarb because they compliment each other very well.

I got rave reviews from all the neighbors I made this for! I did not have raspberries on hand, so I supplemented with additional rhubarb and strawberries. I also did not have tapioca, so I took the advice of another reviewer and used cornstarch and water. So good! I wish it were still summer so I could make it again and again! Thank you!

Off the (pie) chart. :-)  This makes a fabulous pie.  My husband didn't want me to give away the second one.  It fully qualifies for REAL whip cream or the "good stuff" ice cream.

This pie is GREAT! I didn't have any apples, so I substituted extra strawberries and rhubarb.  I also subsituted 1/2 of the sugar for splenda for my diabetic husband and it was still sweet and delicious!

Mine I would call "refrigerator" pie as I just used fruit I had -- rhubarb, strawberries, apples, plums, and pears.  Did not use tapioca, just increased flour a bit.  Delicious!

Got rave reviews! Everyone loved it! They were a little skeptical about all of the different ingredients but were very impressed with the flavor! I hate making pie crust so I just used the ready made roll out kind, but the filling was amazing. I have a hard time with pies and their filling consistency, but this turned out great! Will definitely be making this one again.

Awesome! tastes really fresh. Still comes out really good If you can't find rhubarb. :) Also, used an extra scoop of tapicoa because I've heard you can't use too much and turned out, perfect consistency.

OH MY GOSH!  Best pie ever!!!!!  I added more apples than called for because I love to stack the fruit high, and it turned out such a wonderful flavor!  I also only had apples, blueberries and frozen strawberries.  YUMMY!!!!  I had to bake it a lot longer than it called for but it turned out so good!

This was a HUGE pie!  I had to use an extra deep pie plate!  I added a bit of cream of tarter to it.  I sent it to work with my husband.  He said it was set up nicely (I was worried it wouldn't) and him and the guys loved it!  ;-)

I needed to make a pie and didn't have time to run to the grocer's.  I used apple-rhubarb jam instead of sugar, arrow root instead of tapioca, added blackberries, and dropped the rhubarb and lemon juice.  
Still delicious!  What a great pie!  This recipe was so forgiving of substitues!

Anytime I make this it is a big hit. Rhubarb does not grow where I live and I also couldn't find any in grocery stores (canned or fresh!) so I have left it out a few times and the pie is still amazing. I've also cheated many times and bought frozen pre-cut fruit and haven't been able to tell the difference.

I used frozen berries that I mixed together this summer plus extra blueberries I had on hand. I used four honey crisp apples but no rhubarb as I forgot to thaw some out. I also used corn starch to thicken, along with the flour. 
This time I made just one pie and it was heaping with fruit. This is one of my favourite go-to recipes.

I use this as a base for a mixed berry pie using whatever berries I have available. I do put my berries and the flour, etc. on the stovetop and stir just long enough to thicken my pie filling. The 6 cups of fruit for one pie is spot on.

Ok I can't do a fancy crust like you guys but this was as easy as p-.....1-2-3.  The top of this thing came our like candy.   I thought the strawberries made the filling kinda runny, so I tossed in a little granola.  Worked like a charm!

Can't count the crust as it was from the freezer aisle at the store. That said, the innards were lovely; I subbed cornstarch for the tapioca and seasoned with nutmeg and cinnamon. Also didn't have a lemon so I used lime. It gelled after cooling and it tasted like a fruit salad baked in juiciness. My hubby raved; my dog craved and I liked it, though apple and strawberry rhubarb rule, but that's a personal preference. Thanks.

One of my all-time favorite pies.  It is surprisingly good.  The blend of flavors creates a new, and even better, flavor.

Awesome recipe - the whole family loved it. The filling is delicious (I used my own crust recipe).  I didn't have any tapioca, so I substituted cornstarch, in an equal amount.

Adding quick tapioca is awesome. I put a layer of graham cracker crumbs on the bottom to absorb some goodness and then a sprinkle on top.  Adds a great flavor

Loved this, even though I had never tried rhubarb before.  I tried using cornstarch instead of tapioca like someone suggested and it didn't work for me, was too runny.  Loved it anyway.  Will make again!

I made this pie for a birthday and we loved it.  I used my own crust recipe (why mess with a good thing) but followed the filling recipe with the exception of replacing the tapioca with cornstarch as I didn't have any.  It was excellent.  I ended up making one large pie and 6 smaller ones to freeze.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

I made this for a pie contest and everyone loved it! It won first place! Although the filling and everything was great, I had trouble with the pie crust recipe, so I ended up having to go buy some at the store.. Oh, well! Overall, it was a big hit.

This by far, is one of the best recipes. I too, have replaced the tapioca with cornstarch and turns out perfectly. Pending on season, have also added Black Berries,  Cherries and Saskatoon Berries. Family is not a fan of pies, so have used berry mixture for cheese cakes, cakes, muffins and topping on softened Brie on croissants or lightly toasted baguettes.
