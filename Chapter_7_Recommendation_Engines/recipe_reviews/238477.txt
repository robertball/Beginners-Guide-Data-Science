Very easy to make, and the flavor is great!!! I used a Chinese "Chili Garlic Sauce that was available at my local supermarket, and it came out perfectly...

This is just like the Korean Cucumber Kimchi we enjoyed in Seoul. Delicious. We make this weekly and give mason jars of it to our family and friends. I recommend using English cukes  as recommended in the recipe, quarter as directed, but, remove the seeds (reduces the water).  We sweat the cukes then place in paper towels to fully dry, then pack in mason jars proportionally placing the appropriate amount of kimchi sauce in each jar ( we make a 4X batch each time). They  stay crisp for weeks. Great recipe!

Very nice, made it the other day to have as a side dish with some homemade miso ramen. I cut my cukes smaller than the recipe states, cut it into eights instead of quarters, then cut each of those into 1 inch pieces so they're bite sized. Very nice, look forward to eating more of them in the future.

So simple and so good. Made a couple adjustments since I live in the middle east and a few ingredients aren't available.  But still awseome!

Very easy to make. I did make a few substitutions using ingredients I had on hand. I used sea salt instead of kosher salt. I substituted apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar. I substituted soy sauce in place of the fish sauce. I used powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger, and I used gochujang (Korean hot sauce) instead of the hot chili oil and Korean red pepper. I also added sesame seeds and sesame seed oil. So no, my version's not 100% authentic Korean. We'll see how it tastes when my parents come over for dinner on Sunday!

Not too salty at all but you have to use kosher salt NOT table salt and rinse about 6 times. This was Delish.. Hubby ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner until gone. I made this as is only adding a second English cucumber. 
This recipe is spot on and will be making for years to come.
Thank you for sharing this...

So easy, only changed the amount of Korean chile powder, since I like it a little hotter..  Thanks again for posting this recipe .
