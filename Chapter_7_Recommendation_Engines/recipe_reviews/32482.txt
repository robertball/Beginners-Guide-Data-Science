This recipe was awesome. If you like chocolate then you'll like this. I don't suggest that you put chocolate chips in. Also, I only got 1 serving out f it instead of 2. But other than that,it's a favorite!

There's not enough liquid in this recipe to "mix", at least not when I put all the ingredients in the mixer.  Everything just kind of stood there and I had to use a spoon to shuffle the contents, then I had to add more milk (about 1/2 cup?) just to get things moving on a consistent basis.  Last, there were 2-3 large chunks of ice leftover in the shake, and I had the blender on the next to highest speed.  Taste was finally ok, but would probably leave out about 1/2 the chocolate syrup.  For me, just too much modification to the recipe for it to be complete and work in the blender.

I made this for one this morning, adding a tablespoon of instant coffee granules.
Reminds me of the Big Train coffee drinks that I love so much here from my favorite coffee stand. God bless you for posting this recipe. TIP: Next time I'm thinking of adding smushed Oreo cookies to make it more like a Cookies and Cream Big Train.

Oh, my kids were excited about this one.  Chocolate, blended with more chocolate, and then more chocolate on top of that.  Huge hit!

This recipe is good but needs a few changes, first it was delicious but a bit chocolaty so i added a scoop of vanilla icecream also, it didn't make that much so i would double the amounts that the recipe gives you.  Also it turns out very good but the ice might not blend as well and might make it a bit chunky, but the good thing is ice is water so it can melt!  Overall this is a very good recipe and I would reccomend it to everyone!

I used hot chocolate drink mix instead of chocolate drink mix, but otherwise made exactly according to the recipe and it was so good! I will be making this often!

I love chocolate milkshakes. Not so fond of the chocolate chips though. The pieces kind of froze and were crunchy. It might be because of my blender though?

It's like drinking cake batter; not at all like a milkshake. It was tasty, but I am NOT impressed!

Whoa, this should be named death by chocolate shake! There was no way my mixer was going to budge, and I have a strong one, with 2 tsp of milk. I ended up using 3 Tblsp. and it worked. For the chocolate drink mix I used Ovaltine, as it didn't specify. The only other change I made was using low fat dairy products and sugar free chocolate syrup, which I do all the time. It was just too much chocolate for me with chocolate ice cream, chocolate malt, chocolate syrup, and chocolate chips. The ingredients increased their richness together. I could drink about 1/2 of the half a cup or so serving. I also had picked this one for the lowest of the calories, per shake, but now I am starting to wonder about the accuracy of the numbers considering all the ingredients. The other person did finish off their drink no problem though.

Its delicious, While i used more milk and chocolate chip icecream instead, it tasted awesome. Odd texture and hard to blend, but very good.
