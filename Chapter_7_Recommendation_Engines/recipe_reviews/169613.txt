excellent.  i made a few adjustments based on what i had on hand - (1) swapped out the oats for 1/4 cup of flax seed and (2) went with 3/4 lb of ground beef + 3/4 pound of ground turkey (no pork).  perfect, will have the leftovers tonight and definitely make it again.

This is very good.  We're always looking for new ideas for apples in the fall.  I used venison instead of beef/pork and it still came out great.  I also added thin slices of apples on top of the meatloaf that were basted with worcester - definitely a good decision.  4-year old cheddar added a sharper flavor to the meatloaf and was very good.  Next time I would add an extra layer of cheese on top and perhaps more apples in the loaf.

I more than doubled this recipe. I altered it just a bit to avoid having to go to the store, and used more apple because it needed to be used, but it was close enough for me to say - try it. My husband and son loved it, and I made so much that I have two small loaves frozen for a quick meal anytime.

This meatloaf recipe is by far the best meatloaf recipe ever! I doubled the recipe and did use more apples that what it called for. Instead of 2/3 cup of apple, I used an overflowing cup. I served it with a mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. My family kept commenting during the dinner, and after. It is definately a keeper!!

A dense and hearty, stick to your ribs meatloaf with a hint of cheese.  Used one packet of instant oatmeal (which is just shy of a 1/2 cup), and two Italian sausages (casings removed), omitted salt & pepper.  Baked for one hour at 350 degrees.

I thought this was ok. I used more apples then it said to based on reviews and still really no apple flavor.

I was not sure about the apples and cheese together but it turned out really well with the exception of the high salt content (too much for my taste)everyone loved it! The texture was all together firm yet tender. I remember now, I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I used a lite soy sauce and that may have made it too salty. I will make this again.

I love apples and onion together so I figured this would be a no-brainer.  It was good, and definitely stayed very moist, but I'm not convinced the apple actually added much more than moisture.  I might up the apple, change the pork/ground beef ratio and play up the apple flavor instead of letting it fade away.  To be fair, that could be the gala apple I used. I'd say it's worth a shot to see if your family likes it.

Great Meatloaf, used ground venison from a white tail, and some left over ground pork trimmings, 3/4C of diced apple and an extra sharp cheddar. Plenty moist yet did not crumble too bad.

This was nice and dense and made a fantastic leftover cold meatloaf sandwich.  I did want more apple flavor. And the cheese was a bit salty/overpowering. Next time I'll try upping the apple a bit, and reducing the cheese.

I thought this was only ok.  I loved the idea of it and was really excited to make it, but it just turned out ok.  It was neither cheesy nor apple-y.  I couldn't really taste any apples or cheese.  It made a nice, moist meatloaf, but there were no interesting flavors that I had hoped for.

This was delicious & very moist! I used a whole apple. Didn't taste the cheese but it was good regardless. Made with Butternut Squash Apple Cranberry Bake from the Simply Recipes site. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was really bland and my husband said he doesn't like it at all. Sorry. Won't be making this again. I'm going to go back to the tried and true Rempel family meatloaf from this site.

Very tasty. Love the apples in with the meat! I did add a little more apples to the meat. I also used Italian bread crumbs and add about a clove of garlic. Super yummy! Will definitely be making this one again.

I'm on a health kick so I made a couple edits. I replaced the beef with ground turkey and added applesauce for moisture. I left out the salt but added steak seasoning. It held together well and my family really enjoyed it. I will make it again.

This recipe was unbelievable--my husband went back for seconds and asked for leftovers!  I tweaked a bit as I did not have any ground pork.  To compensate I just lessened the other ingredients slightly and made a smaller loaf with the 1 lb of ground beef only. I also spread a simple topping of 1/4 c. ketchup plus 1T. mustard before baking. Simply superb!

Pretty good, but mine needed more salt. I'm also not sure if my thermometers weren't working or not but mine seemed too dry at the recommended internal temperature. I didn't have any ground pork, like I thought I did so I also did all beef so that probably made a difference too. I'd try this again with the pork.

I did make a couple of changes, but it was still the same recipe and the apple was terrific.  I just plain forgot the cheddar cheese.  Used one whole apple (McIntosh), minced, didn't measure.  Added one stalk minced celery, and reduced the onion a bit.  Reduced the Worcestershire.  Used 2 eggs.  It was very good and moist and the little bit of sweetness and tang from the apple was wonderful.  I served it with homemade mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes.  Thank you for the recipe.  To those who say there was no apple flavor, I wonder what variety of apple you were using.  Or, perhaps were you eating it with ketchup, which would cover up the appleness.  I normally put ketchup on meatloaf, but would not put ketchup on this one.

Yes, I would definitely make it again...I did add some garlic powder to the meat mixture and can't make any meatloaf without adding the catsup/brown sugar mixture for the top of the loaf...no bacon, just catsup and brown sugar.  This was definitely a keeper.

I didn't have beef, so I used only pork and used apple cinnamon oats that my son never ate.  It was a hit and I am making it again this evening.  I love that it is so open to interpretation.

I was never a big fan of meatloaf but my husband always was.  His mother used to make an apple meatloaf so I decided to look up recipes. When I came across this I decided to give it a try using just beef. I loved it but made a few adjustments the next time I made it, doubling the apple and tomato paste instead of worcestershire. But definitely a great recipe!!!

Love this recipe.  Made it exactly following recipe (other than doubling the recipe and shaping into 3 loafs in a large pan in order to freeze and save two) and I enjoyed it but hubby thought it had a little too much filler (bread crumbs).  Now I modify it just a bit:  ground turkey, a scant quarter cup of wheat germ to replace the 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, a little extra apple, and it's perfect for our whole family!

Very, very good recipe.  Great combination of flavors.    I didn't change anything at all, and it turned out fantastic.  Very moist, flavorful and simple.  Even my picky inlaws liked this.
