I have now made this twice and both times all asked for the dressing recipe.  I followed exactly with the following exceptions :-). : I always start out using only half oil called for and then add to taste, did not add salt to dressing, and lastly used just a squirt of Srichachi hot sauce.  Dressing to die for, yummy, sticks to the leaves and not overly oily..very tangy.  Salad itself can have stuff added to your tastes: I used sundried tomatoes and next time will also add fresh thin sliced mushrooms.  Making for Christmas Eve dinner to cut the richness of the man dish.  To let you know how good this is, it's the first recipe I've ever reviewed and I've used allrecipes.com for years now.

Wonderful recipe!!!  This will be a staple in our house!  Used olive oil instead of vegetable, and red wine vinegar in place of the apple cider vinegar but the rest was the same.  Perfect!!

This review is for the dressing only.  I saw this mentioned on the Buzz the other day and thought it would  be good as a chicken marinade and basting sauce.  And I'm happy to report, I was right!  We loved it!  I made half the dressing as written, but cut back on the salt, adding it to taste.  I made it a day ahead to allow the flavors to meld, and the next morning I poured some over skinless boneless chicken and let it marinate all day.  When grilling, Hubs basted the chicken with some additional dressing, which gave it a beautiful sheen.  Hubs couldn't stop raving about it, so I'm sure we'll be repeating this one and often!  And, I'm sure I'll be trying the salad as well.  It sounds wonderful!

That salad itself was good, the dressing was not. I did not care of the taste of ketchup in the dressing. It ruined it for me. Will not make again.

Great recipe! The dressing is really good. I only used about half the oil, which was plenty, and used pine nuts instead of almonds and sunflower seeds since that is what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY as written. I made the dressing an hour or so in advance to let the flavors meld ........ before serving I tasted the dressing ......... not to my liking ..... too much flavor from the ketchup. I quickly made up a traditional vinaigrette ...... salad was good!

I have been using this recipe for at least 20 yrs now and it's an easy and excellant recipe. The only thing that's different is the addition of almondsotherwi and the original also puts onion into blender with the dressing ingredientsotherwise the same recipe that's been made for years.

Just like the other reviews, this is a major home run.  I made this for a paleo potluck and received many compliments.  Instead of sugar, I use xylitol and also xylitol ketchup, and then I also substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil.  It's a keeper.

Holy smokes this salad was amazing! I was a bit leery at first reading what went into the dressing but was quickly taken back by the flavor of the dressing with all of the fixings tossed together. I subbed Olive oil for the veg. oil and it worked great. I added chicken to my dish to give it a bit more protein. We will be having this again.

This salad dressing was good, but not what I was looking for.  The addition of ketchup makes this like a sweet French or Russian dressing.  I was looking for the typical sweet/sour dressing that goes on a spinach/bacon/egg salad.  Not sure if I would make this one again?  Although, my husband and son did like it.

This is the best spinach salad we have ever had. I did not change anything.  I now buy fresh spinach just to make this.  Any left overs go into lunches for the next day.

I was looking for a dressing for a spinach salad and came across this. The dressing is very good. I also cut back on the oil by about 1/3. I used most of the ingredients listed except for the almonds and sunflower seeds. Nice recipe!

Interesting dressing idea, it was pretty dog gone good.  Instead of vegetable oil, I used some of the bacon grease.

We really enjoyed this especially the dressing just awesome. I only left out the almonds out of personal preference. This is one we will be using when we have spinach on hand. Thanks so much!

Great recipe. Love the salad and LOVE the dressing.  I frequently make the dressing to use on my salads every day.
