I needed a sweet in a hurry and this was great. I didn't use all the cinnamon sugar topping and it was still very sweet. Quick and easy.

These cookies are tasty! All I had was a sheet pan so I used that.(Dimensions are a little different.) I brushed the egg white on with a marinating brush and used a sifter to sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on top evenly. My three year old says these cookies are yummy.

These cookies turned out really well though a little short. Fairly easy to make but I had some difficulty with smoothing out the dough into the jelly roll pan. But otherwise they looked and tasted great! Also thanks for using my picture! =

These are really yummy and quick to make. To make them a little healthier I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. I was not able to spread the batter across the entire 15x7 jelly roll pan and will use a smaller pan next time. Spreading the mixture is tricky--spraying your fingers w/ PAM helps move it around.

My daughter and I made these cookies, delicious and fast! We added a teaspoon of almond extract which really gave these an awesome flavor.

I was really looking forward to making these cookies given the ingredients. I found spreading the cookie portion to be challenging. Also I found one egg white was either not sufficient or spreading it across the cookie mixture difficult. If I make this cookie in the future I will add more egg whites and a touch more butter to keep the cookie portion not so crumbly and difficult to work with.

Tasty buttery and easy to make. We found they tasted much like snickerdoodles without the need to shape each one. Used pecans since it was all we had - very good. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Found myself with a cookie craving at about 11pm and no baking powder which led me to this recipe. The first try was based off a recipe that was wrong on it's measurement so I ended up with a tasteless cake like thing. But the second time around perfection only I added brown sugar to the initial mix and to the topping:) sweet satisfaction!

Wonderful cookies. I can't imagine anyone not thinking the same thing. I used all butter and I am wondering how they would have been different if I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine. I made 24 cookies and they were still quite large.
