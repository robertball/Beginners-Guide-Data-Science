My only complaint was that the center of the loaf was a little mushy.  The next time I make it I'll try using a different pan, maybe even muffin tins!  Otherwise, shaping them into patties might work too.

great recipe, I served it with the dill sauce, everyone loved it. Bonus, next night I formed it into a ball and iced it with the dill sauce covered with sliced green olives.Served with crackers cold. Great appetizer.

I was pleasantly surprised by this, I tried it just for some variety and to get some essential oils and whatnot into our diet without breaking the bank.  It really does have a mousse-like texture and could probably be served hot or cold and could easily be "prettied up" for a dinner party. The only thing I changed was to add half an onion finely chopped.  I had it with a leaf salad and my husband had it with noodles and we were both happy.  Served it with a light mustard cream sauce.

This was a great recipe!  I used frozen salmon instead of canned- just ripped it in pieces (after removing the skin).  It was awesome!  I used Italian style bread crumbs since I had them handy, and put it in a 9 inch pie pan instead of the loaf pan like someone else mentioned.  It was good hot and cold!  Will definitely do this one again.

Scaled this down to 2 servings, used a 6-oz can of Wild Alaskan Salmon, used Egg Beaters to get the cholesterol down a bit, and baked in a mini-loaf pan.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It's a lot healthier than frying salmon patties but, most importantly, it's simply delicious.  Served with Dill Sauce from this site.  Thumbs up in this house!

An awesome, simple, quick recipe.  Pleased my whole family of not picky eaters, and most impressively my picky niece.  I did make some changes.  I did not use the carrots as I couldn't find a grater or food processor. I used a small, diced onion instead.  I couldn't find a loaf pan, so I baked individual loaves in a muffin tin.  This recipe doubled was the perfect amount for a tin.

This was good overall, easy,  and inexpensive to make. Good comfort food; served this alongside mashed potatoes and peas. Yes, a high-carb meal but sometimes that's exactly what we want! Although my husband enjoyed its medium soft texture soon after it came out of the oven, I much preferred it the following day after it had solidified and was cold. Firmer and cold it was easy to cut and to dip into the dill sauce I had made to go along with it the night before. As someone else wrote here, this would make a good appetizer after it has cooled off completely: cut it into bars and serve along with a dipping sauce, and maybe have capers alongside the bars and maybe some garnish like fresh parsley or cilantro for those who want to make it even more to their liking. Next time I will probably add a touch of garlic powder, more onion, a tad less milk, and probably either a small amount of hot sauce or crushed red pepper since I found the original recipe a bit bland. Husband really liked it and said he'd like me to make this again, so I will do so and won't alter the recipe too much beyond the above mentioned changes.

Great recipe! I used canned Atlantic Salmon for this. The carrots gave it a nice flavor, was short on time so I used packaged shredded carrots and microwaved them for 90 seconds. Also I substituted dill weed for the parsley and bought Campbell's Cream of Shrimp soup and diluted it with half a can of milk and added a splash of white cooking wine and a couple of dashes of Bays seasoning and poured it over the slices. A keeper for sure!

This was easy and the baking time was exactly right. I loved the lemon flavor it took on. Served it with a dill sauce which brought the meal to five stars.

I loved this recipe! It is my new recipe for Lent. Next time, I'm thinking of sprinkling the top with capers after pouring the white sauce over it. Thanks.

This is a good basic recipe and I gave it five stars after I made some changes.  I added one large green onion chopped, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2/3 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning, one tsp dried dill and 1/2 cup chopped bell pepper.  I like green peas with salmon so, I substituted the carrots with green peas.  I will make this, again.

I only cooked it for 45 minutes and it was a little dry to me, but my guests loved it! I also separated it into two and saved the second one for the next day. We sliced it and made salmon sandwiches with it!

I'm glad I tried this.  It is very good.  It is more of a mousse. It's light and fluffy.  Not dense like a meat loaf.

I switched the fresh bread crumb with italian seasoned crumbs and switched the parsley with dill.  I also put into two mini loaf pans and baked for 40 min.  Fabulous!  Will definitely make this again.  Served with sour cream dill sauce found on this site.
