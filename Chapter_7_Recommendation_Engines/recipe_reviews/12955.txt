Before trying out a recipe, I always read the reviews.  I took the advice of a couple other reviews and did the following:  used corn instead of peas, used 3 cups of water instead of 1 1/4, used 3 boullion cubes and added one can diced tomatoes.  It was wonderful and easy!  I will make this again!

I make a soup very similar to this, I use a 16 ounce bag of frozen mixed veggies, instead of canned peas.A can of diced tomatoes is also good. I also add 2/3c barley.

My husband thought this was excellent when he added some hot sauce.  It was a little bland for me but good.  Next time I will add some spices when I make it.

I am glad I read all of your reviews before I took this to my workplace.  It was bland so I added oregano, basil, garlic salt, celery salt, onion powder.... I added frozen corn, too. I also added a cup of beef broth since it needed more liquid.  Well, my work place is in the middle of construction right now and a lot of construction workers tried out our food day and my soup was all gone by 10:00am..... They loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe and slow cooked for about 10 hours.  Potatoes were just right then.....

Ok...a 4-ish before a few additions.  Certainly has potential to be 5!  I made a few small changes in the beginning...I didn't have large potatoes, I had small yukon golds, so I just added enough to look like 2 large (lol)...and I cubed them.  I diced the onions instead of slicing them because it's easier to get my kids to eat them that way.  I also used corn instead of peas, beef broth instead of water, added a can of diced tomatoes, and lots of garlic.  I cooked it in the crock on low for about 8 hours.  Tasted it.  It was pretty bland.  I added more beef bouillion granules, more fresh ground pepper, about 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning, and a couple small pinches of cayenne.  Oh, and more garlic.  Put the crockpot on warm and let it "stew" until my bread was finished (about 40 minutes).  The end result was AWESOME!  My kids and hubby were eating like uncivilized heathens!  I had to remind the girls a couple of times to use their table manners.  It was that good!  I'm definitely adding the recipe with changes to my rotation!  Thanks!

The first time I made this I didn't like the condensed tomato soup taste, so now I add 2 cans of diced tomatoes to it and spice it up with an envelope of Knorr's Vegetable Soup.  The recipe as written definitely needs spicing up.

My daughter and I prepared the ingredients the night before and assembled in the crockpot. In the morning I put it on for an hour to remove the chill from the pot and then cooked on low for about 12 hours.  It was wonderful.  I did add a package of stew seasoning (I will try taco seasoning next time), substituted corn for peas and added whole mushrooms which we all love.

This is a great comfort food recipe.  I did use one can of tomatoe soup , and one can of chicken stock before adding the water.  This made it very flavourful.  I also added garlic and some other seasoning to add some zip.  Great served with grilled cheese on a cold Canadian night!!

Like others I doubled the amount of water and also added a jar of canned tomatoes with juice to make it a bit more soupy. I also added more spices with the salt and pepper: oregano, basil, thyme, parsley, garlic, celery salt, and dehydrated onion.
Hearty and delicious!

This is a good recipe that is very adaptable. I added corn and green beans in place of the peas,  an extra can of tomato soup, a can of diced tomatoes and chilies, a couple of beef boullion cubes, more water and some extra spices. I will definitely fix this for my family again when the weather is cooler.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars b/c after making some changes, it turned out really good.  Here's what I did:
-used a bag of frozen veggies instead of canned
-added 1 can stewed tomatoes
-added 1 can tomatoe paste
-1 cup water with beef bouillion cub dissolved
-added fresh red potatoes and okra(one of my favorite veggies not included in frozen pkg.)
-salt/pepper to taste
-splash of worcester shire sauce to pot before cooking all
-used ground turkey rather than beef and cooked with splash of worcestershire sauce/drained
-chopped one large vidalia onion
All of this is in addition to what the recipe called for(except for salt/pepper and potatoes).  I also try to go easy on salting b/c its easy to over-salt and you can always add salt to each serving.  Mix it all up in a crock pot and cook on low at least 7 hours.  I've had three bowls this evening already!  This is a great base recipe that you can add/subtract to according to what suits you.

I love this recipe. I followed the recipe pretty closely but made a few changes. I added 1 can beef broth, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 2 cups mixed vegetables,1 envelope vegetable soup mix and garlic powder. I served it with rye bread and my husband loved it. What a perfect meal-thick and herarty, for a cold night.

I love this! While I keep to the basic recipe, I try use fresh ingredients instead of canned if I can. I often prepare the veggies the night before, except the potatoes which I slice right before cooking. I cook the beef with Red Robin seasoning (a tomato-based seasoning mix; there's a clone recipe for it on line, do a Google search), and use the seasoning for the layers instead of salt and pepper.  Depending upon the weather, I may or may not have to add more water later on, it just depends. We prefer this recipe to be a little thicker, but I think it is a personal preference thing as to consistency.

I am shocked about the positive reviews on this one.  I found this recipe very bland and painfully lacking in flavor.

Overall a really tasty and easy soup.  I did use corn instead of peas, 2 cans of tomato soup instead of 1, added Worcestershire and quite a bit of Tabasco sauce.  I cooked it in on low in the crock pot for 6 hours, but had to finish it off on top of the stove (the potatoes were still a little raw).  The family gobbled it up.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will cook it the full 8 hours next time.

Great little stew. I added some seasonings for taste and pureed a can of stewed tomatoes since I didn't have tomato soup in the pantry. Also added a can of kidney beans. My husband LOVED it! Thanks for the recipe.

I took some advice and doubled the tomato soup, added Worchestershire sauce & Tabasco. Do suggest adding more water than the recipe calls for. Used Corn instead of peas and left the celery out! Added more pepper also.  Overall we liked this recipe.  Would be good on a cold evening.

Fantastic basic soup recipe. After the first try we went with a few modifications: used frozen vegetables instead of canned; used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato soup; added a teaspoon of sugar to counteract the acidity of the crushed tomatoes. We also added a few dried spices to "liven it up"(personal choice): garlic, italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper flakes.

Followed the recipe to the T, and although  we weren't WOW'd by it, it was OK.  It's sort of like a ground beef vegetable soup for lack of a better explanation.  Six servings was spot on.

I used frozen peas, increased the potatoes and carrots a little, used 3 cups beef broth instead of 1-1/4  cup water, and added  1 tsp. chopped garlic, 1 bay leaf and 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce. Very easy to make and delicious!

It was ok!  I had a huge crew coming over so I upped the portions a bit.  I substituted beef broth for the water, tomato sauce for tomato soup, and omitted the peas.  Even after adding garlic powder, onion powder, soy sauce, red wine and parsley the soup was extremely bland.  I added some bullion and it was still bland.  Needs LOTS more garlic, preferably fresh and some bay leaves to bring it up to our 'wow' factor.

So I had to improvise with this - I actually looked at a few different versions of "hamburger soup" or stew. I cooked 1 onion and the ground beef, then threw it into the crock pot with potatoes (not big chunks) and carrots. I improvised and combined other recipe versions by putting 2 beef bullion cubes with 3c water and a can of tomato paste, mixing it all together with bay leaves, celery salt, garlic powder, and pepper, then pouring it over the meat and veggies. I cooked it on high for 3 or 4 hours. It turned out good, the tomato paste made it sorta sweet on top of salty - it was hearty and incredibly flavorful!

I did not read the other reviews first and it was very bland - nothing special.  If you do not like spices this is the recipe for you! I will try again with the spices, etc but I am one to rate a recipe base on how it is written, not on what I had to do to it to make it good!

I made this the other day when not feeling so well and I wanted a recipe that I could use what I had on hand.  I substituted frozen green beans for peas and carrots.  Also I added more seasonings and last 10 minutes I threw in a cup of shredded white american cheese, I think any shredded cheese -- monterey, colby, swiss, would do -- it really made a difference.  Also 4 days later tasted even better.  Next time I'm eliminating the potatoes and serving it over mashed potatoes or rice.

It was so so. Easy but nothing too spectacular. I will probably top the leftovers with mashed potatoes... like shepherd's pie.

I made it exactly as is, and it was wonderful except it needed more liquid!  Very flavorful from all of the veggies!  Since there are only 2 of us, next time I'll cut everything in 1/2 and leave the soup/water portion as is.  I just served with bisquits and it was great.

Nothing exceptionally different, but good, hearty meal that was satisfying.  However, if you want it to be a soup, add a second can of tomato soup and water (and even then it was more stew-like).  Skip the canned peas (canned peas are never a good idea in anything anyway), and maybe add some garlic.  Will definitely make this again though, with those modifications in mind.

I made the recipe as written but I found it to be too bland for my taste.  My wife liked it.  I added some hot sauce which improved it greatly.  I suspect making the hamburger with taco seasoning would make it even better.

The original recipe is a good "base" but very bland.  Put a little life into it with some diced tomatoes (2 - 15 oz.), boullion (3 cubes in 3 c. water), corn, marjoram, thyme, and bay leaf to taste.  Note:  Hold the salt--the boullion has plenty!

Very good.  Definitely add the extra can of beef broth or it is more like stew.  I also added some chopped cabbage and onions instead of the celery.  The worsteshire and a little hot sauce made it perfect.  My husband loved it.  HINT:  If you boil the potatoes in broth while the meat is browning it cooks much faster in the slow cooker.

I found this recipe to be very good. I added a half jar of speggetti sauce to the mix and seasoned the ground beef with italion seasoning while it browned. I also used green beans as the canned vegy. I definately wil be revisiting this recipe!!

I read a lot of the reviews, this soup was good and the family enjoyed it, I added 2 cans tomato soup, 3 C. water, 3 tsp. beef boullion, bay leaf, thyme, oregano, cooked it on Med. heat 5 hrs. It still could have used more spices. My young family liked it, but there were no rave reviews. I will try it again with more spices. We ate it with Vickie's Beer Bread - and that was great!!

This is a great recipe!  I fixed this for my family last night in just minutes and they loved it.  I didn't do it in the slow cooker but just in a stock pot.  I added a little garlic and basil and my husband commented again this morning about how great it was!

Really good stuff here. I used baby carrots and a little bit of worchestire sauce and added frozen corn and peas. 
Really good and really easy. Perfect for a week night or cold winter day.

Great recipe!   My family loved it!! I too took the advice of the previous reviews by adding the extra tomato soup, boullion, corn, ect.  I had to add a can of beef broth because I thought the soup was too thick.  This is a definate make again recipe!!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I followed others advice and put in a can of stewed tomatoes and 2-3 cans of water.  Also added worcestershire, tabasco, 3 beef boullion cubes, green peppers and extra black pepper to spice it up a bit.  Used 3 large potatoes and also used peas and thought it was great!

great recipe! I took others advice and added extra's. Another can of tomato soup, can of diced tomatoes (undrained) and 2 soup cans of water. Also added to taste: worcestershire sauce, frozen corn (instead of the pea's), tabasco, oregano, majoram and thyme. I used a lift out crock, crock pot so I added an extra half hour to the cooking time. (by the way, the Garden Herb Loaf from this site goes quite well with this soup!)

This was a great, easy recipe.  My stepdaughter was here several days after I made this, and her dad gave her some leftovers for lunch, she thought it was great!
I was out of celery, but I had a leek to use up.  It was really great with the leek.
The only drawback was having to pre-cook the ground beef.  I like "one dish" meals when I am slow-cooking.  It is necessary though, and worth it.

Yummy! I didn't have tomato paste/soup, so I used left-over spagetti sauce. WOW! It was good. I used frozen corn instead of peas, added some onion powder and garlic powder, a bit of celery salt...gonna have this again and again.

This was good but nothing special.  I used canned corn and beans instead of peas because that's what I had.  I mixed my tomato soup with milk and then used beef broth instead of water.  Added some basil, oregano, and  garlic powder but it was still fairly bland.  My husband put hot sauce in his and liked it that way.

This soup is really good but adjustments are needed. We added beef base, diced tomatoes, and a few green beans. I omitted the tomato soup since I was after a beef based soup.

I give this 3 stars because I made so many changes. I used a can of tomato juice instead of thesoup and added MUCH more ground beef. I also added extra veggies, extra potatoes and some okra. VERY good and will warm you up on a cold day.

I doubled this recipe and there was nothing left at the end of the meal.  I used beef broth instead of water and corn instead of peas - I HATE peas.  I also added some garlic for pizzaz.  It was soupy at first when my boys ate it.  Later in the evening when my husband and I sat down to dinner it was more like stew.  Delicious either way.

Followed others' advice and added more broth/water and spices. I only used one onion, but there was still way too much onion in it. I probably won't try it again.

Excellent and easy recipe! I thought it was a bit bland so I added a little A1 and a shot of hot sauce.  I also substituted corn for the peas which added a nice sweetness.

Wouldn't bother to make this in my crockpot if I had to use a large pot to brown the beef. Would just add other ingredients and be done in less than an hour.

This looks more like a stew than a soup.  I make this kind of soup much easier.  I use canned puree tomatoes, olive oil, 1 onion and garlic diced , thyme, parsley, garlic powder, chicken broth, penne pasta, half a bag of mixed veggies, premade frozen meatballs, salt, pepper and sugar.  I pour 2 Tbsp of olive oil in a dutch oven, saute the diced onion and garlic, thyme and add canned tomatoes some water and simmer for a few, add sugar, then broth.  Bring it all to a boil then add remaining ingredients, simmer for 10-15 minutes until pasta is done and meatballs are heated through

3 1/2 so I rounded up. It would be five stars with the changes I made. With the changes, I loved it and so did my husband. I added a diced yellow bell pepper just to get rid of it,  can of diced tomatoes, and two beef boulion to the water before mixing it with the tomato sauce. In between layers of veggies, I added generous amounts of seasoning: Salt, pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, sweet basil, thyme, and seasoned salt. This is a good base recipe, just ad more seasonings and it is great.

i liked this recipe because although it was simple, it left lots of room for individual add-ins/outs making it very easy to personalize to your family's tastes, i found the review by Cindy Wait very rude, it told you nothing about why you did not like the recipe or what could make it better, it was very immature, Cindy Wait grow up!

My family really liked this soup. I don't like cooked peas so I left it out. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup. I added 2 T. chicken bullion and 1 T. soy sauce. It tastes even better the 2nd day. Thanks for the recipe.

Maybe if I added potatoes it would be like shepard's pie.

I ran out of tomato soup and improvised with a beef bouillon base instead. If I had baked mashed potatoes as a top layer this would have been the best shepherds pie ever! As it is was great though, two thumbs up from the whole family.

I thought this was really good.  I added two cans of tomato soup, 1/2 can of water and 1 can of beef broth.  Once it was all done, I poured it over rice to make it more of a casserole consistancy.  Also used frozen corn instead of peas.  Oh, I also used taco seasoning when browning the meat.  I cooked it on low for 11 hours and the potatoes were still not done, but they were close.  I cubed them, but next time I will even make them smaller.  Very good.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this soup just as the recipe called for and my husband and I both thought it was very good.  I had company from out of town the day I made it and they thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will definitely make it again, in fact, I am making it for a soup and sandwich supper for our Lenten supper next week.

This was a hit with my family!  And perfect for our busy schedules.  Kept nicely in the pot for quite a long time, and made enough leftovers for my family of 4 for a second meal.I would agree with some of the other reviewers though.  Add 2 cans of tomato soup and double the water, then add a few more spices to give it some zip.  And definately use corn instead of peas!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I too thought it was bland- thanks for the tip on using hot sauce.  I did put corn in it. A great soup and good for you.

Very very bland for our family’s taste buds. We’re used to soups being very flavorful and full bodied. However, upon making it adding in all the ingredients, plus my own spices, my kids walking past said how great it smelled and they couldn’t wait to try it!  I used leftover taco meat plus added more ground beef. We like more meat in our soups. I didn’t leave out the peas and they were very tasty in this soup. I did add beef bouillon and more water than it called for.  All my veggies were as stated but fresh in the recipe plus a few potatoes. I also didn’t add tomatoes. Just our preference. Made in this in my instant pot and it took longer to cut up all the fresh veggies than it did to cook. Def will make again when weather becomes more brisk. Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't sure about this combination but followed the recipe (except used ground turkey) and it turned out very yummy!  The family agrees this is a "keep" recipe!

Instead of Condensed tomato soup I used Progresso Tomato soup with Basil and added only a 1/2 can water. Very good, my hubby liked it very much.

I liked it, but it wasn't as big of a hit with my family as i thought it would be. It was very filling. Another thing I like about it is that I had everything on hand so it is good to make in a pinch, and you can easily substitute a few things :)

I added extra spices: fresh basil, celery salt, 2 bouillon cubes. When I cooked the meat I added ground nutmeg. I would suggest a few more potatoes and more water. I also added a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. When serving I put fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top.

This is definitely a hearty soup, I added elbow macaroni instead of the potatoes just to switch it up a bit. I added some Italian Seasonings as well.

This soup I made on the stove top, not in the crock pot,  that is the only change I  made. Nothing like the smell of soup cooking on the stove and it worked out just fine. I did exactly what the recipe said, the only different was that I added a bit more water for more broth and let it cook on the stove top for about an hour, delicious taste.

This turned out great!  I used frozen mixed veggies instead of the carrots, celery, and canned peas.  I also had to make a substitution because I had a can of tomato sauce in the cupboard, but no tomato soup.  Found an easy recipe online on how to make the conversion.  Basically added sugar, salt, and corn starch to the tomato sauce.  I also added a dash of garlic powder.  I would definitely make this again!

I do not recommend this as it breaks up from stirring into an unappetizing kind of mush. It still tasted pretty good if you can get past the look.

I made this soup and followed the  reciepe and did not make any changes to the ingredients. Was very bland and not enough liquid to really call it a soup. My family said it was ok and if I do make it again there will be plenty of changes to be made.

Delish.  I made  this stove top basically  following the recipe.  Except I added  spices, marjoram and Sunny Spain Seasoning, and I used left over meatloaf  adding it after the vegetables were cooked.  Also sautéed mushrooms and onions together and added them with the meatloaf.

Excellent, filling, and while it made a huge pot for just the two of us, it kept well in the fridge for a later meal and reheated nicely.

Exchanged water for beef broth, used frozen green beans rather than peas, added some basil, bay leaf, thyme, oregano and I sauteed minced garlic with onion and hamburger. Also used diced tomatoes. Next time I will not slice the potatoes so thin; they got mushy after re-heating. But definitely this is be added to the rotation. Easy and nutritious!

I made exactly as the recipe depicted and it was delicious, I used regular ground beef as it is full of flavour and drained off the fat.  I tried to make burgers and meatballs with lean and extra lean and they do not taste very good at all.

This was just great. I added 8oz of tomato sauce to the recipe and everyone loved it. One of the keys here is to use lean meat and drain off any excess juice before mixing beef with rest of soup. This recipe will remain near the top of my recipes for future use. From Ruby’s Kitchen.

A little too thick for my liking. My mother made us a hamburger soup for us as kids and it was better. This was like a STEW not soup.

I will make again but definitely add 2 to 3 cans of tomato soup and increase the water.  It was just too thick and consistency not that of a soup.  Nice flavor and easy but definitely would make thinner.

I don’t eat much meat and would never have thought to try a Hamburger soup recipe for my husband until I came across this one! I had all the ingredients needed for this soup recipe in my root cellar of canned goods from my garden or the freezer. I followed the recipe exactly as written except: I used fresh canned stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato soup. I used canned bone broth instead of the water. I used canned carrots, frozen corn and peas. Added onion and some garlic, both from my garden and in the root cellar...The crockpot soup/stew smelled amazing and it was full of my summer garden bounty...Thank you so much for this recipe, Cindy.

This is like many other slow cooker soups that I already make.  But let me suggest something that a cook that I once worked with at a high class dining room used to enhance all soups and stews he cooked. Add balanced amounts of salt' crushed red pepper flakes for heat; sweet from veggies like carrots, celery, onions or sugar; and acid from vinegar or lemon.  Don't forget to go easy on these because you are only after balance and background flavor.  It works every time.   Also, if you are putting tomatoes in your soup you are already getting some acid.  Have a light touch.

I use frozen veggies, but add green beans along with the other veggies. I DO NOT use tomatoes in it. I like beef stock, and add broth powder.   instead of leaving it as a soup, I make a stew with it, and to thicken, I use corn starch.

I've made this twice, but to each layer I added onion powder, garlic powder and a little extra celtic salt.
While we liked it the first time with the tomato soup, I decided to change it up a bit and used cream of mushroom soup instead. It was superb!!!!!

Great recipe!  Thank you!   TIP:  Whenever I have leftover veggies from a meal and there are too few to use for another meal,  I throw them in a container I keep in the freezer.  Corn, green beans, whatever.   These come in handy when making a soup like this or for other soups and casseroles!

I followed the recipe this time but found that it needed more liquid. I will probably use beef broth instead of water and then add a bay leaf next time.  My husband said to try it again.

The flavor of this is great!! However, it was very low on liquid. It ended up being more like a stew with very little liquid. Still entirely delicious! Next time, I'll likely use a 32oz of broth.

I didn't have time for the slow cooker, so I made it stove top in a kettle. I started with the onion, then added potatoes to allow for the most cooking time. I browned the ground beef before adding, and substituted spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. It was ready in under an hour.  Served with a little cheese on top, and drop biscuits on the side- yummy!

Great dinner recipe and very easy. Instead of condensed tomato soup I used a can of crushed tomatoes and blended it in a blender. I added basil and fresh garlic for more flavor. When cooking the hamburger add onion. Delicious

I followed this recipe and added a whole bunch of stuff.  I took the advice of a reviewer and added a can of diced tomatoes,3 cups of beef broth instead of water, oregano plus basil cooked with the beef, 3 tbs of chopped garlic, and 1 package of onion soup mix.  I cooked it for 8 hours, I suggest if you cut the veggies really thin like specified, cook it for 6 or 7 hours, mine were definitely on the mushy side; otherwise then that, a good little guide line of a recipe.

The only thing I did differently with this recipe was added seasonings. Based on other reviews, I figured some extra seasoning wouldn't hurt. I added extra garlic salt, onion powder, oregano, and a bay leaf. This recipe isn't anything that would knock your socks off, but it is very filling, and tastes pretty good.

I didnt make this recipe to a T, but based on my modifications, it is a 5 star recipe and definately a keeper in my recipe box.
I added any veggies I had in my garden... green beans, zuchinni, peas.  I also added a can of corn and a can of tomatoes.  I also added a can of cream of celery soup and a dash or two of worsteshire sauce.  Then to spice it up I added basil, oregano and garlic.  The soup was delicious!

Wonderful!  My family loves eating this with some jiffy corn muffins.  I do vary the recipe with corn instead of peas and also two cans of tomato soup and water.  It just makes it more soupy instead of stewy.

My husband and I both work this was a quick and easy recipe.  I had no celery but it was wonderful.  I will be recommending this to others.

One of the easiest, balanced meals you could make for a hungry family with little time at the dinner table.
