You had me at "tomato" and "rosemary".  I made this as written and will make often as it is easy to prepare.  I may cut back on the oil next time to make it lower still in fat than it already is.  Thank you for this!

We had this tonight with a grilled pork tenderloin. As I didn't have any heirloom tomatoes I made it with red and yellow tomatoes on the vine which I had on hand. When I made the dressing I feared it might be to oily. But to my surprise it wasn't. We usually use onions in a tomato salad. So I was wandering what's comingout without onions. The result was great. It's a great salad on a hot day together with some grilled meat.

This one gets the gold star award and that’s a hard rating to come by.  It means my husband has been "WOWED!”  He can eat the entire bowl like it was candy and then ask for more.  I’m surprised because he doesn’t like rosemary, yet it seems to compliment this dish very well.  I used the following Heirloom varieties:  Cherokee Purple, Amana Orange, and Tigerella. Thank You aimeej.B for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This is wonderful! I used a 1:1 ratio of oil to vinegar to cut down the amount of fat and adjust for the amount of tomatoes I used. I also omitted the oregano because we do not care for it. Will make this beautifully colored salad again!

Deeeelicious!!  Did everything as written, however, because we are such Rosemary "freaks" added another two sprigs.  They were the first bowl cleared at the dinner table! Thank you for a simple, lovely recipe! Look forward to trying them on the grill!

Absolutely delicious! Served cold and topped with crumbled feta cheese. Loved it so much, I made it again the next day. Can't wait to have it for lunch with cottage cheese!

Very tasty!  I will use less olive oil to cut the calories when I make it again.  Also, I made a couple of other tomato salad recipes this summer, and learned that the letting the salad sit for a couple of hours allows the tomatoes to marinate in the sauce and absorb the flavors.  We served this when we had friends over for dinner and our guests went back for seconds.  Very tasty!

I loved this recipe. Unfortunately, I did not have rice vinegar so I used white vinegar and it came out very good. The sweetness of the ripe heirloom tomatoes was so nicely mixed with the rosemary. It was so fast and so good. Will make it again!

I have not tried this with RICE WINE vinegar yet. However it is great with red wine vinegar. Sometimes I add in 1t. to 2t.  of balsamic. I also like it with small mozzerella balls & fresh torn basil.  IF there are any left overs, remove mozzerella , then pulse briefly  to make a fresh salad dressing. During the winter months , when fresh tomatoes are all hot house grown, I find that grape tomatoes are  a good substitute.

I had to add 1 tbls white balsamic
and 1 tbs red wine vinegar
touch of thyme sea salt to give it a little zing.  I did add thinly sliced red onion.  For leftover tomato salad, I added arugula the second day and it was great!

Very tasty!  I didn’t have fresh rosemary so I used 2 tsp of dried, crushed rosemary. I may have put in too much salt, but I’ll know for next time! A little goes a long way!

The color and texture was a home run, but the flavor fell short and was "one dimensional" for a mild way to criticize  without completely bashing the recipe. I will make it again, but add some red onion and maybe a little cucumber to add a little more zing to it.

This is wonderful.  Well balanced and really highlights the wonderful flavor of heirloom tomatoes.  This is going to be a regular for tomato season.

Light and refreshing. Tasted and took a pic, and then tossed in some fresh mozzarella that I had in the fridge that needed to be used up. Tasty!

A quick, tastey and healthy side dish! I was looking for something to do with all my Juliet tomatoes (grape-like, but the taste is like a regular size tomato). I split 12 oz. of these in half and tossed with the dressing in amounts listed and it was just a bit too much dressing... but I could add these to a lettuce salad and wouldn't need additional dressing! Thanks!

This was good! Maybe not 5 stars. I think having fresh tomatoes from the garden is what made it so delicious. I will probably make again.

A really good salad that can be used as a topper for many things.  The second time I made it and added chopped yellow pepper and onion.  Both ways are great.

I made this and it was delicious but I made 2 changes. I used less olive oil and More rice vinegar. Also, remember to chop the rosemary real fine and give it a little time to marinade.

Quick, easy, lite refreshing salad to use up some of the tomatoes in the garden. We have rosemary growing too which enticed me even more to make this. Something seemed missing hence the 4 stars but it was very good. May try red wine vinegar or balsamic next time. I like the flavors of the rosemary with the sweetness of the heirloom tomatoes. A nice variation then the classic tomato & basil.

I only wish heirloom tomatoes weren't so expensive, because I want this all the time! I used avocado oil instead of olive oil just because, and ended up drinking the leftover liquid in my bowl AND my husband's! I also put a few toasted pine nuts on for a garnish,  though I can't say they enhanced or detracted from the flavor. 

I highly recommend!

Delicious!!! Hubby loved it too. I Used dried rosemary because I didn't have any fresh but I'm sure it would be even better with fresh.  Instead of rice vinegar, I used Sicilian Lemon White Balsamic Vinegar but any good quality white balsamic would be good.  I just used regular vine tomatoes quartered.

Quite nice. I found I wanted a stronger flavor to the dressing so next time I'll increase reg & rosemary. 
 I did this with 2 tomatoes a cup of chickpeas, red onions and some arugula.Tasted better this am, so I'll also do well in advance next time.
