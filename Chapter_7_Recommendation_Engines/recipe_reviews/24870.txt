EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT! We grow mini carrots and I have always looked for a good 
carrot salad for those hot summer days. Very tasty and eye  appealing.

This is a great carry in dish for pot lucks.  Not only can you make it a few days prior to the carry-in, everybody loves it and wants the resipe. Plus, you don't have to worry about duplicate dishes!

This salad is the best.  I left out the celery and have often used a regular onion instead of green onions (which my local grocery store never has in stock!).  Yummy Yummy!

I love this recipe! The first time I had it I was probably 10 years old.  A friend of my parent's had us over for dinner and this is the only thing I actually remember having that night.  My mom got the recipe from her that night and we've had it ever since.  Her recipe didn't have celery in it but I'm sure it's just as good.  The only thing I wanted to add here is that when I make it I use 2 tablespoons of oil instead of 1/4 cup (you could probably omit it completely).  Splenda works well in place of the sugar and I only use half a green bell pepper. You could even use more carrots, this makes a lot of juice for two pounds of carrots.

I wasn't too sure about this recipe, but had a bunch of carrots that needed using up. I was really surprised how good it was! I used olive oil, a sweet/spicy mustard, and added a little more onion. Really tasty. Thanks, Dawn!

This is a very tasty salad. Instead of green onion, I used thinly sliced onion rings (sweet onions like Vidalia). And I left out the celery.

Just like what Mom used to make when I was a kid.  It is always better the next day or two after the flavors meld.  Awesome sour addition to meal.

I found this recipe to be quite tangy due to the amount of vinegar.  My children did not like it at all. When presenting it wasn't very eye appealing.

A great shortcut to this recipe, which I just made for the 4th is to use  Catalina dressing.

Delicious.  I cook the carrots only 2 minutes, so they are tender/crisp.  Sliced radishes are also good in this.  I substitute an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce for the soup.  The marinade makes a great salad dressing, too.

This is standard fare at our house. I don't put celery in it but no reason to eliminate it except for personal preference.  An 8 oz. can of tomato sauce works for a can of tomato soup substitution.  I only use 1/4 cup of sugar and make up the difference with Splenda, otherwise I make it as presented here.  We love this recipe.

Pretty good. Sauce is almost same recipe I use to make French dressing. Think I will try that next time,,, only difference is adding 3 cloves of garlic and letting it sit for a day or two before you need it as this really brings out the flavour

Although this was easy, and I thought the taste was pretty good, no one else did bc apparently they were either "too sweet" or "missing something."  Either way I guess I'm not going to bother with these again only bc the family gave it a thumbs down.

I did not make any changes, it is delicious. I would certainly make it again. I took to my church pot luck and they loved it.

I made this recipe exactly as is, except I didn't have a green pepper on hand. However, I don't that would have helped much. I was very excited about this recipe because I had both carrots and celery that needed to be used up, but it was awful. My partner and I couldn't eat it. The carrots needed to be cooked much longer, and the tanginess was incredibly unappetizing.

Made a very similar recipe at least twice a summer and it is delicious! Our family calls it Zippy Carrots. Our recipe just doesn't use celery.

I make this with whole baby carrots, and slice the green pepper and onions instead of chopping.  Great accompaniment to BBQ

I have made a version of this recipe for decades.  This time I was needing to use up uncooked 'baby' carrots.  I just cooked the babies, used sweetener instead of sugar, used a TBS of prepared mustard and no vinegar.  Best you ever made according to hubby.

Eh, this didn't do it for us, sorry. one person liked it, but everyone else left it on the plate after one taste.
