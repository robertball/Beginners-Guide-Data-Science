This  recipe was great although I did leave out the brandy.  My husband and I loved it with the bread.  We also used carrot sticks, celery sticks, and apple slices.

Great basic fondue recipe.  I agree with the previous review suggesting grating the cheese - this greatly cuts down on melting time.  Dredging the cheese in flour ensures a smooth consistency - don't skip this step!  (I used white flour with good results.)  The recipe got many compliments when I served it at a party; I'll definitely make it again.

Good fondue base however, a great fondue should ALWAYS have a minimum of 2 different cheeses. Lower the portion of swiss cheese and compensate with gruyere or emmental (my favorite), or any kind of firm cheese that suits your taste. Also, in addition to bread you can use crispy veggies or cold meats, like ham cubes. A good quality blond beer can also be used instead of the wine if you are a beer enthousiast. If you have never tried fondue before, stick to the wine.

This was SO easy to make. It was the first time I ever tried making fondue and it was great. The recipe has "Brandy" in the ingredients, and then "Kirsch" in the instructions so I wasn't sure which to use. I went with regular old Brandy and it was delicious. I wanted to try and counter all the fat from the cheese with some vegetables so along with dipping bread, I steamed some brussel sprouts and dipped those in as well. YUMM!

This is a decent recipe.  I agree with others when they say use two different types of cheese.  I also add 2-3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and substitute corn starch for potato flour.  (I dissolve the starch in the lemon juice; it's the key to smooth fondue.)  I also agree with other reviewers that shredded cheese is the way to go.  Make your life easier, use shredded cheese!  I promise it's worth the effort!

This is a really fool-proof fondue recipe!  I used a bit of Gueyere cheese.  Many raves.

Followed recipe to the letter. Did not work well, cheese would have melted better if grated.

Very delicious, however, I did leave out the nutmeg and the brandy. Thanks Marc!

Good basic fondue recipe. I skipped the Kirsch and the nutmeg just because I was going for a quick lunch and didn't want to bother taking the time. Used Comte cheese (French Gruyere) and it was very nice.

This is the real fondue, which I have been making for over 30 years. Shredded Swiss makes it easier to blend into the hot wine, the flour helps to thicken, and by all means rub the pot with a garlic clove first. The nutmeg and Kirsch are the finishing touches. Glad to see this clear basic recipe here!

This foudue was good but not great. I did not use the brandy and the foudue was very thick so I added some milk to loosen it.

Good recipe. I halved the wine, since I don't like wine. Still had a very strong taste of wine.

Like others, I shredded the cheese.  I also messed around with different combinations of cheeses.  This is a very good base for a delicious fondue, just don't be afraid to change it a little to suit your tastes!

This recipe is great. I did leave out the brandy and I grated the cheese which made the melting time faster.
