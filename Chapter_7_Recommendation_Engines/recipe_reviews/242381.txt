This recipe is delicious!!! My family said these were the best ribs ever!!! Better than the ones we have had in fancy restaurants!!!...
I don't have a smoker at home but I love the smoke flavor on meats so I decided to bake the ribs in the oven at low temperature,250 degrees F, for two hours.So to get some smoke flavor this is what I did: I placed a little ramekin on one of the corners of my baking tray and added 4 tablespoons of liquid smoke with hickory flavor and 2 tablespoons of water. I put the ribs on top of a drying rack as Kim's cooking Now! suggests in one of her reviews and wrapped the tray with heavy duty foil without leaving any leaks so the liquids would stem and flavor the meat. Sprayed the ribs only twice with apple juice. After two hours in the oven I wrapped them on foil and drizzled them with the maple syrup and butter but also drizzled them with some of the left over smoking flavor I used first to bake them then I sparkled the sugar. I left them in the oven for 1 1/2 hours then I basted them and put them on the grill. I turned them twice.
For the rub I just used half of the salt that the recipe calls for and it was a good decision because otherwise it would have turned out to salty. I made a mistake making the sauce and added some maple syrup to it, nobody noticed!!! The BBQ sauce was out of this world, I'm glad I had leftovers!!! I only used one teaspoon of chili powder and added an extra teaspoon of chipotle powder. Would I use this recipe again? Yes!!!

I pressure cooked the raw ribs for 20 mins, took them out places them in a pan and added the dry rub and let that marinate the meat while I prepared the glaze. Dipped each rib in the glaze and set aside any left over glaze for the final touches. Then I smoked these ribs with a mesquite smoke for 3 hours at 270. Once done , added the  final glaze over the ribs and served. Heaven!!!
This recipe did not call for smoking but it adds just that extra little something. After the ribs are pressured cooked and smoked they fall right off the bone.

One of the best rib recipes that I've ever made, however it is way too salty.   I recommend cutting the salt on the rub in half.   Otherwise very good.   The sauce is excellent as written.    This will be a regular around here from now on.   Thank you.

Ohmygoodness.  OH MY GOODNESS.  These are PHENOMENAL!!!  Definitely some of the best ribs I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  I served them for a Father's Day celebration and they were absolutely devoured!  Don't be intimidated by the steps or the number of ingredients at all- they're just SO GOOD!  Definitely a keeper.  I double the rub but the rest of the ingredients were perfect as-is.  I left out the coriander (accidentally) and didn't miss it.  I also used apple cider vinegar rather than white vinegar in the sauce.  AMAZING!!!
