NOM!

I had to increase the buttermilk to an extra 1/4 c. as the pancake batter was too thick. I added cinnamon and nutmeg
and vanilla flavoring. I also changed the baking soda to powder and bumped it up to 1 1/2 tsp. which made for a fluffier pancake. These cooked up really nicely and were a good compliment to the sauteed apples and sausage. 

This one's a keeper.

These are great pancakes!  Was looking for an easy recipe because I needed to go shopping and was out of milk, and buttermilk.  I used plain yogurt and did add some vanilla too.  They turned out great!  A nice hearty pancake.  Be sure to cook on a lower heat as others have stated.  Will definately make again and again! **Update 3/05/09: These are the only pancakes my fam requests.  I have made them with whatever I have on hand - buttermilk, milk with vinegar or lemon juice, and plain yogurt.  All work basically the same.  I have subbed the quick oats with slightly ground rolled oats.  I usually add 1 tsp vanilla since my family prefers sweeter pancakes.  I have also added blueberries (my fav) and choc chips (fam fav).  You really can't go wrong!  These are pretty much the only pancakes I make now.  Lower heat on the grill is critical though!

My family and I loved these pancakes!  I did make three changes to the recipe. I used the blender for the oatmeal before I mixed them in the batter, I used half and half instead of buttermilk, and I added cinnamon.  The kids hardly knew they were "healthy" pancakes!

These were excellent! Tasted almost like a muffin. The recipe was quick and easy.  I had a little trouble with the pancakes burning before they were cooked all the way though - so cook on a low heat.

Wonderful recipe! These were very hearty and delicious for breakfast.  I ground the oats and added a Tbsp. of vanilla, a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  Great with real maple syrup!

I followed the recipe with one exception, I added cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves to taste.  I topped this with apple butter and a dollop of vanilla yogurt and it was wonderful!  My four young children all loved these.

These are the best "healthy" pancakes I have made or even had!  Yum!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I put a squirt of lemon juice in the milk and let it sit for a few minutes before adding it to the mix.  I also used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup white.  I will try it with all whole wheat next time.

The only thing i would do differently is cook the oatmeal on the stove first and then add it to the pancake recipe. By cooking it first the pancakes stay moist rather then the oatmeal soaking up all of the liquid. This is a healthy altern. to regular pancakes. I doubled the recipe to feed 3 adults.

This is a good hardy pancake.  I had to add a little more buttermilk to the batter to thin it out some.  I've also played with it a little by using all ww flour and egg whites.  Either way they are yummy!

These were phenomenal. I made them for our Christmas breakfast and they were a hit. They are quite sweet - we found that they were perfect as is, without any syrup. Next time I might reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. However they were so delightful that I might not! I did reduce the size of the pancakes by using 1/4 cup batter for each one, and that was perfect. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Wow! So delicious!! I doubled the recipe & used 4 pkgs of instant brown sugar oats(trying to use up, hence searching out this recipe:) I did NOT reduce the brown sugar in the recipe but did add about 1/4 more milk(regular). Turned my skillet down to somewhere between 300 & 325 and spread the batter out after ladling it in the pan. These are UNBELIEVABLY good! Didn't use a drop of syrup as the brown sugar in the instant oats added plenty of sweetness. Incredible! Just can't stop raving!!

Very quick and easy to make. I added 1 mashed banana to the mix and boy were they good.  I didn't even put syrup on mine. I will never go back to boxed pancakes again.

We liked these! I added a little vanilla to my wet ingredients. They had a lovely taste. The texture was more or less on par with any other oatmeal pancake, but this recipe has sufficient buttermilk to keep the pancakes from being too dry. I might add a touch more buttermilk in the future, though, just to keep the batter nice and loose. Thanks for the recipe!

I added approx 1 tsp of baking powder to this mix to help give some fluff.  I really didn't care for these.  They were heavy and thick and had really no flavor.  All I really tasted was the whole wheat flour.  If I ever try them again for the hubby to try, I will use all white flour.  Some cinnamon would be good.

I was looking for a healthy, filling breakfast to serve my daughter and her friend before cheer camp.  I am so glad I found this recipe; the girls kept commenting on how much they liked the pancakes!  My daughter requested them again this morning, too!  My tweaks:  Dark brown sugar; 1t vanilla

I followed the exact recipe minus the buttermilk because I didn't have any on hand (substituted skim milk + 1 T. white vinegar).  I was not a fan.  The flavor was alright but the oats made the batter and cakes to thick.  I guess I'm a fan of thin cakes.  I won't make again.

Not bad. Lots of texture and very hearty. A little on the dry side and crumbly, was the only problem I found with these. Made as written, this recipe only makes 7 pancakes, so double it for sure. I had to make a second batch to have enough for 2 adults and 2 kids.

These are a real nice change from the normal. I really liked these pancakes. I had my griddle on 300* they took abit longer to cook but they were a nice golden color and done all the way through.

These are very good.  My family requested pancakes this morning, and I decided to give this a try for a change.  I didn't have quick cooking oats and was afraid my thick-cut old fashioned oats would not cook sufficiently, so I subbed a couple packets of Quaker Simple Harvest Maple Pecan instant cereal for the oatmeal and left out the brown sugar.  I also used spelt flour instead of ww.  Based on other reviews, I also added baking powder, and I'm glad I did.  The pancakes turned out very light and fluffy.  I didn't have enought buttermilk, so I added whole milk to make up the difference.  And I always add vanilla to everything sweet.  As you can tell, I cook on the fly a lot, but this recipe is very forgiving.  Even though I didn't measure some of the ingredients (I was looking for a specific consistency to the batter--I like it just a bit on the thin side), the pancakes turned out wonderfully.  I'll be making these regularly.

These were very good.  LET THE BATTER SIT OVER NIGHT.  That way the oats are soft.  I just did not ad any salt.  They are so tasty that it is good without syrup.  Next time I would add a dash of cinnamon.  Thanks for the formula.

I really liked these pancakes but my husband didn't care for the oatmeal in them.  I added some cinnamon, vanilla and used a packet of cinnamon spice flavored instant oatmeal in place of some of the quick cooking oatmeal.  I didn't have whole wheat flour so I used regular flour nor did I have buttermilk so I did the milk/vinegar combo.  Yum!

Best pancakes ever! I did some just as the recipe suggests. I did another batch and added a little bit of pumpkin puree, some pumpkin pie spice and vanilla...they were so good no syrup was required! I also made another batch and added in applesauce, cinnamon, vanilla and all spice, and finally I made another batch with mashed banana and blueberries. They were all sooooo good. I have found my new permanent pancake recipe, never will I make pancakes from a box again!

I made these since the kids love maple and brown sugar oatmeal.  These freeze very well and are easy to pop into the toaster or microwave on a school morning.

Our new favourite pancakes. I used all whole-wheat flour instead of half and they turned out just great. Hardly needed any syrup. A new weekend regular.

Great flavor and healthier too.  A nice change from the traditional buttermilk pancakes.    Definitely one of the best pancake recipes I have found.

the pancake itself tastes really good.. however, i kept burning them, and the middles were still uncook! i think the oatmeal should be cooked first before adding to the batter. also, use low heat to fry them. to make it more healthy ..serve them with fruit~

The whole family loved these pancakes.  I served these with the strawberry topping from this site and they were heavenly.  These are light, but hearty and tasty pancakes that we will continue to make and enjoy!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and ground the oats in the blender, then just put in all the other ingredients and blended them too.  The added oats make these pancakes a very hearty breakfast!  The batter was normal thickness and I got 6 pancakes out of it.  I added 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 t ginger and 1/8 t allspice.  I think the spices really enhanced these pancakes!  Next time I'll try adding more ginger.  I'm also going to try making them without grinding the oats as they weren't that noticeable ground up. Regardless, my husband and I really enjoyed these pancakes and we're both very particular when it comes to pancakes.

Nice recipe! I don't know if I was wrong back then, but the batter was very thick. So I added 6 more tbsp of milk (I'm not using buttermilk) and it turned out great. Thanks for this tasty recipe!

My word these are good pancakes.  Like another reviewer said "a muffin in pancake form".  A tad too sweet for me but I think that is just personal preference.  (I still ate 4 though!).  Very hearty - we all needed a glass of milk to wash them down.  I used milk/lemon juice in place of the buttermilk and used melted butter in place of the veg oil because I didn't have any.  Will be making these again for sure.

Delicious!  I thought they were sweet enough to skip the syrup and just add butter.  Kids had a honey syrup and ate them all.

I added a touch of cinnamon and vanilla (as suggested by other reviewers) as well as a bit of water to thin the batter and these were some of the best pancakes I have ever had. Definitely filling and even satisfying for the sweet tooth.

My kids loved them.  I was looking for a pancake recipe with Old Fashioned Oats and found a great one here.  I added a Tbl of vinegar to the milk and left it alone while I mixed the dry ingredients since I did not have buttermilk.  I also added a few sprinkles of cinnamon as someone else mentioned.  Will make again!!

pretty good recipe, although much better w/ added vanilla (2 tsp,) and cinnamon (1/2tsp.). i used 5 tbsp oats and 5 tbsp ground flax seed. i also only used 1/4 c brown sugar (i don't necessarily recommend, just trying to cut back on sugar) and it was great. i personally prefer it that way. thanks for sharing!
oh, this makes only 5 medium pancakes, but they are quite hearty.

I used rye instead of wheat, 2% Carnation plus vinegar, cinnamon, and about 7 tablespoons of oats and cooked on lower heat as suggested with butter/oil blend after letting the batter sit for about 10 minutes. If working with a flour that absorbs more moister (ex. Whole Foods AP) use a little less. I topped them with orange flavored honey. These are great because you can control the sweetness by the topping you pick. Great for a filling dinner.

My family loved these pancakes. Nice and hardy without being too dense. The only thing I did different was exchange the egg for 1/3c applesauce. Very good.

Modifications: I doubled it using all reg. flour, I blended the oatmeal 1st, 1% milk, added 4T. applesauce (some reviews said they were dry), added 1 C. thawed blueberries after making 1/2 the batter plain giving 2 choices depending on mood. I also cooked on my griddle at 325 as some reviews complained about burning - my modification made perfectly hearty pancakes for dinner. Most of my modifications were based on what I had on hand, besides trying to prevent the "issues" others reported with dryness/burning. Also I thought blueberries would add some fruity antioxidants

These are good.  I ate mine without syrup since they were already sweet enough.  

I don't think it makes 5 servings.  Just enough for a my family of 4 (two small children)  I'd double it next time.

I loved that these were so good and on the healthy side. I agree that they tasted like a muffin so I might try molasses with them next time. I added ground flax seed and a little water for my taste. Definitely a keeper!

These are nice and hearty pancakes. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1 Tbsp vinegar and added milk to equal 1 cup. Very quick and easy to prepare, and very tasty. They also freeze very well. Just let them sit out for about a half an hour and put in the toaster. Great with butter flavoured syrup.

I've tried other Oatmeal Pancake recipes from this site, and this is the best I've tried.  Quick, easy, tasty.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I just used regular milk and it was perfect.  Thanks!

These were great, I think you need to add a tsp of vanilla and some cinnamon though and then they not only taste great but they also make your whole house smell wonderful!

These are delicious!  My kids love them.  I did, like some others, grind the oats first for a smoother texture.  I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a couple tablespoons of wheat germ.

One of our favorites!  I've made these for awhile now & we love them!  The only change I make to the recipe is using a buttermilk substitute of vinegar & milk.  These are hearty, dense and chewy with a great sweetness.  They are perfect for the kids because I can serve them without syrup (not so messy) & they taste great!  We also like them with sugar-free preserves (blackberry is awesome) and not as sweet as syrup or regular preserves.  Delicious!  I think they'd be great baked with a handful of fresh blueberries thrown in too!

These are great!  Definitely cook on low heat, but a fairly healthy pancake that tastes awesome.  The only thing I did differently was add 1/2 tsp vanilla (which was more than enough), and it may have not needed it, will try without next time and I am sure they will be good that way, too. May try adding some berries next time as the kids love that.

Delicious and healthy! I also added some cinnamon and a little less brown sugar.  They are so moist and hearty.  My hubbie is usually the pancake maker with his own special recipe but he really loved this recipe too.  Yum!

We have five picky children and this pancake recipe is everyone's favorite. I run the oats through the food processor before mixing them in, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. I've also mixed up several batches of the dry ingredients first, and stored it in ziplock bags in the freezer. These are wonderful... and healthy!

Great recipe! I made a couple changes and it turned out fantastic. I used 1 mashed banana in place of the oil and I added raisins to the pancakes. They were delicious! I also used vanilla soymilk in place of the milk and egg substitute for the egg. They were gobbled up very quickly!

Wow, these are heavy.  Blended the oats, used all white flour, powder instead of soda, and upped the buttermilk by 1/3 cup.  Added cinnamon, nutmeg & vanilla.  I got a total of 17 small 'cakes out of the recipe.  As a whole, they were alright - but not something I'd do again.

These pancakes were WONDERFUL!  I made them on Friday then made them again on Saturday.  I plan on making them again this Saturday.  They are VERY filling.  I ate two and I felt pretty full but in a good way.  I loved the flavor that the brown sugar adds mixed with the oatmeal.  I could eat these without syrup and be happy.  Thanks for such an AWESOME recipe.  It is definately a keeper.

These pancakes are great. I made some slight modifications. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 3/4 cup of skim milk and 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt instead and I cooked them on at a lower temperature so they would cook through without burning on the outside. I served them with "Blueberry Breakfast Sauce" from this site and now my husband wants them every Saturday morning!

These were very good.  I have been looking for a healthier pancake recipe for my family, but others have tasted too much like tree bark.  This recipe is a touch of sweet with a little nutiness.  That may be because I added milled flaxseed and wheat germ (just a bit) with the oats.  I would much rather eat these on-the-go in the morning (so good by themselves) than a cereal bar!  My kids (6 adn 5 yrs) love them!

this was pretty good. i didn't have milk, so used half and half as another reviewer suggested. they came out pretty good, although it was hard to tell when cooked because they turn very darm brown. a few were undercooked and a few were burnt. but the ones that came out right were delicious.

I loved this recipe before gluten free- and still love it! I subbed gf AP flour and gf oats in just fine. I even used a little buckwheat flour in place of some of the AP flour. Turned out perfect! Oh and don't forget the xanthan gum- 3/4tsp per cup of flour in this recipe

These were purrfect; the fluffiest, most moist delicious pancakes I've found. Definitely my new go-to pancakes recipe. I didn't have buttermilk, so in its place I used reduced fat milk mixed up with light sour cream.  I added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Sharon! :)

Yum!  Of course made modifications for my own purposes but this recipe is a keeper.  For my all purpose flour I used a brown rice/spelt/barley mix.  For the buttermilk I used 1 tbsp vinegar and 1 cup less the tablespoon of unsweetened almond/coconut milk.  Also used old fashioned oats whole and they were fine.

Wow!! Awesome pancakes. My adult daughter and her two young sons LOVED them as did I but have to say my younger adult daughter did not. Just a taste preference. I didn't have buttermilk so I added 1 tbsp vinegar, also added 1 tsp cinnimon and 1 tsp vanilla. You really wouldn't need anything on them. Next time I am thinking a light fruit topping. I am going to turn this recipe into a cupcake by adding some pumpkin and then while hot adding cream cheese to the top to melt. This recipe will be in my family from here on out!!

these are good pancakes and really can hold their own without syrup. I added the cinnamon and vanilla as other suggested, cooked on low and even my 19 month old ate them.. Yah for mommy!! I also grinded the oats down before mixing them in.  They are a little dry but it won't stop me from making them again.

These pancakes are really good.  My kids loved them.  It does not make many (I doubled the recipe and got 20) and we all ate 2 or 3.  They freeze well also which makes for a quick breakfast.  I did make these with an egg sub because of an allergy and they worked out fine.  We will be having these often.

Made this for the first time this morning, and my three boys and husband loved it.  (i did too).  The only thing I changed was I put the oatmeal in the blender/next time I'd use the food processor to grind it up.  I tried this because a few of the reviews said the oatmeal sucked up all the liquid, and the batter was thick.  I didn't have any trouble with not enough liquid, the batter was the perfect consistency.  I agree with the reviewer who said to cook over low, they do take a little longer to cook through.

These are pretty good.  I soaked the oatmeal in equal parts milk for about 15 minutes before I added them to the recipe, and the pancakes were moist.  As other reviewers have said, these do burn really fast, so use low heat and keep a close eye on them!  My kids liked them too, so I'll  make them again as a more healthy pancake.  These aren't my very favorite, but for a healthier breakfast, they are a nice surprise.

For years I've refused to make anything but my unhealthy all white wheat pancakes. I figured since I'm an adult I ought to make some attempt to eating healthy, especially since my husband and I eat pancakes weekly! Not bad for something that has whole wheat flour in it! Followed the recipe exactly but i put it all in a blender to combine. I think next time I'll blend up the oatmeal by itself a bit as it was a little gritty. I don't think it makes 5 servings, closer to 3 or 4. I have a huge sweet tooth but I think they were a little too sweet for me once you add the syrup. I might cut that down a bit. 'Cause I think I might actually eat these again!

These were really good.  My family enjoyed them.  They are a very thick pancake so that is the only reason I gave them one less star.  I would like them to be a little more fluffier.

This recipe was kind of dense.  I'm not used to cooking with oats so maybe this is to be expected.  I think I'll go back to buttermilk pancakes.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe, and they came out flat and too tangy. I tried adding some sugar, a bit more flour, and some baking powder, but that only helped a little. I think I should have followed the other user's suggestion to blend the oats first to get the more powderized.

These were some of the best pancakes I've ever made.  Only thing I would recommend is that you cook them on medium low heat.  If you cook them too high the middle won't cook before they start to burn.

Not a flappy flapjack. Delicious, wholesome and hearty.  For all of the flour, I used whole wheat pastry flour. I did add a little vanilla and cinnimon and a 1/2 tsp baking powder.  The pancakes were not super sweet, but my kids did not ask for maple syrup. The texture is similar to a muffin.  Very yummy!

These are now our favorite weekend pancakes.  I just made some very subtle changes that are just our families preference.  This recipe is great as is.  We just added some cinnamon, one more egg, and some vanilla.  I also cut back on the brown sugar only because we use a sweet homemade syrup that we can't live without so there would be plenty of sweet going on.  With that said, these are not too sweet like others have suggested.  I really like that they are less floury tasting then most pancakes. For a fun variety, we added some blueberries and strawberries to some. Yum!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These pancakes were a huge hit again!  I made them this morning without buttermilk (didn't realize we were out) and added 1 tsp lemon juice.  They are yummy and fluffy and all my love them this way or the original way!

These were very good. I used a full cup of whole wheat flour and the egg whites only  of 2 eggs. Did not have any buttermilk on hand so I used milk with a squirt of lemon that I let sit for a little. Served with fresh strawberries, blueberries and bananas and a little bit of maple syrup! yummy :)

Great recipe. I love that they are thicker and firmer than regular pancakes, with just the right amount of sweetness to make them a grab-and-go type breakfast. I used milk+lemon instead of buttermilk and also added about a tsp of vanilla extract to the batter. This made 7 large pancakes for me. Edit: Adding a handful of dried fruit (I used a medly of cherries, cranberries, and blueberries) to the batter makes for a really nice little surprise in each bite.

I'm not usually into whole wheat pancakes. I only made them because I was nearly out of all purpose flour. So basically, even with a bias against this sort of pancake, I liked these. They were sweet enough, moist enough, and the texture was good -- not rough or grainy like many whole wheat recipes I've tried. I will probably even make them again after I've restocked my regular flour...sometimes. :=)

My family really enjoyed these pancakes.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added vanilla and cinnamon, plus I used fat free half and half because I didn't have any buttermilk.  These pancakes are VERY filling.  Two small pancakes for an adult, and one small pancake for a child is plenty!  I just served some fresh fruit and soy sausage with these pancakes and everyone in the family is stuffed.  : )  Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't give this 5 stars because I thought there was too much oatmeal. They were very thick almost like really over done oatmeal. I would cut the oatmeal in half and maybe add a tad more brown sugar otherwise it was a nice change. Very filling.

I loved the taste of the brown sugar.  But I'm not sure that I'd always want the texture of the oatmeal in my pancakes.  I used all white flour (I do not personally like whole wheat flour in pancakes) and I added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder in addition to the soda.  Spiced Strawberry Syrup (from this site) was tasty with these pancakes.

Loved these!  I find a lot of pancakes are kind of dry and not very flavorful.  These were great.  I used all white flour, because I don't generally have wheat flour on hand.  They were super filling.  I made two for my husband and he was stuffed.

these are the best healthy pancakes I've ever tried. I did add a little vanilla and cinnamon. I think pancakes should always have vanilla. I accidentally decreased the oats by 2 Tbls. I had to sub milk/vinegar for buttermilk too. All the other pancakes I've tried with whole wheat flour have been icky. These are great. thanks

Made this with whole grain oats & all-purpose flour as it was all I had. Also subbed milk with 1 tbsp vinegar for  buttermilk as recommended by others and used 1tbsp less sugar. It was yummy but... a little too sweet to eat with maple syrup. I would def. make it again, but with less sugar. For the whole oats, I boiled them in water for 5 mins to soften before mixing in with flour et al.

These were very good. Two things i did differently: added 2 tsp. of vanilla and used kefir instead of buttermilk. I added a bit more than 1 cup of kefir and next time, i might add a 1/4 cup more. But these very absolutely yummy!

Good, but they need cinnamon and vanilla to boost the flavor a little. Not as fluffy as I like my pancake to be. All fixable. A very quick recipe to whip up.

Delicious! These pancakes are going to be the only pancakes I make from now on! The entire family LOVED them! Even my husband, who raised his eyebrows when I told him I was making oatmeal pancakes, devoured them. I made a few slight changes-- used baking powder instead of baking soda, and added some cinnamon and vanilla. I think these would be great with chopped apple mixed in as well. Thanks for a great recipe!

Considering we were two college students who didn't have some of the ingredients and mis-read the recipe, they turned out pretty good. Used regular milk since we didn't have buttermilk and accidentally put in too little flour. They ended up coming out kind of muffin like and quite delicious. If I ever have all of the right ingredients, I'll be sure to try it again

My family and I really loved this recipe.  I love the texture the oatmeal gives to the pancakes and the brown sugar gives just the right amount of sweetness.  This recipe makes a small batch though.  I did double it and it made about 18 pancakes.

I am not usually a fan of pancakes, but my husband LOVES them.  I was a bit hesitant about trying a healthier version of his rare and beloved treat, but we were both thrilled by the outcome.  We agreed that this will be the only recipe I use from now on.  They are great exactly as the recipe dictates, but I like adding a little vanilla and cinnamon.

These are fantastic and extremely addictive! I followed the advice to blend the oatmeal, and these turned out great! Also, they do freeze well, although I like them the best when they are fresh off the griddle. (I reheated mine using the microwave; the oven seemed to dry them out too much.)

I have recipe for oatmeal waffles that I love and occasionally use to make pancakes.  The downfall is the amount of butter used.  This recipe tastes just like the waffles, without the added butter or having to drag out the waffle irons!  I added cinnamon, which is used in my waffle recipe and it added a great flavor.  I did not have problem with over cooking- that's simply a matter of adjusting your heat!!  Very good- thank you for sharing.

These were pretty good.  A little different than the usual buttermilk.  Sweet enough to go sans syrup I think. Maybe serve with some sliced bananas ? Nice recipe, worth a go.

These were really good!!  Everyone loved them.  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I have an egg allergy so I added 1/4 cup of applesauce and omitted the egg.  These were great and almosted tasted a bit like oatmeal muffins.  Will definitely make again and definitely healthier then the white flour only recipes.

My 3 year old loved these pancakes.  I was out of brown sugar and baking soda, so substituted sugar and baking powder.  I didn't have buttermilk, so used 1/2 and 1/2 as someone else suggested as well as put the oatmeal in the blender.  They will burn easily, so be careful!  I loved them too!

I loved this recipe. I'm trying to incorporate oatmeal into my breakfast routine, and I'll be using this again. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1 c 1% milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar. I also used 1 cup organic flour since I didn't have whole wheat.

These were fantastic! I'll be making these from now on. I used all whole wheat flour, and raw sugar instead of brown sugar. I also didn't have buttermilk, so I used another's suggestion and used milk and 1 tbs vinegar. Topped with pure maple syrup, they were delicious. My son loves them too (he's 1).

These pancakes are soo tasty.  The second time I made them I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and was able to "reuse" the 1/4 cup to measure out dried buttermilk and to pour out my batter onto my griddle.  I love not having to wash more dishes.

I first tried this recipe for our heart-shaped Valentine's Day pancakes, topped with strawberries. Delicious.
I made my own buttermilk (w/ either lemon juice or vinegar) and double the recipe.

Tried this again this morning and lo and behold, they are just as yummy when not in the shape of hearts! 

Thanks for the recipe. Wholesome and delicious.
