I thoroughly enjoyed this 'ice cream'. I threw everything together into my Vitamix not bothering to blend the frozen banana and coconut milk first. It worked out perfectly fine. I did place it in the freezer for about 15 minutes just for it to set. Thanks for the recipe!

It is good, but next time, I will use less cocoa powder.  It was a bit too chocolaty for me.

I followers the instructions and it had (emphasis on) way too chocolate flavor. It also has an extremely odd texture. Would not make again.
