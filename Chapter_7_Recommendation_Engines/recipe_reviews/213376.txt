grew up mighty poor, meat was scarce on our table. my dad used to take the peas, mash them up and put all the seasonings you would use to make sausage, sometimes including some red pepper flakes, added some flour i think, anyway made them into patties and fried them up in bacon grease, He called it pea sausage,,you would never guess it wasn't sausage. My dad has been gone many years, I still make them sometime

these were really good, I had some leftover black eyed peas that needed to get used up- they were dry beans, of course soaked and cooked.  I used my hand blender to mash them, but left some a partly unmashed.   I also roasted the red peppers myself.  Next time I make them I think I will add more flour, so they stick together better.  Also I think they need a little bit of sauce.  I will try a few out next time and see what I like best.

Tasty!  I used blackeyed peas with jalapenos which added just enough spice. My family loved them and say that the recipe is a keeper.  The texture is very soft and I would like to make it a bit firmer.

Good recipe but I needed a LOT more than 3 TBS of flour.  I frequently "guesstimate" my measurements but I think I used about 1 cup of flour to 3 cups of mashed peas.  The mixture still never reached a consistency where I could make patties.  I dropped a huge spoonful of batter into the hot pan, waited for one side to cook, and then turned it over with a spatula.  I used the spatula to smash down the burger after flipping it to flatten it out some.  With this change it is a really good basic recipe and a great way to use leftover beans or peas.

These were exactly what I was looking for - a vegetarian burger as enjoyable and satisfying as meat. Like some reviewers, I did find that the flour was not enough, so after having prepared everything else as directed, I then added 1/2 C. unseasoned bread crumbs. I tried a small test patty and it didn't hold together very well. So I added one egg to the mix, and that seemed to help. The only other addition was that I added about 1/2 tsp. cayenne for a little kick. Delicious! I'll definitely make these again. Oh, and perhaps my patties were abnormally small, but I got one dozen patties from this recipe and froze the extra. I ate these on homemade buns with cheddar and a scoop of salsa. Thank you for a great recipe!!!

I think this came out really well! Very tasty. Even my super picky grandmother liked it! 

I did make some modifications though...

1. We didn't have any shallots, so I sauteed chopped brown onion and garlic. 

2. We didn't have any bell pepper either, but I didn't substitute anything for it.

3. I used a bag of frozen black eyed peas and boiled them with smoked turkey legs for flavor. Because of this and the bacon, I didn't add ANY salt. Just black pepper. 

4. I got 7 good-sized patties from the one bag of peas. 

5. I only had about 5 strips of bacon, so I used that (instead of a full half pound). 

6. I dipped each patty in egg (one whole egg, beaten) before rolling it in the flour. I honestly think it would have stuck mostly okay without it. I had none of the problems getting the patties to stick together like some of the other reviews mentioned. They may not have let their beans get soft enough or they didn't mash them enough. I also formed the patties from fully cooled peas.

I improvised a little with ingredients on hand... but this was a great starting place! I also made more, smaller patties because I like the crunchy bits on the outside so much. :) Thanks for sharing!

I went by the recipe and it was great! My grandson (very picky) lived them also. He even ate more after I told him it was black eyed peas.

Yummy, yummy! I just made these as a side dish for dinner. I added a little corn and some parsley.  I didn't have a shallot, so I used onion powder and garlic powder. I recommend making them smaller than the original recipe suggests. Very healthy and tasty.  I am taking these to the next family event.

I love this recipe, I make it all the time for my kids. I use whatever onion I have on hand, and I like to add smoked paprika and cayenne. A big spoonful of fresh pepper sauce and a cube of maggi makes it perfect.

I made it exactly according to the recipe.  I didn't find it necessary to add any more flour than it called for, as many of the reviewers did.  However, since the peas were not leftover (they were straight from a can), it was very bland.  In the future, if it isn't being made from leftovers that I've already seasoned, I will add a lot of additional seasoning -- or buy seasoned peas.  I see a lot of potential for varying this recipe and I will make it again.  I do recommend it,  especially if you are interested, as I am, in decreasing your meat consumption (I did use the bacon in the recipe, but I think it could be left out and not terribly missed).

Excellent! Unless you are making a vegetarian version, try pouring off part of the bacon fat, adding some olive oil, and cooking them in that combination. It's probably no worse than butter and is quite tasty!

To make this a little healthier try cooking in Olive Oil instead of butter and veggie oil. I also used turkey bacon, an egg white to keep together and lightly dusted with flour. This will cut down on the calorie intake. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am glad that I chose to make this. My husband doesn't like black-eye peas so I just had to use them in a way that he would learn to like them differently. They were a hit! He ate a couple and said they were really good! They are going down as my fav and I will make them again in the near future. Thank you for sharing!
