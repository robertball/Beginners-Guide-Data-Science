Overall, i was very surprised with the flavor of this. It actually tasted pretty good. I could see this being served at a wine/cheese type party or just a party with finger foods, as it tasted great at room temp. My oven has broil temperatures so i broiled mine at 475. I checked after 7 minutes and noticed the tops were crisp but the bottoms were soggy so i flipped them and cooked for 7 more minutes(14 min total). I also didn't use toothpicks, the bacon stayed wrapped just fine, and found i only needed 1/3 of a strip of bacon per cherry..and could probably cut that back to 1/4 if you were making these to feed a crowd :)
