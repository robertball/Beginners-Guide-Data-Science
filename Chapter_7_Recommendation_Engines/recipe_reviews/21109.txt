Finally, a recipe for soft, fluffy white bread!  I've been searching and trying for 2 months before I come across this one.  My boyfriend is picky but he loves this one.

Just about the most perfect, versatile, basic white bread you could wish for.  Great texture - soft and moist, yet with the slightly crackly crust I love. I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 tsp. because I don't care for any hint of sweetness and because my bread machine doesn't like too much sugar either and has a tendency to over rise the dough!  I do make a point to use the nonfat dry milk powder when a bread recipe calls for it as it is my understanding that there is something unique to the dry milk powder that helps with the rise and that produces a bread with a soft, velvety texture. The science bears itself out with this bread.  Great basic, everyday bread to refer to over and over again.

This is the best bread I have made yet.  Light and fluffy.  The only change I made was to reduce the quantity of sugar so that the taste was less sweet.

Oh my goodness! This is the most delicious and fluffy bread I have ever made and tasted. Only change I made was 2T of honey in place of sugar and butter in place of the oil.  To die for! I'll totally make this bread for as long as I live.

One of the best White Bread recipes I have made . I do not own a bread machine or powder milk on hand so I heated 1 c. milk and 1/2 c. water. I had a hard time keeping my kids away or they would have finished the loaf in 15 min.

I made this without a bread machine and actually got my first loaf of bread. My only goal was for it to be good enough for stuffing so I was pleased that we were also able to enjoy the rest for sandwiches and toast. Update 7-16-12: I made this again and, while using less than the full 3 cups, got the "ball" that I was missing the first time. I preheated to 425 and then decreased temp to 375...baked for 23 minutes which may have been a tad too long. I got 18 slices out of one loaf which gets it down to about 100cal per slice if counting.

This has become my go to recipe.  It turns out super light and fluffy every time, but it definitely only needs the light crust setting. One custom version that my husband and friends LOVE: Add 1.5 c. of shredded old cheese at appropriate time on your machine, and then add an extra 1/2 cup of crumbled cheddar to the top just as it is about to bake. It makes a DELICIOUS cheese bread!  Perfect for company (or my husband's late night munchies!)

This bread is only fair. I have better recipes for white bread already. It did not rise very well and it was dry. Not a keeper for me.

I used regular flour instead of bread flour and 1&1/2 teaspoons yeast instead of the 1&1/4 stated in the recipe.  I have been looking for a "light" bread and I think I have finally found it.  Very good for sandwich bread, grilled cheese etc, that my other white bread recipes are just too heavy for.  Thanks, I think even hubby will use this one for his sandwiches as he really likes the lighter store bought breads.

Well this recipe saved my bread maker because I was ready to send it back.  I could not find a good bread recipe until now.  I read the reviews and used some of their advice.  I substitued the milk powder and water for 1 cup of warmed milk @ 1 minute in microwave.  I put 2T honey instead of sugar, and I put 1 teaspoon  of butter flavoring.  I used the basic setting and light crust.  Wow!  This bread is what I have been searching for.  Needless to say I baked about 10 before this one recipe.  I was ready to return my bread maker but not anymore, it's a keeper.

Excellent! I made this loaf to be used as the bread cubes in a breakfast casserole, and it could not have turned out more perfectly. The texture, taste, and fluffiness were exactly what I was hoping for! I think it would be yummy sliced for sandwiches too.

I have made this recipe several times, and it has always turned out great. I have also substituted multi-grain flour for one cup of the white bread flour... it still turned out lovely.

My husband decided to search the internet for a bread machine recipe that he wanted to take on himself and he came across this one. I have to say, we LOVED it! It was perfectly soft and tender and the crust was a lovely texture. It has been suggested that this will be made many many many times in the future! :) Thank you for this recipe!

The flavour of this bread was very nice. However it only made 1/2 a loaf in my breadmaker. I think it needs more yeast?

A great recipe, but I tweaked it a bit.  I only added 1 tbs of oil, and then I placed 1 tbs of butter (cut up and placed in corners of pan)on top of the other ingred.  Came out great!

This recipe is great! I've made it as is, and then got a little creative and substituted chocolate milk for the water and milk flakes. Made a great brownie bread! Talk about a versatile recipe. 

Thanks for sharing!

I had tried to make loaf for serveral month with a very bumpy experience. 
This one is very good! The bread is white and flaky with milky fragnance. This is the best among the 5 loafs I have tried in the last week. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great recipe, I did notice that the dough was a little dry when I followed the recipe to the letter so I added an extra 1/8th of a cup of water. The second time I made it I used three Tablespoons of honey instead of sugar and all other ingredients were as the recipe showed, it turned out to be the best tasting bread I've made in my bread machine yet. Perfect consistency, flavor and mouth feel. Thanks for the great starter recipe!!!

Like another reviewer, my bread came out lumpy. The crust was also hard and it was not light. I didn't have any bread improver, and maybe that would have made the difference.

I am always in search or good bread recipes for my bread machine. This definetely tops the list. I did not have any powdered milk so substituted 1 cup warmed milk for the water. I too used the honey in place of the sugar. Bread flour, or unbleached flour worked great. I placed the indgredients in my bread machine and let it go to work. This is one of those comfort foods. My son is home sick today and this is something he could easily eat with his homemade chicken soup.

light and fluffy just the way I like it! I had given up on white bread recipes for my bread machine until now! I had been making Italian bread for everything because I found white bread recipes to be so dense and blah. This is delicious and now a family fav!! I did use 1c of whole milk and .5c of water warmed with a full packet of active yeast. it came out better than I imagined. I hope I never forget this recipe as long as I live lol Enjoy!
