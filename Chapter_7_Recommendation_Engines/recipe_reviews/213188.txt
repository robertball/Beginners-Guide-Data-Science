I made these with regular sugar and different nuts.  I didn't have a 9 x 11 pan so I used 9 x 9 and it took forever to bake and the edges were over done. I would go bigger  (9 X 13 ) next time for sure.  Despite my crispy edges they were very good, rich and moist without being too sweet, a little different than the usual brownies I make but very well received and all gone in 15 minutes! I would make these again.

I've made these again a few times and found the following... Use a chocolate with 75% cacoa for the best colour, they come out a rich, dark brown.   (55% cacoa chocolate tatsted good too but was not as appealing on the plate as the dark ones)  A 9x13 pan works well but I still added 5 minutes to the baking time.  The brownies also taste best when they have totally cooled.  I can't wait to find another reason to bake these. Is Wednesday a good enough reason?

I tried these because I had leftover sour cream to use up.  They didn't seem special to me -- I have other, richer recipes.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for using a 9x13 pan, and I cooked it for 35 mins.
It turned out great, I would make these again!
