In my opinion, for all the effort that it takes to make this - it's not difficult, just tedious - the results are no better than your average slam and dunk French Toast. It also contains an exhorbitant amount of butter. I'd pass for something a little quicker and healthier.

This is an excellent recipe to use as a basic pain perdu recipe, to which you can add warm gnutella and make sandwiches of before french-toasting, or cream cheese and orange marmalade a la Mimi's Restaurant.  A super use for leftover egg bread and a rich treat!

The only thing that makes this different from plain ole french toast is the type of bread you use. It did make a nice batter that coated well though. I just used french bread left from NY's dinner.

This recipe gets three stars because the word to describe it is "quite", the batter was quite thin, the taste was quite cinnamony and the pain perdue was quite good.

This was very good!  So filling and needed nothing on top!  I put a little powdered sugar on it, but my fiance liked it plain!  Very good and will be making it again!!!

I didn't like this recipe. It's over complicated and doesn't taste any better than simple french toast unlike the recipe description says.

Best French Toast I've ever made! Sweet, moist, and tasty! Only sprinkled powdered sugar when it was done. It was a hit with the whole family!
