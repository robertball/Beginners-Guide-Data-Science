This is a really good side dish with lots of flavor.  You really do need to let it cook for the recommended 20 minutes to thicken and give the flavors a chance to meld.  I used black beans and pintos instead of black-eyed peas, added only 1 tsp of Tabasco and then put the bottle at the table for additional spiciness.  As I always do with bean dishes like this, I added just a splash of olive oil and vinegar right before serving.  It's really low in calories and fat, has good fiber, not too high in carbs, so you can enjoy this with a clear conscience.  Served with sliced red jalapeno peppers, chopped green onions, and a dollop of sour cream.

I think this is an extremely yummy, healthy dish, that's easy to take to work for lunch.

My gut instinct shouted at me NOT to include the ginger.  It just didn’t seem to belong here. Hubs talked me into taking a chance on it. I was right – the ginger was just wrong.  I salvaged this by rinsing it all in a wire mesh strainer, and re-using the beans in another recipe.  In a nutshell, this recipe, with its unusual inclusions of ginger and mustard, was just not palatable for us.

I had to cut this recipe in half to serve just my husband and I for dinner.  Also, I used ranch-style beans with jalapeno instead of the black beans and black-eyed peas because that's all I had.  We enjoyed these very much, they were well flavored and spicy, just the way we like our beans.  I made this as a side dish for a chile rellenos dish from this site, and dinner was wonderful!  Thanks so much.

Not much taste, not much spice.

I liked the way this smelled as it cooked. I added 1/4 tsp lime pickle (very hot) in place of the hot sauce. I added 1 pouch of Lipton roasted garlic and onion soup mix plus 1 fresh onion. I used no salt. I put a tsp of each spice listed. I used 2 cans of 6 bean mix. I think this was tasty.
