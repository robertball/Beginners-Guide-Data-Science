The original recipe submitted said about a teaspoon per pound of meat.  Mix the seasoning into the mix before forming the patties.  The amount listed is supposed to make 24 patties, but it depends on the size of the patties that you make.

I have one big problem with this recipe, and that is the recipe writer gives no idea at all on how much to use.  And, unfortunately, it’s not something that you can taste-check before you cook the ground beef.  I know everybody’s tastes differ, but there should be a recommended “starting point.”  I added 2 tsp to 1 lb of ground beef for grilled burgers and thought it tasted pretty good, but my husband said he could barely tell the difference.  Not sure I’ll be mixing it up again.

I added some to the beef before cooking, not knowing how it would be. I was afraid it might be too spicy. I also added some once my burger was cooked. It added a nice flavor to the meat everyone gave it thumbs up!

I tried this on my new husband and he didn't like it. So I changed the celery salt to celery flakes and dropped the salt. I let everyone salt there own burger's now.And use 2 T. of mix for 1 pound of meat, beef or chicken.

I will definitely use this recipe again. It made delicious burgers. I had 2 minor problems with this recipe; 1.) The recipe doesn't entail how much of this recipe to use per pounds of meat. It doesn't say if you are to simply season the top of the meat or mix it into the meat. Generally, 1/4 lb of meat is the typical size for a meat patty. So I changed the serving size to 4 on here. Then mixed it a lb of meat.   2.) It was a little too salty for my taste. Next time, I will substitute regular salt for the kosher salt. If it's still too salty, I will drop the salt altogether and only use the celery salt.

Great seasoning for a diet. Just leave out the salt.

I left out the salt and cayenne for personal preferences and used @ 1 tsp per lb of ground beef. This is now a staple in my cupboard, made up and ready to use.

This seasoning was nice. I added some Worcestershire sauce in with it. I cut each of the peppers in half, and I thought it was still a bit peppery. I didn't think it was too salty. I used probably a little over a teaspoon for a pound of meat.

This turned out super salty and didn't taste good at all.  Maybe some of my seasonings were too old, but I won't be making it again.
