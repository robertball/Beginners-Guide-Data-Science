I scaled this recipe back a little (there are just 2 of us).  I used lean farm-raised (longhorn lean) stewing beef and farm-raised pork.  I didn't used chicken or chicken broth - I used beef broth.  I used all spices recommended by this recipe, including Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar barbecue sauce.  Except for the onion, carrot and potato, I use whatever vegetables we like - it's all good.  Serve with sweet corn bread and honey butter.  YUMMMMM!

It was good, but nothing special. Just tasted like a normal stew. I had some leftover raw chicken, pork, & beef from other recipes earlier this week, so it worked well to throw them all together. I added only 1/4 the BBQ sauce it called for, kind of wish I hadn't added any. It really just adds sugar to the soup. It's not a bad standard stew recipe, though.

For the meat I used pulled pork. I had about a pound and a half leftover pulled pork and decided to use it. This Burgoo recipe is wonderful. The whole family loved it.
