I thought this was pretty good if you really have a craving for Indian.  I did cut some calories by using light coconut milk and light sour cream.  Served with jasmine rice.  It was pretty easy to prepare, although there were a lot of ingredients - I would recommend measuring and putting all the spices together before starting to cook the onions.  Overall it was tasty, but I didn't find it exceptional.

This was a HUGE hit at my last dinner party. I would give this 5 stars except I changed the recipe a bit. I left out the last 5 ingredients and it turned out great. I just couldn't add ketchup and sour cream, and didn't need the milk, bouillon or ground almonds. As others suggested I also used light coconut milk, and cooked it much longer than indicated to get my potatoes to cook through. I used new potatoes, and needed to add about 15 minutes to the cook time. Squeeze some lime juice over just before serving. Yummy!

I have been making curry almost weekly for quite some time now.  For some reason, I got a bug to try a new recipe and this is one that popped up.   I chose it because of its use of garam masala and turmeric - true flavors of India.  My family eats a gluten and casein (dairy) free diet so I did make some changes.  My replacements were as follows:  butter - Earth Balance soy-free milk - DariFree milk replacer sour cream - Tofutti Better Than Sour Cream chicken bouillon - Gluten free all-natural chicken flavor concentrate  I also only had one regular potato so I used it and a sweet potato, as sweet potatoes are what I typically use in my curry.  I did not add the ground almonds because I didn't feel it needed thickening.  Others mentioned they did not add the ketchup.  I did but didn't really taste what difference it made.  The taste of this was about four stars.  I almost gave this three stars because I felt the recipe called for a lot of ingredients - not to mention, ingredients not typically used in curry but I felt that it is not the fault of recipe provider that I'm spoiled by another recipe that has less ingredients.  The recipe I normally use packs a much more flavorful punch and this one left me feeling that it was good but needed something.  Maybe lemon juice?

loved this curry.  i left out the last 5 ingredients and it turned out yummy.  i used full fat coconut milk (coconut fat is good for you) and red potatoes.  the only problem was even on low heat w/ the lid on, it stuck a little on the bottom, but not enough to effect the dish.  next time i will add chopped cilantro and green tomato chutney and naan bread.

Fabulous recipe.  I adjusted the spices for our tastes, used chopped fresh cauliflower instead of potatoes, left out the milk, sour cream and almonds. Served with naan bread. Everyone loved it.

Loved this!  I scaled my recipe back to 2 servings as I only had a half can of lite coconut milk to use up.  I used several mini potatoes as they were all I had on hand, and I cooked them ahead in the microwave for a couple of minutes based on others comments - perfect!  I also left out the ground almonds and cubes of bouillon - the almonds I did not have, and the bouillon cubes I do not use, but figured they would just add a ton of sodium anyway!  Fantastic...next time will make it to serve over basmati as I only ate it as a side dish to my chicken!!  Super yummy, will make again for sure :)

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't add any sour cream, as I didn't have any, but it tasted wonderful without it.  Even my pulse-hating 13 year old son came back for second helpings!

This was really good and very simple. I quadrupled this recipe to make it for a group of about 15 people. I didn't add the milk or ketchup. I also used the seasoning All Spice instead of the Garam Masala. Since I was using four cans of coconut milk, I substituted one with a can of lite coconut milk.

Incredible...even my 9 year old loved it! I didn't have chickpeas so I used 2 more potatoes but other than that I followed the recipe to the T. It just doesn't get any better. The potatoes melt in your mouth...the spice is heaven for your senses!

This is such a disappointing recipe given all the ingredients. I felt like it had little flavor. I won't make this again.

Love it!! I've made it 2x and now it'll become a frequent meal in our home. I can't see the ketchup working so I didn't use it, I wanted it to keep it as lean as possible so I also omitted the sour cream. I didn't have garam masala but I just upped the other spices and it still was a big hit!

Super yummy! The paprika and sugar are a joke...unecessary (as well as tumeric). Coconut milk is sweet enough in this...in fact I had to add more ketchup (instead of tomato sauce) and more curry and garam masala. I also sauteed the potatoes with the seaonings step to coat them, before putting in liquids. I don't know if that helped or not...

This was so yummy and easy! I don't really measure but did take proportions of spices into account (i.e., more garam masala than sugar and salt). Some specifics: I only used 1 bullion cube; used ~5 garlic cloves; only had 1/2 a tomato so added a can of diced. Mine had to simmer much longer before the potatoes and [soaked dry] chickpeas became tender. Wish I had had some fresh cilantro for garnish! Served with naan instead of rice.

I thought this was excellent. I had to leave out the garam masala and still thought it was great. I added finely chopped cauliflower instead of potatoes to keep it low carb and used canned tomatoes. Very easy and tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very well received! I used half of the amt of sour cream and added zucchini and yellow squash towards the end, and it tasted fabulous! I paired mine with brown rice, but it's good stand-alone.

I forgot to get sour cream and therefore used ricotta cheese instead. This may have contributed to a slightly too-sweet taste.  Apart from this, I thought the recipe was very good.

I was pleasantly surprised with how good this turned out. I substituted water for the milk because I ran out and added spinach and cauliflower at the last five mins of the simmering time. It was perfect ????. Definitely recommend giving this recipe a try.

Fantastic!  Good Indian recipes like this keep me from spending money at Indian restaurants that are 25 miles away.  This was delicious.  We have leftovers for tomorrow.  I can't wait to eat it again!

I didn't use coconut milk, or sour cream, I just used no fat yogurt, and semi skimmed milk, sooo good and cut down on calories/fat :) . Also added a few chilli flakes for an extra kick, and fresh coriander for freshness.

I have my own version of chickpea curry but I wanted to try this take. I followed everything to the letter. I really, really enjoyed this as it had a lot of delicate and layered flavors. For people who generally puts a lot of salt or sodium, you will need to add more or have some mango pickle as a condiment! I didn't add more salt as this is where you will pick up the flavor profiles.

I enjoys this recipe, but just like others I made a few changes. No ketchup. 6 oz coconut milk, 6 oz water to reduce fat. Replace milk with water too bc I needed to cut out diary. No garlic, but some garlic powder instead

This is an amazing curry! I am not vegetarian but am trying to include a few veggie meals in my diet. I made the recipe exactly as it states except without the cubes, and I actually added a few bits of cauliflower, spinach and par boiled the potatoes before putting them in. I even put in the ketchup and sour cream. I cooked it all together for about 40 minutes and the consistency was perfect! Served with rice and a little naan. Amazing recipe, if this is what being a vegetarian is like, I could do it, yum.

Per reviews... Double recipe but still use just 1 can of full fat coconut milk.  Might not need last 5 ingredients at all. Use veg broth instead of bullion cubes.  Add chicken and vegetables as you want.

Great recipe full of flavor. If you want to add a little oomph (it doesn't have a lot of heat), add some chili sauce. I loved the blend of spices with coconut milk, milk, and sour cream. A very richly flavored sauce.

Fixed it very close to described, but added a large fresh minced (seeded) jalapeño pepper for a little extra 'oomph.' Also parboiled the (small quartered gold) potatoes. Also used light coconut milk. It was mild but delicious, served over white rice.

This recipe was fantastic.  I followed it pretty closely, only omitting the garam masala (didn't have it). I also used about 2/3 of a cup of ground almonds instead of only 1/4 cup, which I think thickened up my sauce a bit more. Also, like other reviewers, I simmered it about 40 minutes total so that my potatoes would be nice and tender. We ate this over simple white rice and everyone loved it. My sister and dad added sauteed shrimp to theirs but it was just as tasty without. This was so flavorful and satisfying, exactly what I was looking for when I looked up curry recipes.

Made just as described. Really nice taste. It did take longer for my potatoes to get soft...but it was worth the wait. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
