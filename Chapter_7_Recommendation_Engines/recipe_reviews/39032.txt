I made this last night, and my boyfriend and I each had a serving while it was semi-warm.  I poured the pudding into individual plastic cups with lids and put them in the fridge, and we ate the rest of it with lunch today!  This recipe is very simple to make, and very rich because of the evaporated milk.  Next time, I will experiment and make it using regular whole milk for comparison.  Definitely better than boxed instant pudding and boxed cook-and-serve!

This makes a good pudding when you tweak it a little.  I use 2 cups milk instead of the 1 can of evaporated.  It makes it less thick.  After it sets up using the evap. milk it's consistency is undesirable.  However, after mixing the dry together in the pot first, then adding 2 cups regular milk and whisking until thickened, works well.  I add the vanilla with the milk addition.  I also add a pinch of Kosher Salt.  The butter is added at the end when the heat and pudding are off the stove.  This really is good when made this way.

Quick to make and easy too.Make when everything else is planned.Needs close watching and frequent stirring.use a wisk to prevent lumps.Cook on lowest temperture or use a double boiler to prevent scortching.I used sugar replacement and low fat cool whip.Healthier version

This is too thick, and doesn't have the depth of chocolatiness I was looking for.  While it is as easy as box pudding, the seasoned palate will find the texture and taste less than desired.  Perhaps the recipe could be adjusted to lessen the cornstarch, and increase the depth of chocolate...I probably won't use this recipe again as there are so many classic recipes out there, but I will say that this was VERY quick!  If you like to experiment, this is a good place to start from.  If all you've ever used previously is boxed mix, this may be an improvement. If the flavor issues were resolved, then this would make a good pie, as it would stay in form and not run all over the plate.

I use this recipe in my  beginning culinary arts classes.  It is quick, easy, and uses ingredients 
commonly on hand.  Students and I agree that it tastes great.

I thought it was awfully cornstarchy.  I had to add extra sugar and some skim milk to make it better, and even then I didn't really like it.  I prefer Jello brand, even the instant 5-minute kind, over this.

Tastes great. I used chocolate chips instead of cocoa (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup). I also added one more tablespoon of cornstarch, and had to cook the pudding for about 5 minutes longer than the recipe stated for it to thicken. I will definitely make this again. It's not much harder than instant.

Just what I was craving! I used regular (not fat-free) evaporated milk and it worked just fine. Mine thickened at the 5 min mark, which allowed me to eat it 2 mins sooner! YUM!

Next time I'd like to try almond flavoring and another time try Dutch Cocoa.

I was afraid it was going to take a while longer than 7 minutes, but when my timer went off, it really was done! (It didn't thicken up until the VERY end, so don't worry!) And don't judge it before you get the butter and vanilla in, it still tasted like cocoa, but that last touch really changed the flavor! Great recipe

This is so good, quick and easy to make. It tastes like brownie mix. I did bake a couple if changes because of items on hand. Used flour instead of cornstarch, whisked my dry ingredients before adding liquid and used 4 tbsp of white sugar and 4 tbsp of brown sugar...yes I added 2 extra tbsp of sugar.

Because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, I made the following changes: Warmed the milk, sugar, and salt in a pot over low heat. I used a 1oz. unsweetened baking chocolate square, which I added to the milk. Wisked until chocolate was completely melted. I used 1/8 c. plus 1/2 Tbsp. of arrowroot, which I mixed into 1/2 c. of water. I wisked the arrowroot mixture into the hot chocolate mixture; kept wisking til thickened. Added the butter and vanilla last. Pudding came out silky smooth and delicious. Husband and kids loved it.

I changed this recipe too much to give it a fair rating - I used 3 cups skim milk in place of evap. and water, but then needed another teaspoon or so of cornstarch to thicken. But, I did whisk the dry ingredients with the milk first and it was lump free. But, from placed in the pan time to thicken was at least 15 minutes. Could have been the skim milk. I'll try this again with heavy cream, but it definitely needs more chocolate - maybe some high-end semi-sweet chips.

This made quite a bit of pudding.  It was able to feed 6 people well.  We omitted the butter, but will definitely add it to the next batch I make.  The family says this is a keeper because it's better then the box and creamier!  YUM!!!  We ate it warm with marshmallows on top!  I highly recommend this!  We used Alberson's Evaporated Milk, Hershey's Cocoa.  EXCELLENT!!

I have made this several times and like it very much.  However, it is creamy the first day but if you have any leftover, it will be like thick pie filling the next day.  I usually cut the cornstarch in half.  I tried making it with Splenda and it was AWFUL.

I followed the recipe except I used Splenda in place of the sugar.  It had a really funky taste.  Even the kids didn't like it!  I will go back to the Jell-o Sugar Free Cook & Serve chocolate pudding until I find something better.

Just Awful!  Thick, creamy, fast, and bad.
