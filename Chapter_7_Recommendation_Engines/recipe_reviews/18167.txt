The actual cake part of this recipe was really good but the "glaze" that you pour over it just totally ruined the entire recipe.  Everyone in my family agreed that this was just disgusting and the whole cake was tossed in the trash, sadly.  I will definately use the cake recipe again but next time...we'll use a nice chocolate buttercream frosting on the top!

Cake cooked up beautifully and had a nice sweet taste. However, there is no chocolaty to this. 1 Tbsp of cocoa is only enough to color it beige, not flavor it nor make it chocolate tasting. The icing after boiling 5 minutes seems to reach softball sugar stage and isn't absorbed by the cake. If after cooling that changes I will update my review. Thanks Karin, but I won't be making this one again.

This cake, when warm was too soppy (from the topping) to cut well.  It was also  too sweet for my family.
