Great, quick recipe, but I changed it a bit.  I omitted the sun dried tomatoes, and just used olive oil, salt and freshly ground pepper for the dressing.  I also chopped all ingredients for a nice texture and added fresh oregeno.

This is the best greek salad recipe I've come across.  Using Kalamata olives instead of black olives is a must though.  Both my husband and I thought the sun-dried tomatoes really made this salad great.  Next time I will toss the salad with a dash of oil and then sprinkle the feta cheese on top.  The oil from the sun-dried tomatoes turned my feta cheese pink and took away from the appearance.  I may also try this salad with an infused oil instead.

I didn't seed my cucumbers, and I added a tablespoon of good quality balsamic vinegar just to pick it up a little.  This is exactly what a Mediterranean Greed Salad should taste like.

This is absolutely the best Greek salad I've had outside of Greece! Refreshing and beautiful!  Definitely use kalamata olives, though.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used just 1 Tbls. of the oil and added 1 Tbls. red wine vinegar.

This was a great base for a salad recipe, however, I found it to be a bit bland.  So I added 1-2 tsp  mediterranean rice seasoning, a little jamaican allspice, some cracked pepper and salt.  Also a bunch of fresh torn spinach and some romaine...got rave reviews from all!!! Thanks
Heather!

This is my Greek boyfriend's favorite Greek salad ever.  The sundried tomatoes really make the salad.  I add a little extra olive oil and some red wine vinegar (and lots of salt and pepper).  This recipe can easily be made ahead, but I add the feta just before serving.  Fabulous summer salad!!

Excellent recipe!  I used kalamata olives instead and it was still delicious.  I peeled the cucumbers, which I think takes away from the color of the salad, but I don't like the texture of the peel.  I only used 1 tbs. of the sun-dried tomato oil and added 1 tbs. of red wine vinegar instead (a little more tang).  Lastly, I added a bit of cumin to give it a little extra flavor.  Will definitely repeat!

This salad was tasty and easy to prepare.  My husband ate two big bowls and we both absolutely loved it.  I only put in two cucumbers instead of three but it was still delicious.  If you plan to bring this to a party, it needs to be made fresh before serving.  I brought leftovers today for my lunch and it was runny and soggy, still good, but will not present well.

This was a refreshing salad, easy to make.  I forgot to put in the sundried tomatoes, but it stilled turned out wonderful!  My husband loved it.  It did get quite a bit runny though--I actually had to drain some of the liquid before serving it.

I received high praise from my family when I made this salad.  I served it with the Greek Chicken and Greek Style Potatoes (both recipes on this site).

Each section of Greece puts it's stamp on "Greek Salad."  This is very close to the Island of Kos version I ate every night for more than a week.  In the Kos version the addition of red wine vinegar and dried oregano gives the right complexity of flavor.  Black olives have the wrong flavor for true Greek food.  Use Kalamata olives instead.  I usually make this up early and let the flavors "marry."

This salad is amazing.  I made it for a side dish at a party we had and it was a HUGE hit :-)  I used Kalamata olives instead of black, and did not use the reserved oil from the sun dried tomatoes, but rather the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing recipe on this site.  Wonderful stuff.  I ended up chopping my cucumbers because I didn't have anything to slice them like in the picture.  I think the ratio of all of the ingredients for the salad was perfect.  This is now my go to Greek salad recipe.

This was an absolutely fabulous salad.  I did use Greek black olives but found them very oily as they are packed in oil/vinegar base.  Calamata or regular black olives would be better.  I didn't use the sun dried tomatoes at all.  I used the "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" recipe from All Recipes for the dressing.  Used a slice of red onion instead of onion powder, added a tablespoon of sugar and a half cup of parmesan cheese to the dressing recipe.  Mixed in a blender.  Wonderful.  Perfect for summer.

Because this recipe leans to a Greek salad I used kalamati (?) olives instead of black olives.  Made it a second time and used the black olives.  They were okay but the kalamati olives definately added to the recipe.

Nice greek salad. Perfect for a hot summer evening. Tastes great even the next day. I used Kalamata olives instead of the black olives.

This is a great summer salad! With fresh whole wheat bread it is a complete healthy meal.  The only addition I made was to add virgin olive oil and 1 tbs  of balsamic vinegar.

Very delicious.  I cut back on the amount of oil.  I used dry sun dried tomatoes that I marinated in olive oil since that is what I had.  Eat all of the salad the first day because it does not keep.

Try using fresh mozzarella instead of the feta if you will be traveling with this salad. (the feta makes it runny and milky if it sets too long.)  Just pat the cheese dry and slice to bite size.  I know mozzarella is not greek but it will give you the same idea.

Yum. So simple yet so good!!! Immediately emailed
my Mom the recipe! It turns out well even with 
the untasty feta cheese available in the UK. 
So I can only imagine how amazing it is with the
real thing and fresh garden-grown veggies!

We can't get enough of this salad!  I slice my English cucumbers and red onion paper thin with my mandolin and let everything mingle in the fridge overnight - tossing the feta in just before serving.

I am going to make yours.  It looks great.

My mother taught me an easy version she learned from a cooking segment on TV.  We would be less fancy not seeding or slicing thin the cucumbers and tomato was what we had; cherry, plumb, roasted, beef, it was all good.

Romaine

Tuna, Black or Greek Olives, Tomatoes or Roasted Tomatoes, Feta, Cucumbers, Red Onion

Olive Oil, Balsamic Vingegar, Some Water, Crushed Garlic, Salt and Pepper - Mix and chill in fridge for 1 hour or more.  

Gently pour dressing on Romaine, then add other ingredients on top of Romanine, gently pour dressing on these ingredients.

A pretty salad with a pleasant taste. Not significantly different from many other Greek salads, and missing some ingredients that might add more flavour, like oregano, lemon and garlic.

This is a good, simple guide.  I usually add 2 heads of romaine lettuce and adjust down the amount of cucumber.  Also, kalamata olives are a needed improvement over the black ones called for in the recipe.  Finally, I omit the sun-dried tomatoes and oil and instead use 1-2 tbsp of olive oil and 1-2 tbsp of red wine vinegar with a pinch  (or two) of cumin.  Serve with warm crusty bread!

This salad was amazing!! The sun dried tomatoes and the olives were fantastic!  I also added a little red wine vinegar and olive oil. Make sure you use fresh veggies it makes a big difference.  This was even delicious the next day!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very flavorful salad.  I took it to a cookout and it was a hit especially with the ladies, the guys were hesitant because of the feta, but I received many compliments.  Full of flavor.  I did add a little salt and pepper.

This is an excellent recipe.  My wife and I have ventured into Greek food for a few years now, and I'm not going to say that invariably we've seen the inclusion on this salad with radishes, parsley, dried(or fresh) oregano or marjoram, black pepper, balsamic vinegar, a bit of lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil, but definitely, we've seen these ingredients as part of the salad very frequently.  I think that the addition of these ingredients, one one hand can't hurt, but on the other, they by all means, can enhance and enrich the flavor.  Let's not forget that the ingredients that we're mentioning here are Mediterranean and Greek (even though such description is somewhat redundant).

This is the perfect summer salad! Great for a Greek night at home or for a summer picnic. Holds up very well. And, the quantity of ingredients can be modified to your taste. I use Kalamata olives instead of the black for a little more authentic taste. My only problem is how much juice comes out of the veggies. It doesn't distort the flavor, just doesn't look very pretty. I think next time I'll try letting them drain in a colander overnight before I add the feta and oil. This is a fairly time-consuming recipe because of all the chopping, but can easily be made ahead of time.

SOOOO YUMMY! Only on this one necessary condition...you have to try it with Absolutely Fabulous Greek-House Dressing from this website (seriously)! The changes I made based on personal preference were: I cut back on the onion, used reduced-fat feta and the entire jar of sundried tomatoes. I can't wait to serve on my next dinner party!!!

This is an excellent salad. I used fresh garden cucumbers and fresh tomatoes, I do recommend the Roma tomatoes as regular tomatoes will make it watery unless you take out all the seeds. I also pour a little extra virgin olive oil over it. I let it marinate for about 3 hours and it always disappears!  One of our favorite salads.

This is GREAT with some adjustments.  I find that 3 cucumbers is too many; I use 2.  And to make it more colorful, I peel the cucumber in stripes, leaving some of the skin on.  For the dressing, I added 1/2 tsp oregano, 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp red wine vinegar, and salt & pepper to taste.  It's really a light & easy salad, and very tasty!  Definitely use Kalamata olives, they make a world of difference.  Make it, but just make it my way.  :)

LOVED IT! I used Kalamata olives and salt and pepper. I also added GREEK SEASONING from Clubhouse. Next time I will only add the feta when it's ready to to serve. Great Salad.

This was good, but nothing amazing.  I highly recommend using kalamata olives rather than black... that was the best part!

Really like this recipe.  Simple and the flavors combine so well.  I used feta cheese with sun-dried tomatoes in it, in addition to the called for sun-dried tomatoes in the recipe.  Will make again.

I enjoyed this salad, and found myself going back for more.  I used about a 1/3 cup finely chopped kalamata olives because I not really an olive fan, but I didn't mind this amount at all. Dash of pepper was good too. I plan to make this again!

Not too shabby. The oil in the sundried tomatoes I purchased was a little bland and 'muddy' tasting. I would probably replace that oil in the salad with real olive oil for a little extra tang next time. Also, some feta cheese with herbs would add a wee bit more excitement than just plain feta.  Overall this is good though and is now SAVED!

Excellent and easy to make.  I rolled some long cucumber slices around an olive and stuffed it with sundried tomatoes for garnish.  Went really well with the Greek Garlic-Lemon Potatoes from this site and part of my Greek themed dinner.  The leftovers were even better the next day!

It's a nice change from the regular lettuce-based salads we eat. Not only is it healthy, it's also very tasty and easy to make. Even my boyfriend was able to make some for himself without me having to chop anything for him.

*I try to put in less tomato seeds as possible especially when I'm not using roma tomatoes 'cause it can get too watery even without the cucumber core.

This was very good and simple. I used fresh sun-dried tomatoes rather than oil-packed, so I just drizzled regular olive oil and a bit of red-wine vinegar over the salad. Next time, I'll add some fresh herbs (mint and parsley, oregano, or basil would work well).

Made this as a side dish but after tasting it ran to the store for a good hard salami and it became an entree. I used kalamata olives for that "bite" and used a splash of red wine vinegar. This was wonderful, full of flavor.

This recipe is Delicious! I added some quartered artichoke hearts and leftover baked chicken and it turned out great! My husband loved it so much he asked if we could make it a weekly meal; and with it being so nutritious and healthy I say "why not?". Thank you!

I really liked this recipe. I think it needs Klamata  olives instead of the black olives. I would also lose the sun dried tomatoes and maybe make a quick Greek vinaigrette to put over it. I thought it was slightly bland. Otherwise a great salad!

simple, easy, and great fresh taste. i didn't have any sun dried tomatoes, but the fresh tomatoes i thought were enough. i added salt for taste, and found that the feta adds a salty aftertaste. the onions weren't overpowerful, like i thought they would be. a great summer dish.

A great change of pace salad.  Can also use fresh tomatoes and drizzle a little EVO over all.  Season with cracked pepper and sea salt.  I used less feta but it was still delicious.

Always a great salad for those lazy days. I did not have the sun-dried tomatoes, but it did great without. I also added some freshly made zesty garlic and herb dressing to liven the flavor.

This salad is delicious.  I added a few more sun-dried tomatoes and only used 1 cucumber.  Also added a splash of balsamic vinegar..which gave it a little extra flavor.

This is the best salad recipe. It consists of all the things you love in a salad, plus I can make it for the kids and they don't have to pick around any lettuce. I used feta with cracked pepper in it for extra flavor. This salad goes great with heavy pastas. Plus every one at parties love it.

This definitely makes a lot. We left out the sundried tomatoes as a personal preference and it was quite good, just as Greek salad should be. However, all that feta made the salad itself slightly salty, I think I will cut down on it next time.

The sun-dried tomatoes I had were not in oil, so I had to make a dressing. I just mixed some olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt and pepper for the dressing. I enjoyed this a lot as an alternative to a lettuce based salad. Next time I will try half black olives and half kalamata olives. This would also be good with a little orzo mixed in.

I was looking to make a different kind of Greek salad since I make one at least once a month in the summer as it is.  However when I make mine, I use just plain vinegar.  By adding red wine vinegar in this salad, it gave it a great tangy pop and I love the addition of the sun dried tomatoes.  However, I still wanted to make it more Mediterranean, sort of like the med salads I have had in restaurants.  So, keeping everything the same with the exception of the oil from the sun dried tomatoes (I used a good quality Greek olive oil instead) and adding a tbsp of red wine vinegar; I also used a heaping tbsp of Greek seasoning (an essential Greek spice in any kitchen) and I chopped up two romaine hearts lettuce.  I mixed all the veggies, seasoning and lettuce together before I crumbled the feta on top.   It was Out of this World.  A great base recipe with a little pizzazz added is well worth the small effort to make this.

I made this salad exactly as listed, except I used white onion instead of red onion because I didn't have any red onion.  I thought the salad was bland and nothing and special.  The recipe titled Tomato, Basil, and Feta Salad has similar ingredients, but is  far more flavorful and delicious.

I was bitterly disappointed in this recipe as written.  It was bland.  I allowed it to chill for two hours hoping for improvement, but there was none.  I then added capers, two tablespoons of lemon juice and freshly chopped oregano and basil.

Always nice to see a Greek (or almost Greek) recipe!
Add a sliced green bell pepper and capers and try it with oregano or finely chopped parsley. 
Don't forget extra virgin olive oil. After chilling, have a home baked bread to deep into the yummy juices !

Excellent. Excellent.  I loved it!    This recipe is a super easy one and it tastes delicious.    One change I will make...out with the black olives - their good, but I will definitely try a mix of Mediterranean/Greek olives - stronger flavor.    I didn't have roma tomatoes on hand (and neither did the grocery store thanks to the tomato crisis), so I used grape tomatoes and halved them.  I also added a tad of salt/pepper.    I prepped the whole salad ahead of time- minus the oil, covered, and refrigerated.  It was nice and crisp.  I added the oil right before serving.

Too much onion.  I'd recommend half as much.

I made this more of a salad.  I tore up green lettuce, not iceberg, and then added the vegetables on top of it.  I didn't use the sun dried tomatoes to cut out some of the cost.  I also made a dressing of 1/2 cup of olive oil, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons of fresh ground paper, 2 tsp of salt, a couple of shakes of ground red pepper, and 1/6-1/4 cup of red wine vinegar.  It was delicious!

This was yummy. I used kalamata instead of black olives, and chopped them up into smaller pieces. I also used the dressing called "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" from allrecipes instead of theirs. Omitted the sundried tomatoes because the grocery store was out. Just goes to show you can't mess this one up by being creative.

WOW!  My husband and I gobbled up the whole batch in one sitting.  I followed the recipe exactly, but then about half way through eating it decided to perform a little experiment and added a splash of balsamic vinegar and a dash of greek seasoning (Penzey's) and it was even better.  Can't wait to make it again!

We loved this salad, but we thought the onions were over-powering.  Next time I will use less  red onion.  I also used garlic and herb feta and kalamata olives.  A very delicious salad!

This salad was really full of flavor. I added a few whole pepperonchini peppers for a little kick.  For an afternoon lunch I added a few cubes of capicola  ham and pepperoni and served it on top of crisp romain lettuce leaves. This is so flavorful and versatile. Just overall, a great recipe.

Great dish.  Dry light and bright. Perfect for summer. I served it over a bed of greens and paired it with a warm grain dish for a meatless dinner option. I decreased the tomatoes, olives, onions and cheese to my families tastes as well as omitting the oil from the sun dried tomatoes and using olive oil and balsamic to dress it.

I added some salt, pepper and balsamic vinegar. The vinegar discolored the feta cheese, so it wasn’t as pretty. Perhaps I’ll just use some regular vinegar or white wine vinegar next time. The kids weren’t big fans, but I thought it was great.

If you are looking for something different to make with fresh cucumbers, this is a great combination.  I really liked the feta, black olives, and sun dried tomatoes.  It felt more like a side salad compared to just eating cucumbers covered in sauce.

Interesting take on Greek Salad.  Good for a change.  But I'll stick with the home grown heritage variety tomatoes and forget the sun dried tomatoes.
Prefer pickling cucumbers, not seeded and perhaps a few anchovies for punch!

I used Persian cucumbers in this salad and it was excellent!  Everyone at the pot luck raved about it and wanted to know what was in the dressing.  They were surprised that except for the oil, this salad dresses itself.

This is a delicious recipe! While it is great just as is - I've also changed it up a bit to make it a full meal for my boyfriend and me. I added a bit of balsamic, some diced green bell peppers, and then lemon marinated grilled chicken (some lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, dijon mustard, pepper, salt - marinate about 40 minutes, then grill). Lastly, throw some warm pita bread on the side, and voilá great healthy and filling dinner!

This was excellent.  I'm unable to locate sun-dried tomatoes in my area so I subbed 1/3 cup sun-dried tomato pesto.  I tossed the vegetables together, then added lemon juice, tossed them again, drizzled olive oil, and tossed once again.  I used kalamata olives because I had them on hand.

Made this with a mediterranean pork loin and baklava.  Everyone loved the whole meal.  The salad was a good way to set the tone for dinner.

I was very happy with this recipe.  Simple, colorful and really zippy.  It would definitely benefit from marinating  longer.  I had leftovers, so I'm anxious to see what this salad tastes like after the extra marinating time. We love sun dried tomatoes so we added extra of those plus a little bit of olive oil.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a 3 1/2 salad. This was a good salad but...and I don't know what you could do to improve it. But I do say you need to slice the cucumbers in little rounds other than slice them long and I don't reccomend  adding any dressing or vinegar but you try what you like.

Perfect!  It made a large batch, so if you are not feeding a whole dinner party, you should modify the amounts as it needs to be eaten within 24 hours of putting together or the cucumbers won't survive.  By all means try this out!

I really love this type of salad and followed it very closely except I passed on the use of the tomato oil and added some simple greek dressing (just a bit)that I made right before serving. I also waited to add the feta until that point.  I would absolutely recommend seeding the cucumber and most of the seeds from the tomatoes or it will get too watery (from what I'd read in other reviews)  I did that and made it in the morning and served it around 5 pm and it wasn't very watery at all.    A few bits of advice, definitely use kalamata olives if you can; they're SO much better and different than black olives.  Also, this is a rather pricey salad. I spent around $17.00 on the ingredients, Feta, dried tomatoes and Kalamata Olives alone were around $12.00.     It was well worth it though, everyone raved and ate seconds and you get a nice sized bowl of salad.    Lastly, it doesn't look very pretty after a few hours of sitting out with dressing. Plan on eating most of it the same day; but only I have to look at the tiny bowl of leftovers tomorrow.  It will probably taste just as great.

A wonderful blend of flavors. I could not ask for a better salad. Even though I do not like cucumbers, I loved this.

Tasty, but maybe being a Greek Salad lover/purist I found that that the sundried tomatoes seemed a bit of a diversion/distraction...

Awesome! I only used 1 tablespoon of the oil since the salad was pretty wet from the tomatoes already. Didn't seem to need vinegar, but there's always next time!
