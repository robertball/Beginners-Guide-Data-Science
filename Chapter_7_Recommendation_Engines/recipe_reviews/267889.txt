This is actually a very clever and delicious recipe. I am quite surprised that I enjoyed it more than the usual store-bought beef jerky. Notes: -Cook at 200 degrees F -Truly aim for 1/4 inch thick otherwise they are more like chips and lose too much weight -Mine lost 66% mass (fresh to dried) but ideally it's better to be around 50% (again don't cut too thin)
