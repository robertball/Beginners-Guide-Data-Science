Mm-mmm!  As this recipe's  first reviewer I am eager to give it a two thumbs up! It looks as tho' it might have been around a good while, and what a shame it's been left unnoticed.  These cookies are rich and buttery, tender and light.  Just delicious, prepared in a heartbeat with just an unbelievable five ingredients.  The ingredients and measurements for them are reliably accurate; the instructions  simple, concise and well-written.  The submitter suggests pecan halves or jam as options (I particularly like the jam idea) but I wanted something fall-ish so I pressed the top of the dough balls in fall sprinkles  and then pressed a teeny mini peanut butter cup into each.  This cookie is appropriate for any season or occasion and there  are fun and limitless possibilities for decorations or toppers.

My new favorite cookie. The base is most like a moist amazing sugar cookie. I split my batch into 3 versions; 1st batch plain, 2nd I rolled the top of the flattened dough balls in sprinkles and the last batch I baked plain until the last 2 minutes when I added Hershey kisses (if you bake the entire time with the kisses the chocolate gets a burnt taste.

I was kind of nervous making something that had such few reviews but I am so happy that I did.  These cookies were amazing...they were the perfect amount of sweet and just yummy all around. The family loved it. I used jam in the center and they turned out amazing!

These truly are a Delicious cookie! I made these for my Christmas cookie trays this year instead of using pecans I used a Hershey kiss in the center! These will be made again!!

THESE ARE AWESOME WITHOUT LEMON TOO!!!  I didn't have anything lemon on hand so I just substituted vanilla extract for the lemon, and WOW!  It made wonderfully delicate and puffed up shortbread/sugar-esque cookies that had just the perfect amount of sweetness!

I also baked these at 350 for 9 minutes and let them cool on the cookie tray.

This is now a go-to recipe!!

Lovely, buttery cookie and so little effort is required to make these.  I also used Hershey Kisses in the center instead of pecans as I had some leftover in my fridge from Christmas.  I plan on making these again with jam.  I didn't follow the directions exactly as written...after beating in the egg yolks, I beat in the vanilla, then gradually stirred in the flour with a wooden spoon, as this is the method I am accustomed to when making cookies.
