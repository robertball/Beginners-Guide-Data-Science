Yummers!  Even hubby gave this 5* and he's not usually a fan of nuts in his dinner or of sweet side dishes.  I reserved some of the nuts and sprinkled them on top of the potatoes before the 2nd bake.  Soooo good!

My husband doesn’t care for sweet potatoes so I was surprised when he not only tried it, but ate the whole thing, and rated it “5 star”.   This was perfect for us, tasty and not too sweet.  I made it exactly as written and wouldn't make any adjustments.

I had to make some changes because I didn't have cream cheese or brown sugar; however, I did have marshmallows and a brown raw sugar.  And that worked out for me since I am watching my diet.  So I made those changes and the potatoes came out deliciously!  5 out of 5!

Hubby loved it. I didn’t use the skins just put it in a casserole dish and it was perfect.

These were good.  Next time, though I would add more brown sugar and some butter.  I didn't put the filling  back in the skins but served the filling in ramekins--much easier.
