I am glad I read the reviews on this recipe before making it, because it may have turned out rather bland otherwise.  I added 2 more cloves of garlic, tripled the amount of seasoning (except the salt), only used 1.5 cups of cheese (monterrey jack w/jalapenos is great), and added red bell peppers. I also substituted white rice with instant brown rice, and the veg oil for extra virgin olive oil.  Delicious!  I make this once every month or two and we never get tired of it.

This is a big hit with our family and for the company to whom we have served it.  I increase the rice to 1/2 cup and cook the rice with one chicken boullion cube; only use 1 tablespoon of the oil (and I use olive oil); I use 1/2 cup of regular chopped onion instead of 1 cup of green onion; I doubled the spices and only used 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar in the casserole and 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar on top.  GREAT recipe and a wonderful way to use the vegetables from my garden.  You won't be disappointed!

My entire family loved this meal (and I have very picky eaters)!  I added 3 pounds cooked shrimp to it.  It made a meal rather than a side dish.  Add bread & a salad and you have an excellent meal.

This is a great idea, and a delicious way to serve vegetables. With a few alterations, this recipe is wonderful. To make the rice more flavorful, add vegetable stock and about a teaspoon of garlic salt instead of water while making your rice...it adds so much flavor. Then, I broil the zucchini and red onion in a broiling pan with a thin coating of olive oil and a seasoning rub including about a 2 teaspoons of each seasoning: garlic powder, cumin, pepper, oregano, and then I salt to taste. This takes about 10-15 minutes (or until they are lightly browned). I can't tell you how much flavor this adds to your vegetables (without adding all the fat that would get absorbed from frying them in a skillet). 

Then I just add the broiled vegtables to my cassarole dish that has the rice spread in the bottom. I mix the rice and veggies so that the seasonings are mixed into the rice. Then, simply top with the amount of cheese you want, pop back in the oven for 10 minutes at 350 degrees and dinner is served. This may sound like a bit more work, but trust me...its worth the effort.

My husband doesn't believe in dinner without meat, but when he tasted this dish, he exclaimed over it for no less than half an hour!  I'm on Weight Watchers, and each serving was only six points!  Add a bread stick or two and you have a low-point, complete meal!

Fabulous recipe!  Did as previous reviewers suggested:  tripled seasonings (except salt), added 1 more garlic clove and a few shakes of garlic powder, upped rice to 1/2 cup (used brown rice), added 1/2 of a red pepper, chopped.  Also added 1 chopped up jalepeno brat, which I cooked with the zucchini & onions.  Used sharp cheddar cheese.  Family LOVED it!  Will definitely make again.

Even after cooking the rice in chicken broth and the vegetables in olive oil, even after using fresh herbs rather than dried, this was still "eh"--boring.  And oh, the sharp cheddar cheese just took a fresh taste and made it almost sharp and sour--would have been better without any of it. There were LOTS of leftovers, both on the dinner plates as well as the casserole dish.

Wow!  I was quite surprised by this recipe!  And I don't even like zucchini!  I served as a side dish with chicken.  I doubled the rice and spices and cut the cheese in half.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable.  Definately a keeper!!

Cheese + veggies == YUM!  I made wild rice instead of white, which gave it a nice chewiness.  I used red onion instead of green, 3 cloves of roasted garlic instead of one raw, 1 can of tomatoes instead of fresh, and 1.75 cups of a bistro mozzarella cheese blend instead of cheddar.  Lots of changes, but tasty none-the-less.  I used a spanish sweet paprika which really made the dish.

This is a good recipe overall.  My husband liked it.  The only change I made was the amount of cheese.  I used between 1 and 1.5 cups and that was plenty.

Absolutely excellent! I took the opportunity with this recipe to add lots of veggies! In additon to what's called for, I added mushrooms, lots of fresh spinich, and red pepper. I cooked the rice in fat free/low sodium chicken broth, added chicken, and used 1 cup of rice instead of 1/3. I will most certainly be making this again. Maybe next time I will add cabbage, broccli, or green pepper! I felt a little bad about all the cheese! I didn't use as much as it called for, but I try to keep things low in fat. Next time I will use less. Great recipe!

OMG! I think this is soooo good! I couldnt stop eating it so I finally had to put it away :-)  I'm a firm believer of trying the recipe "as is" first, then I'll try again and tweak it if necessary. The 2nd time I made this I tweaked it a bit. I tripled the spices except the oregano and added about a 1/2 tsp. of chicken bouillon. I also increased the rice to 1/2 cup which I boiled in 1 cup of water. I have a lot of squash coming out of the garden so I plan on making this often. Adding chicken and/or shrimp would be delicious. Cant wait until next time to make this =)

I don't remember if I've reviewed this or not, but it was wonderful.  My husband will actually eat zucchini, if it's served to him in this dish.  I have changed a couple of things:  I make brown rice, and I make more of it (2 to 3 cups cooked) so I can make this a vegetarian main dish, and I use less cheese, so it's not quite so fattening.  Seasoning is perfect as it stands.

Loved this!  It was such a good starting point for the absolutely most heavenly casserole!  I grated my zucchini since my kids hate zucchini, added chopped broccoli seasoned just like listed here, only adding thyme.  When I cooked the rice I added a hint of turmeric for color and chicken bouillon cube for flavor.  I mixed it all together and added sour cream for creaminess, also grated Parmesan cheese (fresh) and mixed it together topping with cheddar cheese and baked it in the oven.  Absolutely amazing!  :)

To add to my below review:  I used the exact amount of spice as called for and neither my husband nor I thought it was bland. Very good. I used mozzarella instead of cheddar to lower the fat content.  Next time I'll add mushrooms.  This is mostly veggies with just a little rice.  Very healthy!

Before I turned my head, both my kids gobbled up their first servings!  It was a bit too salty for me, so I'll decrease the garlic salt next time.  I was looking for a veggie dish, so I eliminated the rice and baked only 10 minutes instead of twenty.  I did make some minor changes that I don't really feel affects my rating of this recipe:  Used both zucchini and yellow summer squash, eyeballed ingredients to probably double the amount called for, used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh chopped, and unintentionally used about half a cup less cheese.  I'm not kidding, my kids loved this!!  I'm making this for a "pot-luck" family Christmas dinner next weekend, it was so good.
Edit: This went over great at the Christmas dinner.  The weather was so bad, about a third of the expected guests didn't show up and it still was almost completely gone by the end of the night!

Very flavorful and really quick to prepare.  I sauteed the zucchini just 3 minutes to insure that it would not come out of the oven soft.  I used instant brown rice - and I added it right out of the box just before putting the dish into the oven (equal rice and water but I should have cut the water bc it was a bit watery when I took it out of the oven).  I also used red onion instead of green and a lot less cheddar - just a mild sprinkling on top.

Wonderful filling vegetarian meal. My husband thought it was great. My son said it reminded him of pizza. I added 1 cup of rice and substituted a can of diced Italian tomatoes instead of fresh. The amount of cheese was good. Could do less if you are worried about fat content.

This was great!  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that I did use the suggestions from other reviewers to add extra spices.  I also saved time by just combining all of the raw vegetables, spices, a drizzle of olive oil, 1/2 cup cheese, and cooked rice.  Spread into the casserole dish, then top with another 1/2 cup of cheese.  Bake at 350 for 25 minutes, and the vegetables are perfectly done crisp-tender (just the way we like them).  Thanks for the recipe!

Really enjoyed this.  I liked the rice in it, that was a nice addition.  I added a minced jalapeno and used peper jack cheese to spice it up a bit.  I added all the cheese at once by mistake, but it tit was fine like that too.  Will definitely make again, thanks!

This was a pretty good side dish. I thought it needed a little more rice, so I upped it to 3/4 c. I used EVOO instead of veggie oil, and increased the spices by 1/4-1/2 tea each. Other than that it was a good dish!

I thought this was really good.  I'm trying to incorporate more veggies and less meat in my diet, so I served this as a main dish.  I added mushrooms, subbed sweet onion for the green onion, seasoned to taste and then followed the directions as written after that.  It was yummy!  Won't hesitate to make this again.

Thank you! Thank You Reviewers for suggesting increasing the seasonings (except the salt) and decreasing the cheese to 1 ½ cups (instead of 2 cups). I never used green onions before so when I began cutting them up, I noticed that I did not have a full cup so I cut ½ of a yellow onion to fulfill the 1 cup requirement—I was nervous at first, but I wasted my nervousness because the dish came out to be absolutely delicious! And Guess What? Even my 5-year old 'picky eater' daughter ate it and asked for seconds! Oh and I increased the rice to 1/2 cup as suggested. I can see how 1/3 cup (as the recipe stated) would not be quite enough. Thanks for sharing this recipe! TERRIFIC!

Pretty good!  I couln't get my little ones to eat the zucchini still, but I felt very good about serving this meal to my family.  You get your veggies, dairy, grains all in one simple casserole!  Easy and Flavorful.  My husband and I liked it pretty well.  Something different to do with all that zucchini!

Great recipe as an entree, although I can see how it would be a good side dish too. I doubled the recipe so it would like a few days, and it was gone within 48 hours. The changes I made (other than doubling it) was to use brown rice, which I cooked in low sodium chicken broth. I also used the cheese I had on hand, which was mainly mixed Italian. And I tossed in a whole lot more oregano, rosemary, and thyme. I also used canned tomatoes. Wonderful dish. Will make it again!

I would add more rice next time. I didn't have green onions, so I used red. It was pretty tasty!

Opps, I cooked a cup and a half of rice with this.  Because I put in a can of diced tomatoes it turned out great still.  Mushrooms were a nice addition too.  We ate nearly the whole casserole, my husband and I and two toddlers.

Very good.  I don't see how this serves 6.... I would say maybe 4, if used as a side dish with other side dishes.  I didn't have tomatoes.. so, I used a small amount of spaghetti sauce.

I was hopeful that after reading all of the changes and tweaking the recipe to my taste, that I would like what I got.  LOVED it!  Here's what I did:
After cooking the veggies until soft, I cranked up the heat and gave them some browned edges to bring out some flavor.
Doubled the seasonings, but only added basil to prevent a "pizza"taste.
Reduced the cheese to about 1 cup mixed in and 1/2 cup on top.
Subbed the tomatoes with a drained canned of Rotel (okay, so it was actually a home canned jar of tomato relish with home grown tomatoes, onions, banana peppers and bell peppers :) but Rotel would work)
I used 2 cups of water to 1 cup of rice, but I eyeballed it until I liked the ratio of rice to veggies.
I skipped the paprika, but could have sprinkled it on top of the cheese.

All in all, I wish I had more zucchini to make it again!

We LOVE this dish! We double the recipe every time we make it so we have lots of leftovers. I also double the rice (add a chicken bullion cube), use 3 garlic cloves and double the other spices (except garlic salt). I use 4.5 cups of chopped zucchini and 2 cups of cheese (we love cheese). The fresh tomatoes are the best part and it smells amazing. Your friends will want this recipe!!

This was excellent though I made several changes.  I grated 1 1/2 cups of equal parts parmesan, pepper jack and cheddar cheese.  I used garden tomatoes mixed wiht canned stewed tomatoes to make up the 1 1/2 cups tomatoes.  I bumped up the garlic to 3 cloves, 3 T fresh basil, 3 T fresh parsley. I added 1/2 can french fried onions to the mix and the other half on top of casserole the last 5 min of cooking.  With these changes, this recipe was superb!

This was a big hit with me and my younger daughter. I like the freshness of the vegetables, especially the zucchini when it's not cooked too long. I did not measure the seasoning, just added as much as I thought it needed. Thanks!

I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the spices. I also added crushed tomatoes instead of the chopped (personal preference). I topped it with a ton of cheese, and the kiddos really gobbled it up!

very good. the addition of a lot of mushrooms, nearly a whole package, made this dish. fresh tomatoes were vital. and i nearly trippled all of the spices. so my only neg. is that there should be a spice adjustment. it doesn't look like it is going to fit in the 1.5 quart dish but it does!

This was good - not great. It was very bland and needed a lot of extra seasoning, in my opinion. Next time I will cook the rice in broth and just go with my instinct for seasoning, like I should have today. Good starter recipe, tho. Thanks!

What a great side dish. Took this to a pot luck and people gobbled it up, I kept hearing who made this? What's in it? Send me the recipe!  My family  loved it also.  Before I made it I looked at a lot of the other reviews and I took their advice - more garlic, more spices & added diced red bell pepper. This one is keeper!

Delicious! I did make a few tweaks. I increased the amount of rice (approx. 3-4 cups cooked & made with vegetable stock), added frozen corn, black beans (8 oz, rinsed & drained), and 1/2 of minced jalapeño for just a little kick.  I also doubled the amount of spices and garlic as others suggested.  My carnivore husband loved it as well.

Mmmm...fabulous!  Could eat the entire dish.  I used wild rice and didn't have paprika.  I'll make this again, for sure.
Update:  I love this recipe!  I don't feel a need to bake it in the oven, though, as long as everything is cooked tender enough in the skillet.

So, I modified this quite a bit based on what I had on hand - about 2 or 3 cups of leftover quinoa in place of the rice, a red pepper (added to zucchini), shallots instead of green onions, fresh basil in place of dried.  I had no garlic salt - just powder.  Based on earlier reviews, I doubled the spices, and used teaspoon of garlic powder and scant teaspoon of salt (I was essentially doubling the recipe).  I also used Daiya vegan cheddar as well.  My husband, who is not a fan of zucchini, even loved this!   I did use the cuisinart so the zucchini was finely chopped - maybe that helped.  Will make this again for sure!

This is delicious! I used extra spice, and subbed mozzarella cheese (will use cheddar next time, it was a little stringy like pizza from the melted mozz.) Used extra tomatoes, and 1/2 c. rice. I love this, and next time will use more rice, it's a very good vegetarian meal. As so many others have noted, you could use many more veggies if you like & have on hand. Really fresh tasting, and the zucchini didn't get soggy as I expected it to. Thanks for a keeper.

I made this exactly as written and it's perfect. Even my meat eater husband likes it. It's inexpensive, relatively quick and very easy. I've tried other all vegetable casseroles and they always seem to lack that depth of flavour. This recipe has plenty of flavor. It's become a staple in our home. I make it at least once, if not twice a month and it's always received compliments c

The first time I made it I sauteed zucchini, white onion, mushrooms, and fresh garlic until just barely tender. I hate mushy zucchini. I didn't have fresh tomatoes (not in season yet) but I had some sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil so I threw those in. I added lots of italian seasoning, some red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Added in the rice and an italian cheeses blend and baked it. It was heavenly! Amazing! Could have used more tomatoes though. My daughter wouldn't touch it and my husband wasn't home to eat it and let me tell you, that did not disappoint me at all! It re-heated well the next day for lunch too. The second time I made it I had no sundried tomatoes or fresh tomatoes but I did have a can of those fire roasted tomatoes. So I threw those in while mixing in the rice. Blech! I wish I had just left them out! It turned everything into a mushy mess and this time nobody wanted to touch it. I haven't tired it with any cheese other than italian cheeses and I don't care to. I just think any other cheese, especially cheddar, would over power the other flavors.

I really liked this.  Next time I might add a little less garlic salt and substitute with some garlic powder as it tasted a little too salty.  And I might add a little more rice.  Good flavor.

This was delicious and the herbs made my house smell great.  Even my vegetable loathing husband enjoyed it.  I substituted yellow squash for the zucchini because the market was out of the latter.  Next time I will use the zucchini and it will probably be even better.

Very good and tasty. made it for tahnksgiving as a test and it went over well (although it's not really a normal thanksgiiving item). I used brown rice instead since that's all I had and shredded sharp cheddar. really good. Would be even better in summer with garden zucchini and tomatoes.

I really liked this recipe. As written, it didn't have enough seasoning for me (hence the 4 stars), but a few more shakes of my favorite seasonings quickly solved that problem. I also added some red bell peppers to the mix since I needed to use them up before they went bad and the whole thing came out very well. I will make this again and would recommend this easy casserole to anyone.

This was delish!!! I gave it 4 stars because I used brown rice, and had to double the amount of rice used. Next time I am going to add corn, black beans, and some spinach. (Something that I add to almost everything!) My family loved it and I was hoping for leftovers, but there weren't any!

I made this recipe following the other reviewer's suggestions -- increased the spices, increased the rice, substituted brown rice to make it healthier, and tossed in a bell pepper for fun.  Neither my husband nor I liked this recipe, and while we were eating it we both thought something was "off".  We finally decided that the problem is the cheese -- the cheese just did not taste right with this particular mix of spices.  If I make this recipe again, it will be with major modifications -- omit the cheese or use different spices.  I suspect that it's the paprika that tastes particularly off with the cheese but I'm not sure.

Was looking for recipes that use zucchini and tomatoes since my garden has an abundance and this caught my eye. I figured it can't be too bad with all that cheese. I read the reviews and agreed it seemed pretty bland. I used olive oil to fry the veggies, fresh herbs from the garden and chopped, another clove of garlic, and a half of a jalapeño pepper. I also substituted half of the cheddar with smoked cheddar. The cooking time was spot on and the zucchini came out crisp tender. After all the changes I'd give it 3.5 stars and probably would not make again.

I took the advice of other reviews and tripled the seasoning quantities - it turned out great! Other changes I made: I added 1 diced red bell pepper, 2 parboiled potatoes (cubed), and about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of cooked and seasoned ground beef. Also used 1 cup of grated mozzarella instead of the cheddar. 

Hahaha, so I guess I made quite a few changes. But it was delicious nonetheless. Good "base" recipe!

Yum!  I didn't find this bland at all, just tasty as written.  I used what I had - which was left over chinese takeout brown rice, a can of petite dice tomatoes with the liquid mostly drained off and I didn't use as much green onion (but I did use the green and white part of my green onions).  Made for a nice, warm veggie-filled lunch.  This is definitley in my bring to work lunch rotation!

This has some really good flavors and is a great base recipe. I added way more flavor by multiplying the garlic significantly, as well as a lot of fresh chopped basil. I also added shrimp, but it would be good with chicken as well. Also, double the rice.

Pretty good, although I did change up the seasoning quite a bit. I used garlic, cumin, Trader Joe's Everyday seasoning, and about 1/4 cup black bean and corn salsa. Pepperjack cheese instead of Cheddar. Gave it a southwest flavor.

Wow! I didn't know a casserole could be this good and healthy! I was very impressed that the amount of rice was less than the veggies. I used fresh herbs (just doubled the amount) and only 1 cup of cheese. I believe it was cheesy enough with just one.

This was FANTASTIC!!!

If you are short on time, you might be able to skip the baking part, but I wouldn't put the extra cup of cheese on the top.  I tasted it before putting it in the oven and it was great.

I loved the idea of this and the texture of the rice (used brown), with the fresh tomatoes and zucchini, but the flavor was a little off for me (too much oregano and not much else). But it's a great side dish.

Delicious!  I would note however that the original recipe will not make 6 main dish servings.  I upped the rice to a cup to make this stretch further, doubled the seasonings to compensate, and left the vegetables at the original measurement.  It made about 4 adult servings.   There were plenty of vegetables and my husband loved it.  I do recommend adding chicken bouillon to the rice for a bit of extra flavoring.

Excellent! I made this with not quite the amount stated of the green onions (probably 1/8 cup vs. 1 cup stated in the recipe) because it was all I had, but the combination of all the flavors was awesome. I did double the rice and added about 1/2 cup extra cheese because I wanted to make sure we had leftovers. Added some extra garlic too, per our taste. I think you could probably serve this directly from the skillet as I plan on trying next time (to save time). Even my picky eaters who don't care for tomatoes and who usually balk at zucchini gobbled this up. Will definitely add this to our recipe rotation and look forward to making this again soon... Thank you for this great, easy recipe!

I followed the advice of all other reviewers (tripled spices and garlic save for salt) and added one shredded, cooked, chicken breast to casserole. Take our one full tbsp of oil and a cup of sharp cheddar, and you will find yourself a healthy, nutritious meal! Will def make again, with the same modifications.

This was good, but it needed some meat, IMHO.  Maybe great for a vegetarian, but we were left wanting something more.

Double the spices (except the salt). Make double the rice. Use cheese to your taste. Add an extra clove of garlic. (following others suggestions) I used about 2 cups of zucchini, 3/4 cup of green onion, 1/2 cup tomato, 1/2 cup red bell pepper and it came out delicious. To further cut calories I used a reduced fat cheddar.

This is an amazing way to get the family to eat veggies!!! Make sure to double all spices except paprika.

Very good.  added additional veggies -- red peppers, mushrooms -- and followed others' suggestions.  only 1 c of cheese mixed in, none on top.  1/2 c of brown rice, but it could have used even more.

Colorful, but lacking in taste. Vegetarian friend liked it. I roasted the veggies before assembling to intensify flavor.

This is a phenomenal recipe! I followed the posted advice and tripled the fresh garlic, herbs and spices (except for the garlic salt). I also added an extra cup of rice and used brown rice. I found I didn't need the full two cups of cheese -- it's a lot of work chopping up everything but well worth the effort!

My whole family liked this, including my 14 month old son! Per some reviews, I upped the rice to 1/2 cup and cooked it in chicken broth. I decided not to add tomatoes because I know how that flavor tends to take over. Instead I splashed some extra chicken broth in the dish before putting in the oven to make up for the tomato juice. Upped the spices (except salt) and used less cheese---it's really not necessary. Excellent!

This dish is fantastic and we loved it!  I also made some changes after reading the reviews which are VERY helpful.  I used one cup of Brown Minute Rice; red onion because that's what I had on hand; doubled all the spices and used 2 cups of extra sharp cheddar cheese.  It was fantastic and THE best way to use all the zucchini and tomatoes coming in from the garden.  I'll be making this again for certain!!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Would agree that you should double the spices (except the garlic salt), increase the rice to 3/4 cup, and decrease the cheese to 1.5 cups.  Baked it in a 9x9 pan and for 10 minutes.  Great taste.

I'm constantly on the look-out for vegetarian dinner options, and this is definitely entering our rotation.  (We ate it as an entree, and it served 2 with enough leftovers for someone's lunch.)  Some notes: I doubled the herbs (not the salt!), and I used 1/2 c. rice + 1 c. water. It took me 10 minutes to get all the zucchini cooked - even in my 14-inch skillet.  And I baked everything in an 8x8 square baking dish.

This is a really easy dinner. I followed the advise of others and doubled the herbs and spices. I also added a but more rice and fresh corn and cauliflour. Turned out great. My husband suggested crushed pepper flakes in the next batch. Two year old loves it, too.

Very tasty recipe. The only strange thing I noticed is that the recipe calls for fresh garlic and then garlic salt. In fear that I would overpower my husband with my killer breath, I opted for only the fresh garlic and then used about 1 tsp. of salt. THe skillet I satued the vegetables in was oven proof so I just popped it in the oven--one less dirty dish to wash. Very easy to make.

Fabulous!  Like others suggested, though, I tripled the spices (other than the salt) and used lots of extra garlic.  I also added red pepper and mushrooms.  I might try it with a different kind of cheese next time - but there will definitely be a "next time".

A tasty, meatless main course.  My husband & I liked it, & I'll be making it again.  I upped the amount of rice to 1 cup; otherwise, I think the vegetables would have overpowered the rice & made it more like a side dish & less like a main dish.  I couldn't find sweet paprika in the grocery store, so I used regular paprika, & it turned out fine.  Finally, I substituted reduced fat cheese for the full fat version.  I agree w/ the reviewer, though, who said the amount of cheese could be reduced to 1 1/2 cups.

Excellent!!! Looked just like the pictures and was fairly easy to make.  Smelled so good while cooking I had to try.  It was great even before the rice and cheese.  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Wow, this turned out so awesome.  I changed a lot of the ingredients after reading the reviews.  I used 2 teaspoons of fresh basil and oregano from the garden, 1/2 cup of basamati rice that I cooked in chicken broth, 1 teaspoon of paprika, 1T of olive oil, 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion, 3 cloves of garlic and 1 cup of sharp cheddar.  The tomatos and zuccini I left the same.  I also added 2 spicy brats that I cut up, sauted, and threw in with everthing else and boy was this an amazing meal.  I will definately be making this often!  Would also be good served with salmon.

Very good!  My husband really enjoyed this casserole and told me to make sure I had the recipe saved.  I did use basil instead of oregano by mistake so then I used mozzerella for the cheese mixed in to help offset the basil a little. Then topped with some colby-jack with italian bread crumbs.  Had red pepper on hand so added it too.  I prepped the casserole in early afternoon and stored in fridge until time to cook for dinner.  Very convenient!

Well I didn't read the reviews until after I put it in the oven so I was a bit worried.  I wasn't sorry though in the end.  It turned out good.  I did add some bread crumbs on the top and browned them at the end.  I used shredded Mexican cheese.  When I was putting in the seasoning, it seemed like a lot, so I reduced it.  I may have not used as much zucchini as the recipe called for which might be why it turned out ok. The kids didn't like it but everyone else did.  I would make it again.

This dish hit the spot on a warm summer night!  I used red onions (what I had on hand), doubled garlic (love the taste of fresh garlic), added mushrooms 
and followed advice of other posters to increase herb seasonings (doubled all except for garlic salt). Also mixed 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese with parmasean. Great way to use in-season veggies and makes for an easy casserole.  Will definitely make again.

This was fantastic!  I didn't even bake it in the oven and it was still creamy and tender.  One thing that added to it was a few sprinkles of feta cheese before serving.  I can't wait to make it again!

Wonderful recipe, and very flexible on the ingredients. I usually make this when I have vegetables in the fridge that are approaching their best by date.  I have tried it with sweet potatoes, corn, black beans, mushrooms, etc. and it has always turned out great.

I liked this a lot.  Great way to use up some more of the prolific autumn harvest of zucchini.  I used olive oil; increased basil, oregano to 1.5tsp, used 3 cloves fresh garlic; used 2tsp garlic powder, 3/4tsp garlic salt; used 1c cheese in veg mixture & 1/2c cheese for topping. Used 1c quartered cherry & grape tomatoes; tomatoes lent a very nice flavor to dish.  Used brown jasmine rice; would increase amount of rice to 1/2c next time.  Thanks, DebiMcG!

Very good but not "great". Upped the rice to 3/4c. and added some chopped brocolli. Also, used canned tomatoes with italian seasonings. I will probably make this again, and might even try it with the addition of ground turkey breast.

I took this to a "Hootenany" party and everyone ate it up! I was hoping to have leftovers for myself but NO WAY! I doubled this recipe in order to have enough. People were using it as a dip too by putting it on tortilla chips. I was THRILLED!!!

Loved this recipe. I made a couple of adjustments: (1) Instead of using long-grain rice, I made 1 cup of Minute Rice, using the water/butter/salt as listed on the box. (2) Cooked recipe on top of the stove, instead of putting it in the oven. The dish was ready in about 15 minutes! It was so hot here yesterday, I didn't want to heat up the kitchen too.

Delicious - best zucchini casserole recipe I've ever tasted. Family loved it also. I particularly liked the fact that the squash is cubed, rather than sliced. When cooked, the squash retains its texture better and doesn't get mushy. I also used Vidalia onion instead of green onion.

This side dish is divine! It came together easy and quick, tastes so much better than I thought it would, and even the kids gobbled it up! It has a delicious flavour and is so hearty, it was the only side dish I needed. I made it with the "Broiled Tilapia Parmesan" from this site, and my 5 and 7 yr old asked for seconds of everything. I didn't change a thing... seasoned exactly as the recipe states. We loved it! It will be made over and over again in this house. Thanks for sharing, Debi!

This one was a surprise.  Just looking at the ingredients, I was sort of lukewarm about it, but my husband wanted to try it.  It was absolutely delicious.  We will deffinitely be using it again

Pretty boring... really just tastes like zucchini mixed with rice & tomatoes, and I even doubled up on the herbs. I did lighten up on the cheese as suggested by some readers - two cups just seems too much (too fattening!), perhaps this made the difference - but with loads of cheese anything will taste good!! It tasted better as leftovers the next day. I'm sorry, but I just can't rate this up there with everyone else.

Really enjoyed this one; it's hard to find something new and different to do with zucchini.  Fiancee really liked it, too.    Only changes I made were adding more garlic, cuz we're garlic nuts, and some chopped onion for a bit more flavor.  Thanks!

I used one pound of zucchini and one pound of mushrooms. I added a little pepper too. It was very tasty. I made the rice in my Insty Pot.

This is a great recipe! I've made it 3 times so far in the past month (have lots of zucchini). Followed the recipe exactly the first time and got rave reviews....added chicken sausage the last two times and received even more praise. I highly recommend this recipe - can't say enough about it.

This was a good, easy casserole for a week night. The simple changes I made first started with following other reviewers by doubling the spices and garlic and upping the rice to 1/2 cup. (Although I used quinoa in place of rice to cut down on time.) Added a couple small sweet peppers to saute. I only had dried basil too. Added some dry mustard and 1/2 teaspoon dill weed. Used olive oil instead too. Then to make this vegan, I mixed in 2 heaping tablespoons of vegan mayo just before putting in the oven to try and make it creamy. Sprinkled bread crumbs over the top and cooked only for 15 minutes. Delish!

Great dish!  I did up the garlic & herbs...oh and a good grind of medium to coarse black pepper...always check the salt & pepper with tomatoes.  I mixed the cheese for the top with italian seasoned panko crumbs for a toasted, crispy, cheesy crunchy top

I followed fellow cooks' advice and doubled the spices.  This was a  tasty and filling recipe.  My only complaint is that the cheese was somewhat clumpy due to the high moisture content of the dish.  Perhaps I should have cooked it longer?  Not sure.

This was pretty good; I left out the garlic and tomato, used a cup of 5-min rice and three zucchinis, used red onion instead of green, eyeballed the spices and added a bit of some chipotle-garlic seasoning that was sitting around. The thing I don't care for is how the cheese congeals over the top; I'll try it again and mix all the cheese with the rest of the bake.

I like to add a lot of veggies to my meal so I added a half cup of snow peas, half cup of fresh green beans, I also mixed squash into it, 1/4 cup of finely chopped kale/spinach/ chard mix, 1/4 cup shredded carrots, and a half a jar of corn mixed in to the casserole. I also doubled the spices and added parsley and thyme. I added a mix of cheeses such as mozzarella, four cheese Italian and a hint of parmesan.

Triple the garlic (I used a few cloves) and double all the spices. It was amazing! Holds up well for a potluck as it tastes good even when only lukewarm. I will be adding this recipe to my regular cooking ... Easy, healthy and delicious.

I used about 1/2 cup - 3/4 cup salsa instead of just tomatoes, it added a lot of great flavour. I also sprinkled a bit of Panko bread crumbs on top before putting in the oven which gave it a little crispy texture.  And doubled the amount of paprika.

I thought it was a good basic recipe, but the cheddar didn't sit right with me given the choice of spices.  I will make it again, but next time, I will either go Mexican-style and add onion and poblano peppers, with cumin, chili pepper and cilantro instead of paprika and basil; or go Italian-style and maybe add mushrooms, switch the cheese to parmigianno regianno on the inside with slices of mozzerella on the top, omitting paprika and doubling the garlic and basil.  Yes, I know, these would be new recipes...

5 things to make this a better recipe and yes I will be making it again and am hoping it will 5 stars. As this was definately a trial run for me as a somewhat beginner cook. 1. Don't use all that cheese(I used Vegan Cheese). 2. Triple the herbs it calls for. 3. Do not add extra rice. 4. Don't be afraid to add other spices if that's your thing(I added Crushed Red Pepper). 5. Add something crunchy on the top when you bake it.
Until next time :)

Made this cause we were heading out of town and I needed to use up a bunch of veggies in my frig.  It was delish!  Even my husband, who refers to himself as a carnivore, loved it.  I didn't have enough zucchini so I added some carrots, used red onion cause I only had 1 green onion, added extra garlic and used white cheddar and it came out amazing.  The baking dish I used was too big so unless you double it, use a small (8 by 8) pan.  I served it with salmon and it was an amazing meal.

Delicious serving option for zucchini!  My husband doesn't care for super cheesy food and it was super easy to accommodate that by adding less cheese on top to half of the casserole.  Even the kids enjoyed this.  Can't wait to make it again.

Was very tasty. I even held the cheese because of a dairy allergy in the family and it was fine to add to individual bowls.

This dish is so easy and so yummy!  I tweaked it t a little and added more garlic and rice.  I think next time maybe some mushrooms or black beans and diced green chilis.  It is a simple recipe and you can add whatever you like and it is just simply delicious.

This was a really good dish.  I made a few adjustments based on what I had on hand.  I used zucchini and yellow squash, added a large diced mushroom, and used canned tomatoes (didn't have fresh on hand).  I used 2 cloves of garlic and omitted the garlic salt.  Finally, I did not have dried basil so I used Italian season blend.  Because it is just Hubby and me, I used my small casserole (1 qt. size) and there was enough left over to put into his lunch tomorrow.  I plan to add this into my rotation of sides.  Next time,  I want to make this with added cooked sausage and use feta and mozzarella.  Many thanks for a delicious recpe that can be altered so many ways!

I followed the suggestions of various reviewers  adding extra spices and rice and I absolutely loved this recipe.  Next time I will try it with cooked shrimp for a whole meal. I think the combination would be even better than as is.

This casserole was really easy to make. My husband loved it too! I will say I have to agree with some of the other reviews though, it was a little lacking in flavor. I even added extra garlic, but it was still a bit bland. My husband thought it was perfect with some Lawry's seasoned salt sprinkled over the top, so I'm glad he was pleased because he hates tomatoes and even complimented the zucchini. Overall it was a pretty big win at our house. I'd make it again.

Made this with red quinoa instead of rice for more protein.  Did not add onions as we cannot eat them, though we love them.  I took other's suggestion on the amount of herbs and doubled them, adding more garlic as well.  Since I had some fresh asparagus leftover, I added that along with red pepper to the zucchini as other also stated.  Mixed in Parmesan cheese with the cheddar cheese.  Did not have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used our home canned ones from last summer and it worked very well.  VERY yummy.  Had as a meatless meal and was very satisfying.  My hubby is a meat and potatoes kind of guy but really enjoyed this a lot!

Tripled the seasoning as other reviewers suggested and added a few more veggies because I omitted the tomato.  It tasted just "ok" when it came out of the oven.  This is more of a side dish than it is a main dish.  Will not be making again.

Very good, easy and healthy
Used the cheddar cheese only on the top of the casserole (1/2 cup= less calories).  Excellent combination of flavors

SOOO good (after adding more seasoning)! Followed recipe to a tee but took another reviewer's advice and added Creole seasoning after I discovered it was a little bland. Absolutely delicious with Creole seasoning! Even my meat eater hubby liked it. A good base recipe, I make it regularly but usually add seasonal veggies. Good with red bell pepper and diced yellow squash too!

10 24 13 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/74077/zucchini-herb-casserole/ ... I kinda streamlined the recipe.  Diced the squash into half inch pieces & put it in the same pot on top of the chicken broth & uncooked rice.  'Done in 20.  :)  I had 2c homemade chicken broth so I used 1c uncooked rice.  Put half cup chopped onion & the garlic in there, too - actually the onion first - to be sure it was cooked - then the squash & garlic.  I subbed diced tomatoes & not until then did I remember that I'm not so big on rice with tomatoes, fresh or not.  'Tried it before the tomatoes (after adding double the spices) & it was pretty good just like that.  If I try again, might go for buttered bread cubes on top & skip the cheese & tomatoes.  'Definately a recipe worth playing with!  :D  The 1c uncooked rice makes 3c so, although I did enjoy it, it was more rice-y than squash-y.  'Would reduce to 1/2 - 3/4c uncooked.  I know I increased the rice, but I think a better name for this would be Squash-Rice Casserole since it isn't very herb-y, just has herbs added - & yellow or zucchini can be used in it.  I used both - three total, fyi, is about 1 1/2#.  :)

This is awesome!  I had to tweak it a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients and there's a tomato hater in the house, added spinach instead.  Cooked the veggies in some Mascato wine.  Had to use Parmesan no more cheddar in the house after the Cheddar Cauliflower Soup was made.  I'm thinking mushrooms would be a nice addition to this and maybe I'll try wild rice instead of white next time.  GOOD STUFF!!!

I strongly suggest seasoning to your own taste in so far as amounts are concerned.  ;)

I love zucchini so thought this one would be a 'sure to please" recipe, BUT was very disappointed. if I ever cook again I would double the rice amount, use less tomatoes' and definitely turn up the volume on seasoning. it was very bland

This sounds delicious, however, I used Quinoa (instead of plain white rice, which has no nutritional value) and beefed up the spices and reduced the cheese to make it more WW friendly.

Wow was this a nice casserole! Recipe "as is" is probably just a 3 or 4 but I took other reviewers advice and added a ton more seasoning (hot sauce, about triple the crushed garlic, and extra basil). I also added more rice as was suggested. Very delicious, I would make it again!

This is an awesome side dish. I use olive oil instead of veg oil, increase the amount of seasoning, and only about 1 cup of cheese mixed in (no cheese on top). Delicious!

This has become a family favorite! I double the basil, sweet paprika and oregano and decrease the amount of sharp cheddar cheese to 1 Cup. I've also substituted yellow squash for half of the zucchini and that turned out just as good. It's a delicious, beautiful and healthy dish. Thanks for sharing!

As suggested, I used 2 garlic cloves instead of 1 and only used about a cup of cheese instead of 2 cups. Eyeballed the spices, but was generous and added cayenne pepper. I should have increased the rice to 1/2 cup as recommended in some other reviews. I also added red bell pepper. Served this with sauteed chicken. Overall, I enjoyed the dish and I would make it again.

LOVE this recipe!  I added mushrooms for my husband, but only because he loves them.  This recipe is just so good that I am making it again this coming week!  My husband has always been a big meat-eater, but he loved this veggie recipe just as well!  This recipe could easily be altered by adding beef or chicken, but it is just so good the way it is.  Try it..you'll love it!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I followed the advice of another reviewer and doubled the spices and added pepper jack instead of cheddar.  My other changes were instead of using fresh tomatoes (expensive) I just added a can of diced (juice and all), and I left out the rice (I made my own white sticky rice on the side to pour over)

followed others advise, doubled (maybe tripled) spices. Kept cheese the same, only did about 3/4 cup of the chopped tomatoes, used regular onion cause thats what I had, little extra rice that I cooked in chicken boul., and I also added part of a red pepper when frying onion and zuc. This is YUMMY! I hope no one else wants any!! ;-)

After reading the other reviews, I cooked the rice in broth, added more herbs and garlic and cut back on the cheese.  I used a combination of yellow and green squash and a jalapeno pepper.  It was pretty and would make an ok side dish but I served this as a main vegetarian dish and was disappointed.  I will likely try this again when the zucchini and tomatoes in the garden are ripe.  My husband described it as "pretty and interesting tasting".

Made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit.  I used brown rice, yellow squash and a tomato from the garden.  I also increased the garlic and used fresh herbs from my garden ( savory, basil and oregano) and skipped the paprika.  I probably cut back on the cheese somewhat, but it was still delicious.

Followed a lot of the recommendations such as boil the rice in chicken broth increase the rice to a full cup.
Doubled up on the ingredients and used Monterrey cheese. 5 stars is not enough.
This will be one I make more often..

This had really good flavor, I didn't think it was bland at all like other reviewers.  I did add more rice as it seemed kinda sparse.  Other than that it was excellent.

This was so easy and delicious! I will be making this very often. I followed the recipe exactly, and the next time I make it, I will add about a fourth to a half of a teaspoon more salt (just my preference). The recipe is fine just the way it is.

This is good. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and increased the amount of spices. I also added a little chopped red bell pepper. I do think the trick to make this truly amazing is to swap out the cheddar cheese for monterey jack cheese. Just a hunch on that. All-in-all it is very good.

This was absolutely delish!! I logged on to get one of my other breakfast recipes and this was the featured recipe and boy am I glad it was.  I couldn't stop thinking about it so I had to make it the next day.  I fell in love.  It is definitely a keeper.  I did make a few changes  Some out of preference others out of necessity.  First I doubled the amount of rice.  I used one large zucchini and have no idea how much it weighed.  I also used 1 tsp of basil and paprika.  I couldn't find my Oregano so I used 1 tsp of Italian seasoning (even though I already added the basil)  Instead of garlic salt I used 1 tsp granulated garlic and 1/4 salt.  I also used about 3 cloves of garlic.  The amount of rice as written just did not seem like enough and I was right.  I am glad that I doubled it.  With the rice doubled like I made it, it made about 6 servings.  I grilled up some sausages and served this with it. YUM YUM YUM I am hiding the leftovers so I can take it to work with me.  I will definitely be making this again.  Highly recommend this recipe!

This casserole received great raves.  Made half with cheese and half without. Both ways tirned out great. I substituted cherry tomatoes halved because they needed to be used, otherwise follwed the recipe as written. Made a great sidedish for tilapia.

I made this with millet instead of rice, left out the cheese (because my teenager had eaten all our cheese) and used fresh herbs. It was still really good.

Yummy!  I ditched the garlic salt for extra fresh garlic and did 1 T each of basil, paprika, & oregano. This is a great way to clean out the crisper! I added fresh corn & celery, but you could easily add whatever you had. To cut fat I only used 1 c. of cheese and added 1/4 c. of fat free sour cream to keep it creamy.

My husband said this was is a "10"!  I used one really big zucchini for this recipe--maybe 2-3 lbs?  Then added 3-4 garlic cloves, 1 red bell pepper, and 1/2 cup of chopped red onion.  I also used fresh basil and parsley and sea salt with a little chili powder since I didn't have paprika.  I didn't have garlic salt and didn't have white rice but used 1/2 cup of quick-cook brown rice with 1 cup water. I put it in a 9x13 pan and used about a cup of mild cheddar with grated parmesan in the mix with about that much on top. Delicious! I look forward to leftovers tomorrow!

This is a GREAT recipe!!  I love the taste and how easy it is to make.  Great mix of flavors.  I make this just about once a week; I make it with different types of rices or I use yellow squash to mix it up a bit.  Really love it!!!

My family loved it! I followed the suggestions by doubling the spices and serving with garlic bread. I did add sliced mushrooms. Unfortunately, we don't have left overs. Next time I will double the recipe.

I read the reviews and decided to doubled the spices. I added a little cayenne pepper in it too. I used diced canned tomatoes w/oregano and basil instead of fresh-didn't have any on hand.  I was pleasantly surprised at how great zucchini can taste when paired with the ingredience this recipe calls for.  Next time I make it, I may just leave out the rice.  The vegetable/cheese mixture can stand on its own.

Delicious!  I made a few changes thanks to other reviews. This recipe definitely does not feed 6 unless it's a side dish. I followed the recipe but increased the rice to 1 cup uncooked brown, added some mushrooms and doubled the spices.  Also I used 1 cup of cheddar and then sprinkled Feta on top along w/some diced jalepeno.  The 4 of us gobbled it up!

I can barely cook and I was amazed how well this turned out. I'm glad I read the other comments about adding more rice and spices, it made a huge difference! I doubled all the spices and added a cup of rice.

Really good. Healthy and filling without leaving you with a heavy full feeling.  
I do think the vegetable oil is too much for this and will substitute olive oil next time.  
This is really only enough for two people, I suggest doubling it for a family.

Excellent recipe; this was easy to make and has wonderful flavour, especially when reheated as leftovers. I did take the advice of some other reviewers and doubled most of the herbs; I also used canned, italian-spiced tomatoes (fresh tomatoes at the grocery store this time of year taste like cardboard)...and I added a bit of frozen chopped spinach when I was cooking the zucchini mix. Since it's just myself at home I have lots of leftovers, and will make a great lunch to take to work. Definitely have this one saved to my recipe box!

I used brown rice instead of white, doubled the garlic and halved the oil. I added a couple of scrambled eggs to increase protein so it could be used as a main dish. My husband took it to work for lunches but his coworkers stole it!

I tried this recipe and it was the best zucchini dish I have ever made. Not only did my husband love it, my 2 daughters, who hate vegetables, ask me to make it anytime they see zucchini in the house. With a rack of baby back barbecue ribs and some texas toast garlic bread, it's the perfect Sunday meal.

What better time to use fresh garden vegetables and herbs than now. This was the perfect recipe to put them to good use, especially the zucchini. This was an absolute hit! DELICIOUS-DELICIOUS-DELICIOUS! My family couldn't get enough of this flavorful dish (and I have little ones that are picky eaters). I followed the directions completely, only changing the amount of rice to 1 cup of uncooked. It makes it go a little further- I don't think any flavor was lost.  I have made this dish twice and will keep on making it! I serve it with homemade bread to top off that homemade garden fresh flavor! Thank You for this simple and tasty recipe good for any time of year but especially the end of summer harvest.

It's hard to rate this as is because I changed so much but I still give the base recipe and the concept 5*.  I suggest if you like a dish with flavor you do the same, just add all your fav spices and go from there. I used another reviewers sug. of adding chicken flavor to rice, I also added 1lb. ground beef, and doubled the rice. Also Celery, red and green bell pepper, red onion, and asparagus were added to veg medley and Parmesan cheese to the cheddar. The end result was fantastic. Oh and instead of fresh tomato I added a can of rotel (cilantro and lime). My 2 little kids loved it and so did I.  I would also suggest that you cook the veg for a bit or it will be very watery.

This was out of this world! I used reduced fat Colby Jack cheese and brown rice to make it a little bit healthier. We ate this as a side dish, but my fiance asked me to throw in Shrimp or Chicken next time so that we can eat it as meal! Awesome!!

Took this to a picnic and it was a big hit!  One young boy kept coming back for more - his momma was thrilled that he was eating veggies!  I substituted orzo for the rice and used a quart of canned tomatoes - excellent!!

This is a great base recipe, but after reading the reviews I added a few things and it was so good I find myself randomly craving it. I doubled the amount of rice (used brown rice) and cooked it in chicken broth. I used canned stewed tomatoes since I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand, but made sure to drain them first. I added red pepper flakes and onion powder, reduced the amount of Cheddar cheese by just a little, and sprinkled a generous helping of grated parmesan on top just before baking. I baked the casserole for about 15 minutes, total. I regularly read reviews complaining about people making changes to recipes but I feel that one of the most positive things about sharing online recipes is also sharing ways to tweak them to one's own taste. The only reviews I find annoying are the ones where the wrong ingredients are used and the reviewer has the nerve to give a poor review to a recipe he didn't follow (i.e., don't substitute mozzarella for sharp cheddar and then complain about a recipe being bland!) Anyway, if you try this recipe the way I've described, it is very flavorful and not lacking at all, in my humble opinion. One more thing, be sure not to overcook the zucchini. It softens fast during the first stage of cooking.

Pretty tasty!  I added some red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Also, I only used about 1 cup total of 2% cheese to make it a little healtheri.

Really nice side dish!!! Refreshing and bright flavors with little work - this will be made often from now on out. If you want to make it a main meal add some sausage or shrimp. NOTE - it's not a very LARGE dish - if you are having company it would be best to double it, or triple. my husband and i cleaned out this size recipe in a sitting

This is definite keeper. Will use more rice next time.
Used mix of shredded Italian cheeses, diced sweet onion--no green onions in fridge, chopped garlic, garlic powder and fresh basil--no other herbs but will         try with fresh oregano if I think about it at grocery.    Cooked rice in chicken broth for flavor.                           


 Was a big hit--no leftovers darn it!

Tasty and successful with DH.  
I baked this in individual sized baking dishes to carry for work lunches.  Made. The following adaptations: used brown rice and increased it to 1/2 cup uncooked, addedn 8 oz pkg of mushrooms because I needed to use them & cut back to 2 smallish zuchinni to compensate.  Omitted garlic salt but increased to 3 cloves minced garlic.  Used an Italian blend of shredded cheese rather than cheddar.  The dish wa s very tasty and made a good lunch, but we both wished for a larger serving as this was the main dish.  I divided the recipe into 4 servings rather than 6 but will make larger portions next time if serving as a main dish.

This is outstanding!  The only thing I substituted was brown rice for the white rice.  When using brown rice instead of white keep in mind that a full cup of water will be needed and it takes about 40 - 50 minutes to cook.  I will be making this again and again!

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about with this recipe.  This recipe was just okay for me, nothing special.  It had too much garlic salt and too much cheese.  The flavor profile is pretty basic.

Very tasty rice and veggie dish that could easily be modified to using ingredients already on hand or in season. Doubling the spices was a great suggestion as was using 3 cloves garlic.

This was just ok for me.  I doubled the spices for more flavor and increased the rice to 1/2 cup as other reviewers recommended and I definitely think those are 2 necessary changes.  And I reduced the cheese, another necessity.  But I still didn't love it . . . honestly I think the herb combo just doesn't work well.  The flavor seemed off somehow.  If I were to try it again I think I would use different herbs and try to get a different flavor.

I made this!! YAY. It was good. A little greasy due to the cheese I have to figure out a way to avoid that. I added a little Red pepper and red onions for some color. It wsa good. I think next time imma try it with meat of some sort. Good overall... thanks  BTW the vegetarians that i cooked it for were shocked it was so tasty..

This is a great versatile vegetarian recipe. I have added red pepper, broccoli and different herbs as well as sometimes using brown rice instead and it always comes out tasting good.

5 stars only if you double the spices. I used 1/2 c. brown rice and only 1 cup cheese. Added peppers. Didn't even put it in the oven, ate it out of the skillet and it was great!

This was sooooo good! I used brown rice instead of white and I used a chunky tomato sauce because i didnt have any tomatoes. The tomato sauce was enough to not have to add the extra seasonings as others did. I substituted EVOO for the vegetable oil & i sliced my zucchini very thin & then quartered it. I just eyeballed the cheese because we're on diets. I didnt want to dirty another dish so I just added the cheese right on top of the skillet, covered it & let the cheese melt! This side dish is pretty filling and would be a great vegetarian main dish.  I will be adding this to my regular rotation for sure!

The picture makes it look like it is a recipe that is mostly rice/cheese with vegetables.  However, if you follow the recipe, there is hardly any rice.  I doubled rice, and still wanted more.  I would triple the rice.  Double or triple all spices except for salt.  Also, I made it for 4 servings...just use a can of tomatos, and drain the liquid, and you will have a perfect amount of tomatos, even though this is 1/3 more than the recipe calls for. ENJOY! :)

This recipe is really good and healthy, but I'm glad I read the reviews before making it. I followed other reviewer's advices and at least trippled the amount of spices. I also added a chicken cube while cooking the rice. Next time I'll use at least 1 cup of rice for the recipe. I also added about a cup of green bell peppers, which was great. Next time I will add some ground turkey or beef to give it additional flavor. Otherwise great recipe and super easy to make! Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I used brown rice and canned tomatoes and it was excellent. Even my 1 1/2 yr old like it!

This was wonderful.  Great way to use up garden veggies.  I used a blend of zucchini, eggplant, green pepper and onion.  Double spices as recommended and used half the cheese.  It was very cheesy...can't imagine using the full 2 cups.  I also doubled the rice.  Fantastic!  Thanks, Debi!

I thought this turned out great!  My husband wasn't crazy about it b/c he doesn't like tomatoes, but next time I'll leave those out and it will still be good.

I give it 4 stars for thought.  I added sweet peppers, feta cheese, avacado, extra salt(which I'm not a fan of) and hot sauce to garnish.  It is rather bland but like all things not everyone is a like.  Wish I would have read the reviews first.  Would have added some diced hot peppers and more garlic.  We like flavour!

Except for garlic (never enough garlic), I seasoned as suggested and found the flavor just right. I might reduce the amount of cheese next time I make it but definitely use sharp again.  This could be good with sweet peppers and/or other varieties of squash added too.

To me this had to much cheese but was good besides that.  Probably something I wouldn't make for myself again.  However, my husband thought this was the best thing I ever made!!  He loves this and has begged me to make it again.  He said to make for our family reunion coming up, but I'm still skeptical.

Yummy!!! This was our one and only dish for dinner and we ate it all! I had some yellow squash, yellow & green peppers so I added them in with the onions and zucchini. Delish!! I just used more oil  and spices when cooking the veggies, then doubled the rice but actually decreased the cheese to 1 1/2 cups. I prefer the veggies to stand out and be accented by the cheese, not covered by it. This is now in my top 10 favorite recipes. It only took about 10 minutes in the oven for my cheese to melt.

This was a huge hit. Made it according to the directions but used canned tomatoes vs. fresh because we are not big tomato people and canned was all I had in the house. My husband and friend were hesitant at first but both became quick fans and had a second helping each. This is now a regular in my meal plans!

I was skeptical as to whether my family would like this or not, however, it was a hit at supper.  I did not make any changes to the recipe but will add more rice next time. This one is going in the summer time recipe box.  Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It served as a main dish for me (I don't eat much meat) and a side dish for my boyfriend.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the garlic and herbs (not the garlic salt).  This will be a staple in my recipe book from now on!

This was excellent. The only change was a can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh and brown rice instead of long grain.  I did use less garlic powder and still tasted great.  A very hearty and healthy dish!

This is a great summer casserole that you can adapt to your liking! I used brown whole grain rice, 50% reduced fat jalepeno cheddar and reduced the amount a little bit- maybe by 1/2 cup. I added a red bell pepper and used sweet onion and a LOT of it! I used 3 cloves garlic- like I said, change it up a little to however you like it!

After reading the reviews, I did make a few changes: used chicken bouillon for the rice, doubled the rice, used three garlic cloves, tripled the basil and oregano, and used a bit less cheese. Also, I skipped the baking step (if you cover it, the cheese will melt on the stove - saves a dirty dish).      I liked the overall flavour, it smelled absolutely fabulous on the stove, and I'm definitely glad I altered the original recipe (wouldn't have been enough herbs for sure!), but I don't think this was absolutely outstanding. If I have lots of zucchini to use up I'll probably make this again, but I won't go out of my way to buy ingredients for it. And I'd be more likely to use it as a side dish, whereas tonight we ate it as our main meal with a baguette.      Still, it wasn't a big disappointment. The taste was nice.

I made these at home and then took leftovers to work the next day.  My coworker loved them.  I thought they were a 3 1/2 to a 4 but not a five star recipe.  They do need more seasoning but that is all so individual that no one can tell your taste buds exactly what they need to be.  You will have to experiment and find out for yourself but it is a good recipe.

I only gave this 3 stars because the original recipe lacked flavor. Like other reviews, I doubled the spices, but still felt that it was bland. All I could taste was the paprika. So before baking, I added salt to taste (which was quite a bit), pepper, and about 3 T of tomato sauce. With these modifications it turned out pretty good. I will make again, but may play around with the spices a bit. It definitely needs salt!

Absolutely great way to use up the overabundance of zucchini we tend to accumulate at the end of the summer.  Very tasty.  I did triple the amount of spice as the other reviewers suggested, and I used Monteray Jack instead of cheddar.  Quite tasty.  Great texture.

Delicious. I would have given 5 stars, but I did take other readers' advice and made a few slight changes: increased all spices, added fresh mushrooms, and used mozzarella instead of cheddar. Also, I used it as a main dish so I used 1 cup of rice and increased amount of veggies to fill a 9x13. Next time I think I will try adding some chicken.

I've made this dish 4 times. 
The first with double spices and mild cheese.  The recipe really does need the sharp chedder cheese.  
The second time I added yellow/red bell peppers.  It was great!  
Third time substituted salsa for the tomatoes.  It was wonderful!  
The fourth time, I used green bell peppers and jalepeno peppers to taste, and used fresh tomatoes again.  Wow, it was best combination of all!  
I always doubled the spices, used wild rice instead of white and add some sort of pepper to taste.  Cook the rice in chicken bullion or plain, either way is good.
It's also a good dish for those giant zucchinis from the garden.  Peel them, remove seeds and cube the zucchini.
What did I learn?  This recipe is very adaptable!  My household absolutely loves this dish.

It turned out well.  Nice flavor!  Made the following changes: 1/2 cup rice, 1/2 cup onion instead of green onion, 3 clove garlic, doubled seasoning, 1 cup cheese (half mixed in, half on top), added mushrooms and green pepper.

Excellent recipe!  I did follow the recommendations re: triple spices including garlic,  use chicken broth for the rice because it does need the additional flavour.  I also used a 1/2 tsp of chilli powder too and also added carrots, brocolli and yellow pepper.

I am glad I read the reviews on this recipe before making it, because it may have turned out rather bland otherwise. I added 2 more cloves of garlic, tripled the amount of seasoning (except the salt),used feta cheese. I also substituted white rice with instant brown rice.

Very good summer recipe.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the spices and reduced the cheese to 1/2 cup.  I'll be making this again. The whole family enjoyed it.  It is a great way to use up those garden veggies.

I followed everyone's advice and changed this recipe a little (OK, maybe alot). I used 1 cup brown rice cooked w/a chicken bouillon cube. I added 1/2 cup regular onion (rather than green), 1/2 green and red peppers and 3 cloves garlic. I upped the basil and oregano to 2 teaspoons and the paprika to 1 teaspoon. Everything was sauteed in 1T olive oil and then I used mozzerella cheese instead of the cheddar. Turned out great with all those changes.

This was fantastic! I had a bunch of guys over and they scarfed it down, no meat no problem. I made a few changes like other reviews suggested, a lot more spice, about a cup of rice, added one cup grated carrot, used extra fresh garlic (no garlic salt), used walla walla onion instead of green and parsley instead of oregano because I didn't have any on hard. Also broiled after baking to get the cheesy top to bubble. Will for sure make again and again! Thanks!

I really liked this recipe. I did double the herbs and doubled the amount of rice. Also found that once I cooked the zucchini and added the rice, tomatoes and cheese I really did not have to bake it again....excellent. Thank you!

This was good, husband really liked it. I sauted my vegatables in equal parts butter and olive oil to give it more flavor. I guess I'm not a big oregano fan (unless it's in a red sauce) and will omit it next time I make this.  I didn't really see a point of baking it either except to melt the cheese on top.  I'll omit both steps next time too.

You definitely want to triple the spices otherwise this would be very bland. I took other reviewers advice and cooked the rice with a chicken bouillon cube, I used two cups of cheddar cheese. I still feel it was missing something but hubby and friends thought it was delicious and I was told I can make it whenever b/c it was such a hit with them. Thank you for the recipe.

this was pretty good but needed a few minor modifications in order to be a 5 star recipe.  First, the seasonings weren't quite enough for me and need to be doubled (otherwise it will be bland).  I don't think that sharp cheddar is the way to go either.  Next time I make this I'll try mozzarella for a more mild flavor.  We love onions and next time I'll add a whole sweet onion to sautee with the zucchini and only cook the green onions for a minute or two before adding to the casserole dish.  I also think that fresh sliced mushrooms would be good in this recipe.  I will be making it again as it has potential to be out of this world!  Thanks for the recipe ...

This was awesome! But I did make a few modifications; I added two diced shallots, doubled up on the spices and added a dusting of red pepper flakes for some kick. I used about 1/2 of the cheese and I used a cheddar/pepper jack blend. I also added in some diced red bell pepper, subbed for brown rice and used a can of diced tomatoes rather than the fresh. It was a BIG hit and I am positive I will be making this again. Thanks so much for sharing!!

This was yummy!  I followed everyone's lead and put tons of herbs and spices, and I used sweet onion and green pepper.  I also used 1c. of brown rice cooked with chicken bouillion.  I added 2 lbs. of shrimp and made this a main dish.  It made enough to feed a small army so we'll have leftovers well into the week.  We'll definitely make this again, but next time I'm going to try adding chopped sausage or brats instead of shrimp.

I changed this up a bit. We had a HUGE bunch of home garden vegetables to use up, so I added carrots and fresh basil along with the zucchini and tomatoes. I used shallots instead of green onions because that's what I had, and I used a wild rice box mix with the seasoning because I read this was a bit bland. I loved the result! It was good, cheesy and felt homey and light at the same time.

Excellent! Following other reviewers' suggestions, I increased the amount of rice and spices, and I added some bell peppers as well. Instead of cheddar cheese, I mixed in mozzarella, and I sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on top. Perfect taste and perfect texture.

My entire family loved this recipe.  I used 1/2 c. of rice & olive oil rather than vegetable oil.  I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes w/jalapenos, drained, because my garden tomatoes are not quite ready.  I also  added chopped poblano pepper when cooking the zucchini/onion mixture.  I didn't have cheddar cheese on hand, so I used a colby/monterey jack blend of cheese, & it was delicious.  I have six zucchini staring at me & many more in the garden, so I really appreciate this outstanding recipe.

This was better than I thought it would be given some of the comments I read.  I took the advice of various others and made some changes to the recipe.  I used 1/2 cup raw brown rice to start.  I also doubled up on the the spices except for the garlic salt.  I used 1/2 cup chopped onion and Italian Bread crumbs.  I also cut the Cheddar cheese to 1 cup.  There was nothing left for lunch the next day!  Great summer time recipe!

This is very good...if you follow the changes recommended by other reviewers.  Here were mine:  I upped the rice to 1/2 cup (Could probably have used more) And cooked it in vegetable bullion.  I increased the spices to 1 tsp each.  I minced two cloves of garlic and omitted the garlic salt.  I used 1/2 tsp kosher salt instead because of salt content in the bullion cube.
   I used half a can of diced tomatoes and instead of the cheese, we used half a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I divided the recipe into two small casserole dishes and added some cooked chicken breast in one and some Morningstar Chik'n strips to the other since I'm a vegetarian.  Sprinkled some cheddar on top and everyone had seconds!  Sorry for so many changes, but the recipe lends itself to variation.  I'd definitely up the spices and the rice no matter what.

Very disappointing.  This dish needs a lot more rice & seasoning, and a lot less cheese.  It turned out really oily and flavorless.  The concept is good though, and I may try it again with a few changes.  Thanks.

This recipe totally exceeded my expectations.  I only made a couple of minor changes:  1. doubled the rice and added veggie bullion to the water 2. added five cloves of garlic and not the garlic salt (perfect garlic taste for myself) 3.  Added about 1 cup of old cheddar and a bit of parmesan cheese on top.  The veggies tasted great.  I will make this one again regularly.

This is a very good recipe.  I wanted to reduce the fat and calories so I omitted the oil and sauteed the veggies in about 2 tbsp. of chicken broth.  Instead of cheddar cheese I sprinkled parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs on top.  I used brown rice instead of white to add fiber.  I doubled the spices as other people had suggested.  It turned out great!

Excellent.  I used brown rice, canned stewed diced tomatoes, halved the cheese and topped it with panko bread crumbs.  I broiled it for 5 minutes after baking.  Awesome recipe.  This is now a staple for me.

I like this, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and I wouldn't consider this a casserole either.  I think the reviewer who mentioned adding shrimp had the right idea.  I will try this again as a main entree with shrimp.

Really good side dish recipe.  I added some chopped carrots, and I used canned, drained, diced tomatoes.  I also threw in some chopped chicken breast I had left over from the night before.  Very tasty.  Everyone liked it.

We enjoyed this.  I used canned diced tomatoes that I drained as I didn't have any fresh an hand (The day after someone gave me a big basket of fresh - go figure). I used a tsp. of basil, oregano and paprika b/c others said it was bland.  Also didn't add fresh garlic and only a litte onion because I was using up rice from another recipe I  which already had those in it.  Also, I only mixxed in about a 1/4 cup of the cheese and since I had more rice than the recipe called for it was a little dry.  Next time I will add more cheese and keep the rice increased as we enjoyed it this way.  Thanks for the recipe.  Sorry we altered it so much but we were trying to use up leftovers.  It was really good though.

Yummy! Adding the shrimp was an awesome idea.  Used 2 cloves garlic. Upped the spices and lowered the cheese.  May try a different cheese next time to better compliment the shrimp.

This one is a keeper! I added more rice since we love rice and I only put in half of the green onions, since that is all I had. Wonderful recipe, highly recommended

Very tasty!  I doubled the herbs and reduced the cheese as other members suggested.  Plus, I used an Italian cheese blend and topped it with Parmesan cheese.  It was really good!

I have been making this a lot and it is awesome as written except I cook the zucchini for a lot longer before adding the tomatoes and rice- like 20 minutes- because we like it to be really soft.  We scramble eggs with the leftovers and it's just delicious.

Today I modified it and it was so delicious I had to share.  I added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper in addition to the seasonings and substituted salsa for the tomatoes.  I had leftover pinto beans and brown rice and used those instead of plain rice.  It is SO GOOD.  So there's another twist to this incredibly yummy zucchini recipe!!  Thanks so much :)

This was quite good.  My husband went for seconds but my picky toddler was turned off by the zucchini.  To make it more of meal, I increased the rice to 1 cup, tripled the garlic, doubled the spices, and decreased the cheese to 1 cup.  Using garden fresh vegetables makes a world of difference too.

This was pretty good.  I made a few changes:  I used vegetable broth to cook the rice in instead of water, and I used 4 garlic cloves instead of 1.  It has a pretty mild flavor, you may want to add more seasoning if you like a lot of flavor.  I would make this again.

This was Really good- my husband liked it and I went back for seconds. I used about 1/2 cup of rice and put a little chicken bouillon in the water.  I eyeballed the cheese but I think I used just a little under the amount in the recipe. I used about 4 cloves minced garlic and put in more seasonings to taste. I think it would have been bland for me without the changes.

I have to give this five stars because my 9 year old daughter ate it! She only eats the basic veggies like corn, green beans, carrots, or potatoes and she hates tomatoes and zuchinni, as does my partner and they both ate it...my daughter even had seconds! Changes I made was to add more herbs and a pinch of salt, I used 3/4 can of petite diced tomatoes, drained, added red onion with the green onion. It was delicious and I am excited to serve it again because I can get more variety of veggies into my family!

My boyfriend liked this alright, but the combination of flavors just wasn't tasty for me.  I think that the tomato was too much for me.  I probably won't be making this again.

Okay, I only messed with this recipe because I did not have the necessary ingredients on hand. I used a cup and ahalf of macaroni because I didn't have rice, and I used romano cheese mixed in with the cheddar because I thought that would be tasty. It was! Great recipe, a definite repeater.

I love this recipe but I did change a couple of things. I love veggies so I added mushrooms and bell peppers I also used Red onion instead of green onion, changed the white rice to brown rice and reduced the cheese to half. It was a very healthy meal that I would definately make again.

I'm a big zucchini fan and this was really good!  The only thing I might add next time I make is is some mushrooms and/or yellow squash.  Oh, and I found that colby and monteray jack cheese is perfect for it.

Very very good. My husband likes this and he doesn't even like zucchini! I used colby/jack cheese instead of cheddar, and a can of diced tomatoes. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I sauteed my veggies in an ovenproof pan, with cooking spray to reduce oil. Then stirred in the cooked rice and topped with 1/2 amount of cheese. Baked in same pan. Didnt like the paprika. I dont see why it needs to be baked for 20min, you could just stick it under the broiler to melt the cheese...maybe next time.

This was really good.  It really is better than it sounds like it would be.  I added more garlic, and less cheese than called for.  Most of the kids liked it too.  I will be making this often.  Thanks for a really great healthy recipe!

Yum, yum!!  This did not make 6 servings, rather it made approximately 3 servings.  I used instant brown rice and reduced the cheese by half.  Absolutely delicious!  This is a keeper.

My husband and I enjoyed this -- a different way of serving zuchinni and a nice change for a side dish (I served it with grilled turkey tenderloin).  I will add more rice next time.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes with the juice -- roasted garlic flavor.  Yummy!

Will make again soon. Thought our vegan sausage would be nice in this to make a lovely vegan meal, but when I went to the cabinet, noticed several rice mixes I needed to get rid of, with beans already included. I used a box mix of Spanish Rice and Beans, and added everything else called for in this recipe, doubling spices, subbing red onion, and using non-dairy cheeze. Vegan partner nearly devoured most of it at dinner and later I realized I'd forgotten garlic altogether. Still very delicious. I also did not fry veggies prior to mixing everything and baking, but baked about 5-6mins extra to soften red onion and get the squash to the texture we like.

As suggested by others I added 3 cloves of garlic and doubled the spices. I only used 1 lb of zucchini because I added left over broccoli and 1 carrot. 

The consensus from my wife and 2 daughters (12 and 14) that it was just OK. I think it lacks something hearty in it,  maybe some tofu might give it just enough to make it a satisfying meal. Otherwise the recipe as it stands is better as just a side dish to something else.

I used the suggestions in the reviews. I wanted more of a rice dish, so I used 1 whole cup of rice, which I cooked in vegetable broth instead of water. I broiled the zucchini and half of a yellow onion. (it might have been a white onion?) I doubled the seasoning and added a garlic clove. I only put a thin layer of cheese on top. Garnished with green onions.  It was very good as a hearty side dish and more exciting than plain Spanish rice. The next day I added black beans, two garlic cloves, and more cheese. Then I used it to make BRC burritos. (BRC =  beans rice cheese. It is a type of burrito sold at El Pollo Loco). I still have some left and I am going to mix it into spinach tomorrow night to make a rice salad. As a single person, this is the kind of dish that can last me as a side dish all week and be used in a lot of different ways.

Delish....Through in some cooked chicken, backed off the cheese to 1/2 cup on top and used canned, diced tomatoes. Upped the garlic and omitted the garlic salt; 2 tablespoons of Italian seasonings.

Added  more garlic and meat to make a one pot meal. Once, cubed chicken, once shredded beef, once sweet Italian sausage. We preferred the sausage with half of a red bell pepper

Delicious way to use up extra produce! I veganized this by replacing the cheese with 1/2 cup Daiya vegan cheddar shreds and 2 tablespoons of nutritional yeast. I also followed everyone’s recommendation of increasing the seasonings and garlic. Lastly, I used brown rice! It was superb and by my calculations landed at only 144 calories and 0g of cholesterol per serving even though it is so filling!

Loved it.  I really like veggies so added peppers and broccoli and would have added more but that’s all I had!  Doubled the rice, tripled the garlic and went heavy on paprika.  Halted the cheese.  So many variations can be made!

Always looking for a good zucchini recipe during the summer and this one is a keeper! I have to admit, I did make a few changes while trying to use up what my garden produces. I added double the garlic, sweet onion, red sweet pepper and a little chicken bouillon(omitted the garlic salt). Thanks for this wonderful dish, my family appreciates it!

I made a few changes to suit my family's preference.  I used a huge zucchini from the garden about 1 foot and a half long.  Because of the huge zucchini I had to use 2 cups of rice.  I used brown rice, which made it chewier.  I didn't have green onions, so I used a huge red onion.  Also included a red bell pepper.    I didn't have enough tomatoes so I cooked the rice with a half jar of salsa.  I also cooked the rice with cumin seeds.  I sauted about 5 cloves of garlic and 2 jalapeno peppers for 2 minutes and then added the zuchinni, onion and red bell pepper. After 5 minutes added fresh coriander.  Placed half of mixture  in a 5 quart baking dish, layered  with a cup of cheddar cheese and then layered the other half of mixture and topped with another cup of cheese.  It was delicious!  Thank you for the great idea of adding zucchini to rice.  I never would have thought of it.

I used this as a base recipe for dinner. I changed it up a little cuz I didn't have all the ingredients. I used the veggies but used a seasoning packet from a  rice side that was roasted veggies and chicken flavored....added a 1/4 cup of water and added grilled chicken and parmesan cheese. It was incredibly good!! I will definitely make this again!!!

I used this recipe as a base.  I added cubed chicken breast. and instead of rice I used orzo pasta.  Only because we had rice for dinner the night before so I wanted something different.  I'm sure rice would be great too.  Everything else remained the same.  It was quite good.  I would make it again.

I used olive oil for the sauteeing and a combo of fresh and canned tomatoes.  I did not have any chunk cheese on hand, so I finely cut up both cheddar and pepper jack for the mixture then put slices of both on top to bake.  It turned out to be DELISH!  Will def make again!

Absolutely AMAZING!!!!!  I’m not a natural in the kitchen but thanks to this app and wonderful recipes like this I’m learning. That said I found this recipe so incredibly easy that I didn’t measure anything. I did what I wanted using the basic foundation of this FANTASTIC recipe. I did add red pepper but that’s it. It was an explosion of flavor and I can’t say enough how much I love this healthy recipe!!!!!  Oh right, I made this without rice because I have to watch carbs. Thanks again!!!

We loved it ! Spices  were perfect and added great flavor ! I added more rice as some reviewers suggested. We try to eat less cheese, so I only added 3/4 of a cup... still fabulous! I will definitely make it again for company...

If you're looking for a good easy-to-make meal, this is a solid choice. It's filling and pretty tasty. I did initially find it a bit bland, but once I added salt it was fine. Definitely one I'd make again (and maybe try some of the adjustments recommended by other cooks), especially when a vegetarian option is needed. (This would be a great potluck food!)

There were no instructions to drain the water off the cooked veggies, but I drained water before mixing in the rice and cheese.  I would recommend that unless you want a very wet dish.   I also added some gluten free Panko breadcrumbs to the top.  I used plain salt instead of garlic salt so it wouldn’t be too garlicky.  After the 20 minute cook time, I broiled for 4 minutes to brown the cheese.  Delish!    We ate for breakfast with eggs on the side.

Delicious, juicy, tasty, flavorful, and fairly simple to cook. Love how fast it is and relatively healthy barring the cheese. Definitely will want to use less cheese next time.

Huge hit with the whole family and that's hard to do.  I changed a few things - a little less scallions, half the cheese, double the rice, used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes (slightly drained) and double the garlic.  We don't like our dishes too cheesy and it was perfect for us.

I had the family Holiday party at my house and some of my family are vegetarian and a couple are vegan.  I made this exactly as the recipe was written, minus the cheese for the vegans.  It was a total hit with everyone, even us meat lovers.  I will probably make it again leaving the cheese out because I think it would mask the fresh taste of all the other wonderful flavors.

There was WAY too much cheese and not enough rice...should have trusted my gut and added at least 2-3 to 1 cup rice. This only makes a maximum of 3 servings and is way too cheesy. If I make it again, and I'm not sure that I will, I'll double the rice and halve the cheese.

I added mushrooms and almond milk and topped it of with crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. Came out creamy, mushrooms gave more flavor and crumbs really put this dish together. Definitely will be making it again!

I made this with jasmine rice, tripled the rice (we are hearty food eaters) added mushroom and used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I also topped with bread crumbs. Since I added some stuff I am only giving 4 stars. IT WAS SOOOOOOO GOOD though! Will definitely make again and again.

I made this according to the recipe the first time.  I don't think it's fair to write a review of a recipe if you don't actually follow the recipe as written.   That being said I made this to take to a pot luck and it received rave reviews.  I thought it a little bland for my tastes so I tweeked it a bit the next time I made it.  I added a can of Rotel tomatoes the 2nd time around and it make all the difference in the world, in Texas we like our peppers.  I also used a chopped yellow onion instead of a green onion, the results were great.  Not too spicy just right!

I added an extra cup of rice, plus a red pepper, a bunch of fresh basil, 5 cloves of garlic, and substituted 5 baby sized yellow onions and chives for the green onions. So basically, I didn't really follow the recipe but it is a great basis for many types of veggies and we LOVED it!!!

How have I not known about this recipe. Followed the the recipe exactly. Just the right amount of each ingredient. I used tomatoes, zucchini, and herbs from my garden. It's a keeper!

Very tasty. Made a few alterations:  added sliced mushrooms and red peppers as well as some sausage that had been previously barbecued. Added 1.5 tsp basil and oregano each as well as 1 tsp smokey paprika and 3 big garlic cloves minced.

Yup. I'm ones of those people that changed it a bit and loved it. But you have to take recipes and adapt them to your liking. Farro vs rice, veg broth vs water,  red onion added because its pretty, extra garlic... always, fresh herbs at least doubled, smoked paprika because its heavenly, and no cheese because I wanted squash and herbs. Eyeballed 2:1 ratio for vegetables to grain for us. Thank you!!

4.5 stars.  I roasted the vegetables in the oven like another person suggested, it was very good.  The only thing I would change is reduce the amount of cheese.  It was fairly healthy up to the point of adding all of that cheese...it was unnecessary to add the fat and calories.   I believe the dish would have been just as tasty without it.  A sprinkling on top would have been enough, and much healthier.  The next time, I would cut the vegetables in larger chunks.

We loved this.  I did increase spices as suggested by others.  I didn't have all ingredients on hand so I made these changes based on what I did have:   I used a can of rotel for the tomatoes, and I used quinoa (cooked in vegetable broth) instead of the white rice.    I have tons of zucchini from the garden and have been trying all kinds of new recipes.  This one will stay in my rotation.  This is one of those recipes that lends itself well to altering based on what you have on hand.

I had about 1/2 cup parm cheese, handful of mushrooms and half an onion to use up in my fridge so I browned those first and stirred the cheese into  casserole, only putting a little cheddar on top to bake; I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and used a little more seasonings and rice (undercooked it a touch so it wouldn't get to mushy after I baked it) because I added the juice from the tomato can and had a few more veggies. We sliced a zucchini really thin to make the top look nice and baked it all that way. Will be making again, possibly as a side to bring to a potluck--it's almost like a risotto!

I used 1/2 cup of rice and next time would do 3/4.  I added some hot sauce and it was absolutely delicious.  Would definitely make it again.  The website would not let me give it 5 stars so the comment "it was o.k." is NOT mine!  I used two different kinds of cheese - Havarti and a smelly Quebec cheese.  Delish!

I have an abundance of zucchini growing in my garden, and wanted something different, and this was it!  My son and I loved it!  I followed the directions, but it didn't seem too much of a tomato sauce, and I added a can on Campbell's Tomato Soup minus the water, and it was perfect.  Next time I may add sausage link slices or shrimp to make a whole meal.

I made this recipe with quinoa and used less cheese (about 1  - 1 1/2 cup).  It turned out great.  I used the same amount of quinoa as rice and mixed in 1/2 cup cheese into the casserole and topped it with 3/4 cup of cheese.  That way I could taste more of the flavor of the dish.  My husband absolutely loved it.  His words "This may be healthy, but man is it good!"

This was a hit! I did make a couple changes based on other reviews. I did use more spice than called for - quite a bit more. I also broiled the veggies instead of sauteing them and cooked the rice in chicken stock rather than water. The end outcome was wonderful and I will definitely make this again.
Update: second time, added both dried and fresh herbs, which made it a tad spicy and also so, so good. I also added both cheddar and Parmesan - I think next time I will skip the cheddar altogether. Parmesan is better and goes with the veggies better for me.

This was delish.  Threw in a few cloves of garlic, more herbs, and mixed mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Oh -- I also doubled the rice. That way you can just add as much looks right. The amount specified in the recipe wouldn't have been enough. I would cook zucchini for 5 minutes and just throw green onions and garlic in toward the end so they don't get burned.

This was great, I made it for a party and got lots of compliments. I did use chicken stock to make my rice, which adds a great flavor, but of course then makes it non-vegetarian.

I read the reviews first, and was glad I did. I added a whole onion, olive oil instead of vegetable, at least quadrupled the spices, except for basil, where I used almost a quarter cup of fresh, added a dash of cayenne and cumin, and extra cheese. It certainly helped on the flavor front. Not the best dish I've ever had, but far from as bad.

This was good, a little bland. I increased the rice to 1/2 cup, added extra garlic and substituted an orange bell pepper for the tomato. I will make it again but definitely increase the seasoning and maybe cook the rice in chicken broth for extra flavor.

Did 1/2 cup rice and did it in the cast iron skillet.  Adults loved it and one kid liked it.  Quick and easy so it's a keeper.

I've made this twice and it was amazing! The second time I added more rice, which I suggest, but otherwise my family and I love it! Thanks!

The only change I made is put everything into a cast iron skillet instead of a casserole dish and "baked" it on the barbecue! Indirect heat, about 300*F for about half an hour...came out awesome! A great side with the steaks and corn on the cob we had, thank you for sharing!

What a great way to use up zucchini!  I made this with quinoa instead of rice and enjoyed it very much. I didn't really measure but based on other recommendation, I upped the herbs and used basil-garlic diced tomatoes, drained. This is very healthy depending on how much cheese you use. Will definitely be mag this again!

This was really good, along with being fairly healthy. My only complaint is that it seems to me to be more of a side dish than a vegetarian main dish. I was left wanting more.

Per many review suggestions, I doubled the spices. I used a whole yellow onion because that is what I had. I used a can of diced tomatoes. I also used 2.5 cups of rice because I made it as a main dish for 5 kids.  

Everyone liked it.

No changes to this recipe - just doubled the recipe for summer entertaining. I make this as a side dish to complement chicken or kabobs on the grill. Company raves about it!!! Great way to combine starch with a vegetable - plus I make it ahead of time then pop it in the oven when I'm at the grill - great way to enjoy my company and not get caught up in the kitchen

I loved this stuff. Next time I make it I will probably alter the recipe. It doesnt need that much cheese and zucchini. I like spicy so I"m gonna add jalepinos. It tastes like Zatarans Spanish Rice. It was very good.

I made this last night for supper with the following changes: I doubled the spices based on previous reviews. I used Hungarian Paprika because it's what I had in the cupboard. I used brown rice in place of white. Instead of the tomatoes, I used a can of original Rotel drained and I used half a red onion instead of green onions. I also added some Bob Evans zesty sausage. Wow!!! This meal was amazing!! My boyfriend loved it and asked me to make this again!!!!

This was a hit with my husband, 1-year old and 2.5 year old. We all really liked it.  After reading reviews I used 1/2 cup of rice, added a red bell pepper and also some  shrimp.  Increased the spices a bit too.
Great recipe, will make again!

Really good.  I made 1 c of rice, 1.3lbs zucchini, 1/2 yelliow onion, fresh garlic (3 cloves), bell peppers, and tomatoes (used half a whole and a bunch of cherry tomatoes cut in halves).  I also mixed in chicken cut up into pieces, maybe 1.5-2c.  Mixed all together with 1 c cheese, and more on top.  I wasn't sure how flavorful this would be but it was very good!  It made a lot with what I used, great for company.

This recipe was very good. The only change I would make was the amount of cheese. The cheese completely overpowered the rest of the dish and I couldn't taste any of the seasonings. I would double the oregeno and basil next time, also I would probably consider adding chicken.

I made this recipe healthier by using quinoa instead of white rice.  I am a garlic lover so I always double the amount of fresh garlic in all my recipes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Loved the flavor and the family loved it too.  Great way to get kids to eat their vegetables.

I'm so thankfull for this recipe, really changed the rice game in my house! Delicious! I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand, so I drained a can of diced tomatoes. I was also short on time so I didn't bake it. I cooked the rice separate and the zucchini/green onion/garlic/tomatoes in a sauce pan and reduced down the liquid from the tomatoes as fast as I could. Mixed everything in and dumped in the cheese- perfect and done in 20 minutes! This is a GREAT side dish!

Really good (even my courgette-hating husband wanted seconds). I added a handful of spinach and also a chilli tomato sauce to spice it up. Will definitely be adding this to our list of 'ready meals'.

I think this is a really great dish--it has great flavor. I used it for a main dish for vegetarians with bread and fruit but it is a great side dish as well. Even though it's described as a summer dish, turning on the oven in the summer isn't very fun, and there's no reason why you can't make it at other times of year. Recommend it!

Wonderfully flavorful. I cooked the rice in chicken broth, added chicken, asparagus, squash, mushrooms, celery, and the original ingredients to it. Makes for a very filling dinner!

It was good, but bland.  Maybe some cayenne or spices would've made it go further, or a more flavorful type of rice.

This was amazing! We are doing a vegitarian month in school, so this recipe was perfect for me. I also substituted the white rice for instant brown rice because that's what I usually have. I had leftovers the next day for lunch, and it was just as good! Thanks for the recipe, this one will definitely help me this month, and even after! :)

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was a big hit.  I changed a couple things...I used 5 cloves of garlic (I love garlic) and doubled up on the rest of the herbs.  I also used brown rice as oppose to white.  I just made a batch of rice in my rice cooker and then added as much as wanted as I was stirring in everything else, this way I could fit everything in the cassorole dish that I wanted to.  Oh, I also added half a red onion.

My wife called it bland. My wife suggested velveeta or cheese wiz rather than simple monterey jack. I need to get a better understanding of spices, before knowing which direction to push this.

I'm glad I tried this recipe I did make a few changes I used brown rice instead of wild rice. I used 1/2 cup. I used canned tomatoes I did not have fresh. I went kinda heavier on the seasons Im glad I did. I used sliced cheddar cheese did not have shredded n topped it with little Romano n Parmesan cheese. This was an overall great recipe would make it again!!!!

Wonderful! I made this recipe with a few changes and substitutions. Instead of using green onions, I chopped one large onion and added one chopped green pepper as well. I used 3 cups of zucchini and 2 cups of chopped tomatoes. For the rice I cooked 2 1/2 cups of Brown Dainty Rice. And finally I doubled the amount of cheese!

We really liked this.  I cut back on the cheese and used olive oil.  I also tripled all the herbs and put in 2 additional cloves of garlic.  The night I made it, I thought it was 'meh'-the oregano was too strong... but when I heated it up for leftovers a day or two later, Oh my goodness it was sooooo good-the seasoning was just right!  Guess the flavors needed time to mingle.  :)  I might just make this the day before we plan to eat it.  Thanks for sharing this!

This recipe is 5 stars with a few modifications - as others suggested, I subbed brown rice, used 2-3 times the amount of basil, oregano, and paprika and 5 cloves garlic without garlic salt.  In addition, I made a couple of other changes - 1 yellow onion instead of green since it's what I had on hand, and my zucchini was less than 1.5 lbs so I added an orange pepper which added some nice color.  Delish!

Made this again - still increased the spices, but this time used the full amount zucchini and green onions.   I also added a can of black beans to boost the protein with plans of making this a full vegetarian meal.  So good!

This is soooo good and fairly simple to make. I did follow the recipe however when I tasted it while it was cooking I felt like the  spices could be doubled. A lot of people that rated this recipe said the same thing, they are right.  The only spice I DIDN'T double was the garlic salt, I left it as is. My vegetarian daughter LOVED it. This would be good for all of you vegetarians out there. I will be making this quite often.

I absolutely love this!!!  I make a few tweaks to better suit my taste: double the spices- with the exception of the garlic salt, add a can of Rotel instead of the chopped tomatoes, and add squash  in addition to the zucchini  (and sometimes eggplant also).  To lower the fat I normally reduce the cheese or omit it entirely. The end result is a somewhat spicy wonderful veggie dish that I can eat as a meal all by itself!!!

I'd say 4 stars without any changes, so I rated it there. It's more of a side dish than a main course. I thought it could use a teeny bit more rice and an extra veggie or two (kept going back to the recipe to make sure I wasn't missing something because it seemed too scant.) I doubled the spices, added 3 more garlic cloves, and cooked the rice in a little veggie stock as suggested. Also used probably a cup of cheese instead of two. The spice combo though itself was delicious and my husband and I ate it up. 5 stars with changes.

Really good and I'll make again.  I used more rice than called for and also doubled the spices.  Used regular onion because I didn't have scallions.  I didn't have as much tomato as the recipe called for but used what I had and added mushrooms since I had them in the fridge. Everyone liked it.

Wonderful receipe with some tweeks. I used a brown rice blend that also included quinoa. Also roasted my veggies and included some brocolli.  Used less cheese to reduce the fat and used about 3/4 c. of plain greek yogurt.  The addition of yogurt not only made it a healthier recipe, it made the consistency moist and rich tasting.

I was pleasantly surprised. Of course I read the reviews, added dill weed, less oil, yellow onion instead of green, and much less cheddar on top. I wanted something light to go with a steak for two & there was a zucchini I wanted to incorporate into a meal. I liked it! Husband came back for seconds- always a good indicator.

This is a great recipe and versatile.  I didn't have quite enough zucchini the last time I made it, so filled in with yellow squash.  I used grape tomatoes cut in half, also, and didn't bother to remove the seeds.   Turned out fine.

Great start.  We add lots more rice though.  To add to the flavor we have tried peppers, and other items from our garden.  As it stands great if you add more rice.

The first time i made this I more or less followed the directions and it wound up pretty bland...so I tweaked it a bit a took some of the advice the other users gave, added some red pepper to it extra onions way more rice, I'm somebody who likes to have left overs. And doubled the spice measurements and it turned out better.

This has been a great guideline to a no fail dinner! I sub in whatever herbs/spices we feel like and use whatever cheese I have on hand. I also mix up the grains and often use quinoa or wild rice. The kids love helping with the recipe and there's something for everyone to help with (chopping zucchini,shredding cheese, etc.).

I am giving this 4 stars since my husband gave it a 4 but I only gave it a 3. It's technically a 3.5. I used quinoa instead of rice since we don't really use rice. I am familiar with the difference in flavor so am rating this recipe without the difference. The only other change is that I added more/different vegetables, fresh herbs (since that's what I had) and diced chicken. I, honestly, didn't like the paprika. I am a big paprika fan and this is the first time I've ever not liked the flavor of paprika in a meal. I will make this again because my husband really liked it but I may adjust the paprika.

My family loved this recipe! I took the suggestions of others and added chicken bullion and a little garlic powder to the rice.  I also doubled the spices, used garlic scapes instead of bulbs (it's what I had on hand) and used a can of stewed tomatoes.  A great way to use up veggies from my CSA.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I like this as an alternative to just plain rice.  I cooked my rice in chicken broth and added a little bit of salt and pepper after tasting it once I combined everything.  Also, I did not have cheddar cheese on hand so I used what I had which was an Italian Cheese Blend. I will make this again with the cheddar cheese.

It's summer, which means zucchini everywhere!  I had some giant zucchini and a few tomatoes from my brother's garden.  This was perfect!  I had some rice in the fridge that was already cooked.  I followed another reviewer's idea, and I added two pounds of shrimp (I sauteed them in a little oil with garlic powder, then added them before it all went in the baking dish.)  The kids gave it "infinite thumbs up."  I'll definitely add this to our rotation!

I went with the suggestion of adding bell pepper, doubling the spices (except the salt). I also added 1/4 cup onion in addition to the green onion. Very delicious recipe.

So simple and a great deal of the ingredients came from my garden. I modified it by using brown rice with chunks of ham (we like meat and it flavored the rice). I didn't measure any of the herbs so I'm sure I used more than suggested - I did cut back on the cheese. Huge hit and will certainly cook it again... and again.

I am a vegan so I made this recipe without the cheddar cheese and replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil and I also added yellow squash which really helped!

I really liked this recipe. I added parmesan to the rice mix and then put the cheddar on top. also I sliced the garlic instead of mincing but that's just my preference. overall I would definitely make this again!

Excellent and quite flavorful! Great with zuchinni but when out of season, asparagus was a great substitute. Cooked the rice in a rice cooker, makes it a little easier to manage with timetables of other dishes! Everyone loved it!

I loved the idea, and wanted to love the dish, but I just didn't. It started out tasty, mostly like zucchini and cheese, but as leftovers it was bland and pretty tasteless. It was also more zucchini than I thought, barely any rice. Next time I will try more rice and more spices as other reviewers suggested.

We added mushrooms, peppers, red onion, switched the cheese to mozzarella and white rice to brown, doubled the seasoning, but found it too salty using garlic salt so I prefer garlic powder.

I was running short on time before company came over and had a couple vegetables left in the fridge, and this recipe fit the bill perfectly. I substituted 1/2 cup brown rice instead of white rice, added 1/2 cup of white onions, added mushrooms and used aged coastal cheddar cheese. Like the other reviewers, I doubled the amount of spices. This turned out fantastic. My guest loved it! Will be making this recipe again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  Used jasmine rice, medium cheddar, and omitted the paprika 'cause we didn't have any.  Must say that none of the kids liked it though.

Very yummy. I love casseroles that do not use canned soups and processed foods (besides the cheese). I doubled the recipe and used wild rice (mixed w/brown rice), extra garlic, kale, and no tomatoes (my daughter doesn't like them). I also was sure to use all organic and non-gmo ingredients. Super tasty and healthy too!

An easy recipe to modify based on available ingredients and flavor favorites.  I used a frozen rice medley that only needed to be warmed instead of cooked - cut down on cooking time.  I used yellow and green zucchini and added sliced lipstick peppers. And I added to the amount of veggies.  Delicious!

There is a lot to love about this recipe! It's a great weekday meal - quick, easy, low calorie (& WW Points)very flavorful - especially if you increase the herbs & spices.  I usually use vegetable broth instead of water, sometimes add a little carrots or peas to add a little color & additional vegetable and use low fat cheese. I serve it as a meatless meal.

I made it for my family and they loved it! I did as commenters suggested and tripled the spices, except for the garlic salt, and cooked the rice in chicken broth. I also used jalapeno Monterey Jack cheese which went really well with the dish. Great dish!

I would definitely make this again; however, I did read all the reviews and added what I thought was appropriate.  The seasoning was so yummy.  I added a crouton(GF) tomato cheese topping and this is definitely a keeper! I also had some cilantro lime rice leftover and it REALLY added flavor!  YUM,

I followed this recipe loosely, meaning I didn't really measure out the seasonings, I utilized Italian squash instead of zucchini and I put it over grilled chicken breasts.  It turned out magnificently!

Delicious! Colorful! A+ for versatility! Threw in some leftover smoked turkey kielbasa for the carnivores, used half Cajun for seasoning, and Colby-jack cheese (on hand) ... Thinking this would also be a great filling for stuffed peppers or squash, with or without bulk sausage tossed in. Great Recipe!

This was pretty good, except I tweaked it a little. I used both zucchini and squash. I also had fresh tomatoes so I ran the, through the food processor and added them. I used more rice, added breadcrumbs and instead of cheddar cheese used Parmesan. Came out delicious!

Loved this recipe! I pan fried 3 chicken breasts in panko crumbs. Then followed the recipe.  I also used coconut oil instead of olive oil, since that's all I have. Made a little more rice than the recipe said, about 1/2 Cup. I also made it all in one(cast iron skillet)pan, which is a plus. Less dishes. Love finding ways to use my garden zucchini. This one is a keeper and plan to make it ALL the time!! Thanks for sharing DebiMcG

This turned out delish! I did do more rice like suggested and subbed oregano basil for itialian seasoning. I added garlic salt paprika and cumin to rice while it was cooking and also added cumin to the veggies!  Instead if cheddar we used parmasean. Will definitely keep this one in my pocket!  This is a lot like one I already make minus rice with black and kidney beans. You can also add some sliced itialian sausage to make it a meal ;)

Delicious!  A great way to finish up leftover rice and whatever vegetables you have on hand.  I added more garlic but otherwise mostly stuck with the recipe and my family loved it.  Add a salad for a light meal.

This was a very good recipe. Like the other reviewers, I added red bell pepper, olive oil instead of vegetable, onion instead of green onion and upped the garlic and spices. I wished I would have put less cheese in it as it turned out a little greasy, and think I would try mozzarella instead of cheddar next time. Overall, a great, easy recipe that can be easily modified.

I tripled the season, added bell pepper, used quinoa instead of rice, and added a pound of ground turkey.  Out of all my favorite quinoa recipes I make, this was my favorite.  So full of taste!  Even my 1 year old ate it up.  oh, and I only used 1 cup shredded cheddar.

Wow!  That was surprisingly amazing!  We did make a few adjustments.

We used 1/2 cup brown rice instead of white rice, yellow onion instead of the green onion, and added mushrooms instead of tomatoes.  It was amazing!

(Also, we did NOT double the spices.  It did not need it.)

My family loved this. And it got my husband to eat zucchini. I thought that it was a little salty and my rice needed to be cooked a little longer. By the time it was ready there was ZERO moisture in it, so next time I will have to adjust a little.

I like this. Quick, easy, tasty, and hearty. I didn't have green onions, so I sub with green pepper. I double the rice, and instead of regular cheese, I used Daiya chedder-style cheese to make it vegan. If you haven't tried vegan cheese, I definitely recommend giving it a try, I think it taste better. Yum!

I followed others suggestions of adding 3x the herbs except the salt and increased the rice to 1/2 cup.  I think this is ok, just not a favorite

I used 2 cups of grated zucchini and 3/4 cup chopped carrots.  I also cut back on the cheese a little bit and used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella.  We really enjoyed this.  Thanks! I am making it again tonight!

I am absolutely in love with this recipe! However, I did change just a few things. As recommended, I add chicken bullion to the rice while cooking it, and I double all of the added spices. I also add turkey (or chicken, but turkey is better) before I bake it. Letting it sit over night before you bake it also gives it a much richer flavor! My daughter loves this recipe and she's only four!

This recipe is pretty good but I find that 2 cups of cheese is too much.  It makes things too oily.  So I cut down on the cheese and double the herbs.

I followed tips used by others and make a couple other modifications: I used low fat cheese and used Mrs Dash seasoning since I didn't have paprika and oregano and did 1/2c of brown rice - it turned out very tasty and healthy!

Okay, this dish was so delicious that it almost didn't make it as far as the oven.  Moreover, I came this close to omitting the rice and cheese!  I used a regular onion, a bunch of fresh mushrooms, half a red pepper, lots of fresh garlic, 1 30-oz .can of diced tomatoes, drained, and the spices called for in the recipe (only more of them).  I also added about 1/4 C. of good-quality dry sherry when the veggies were crisp tender.  I could've stopped right there, it was so good.  One taste, and I was hooked, but decided to use the rice and cheese, since I wanted to experience the entire recipe.  
Can't wait until my garden produces red tomatoes, which will really add to the flavor.  And btw, I used homemade chicken broth for my brown rice (doubled the recipe for rice).  This will become a regular at our house!

Had really nice color and flavor. Will definately be making again but as a side dish. I made the mistake of making it the main course and it's definately made to be a side dish! Overall, very good!

So Tasty! I was a little worried that the rice wasnt enough, but was just fine as called for. Made just as called for except for the onion (I used white onion in place of the green).

I made this recipe last night and it turned out great.  I followed a few suggestions I read in the reviews and I was very pleased with the results.  My modifications were: increase to 1 cup rice, cooked in 2 cups chicken broth, triple seasonings except for garlic salt

I didn't measure how much cheese I put on top of the casserole.  I put just enough to cover the top a little bit.
This is a great veggie recipe, which is awesome for times when I don't feel like eating a heavy meaty dish.

I thought this was great and I will be making it often. I do not care for rice, but there is not a lot in this recipe and I think I might even add more next time I make it. I used Arborio rice cooked in chicken broth since that was my quickest cooking rice in the house. I followed a few reviewers’ suggestions and tripled the basil, paprika, and oregano. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt since that is what I had on hand. I used all the other quantities specified in this recipe and baked it for 20 minutes. I found the zucchini to still be firmer than I prefer, so I baked it an additional 20 minutes (40 total). I have eaten this as a side dish with both pasta with meatballs, and chicken enchiladas. It really complemented both dishes. I can’t wait to try this with other vegetables like eggplant, yellow squash, sweet peppers, etc. It’s such a good base recipe that you can vary it based on what you have in your fridge and what is in season.

I made this exactly as directed and found it to be very bland and not good at all.  Somehow, the textures didn't go together well, especially the rice, tho how anything with rice, tomatoes and cheese can be bad I don't know.

I love this recipe!  I upped the amount of rice to 3/4 cup, cooked in 1-1/2 cups of water.  I also left out the oregano, and used two tbs of fresh basil, and 2 tbs fresh parsley.

Everybody raved!  I cooked it alongside some baked chicken, seasoned with salt, pepper and rosemary.

Wow this was truly wonderful. I took other's advice and doubled the spices. So glad i did. My carnivore husband didn't even notice it had no meat! I will have to double the recipe next time. Leftovers would have been nice.

I got this recipe in my inbox the other day and tried it for a picnic last night.  It was a big hit!  Everyone loved it.  I did add additional garlic and used less cheese.  I think it would have been nice with a touch of hot sauce too.  :). Very good recipe and i think it will be nice to play with also. Thanks

Fabulous.  I used half small zucchini and half yellow squash.  The cheese seemed like a lot so I cut in down a little.  A keeper.

Delicious! I added more garlic and herbs like the other reviews said, and also more rice. I was worried before I put it in the oven because it smelled reeeally garlicy, but it was perfect coming out of the oven. Great way to eat all your veggies:)

I made this for a main dish and was concerned that it wouldn't be hearty enough.  I served it with a garden salad and it was a wonderful, hearty meal.  We didn't miss the meat! The spice mixture works very well.  As other reviewers recommended, I doubled the rice.  The only other change I made was to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I will definitely make this again (with the doubled rice & olive oil)

I really liked this recipe. Lots of flavor. I think next time I am going to double the rice. There wasn't much in there. I think it's more like 4 servings, so double if you want more.

This is a great recipe! Like many of the reviewers I doubled the spices and used a half cup of rice. I also added some fresh corn from the garden. I will definitely make this again.

This is ok.  I also doubled most of the spices because it seemed to need the flavor.  My husband and I both agree that the cheese didn't add much to this.  It seemed to confuse the dish.  The rest of my family doesn't like zucchini so I grated it to make it finer and blend in more.  Overall, just an ok dish that no one was excited about but it was edible.

Fantastic.  Tripled the garlic instead of using garlic salt. Used 1/2 cup mix of chopped fresh basil/oregano.  Used 1/2 chopped pepper and whole white onion instead of green. Cooked brown rice in beef broth. Skipped any cheese in the mix and just added two slices of mozzarella, cut into strips and latticed over the top.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Wonderful use of fresh garden veggies and surprisingly filling.

Delicious and easy! Like others stated, double the spices and more rice. Next time I will add bell pepper and jalapeños, and use less cheese.

ThIs recipe is sooooooo good!!! Kids ate it up. We used zukes and tomatoes from our garden. For those whose recipe is turning out watery, I am thinking that you did not seed your tomatoes.  Very important. Just quarter your tomatoes and scoop the seeds out with a spoon.  Then chop the tomatoes.

We used white rice the first time which is delicious, and then a bistro blend rice the second time which has a variety of different rides and wheat berries. That one was our favorite!!  Great find in a recipe.

Good use of zucchini - glad I read reviews first. I tripled spices and rice, added a few more pinches of crushed red pepper (we like things spicy in this house), added more sharp cheddar for baking and pepper jack cheese for the table. I plan to prepare this dish again.

I only used around 1 lb. of zucchini which I felt was plenty.  This was a very flavorful way of using up all that summer zucchini.  Definitely one I'll make again!

I made it for the 3rd time tonight and it came out great. 1st time I made the recipe as written and it was good but it needed to be tweeked for my taste.
I don't like garlic salt so that had to go and the oregano was a little too strong.  I added a few teas. of olive oil to a saucepan and added 1/2 cup of medium grain rice, stirring to coat all grains of rice. Toast for a few minutes stirring often. Added 1 cup low sodium chicken broth and bring to boil uncovered (do not stir) and let boil til liquid is even with the rice. Lower heat to low and cover for 10 minutes. If all liquid is cooked out, turn off and remove from burner leaving the pot covered. After 10 minutes remove cover and fluff rice.
For the rest of the recipe I used only 1 tbls of oil, 1/2 cup onion, 3 zucchini, 1/2 cup green onions, 2 garlic cloves, 1 teas. basil, 1 teas paprika, 1/4 teas oregano, 3 tomatoes and 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese. This was excellent without the garlic salt and just a little oregano for those that found the oregano overpowering.

My family loved this recipe. I used all fresh veggies and herbs from my garden. Light, beautiful flavor. The bread can get pretty soggy with leftovers but no one seemed to mind- and the leftovers were gone within two days! I will make again.

Even after tripling seasonings, adding twice the onion (one large sweet onion) and three times the garlic, and using Italian-favored diced tomatoes rather than fresh, we still found this to be rather bland and had quite a bit left over, which is unusual in our family! DH and I discussed it and agreed to totally change the flavor of the leftovers with Rotel tomatoes and green chilies, about 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1 tablespoon of chili powder, with maybe a garnish of a bit of chili powder sprinkled over the cheddar cheese on top. I think I'll try adding about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of thawed whole kernel corn, also. This is definitely a work in progress for us!

As the recipe stands it's quite bland, I would follow other reviewers advice and double the seasoning and add more garlic next time. The zucchini was a bit crunchy for me, next time I'll have to cook it longer. It's a good baseline recipe for something great!

I feel like it was missing something. But overall it was really yummy. I would make mine without so much zucchini, because I am not a big fan of zucchini.

WOW!! We loved this. It's different from anything I've made before and it was relatively simple. I used a bag of Success brown rice and 3 zucchini, a bunch of green onions, and 1 tomato peeled, seeded, and chopped. I actually meant to put in 2 tomatoes but forgot. The spices are perfect and the flavor is awesome!!

This was just OK for us.  I increased the rice to 1/2 cup uncooked, subbed a red onion for the green and used mozzarella instead of cheddar.  I think the cheddar would be better - it's more zesty.  Other than that, this just seemed a bit bland to us.

We thought this was very good.  I did double the amount of rice and added all the cheese to the casserole instead of topping it with half of the cheese.  I also added some sliced fresh mushrooms.  This was an excellent side dish with our grilled barbecued chicken breasts, rosemary dinner rolls and fresh strawberry shortcake.  I'll definitely make this again.

Best vegetarian casserole ever!  I skipped the garlic and it was still very tasty.  Also, canned tomotoes worked fine.  For those who find it bland, it may be due to the kind of oil used.  I used avocado oil.

Made this on a whim...I incorporated some spicy yellow curry in with zucchini mixture and added some fresh basil and some extra garlic. Also the picture looked served with kilbalsi so added that as a side. Absolutely a winner in this household! A little time consuming bit enjoyed making something new. Thanks.

My husband and I really liked this dish.  I used brown rice instead of white . I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used diced canned (drain) I also used extra seasoning. We were very happy how it turned out and will make again.

Tasty, quick prep!  I doubled the herbs, tripled the garlic, and tripled the rice (I use brown basmati). Added red pepper for color.   Half the cheese, and this is a healthy, filling meal!

What a great recipe! I used quinoa instead of rice and it was perfect. Although I loved the cheese, I think you could get away with less and it would be fine. Definitely will be making this again!!

Excellent! My hubby raved about it too. I used minute rice with chicken broth instead of water, part green onions and part regular onions. I'm not sure how much zucchini in weight, but three small zucchinis. Used 2 tsp jarred garlic, and doubled the basil, paprika (just regular--I've not heard of sweet paprika) and oregano. Used three Roma tomatoes and did not seed them. Used about 3/4 cup cheese in the dish, and probably close to a cup on the top. Yummy! My hubby wants me to make more dishes like this one. Thank, DebiMcG!

I made this for my boyfriend tonight. Just the two of us at the whole thing! It was really yummy! As suggested below I doubled the seasoning. I used normal brown onion instead of green onion as i had none and I added Bacon!! The boyfriend said he was very happy I added Bacon! Great Recipe!

I think zucchini is my new favorite vegetable! I was a little apprehensive about this recipe, only because I love love love meat and was afraid this recipe wouldn't be enough without it-WRONG! This dish was amazing. I also doubled the seasonings, but that was it. So yummy, I could easily eat this a few times a week. Thanks!

I doubled the rice and added salt, but excluded the cheese because my boyfriend doesn't like cheese (!). It was even better the next day when I added Old Bay and cooked shrimp to it! A delicious and easy meal. My boyfriend said it was one of the best meals I've ever made...and he's incredibly picky!

Hello....I made this last night...I cut it down to about 3-4 servings....It was great.....I have only myself to cook for these days and I'm putting a serving inside the freezer to have for workday lunch soon....(I used instant brown rice and cut back a smidgen on the garlic salt...personal preference).....I've not been a fan of zucchini except for hiding it in bread, etc.....I know I'll make this again!     thanks for sharing.....

The kids didn't like the look of it . They're used to wht rice. They won't even eat chinese fried rice. however ranging from ages 5-12 ,2 out of 3 kids liked . Both hubby and I enjoyed as something different to do with rice and it tasted good . I think it wasthe cheese which allowed the kids to enjoy . Not so good as reg leftovers w a meal the next day . Although it might be good over the eggs as suggested. I will try this again some day. Thank you !

My family loves this recipe!  I didn't see zucchini on my parents table so I had to look up some recipes.  My family loves this recipe!  Of course, I have changed it a little.  I usually double the rice and have on another occasion even cooked the rice in chicken broth and added 3 sauted and cubed chicken.  No other mods are needed.

i honestly didnt think i my family and i would like this dish because we arent big veggie eaters, but it was great.  i doubled the spices (except garlic salt) and used petite diced canned tomatoes to speed up the process.  my family loves cheese, so we didnt think 2 cups was too much at all, but to be healthier i will decrease it by half a cup next time.  the casserole was watery even though i drained the tomatoes - but bread was good to soak it up.  next time i will drain the tomatoes even better i guess.  i did add precooked small shrimp (about 1.5 cups) since we are meat eaters and my husband said it would be a good recipe to add any kind of meat to.  oh, i think next time i will make more brown rice too (double) - couldnt really tell that there was rice in the casserole it was such a small amount.   thanks for the recipe!

Great casserole, and good way to use up zucchini. The tomato, cheese, and Italian herb flavors remind me of pizza. I think this would be a hit with kids. I've made this several times now and these are the changes I've settled on: 1) use 3/4 C of cheese - it's healthier and just the right amount of cheesiness 2) always make a double batch - the original is a pretty small recipe 3) add any other veggies I want to clear out of the fridge 4) skip the baking step - it's not necessary and just heats up the kitchen more.

I love zucchini and cheddar cheese, but something about this dish just didn't seem "right" to my family.  It was okay. Can't say I would make it again and If I do I would try it with Parmesan or an italian cheese blend.  The combination of spices and cheese just didn't go really well together and we are pretty easy to please.  The only change I made was using brown rice.

My husband and I loved this "casserole" though our kids weren't too fond of it.  It was easy and delicious.  Added a lot more spices because when "taste tested" it seemed VERY bland.  Would absolutely make this again.  We served it as a side dish along side chicken and salad.

As a huge fan of all cheeses, I never thought I would think something was too cheesy.  This dish was the first.  I was hesitant about so little rice but it ended up being the perfect amount.  Great dish for using those zucchini's that are in the fridge before they go bad just maybe use half the cheese.

As per other reviewers I doubled the spices, I cheated and used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, & I added squash as well.  Other than that I did as instructed.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This casserole tastes great.  I made it for my 15 month old and he loved it.  I did use brown rice, and doubled the amount of rice noted in the recipe.  For a lower calorie version I would use less cheese next time - it is definitely cheesy.  I also doubled the amount of tomatoes.

NOt sure why this is rated so highly - anything would be palatable with so much cheese on it.  I doubled the herbs and garlic called for and used brown rice.  The flavor was good but not great or outstanding.

Delicious!! I agree with other posters that you can half the cheese and double the veggies. I added mushrooms and a little bit of chopped onion, and I used brown rice instead. Will definitely be making it again!

I added some feta cheese at the very end of the bake time and broiled until brown and crispy, about 3 min. If the feta is salty enough you can skip most of the salt in the recipe. Delicious!!

This was very good.  I used whole grain rice to make it a bit healthier.  I followed others suggestions of tripling the seasonings....It turned out to be a bit much-I think doubling would be sufficient.  I will make this again-it's a good side dish and I get in ruts when it comes to finding new and good side dishes so this is a keeper.

This is my second time making this (the first time I made it as directed and gave it a 3 stars). This time, I added a bit more paprika and salt&pepper, as well as more cheese.  Servings are on the small side, but serve the casserole over a bed of rice and it's perfect!

I loved this casserole made it a few times now. Added chicken and other fresh veggies that needed to be used up. Halfed the cheese, I love cheese but was looking for something healthier and it turned out to be enough for me. My toddler ate this up both times I have made it.

I liked this very much. I agree with everyone that tripling the spices is definitely the way to go. I also added more vegetables: green pepper, spinach, corn and used a can of diced tomatoes. The only thing is that all these extra fresh vegetables made the casserole a little bit soggy.  The left overs were delicious... maybe even better!

This was a pretty good recipe. It was great to make for a large crowd as I doubled the recipe. I used half brown rice and half white rice. I also used a little more rice than the recipe called for. I followed the advice from other reviews to triple the seasonings. It turned out very flavorful and cheesy. A real crowd pleaser.

This recipe is awesome! I have made this dish many times and change it up each time. Last week I added fresh green beans from the garden to the zucchini as it cooked and the week before I added carrots. It's a great take-along lunch and so healthy! Thanks, it's a keeper!

Very tasty, I will definitely make it again. I added some red pepper flakes, and three cloves of garlic for more flavour, shrimp to make it a more complete meal, and half a red bell pepper. I also used 1/2 cup rice, as some reviewers suggested. My vegeratian boyfriend loved it, and he is a picky eater.

I read alot of reviews..and did bump up the spice level and certainly the garlic level.  Used every bit of the cheese noted in the recipe..sorry..this was bland..very bland.  I salted and peppered several times..the old building of flavors.  I really expected something tasty..but it was not to be.  It was a stomach filler for sure...brown rice is the best..but I won't be making this again.  I'll try something that involves roasting veggies first then adding rice..brussel spouts come to mind...hmmmmmm,

Very good!  Meat-loving hubby loved it and is taking leftovers to work tomorrow with some diced chicken in it.  I followed the recipe except I used fresh basil and packaged saffron rice.  It was a bit runny but I was in a hurry and didn't de-seed the tomatoes as well as I could have.  A great way to use up garden veggies.  Will definitely make this again.

Very tasty! Used long grain wild rice instead of white and would recommend cutting back on the cheese a little to make it healthier. Great way to use up some summer veggies!

I thought this was really delicious and easy to make!  Followed other people's suggestions and increased the amount of rice to 1/2 cup and cooked it with a little boullion.  Added half a red pepper and used grape tomatoes. I also tripled the minced garlic and doubled the oregano, basil and paprika. Lastly, I mixed one cup of cheese into the casserole and then sprinkled a couple handfuls on top.  Really yummy!

A versatile recipe I see a lot of potential for.  I'd like to try it as a garden burrito filling, or as an Italian dish with basil, oregano, orzo, and Parmesan Reggiano.  Maybe even try topping with french-fried onion rings or breadcrumbs for a crunch.  It's a great start!  (I agree with other reviewers - be sure to double the herbs and garlic!!)

This was good - unfortunately right as I started making it I realized I was out of zucchini! I subbed a squash and half a red pepper. I thought it turned out pretty good - it did need a little heat so next time I will add some red pepper flakes or more garlic to the sauteed veggies. Will definitely make it again!

This was awesome.  I used brown rice and EVOO for the oil.  I added a chicken boullion cube to the rice while cooking.  I used my home canned tomatoes.  It was delicious and easy.  I will definately make again.

This was good, I didn't have rice on hand so I just left it out but I think it would be really good with it. I used two zuc. and two yel. squash. Next time I will add the tomato to the top when I add the extra cheese to the top, I hate mushy tomoatoes. This was seasoned just right. I didn't bake for 20 min. just until the cheese melted on top about 5-7 minutes.

Definitely recommend doubling the herbs.  Next time I'll try it with a little more rice.

I followed other's suggestions and doubled up on the herbs and I thought it was a little too much.  I think even if I had followed the instructions exactly it would still have been just an ok recipe for us.

This was very good. I added chopped chicken breast and made a meal out of it. Great way to use up that garden zucchini!  Thank you!

Great recipe.  It's Zucchini season and what do you do with all the zucchini?  Make this recipe.  My husband doesn't like zucchini but loved this recipe, says it was a perfect combination of herbs, veggies, and rice.  Will definately make again.  Maybe less cheese next time.

This was an okay recipe that has potential. Now that I have made it once, I think I will make some changes and try it again. I read the other reviews so I doubled the spices, however mine turned out extremely salty! I will also definitely add more rice next time! It had a bit of a soupy consistency when I took it out of the oven, so I crushed up some buttery crackers and sprinkled them on top and baked it another 5 minutes. This helped. I did substitute olive oil for the veg oil and also used summer squash along with the zucchini and only used 1 cup of cheese (cheddar/jack). (I am a cheese lover, but I felt that 1 cup was plenty).

I did make some changes per other reviews.  I used about 3/4 cup rice, added bell peppers and increased the garlic to 4 cloves.  I also used provalone, swiss and mozzarella.  It was delish.

Very good- per some of the other reviews, I just seasoned to taste, which was probably quite a bit more than the recipe calls for. Excellent way to use zucchini and very simple- I even used one of the boil-in-a-bag rice bags and it was the perfect size!

This was a huge hit at our house even though I had to leave out the cheese to make it dairy-free due to allergies.  I added Italian sausage crumbles to compensate but wish I hadn't because the kids just picked out the zucchini and gobbled it up.  I did double the spices as suggested and would recommend that change.  Will make again and again all summer and probably blanch and freeze zucchini just for this recipe.   Thanks!

Great potluck dish.  Took previous reviewers advice about seasoning.  At least tripled everything but the salt.  Made the rice with broth and used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes.  Substitued half a vidalia onion for the green onions.  Also used less cheese.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I used leftover rice and skipped the garlic powder.  I used zucchini, yellow squash, carrots, green pepper, & onion.  Since I had no fresh tomatoes, I added chunky homemade salsa to the mixture.  I topped it with bread crumbs and parmesian cheese.  The salsa really kicked up the spices.

I gave this four stars because it was very good, but with alterations.  I pretty much tripled the spices.  I didn't have garlic salt, so just used garlic powder and then some salt.  Also used garlic powder in place of the minced garlic.  I did use the listed amount of cheese because I knew that was the only way to get my son to give it a try.  He, the vegetable hater, ate everything but the tomatoes.  This was the first time I could get this 14-yr-old to eat zucchini, and he even had seconds!  Delicious.

This was delicious. I doubled the amount of rice then added in some yellow squash, onion, and red pepper. I used an aged Vermont cheddar (a little less than what's called for) and it was delicious. My husband requested it be added to the weekly roster.

This was really delicious, my husband and I both enjoyed it. I also halved the cheese and added more spices (like other reviewers) and I used red bell pepper instead of tomato because I didn't have any tomatoes on hand - I think the red peppers worked really well.

Good basic recipe, I double the spices, add red peppers,and  cooked the rice with chipotle buillon. I used olive oil to sautee veggies, added I container of philladelphia with jalapeno . I was afraid it was not going to have concistency so I added 6 eggs to the mix and topped it off with parmesan and bread crumbs .For garnishment I used cilantro.Excellent !Thank you for the recipe

So good! As others did, I doubled the garlic and spices/seasonings- it needed it for sure.  I also added about 1/2 cup feta I had leftover, which made it a little richer, and I also added a few chopped mushrooms, and about a cup of chopped brocolli.  Wonderful!  My boyfriend said it was one of his faves.

Surprisingly delicious- I was doubtful about the small amount of rice it calls for but it's comes together perfectly. the combo of the sauteed/baked veggies and cheese is great.  I added red bell peppers and doubled spices.  The next day we added diced jalapenos for extra kick.  Great side to serve with any protein- even for the people that don't love zucchini, they will enjoy this.

I thought this dish was delicious, easy to make and I'll certainly make it again. However it's probably a recipe that I suggest you make once and then begin to experiment with. ie. The idea of serving it with a soup sounds great! (as per one of the photos)

What a fabulous dish. Gave it a 4-star only because of the changes/increases I made to the recipe (used vegetable stock instead of water/doubled the basil,sweet paprika & oregano/only used half tsp garlic salt/and 1.5 cups of cheese/added 1 cup of thickly sliced mushrooms) as suggested by other reviewers otherwise it would've been a resounding 5-star. Thanx DebiMcG! Cheers :o)

Love it! Completely!  Delicious, delicious!  Extra garlic and  spicier cheese add awesome flavor.  Have made it several times,  and its pretty robust to changes in ingredients,  try different types / amounts of rice + different veggies.

My changes were: 1 cup cooked brown rice; a bit less zucchini; a teaspoon dried chopped onion; one can diced tomatoes, drained; less cheese; and the addition of some chopped leftover roasted chicken.  I cooked everything on the stove, and instead of stirring in the cheese I just sprinkled it on top and then left the lid on for a minute to melt it.  No need to dirty a baking dish.  Very tasty!

I read previous reviews and I followed them. It was fantastic but I am not giving it a 5-star rating because it needed to be adjusted. I triples the spice, except salt, added red bell peppers, cooked the rice in veggie broth and used orgnanic monterrey jack cheese. It was excellent as left overs the next day as well.

This is really yummy!!! But I needed to add a ton more spices. I used sea salt instead and broiled the cheese at the end  with some Italian seasoning and a little extra salt on top of the cheese. Really good to serve with sausage!

This recipe was good, but not excellent.  I normally try to follow the recipe exactly, but after reading reviews, I did double all the spices.  It was still pretty bland.  I may make it again, b/c it's a family friendly veggie dish, but it needs SOMETHING...just not sure what.

Excellent! I doubled it because it didn't seem like enough rice... and it wasn't.  I could eat this every other night!  Be sure not to overcook the zucchini. It tastes much better a little crunchy.

Thought this was pretty good. Not the best, but good. Like others, I did reduce the cheese at first, and ended up putting most of it back in after taking a few bites, but even then it seemed to be lacking a little something. Will try again, adding some more spices, and possibly broccoli or peppers.

This recipe tasted great after some changes. As others suggested, I added an extra two cloves of garlic and doubled the other spices. I also used an Italian-blend shredded cheese mix instead of cheddar (I had some leftover in the fridge), and I thought it complimented the other flavors well. Oh, and I also upped the rice to a 1/2 cup, and next time I might use even more to make the dish a bit more filling (and because I love rice). Served for dinner with some crusty bread. It was a nice change from the usual meat and potatoes.

Oh my gosh-this was wonderful!!  What a great way to use up my zucchini and tomatoes from the garden.  Had 15 people over for dinner and made this as a side dish (I doubled the recipe) and everyone was fighting over it!  I did use 4 cloves of garlic and about double all the spices, but we like things spicy around here.  So good-next time I might try to add sausage or something and make it a main dish.

This wasn't too bad although it was a bit bland. We added some jalapeno ranch dressing and that helped. I will make this again but probably as a side dish rather than the main dish. My family all really liked it though.

I never thought I would say this, but, "way too much cheese!"  I used 1.5 cups and think it still could be cut back.  Nontheless, I love cheese and I loved this recipe!  Will be making again!

Really glad I read the reviews! Based on other's suggestions, I doubled the rice and doubled or trippled the herbs and spices and garlic.  I also added a green pepper to the zucchini mixture.

Rave reviews at the dinner table and a second helpings all around!

This recipe was delicious with the following modifications - double spices and garlic (but not the salt!), use about 2 cups cooked long grain brown rice, add 1/2 diced bell pepper, and sub yellow onion for the green.  I also used 2c. of mozzarella and colby cheese instead of cheddar.

I don't think this would have been very tasty as written.  As suggested by other reviewers, I tripled the spices (and garlic), used 1/2 c brown rice, and only 1 c cheese.  Still, it was just okay.  I'll eat the leftovers tomorrow, but I don't think anyone else will be joining me.  DH cleaned his plate but suggested it tasted how he thought prison food might taste, should the prison garden experience a bumper crop of zucchini.

Really good! A very nice change from ordinary everyday side dishes. I did use quite a lot of the herbs (didn't measure), and I added chicken bouillon powder to the zucchini and herb mixture. I thought it had a very nice flavor.

I like this recipe a lot, but my family was not a fan.  I doubled the tomatoes, added an entire yellow onion, tripled the spices and garlic and reduced the cheese by half.  My family complained that it was bland, but I thgouht it was pretty good, especially for such a healthy dish!  Next time I think I will add mushrooms and maybe some eggplant as well.

Great recipe to use up some of the abundance of zucchini I have from the garden! Very tasty. I did tweak some of the herbs, spices and garlic to suite my tastes. Plus I added more cheese! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband who isn't a squash fan loved this recipe.  I lightly sauteed the squash/onion which gave it a little more crunch.  After mixing all ingredients, I refridgerated and later cooked at 350 for about 50 minutes.  An easy way to have a good meal on a busy night.

Great recipe.  Delicious, healthy, easy.  I doubled the herbs (not the salt!) and garlic.  Only had one zucchini, so I added 2 stalks of celery.  Used olive oil and increased rice to 1/2 cup.  Topped with hot pepper cheese.  Perfect!

Very good! Made this last night, hubby was skeptical at first because he isn't a huge zucchini fan... makes me wonder why he keeps planting so many :P but he really liked it.  I increased the garlic and topped the casserole with fried onion rings + the cheese. Very nice, thank you!

This did not get rave reviews by my family, however they are tough to please w/ cooked veg. dishes, they thought it was OK. I grew up w/ eating zucc. and loved this. I did double the garlic and spices and omitted the oregano per other reviews. I used 1/2 the cheese and thought the rice issue others spoke of was fine - it is personal pref.  I think next time I make this I will use feta cheese. Good starter recipe to build off of.

I've been looking for some diabetic friendly dishes, and this was perfect!  I took other reviewers advice, tripled the herbs and garlic, used two tablespoons of fresh basil, and subbed organic brown rice.  I only had a mixture of mexican cheeses, and decided to use that.  This was awesome!  My husband loved it too. Has a very italian flare to it (even with the mexican cheeses!) I'm having some of the leftovers today with some chicken, and it tastes just as good as last night.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I added a little extra rice and 2 cut up chicken breasts.  I think that improved it.  Too much zucchini and the tomatoes were pointless.  Also, kinda a pain to make, since you have to cook everything first.  I won't make this again.

This was wonderful!  I added chicken breast to mine because we are meat eaters.  I also doubled the amount of rice to 2/3 cups of rice with 1 1/3 cup of water/broth.  Very colorful dish besides being yummy!

This was a great idea! I did change a few things, because I wanted it to be a more colorful dish. I added a cup of shredded carrots, 1/2 cup of endame, and a cup of sweet Vidalia onions. I also doubled the herbs so that it had more flavor. I used a bag of frozen zucchini and that worked great as well. My husband loved it, as did I. Leftovers were excellent, I will definately make this again, and I think that you can add whatever veggies you have around.

I was a little nervous after reading the reviews that this would be bland & lacking, but I was pleasantly suprised. I thought it had a really good combination of flavors. It's a great easy weeknight dinner and I think it's really versatile in that you could use a lot of different veggies. I think it would be good with chicken too.

A Keeper!!!  This turned out to be a great meal.  I adjusted it to our tastes and this is what I did.  Increased instant brown rice to 6 servings and cooked in chicken stock.  Sauted zucchini, yellow squash,onion, red pepper, fresh garlic in olive oil.  Seasoned with dried italian seasoning and fresh basil.  Added a can of drained italian style tomatoes since mine aren't in yet.  Stirred in rice, cooked shrimp, and mozzerella and parmasean cheese.  Topped with more cheese and italian bread crumbs and baked for about 25 minutes.  This was flavorful and filling.  You could really play with this and use what you have on hand.  Thanks.

This was a great recipe!  Most of the ingredients came right out of the garden!  I added some orange bell peppers since we had them.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  I'm certain we will use this one again!

the only change i made was double the rice and used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh, it is a very tasty dish and I think the seasonings are just right, no need to add anything at all
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

As is this recipe is 3 stars and very bland. However, with modifications it's 4-5. Double the spices, except the salt and you have a good dish full of vegetables.

This is absolutely delicious! After reading several of the reviews, I added more spice and didn't use as much cheese. Eveyone loved it and it's become a regular part of our weekday dinner rotation.

This was good!  I tripled the spices (except garlic salt), added two additional cloves of garlic, used less oil, 1/2 cup of brown rice cooked in broth, and 1 1/2 cup cheese.  My husband and I ate the entire thing for dinner b/c I didn't make anything else to go with it.  Could add a variety of veggies but the tomatoes are a must!

My family loved this recipe. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh with  Italian seasonings, and I only had enough cheddar for the inside of the casserole so I used mozzarella on top and it was wonderful. Also I used 1/2 cup rice and fresh herbs. I will definetly make this again.

So disappointing!  I used farm fresh produce. After reading AR reviews, I used quick cooking brown rice and doubled the spices.  I also used high quality cheese.  Unfortunately, it was tasteless.

This was very good though not as flavorful as we might have liked.  Used canned tomatoes instead of fresh.  I think next time I'll try it with the Mexican flavored tomatoes to see how the green chilis add to the flavor.  Still something we will make again.

Excellent with a few changes. I cooked about 1 cup dry brown rice in 3 cups chicken broth instead of water. I used lots of fresh oregano and also a handful of fresh cilantro. Also added more dried basil....maybe 1 tsp. Definately will make this again!!!

My husband LOVES this, but wanted more rice in it. So I did the next time I made it, and it was a hit. I also added one red bell pepper. It's a great side dish.

My family loved this dish.  I used brown rice, added bell peppers, half a cup of millet and only used 3/4 cup of cheese.  I also sauteed the veggies in olive oil that I had browned my pork chops in to give the veggies extra flavor.

Yummy! This was an excellent side dish, and could make a great main dish too.  Even the kids loved it!  I read the reviews before making it, so I doubled the spices, and cut back on the cheese.  I also used instant brown rice, which worked well.  The leftovers were fabulous also.  This really makes a lot, so it would be great for a potluck, or for guests.  I will definitely make this again, and may add more/different veggies to make it even healthier.  Thanks!

Let me just say WOW! We added mushrooms and yellow squash, and used more rice and cheese than the recipe called for. We also added seasoned and sauteed chicken. This is an All-Time favorite casserole dish! No need to look else where.

This was really good, even my boyfriend liked it!  I added some cubed chicken to it (for the boy) and some mushrooms as well.  I would probably add a bit more rice next time.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I doubled most of the ingredients (especially the spices) except the cheese and I used a can of diced Italian tomatoes and my jarred garlic; I also added a pound of chicken.  As I had mentioned you can cook the zucchini separately and only put it in half of the casserole and everyone will enjoy it for those picky eaters! It is a really amazing recipe that is easy.

I have used this recipe several times and it is a hit with my non-casserole-eating family.  I usually double the recipe and use diced regular onion instead of green (just because it is regularly on hand) and it comes out great.  I have also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh when I was out.  I could tell a difference, but it was still delicious.

Great recipe. I wanted to make it more of a meal, so I added over 2 cups of cooked brown rice. I also browned some chicken breast, cut it up and added it. I used bery little cheese and just sprinkled parmesan on top right before eating. I also added lots of seasoning to taste. It was a really yummy dinner, even my 22 month old ate it all right up!

My family loved this recipe!  We had it with burgers and it's awesome.  I will definately make this again.  I don't think I used quite all the cheese it called for and next time I may use a little more rice.  Everything else I did exactly as written and got rave reviews!  Thanks for a good recipe!

Very good.  We had them with tortillas and cut the amount of cheese in half.  I will definately do this dish again and try it with olives, maybe beans, or what ever else I have in the kitchen.

This is great.  I made it almost as the recipe said but did make a few small changes.  I had a lot of rice leftover from the day before so I used that instead of making new rice.  I also used fresh basil and about 2/3 of the amount of cheese it called for.  I didn't measure it so I am not sure how much I actually used.  It was very tasty and will be great as a base for many other things because it would be very easy to modify to your tastes.

This is a really yummy recipe. I put a lot less cheese in it so it wouldn't be as bad for you and it was fabulous. I put 3 slices and it didn't really seem to need anymore. It was tasty!

I really liked the flavor of this dish.  Only reason why not 5 stars was b/c I felt it was too much cheese - and I'm from wisconsin.  I will make again only with more rice and less cheese.  I think I will try it with shrimp too.

My husband and I loved it.  The only thing I changed was instead of the chopped tomoato, I used a can of Rotel for a little extra kick.
 Will make again

A delight, fresh and tasty.  I have made it with fresh and canned tomatoes (without the juice) and my family just can't get enough.

This was fantastic! I am a fairly novice cook, so I appreciated the simplicity of this recipe. I was out of oregano so I subbed italian seasoning and added a little feta to the top. Also, instead of white rice, I used quinoa to add some protein to this dish. This recipe leaves quite a bit if room for error and creativity and it certainly pleased my family.

Yum. I went heavier on the spices, lighter on the cheese (used soy cheese) and used canned diced tomatoes to make it faster to throw together. Basmati rice was very good in this dish. Thanks for the recipe

I made this casserole twice this past week. I increased the basil and oregano to 1 tsp. ea. I also decreased the cheese to one cup. The first time I used shredded mozzarella(did not have cheddar) the second time I did use cheddar and found out that we liked it better with  the mozzarella. A great recipe to use up some of our garden zucchini. Thanks Debi!

I made a few modifications to this recipe.  I halved the amount of cheese, used 1tsp of each of the dried herbs and used fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic salt.  With these alterations this is one of my families favorite dishes.  It is simple to prepare ahead of time, placing it in the oven to be done in just 15 minutes!  And most important we all get our veg - and love it!

My husband thought it was delicious but I thought it was good but it needed a little more zip. I think I will add more spices next time. This was a good way to make zucchini.

We were on zucchini "over-load" and I was quickly running out of creative ways to cook it!  Then I found this recipe.  Not only is it excellent right out of the oven, but heated up as a leftover it's even better.

This was so delicious!  It involves a few steps to prepare it, but it is well worth it.  I think it would also be great with some left over diced chicken mixed in.  Will definately make again, thanks!

Very, very good, I tossed in some mushrooms because I had some I wanted to use up, and I used the cheese I had on hand because I didn’t have any cheddar left.

My hubby really liked this.  I make a similar recipe without the rice, using yellow onion, canned tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.  The rice makes it more like a main dish.

Amazing! My kid even ate this. Zucchini stayed crispy, not mushy at all, and there's not a thing i would change on this recipe. It was so good, I passed the recipe along to my parents. They added peppers and onions and LOVED it. We will definitely make this all zucchini season long.

Yum! I changed this a little, reducing the tomatoes to 1/2 C. and substituting a rough cut yellow onion for the green onions. Otherwise followed the recipe with excellent results. Thank you.

This turned out pretty well for me. I would recommend adding some more seasoning though,like a full teaspoon instead of a half of the oregano and basil.

Good starter recipe.  I would cut the amount of cheese in half because it is awfully greasy with all the cheese.

My family and I loved it!  I used a half of a 28oz. can of chopped tomatoes (I recommend a 16oz. can)instead of fresh tomatoes and used regular yellow onions instead of green ones and it still tasted great.
