I have been making this recipe for years.  However, I make mine with 1 tsp of cornstarch instead of flour and omit the cinnamon and nutmeg from the pie and put it in the topping.  We really prefer a crumb top on this pie.  It really compliments the apple/cranberry filling.  Here is my recipe for a crumb top:
1 c all purpose flour, 1/2 c packed brown sugar, 1/3 c old-fashioned oats, 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 c chilled unsalted butter cut into small pieces.
Rub in butter with fingertips or process w/food processor until mixture resembles coarse meal.

Thanks for this great recipe. I don't ever make pies, but my church was having an apple pie contest, and I won first prize with this recipe. Again thanks for sharing. We had 3 people get saved that day at church. (not because of the pie)

I really liked this recipe. I did change from a pastry topping to a crumb topping and added pecans to both the filling and topping, which my family liked.

So simple, and turned out very well with great flavor.  Added extra spices to taste, ground cloves, and sprinkled a layer of toasted chopped walnuts on the bottom of the pie before filling.

This was really good.  It got rave reviews at Thanksgiving dinner.  My sister's boyfriend (a very picky eater) said it was the best apple pie he has ever had.  Very easy to make.  Makes a ton of filling so make sure to place the pie pan on a cookie sheet to catch any spill over.  Consistency was perfect.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe.  I thought the first time I made it that it wasn't quite cranberry enough, so I usually add another half can or so and up the spice levels.

This pie was definitely a hit at our Thanksgiving this year.  I was a little nervous since I didn't have time for a "test pie" before the big day, but it turned out great.  I officially have a new favorite apple pie recipe, and I'll probably even make it again for Christmas.  Just fyi, I used all six apples, 2 granny smith and 4 golden delicious, but next time I'm tempted to up the number of granny smiths.  The pie wasn't nearly as tart as I thought it might be.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this pie, following the exact directions listed. I didn't get a chance to have any the night I made it but took a piece with me to work with my lunch. I thought "OK. This is an alright pie." After dinner that night, my husband and I decided to heat some up and serve it with ice cream. FANTASTIC! Serve this pie warm. The flavors really come out when it's heated. Cold, it comes across as sort of bland. My husband is already asking when I'm going to make another one!

this is a pretty easy pie to make, few ingredients needed. I found it to be too sweet and if I were to make this again I would not add the brown sugar. I also used a crumb topping that contained brown sugar adding to the sweetness. The cranberry sauce had enough sugar and personally I feel that no other sugar is needed in this pie.

Excellent pie! Very tart, so if you're not looking for tart, I would make something else. I made this for Thanksgiving and then was begged to make it again for Christmas. Very good!

Delicious, easy pie. I used a unfoldable store bought crust on the bottom and crumb topping (1/2 c. flour, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 3T butter crumbled in the food processor). Mixed granny smith and 2 red apples, as suggested. I don't usually like making pies, but this seems quick and dependable as long as your audience eats cranberries :) Thanks a lot!

This is an excellent pie, and I'm not the only person who thinks so!  Each Thanksgiving I am in charge of the pies, and for the last 5 years, I have made a traditional apple pie, and this apple cranberry pie.  The apple cranberry is always finished first, and is everyone's preference.  So then,  for next year, in my head, I plan to make two of the apple cranberry and ditch the traditional.  However, each year, a new person is coming for Thanksgiving, so then I second guess myself and make the two different pies.  End result - I regret it!  The apple cranberry pie wins every time!!!

So I made this pie last Christmas a party. It came out really well. I made it with a double crust on top ( I don't think that it is actually called a "double crust", but I used the topping recommended in the recipe with brown sugar, oats, and butter and I also put the crisscross pie crust on top.) it looked really nice and everyone said it tasted so good :) Thanks for your help!!  I highly recommend this recipe. I found that if you cut your apple in small chunks all of it will fit in one pie crust. If you cut your apple chunks large then you will have enough extra filling to make a crisp for two for breakfast =)

Not a fan of chewy fruits in my pies and the use of cranberry sauce fit the bill.  Loved this pie!  Easy to make and delicious.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This was very delicious! I followed the recipe almost to a T and I ended up with enough filling for 2- 9in deep dish pie crusts. I also made a crumb topping from this site. Everyone loved it!

My family really enjoyed this in fact my husband said it was unbelievably good.  I thought the filling turned out a little too loose for my liking.  It was fine for us, but if I had company, I wouldn't have been 100% thrilled with the presentation.  Perhaps it was because of my no-name cranberries or maybe it just needs a little more flour to hold it all together.  I'll still try it again.  Very yummy.  Thanks!

This was a fantastic pie!  I always prefer a crumb topping on my apple pies rather than a top crust, so that's how I made this pie, but other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  It was so good, my husband had it for breakfast this morning!

Made this for Christmas dessert. Very good, but would be even better with nuts. Next time will have to try a crumb topping. This fit perfectly into my deep dish pie plate, so didn't have any problems with filling leaking out during baking.

I made the pie as written, dabbed some milk on the crust at the end of baking, and threw on a bit of sugar. The crust was gorgeous and the filling even better. I won second place at the pie contest!

It was a great dish.  I used Annie May Flaky Biscuit on the top of the pie with brown sugar sprinkle on top.  My family loved this dished.

I found this and decided to repurpose my leftover can of cranberry sauce. Followed the recipe except I did not add sugar.  I did add the juice from a lime and the pie came out quite well.  BTW, I made the slices thin and baked at 425 for 35 minutes.  I will make it again.  Next time I may add a couple tablespoons of brown sugar.

A little too sweet, but loved it.
Husband said he likes the taste better then
plain apple pie. I will be making it again.

This was a yummy pie. Fairly quick and easy too!  I added a half a teaspoon of ground cloves, dotted the filling with butter, and added an egg wash to the crust to make it golden. Pretty and delicious!

One of the best pies I have ever made! I used 16 oz of homemade cranberry sauce and then covered the pie with tinfoil until the last 15 minutes.  It turned out perfect. Should have taken a picture, but we gobbled it down.

This pie is a good choice for the Thanksgiving dessert buffet.  I give three stars only because the cranberries over powered the apples and it needed more spice.  But, with the right balance it will be a great pie.

This was a delicious pie!! Instead of using cranberry sauce I used 1 cup of sliced cranberries. Everyone loved the pie, this recipe is a keeper.

We love this pie!  Even better than traditional apple pie-the cranberry flavor is not overpowering, it just adds a little something extra.  I've made it a few times for different people and it's been a big hit each time.

Made with granny smiths - and folks who like tart loved it.  Made with PEARS (for my spouse) - and the ultimate compliment - my SIL made it at her next party!!  I substituted Tapioca for the flour (made it sweeter) once.

A really lovely tasting pie.  I have family members who don't like overly sweet desserts and this one was perfect for them.  The only thing I changed was only adding 4 apples.  Thanks for a great recipe!
