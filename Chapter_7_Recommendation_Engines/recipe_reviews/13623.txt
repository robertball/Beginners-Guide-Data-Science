I will definitely make again! A few suggestions: (1) Use half the sugar. 3 cups was plenty.  (2) Toast the walnuts in a toaster oven, the oven or pan to bring out the flavor.  Next time I may give it a splash of orange liqueur like Grand Marnier, although it was delicious as is.

This is the best recipe.  It tastes great, looks great, and is easy to prepare.  You can substitute with mandarin oranges and get a little different look and a little sweeter, too.

Easy, delicious, and beautiful. Guests are impressed with "real" cranberry conserve, as opposed to that yukky stuff from a can.

I've tried a new cranberry recipe every Thanksgiving for about the last 8 years and this is definitely the best I've tried.  It is also the first one that people have asked for the recipe.  The only change I would make is that I would use less water.  The recipe doesn't give an exact amount and since cranberries float I used too much.

Great flavor. yet as stated before, it was too thin. The only thing that I might do next time is to add a little Port wine (didn't have any) to cut the sweetness just a bit.

Using 6 cups of sugar makes this too sweet.  I had to add another quart of Cranberries.  The flavor is good but it's too watery.

Very good, especially for raisin-lovers! I halved the recipe because it makes so much and people are really finicky once they think it's "just" cranberry sauce.  It's hard to get them to try it;  this one does NOT have the really acidic flavor of many cranberry sauce recipes however.  I did cook it "down" for longer than directions say.

I made this for Thanksgiving and cut the recipe by half. I don't think my proportions were correct. I used one package of cranberries, 1/4 pound of raisins, 1 orange, 1/4 c. chopped walnuts and 3 c. white sugar. I think I added too much water to the cranberries at the beginning, but it still came out great. Would make it again.
