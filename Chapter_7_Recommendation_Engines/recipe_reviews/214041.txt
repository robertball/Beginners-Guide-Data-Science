I just love this recipe because it's fun & different  :o)  If the peas are fried long enough, they're light & crispy, almost hollow & pop in your mouth.  Be sure they're nice & cool before frying.  Use a nice sized onion because the fried onion bits are great!  The Old Bay & kosher salt are totally to taste, just like salting your popcorn, taste as you go.  I hope you enjoy, thanks for trying!!  :o)

I made these for my get together last night and everyone talked about how they have never heard of these or even tried these before. I will admit I messed up the recipe. I forgot to add the old bay. Instead I ended up seasoning with ground red pepper and kosher salt. (may be helpful for those that dont have the old bay) They tasted almost like little potato chips.  Very Good, Thanks!

Crunchy outside, full of flavor inside. The recipe is good as it is. We've made couple of changes just to try to get different tastes. Used Italian spice mix and red hot chili to season after frying. Drained the extra oil. I put a layer of Turkish yogurt on a plate and put the beans on it. Hot-cold, crunchy-soft, spicy-plain.... Wonderful joy of tastes.... Thank you for this different recipe.

My friends loved these!  Crispy, salty, flavorful & snacky  :)  Mine turned out nice & light, not greasy like another reviewer, maybe their oil needed to be hotter.  I made sure mine were well drained before frying too.  So what if they're not healthy, they're fried!!  Like other guilty pleasures, not an everyday thing but fun for guests & really tasty.  Thanks!!

I was not impressed. What an oily mess and a terrible jolt to ones system (meaning your body). And one does what, with these fried things? Yes I fried them as the recipe called for and it looked just like the picture, but please...popcorn would have been better.

Mmmmmm! big hit at our place We grow our own and this is a different way to use them. I used a cajun season salt and extra garlic salt. Be sure to drain well on paper towels.I did a quick soak method ,worked fine

I normally hate beans/peas because of their texture. The crispiness of deep-frying takes that all away. This recipe is wonderful. My only tip is to use a pot to deep-fry these. I did everything I could to make sure they were drained - but still all the water from soaking caused my deep-fryer to overflow, and I lost a lot of oil and had a big mess to clean up. Delicious though.

Just made these for the first time.  I must say they turned out fantastic! Nice, light and not too greasy just make sure your oil is nice and hot.  The only thing I changed was using sea salt instead of kosher.  All my family loved this recipe, I will definitely be making this again.

I must've been missing something, but this did not turn out good for me. Frying the peas was very painful - they oil kept bubbeling and overflowing from the pot even when only a few of the peas were pu in there. Had to dich tthe recipe latminute. Not sure what went wrong - sounded a great recipe on first read.

Delish! These were amazing! To add a little more kick, I sprinkled with Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning & Old Bay. You know when you get lifelong Mississippians to eat peas any other way but with ham hocks & bacon - and love them - you've found a recipe to keep! Definitely make sure your oil is hot enough or you will get greasy peas. After second batch, figured out the key was to fry smaller batches for 5 minutes - turned out wonderfully!!

Not for the meek at heart - this recipe takes a brave soul and lots of patience!!  Deep frying water filled beans is a challenge as it boils over quickly but in the end a tasty fun treat for New Years - bring on the luck in 2013!!!!
