We absolutely loved this!  The rub and the marinade gave the pork great flavor.   I  roasted the pork shoulder exactly as stated in the recipe and then refrigerated overnight.  The next day I cut the pork into chunks and cooked in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes to get a nice crust and served as carnitas with homemade black beans and cilantro lime rice.  Wonderful recipe!

I rarely leave a review on any of the recipes. But, this was amazing and I had to say thank you for sharing this recipe!!   I followed the recipe exact however, I put the roast in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours. It melted in your mouth. My family couldn't get enough of it.  I just mixed up all the ingredients in a bowl.. cut slits in the meat, spooned some of the marinade into the slits and poured the rest over the top of it.   im already wanting to make it again!!!

Cuban Style Pork Roast Haiku: "So, this was awesome! I used a monster pork loin, just changed baking time." Followed the recipe and ingredients as written, but adjusted the baking time, just watching my meat thermometer, removing the pork at 145 deg. to rest, b/c taking it out at 170, as indicated by the recipe directions, would've resulted in a very, very dry piece of pork. Delicious rub and marinade, and the leftovers made fantastic Cuban sandwiches!

My review is based on the rub and the marinade which are excellent.  I used different time and temperature & also used a sirloin bone-in pork roast instead of a pork shoulder.  I would encourage someone to make this exactly according the recipe (unlike me) and I am sure you will not be disappointed.  An internal temperature of 170 will give you meat that can be sliced, cook to 190 and it is more like pulled pork.  Great flavor and I will be making this again.  Thanks!

Made this for a dinner party and my guests are still talking about  how good it was.  I followed the recipe exactly as listed but only cooked to 145 degrees inside.  I love pork and this roast was the best I have ever made or tasted.  Thanks for the recipe! I served it with winter squash.

There are no words for how good this roast tastes. I made this for dinner tonight and everyone was blown away. my only change was I cooked it all day on low in a slow cooker while I was at work, which made it even easier. I served with rice and the Cuban black bean recipe  also on All Recipes site. I thought I was in Miami.

I have been a vegetarian for 35 years but I do prepare meat for the family very frequently. I just made this pork roast and everyone raved about it. It was juicy inside, crispy outside and very flavorful. I am certainly going to prepare it again for my carnivores!

Restaurant quality! Ive made this exactly as written and also used a pork butt roast and converted it to a crock pot. Both were outstanding! For the crock pot pork butt ... I didn't have time to marinate and cook so it just cooked in double liquid for 6 hrs. I then put it on a roasting pan and broiled it for 5 minutes to brown. It was amazing!

This was delicious!  I did a couple things differently, unintentionally.  My roast marinated for two days because my schedule was too hectic to get it into the oven!  I marinated it in a baking dish with a lid, and used the same dish to bake it in the oven.  I used the liquid to baste it being that the cooking time was extended and figured any bacteria in the marinade would be destroyed with the cooking process. I cooked it for a half hour or so at 400F and then an additional  2 1/2 hours at 375F . It fell off the bone and was super tender and flavorful.  Served with roasted yams.

Excellent and easy recipe. I am sure that it is even better if you follow the recipe, but I was lazy and made the following changes:

I used garlic powder because I was too lazy to chop the garlic. I had not read the recipe in advance, and did not have time to marinate it.  I slit the top of the roast, rubbed the whole roast with the marinade, and popped it in the oven.
It was delicious.  If you make it in the crock pot, you will lose the tasty crust that baking creates.

Excellent!! It ended up marinating for several days...the flavor was delicious. I cooked it at 200 degrees for 10 hours with tin foil lightly covering it...it was so moist and tender. And the delicious aroma all....day....long was mouth-watering. I shredded it (for pulled pork sandwiches) and then put the shredded meat back in the pan juices to soak up the moisture. I'll try it in the crockpot next time. This amateur felt like a true chef serving this to my family!

I made with roast I had which was 2 lb pork sirloin... I cooked at 325 90 minutes. However I made marinade and base as suggested for four pounder as many said ran dry. It was juicy and tangy and had lots of leftover to keep moist on reheat. Everyone raved. Including father in law who was married 62 years to latina... Yummy will make again

This was a good recipe. I forgot to marinade the night before so the roast really only had about 3 hours before going into the oven. It cooked just about on schedule, reaching an interior temperature of 170F after 3 hours.

This was SO DELICIOUS!
Prepared as written, seared and slow cooked in the crock pot for 6+ hours.  
My whole house was enveloped in the delicious aroma!!! 
As depicted in the photo I placed on flour tortillas, added slaw mix, hot sauce, sour cream, fresh cilantro and avocado. 
I went back for seconds on the meat and added only avocado, because that meat seriously can hold it's own!  This will be made again & again...next time with the addition of red garnet yams!
Thank you for sharing!  You have spread some definite love with this recipe! :-D

Im Cuban and have been making pork roast most of my life, but I have to say that I hadn't used some of the ingredients called out for here and WOWZA!  IT turned out amazing.  I followed it step by step and I can truly say, I loved it because I am very picky when it comes to Cuban food.  I will use this recipe forever.

Love, LOve, LOVE these flavors. I usually double up on the marinade and mix with any drippings to make a sauce to add a little extra flavor  when eaten with starches like fried plantains  or beans and rice.  I've used this recipe as a base for  making pulled pork in a slow cooker, again reserving drippings and left over marinade to reduce for an accompanying sauce. We've also marinaded a pork loin overnight and then removed from the liquid to vacuum seal and freeze. Two months later the flavors were still kickin around nicely! Great recipe!

Amazing. Smells wonderful while cooking, flavor is out of control. I chopped the garlic super fine, and smashed it as best I could with the back of a spoon. I'm gonna get a mortar and pestle just to make this in the future, but it worked pretty well anyhow. I made the full amount of paste and marinade, but used a 2 1/2 # bone-in butt roast. The smell of garlic was so intense (in a good way) I was a little worried I had over done it. Nope. Crazy good, & was great  the next day, sliced, cold on a sandwich. Thanks for this keeper of a recipe.

I have made a few of this type of recipes and this one is by far the best.  Only thing I would say is I will increase the amount of marinade so there is more cooking sauce.  I also added a sliced onion to the bottom of the roasting pan.  Cooked it covered in my Staub dutch oven.

Wow, this stuff is good!  My daughter devoured these and didn't touch her rice until the end.  Anyway,  I didn't have the time to marinate so I decided to use my flavor injector for the first time.  Since I lost the needle part of the injector , I made a slit then injected it with the processed marinade.  I also added large cut onions an hour before it was done and also threw in some whole mushrooms.

Excellent flavour.  Actually a good amount of eat was eaten before it even made it to the table!  No need to make any changes, it is perfect just the way it is.

Loved the flavor, but agree with others reviews that 170 is too high. I would make this again but next time will lower the heat and only cook to an internal of 140 - 150.

Love this recipe.....flavorful, easy.....I checked it at the appropriate time and it was already well done.....very good but another time I would check it at about 1/2 hour less......definitely going to use the marinade for pork loin on the grill.....

This is my first year raising pigs on my farm and the first thing I wanted to make was this Cuban Pork roast recipe. I used all the ingredients suggested but added a little bit more garlic, orange and lime for added flavor. The results were a succulent moist, tasty, crusted pork roast! Bon Appetite!

This is absolutely the best pork roast I have ever made.  My whole family loves it and this is usually the only recipe I use for roast pork. Very flavorful and juicy.

This is AMAZING! Just made it tonight. Marinated it 3 days (by accident, things came up). Followed recipe to a T. I have never made Pork Shoulder roast by roasting it, I always slow cook and shred it, but this was far superior. Amazing flavor, unbeliveably juicy, incredible crust on the outside.  My husband and I were licking the cutting board clean. We sliced it, added ham slices and swiss cheese to it, and will slather it with grainy mustard like a cuban sandwhich. but the pork is incredible on its own. This will go into the rotation of family dishes from now on. thanks for sharing it!

Does this smell fantastic when done in a crock pot. We browned it first & then put in crock pot with some of the juice from the marinade.  Hubby cooked it on a medium temp.  Will make again & maybe try on the grill. You can eat this as a roast & I think with the juice from the crock pot you could thicken it to use as a gravy. You can also shred to have with tortillas.

I made this with a Butt Roast then I followed directions and after refrigerating about 12 hours I cooked the roast in the crock pot in the marinade mixture on low until it fell apart  my family loved it. I used the left overs to make Cuban Sandwiches from another recipe on this site.

This is very good.  I couldn't use garlic because I live with a vampire and I used orange zest instead of orange juice because that's what I had.  Otherwise, I did follow the seasoning instructions and it smelled SO GOOD while it was cooking.  I could smell it when I got out of my car in the driveway and I was starving by the time I came in the house.  Due to timing issues, I used my normal slow roasting and then browning of the roast instead of the method given in the recipe.  We had slices of pork roast with some jalapeno mashed sweet potatoes and steamed baby broccoli and it was spectacular.

My family loved this! I only had a 3lb shoulder, but I made the same amount of rub and marinade. Next time, I'll make more of the rub as I felt you can't have too much of that flavor. The fat crisped up beautifully and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly with the only exception that I didn't have orange juice, so I juiced a fresh orange and I included the zest from both the lime and the orange in the marinade.

I put in the crockpot and only had 2.5lbs of pork. The marinade to meat ratio was perfect. Next time if I cook the 4 lbs, I'd probably make a little extra marinade. Everyone loved this. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Will not use this recipe again. Flavor was too mild. Cooked to 175F. Maybe needed a fatter cut of pork. Marinated for just over 24 hours in fridge.

It’s all about the seasoning!  The only changes that were made: I used lemon & lime juice instead of just lime. That’s what I had. I used a whole, small (3.3 lb) whole pork loin. The leftovers are destined to be added to Cuban Sandwiches.

I used pork loin and applied the spice rub after marinating the meat for a nice spice crust.

Excellent flavor and very tender.  I doubled everything since my roast was an 8 lb roast, so it took twice the time but cooking it to 170 degrees was the key.

I made this the other day and enjoyed it very much. There was plenty left over so I'm still enjoying it today. 
I didn't let it marinate long. Only about 2 hours. It still came out great. I can't wait to try it again when I have time to let it sit overnight in all those good spices!

A bit too much salt.  I cooked my 2.5# roast for an hour.   That was a little too long, but very good.  I would chop up the garlic before attempting to muddle it next time.

This is a great recipe and I highly recommend it! I had all of the ingredients except lime juice and it still turned out really good. I will be making this again soon!

I was craving the roast pork I've had at El Siboney, a wonderful Cuban restaurant in Key West.  This recipe really delivered, even with using a pork loin and slow-cooking it in a crock pot (on a 90+ degree day).  I think the fat of a pork shoulder, baked in an oven, would make for even better flavor.  Certainly something to look forward to this fall and winter!

This was super good! Next time though I'm going to reduce the amount of coriander by half.
Other then that, this would be great as tacos also.

This was excellent!  I used a crockpot instead of roasting it in the oven and still got wonderful, flavorful results.  Served with black beans and rice, it was a delicious meal.

I made this as a trial run for Cinco de Mayo.  We loved this & I did as another reviewer suggested &, after it was done, I “chuncked it up” & put it back in the oven for carnitas.   Wow!!  Really excellent.  Served this with Cuban Black Beans I (Cuban Black Beans II are good, too but too much like BBQ Beans for this usage).  I also made the Cilantro Lime Rice-also came out excellent.  Thanks for this recipe - I will be making it again!

I thought this was excellent.  I didn’t have dried coriander, so I had to skip that, and also didn’t have white wine vinegar so I substituted apple cider vinegar.  I cut some holes in the roast and put some in the holes and poured the rest over the roast.  Cooked in the slow cooker all day and it was fall apart goodness.  Absolutely love the broth it sits in and think it would make a great gravy if it was thickened.

Wonderful recipe for a pork shoulder roast I was given (locally raised). The rub is just to-die-for. I didn't have time to marinate so I cut some holes in the surface, pushed some rub/sauce into them and slathered the rest over the top. Terrific! Took a little less time, but I went by the thermometer after 1 1/2 hours. That is, the half hour on the high temp. plus an hour at 375.

Delicious!  The only change I made was using rice vinegar, since I didn't have any white wine vinegar.  I used a 3.5 lb. boneless roast and fortunately checked with a meat thermometer an hour before it was supposed to be done.  It was already at 170 degrees.  The recipe doesn't specify whether to use a bone-in roast or boneless, so if you use a boneless roast be sure to check with a meat thermometer.  The roast has a delicious flavor, and came out very tender.  Keeper recipe!

This has been awesome every time we've made it! We just mix up the ingredients and pour it over the pork in the slow cooker and then shred it for tacos. It's simple, delicious, and less complicated than Cafe Rio copycat recipes we've tried. Not saying it tastes the same but it's just as incredible with less work. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

This was too dry, partially because I used a pork loin.  If I make it again, I will use pork butt, braise it on the stove top and throw it in the crockpot.

I made it in the crock pot instead of the oven. I had it on low for 8 hours. It was melt in your mouth soft and super delicious! My kids, who are not picky eaters but know what they like, devoured it! Making it again tomorrow for a party! Can not wait to eat it again!

I made this. I only marinated for 4 hours, and still lots of flavour. It was very tender and moist. I added extra cooking time. none of the flavours were over powering. Very good!

Except for the fact that I used boneless pork ribs that I cut into 2 inch cubes that marinated in the mixture overnight, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The meat was deliciously flavored and extremely tender.  I served on top of brown rice.  The whole family devoured it.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe.  Tasted better than I expected and will definitely make this again.

As I had a 2# pork roast I reduced the recipe by 1/3.  I also used my Ninja 4-in-1 Cooking System instead of the oven and adjusted the cooking times accordingly, and this method worked quite well producing a very moist pork roast full of flavor.

I used Badia Sour Orange instead of the orange and lime juice as well (I will use the lime and orange juice substitutions next time for comparison).

All in all I'm looking forward to at least 2 Cuban Sandwiches from what was left over.

One thought I'm having is of incorporating a cubanelle pepper or two into the marinade and build the marinade using a food processor just to see how it comes out (anyone tried that).

This is so very delicious! The only change I made, and that was because I had ran out of dried oregano, used dried italian seasoning and dried basil in its place. Will definitely make this again and again. I marinated it over night. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with a 6 lb.  pork butt roast but used the measurements as shown in the recipe.  After marinating for about 4 hours I decided to make it the same day instead of waiting for the next day.  It was delicious and was very tender.  Also roasted some yams in the bottom of the pan to soak up the juices.

This is a surprisingly awesome dish.  There is not much to it but the flavors are unreal!  I didn't have time to marinate it overnight, but I will make this dish again and marinate it overnight !

Made this using apple cider as I didn't have any orange juice in the house.  Also used balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar.  I didn't realize when I started that it should marinate  so, I just poured the marinade over top of the roast, as I was making it for supper.  It turned out great!  Will  definitely make this again.

I used dried oregano coz couldn't get fresh one here. Followed exactly the same as recipe except for the timing coz my pork shoulder was a bit thin and it turned out super fragrant super delicious pork roast

We've had Cuban pork roast cooked by a cook from Cuba. This recipe was almost as good. If I hadn't had the real thing before, this would've gotten 5 stars.
