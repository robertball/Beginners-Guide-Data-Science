This was an ok stew, but the flavor of the lamb was minimal.  Since lamb is so expensive, I won't make it again, or will just use beef or pork.  I used Garam Masala spice mixture (Cardamom, Black pepper, Coriander, Nugmeg, Cloves and Cinnamon)to give it some more flavor. Only for okra lovers.  Don't make it if you don't like okra.  Okra has a viscous texture when cooked and aids in thickening soups and stews.

I haven't tried it but probably will since I love okra and lamb.  I found a tip that if you soak the okra in cold water and lime juice it reduces the sliminess whenever stewing or adding to a broth or soup.  I normally let it sit in a bit of apple cider vinegar and water which also cuts down on the slime.

I followed the recipe, but did add salt and pepper, lacking in the list of ingredients.  I used big chunks of neck - much tastier and cheaper.  I had a small bit of onion, so put that in too.  The mint,  and rosemary just blended in and wasn't evident.   I found it most pleasant.

I enjoyed this dish, but did not have all the ingredients, so the recipe I am reviewing is, as so often, not quite the one provided.   The okra I used was frozen and sliced.  I used lamb neck, the least expensive cut. I cut the pieces of lamb meat into small bites....about 1/4- 1/3"  cubes. This was much less than 2 lbs lamb meat, but there was a bit of lamb in each bite of stew, giving definite lamb flavor. I put the bones in with the stew. I used MUCH less garlic(2 large cloves).I omitted mint and fresh rosemary...I am not fond of either, and did not have them. I used marjoram, dried, instead of rosemary. I did not have tomato paste. The cans of tomatoes I had were: one plain diced, and one diced with green peppers, slightly spicy. After draining, I put the  juices back in, because the mixture was too dry to simmer. I did not make the pilaf. I enjoyed the result, and will definitely make it again.

only used lamb shank, no paste and didn't prepare the starches.  Used french bread for dipping.  stewed for 3 hours.  nice, but I will use more lamb next time and increase spices by 50% for the fun of it.
