Yum!!  I sauteed some onion and some spinach along with the zucchini "inners" and sausage before making the stuffing, but other than that, this recipe is perfect!  It was hit with veggie and non-veggie lovers!

My hubby was looking for a recipe for zucchini and found this one, we had all on hand except the  sauce,(He ran to the store:)- we used stove top as the bread crumbs, all we had on hand, and some sausage with spinach and mozzarella cheese mixed all together from Costco, with a side of mashed potatos. WOW was it wonderful, Awesome recipe and one you can work with in many ways, pretty much with what you have on hand, love that. Thank you so much for Sharing. ABSOLUTLY MAKING AGAIN, WE LOVED IT:) PS really fills you up:)
