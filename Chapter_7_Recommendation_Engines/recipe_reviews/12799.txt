I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I added a few things to it to make it a little tastier.  It was a little bland on it's own.  I reduced the cream cheese to 8 oz, and increased the mayo to 3 4ths of a cup.  I squirted lemon juice on the crab to eliminate any fishy taste ( i do this to all my seafood).  Then I added 2 shakes of cayanne and 3 tablespoons of horseradish.  I baked it for 15 minutes, and then topped it with shredded cheddar and monteray jack cheese and baked it until the cheese was lightly golden.  With these chages it is a def. 5 star recipe.  I think this is a great starter crab dip.  Thanks for posting.

What's up, people??  Man, every now and then, I run across recipes on this website that cause me to want to hit somebody because they are so  GOOD!!!!  Well, this is one of them.  I did everything that the recipe called for, but I did add a little sour cream and some sharp chedder cheese in the mixture.  I didn't have any Old Bay Seasoning either so I just used a little Tony Chachere's seasoning salt (it's a Louisiana thang, baby).  I also sprinkled the top of it with a little more cheese once I put it in the pan.  I served it with an Italian loaf that I toasted in the oven for just a little bit to make the bread a little crispy...but don't keep it in too long are the bread will be too hard.  Always make sure that you grease the bottom of the pan before you bake it......or just simply spray it with some non-stick cooking spray.  Clean-up's a breeze and this dip didn't last long at all.  To be honest, I ate it all myself cause I didn't want to share.  I'll share the next one, but this was just too darn good.............FOR REAL!!!

This crab dip was delicious! I've had one like this in a restaurant with my boyfriend and I wanted to learn the recipe. I took some reviewer's suggestions and added a couple of tablespoons of sour cream, 1 tsp. of both lemon juice and old bay seasoning. My boyfriend even thinks that it's better than what we had in the restaurant. Thanks for the recipe. We'll definitely make it again.

GREAT dip with some changes!  I used an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, 1 pound can of crab meat (fresh-Phillip's), and also added 1 T horseradish, 1 T Old Bay seasoning and 1/4 cup colby jack.  I made it the way the recipe originally stated and it was very boring.  We LOVE the taste of crab, but needed some more zing!

Like just about everyone else, I doctored up this great starter recipe to make a dip my husband doesn't want to share with anyone!  I used only 8oz cream cheese, and half an onion sauteed with fresh garlic, 1 cup sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, old bay, and a healthy dousing of cholula hot sauce. 

Yummy!

I would have given it a higher rating if I hadn't changed it so much. I used a pound of fresh backfin crabmeat, 8oz cream cheese, 1 cup mayo, and one cup sour cream. I sauteed a half onion with four cloves of minced fresh garlic before I mixed it in with everything else. I also added a tbls of Old Bay seasoning and topped it off with some shredded cheese. With those tweaks it was very good.

okay here is the scoop. I tried this recipe just the way it is, I hate it when people just start adding things right away without trying it the T first. It doesn't work. It tastes like mayo. and the bowl gets soggy. so I changed it..lol I used 3 6oz cans of crabmeat, 1 cup sour cream, 2 8oz pkgs of cream cheese, I sauteed 1 half of a white onion with garlic and a tbsp of butter. added all spice, and garlic powder to taste. The secret is adding 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese grated. If I did anything wrong, I didn't add enough salt. I also dashed on some lemon pepper before I served it. I served it cold with Seattle sourdough bread toasted. MMMMMMmmm It was amazing! also used ritz crackers. It was gone in 5 mins and there were only 6 of us. :) :)

This was really good both warm and cold.  I used shallots instead of onions and I didn't use any mayo in it.  I served this with sourdough bread.

Super yummy! I brought this for a work lunch (bunch of nurses) and everyone
gobbled it fast! I served it on top of whole wheat beer bread (from this website) and 
it was wonderful. Definately will make again and again!

Fantastic!!!  I came across this recipe about 6 months ago and make it at least once a month!  I've found that adding a pinch (or two) of Old Bay Seasoning really enhances the flavor!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party and everyone loved it.  It's easy to make and delicious with just crackers.  This was the first time I made crab dip, so I took the advice of other reviews and made some minor changes.  I didn't reduce the amount of cream cheese but did add a couple of big spoonfuls of sour cream.  I also added about a third of a cup of finely shredded colby jack cheese, half a teaspoon of Old Bay, and a half a lemon's worth of lemon juice.  Because I also made foccacia bread, I didn't serve this in a bread bowl.  People were eating the dip with the bread or with crackers, rolling their eyes and moaning with each bite!

This dip is excellent! I couldn't stop eating it. However I altered it just a bit. I also took the advice of other readers on the dip. I used 8 oz. of cream cheese, a couple tblsp of sour cream, a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and 1 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning. It was delicious! And I did not put it in a bread bowl, instead I cut up pieces of italian bread, brushed the pieces with olive oil and lightly toasted them in the oven. Thank you.

I halved this recipe and made several changes per the many suggestions. I sauteed my onions in minced garlic (deleting the need for garlic powder). I added a little lemon juice and around 2-3 tbs of old bay (deleting the salt & pepper). I added about 1 tbs of horseradish and around a 1/2 cup of sour cream. I only used 8 oz of cream cheese and a full pound of fresh crab meat. I also added about a cup of shredded colby jack cheese. The results were amazing. We are from the Chesapeake Bay area and are very picky about our seafood. This was the perfect blend of creamy and spicy. Delicious!

I made this for Christmas and it was gone fast. My family loved it! I made it a bit differently based on previous customer reviews. I used 8 oz of cream cheese, left out the onions, and sprinkled in some Old Bay seasoning. I also added 1/2 cup of mild shredded cheddar to the mix and topped it with some cheddar before baking.

This was great!  I took the advice of the other reviewers and added about a tablespoon of Old Bay, a bit of lemon juice, a half cup of cheddar cheese, and a half cup of sour cream.  I ended up letting it sit overnight before baking it, which certainly didn't hurt it and may have helped.  I also sprinkled the top with parmesan cheese before baking.  It was SO good!  And the little bit of leftovers heated up quite well.

I've just made this recipe for the second time yesterday, and two people asked me to send the recipe to them.  This time, I did use the all-white canned crab (instead of mixed) and I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the mixture before baking and sprinkled on top inside the bread bowl.  This is now in my stable of "must make" foods. Can't wait to use fresh crab next time, but it's wonderful anyway!

I followed other suggestions for adding flavor. Didn't have any horseradish but did have ~2 Tblsp. of hot mustard leftover from Chinese the night before. I added it to mix and subbed a cup of plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Came out pretty tasty.

This recipe was also very good with some tweaking.  I decreased the cream cheese to just 8oz.  Add 1/2 cup sour cream, 3 tbsp horseradish sauce, Old Bay to taste.  I used 1 pound can of "special" crab meat.  It was a hit!

I gave it 4 stars, because it is a great starter recipe, but needs a little more flavor. I also planned to serve it cold, so I didn't bake it. I reduced the onion by half, since it would be raw, increased the garlic to about 1 t. fresh minced garlic, added 2 oz shredded Colby Jack, and 2 oz shredded sharp cheddar. I also needed to add about 1/4 cup sour cream, along with the mayo, since I was serving it cold, and it would not be as soft otherwise. This seemed to be about perfect, flavor wise, but this was my first experience with canned crab meat, and I was not impressed. I bought the kind that said it had leg meat included, but it was still mostly mush. Next time I would use half canned, for the flavor, and half imitation so you still get chunks of crab.

This was so easy and came out perfect, I followed the advice of previous reviews and added 1 cup sourcream, 2 tbsp horseradish, some lemon juice, a few shakes of cayenne pepper and a hand full cheddar cheese in the mixture. I wanted to add Oldbay seasoning but didn't have it on hand. When I tasted it, I was glad I didn't have any, because I think this recipe is better without. I made this for our Superbowl Party and this recipe will be at every single one of our parties from now on.

This recipe is awesome! My boyfriend begs me to make it every single weekend. Instead of using canned crab, I go to the supermarket and buy it from the salad bar. It seems to be cheaper that way, and you can use more. This recipe is definetly a keeper!

We will use this recipe again and again. We read a lot of the reviews before making this and found that a lot of people seem to be trying to cover up the crab taste with extra seasoning and zesty salsa's. This recipe was great when all the directions were followed exactly! We did use imitation crab and it turned out wonderfully. Great to serve at parties because it makes a lot. Thanks for sharing it Laurie!! :)

Delicious and a lot easier than some of the other crab dip recipes here. I add about a cup of cheddar and lots of Old Bay seasoning to taste. I also sprikle Old Bay on the top when it come out of the oven. I just serve it in the baking dish, usually with bagel chips. My friends and fiance always ask me to make this and it's always eaten up. Thanks for sharing, Laurie!

I made this for my boyfriend.  He's a crab-lover, as am I, and we've had several crab dips in our time.  We both approve of this version!  Great for any crab lover.  If you want the crab to be more prominent, leave out some of the cream cheese or add some extra crab.

I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, but it had a weird sweet taste, so I would recommend the mayo.  I added Worcestershire sauce and paprika to this. I also replaced a little less than half the cream cheese with mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  Added great depth of flavor!  I think with just cream cheese it would've been too thick.

Because I was cooking other things at the same time, I had the oven a little higher and didn't cook it for quite as long.  I topped it with some cheddar cheese, and baked it uncovered until the last 10 minutes, when I took the lid off to allow the cheese to brown.

Followed another reviewer's advice and reduced the cream cheese to 8 ounces and upped the mayo to 3/4th of a cup. Also used a bit more garlic powder and liberal amounts of both black and cayenne pepper since I like lots of kick to my food. Without the additions, I think it would've tasted a bit bland to me. I also didn't use breadbowls, but instead baked this in a 9" cake pan (didn't have any other dishes). Served it with chips cold for an office party and warm while visiting my boyfriend's family. Personally, I liked it cold better, but people enjoyed it both ways!

Added horseradish and old bay to this.  Without that it was very bland and boring.

Best crab dip ever!  However, I only use fresh crabmeat....I know it is expensive, but it elevates the recipe to a new level to use fresh.

I was so excited to try this recipe! The only thing that I changed when I initially made it was the addition of lemon to the crab as many reviewers suggested, but unfortunately, it still tasted way fishy, and it didn't have any other flavor. I ended up adding about 8 oz. of sharp cheddar cheese, an additional 8 ounces of sour cream, about two tablespoons of Old Bay, some fresh cracked pepper, additional garlic, and a 2 additional tablespoons of mayonnaise. It was definitely more edible, but it was completely different than the original recipe. I don't know if it was just the particular crab that I bought, but I found that the crab was way overwhelming, and it was a little bland. I served it in a sourdough bread bowl. I wanted so badly to love this.. the reviews are so good! I think I might try it again...

Really yummy, although I added several dashes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce (could have used a few more) and some grated parmesan cheese (maybe about a 1/3 cup or so...I didn't measure, just cut off a chunk and grated it directly into the mixing bowl).  I also substituted one large clove of garlic, minced, for the garlic powder...although I think next time I'll use more garlic.  I served with garlic parmesan thin crisp Triscuits and it was delicious.

I'm sorry to give this such a poor rating.  I really thought I'd like it since I love crab.  The only things you taste in this recipe are the cream cheese and the mayonnaise.  After tasting it, I thought I could mask some of the cream cheese taste by adding a little lemon juice and Old Bay.  That did improve it, but it's still not something I'd ever make again.  I think a person has to be a huge fan of cream cheese to enjoy this dip.

Great dip for parties!  I did tweak the recipe a bit.  I used half of a huge, white onion.  Also used some Old Bay seasoning and minced garlic (instead of powder). Instead of using crusty Italian bread.  I thawed one loaf of frozen bread, formed it to bread bowl size, brushed it with beated egg, and covered it with clear wrap as it rose.  Then baked the loaf (at 350 degrees) until golden brown.  Cut the top out, insert the dip and some shredded cheese, and then bake until the cheese is melted...YUMMY!

Add a tbs. of worchestershire sauce to the mayo/cream cheese.  If you don't have an onion, you can use dry onion flakes.

I'm rating this 5 stars with some modifications.  First, as written it didn't quite fill my bread bowl up enough.  Next time I would either use one of the smaller bread bowls or just serve it in a dish.  I thought it was strange that it calls for 11 oz. cream cheese since they come in 8 oz. or 4 oz.  I would just use 1 of each for a total of 12 oz. (close enough).  I always use the Neufacthel (less fat).  It also calls for an entire small chopped onion which is far too much.  I upped the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp. and added in about the same amount of Old Bay seasoning, some diced pickled jalapenos (nacho rings), and about 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella.  It was a huge hit at our party and I will make again with these changes.

This is SO GOOD but leaving it how it is... is a little, well, bland. The crabmeat I buy is fresh Philips crabmeat so it only comes in 16 oz cans. SO I use 2 8oz packs of cream cheese, about 7tbs mayo, extra cheese, and like i said, bland, so... LOTS of old bay. I usually shake shake and mix mix until it gets a nice slightly orange color. It's TASTY. Also good with tortilla chips. Try it like I do it, you won't be sad that you did.

This ended up being much more of a hit them I had thought, was very filling and simply wonderful. I used immitation crab meat rather then canned and it turned out so good that we never got around to dinner.

Thanks for a great recipe. Just served it at a baby shower and it was a hit. I read other reviews and added about 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning. This was delicious warm in a bread bowl with toasted pita triangles, and also chilled, though very thick.  Thought it would be great on a bagel, but there wasn't any left to try! Thanks again!

Turned out wonderful.  Entire family devoured this dip that I put in a multigrain bread bowl.  I added shredded cheddar cheese & used the best canned crab meat available at the store.

Awesome dip!! However, I did tweak it. I used a packet of fresh crab meat, not canned.  I added Old Bay, shredded white cheddar and fresh lemon juice. I made it for an appetizer party at my house and we ended up ripping the bread bowl apart to get the last drops! Making two batches next time!!

This dip was very good, and it made a lot!  I took other people's suggestions and added in some sour cream, Old Bay seasoning, lemon juice and a added a little monterrey jack into the dip and and put in on top after the 20 minutes of baking.  I received a ton of compliments.  I'll make this again for sure!

I did use the other's suggestions to add sour cream, Old Bay and shredded cheese.  I think it is a lot of crabmeat and I like seafood.  I will make this again, but will likely reduce the amount of crab next time. I amy try this with shrimp too. Good recipe.  Thank you!

This was good, but a little bland.  Next time I may kick up the spices a bit.  Definitely a "starting point" recipe.

Feel bad for only giving it three, like maybe it's something I did wrong (although I did use too much old bay seasoning)  I wasn't that impressed with this, but maybe it's the canned crabmeat - and I should have gone with lump crab, or even imitation for more texture.  It was okay :)  Maybe read more reviews and use their suggestions.

Excellent!  My husband, his friends, and his parents all loved this dip.  I did tweak it to our tastes though after reading the other reviews.  I added chopped garlic instead of the powder, lemon juice, Old Bay seasoning, and parmesean cheese.  I will be making for any special occasion!

I like to use chopped green onion rather than a regular onion in this. I also like toasted slices of baguette with it because it's easier to spread the dip on them rather than trying to dunk random torn pieces of bread.

This dip is the BEST! .  I did make a few changes. I squeezed a lemon over the crabmeat and mixed it up before adding it to the other ingredients. I also added 1 C of sharp cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream. I also sprinkled cheddar on top before baking. I served it with crackers and it was delicious!

Oh! This dip is to die for!!  It is very rich and I disagree with other reviewers who said it was bland (!?).  I used imitation crabmeat, chopped, fresh garlic, and per other reviews added a dash of lemon juice and a little worcestershire...and topped with shredded cheddar for the last few minutes of baking.  I omitted the salt and pepper.  I served it right out of the baking dish with Hawaiian bread and tortilla chips.  YUM!  It is fabulous.  Will definitely make this again...

Yummy!!  Was a big hit at my husband's Christmas party.  I added some Tony Chachere's seasoning and an extra can of imitation crab.  Also, baked an extra 20 minutes.

Thanks for the great recipe!

My favorite of all warm crab dips so far.....less mayo and cream cheese, yet good crab taste.  And can be made for any amt. with easy conversions.

Great! It was a bit bland but easy to vary. I put a splash of lemon juice as another reviewer mentioned. I also put a nice bit of cracked black pepper and a generous squeeze of red rooster. A keeper!

Such a simple and good recipe! Added a lot of crab that I had around (probably more than called for in recipe). Also added a little more garlic powder, fresh diced jalapenos and bacon. Topped with white sharp cheddar cheese after everything was in the bread bowl and after 10 minutes in oven in the bread bowl, broiled for a few minutes. So addicting, we could not stop eating this!

It was simple to make. Like a lot of people suggested on this site I added some shredded cheese and some sour cream. I skipped the bread bowl. Wasn't that happy with it when it first came out but after it sat for a bit it was amazing. Only thing I will change is next time I think I will half the recipe it does make a lot and there was only three of us eatting it

Great simple recipe.   I added a tsp of lemon juice and a tbsp of old bay seasoning.  I also added 1/4 cup of grated parmesean cheese(next time I will use shredded, will be creamier).  Everyone at the party loved it

This is an easy and tasty appetizer to make and bring to a party.  I did make a few adjustments to the recipe.  I used whipped cream cheese instead of the regular cream cheese.  I also chopped up a scallion instead of an onion.  Instead of the Italian bread I used Hawaiian bread which has a sweeter taste to it.  Have received many compliments and requests for the recipe.

Very good!! I always make new recipes exactly as written but I made 2 adjustments to this one based on the ingredients I had on hand. I used green onion and the packaged imitation crab that is in block form. We tried this dip cold and warm and it's definitely better warm because the flavor is more bold this way! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Pretty much made this exactly as is... Added about an 1/8th or little more of cayenne, but still thought it needed more. Brought it as a an app before Thanksgiving dinner and it was barely touched! It definitely needs something more - like a kick!

I needed a cold crab dip and this was just great cold. Everyone loved it and finished it at a party! I put a little sour cream in it and added some cayenne pepper. I rinse, dry and lemon juice my crab meat.

My guests went crazy over this dip!  It's simple, tasty, and went well with crackers, chips, and bread!  I added a bit more Old Bay to my liking...but kept everything else the same.  Love it!

I am giving it four stars instead of five because it was bland if you followed the recipe without deviating.  I added lots of lemon juice, and cheddar cheese on top as the other reviewers did.  It turned out good.

I made this exactly as written and it was great. Came back around to make it again and didn't have some ingredients. I used miracle whip in place of mayo, added 1 tablespoon lemon juice to the crab meat, 1 tablespoon old bay, upped the garlic powder to 1/4, and instead of the onion I used chive and onion flavored Philadelphia creme cheese. It turned out great and had a great flavor. This is a great recipe because you can add what you like as far as more garlic and old bay.

Every family get together I'm ask to make this and even ask for the recipe. I add to 2tsp. of old bay, bake for 30 minutes in a quart baking dish instead of adding the bread bowl. Also, I purchase Kebbler cracker sticks. It's a hit.

I had to tinker with this recipe to get what I wanted. I added more crabmeat, 1/2 finely chopped celery stalk, 2 tbs finely chopped red bell pepper, and used 1/4 tsp minced garlic instead of powder. Lemon juice and old bay seasoning added to taste. Thank you. It was a hit when I took it to a gathering.

So delicious! I subbed shallot for the onion because that's what I had. Also used whipped cream cheese. I made a half batch for myself and I can't stop eating it with ripped up pieces of fresh sourdough bread. Yummy :)

Husband and 24yo son liked this very much. I scaled recipe to 8 servings. Like others, I added old bay seasoning (2 tbs) and minced garlic (2 tsp).  I used canned crab meat. It will be made again. Thanks for the recipe and the suggestions.  A winner in this house.

This is one of my husbands favortites, and he is quite the picky eater. It has become a must at every party we have, and at times, he'll want to make it as dinner! The nice thing about the recipe for parties, is that you can make the dip the night before and store it in the 1 quart baking dish in the fridge over night. Then, when it's time for the party, just pop it in the oven. Very easy, and delicious!

I have made this recipe twice. Once with handpicked crab Maryland blue crab (for family) and another with dungeoness crab (for office xmas party).  Both times it came out fine after I added a little extra (1 c. mozzarella cheese, 1/2 c. grated parmesean, Old Bay season to taste)!  I only gave it four stars because I think you have to add a little to it or else its pretty bland.

I served this as a spread along with the artichoke brushetta from this site.  Served it with toasted french bread.  I would recommend spicing it up a bit though.  I think some diced red pepper or a little jalepeno may be nice.

This was good. I added a little more garlic (can you have too much?) and some parmesean cheese. After tasting it I decided to add some Old Bay seasoning and that really made it suit our taste buds. Yum.

I am using this dip for a birthday party tomorrow.  Very excited about the results, too.  However, I did make changes b/c I read all of the reviews.  I sauteed my onions in 1 T. of butter and season all, added 3 T. of sour cream, 1/4 t. of cayenne pepper, 2 T. of lemon juice and 1/2 c. of cheddar cheese.  I haven't baked it yet, but when I do I will add another 1/2 cup of cheddar on top.  It's good even though it's not baked!  Thanks for a GREAT addition to my recipe box!!!!!

Out of any dish that I have prepared, this is the BEST reviewed. I make it simply for the delicious praise. When I am invited to parties, people ask me to bring this crab dip specifically. I do add some Old Bay Seasoning and extra garlic powder for a bit more flavor.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  Based on the feedback(which is why I love this site) I added some cayenne pepper, sour cream, lemon juice and fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I also sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top.  Next time I may try the horseradish but I didn't have any on hand. Thanks for the great recipe and thanks to all of you who wrote your great comments to make it even better!!

Yummy! I did alter it a bit to add a little more flavor. I added 2t creamy horseradish, only 3t mayo, 2t Old Bay Seasoning, and green onions finely chopped. Baked and then served with crackers since I was having a wine and cheese party I already had so many crackers. Everyone loved this recipe even once it cooled off. Thanks

Absolutely terrific dip!!  Even people who don't like crab LOVE this dip.  I do however only use 8 oz. of Philadelphia Cream Cheese which equals one block.  My favorite bread bowl is the hawaiian sweet bread that comes in an tin tray!  Thank you it is such a crowd and tummy pleaser!!

Overall, very tasty but you definitely have to play with this to get the desired flavor. I did take the advice of one of the reveiwers and squeezed fresh lemon over the canned crab before adding it which proved to be a good decision. I used 8 oz. of light cream cheese, 1/4 cup of Hellman's light mayo, and 1/4 cup of light sour cream. It did seem to be missing a little something so I added some Old Bay seasoning, a few shakes of tabasco and some horseradish. I served it with an assortment of crackers.

This is a great basic recipe to "tweak" up to your own tastes.  I used 1 lb. of lump crab meat (fresh), 8 oz neufchatel cheese, 3/4 cup mayo, 1 Tbsp dried minced onion, 1/2 Tbsp Old Bay seasoning, 1 tsp garlic herb seasoning, and also mixed in about 1/2 cup of a shredded Italian 6-cheese mix.  I added another 1/2 cup of the cheese mix on top and then baked for 25 minutes in a 1-quart casserole dish.  I broiled the top for a few minutes until brown and now my husband says he will never order this in a restaurant again.  :)

I am only rating this3 stars because I did have to add to it.  I added a little lemon juice, chipotle tabasco, horseradish.  I wish I would have not inlcuded the mayo.  I will leave that out next time.  I also added a little cheddar/parmesan layer on to create a golden brown crust.  My husband gobbled it up!  I also think next time I will use some better crab meat than the cans.   It would have been very bland(hence the 3 stars) if I did not add the extras.  Definitely  very good with the additions and will definitely make again.

Fast & Easy...Everyone loved this dip! Only thing I do different is use cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce and add old bay.

Not good with canned crab.  It tasted so fishy, despite treating the crab to lemon juice.  I think I will try this with fresh imitation crab, as real crab is expensive in my area.

like others, I added some seasonings and some shredded cheddar cheese on top and it was fabulous.  I used canned crab meat because that's what I had on hand but will try with fresh crab meat as well.  Yummy!!

Thanks for the recipe! I made it for a birthday party and it seemed great until I tasted it and there was a bit too much onion. I personally don't like uncooked onion and even though it was baked it still had that hard crunch of the onion to it. Next time i will dramatically reduce the amount of onion!

Using Noelle's suggestions, this crab dip is very good. I also HIGHLY suggest not using canned crab, unless you are in an area where that is all you can get. As a Marylander, canned crab is a travesty. I use the good stuff--lump crab meat. Definitely serve this warm!

Delicious, delicious, delicious !!!  Years ago I had a recipe for crab dip which got misplaced and I have been searching for so long for something to come close.  I have finally found it with this recipe.  I have tried other reviewers suggestions with adding different things, partly because I remember my original dip had a different kind of cheese in it in addition to these ingredients, but I have always loved the way this recipe comes out exactly as written the best.  I am sure I will be making this for years and years to come.   Thanks so much, Laurie.

I made some of the changes that the others tried. I added the lemon juice, paprika, old bay. It was good, I also added a little sugar to make it a little sweet. Would make it again! I also topped it off with cheese.  Yummy!

Sorry, as written it is only 3 stars.  When you follow the advice of others and add the sour cream, cayenne, and lemon and cut down on the cream cheese then we have a great dip.

LOVE THIS!!!  So easy and delish!  I added in some artichokes too, which worked out great.  Either way this dip is a winner!  Everyone I serve it to RAVES how good this is.  I'm ashamed to admit how easy it is!  I don't always use a bread bowl, sometimes I just bake it up in a pyrex dish and it works perfect with pita chips!

This is very good, but it does need the Old Bay or J.O. seasoning (omit salt if you add this), juice of 1/2 a lemon, and maybe a touch of horseradish.  I shredded 1/2 cup of medium cheddar on top before baking.

This was really yummy, but I'll only make rarely since crab meat is so pricey!  I used 1 can lump meat, and 1 can of mixed.  USE REAL MEAT IF YOU WANT A TASTEY DISH! Here are my small changes: Added a few squirts of lemon to meat, reduced cream cheese to 8oz,  used 1/4 cup minced onion and cooked it down first.  I added 3TBS prepared horseradish, 4oz sour cream, a few dashes of cayenne, and topped with mozz. cheese and paprika (for color). Served with french bread and tortilla chips.  Heated the leftovers the next day, and tasted just as good.

I received rave reviews on this.  I followed others' advice and did not use mayo and used three cans of lump crab instead of two.  Also, I added about 1 1/2 c. cheddar cheese.  I did not put this in a bread bowl.  I used a casserole dish and popped it in the oven for 20 minutes.  I then put it in the fridge until my party was starting.  When my guests arrived, I put it in the oven on 350 for 10 minutes to heat it up.  It was awesome.  It was not very good two days later when I tried to reheat the leftovers, though.

Excellent, easy and quick.  I did add one tbs of Worchestershire sauce for a little something extra.

This recipe was a HUGE hit!  The only thing I did differantly was put it in a bread bowl.  I also added a generous amount of old bay.  I still have co-workers asking me to make it on a weekly basis.

Everyone one loved this dip. I served it with townhouse crackers & tortilla chips. I took the suggestions of others and used some horseradish & sour cream.

This recipe is so much better with a cheddar cheese.  Add about a cup to the mix and then top with about a cup.  Top that with a little old bay.  Also, I recommend substituting some of the mayonaise with sour cream and then adding about a tablespoon of worceshirer sauce.

I have made this dip for parties, and every time there is none left. It is awesome! I followed some of the others advice and put about 8oz of cream cheese, and 1/4 c sour cream, whatever I have for shredded cheese, and a sqeeze of lemon. People can't stay away from this dip, I made 2 batches one day for 2 separate parties we were going to, and both places, the bowl was empty. Can't go wrong with this. I use pita chips and a bread bowl with this recipe.

I gave this 3 stars because I followed the other reviewers advice and made some changes. I used 16oz of cream cheese, 6 green onions instead of a regular onion,2 cloves of garlic minced instead of garlic powder, 3(6 oz.) cans of crabmeat, and added 1 cup of sour cream, 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar, and 2 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning. I just put it all in a 2qt crock pot and let it cook for several hours. It was fantastic!! Everyone loved it. One of my coworkers said she doesn't like crab dips, but she loved this one!

This was my first attempt at making a crab dip, and it was VERY good!  I doubled the servings to 32, and made it for me and my girlfriend's housewarming party this past weekend; it lasted no more than an hour!  I only made a few adjustments to the recipe:  First, rather than using all canned crab meat, I used half canned crab meat, and half lump crab meat from a local seafood shack.  We live on Maryland's eastern shore, so there's no excuse NOT to use fresher, larger chunks of crab meat.  I intended for the canned stuff to be used more as a filler, not so much for flavor.  Second, I too used additional cheese.  I sprinkled a fairly thin layer of shredded cheddar cheese on top before cooking.  And third, I served the dip from the cooking dish, rather than a bread bowl.  And I still cooked it overall for 30 minutes, though 20 minutes with the lid on the dish, and 10 minutes with it off.  This recipe was very easy to make, and I will definitely make it again!  Oh yeah, this should go without saying, but I also sprinkled Old Bay on top :-D

Too much cream cheese and not enough crab. Started with only one block of the cheese and ended up adding two more cans of the crab. This was quite bland so I needed to add a lot of seasonings to give it some zip.

This recipe was soo good!  I use fresh crab meat (take the meat out myself) so it was time consuming, but well worth it.  The second time I made it I was expecting a lot of people so I cheated.  I tripled the recipe but added some chicken.  I steamed chicken and then put it in the food processor to shred and added it so I wouldn't have to use so much crab.  Turned out great.  Thanks!

This was very easy and quick.  I literally brought it outside to my guests, ran back in for something, and it was gone when I got back!  I served with Stacey's Naked pita chips and it was great.  I did add a little Old Bay seasoning and some dashes of hot pepper sauce to give it a little zing, but great recipe.  Love that it uses canned crabmeat!  Will definitely make again soon.

I thought this was pretty darn good!  I made the dip as directed, then baked it for half the time and spooned it into portobello mushroom caps and sprinkled shredded cheese on top (I used cheddar but I would have preferred parmesan).  I baked them in the oven at 400 degrees for about 11 minutes and they made wonderful little appetizers!

Awesome!  Everyone just loved this recipe.  I actually added a little sour cream to it.  It was an accident, as I was going from memory instead of the recipe, and I found I liked it a little better.  It gave it a little more creamier texture.  Its a keeper!

This was awesome!  My family raved about it.  I didn't use the bread bowl and just cooked it in a baking dish.  I added a cup of parmesan cheese and it was sooo tasty!  Plus, there were some leftovers since there was just four of us.  I reheated it the next day for 10-15 minutes on 350 degreees and it was just as good.  Definitely making this again.  Thanks!

This was tasty, but not something I would eat all the time. I added some lemon and old bay seasoning which I think really made the flavor. I would only serve this to big seafood fans.

I've made this a few times and it's always a hit. I usually add more seafood like thawed shrimp or extra crab meat to bulk it up, and I use fresh garlic. I made individual bread bowls with small French rounds for a dinner party and they were certainly impressed.

I have made this many times with a couple of different additions.  I have added shredded cheddar, sour cream, Old Bay (this spice is a must!!), lemon juice, or just left it as is.  Everytime I make it, it is gone within about 15 minutes. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  I even gave my mother in law a gift basket with all of the dry ingredients after Christmas one year.  She loved it, but father in law ate it all!  I can't have a family function at my house if I don't make the crab dip!  Thanks again!

I had to add lemon juice and old bay seasoning to try and give it some zest, but the party I took it to really showed me how bad this dip was because hardly anyone ate it. There's another recipe on here for a Warm  Parmesean Dip that is a million times better than this one. I would make this dip again, but I would add artichoke hearts, and parmesean cheese and sharp cheddar cheese to it, and maybe some minced garlic too.

I made this dip for Christmas dinner and my family enjoyed it so much, I had to make it again the next day for the Redskins' game!  Like others, I made some changes adding Old Bay seasoning (2 Tbs), celery (1/4 cup), shredded cheddar (1 1/2 cups) and fresh garlic.  Yum, yum, yum!

Love this dip!   I have also made it using fresh crab meat (not canned) and or imitation crab meat and it works fine.  I sometimes add cayenne pepper or hot sauce to fire it up a bit.  We all love this, even the kids!

wow, this recipe is really good, but extremely rich tasting. I took note from the other reviewers and added sour cream and lemon juice. I also used the Hawaiian Bread bowl which when baked and topped with cheese is very yummy by itself. Didn't have onion so used onion salt, which is probably a good idea, since I'm not fond of hot onion. Would recommend if big family or potluck, but my hubby had about 6 bites and was full.

So delicious!  I made this last night for some family and at first no one touched it.  They thought it was mashed potatos!  Once I said it was crab, it was gone!  Even the kids liked this one.  I used the shredded cheese advice and definitely think this made it even tastier.  I served it steaming hot and the bread chunks were so crispy!  A wonderful cold-weather treat!

This was "OK" as published but I couldn't resist the urge to doctor it up -- the results were excellent.  First off, I used "sea legs (imitation crab); then I added 1 cup sour cream, 1 tsp horseradish, 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning.  YUM YUM!!  Instead of serving it "in" the bread bowl, I served it in a small crock pot -- it's ever so much better if it stays warm.  I used cubed rye (from the bread bowl!), pita and wheat thins for dipping.  It went quick and I'll be making it again very soon!

I made this for a graduation BBQ last night and it was a HUGE hit!!  I showed up a little bit late (after everyone had already eaten dinner) but my dip was still devoured.  I used 2 green onions, sliced, instead of the white, and added some Old Bay seasoning to taste (along with the S & P).  My original plan was to bake the bread bowl in the oven for the additional 10 minutes with some Parmesan sprinkled on top, but since I was already running late, I just threw the dip into a hollowed out loaf of Sheepherders bread and brought another along for dipping (both untoasted) and ran out the door.  But it tasted GREAT anyways!!  Definitley doesn't need any Parmesan on top, and the bread was great untoasted...it just sopped up the dip and was easy to chew.  I may add some roasted red peppers or some freshly chopped tomatoes next time, just to add some more color!!

Good recipe.  I don't recommend serving with Ritz.  Just didn't seem to blend well, taste-wise.  I made the following adjustments:     8 oz. reduced fat cream cheese,  ~1 Tb finely chopped onion, ~2 Tb finely chopped green onion, 2 Tb mayo, 2 chopped garlic cloves, 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning, ~1 tsp. horseradish sauce, ~2 Tb sour cream, 1 tsp lemon juice, dashes of dill, parsley & cayenne pepper, and put shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top of the dish.  I baked for 20 min, stirred in cheese, sprinkled more on top, and baked for an additional 15 min & served dip in the baking dish.

This crab dip is THE BEST!  I found this recipe about 8 months ago on this site and have made it over and over again.  Everyone asks for the recipe and I gladly share it!  We are garlic fans, so I like to use some pressed garlic.  Also, I make my own bread bowls... New Years Eve, the dip and the whole bread bowl was consumed!  Also, you need to buy (or make) a loaf of bread for extra dipping pieces.  YUMM YUMMM Thanks for putting this on all recipes!

I tried this recipe on New Year's eve after having a hot crab and lobster dip at a restaurant for the first time. This recips is wonderful! It's just as good as the one I had in the restautant and much cheaper! Half the price in fact. Even my 10 year old niece loves it. The only thing is that I don't use a bread bowl, and I add grated marble cheese before putting it inthe oven for the final 10 minutes.

This recipe was wonderful!  I needed something to make with some leftover crab and this worked very well.  My husbands family gobbled it up! I did play around with it and add some hot sauce and some other spices. It is definatly one that you can add your own trademark to!

Really enjoyed the dip - I used fresh crab instead of canned - I also added a little bit of hot dijon mustard as well.  Next time I will be adding artichoke hearts and perhaps some roasted red peppers and maybe capers.  This was a very easy, delicious "different" dip.  Very yummy and definitely a keeper for the recipe box.

Exceptionally bland. Wondering why there are so many good reviews on a nearly tasteless recipe. Ate 1/4 and am trying to figure out a way to somehow rework it and salvage over half a pound of essentially wasted crab. If 1 star wasn't "Couldn't Eat It," there would be a solo star on this rating.

Don't cook it. It's delicious as is. Make your variations, but just eat it with veggies, crackers, or chips (or bread) if you want a fresher taste and no bother. Instant gratification!

We really enjoyed this recipe.....I did a couple of things differently because I ran out of regular onion so I used green onions instead and because we never have mayonnaise, I used Miracle Whip.It was a hit at my gathering, and I will definitely do it again!!

My son LOVES this recipe!  Use canned crab meat (affordable) or Jumbo Lump (VERY expensive in our area).  I would feel comfortable serving either option to guests.

We loved this! We did add a little old bay, but that was it! It tasted delicious. I didn't have a large bread bowl, I had three small dinner crusty rolls, so I made three small bowls and cooked it the same way. I also put the remaining dip in a small glass bowl to cook(because I don't like to waste).

I have made this for several years now. My entire family loves it. Closest thing to lasagna that I have ever made.

Very good, I too modified this by adding 8 oz sour cream, 2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning, a few dashes (to taste) of cholula, and approximately 1/4 cup chopped scallions.  It was a hit!

I dumbed this recipe down quite a bit, and it was still superb! Things I did differently: used fully cooked leftover imitation crabmeat, fat-free cream cheese, light mayonnaise, added in some chopped green bell pepper, and completely ignored the baking component and served this as a cold dip. It got several compliments from everyone!! I served this with Hawaiian rolls and crescent rolls, and it went over splendidly as an appetizer. And I literally threw it together with in 10 minutes. Just wonderful!!

This was ok for me, but everyone else I served it to loved it. I added a couple splenda packets...I guess I was wanting a crab rangoon taste to it, and I didn't quite get there until I added a touch of sweet.

This dip was OK, but nothing like what I expected. We have a restaurant nearby that makes an amazing crab dip with a cream cheese base, and I was hoping this would come close to it, but it doesn't.

I used 8oz. vegan cream cheese and light miracle whip. Also added 1/4 C sour cream to have the dip-- definitely better than the other half. (Cayenne also helps the flavor.) I prefer this chilled. Great with whole wheat ritz!

Easy and looks great. It was gobbled up. I added some Tony Caschere's creole seasoning because I didn't have Old Bay. You can taste it and add some seasoning before you bake it.

This was a great dip and would be wonderful with less cream cheese, a little sour cream, and skip the salt.

This was great!! I used left over crabmeat from a bushel we got with company. A friend of mine told me the bread gets soggy (not this recipe, when they make theirs) and you wind up throwing some out, so I did not put the dip in the bread, kept them separate, but baked both. One of the reviews said it was good hot or cold.......mine didn't last until it was cold so I don't know.

I downloaded this for a friend who made two pans full for a birthday get together. Every 5 minutes folks at the party commented on "What an Awesome Dip, and how none of them had ever had such a great dip like that from anywhere". Did I mention I live in Virginia Beach VA, and believe me there are a 1,000 ways to do crab here, and to get this rating is TOP NOTCH. Can not get a better review than that I think.

Did not care for this one.  Too many onions for my taste.  It also seemed to be missing something.  Maybe some additional herbs to flavor the dip.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I'm very new to cooking and this one was pretty easy to get going.  I used some of the modifications I read in the reviews to make it less creamy and more spicy.  The Old Bay definately gave it a good flavor.  All and all a good meal for me and my fiancee.  Thanks!!!

Like other reviewers, I thought that this made a great base recipe, but I wanted to "kick it up" a bit.  I used chopped up green onion instead of a regular onion, I added 1 tbls of Old Bay seasoning, 1 tbls horseradish, a few squirts of lemon and about 3/4 c of cheddar cheese. Before baking, I sprinkled with more Old Bay seasoning to give it some color. Right before it was done baking, I put the oven on "Broil" just long enough to get it nice and bubbly, with golden brown edges- Yum!

I use this recipe as my base...then put my own flavor to it. I add real garlic (maybe 1 small clove), way less mayo (maybe 2 tbsp max), OLD BAY SEASONING (maybe 2 tbsp, I do it more by color.  I'm looking for a light speckling of oldbay through out the cream  cheese)rather than salt and pepper,  I do all the mixing except the crab in a food processor, and I don't do the bowl instead I make my own bread and slice it.

Wonderful recipe.  Everyone gobbled it up.  Will definately make it again.  I did follow one other person's recommendation and added sour cream, Old Bay and some cheese on top.  Excellent!

This was a fantastic dip!  I made it for my mother-in-law's retirement party and everybody stood right next to it trying to get as much as they could!  I'm making it again tonight.  I don't have the bread bowl this time, but assume it will be just as good in a dip bowl with some crackers and crusty bread.  You've got to try this one!

Too rich and not very flavorful. Can hardly taste the crab. Too much cream cheese. I  added 1/2 lemon, and a tablespoon of garlic to give it more taste.

I made this last night, and used whole wheat pita cheaps as the dipping "mechanism."  I wish I had read some of the previous reviews prior to making it.  Reason being that at first sniff and taste, I found the dip to be "fishy."  Someone recommended using lemon to eliminate any trace of fishiness.  I will have to try that next time.

In addition, it was a bit bland as is.  I had to add much more garlic seasoning and grated black pepper.  I also added a dash of parsley.

I will make this dip again, but this time, I will add much more seasoning to combat the blandness.

Really good. I have had better, but this is definitely passable. I used some claw meat rather than canned meat. Added some hot sauce and lemon juice also. I made it once with and once without the bread bowl. Bread bowl is awesomer.

Very awesome!  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly but after it baked and I tested it I thought something was missing.  I added sour cream as someone else suggested and then the dip was perfect!  I might suggest that more crab be added if you add a cup of sour cream.  There wasn't alot of crab flavor but then again, that's kinda how I like it, no fishy taste.  Good texture but I wish it was a bit more thick, it got kind of soupy.  Will make again with more crab meat.

The recipe as it is is very bland which is why I gave it 3 stars.  If you choose to make this crab dip, you will want to follow some of the suggestions in this review column (i.e. adding lots of Old Bay, more real garlic, garlic salt, parm. chese, etc.).  Modifying this recipe could make it a 5 star, but w/out additions, it's kind of a disappointment.

made a few changes to the recipe, used 16 oz of crab meat instead of the recommended 12oz.  I wish I would have written down the changes I made!  I'm sure I used fresh garlic and added LOTS of old bay.  I think I added 2 tbsp when cooking in a ceramic dish (we didn't use bread bowl!) then when heating a small portion up later I just went to town adding more old bay and it was so much better.  This recipe is BLAND, yes.  Many people have stated that but its a basic recipe to add on.  Next time I'm going to try adding horseradish, cutting the mayo and adding sour cream.

This recipe overall is a keeper if you want to modify it!  Some might deduct stars for that but I really think that this recipe has aLOT of potential!

I do not know my way around a kitchen at all, but decided to try this recipe for a recent family crab feast since 223 people had given it a favorable rating.  I was so excited how this dip turned out that I registered just to review this recipe.  My husband LOVED this recipe and wants me to make more already (there wasn't any left after the party).  I really appreciate all of the reviews with tips.  I tried the onion salt in place of fresh onions and minced garlic (1 tsp) in place of garlic powder (had rich garlic taste).  I also added just a little horseradish and I did sprinkle some old bay on the top before I baked the dip.  I also sprinkled some white cheddar cheese (for the last 10 minutes)   Again, I do not cook, bake, grill, saute, etc at all so this is an easy recipe if I can do it- just have fun with it (I did!)  The ONLY thing that I would change and I am changing for next time - is I didn't like how the bread tasted after I baked it.  It was way too crispy and flavorless.  Next time I will bake the dip separately, cut a hole in the bread, and place a small dish in the center of the bread with the baked crab dish. Fresh bread tasted much better with it (as we tried the dip after we baked it for the first 20 min).  I used Bumblebee canned crab meat and it was very good.  I will definitely make this again!!!

This recipe was wonderful! It tasted just like a professionally catered dish. We served it with toast points rather than in a bread bowl - each piece toasted with olive oil. I highly recommend it.

This turned out really runny.  Not enough crab meat.  Also needed a lot of doctoring up.  I added old bay, more garlic a little lemon juice and parmesan cheese.  Also sliced scallions to add some color.  But what it really needed was a couple more cans of crab meat...which I didn't have at the time.  Will try again with more crab and more seasoning.

This was my first attempt at making a crab dip. I don't think I'll make this one again. It tasted a lot like cream cheese. I ended up dumping in a bunch of black pepper and some hot sauce. That helped, but still far from what I was expecting.

Excellent!  Try increasing the crab to three cans, add two cloves of crushed garlic.  Separate into two separate bowls when cooking.  works better.

I liked this recipe because it had way less mayo than most of the others.  I did follow the suggestions of others & used real garlic.  I also used cayenne instead of pepper & added a bit of Fr*nk's Red Hot for a bit of kick.  Also mixed in a ton of medium cheddar.  The girls practically licked out the bowl!  Thanks

This recipe is amazing. My mother-in-law makes one that to die for and this surpassed it. I made it for the first time while receiving guests and they just pounched on it. The only thing I addes was 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and about 1/4 cup of imitation crab shreds in the last 10 minutes of cooking. I baked it in an ceramic dish instead of in a bread bowl.
Thanx so much for sharing your recipe!

Oh my gosh! I've made this recipe and shared it and have meant to rate this for a couple of years. This is the best crab dip ever. The only thing I added was parmesean or romano cheese. I also used low fat mayo instead and you can't taste the difference. I not too much of an onion person but I cook with them alot,so I used 1/2 the amount. I've made this in the bread and w/o the bread using crackers or tortilla chips for dipping. Everyone will not be able to get enough of this dip.

I have requests for this dip every time I get together with my family.  The new saying is "and Steph is bringing the crab dip"  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I did want to note you can use low fat cream cheese and mayo and it still tastes just as good!!  I also add a little hot sauce and worchestershire.

Very bland, however I will say that individuals who have never had fresh crab meat may like it but I'm from Maryland so I found the can crabmeat to be tasteless.

This is the best crab dip ever! At every family function {especially during the summer} everyone begs me to make this! The only thing that I add to the dip is Old Bay seasoning. Of course, I live in good ole' Maryland!

I loved how EASY this recipe was!  I was cooking a lot of other dishes and this was not only the easiest, but one I got a lot of compliments on.  Also, I couldn't find round bread, so I simply hollowed out a regular long loaf of fresh italian bread and it worked just as well and I was able to slice it up after the dip was mostly gone and people ate that as well! Would definately make again.

I love this recipe! I make it for every party and it's always a favorite. I go a little easier on the mayonnaise (3tbsp instead of 5tbps) but otherwise it's perfect.

A terrific basic dip! My favorite presentation is to serve this dip cold in a round mound on a plate with a "moat" of cocktail sauce surrounding the dip.  This presentation avoids the "bland" complaints many of the reviewers have noticed.  I serve it with Ritz crackers.  Thanks for the recipe...

Great appetizer and easy to make.  I premade it the night before and then baked as directed.  It was very good and everybody loved it.  My husband and I had some leftovers the next day and it was better cold.  It's great hot or cold.

This is good.  I sauteed the onion with some real garlic, crab and lemon to get rid of the "raw" onion/garlic taste.  Added some Old Bay, but be careful you don't overkill with it.  Will make again, but maybe tweek it some more.

Love it!  I've given this recipe away to many.  I like to make it for gatherings.  I like to add 1 cup shredded cheddar and occasionally artichoke hearts for that artichoke crab dip flavor.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it twice to take to parties and both times it got great reviews.  I opt to use 1 can crab meat and 6 oz imitation crabmeat.  Makes the dip a little heartier I think.

This recipe was a great starter recipe, since I had never made crab dip before! I added less onions (we are not huge onion fans!) and a few tablespoons of Old Bay seasoning. All in all it was great!

I'm obviouisly in the minority here, but I did not love this recipe.  I personally found it to cream-cheesy, even after cutting the cream cheese down to one 8 oz package.  I can't understand what I'm missing here.  To each their own, I suppose!

This was a very creamy dip, but a bit bland.  Very easy to make (always important).  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light mayo.  Next time I will take the advice of other reviewers and add some Old Bay and chedder.  That sounds wonderful!

I made this for a Nascar race snack. This was so tasty that everyone wanted more.  I didn't serve in the bread bowl like it says although it would probably be great i just served with thin sliced hard bread.

My husband makes this recipe all the time!  He's begun adding a dash of Worcestershire and some Old Bay Seasoning for a little more kick.  We serve it heated in a Sourdough Bread Bowl from St. Louis Bread Co.  Unbelievably delicious!!!

WOW....took this to a holiday party; was a big hit. So much so that I've been told to bring it to a play-off party this weekend. The only thing I did different was to add about 2-3 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning, some roasted garlic seasoning, & green onion instead of regular. I used a loaf of corn rye (it was the only round loaf available)& it was great. Definitely a nice change from cold dips.

Great dip!  I made it for my picky brother-in-law for Xmas dinner.  He loves crab, but won't eat my crab stuffed mushrooms, so this was a great alternative.  It was a big hit and none of it went home with me.

This dip was the hit of the party!  It was delicious and simple to make. I doubled the recipe for a party of 17 and served with a sliced sour dough baguette.  The dip lasted no time at all!!  Several guests begged for the recipe, while others devoured the bread bowl. I use it at home as a quick snack and/or appetizer.

This recipe was a huge success at a recent event. The bread bowl adds a nice touch! I added some 'redfish magic' by Chef Paul Prudhomme to add some more flavor. Two friends have already tried to duplicate it, so I assume it was a hit!

I made this recipe for Christmas last year and it was a big hit with all of the family.  I served it with several different kinds of keebler crackers.  Look forward to making it again this year.  The only drawback is the expense of the crabmeat.  Enjoy!

I used the canned crab meat.  I thought that it was only okay.  I think it would be much better if you used fresh crab meat.  Then it wouldn't taste as fishy. Not sure if I will spend the money to try it again.

This recipe is so quick, easy and tasty. I made it for about 12 ladies at a candle party and they ate it all.
I will be using this one for a long time.

Terribly bland! Definitely needs more spice and lemon to cut the fishiness of the crab. So disappointing because I wasted some really good lump crab meat on this recipe. I would suggest adding lemon, sauteeing the onion first, and adding some Tony's or cajun seasoning.

It was a huge hit on Christmas. The bread bowl was a must as everyone said the crackers just didn't taste as good with it. By the end of the evening, only a small portion of the bottom of the bread bowl was left. I did modify based on some of the other reviews. I didn't have a lemon handy, so sprinkled 1/2 a lime on the crab. I used 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup mayo, tablespoon of old bay seasoning, only 1/2 small onion, and mixed in close to a 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese before baking.

also, I used large lump crab, very fresh, which I think made the dip that much better.

I hunk I ate half  bowl of dip before putting it on the oven, is so good! I used some fresh crab my friend gave me and I wanted to try something new. I didn’t regret it! Followed recipe as it is! Will try with scallions instead of onion next time just for fun.

I forgot the onions so we used sweet yellows minced and it turned out great. We even took it and stuffed our jalapeños and added bacon and they were fabulous as well

Took the advice of others.  I added a few tablespoons of sour cream, old bay, 1 block of cream cheese and some sharp cheddar both in and on top.  With those changes this is a huge hit at every party.

I am a Marylander, and we have crab dip pretty often. I would STRONGLY suggest adding Old Bay; this was fairly bland without Old Bay. Nice recipe!

I don’t understand how this has so many stars. My husband and I could not eat it. There is nothing in it to give it any crunch or other flavor. It is just a plain white mush of cream cheese, mayonnaise and crab.  I’m so upset I wasted all that good crab.

It was pretty good, but it's not something you want to eat in bulk. The mayonnaise and sour cream is a little excessive, and you might want to keep chunks of crab meat together for better texture

Sort of disappointed in this recipe - - sounded so good.  It was very fishy, which may be my fault but I used claw meat.  Added lemon juice, a little extra cream cheese, Old Bay, and Parmesan cheese after tasting the original mix.  It was better but probably won't make it again.

I halved the recipe and it turned out just fine.  But it is very bland in color.  Next time i may add some paprika for color.

Couldn't rate 5 stars because I made a lot of changes to the recipe. I used 3-6oz cans of crab meat, a tbsp of old bay seasoning, 2/3 a medium onion, horseradish dijon mayo instead of regular, 2/3 bag of shredded cheddar cheese, no salt or pepper, and I baked it about 25 minutes instead of 20. Was delicious, would make again.

Great recipe!! So easy to make, too! I did half the recipe and put a couple of dashes of Worcestershire and cayenne pepper in it to give it a little kick, but everyone loved it and ate it  before they did anything else!!  Thanks for the delicious recipe!!

Great - I skipped the garlic powder, only did 8oz of cream cheese. I was worried that the onion was too much - I did a whole small one and it seemed like a lot...but it was fine. I also added a tablespoon of horseradish. Delish. It was demolished.

If you make this recipe exactly as it appears, it is far too bland.  If I were to make it again I would probably add horseradish, cayenne pepper or sharp cheddar cheese to it.  I needs something to put some zip in it.

I made this and followed Tiffany"s suggestions. I used 1 pound of Alaskan King Crab, 1/4 cup fresh parsley, 1 Tbs Old Bay, 1 cup of fresh grated Parmesan cheese, sauteed onion, and cooked in stoneware for 20 minutes at 350 and then transferred to a  bread bowl and baked for 10 more minutes. Thankful for the recipe and the suggested revisions. I am mainly keeping track of what I did differently to make again because my friends loved it!

like noelle's comment I used 8 oz cream cheese and 3/4 cup lite mayo instead of all the cream cheese. I also added sharp cheeder and old bay to the crab dip mix and then added some on top when it was all most ready. Then I would def give it a 5 star. Excellent!

I used 3 (6oz) cans of crab meat, 1 cup sour cream, 2 (8oz) pkgs of cream cheese, I sauteed 1 half of a sweet onion with garlic in a tbsp of butter. Added Old Bay, and garlic powder to taste. Add 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese, grated and a dash of salt.  May be served hot or cold with bagel chips, or garlic or onion flavored crackers.

Added three spoonfuls of sour cream, used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and used old bay seasoning along with salt and pepper to taste. It was awesome.  I also tried it with fresh artificial crab and it was still pretty fantastic.

This crab dip was a bit plain.  I added a shake of cayene pepper and topped with cheese.  However, my bf said he preferred it without the cheese.  Really good though

This was really good. I did add some old bay, sour cream and colby jack cheese. One reviewer said it was too runny. It said to drain it, I also pressed it in the strainer, and get the excess water out.

Very tasty. I used canned crab though and won't do that again. Made it too runny. Lump crab would have been better. Baked it in a dish instead of bread and served with crackers, which turned out fine.

This one is a hit! I almost don't want to share the recipe because it's so easy and people think I slaved over it! I always add about a cup of grated cheddar to the mixture and sprinkle some on top before it goes in the oven. I serve with tortilla chips--much easier to scoop the yummy crab dip up!

I made this for a small gathering. I halfed the recipe, so the size was perfect for the party. I, never having had crab dip before, had no idea what it was supposed to taste like. I followed the recipe, but also followed the tips (not quite so much cream cheese, a little more Mayo, and Chedder Jack on top). My husband loved it (I don't think I'm as big of a fan of crab dips, so I can't say I count!), and everyone else thought it was a big hit as well! Very easy recipe, too!

Made this on our final night of vacation and we were looking forward to it all day!  The raw onion was awful and overpowered the entire flavor of the dip.  Should definitely have sauteed it first.  I used a bit of Old Bay and cheddar as suggested by other reviewers but I can't say that improved things much.  

The base was too much cream cheese and mayo - anyway. . . altogether disappointing.  The only good thing I can say is that the portion fit exactly in a bread bowl and it LOOKED good.

I gave recipe a 4 star instead of a 5 since I modified it. But the recipe was a good starting place for delish crab dip. I added some green pepper, fresh cilantro, and a lil red onion, all finely chopped in my Ninja food processor.  The dip was fantastic with the fresh veggies in it--it tasted like summer!!

I have got to say that i made this recipe for easter and it came out great.  I made it the night before and set it in the fridge so all of the flavors could mix together and then the next day i added a little shredded cheddar cheese and baked it in the oven.  Everyone raved over it and asked for the recipe.  Such an easy recipe and the taste is excellent!!

I love this recipe!  I made it for my son's birthday last year (about 15 people came) and it was gone by the end of the party.  I'm making it again this year.  I might make 2 batches though.

This is a really tasty dip. I just wasn't in the mood to chop onions so I used some minced onion with some onion powder and threw in a little chives. I served this with Triangular Delights from this site. A crunchy side is a perfect pairing for this creamy dip.

We like this dip when it was hot, but even better when it was cold.  Also, I added a can of small salad shrimp to make it a bit thicker.

Four stars for being a great base recipe.  I added some chopped red peppers and green onions, and followed others' advice about adding sour cream, old bay, cheddar cheese, and lemon juice.

Very good as is, a good hit trust me. The only things i did different was just a few dashes of cayenne pepper, and a few dashes of hot sauce just to spruce it up. I bough a loaf of focaccia bread and cut it into three 1/2" pieces. toasted the bread on both sides, spread the dip on one side of each piece of toast. Threw some chedder/monteray jack cheese on top, then placed under a 400 degree broiler for a few minutes and wallah! perfect crab toast the you cannot put down!

The taste was great, how the texture was a lot more "solid" than expected. I wasn't able to dip into it, it had to be cut apart with a knife and placed onto crackers that way. But it tasted awesome.

VERY GOOD! I added a little cajun seasoning, but I am sure it would have been good with or without it.  It is good on crackers or bread.

I had more crab than the recipe called for so I added a little extra cream cheese and a few spoonfuls of sour cream, a little jack cheese melted on top and it was perfect!

I added in a can of artichoke hearts, which I chopped up so they were distributed throughout, and that added a nice additional flavor.  I would sample the dip and see how it tastes to you, then add in extra garlic power or onion or another spice depending on what taste you are going for.  Overall, pretty good!

I made modifications to this recipe right off the bat, so I'm giving it 3 stars. I added a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 a cup of shredded mozzarella, a shallot instead of onion, substituted 2 cloves of garlic for the garlic powder, added a tablespoon of horseradish, and omitted the salt because of the added cheese. I used toasted pita triangles instead of the bread bowl. I found it to be a little oniony, otherwise it was great! Next time I'd try the recipe with onion instead of shallot and cut back to maybe 3 tablespoons of minced onion. I didn't have Old Bay so I can't comment on its benefit. Because I didn't use the bread bowl, I cooked it for 30 minutes in a casserole dish.

Very bland. I was not impressed at all. I wish I had enjoyed it as much as Boyou Gator did. After I realized it was a flop I added some horse raddish and some Worcestershire sause. At least then it was ok.

Made this for the holidays with a few changes. I used Old Bay Seasoning (A BIG MUST!!), added a little more lemon juice, used chive cream cheese, and also added some fresh minced garlic. Also sprinkled with cheese before cooking...and it was great! Even the kids loved it. I love serving it in the bread bowl...will make again! Thanks!!

Made this for the Winter Classic. I followed the recipe exactly as written and served it with crackers and fresh veggies. It was fantastic. Delicious hot, but very good at room temp. This is a keeper.

I think this recipe is terrible.  It has absolutely no taste.  Tastes like a bowl of cream cheese with a little crab meat stirred into it. I put in some Old Bay seasoning, but probably did not put enough in.  Would never make this again.

Served as an appetizer for a family dinner, but everyone said it was on the bland side. next time I will add more garlic, and take the advice of others perhaps adding some Old Bay seasoning.

Add some Old Bay Seasoning and this is perfect!  I brown in off in the broiler at the end.  It's the first thing to go at a party...

I love this recipe.  I have made this for my the last 2 Christmas parties an will again this year!  Everyone loves it!  The only thing I do different is, I sprinkle the top with a generous amount of Old Bay  and add TBSP of horseradish when I mix it.  I bake it in a ceramic crock & serve it with pita chips. Its always a huge hit.

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer this year.  It was really really good but I had to modify the recipe a lot.  First of all, it is a lot of preparation to flake through the crab (I used fresh).  I added sour cream, salt, old bay seasoning (lots of it), minced garlic (2 cloves), and melted some cheddar cheese over the top.  I served it in a bread bowl and it was almost all gone.  Everyone really liked it.

This dip is awesome!  I first made it a year ago to bring to a birthday party and it didn't even last a half hour!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and I added 1.5 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning. I used a light rye bread bowl because I couldn't find an Italian bread bowl but the flavor of the rye bread was also excellent with this dip.  I made this again for another party tonight and it is all I can do to keep from eating it BEFORE it's baked.  I'm going to bring copies of this recipe to the party tonight because I KNOW people are going to ask for it.  I'm going to make this again for our weekly Sunday afternoon football games although I think I may have to double the recipe for that.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing this!!

Great, easy recipe.  I used green onions and minced garlic instead of regular onions and garlic powder.  Also added a tsp (eyeballed) of dijon mustard. Some people said it didn't taste much like crab, more like cream cheese (reduced fat). Bread bowl was great. I would make it again and add more crab.

Too runny for my taste, but the flavor is alright. I added cheddar cheese and Old Bay Seasoning as other suggeested, which helped, but it's still not there yet. There are better crab dip recipes out there...I will not make this one again.

This is 5-star! I did take some of the suggestions and used 1T Old Bay Seasoning, 1/4C Colby Jack, and fresh crabmeat so my rating is with those small changes.  It all starts with the base though!

UMMMMMMMM Good.  The only thing I added was Old Bay Seasoning because I love it on seafood.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Pretty good!  I added Old Bay like other reviewers suggested, and used 4 fresh packs of crab from Chicken of the Sea and it turned out great! They dont mention to drain the crab, but I suggest you do! My dip was a little runny.

Fantastic!!!  Even my kids love it.  We are big garlic fans, so instead of the powdered garlic, I mince several cloves of  fresh garlic.

This recipe is always a crowd pleaser and so easy to make! I usually add some horseradish for a little flavor and when I am too lazy too use a bread bowl I always leave it in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes until it is golden brown. Make sure you watch it carefully though so it doesn't burn - all it needs is 2-4 minutes. Then I just serve it right in the pan!

This recipe is easy and sooooo yummy!  I used real crab, minced garlic and sea salt in place of the garlic powder, salt and canned crab.  My husband and boys loved it!  Thanks for the recipe, it is a definite hit in our house!!!!

I added old bay, celery and colby jack, which definitely gave it some need flavor.  It needed more texture, though.  More crab?

I made this for a New Years Eve party and it was well received!  I added chopped celery for crunchiness and also Old Bay seasoning.  I served this cold for the sake of being easier to transport, and it was great.

Excellent! I have made this many times and someone always asks for the recipe. The bread bowl makes a nice presentation but it works just as well served right from the casserole dish. Great on bread and crackers. Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this dip, while good, just tasted like onion.  I couldn't taste the crab at all.  Now, I will admit I used canned crab, but in my opinion, if you're going to spring for fresh crab, just enjoy it the way God meant fresh crab to served, i.e., with butter and lemon.  I was really looking for something where I could save a bit of money but still enjoy the flavor of crab.  I suppose there's the possibility that the canned crab I selected (from Costco) wasn't the best quality and that it wasn't the fault of the recipe.  Regardless, probably wouldn't make again.

This was all right. I added chopped artichoke hearts and chopped roasted red peppers for color. I put some sour cream in, and I topped it off with a little parmesan and shredded cheddar just for presentation. Overall, it was hard to keep warm, and it's not too good lukewarm. I would take the other suggestions next time and serve it in a small crock pot or a fondue pot.

I made this twice - the first time it tasted pretty bland so the second time around, I added sour cream, lemon juice, tabasco and some essence, as previous reviewers suggested.  I have to say I like using lump crab meat the best and definitely liked it better with a little spice.

I used "1/3 less fat" cream cheese and "Light" mayonnaise and this was still fantastic!  I also added a dash of tabasco just for a little extra flavor and shredded parmesan to the top while it was baking - YUM.

I made this recipe for a party and everyone loved it.  I did alter it a bit by omitting the mayo and adding Old Bay Seasoning to taste.

The crab dip was just great. I had to email it to my sister so that she could make it for her party.

It tasted like pickeled herring. I didn't care for it and I was disapointed that I spent good money on the crab meat only to toss out the whole dish later.

I made this for a Christmas day appetizer. Delicious dish when it comes out of the oven, we enjoyed it with holiday crackers. My husband cooked it a little longer to brown the top. Would not recommend it being heated up the next day though. Will serve this dip again!

I made this recipe over the holiday weekend three times!  Everyone loved it and requested I bring it to the next event (Christmas Party, Christmas Eve, Christmas dinner).  Thanks for posting an easy and tasty appetizer!
