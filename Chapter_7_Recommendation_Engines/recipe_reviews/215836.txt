This couldn't be any easier to make. The combination of the Classico sauce and pesto was tasty - I used a bit more of the pesto than 2 tsp because I love pesto. This is an quick, tasty meal when you don't have much time.

I mixed in some sliced mushrooms.  Thinking that next time I will add green peppers too.  The family loved it and didn't complain about there not being any meat.

This was great for a quick and different pasta sauce! I did use homemade pesto, and more than called for b/c I didn't want the rest to go to waste. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
