This review is mainly in response to a previous post. To use such words as "thoroughly uninspired" and "sadly lacking" to describe this dish, is snobbish and in bad taste. If you are going to compare macaroni and hot dogs to an extensive knowledge on Italy and fine Italian cuisine, then please just avoid this site all together. There is no need for such arrogance. I have worked as a chef in many restaurants, preparing elegant dishes daily. Guess what my lunch often consisted of........ HOT DOGS AND MACARONI!! It's delicious. This recipe is good as is. For some palates you may need a little variation but overall I approve. It hits the spot. Buon Appetito!

Mom made this for us kids, but she always used gov'ment cheese instead of Velveeta. (Think of gov'ment cheese as a mixture between Velveeta and mild cheddar cheese....less processed taste.) I get a hankering for it now and then. My kids love it. Sometimes I'll use salsa instead of tomato sauce and it sounds weird, but it's pretty good if you saute the hot dogs, too.

I was torn between three and four stars, but I am the first to write a review, and I didn't want to start this recipe off on a bad note. For starters, I followed the recipe exactly as written in order to be able to write a fair review. The consistency was like soup, which I did not find very appealing. I was leery because of all the milk, but I wanted to try it as written. The taste was o.k. to pleasant, but nothing overwhelming. The most important thing that I discovered was the choice of hot dog to add. I used Sabrett all beef because that's what I had, but the taste was too strong for this dish. A simple Oscar Mayer with very little flavor would be much better for this recipe. This is a nice dish to make if you have a large group of children to feed, etc, but I would be inclined to add about another half box of elbow noodles to this and change the consistency. It was just too soupy. Thank you, though, for posting this. I gave this four stars based on using a less flavorful hot dog. The flavors need to meld together, not fight for top billing. UPDATE: I refrigerated the leftovers and reheated them which changed the consistency dramatically. I have included 2 new photos. My rating remains the same.

Bland & throughly uninspired. My husband was none too pleased, and my children were less than enthused which is a far cry from their usual elation with my Italian cooking. I made this for my family yesterday, and recognized the taste right away as being a recipe I've made before though not from this site The flavor was sadly lacking. While I know that I'm am a tough critic having lived for 3 years in Italy this wasn't even passable to my husband who has only visited there with me. This dish is fine for someone with a bland palate, but if it's flavor you crave then move on to a recipe more original and authentic, LIKE STUPID HOT DOG THING. Wow, what an original and authentic dish that is!

I apologize, the macaroni should be cooked slightly harder than al dente and finished cooking when added in at the end (this will make it so its not soupy). I suggest using classico as that is the way I intended it to be written.

Simple flavor; comfort food & kid-friendly! This is a fun dish that you will like if you've even had a hot dog with mac & cheese on the side! :)
I made a 1/2 batch & I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1tbsp parsley flakes, & 1/2 tsp onion & herb Mrs Dash. I goofed & forgot to saute the hot dogs & the mix was a tiny bit soupy, so I put it all into a 2Qt casserole dish & baked it with some sharp cheddar cheese on top for 20 minutes. I'd also reccomend increasing the hot dogs...they got kind of lost in the mix.

First of all...unless you are the Duggers DO NOT make a full batch. This recipe makes a GINORMOUS amount of food. We have a family of 6 and I doubt we will finish a 1/2 batch. You will be eating this until next week. I am VERY glad I halved it.   I read the reviews, so right off the bat I decided to cook my noodles to slightly harder than al dente and I also reduced the milk by 1/2 cup. I figured I could always add liquids, but couldn't take them back out. I also used about 12 ounces of pasta sauce for my half batch....which is slightly less than called for.  Once I got everything together I let it simmer and cook for the recommended 5 minutes and I got a great consistency.   I was not wowed by the initial taste or the look of this dish. It is kinda...bland. And it just tastes like it is missing something. It is not really tomato-y and not really cheese-y...just sorta....something. We are about to sit down and give it a try and I will let you know what my husband and kids think of it.   So...Kids ate the scoop I served them, but did not ask for seconds. Husband said it was "really bland, but ok". He said to give it 2 stars since it wasn't completely gross. It just isn't our cup of tea, but we like spicy really flavorful food.

This really wasn't bad. Everyone else in my family really liked it more than I did. My main issue was more about texture than flavor. The flavor was much better than I expected - and to have something that my step-son enjoyed was nice for a change. We followed the recipe closely to get a good idea of what we thought about it. We did use only 3c milk, and whole wheat pasta, but that was the only changes we made. We cooked the macaroni for only 5min separately then drained & added to the cheese mix to let the pasta finish in the mix and absorb some of that liquid & flavor.  I would suggest using a flavorful tomato sauce to give it more flavor, I think that's why my guys enjoyed it as well as they all seem to love pasta. I would really like to use half the velveeta and 1c shredded cheddar next time and see how that affects the texture. Also I would really love to brown onion, peppers & garlic with the hotdogs. We'll have this again, it is quick and the guys enjoyed it.

This dish is not pretentious or complicated. It IS tasty and not difficult to make. It is also a dignified way to salvage a meal from cheap cheese and hotdogs, the fuel of the poor (like me). I got crazy and put a little rotel (basically Velveeta with peppers) in the mix, but it would be good with or without it, honestly. I highly recommend it if you have kids/too many hotdogs/need some tasty comfort food. It really hits the spot. The name is charming, too. Well done, I recommend!

Family really enjoyed this.  I did some tweaks do to family likes and what I had.  Only had jarred pasta sauce in the 28 oz. so this is what I used.  Also we do not enjoy processed cheese so I grated up a total of 10 oz of old cheddar cheese, monterey jack and parm.  Had prepped early so when family got home heated in a 300 degree oven for about one hour.

I cut the recipe in half and it fed two adults and two teenage boys with leftovers.  I wasn't sure about the tomato sauce, but it works.  Overall, we liked this dish.  A good alternative to spaghetti to carbo load the night before a race.

I had to modify this slightly because I didn't have any milk on hand.  Instead I used Ragu Cheddar Sauce and kept everything else the same and this turned out fantastic!  For the tomato I used Prego's Veggie Smart and it gave it a nice flavor.  my picky 2 year old even had seconds!

2.16.18  Several reviewers suggested cutting back the amount of milk, so I did, and ended up with a perfect texture.  Would recommend that you do not fully cook the macaroni.  If you do, you’re most likely going to end up with mushy pasta, not a good thing.  I took the recipe submitter’s advice, and substituted Classico® (Spicy Marinara) for the tomato sauce, and I'll saute some onion along with the hot dogs in the future. Tasted and thought the flavor was a little weak, so I did add some chili powder, salt, pepper, and gave it a good shot of Sriracha.  If the flavor satisfies you with only the ingredients listed in the recipe, serve it, otherwise, just add a few seasonings to suit your personal taste (no big deal).  So nothing fancy here, but I must admit that occasionally, I do get a taste for hot dogs, and with the changes I made, this one scratched that itch today.

I doctored this up with organic pasta, real cheddar cheese, uncured-all beef hot dogs, and about half the tomato sauce called for. I added flour & butter and made a roux to thicken the cheese sauce, and made sure to undercook the pasta so I wouldn't end up with a soupy consistency. I also cut back on the milk, using only 2 1/2 cups. This dish was decent. If you're looking for a budget friendly meal that uses pantry staples while you make it until payday, give it a try.

I followed the recipe exactly. Three and a half cups of milk right? I've must have read that measure ten times now. Even when I was putting three and a half cups of milk in I thought - this can't be right! So now I've got a soupy mess.

This recipe was easy and hearty. The weather has been awful, and it was nice to have a really good, stick-to-your-ribs dinner, after a hard day at work. My husband and I thank you, for a tasty change of pace.
