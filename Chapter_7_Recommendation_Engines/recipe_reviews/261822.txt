Simple, quick, and most of all, delicious! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I used an apple peeler/corer/slicer and was done with prep work in minutes.  When the apples were cooked, I just used a potato masher and that worked perfectly for a slightly chunky texture, which I love.

This was FANTASTIC! and so easy.  i made this because a couple of my fellow Canadian Allrecipes Allstars raved about it. being diabetic, and having to watch my sugar intake, this was perfect for me! i made it with the intention of using it atop my steelcut oats at breakfast time. it never made it that far! LOL  looks like i'll have to make some more :)

I made this recipe as written. It was incredible! I tasted it when it was cooked and decided to add the salt; it really added more depth. As I used my immersion blender I realized that left a little chunky this would make a great side to any pork dish, a topping for pancakes........ Thanks for the recipe!

Very good quick and easy recipe. I would definitely double or maybe triple this next time to have a lot of extra.

The aroma of this lovely applesauce is divine, not to mention the taste. It took 10 minutes for the pressure to build, cooked for 8 minutes, then 17 minutes for natural release. I used one of those apple peeler/corer/slicers which slice the apples quite thin, so I didn't need to blend the sauce at all, just a good stir with a wooden spoon did it for me. The 3 tbsp of water was just right. It's the perfect amount of sweetness and spiciness, and I didn't add any salt. I will be buying great big bags of apples just to use for this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe as is in my Instant Pot and it is absolutely wonderful!  My husband said it’s the best applesauce he has ever had in his life!  He begged me to make more.  This will be a family favorite from now on for sure!  Got me thinking that this would make awesome homemade Christmas gifts for family and friends next year!

Excellent as written! I've made this recipe 4-5 times since I had a lot of apples to use up and loved the maple syrup in the applesauce instead of white sugar. My applesauce lover in this house keeps raving about this sauce as well. I used my kitchenaid core/peeler attachment to make this and think it fit close to 10 LB apples in my 8 qt IP and 5-6 LB in my 6 qt IP.  Thank you for the recipe!

The applesauce tasted very good, however, there is not nearly enough maple syrup in this to call it maple flavored.  I had to nearly TRIPLE the amount of maple syrup before I even started to taste anything close to a maple flavor.  Again, without the adding of the extra flavor, the sauce tasted very good but if you truly want maple flavor in your applesauce you will need to add much more than the recipe calls for. Not sure if using maple extract would help, but just something I thought of after the fact.

Simple and delicious. The Instant Pot sure takes the time out of making applesauce. I did miss the smell of it cooking though. I couldn’t smell it at all until the lid came off. Mmmmm! I used powdered cinnamon to taste since I didn’t have sticks on hand and I forgot the salt and didn’t miss it.

This was amazing! The only change that I made was to omit the salt. This will be a repeat at our house!
