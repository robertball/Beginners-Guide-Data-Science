Great recipe! Instead of breadcrumbs I used tiny squares of good quality white bread. It was wonderful.

Absurdly simply and insanely delicious!!!!  If you love oyster stuffing, this is fantastic!  The oyster flavor is present throughout, yet not overwhelming for those who are not oyster fans.  I used one bag of Pepperidge Farm herbed bread stuffing for this recipe and it was the perfect amount.  Cajun seasoning is a great addition, as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!
