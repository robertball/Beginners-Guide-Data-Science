Yum! I used seasoned panko crumbs and just a sprinkle of Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I didn't think these were gonna turn out as good/crispy as they were. A great new way to enjoy zucchini...and it's healthy too!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

To our surprise, these were fantastic!  They were very flavorful and nice and crispy.  I used two larger zucchini and baked for 15 minutes at 425 on the lower oven rack. I used about 2/3rds a cup of Panko but kept the cheese and seasoning amounts the same (and ended up with enough left over for another zucchini). I used a Cajun seasoning blend instead of Italian since we had a spicy spinach and feta turkey burger with them but am sure the Italian would be just as tasty.  We will definitely have again.

I have made these by shredding zucchini then mixing all together to make a patty.  I also add a little garlic, and onion.  If you really want a super low cal version, use egg beaters, less panko, and fry in pan with Pam.  So good and filling!

It's Zucchini season! YAY! Really loved this recipe, except I prefer to slice my Zucchini into thin, round pieces. I think it just tastes better! The panko on the outside was crazy good.

I liked this recipe and would make it again. I used two store bought average-size zucchini instead of three and had plenty of fries for my husband and I. I salted the zucchini before breading.  However, I did not have regular Italian seasoning on hand so I used salt-free Italian seasoning. This may have been why the zucchini fries did not seem quite salty enough for my taste. The next time I make this recipe, I will try using regular Italian seasoning or use Panko bread crumbs with Italian seasoning added.  I think a little garlic powder would also add additional flavor.

Pretty good recipe.  I'd tried other recipes that didn't add the Parmesan and they weren't as crisp or tasty.  I'd suggest turning at about the 8 minute mark and again at the 13 minute mark for even browning and crispness.  I'll make it again.

This recipe is great. Good way to use up those never-ending zucchinis!! I did use the bottom rack of oven to bake. I baked at 425 for 15 minutes. They browned very nicely. I'll definitely make this again.

No eggs in the refrigerator so I used 62 grams creamy ceasar dressing and it turned out great. And since the dressing already contains spices I only added a sprinkle of salt and dried white onion granules. Fantastic flavor!

I also substituted panko and added a little garlic powder. Used the squash because I had it on hand. Very light and crispy and would be excellent on any vegetable!

Everybody loved this! I served it with Mojo pork sandwiches so I used Adobo spice this time and no dipping sauce. But marinara with the Italian will happen next time we make this. Great new way to enjoy zucchini.

This recipe was very easy and the zucchini chips were nice and crisp.  The coating definitely needs more salt as they were a little bland.  I have lots of zucchini in my garden so I anticipate making this recipe many times.  Delicious with ranch dressing as a dip.

Thank you for posting.  Like any cook, I made some modifications.  Use your knowledge and what you have on hand to make good food.  The reason I return to all recipes often!   I had a monster size zucchini from the garden so I cut into big nuggets instead of fries.  I did use flour in my dredging process but some breading still came off.  I added garlic powder.  425 is the key otherwise the zucchini is soggy.  At this temp and for 15 mins, the breading was brown and zuc tender.  Since zucchini is basically tasteless, I would use a little more salt or another spice to amp it up next time.  I put out an array of dipping sauces.  Great lunch.

Did not care for this recipe. I feel they lacked in flavor, very bland. Needed some garlic powder or something to enhance flavor.

Easy and tasty...cutting into french fries was as tricky as it was necessary.
I will try it again with more attention to the cutting.

Really enjoyed this concept. Used plain panko with the Parmesan and used tandoori spice instead of Italian. Really good!

These were actually really good and crispy!  Since I had only two small zucchini, I sliced them into rounds and decreased the amount of panko and parmesan cheese. I also dredge using the flour-egg-panko prep, as I believe that's what helps to hold the breading together and make them crispy.  I did add some onion/garlic powders into the panko and replaced the Italian seasoning with basil. They were a good side to the main meal, and these would be a great, healthy snack too. I liked dipping them in marinara, but my 8 year-old DD enjoyed hers plain. I will definitely make these again!

I had some zucchini (small-med sized) that was on the verge of getting old, so I had to use it up.  I cut the zucchini in half then in 8ths the long way..  I added a bit of garlic powder, onion powder and paprika to the breadcrumb mixture, as well as dredged the zucchini in flour (also with a bit of salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne in it).   They came out perfect! I will definitely make this again, though I didn't use up all the breadcrumb mixture so I will probably start with half so as not to have so much waste at the end.  Otherwise, I wouldn't make any other changes.

I thought they were pretty good.  Not necessarily saying it was the recipes fault (It could have been mine). The bread crumbled off pretty easily when you tried to pick them up or dip them and I think they needed a bit more flavor. I think I should've kept them in the oven more than 15 mins, that probably would've helped them keep together better. Overall, I enjoyed them for making them for the first time.

This was great to go with veggie burgers. I added a little red pepper flakes, less Panko, but left the rest as is, and was very happy with the end result. Thank you!  A healthier version of onion rings  and a burger!

I used half the amount of panto crumbs and twice the amount ot Parmesan cheese. 1 egg was plenty. Had to bake for twice as long, mine were still half raw.

I have made a recipe similar to this,  I like to add onion and garlic powder to the coating.  Also they will  come out  crispier if before you dip them in the egg dust them with  flour then dip in egg and then in panko

This was very good and easy to make! We used marinara and ranch for dipping options.

Easy and new way to serve zucchini that even the kids enjoyed. I cut back the Italian seasoning to 1.5 tablespoon and added a little garlic powder to suit our taste.

These were good!! My husband who is not a fan of zucchini tried one and was hooked! He ended up finishing them off! Can't wait to make another batch! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I love zucchini in different ways and this will be on my list as one of my favorites.  I didn't use the Italian seasoning, I used a little dill seasoning  and they were great.

I made this without the parmesan cheese to cut down on the calories a bit and it was still fantastic.  Will make again!

So good and easy to make! I used yellow zucchini, as the farm stand I go to had an abundance of them on sale. I will be making them again.

I only added 1T of Italian seasoning and some garlic powder....and a lot more cheese. Other than that, did everything else the same. It was pretty good.
