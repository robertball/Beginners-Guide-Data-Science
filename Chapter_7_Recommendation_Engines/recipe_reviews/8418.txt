I LOVE this recipe.  I've made it many times.  The first time I made it, I bought the ingredients to make the cream cheese topping and then decided not to.  When the cake cooled, I just turned it out upsidedown on a platter and sprinkled it with confectioner's sugar instead.  It was beautiful, delicious and LESS FATTENING.

Both of my grandmothers use to make this cake when I was a child. One grandmother used vanilla and the other used lemon in the icing.This cake has always been a family favorite. Remember the batter is very thick before you put it in the pan so don't be alarmed.

This cake used to be on the menu at a restaurant I worked at.  I reduced the sugar and oil with no ill effects in the cake.  It was excellent.  I will have to compare it with the original recipe when I unpack, I think it had more cinnamon.  The crust softens after a day or two in the fridge.  I prefer it after the crust has softened and the flavors meld.

Is this cake supposed to have a very thick crunchy crust?  The middle was nice and moist and very good but my husband hated how crispy the outside was and I didn't like it much myself.

My SISTER makes this cake and flat REFUSES to share the recipe with us!  Oh, but she shamelessly flaunts this wonderful cake in front of us!!  Well, thank you for sharing your recipe.  This is by far one of the very best ways to use apples ever....I've taken this to every pot luck we're invited to and people actually ask us to bring it.  Really worth making - double it, it doesn't last very long!  :0  (I can't wait till she comes to visit and I present her with slice!)

I have made this recipe for years. Everyone loves it. I got this recipe in a recipe collection called "My great recipes" that I ordered from a cookbook. Everyone asks me to make this cake. I love it warm.

This is the same exact recipe that I use. I found it in a Bensen & Hedges cookbook called Recipes from Great American Inns. It says this cake is served at The Captain Whidbey Inn in Coupeville, Washington. I love this cake and my family is always requesting me to make it.

WOW! I love this recipe! We only eat granny smith apples and I ended up with a bag that weren't, so I was looking for a recipe to use these up and this just what I was looking for. On the sweet side, but man it hits the spot. Thanks for sharing!

A good, if somewhat ordinary, cake with a nice moist texture.  Like similar cakes, I think it tastes better after it sits for a day.  Not wanting to spend for 2 pkgs of cream cheese, I halved the frosting-- but it's the best part!  This would be a good choice if you don't want a really sweet cake and you like to taste walnuts.

This is heaven! I had to use round cake pans but it turned out VERY nicely. My crust (on both batches) was crusty like a very light pie crust but the center was this delightfully tender cake. Great texture. 
I skipped the cream cheese topping and paired it with a rum buttercream instead...YUM. This will be a perfect for the holidays! And breakfast. And tuesday. And any other day of the year...

Almost perfect!  Washington Apple Cake is my husband's FAVORITE, but I lost my recipe in summer flooding.  This version seemed a little thicker in batter and didn't spread as well...I ended up making 1 1/2 batches to cover the 9X13.  Otherwise, I'd very happy to have found this!

We have made this excellent recipe for many years.  We found this EXCELLENT recipe in the 1980's; in "Benson & Hedges presents, "Recipes from Great American Inns" on page 125.   It was published by Phillp Morris Inc. for Benson & Hedges.   There are many other excellent recipes in this book.  This is one of seven excellent recipe books that Benson & Hedges published during this time period.

This is my go-to fall recipe.  I have been making it for years, lost my cookbooks and was thrilled to find the recipe again.  I've never had anyone not love it.  I plan to try making it in a bundt pan this weekend.  I'm sure it will turn out perfectly!

It was just ok. The apples didn't add too much. Wish it had more apple flavor. I used a little more than 4 cups. I just wasn't that crazy about it but everyone has different likes and this wasn't one of mine. Sorry.

I have used this recipie for over 20 years.  Everyone loves it.  I usually make these "enhancements":

I add about 1/2 teaspoon of ginger
1/4 teaspoon of allspice to the flour mixture.
1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract to the cream cheese frosting.

I made this cake for a family gathering for the first time and it was a big hit. I served the cream cheese frosting on the side since it wasn't even needed and left it optional. I used 1 egg and 2 eggs substitutes in addition to canola oil. I have made a lot of cakes from this site but this is now one of my favorites.

I modified the icing recipe a bit and added in 1 1/2 cups of cool whip - YUM! This was the first cake I baked from scratch. I used honey crisp apples hand picked from the orchard. It was a hit. I think I finally have a signature holiday desert :-)

This doesn't need frosting at all. I love this cake because it's so light, unlike most fruit breads.

I liked it..............but just too much sugar for me.  Next time I would cut back the sugar in the cake and the topping.  More cream cheese, less sugar.
