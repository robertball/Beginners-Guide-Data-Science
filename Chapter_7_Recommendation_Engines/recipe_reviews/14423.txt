I thought that the dressing for this salad was pretty boring. I added approximately 4T of the rice vinegar, more lemon juice, and around a tsp. of soy sauce. That helped alot! I also sprinkled toasted slived almonds on top when it was served. I also used sweet red peppers instead of the green. Along with the carrots, it was a beautiful salad.

Very good. I agree that the dressing needed something. I substituted one of the Tbsp of oil with sesame oil and added a Tbsp soy sauce and 1-2 Tbsp sugar. I also added some fresh chopped cilantro and used red instead of green pepper. Very good! Great to take to a picnic - no mayonnaise!

I was looking for a low fat version of the traditional Asian salad w/ Ramen noodles and this is it!  I only used 3/4 lb cabbage, 1 shredded carrot, etc.; I increased the amount of rice wine vinegar to 3 T while keeping the lemon juice and olive oil the same.  I will probably add toasted almonds to make it a meal!

I agree that the dressing is very bland. I ended up adding about a tsp of sesame oil, some more lemon juice and a little sugar. I also threw in some red bell pepper for more color. Pretty good. I'd make it again with a couple more tweaks. Thanks.

Excellent recipe. The snow peas really make this slaw stand out. I did use more lemon juice and vingar for a bit of extra zip.

Easy to prepare but I had to add a lot of things to the dressing to liven it up including sugar. Didn't like it enough to bother making it again.

The flavors just didn't blend well. Even with suggested additions to the dressing, it was not very tasty.

Fairly good recipe. Dressng does need help, as others have said. There is no need to blanch the snow peas. Just rinse and throw in.

Delicious use of fresh vegetables.  I made a half batch with the dressing as written and it would rate it a 3-star.  Good, but lacking a little zip.  With the other half I used "Maui Onion Dressing" from this site.  We then would give this a 5-star rating.  I will be making this again as it was well received with the group I shared it with.  Thanks Barrett for sharing.

Loved the combination.  I also added more rice vinegar and lemon juice, and a little bit of spenda to cut the tang a little.  Will try the soya sauce idea next time.  Very good - enjoyed it!  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely love this recipe.  I did change the dressing a little bit.  I used 1 1/2 T sesame oil and 1 1/2 T oilve oil and used about 3 T of rice vinegar and about a 1/2T of celery seeds.  I mixed the dressing before I added it to the slaw mix.  Awesome flavor and so very healthy!

Like the veggie combo (subbed red bell for green), but I had to improvise a dressing at the last minute.  Did not care for the tartness of the dressing, and I will not make it again.  Sorry, this was a miss for us.

I agree that this is a wonderful lower fat version of the typical Asian slaw that uses ramen noodles.  I also agree that the dressing was a little bland though, so, as others suggested, I increased the rice wine vinegar to 3 tbsp. and the lemon juice to 2 tbsp.  The colors in this slaw are very eye-appealing too, though I would recommend using a red or orange bell pepper instead of a green bell pepper to kick up the color and for the sweeter taste.  I absolutely LOVED the crunch of this salad.  It was a wonderful side dish to the Chinese-Style Cheeseburgers on this website.  I meant to top this with slivered almonds as others suggested, but I totally forgot and will add that the next time I try this.

This was an easy salad, perfect for a picnic or summer potluck. I  took the other reviewers' advice and added more of the vinegar and two teaspoons of soy sauce. The salad tasted even better after a day or two, so I think the secret is to make it ahead of time.
