Not as dense as I expect a pound cake to be but it was easy as advertised. You can't really blame the ingredients for tasting like themselves (fake and processed) so I'm giving it 3 stars to average the two I'd give it for taste and four I'd give it for user friendliness and honesty in description. It was sticky and way too sweet for me.

I followed directions as they are written. My family said it tasted good but was not dense enough to be a pound cake. Eggnog cake 4-5 stars.

Well that was fun! The cake rose beautifully and then I tested it with a toothpick after 40 minutes and the cake fell to about 2 inches. So now I'm testing it again after 15 more minutes thinking maybe I can salvage it but I certainly can't serve it to guests. Well now that I have calmed down I have amended my review to 4 stars and not 5 because the cake fell however when I turned it out of the bundt pan it looked perfect I frosted it and served it to guests with rave reviews. Everyone said it was really really good! I'd like to make it again if someone can give any thoughts on why it fell in the middle.

This cake smelled delicious and tasted very good but it was rather plain. It's a pound cake so there's nothing really spectacular about it. It's more on the subtle side. I did frost it with eggnog frosting and that helped intensify the eggnog flavor. If I make it again I'd consider making a fruit sauce to serve with it.

we love this cake! as written! my husband especially and he hates egg nog. i put icing on mine..vanilla or butter cream and then sprinkle with a cinnamon sugar mixture. I've also modified this cake and replaced the ingredients with a vanilla milkshake instead of egg nog for other cakes and occassions and it was great

This isn't as dense as I expected but it is very tasty & moist. I can't drink eggnog but I love it & this was a delightful substitute. I can't find 18 oz cake mixes these days but I found an up-sizing trick online. I added 4 tbsp flour 1 tbsp 2 tsp sugar 1/8 tsp baking powder & a pinch of baking soda. I also added a tsp each of vanilla extract & rum extract. Although the cake tester was clean the cake fell a bit as it cooled but was just fine when a turned it out. I'll be making this a part of our Christmas treats.
