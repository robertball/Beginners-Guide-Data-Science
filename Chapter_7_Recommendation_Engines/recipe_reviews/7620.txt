I have never been so embarassed of something that I have baked in my life, as with this cake!

It was heavy, took forever to bake (no, my oven is not broken...) and people couldn't tell if it was banana or apple!!!  Yuck!  I tried one bite, and had to tell people that they should eat at their own risk....

I've made many, many GREAT recipes from this site, but this one is DEFINATELY NOT one of them!!

Thumbs down all the way.

This recipe was great! Everyone that tried it loved it. We didn't have any walnuts so I just took it out of the recipe.In the flour mixture, I added one tsp cinnamon which turned out really good. Another thing i changed was I added 3 cups of apples instead of 2. The last thing I did was instead of sprinkling the icing sugar on the cake, I added some water to it to make it into a simple icing and poured it over.It was a bit too sweet so i might bring down the sugar next time. I think this cake would also be better in 3 layers rather than 5 (put the whole apple mixture in the center) because it became a little too mushy where the apples were...though still very good. I might add raisons and walnuts next time I make it too. I also made this cake in a ring shaped pan which looked nice with the icing. This recipe was very good!

This cake is fabulous.  My husband is not big on sweets, but he begs me to bake this cake.  I'm terrible about overbaking things, so I sprinkle sugar in the pan before pouring in the batter.  It makes a sweet crust instead of dry cake!  Extremely good with this cake.

very nice.  I cannot stress enough to mix the apples in with the cake mixture, and add at least 1 extra cup of apples.  The texture of this cake is amazing, very smooth and fine, not crumbly or dry.  A great buttery cake without butter, a great recipe for lactose intolerant people.

This cake was quite good.  I did make a few alterations to make it healthier.  First I substituted in 1 cup of wheat flour, second I used fresh oj, third I used 1/2 c oil & 1/2 c applesauce.  I also took one other suggestion from others and that was to use 1 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup +1-2 Tablesp. of brown sugar.  The last thing I did was add in 1/2 tsp. of cloves to the apple mix.

a good turnout!! however, the baking time is just perfect at 50 mins- one should definately check the cake after 50 mins.i thought 2 cups of sugar would be too sweet so i substituted it with 1 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar & i'm glad i did. the cake was deliciously moist with a nice crunchy crust. definately worth the effort!!!

I needed a quick, easy apple cake recipe that used only staple ingredients that I had on hand. No sour cream or buttermilk, etc. This recipe uses only two apples but has wonderful apple aroma and flavor. I took it to a women's group and of all the desserts, they loved this cake the best. I was very surprised and thankful! The cake really was moist and flavorful. Be careful not to overbake. My edges were a little overdone, but the cake was still good. Perfect autumn harvest cake.

This is fabulous.  Per several other reviewers, I modified it as follows: 3 cups apples instead of 2; 1 1/2 cups of white sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white sugar; 1/2 cup oil + 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of 1 cup oil; omitted the walnuts; added 1 tsp of baking soda; and added 1/2 tsp allspice.  I folded the apples into the mixture rather than layering and I baked for only 50 minutes.  I sprinkled with powdered sugar and added the caramel icing (1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, and 2 tsp milk and brought to boil for 2 minutes).  Turned out perfect.  I will sprinkle pan with white sugar next time instead of flour as suggested by another reviewer.  Highly recommend trying this recipe!

I added 4 cups of apples as suggested by others and folded in with the walnuts.  I also used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 veg. oil.  Instead of the suger dusting I made a caramel glaze to drizzle on top. (1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 teaspoons milk, heated to boil 2 minutes) yum!  I would make this again.

I can't say enough good things about this cake.  I took other's suggestions and used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I used 3 cups of Gala apples which are very tasty.  I made it for my family as dessert and brought the leftovers the next day to work.  Everyone loved it and they were very impressed at how the apples stayed mixed in the batter.  Some people told stories of apples sinking to the bottom, but not with this recipe.  This was great warm out of the oven with Vanilla Bean ice cream and cooled the next morning for breakfast.  This is a great recipe either as a dessert or as an addition to a bruch buffet.  I can't wait to make this one again!  Thanks for the terrific recipe:)

After reading most of the reviews on this recipe, I made the following modifications: Reduced the Baking Powder by 1/8tsp, added 1tsp Baking Soda and reduced the sugar by 1/4C and added 1/4C of brown sugar. I also sprinkled a little extra cinnamon into the batter. I used the 4 cups of apples recommended and mixed them into the batter instead of layering. The baking soda lightened the overall texture of the cake so it didn't have the heavy pound cake texture some people commented on. I also reduced the oven temp to 325 because my bundt pan is dark. It cooked for about 1 hour and 20 mins. It was a huge hit, my mother-in-law liked it so well she wants me to make one for her when she hosts her next Bridge game. My husband LOVED it, said it's his favorite apple dessert. We live in Denver and I didn't have any trouble with the altitude, will absolutely make this cake again and again.

I combined 3 tips from the reviews:
used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar
sub. rum for the orange juice
mixed the apples into the batter
This is a delicious cake!  Next time I would use more apples, maybe 3 cups instead so you get apple in every nibble.

This was awesome!! I made it in a Nordic Ware Cathedral bundt pan and it turned out beautifully. Everyone was exceptionally impressed. I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce - next time I'll use all applesauce. The cake was lovely and moist. I'll definitely make this cake again! I also used 4 cups of apples and doubled the cinnamon and mixed the apples together with the batter which made the cake much better. I make this cake all the time!!!

Great cake! I substituted rum for the orange juice and left out the nuts. I also used three different kinds of apples and spread them throughout the mix. Apples in every bite! I made a simple caramel sauce and spooned over cooled cake.cake.

This was one of the first "made from scratch" cakes I ever made and I still make it to this day (started baking in junior high school, now 22).  I decided this was the cake I would make in my first run on my new KitchenAid mixer I got for Christmas and it was PERFECT.  I substituted half of the sugar for dark brown sugar and cut up the apples into little cubes so they would soak up the cinnamon and sugar better.  Cutting the apples smaller also helped in dispersing the moisture throughout the cake.  In addition, next time I will try melted butter instead of the oil.  I feel that would make the cake even more fragrant.  I work in a well-known restaurant and the pastry chef said "I feel like we have a new pastry intern!"  :)

I took review advice and doubled the diced apples.  The cake was delicious with 4 cups of diced granny smith apples, 3 T of Sugar, and 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I also mixed in 1/3 cup of apple sauce to the apple mixture so that the cake would be more moist.  That allowed me to decrease the vegetable oil from 1 cup to 3/4 cup.  I mixed the apple mixture into the entire cake rather than layering it.  (The cook time was okay because I saved 1/4 of the batter to make six little muffins for my family to enjoy. I brought the rest of the bundt cake to a breakfast meeting!) Excellent recipe...thank you!

This cake is extremely good and perfect for many occasions.  I made a couple of changes to the recipe.  Instead of walnuts I used 2 cups of raisins.  It was a wonderful change and reduce cooking time by 5 minutes, which left the cake extremely moist.

My whole family loved this cake. Next time, I will cut down my baking time a bit - it was a touch overdone. Perhaps because I used a non-stick pan. Be careful filling the pan with a third at the beginning. I used too much and didn't have enough left over. Next time I will only fill about 1 inch on the bottom and then divide the rest in half. Happy Baking!

So this is my first review on allrecipes so I hope Ill make this review good. 

First off, I agree with everyone who said to use one cup of reg. sugar and 1/2 cup brown. I think next time I make this recipe I will even cut down even more on the sugar. 

What I did was mix diced strawberries and apples together, and i lined the bottom of the cake pan with sliced apples, and decorated the finished cake with sliced strawberries and frosting. 

It was a very good combination. I want to try making cupcakes out of them next time. 

Enjoy!

Very nice cake, I didn't give the recipe 5 stars because it calls to bake for 55 minutes minimum at 350 degrees. I baked in a high quality nordicware bundt pan I've used several times before successfully with an oven thermometer to ensure the oven is at the correct temperature. The cake was definitely overdone. I would check at 40 min next time and would definitely not bake for more than 45 minutes.

I have made this cake three times since finding the recipe last month.  The cake is very moist and delicious with and without nuts. I did add more apples :) I might add some raisins next time.

My family is Dutch so we have plenty of apple cake recipes floating around but this one is by far the best!! I  agree with the person who posted on 11/28/2003 though; after only one hour the cake was still wet inside. I have made this recipe four times so far and always have to leave it in for and extra 20 minutes. I also only add 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of three beacuse I like the more "pound cake" texture. It's still the most moist cake I've ever baked!!

Don't forget the baking powder!!!  use about 2 1/2 large apples.  Holy  1c oil.... half apple sauce was a good tip.  Very sweet, but very tasty!

This apple cake is the best I have ever eaten.  It is even better than my sister-in-laws and she sells her cakes around the holidays.  I didn't add that many apples as I like to taste the cake also I added crushed pecans as I didn't have any walnuts.  I love the taste and the texture of this cake.  Great recipe

Loved this!  I've made it twice already.  I used other reviewers comments and chopped 3 cups (not 2) apples finely, split sugar to half white/half brown, split oil to half applesauce/half oil, and added a little bit of cloves.   In my oven, 55 minutes was enough, so watch the timing carefully.  I carefully greased and floured my Bundt pan.  After cooling 15 minutes, it came out perfectly.  I dusted it with powdered suger.     I'll also note that it is even better on the second/third day!!  Great for fall!!

Excellent moist cake-made a few changes:
Used 1 1/2 Cups white sugar and 1/2 cup Brown Sugar. 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves.  Mixed all ingredients in mixer except chopped Granny Smith apples.Folded apples and nuts in last. Made a butter rum glaze. 1/2 Cup Butter, 1/2 Cup Brown sugar, 1 tsp milk, 1 tsp Rum and mixed in small sauce pan, brought to a boil and poured over warm cake.  Very delicious.  Could be served with ice cream or a dollup of whipped cream.

I didn't change a thing and this cake was scrumptious, Very moist, even better the next day. I loved the idea of layering the apples on top of the batter. My husband loved it because it wasn't overly sweet. Will definitely make this again... as is.

Served this for dessert at a recent party--everyone LOVED it!  I took other reviewers' advice and used 3 cups of McIntosh apples as opposed to 2 and mixed the apples in with the cake mixture rather than layering.  Also used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup vegetable oil just to cut back on the oil a bit.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The layers of apples are so pretty in cut slices.  I used Granny Smith apples and after cake was cooled, iced with caramel sauce.  I reduced the oil to 3/4 C and it wasn't dry at all.  Next time I will reduce to 1/2 C of oil and add 1/2 C of drained applesauce to add moisture back in.

I can definitely see where other users would have found this cake bland. It does, however, make a WONDERFUL rum cake.  

I could not fine a "from scratch" rum cake recipe that appealed to me, so I made this and modified it just a little.  It worked great!

I subbed rum for the orange juice, subbed half the apples for rum-soaked raisins, and soaked the cake in a rum-butter-apple juice glaze over night.  Amazing.  I also added extra cinnamon to the apples, and added some to the glaze (I like a lot of cinnamon). 

Best rum cake I have ever tasted.

I've been baking this cake (minus the walnuts-- we're not fans) with my mother since I was a little girl, and it's always been one of my favorites. We use more apples and cinnamon than are called for, and a bit less sugar. We've had the best luck using good, firm baking apples sliced to about a quarter inch thickness-- this makes them layer nicely and gives the finished cake a good appearance.

This was a disappointing recipe. It as good as we were hoping.  It was plain & boring, the cake itself doesn't have much flavor. The only change I made was going with some other's suggestions of using white and brown sugar. It looked beautiful but just not much flavor.

This cake is great!  My son absolutely loves it.  The only changes I make is that I added a little more apple to it, and I make a simply glaze out of the powder sugar.   For a change sometimes I put a little spray butter on it and warm it up.  Very yummy.

This is a very moist cake.  It 'could' have used a little more apple in it, as it cookes down, but then I'm not sure if it might turn out mushy in the end.
I don't like to use as much oil as this recipe calls for so I split the oil with 1/2 applesauce (it was actually peach flavor).  I stirred the apples into the batter as others suggested, and I added a dash of nutmeg for a little more zest.  To be honest, I think it could use more cinnamon.  Maybe another 1/2 tsp.  It seemed on the bland side 'spice' wise - but that is because I love anything with cinnamon in it!  I know some people don't like to be 'heavy' on the cinnamon - but I do!  I topped the cooled cake with a glaze of : 1 1/2 C confectioners sugar, 1T butter melted, dash of popcorn salt and 2 1/2 T apple juice.  Mixed the glaze and let it set up about an hour to let the butter firm up, then drizzled over the cake.  The little extra flavor from the juice within the glaze adds a nice touch.  The glaze isn't overly sweet, as the salt offsets the sweet, as does the apple so it comes out tasting like a sweet apple glaze. YUM!  I can't wait to see what the folks at work think when I bring this in!

Excellent cake - I made some of the changes suggested by others: 4 cups apples, extra cinnamon, and baked at 325 since I used a dark-coated, non-stick bundt pan.  Then I made my own change and drizzled a glaze over the top (2 cups powder sugar and 5-6 tbs. orange juice).  The cake was SO moist, even days later and my dinner guests raved about it!  Will do again.

I made a few changes to the recipe: add 1/4 cup sour cream and reduce vegetable oil by 1/4 cup.  Add 1 tsp. orange oil.  Bake for 1 hr 15 mins.  Also, I wanted to add more flavor - 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, 2 tblsp orange juice or to desired consistency, 1/2 tsp orange oil, 1 tsp dark rum.  Mix and strain, if necessary, then drizzle over the cooled bundt cake.  I agree that the cake is really good.

Excellent Bundt cake.  I use 3 large Honeycrisp apples and stirred them into the batter.  I also only used 2 tsp. baking powder because I like a heavier cake.  My timing was about 45 min.  After cooling, I glazed it with : boil on med...1/2c butter, 1/4 c water, 1 c. sugar, 2 tsp. imitation rum or vanilla.
Boil stirring constantly for 5 min.  Pour over cake.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  Everyone that tried it really liked it. It was gone in no time.  I too made a few alterations.  I added a little orange rind to the batter, along with cranraisins.  I doubled the amount apples as well, and added a little extra cinnamon to the apples.  I sprinkled the top with powdered sugar and lots of finely chopped walnuts and more cranraisins.  I am making it again for the other side of the family for Christmas.

This recipe yields a wonderful cake. The only thing I did differently was that I didn't alternate layers instead I just mixed the apples with my batter and the result was amazing. I've already baked this cake a couple of times and I'm about to make another one because I have guests tonight and everyone's requesting this cake! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was GREAT!!  I could give it a 10!  I was given a bag of apples and was trying out new recipes when I came across this one.  THANK YOU!!  So very easy to make and I put half in the freezer for winter.   Very nice addition of the orange juice.  Maybe I will add a little zest next time.

I would give more then 5 stars..if possible! Moist and delicious.  Coated pan with cooking spray then powdered sugar; used more cinnamon and added pumpkin spice to the apples; used granny smith and red delicious apples chopped small and folded into the batter; all cinnamon applesauce(all I had)  in place of the oil; added cinnamon extract in addition to the vanilla; and finnaly - made a streudel topping and placed a layer in the middle then a layer on top...didn't have any problems with over baking at time specified in recipe!! Made for moms to eat at playdate and everyone LOVED it!! Thanks for sharing the recipe and numerous reviews!

Excellent cake!!  As others suggested, I folded the apples into the batter. I also added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the apples, omitted the walnuts (only because my dad dislikes them) and made a glaze for the top rather than dusting with powdered sugar.  Turned out perfectly moist.  Will make this again for sure!

I made it using 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 applesauce & 1/2 vegetable oil and the cake was very flavorful and moist.  Some people said they used juices other than orange juice (non-citrus) but that might be a mistake because I think the acid in the OJ reacts with the baking powder...not sure how that works exactly.  I made this without the walnuts because I am serving it to a roomful of 5-6 year old kids.  Turned out great.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I am not a particular fan of apples, so when a family member gave me 5 lbs of red delicious I hit Allrecipes to rescue me.  I took suggestions from others and used 1 cup white sugar with ½ cup of brown sugar, added a banana and used ½ cup of oil and ½ cup apple sauce in place of 1 cup oil as well as increased the amount of apples.  If ever I am loaded up with apples again I will turn to this infallible recipe.

This was a hit at my women's retreat.  I did use an extra cup of apples and substitited apple sauce for half of the oil as others suggested.  The result was great!  Very moist and not too heavy at all.  Yummy!

I substituted half the white sugar with brown sugar, and I replaced 1/2 c. of the oil with applesauce.  This cake was too dense and had an unusual taste to it...people at work like it, but it's not one I will be making again, sorry.

I made this recipe with gluten free flours (white rice, potato starch, tapioca starch, and xantham gum) and it turned out so well that I think I'm going to go back for seconds. This is by far the best sweet recipe I've ever made! EVER!!!

This cake turned out REALLY well.  I was a little worried becuse I only had two apples to put into it,but it still turned out really well regardless.  I also used the caramel glaze, thanks to whoever posted the recipe down there , it was a lifesaver :) I am about ot make this one again, and I highly recommend it. My family loved it!

The consistency of this cake was very nice, but my family found it bland.  I added 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  It made it much tastier.

This is delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. Make it every year at Thanksgiving, and people take this instead of the pumpkin pie.  Great recipe.

I was very disapointed in this cake.  I expected something much sweeter.  It tasted like apple bread, but not a cake.  I even made caramel frosting to pour over it, but it still didn't taste like a cake.  I will not make this again.

This is one of the best cake recipes I've ever tasted.  When I tried it the second time, I used a 10 inch tube pan and put a piece of foil over it for the first 45 minutes and it made it a nice golden brown.

I made this for a family get together. Everyone loved it. We have an apple orchard in our family and we are always looking for new apple recipes to make in the fall. Fairly easy to make and pairs well with "Caramel Frosting I" from this site. Thanks for the great recipe.

Had great results with this cake. I made a lot of the tweeks that other members suggested: I used 2 7/8 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda; used 1/2 cup apple sauce (homemade) and 1/2 cup sunflower oil; used 1 cup 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup unpacked brown sugar; also did not layer but just mixed. 

I must have used a smaller bundt cake because I was left with extra batter which I made into muffins. I have to say, they were just as delicious in that form and could be made even better with a streusel topping. The cake rose nicely and had great flavor. 

As a last point, it was especially good the next day--and infinitely more moist. Day of I was little dissapointed at its apparent dry-ness. One day changed that entirely. Will definitely be making this again.

This was great!  I was looking for a quick easy recipe, and this was it.  I didn't have OJ so I used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce - this made it really moist.  I was afraid that using 4 cups of apples, like other reviews had mentioned, would be too much, but it was perfect! I did also mix the apples into the batter instead of layering, and loved it that way.  I put chopped walnuts and a sprinkle of sugar in the bottom of the bundt pan before I poured the batter in - it made a great crunchy 'crust' on the top of the cake!  Also drizzled it with the caramel glaze after it cooled as other reviews mentioned (1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 2 tbsp milk) and it really made the cake!  I did a second batch in 2 medium loaf pans and baked with walnuts on top, and topped with the caramel drizzle - I will probably stick with the loaves in the future!  It didn't have to bake as long and seemed more moist.

This cake was scrumptious!  I chopped up way too many apples, but they didn't go to waste (I added more than the recipe called for).
The outside of the cake was just the right kind of "crispy", but the inside was moist, flavorful and delicious!  I took it to BINGO as one of the desserts they serve (without trying it first -- bold move for me!).  I thought there would be leftovers for me to take home, but I was wrong!  I made another one the next day for the family.  My kids loved it.  Easy to make, and I saw another reviewer said something about mixing the apples into the batter.  Next time I will do this.  I didn't understand the need to "layer" batter, apples, batter, apples, etc. as it didn't look layered when I cut the cake.  So next time, it all gets thrown together.  Highly recommend this recipe.  It's easy and yummy!

I made this cake for my co-workers, they loved it. I added extra spices such as nutmeg, allspice, cloves, pumpkin pie spice. I never measure spices I just add them. This cake was very moist also I didn't measure the apples and this caused the batter to run over the pan. It was still very delicious.

This was great! I used part applesauce and part oil, as well as some wheat flour. I also used 3 apples. I made some caramel frosting since I didn't have ice cream, and it turned out nicely.

We thought this was great! But I made a lot of changes. 1: Only 1 cup of white sugar is PLENTY. 2: Reduce oil to 1/2 cup. 3: I changed the orange juice to soured milk because I don't care for citrus flavour in desserts. I also increased it to 1/2 cup since I reduced the oil. 4: I poured caramel - 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons cream, bring to boil (thank you kfcooke!) over warm cake. 5: I used 3 cups of apples and mixed them through cake batter. 6: I used a 9x13 pan instead of a bundt since so many people said their cakes had burned outsides and runny insides. It baked in 40 minutes and was perfect!

This was a great recipe!  I used somewhere around 4 cups of apples, you could use the 2 cups called for but I wanted to use up the apples I had. Perfect coffee cake, great density, awesome texture with a wonderfully crunchy outside.  Will lighten this up next time with sugar subst. and applesauce for an anytime cake.  Loved it and easy to make!

Wish I had read the reviews before trying this one.  I agree with adding 3 CUPS APPLE TO BATTER.  If you layer the apples and get too many positioned by the inside tube, it's mushy.  Next time I bake it I'll go for half and half ideas others have proposed.  I'm confident simply adding the apples into the batter will make a huge difference and then the cake will rate 5 stars

I changed some of the ingredients and gave some additional thing too. I use 3 apples, peeled and sliced not cubed them. Rub em in with lotsa cinnamon powder & 3 T of Brown sugar. For healthy conscious i cut down the oil intake by replaced half of it with applesauce. It makes the cake more moist and light tough. I replaced OJ with AJ (Apple Juice) too..i think i more suitable than OJ. Last...i sprinkled some almond stick above the batter. And i made Butter Rum icing syrup to be spread on the warm cake....Splendid! Even my mother in law screamed soon after i gave her slices of this apple cake...DELICIOUS!!

Forgot to tell that i only use 1 cup of white sugar..It still taste sweet in my mouth..Also i didn't use bundt pan for this recipe, i use 22cm round pan. And took more than 60 mins to bake. Make sure to check every 20 mins, use bamboo skewer insert in the cake, to see whether the batter are completely done.

I followed the instructions perfectly and it still turned out all crumbly. It was a waste of apples and time. Sorry , but this completely turned me off of any type of apple pound cake. Thanx anyway.

I love this cake and so do all my co-workers!  It is so moist and rich that, in my opinion, doesn't need any icing.  I serve it with a dollop of whip cream and a hot cup of coffee - yum!

I made this yesterday for dessert.  My family loved it!  It was moist and not too sweet.  I mixed the apples in with the rest of the batter and it came out perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good.  The texture is dense for a cake, more like a bread.  But served it at a brunch and everyone enjoyed it.
Thanks!

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it turned out good but not great.  I would definitely take some of the other peoples advice because this just isn't something I'd make again as is.

I made it for one of my co-workers birthday and they thought it was wonderful for breakfast.  It was all gone in two minutes. I added an extra teaspoon of  cinnamon powder and one mashed banana. Simply wonderful.

This cake was really moist and delicious.  I liked it even though it's not overly sweet; the apples and cinnamon add great flavor.  Even at our high altitude, the recipe works perfectly!  Great for a chilly night, but equally tasty for breakfast.  :)

This is one of the best cakes I have ever made.  I did however make one small change.  I did not have any orange juice so I used apple cider.  It is good.  Thank you Carol

Very good cake, although by the time I incorporated the suggestions of other reviewers and added a few changes of my own, I'd have to say the recipe was the BASE.  Substituted 50% brown sugar for the white and 50% applesauce for the oil.  Added extra cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.  Didn't have plain orange juice, so used a mango-peach blend.  Also added extra apples and a ripe banana that I needed to use up.  Used toasted pecans, instead of walnuts.  The cake turned out great!

We had company for a BBQ last night and severe thunder storms drowned our plans so we ended up ordering Chinese Food.  This cake was the hit of the meal, it was enjoyed by all.  I too used 4 cups apples, sprinkled with lots of cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg, and mixed it in with the batter.  I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 fat free sour cream.  What I like about this recipe is that the ingredients are those I would always have in the house and it was so quick and easy to put together I'm sure I wil be making this many, many times.

My teenaged son made this cake as a treat for me.  It's really good; nice and moist.  I loved the little bits of walnuts.  It gives the cake a nice texture along with the apples. Instead of dusting it with icing sugar, he made a little glaze of OJ and icing sugar and poured it on the cake when it was cool. He chose this cake because it contains no butter or milk as I am lactose intolerant.

AWESOME cake!  I would've given it 6 stars if I could.  I did make a few changes, at others' suggestions: I put in 3 c. of apples instead of 2, added about 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and a little extra cinnamon to the apples, and put a caramel glaze on top.  My family loved it, and two of my coworkers said it was "delicious".  One had to call me and tell me how good it was, and that she cheated and ate it before she ate her lunch!

I didn't make this in a bundt pan, but in an 8x8 pan instead and followed the directions with the exception of cutting the recipie in half, and doubling the apple mixture.  I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and cloves to the mixture as well, but that was just a personal thing.  I only did one layer of the apple filling.  My husband said this would have been a 5 if it had a crumb topping, because it was very coffee cake like.  Some people complained of it being bread like, but my husband said it was definatly cakey.

I made this cake twice over the weekend.  Once as a coffee cake, and the next time as a birthday cake for my mom.  Everybody loved it!  I did reduce the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and only used 3 eggs.  It still turned out plenty sweet and super moist!  I mixed everything together and did not add the nuts or top with powdered sugar.  This cake is a fantastic! Thank you for sharing it with us.

Great cake! To make the cake richer I creamed room temp butter instead of oil; also used 4 cups of diced apples(5 large apples). Along with the cinnamon added 1/2 teasp nutmeg. Like others did not layer, just blended the apples in. Makes the house smell great while baking!

Delicious!  Was a huge hit with friends.  I didn't use the walnuts and I used a large rectangular pan.  Because of the larger pan I only did one layer of apples and it baked for 35-40 minutes.

I just made this cake for someone's birthday at work and got rave reviews. As others had suggested, I added 4 cups of apples instead of 2 and baked it for 20-30 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.  I also added more sugar and cinnamon to the apples than the recipe calls for.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

This cake is so delicious. I made a cream cheese icing to top it off with and it tasted great. I would recommend more than 2 apples though.

Excellent. Tips from my experience: Make sure you cut the apples in small pieces. That way the cake will stay together better and the apples will be spread out more. Also I put in almost 3 cups of apples and that still wasn't enough! I added more walnuts as well.

Yummy, but not the "best cake ever."  For those of you who worry about overbaking it, remember: when you use a dark nonstick bundt pan you need to decrease the temp (by 25 degrees) to 325 degrees.  It was perfect for me at this temp for 60 minutes.  I added 1/2 tsp. cloves into apple mixture and 1 tsp. cinnamon into flour mixture (could have actually used another tsp. cinnamon, I think).  I used rum instead of O.J., but think I'd prefer O.J. better.  After chopping apples I had 2-3/4 cups, so used them all and folded apple/spice mixture into batter, rather than layering it.  I used 1/2 c. oil & 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce.  Was very moist.

Just a basic spice cake with chopped apples.  I'm the only one in the house that would eat it.  Kids wouldn't touch it.

We enjoyed this cake very much. My husband is asking for it again this weekend, and he's not a big cake eater. It was moist and delicious, without being too sweet. I didn't chop up the walnuts enough, but it still tasted great. If you use a non-stick bundt pan, watch the cooking time. I overbaked it by a bit, but it was still tasty! The second time I made it I added the zest of one orange, this was excellent. It added a nice citrus tone.

Very good dense cake.  I used an angel food tube pan, cooked it for an additional 15 minutes.  Next time I will just make one layer of apples in the middle.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very good.  Test the cake for doneness ahead of time as I overcooked it by about 5 minutes.  It was still moist and kept that way for days.

This is the best cake ever!  I substituted some apple sauce for the oil and it still turned out great.  The only problem is now my boyfriend wants me to make this every other day!

I think 55-60 minutes for baking was TOO long.  I should have baked itfor about 50 minutes and it would have been perfect.  The inside was still moist and VERY flavorful!

Very good cake!! This is going on our table at Thanksgiving. Would be great toasted with vanilla ice cream on it.  I didn't layer the cake like the recipe said, I just added the apple mix to the batter and folded them in, worked great and had apple bits all through the cake.  I also used apple pie spice in place of the cinnamon, we like ours spicey :)

This was a hit at my card club.  We loved it with a bit of Cool Whip--but it was great plain also.  I have made it again since for a funeral and it was a hit there as well.

I have made this cake a few times now and it is always a huge hit.  I usually make it when I have some extra apples I need to use. The first time I made it with 6 apples, sliced in the food processor. It was wonderful! I also use coconut oil because it is so good for you! It does take longer to bake in my oven but the result is worth waiting for. (possibly because of adding more apples.)

Nice cake.  I replaced the apples with canned peaches and the liquid from the peaches replaced the orange juice.

Delish! I will make this one again. What I did as per reviews: I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of 1/2 cup of the white sugar. I had an orange on hand so I squeezed it for the 1/4 cup of orange juice mentioned in recipe. I did add an extra cup of diced apples. Lastly I drizzled it with a confectionery sugar mixed with a tad of water and some vanilla.

Absolutely perfect! I did tweak it a bit, based on a couple of suggestions found here -- used only one cup of white sugar and for the other cup used brown; added more apples (I used three large ones); and rather than layer them mixed them throughout the batter. Can't wait to make it again next week!

A lovely and easy one to make! Though I would suggest halving the sugar and oil... It was too sweet for my taste, and it tasted faintly of uncooked oil... It was delicious in general and and apples were awesome, though there were too few of it. Would definitely double the apples next time!

Very dissapointing... I made this last night, following the recipe exactly, it came out flavorless, maybe it's the apples, I have had 3 golden delicious apples put in it. 
The cake itself very sweet and thats all, no flavor.
Thanks for the recipe, even though I won't make this again.

This recipe is fantastic!  I was a little nervous when the cake came out a little dark on the edges, but it wasn't burned at all just a wonderful caramelized crust that kept the rest of the cake moist on the inside and a nice caramel crust on the outside.  I served it at a meeting and everyone loved it.  Definitely will make this every fall when we go apple picking from now on.

I used the helpful hints from reviewers, added 1 more cup of chopped apples along with cinnamon.  I also sugared my bundt pan after spraying, this was a great suggestion. My needed to cook the full time, but turned out very good.  Thanks

I baked this last nite because I had some apples lying around that no one was eating. I wanted a quick, no-thrills dessert. Unfortunately, that's exactly what this is. I know bundt cakes are notoriously bland, but this really hits ten on the bland scale. I think the oil was too much and ultimately destroyed this bundt. I even cut it down by 25%! But I think others were smarter to replace half w/ applesauce. Definitely do this! And, even though my icing is great and I made tons to pour over this, it still needs something more complex. The reviewer suggesting a caramel sauce sounded closer to what this will need to make it a success.

I used 3 cups of Granny Smith apples, 1.5 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1 tsp, and I used only 1 cup of brown sugar in place of the 2 cups of white, which was plenty sweet for me.  I folded the apples and nuts in with the batter rather than layering them. I drizzled the cake with the caramel sauce recommended by another reviewer (1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 teaspoons milk, heated to a boil for 2 minutes).  Delicious!

I baked for 50 min and it was too long.  i would start checking after 40 min.  it is too dry after baking 50 min.   I followed a reviewer's advice and used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was still too sweet...   Other people seemed to like it, but I would use even less sugar.

This recipe was great! I followed the advice of some of the others on here and just mixed in the apples. My husband doesn't like nuts, so I omitted the walnuts and added more apples. It was very easy to make-moist and tasty!!

This was tasty, though I thought the texture was a little dense. Next time I might try separating the eggs and beating up the whites to fold in.  I substituted Applejack brandy for the OJ, and pecans for the walnuts, and cut back on the sugar just a tad.

I have been making this cake for years now.  I have modified it a little though.  I use two types of apples - granny smith and honey crisp when I can find them.  But any two will do - it just gives it more of an apple taste.  I also use a tad bit more OJ and vanilla.  Once the top begins to get brown, I normally put foil on top so it doesn't burn and become hard.    I have had such success with this cake that I have been asked to bake and give as gifts and people at work have offered to pay me for my services!

Great recipe!!  I made it with my 3 kids, and we all love the result, is moist and tasty, the only thing I change was with the apple mixture, I added some lime juice and put brown sugar instead of the white that the recipe calls for. I absolutly recommend this one!! cheers!

This was amazing!  Of course i tweaked the recipe a little bit (i always do)  I picked apples from the tree in my yard.  I used a bit more cinnamon.  I used one cup white sugar and 1/2 to 3/4 cup brown sugar( instead of two cups white sugar)  I omitted the walnuts (only because i forgot them)  and instead of layering, i mixed the apples and the batter together. i was worried how it would come out because it had a weird cookie dough consistency but it was great I loved it. my husband and daughter loved it too.  My house smells awesome right now and i loved that i could make this with just things i had around the house (and in my tree)  Great recipe. will make again for thanksgiving.

Sorry to say this cake is terrible. I've had it before and it was delicious, so I'm not sure what went wrong. I added the 2 cups apples as suggested and cut down on the sugar by 1/2 cup, and regret that I did that. However it was definitely overbaked at about 50 minutes. I did omit the nuts, too, so maybe that was the problem. It was dry, tasteless, and a bit oily. Thanks for posting.

I was concerned that 2 cups of sugar would make the batter too sweet, but it's not. I made the recipe as is, and my cake turned out great. I think that I may experiment with less oil next time to try and make it a bit healthier. Maybe 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce. Thanks for sharing.

Good cake. I used about 3 cups of apples and 1/2 AP flour and 1/2 Whole Wheat, 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Will make this one again. Also used a butter rum glaze but think I will leave it off next time.

I baked this cake for a Christmas party at work (but left out the nuts), and nearly everyone had two or three slices. I just barely snagged a slice to take home to my husband. Even my supervisor, who hates cake, had three slices!  It really blew everyone away.

This is my all time favorite cake...especially for the fall season.  I bake it with whole wheat flour and it's incredible. I've also tried replacing half the oil with applesauce to cut some of the fat. That worked well too!

Mine did not turn out as moist as I would have liked it. But, that is not the recipe to blame. My family and our weekend visitor loved it. It went well with coffee. I will try not to overbake next time!

This was good - although next time I think I'll take other reviews advice and fold the apples into the batter.  I didn't like the way it look with the apples in layers.  I used 1 cup splenda, 2/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 applesauce/1/2 oil.  I'll definitely make it again!

Loved this cake. I made it for a brunch recently and everyone thought it tasted great.  I think though that next time I'll cut back on the sugar and oil and substitute with the applesauce.  I didn't have any on hand this time.

My DH loved it! The only difference I made was to use brown sugar to coat the apples and half white half brown sugar in the batter. I also poured half the batter before adding the apples, and then the other half (instead of thirds). Thanks!

I used all the suggestions outlined in prior reviews (mashed banana, more spices, applesauce in lieu of some of the oil, mix apples into batter and not layer, extra baking powder, 1/2 brown sugar/1/2 white sugar ), I also made a glaze for the cake. It was good if you like a "bread pudding" consistency)

Made this for a faculty luncheon and it was great.  The key is that the apples are not mixed in with the batter which helps the bread portion to have a good consistency, yet has tasty layers of apples.  Tastes much like homemade apple pie!

I'm changing my review from a 2 to a 4. After letting this cake sit, it became moist and the flavor was more enjoyable. Although I thought this cake was ok, my family loved it. They didn't think it was the best cake I made, but would like it again. Revised review
1st review- I didn't like this recipe. The cake had NO flavor. I used applesauce as others suggested. Added raisins, even made caramel glaze to go on top but it didn't make the cake more enjoyable.

This recipe was amazing!  I doubled the apples, added extra cinnamon and 2 t. pumpkin pie spiece.  Instead of oil I used fat free vanilla yogurt and the cake was dense and moist - perfect!  I did add the caramel glaze but the first night it was sticky and just peeled off.  The next day the cake was better and the caramel flavor blended more.  I am such a fan:-)

We made this recipe exactly to the directions, omitting only the walnuts.  For some reason it just didn't turn out well at all; the cake was really wet and floury, and the flavor was off.  Perhaps the apples had too much moisture.  I don't think I'll try this one again.

This cake isn't bad at all, but it's nothing special either.  I found it to be very moist, but rather bland and I’m looking for something with a bit more complex flavor.  I subbed applesauce for the oil and added more apples as others had suggested.  It came out of the pan and looked beautiful; just like the picture.    The texture was also a little bit denser than I was looking for, but may be just what others want.  If I were going to attempt this recipe again, I’d cut the apples smaller, reduce the eggs by at least one (I thought it was a little too eggy), and add some more spices.

delicious cake, it's a great way to start off fall! I followed suggestions listed, added total 4 cups apples and 1 cup of oil like the recipie calls for worked great. I baked mine in a 9x13 pan and frosted with Caramel Frosting V, was a huge hit with everyone!

Good cake!  I did use half applesause and half oil, also added 2 extra teas. of cinnamon to the batter. It stays very moist for days, since it is only my husband and I here, I always make things, share them with friends, and we still have plenty of dessert for a few days.  It is a keeper.

Made this for a meeting at work and it was a huge hit.  Used 4 cups of apples, 2 tbs of sugar and 2 tsp if cinnamon.  Used 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce. 1 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Was out of OJ so use apple juice.  The most moist cake ever.  Baked for 57 minutes.  Cooled over night then release from the pan.  Great way to use up lots of apples.

I just tried the cake and I think it tastes great!! I think next time I will try adding 2 cups more apples as suggested in the other reviews, but otherwise it's fantastic. I substituted 1/2 cup coconut and 1/2 cup chopped almonds for the walnuts because I was out of them, and it added a great flavor:)

Outstanding!  I made a few changes:  4 granny smith apples, 3 TBSP. sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon and 2 tsp. baking powder.  It needed to bake for about an hour and 15 minutes.  So moist!  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful apple cake. I slightly modified the ingredient by increasing the diced apple to 2C with 1tbsp more of the sugar. I also added 2tsp more cinnamon  2tsp of nutmeg.  I also increased the orange juice to 13C. Instead of walnut, I used almond (toasted  coarsely grounded).  All my family  colleagues like the cake! Thanks for the recipe.  I will make it again and again!

I've made this recipe 20 times, literally for a church function. I add 4 C of apple to the batter mix. Use 1/2 C sour cream and a squeeze of orange and 1/2 C oil. Cook for 65 min. And glaze with the caramel icing as suggested. The reason it gets a 4 is because I didn't use the exact recipe. Thanks though it was a great jumping off point.

55 minutes was the perfect time for me.  Came out incredibly delicious.  I cut up two gala apples, leaving the skin on (adds a little fiber I find).  I wouldn't change a thing.  Topped with a caramel glaze, it was amazing

So good! And this time I traded half the white flour for whole wheat and because I was out of OJ I used pineapple juice.  I even had some for breakfast... I will use this one again and again!

This recipe is a keeper although I modified it a little

1 1/2 cup sugar instead of 2
1/2 cup melted butter instead of 1 cup veggie oil
replace orange juice with cointreau 
Less cinnamon
I mixed the apples into the batter and it tastes the same and is much easier to pour!

I was dissapointed with this cake. A bit eggy and not as flavorful as I thought it would be. I also wished I had stirred the apples into the batter rather than layering them in. Won't be making this cake again.

This was a wonderful bundt cake! I made some alterations, though: I added 3 cups of apples, and didn't have any orange juice, so added apple juice instead and it was really good. I loved that the apples were very moist and tender.

This is a great cake.  So easy to make although I would suggest baking it at 350 for 1.5 hour as opposed to 1 hour.  My cake was not done and still wet inside at the one hour point.  It could be my electric oven, but I have baked other cakes at this temperature and the times always worked out.  Will definately be making this one again.

An excellent recipe that produces super moist cake.  I used 3/4 cup of oil and used Amaretto instead orange juice, the cake still came out great.  I was concerned that the batter was kind of thick, but it wasn't a problem at all.

the cake tasted great but i had to leave it in the oven for 20 minutes longer than called for. But the result was yummy. it was still really moist inside and tasted similiar to a bread pudding.

I made this for a scrapbook party, and everyone loved it - I served it with cool whip, but I think it would be better with vanilla ice cream.

Wonderful, moist cake!   I will definitely make this again during the holidays!  My Sunday school class raved about it, and even a co-worker who says she "hates" apples loved this cake.  My kids would eat it prepared without the nuts.

This cake was very tasty and really moist. I would make it again. Would be a great cake for a brunch. Only problem...mine stuck in the pan. Maybe I didn't grease the pan well enough. Will find out next time.

Wow easy to make and it was a hit with the family. I substituted 1/2 c of granulated sugar for light brown. I didn’t have walnuts so I used pecans. Next time I think I might use more apples. Loved finding them!

I made this vegan, by substituting aquafaba for eggs. Like other reviewers,  I also substituted applesauce for half the oil , used 3 apples educed the sugar to 1 1/4 C of mostly brown sugar, and added 1/4 t cloves.  I'm not sure how long I baked it for, but over one hour @ 350.

This is fabulous!  Added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter and a dash of nutmeg.  Doubled cubed apples to 4 cups, and mixed into the batter, rather than layering.  Perfection!

update 9-19-19.
made this again, and followed the advice of there  reader that said to mix the apples into the batter- and to add a extra cup of apple.
what a mess, stick to the recipe! I I wish I had.
I still give it 5 stars, it was great when I made it as directed.

October 2018
Awesome... the texture is 
great, and you can really taste the Apples- loved it!

Absolutely love this cake especially after it sat for a night! I used less sugar and more apples. In addition to the orange juice I used orange peel- delicious! For some reason this cake reminds me of my grandma! Thank you for sharing

Made it again and it definitely will be my go to bundt cake ??

This was SO delicious! I omitted the nuts, simply because we didn't have any, and added more apples. I haven't mastered the greasing of pans, and always have sticking issues, in this case it meant the two sections around the apples came out separately, but they layered back up and looked great with confectioner's sugar. I made a second cake in a loaf pan and froze it for later, too! I will be making this again and again, everyone loved it. I think the orange juice makes the cake. Sorry I didn't take any pictures!

I love this cake and love giving it to others.  It's Gravenstein apple season in Sebastopol, CA and I'm fortunate to have a friend with an orchard.  I have made 3 of these bundt cakes this week and friends and family are loving them.  I ran out of walnuts and it was great without them.  Thank you  for the recipe.

Very nice recipe!  I made it last night,but should have taken it out 2 or 3 minutes earlier. 52 min in my oven would have been fine,since it will finish off those few minutes in the pan cooling.  I'm my own worst critic,but family raved!  I very stupidly forgot to layer in the apples, so I just mixed them into the pan.
I cut back on sugar by 1/4 c and added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the batter. 
Baking again right now for the neighbor. Went with 1c white sugar and 2/3 c dark brown sugar.  Again, went with nutmeg and cinnamon. 

Instead of finishing with  powdered sugar,I made a drizzle using  chai instead of milk. Didnt seem to add anything to flavor to me, but  "chai drizzle" seemed to excite everyone!?

I made this cake as a birthday dessert and an alternative to pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. It was... okay. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and increased the apples to 3 cups instead of 2, and am glad I did that. The flavor was good, but it wasn't extraordinary. If I make it again, I will replace a little oil with applesauce to make it a little healthier.

I made the exact recipe but put glaze on top instead of powdered sugar. Very dense cake but moist and delicious. I will certainly make it again.

This was a fun recipe. I especially enjoyed the layering and I love when you slice the cake and see the color of fall. I picked the apples from Warwick NY and this recipe caught my eye. It's a moist cake and the apples really makes the cake!  One of my favorite Bundt cake to make.

I used transparent apples freshly picked off the tree that were juicy, tart and cooked quickly. I increased the amount of apples to 4 cups and increased the baking time. Outstanding!

A total of 90 minutes and it's done. The prep takes 20 to 30 mins & the bake time is about an hour. I watched a couple of episodes of my favorite show, and the cake was done. Awesome!

Really great turn out!! Moist yet dense and very tasty with healthier substitutions: 2/3 cups apple sauce & 1/3 organic virgin coconut oil. 3 cups of Apple, only handful of chopped walnuts, swapped orange juice for half Cointreau & half dark rum & lastly, only used half cup of white sugar in batter given the apple sauce, apples and frosting sugar, it's totally sweet enough for our palette. Baking required only 50 minutes. Would most definitely make this again.

I used 1/4 c rum instead of orange juice, and 1 c  brown sugar and 1 c white sugar. I did not layer the apples, I mixed them in. I also used Self rising flour. Left out the baking powder.  It baked for 70 min in a bundt pan. It was terrific!


1/31/16. Made this again. Used 1/2 cup oil. 3 eggs. 3 cups of apples. 1/4 cup rum and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup stevia. Baked 350 for 50 minutes, dusted with powdered sugar.  This was my favorite so far!

This was an awesome cake. It was moist, had a perfect texture and was so tasty.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. I didn't  have walnuts and I  accidentally put 1 tsp of salt in instead of a 1/2 tsp but it didnt hurt the outcome at all. I will make this again.

I made the recipe according to the directions.  I think I may try to back off on the sugar a bit.  I found to be a bit sweet.

I will be making this again, and have already shared this recipe with my neighbor!

Delicious flavor. The batter is VERY thick, difficult to spread in layers like the recipe asks. When I made it, the cake was moist and underdone around the thickest layer of apples, so next time I'll probably mix the apples with the batter evenly so it doesn't happen again. I can't wait to get this recipe perfect.

I came back to see if I had somehow messed up the amount of baking powder.  This cake bubbled down the sides of the pan and all over the bottom of my oven.  It is so crusted at the top I'm not sure if I'll be able to get it out.  I didn't see anyone else with the problem so I'm still puzzled.  I'll alter this if I make it again without this issue.

Awesome cake, I made it with my son who is 6 and wanted to make an apple cake. It was really easy, I'm not sure how anyone could mess it up unless they altered the recipe. I didn't give 5 stars because I did find it a little dry on the edges, but I'm sure a wet cloth wrapped around the cake pan would help solve that. I also found the top browned too fast and needed tin foil on top half way through.

No need to make this in layers at all, just mix in the apples right before you put it in the pan.  I used 4 cups of diced apples and upped the cinnamon/sugar ratio a bit. Because I used so many apples I did have to bake it for about 70 minutes but I used the tooth pick method after about 55 minutes and just tested every 5 minutes after that.  Unbelievably moist and so, so good.  It probably also helped that I warmed up some caramel sauce and lightly drizzled it on top of individual servings.  Decadent but AMAZING!!!!

Delicious recipe. I followed recommendations made by others - used 2 apples (which is a little more than 2 cups), used brown sugar in the apple cinnamon mix instead of white, added 1 tsp. baking soda, used 1 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar as suggested many times, used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup sour cream, omitted nuts. I mixed the apples into the dough instead of layering them...which I think makes the cake A LOT better (avoids soggy cake w/ apple layering). Finally, I greased the bundt pan with margarine and sprinkled sugar on top of the margarine before transferring dough into pan - great suggestion! The cake did not over-bake, I baked for 48 mins. exactly. (do not over bake)

I vegan-ized this recipe by replacing the eggs with 1 cup applesauce!  Mmmm.... I loved it.  I had a slice for dessert and I'll be having a slice with coffee tomorrow morning.  It's a really good recipe -  easy to manipulate and customize.

Wow, this cake came out so so so good!!! I love it! Love the texture /taste /and look! Perfect lil cake,great for this season indeed. I left the nuts out tho, didn't had any, but i will add them next time when i bake it again. I wonder how this cake would be when we use butter instead of oil? I like the buttertaste better, but either way, this cake taste good (even with teh added oil) Nice one!

I put in 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil as suggested by others.  Turned out perfect.  Can't say it needed the apple sauce though.  This is my boyfriend's favorite now.  Slight cripsyness on the outside and very moist on the inside.

It was really sweet and dense cake, not much flavorful, apples didn't make much difference in it, I used honey crisp in it and expected bit of a tart flavor, but there was none. If I made it next time, I'd probably cut to 1 cup of sugar and used 3 cups of granny smith, but I'm not sure if I want to experiment with this again.

I loved this cake, the rich flavor complements the apples beautifully. the one thing I suggest is to add more cinnamon and half the recipe, it's really to much.

I make this recipe 1-3 times around the holidays.  I have made this recipe for the last 9 years (2007).  I have made with nuts and no nuts.  I have made mixing in apples and not.  Always turns out great.  I do prefer nuts and mixing in the apples the best.

It i perfect, I made it for my decorative painting class last friday and I was a little anxious because of trying a new recipe but it turned out so well...I made another one today and it's almost entirely eaten...While pouring the batter into the pan I strongly recommend a sillicon spatula because the batter is really really thick...

Didn't like it. Both of us said "Nope" in unision. Maybe, if you use applesauce instead of oil and put a brown sugar mix on the top.
Okay, my first rating was a 1, but with the carmel sauce mixed with pecans the next day, I took it to work and several people stopped by to tell me how great it was. I didn't even get to re-taste it. I would still at least replace 1/2 cup apple sauce for the oil or used pie filling next time. Thanks for the recipe and Thanks for the suggestions for the carmel sauce!

Pretty good cake ! I modified spices and added a little extra chopped apple. As it was made in a standard type cake pan without hole in the middle - it did take a long time to cook.  This was even better the next day as the apples had released more moisture into the cake after it sat overnight

Served warm with vanilla ice cream, this Apple Bundt Cake was a huge hit at our Sunday family dinner!   I had all the ingredients on hand so I didn't have to shop for, or substitute, a thing.  I used 1 1/3 Granny Smith apples to gain two cups of diced apples.  Next time I will use three cups of apples as others have suggested.  Enjoy!

I used a nonstick bundt pan, checked on the cake at about 40 minutes and it was already burned.  Had to cover with foil until the center finished baking.  I trimmed the burned bits and nobody noticed.  People seemed to like it, and it was pretty good considering how charred it was after only 40 minutes.  Next time I'll either have to use a different pan or watch the cake like a hawk.

A great dairy-free dessert...I combined several other reviewers' suggestions and used 1 cup white sugar, half cup of brown sugar in the cake and increased the apples to three cups.  I mixed two cups of the apples into the cake and used the third cup as a middle layer.  I had company over for dinner and they loved it!

A wonderful recipe that's worth every minute you spend making it! I added an extra cup of apples to the recipe and replaced the oil with no-sugar-added applesauce and greased/floured my pan with the powdered sugar for a crispy crust. I also stirred the apples in with the batter as opposed to layering them. With these changes, this cake, sliced into 36 slices (for breakfast accompaniments/minor dessert), this cake is only 105 calories per slice! Yum!

This is a great cake. I had requests for another before the first got cold!   Due to my own food sensitivities, I made a couple of adjustments. I replaced the oil with applesauce and used egg replacement instead of eggs. Still came out delish!  I used a cameo apple and a braeburn.

This is a great recipe.  Used a home make apple pie filling instead of fresh apples and omitted the oil.  Was wonderful.  Had to bake a little longer- about 10 minutes.

Awesome.  I mixed the apples into the cake batter because I am lazy and it turned out perfect.  I did use some of the other suggestions and added 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar.  A very moist cake.

I have made this cake countless times. It is a HUGE hit. Sometimes I've added more apples but this is a huge mistake because the cake won't bake well! The cake is delicious with either white or whole wheat flour. A definite keeper. Makes for a great breakfast with tea or coffee!

This cake was so easy and delicious.  It came out moist and tender.  

Changes: I cut the sugar down to 1 cup of white and 1/2 brown...this may be too bland for some tastes.

This is exactly what I was looking for as a nice holiday dessert. This cake is unbelievably moist - I made it a week in advance, wrapped it in plastic and kept in my garage and it was still tender and fresh tasting when we cut into it. No changes or substitutions needed! Just serve with a dollop of whipped cream and you've got a wonderful treat.

I made a few changes in this recipe but I used it as a base.  I used a mixture of brown sugar and granulated sugar. I added plump golden raisins. And I just mixed the apples into the batter instead of layering it.  Oh yeah, and I added a pinch of allspice.  I did not have a bundt pan so I used my muffins tins and these made wonderful breakfast muffins.  They did not rise hardly at all so I filled the tins up to the very top.  Very dense and moist and flavorful.

this is delicious!! i suggest adding more apples, perhaps 3 cups, because what looked like a lot (the 2 cups) really spread out over the entire cake. fabulous recipe, though.

This is excellent, it will be added to my very best recipes. Only sad thing was the calories involved, no wonder it was so good. (smile)

This cake is absolutely wonderful.  I used 2 Pink Lady apples and it turned out great. I would not change a thing about this.  My whole family was impressed and it is not a box recipe.  I definitely recommend trying!  Yummy!

This was the best apple cake I've ever made! I used 3 cups of finely diced, peeled Granny Smith apples and increased the 1 tablespoon of sugar to 3 tablespoons (as Granny Smith apples are tart).  Instead of 1 cup of oil, I used 3/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup drained applesauce.

I have gotten more compliments on this cake than on anything I've ever made---this is the most delicious cake! I made it the original way and it was fabulous.  I then tried it with 1/3c applesauce and 2/3c oil and the cake was a bit dry the first day, but by day 2 was just as delicious as the original.  Definitely try it!

This was the first time I made this cake and it was good. I usually do not change anything the first time I make something off this site but I did. I added extra apples and glad I did - the apples tasted great but the cake part was dry. I will bake at 325 as posted by another next time

I personally liked this cake, but no one else did, "was like eating bread with little flavor", used 4 apples, extra cinnamon, and baking for 55 mins mine came out a tad dark...overall would not make again.

Sugar-Free Cake

I made this cake without any sugar by fluke and it tasted great.(I thought I had put sugar in the bowl and I remembered after the cake was baked that i didn't put it) (So that explains why my batter was sticky)My son is a diabetic and he thought that his was cake heavan.
Here is what I did. I put 4 cups of apple, 1 table spoon of orange peel 1/4 cup of milk ( you may need to add just a little more)your batter will be very sticky, but thats okay, put the  batter 1st than apples. Bake for 65 minutes. You can't even tell that the sugar is missing.
Everyone loved the cake.

Yum!  I had a lot of apples to use up and went ahead and put in nearly FOUR cups of apples.  I'll never make it with any less!  Makes good muffins for packing in kids lunches too.

The cake was very easy to make since I dediced to mix the apples into the batter.  I had omitted the walnuts since I didn't have any on hand.  I took the suggestions of using 1 cup white sugar and ½ cup brown sugar and it made the cake taste fine.  I would recommend serving it with a caramel sauce for a little more sweetness.

This was pretty good - moist and tasty though not blow-your-socks-off great dessert. It's a good recipe for fall when you are looking for new apple recipes.

I made this a while ago for my in-laws: they enjoyed so much that these two were done with it within a few days. My "Mami" requested the recipe to make again for herself. It was INDEED a great way to use up a bunch of ripened apples before they went bad.

EXCELLENT cake!  Delicious with butter pecan ice cream on the side, too.  I just wish it weren't so unhealthy--will try others' suggestions for reducing the oil & sugar next time.

Delicious cake! The first time I tried this recipe, my family voted out the nuts, so I tried
it again, used fresh oj, more apples and cinnamon in the batter. Laughed when a bunch of 10 yr old boys deliriously enjoyed it after school here, they were so happy!  Thanks for sharing!

Wow!Keep this one, everybody!It smells heavenly while baking. After the cake cooled, I turned it out so that the "crust" was on top, not the "fluted" side. I may try drizzling a sugar coating next time. Served it to some non-dessert people and they loved it. Especially nice in Autumn. Thanks, Carol AAAAA+++++

This cake was excellent.  I have made it twice now.  The inside of the cake is moist, while the crust is tender and crisp--not too hard and not mushy.
