This recipe must have an error, it did NOT work. I spent a ton of time making sure to follow it very carefully and all I got was a soupy mess! Please correct it before anyone else wastes their time and money!

It took about an hour and a half and I had the same result. A thick fluid, nothing that could be cut and eaten.

Freezing it helped, it is tasty, but it did not work for me as written.

I don't know why this got such bad reviews. My whole family loved it, it was super easy and made with ingredients I had on hand. I will make this pie again for sure! Thanks for the recipe. Worked great for me!
