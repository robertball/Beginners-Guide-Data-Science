This was so good and easy.  We served it with tortilla chips warmed in the oven and used HOT salsa.  We've made it twice.  
Once using Neufchatel cheese the and spread it over wedges of "Laughing Cow Light" the second time.  Both were equally good. This will be our signature appetizer when entertaining!

I am sorry it has taken me so long to review this recipe considering how many times I have made this!   We love this dip! I can't handle things too spicy but even I use a "medium" salsa (hard to find picante here) b/c the cream cheese chills it out so much.   This sweet hot flavor is just wonderful and it is so pretty!   I love the idea the previous poster had about using peach preserves...that would be great for Halloween and Thanksgiving! I will have to try that too!

This spread was delicious!  I served it as an appetizer for a dinner party I had and everyone devoured it.  It has a nice sweet and tangy taste.  I did not change a thing and I will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so easy and beautiful!  I didn't have raspberry preserves, but I did have peach preserves.  It was super yummy and a bit hit at out holiday potluck!  It has just the right mix of hot and sweet.

The taste combination was pretty good, but when I followed the amounts in the recipe, the sauce seemed to overwhelm the cream cheese.  I ended up spreading the cream cheese out on my dish and covering with 2/3 the sauce. My house is cold, so the cream cheese didn't stay soft, and the chips kept breaking as people tried to dip. I will fool around with this recipe again.

I followed this recipe to a "t". WE LOVED IT!!! One of them "I cant stop eating recipes". I am not one of the people to add or change a recipe, i just dont see what the point is. If you want to change or add to a recipe, then what is the point to it? Again thanks

The quantities are off. Too much picante. Messy-looking. Wonâ€™t make it again.
