I was too lazy to make the meatsauce so iI used pre -made sauce and a can of tomatoes with bground beef. It was very good and not as bothersome to make as I thought it would be.

This was very good.  I made half recipe.  I used fresh tomatoes from our garden and made my own sauce.  I will make this again using Ricotto instead of Cottage Cheese or maybe half of each.  Also will try using Italian Sausage instead of ground beef to make it more Italian.

I was searching for a simple manicotti with cottage cheese and I found this. My family loved it, and they usually hate cottage cheese. Definitely going to use this in the future.

I just tried this recipe .I have to admit I did what I usually critisize others for doing,I changed the recipe  some, from the beginning.I like to use ricotta in these type of recipes and don't usually use cottage cheese.My boyfriend and I really liked it and thought it was very tastey.I used 2 oz more of the ricotta because it was cheaper to use a big container then 2 small ones and they only had 32 oz ones.I liked the meat sauce but it just seemed too thick from the beginning and I felt that using all that tomato paste it was going to get thicker.I aded some water(maybe 1/2 can) and rinsed out tomato paste can.After cooking the sauce for just a little while,following the recipe, it started to stick and was pretty thick.I ended up adding more water then and before I added it on top of the manicotti.It worked good that way.Next time I might add  a small can of diced tomatoes to get more liquid with taste(not just water although that worked fine)to it.My boyfriend usually doesn't like meat sauce on cheese manicotti,he likes a a meatless meal sometimes, but there was no complaints and a lot eaten.I used garlic powder instead of the salt.I like to control my salt and my garlic so I have never been fond of using garlic salt.I had never made roasted garlic before,I was not sure I could do it right.It was very easy and delicious.We used the leftover garlic on bread with butter.Delicious and it seemed to work very well in the sauce.Thank you for this recipe.
