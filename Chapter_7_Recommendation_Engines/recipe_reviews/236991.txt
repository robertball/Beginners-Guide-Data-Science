I followed this recipe exactly, and I was curious because I have made other rhubarb crisp recipes before that add flour to the rhubarb to thicken it. This recipe did not add flour, and the results were awful. It is rhubarb soup with soggy oatmeal on top. We each ate a scoop over ice cream. Adding a few tablespoons of flour to the rhubarb will allow it to thicken, creating more of a "crisp" dessert.

My neighbor mentions she has this massive rhubarb plant, and I casually mention that I like rhubarb desserts.  Next thing I know, she has hacked down the entire plant and has brought about 30 lbs of rhubarb to my doorstep.  Needless to say, I started searching for recipes.  I stumbled upon this one, which seemed perfect for the dinner party for 4 we were having.  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe called for, even though I struggled in my mind with "Is one cup of halved strawberries REALLY enough?"  This recipe is flat-out DELICIOUS!  Tangy with the perfect amount of sweetness.  Lemony zesty without lemony overkill.  The four of us completely demolished the 9x9 pan I baked it in.  Thank goodness I still have about 25 lbs of rhubarb left from the neighbor!  I will definitely make this again...as in probably today!

Addendum:  I have found this to be a solid crisp recipe, even if you don't have enough to rhubarb.  I find as long as you use 5-6 cups of various fruits ( rhubarb, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, apples, etc) the rest of the recipe remains exactly the same.  And totally delicious!

Love this!  Easy to make!  I put a few more strawberries and less rhubarb than it called for.

This is just what I was looking for! The only slight changes I made was orange zest and juice instead of lemon and I cubed instead of diced the rhubarb. This one is going in the archives. Thank you!

I chopped the rhubarb instead of dicing, and subbed blueberries for strawberries. Also cut down just a teeny bit on the white sugar because I try to omit what I can. Perfect outcome- I was so happy with it. My grandmother had always made lovely rhubarb desserts and thus my first time attempting to work with rhubarb had some high expectations. This recipe was a perfect base. I'm sure it's delicious with strawberries, too... and if I use them in the future, I bet the white sugar could go down to about 1/4c. without missing it.

I have made this 3 times this year and it is delicious!
The second time I made it, it was a little runny, so I did add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the rhubarb mixture. I also added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the oatmeal topping for extra crunch - topped with vanilla ice cream - YUMMY!
I think I need to plant more rhubarb!

This was so very good.  I always trust Chef John's recipes and have never been disappointed.  As a child we ate a lot of rhubarb as we had a patch in our yard.  I have tried to grow it but with no luck here in Los Angeles area.  So I must buy it in the market and it is a special treat for us.  This recipe was easy to make and so rewarding.  I think next time I will increase the amount of filling using 5 or 6 stalks instead of three.  I used AP flour and it was fine.  I wanted to take a picture, but it was gone before I had a chance to.

Chef John has perfected another recipe!  I always look for his, but also always read several reviews to tweak. The only thing different I did was add 1 TBS cornstarch to fruit to thicken. Yummy!!!!

My family loves strawberry rhubarb pie, but I am not good at making pie crusts.  So this was a good compromise; they are also fans of oatmeal topping, which make this perfect.

I did add a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the liquid; fresh strawberries and rhubarb are too juicy otherwise, even though the flour from the topping does settle down in and help thicken the juices a bit.  

The flavor was very nice, a humble oaty sweet topping with the sweet-tart fruit underneath.  The lemon zest gave a nice zing that set this apart; I bet you could skip the lemon and also cut the sugar a bit, which I might be tempted to do anyway.  This is a simple, tasty dessert and a hit with the family.

Why is it so runny? There is no thickener in the fruit that's why. Needs cornstarch or flour to thicken. I have a delicious crisp topping on a pan of juice. Ice cream topping I guess.

Terrific recipe. Perfect balance of sweetness and tartness. I used orange zest and OJ instead of lemon and white whole wheat flour. Thank you for a super simple great tasting recipe!

This was perfect! Not too sweet or too tart.  I had 4 cups of frozen rhubarb from last season that I wanted to use up.  I followed the recipe exactly except for one substitution; I didn't have strawberries so used frozen wild blueberries (which had been suggested by one reader) and it was heavenly.  I was worried that it would be too runny because of the frozen fruit and several reviews but it was not.  I also added some chopped pecans to the topping.  My husband is a big rhubarb fan who generally prefers it in pies but he loved this cobbler.  I will be making again next season. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I know nothing about rhubarb, but it grows every year in our garden. Someone told me how easy it is to cook, so I cut the stalks, and made this recipe and it was so good! First time ever cooking with fresh rhubarb and I will use this recipe again. I just substituted butter for coconut oil and makes this a pretty healthy dessert.

This was great! I left out the lemon and oats since I didn't have either, and I increased the amount of strawberries. As suggested, I also added 1 T cornstarch to the fruit. Will definitely be making this again.

Easy to make.  however, I would cut the amount of lemon juice down at least by half, found it very acidic.  It was very good nevertheless.

I made this using rhubarb I froze from our garden.  Because of other reviewers concerns about the dish being too runny, I made sure to pour off about half of the juices from my defrosted rhubarb. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 13x9 inch dish.  I used Old Fashioned oats for the rolled oats (Old Fashioned oats are rolled oats, but are not rolled as thin as quick oats.), and whole wheat flour.   I cooked the dish longer than called for to try to get the topping to crisp, but it never really did crisp the way I hoped for.  Nevertheless, still a good recipe.  We love strawberry rhubarb pie, and this is a quicker way to get that flavor.

I had never made rhubarb, and this was a hit! I will say this--for the past year or so, I've made many, many Chef John recipes though, and he has yet to make a recipe I didn't truly like. But regardless, a tasty, different sort of dessert. The strawberries add a nice softer element to the flavor. The biggest challenge was finding rhubarb at my local markets! Would definitely recommend this recipe.

I doubled this recipe. One pan is never enough. I did add tapioca to the fruit. I also add 4T more butter to the topping.

This recipe comes out perfect every time!

You know it’s good when it’s all gone!! This was a hit with my family. I made only half the recipe because usually I mess something up, but not this time! ‘Got any more?’ ‘Is there none left?’ So good!!! I added more butter than the recipe called for so added just a bit more oats & flour to accommodate. Really easy to make & I will definitely make it again. Family can’t wait! Perfect summer dessert!

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe as written. Did not add ice cream. It was a great combination of tart and sweet and of course the topping was super tasty. I use vegan butter due to lactose intolerance and it was great!

Reminds me of my Grandma's recipe. Yummy! I added another cup of strawberries as I had some to use up. Doubled the crisp recipe which I always do at the request of my family with fruit crisps. Gonna make more soon. All this rain is giving me a bumper crop of rhubarb!

I made this for the first time today and thought it was very good. I only changed the flour to white since I was out of whole wheat. 
I will definitely make this again.

Come on you whiney bakers. Add some tapioca or tapioca starch/flour to thicken.  It’s not rocket science.  

Chef John, you should know better.  This has a juicy base and needs thickening. 

Research why tapioca works best for watery fillings. Learn something besides what mama taught you.

I changed the recipe a bit: increased strawberries to nearly 3 cups, and omitted the lemon juice.  I also added 1 T. flour to the fruit mixture, to thicken any juice.  I think it tastes better if you double the oatmeal topping to give more crunch.

WOW!  It was delicious.  The only change I made was to add a Tbsp of cornstarch to the fruit.  I felt the amount of lemon (all the ingredients for that matter) was spot on.  Another fabulous recipe from Chef John.  If you think this is great, try his Macaroni and Cheese.  It is to DIE for!

I made this according to the recipe.  The flavor was excellent, but it turned out soggy.  I'll try another reviewers suggestion to add corn starch next time.

I'm very happy with this recipe! I used about 1/8  to 1/4 of a cup less of white sugar and was still very happy with the sweetness. I also used Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour instead of whole wheat flour because I like the sweetness of almond flour. It was a nice addition! I split this batch in between a large pie dish to use now and 6 small ramekins which I popped in the freezer to bake later.

I wanted to make a rhubarb pie, but then decided on a crisp for a quicker dessert.  The flavor is amazing!!  BUT- it is a soggy mess.  Like others have mentioned, there is nothing added to thicken this recipe.  The ‘crisp’ topping end up being a soggy mess.  If I were to make this again, I would add flour or cornstarch to thicken, or leave off the topping and make a crumble on the side to add separtetly.  Again, the flavor was nothing short of amazing, but the soggy crumble topping was such a let down.

I used sliced strawberries as part of the fruit. I also added a little extra oats because I like the texture. I am keeping this recipe as I will be making it again and again.

Dee-lish-iss! I doubled the oat topping (and baked longer) because I adore oat topping, but other than that I made this recipe as written. Nothing else I'd change. I sure wish rhubarb grew in my area of the world!

We picked fresh rhubarb from the yard and made this delicious crisp. We invited several family members over to enjoy this yummy treat. It was a hit!

The fruit portion was tasty; however my family complained there wasn't enough crispy topping. The next time I'll double the oatmeal topping and add a handful of pecans or walnuts. Good basic recipe.

Next time I will leave out the lemon, which really amped up the tartness IMHO. Added a tablespoon of flour just to be sure it wouldn't be soupy.
