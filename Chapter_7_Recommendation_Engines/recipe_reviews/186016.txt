I made this because it sounded different but good at the same time.  It was ok but nothing special,  It took ALLOT longer to prep and make than what it said. I think brown sugar would give a better flavor. I don't know if I will make this agian. Unless I really "tweak" it.

I will never for the life of me understand why people insist on labelling food items as Hawaiian just because they have pineapple as an ingredient. This recipe has a lot going on, but very little going for it. I decided to give it a shot to see if something interesting might play out from the extensive ingredient list. I agree with the previous reviewer that the prep-time is much more than the recipe indicates. Sweetheart is Hawaiian and after the first bowl, he did not care for it.

Alo-HA! great idea!  just dumped everything including, frozen raw chicken ,into the slow cooker.  used taco sauce instead of bbq sauce; we lllooovvee bbq sauce, but dr.colbert doesn't recommend it due to the high level of stealth sugar.  used regular hot salsa, so we added paprika to give it more of a smoky flavor.  next time, we'll add an additional can of pineapple tidbits with the juice.

Based on the other reviews and cost of ingredients for this dish, I was a little leery of trying it but I'm glad I did! The instructions are definitely way too complicated, the point of a slow cooker is to minimize the work. I just mixed the chicken and bbq sauce together first and then threw everything else in (except the pineapple) and cooked on low all day. Used minced onion and garlic puree, crushed tomatoes, 2 tbsp reg chili powder and 1tbsp chipotle chili powder, raspberry chipotle salsa (all I could find). Definitely cut up the pineapple chunks, they are too big right out of the can. The only thing I would try and fix is the sauce ratio. There seemed to be too much sauce and not enough chicken and beans.

as it sits the recipe is something that is a nice change up - it has a lot of flavors - i have tweeked it and have gotten a lot of thumbs up and requests for the recipe - what i did was take off 1 tbsp od regular chili powder i added 1 20 oz can of diced tomatoes - i like italian style - and i also added 1 more can of pineapple and pinneapple juice - im thinking about adding a third can of pineapples but not the juice from the other can. a friend of mine suggested if i want to really kick it add a can of adobo chili peppers just like the can that san marcos makes. if i do i will let you all know.

I loved this recipe!  It is now one of our favorites.  I used all chili powder, as I did not have ancho chile powder and used tomato sauce instead of chopped tomotoes.  It was delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

I halved and simplified this recipe (omitted roasted red pepper, butter, used onion powder for onion, did not marinade chicken first). It reminded me of my baked beans, but with chicken. The people I served it to enjoyed it, and the leftovers were excellent. 4 stars, not 5, for being a little unnecessarily complicated in the recipe.

This was very good. I have to say it spice level was hot. Not what my husband likes. I would cut back on the spiciness. This is a personal preference.

My husband liked the flavor but too spicy.  I couldn't handle the smell of it. I am pregnant so I know that's the main reason but just too many spices.

Made this for friends scaled to serve 4 (always like to experiment on others!) since I live in a freign country things are not always available so made the following changes: 1 clove garlic, chayenne pepper for ancho chile(?), 1 tsp ginger, 1 tbs vanilla, 1 can kidney beans no black beans, green salsa 4tbs instead of the chipolte salsa, and finally cut up 6 sun dried tomatoes (found buried in the fridge).  alot of change but still a great receipe... would love to make it in original form to see what it should really taste like!

This is a great chili. Next time I make it, I'll cut the chicken into smaller pieces (1" cubes was a bit too large) before marinading. And with the smaller pieces, just toss and lightly brown before adding to the crock pot.

For the most part I enjoyed this, but the bbq sauce was a bit overwhelming.  I would definitely cut this back to just moisten the chicken.  This was a very saucy chili, so I would also half the salsa.  I was able to find the chipotle salsa with the Hispanic food, and while it was not good at all with tortilla chips, this salsa adds lots of flavor for cooking.  Also I'm not really sure all that chili powder was really necessary.  I did not use the crockpot at all, it would have been just another thing to clean. This dish was a little time consuming, but relatively easy.

This was delicious. I found some pre-shredded chicken at the store which made it a snap! It was a hit at my chili cook off at work.

Thank you for this great recipe. I have won 3 chili cook-offs with this. First place in all 3. I do not marinate the chicken, I just add the barbeque sauce to the chili. I also use crushed pineapple and I do not drain this. Love this recipe.

I'll admit, I was super skeptical about a chili that a) had pineapple b) vanilla and c) chicken, no beef. However, mine turned out completely fantastic. For flavor, I would totally give this a five. 

That being said, I made a lot of modifications, the most significant being that after reading the comments on the long cooking time (on top of the 2 hours!) and the fact that I'm both busy and lazy, I decided on dumping everything into a crock pot. Cooking overnight is kind of like marinating, right? It probably loses out on some of the extra chicken texture and flavor, but after a night in the crock pot, I just used a fork to shred the chicken in the morning (it was super tender!) and let it sit some more, so I'm not too fussed over that loss. I also used southwest salsa, since I wanted to use up that whole can, and no ancho chili powder, so I just put another tablespoon of chili powder and half a tablespoon of cumin in instead. Oh, and more garlic.

I tried this in the morning when I was shredding the chicken, and it was good. I agree with other commenters - crushed pineapple is probably better. It was missing something though, so I put in a splash of vinegar and cayenne pepper, and that seemed to do the trick.

Retrospect says that the dish can be made healthier by excluding the butter, since I didn't use it to cook the chicken (and dumped it into the crock pot instead). Overall really good, and dumping everything into a crockpot makes this a much more feasible recipe.

I love this recipe and make it for football games when we are expecting guests. It is always super tasty and I get a ton of compliments. I even messed up one time and forgot to drain the beans, a little watery, but still excellent. Highly recommend

I did not do all of these steps. I used a SloCooker that can go on top of the stove and on a cooking base. I used smoked link sausage as well as the chicken. I sautéed these on top of the stove then added all of the other ingredients (except vanilla). Put the pot on the slow cooker base and followed the rest of the instructions. Yummy served with Jalapeño cornbread

The prep time took longer than the directions said and after it was finally done we were not impressed. I will not be making this no time too soon.

I actually liked this more than I was expecting by the time it finished cooking. I did all the prep work in the weekend the day before and put it in a container in the fridge for my husband to throw into the slow cooker at lunchtime the next day. I came home to a lovely smelling house and the food wasn't too shabby either. I ate mine plain (trying to cut down the carbs where I can sacrifice them) while the hubby and kids has some on bread buns. Hubby agreed that it would go nicely over rice. Will make again.

This recipe was surprisingly good.  We made it for a football party, doubled the recipe and it was not enough.  
The name, "Amazing Hawaiian Chili" says it all!!

I followed the idea of using taco sauce instead of bbq. It turned out pretty tasty, sweet and spicy.

Very nice sweet spicy flavor profile, but too thick for our taste.  Used pineapple tidbits instead of chunks because I just can't imagine wanting to bite into that much pineapple at one time in a bowl of chili
