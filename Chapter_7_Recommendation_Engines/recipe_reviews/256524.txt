This cake was pretty fabulous. I brought it to a potluck and it was a hit. I used mini Reese’s pieces on the top and mini Reese chocolates cut in half for the layer between topping and cake. I decided to put the chocolates on the cake while it was cooling (against the recipe’s instructions) which resulted in the candies melting, which seemed like a good idea, however when cutting the cake, the peanut butter cups had solidified into a layer between the cake and whipped topping. It was still yummy, just a bit difficult to cut. If I make this again, I’ll follow the directions better :)
