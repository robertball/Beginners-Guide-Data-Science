very good!!  I can't believe I found a recipe for this.  My mother's recipe was "a dash of this, a dash of that".  I never figured it out. This tastes almost as good as mom's was.  Only thing different was I used 2 salted eggs (my mom's homemade) and stirred it raw into the pork, instead of hard boiling first.  I'll be making this again.

Nice, clear instructions. I agree with the other person, definately use 2 eggs, and just use them raw. I soaked and finely chopped some 4-5 chinese dried mushrooms to add to the mix and they were great - gave it a bit more "crunch". I think a small amount of black fungus could also do the trick - just soak them in cold water for a few minutes then finely chop and add to the mix.

Note that there are two kinds of salted eggs available for sale. Some are already boiled, so follow these directions. If you can find the ones that are not already cooked, go ahead and mix the white part with a regular egg. Save the yolk. Make a depression in the center of the meat after you place it in the bowl to be steamed. Place the salted egg yolk in the depression you made. Steam as directed. Enjoy.

Mashing a hard boiled egg finely is rather hard, so I think it is easier to just mix the  raw white of the salted egg together with the rest of the ingredients, and then make a little well on top of the patty and put the salted yolk in and steam them together. Very simple to make, and very delicious too. Thank you for posting.

Great-tasting! The best-tasting way I have found to fix salted eggs yet. :) My Cantonese employer said this tastes just like her mom's recipe. Thank you for a great recipe!

Love this recipe!  I used a non cooked salt egg and a regular egg to mix with the pork.  Besides that I didn't change a thing.  Next time I might add chestnuts since I've seen it before in this kind of recipe.  Props to you for sharing!!

Quite tasty, with no changes to the recipe. My local market only carries salty eggs already hard-cooked, so the variations using uncooked salty eggs aren't feasable, but the cooked white chopped up nicely in a  food processor.  I used a largish stoneware cereal bowl to cook it in, because my usual cooking bowls would have been too deep and narrow for cooking well.  Next time, I'll try an egg fu yung gravy on the side.

I love this recipe.  I have been searching for it ever since my brother's mother in law made it.  The only thing I had to change was the kind of meat.  My fiancee doesn't eat pork so I used veal.
It's such a simple yet wonderful dish.  I make it a lot for a midday meal.

I made my own 40 day salted duck eggs and wanted to try them out with this recipe.  I used 2 of the eggs, hard-boiled first.  I liked the flavors in this dish, but the hard-cooked egg's yolk lender a mealy texture that we did not care for.  I would try this again with the salted egg uncooked.  Also, add the broccoli florets in the last 10 minutes or later.  The broccoli was way overdone after 30 minutes.  Thank you for sharing this traditional dish.  I love trying stuff that is new to me.
