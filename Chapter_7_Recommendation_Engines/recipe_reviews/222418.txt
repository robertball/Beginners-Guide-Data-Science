Two tablespoons of white sugar?  Yes, please :)  While this is a bit on the sweet side, I did enjoy it.  I can't say that I'll make it again, but I enjoyed it while it lasted.  I used bottled lime juice, so I'd imagine fresh would even kick it up a notch.  CHEERS, Allrecipes!

Yummy!! Nice base for creating...I didn't have white rum or club soda...so, used Cherry Rum and Gingerale and less sugar. I also added 4 fresh blackberries when I muddled the lime wedges & mint.....WOW!!

Great, but when I make again, I will decrease the sugar just a bit. Used 3/4 of a lime cut into quarters instead of 1/2, and muddled the mint thoroughly. Delicious drink!

This is a fun and refreshing drink to make.  I only had Spiced Rum instead of the light rum, but it turned out fine.  I don't eat a lot of sugar, so I only used 1 tablespoon.  It was still tangy and refreshing.
