I have added a photo.  First of all the ingredients and directions were confusing.  It needs a different layout to follow it easier.  However, as much time as it takes to make this recipe, it was quite disappointing. I followed the recipe as listed without changes. The cake was quite dry (even though I baked it 67 minutes instead of 75) dense, and really unedible.  The filling was grainy.  I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

I disagree with the last review!!!  And, so do my coworkers.  I won THIRD PLACE in my company's dessert bake-off with this recipe last year.  (The competition was tough.)  Everyone loved it.  It does take some work to make, but the flavor is good - I topped it off with a thick fudge glaze.

It was a good cake overall, but for some reason the cake itself is a bit dry except the center filling.  Several people in my family have made it so it isn't just me.  It takes a little longer than I had hoped but worth the wait.

Don't worry about excluding the bourbon from the cake when making it for children; alcohol is burned off in recipes that raise the temperature this high for this long.  All that is left is rich bourbon flavor.  This is pretty tasty, but it's not my favorite bundt cake recipe.

I'm really shocked at the bad ratings and glad I didn't read them before making the cake. It was a huge hit! I didn't find it dry at all. Should have used a little less water in the glaze as most of it ran off, but probably it was very tastey

After reading the comments about the cake's dryness, I opted to cook it only for 55 minutes. The filling and the parts of the cake adjacent to the filling are quite tasty and moist. However, the top part of the cake is somewhat...dry (that's the best word I can think of to describe it). Not sure if the flour ratio is off in the recipe, or if there is a better way to distribute the batter so that more of it is in contact with the filling. Speaking of the batter...

I was very skeptical about the batter - it was unlike anything I've prepared before. Very stiff. Not like a cake batter, but not like cookie dough either. But, it baked up fine.

Finally, the glaze was flavorful, too.
