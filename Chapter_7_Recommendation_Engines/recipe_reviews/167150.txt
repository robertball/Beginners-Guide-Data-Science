I was afraid to make this due to the reviews stating it was tasteless, so I kicked it up a notch and it turned out quite yummy.   I started with apple pieces and let them cook for a bit before adding green grapes and shredded chicken (because that's was was in the fridge) I let that cook up and gave it a dusting of ground ginger while it heated adding the chicken broth at the end but not the rice. I heated the rice separate and topped it with the stir-fry, making sure to drizzle a little of the broth over it.

Easy and tasty. I added a dash of garlic powder while heating the chicken, but still think it could have used...something. My man added soy sauce to his. Maybe some green onions next time; still pretty good as written though!

This sounds delicious -- like something quick for lunch if mixed all together. I'd personally rather thicken the sauce  with cornstarch and serve the stir fry over separately warmed rice. Or, made as is and chilled, and taken in a bento box! Nice simple combination. Thanks for the idea.

This recipe was VERY simple to make, fast, and quite yummy.  Best of all, it was enjoyed by the complete spectrum of tastes in my family, from my husband (who loves his meat), to my picky-eater son (whose main food group is fruit).  NO LEFTOVERS!  The only change I made was to add more grapes.  If you are one who likes to add grapes to your chicken salad for sandwiches, then you will like this warmed-up version!
NOTE AFTER MAKING THIS A FEW TIMES: I like to make this by cooking the rice in chicken broth, which adds more flavor.  Also, I add the grapes in after the chicken is cooked, for just 2 minutes; then I add in the rice and extra broth.  This is long enough to warm the grapes, but not so long that they get mushy.

This was pretty good the first time around! It doesn't warm up well though, so don't make enough to have leftovers!

Definitely a unique combination of flavors! I used brown rice and fat free chicken broth.

I actually had all of the ingredients available in the refrigerator so I gave this a try.  COuld use a little more taste, but it is a quick, simple and tasty little lunch dish. A good way to use up leftovers.

Loved the simplicity, however, it was pretty tasteless.  I think it could use onions and garlic for a start.
