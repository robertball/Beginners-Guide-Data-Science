This was a delicious recipe!  Great combination of flavors - I was tempted to leave out the olives but I'm glad I added them - the kalamata's added a delicious, subtle taste.  To make it a little lighter, I used much less oil and whole wheat couscous.  You can also used reduced fat feta to cut out some more fat.  I also sauteed the chicken in a balsamic marinade to give it extra flavor. The second time I made this I used fig flavored white balsamic which was delish!

Update - made again replacing sundried tomatoes and olives with dried cranberries and chickpeas. Also used a honey flavored rotisserie chicken.  It worked great for a sweeter option (can also use goat cheese instead of feta)

This is an interesting, tasty recipe; I'm so glad I tried it! I made it last night because the ingredient mix was not a familiar taste combination to me. Also, I wanted to make enough to share with a neighbor who had been very helpful to me during some recent medical problems and now had some of her own.

I made the recipe as written, though I used extra virgin olive oil (2/3rds cup), 1 1/2 Tbs regular balsamic vinegar, and added a bit more lime juice (didn't have lemon) after tasting. In my mind this is not a big change to the recipe. Used the fresh herbs, rather than dried, as listed. The dressing tasted a bit odd, but other reviewers said to try it. I cut up two boneless skinless chicken breasts into fairly small slivers rather than chunks, then pan fried a few minutes, added some water, covered, and cooked through. Drained the juice (saved for my cats) then refrigerated the chicken. Julienned English cucumber with a small V-Slicer Plus mandoline (available from BB&B), chopped the kalamatas, and chopped some oil-packed sundried tomatoes. Made 1 cup couscous in only 1 cup water with some butter and Herb-Ox dried chicken bouillon powder. Turned out fine.

Mixed it all up and tasted. Needed some more salt and pepper. Then added about a cup of chopped oil-packed artichoke hearts and tasted again. Great! Served over chopped lettuce.

My neighbor and her husband really enjoyed it, wanted the recipe for herself, and my husband wanted seconds.

Great for a summer meal. Friends loved it and asked for the recipe.  I would cut down on the vinegar next time though.

This was just awesome!  I made it as written since this was my first cooking experience with couscous and my first time with a Mediterranean style dish.  I will make this often, but I will definitely cut way back on the olive oil, and I'll use fresh tomatoes and cucumbers out of my garden instead of sun-dried tomatoes and English cucumbers.  Probably going to use black olives next time just from an expense standpoint, too.  I'll also thoroughly cool the couscous before adding the cucumbers since the cucumbers became slightly less crispy because of the warmth.  The flavor was unbelievably good, and I'm trying to think of other uses for the dressing.

Great refreshing salad!  I did make a few changes though...didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so used roasted red and yellow peppers.  Also, this recipe makes WAY too much dressing.  It had a good flavor (I used a 1/2 C evoo and a 1/2 C lemon juice, 2 T. regular balsamic and the rosemary, S&P) but I only used a few tablespoons to dress the salad.  Maybe just put it out on the table so your guests can put as much or as little as they want on their salad.  Addictive!!!

I made this recipe with orzo instead of couscous because I had it in the pantry, and it was delicious.  I cooked the orzo and prepared the dressing the night before, added several Tbsps of dressing to the orzo and chilled overnight.  I wanted the orzo to incorporate the dressing flavors. I chopped all of the other ingredients the next morning and put the salad together.  Took it to a picnic, and received several compliments.  My only other change was to use chopped grape tomatoes instead of sundried.  I felt there were several strong flavors (Feta, olives, rosemary) and maybe the sundried would be one too many.

Really delicious. I only used about 3/4 of the salad dressing and there could be less olive oil, and I didn't use white balsamic. I added dried cranberries as well as the sun dried tomatoes because it definitely needed some colour, however next time I make it I will use the cranberries and omit the sun dried. I will also like to add some artichokes next time. Yummy!

I would recommend using less olive oil. Nice served hot. Leftovers great in a pita or tortilla wrap.

Like another reviewer I also wish I could give this 3.5 stars. I followed the recipe exactly as written. If I make this again I will use basil or oregano in place of the rosemary. Also I would add artichoke hearts.

This is fantastic! I could not stop eating it...so many yummy flavors in one place. it does have too much dressing, but only in regard to oil. Evoo goes a loooong way, so Ijust cut mine in half. I made sure that I made this the day before, mixed in the dressing and then let it sit overnight. This helped a lot as it allowed the couscous to soak up the flavor without it tasting too oily. Fresh herbs are an absolute must here!

So yummy!  I've made this time and time again for family and friends and is a huge hit.  The only thing I changed was the amount of fresh rosemary...I use a little less, but either way one of my favorites!

Delicious! I tried to make this a bit healthier so I made a few modifications, I used ww couscous (and cooked according to the directions on the box), added steamed broccoli, fresh spinach and red onion. Also decreased the OO to 1/4 cup and added about 1/4 cup of water to the dreasing. I used regular balsamic vinegar (all I had) and omitted the olives and tomatoes (don't care for). Amazing stuff and it keeps super well. I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch this week. Thanks for the recipe:)

As suggested by other reviewers, I used 1/2 cup oil and I added 1 teaspoon of chopped garlic.  This recipe was wonderful and will become a regular in our house.

Very good.  Used fresh tomatoes instead of sun dried.  Also, used less than half of the dressing.  Seems like the dressing could use a lower ration of olive oil sense the flavor is pretty prominent even when using just a little of the dressing.

I'm on the fence about this one.  I think I would give it a 3.5 rating if I could.  I think that exchanging the rosemary for basil would make this a winner for me (I know that kinda of changes the recipe dramatically!)  Nice light summer meal.  Does make enough for lunch the next day.  I also think they evoo was a little on the strong side taste wise (it was the dominate taste for me) and I might make the quantity in the dressing a little less.  This is certainly one to play with.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty stuff, quite full of flavor.  It makes a lot more than I expected, so it definitely needs to be cut in half if you aren't preparing for a whole family or party.  It's also a lot of prep for a salad, but it makes a great summer main dish.  I followed suggestions for cutting down the oil, added garlic, yellow pepper, and purple onion.  I also used a veggie stock instead of chicken so that vegetarians could pick the chicken out.  The fresh rosemary is interesting--definitely needs to be chopped up a bit, since it has a tough texture that reminds me of pine needles.

A friend of mine made this and I tried some, it was AWESOME!  She used the large pearl type couscous which I think blended with the rest of the salad better.  Small couscous tends to stick or clump together too much in a salad.  I am going to make this with the pearl sized couscous, it's heavenly!

I'm rating this a five even though I made very slight changes due to personal preference.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of sundried, and used less dressing.  Just add a little bit at a time and stop when you've reached your desired level.  Also ... since I'm not on a TV cooking show where the underlings wash my  blender or food processor, I try to avoid them whenever possible.  I see no reason to use one for this dressing.  A long whisking, and you should be good to go.  The dressing does have the normal proportions of oil to acids (normally, about three to one) and we did not find it overly oily.  Thanks to the author for submitting it.

I used a chicken bouillon cube for the stock as I had made no fresh stock. I measured boiling water from the kettle, added the stock cube to dissolve, then added that to the couscous and let it stand to soak in, before fluffing up. I also left out the olives. Apart from that though I pretty much followed the recipe and it was lovely. I'll be making it again!

made it really times and always get request for recipes.  Great salad.  I usually end up using a little more than half the dressing though.

LOVED IT!  This is definitely something I will be making again.  Like others, I reduced the oil.  I also didn't have sundried tomatoes, so I used regular.  Same for the olive, used just black olives.  It is the fresh rosemary that makes this recipe special, so do NOT substitute dried.  I think I used less than called for, because it took forever to chop.  I actually made half the dressing and it seems sufficient to me.

Great for a hot summer night.  I used 1/2 cup oil instead of 3/4, which worked out wonderfully.  I also used black olives because that's all I had.  Would make again!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I made a few changed based on my own personal taste. Following other suggestions, I used 1/2 cup of balsamic and olive oil dressing and it was enough flavor. I also substituted red bell peppers for the sun dried tomatoes. I used the 1/2 cup of feta, but next time I will add more to get more of a feta flavor. Overall a great recipe that I look forward to making again.

Fantastic! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2cup of oil rather than 3/4cup, whole wheat couscous and reduced fat feta cheese. The flavors were delicious and even better then next day! A new favorite dish to pass!

I cut the oil to 1/2 cup, which was plenty.  Left out the olives, since my family hates them, and used fat free feta.  Very good.  Will make again, although all the chopping made it more time consuming than I thought it would be.

This was YUMMY!  I also used balsamic vinegar and it worked fine.  The rosemary is what really gives this salad the great flavor so don't skimp on that.  Thanks for submitting!

I knew that I would enjoy this recipe, but I was skeptical given the ingredients that my husband would.  He was so surprised how all the strong flavours combined turned out to be so tastefully mild.  He picked out the olives but we both thought this was excellent!  We will definately put this on our party dish list.

This dish was absolutely delicious! I added a bit extra feta and less olives (personal preference) and it was so good! I am usually such a picky eater and I gobbled this up so fast!

This was great.  I blended the dressing in my Vitamix, and the rosemary was infused into the dressing.  I did use some Moroccan seasoning when I pan sautéed the chicken, which added some good flavor to the salad.  Other than that

with the dressing, yes, the oil to vinegar ratio is off. I used 2/3c and that was still too much oil to only 2T white vinegar. Good over green leaves as a salad or with the couscous.

Very Fresh! I was worried this would be bland, but was pleasantly surprised. A couple things to note, I normally use dried herbs when it calls for fresh,  but that is not possible with this dish. Also, we enjoyed it right after making it, but it was better cold the next day after chilling over night. I am thinking in the summer I will use it at a cold side and just leave out the chicken. It will cut down on prep time too!

Great recipe; it's basically tabbouleh with chicken. With that in mind I crumbled up about two teaspoons-ish of dried mint leaves and included that in the dressing. It tasted pretty good before, but I think mint takes it up a notch. I bet bulghur could be substituted for couscous too.

Also used fresh diced cherry tomatoes rather, than sundried.

This was a great salad that my whole family loved. The only changes I made were to add some yellow and orange bell pepper and garlic. Mostly because I needed to use them up, not because the salad needed them. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a versatile  salad.  I used quinoa, no chicken, or olives as one guest is a vegetarian & one did not like olives.  The best part was the dressing.  I will use this on a cold pasta salad in the future.  A must for this dish is the Feta cheese.

This was excellent!  I omitted the chicken and used this dish as a side.  I added artichoke hearts in place of the chicken.  I loved the salad dressing, but my husband wasn't crazy about it and added some italian dressing instead.  Will be making this again!

This is the most wonderful Couscous Salad! It's on my " to do list" whenever my oldest son visits from Japan. I didn't change any of the ingredients and it is perfect just the way it is posted. The first time I made it, I didn't have any dried tomatoes on hand and used fresh ones. This also worked very well. Five stars!

Really, really nice.  Passed on the sundried tomatoes and olives only because I don't like them and added a few extra veggies.  Great summer-y dish.

Like another reviewer I used regular balsamic vinegar instead of the white and it was fantastic.  I was surprised at how well all the flavors came together.  I'll definitely be making it again.

This recipe was great everyone loved it! The only changes i made were that i used regular balsamic vinegar because i couldn't find the white and i left out the chicken and cucumbers and used green and black olives. It was great!

Absolutely delicious alternative to a chicken/pasta dish!!  The second time I made it I added chopped cashews to add another texture and it was even better. I would also use a little less vinegar next time. This is my new favorite.

Love it!  I tried it once with black olives instead of kalamata olives and it was still good.  But when I made it with kalamata olives it was even better.  This is a delicious dish!
