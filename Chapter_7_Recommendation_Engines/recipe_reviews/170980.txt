This was delicious and very easy to make. I used frozen (thawed and drained) peaches. The house smelled AMAZING while it was baking (mine took 30 min). I actually let mine sit longer than 10 minutes before plating it. Thanks for a great recipe sueb! I will definitely be making this again!

This was easy and great tasting. I used fresh picked from the tree peaches. They were little ones so I just used enough to cover the bottom. Almonds were what I found first in the freezer so I used a handful of those. The almond flavoring was a little strong for me and not enough amaretto. I will probably swap the extract for it the next time and try it with the pecans and use a cake pan. My glass pie plate took a lot longer, it finally dawned on me I had to lower the temperature for it. Great recipe Sueb! My son finally got around to trying a piece I saved for him, he said that was some good stuff! (High praise from him, he's not much of a sweet eater and he is a chef)

I've made this twice since last week, for two separate dinner parties & it was a hit. The flavour combination of peach and amaretto works well in any baked good, and the presentation of this dessert makes it beautiful to present to a host/hostess.

Very good! I was worried that I'd screwed it up a bit as it took quite awhile longer to cook the cake through and then when I flipped it over the top seemed really wet and soggy. After cooling and sitting out for the afternoon though, it firmed up more and while it was a little gooey (not sure if that's how it was supposed to be) but definitely really tasty. I made it in a springform pan as I didn't trust my ability to turn it out of a pie plate in one piece and I think my pie plate would have been too small anyway. I guess I should have played with the oven temp to cook it properly due to my pan change but it still came out great and everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe, sueb

Very good! A nice change from peach cobbler or crisp.  I had bought a 1/2 peck of peaches from the peach orchard and had already made cobbler, crisp and baked peaches in syrup.  I found this recipe and made it just as written.  It smelled fabulous and tasted just as great.  I made it in a 10" pie pan as I was afraid it would boil over in the 9".  I think it would have, so was glad I had used the larger pan. It popped right out of the pie pan also and looked very nice.

Sorry to say but I really wasn't all that impressed with this reciepe.  The peaches I used were amazingly good, it took all my willpower not to eat too much so I would have enough for the cake.  It didn't cook all the way throught even though I cooked it 10 min. longer then the reciepe called for.  We thought the cake laked in flavor.

Wonderful recipe!  I omitted the almond flavoring and added additional amaretto to the cake batter.  This is a keeper :)

DELICIOUS!  My parents and husband just raved about this cake.  I made it as written, using 2 fresh peeled peaches and put it in a 9" pie plate.  Luckily I had an oven saver under my pie plate as some of the butter mixture bubbled over.  Next time I will bake in my deep dish pie pan. The taste of these ingredients are absolutely spot on.  Thanks sueb for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper.

Delicious. I used nectarines instead of peaches...my daughter ate them before I could use them....I love amaretto.  I used vanilla instead of almond extract as I ran out.  But it was still delicious. I'll definately make again...and hopefully with peaches next time.

This cake has a nice light flavor but I felt that the pecans almost overwhelmed it. It was good but didnâ€™t wow me like I thought it might. I may give it another try at some point in the future.

I really wanted to like this as I love the peach and Amaretto combination.  It is easy to make (I used my mom's cast iron skillet) and nice to look at.  However, for us it lacked flavor - other than sweet.  I was hoping for a bit more of the Amaretto flavor - and I used it in the cake as a replacement for the extract - but it still really didn't come through well.   I won't repeat this recipe.

I used tinned peaches, not fresh. The cake tasted good, but it was really dense and gluey... Not sure if I will be making it again.

I couldn't taste the peaches over the strong amaretto flavor. Both the cake and the topping were overly sweet.

This was good. I omitted the pecans because of an allergy in a guest. I also added amaretto to the batter. The cake did need to cook an additional 10 minutes.  It was a decent recipe but could use some tweeking.

I love amaretto, and I loved this! I made this in a bundt pan, and put the butter/brown sugar / pecan mixture in first, then laid the sliced peaches on top of that, then the cake batter. It didn't turn out as pretty as I would have liked, but it sure was tasty!
