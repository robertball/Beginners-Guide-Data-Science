I thought this was great... I use cider exclusively in place of water, but I do that with everything like this. This is very rich and creamy... definitely the best I've tried!

P.S. If you change everything in the recipe (amounts, ingredients, cooking time) and then ultimately you don't like the end result, don't come back and rate the recipe a "three". Don't rate the recipe at ALL unless you FOLLOW it; that's just not fair.

Wonderful!  Used Captain Morgan's spiced rum, topped with French Vanilla Cool Whip and sprinkled nutmeg on top.  An addicting dessert in a mug.

Oh so yummy. I cut the recipe in half thinking it seemed like alot.  Wrong move.  Make the whole recipe.  Add double batter, rum and spices. Added whipped cream, sprinked w/ cinnamon.  
Used Captain Morgans spiced rum.  My friends loved it!!!

My mom uses this same recipe. When we were young we got to have it in coffee as a treat. She gave me a tub of it and my roommate ate it all with a spoon like ice cream!  Good stuff!

Made this batter Christmas Eve and just finished the batter tonight, end of March !  An excellent recipe but you may want to cut it in half. I gave batter away to two different friends and still had tons left over.  It is so darn good, we even warmed it in the microwave and poured it over vanilla ice cream as a sauce, yummy !

This was the first time I have ever had anything like this, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was good. Not the kind of drink I drink all night, its very rich, but what a treat!

I tried this recipe for a get-together after a day of skiing, and those 100 servings were barely enough for 20 people! This recipe makes the sweetest, warmest, creamiest drink... and with the smoothest, most beautiful cappuccino color - absolutely perfect to warm you up after a day in the snow. Toss in a cinnamon stick and top with a dollop of whipped cream and dash of cinnamon if you really want to look like a goddess.

Excellent recipe! I brought this to our extended family's Christmas Eve get together. My relatives were skeptical at first--they'd never even heard of hot buttered rum--not like this stuff, anyway! It was a very gloopy recipe, but man, was it worth it! One person decided to try it, and soon enough, I was busy making cup after cup of this stuff! A1 stuff. I chose this particular recipe out of the other buttered rum recipes because this included spices. The spices were wonderful, gave it an intoxicating aroma, and worked really well with the quality dark Jamaican rum I chose to use. All the rum and sugar gave me a whopper of a headache, but I'm not complaining! Well worth it!

This is really, REALLY good!  I had wanted to give as gifts and got my Ziploc baggies all ready with instructions and everything, then realized that this batter doesn't freeze like ice cream, it's more like a thick, sticky panckake batter (presumably hence the name "Hot Buttered Rum BATTER)...I ended up keeping it for myself - poor me!  Thanks for sharing Shari - will make another batch for an upcoming after Christmas party!!!

All I had was 3/4 a pound of butter (3 sticks) and it was still excellent.  What I will do next time is soften the butter then cream in the brown sugar Then add the powdered sugar and ice cream, and spices.  I also gave to my kids by heating up apple cider.  They loved it.  But I thought it was sweet and rich, so next drink I think I may mix some cider with hot water, then add the batter.   YUMMY!!! Also good added to a cup of coffee.

So disappointing. I followed the instructions to the letter, but it just doesn't taste that great. It's too sweet and not buttery enough for my liking. If I were to make this again, I'd cut the confectioner's sugar completely. Overall, it's just not that good for the calories you're consuming while drinking it.

Holy Cow - this stuff is awesome!  I made this the day before Thanksgiving - drank it that night, and the next 2 days.  My family loved it.  Also tried it in coffee - very good.  I didn't change a thing.  We are having a Christmas party in a couple weeks - and we are making a doouble batch!

This was THE best hot buttered rum batter ever!  I made it for an outdoor fall tailgate party on a cold Sunday. I scaled the recipe down to 50 servings, thinking I could freeze the rest for another day.  Wishful thinking... it was gone before we knew it. There were a few creative people who added a scoop of vanilla ice cream before drinking and loved it.  Guess I have to make more for the next party!

OH MY GOD, this is delicious!!!  I like using more of the batter per cup though.  I used equal amounts of rum and batter, then filled the cup with the boiling water.  YUMMY!

WOW...Amazing!  This drink is so rich and such a treat!  We've been trying it out mixed with other types of liquor...it is wonderful with coconut rum, amaretto, frangelico, or with no booze at all in coffee or cider.  I think this batter is partially responsible for our winter weight gain!  So Yummy!

A wonderful recipe for the holidays.  I would recommend it to anyone planning to entertain.  It is soooo good and easy to make.  The batter keeps well in the freezer.  I would suggest storing in several small containers (keeps it fresh).

This was my first taste of hot buttered rum and I have to say it wasn't what I expected.  I thought it would be much sweeter.  It was very good though and my guests drank it up even my husband who is usually a beer man.  I will probably make it again.

Absolutely fantastic!  Even without the rum this is a very satisfying warm beverage.  I served it at a Harvest Party and it received rave reviews.  I added more than one spoonful of batter per cup. A lot of my guests said it tasted like gingerbread.

Very Good, makes a lot! When I mix it up, I like my drink to be thick, so I use 3 TBS of batter.  Also, try it w/Frangelico instead of rum!

Oh my, this is amazing. I'd never had a hot buttered rum before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The batter is incredible (yes, very rich, but just read the ingredients!) and makes an excellent addition to a vanilla milkshake. :) I had trouble mixing the sugars into the butter, but when I added the ice cream, everything blended decently. There are still a few little lumps of sugar in the batter but they dissolve in the hot water. An excellent recipe, thanks Sheri!

My niece and nephews love this drink without the rum too!  I doubled the spices and added some fresh ground ginger (not to mention whole nutmeg, ground fresh).

Love this!  I actually add 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract as well and use 2 T. of batter to a cup.  It keeps very well in the freezer and is so much better than store bought.

Delicious.  This is really good as my creamer in my coffee in the morning, without the buttered rum :)  This will now be my recipe.  I also used Spiced Rum like some other reviewers.  Just a splash for me.  Used French Vanilla Breyer's.

I have been really sick with a horrible cold that I can't seem to shake. While purusing allrecipes the other night I really wanted to find a hot drink to warm my insides and help me sleep. I love hot buttered rum and when I saw this recipe it sounded really yummy. My husband made it for me last night and I will tell you it made me sleep like a baby! I felt so warmed up and helped loosen my sinuses enough that I could get some decent sleep. Not saying it's a cure all for what ails you, but it sure can't hurt! Plus it tastes sooooo good! I plan on making more of these on xmas! thanks

SOOOOO good and very addicting.  We used it with Captain Morgans.  I put in about 2 tbs of the batter, 1 1/2 oz of liquor and then a little hot water.  Everyone loves it.  And there is PLENTY of batter to last a while in the freezer.

I used a lot of the batter in my drinks because we like it sweet and creamy! Topped with whipped cream and ground cinnamon and nutmeg---this made it taste just like or even better than those seasonal drinks from Carribou Coffee or Starbucks! This is the best (with or without the rum in it)!!!!!!!

I never had a hot buttered rum drink before this one, and now I am hooked. It was easy to make and delicious to drink.  I did the 2 scoops and it was a bit sweet, so the next one might be just one scoop ( or maybe just  more rum was needed!) Perfect for the holidays!
Thanks Sheri

This hot buttered rum batter is rich and creamy - definitely not for calorie counters. As good or better than what you can buy in the store.

An excellent base for hot buttered rum! Keeps very well in the freezer (don't try to freeze it in "cubes" or anything else, it's far too sugary to freeze). I have been known to add ground cloves, ground allspice, or any manner of other delicious spices to this recipe. Also, if you're not using salted butter, do add a pinch.

Like everyone, i agree the flavor of this is great--you could eat it with a spoon or drink it with a straw.  But this is butter-based and really doesn't mix well with hot water.  I have tried it in coffee but I think i will try it with hot milk and/or simply use it as an ice cream topping.

A Christmas party hit! I doubled the spice requirements and added a pinch of clove. Adults loved it and the kids loved the virgin version of it (hot cider used instead of water and rum).

This recipe is AMAZING!! You can change it up simply by using a different type of vanilla ice cream (french, vanilla bean etc...) or adding a bit of pure vanilla to give it a richer flavor. The recipe is very versatile. Use it in coffee, with hot water or in cider for starters. I've used rum (spiced IS best) Baileys Irish Cream, coffee and whiskey and yes, even plain ;) This recipe is simply.....NUUUUMMMMY! I made a triple batch and am giving it away in jars for Christmas. THANK YOU SHERIMA1!!!!

This is a great recipe! I started making this in 1965 when I found it in a newspaper in Ohio. Kept it for years but then forgot about it. It makes wonderful Christmas gifts. I love it with apple cider or even in my coffee. Warms your from the inside out.

I halved the recipe and am now wondering why in the world I didn't make the whole thing!?!? This stuff is DELICIOUS.  We don't drink, so as a non-alcoholic alternative, I used apple cider.  8 oz apple cider to 2 Tablespoons batter.  If anyone has ever had the Sbux Spiced Apple Cider/Caramel apple spice (what ever its called) - this is almost a dead ringer for it.  Every fall and winter I always order these at Sbux - it's my absolute favorite and I'm so so so happy I can now make these at home when ever I please. Thank you for this wonderful recipe :)

I've been making this batter for two Fall/Winters now and I LOVE it! I use about 2 Tbsp. of batter in a mug, because I can't really taste it with just one tablespoon. But other than that, the batter is perfect as is.

We thought this was just wonderful! Perfect for a cold night. However, we ended up using double the amount listed in each mugful and added extra cinnamon and nutmeg. Next time I will add extra spices to the batter, and will continue to add extra batter per cup. Rich and wonderful!

This is my first time making Hot Buttered Rum...I had it in November at a party and searched for a recipe.  This was such a hit!  I doubled the recipe (after reading reviews of giving as a gift) I gave small containers to 4 friends, and had enough to bring to two family Christmases and New Years Eve party.  Everyone LOVED it!  Each person that had a cup asked for the recipe.  I hate to share it...I feel special having such a fun treat for everyone.  I used Spiced Rum for each drink, and the kids loved it with cider.  I wasn't as big of a fan with the cider.  I used Vanilla bean ice cream.  I will make every year!  Thank you for sharing!

This batter is fantastic!  I made it the other day and then had friends over for hot buttered rums and cheesecake.  To say it was a hit is an understatement, it was a smash hit!  It’s very easy to put together and the fact that it keep in the freezer means you can enjoy them all winter long.  That is if the batter would last that long, ha!  Thanks so much for sharing, I can’t wait to get home and have one!

Very creamy and buttery.  I think that one tablespoon isn't enough for a cup, so I add a little more.  Good with or without the rum.

I'm in love with this recipe! I thought that making my own buttered rum batter was a lot of work but my hubby finally convinced me to try it. This recipe is so easy and tastes way better than the grocery store kind which I used to swear by.  I had no problems with the sugar clumping like other reviewers said.  I mixed the batter with Captain Morgan's spiced Rum and it taste so much better than using regular rum. I don't think I can keep this to myself and plan on making it as holiday gifts for family and friends.

Wasn't sure what to expect of this but it was good, especially with 2 tablespoons of the mix per cup.  I've noticed that on some of the Buttered Rum reviews people mentioned the "butter" floating on top.  Because butter is dairy based it shouldn't do this, make sure you don't replace it with margarine- oil based.  Also, I doubled the recipe and put it in a plastic gallon ice cream container, it fit perfectly.  Make sure you don't put it in a chest type deep freeze while it hardens though.  My kids tipped it and dumped half in the full freezer as the seal didn't hold and I didn't notice until 6 hours later, what a mess.

This is the best and easiest hot buttered rum batter I've found. Toss out those canned mixes! It is a huge amount, though, so I halved it. Like others, when serving this I also use spiced rum and add a touch of whipped cream to the top. For those folks who complained it's too much work to make or for guests to put together, are you kidding me?! If that's the case you'd better stick to things that can be drunk right out of the bottle.

This is not a pretty drink, but it sure is good!  I cut the recipe in half and used a very high quality, natural ice cream.  When I added the water I found I had to increase the amounts of batter and rum to get a rich tasting drink.  I could eat this right out of the freezer with a spoon!

This turned out delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to use whipping cream instead of the ice cream because I didn't want all the strange ingredients, guar gum, etc. that come with store bought ice cream.  The drink was very creamy, sweet and spicy.

Hmmmm, not quite what I had in mind.  I found the mixture to be too sweet and then when added to the water made this unappetizing tasting syrup.

I made this recipe exactly as written...it's a definite 5 stars! The batter will never freeze completely solid--don't be alarmed when it keeps a thick gelato texture after hours or days in the freezer. Also, the sprinkled nutmeg at the end makes all the difference. I will be remaking this batter/hot drink every holiday season.

I remember drinking this (sans rum) when I was a child, it was a Christmas favorite of my grandma.  One taste and it was 1979 again, snowing outside, and Grandma was still with us.  Isn't that what traditions do?  Keep us in touch with our loved ones through those shared memories. Thanks for sharing this recipe. =)

Absolutely wonderful. I was afraid it would create a watery drink, but not at all - the result is creamy perfection. I made two batches to give out as presents, and it was easy and fun. A keeper!

I have been leary of buttered rum recipes because I have had weak tasting buttered rum before, and there is nothing worse!! This recipe is DELISH with just the hot water and rum! I am going to try it with hot apple cider for Christmas. I made a full batch, and it will last a while. Excited to have it again. Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night to test it before giving it as a gift for Christmas. It was REALLY good. I followed the recipe exactly, but cut it in half. After being in the freezer overnight it's still not completely frozen..

OMG! This is amazing! I just had to try it so I made a glass before I tossed it in the freezer and its soooo good. I made it exactly the way the directions say wouldn’t change a thing. I added a spiced rum to it (don’t even care that’s its 11:30am) but I can’t wait to serve it over a bon fire this weekend.

There are no words great enough to describe how good this is. I cut this in half, as it's only my husband and I that will consume it. I also use two tablespoons of the rum batter and add a shot of spiced rum. It's liquid heaven.

This batter was very tasty "straight up", but thin and watery as a mixer. I even tried using only 4oz of water. Maybe it would be good with hot cider as others have suggested.

Nothing warms the insides like a nice cup of hot buttered rum!  And this recipe works great.  Like other readers suggested, I creamed the butter with the sugar instead of melting it.  I also cut the recipe in half.  Very good!

Yummy!  I followed the direction but used another recipes mixing directions.  I used 1 -2 oz dark rum, 2 heaping Tbls of batter, and 6 oz of boiling water.  This makes the drink much creamier and sweeter.  I can't wait to serve this at my holiday party!

I had never tasted hot buttered rum before and now I wish I hadn't....because it is so awesome! This is a great recipe and makes a ton. I will put a bit more spice in it next time and I may use a couple of packets of spiced cider mix in it (recommended by a British friend) but overall it was wonderful.

Move over coffee!! This is so warm and wonderful on this freezing MN evening. I did as others suggested...and added 2 TBSP of the batter to hot water & rum. Also, tried a non-alcoholic version......2 TBSP batter and 8 oz hot Apple Cider. Very yummy!**UPDATE: Substituted Rum with ButterShots (butterscotch schnapps)...WOW, its hard to decide which is my favorite. This has become our favorite eve drink while wrapping gifts.

We found this far too sweet & watery.  I can see its potential though & might try it again, but perhaps in coffee to make the flavour a little richer & hopefully cut some of the sweetness.

Excellent! My prior efforts at making hot buttered rum always turned out disgusting, but this makes excellent drinks! I think I might possibly double the spices next time around, but otherwise this is wonderful. I think the people who complain about it being syrupy are letting it sit out at room temprature for too long. I keep the stuff in the freezer, and when I want some, I boil a mug of water and scoop a couple tablespoons of this into it, which cools it just enough to drink right away. Then I just throw in a little bit of rum. This is a great after-ski drink, and a nightcap as well!

We've been making this in my family for years.  I've never met anyone who didn't love it. It's just not the holidays without a nice warm mug of this deliciously decadent drink!

The only reason I give this recipe 4 stars and not 5 is because it doesn't include ground clove and allspice. 

I just finished making this recipe and am enjoying a cup now, its excellent with White Christmas rum and brandy drink and I also added a drop of apple jack liquor to it.  
I really do suggest adding allspice and clove; gives it a little extra spice that's o so nice!

I just made this over my weekend for some holiday cheer while I was putting up my christmas tree and watching classic christmas movies. I have got to tell you that this drink is AMAZING! The butter did not seperate like some of the reviews claimed. And if it is too sweet just add some more rum :D

I will be making this a christmas tradition for the years to come.

This is almost exactly like my Mom's recipe. We added real vanilla beans and used french vanilla ice cream instead of using confectioners sugar. I like to added an extra pat of salted butter when I mix in the hot water. Also try mixing it over a carmel square. So yummy!!!!

So yummy, but in my family, either you loved it or hated it.  I halved the recipe..  My only real complaint was the spices would sink to the bottom of the mug so the last few sips were pretty nasty.

I had never tried this drink before but it sounded so yummy that I decided to try it and I made the whole batch. And it is amazing! My husband and I both love it and I can't wait to serve it on Christmas. I did mix two table spoons in though instead of one. I think I will try it in my coffee in the morning!

I have been making this batter recipe for years during the Christmas holidays, and this is just holiday heaven in a mug (and it will sneak up on you with a good buzz!). For a non-alcoholic version I make for the kids, use hot apple juice in place of hot water and rum.

I just made some of this Hot Buttered Rum Batter tonight.  It is delicious, however, I had to use a little more batter than a tablespoon for my taste.  It could have something to do with the standard coffee mugs these days being much larger than they used to be.  Once I added two tablespoons of batter, I was in heaven.

I have been searching and searching for a Hot Buttered Rum recipe ever since I had it years ago and all the ones I have tried have let me down - except this one! This is absolutely delicious! I don't like a bunch of spices and all of the others were too flavored with nutmeg or cinnamon. This one is so creamy and yummy! All of my friends have asked for the recipe and I find neighbors knocking on my door for a cup when the weather is nasty! :)

This is very good but I think the recipe is off saying confectioners sugar, I think it should be granulated so that's what I used.  I wasn't sure how it would work with the powdered sugar.  I did like everyone said and used 2 T per cup of the batter and the spiced rum.  YUM.  It's not what my husband calls hot buttered rum but it's good.

I loved this and gave it as gifts to any rum loving friends as well as keeping a lot for myself.  I'm glad it makes so much because on cold winter days after work, this is a wonderful hot drink. I used to have a so-so recipe, but now I'll be making this every year!

This recipe DOES make a lot, but use good ingredients, and who cares?  In a pretty freezer container with recipe attached, it's a great gift idea.  I used HaagenDazs ice cream, and freshly ground nutmeg, and it was delicious even as a virgin hot drink for the holidays.  Rum's optional, but the freshly grated nutmeg on top isn't.

My Dad used to make this every Christmas. I had never tried it with powdered sugar, also added ground cloves, and it's very good! I did use my Dad's method of simply softening the butter (not melting), and creaming it together with the sugars, then adding the ice cream. Less mess, easy to scoop after it's been in the freezer and everything still melts together perfectly when adding the hot water. I also use 2 big scoops of batter, depending on the size of the cup.

Not a big hit. Made as stated, felt like I wasted a bunch of ice-cream.  Maybe will try leftovers on something else?

This just wasn't for me.  It seemed I had to add a lot more than one tablespoon of batter to get any kind of flavor at all.  I haven't been back in the freezer to have more since.

Holy moley. Where has this been all my life. I work in a restaurant and we made a double batch in the kitchen after closing last night with Blue Bell ice cream. I can think of so many things this would be amazing with. Over cinnamon roles, over ice cream, with apple cider, in hot water, in my coffee. I could go on and on. This will always be in my freezer. I was surprised to find that it doesn't freeze solid. Maybe because of all the sugar. Is that normal?

While this batter tasted REALLY delicious on its own, it was really watery when made into a hot drink.  I used 3 tbs. batter and added 1 tsp. instant coffee to ~8 oz of hot water and that was pretty good.

I've made this recipe before, but with regular sugar instead of confectioners.  I used confectioners this time and it was just as good (if not better) than I remember it.  I added a little extra spice to my taste.  My spices were a bit old so that certainly could have contributed to the blandness that I experienced.  Once I added it to water the spice really came out anyway.  I made it in advance for Thanksgiving and don't have rum yet, so I used rum extract for flavoring.  It's so amazing!  I'm in heaven right now.  I halved the recipe, but it's still not going to last long.  I used way more batter for my cup than 1T.

This is a great improvement on the recipe I had been using.  I like a creamier drink so I use milk rather than water and just pop it in the microwave to heat. A perfect drink for a cold evening!

This batter is fantastic.  I found adding 3 scoops of batter works best (maybe my mugs are really big).  After reading the reviews, I cut the recipe in half and it has made plenty.  My son really enjoyed it - without the rum, of course.  Thanks for sharing this.

This is great!  Ive never had hot buttered rum before but this batter sounded delicious.  It is so good you can eat the batter by itself with a spoon!  I use about a tablespoon and a half per 6 ounces of water and it comes out nicely!  Of course I did not make the whole recipe.  I made probably about 2 cups of the batter all together because the recipe makes a BUNCH!

This is very good.  I do agree with other reviewers that you want to double the spices so there is still a strong cinnamon/nutmeg flavoring once the mix is added into the beverage.

Sooo yummy! I have never tried Hot Buttered Rum before, but this recipe has me hooked! I also ended up using about 2 tbsp. of batter per cup, and its not overly sweet.

I have a holiday party based on this drink every year.  It's a hit with everyone.  Delicious even without the rum as an alternative to hot cider or hot chocolate.  Tasty!

My husband had this at a friend's house.  He came home raving about the hot buttered rum he had and had his friend's wife give him the recipe.  Well, lo and behold it was this recipe from my favorite website.  I have never liked rum, and even I thought it was good.  I will also be adding it to my hot tea.  It is so sweet, my 5yr old licked the spoon and pot when I was done making it.

OUTSTANDING!  If you're not giving some away as a gift, you may want to cut recipe in half -- it makes a lot.  When you can't get into the rum, it's also really good in green tea.

This was a recipe my grandmother used to make often. It is a winter tradition in my family. Simple to make and the batter stores in the freezer all winter.

This is a family favorite that I've made for the past 14 years. I always keep some in the freezer during the holidays.  We usually use 2 TBSPs of the mixture per cup for a creamier drink.  The adults add rum....and the children drink it without.  Our older daughter often dips a spoon into the mix and eats it as is....it's THAT good.

This turned out great! I made several batches to give as gifts.  Anyone who had it said it was the best hot buttered rum they’d ever had!  FYI for our Christmas party we heated up a crockpot on low with the mixture and water (1 part mixture, 3 parts water) +  add your own rum.  What a hit!  We refilled the crockpot 3 times!

This is the best hot buttered rum batter recipe I've ever come across.  The vanilla ice cream is a great substitute for vanilla extract and makes a nice creamy texture and flavor.  I prefer to make it without the confectioner's sugar, because I prefer my hot buttered rum more spiced and less sweet; I also added allspice and ground clove for the aforementioned reason.  For an awesome twist, we used Captain Morgan Jack-o-Blast; pumpkin spice rum.  This recipe probably made enough to last us for at least six months.  10/10, will definitely make again.

This is so delicious. I’ve made it twice now and it makes a LOT.  Not sure if one tablespoon is really enough for one mug’s worth... maybe if you’re using cider it is... but not with water... or maybe just for me since I like it a little sweeter.  With water I use a LOT more.  This time I used a special our local dairy had for the Xmas season... Eggnog Ice Cream. Since eggnog has a lot of the same spices called for here it is fantastic!!! OMG.  I’d say better than the vanilla. I almost left out the cinnamon and nutmeg but decided to stick it in after all. Could’ve left it out probably since the eggnog ice cream is so flavorful. It is so good. We take a thermos of this snowmobiling to keep us warm. It’s a hit!!  Mixed up and put in the thermos it stays hot for hours. Perfect way to warm up. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This turned out great, although it is very sweet. I don't usually measure ingredients by weight, so used about three cups of each of the sugars. When making it again, I might try to cut down on the sugar.

I've tried a number of buttered rum batters, and this is the best that I've been able to find, period. No need to modify other than number of servings.

Very good and very easy to make.  I used Captain Morgan's spiced rum.  Definitely preferred the drink topped off with hot apple cider (or even hot apple juice) over hot water.

Maybe I should review this in the morning...B-) Amazing! I just told hubby "This is pretty good isn't it?" with a twinkle in his eyes as he looked into his mug, he smiled and simply stated, "I wasn't going to say anything. Didn't want this one to go to your head." That's his way of saying "well done." :-D

OK,  tried this the first time last night and I can't get enough of it!  Definitely double the recipe if using a good sized coffee cup.  I used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and Crem Brule coffee creamer with hot water the first time. I tried it with hot coffee (without the rum) this morning, but now that it's 5:00 "somewhere"...  Love this!!

I was a little worried reading some of the more critical reviews that this was going to be too sweet.  I kept going back and forth over less sugar or more butter but ultimately decided to follow the recipe exactly.  I used cider instead of water, and Capt Morgan's and I loved it.  It wasn't too sweet, had just enough rum to add flavor, but not so much you're gagging on the alcohol taste.  I didn't care for nutmeg sprinkled on top, but I did love a dollop of whipped cream on it.  Tomorrow I plan to try it with water and maybe whipped cream and cinnamon on top!

I tried this exactly how the recipe is written and it was awesome!  Then I made it with bourbon instead of rum and it just got better.  The bourbon seemed to cut the sweetness a bit.

This is amazing, I only make it for the Holidays because it is to tempting to have around. Can't get enough! You need to make it to taste. If it is too sweet just use less batter in the next one.

I read a book where they drank "Hot Buttered Rum" and knew I had to try it. The book had a recipe but of course I don't have the book anymore. So glad I found this recipe. I picked this because of all the great reviews! I just made it and put it in the freezer. Although I haven't tried it yet in a drink, the batter was delicious! Can't wait!! Gotta go buy some spiced rum and apple cider (for the kids)! Thank You!!!

very good...very rich

I put 2 tbsp of batter in a large mug, with a shot of spiced rum, and topped it off with boiling water...the perfect beverage for our tree trimming evening.

I also recommend stirring 1 tsp into a mug of hot milk...really yummy...even without the booze!

Another option : mix a spoonful in with coffee -mmmm

okay, i made this for the first time last winter.  given the harsh winter we had in maryland, i enjoyed it thoroughly....all by myself.  :)  i just made a batch today which i'm sure will last me through the holidays.  it is becoming a tradition and i'm thinking about giving it as gifts this year.  i make it with spiced rum and it's so delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as stated. It's tasty enough but it is not freezing. It remains a pourable consistancy.

This is simply amazing!  I had remembered having a hot buttered rum years ago when I was very sick and decided to give this a try and I just can't say enough good things about it.  I made it just as directed.  Used an 8oz cup so it wouldn't be too watered down.  Put the cool whip on top and sipped it non stop.  Needless to say since I am not a drinker I was in bed almost immediately hehe but everyone should give this a try.  Fantastic holiday drink or just anytime you need something to make you rest comfortably.   Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe!

I made this after all the rave reviews! I thought it was easy but was not wowed by it! I did not like the fact that the mixture sat on the top and had to be stirred after every sip. I made it and put it in the freezer and have not been back to get any. I will not be making this again.. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe yields a LOT of batter!  It would be great to give to neighbors and friends as a gift.  Our guests only drank one mug each during our Christmas party, as it reportedly made everyone sleepy (even though we were careful about the amount of rum added to each serving).  I'd love to try this with amaretto - what a great idea from a past reviewer.

I made a few slight changes to it.  I used Cake Batter Ice Cream instead of Vanilla and I used DiSaronno instead of rum.  Awesome!

I've now sampled my wares and think it was a fabulous decision! I made a 3x batch with the intent to give some away. I used an instant cider pack and a lot of hot water in a big mug with about a shot of spiced rum. I added a bit more rum because I couldn't taste it. I gave up the idea I would "taste" it after I'd added about 2 shots (total). Dangerous stuff! 
I had my husband whisk the sugars into the butter because the butter was floating and . . I'm a wimp. Once it was whipped it was smooth and almost fudge-ish. 
Taking an idea from comments in another HBRum recipe on here, I sprayed some ice cube trays with unflavored oil and am freezing pre-portioned amounts for serving to guests.
I've never made this before, and only had it once. I'm trying to decide who are the people who *must* get these as gifts and how many I can keep!
Update: Don't do the ice-cube tray idea! I've got a gloppy mess!

Good for parties, great for unwinding and taking the chill off. Use apple cider if you have a sweet tooth, use hot water if you don't. Going to go have one more now...

This made a great batter without any changes, but it makes a TON of batter.  Unless you are catering to some serious Hot Buttered Rum drinkers, consider cutting down the recipe.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  For starters, the batter looked completely unappetizing.  It was very lumpy and did not freeze completely.  The lumps seemed to be the powdered sugar... not sure if it should have been sifted.  Then, when we mixed it with the rum, there was a layer of melted butter on the top!   Who wants to drink butter?  I will not be making this again.

This is fabulous!  I emailed this recipe to every person I know. I could eat the batter by itself, it is so good.  As for a hot buttered rum drink, I don't typically like rum at all, but I swoon over this drink.  Highly recommend this recipe.

Oh yum. We made half the recipe. We used one large soup spoon worth of batter and one ounce of rum in our 8oz teacups and didn't quite fill it up all the way with hot water. That seemed about right. Definitely a hit at our dinner party.

I scaled this down to 1/4 of the original recipe and followed it as written.  We thought it tasted better with a couple of tablespoons of the batter, rather than just one.  It is delicious and a wonderful treat on a very cold night!  Thank you, Sheri!

I made half a batch since I didn't have a full pound of butter on hand. It is gooey but to me that's good. This batter makes a very yummy drink. I used to not really like hot buttered rum but now I love it! This one is a keeper, thank you!

I didn't want to make up as much so I used 1/2 cup each butter, brown sugar and icing sugar, 1 cup of ice cream, 1/4 tbsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I used 2 heaping teaspoons of the mix in a mug with 1 oz of rum and 6 oz of water. It had a great taste but I didn't like the appearance. I couldn't get over the color, it was like dirty water. This is fantastic in hot chocolate though, especially with whipped cream on top!

I'm not a hot buttered rum connoisseur, but this was pretty tasty. The difference is that the ratio is too weak, as others have said. Others doubled it, but I quadrupled the amount of batter and rum in the mug. If you want to play it safely, at least try a mug tripled.

We were entertaining a small group and didn’t need the full recipe, so we prepared a half-batch of batter the night before and put it in  freezer overnight.  The next afternoon everything came out tasting great and was a highlight of the party.  We used 2 Tbsp of batter with 1oz of Kraken spiced rum.

This is one of the best hot buttered recipes I've tasted. If you enjoy sipping hot drinks, rum, whiskey or brandy during cold winter months, do yourself a favor and try this. The mixes you buy in the stores don't hold a candle to this yummy, buttery drink recipe.

Oh my! Just made this for the holidays. It is absolutely delicious! I did not use the confectioners sugar as I thought it was perfect without it. Batch #2 in the pot. This time I may put in the confectioners sugar just to see. Anyway, yummy! Can't wait to serve it to family and friends!

Delicious. Unless you're making this for a big group, I suggest quartering the recipe. For a fun twist, add a bit of ground ginger or use cookie butter ice cream instead of vanilla

Good recipe, very sweet though. I Would cut the powdered sugar down by half. Also, no need to melt the butter down. I would cream the butter and sugar and all ingredients together in a mixer, then freeze.

This batter is nothing thing less than amazing!!! The only change I made ,because I didn’t have a choice. was salted Carmel ice- cream for vanilla. I was only going to Aldis and they didn’t have a small container of vanilla. I couldn’t wait to try it until it was frozen so I used 4 TB of batter thinking that if it was frozen the tespoon would be a mounded and not flat!. I hope all my friends are ready to get this for Christmas!!!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I like to use twice the amount of mix in each mug.  Next time, I will make half as much mix.  It makes a lot.  Ok for a party.

I discovered hot buttered rum on a chilly evening in a little bar in Alaska, and instantly loved the rich buttery flavor.  The bartender wouldn’t share the recipe but only would tell me that the batter was made with ice cream.  Well, I did some internet searching while I was still sitting there and found the recipe! I’ve been making it at home in Minnesota ever since!

This recipe is good. I cut out the cup of confectioners sugar, it’s not needed, and I ended up adding a tablespoon of cinnamon and nutmeg instead of a teaspoon of each. I also added a teaspoon of allspice. Delish!

This is delicious! I filled several small mason jars and gave as gifts.  The batter doesn’t freeze solid, so the glass jars are ok in the freezer.

I was looking for a hot buttered mix recipe similar to one I'd made in the past, and this one filled the bill nicely. I did reduce the amount of powdered sugar by about 1/3 and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a great holiday/cool weather drink that warms the cockles of your heart and puts a sweet taste on your lips. (I usually add an extra 1/2 to one ounce of rum per drink or a splash of butterscotch schnapps for good measure!)

This is a great batter but!! Measurements of sugar needs to be in cups not pounds and when preparing use 2-1 measurements of milk to water- so
Much richer as I substituted heavy cream
For ice cream on 2nd batch

Good, but you need to triple the mix and rum in a drink to make it taste right, wimpy and bland otherwise.

Sent the recipe to my Mom who made it ahead of my visit back East. Fantastic!! Creamy and yummy. Just used a white rum. Went down sooooo easy. Just realized we forgot the nutmeg but will add it next time. Will make a batch of my own soon. Recommended!

Great holiday drink! I like to add 3 big spoonfuls of batter per mug and a little bit more rum.

This was horrible! It wasn't creamy at all. I was very disappointed.  Very expensive to make too.

The batter recipe is good as is.  I would give it five stars with a few changes: When preparing the drink per the instructions it is a bit weak.  I would either add less water or  add a full shot of rum (1.5oz) and almost double the batter called for.  I also prefer it with a bit more spices but that is a personal preference.  I will definitely make this again although the recipe makes a TON and I won't need to until next year! :-)

Love this recipe! It's very versatile and can be used as a drink or a topping. My husband enjoys adding scotch while I enjoy white rum.  Delicious for cold winter nights!

I had this recipe a long time ago and was thrilled to find it here again! Absolutely THE BEST HB Rum recipe on the planet!! Very rich and creamy and I used Myer's Original Dark Rum with it. I did use 1.5 qt of vanilla bean ice cream because of all the sugar. Just depends on your taste....Love Love Love this!

This is my families all time favorite during the holidays!  It's so fluffy and creamy when the hot water and spiced rum is added....leaves a little cloud of fluffiness floating atop the mug.

I don't care about how "authentic" this recipe might be... it's delicious! I make 1/4 batch at a time to keep in the freezer through winter, and make 1/2 batch to break it out  at get-togethers.

I didn't make any changes in the recipe but I did and 2 - 3X the amount in my drink.  I like a Hot buttered rum creamy and sweet.  YUMMMM  I love that I don't always have to add rum to it. Sometimes I just add hot water to the mix... YUMM

A creamy,  hearty,  sweet warm beverage,  that you can customize by adding more or less batter to your mug.

DELICIOUS!!!! Honestly, I have eaten it right off the spoon ;)  Store the extra in 1 or 2 cup freezer containers to give as gifts!  I have used this recipe for a few years, but now that I am diabetic  I am going to try to tweak it using SPLENDA, SPLENDA Brown Sugar and BREYER'S CARB SMART ice cream!

I've been using store bought rum batter for years.  First time making my own.  I can't imagine this being any better.  This is the perfect rum batter.  I've used it with Captain Morgans, Mount Gay XO, and in my Starbucks Christmas blend coffee.  Delicious!

Oh my gosh. This is the most delicious hot drink!! The only change I made was to decrease the nutmeg, but that is purely personal preference. I also use 2 Tbsp of mix to the 1 cup water and 1 for oz of spiced rum. Delicious!!!

I've made this several times now, and it's amazing every time.  As written, it's fabulous.  My second batch I used eggnog ice cream instead of vanilla, and it was even better.  I just made another batch where I cut out the step of softening the ice cream by just using a carton of eggnog in place of the ice cream.  Even more amazing.  Definitely make it as written the first time as a baseline, but then there's lots of room to experiment.  If you find the final drink too sweet, just use a little less batter next time.  Also, I prefer dark rum to spiced.  I make my hot buttered rum with Kraken and it's like heaven in a mug.

I really like this recipe, although I did change a few things. First I added more nutmeg, and also added cloves, which the recipe doesn't call for, and cut the powdered sugar in half. So delicious, basically Christmas Happiness in a cup.

Very good. Much easier and more convenient than the one I used to make in the slow-cooker. Being able to make on-demand is important for preserving the alcohol and rum taste, as compared with having a prepared bowl already heated.

This is a big hit for the holidays. I have found that using unsalted butter and fresh nutmeg makes or breaks the recipe. An acquaintance was impressed and asked for the recipe, but was disappointed. The only difference I could tell was that she used salted butter. This year I was using the remnants of a former years nutmeg, and that decreased the fragrant aroma. It is great in coffee as well!

A friend gave me this same recipe but she does 2tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg. I didn't have ice cream but I had vanilla bean frozen yogurt and it was wonderful. I used blue bunny brand with the green lid NOT the pink lid. And used Bacardi "oakheart" spiced rum!! Worth the calories!!!!

Boy, is this good stuff!  I've never had anything like this, but it was highly recommended by gammaray (= a fellow buzzer.  I halved the recipe and tried it with half the rum amount and totally without the rum.  I really like it best without the rum.  What a wonderful way to warm up on a chilly night.  The mixture doesn't completely freeze, so it is very easy to serve.  With half a recipe, I got two full 1 pound containers.

I am so very late with my review of this recipe. It should be ten stars because it was as uber delicious hit at our cookie exchange party last year. This year my plan, because there was so much left over last year I will be putting this in small containers and giving this away to guests for their later enjoyment.

Have already had requests for this as holiday gifts this year.  Guess that means they liked it last year.  I up the spices and add ginger because it makes me happy.  All in all it's a winner.

This is a yearly drink at our Christmas gathering.I like the way it keeps in the freezer for those nights you want to cozy up with a delicious hot drink. SOOOO GOOD!

This was good, but made a lot - I would only make 1/4 batch at a time, if that.  Also, it was hard to mix in the sugars - I ended up with a lot of lumps.  Also good served with coffee or apple cider instead of water.

This is amazing! We love to light a fire, make a hot buttered rum and put on It's a Wonderful Life. Children and teetotalers love it in hot apple cider and hot chocolate. The only danger is eating spoonfuls of it when I am making it! I add a little extra cinnamon, but that is because I love cinnamon so much.

As other reviewers stated, this recipe makes A LOT!  That's okay with me, because it's so good!  Children and non-drinkers can enjoy this without the rum.  Also, you can add the batter to your morning coffee for a treat.  I use two tablespoons of batter (sometimes three) per 8 ounces of boiling water.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

Tried this for the first time last year; and all I can say is WOW!! Quickly became a little too popular for us -- we were addicted. Nothing like it on a cold night!  We do add about 2 Tablespoons of batter to a cup, though. And as for it lasting in the freezer 3 months...no, it never made it even close- we polished it off much quicker than that! Just glad its that season again so I can make more!!

I like to make this right before Thanksgiving and use it all winter. The first time I had it I used regular rum, it was good but the spiced rum is a lot better. This is also great topped with French Vanilla Cool Whip, I hope it is back in the stores this Holiday season.

Smooth and creamier than a standard Hot Buttered Rum, especially when topped with the whip cream that one reviewer suggested.  Excellent with Capt Morgan Spiced rum.  Gives it the extra spice it misses otherwise.

I LOVE this batter. I make sure to have it in the freezer during the fall and winter months.  We use it with rum, apple cider, butterscotch schnapps (my personal favorite) and coffee.  DELICIOUS!

Wonderful but I put in double the amount of the batter into my cup. This taste great when made with the european butter and if you mix milk or cream into the hot water, makes it richer. It is very good as is though.

Nice and easy.  I actually found a Dryer's brand icecream that was Pumpkin Pie flavored, and it was perfect for this application!  But, the vanilla is wonderful, too.

Loved this.  Forgot the cinnamon and nutmeg and it was still great.  Used 2 tablespoons and filled with water in a coffee mug (with a shot of rum).  Also used 2 TBSP with a cup of coffee and tasted like a caramel coffee.

I cut the recipe in half since I knew I would be the only one eating/drinking it.  I don't measure I just scoop in two or three big spoonfuls of batter into my mug, add boiling water and it is delicious!

For a holiday dinner party, I cut the recipe in half and used lowfat ice cream. My guests tried it with Bacardi and with very dark rum as well as in coffee and loved it.  I'll make it again next year.

I took the advice of others and used spiced cider.  It was a great drink for a gathering since is can be made with or without the rum.  It tastes great both ways.

Absolutely delicious! This was my first time to have anything like this and I love it! I use way more than a tablespoon in each drink, more like 3! It's best with Capt. Morgan spiced rum, but I ran out and used whiskey in place, still good! Thanks for the great recipe.

Oh my gosh!!!!!! I made this and took it as a hostess gift to a party.  She now hates me because it is soooo GOOD that she ate most of it herself with a spoon!  I have used it as a topping on almost everything from hot BROWNIES to muffins- and as the drink mixer!  Evil in your freezer!  :-P

Oh. My. Goodness. This is the best stuff EVER. Never having made hot buttered rum batter before, I wasn't sure what to expect. This was amazing! I gave it out to a few friends and family at Christmas. My mom ate it with a spoon out of the bowl. I didnt make any changes to it at all.

I loved this recipe- particularly with hot apple cider and a little of the Captain's rum!  My guests enjoyed it as well!

I once swapped this recipe to a bartender in Snowmass Colorado in exchange for free drinks in his bar for a week.  This is the best!  The batter will keep indefinitely if frozen.

This was SO yummy.  We made it in the middle of an ice storm and it simply hit the spot.  Tastes great with or without the rum, too!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Super!!! I halved the recipe to try it and loved it.  The 2nd time around I added about 1/2 tsp. of coffee granules to each mug and topped it off with canned whipped topping.  So smooth.

Fantastic!! Made it exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out great. I put one big spoonful of the batter, one shot of Captain Moran's spiced rum, and then just topped off with boiling water. My friend who's pregnant had it without the rum and still had thirds!! Great recipe!

This is wonderful with Capt Morgan's spiced rum or Meyers rum.  I also loved it in my coffee!  Heck, it was even delicious with just a spoon!  I guess I should mention that my husband wasn't a big fan though--ah well, I loved it!!

When I read the recipe I wasn't sure what to expect.  But I wanted to try something different to bring to a holiday lunch.  I cut the recipe in half and then froze it in 2 small plastic containers - enough for 2 holiday parties.  The drink was delicious!  Very creamy but not too buttery, just the right amount of spice.  My husband, who told me he hated hot buttered rums, even said they were good!

I made this mix twice, the first time I did have the issues with the batter being messy and the drink looking slightly murky, but it still tasted wonderful. The second time I made it I used the whole 1.75 quarts of ice cream and I served it in a gravy boat. It was wonderful and the hit of my work holiday party. I had to convince my coworkers not to eat it straight.

This was great! I scaled the recipe down to about 10 servings and, while it didn't cover 10 drinks, meant that I had no leftovers and had to make it AGAIN lol. Was wonderful, highly recommended.

Mmmmm....never had Hot Buttered Rum before and this was outstanding.  All the guests raved about it! (would be good batter for coffee too, I'm sure).

This was awesome! I forgot the powdered sugar and it was still GREAT! We used three teaspoons per glass and added a dollop of cool whip with a pinch of nutmeg to the top. The other reviewers are RIGHT, this is great with or without the rum! Thanks for the recipe!

Happy Thanksgiving!!

I had never even tasted Hot Buttered Rum before I made this, let alone tried it.  
While it was really different than what I was expecting, I LOVED it!! 
This was a perfect drink to have on a cold autum night and I definitely will be sharing this recipe.  
Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe! Super easy and lasts in the freezer for months. I usually use a little more batter per drink than called for in the recipe, but I have a bit of a sweet tooth.
