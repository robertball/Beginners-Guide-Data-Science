This recipe is much too large to be prepared in a standard size microwave oven.  I made the full batch in my slow cooker, and it was filled to the brim.  It was OK, though the taste of processed cheese was heavier than I tend to prefer.

I used 3 bunches of fresh broccoli and I added bacon.  I thought it was pretty good although not good enough to eat again the next day.  The recipe made more than I thought it would.  I might make this again but I will probably try a different recipe first.
