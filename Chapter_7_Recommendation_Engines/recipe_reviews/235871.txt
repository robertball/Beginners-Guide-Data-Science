Loved it (and so did my housemates)! I added a little Worcester sauce and doubled the liquids only because I like my stews a little 'saucier'. Will be making this again for sure!

OMG !! My wife and I awarded this the best stew ever!  OK we're biased towards tomatoes, garlic, and WINE! 

I prefer to sauté the veggies Iin a little added wine?) before placing into the the crock pot for added flavor.   As the author mentioned, amounts are vague, but who cares.   Load it with your favorites., and enjoy.   I seem to remember slow cooking for close to 8 hours.   Al I can say is yummy and filling.  Can't wait to make it again..

This was easy & tasty.  I used a better cut of meat & more beef broth than called for but otherwise followed the recipe.  Stew is one of my favorite meals.  Hubby prefers it served with white rice but I opted for the suggested  egg noodles & he enjoyed it.  Cooked on high for an hour & then low for 6.  Was even better the following night.

Made this recipe as is but it still needs something sauce seems bland.
The vegetables and beef cook well on low 4-6 hours on low depending on hot your slow cooker runs.  Would make again but would also try adding the onion soup and some more seasonings.

I changed a few things, added extra beef broth, wine and also added a little water and a bullion cube to make more liquid. After it was done I put it in a big pot and added water and cornstarch to thicken sauce and served over egg noodles. Will DEFINITELY make again. My husband said its the best thing I've ever made in the crock pot!

Didn't like it. I followed the exact directions, but luckily I was home to taste it and was able to salvage my stew before dinner time by adding a bunch of stuff (more beef broth, onion soup mix, pepper, and worcester sauce).

Supremely undercooked using the recipe as directed. Probably tasty, otherwise. Will try again but adjust cooking temp/times.

This is a good stew. I added a few extra spices, let it cook on low for 8 hours. We enjoyed the hardiness of the meal. Great on a cold winter day!

Great recipe!! Easy to adjust or tweak as you'd like. We like a little more broth so I just increased seasoning. Will make again!!

I made this and my husband really liked it but I have to say that I made quite a few changes.  I did not have tomato paste, so I looked in on another Italian beef stew recipe on this site and added tomato sauce instead.  Then I added some basil, more wine, more beef stock, some chopped tomatoes, some rosemary.  I meant to use all the recipe as is but when I didn’t have one, it turned into something else altogether.  Still was delicious.

This recipe turned out perfectly delicious!  The only change I made was to substitute more beef stock for the red wine.

I used this recipe and made stew for the first time. I wasn't impressed. It needs for flavor.
