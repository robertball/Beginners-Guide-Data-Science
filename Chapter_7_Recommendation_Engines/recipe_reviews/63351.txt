Great stuff. I have two lavender plants (one silver frost lavender and one munstead lavender) and I was trying to figure out what to use them with. I tried this recipe with the Munstead lavender. Having great respect for the power of herbs, I only used two sprigs per chicken part. Thank you for such an easy but tasty recipe :o)

Thanks for the recipe, Angel, but dried lavender is almost impossible to find in our area, to say nothing of fresh lavender.  The recipe is just ok with the dried lavender.  I'll keep searching.

The cheese really doesn't add anything to this recipe, at least as written as a topping. Make a cheese sauce if you want to perk it up. I'm fortunate to live near a lavender farm. Make sure all lavender that is used in cooking has not had pesticides or chemicals put on it. Make sure it is labeled good for use in foods or in some way is mentioned that it is food safe. Not all lavender is safe. Lavender is also cook for throwing on the grill with some lamb chops.
This recipe is a good use of it. Tasty.

made this dish as written for 4 children ages 11 yrs to 15 years and they ate every bit. the next time I make this recipe, I might try using fresh sage leaves instead of the lavender, as I think chicken and sage are a great match.

Initially I wasn't quite sure how this would turn out (being new to using lavender in cooking) but I searched the grocery store for lavender and I found dried lavender. Wish I could have used fresh but I still tried it with the dry and it turned out fantastic. Definitely a recipe i will share and I will use again. The only thing I did differently was not add the cheese. It was still great without it.

Tried this to use lavender I grew this year. We found that the bacon didn't get crispy enough for our tastes, so we tried again with precooked and it was quite good. Got 3 out of 4 thumbs up. My hubby just didn't like the taste of the lavender.

This was my first time using lavender in a savory dish.  We didn’t really like it.  I think I’ll keep lavender for the sweet recipes.

Yum! Great combo of flavors! Next time I'll be pounding the chicken thin and rolling it with the bacon, lavender and cheese. I also probably wouldn't use cheddar cheese again, more likely swiss or another white cheese. Overall the idea behind this is great and I'm excited to try it again especially with a lavender plant about to bloom outside my front door!
