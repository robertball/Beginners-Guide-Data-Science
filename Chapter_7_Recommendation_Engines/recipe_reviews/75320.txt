I am the original submitter of this recipe.  I feel compelled to write this review after reading the last couple reviews.  Some have said that it takes at least four hours to get the chutney to a thick consistency.  When I first made this recipe, I also felt that it was a little thin, but I went ahead and processed it anyways.  When the chutney had cooled off after processing it was quite a bit thicker.  I still only cook the chutney for 1 1/2 hours.  I also wanted to note that the recipe says that it takes 8 hours for prep.  That is an error that all recipes made when printing the recipe.  It doesn't really take much more than 30 minutes to do the prep work.

This is an excellent recipe, but several items should be noted: the prep time is NOT 8 hrs. 3 - 4 Hours is realistic, including canning time.

I added 1/4 c fresh finely chopped jalapenos to add a little spice. The chili powder did not add enough heat for my taste.  I also added 1/2 bulb of garlic instead of just a few cloves.  I found it difficult to find preserved ginger, so I used crystalized ginger in the same portions. Easy to make and has been such a delight for my entire family - including extended family - that I made a 2nd batch. I doubled the recipe to use as gifts later this year.  Thank you for the nice recipe.

I have been making this same recipe for about 40 years now (I've lost track of the number of batches).  A couple of things I have learned:  1.  Mix all ingredients in a large bowel, cover with a dish cloth and let sit overnight - the flavor becomes deeper 2. Cook time for thickness will vary based on the ripeness of the peaches. I usually cook 2 hours... and as suggested when my patience is not there or time does not allow, a little pectin goes a long way. 3. Roasted garlic if you have time adds a slightly more robust taste.  This is a standard in my house with grilled meats and salmon.

Very, very good!  The house smelled wonderful while the chutney was cooking and my guests and I enjoyed the finished product.  This chutney would be good with pork, chicken, fish - I served mine alongside cornbread with a barbecue meal.  I halved the recipe, and it yielded exactly 3 cups.

I really liked this recipe. I thought I would share my notes on how I made it this year using Pomona's Pectin to speed the cooking process and so I can make it again next year. Thanks Shana for posting such a great recipe. Spicy Peach Chutney  4 pounds sliced peeled peaches 1 cup raisins (I used golden) 2 cloves garlic, minced (I used a little less and added about ½ Tablespoon of salt while mincing) 1/2 cup chopped onion 5 ounces chopped preserved ginger ( I am going to try grated peeled fresh next time) 1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder (cayenne) 1 tablespoon mustard seed 1 teaspoon curry powder 4 cups packed brown sugar (possibly dark brown due to use of 1/3 white sugar) 4 cups apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup pickling spice (Tampico smells better than Mojave brand to me)  MODIFICATIONS TO ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS TO USE POMONAS PECTIN:   (The advantage to this is reduced cooking time and better control over jelling)  Boil 2/3 of brown sugar, vinegar, spice packet, and can add onions and garlic now or after 10—15 minutes depending on texture desired. Boil until reduced by 1/3 to ½ over high heat should reduce into a syrup. About 1 minute prior to adding peaches add rest of spices. I used cayenne pepper for heat instead of chili powder and mix. Add peaches and calcium water as per recipe for peach jam for volume you are making using hot method on Pomona’s pectin box recipe insert.Take 1/3 sugar(white) and mix pectin very well with hand into sugar

If it looks like soup or a sauce, don't panic!  CHEAT! ;) You can still save your time and money you invested.  Just add some gelatin and/or pectin.  You can find it in any large grocery store in the baking isle and it only costs a couple of dollars.  One box should do it. It will vary depending on how long you have cooked down the chutney.  I wished I didn't leave mine on the stove simmering while I went to the store. I would have liked it more fresh than dark brown Also, I would slice the peaches a good centimeter in thickness and cut the segment in half.  Because when you cook down the chutney, you want some peach substance left over.  Once you have added the pectin, you won't notice the set until you have cooled the chutney down.  Anyways, it may not be te conventional way, and I'm not too sure it changed how the original recipe's was suppose to taste, but it shouldn't have and worked and tasted great!  I just gave it a stir after I cooled it down in the fridge and I got nice thick chutney suitable for Indian Royalty. If you're looking for something a bit different then this is the one.  There is no doubt that when you serve this to your guests, that it's homemade, cause you can't buy something like this in the store. But make sure you have fun with the recipe and play with it..make it your own, if you love onions, add more onions. That's the fun of cooking, and if you're like me, it's never the same the next time around.

This is a great chutney, with just a touch of heat.  My family loved it with a curry dish.

This recipe took a loooong time.  I know chutney and it took  four hours for this to get to the right consistency.  However, it did turn out great, so if you have the time, this is a good recipe.

Shana, I modified this recipe. My husband cannot stand the smell of garlic.  So I did not use garlic or onions.  I used only two cups of brown sugar. I used a teaspoon of cinnamon,and turmeric. one tablespoon of my own curry powder that contains sesame seeds, flax sseds, urud and channa dhal,fennel, cumin, coriander red chilli pepper, black pepper etc.  My peaches are from my tree. One helpful suggestion regarding peeling Peaches-- Blanching.  Soak the peahes in boiling water for five minutes, drain, cool and then peel. I also sterilize bottles in a pressure cooker. I am a microbiologist, sterilizing with steam under pressure is the best technique of sterilizing.

It actually took me 4 hours to cook this down to the desired "proper" chutney consistency.  The taste is great, but I am not sure that others are sure how thick chutney is supposed to be.

Really good.  Hubby brought back 2 pecks peaches from his trip to SC that were delicious but too many to eat.  Made this and modified the recipe slightly to accommodate a low sugar need.  Used 2 cups of splenda/brown sugar mix in place of all brown sugar.  Also had a bag of dried tart cherries in pantry didn't know what to do with so I added them.  This turned out soooo good.  I ended up with 9- half pints.  I used 4 lbs of sliced peaches, not 4 pounds of peaches sliced.  Could be the difference.   Next time I might add some dried apricot - he's in S. Carolina again and it's still peach season!!

This adds way to much liquid.  No amount of cooking will reduce this to the semi-paste consistency of good chutney which is just slightly thinner than marmalade.  I've been simmering for nine hours and I still have soup.

First, I made this as stated, except cooking time was more like 2h10m to get a proper thickness.  Those who claim to have had to cook for hours upon hours must've used more than 4lbs of peaches.  I didn't want to add pectin as gelatinous chutney seems wrong to me, though many reviewers seem to think that's an OK thing to do.  The vinegar settles down nicely after processing and cooling.  Only change I might make is to add a touch more curry and chili powder.  Looking forward to trying this will grilled salmon, pork, and/or chicken.  I got 7x 250ml (half pint) jars out of this.

fabulous chutney recipe! i had peaches from my tree to use up and this was perfect! i made it just as it was written, except i used golden raisins, and crystallized ginger (couldn't find any preserved). i simmered it for a little longer than 1 1/2 hours only because my canning jars needed a little longer to sterilize ;)  turned out wonderfully though, my mum loves chutney (british and used to good indian food) and she raved and asked for another jar. makes a great gift. thanks for the recipe!

Love this, became a quick favorite of mine and many friends.  I double the recipe to have some on hand as easy hostess gifts.  I felt the highest compliment I got for this came from my brother-in-law, who said he finally tried it after it sat for months on the shelf and then he ate the whole 1/2 pint with a spoon!

I gave this chutney as Christmas gifts for 2009 and kept a couple of jars for myself.  I just loved it and am going to make it again tomorrow (just for moi!)  The way I ended up using it the most was with goat cheese and crackers AND...mixing 1/2 Vegenaise and 1/2 chutney to use on my Boca Burgers (I'm certain that this would be just as awesome tasting using real mayo and real burgers)  Yum yum...Can hardly wait for tomorrow :)

This is a beautiful recipe. Better than any chutney you buy in the store. This mellows and becomes wonderful with age so leave it at least a month before eating. Thanks for sharing!!

The spices are fine but the result is too "vinegary" and liquid after 2.5 hours cooking.  I decided to recook the pints for another hour with an additional 2 cups of cut-up peaches.  The result is much improved with preaches that look like peaches, not brown sludge.  So,  increase cooking time, add more peaches at the end so they don't dissolve, and recipe is great.

I'm usually generous on my ratings but this was a total bust.  There was no peach flavor...far too much vinegar and the mustard seed in the finished product is a complete distraction..

By the time time sauce had cooked down to a relish consistency, the original peaches had been converted to mush. I added 10 more chopped peaches (about 3 pounds) and 3 more cloves of garlic to brighten up the flavors & visual appeal.

I am not used to chutneys, and my curries are very mild. That being said, this stuff is like manna from heaven. Fantastic stuff! I made enough for my wife and I to have with dinner so I cut this recipe way back. Only using one peach and I used fresh ginger, I did not have any preserved ginger sitting around. I gave it 5 stars as I thought it was great stuff. I will be making a larger batch, but almost hate to as the fresh was so good I can't see the canned being as good. Thanks for posting it.

Thanks for the recipe! I really like the flavor of this chutney, but found it to be much too acidic for my liking.  I ended up adding more peaches and some roasted red peppers to try to cut the acidity of the vinegar.  After checking out many ginger-peach jam recipes, I think I can safely cut the vinegar down by at least half next time.  This first batch made ~ 11 half-pints, and that includes adding an extra pound or so of peaches.

It turned out great and with only one hour cooking time, probably because I only made one quarter (24 servings). I also and let the mixture sit over night before i cooked it, used two bird eye hot pepper, a little less brown sugar and a little more curry powder. It tastes excellent and the texture is perfect.

I made this recipe as written. Delicious. The sweet fruit, sugar and vinegar is perfectly balanced and a surprise in the mouth. Many layers of flavors. Oh, the one thing I did change was I couldn't find my cheesecloth so I used tea balls for the pickling spice.

This was unedible. The amount of vinegar in this is absolutely disgusting. 1/2 cup is more like it. 4 cups is disgusting. Wasted a whole triple batch of the recipe. My mistake for not testing it first I guess.

Really delicious! I also added a little more garlic and used fresh ginger because I didn't have any of the preserved stuff - and I added a few cardamons (because I like the taste). A great way of using up excess peaches when there is a glut. Thank you fro sharing this.

Excellent recipe.  This chutney is great with curries, cheese, cold meats - very tasty.  Like some other reviewers, I had a problem when reducing the mixture to the right consistency - took about 3 hours eventually, but well worth the wait.

Flavor wise this is/was amazing!!!  Sadly, I should have believed the other reviewers.  I even read through and found the note from the author.  This also is NOT my first time making or canning a chutney.   After 2 hours I had a thin soupy mixture.  Nothing worth canning.  So boiled it away for nearly 4 MORE hours to get it to have any sort of thickness.  Then it was nearly 9pm so I caved and added some pectin as others suggested.  ::sigh::  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't!  Thank you for the fun flavors!

Regardless on how you manage this, it is a good chutney to use as an accompaniment to many dishes.  I had to fudge some of the ingredients, but a chutney is basically sweet and sour with spice.  If you have those components, you can't go wrong. I used 5 yellow peaches with skin on that were turning, chunked versus diced, and I used fresh ginger. I also added some crushed allspice berries.

I halved the ingredients but followed the recipe almost exactly otherwise and it turned out wonderfully.    It's very thick after 1.5 hours cooking on medium heat in a wide pot.  Flavor is great. Can't wait to have it for dinner tonight with poached fish and rice!

Just made this recipe for the third day time.  Beautiful flavours and delightfully spicy.  Not sure why there is reference to a 10 hour total time.  Prep is under an hour and the 1.5 hour cooking time is bang on to achieve the right consistency.

Did look at other recipes for this at the same time and notice that the apple cider vinegar seemed a lot.  But decide to give it a go. Trust you gut it was way too much and the constancy  was way too running. My mum said on Face Time why waste peaches but I do love a good chutney. Had to improve on this to actually get what resembles a chutney.

I spent a while reading through peoples’ comments, before finally consulting my mother who is known for her chutney. 
The difference, (and I see that many people made similar changes), is that the quantities of sugar, vinegar and spices correlate with mom’s recipe, BUT...
Her recipe calls for 7 (seven!) pounds of peaches, plus 6 red onions, plus two pounds of raisins. 
This explains the comments that people’s allrecipes chutney was too sweet or vinagery. 
So, add more fruit!

Loved the vinegary/picklely (?) taste with the peaches. I would, however, cut back on the brown sugar. Maybe 3 or 3 1/2 cups instead of 4? It's sweet in the pot. Perhaps, it will taste less sweet when pairing with cream cheese and crusty bread!
I also left the skins on the peaches and then mashed them up after an hour into the cooking process. I was a little busy making several types of jams in one day. I think next time, I will still leave the skins on but cut up the peach slices smaller. It might be hard to spread the chutney with larger sliced peach skins in it.

This is an incredible base for a peach chutney. To hit more Savory than sweet, I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/2, added 1/4 cup of minced garlic,  1/4 cup bourbon smoked paprika and used about 2T minced ginger (Christopher Bros in a jar) instead of candied ginger.  Thanks for sharing Shana, it is a favorite with my neighbors (tasters) so I am sure my family and friends will appreciate it in their Christmas Gift Baskets!

This recipe is fabulous but here's what I did to make it better: Use Golden Raisins, use about 1/4 cup minced fresh Ginger and 1/8 cup minced Crystallized Ginger, increase the onion to one whole, add one large, diced Yellow Bell Pepper, increase the curry to one Tablespoon, add 1 teaspoon Red Pepper Flakes and 1 teaspoon Turmeric, and finally, REDUCE THE VINEGAR BY HALF TO 2 CUPS. The sauce cooks down to a beautiful consistency in 2 hours and is still very well balanced in flavor with the reduced amount of vinegar.

I doubled the batch so cooking time was considerably longer. Also used a combination of fresh and preserved ginger. In Addition, I used fresh and dried hot peppers to replace the chili powder. Overall a very nice product!

Excellent recipe, tastes just like the Indian chutney's I love and miss. I used Sultana's instead of raisins as that's what I had in my cupboard. The peaches I used had beautiful red flesh which I also mixed with peacharines (my friend has an abundance of both in her garden). I'm having to make another batch (or 2) tomorrow as my friends have taken all of the ones I cooked! Thanks for the recipe.

The only thing I changed on this recipe is I used about 6 oz of candied ginger (the recipe calls for preserved).  Absolutely perfect.  
I warm some french bread with brie and top it with this chutney.  To die for.

The chutney came out VERY runny. I even reduced it for much longer than the recipe called for I would probably use less vinegar, as it came out very vinegary(and I like vinegar). Also, next time I think I'll skip the raisins.

At first, I thought there was way too much sugar and vinegar for the amount of peaches I was putting into the pot. After cooking this down to a desired consistency, I was then sure that there was way too much sugar and vinegar for my taste. It's so sticky sweet and sour my teeth scream just smelling it. I'd love to try this again with a quarter the amount of sgr and about a third as much vin.
