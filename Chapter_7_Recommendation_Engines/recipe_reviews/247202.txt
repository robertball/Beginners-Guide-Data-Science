FABULOUS!  Nice and fluffy, excellent flavor, easy technique.  But the 1-1/2 cups water was too much!  I was mixing it with my 5yo and ended up with about 1-1/4 cups water added when I realized this was not going as planned; I fixed my error by adding flour 1/4 cup at a time until it was dry enough to knead.  I've seen other recipes with just water or just milk.  This has just a slight sweetness from the lactose that was perfect for my fry bread PIZZA.  (Move over tacos!!)  Add pizza sauce and toppings like mozzarella, spinach, diced onions, diced tomatoes, and top with more mozzarella.  Stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds to melt the cheese and cut into quarters or fold in half like a taco for hand-held gooey goodness.  My picky 5yo hated it, my adventurous 3yo loved it onions and all.

I made this with less than a cup of water. The rest time was about 20 minutes. Cooking the fry bread to a light brown gave me a tender product. It was great!

This is a generous three stars because the ingredient ratios are off. The water was too much! I ended up having to add more flour and extra baking soda to adjust for the liquid. That said, it was tender, but not as tender as a yeast based fry bread. I served with taco seasoned ground turkey, chili beans, lettuce, salsa, cheese and sour cream.

Yummy! Served this with cinnamon sugar after brushing with butter, better than some of the elephant ear recipes I've tried.
