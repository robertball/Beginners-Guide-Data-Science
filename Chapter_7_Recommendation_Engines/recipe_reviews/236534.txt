This was so good!  I doubled the tomatoes (I only had a large can on hand) and added a half can more of coconut milk (using up leftovers) so it had more of a soup consistency, but served over rice on day 1 and ate as a soup for lunch on day 2 (pictured).  It was a hit with the entire family.  Delicious!

I did not add cayenne, because of picky kids, but it would have been best that way. Perhaps just a touch simple for a curry (meaning not as complex-tasting), but for a weeknight supper, this is great.

I followed the recipe exactly as written (though my paprika is Penzey's Smoked Spanish Paprika).  It was DELICIOUS.  I'm a Chana Masala fanatic, and this is one of the better ones I've eaten.  It was also very easy prep, cooking, and cleanup.  The family loved it too.  This will be going into regular rotation at my house.

This was a fabulously delicious and simple recipe! I followed it precisely the first time and the second time I added yams. Both times I used coconut oil, as I no longer use any vegetable oils due to pervasive, hidden GMO's in most of them.

I made this dish today and it's a winner!! The only thing that I added was sugar. I add sugar to any dish that I make that has a tomato base. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious! I put in only 1/2 the cayenne pepper, and it was still plenty spicy, but just right for my family. To make it healthier and satisfy my nutrition major daughter, in the beginning I used 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 tablespoons vegetable broth to sauté the onions. No need for the vegetable oil! I didn't have the coconut milk on hand, so I used 1 cup of coconut water and 1 cup of almond milk (I'm sure soy milk will also do). It was watery at first, so if you like it thicker like we do, either add only half the liquid at the end, or reduce it down like I did. I boiled it for a good additional 20 minutes and it was thicker, then I took out a cup of the mixture and blended it separately with my immersion blender. I put the blended mixture back in the pot and stirred it in. No need for extra salt (and my canned diced tomatoes didn't have added salt either). For my family, I would say this dish can be "Ready in 1 hour." Served it with naan and got compliments from everyone.

Easily adaptable to another protein I made half with chicken and half chickpea. The only real change I made was adding some fenugreek powder and maybe simmering it a little longer. Definitely my go to Indian recipe now.

I agree with others that the taste can be a bit bland, but once you add in the salt (to taste), it really brings out the rest of the flavors.  I think next time I will cut back on the coconut milk and water, see if that brings out the flavor a bit more.  I omitted the cayenne pepper (since I can't have hot-spicy food) and I thought it still worked out great.  Overall a good decent recipe that I'd try again.

This dish was very good.  I can not attest to its authenticity but the flavor is delicious.  Just the right amount of heat in the back of the throat.  Added bonus, it was incredibly easy to make and quick.  I was trying to eat more vegetarian and thought I'd try Indian.  Luckily this recipe didn't have any unusual spices, so I had them all on-hand. Even my husband, a dedicated carnivore, enjoyed this meal. I served it with Naan bread and will make it exactly the same next time.

I thought it was good and would definitely make it again. I added quite a bit of corn to it, I doubled the spices it called for, I added garam masala. I used 1 can of chick peas and I can o black beans because that is what I had. I didn't use salt and I used a lot of pepper. I served it with quinoa and a simple kale salad and we made burritos with it. Everyone enjoyed it a lot. No complaints. Plenty of leftovers.

This was a huge hit in my  “reluctant to try new meals” house! I followed the recipe exactly for spices measurements.  The changes I made : Added a few more onions since the ones I had on hand were small, a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, and skim milk since I didn’t have coconut milk. Delicious! Next time I’ll definitely try it with the coconut milk because I can see how it will add that great flavor and make this a vegan dish. Will definitely makes this again!

Turned out great. I think the can coconut cream/milk is a key ingredient. I was heavy handed on all the spices (except cinnamon), because I like a lot of flavor and I tend to use old spices that have been sitting around for a while. I also used fresh ginger instead of ground ginger (added it when the garlic is added to the onion sauté). Also reduced the finished product bc I had time to kill and to thicken. Quite lovely.

This is so flavourful and aromatic. My husband enjoyed this so much that one time he took it into work to share with some of his co-workers. They couldn't believe I made it and thought it came from a restaurant. The spice blend is perfect just the way it is. Sometimes, within the last few minutes of cooking, I throw in some fresh baby spinach if I have it on hand. It adds a beautiful colour. I serve it over Basmati rice.

This was delicious! I used the recipe more as a base. I've made a few masala dishes before and to this I added a pinch garam masala and a bit of curry and extra cayenne. I just love curry so I wanted that flavor. I also used fire roasted tomatoes and smoked curry, which really gives is that depth people say was missing! And, I cooked it all together much longer for the flavor to penetrate the chickpeas!

Lacked a depth of flavour. Had to add other spices to get it to taste okay.

This was quite runny and we had to cook an additional 20 min. The blend of spices had too much coriander for my liking (probably would half it).  Added cinnamon and cumin, which helped, but still the flavor was weird.

Outstanding. I used a large can of diced tomatoes, as that was all I had on hand, and it still turned out great. I did let it cook down a bit to thicken up.
