10 stars for sure..This marinade was fabulous.  The only changes were I doubled the recipe and added 3 limes opposed to two(for which I used a glass lemon juicer to get all the juice possible and the pulp), some zest from one lime and instead of garlic powder I went with a fresh clove minced and I also added in some fresh cilantro for our taste preference.  Marinaded for 3 or so hours and I couldn't eat enough pieces.  YUMMY!  The perfect amount of lime and chili taste.  Will be making often this summer.  Thanks!

This recipe was delicious!  I followed it exactly and doubled it so I'd have enough to marinate all the veggies in.  I didn't exactly taste either the chili or the lime, I just tasted that it was delicious!  My husband said he could definitely taste the chili though.  I wouldn't recommend marinating it longer than 4 or 5 hours though b/c I marinated for 4 and the chicken was starting to fall apart...the combination of lime juice and vinegar really breaks down the chicken quickly!

I did not make kabobs with this; instead, I marinated 4 chicken breasts overnight in the marinade and broiled these. They were really good and tender with a nice kick to them.

I have made this so many times I habve lost count. Great on the BBQ or if it;s to cold outside I broil (but watch it not to close to the top)I have also cooked in a skillet if I am in a real hurry. Try cooking with tomatoe peppers and pineapple chunks on skewers, my daughter par boiled potatoe then put that on a skewer with the chicken brushed the potatoe with butter great for a picnic.

These are definitely more spicy than flavorful and come out very moist.  I marinated these for 6 hours and skewered the chicken with red and green peppers, onions and cherry tomatoes.  Next time I think I'll use crushed garlic vs. garlic powder, and increase the amount of lime juice for a bit more citrus flavor.  Overall, it was very good served with southwestern rice.  If you like spicy food, try this one.

Made this vinaigrette a few weeks ago and will be making it again tomorrow night. I subbed Key Lime Juice and a clove of crushed garlic. Marinated chicken, shrimp and veggies (green & yellow squash, green & red peppers, cherry tomatos, mushrooms and pineapple chunks) before tossing them all on the grill. Thanks.

These kabobs were a huge hit at our barbecue--everyone raved. The blend of citrus and spices was wonderful! I marinated the chicken in a Zip-Loc bag for 1 hour. The only thing I did differently was add about 1/2 tsp salt to the marinade, which really helped bring out the flavors. I didn't thread any veggies on the skewers. Instead, I grilled eggplant, zucchini, and red pepper slices separately and served them alongside, accompanied by Caribbean Sweet Potato Salad (also from this site). Thanks for a great new marinade!

I flubbed this so I am giving a 1 star meal (we ate something else for dinner instead), 3 stars to account for my mistake. I marinaded these for about 6 hours (using the juice from one fresh lime) but I still don't think that is long enough to get the good flavor that other reviewers have achieved. I was working w/ a new gas grill & I greatly overcooked them. But, as Michelle said, there wasn't enough flavor & what flavor did come through...was predominately chili powder. I added mushrooms & bell peppers to my skewers in hopes of making it a complete meal but I didn't marinade them (I don't think the lime would complement the mushrooms) & was afraid to add seasonings for fear of competing w/ the chicken marinade. The result...completely flavorless veggies that didn't add a thing to the dish. I don't know if I will ever try this dish again, I'm thinking that even if I had not overcooked it, that it still wouldn't have enough flavor for me ...sorry.

I was surprised how good this tasted.  I doubled the marinade for 2 B&S chick. breasts; sauteed in skillet as we don't have a bbq and served over rice and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.  Even my picky husband liked it!

Everyone loved the flavor.  I did use 3 limes instead of 1.  And  I marinate over night.  Keeper!

I ended up using more cayenne and less chili, but it was still fantastic. Everyone at our party just loved them! Spicy and tangy...add some bell peppers and onions to the skewers...yum yum!

This was very good and we both liked it a lot.  I made this as written except I used one large clove of fresh garlic instead of the powder and 1/4 t. cayenne.  The heat in this was barely detectable to us so next time I would increase the cayenne.  We also thought this could use just a little bit of sweetness, so I might add a t. of brown sugar next time.  This one will be repeated for sure!

Saw this on the main page and didn't agree. Did this once before, have the picture to prove it, and I didn't care for it. I did the Chicken and Bacon Shish Kabobs the same night and those supersede this flavor clashing recipe. . . I am known for improvising recipes somewhat, but for this, I copied it down to a "T". And still it just wasn't a favorite at all. . .

Simply delicious!  My whole family, including 5 and 8 year old boys, loved it!  I added it to my "old stand-by list."  I also marinated red, yellow and orange peppers and onions. However, I skewered them separately from the chicken since they grill faster. The few leftovers we had we rolled into fajitas with the peppers, onions and a little salsa.  Yummy!  Thank you!

You can't use bottle lime juice and expect the results to be the same.  Use fresh limes and you will taste a difference.

Awesome marinade! It is the perfect blend of spice and citrus....these were delicious! I used three chicken breasts cut in half then cut into 1" chunks. I also doubled the marinade as suggested. We marinaded the chicken for 5 hours and added the veggies in for the last hour with the marinade. Used green and red bell peppers, zuccini and yellow onion.

I've made this twice in the last month for different groups of friends/family.  Both times it was very well received.  Neither group were hardcore foodies but both enjoyed it.  Very easy to make.  I served this with with roasted potatoes and ceasar salad.  Another time I might try a taco or greek salad.    I was working with 12 inch bamboo skewers (soaked in water to prevent burning on the BBQ). Each skewer was assembled with 4 to 5 cubes of chicken, 2 whole white mushroom, 3 pieces of red/green peppers and 2 pieces of red onions.

OH MY! These were absolutely delectable! I only had time to marinate for about 45 minutes, but the flavor was still phenominal. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added chunks of red bell pepper, mushrooms, and grape tomatoes. Gotta have veggies on kabobs! Absolutely delicious, thank you SO much!

Very easy to prepare and make.  I love lime, so these kabobs made a nice change.  I did think the lime taste was only very slight (which is why I have reduced it to a 4*).  Next time I will try and marinade it over night to see if that improves the flavor.  Overall a great recipe that I know I will be trying a again.

Nice flavor, easy to make. I added red peppers, Vidalia onions and zuchinni to the skewers. I tossed the veggies in a zip lock baggie with a bit of olive oil and 1 clove of crushed garlic and salt to taste to give them some flavor. I would only suggest using 1/4 teaspoon of cayanne pepper, plenty spicy.

We love this recipe.  I marinate the chicken for about three or four hours, then add the peppers and onions to the skewers.  No need to marinate the veggies.  I do double the recipe for about a pound of chicken.  We also put a little of the leftover marinade on the skewers as they're on the grill.  Then we wrap them in warm tortillas.

These kebabs rock the house!  I have a kebab recipe that I use almost exclusively because it's so good that I never wanted to try another one.  But then I saw all the big praise for this one, and thought I'd try it out.  My only critcism is that they were a touch dry; not sure if I just overcooked them.  I think I'll try a little bit more olive oil next time.  Thanks very much for the recipe!!!

Excellent!  I used 4 Tbs. of bottled lime juice, which seemed to be perfect for us.  Still great even though I also decreased the oil.  Being below freezing and very windy, I oven "BBQ'd" them (475-deg).  I made extra marinade for vegetables on skewers, too, drizzling it over them just before baking.  We'll probably use this recipe throughout the year - and look forward to a day when we can use the grill outdoors.

Absolutely loved this recipe! Next time I make it I will actually double all the seasonings. This is my new go to meal for the summer! Along with the chicken I used green and red peppers, red onion, and mushrooms. Delicious!

These Kabobs were delicious!! The flavor was so good! I used 3 limes and you could still hardley taste the lime flavor, but they were still great! All in all I wouldn't count on a strong lime flavor, but just enough! I loved the Kabobs but I will definitely use this on chicken breast and bake in the oven! Also I intended to marinate for 5-6 hours, but because of  a change of plans i actually marinated them for about 24 hours, (which you really don't need to) and they came out perfect!!!

Great recipe!  I used two limes and the zest of one because we really enjoy that flavor.  Could definately taste the lime flavor.  I am planning to use the left over chicken in a salad tomorrow!

After seeing these recced time and time again on RE, I finally decided to give them a try on our camping trip. I was not disappointed.  I followed the recipe, though I omitted the black pepper and did not have onion powder so I subbed some minced onion.  These were really really yummy and I'll def add them to our chicken kabob rotation.  I look forward to marinating veggies w/this marinade, too, next time.

This recipe was pretty good. I grilled up the chicken with some green bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes, and marinated overnight. I would have been happier if the chicken had a bit more of a lime flavor. Perhaps next time I'll double the amount of lime, and maybe add extra cayenne pepper for a bit more kick.

This is a very flavorful recipe.  I doubled the marinade because I used close to 2 pounds of chicken.  I marinated for 3 1/2 hours and the flavors were wonderful.  The only thing I changed when doubling the marinade was I used the juice of 3 limes instead of 2.  I would say this recipe is close to what you would get in a restaurant.  We also grilled veggies.  Next time I might marinate the veggies too.  I will be making this recipe several times this summer.

I used chipotle chili powder and real garlic instead of garlic powder - very tasty!  Had a nice little kick with the chipotle and cayenne, although I think I went a little too heavy with the cayenne for my tastes.  Marinated for about 3 hours - chicken was very tender and the lime flavor penetrated the chicken kabobs, while the chipotle flavor was just on the outside.  Will definitely use this recipe again - Thanks for sharing!

We'll be having this one frequently at our house.  It was excellent.  I made just a few changes.  I added a little Cajun spice and about 2 tbs. of Lawry's "Havana Garlic & Lime" marinade only because I accidentally added more cayenne than I meant to and since my youngest doesn't like things too spicy I had to tone it down a little.  It marinated for about 4 hours in the fridge.  I used mushrooms, green & red peppers and red onion with it.  I realized too late that I should have grilled the veggies and the meat separately because they cook at different times and my veggies burned a little.  I paired it with Mexican Corn and an Orzo Salad.

Grilled this tonight for dinner. Was running very short on time this morning so didn't cut up for kabobs but grilled the chicken breast halves. Marinated them all day and Wow they were great. Love how moist they were and the seasonings. Used about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper as we don't like things very hot and it was perfect. Will make this again often. Thank you for a very healthy recipe that tastes so good!

These were awesome! I added some non-fat plain yogurt to the marinade for exta tenderness and marinated for about 3 hours. I also placed mushroom caps, orange pepper, zuchinni and red onion in a zip lock back with olive oil and seasonings and placed them on the skewer with the chicken.  Served with a side of grilled corn on the cob, this meal was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Full of flavor.  My hubby loved it, actually we are making more tonight.  I did not have red vinegar, so I used Balsamic Vinegar.  I put a lot of lime and garlic.  It just taste great.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very flavourful and easy to make.  I marinate the chicken in a Ziploc bag to make cleanup easier.  I've baked these in the oven instead of grilling, and they tasted great.

This chicken had a good flavor but wasn't as spicy as we expected it to be. Be sure to cut the chicken in uniform size pieces, or the smaller pieces will dry out like ours did. We had the leftovers served on a salad with Italian dressing - that made a great combination.

Some of the best grilled chicken we've had.  I did marinate overnight and the flavors were intense with just the right amout of heat.  The chicken came out juicy and full of flavor.  Since we have a full lemon tree, I did add juice of one lemon, as I needed to double the recipe anyway.  I also used my homemade garlic infused olive oil.  Yum!  Thank you for sharing!

I used Ancho Chili Powder and Nellie and Joe's Key lime juice as we like to reserve our fresh limes for eating plain. Marinated for about 6 hours, grilled with pineapple, zuchini, onion and mushrooms. Hubby was prepared not to like, wound up loving it. Spices blend nicely together.

This was ok, we marinated for about three hours and I used 1 3/4 limes, this made the chicken cook perfectly and was not dry at all.  The flavor of the chicken was not as nice as I had expected, we will make again but I will do some doctoring.

This was exactly the summer-time grilling out recipe I was looking for! For a vegetarian alternative I used the marinade for mango, pinapple, bell peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes and morningstar farms grillers 'chicken' strips.  Loved it!!

Great taste without being overpowering. I marinated boneless chicken breasts overnight and they were delicious! Will try as kabobs but it was great just for regular use on chicken breasts. Hubby really liked this one, thanks Simmi!

We made this with chicken tenders over rice.  It was so yummy!  It would be even better as kabobs but we didn't have all the ingredients. 5/21/07 I made it again as kabobs and it was amazing. I don't like chicken breast that much because it is usually dry. But this was moist and I couldn't stop eating it.  I'm hooked!

These kabobs had a wonderful taste. I marinated them all afternoon, and they were very tender. They also have a pretty color after they are grilled, making a pleasing presentation.

This is a great recipe!!  I changed a few things:  I used regular cooking oil instead of olive oil - only 1.5 tsp instead of 3 TBSP, and orange juice instead of lime juice - but only from 2 oranges, and instead of using garlic powder and onion powder, I used cumin and pepper, and instead of chicken I used beef.  I was out of paprika so I used cloves instead.  It was terrific!  I will use this recipe again and again!  (PS-this is satire)

The flavors didn't meld as the chili powder overpowered the other ingredients.  Perhaps cutting back the chili powder to 1/2 teaspoon or increasing the amount of limes might help.  I did use fresh minced onions and garlic in the marinade for more complexity in the flavors and a better finish to the dish.  Thank you simmig for the submission!

Loved the marinade! I used the juice of 2 limes because I wanted that extra citrus flavor.

I think the people having flavor issues aren't using enough salt. I tasted the marinade without salt and then added it and the lime flavor just popped out. Delicious recipe. It says "salt to taste" but with the quantities of this marinade you should use at least 1 tsp salt, probably more. Most of the salt is left behind in the marinade when you cook the chicken so too much sodium shouldn't be an issue.

My husband absolutely HATES boneless chicken breast and we rarely have them due to same. When I told him there were over 500 positive reviews he was anxious to write his bad review ;-) Needless to say, I had to pick myself off the floor when he would not quit praising this recipe! The chicken had tons of flavor and was very moist.  Guess we are going to be eating a lot more chicken breasts in this house.  Thanks!  We are going to try it on shrimp.

My family LOVED these!! We made this along with chile lime shrimp kabobs for our 4th of july celebration and everyone was raving about them. We added red peppers, red onions, muchrooms and cherry tomatoes to our and there were so good. We let the chicken marinate for at least 3 hours, so flavorful. Will make again. Thanks for sharing!!

I made this with pork instead of chicken and it was great.  Based on other reviews I tripled the recipe so I would have some marinate left over to put out on the table so I could add extra if anyone wanted.  Will make this again it went well with sliced mango and served with jasmine rice as a side.

I made this for a small dinner party and was super impressed.  The chicken had such great flavor.  I made one variation, I used fresh, minced garlic vs. the powder, but only because I am a garlic freak.  I've been craving it ever since, so we are making it again tonight.  Thanks!

We really liked these.  Very nice flavors.  Will definately make these again.  Maybe even use marinde on whole cuts of meat and skip the kabob format.

I made this and my husband loved it! He also shared the extras with the neighbors, who then wanted the recipe. We added chunks of red onion and pineapple to the kabobs.

We loved this recipe for so many reasons.  I really liked that the chicken only had to marinade an hour, but, still had great flavor! These kabobs would work great with so many combinations.   I used red & yellow peppers, red onion, & fresh pineapple.   I made the marinade exactly as is, but, next time I think I would use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Fantastic and I will definitely be making again.

This was just OK for me....I marinated the chicken chunks for about 2 hours. There was some heat to it, but I didn't really get a lot of the other flavors. I guess from all the 5 star reviews I thought it was going to be fantastic and ended being a bit disappointed.

We absolutely love this recipe. I made one small change and that was substituting a Tablespoon of chili paste (made by the rooster sauce people) for the Cayenne pepper. We like spicy. I used the same recipe for grilled chicken breasts the next week.

This is a great chicken marinade!  I didn't even bother to dice up my chicken breasts for kabobs, but rather just threw them in a large zip-lock baggie with the marinade for about 6 hours.  They turned out great.  Our BBQ guests loved them and my mom asked for the recipe.  My only change was the addition of about 1.5 tsp of cumin.  Love that smoky flavor paired with the lime.

My favorite marinade that I have found so far. I always try new ones, but always come back to this one. Glad I found it 3 years ago. Thought I should share the positive feedback. Definitely double or triple, the more the better. Very easy to make more for a crowd. And add a few more Fresh limes. I have done both overnight and for only one hour. Both turn out super, but the overnight is the bomb. Depending on your mood you can make it spicy or just flavorful by the amount of cayenne pepper you add. I have made it many times for a crowd or just the family and have always gotten terrific feedback. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I tripled the recipe plus added a 1-1/2 pound extra of boneless, skinless thighs.  All total it was 5-1/2 lbs. of chicken for the spring holiday barbeque.  I kept the heat under control by only adding 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne pepper.  I marinated it for almost 3 hrs.  Everyone loved it.  I actually preferred the dark meat but both were delicious. This will definitely be a recipe included every year for family grilling 'get-togethers'.

This has become my all-around chicken marinade. I marinade all different parts of the chicken in it and throw them on the grill - I've actually never done the kabob part! I love this recipe & I follow it exactly.

I searched recipes for a dinner with my friend who was recently diagnosed with both Gluten and Dairy allergies, and is also on Weight Watchers.  I marinated the chicken pieces for about 24hours- which I normally do if possible, to get the best flavor!  I wish I would have made more marinade and put the veggies in to marinate also- as they only picked up a bit of the flavor-but still were great!  The flavor is fantastic!!  I did the corn and black bean (with Avocado) salad on the side, and they were fantastic together!  If you do wind up making both, the leftovers from the 2 recipes are insanely wonderful in a tortilla wrap as a sandwich!!!

Made as is, and it tasted wonderful!  The marinade made the chicken very tender and juicy.  The lime taste was very subtle, so next time I'll try 2 limes.

I found this in search for something different to eat. I shared with my roommates, who were utterly amazed by the chickens flavor. I doubled the oil, vinegar and lime juice, but I only sprinkled a little extra for the spices. Additionally, I sauteed some red onions, green peppers, mushrooms and zucchini, and put a cherry tomato at the end of each kabob. Since I don't have a grill, I ended up broiling them for approximately 10 minutes on high, and about 5 more minutes after setting it on low. The result was a very clean, unburnt set of kabobs (Except the skewers), and the chicken was still quite most.

Didn't change anything, but I let the chicken marinate for about 10 hours, which made it very tender.

These are excellent! I made them exactly as written and they are full of flavor. I marinated them for 6 hours. Out of the tree different marinades I used on the meat these were the ones people enjoyed most. I will be making these again! Thanks!

Yum!  Found this recipe years ago when I didn't know what to do with some fresh limes I had.  It was an instant hit and has been enjoyed multiple times since.  We even did some steak kabobs last night and my family loved them, too. The marinade makes enough extra for the veggies, too- red onion, zucchini, tomatoes, red pepper.  We always serve this with rice and the Black Bean and Corn Salad II from this site.

Wow. Five million stars for amazing veggie marinade! I used chipotle chile and it turned out amazingly! I was quite disappointed with the chicken though so I don't think I'll use it for that again. The veggies I used were cherry tomatoes, sliced green pepper and large crimini mushrooms. MMMMMMMMMMM.

Made up a double batch and let the chicken marinate a couple of hours. Added veggies when I put them on the skewers. I was too lazy to heat up the grill so I threw them under the broiler for a little while (turning a few times) and they turned out fantastic. Great as a low-carb meal with extra hot sauce and sour cream for dipping. Yum.

I rarely review recipes, but this one calls for five stars.  The marinade gave the chicken a pleasant kick.  I cut the chili powder in half, because we find too much chili powder can overpower a recipe.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, but white wine vinegar worked well.  I made a little extra marinade for brushing during grilling.  Excellent.

We weren't really huge fans of this.  Only marinaded for an hour and cooked to perfection, but still felt "tough" from the lime acidity.  Probably wouldn't make again.

I wanted to make Kabobs one day and this recipe came up. My boyfriend looked at me like I was crazy when I started marinating  the chicken in this, so I made him regular bbq sauce kabobs. Well, he tried these and ended up LOVING them. The dogs got the bbq.

Yummmy! This is a very delicious recipe. I followed the recipe word for word and began marinating around noon and had hubby throw it on the grill that evening. Served it with some cherry tomato and squash kebabs (with just some olive oil and garlic salt) and homemade pilaf and we loved it! We're actually going to try this with shrimp tonight. It's a keeper!

These were good, but I didnt think 5 stars worth of good. My family likled them, and eveb ate all the grilled vegtables, but I was a little dissappointed. I'll make them again, but will try to let the chicken marinate longer. I did about 3 hours this time, could stand a lot more time marinating in my opinion.

Instead of making kabobs, I used the marinade for grilled chicken breasts. The flavor was great, and the chicken was moist! I did add a tablespoon of honey, and omitted the cayenne b/c I was out of it.  Next time I will be sure to use cayenne. My husband and I thought this marinade was flavorful, yet light and refreshing. Perfect for summer grilling!

I'm sorry but it was bland for me. I mean I love chili-lime chicken but this does not compare to the ones I've tasted. In my opinion, I think marinating it with just the dry rub and lime will stand out as I have tried McCormicks taco seasoning with lime juice for fajitas (chicken strips) and it was pretty darn good.  I may give this another chance....

Great on grilled scallops as well!! As another review suggested, don't let the meat marinate for longer than a few hours. I let mine marinate for about 4.5 hours and the chicken started to fall apart from the high acidity level.

WOW this is a fantastic recipe!  I doubled the marinade and chopped up 2 peppers (red & yellow) to soak w/ the chicken...I marinated for about 3 hours and then placed the peppers in between chicken on the skewers.  These were devoured...I will definitely be making this a LOT this summer for bbq's =)  Thanks!

A Summertime Supper STAPLE!  This was wonderful!  Made a few changes..didn't have red wine vinegar so I used Balsamic Vinegar, also added a tsp of Montreal Chicken spice, 1 tsp of Jerk seasoning and 1 tsp of cajun spice.  I marinated for 3 hours and skewered with alternating red and green pepper, served over herb and wild rice with corn on the cob on the side.  Fantastically tasty chicken and very moist. A definite keeper.

GREAT recipe!  No changes to the recipe were made or needed.  I used a zip lock bag to marinate, turning it over every so often to get good coverage.  I added bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and fresh pineapple chunks, which I did not marinate, to the skewers.  Thank you simmig for sharing such a GREAT recipe!

This is the first thing I cooked on my grill and my family can't get enough of it. Even if you want to make the marinade and soak some full chicken breasts in it you can't go wrong. If you haven't tried it yet you should.

This is a wonderful recipe for chicken.  I use this marinade to make kabobs, grilled chicken breasts, and baked chicken as well.  It's great when making any type of grilled chicken salad as well.  Thanks for this one -- we use it often!

I also marinated chicken breasts in this and cooked on the grill without making Kabobs. Very good an easy enough to throw the marinade together before work.

Delicious!! I grilled these up with peppers, mushrooms and zucchinis and it was really good. Next time I make it though I'm going to use 2 limes, 1 wasn't quite enough for me.

It has great potential.   Substituted Vegetable Oil, Apple Cider Vinegar. Added zest of the lime, 2 cloves of Garlic, 1/4 teaspoon Cayenne pepper, Bandania/Shadon Bennie (Cilantro), Soy Sauce, Worcestershire Sauce. Marinated for about 24hours. I also broiled it on a sheet without the skewers. Next time I'll save the marinade and brush the chicken while it is broiling so it doesn't dry out. Love a lot of flavor to my food and couldn't bear having to waste another recipe, so I added extras just in case.  Served with Roasted Veggies (Zucchini, Green Pepper, Red Onion), with some of the spices from the marinade and Teriyaki Sauce. Also Hot Potato and Perfect Rice. Adding some chili powder in both rice and potato for extra flavor. Also added some Pineapple chunks for some sweetness right from the can to the plate.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I doubled the recipe so I would have plenty of marinade and I added in some lemon juice as well.  I used 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for the doubled recipe.  Great summer meal!

Excellent marinade.  As I made it, "cayenne pepper to taste" was about 1/4 teaspoon.  After marinating it for about three hours, I threw some mushrooms in to soak in the sauce for 15 minutes or so.  Also on the skewer were Vidalia onions (lots of these) and cherry tomatoes.  There would have been green peppers, but I was rushing and forgot.  All grilled together on the BBQ.  Best Chicken Kabob I've ever had.

Just pulled these off the BBQ and OH MY GOSH!  They are AMAZING.  I doubled the marinade recipe for about 1-1/2 pounds of boneless skinless chicken breast cut into chunks.  After threading the meat on the skewers, I tossed some baby asparagus in the marinade and baked them at 400 degrees for as long as it took to grill the kebobs.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

I use lemon and lime interchangeably so lemon is what I had on hand. This marinade is wonderful! You can set your own kick with the cayenne. The chicken was very tender. We were out of briquets so I broiled them. Will add it to my favorite list.

These were awesome - I followed the recipe exactly except I added the zest of one lime and a little extra chili powder.  Marinated for about 3 hours.

These were good - but I would have preferred a more intense flavor. Perhaps a chili-lime baste during cooking would have achieved this. As is, the flavor was really quite mild and lacked the "tang" I was looking forward to.

This is fantastic! I made these and added shrimp, green and orange bell peppers, and onions, cherry tomatoes to some of them. Everyone ranted about how good my dish was. Definately making this again! Update, after several months my family is still asking me when I'm making those kabobbs again.

Great taste!  I skipped the cayenne for my kids' sake and used 2 fresh cloves of garlic since we can't get enough of it around here.  For time, did not do kabobs.  Very tastey, not at all dry as stated by other reviews even though we use great, big Amish chicken breasts.  I suspect it's in how it's marinated & cooked: pierce the chicken all over before coating it & make sure your fire is initially hot to sear & seal in the juices, then turn down your fire & don't overcook it (4-6 minutes per side is all you need).  I liked the suggestion about serving it w/ couscous.  It was a great combo, and the kids thought it was cool.  This recipe made the "keep" list for sure!

I thought the flavors were nice, just I started them soaking the night before with the veggies, think it kinda made the chicken tough, will try just maybe a couple hours before and keep basting it while it is on the grill

I really liked this very easy recipe. I did about double the marinade (but I also had about 2 lbs. chicken breasts). I added about 1 teasponn salt (and it was on the low side). I added very little cayenne because I knew one of my guests didn't like spicy food. I then served garlic-chili sauce (store-bought) on the side. I did marinate for about 4 hours and then grilled chicken alone in skewers. It was tasty and juicy. Will definitely do again!

Very good flavor, we really liked this one !  Added green peppers, red peppers and mushrooms while marinating, and then skewered the veggies separate from the chicken, so that we could cook the chicken a little longer.   Great recipe, we'll use this again.  Thanks !

Yummy!  By far, this is my favorite meal to serve during summertime when entertaining.  I have served this recipe for two years now.  Preparing the skewers is a messy job, but worth it.  You won't be disappointed with this one.

I marinated the chicken for 2 days because our cook-out got rained out.  Everyone loved the presentation as well as the flavor.  Like other reviewers, I will use this marinade on chicken breasts in the future whether I plan to make kabobs or not.

I have enjoyed this recipe several times just the way it is -though sometimes I use more lime juice squeezed over the chicken after it's already been cooked.  This dish is GREAT served with mango.

These are so good. I have to double the recipe so I can have some for leftovers. I only marinate the chicken long enough for me to cut up the vegetables. Will definitely make regularly.

3 1/2 stars, really.  I like these betther than my husband did -- he felt the flavor was a little odd.  Liked them, but couldn't see himself eating them again.  Oh well, I made them on the skewers on the rotissere -- very easy.  Worth trying.

Excellent summer dish.  Skewer with mushrooms, tomatoes, red bell pepper, purple onion.  I sliced zucchini squash and grilled it with the left-over marinade drizzled over the top. Served all this with rice pilaf.  Great dinner!!

Simply fabulous! I skewered the chicken with lime wedges, and the pieces of chicken that were next to the lime got an extra kick of citrus! Wonderful wonderful wonderful!

Also - use a Ziploc bag for the marinade... It makes for practically zero cleanup!

This was ok.  I didn't love it, I didn't hate it.  There was something about it that I didn't particularly care for, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was.  My husband really liked it a lot, so I'm sure I'll end up giving it a try again.

I didn't have chicken, so I use port tenderloin. This marinade is out of this world. My entire family, even my picky 16 year, loved it!!!

Really good and easy only marinated 1 hour and they turned out great.  Didn't have Cayenne pepper, but they were still good.  Next time I'll try it with the cayenne.

You can also add non fat plain yogurt to the marinade.  I marinaded for 3 -4 hours and the chicken came out very good.

This marinade was wonderful.  The chicken turned out very juicy.  I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and skewered it with onions, peppers, cherry tomatoes, and canned whole potatoes.  I boiled the left over marinade, used it as a sauce, and served the kabobs over rice.  This recipe was a big hit at our church small group meeting.  This is the best grilled chicken I've ever had!!!

I marinated the kabob pieces overnight, and we still thought they needed more flavor.  I've chopped the leftover pieces into the remainder of the black bean and corn salad (yummy dressing!!) that I served with the kabobs for a delicious lunch later this week.

Very easy to make and great flavor.  For more of a flare, I alternated cherry tomatoes, gold/orange peppers pieces, and  whole mushrooms with the chicken on the skewers and broiled in the oven instead of grilling for 20 minutes.  Mmmmmmm!!! Very tasty.  Enjoy!!

This recipe was very good! Buy the thickest chicken breasts you can buy to make it easier to cube them. Didn't change a thing in the recipe, just added some meat tenderizer to the marinade and marinated about an hour. Used extra marinade to brush on chicken kabobs before cooking. Very good!

I marinated this chicken overnight and simply grilled chicken breasts rather than make kabobs. It was absolutely delicious. My whole family gobbled it up. The chili flavor is not overpowering and you can definitely taste the lime flavor.

My family enjoyed this recipe very much...even my three and five year olds!  I made extra chicken breasts for them thinking this would be too spicy for them, but it wasn't.  My father-in-law liked it so much he asked me what was in the marinade.  Very nice flavor.  I'll make these again and again.

Quick and easy!  Add more cayenne pepper for spicier taste buds.  Pour left over marinate onto skewers- it adds to the taste of the vegetables.

I sliced the chicken into strips, added an extra lime to the marinade. Let the chicken sit in marinade for about 2 hours. Sauteed the chicken. Added sauteed bell peppers and onions. Served as soft tacos with shredded cheddar cheese and lettuce.

Kabobs that are loaded with flavor.  I was surprised at how much flavor this marinade provided to the chicken.  I made as written and adding green peppers to the skewers.  The grill temp and time were spot on for perfectly grilled kabobs.  Served 'Roasted Cauliflower 'Steaks'' and 'Shoepeg Corn Salad' from AR with the meal.

very tender and juice, followed recipe exactly.  Could have doubled the chili powder and used more cayenne (i used 1/8 tsp) and juive of two limes, to bring out spicy.  would used cilantro next time in marinade.

Yummy! I'd love to rate this with more than five stars! I made this as the recipe said except that I didn't cut up the breast halves. I just pounded them out a little and grilled them. They were so juicy and good.

I had the chicken marinating when we got called away. Ended up marinating for a day and a half. It was the best chicken kabobs I ever done. Just used wedges of onion, peppers and mushrooms. Marinated the vegetables for about 1/2 hour. Definitely will make again. Thanks

This was a great treat; the only changes I made was to use real fresh pressed garlic, I added chopped cilantro and cumin instead of the cayenne and chili powder as the grandkids prefer less spice. It was a big hit!  I made extra of the marinade and brought it to a boil for 5 minutes to use as a sauce at the table. Will definitely make this again.

This was really good! FYI, 2 key limes do NOT equal 1 lime. I had several key limes left and wanted to use them. I had also read the advice of others, and added more lime. The taste was really good, but it was like eating a concentrated lime. Not the fault of the recipe, but mine.

So tasty and delicious. Great recipe and the marinade is incredible. I thought it was a bit spicy for me, but my husband and friends thought it had the perfect amount of heat. I increased the recipe to account for 5 chicken breasts and it was perfect.

Absolutely delicious. I marinated the chicken for about 6hrs I did not include the vegetables in the chicken marinate. I marinated the vegetables in a separate bag and only for 1hr. I use 1/2 tsp chili powder my husband does not like anything spicy. Since chicken takes longer to cook I skewered the chicken alone then the veggies on a separate skewers.  For the vegetables I used onions,cherry tomatoes,zucchini and red peppers. I used 3 limes instead of one and fresh garlic. When I whisk everything together I taste it to make sure it has a taste I like and make any adjustments. I served it with rice.  Thank you for the recipe!

Great. Made it exactly like recipe. I did marinade about 2+ hours so I think that if marinated longer it would have been even better. Big hit with all the men in my family!It's a keeper. The comments about some changes all sound good so I may try some other suggestions next time.

This was absolutely delicious.  Marinated for about 2.5hrs.  Used about 1/3 tsp cayanne pepper and it was probably a "medium" heat.  Grilled up some red onions, zuchini and pineapple to serve with it! Delicious.

I was looking for ideas on kabob marinade and chili lime is win-win for me. This was the perfect combination of spices and flavors and I marinated my chicken for a couple hours. Next time I'll try overnight.

I really liked the marinade in these kabobs! I made two batches of the marinde and used one for the meat and the other for the veggies. As others had stated, I increased to the juice of two limes for the marinade and I thought it was perfect! I alo skewered both chicken and shrimp. What a hit!

I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because the chili powder was a little too overpowering for me...however, I used white vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and I'm wondering if that made much difference.  I could still taste the hint of lime (delicious) and I did end up using about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt as another reviewer suggested.  This is a fantastic find and I will make it again although I'll cut the amount of chili powder I add.  Thanks!

Amazing!  I didn't have much time so I only let them marinate for about 35-40 minutes.  They were so tender and juicy.  Had a nice little kick to them too.  I will be making these again and again!

These chicken skewers were soooo tasty. I marinated for about 2 hours, and the chicken was very moist and delicious. I'm not much of a griller, so I put the chicken tightly on the skewers and cooked it on my stovetop griddle, rotating it frequently so it got an even texture. I served it with the homemade flour tortillas and salsa (both from this site) and it was delicious. The next time I make this I might add a bit more spice, but this marinade is absolutely delicious as-is. This will become a standby recipe in my kitchen.

This was delicious!  I took advice from another review and also made a double batch of the marinade to use on the veggies.  My grillmaster boyfriend used the leftover veggie marinade to baste the kabobs while grilling.  I also agree that if you like spicy, you should add red pepper flakes or cayenne, or both (I did!).

Did not have enough flavor.  If I make it again I'll be doing some serious revamping and I'm not sure I like the vinegar in there at all, it detracts too much from the lime.

Yum! So good! I didn't have red wine vinegar but used white vinegar and I did not have onion powder.  But it was still  good. We put ours on the bbq grill and i whipped up a yogurt sauce and put some buttered naans on the grill with corn on the cob on the side.

AMAZING Kabobs! They are citrisy, tangy, and have a little bit of chili zest to them. I did have to substitute the red wine vinegar because I didn't have any. Instead I used balsamic vinegar and that worked great. I also used two lemons and one lime instead of 3 limes because I wanted more marinade to baste the kabobs with once they were on the grill. One caveat: beware of letting the chicken marinate in the citric juice for too long. The chicken will start to break down pretty quickly. Even after just 45 minutes, my chicken pieces were pretty soft.

Definitely add more lime and throw in a teaspoon of zest.  I used 5 key limes and marinated the chicken for 3 hours.  All the flavors shine through, the lime hits first and the chili gives a little bite at the end.  I also threw mushrooms in the marinade for the last 10 minutes or so and kebabed them with the rest.  Good eating!

Good marinade.  I used it on shrimp and vegetable kabobs. I only marinated the shrimp for an hour, so the flavor wasn't super strong, but still good.  Will marinade for longer next time.  Will keep this recipe!

Amazing!!! Rare to find a recipe that I didn't need to tweak. I followed the recipe exactly. Doubled and marinated red and yellow peppers and onions with the chicken. Skewered with grape cherry tomatoes. All three adults, one teenager and even the two year old loved it. They are still raving about it!!! Perfect for summer.

I added an extra lime as well as lime zest and used a few garlic cloves.  This was still a little bland to me but we had hot sauce on the side so that made it better.  Very easy recipe however.

I made this recipe at my labor day bbq this year and it was a big hit! they are easy to prepare and everyone kept raving about how delicious they were. I will definitely make this again. I let them marinate for 4 hours and the lemon juice really did start to break down the chicken, i would say that 4 hours should be max marinating time.

I made these as Kabobs and just made them again as just chicken breasts with the marinade.  They turned out great both ways! Definately will make these part of our monthly menu.

Loved it!  I didn't think an hour would be long enough to marinate breast meat but it was all that I had for time.  Boy was I suprised!  It's fresh and flavorful.  Make extra so that you have left overs.  It would make an amazing chicken wrap, southwestern creamy chicken salad, and so much more!

The chicken had good, not overpowering flavor.  I used ancho chili powder instead of the standard supermarket variety and therefore used only 1/2 tsp.  That meant my small children could still eat the chicken.  For my personal preference, I'd add a little more chili powder.

I changed very little in this recipe, only using white balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar. I liked the way the tang of the lime and the flavor of the chili powder worked together. I found it to be very flavorful, and the chicken tender and juicy. Quick, easy and delicious.

Absolutely wonderful. Loved it! Used 3 limes instead of 1 and added green and yellow peppers, red onions, cherry tomatoes and pineapple to the marinade and the skewers.  Make extra, it will go fast!

These are absolutely amazing! The first time I made these, I marinated for about 2 hours, the second time for about a day and a half. They were good both times, but I will definitely prepare these the day before grilling. They are SO flavorful. This is my recipe of the summer!

These were so easy and so good. I did use fresh minced garlic and onion. I discovered at the last minute that I was out of chili powder so I used taco seasoning. Everybody loved them. This recipe is a keeper.

I would have given it a five star but like some of the other reviewers I couldn't taste the flavor at all. I think it should sit longer then an hour.

This is a very good marinade. I followed the recipe for the marinade exactly.  I did not make kabobs, rather I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I marinated them for about 6 hours.  We thought it was delicious, very flavorful.  Very easy, with simple, basic ingredients.

This is a great start for a marinade.  I went far off of what was in the recipe as far as spices are concerned.  I added a lot more of all of them and a lot, lot more of chili powder.  I put it on shrimp and grilled them on skewers.  Delicious.

I made these for my boyfriend and my roommates last night and they were a huge hit! Only change I made was in addition to the tri colored bell pepper, I added some pineapple to a few of the skewers ( fresh pineapple). My roommate devoured them. I also added gourmet mushrooms to a couple of the skewers for more variety. Another win! We cooked this batch on the grill. I made a lot of marinade and threw the rest of the chicken in a ziplock and froze it to use for a quick sautee meal later this week. I plan to make another huge batch of this marinade to keep on hand to use for sauteeing and I want to see how it pairs with shrimp! Excellent recipie!

After reading the reviews I made a bit more of the marinade and then threw whatever fresh leftover vegetables I had in with it to marinate away.  I let it marinate for three hours and it really soaked up the marinade and was wonderful!  I might add fresh cilantro to it next time.  Vegetables I used were red and green peppers, red onion, cherry tomatoes.  The marinade is so easy to make that this will become a staple in our home.

Seriously fantastic. I marinated for about 4 hours before BBQing. SO YUMMY.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder but other than that, exactly as the recipe called for. So moist juicy and a very subtle but awesome taste.

GREAT flavor.  I didn't actually measure anything, just eyeballed the amounts.  Skipped cayenne this first time preparing because I wanted to test out heat.  Was just fine without it.  Marinated chicken for an hour as I didn't want to toughen the meat (which can happen with chicken), put on skewers with zucchini and yellow squash chunks, and cooked on George Foreman grill for about 7 minutes.  Next time will add a tiny bit of cayenne and maybe marinate the veggies too.

The marinade worked and tasted great!  It was really good but what I did was instead of making kabobs I grilled the chicken and prepared sauteed onion, green peppers & mushrooms and bought french bread and melted cheese over the chicken pieces and made sandwiches out of it.  It was great!!!

I've only done the kabobs once, but use this marinade for chicken frequently when grilling.  My husband and I both love it! It's not a strong flavor, more subtle compared to other marinades or seasonings I use, but it makes a great fit for whatever you'll be having with it.  And its easy!

This is one of my favorite dishes (the fiances too). I live in a condo and cannot have a grill. I basically use the marinade recipes for chicken tenders. I let it marinade in the fridge for about 1 hr and pan cook it. Usually serve it with some rice and cilantro. Mmmmm...

Great! Made these Saturday for a dinner party and everyone loved them. Flavors were great, cooking time was right on with the grill. For veggies, I used zucchini, onions, and bell peppers.

This was a great recipe! I doubled all the ingredients, and used 4 garlic cloves in place of the garlic powder. I marinated 4 chicken breasts, and grilled them as is instead of making kabobs, and they came out great. I chopped up the leftovers and served over a green salad for lunch the next day. Turned out great!

Great marinade! I just did chicken breasts on the grill. I doubled the recipe, increased the lime juice by 50%, and added some fresh and finely chopped cilantro. Soooo good!

Oh boy! I don't usually review recipes,although I love the helpful hints I get from other reviewers. However this so good, I can't keep it to myself. I added zucchini, squash, red onion, red pepper, green pepper, and pineapple. I marinated everyting except the pineapple along with the chicken and doubled the marinade. Fantastic! We ate it three times last week.

Wow!  Great recipe.  I didn't do anything to alter the recipe and it came out great.  Not only were they very pretty, the peppers, onions and tomatoes I put on the skewers with the chicken were delicious.  I served on a bed of rice.

I have made this so many times!  I love it and everyone that has had it asked for the recipe!  The key is to make sure that you don't over cook the chicken.  If it is dry, it ruins the entire dish!  I always add extra lime b/c I love the flavor.  Thanks!

Great marinade but I'd like it to have more lime next time.  I marinated overnight and grilled the chicken breast.  It's great sliced thin on top of any salad.

Loved this!  I doubled the recipe, increased the limes to 3 and used Chipotle Chili Powder instead of regular chili powder and then just a pinch of Cayenne.  I made it the night before and then marinated the chicken for five hours.  It wasn't spicy and just had a great flavor! I got rave reviews from my friends.  Will definitely make again!

Grilled with chicken, onions and peppers. Then we wrapped them in tortillas with taco toppings. I used fresh garlic instead of the powdered. Definitely marinate for a while, atleast for a few hours! OH and I used a chipolte seasoning instead of cayenne.

I finally tried this last night. It was good. Everyone else LOVED it. That's why it gets 4 stars. BUT it gave me EXCRUCIATING heartburn (which is normally not an issue for me. ever), so I'm not giving it 5 stars. Having said that, due to rave reviews from those who ate it, I'm actually about to recommend it on the exchange!

I was surprised that there really wasn't a lot of flavor.  I could barely taste the lime and, although the chili flavoring was a little more obvious, it wasn't spicy at all.  It did not live up to my expectations.

These were awesome, I probably used about 1/4 tsp of cayenne, the only change was I used lemon in place of lime(all I had on hand).I also poured the marinade over the veggies(onion,green pepper and mushrooms)and let it sit for about 15 mins.

These were amazing! I grilled them indoors on my panini grill since I don't have a bbq. I used onions and garlic in between the pieces of chicken. Such an interesting marinade that turns out great.

Very good!  I flattened out some chicken breasts and marinated them overnight.  I didn't have a fresh lime so I had to estimate how much lime juice to add...it turned out moist and tangy.

I give this recipe 5 stars in big part because, except for the lime, I actually had all the ingredients for this is the pantry. I used two tablespoons of bottled lime juice instead of squeezing it myself. It was more tart than I had expected, maybe fresh squeezed would be better.

Simple yet delicious recipe! Served this on a bed of Pineapple Salsa (recipe also from this website). Great blend of flavors. I also grilled some limes so that I can add some more juice during serving. Next time I will increase the cayenne pepper for extra kick! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent! Super simple and easy to make. I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon and marinated for half an hour. I also broiled them instead of grilling for 6 minutes on each side and added red and green bell peppers and onion.

This was just OK. It was a bit on the bland side.I even basted liberally during grilling but still didnt get much flavor. Probably would have helped if i marinated it over night but i only had about 5 hours. We took it off the skewers and wraped it in a flour tortilla.It was just ok.

My husband and I used this marinade for chicken and steak and then used the meat for burritos.  It was wonderful!  I didn't make any changes to it.  It had a great flavor.

Delicious!  I made it one night I couldn't figure out what to make for the family.  This marinate is terrific with sirloin and then skewered.

This was wonderful.  I doubled the marinade and I let the chicken marinade over night.  I also added chopped fresh parsley and cilantro and threw in a little greek seasoning.  The only issue was I didn't amke enough.  This will def go into the rotation.

This is a great, super easy marinade. I marinated chicken cubes & served w/ grilled green peppers & yellow squash (just in olive oil & s/p) with a side of coconut lime rice from trader joe's. My husband said- " I don't know what you marinated this chicken in, but it is outstanding" - with no prompting! 
Definitely a keeper.

I first cut a variety of veggies including squash and red, yellow and green sweet peppers, drizzled oil over all, seasoned well, and baked about 10 minutes and let cool.  Then I threaded the veggies and chicken onto skewers and broiled in the oven.  My company and I enjoyed every bite.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Excellent! I just marinated the whole boneless chicken breasts in a ziplock bag and grilled with a side of veggies - very, very moist and delicious - don't let the "hot" spices deter you from trying - was actually mild and I "kicked" it up a notch!  I'm going to try this with london broil.  Thanks for sharing!

These are delicious!  A friend made these at our monthly cooking club and everyone raved about them, and in fact two of us have already made them at our own houses!  The chicken is so tender and flavorful, always comes out great.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good. I doubled the marinade and added button mushrooms, 1/2 a red onion, and a red bell pepper to the mixture. Awesome on the grill! (I probably used 1/2 tsp of cayenne)

We loved this recipe.  Had great flavor! Made a sub with the vinegar (only had cider)and didn't add cayenne (my kids don't appreciate spicy yet:)).
The flavor of the lime and chili powder really worked well together.

Oh, sooo good! I used jarred minced garlic and the juice and grated zest of three limes because I wanted the flavor of the lime to come through, and I left out the vinegar. That's why I gave four stars instead of five, but it's still a good starting point to an excellent chicken dish. Definately a repeater!

I didn't think this recipe was as  spectacular as all the other reviewers claimed it to be.  

It was decent but I could barely taste the lime even though I marinated it for 1.5-2hrs.  If I try this again I'll add  lime zest since that's where most of the lime flavour is anyway.

I gave it "* * *" partly b/c it was BBQ'd , which will make anything taste good.

WOW - This is a great marinade! And soo easy to make, with things you already have lying around the kitchen.  Also works awesome on steak & pork too!  After making this quite a few times the only thing i do a little diff sometimes is to add a little cayenne pepper for a little added kick!  Would give 10 stars if i could...thanks for the recipe!

This is the only chicken that my entire family loves! My pickiest eater can't wait until dinner when I make this. I use fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder but everything else stays the same. Unless we're camping and I have to estimate on the measurements. I've even grilled it in a  wok and it turned out fantastic. We tried marinating whole boneless skinless breasts and grilling them but the flavor was only on the outside. So now I either kabob it or wok it! Thanks for the wonderful addition to my weekly menu.

I loved this! My first attempt at making kabobs, and although I burnt the veggies I grilled, the chicken came out great. I served them over a bed of white rice...delicious. I'll make this again, thanks!

I really liked this recipe. I did double the marinade and I didn't make kabobs out of it.  I chunked the chicken breast into bite size pieces and marinated them for about 45 minutes.  I cut up a green pepper and an onion to go with the chicken.  I used my grill pan and added the chicken, pepper, and onion.  I grilled them until the the chicken got crispy and the veggies were soft. I then served this over rice.  It turned out very tasty and the chicken was so tender.  I will be making this again. I love how easy it is to prepare and good it tastes!

Very tasty marinade.  I marinated and grilled chicken tenders rather than making kabobs.  My kids said, "make this again mom".  Next time I will marinade longer than an hour for stronger flavor.

A 5-star recipe both for taste, and ease of preparation.  It's amazing how much flavor you can get with only 20 minutes of marinading.

This is a great marinade. The only changes I made were to leave out the cayenne as hubby isn't a big spicy fan. I made this for my sons 2nd b-day party and I did kabobs with steak, shrimp, and chicken and this was a crowd pleaser. Super easy to make and I let it marinade overnight and it has a great flavor. I was worried that the chili powder might make it too spicy but it was perfect. Highly recommend!

I can't give this enough stars!We grilled out last night and my boyfriend asked me for this recipe so he could use it again. I didn't have time to marinade the chicken very long. Probaby 20 minutes or so. I can't imagine how flavorful the chicken would have been if I had marinated it longer.

Im pretty sure I made this recipe correctly, but it came out not that flavorful. I even marinated the chicken over night! I did not spread it on while grilling though. Maybe its just my taste buds?

I have made this marinade with beef as well, and it is really good either way.  This has become a favorite in our household!  I usually add a bit more lime and a bit more vinegar just because I like things to be very tangy.  The original recipe is fabulous too though!

These were good.  I would give them 3.5 stars if I could.  Next time I will marinate them for much longer.  Maybe even overnight.  We will try them again.  Nice change!  We added onion and bell pepper to our kabobs.

Used chicken breasts vs. making them into kabobs and grilled on the outdoor grill.  Used 1/2 tsp. ground ginger in the jar and 1 tbsp. of minced garlic from a jar.  All other ingredients and measurements the same.  Marinated overnight.  Delicious!

I would probably give this 3.5 stars if possible.  The marinade gave the chicken plenty of flavour, we just didn't really like the flavour. The combination of flavours seemed a bit off in my opinion.  It wasn't bad but I wouldn't make it again.

Nice change to the usual sweet kabobs marinades! I only marinated the chicken for 45 minutes but we already loved the taste. Can't wait to make it again with a 24h marinade!

I was a bit nervous about this one as the marinade tasted strongly of red wine vinegar. WE marinated for 24 hours and these turned out fabulously.  The chili and lime flavors are fantastic together.

We made with red peppers, yellow squash, and onion.  We marinated the veggies with the meat.  Very good.  The chicken picked up the lime flavor well.

Very good!  I would double the recipe for the marinade though.  I cut up the chicken breasts and marinated them for about 2 hours, then added some onions and green pepper and marinated for another hour.  I cooked them in my oven using the broiler and broiler pan, just spread them out all over the pan and turned them over every once in awhile.  They came out tender and tasty.  My kids enjoyed them a lot, my husband added some red hot for a little extra spice.

I like this recipe alot, it had a great flavor-- I only used half a lime and regular vinegar (I had no red wine vinegar) and put it on the forman, but it was still very tasty!  My partner hated it, but she doesn't like limes, so it's understandable. I think this chicken would be fantastic on a grill!

These were a big hit for Memorial Day...I had five people, so I tripled the recipe. I cut the chicken in large chunks, so the meat did not dry out. I marinated the chicken for 12 hours, and used plenty of cayenne to heat things up. Skewered with bell peppers, mushrooms, yellow squash, zucchini & cherry tomatoes. Awesome!!

We thought these were great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I had no onion powder - so I added some finely diced fresh white onion to the marinade. I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours, and it had a nice flavor. Skewered with grape tomatoes, whole mushrooms, and red onions, and served with basmati rice. Fantastic! I highly recommend grilling grape tomatoes - they have the nicest, sweet, smoky flavor. 
Next time I will try cutting the oil just a little and maybe adding more vinegar or lime- that should intensify the flavors and cut a little of the fat. Great recipe!

Usually when I make kabobs the chicken is flavorless and sometimes dry. This marinade is so flavorful and kept the chicken moist. I used onions, tomatoes, zucchini, and red bell pepper throughout the kabobs. Next time I will marinate the vegetables too so they have the same wonderful taste as the chicken did. I served the kebobs over a bed of saffron rice. Yummy!

I used it on chicken breasts and put them in a taco salad.  I found that the flavor got lost.  Would have been better, or at least the flavor would have been more noticeable had a served it alone.

This easy recipe is one of my favorites! I like to use 2 limes instead of one for extra citrus flavor. I also marinate the chicken overnight and found that the chicken becomes even more flavorfull.

This is really awesome!  I used the recipe as printed on some skinless chicken thighs and grilled them. Yum!!  Then I used lemon instead of the lime and marinated some boneless chicken breasts.  Yum, also!!  I like that I have the ingredients usually on hand, so it's easy to prepare!

Didn't have a grill, so I combined this marinade and the recipe for Lemon Garlic Chicken submitted by Tyson Foods to create a delicious, subtle, spicy lime rice dish.  Instead of adding lemon juice, I simply poured the leftover marinade in with the chicken broth in step 2 of the Tyson recipe.  You can either add all the garlic (use amounts from both recipes) or just the garlic in the marinade, either way it's delicious.  And with cauliflower mixed right in, it gets an A+ from me!!

I used the lime juice from one lime and I think that was plenty.  I think the lime is just for a hint, not a full flavor.  It was delicious and healthy!  I marinated the chicken for 6 hours and put it on the Forman grill.  There was still some marinade left over, so I poured it in the pan with the mushrooms that I was cooking.  This is a keeper!

This is tasty - follow as recipe directs, I added an extra lime as other reviews suggested but it was overkill.  I marinated for 6 hours and the flavor was plenty strong.  I cooked the cubes in a rotisserie about 20 min. at 465, great in the winter instead of a grill.

very flavorful.  i used the juice from 2 limes and marinated chicken tenders that were 1/2 frozen.  i have found that if you let the chicken defrost in the marinade, it absorbs the flavor better.  marinade as long as you can, i suggest a min. of 6 hours.

I made this recipe because I had some limes I needed to use up. The rest of the ingredients I usually have on hand so it wasn't a problem finding them.  I used chicken tenderloins and doubled the recipe because I was cleaning out my fridge. I let some marinate for a few hours (because hubby was hungry) and the remaining overnight. I didn't have any skewers so I didn't cut them up. I put them on the George Foreman and let them cook for about 5 mins. Served them to hubby last night with Oodles of Noodles and 3-cheese biscuits. Served them this afternoon with green beans and 3-cheese biscuits. This is an excellent recipe for cook once, eat many times. My husband is raving over the flavor of the chicken. I will definitely make this again!

This is an okay recipe.  We weren't incredibly thrilled with the results.  It is pretty good, but nothing we'd try again.

This was good enough for me to give it 5 stars!  Wow - I was really impressed with how easy it was to make and how gorgeous the kebabs looked when grilled.  Delicious!

Not as "wow" as we were expecting.  We were disappointed overall.  The cayenne did have a little kick but we didn't really notice the lime.  I doubt we will make it again.

I've made these several times since I first came across the recipe last summer. It is delicious and the chicken is moist.  I use whatever veggies I have on hand and generally marinate the chicken for a little over an hour.  I definitely recommend trying this one.

This was a great recipe.  I had a friend and her children over for dinner and everyone loved it, even the little ones.  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs as it was all I had in the house and only marinated it for about 40 minutes and it was still great.  I would definately make this again.

Fantastic flavor! I only added chopped cilantro, I might cut the chili powder to half teaspoon. It was a tad hot for me. Fantastic chicken marinade for Mexican meals.

I used 2 and a half limes. I olive oiled the skewers, not the grill. When we were on the Keto diet, I grilled the chicken with orange, green and red bell peppers and red onion. When we were off Keto, I added the pineapple. Grilled pineapple is such a treat!

Made the recipe just as described, but marinated the chicken foe about 4 hours. The taste was sensational and the chicken moist and tender. Will be making this again.

This is a really good marinade recipe for the grill. Nice and spicy! I think I would use more lime juice then vinegar next time. Maybe no vinegar. You couldn't really taste the lime at all. I used this to marinade boneless chicken thighs for grilling.

This was exceptional!! The only change I made was eliminating the cayenne pepper, my family doesn't like spicy food. I tripled the marinade because of the amount of boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Definitely a do-over!

Love this. I mainly use it as a marinade for chicken fajitas that I make in my cast iron skillet. I just throw in a red onion and bell pepper and omit the cayenne since I'm cooking for my kids. The leftovers make delicious quesadillas the following day.

This was a great low-sodium dinner. I doubled the marinade recipe for the chicken and used 3 limes total. I marinated for about 7 hours and served with some farro. I also made another batch of marinade (as written) for veggies and marinated them for 3 hours.  This was very tasty and will definitely make it again!

Excellent! Ease up on the  cayenne  pepper. I would've given it five stars but it was just too spicy for me the way it was. Also threaded onions and red pepper onto the skewers for vegetables.

Threaded with baby Bella mushroom, bell pepper, red onion, and cherry tomatoes. Grilled over indirect heat with a few hickory smoker chips. Served with Spanish potato salad. Used a bit more lime than called for.  Will definitely do it again.

I would make this recipe again. It made the chicken tender and juicy. I can't say I that it was spicy. In fact I didn't taste any heat it in but I kind of liked that. 

I used fresh garlic and fresh onion and marinated the chicken for close to two hours. 

I received a lot of compliments when I served this at a bbq we had for father's day.

I chose the recipe as an alternative to a sweet/salty marinade.  It allowed the subtle flavor of the veggies to come through.

I followed the recipe, however extended the marinade process to 4 hours. I thought the flavor was OK, but did not really permeate the meat.  The surface chill flavor was very prominent.

Wonderful, the only thing I did differently is that I had very large thick chicken breast so I marinated those over night and I marinated the vegetables and pineapples in another ziplock bag over night and grilled them 
I had several relatives over they all loved the chicken and grilled vegetables, I tripled the recipe for the chicken and doubled it for the veggies, I used yellow squash, zucchini, red and green bell peppers, red potatoes and fresh pineapples

I’d give this more than five stars if I could, as long as you use slightly more lime juice.  The chicken tastes fantastic, plus it’s very moist (even if you leave the chicken on too long).  Be careful about changing the recipe though. I’ve made it twice.  The first time I put in too much lime juice (plus I added zest).  The second time I used 1.5 times the amount listed and no zest; that was perfect. The size of limes varies widely, so I recommend a taste test. I used 1/2 tsp of red pepper and fresh garlic. I also prefer chipotle chile powder to regular chili powder.  Finally, if you love it as much as I did, consider making a recipe for six for four people (6 oz chicken/person).

4.14.18  I wouldn’t rate this as bad, but I also wouldn’t rate this as good.  There simply wasn’t much flavor in these kabobs, even serving them with a wedge of fresh lime on the plate (at least that added some flavor).  This tasted about the same as it would have had I just skewered chicken cubes without marinating.  Just a disappointment.

My entire family loved these.  Even my picky 7 year old.  I served with cous cous and hummus and pita.  Very easy and quick dinner.  Will become part of our rotation!

Awesome recipe.  Made it while camping on Vancouver Island and we enjoyed it very much.  The chicken was tender and juicy with a little kick. Only negative was a slight lemon taste which I think was due to the red wine vinegar. I'll half it next time.  Served with a rice stir fry and it was great.

I had planned to grill these kabobs but due to weather conditions, I turned it into a stir fry.  I followed the recipe then added a dash of Worchestershire sauce and a bit of brown sugar as I like a little sweetness with the heat. I browned the chicken in two separate batches, removed from pan,then stirfried peppers, onions, yellow squash and mushrooms. I then added the marinade and brought to a simmer til hot,  added the chicken back in and served over brown rice quinoa combo. It was delicious. Will try for kabobs again using the same veggies and maybe pineapple chunks.

It was great as it was written.   My son cooked them on the grill and we had some Tai chili dipping sauce for dipping while eating along with some Jasmine Rice that also tasted great with the dipping sauce.  All the small pieces of chicken got crispy edges but were moist inside.  A keeper

VERY GOOD EASY.  Followed all marinating  ingredients. 
3 hours. We both enjoyed. Although we  love  Soy Sauce
marinades this was very good for the change. The chili 
paprika and lime were noticeable. Spicy and a tiny hot. 
Nice change ,,make again.

This is an awesome recipe. Save a very small amount of marinade, and just before grilling, throw a bunch of cut up veggies in a bag with the marinade for a light coat of flavour. I put onions, peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini on mine, along with pieces of farmer sausage. Great combination!

While the chicken was very tender, it mostly tasted of lime. Next time I'd decrease the lime juice and up the garlic and spices.

Tasty dish. I doubled the marinade, added the zest of one lime & juice of two and a half limes; the flavour was wonderful just not spicy enough for me (I added plenty of extra heat too), next time will try adding fresh chillies. I marinaded the chicken for 24 hours & added red, green & yellow peppers, mushrooms, pineapple and red onion about 3 hours before cooking. I broiled it all and served with coconut & lime rice that's also on here. Can't wait to try again & tweak some more. Thanks :)

Very tasty grilled chicken with this marinate. I marinated it over night. I know most people would think spicy because of the chili powder but it wasn't.

Was simple to make and fabulous to eat.  I didn't make kabobs, but used chicken breast.  They were thin pieces similar to tenders.  The chicken probably marinated about 5 hours and was very intense in flavor.  I did use two limes and probably more fresh garlic than the powder garlic called for in the recipe.  Those were the only changes that I made.  We just loved the flavor.  I was looking for something like a margarita chicken without the carbs.  This was totally it.

Definite keeper! I made a double recipe with 4 chicken breasts and veggies. My wife typically does not like anything that even looks like a Mexican recipe. But this one had no cilantro or cumin so we tried it, a real hit. I used 1/8 tsp Cayenne pepper and 1/8 tsp of black pepper and 1/2 tsp salt for the double batch. It had just a  little heat and was yummy. Checkout the available video, it help to complete the recipe.

Very tasty and so easy! My whole family enjoyed the tang of this dish. We don't all enjoy spicy food, so I left the chili out. Also we didn't cut it into small pieces for skewers and used the whole chicken tender instead. We will definitely be making this again!

This marinade is really good! I tripled the recipe to make sure that I had enough to flavor all of the veggies (peppers, red onion, mushrooms and grape tomatoes) and the chicken. I did add a tbls. of honey to to add a touch of sweetness this time but don't always add it.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe! I altered it a little bit to fit an idea I had, but used all the same ingredients in the recipe.  I made whole chicken breasts instead of kabobs and once they were grilled I added a little extra lime and some shredded cheese and broiled it until the cheese was melted.  I put the chicken breast on a bed of the multi colored salad topping tortilla strips with a side of steamed broccoli!  Yumm!

All the teenage boys liked this marinade.  A little spicy so may reduce the chili powder next time!  I also agree with others that next time that I would add more lime .

Love that this is a 1 hour marinade.  Threw it together in 5 minutes as baby was waking up from a nap.  I went a little easy on the spices and did not have onion powder.  We skewered it up with onions and fresh pineapple chunks (but on separate skewers b/c my husband always insists meat & veggies have different optimal grill times) and served with basil couscous (from a box).  It was a really great meal.  Chicken was very tasty and moist inside.  I will make it again and go full spice.  thanks!

Pretty good marinade!  I loved the lime flavor in this.  I only marinated my chicken for about an hour.  So I could of marinated longer to achieve a stronger flavor on the chicken, but it still gave it nice flavor.  I did use smoked paprika in place of the paprika to give it a nice smokiness.  I didn't taste much of the "chili" flavor in this.  So maybe in place of the chili powder it would be good to use a good chile sauce or I think this would be great with chipotle pepper powder in place of the paprika or part of the chili powder as well.  I love chipotle and lime together.  I do think next time I will use minced garlic in place of the garlic powder, add the zest of a lime, and some cilantro.  At the end of cooking I would also squeeze a lime over top of the chicken and garnish with more cilantro and I think this would make it a 5 star recipe for us!  I used bell peppers, onions, and pineapple to skewer along with the chicken, and served with spanish rice and stewed tomatoes.  Made a great meal.  Thank you for the recipe!

this was absolutely delicious. I have very VERY picky eaters and they gobbled this up. I doubled the recipe, but I used 6 tbsp lime juice instead of 4 (3 limes instead of 2). that was the only change. This is going into my printed recipe book!

This was wonderful!!! The only thing I  added was 1 teaspoon of fresh chopped lemon thyme I had in my herb garden. I love using fresh herbs.  Also, I used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Hubby  said to make sure I keep this one!

I skipped the cayenne and they were mild but flavorful. Doubled the spices and marinated about 8 hours. Update. Added 1/2 t each cumin and oregano. Used chipotle chili. The marinade is Hot! We will see how they turnout..

Very easy to make.  Grilled chicken tenderloins.  Used more lime (at least 3 for 1 lb) because I like it seasons food.  I also left it overnight for it to get more flavor.

Everyone liked these. I did add more lime then called for after a taste test of the marinade, but that's all related to personal taste and the quality and freshness of your limes. I love the ease of prep in this as well. Will definitely be making again.

My family loved this recipe. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I substituted balsamic vinegar and it was delicious. I added about a teaspoon of salt and 5 turns of a pepper mill. I used 2 lbs. of chicken breast tenders and cooked on the stovetop in a tablespoon  of crisco. I added a little water after 10 minutes to prevent burning. I also only marinated for 5 minutes since I was short on time. I will definitely make these again.

This is a tasty marinade.  Even my hard to please hubby liked it. I let the marinade set for about 4 hours.  I  will use this again on not only skewers but any grilled chicken.

It was just okay. It really had no taste to it, kinda bland. I think the red wine vinegar is the culprit. I only added a 1/2 tbsp. instead of what it asked for. You have to be careful when you cook with vinegar, it will kill the rest of the flavor that you are trying to achieve.

Delicious!  Thank you, simmig! The recipe didn't specify on the type of chili powder or paprika, but I used Chimayo chili powder and sweet paprika in case it's helpful to anyone.  Used boneless/skinless chicken breasts pounded to even thickness, marinated in the fridge for about an hour in zip-top bag and grilled. Will be doing kabobs in the near future.  This will be a go-to recipe!

I think this would be much better with chunks of sweet onion and zucchini thrown in with the capsicum. The marinade would need to be doubled, however. Oh, what a shame! Will make and probably give a higher score once eaten!

This was "OK." Not terrible but certainly nothing to rave about. FYI, do NOT marinate your chicken for more than a few hours. It will begin to break down due to the acidity from the vinegar and lime juice "cooking" your meat as it marinates! I marinated my chicken for about two hours and when I started to thread it onto my skewers, I noticed the texture was beginning to change. Maybe this will float your boat, but this did nothing for me. Thanks anyways, simmig.

Recipe was tasty but author suggested marinating for more than an hour to get more from it. I don't marinate for an hour as lime juice can "cook" your chicken.

This was yummy! I made it on a busy day, so I didn't have time to cut the chicken into pieces for kabobs, but turned out great leaving the breasts whole. Thank you for the recipe!

I used this to marinade prawns and it was excellent. I made a slight variation by adding 1/4 teaspoon of sugar and a 1/4 teaspoon of ground mustard. I did this because the sauce seemed a little bitter. Those additions did the trick. Great marinade. When grilling, I used a spoon to cover each side of the shrimp as it grilled.

Not as spicy as I anticipated, but that was okay with me because I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to heat. I'll probably marinate it longer next time, because it was a little on the dull side, but great potential.

this was very tasty.. had to use the bottled lemon juice b/c we didn't have any citrus in the house.. didn't add extra salt.. but wish i would have.. i just salted the chicken after they were cooked.. we made it in the wok b/c we were also out of charcoal.. (we need to go to the store).. ty for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: made this again and this time all but omitted the oil, upped the red wine vinegar to 2 tablespoons, used 2 fresh cloves of garlic in place of the garlic powder, and added the zest of the lime that i actually used this time.. i also added 1.5 tsp of kosher salt.. this was even more amazing than before.. ty again for this awesome recipe

I used this as a marinade for chicken breast that I cut into chicken strips and grilled.  This would make good chicken tacos, enchiladas etc.  Everyone enjoyed the flavor.

Fantastic. Because of the taste & the time it takes to make this, it's totally my go-to recipe for chicken (& it's also great for pork). The meat is surprisingly tender for such a short marinade time.

This was awesome! Made it just like the recipe said. I was a little concerned there wasn't enough marinade, but it turned out to be fine. Marinated for 1 1/2 hours and grilled. Did not make kabobs. Used chicken breasts. Served it with lime rice and sauteed green beans.

This was sooo good.  I used juice of one large lime, used fresh garlic (vs powder).  Marinated for about 4 hours.  Easy and delicious.  Had leftover chicken and ate it cold the next day for lunch.  Was THAT good!

I made these more in a satay style rather than kabobs.  Pounded the chicken to an even thickness, sliced into strips and threaded onto bamboo skewers.  I think I used cider vinegar and bottled lime juice, but didn't change much other than that.  We all liked it a lot.

My chicken was absolutely yummy - very flavourful and moist! I marinated boneless chicken breasts overnight and instead BBQed them whole. This was a perfect blend of ingredients - just the right amount of spice with a hint of lime. I have now added this to my Keeper box!

I made this last night - my husband grilled them - and this is such a delicious way to marinate chicken breasts! I doubled the recipe, added a bit more lime juice and, really, it will be a staple in our house through the end of autumn. TRY THIS!

Doubled the recipe and marinated both vegetables and chicken in separate containers for appx 4 hours. Used red onion, zucchini, mushroom, red pepper as vegetables. Served it with quinoa. Definitely a repeat recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe!! I followed it to a "T" and let it marinate for several hours before grilling.  The chicken is so tender and flavorful.  I have made several times already this summer.  I skewer the chicken with zucchini, mushrooms, yellow squash and red bell peppers that I mariate in Kraft Greek Vinaigrette dressing.  Soooo yummy!

The taste was a bit too vinegar-y. Next time, I think I'll use a little less vinegar and a little more lime juice. The only change I made was using bottled lime juice, as I don't have a juicer, so that might have had something to do with it. I also marinated yellow peppers, which I highly recommend.

We have made this quick and easy dish several times and have served it for guests. Delicious!

I use boneless/skinless thighs and it turns out moist and tender.

Made for a get together and everyone loved them! I am not a fan of the taste of chicken, this marinade was so good, you didn't focus on the chicken but on the flavors.  I made a few hours prior and let it marinade until we were ready to grill, the flavor was perfect!

I just made this last night and it was amazing! I doubled the marinade and used garlic salt instead of garlic powder (not that I like to change recipes, I just didn't have any on hand). We love the taste of lime, so I went ahead and juiced an extra one to suite our tastes. Left it in the fridge to marinate for 4 hours with bell peppers and onions and it was fabulous! I can't wait to try this with shrimp in a stir fry over white rice. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

AWESOME!  I followed the recipe exactly....except I only marinated for 30 mins because I forgot.  I used 1 1/2 TBS of lime juice instead of an actual lime. I used pinneapple chunks with this.  Yum.  Make sure to grill all sides to eliminate pink spots.  I served with mexican corn on the cob found on allrecipes.

I served this chili-lime chicken on kabobs with pineapple chunks for my luau-themed housewarming and they were a huge hit! My friends were helping me thread the skewers and we were all munching before serving the other guests - delish!

The chicken was so tender and flavourful! My family really enjoyed this meal. I usually take the easy way out and buy pre-made kabobs at the store but I will never be able to do that again! I only used 1/2 tsp of Chili Powder but I will use the whole tsp next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Good marinade.  I think I would have preferred it on shrimp.  Not "bland" as many others put it, but not an overwhelming flavor either.  Easy to make!

Really good. I was a little surprised how much flavor it added to the chicken. I doubled the marinade to make sure it coated everything. Will use it again! Even my picky teen loved it.

Loved it!  Didn't change much, just added some lime zest as one other reviewer had mentioned, used two small fresh garlic cloves through the garlic press, and used cider vinegar since I didn't have any red wine vinegar.  Marinated for close to two hours, and the chicken had great flavor all the way through.  Made a little extra marinade to brush on while grilling.  My husband and I really enjoyed this and I will be making it again!!

Loved these!!!  I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours and then added zucchini, mushrooms, yellow squash and some green peppers to the skewers with the chicken.  These were fabulous right off the grill.

Wow!  These were spectacular!  I did double the marinade so I could soak the veggies too (I used green, yellow, and red peppers and a red onion) I also added steak as well.  They came out perfect!  This will be a summer staple in our household from now on!

Delicious! My guests raved about this marinade. I added mushrooms, red and yellow peppers, and onions to the skewers. We didn't have cayenne, so I used a little extra paprika and regular black pepper instead. My guests don't like spicy foods. I would've enjoyed a bit more heat and would add a little tabasco in the absence of cayenne in the future but the taste is great either way. It's a can't miss recipe!

Everyone loved these.  I let them marinate for about 6 hours and they were perfect.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper, but I don't think it made a difference.  These were gone before the steak kabobs were.  A rarity in my family.

I am a big fan of chili-lime flavoring and this was even better than I expected.  I have already made it a few times in the month or so since I came across the recipe.  I made a few modifications based on suggestions from other reviewers and will keep these changes when I make it in the future:  used a fresh clove of minced garlic v. garlic powder, added fresh cilantro and doubled the lime juice - then doubled the entire marinade to have enough for veggies too.  DELICIOUS!!

Super easy!  We feed eight for dinner and it is a rare meal that everyone likes it.  This went over BIG!  I have an 8-year-old who will only eat chicken if it is in nugget form.  She tried it and asked for more - twice!  This is a definite do-over for our family.  I prepared it exactly as explained.  Only regret - I didn't prepare enough, everyone still wanted more.

I used this the other night, having marinated the chicken for 48hours, and it was fabulous.  I did my chicken by itself and the veggies in a grill pan, I am saving this one!

Great!  Its even better if you marinate for longer.  I leave it in the fridge for 4-5 hours and it turns out better.

Used only 2 TBSP oil and increased to 2 TBS red wine vinegar. Use juice of 2 limes and you can even scrape the pulp into the marinade. Skipped the cayenne bc even though I love hot, I wanted a more citris flavor. I also tossed in a little pineapple juice bc I was putting pineapple on the skewers. Very light and delicious.

I use this marinade for boneless, skinless chicken thighs on the grill.  Use a fresh garlic clove rather than garlic powder and omit the salt.  Very easy, and great flavor without making kabobs!

This recipe was great.  I made it for a family BBQ and everyone wanted the recipe.  I marinated the chicken over night, it was very tender and delicious!!! I wanted more of a kick to it though. Next time I'll add more hot stuff and throw in some hot sauce!

I have prepared this two times:  I tried once with a 1 hour marinade, and a second time with a 24 hour marinade.  The longer marinade time produced an excellent dish.  I added 1/4 tsp of coriander to the marinade as well.  I will make this again.

My husband and I really liked this dish. I'm not a huge fan of grilled veggies so I marinated the chicken breasts and my husband grilled them whole. I think next time I'm going to double to recipe and let it marinate longer than just an hour. Some people found the original recipe spicey, but I don't think I could even taste the cayenne pepper. Overall: wonderful and quick Served with: lemonade, spanish rice, and steamed broccoli

this was good base recipe.  made skewers out of chicken breasts sliced in half to thin it out instead of kabobs so they cooked quickly.   added water because the marinade seemed too thick and I added a bit too much cayenne.  added about 2 tbsp of honey to balance out the flavors and tweaked it to taste.  marinated for about 5 hrs. delish.  will use the stove top grill for the pieces too thin or small for the skewer.

Excellent. My friends raved over this. I marinated for about 4 hours, and cooked under the broiler in my oven. The chicken was juicy, the taste was great, and the pineapple was the best part. The only thing I changed was I added a bit extra red wine vinegar and garlic powder, but I think that's because I used too much lime juice.

My husband and son loved it.  I added some smoked paprika since I did not have any cayanne pepper.  It was great on our grilled chicken breasts.  Next time I will try the kabobs.  Thank you!

Oh my!  This was fanstastic! I marinated the chicken as suggested but set aside a bit of the marinade to baste onto the kabobs while they were grilling.  It was delicious!!

Love it!!!! I used the Chicken Tenders instead of the Chicken Breast. Marinate it for 4 hours and they were perfect for grilling. The chicken was very tender and the taste was delicious :)

I followed the recipe exactly; these were ok, seemed like they were missing something, I felt they needed a stronger flavor or perhaps a basting sauce.  After eating I asked my family if they would want me to fix this again and they all said "it was ok, nothing special" so, I probably will not be fixing these again.

Sorry but we were not big fans of this recipe.  Followed directions to a "T" but we did not like the marinade at all.  Could taste the lime but that was about all.

This was tender and juicy. I wish it had a stronger flavor. I marinated this overnite too. I made a dipping sauce with low fat mayo, lime juice and chili powder, thinned with a  little vegetable stock it it gave this more flavor. I'll try this again maybe with some cayenne added.

Amazing!  Maybe the best thing I've ever made.  Great flavor, it made me over eat for the first time in months.  It was the first time I've ever made a Kabob, so some of the chicken was under cooked, maybe I'll cut it in smaller pieces next time.  I used sweet onion, red, orange, yellow peppers and mushrooms.  I didn't have onion powder, so i used seasoning salt.  I served it with plain old white rice.  Cant wait to make it again.

Really good marinade!  I cooked 1/2 of the chicken after marinating 2 hours and then cooked the rest of it the next day - BIG DIFFERENCE!!!  Definitely let it sit overnight.

This recipe is impossible to mess up! The chicken turns out super moist and juicy if you cook it on low. I also sprinkled the vegetables with some seasoning salt. No leftovers, and I am thrilled on how healthy this recipe is for you!

I was looking for something different to bbq some chicken breasts so I thought I'd try this. It was pretty good. For some reason, the red wine vinegar threw me off, but I still enjoyed them. I think I'll scale back on that a bit the next time. Very tasty otherwise:)

I LOVE this chicken! We added just a little bit more chili powder for a little kick and it turned out great.

This was a very good recipe.  I added a few dashes of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Awesome!!!!  Great summer grilling recipe.

I didn't care for this at all.  All I got was heat and lime.  I worked with the taste (added white sugar, a little soy, a little dijon mustard) and it rounded out the flavors a bit more.  Sorry, I really wanted to like this recipe:(

We loved these.  I made an extra batch of the marinade to brush on them while they were on the grill.  Next time I will double the extra batch, because it was not enough.  I made Lime cilantro rice from this site to go along with it.  Very Yummy!!

Absolutely delicious!  Very flavorful.  I followed exactly expect for adding one more lime and I marinated overnight.  The flavors blended very nicely, the red wine vinegar and lime were in the background not overpowering at all.  Skewered with red and green bell peppers and onions. Kids kept coming back for more and hubby couldn't get enough.  Will make again.

Just made this for Memorial Day BBQ. I used both lime and lemon juice because I quadrupled the recipe and I didn't have enough limes. I marinated the chicken chunks over night then skewered them the next morning with pineapple chunks, red onion, red and orange bell peppers. These grilled kababs were soooo good !

These kabobs were the hit of my bbq.  They were put on skewers with colorful pepers and cherry tomatoes.  I used Big Al's KC Bbq sauce from this site to base them while cooking.  Unbelieveably good.  Will make again and again.  Thanks Christine for a great recipe.

This recipe is so yummy!!!  I actually marinaded for about five hours so the chicken was very flavorful.  It's the perfect amount of spicy, not too spicy  for the kids, but just enough kick for the grown ups.

This recipe is a keeper. My only complaint is that my wooden skewers didn't hold up so well, despite soaking. I already picked up a set of metal ones because I do intend to make this again. I followed the recipe exactly and marinated for about 5 hours. I chunked up zucchini and red bell pepper, marinated briefly in EVOO, salt and pepper, skewered them separately from the meat and served everything with Brazilian White Rice from this site. Delicious!

Another keeper!  For those reviewers who say they are not getting any flavor - I just don't see how that is possible.  If you like this recipe you should also try "Spicy Grilled Chicken" on the site.

delicious. I used 1/4 tsp of cumin, omitted the onion powder because I didnt have any on hand, added cayenne pepper and instead of red wine vinegar I used Balsamic because it was all I had. Marinated for 2 hours and broiled in the oven for 15 minutes. Perfection!

not at all what I expected after reading the reviews. I stuck to the recipe except for leaving out the cayenne. Just pretty blah, I dont think the cayenne would have improved it dramatically. Oh well, better luck next time.

This was more spicy than flavorful, it got mixed reviews at my house. I added pineapple, onions, bell peppers, zucchini, & cherry tomatoes to the mix - yum! (But had to make more marinade to cover all the added ingredients of course.)

These are great - packed with flavor and still healthful.  I doubled the recipe - the leftovers are great in the asian chicken salad recipe on this site... I serve this over black ben corn couscous - recipe on the site as well - it complements the flavors perfectly.

Followed this recipe exactly, except we used 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Marinated for an hour and then grilled.  The chicken was very moist and the flavor was very good.  I would have liked a little bit of a stronger flavor, which probably would have happened if we had marinated smaller pieces.  I enjoyed the flavor but it didn't blow me away (hence the 4 stars).  Overall though, this is a great, easy marinade that can be served with variety of side dishes.  Will most likely use this again!  Thanks!

Boy howdy let me tell you.  I marinated chicken tenders in this marinade tonight.  I also marinated the other half of the tenders in a different recipe from this site.  THE FLAVOR OF THIS ONE IS AMAZING!!!  The other was ok, and probably good by itself, but next to this one, NO CONTEST!!!  I will make this again soon.  It had great flavor and it was moist.  ENJOY!!!

i marinated the chicken for a couple of hours but they still had not enough flavor for my tastes (i think these would be better with fresh garlic and onions). Next time i will marinade overnight. Thread fresh pineapple and cherry tomatoes on the skewers.

I don't know what I did wrong, I followed the recipe as written expect for using lime juice as opposed to a fresh lime and cooking it on my stove and not grilling, but this recipe was really bland.  It wasn't good or bad, it was just plain chicken in my opinion.  If I made this again I would spice it up more, and I don't even like a lot of spice.  This was like grandparent cooking bland.

Quick and easy and very tasty. We've had it with the chicken threaded onto skewers as the recipe calls for, as kebobs and just marinated chicken breasts grilled. I usually try and marinate the chicken for 2-3 hours, but is still good if you have less time.

The chicken was tender but I was expecting a lot more flavor from the thickness of the marinade.  My boyfriend really liked it but I thought it was just okay.

My family did not care for this chicken. I followed the recipe exactly, but broiled the kabobs. The flavor was dominated by the lime.

I really wasn't impressed with this recipe.  I used 3 TBS of lime juice.  All I could taste was the paparika.  I couldn't taste any lime.  I would not make it again.

This is the best ever recipe for marinade!  The first time I tried this was for a large BBQ at my house and used chicken chunks for kabobs, everyone loved how juicy the chicken after hours in a warming dish! Now I use it as a great marinade for chicken breast.  I've mastered the recipe and it's so easy! If I cook, I'm always rushed in the am to get out of the door, but this recipe is so simple to throw together, I'm never late for work!  My MOTHER IN LAW even raved about it.  Whew...

i have made these 3 times in the last two weeks for different people and they are amazing. I don't change anything about the recipe. Although, i dont measure things...but they are GREAT!!

I let the chicken marinade overnight so the flavor is absorbed. I always do that no matter what the recipe calls for. The results are always much better.

Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent!  Marinated the chicken breasts about 8 hours then grilled and served whole.  I softened some butter and mixed in some chili-garlic paste and lime juice to top the chicken as it came off the grill.

Loved it! I didn't grill the chicken, but I braised it in a cast iron skillet with garden tomatoes and brussels sprouts - it was so good I don't know if I will bother to grill it.

My family's favorite summer recipe! We add more colorful veggies as well and while cooking, sprinkle season-all salt to give it a teeny bit more flavor. Healthy, pretty, and so so yummy!

These did not have as much flavor as I had hoped.  The chicken was nice and tender after marinating about 4 hours, but, needed some kind of sauce to go with the rice.

I didn't make this on the grill, because we ran out of fuel. I marinated onions, green and yellow squash, peppers along with the chicken for only 1/2 hour.  It was fabulous!  The vegtables were just as tasty as the chicken.  I cooked it in a non stick skillet and I got rave reviews from all my family.

I made extra marinade for bell peppers and onion.  I also had pineapple but I didn't marinade it.  I had too much food for my skewers so I cooked the rest in a skillet and ate it over rice.  The skillet version just wasn't as good.  Maybe because I ate that as reheated left overs.  The grilled version was very good.

Instead of making kabobs, I used boneless, skinless chicken breats for this recipe.  I marinated them for about an hour and then cooked them on the grill.  They turned out great, and I'll definitely make this one again.  Thanks!

I used this marinade for shrimp kabobs and it was fantastic!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't tried it with chicken.

Very juicy and tender!  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I added 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp red wine.  I also added some fresh chopped cilantro and a small diced hot pepper.
Easy to make and full of flavor!

My wife and I liked this recipe very much. Will definately make it again. I marinated the chicken overnight, it had a very bold flavor, and that's what we like.

Happy Grilling!!

Tried these last night with chicken tenders and they were really good.  Somewhat of a Mexican taste. I did not make kabobs just cooked them on the grill.  Served grilled summer squash and eggplant with them for a quick Saturday night supper.

We made these for a graduation party and they were awesome. I did add the zest of one lime and went light on the cayenne. Marinated for about 5 hours. Everyone loved them.

This recipe was a huge hit!  We loved it.  I left out the cayenne pepper because I was afraid it would be too spicy for my kids, but I am going to add it next time.

I made this recipe for my baby shower. Everyone loved it. I only got a few pieces even though I made over 15 pounds of chicken! I thought maybe it had too much red wine vinegar but everyone else said it was perfect. I'll be making it again this weekend for the 4th of July.

Wonderful flavor.
This marinade imparts a flavor similar to tandoori.  It was even yummy the next day served cold in pitas with toppings.
Yummy!

Nice and easy marinade! I used 1 clove fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and left out the onion powder because I didn't have any. I also tossed in about a Tbsp of honey to counter the chili and lime flavor. I was also out of red wine vinegar so I used white wine and marinated the chicken breasts for about 2 hours. It came out good, but the flavor was very subtle. I usually like a stronger flavor on grilled chicken but it was definitely good. I did leave it a bit too long on the grill (a bit dry) so maybe a shorter cooking time would leave a stronger chili-lime flavor. I'd love to try it again and add jalepenoes. Served the chicken with veggies on the grill and also red potatoes that were boiled and then finished on the grill as well. Very nice!

Loved this recipe, it was delicious! I doubled the marinade though and added my veggies to it, to sit for about 1 and a 1/2 hours. Veggies I added were tomatoes, onions, mini potatoes, and one of each color of bell pepper. I also lightly oiled the bbq as suggested by someone else, and they turned out great. I will definately be maing this one again...yummy and so easy!

This chicken was okay but I was a little disappointed.  I really thought it would be more flavorful and I used all the ingredients indicated.  Doctored, I would give this a better rating, but for the amount of ingredients I put into this, I was expecting something else.  I don't think I'll make this again.

We were a little dissappointed in this recipe.  It just wasn't nearly as good as expected.  It was good, but somewhat bland.  I might try it again, but add more spices and marinate it longer.

I was disappointed these didn't have as much lime flavor as I was hoping for.  I also thought they were a little dry even though I put some pineapple chunks on the skewers with the chicken.

Hooray! I found something for my fussy carnivoir son-in-law. he likes savory meats without the confusion of veggies, which is crazy considering that he married my vegitarian daughter, and this meal hit all his buttons! the kabobs were tangy, juicy, and got me some serious kudos from Dan the Man! I served these with taboolie and garlic green beans.

I really had zero expectations for this recipes, I could not think of anything to make and I chose this last minute. Some mods I made to the marinade was that I had no onion powder so I just added in more garlic powder, I also added in 1 tsp chili garlic paste for more chili flavor. I marinated the chicken for 4 hrs and put it on skewers with green pepper and onions and grilled it. When I put the first piece in my mouth I was wowed! I was not expecting such a wonderful melody of flavors. It had great chili flavor with a hint of lime. Although you don't really need any sauce it good on its own,  I found that Thai Spicy dipping sauce took it to a whole other level. Everyone else liked this too, I will definitely make this again, plus is that all the ingredients are ones you will find in your cupboard typically! Served this with tossed romaine orange salad & greek pasta salad, both from this site.

My husband and I loved these! I doubled the marinade, and added in red onions and mushrooms. Marinated about 2 hours, but when I was threading the skewers my veggies were definitely falling apart. Grilled in the Foreman Grill for about 4 minutes apiece, and served with pasta. Will definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe. I actually use it to marinade pork loin, then roast it in the oven and serve with fresh lime wedges. For an extra kick, I throw in a few red pepper flakes.

We really enjoyed this.  Nice change of pace from the bottled marinades.  The chicken tasted great as leftovers the next day too!

Maybe I didn't use enough lime and chili because our kabobs were perfectly cooked (so a good marinade) but not at all flavorsome. I followed the recipe exactly so wil try maybe some lime zest and extra hot sauce next time.

I was expecting something wonderful and I was disapointed so was my fiance.  The reviews were great, the ingredient list seems good but the flavor just tasted tart not even like lime.  Also the chili, onion and garlic powder seemed to be lost in the over all finished product.

You really don't need to marinade too long.  I had it in the marinade for 5 or 6 hours, and I would have preferred the taste to be a bit more subtle -- which I think was intended by the initial 30 min. marinade time.

Used on Chicken breasts instead of kabobs to see if we'd like the flavor. My husband thought it was a 5, but I didn't. Will probably make again, but not often.

Tasted like regular chicken.  I did marinade it for about 20 min and that could be my problem.  Next time i will marinade it over night.  Overall it was a good recipe.

This had a really good flavor and was a nice departure from the regular italian seasoning marinade. I recommend it for anyone wanting to add some more flavor to their cookout or dinner menu.

The only reason this isn't a 4-star is because the chicken didn't seem to soak up the marinade like the vegetables did, even though I marinated for slightly longer than instructed...still good though!

These were really tasty!  I added red bell peppers, red onions, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes to the marinade and then skewered them as well.  I added fresh minced garlic to the marinade, as I didn't have any powdered.  I will make this again!

I made these up the night before on the skewers with pieces of red onion, chicken, strawberry tomatoes, zucchini and mushrooms and dumped the marinade overtop.  I also used 1 clove of freshly chopped garlic.  They were delicious and came out perfect.

EXCELLENT. This is a regular on our menu.  So easy and delicious. Don't change a thing.  I made this for a dinner party with some picky adult eaters, and they loved it.  I cook my chicken and vegetables on seperate skewers so the chicken is moist, and the veggies aren't burnt.  I also made this using shrimp, but the chicken is our favorite.  I serve this over brown rice or with buttered noodles on the side.

This was a delicious recipe. The chicken was tender, moist and perfectly flavored. I will definitely cook this again. We added a tad more lime juice,  because we really love citrus.

We just made these Kabobs and they were delicious. I didnt put any cayenne pepper (do not care for spicy food), add mushrooms and onions on skewers and grilled on indoor grill. Thanks.

Great flavor.  It was raining the day I made these, so rather than thread them on skewers, I just fried up the pieces of chicken in a non-stick skillet.  Can't wait to try this on the grill.

These were pretty good, but I couldn't taste any of the lime.  I didn't have a fresh lime so I used 1 T. of bottled juice.  Perhaps more juice next time.

So good--these were fantastic.  We used a little extra lime juice since we were at the end of the bottle  anyway and marinated for around 2 hours.  Fantastic flavor!

I thought these were very tasty - a nice blend of spicy and tangy.  They had good flavor and were moist.  I cooked them in the broiler.  I would have liked a bit more of the lime flavor.  Next time I'd add more lime juice than stated.

We had the chicken kabobs over a mexican-style rice.  It was delicious.  We will use the seasoning for fish or steak kabobs next time.  Yummy!

I didn't really think these had much flavour.  I let them marinate for about 3 hours.  Not enough lime, and a bit too much chili.  And I don't know that you need that much oil.  I won't make this again, I was hoping for more.

We really enjoyed these. I let them marinade for about 26 hours, and they were so tasty - not as spicy as I expected, but great none-the-less. The lime flavor was spot-on for us. We had them with Mushroom Kabobs (also from this site) and a salad. Great recipe! Thanks, Simmi!

These weren't bad, but the lime was a little overpowering.  I probably won't make these again, but they were worth trying.

Good chicken.....grilled and was very flavorful. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours. I think I was expecting more heat from the chili powder and cayenne. I would have prefered more heat..next time I will increase the HOT spices. Nice flavor...just wanted a little more kick...maybe will add some hot red pepper flakes! Served with Black-eyed Pea Salad on this site.

These always turn out very tender and juicy. I use minced garlic, red pepper flakes and white vinegar and serve them with grilled peppers and mushrooms.

It was ok - I used the George Foreman grill and maybe that's why it wasn't great? Probably just personal preference though.

I think it could have used a bit more chili powder, but then again, I like my food pretty spicy.  Very yummy recipe and will definitely use again.

A Keeper. I used the juice of three limes (they weren't very large) and was glad I did - don't think using one lime would have been enough.  I also did not add the cayenne pepper and want you to know that this is a "Spicy" dish without it.  I cooked it in the broiler for 8 min on each side adding green peppers, pineapples and onion to the skewers.

This was a great recipe!  We marinated the chicken for about 3 hours and it came out perfect!  It stayed moist and was also very flavorful and had just a little bit of "kick."  We made our kabobs with red onion, green bell peppers and pineapple and served them with rice pilaf... Will definitely make this again!

I marinated onion pieces along with the chicken, and threaded the skewers with chicken, onion, pineapple, and whole mushrooms.  Broiled in the oven since I don't have a grill.  Delicious!  Definitely a keeper!  Serve with the Black Bean & Corn Salad from AllRecipes.

I'm giving the recipe the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars- my husband thought it was all right, but I didn't even want to finish my portion. It was not very flavorful. Since this is our first time doing kabobs, we may not have cooked them exactly right- they were a tad "charred" before they were cooked all the way through, so they ended up being a little dry. Will not make again.

These are awesome!!!! I could eat these everyday during barbecue season. We put cherry tomatoes, zucchini, crookneck squash, red onion, and crimini mushrooms on there as well, brushed with the marinade, and serve over white rice. Simply wonderful!

These kabobs didn't thrill me.  They were better than plain chicken and attractive to look at but didn't really pack the flavor I was hoping for.  Perhaps because I didn't have fresh lime but rather lime juice and didn't use enough.

These were pretty good. There was more of a chili taste than lime taste. Next time I will add more lime. But my husband wants more chili taste because he expected more of a kick. Next time I'll play around more with the seasonings. But as is, it's pretty good.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  The taste was too bland.  It definitely needs more lime juice and even some other seasonings to give it more of a kick.  I tried it on chicken and shrimp.  The shrimp turned out terrible. Would not try it again.

Great Flavor! I used chicken tenders instead of cubed chicken and it was a big hit!  Don’t marinade for more than a few hours or the tenders will become mushy and mealy.

This recipe is delicious! I use a little more lime juice to give it more tang, and I marinate it for as much time as possible. The chicken is moist and flavorful. I will definitely make this again!

I too increased the lime juice (doubled).  I marinaded and grilled the chicken breasts whole.  It was fantastic!  This is a must try recipe.

These were very good!  I used extra lime as suggested by previous users and it was perfect.  I used chicken strips and threaded them on the skewers - less chance of the chicken drying out.  Oh, and I added some Tabasco for extra heat.  Yummy.

My guests really liked these and so did I.  I marinated a couple of hours and you could really taste the flavors.  Highly recommend.

These were sooooo good.  I made these on my George Foreman, it only took about 5 minutes and to my skewers I added onions and green peppers.  I will make this over and over again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This has by far become our favorite summer recipe.
We did chop up a few jalapenos for extra kick and always make a few extra kabobs for the single ladies at our apt. building.  They rave!

This marinade is excellent - I used extra lime to make it even more tangy.
