I used this recipe for method only, essentially, and it worked wonderfully.  It was very convenient to put all on a large baking sheet, flip once, and be done with it.  My quesadillas did not include green peppers, barbecue sauce or Cheddar cheese.  Rather, I used thinly sliced onion, sliced mushrooms and shredded Provolone cheese on smaller tortillas.  I seasoned my shaved steak with a little of Emeril's BAM seasoning and garlic powder.  After cutting the quesadillas into wedges, I served them with horseradish cream sauce and honey mustard on the side.  WOW!

I made serious quick changes. I used frozen peppers and onions from the supermarket freezer section and steak um. Talk about quick and delicious! Minimal clean up. Enjoy! I also served it with salted sour cream. Just a few dashes on dollop. Oh and I didn't use BBQ sauce because that's not true Philly and you need two baking sheets if you don't own a baking sheet twenty inches wide like me.

Delicious.  I used provolone and Monterrey jack instead of cheddar.   I didn't use any BBQ sauce.   I marinated the steak with olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and steak seasoning for a few hours .

I made a lot of alterations,  but it's a great concept. Thank you for the idea.
I had left over steak and didn't know what to do with it, until I found this recipe. 
I sautéed onion, red and green pepper, and mushrooms.  Add left over steak sliced into thin strips. A dash of hot sauce and a dash of bbq sauce, since I didn't have steak sauce. Let sit at a simmer.
Sprayed pam on foiled sheet, put down a shell, sprinkled cheddar, added fill, sprinkle more cheddar,  place top layer of shell, brushed with olive oil. Baked 425 for 8 min, flip brush olive oil, bake 5 min.
Used a pizza cutter to slice.
Delish!

This was delicious and did not take too long to make. It seemed more barbecue though than Philly cheesesteak.

Skip the barbecue sauce. I’m from Philadelphia. A Philly cheesesteak doesn’t have barbecue sauce. I also recommend yellow American cheese instead of provolone.

Followed other suggestions and did not use BBQ Sauce. Added about a table spoon of Worcestershire Sauce and a sprinkle of Lawry's Seasoned Salt. Turned out really good. Did it both with Shredded Cheddar and Provolone Slices.

I added banana peppers and used provolone instead of cheddar. We really liked it. I'm not a fan of mushrooms but I think that would be a good addition as well.

Great comfort food. I will make it again, but not on a regular basis. Carbs way high . . . but so was the taste!

These were really good but I baked them for 11 minutes (not 15) and they were very dark. i think 8 minutes total would be perfect. Maybe it was them being whole wheat that caused the problem. Also, I only could get 3 made, not 4.

Very tasty.  Used a local marinade for the meat instead of bbq sauce.  Used colby jack cheese and buttered the outside of the tortilla shells so they would get crispy.  My husband liked it a lot!

Delicious but cook at a lower oven temp or only 7 minutes, flip, and then 1 minute.

I used Jack Daniels no. 7 barbecue sauce, it did well except it over powered some of the other ingredients.  When I went to go flip the quesadillas they had stuck to the aluminum foil that I had used to reduce clean time. I would just use a pan with some cooking spray next time.

I changed the cheese to 4 state cheddar and added oil when placing the meat into the pan WARNING Do not add oil as it makes the pan fill with liquid. I had to allow the meat to cook longer than normal to remove some of the liquid. My step father ate two quesadilla while my mother and I ate only one. Needless to say this is a barbecue lovers dream and I would cook again in a few months so our pallets will be refreshed and ready to try it again.

Delicious and easy. Kids loved them. I sliced the meat inti thin strips after cooking and seemed to be easier to eat.

First time making quesadillas. These were easy and tasted great.
