This recipe isn't about fast and easy, it is about making a good chicken dish.  This is an excellent dish for when you have some time in the kitchen.  I didn't read the recipe really well the first time I made it, so I kept the chicken on the bone.  I've done it the other way, but my husband and I prefer it with my mistake.  On the bone keeps the chicken moist and while messy makes a good meal.

this is a really interesting tasting recipe.  Tastes slightly like Indian, slightly Chinese chicken.  The addition of the rosewater added a high note.  Subbed nutmeg for mace, and also added a piece of the orange rind for a more intense orange flavor.  It seemed a shame to let the fruit go to waste so I processed the entire thing in my foodprocessor (only tossed out the rind)to get more intensity from the clove and peppercorn.  On its own, the sauce does not have a great flavor but somehow when added to the chicken, it was a really great taste so don't give up until you've tried the final product.  I rarely make a dish without onion or garlic so I did saute 2 cloves of garlic and 1 med. onion halved and sliced along with the chicken and am glad I did; it added to the overall flavor of the dish.  Served this over rice for a really nice different way to make chicken in a snap!  This makes a quick weeknight meal with a different way to jazz up chicken breasts.  Don't forget to add some salt.

All I can say is...WOW!  I didn't have currants on hand, so I subst. raisins and subst. orange blossom water (available at most Arabic grocery stores) for rose water.  My husband couldn't stop raving about this!  A new favorite!

This turned out great!  I made rice to go with it and added some of the currants and cloves while it steamed in chicken broth.  With some toasted almonds on top it made a wonderful accompaniment to the chicken.  Next time I want to try this in the slow cooker and really let the flavors soak in.

Absolutely superb!! I was unable to find currents and instead substituted blueberries. It turned out very nice and was a definite crowd pleaser!! Just wouldn't recommend eating the fruit :)

I found the ingredients interesting....
I couldn't find currents so I used raisins...I didn't have any wine opened so I used apple juice...
My son couldn't stand the smell of the fruit cooking but did like the results...I served it over rice and it was great.

It was decent, but not really enticing enough to make again. Suggest adding veggies with chicken. Changes:  substituted nutmeg for mace, substituted vinegar for wine.

This was not to our taste. We ended up having to eat a ham sandwich for dinner instead.

I don't care if it was from the 14th century, I really liked it! And it wasn't terribly difficult to make. I thought the addition of mace was spot on, especially with the foil of the cloves. I'm going to try it using some rabbit, instead of the chicken, next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Overall great recipe! The fruit flavor was more mild than I expected, but still delicious. I substituted chicken thigh meat since I prefer it over breast, and 1 Tbsp honey in place of the sugar, and threw a piece of orange rind into the cooking fruit as another comment suggested. I served it with rice and put some orange zest in with the rice as it cooked. Just wish I had some sliced almonds to sprinkle on top! This dish creates a lovely aroma in the kitchen. Does anybody have ideas of what to do with the leftover fruit? Seems a waste to throw it out.

This was fabulous.  If you dont want to buy full bags of the dried fruits, get the small amounts from the bulk bins... recipe was not expensive that way  Only issue I had.. not enough sauce double or even triple it

I was a little scared when I smelled the fruit cooking that I wasn't going to like this but it actualy turned out quite good! I replaced the mace with nutmeg and also used raisins and apple juice that where recommended replacements in other reviews. It's sweet but not overwhelmingly so, I'd definetly make this again.

Followed the sauce recipe exactly. Edible and tastes okay, but nothing special. I was sad about the food that was removed from the sauce. It could have been really interesting. Only used half the amount of chicken and was glad about that; it was the perfect amount of sauce for the chicken. If I'd added veggies, there might not have been enough.
