First off, I can't give this five stars because I made a change.   I didn't have any sage so I substituted about 1 tsp of dried rosemary.  I also cut the recipe in half since there was only two of us.   Anyway, it turned out fabulous and my husband couldn't  stop saying how hood it was - which it was.  Another keeper! Thanks.

A solid, 4-star recipe--my only real criticism is that there was not enough sage and zest for two tenderloins.  I divided it in half, and I only had enough to put a very skimpy amount under the bacon.  Using 3 Fuji apples and about 3/4 lb of bacon, I followed directions exactly.  I felt the oven temperature was a bit low to brown the bacon adequately without over cooking the meat.  This had a good flavor, the meat was very tender, and the apples nearly stole the show.  Thanks for posting!

Upped the temp to 425. The bacon would be limp at 380 for the cooking time and I had to cook longer than recommended. Taste was okay, but the "paste" wasn't really a paste and the sage was a little strong.....maybe basil leaves would be a better choice. I think adding a little butter to the paste would better able the mixture to stick to the loin. Presentation wise, very pretty. Loved the apples.

The temperature needs to be higher or you end up with a tenderloin wrapped in half cooked bacon. The taste was good, with both the apple  and citrus flavors coming through. Would make this again.

Delicious and very flavorful!  I added the juice of an extra lemon, 2 grated garlic cloves, and a tablespoon of olive oil to the paste, and cooked it at 425’ for 25 minutes.  Next time, I will cook it 5, or ten minutes less.

I followed the advice in the reviews and upped the temp and broiled at the end, but overall it was still very meh. Not what I’d hoped for. Won’t make again.

Excellent. The lemon and sage gave this a great flavor, and was something I wouldn't have thought to put together myself. Will definitely be making this again!

Cooked it at 425 F for 40 - 45 minutes. Broiled it a bit to give the bacon some crispness. Very yummy.

I should have read the reviews before using this recipe. The oven temperature wasn't high enough, so the bacon was close to raw. The paste needs doubling as well, and, for me, there wasn't enough sage to be able to taste it. Won't make it again.

You don't say how thick to cut tenderloin nor to precook bacon first.

I made a change by putting the bacon wrapped tenderloins on the grill, because I thought I will not have enough control over the meat if I put I together with the potatoes and apples in the oven. This way everything was ready at the same time, the bacon nicely grilled and the tenderloins a little pinkish on the inside. Great combination of flavors.

The only change I made was substituting dry sage, for fresh.  The dish lacked flavor and the bacon didn't crisp up.  I wouldn't make it again.

Very tender and juicy. For two people I used only one tenderloin and reduced the ingredients.

I made this recipe, and was a big fan as well as everyone who ate it. I recommend doubling the recipe for the lemon sage paste, as I found the original amount I had made from recipe was not enough for the amount of pork. I also added more lemon juice than suggested but that is more a preference. Last recommendation would be to use thick cut bacon, and choose a fattier bacon as opposed to leaner, as the fat gives the pork more flavour and prevents it from drying out. Otherwise very good. :)

I followed the recipe and only substituted dried sage for fresh, but it still lacked any noticeable flavor.  The bacon did not crisp, or even completely cook, despite running it under the broiler for a time.  Maybe a period of marinating would help, but I don't plan to try this one again.

Really tasty. The lemon really gives a delicious zing while the sage brings out the savory!
