Delicious! I actually let it sit for 2 months to intensify the raspberry flavor and I am glad I did. I cut the recipe down to 25 and I omitted the water. Why water it down? I also left the fresh raspberries whole and did not strain it. The raspberries are  delicious and you can pour them into your glass for added yumminess. I'm thinking maybe I can bake them in a cobbler?
