These are delicious chocolate cookies filled with surprise flavor chunks. I used a tablespoon size cookie scoop to measure them out. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to use Hershey baking size kisses instead of breaking up the candy bars.

Very unimpressed..looked very unappetizing and taste was strange to say the least .For a cookie they were anything but sweet..only 1 1/2 tbs sugar? I was certain that was a typo but stuck with it and regretted the decision. No one even wanted to eat the cookie dough. We ate 2 and threw the rest away
