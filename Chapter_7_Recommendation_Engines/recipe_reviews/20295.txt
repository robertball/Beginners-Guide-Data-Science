This recipe is a fantastic concept and I will definately be making it again - however with changes.  Next time I will add sugar to the base - I loved the flavour of the nuts but it was just butter and flour - bland.  I normally reduce the amount of sugar in recipes but for this one, definately add sugar.  I will try maybe 1/3 cup of sugar(powdered?).  Or you could use a cheesecake base for this recipe (graham cracker crumbs and butter).
I also didn't have chocolate syrup so used melted dark chocolate instead which tasted really good.
Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper!

this is a great recipe, but I did add 1/3 cup powdered sugar to the crust as others suggested. I also added about 1 tsp of cinnamon to the filling cause that's how I like my latte! I did dissolve the coffee in about 2 Tbs of coffee liquor. I like my coffee! I made mine in a springform pan and it made serving extra simple.  Also made a beautiful presentation, with a little drizzle of chocolate syrup on the plate and a dollop of whipped cream on top.  Everyone was impressed with the looks and even more impressed with the taste.

Great easy dessert but, as one reviewer said it needs a little more punch.  Add about 2 tbsp. of coffee liqueur that does the trick.

This was a GREAT dessert! It was almost like a coffee ice cream. I did take a suggestion and added 1/3 cup sugar into the base and it was absolutely wonderful! I would like to have it everyday!

Great No Egg Recipe. It was the hit of the evening at a shower we had for a group of ladies. Everyone asked for the recipe... thanks for making it so easy.

I just finished testing this amazing dessert!  I added sugar like the others suggested, and it turned out delicious!  I am not a coffee drinker, but I loved the taste of this!  It is like a frozen Starbucks mocha frappaccino.  My husband is taking it to work tomorrow.  I will definitely be making this easy, impressive, yummy dessert again!

This was really easy to put together. It was really delicious. The only thing I found to be a problem was serving . It was difficult to cut and get it out in 1 piece. Everyone came back for seconds anyway!

My hubby said to give it a 4, but I'm going to make to many changes so made it a 3. This was blah I thought & even added more instant coffee as others suggested. My changes areto use my recipe for homemade espresso fudge syrup, use only 1c heavy cream & choc syrup. After that is whipped up I'm going to fold in cool whip. This should make it easier on my arteries & have a lighter, latte flavor. A good starter for those of us who like to experiment.
