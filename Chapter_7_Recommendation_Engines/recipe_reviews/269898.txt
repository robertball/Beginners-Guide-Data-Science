My hubby likes ribs to say the least, and he said these were the best I have ever made. I did kinda make a change to the ingredients ... only because i didnt have any rootbeer. But... i did have "Not Your Father's Rootbeer" on hand. I figured we are both over 21, so no harm. I think the rootbeer flavor definitely makes the difference!
Also, I dont have an instapot,  I have vintage pressure cookers, so I used my Presto fry pan  pressure cooker and set the weight at 15 lbs. I will certainly make this again. Its my new go to for ribs.

Update:  We both liked the flavor so much that I decided to try the same process with chicken.  I cooked both white and dark meat.  I think that the dark meat turned out better as the white meat pieces seemed a little dry.  But, both my husband and I prefer dark meat chicken so that may be the reason for this opinion.  Certainly a very versatile recipe and technique.

It was very tender. Almost too tender. Taste was good but   Iâ€™ll need to tweak it a bit for my family. Overall it was an A+

This is super easy, super quick, and falls off the bone.  First go around I did 30 minutes and it was super tender.  I just did it today and did 35 minutes.  It is falling apart and super tender.  I added 1/2 tsp ginger as well as 1/2 tsp smoked paprika and extra cayenne to mine since we like spicy.  This is going in our regular repertoire.

Very tender and juicy. I did not have root beer and used more beef stock. I also only cooked one rack of ribs. I placed the ribs on a baking pan in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes after applying the Bar-B-Que sauce. The sauce thickened and caramelized. Perfect.
