Veggie pizza is my favorite appetizer.  The one thing that makes this recipe different from others I've made is that it uses vegetable soup mix rather than Italian or ranch dressing. One change I made was only using one 8 oz. cream cheese.  One was creamy enough and covered the entire cookie sheet as I wanted the fresh veggies to shine through, not the cheese mixture.  I topped it with:  fresh spinach, red, yellow, orange & green peppers, red onion, radishes, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, diced tomatoes and a little shredded cheese.  I took this to a beer tasting party, and it was well received.

This is pretty tasty.  I used chopped spinach, green onions, radishes, carrots, and grape tomatoes.  It is a lot doughier than I expected.  Would it work to use only one can of dough and roll it thin?

This "fills" my carb/pizza cravings...we absolutely love it.  The only difference is that I use low fat cheeses: mozzarella, and mild white cheddar; and sprinkle pizza with Italian seasoning and garlic powder

I used sour cream instead of mayo, and ranch dry dip mix instead of veg dip.   Fresh and light

I used Ranch dressing because it was what I had and it was delicious! Took it to work for a "Treat Day" and it was gone by 10:00. Earlier reviews  had mentioned that the crust was too thick or that there was too much cream cheese but I can only guess that the pan they used was too small because I thought the proportions were perfect (and I think my co-workers would agree)!

Loved it! We especially liked the knorr soup mix with the cream cheese, different than the traditional vegetable pizza and everyone loved it better!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This veggie pizza was well-liked at the picnic. Almost completely gone!  The Knorr Veg Soup dry mix was a bit on the salty side. We don't use salt so I really noticed it.  But no one else seemed to feel that way.
I think next time I might use a dry ranch dressing instead.

By far, the best Veggie Pizza I have ever made! My family isnâ€™t a fan of any peppers or radishes. I topped it with shredded carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and green onions. I also added shredded mild cheddar cheese on top. A keeper!

This was wonderful! I used Lipton cup of soup spring veggie seasoning and it was delicious. I did open another packet and added a little more to taste. The flavor is not as zesty as the ranch kind, but definitely a nice savory change up.

We have made vegetable before but I ran across this one with added ingredients and I am glad that I did. The added ingredients made a world of difference in the taste. It was very good. Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Exactly the way vegetable pizza should taste! Perfect recipe.
