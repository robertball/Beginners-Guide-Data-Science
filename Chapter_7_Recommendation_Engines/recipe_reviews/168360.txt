Wonderful! I can't have strawberries, so I substituted other fruit. Also, I'm not very patient, so I cooled it off first in the fridge, then in the freezer (just until cool, not frozen) so I wouldn't have to wait 2 hours. It turned out great! I've been using All Recipes for years now, but this is the first recipe I felt strongly enough about to actually rate and review. This really does turn out just like store bought sorbet - which is getting harder to find in my area. Just what I was looking for!

This was a great way to use up some almost too ripe strawberries. The sorbet was very silky and smooth for the first day and is fairly smooth even 3 days later. I will definitely make this again.

This was LOVELY. I doubled this recipe, used Splenda instead of sugar and I used a mixture of strawberries and blueberries. I don't have an ice cream maker so I froze it in a freezer container until solid, then scooped it back into my blender and re-blended it and then re-froze it. REALLY good, though I think the sweet could be cut back by at least a quarter next time. That's not a deal breaker, though.

This is excellent sorbet!  It does harden after a while in the freezer, but leaving it out for a few minutes restores its softness.  I made mine with only 1/4 cup sugar as the strawberries were perfectly ripe and I don't like terribly sweet.  Yum!

This was fabulous in taste and consistency. You must vary the amount of lemon juice to the sweetness of your berries or fruit. Less sweet berries will require less lemon juice, and I would only use 1.5 Tbsp max, but that is my preference. It does need some, no matter what. Also, you will find that substituting 2 Tbsp of the sugar with 2 Tbsp corn syrup will produce an even silkier texture. And dressing each serving with a small amount of chiffonaded fresh basil not only adds color, but a nice flavor complement as well. Thank you, Dana, for a terrific recipe I will use again and again!

I served this to a dinner party, and was told by people that this was the best sorbet they had ever had! excellent, & easy to boot! note: I didnt use the food processor- I used frozen strawberrys, heated them up, added sugar, & used a pastry blender to mash them up before adding other stuff. awesome!

Great base recipie as is!  I usually add some flavored vodka to prevent the sorbet to be frozen completely, helps when making it without an ice cream machine and flavors can be intermixed.. Watermelon Vodka (about 3 tbs) example.  I used 1/2 fresh lemon and 3 tbsp orange juice in lieu of the cold water cornstarch mix.. Great flavor for a great recipie!

I made this great sorbet in the summer, Its soft, silky, and sweet. But I did use powdered sugar, which made it taste less gridy. Then instead of cornstarch I used arrow-root starch, And just by using those two things its texture and flavor was ten times better! Thanks for the great recipe:)

Delicious!  My only adaptation is to cut the lemon juice in half.  It turns out quite tangy with the 3 tablespoons.

meh.   It was more like frozen jelly than a sorbet to me.  Overly sweet - and the texture was off...   love the idea of this recipe, but it just didn't fly for me.

Love, Love, LOVE it!  My son is allergic to dairy and so we make this as a special treat instead of ice cream, and everyone loves it.  It freezes up light and fluffy in the ice cream freezer.  I'm also looking forward to freezing the mixture into popsicles.

This sorbet is better than a classic version (strawberry puree and syrup with lemon juice). The texture is good, it is smooth, silky, but I can`t say it is very delicious. A little ordinary taste.

Frozen fruity perfection. Made exactly per recipe until the freezing part... I don't have an ice cream maker, so I froze it in a covered glass dish and stirred every 45 min until it looked right. Just... wow.

Delish and so easy. Thank you for sharing! I halved the sugar as my berries were very sweet already. I reduced the lemon as well - I think I used about 2 tablespoons - I added a tablespoon at a time until it tasted to my liking. I also used another reviewer's suggestion for making without an ice cream machine. I froze it in a parchment lined square metal baking pan and then let it thaw a little and ran it through the blender one more time and froze again. Let it thaw a few minutes before serving and it is smooth and tasty! Thanks again!

This is a favorite in my house.  The flavor depends on the quality of the strawberries.  Fabulous berries make fabulous sorbet.  The texture is silky and just plain wonderful.

This is amazing! The taste was tangy and delicious. The color was also pretty. Good way to use fresh picked strawberries. I will make this again, but I think I will try less sugar.

It's a good recipe. VERY sweet if your strawberries are already ripe. I will reduce the sugar next time. Also, I doubled the recipe and it was barely enough for my icecream maker to churn. I will have to make a larger batch next time to have enough to share!

OMG! This recipes tastes so good, and is really easy to make. I bought my first quart of strawberries from the farmers' market and made this delicious treat. I didn't use a ice cream maker, just a shallow square baking pan. I was so eager to try it I kept checking on it in the freezer. I'll be making this all summer.

This is very good.  We made it with white stevia powder instead of sugar.  The Stevia in the Raw packet says that you can use it 1:1 with sugar but don't do it! I've been using stevia for 12 years, and so I used less than 1/2 cup, and it was still a little too sweet.  Still, I would do this recipe again.  Also, I used the recommendation someone else said and blended the frozen puree once.  It turned out really well.

Very good! I thought the Sorbet was going to have a creamier/velvetier texture from the thickening agent in the puree but it didn't. I had to let the Sorbet sit out on the counter for 15 minutes to get it to scoop out nicely.

Delish! My hubby & daughter can't eat any dairy, so I'm always looking for great non-dairy recipes, especially desserts. With fresh strawberries we picked today, it was really easy to make. I didn't have quite enough lemon juice for my double recipe, but it still turned out great.

Excellent!
I would just like to state that if you are using a standard sized home ice cream maker, you probably want to double this.
Also, the recipe works for any mixture of other fruits, my personal favorite being half strawberry, half pineapple. I also add about twice as much lemon juice.
I tend to use one freezer bowl for twenty minutes, then the other for twenty minutes to churn it effectively, but when using only the single recipe, the twenty minutes in one freezer bowl was fine.
Altogether a delicious sorbet, and it freezes more easily than most other recipes I've tried.

Fantastic and super easy. A great way to use up strawberries that would go bad otherwise. My boyfriend is lactose intolerant and he LOVES this instead of ice cream!

Great!! Use basic recipe to use for all  different kinds of fruit. Cooking it with cornstarch makes the difference!

This is the best sorbet I have ever had anywhere!  Made this afternoon after picking strawberries.  delicious!  I doubled up the recipe and will probably make more since I got carried away picking berries! :)

Too sweet for my taste.  My strawberries probably could have been riper.  My husband thought it tasted like frozen strawberry smoothie.  It just wasn't that special.

Pretty tasty!  Mine was tart though so I may have to downplay the lemon and up the sugar ... ?  I used the full amount of lemon, fresh, but used maple sugar instead of white sugar.  I also put flour in instead of cornstarch (can't have corn).  It turned out really yummy from just my freezer but a bit jam tasting.  Consistency was great a couple hours in the freezer; I hope it keeps well in there so it can be my new non-dairy ice cream treat!  Want to try with peaches and raspberries next!

Recpie works as provided, but allows for ajustment for personal taste. Will regularly make this summer with different fruits and fruit combination. Today made Strawberry and Pineapple, fantastic results.

My husband is lactose intolerant so I made this for him for his birthday and he loved it. He liked the texture and the taste of the real fruit. He thought it was light and that it wasn’t too sweet. He said the thing he liked best was that it just tasted so fresh.

The flavor was pretty sweet, and the sorbet using the freezer method became too frozen to enjoy. While trying to thaw it to consume it, we ended up leaving it out too long and it was just liquid again.

This was simple and delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe suggested in the end. Though I started with  1/4 cup of sugar it wasn't sweet enough. It could have been the strawberries.  Taste testing was worth it.  I did end up using the full 1/2 cup of sugar.    I used my ice cream maker and it came out perfectly.

This recipe is fantastic!!!If you don't have an ice cream maker,what I did is mixed it in lemonade,and make sure you serve it cold or else it won't taste so good!
