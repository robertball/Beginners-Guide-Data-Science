So. Delicious! If you like gingerbread cookies or gingerbread anything, this is perfect! I did add the raisins and nuts. Mine was thicker than what was pictured, but oh so good!

This was very good. I used steel cut oats, I like the crunch.

This was very good.  After being refrigerated overnight, it had thickened so I added some heavy cream.  I didn't see it was two servings, but I did manage to eat it all myself.  Next time I'll share or cut the recipe down but I will make this again.  I followed the recipe.  I ate it cold.  I didn't think that would appeal to me, but I did enjoy it.
