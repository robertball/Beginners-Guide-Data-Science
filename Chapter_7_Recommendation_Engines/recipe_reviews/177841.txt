Daughter asked for this.  I used milk instead of water for creamier sauce.  I also used more than called for...a whole soup can of milk.  Served with egg noodles.  Family loved it.

This was okay but nothing great. Followed directions exactly. Won't try again though, too many other recipes to try, why mess with a bland one

It's fast and easy.  Not ground-breakingly delicious, but definitely good and a go-to meal if you need something in a hurry.  Plus, my kid will eat it, and that's always a plus in my book.

5 stars for the chicken, but just the soup and water was way too bland for the "sauce". To spice up the "sauce", I added some dried thyme, sage and a little fresh squeezed lemon juice. Hubby thought it was great. Served with rice pilaf and steamed green beans.

Just okay...the chicken was good, but the sauce tasted too sweet.

This is a starter recipe. 3 stars for the recipe as written. However, when I did tweak it by adding lemon juice (from a real lemon), pepper and chicken bouillon it was pretty good.
