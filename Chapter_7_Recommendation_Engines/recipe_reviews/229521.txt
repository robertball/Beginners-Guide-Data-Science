This was yummy! I really enjoyed the spices...a little hint of ginger, garlic. The gravy was good, too. I find it hard to make pork chops tender and unique. This hit both categories.

My family is not a big fan of pork chops.  Every time they find out that is what's for dinner no one wants to eat.  Tonight this recipes was a big success.  The sauce was superb.  I did not have any heavy cream so i used milk instead. Even though there were no apples in the recipe everyone kept asking if there was.  BRAVO!!!!!

This recipe takes pork chops to another level. This will definitely be added to my list of good home cooking! We ate it for lunch and dinner...every last bite! It was very easy to make, also.

I would have added a photo but it's all GONE! Everyone loved it. I tripled the recipe since I had 3 hungry boys. Probably should have used a bigger pan to bake them in but the biggest I had was a 20". I did have to cook them a little longer. I only used about 1/2 of the leftover flour in the sauce but it was plenty thick. I also mixed the flour with the cream first and then added the liquid to keep my gravy from lumping. The boys even used the gravy on their salad they thought it was so good.Goes really well with rice pilaf.

I had trouble w/the sauce being waaaaay too thick...not actually a sauce, more of a lump, so I would suggest not using ALL of the leftover flour mix....trust your judgement & only use a bit & toss the rest(there was at least 1/2 of the flour mix leftover). I wasn't exactly impressed w/this at first but found myself going back for another bite & another bite & another bite. Leftovers were not good so eat it up fresh!

Made it exactly as listed. The "gravy" was very tasty the sweetness of the sherry was the kicker, but I think the pork chops were a little over done. I could have taken them out of the oven about 10 minutes early and after the rest they would have been perfect. 
As for the flour I think it had a lot of seasoning that wasn't really tasted, basically anything under a teaspoon would be omitted. Both my DH and BIL sopped up the sauce with some mashed potatoes left over from Thanksgiving. I will definitely make again with the above changes.

Oh My Gosh, one of the best recipes I've made in a long time.  With the exception of using boneless pork loin chops I made this exactly per the recipe and I wouldn't change a single thing.  At first taste of the gravy I thought it had a funky sweet taste which concerned me but serving it with the chops and some mashed potatoes, all the flavors and the heat melded together and we were hooked.  I do have to agree with the other reviewers who said there is way too much flour mixture than was needed but I added extra parts of flour and water to make extra gravy.  Will definitely make this again when my kids come to visit or for company.

Made it, sort of. Was looking for a different combination of spices for some pork.  Was not disappointed. Smothered the cut in the spices, seared it, and then baked it.

Absolutely delicious!! My husband isn't a big fan of pork chops and never eats gravy, but he cleaned his entire plate, gravy and all. Flavors were perfect and the pork was so juicy and tender!! Will be making this regularly since it was soooo easy as well!

Used 4 butterfly chops and a cup of flour. Tripled up on the spices. Baked 20 minutes before adding the liquid. Then cooked another 20 minutes.
Kept adding cream, water, flour and sherry slowly to gravy until it was perfect. Absolutely heavenly with roasted new potatoes and steamed asparagus. Make extra sauce. Your family and taste buds will thank you. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent. Followed the recipe to the tee except for the whipped cream (which I had forgotten). Gravy was fine using milk. Will make this again

The chops were very juicy and it all tasted great, but we weren't expecting it to be so sweet.  I may make it again but I'll add more sherry(we like the taste and were Very surprised that we didn't taste it) and less brown sugar.  Very true about extra flour mixture.  I had 4 chops and still had enough for the gravy, which we had over some mashed potatoes also.  Flour seasoning was for 2 but I moved the gravy items up to 3 servings since I had 4 large chops.  Cooked a full 45 mins and they were great, maybe since they really were 2 inch thick. (as others said theirs were over cooked, maybe they had thinner chops)

We LOVED this!  I was dubious about the seasonings, as several of them I rarely use, but it was wonderful.  I didn't have sherry, so I used white wine, and it was great.  Also (as others have mentioned) use only  a little of the reserved flour for the gravy.    We will definitely make this again, and my husband said it is guest-worthy-- the highest compliment in our household!!

It's alright, I only used about 3/4 of the remaining flour at the end to make the sauce and it still came out too thick so use even less sauce. Overall recipe was ok

I made this the other evening and it was delicious.  Instead of the mustard powder (which I don't have at the moment) I coated the chops with a little prepared mustard and I didn't have the garlic powder or celery salt.  I did have an asian pear that needed to be eaten so I cut it into reasonable sized wedges and added them to the baking.  When I made the sauce I tossed them in and instead of cream I used a couple of tbs of Greek yogurt. It was probably a little more tangy than with cream, but with the asian pear added, I felt it went very well. While I realize I adapted the recipe to allow for what I didn't have in the house (making this was a very late-in-the-day decision), it was still amazing and my husband raved about it for days.

Really good and flavorful.  Nice blend of spices.  We are not huge gravy fans, so I skipped that step.  I didn't have cooking sherry in the house, so I subbed in chicken broth.  Cooking the chops in the liquid kept them nice and moist.
