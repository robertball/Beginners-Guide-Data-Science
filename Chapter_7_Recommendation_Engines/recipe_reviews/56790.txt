Sorry I didn't care for these. Reminded me of cough syrup my parents made me take when I was a child. Thanks anyway.

So I'm torn w/this recipe. It's hailed as a "shot" but at 5 oz it's a bit much for even a shooter? I made and tried the recipe as is and it was ok but I didn't feel like slamming a shot so i topped it off w/Diet Ginger Ale and enjoyed it (and it was tasty; I did enjoy it) as a drink. Cheers!

yum I substituted the cherry maraschino juice for the grenadine and topped it off with cranberry juice. I would call it a cocktail
