I made this with the exception of adding potatoes to the crock pot.  I thought it was a welcome change from my normal crock pot roast.  I also thought the peppers were a nice addition to the roast.  I will make it again.

This is one pot recipe I've used many times.  Recently I did a small group taste test with Mississippi Pot Roast and another well known and loved pot roast.  When they were side by side the Mississippi Pot Roast was the clear winner. 

I do recommend searing the Roast prior to the crockpot cooking.

Don’t put it in the crock pot without browning it on all sides first. If you don’t itll get tough while cooking

Agree with the butter reco and even as I like salt you can go easy on it as the packets and pepperoncinis have plenty of it included.  Also you want sliced pepperoncinis.  Recipe didn't seem to specify that.

I make mine very similar except put potatoes and baby carrots on the bottom, then the roast, then sprinkle on the ranch and au jus, finally add the peppers and juice.  My only real change is to lay a stick of unsalted butter on top.  I very seldom eat any meat and even I think this is super delicious.

This roast is perfect! We make this often , it's great over mashed potatoes or wild rice. I have also had it on a crusty roll with a slice of provolone and put under the broiler! My sister has made this with chicken and it was also delicious.

This is a great roast! The recipe I used originally left out the peppercini juice (which I will add next time), but called for a half stick of butter (which keeps the meat super moist).
We use this for shredded beef tacos... YUM!

Fantastic!!! My wife and I made this for Christmas dinner, with one of my sisters for company, and we all LOVED it!

No variations to the ingredients, but several other reviewers suggested searing the roast before going to the slow cooker, so we tried that. The results were excellent, and we will definitely make this again. Some others (and another recipe) suggested adding a stick of butter; we didn’t do that, and after dinner, we all felt that it didn’t need it.

DO NOT ADD CARROTS! I added veggies as a lot of reviewers did but the carrots are horrible! They tasted pickled andwe did not care for them at all! The meat was nice and tender and may have worked but because the vegetables absorbed the pepper liquid, the meal was ruined. We ordered pizza. (I totally understand that the recipe did not ask you to add vegetables and the fault lies with me for changing it.)

I made this tonight, and it was incredible.  The roast was tender beyond comparison.  The mixture of au jus, ranch, and pepperocinni gave it a deep flavor that ends with a little kick.

I made it a 2nd time and added a hack...  After the beef was done I shredded it into a  casserole dish, added in some of the Au Jus gravy, threw a bag of mixed veggies on top, then topped it all off with mashed potatoes and twice baked it on 350 for 30 minutes and it was even more perfect.

This looks delicious. Looking forward to trying it. I think I will sear the outside of the roast before putting it in the crockpot. I always find beef gets way to dry when cooked in a crockpot

I totally see why this recipe got a 5-star rating. this was the best roast I've ever made.. I followed the instructions as written however I did put a stick of butter on top of the roast at the beginning and added a corn starch slurry at the end to thicken the delicious gravy. since I did cut this over a bed of potatoes and carrots I did not make mashed potatoes with this but that would make it would be perfect. this will be my go-to recipe for all pot roast from now on ..you cannot go wrong with this recipe

This was delicious!  I used a 3lb chuck roast, followed recipes except for adding a 1/2 stick butter to the top of the roast, two chunked potatoes, onion  and used a 16oz jar sliced peppers and the juice.  Next time all the same but half of  the pepper juice.  Also browned the meat on all sides before putting in crock.

We LOVED this recipe! A great weeknight protein recipe that is so easy.  I used the entire bottle of pepperocini and approx. 6oz of the remaining liquid in the bottle.  Could have used it all.  The meat just falls apart, and is delicious.  I served on french bread bagettes and used the liquid as a dipping sauce.  Will make this again and again!

I’ve actually made this a dozen times or so, and it never, EVER disappoints! Seer the roast on all sides first, then prep as directed. Fantastic flavors, the roast pulls apart with a fork, and the peperoncini’s melt in your mouth. It’s in the monthly rotation at my kids house, and several friends too!

I have made this recipe several times. Pot roast doesn't get any better than this. However, the recipe I have also calls for 1 stick of butter (not margarine). All of my family loves it!

This was amazing. My husband is not a big fan of pot roast but he said he would happily eat this again. I followed the recipe as written but I added potatoes, carrots, and onions since that's how I traditionally make my roasts.

I’ve made this at least a dozen times. But the sodium in the a ju and the ranch is too much. So I cut the a ju in half and I add a whole jar of peppercinis with 1/3 cut of the juice.  You can add a can of mushrooms too!  So delish!!  The meat just falls apart.

I should've timed myself.  It might have taken less than a minute to throw everything in the pot and that was it! Used pre-sliced pepperoncini and served with garlic butter pasta. Soooo easy and delicious!

Made as suggested and added 1/2 stick of unsalted butter - this will cut the salt- makes a big difference. I might actually up this to 4lbs of meat for a family with 2 teenagers! It was amazing and we will definitely make again!

I have made this recipe twice now. First time i followed instructions exactly. While good i thought it lacked a punch. This time i added a few modifications. I added half a package of onion soup, roasted garlic cloves, and chopped onions. It had that punch i was looking for... *My rating is for the recipe as is.

Like others I frequently add my own touches to recipes. Not this time. I followed the recipe almost exactly, I left out the additional salt. I also read a majority of the reviews so I was aware that several people thought this on the salty side. With this in mind I read the ingredient lists on the three au jus choices I had: McCormick's, Lawrys and Johnny's.  The first two had salt as the first ingredient while Johnny's had salt as the third, so I chose this. I also did NOT put in any additional salt. That said this was way too salty, and I love salt. I had to take all the juices in the crock pot, remove the grease from the rendered fat and then cut the broth with water. This helped greatly in reducing the salty taste but left the juices tasting weak. I added some red wine which added more heartiness to the broth. This saved the dinner. Not a recipe I'll be repeating.

I seared the roast first, and added half a stick of butter per other reviews. Did not add any extra salt. Delicious! Used the juices to make a gravy; plenty salty but tasty. Beef was very tender and I served it with mashed potatoes. Will make again.

I make this with pork roast and 1/2 stick of butter. It also works really well with chicken breast. My husband loves to make sandwiches for lunch with the leftovers!

I've been meaning to make this for a few years now after I read a review somewhere where they had turned it into sandwiches. I followed the recipe as is and sauteed peppers and onions together and mushrooms separately, then put the shredded beef/pepperoncinis mix with the sauteed veggies on  a toasted hoagie roll bottom, covered with provolone and put it under the broiler, then topped with the toasted roll top- turned out amazing.

I made this just as directed and the family loved it. It couldn't have been easier to prepare, and tasted great over mashed potatoes. Very tender and flavorful. I'll definitely save this for a cool weather recipe.

I often make a 2-ingredient pot roast with just a hunk of meat and a jar of pepperoncini, but this adds a bit of depth to it.  I made minor changes and took it to a pot luck. 

I used stew meat instead of the roast, browned it up well, added a can of beef consommé  and half a jar of medium pepperoncini, with just a splash of the juice.  I'm a big fan of Penzey's Spices, so I stirred in a generous amount of their Creamy Peppercorn Dressing.  I cooked it in my Instant Pot for an hour and it was perfect.  We like it spicier at home, so next time I make it, I'll add Penzey's Black and Red Pepper and serve over mashed potatoes.   Would be great in a sandwich or over rice, too.

I think my boyfriend was a bit skeptical of the pepperoncini going in, but this was flavorful and tangy. Its definitely going into our regular meal rotation.

YUM!  I didn't pull the meat apart but cut it in pieces like regular pot roast.  This pot  roast is wonderful left over as well on a buttered, toasted hoagie roll with some of the peppers.

Family loved it..  added 1/4 c. Butter as included in other recipes;  Served it over rice with gravey made from the liquid.  It is a bit spicey with the pepperoni and I omitted the salt.  Can be added later depending on your taste.

I don't add any salt or pepper to the roast because there is plenty of sodium and spices in the packets as is.  I have also added sauted onion with the peppers and I only add half the amount of butter that it calls for because it just doesn't need all that extra fat, the marbleization of fat within the chuck roast adds plenty of flavor already. I serve this over no-yolk egg noodles for the kids and sweet potatoes for myself. YUM!

I make this often, it is one of my husband's favorite meals.  I season my chuck roast with pepper, ranch garlic seasoning, and garlic powder, then I add a little oil to a skillet and sear every side of the roast.  After searing, I put in the crockpot add the au jus gravy packet, ranch dressing packet about 5-7 whole pepperoncini and then pour in some of the juice from the jar (about 1/2cup).  Crockpot low for 8 hours.  (Btw turn on crockpot before searing meat )
When I take it out and put on serving dish it is mostly falling apart.  I then make gravy with the juice and use that to pour over the meat and mashed potatoes.   Delicious!
Then use the left over meat for burros.

Easy and great! I used more meat (almost double) and doubled the seasonings and used a full jar of sliced (not whole) peppers and stick of butter, just don’t add salt because it’ll have enough from the seasonings packets and peppers. I threw in a 3lb. Bag of carrots on top. Carrots absorbed a lot of the salt.. but all together it pairs very well, maybe just a bit salty (carrots only) but not bad. Served it up with a side of mashed potatoes. Delicious!

Made this recipe as published.  Used a good chuck roast.  Did not care for the "pickle" flavor in the dish, it just wasn't for us so won't be making it again.

Very tasty with a little zing to it...
I didn’t add salt since the pepprocini   already added that. I will keep this recipe!!

I made this with a 4.5 lb chuck roast for a funeral meal. When it was done I realized I had forgotten the ranch dressing mix. Nevertheless, it was a big hit and there were praises and no leftovers. I’ll make it again and use the dressing mix.

It was pretty good.  Husband really liked it.  Good for a change.  I would make it again.  There are other pot roast recipes I like better.  Can’t bear slo cooker pot roast. It is so easy and it is delicious. Makes great stringy beef tacos with the leftovers.

This was a hit, even with my mother who hates pepperoncinis and my children who are highly critical of anything out of the crockpot.  I did two 2.7 lb roasts for 10 guests, so adjusted the ingredients accordingly but loosely.  It looked like the pepperoncini effect might be too much, but it mellowed and made the whole thing delicious.  Served either on sweet rolls or over mashed potatoes with gravy made from the roast.  I didn't have a single drop left over.

I’ve been making this for years!!!! You can use half packet of  ranch and aujous to cut back on the sodium. Great with pork and chicken too!
Leftovers? Crusty rolls are awesome!

Great recipe & even better the following day. I add a stick of unsalted butter. Omit the pepperoncini juice & salt. It's not needed at all.

Yum!  Most ranch packets are much more than the recipe calls for do be careful not to use too much.  Made it as written and added baby red potatoes the last three hours.

I made it but I used beef cube instead....The only meat I had on hand. I made as the recipe describes, only I was confused, because the ingredients said Ranch dip packets, but the directions say use the buttermilk ranch dressing, either way I used the packet because it was what I had on hand and it was delicious!!! My dad and I ate it all!!! Now it did have a little kick to it that probably wouldn’t have been as bad with the dressing?? But overall we had a winner! Will definitely be adding it to our recipe rotation!!!Thanks

We doubled this recipe with about 4-5 lbs of meat. I also added chopped onions and red bell pepper underneath the meat in the slow cooker. My husband was against doing another roast, but he’s used to the classic roast with potatoes/carrots/onions. It was great! I’ll make this again.

We loved this! A nice difference from the standard roasts I've always made. As some reviewers suggested, I did sear the roast before putting it in the slow cooker - and I added almost 1/4 cup of butter. The roast was tender and flavorful. I will definitely make it again.

I've made it several times and it always goes!  Only complaint was that my wife found it to be very salty with AuJus powder.  I substituted the AuJus with a brown gravy powder and it was just as delicious but without the heavily salty flavor.

This is a great change from the same ole boring crock pot roast! The peppers give it a nice kick! I used half hot, half mild pepperocinis. I also used my instant pot so i could brown it and cook it same pot!  I think it only took 2.5 hours from beginning to eat in the instant pot. My kids like it over rice.

Used peppers instead, have it a nice spicy flavor. Not too spicy, just right.

I only used a 1.5 pound Chuck roast, but didn't alter anything else.  I should have cut back on the pepperoncini and next time I would use two packets of the au jus, as I like extra gravy.  I ended up having to eat this over very bland mashed potatoes to make up for the spice and salt in the roast.   But I will definitely try it again

I've made this recipe two times in the last month and I'm making it again this weekend. It is by far the tastiest pot roast I've made and tried. Even my husband says so and my picky little 7y/o son. We have always eaten it with rice but will try it with mashed potatoes this time. I was out of banana peppers when I first made it so I substituted corn. It was awesome! And I've been using just corn so far. The canned corn kernels is what I use. I still have to try it with the pepperoncini but in the mean time this is one dish I will for sure keep making over and over again.

So delicious. It was a big hit with the family. I love the flavor the peppers add. I didn't have au jus packets so I substituted with a Lipton onion packet. Yummy.

Absolutely fabulous! Pleased everyone in my family of six! Not a shred remained! I did end up using the whole jar of pepperoncinis for extra zing. Everyone from 10-50 raved about it. Thank you for sharing.

So, so, so good. I don't own a slow cooker so I wrapped it in tin foil, topped it with a stick of butter and put it in a Dutch oven. 350 for about 4 hours. No added salt needed, as the pepperoncini are salty enough. Looking forward to making sandwiches with the leftovers!

Very good recipe.  Great flavor and super simple.  I did find it a bit salty, but I don’t know how you avoid that using the ranch dressing and au jus packets. I added carrots and did brown the meat as suggested by another reviewer. Next time I may try adding half of each packet and hope I don’t lose the great flavor.

I was so disappointed in this recipe, but it's probably just me. I don't use salt due to blood pressure issues. I left out the salt, but didn't take into account the salt in the au jus & buttermilk ranch packets. It was so salty I couldn't eat it. I even tried the old trick of putting some raw potatoes in it to take out the salt. I hate to waste food, especaily meat, but this went into the garbage. Sorry...but this is the first recipe I can say I will not make again until I figure out a way to delete all the salt/sodium somehow.

I would omit the added salt and use the whole jar of pepperoncinis and juice, but overall, this was pretty good.

This recipe is so good!  My family really likes it.
I use about  1/2 to 3/4 of the package of Au Jus to cut down on some of the salt and left out the salt that the recipe calls for.
Yummy!  I don't like crockpot roast but this was excellent!

Made this yesterday - followed recipe with exception of adding a few pats of butter to the top of roast. Very tasty, husband and teenager approved! The meat was a little tough but I may have let it stay in crockpot too long, or the cut of meat wasn't the best. I did baste it a couple times during cooking. Will make again!

One of the best roasts I have had, love the spice and flavor, a little too salty, so I won't add salt, just pepper

Added potatoes, worked great in there, next time I'll add in some green beans as well

Turned out pretty good. We aren’t big beef eaters, but decided to give this a try. I added carrots and it came out go. I did cook it for an extra hour as the beef didn’t seem tender enough to my liking after the recommended 8 hours.

It was tasty. I didn't have enough peppers, which I love. Next time I might try to change up so I don't have to use packet ranch product,  prefer not to use of I can.

We decided to try this for our Christmas dinner, and we absolutely loved it. So did our dinner guest. The peppers are what put this roast over the top, plus the resulting good juice from the packaged ingredients. We think we'll try this for use as Italian beef sandwiches next time.

I thought this was very very good and easy to prepare. I did not have 3 pounds of chuck roast so I used the 1.5 pound chuck I had and a 1.5 pound top roast. I'll make again using a 3 pound chuck to see if it makes a difference. I rated it at 4.5 stars, but could not split the 5th star.

Terrible! Tasteless, dry and awful. I love the all the ingredients listed, and thought this sounded like a great recipe, I even took the advice of a few and added a stick of butter on top. I threw this away. I will not make again. Big fat waste of time and money.

Great pot roast, I turned this into beef dip sandwitches just by adding a half of can of beef broth, along side some great French rolls!!!! What a delight ! One thing I might add is not to use a tri-tip roast it’s to stringy!!!!!!! This is a keeper , I did not salt and pepper no need to

Just a hint of spice was perfect for my mild minded family.
I used 1/2 the butter and it was amazing.

A truly delightful dish!  I will definitely make this again.  My husband and I just ate this for dinner and I'm already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  Hubby was in love with it, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this as written, except I browned the meat first.  It was delicious and I’ll definitely add it to our rotation!

Yummy good, would def make again.  Love the extra  flavor boost you get from this mix. Browned the roast first an  added  some quartered onions bc I always think they add to Pot Roast flavor.

I did not sear first. Used 5 Pepperoni, more if small and  used regular 'Ranch Dressing/Hidden Valley'. Made it many many times. Always successful! No Compaints!  Use side dishes of green beans and potatoes or put it in  tortilla. No fail with this one.

Delicious and I didn't even use the au jus mix.  I browned mine first and I think that helped develop the flavor.  This is a keeper... and add extra peppers.. they're mild and impart a great flavor and they mellow out during the cooking. This is a keeper!

I make this often/sometimes with variations. I've used dry Italian dressing instead of ranch, lots of chopped fresh garlic too. We love it on toasted buns w/provolone cheese, sautéed onions and mushrooms. My family loves this. It shreds perfectly for sandwiches.

This is now my go to recipe for roast. We had the regular roast I’ve made for years earlier this week (12-04-17) and it had no zing.  I will only use this recipe from now on.

i did not have any pepperoncini, and my family doesn't like them,  but this is the best roast recipe we have  ever had!.  the meat was tender, and it made its own gravy.  how easy and delish!
update: used this recipe ( with the peppers) on a pork roast, and a brisket. wow!! cant go wrong!! family, friends, even the kids love it!!!

Sounds delicious     I’ve been looking for something different other than the same old typical pot roast recipes (albeit they are good also).   Can’t wait to try it!   Thanks for the recipe!

We love this and make it often. I usually use a brown gravy mix instead of au jou to save $ and i usually throw in some italian dressing (about 1/3 cup) instead of butter that most of the recipes call for. Serve over mashed potatoes or wide egg noodles.
