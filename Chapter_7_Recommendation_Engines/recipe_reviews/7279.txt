Everyone loved it, only after i'd reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cup. Texture and taste is good. BUT I HAVE THIS TO ADD: I'm surprised that nobody thought the cake was too sweet. The first time i made this cake, it was awfully sweet that we all got a bit sick from eating it. 3 cups of sugar for 2 cups of cake flour and 1 cup of ground pecans do not sound like a right equation at all! Doesn't anyone else feel like this?

Everyone loves this cake when I make it.  If your looking for that pound cake with the crunchy crust, look no further.  This cake is really heavy, but moist.  For you nut lovers, try adding pecans to the batter also.  Very good! I would try less sugar next time. Maybe 2 1/2 cups instead of 3.  It's a little sweet for my taste.  I also increased the vanilla to 1/2 tbsp for more flavor.

DEVINE!!!!  Just what I was looking for. Only made 2 changes, didn't use the pecans (my husband is allergic, but can't wait to try making it with the pecans for my dad and myself)and added one ingredient to the recipe-added 1 tsp. of almond extract (along with the 1 tsp. of vanilla extract)  My favorite pound cake is the Tastefully Simple Absolutely Almond Pound Cake and this is pretty close.  My kids prefer this over chocolate chip cookies! LOVED IT!

This is a classic recipe for pound cake but this is the first time I've made it with cake flour rather than all purpose. I've decided either can be used with perfect results.  Moist, dense, buttery and delicious, just as a good pound cake should be - so long as you cream the butter and sugar well, don't overmix once the flour mixture is added, and don't overbake! I skipped the pecans and threw in maybe 1-1/2 cups of blueberries.  To finish, I topped the cake with a glaze of powdered sugar and lemon juice.  I used a specialty Bundt cake pan and between it and the polka dots of blueberries it made for a beautiful presentation!

This is the perfect pound cake.  My benchmark for pound cake is "Sara Lee"...this one is even better. Perfect texture, crumb and flavor!  I usually do this without the pecans and bake in loaf pans.  Half of the recipe makes one large loaf pan or three small.  I also vary the flavoring depending on how I'll be serving this.  Some of my favorites include, coconut, rum and almond flavorings instead of the vanilla.  Try this...cut a slice of pound cake, place on a sheet of foil.  Butter cake slice and top with a slice of pinapple, place a marachino cherry in the center of the pineapple, sprinkle with about a tsp. of brown sugar.  Wrap in the foil; place on the grill and grill until nice and hot; about 10 min.  Delicious!

This was made for a friend's husband that only likes Sour Cream Pound Cakes from Publix's.... I omitted the nuts as I am allergic to them and can't cook with them, but everything else was the same. Her husband now only wants me to bake his pound cakes! This was a very moist cake. Will make again! I used a bundt pan to bake it in.

I have kept this recipe around for nearly 10 years.   No matter how many times I make it, I never tire of the rich, moist flavor.   Everyone I share it with has seconded that emotion.  This cake is a true winner!!!   Do note that the batter may be more than enough to fit into one bundt pan.   I use an oversized bundt pan when I follow this recipe.  Yum :)

No wonder Carole won first place at the fair.  My husband is such a picky eater that I'd just about given up making cakes altogether until I tried this recipe. Listen ladies!  When a man hides half a bundt cake on the top shelf of a closet, you know it's got to be good! Try this recipe. You won't regret it!  Deb L-D

Yum. Very delicious pound cake. I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar; it gave the cake a heartier taste. I got great reviews from the whole family! Really quite easy to make as well. Great for dessert, with coffee, or just for breakfast!

First let me say DO NOT be afraid of using sugar instead of flour to dust your pan, it works great and leaves a great texture on the outside! Having said that, I usually try a recipe at least once following the instructions exactly (within reason) but I couldn't let myself do that in this case. Like many of the other reviewers I knew 3 cups of sugar would be too much. I used 1 3/4 cup of sugar, substituted plain yogurt (all I had on hand) for the sour cream, put  the chopped pecans together with a small amount of brown sugar and cinnamon and layered it in the middle instead of in the bottom of my pan then topped with cinnamon sugared pecans.

It was great.  I had to leave out the nuts due to allergies. I split the batter and baked one in a loaf pan and 2 in small brownie pans.  I left the loaf plain, but I spread raspberry preserves between the other 2 and drizzled with chocolate glaze.  Fabulous!

This is delicious! Made it for my hubby's birthday cake, and he loved it. I added 2 tablesppons sugar to the pecan mix; other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I generally don't have good luck with pound cakes, but I followed the instructions to the letter, and it was perfect--it has a wonderful crunchy crust and that good pound cake  flavor. Definitely a repeat recipe.

Absolutely excellent!  Wonderful flavor and texture, and the pecans and orange glaze add a little of the unexpected.  I won a ribbon for this cake in ourlocal fair.

It is sooooo good. Because we dont hace sour cream in my country i used 3/4 cup buttermilk + 1/3 cup butter to make 1 cup of sour cream. You can put chopped pecans inside too.

When baking, especially a cake of this size, it's vital to know one's oven very well. Some ovens run hot so although it may be set on the correct temp. your cake may bake far too fast on the outside & still be wet inside. Invest in an oven thermometer. That way you will know if your oven runs hot or not so you can adjust the temp. setting accordingly. Often it's not the recipe but rather the oven it's bake in.

This made A LOT of batter and spilled over the sides of my 10" bundt pan as it baked.  It took 1 hour and 45 minutes to properly bake.  A very moist cake and was finished off at my company potluck.

I recommend using organic sugar which has a milder sweetness without the harshness of bleached white sugar.  I juice organic lemons/oranges for the glaze, organic fruit just has more flavor and if you haven't tried any you are missing out.  Same for the pecans.  Try fresh, organic.  If you are going to take the time to prepare a recipe that is labor-intensive, fresh flour and the best ingredients make a difference.  This is a delicious, moist and firm cake recipe that my mother-in-law would have had in her composition notebook.  She taught me to cook and she would have loved this recipe.  It's old-fashioned goodness.  Bless you.

After all of the wonderful reviews, I was excited to serve this cake, but it was very very bland.  I even increased the icing and added pecans to the cake...I won't make it again.

Based on current Vancouver Island standard grocery store prices in Feb 2011, and using 10KG bags of flour and sugar for calculations, this cake cost me $9.54 in ingredients.

A very nice cake. I made it without modification, and I did not find it to be too sweet, though it is not exactly something you would have a large serving size of.

I will probably make this cake again in the future when I have a fridge full of eggs and a carton of sour cream about to go bad. :)

This was my very first cake from scratch and I absoulutely love it!  My aunt made this cake last Christmas from the AllRecipes cookbook and I just had to try it this year.  It is so simple once you get past the fear of baking.  I love the sweetness and wouldn't change a thing.

Delicous! I added some lemon peel to the cake batter....I found the glaze made the cake a bit soggy on the bottom day one but was better day two. Will definitely make this again, super easy and good!!

Love it! The cup of ground pecans in place of the flour is a must do. I didn't make the glaze because I ran out of time before a birthday party, but more people ate this instead of the frosted cake.

My end result was good AFTER several adjustments, hence the 3 stars.  I decreased the amount of sugar, increased the amount of vanilla, added pecans to the cake and on top and didn't overbake it.  I used another recipe for the icing as I don't like OJ added to my icing.  I cut the recipe in half because I was only serving 4 people.   Good, but NOT great recipe.

I decreased the sugar to 2 cups and I increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon.  Baked at 325 for 60 to 75 minutes in a bundt pan.  I didn't use the pecans.  Yum!

My husband, who is not a sweets person, had a second slice, which is saying something. I made this just as is, though I used canned vanilla frosting, nuked in the micro a bit, to make the drizzle topping, which is a hint I learned somewhere here in AllRecipes for when you don't have time to make frosting (or are out of powdered sugar). So it didn't look lovely as in the photo above as it was more of a clear glaze. Tasted marvy though.  It really had an angel food-light and moist taste, and was not overly sweet. If I make this again I would definitely use real frosting, so as to hide the nutty bottom, which looked weird without frosting on top (see my picture), and put nuts on the top as in the recipe's photo.  Anyway, I which I had more occasions on which to make this cake. Yum.

This was my first attempt at making pound cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was really good.  I don't think you need to use less sugar as other people have suggested.  Very good as is.

Well geesh. I made this exclusively for hubby to cheer him up. I read a ton of reviews and reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups based on the consensus of reviews. After hubby ate a slice he said, this is good but it needs to be sweeter! LOL Some days you just can't win! Personally, I think 2.5 cups is plenty sweet enough. I doubled the glaze and that really wasn't necessary. This was an absolutely gorgeous presentation! I did replace one cup of cake flour with one cup of chopped pecans. I sprayed the pan well with Pam and I had no trouble with the pecans in the bottom sticking. Thanks for the post :)

I love pound cake and this is YUM-YUMM-YUMMMMMMMY! My advise is DO NOT CHANGE the recipe before you have tried the original. If you like extra pecans just toast some and add it AFTER you've put the icing. If you have the "ALL RECIPE" cookbook like I do you'll notice that the picture of this cake shows pecans that have been added AFTER the frosting :).

This was an incredible cake!!  I baked it for our company bake sale and had rave reviews!  I used the ground pecans in the batter, as suggested, and it was really delicious!  The pecans in the pan, plus the glaze, gave a wonderful light crunch to the outside of the cake.  I'm going to make this for my Thanksgiving meal.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful cake!!

A delicious and moist cake.  Baking at a low temp makes a big difference.  I think I would like to try a different icing. Something with more of a kick. Any suggestions?

I though this recipe was great and was easy to modify. I layered the cake with ribbons of almond cocoa spread and used crushed almonds instead of pecans. The cake was moist and a wonderful consistency it turned out great with cake flour.

4 stars for flavor but came out drier than other pound cakes I've made and I only left it in the oven for 65 min. Dissapointed with the dryness but will hold up well with strawberries and ice cream.

Very dense and heavy cake  !!!Like other reviews, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was sweet enough.I omited the glaze as I do not like glazes on cakes. 
I baked  the cake at 325 for 60 -70 min . Next time I would reduce the eggs to 3 and reduce the butter to 1/2 cup as I really don't like dense cakes. As is this cake would be a good base for a trifle.

This was incredibly good. I have tried several versions of pond cake and this is the only one that has turned out well.  I did some modifications to accommodate my hubby's lactose intolerance and my unwillingness to go to the grocery store for ingredients. I substituted the sour cream for a tofutti "sour cream" and the butter for a lactose free butter, I cut the salt in half because the butter was salted and I used almonds instead ofpecans since I had them on hand. It turned out nicely and we will be making this again and again. 
Why 4 stars instead of 5? Only because I had to modify ithe recipe so technically I didn't follow it exactly. I gotta say though, if this recipe is so good with "tofutti", its gotta be even better with the real thing!

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and she absolutely loved it! This is definitely a "mom" kind of cake. I did follow a few tips from reviewers: I reduced the sugar amount to 2 1/2 cups, added chopped pecans to the batter, and doubled the glaze recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for the first time today. I left out the pecans only because I didnt have any. I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar and made sure to cream the butter and sugar very well. This is one of the best pound cakes I have tasted and it is a recipe that I will use often.

WOW, so good!!  Dense and moist, just as a pound cake should be.  The pecans add a nice 'crust', although next time I would add a bit more than called for in the recipe, but still wonderful as is.  I did reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups as I have done this with other pound cakes too, 3 cups just seems a tad much.  I added a tsp of almond extract along with the vanilla and used 4 eggs with 2 whites as I had a carton open.  I also added some orange zest in with the glaze ingredients.  My cake was perfectly cooked in 82 minutes.  Superb!

This is a wonderful cake.  Anything that's baked with cake flour tastes better to me anyway.  I agree with the other reviewers. It's perfect as is. "NO" I repeat "NO" modifications necessary. I baked this cake on Good Friday I think. Yes I remember because we were going away for the Easter holidays and my dad was going to watch the house for us and there was a piece left in my fridge. I still have piece in my fridge as we speak and taste it last night and it was still wonderful. You have got this try this one people. This is the one you don't want to get away. MMMM....DELICIOUS ! ! ! "5" star and nothing less.

I made this cake today and I loved it. It came out very light and moist.  I used 2 cups of Splenda instead of sugar and 1/2 cup of the Splenda Brown Sugar Blend.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of sour cream.  I mixed a half cup of walnuts with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 3 tablespoons of Brown sugar and put it into the center of the mixture.  It really came out great.

This recipe was very moist and a favorite among the men in the family.  After sitting a few days, it became mushy due to the glaze,  so make sure it is eaten within a few days.

Dense and moist.  The batter was delicious (tasted like melted butter pecan ice cream).  The finished cake was good, but not five star in my book.

Just finished this cake! It looks wonderful! I used 2 cups of organic pure cane sugar instead of 3, added 2 Tbl. of vanilla extract.  I also whipped the butter and eggs TO DEATH to ensure an excellent texture. The cake is for Easter but I think I'll have to try a slice before??

I've made a similar pound cake for years, but I want to try the pecan topping.  One caveat: this really is too much sugar.  I would use 1 1/2 or 2 cups of sugar, at most.  Now I'm looking for a recipe that will incorporate chopped pecans into the batter.

I just finished baking it. And it has a milky flavor which is good but it is too sweet.  Probably it would be better if sugar was half the quantity.

I had to alter a bit as we are a diabetic household. I used 2 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 cup of plain yogurt instead of sour cream, 1 1/2 cups of Splenda white & 1 cup of Splenda brown for my sugar. I used (4 ) 1/4 cups of egg beaters & (2) 3 TBS egg whites. I ground enough pecans for 1/4 cup and mixed 1 TBS Splenda brown sugar with a hint of cinnamon and set aside. Per one hint I sprayed my tube pan with olive oil & dusted with Splenda white sugar. I mixed all per the recipe and poured 1/2 the batter into tube pan. I sprinkled layer of pecan/sugar/cinnamon mix over batter. Pour remaining batter over this mix. Bake for 70 minutes at 325. I did not add a glaze. It was awesome!!!  will definitely make again. thank you

It was very successful! My friends loved it! I'm planning to make another one for the next meeting. However, I made huuge changes to this recipe: First, because I didn't have any sour cream I replaced it with plain yogurt. It wasn't as dense as it should've been but very MOIST! I liked it! Second, I don't like my pastry too sweet so I put little less than 2 cups of sugar rather than 3.  It was sweet enough, though, especially if your going to pour icing on top. Third, I didn't spread icing on top of my cake.

This is a great cake and I wouldn't change anything when making it.  I personally didn't use the pecans cause I didn't have any.  I will say this got better the next day but is not really a pound cake consistently...a little more like a thick cake. But very good!

I baked it exactly as instructed with no changes, and my entire family loved it.  The glaze over top with the pecans was a perfect touch.  Next time I may mix some chopped pecans into the batter itself to add something more.  Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was one of the best pound cakes I've ever made.The first time I used pecans and the second time I used Walnuts.I liked the Walnuts better.I didn't have a problem with sugar.Sometimes If you use Domino's sugar, Your cakes taste a little sweeter.To me, it's a sweeter sugar.I only use it for pies.But this was a great recipe. I would reduce the sugar  by 1/2 cup.

I made this for the 1st time for this years super bowl and I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 Cups. Also, I only had salted butter so I didn't add any salt and I used reg. flour instead of cake flour. Everyone loved it but it was really heavy and sweet for me.

Everytime I bake this pound cake, it receives rave reviews.  I have baked it with and without the pecans and glaze.  Either way it is a hit. I have given out the recipe more times than I can remember.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this cake MANY times & love it!  A couple of changes I do is I chop the pecans & throw them right into the mix.  I tried pouring them over as recipe states once but it seemed didn't like the way it looked when finished.  Also, I bake at 325 for 1 hour & it is usually perfect in my bundt pan.

Wonderful!  A moist cake that's better if you add rum and almond extract.  I also added 1/2 cup pecan meal to the batter.  Double yummy!!!

Great cake!! Took advice from others and used 2 cups flour and 1 cup chopped fine pecans, was great. Didn't have time to frost this cake but it didn't need it. Had great reviews from everybody at work.

Not really a fan of this recipe, sorry. I did not have pecans and decided to dust with 10X sugar instaed of orange glaze, maybe that was the problem. Family said to stick with my other pound cake recipes, but in all fairness, I think that I'll try it again using the pecans and orange glaze.

This is a delicious cake. I only put in 2 cups of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I also added a cup of fresh raspberries and a cinnamon sugar swirl though the center. Very good!

My daughter doesn't like nuts, so I left out the pecans.  I also substitued 1 cup of flour with ground almonds.  Delicious and a sure winner, yet so easy to make.

Mmmmmm.  I just had a piece.  It is moist, delicate, delicious.  I think being as the topping is sugary, you should cut down the sugar in the recipe to 2-1/2 cups.  I did and I think the sweetness is just right.  I'm going back for seconds...

what a great recipe-  the cake turned out airy, soft and yummy.

i cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and used fat-free sour cream and turned out well.

I made this last night for a girls get together- no complains but not as many Uhh's and Ahh's as I usually get from Allrecipe 5 star desserts. There just was not a lot of flavor in it. Not that it was not very good- very moist and rich. I added some chopped pecans to the cake- not just the top. The glaze was sweet but had very little orange taste- and I used fresh squeezed OJ. Next time I think I might sprinkle brown sugar in the bottom of the pan with the pecans instead. And I will butter the pan better- although I buttered it well (a non stick pan) and floured it- almost the entire outer layer stuck. At least it did so uniformly! I will make this again to try it with some sort of brown sugar glaze but it was not a 5 star in MY book- but also not a flop.

Wow!  Everyone LOVED this cake!  I made it without the pecans and it still tasted great!  I let the cake cool some, then made the glaze and put it on the cake while it was warm.  Immediately after glazing the cake, I put it in the refrigerator.  The next morning it had an "outer orange-flavored crust" while the inside was moist, firm and delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

This is the best pound cake I have ever had.  I was looking for a nice plain pound cake, so I didn't add the pecans or use the glaze.  YUMMIE!

A very good cake. I served for Mother's Day and it was loved by all. I used walnuts instead of pecans. Also, I put them in the batter instead of on top of the cake. I just don't care for a big layer of nuts on top. I would make this again. Especially, when I have leftover sour cream.

This was a hit. I added orange zest to the batter, and some ground pecans as well -- other than that, I followed the recipe as it was. Everyone agreed it was moist and delicious! More of a coffee cake than a dessert, in myopinion... so, we ate it in the mornings for breakfast. Yum!

Kudos to Carole!  Very good recipe. The only things I will change next time is to substitute 1 cup of ground pecans for the cake flour.  I'll also use the zest of one orange in the cake batter to add some continuity to the recipe.  The orange glaze is great but there needs to be some orange flavor in the cake as well.  I'll add some orange zest to the glaze as well. We loved this!

This made a GREAT cake!  I was really surprised at how well it came together.  I did the ground pecan substitution, and it turned out wonderfully.  My family even fought over the beaters, bowl and spatula!  My only problem came from using a small hand mixer, which made mixing rather difficult, because there was a LOT of batter, and the short little beaters just didn't handle it well.

Thanks Carole.  I wanted to try a pecan pound cake and I loved it.  I took it to a meeting and everyon who tasted it loved it. It's amazing that you can get such a different tast by adding a few simple extra ingredients.

Yummy!  I made this with a slight variation, instead of pecans, I used walnuts and also some heath bar candy pieces.  I also just powdered it with confectioners sugar instead of a glaze.  This is a very good recipe.

This is a GREAT recipe. I was supposed to name the pound cake at Christmas and forgot my recipe. I used this one instead and I and my family like it better.  I did not use the nuts. I added two sticks of butter. Other than that it is a firm most cake with a nice crust. I didn't need a glaze

Wow - what an amazing pound cake this recipe made. So delicious and buttery and melt in your mouthy! It had this wonderful little crispy crust on the outside too. Only thing I did different was to make the glaze with lemon juice and not orange juice. Otherwise I followed it to a T and it came out INCREDIBLE!

Great flavor. Wonderful texture. Fabulous glaze. I have made this cake at least 6 times. My only complaint is that this makes too much batter for a typical bunds pan. Yikes, talk about mt. Vesuvius!

Cake is phenomenal!! This was my first attempt at baking a pound cake. It was enjoyed and loved by all. Followed the recipe to the "T". Took the whole cake in to work and walked out with an empty container. Even the crumbs were devoured. Thank you!!

This is the best cake I've made yet!  I kept everything the same but added the 1tsp of almond extract as others suggested and it was fantastic!

Best poundcake ive ever made!!!! However ive used 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice, 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 tsp pure vanilla for a glaze instead an omitted the pecans, I also, added at one time 1-1/2 cups of mashed bananas, 1 tsp of banana an vanilla extract. Omitted the 3 cups of sugar for 2 cups, the bananas make them sweet as well.My kids love it! ust perfect, moist, sweet,crunchy 2 thumbs up to the owner of this recipe, THANKS.....

It was a little on the sweet side, especially if you included the topping.  Next time I will probably reduced the sugar a little.  I made this for a Memorial Day picinic and no mentioned it being a little on the sweet side, they all loved it!

This by far the best pound cake ever! I sometimes have added lemon zest or lemon extract to the recipe as my husband LOVES Lemon cakes. I have also added spices to the recipe on occasion and it turned out as an awesome spiced pound cake. This cake also freezes very well!

Wonderful cake! All my children loved it, even my hard to please teenager. Unlinke some other commentors, I wouldn't recommend reducing the amount of sugar, though this is probably just a matter of taste.

This was so good! I made it into a 2-layer 9-inch cake for my mom's birthday so I lowered the oven temperature a little and watched it closely. I made the glaze a little thicker to be more like frosting but it would have been fine as a glaze too. I sprinkled pecans on the bottom of just one of the pans, which went in the middle with the filling. I also mixed about 1/4 cup of pecans in with the flour mixture. This cake was a huge hit.

Excellent. I add about 1/2 cup ground pecans to the flour mixture, using all-purpose flour. I also used about 1 1/4 cups of sour cream. I also used my tube pan and sprinkled the top not only with pecans but also with edible glitter for the holiday season. This filled the tube pan and made a very tall cake. I also cooked at 325 degrees for 1 hour 10 minutes and it came out perfect.

Made this to serve at a meeting today and came home with only one piece left if that tells you anything.  :)  I thought I had pecans but discovered I only had almonds and walnuts, so used them instead and it was fine.  End result was a beautiful looking cake - I didn't use the glaze, but opted instead for a basic glaze recipe that uses cream, confectioner's sugar and melted butter.

This recipe is delicious.  To the person who wrote that it was too sweet with the 3 to 2 cups, please re-read the recipe.  It is 3 to 3 cups flour and sugar.  Moist, and it falls out of the bunt pan if you use a vegetable spray prior to pouring the batter.

I actually wish that I had used the 3 cups of sugar instead of the cutting it in half, it didn't taste sweet enough. My advice would be to follow the directions exactly and then cut back next time if it is too sweet for you.

Great recipe.  I separate the eggs and whip the egg whites until stiff and fold them in at the VERY end.  
This is not too sweet to my family, this recipe is a very typical pound cake recipe.  Wonderful.  The glaze is not necessary but good either way.

I gave it four because 3 cups of sugar is WAY to sweet for me. I used two cups and yogurt instead of sourcream, either one would work. Served with a lemon sauce, fresh blueberries, kiwi, and strawberries.......Yum

I followed the recipe and the cake, in my opinion, was much too sweet. I should have gone with my gut and cut the sugar initially (3 cups of sugar for 3 cups of flour sounded like way too much! And it was.)I served it when it was warm, after cooling for 1 hr, and found it to be a very bland, heavy and greasy cake. I chose not to make the glaze as it was already so sweet, it didn't need the added sugar. I used a buttered and floured bundt pan, and didn't have any trouble turning the cake out. The only way I could salvage this cake was by cutting it into 1 inch wide, 3/4 inch thick, slices and baking them at 275 until dry and slightly crispy to make biscotti. I then dipped one side in some melted dark chocolate.

Much too sweet for my taste (and my family's taste and my friends' taste).  
Otherwise, nice and moist.  Replacing 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of grated pecans really improved the favour and texture.  I also should have dusted the baking pan with flour, because I had difficulties getting the cake out and some of the crust stuck to the pan. I did not use the glaze. 

The cake actually got better on the second and third day.  I made it again for Easter and reduced the sugar to 2 cups - the cake turned out great, it was fluffier and less dense, and also much tastier.

I made this for a friend's birthday and was dieting at the time so I couldn't taste it but everyone absolutely loved it.  The only suggestion I got was to maybe use only 2 1/2 cups of sugar.

I made this pound cake over 10 times in the last month to send in care packages to the Middle East.  Everyone loved it, and my family at home kept begging me to eat them as I was making them.  I've experimented with rum and almond...this is a terrific base recipe, and my current top pound cake pick.

When I was baking this cake, I couldn't get my boyfriend out of the kitchen!  He licked the bowl, spatula, and the mixer.  He never does that when I bake other cakes.  And while it was baking in the oven, he kept telling me how good it smelled.  The finished product was fluffy, sweet, and heavenly!  We both loved it, and people in my office loved it too.  The only thing I did differently is to use a combination of rum and milk for glaze instead of orange juice and vanilla extract.  Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!  This was an awesome cake.  I made it Saturday morning, and here it is Monday afternoon and there are only 2 slices left!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was soo soo good.  By far the best pound cake ever!  Only complaint- the cake was very hard to get out and some of the pecans stuck to the pan.  I had to doctor it up a bit.  Taste- A+++++!  I have to add to this review- I have made this cake at least a dozen times and I get more compliments on this than on anything I have ever made.

I feel a little awkward reviewing this cake, as I made some significant substitutions - I basically made an almond sour cream cake.  But with that said, it was DELICIOUS!  I used ground almonds in place of one cup of flour and used almond extract (1 teaspoon) and vanilla extract (.5 teaspoon).  As other reviewers said, it is very sweet, but the sugar almost carmelises on the outside.  I'm sure you could reduce the sugar, without harming the flavour too much though.  I didn't bother with the frosting, and really didn't miss it.  Definitely a keeper.

This made a for a very pretty presentation but my husband and I found it to be a bit sweet for our liking.  My glaze did not pour over the cake but sort of blended in, which didn't affect the taste at all.  Perhaps the cake was still a little too warm when I put it on.

Wow!  This tastes wonderful!  I didnt have cake flour but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It still turned out moist and flavorful.  I love the pecans so I think next time I'll try the nuttier variation. It's a new family favorite and I love that I had all the ingredients on hand.

Very good pound cake!  My only alteration was that I reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of cream cheese.  This added a wonderful flavor.  I just thought the cake was a tad bit too sweet.  Next time I will reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  However, all of my friends loved it, and have already asked me to make it again.

I saw where so many people altered the recipe.  NO NEED!  It's a winner AS IS!  It was easy, moist and delicious!  I have made it twice and I did add some mini chocolate chips for fun and it was delicious with or without the chips!

I get requests on this one.  And I love giving these as gifts because people adore them.  This is just such a Classic recipe - the pecans and sour cream flavors compliment eachother so well.  I think maybe next time I may take another reviewers advice and add mini chocolate chips rather than pecans and skip the icing - just to change it up a bit.  I did not do the ground flour substitution because it sounded like too much work but I am sure that it is great.  My one and only problem with this recipe was that I could not locate cake flour - looked at ALL of the local grocery stores and couldnt locate it. I used regulare flour and obviously it still came out great but cake flour is so fine that it might have made it even better.

I made this recipe with the 1 cup of ground Pecans in lieu of 1 cup of the flour and 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 and the rind of one orange.  Although it smelled great, I was very disappointed.  The cake was almost wet, could be my error, but it was sickly sweet even with the reduction in sugar.  I couldn't serve it to my guests, luckily I had made the Raspberry Almond Thumbprint cookies as well.

I can see why this cake won first place.  A friend of mine had a taste for a sour cream pound cake and I used this recipe w/out the pecans and it came out perfectly.  I bought the allrecipes cookbook and got it from there.  The cake was so delicious and moist.  I gave most of it away so I wouldn't eat a lot of it!! Everyone that tasted it said it was so so so so so good!! Thanks!!!

Wonderful cake Carole.  I'm a such a pound cake fan and I love coming across recipes that have a different twist to them - like yours.  I took the author's advice and substituted one cup of pecans for the flour and added the zest of one orange like previous reviewers.  I also used 2 cups of brown sugar rather than 3 cups of white and used orange juice concentrate in the glaze.  The "sweetness" was just right and this cake had a nice orange flavor.  I'll certainly pass this one on.  Thanks again.

I can't tell you how good this cake is, you'll just have to taste and see for yourself.  I have made this about 6 times and each time it came out perfect.  My family and in-laws love it and they request it frequently.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Well! The original recipe is wonderful, and very adaptable; this a.m I used 2 cups of brown sugar instead of 3 white (most recipes use so much sugar), 1 cup finely chopped pecans as suggested by author, (minus 1 cup flour) and didn't want to use the frosting but still wanted a special cake so just before the batter went into the oven, I plopped teaspoonfuls of raspberry jam (2 tbls total amount - just right sweetness) all over and swirled evenly with a light hand - lovely. I can tell you this cake can be prepared up to this stage (cover in foil over pan) and kept safely in fridge because that was what I had to do as my oven went bust on me - never got hot. I remembered reading this tip somewhere and I've never thought cakes can be done like this ... wouldn't it go weird??? but voila I managed to get it to an oven (don't ask) this p.m and mmmmmm ... exquisite! I love this recipe, it is soo good as it is - moist and soft and scrumptious. I might try mini choc chips and jam, or caramel or ... endless possibilities. I used the 9 x 13 inch pan as I thought the batter was too much for my bundt pan. I've also used self-raising flour with 1/3 tsp baking powder, and halal heavy cream soured with 1 1/2 tbls lemon juice (couldn't get sour cream). I am very happy I found this recipe; thanks much, Carole. Good one.

We really enjoyed this cake. After reading some of the reviews I decided to compromise, so I used 1/2 cup of chopped pecans + 1/2 cup cake flour. For us this was just right! Enough nuts to add flavor and texture, but not enough to be dry and gritty. I skipped the glaze all together. I took the suggestions of the other bakers and added the zest of 1 orange, it was wonderful, complimented the pecans with fragrance and flavor. I will make this cake many times.

Made this for company last night and they all enjoyed it.  I made it in two 9 x 5 loaf pans.  Although I think the glaze worked okay on the loaf, the presentation would definitely have been better if I had used a bundt pan.  My husband said he could do without the glaze, but I thought it was fine.  The cake is a bit sweet, so next time I may cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and also use 1 cup of ground pecans as suggested by other reviewers.  Definitely a keeper and I will make it again.

Quite wonderful!  I did not have the orange juice so I used "tang" instead and it worked nicely with the cake.  The whole family gave rave reviews.

This cake was delicious.  I did put 1/2 of pecans instead of 1/4.  I will make this over and over again.  It did take a little longer in the oven also.

I baked this cake (my first attempt at a pound cake) for several of my neighbors Christmas of 2000.  What a hit! All I heard all year was how they couldn't wait until Christmas so they could get another cake, so this year I baked them again. I guess I'm stuck now! This will be a tradition I don't mind, I love all the compliments and fuss they make over my "baking talent". Thanks for a great recipe.

I prepared this recipe for a Christmas party in December 2001.  I'm not good at baking,
but this cake was "perfect"!  I used a one piece iron tube pan and reduced the cooking temperature
to 280 degrees instead of 300 degrees.  During the last 15 minutes, I increased the temperature to 300
because the cake was not browning nor fully done inside.  When I removed it and
inverted it onto a cake plate, I was amazed!  It looked like a chef had prepared it.  I put the glaze on
while it was warm and when I left the party, I had an empty cake plate!  WOW!

I forgot to add the sour cream and it still came out delicious. I took the advise of some of the reviews and doubled the glaze. I will make it again soon and I will make it a point to remember the sour cream and only increase the glaze by 1.5. Cory

If you like very light, kind of bland cakes, this is right for you. If not, double the glaze and add some kind of fruit in heavy syrup on each piece before serving.

I have made this cake twice & won 2 blue ribbons!  The first was at the Dixie Classic Fair earlier this month & just last night I won for the best cake entered at my son's fall festival.  My family loves it too!  (Albeit they have had to eat "crumbs" so far.)  I need to bake them one of their very own!  Thanks for sharing such a good recipe!

We loved this recipe..  I served it at a meal for 7 and everyone thought it was moist and a great piece of cake.  However next time I would add more than 1/4 cup of pecans as there didn't seem to be enough pecans on the top.

This cake was very moist. However, it was a bit bland and too sweet. It also had an "eggy" taste. If I try it again I will use 5 eggs instead of 6, 2 1/2 cups of sugar, and mix pecans into the batter.

Made it according to the recipe, except for cutting the sugar in half as per another poster here. (Do it -- I can't imagine how sweet it would have been with three cups of sugar! I baked it for the minimum time, and it was beyond done -- it was deadly dry. I recommend checking the cake at an hour if not before.

This cake is absolutely wonderful!  I made this to take to a gathering today and it got rave reviews.  I wanted a little nuttier flavor, so I substituted 1/2 cup of ground pecans for 1/2 cup of the flour instead of one whole cup as suggested by CAROLE10. It came out perfect.

I followed the recipe to a T. It was okay. It didn’t have much flavor, but it was very moist. I would not make this again because it didn’t have much flavor to it.

I make a number of pound cakes and this wasn’t a good texture.  Too heavy and wasn’t very tasty. It is moist however but that’s all the sour cream. I only reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups. I kept all the same. I won’t be making this again.

I made this awesome cake! I give it five stars, because if you follow the directions, you end up with a dense, sweet, and moist delicious poundcake! I followed the recipe to the "Tee" but I added Pecans, and butter extract which makes the cake taste just like "Butter Pecan Ice cream flavor!

What a great first time pound cake! After reading some of the other reviews I made the changes that was recommended. I decreased the sugar to 2 1/4 cups. I baked it on convection bake at 350 F for 60 minutes. The cake had a great crunchy crust and a very moist and airy center. I also added Carmel to the bottom of pan with the walnuts. I added a Toffee Pecan icing to it after it had cooled. What a buttery great cake.

Listen. I've made a lot of pound cakes but this one was up there in the top three. I made it as written - NO changes. It was delicious, moist, sweet, and crunchy on the outside.  I took this to a family reunion and it was gone with in 20 minutes. I took the advice of another reviewer and fluffed the flour before I measured it out. I really think it made a big difference in the texture. The cake was dense but tender.  Oh, I did have to bake about 15 minutes longer than the 90 minutes. Might have just been my oven though.

This cake has taken the #1 spot in my cake making list.   I've baked four or five since Thanksgiving.  My co-workers are raving over it.  =D  

I make my own cake flour, sifting it at least five times.  I did one other thing differently based on past experience.  I separated my eggs, whipping the whites to meringue consistency and folded them in at the end.  After doing this the second time, decided to add an extra whole egg along with yolks to the sugar and butter mixture as without the whites it was a bit too stiff, especially after the first addition of the flour.  All in all I (we) love this cake!

My modifications: 2 cups of sugar (actually, slightly less than two cups); 1 whole tsp of salt; 2 whole tsps of vanilla extract (I like a lot of vanilla); an additional half a cup of sour cream, which I only used to get rid of what was left in the jar; instead of one whole cup of butter I used 1 stick of butter and 1/3 cup of vegetable shortening. I also added chopped pecans throughout the batter and sugar dusted the pan. I baked it at 325 degrees for 1hr & 25 minutes, though I think that next time I will bake it at 350 degrees for less time. The cake looked rather light at the top with golden edges. The texture was like a heavy angel food cake, but it had the flavor of Keeblers Pecan Sandies Cookies.

My family and I loved this  cake. I had to turn up the heat after the initial 90 miniutes, but this cake is a great addition to my pound cake collection.

Excellent   Pound cake recipe. Easy to make was a hit with my friends. I used 2 3/4 cups of sugar and worked out well. Next time I plan to decrease sugar amount to 2 1/2 cups of sugar

This cake is the BEST Pound Cake I have ever made or tasted! It's absolutely foolproof and anyone who can read can make this cake. I didn't have to substitute anything at all like most cake recipes but I did however use my own glaze recipe that I've been using for a while. Yum!

This has become my go-to pound cake recipe! I must say that I will use orange juice instead of milk for all future glazes...this glaze took the cake to an whole 'nother level.

The cake baked out ok but it is very bland.  It has a good texture, but I have baked much better flavored pound cakes.  This cake would  be better if served as strawberry shortcake or in an English trifle.  I did cut down on the sugar to two cups.  I believe it would have been way too sweet with 3 cups and that would not have made it any less bland.

Turned out incredibly well despite the fact that I ran out of eggs so just added the equivalent in sour cream (I only had 5 eggs, which I didn't realize until it came time to put them in).  I also baked this at 350, not 300--no way it'd have worked in my oven on that temp.  It still took a good 115 minutes to bake.  Hubs stated he thought it could be sweeter, but I completely disagree and thought it was too sweet.  However, he didn't think it needed the glaze.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious, dense cake.  (I used cake flour, and it was still very dense.)  The citrus icing was good, but the cake-to-icing ratio lacked icing.  This cake screams for berries, cream, or a whole lot more icing.  I used walnuts in lieu of pecans (since that's what I had on hand).  This dense cake would hold up well on the grill, or in a triffle.  It's a good clean / basic pound cake recipe.

This turned out deliciously. I did have to bake it quite a bit longer than stated (in a tube pan) -- around 110 minutes, so 1 hour 50 minutes. The last 15 minutes I baked at 350 because I was just so tired of checking it in 15 minute intervals. I would bake this at 325 next time rather than 300. It turned out of the pan (using Baker's Joy spray) beautifully and tasted great. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was very good and easy to make.  However, 1 1/2 cups of sugar was plenty.  So glad that I read the reviews before adding all 3 cups.  Also, I used a maple glaze (heated maple syrup, butter, milk, coconut, mixed into sifted powdered sugar)  Then I added chopped pecans on top.  Yummy!

I made this yesterday for a potluck and I was suprisingly disappointed in the results. It came out way too thick and dry. I made sure not to overmix while adding the flour. I wound up sadly throwing half of the cake away.  I gave it 2 stars because the flavor was pretty good. I won't make this again.

I have been making this cake for a few years, after finding the recipe in the Allrecipes cookbook.  It never fails!  The texture, taste, and appearance is consistently outstanding.  Nothing needs tweaking as far as I am concerned.

This cake had the taste and texture of an angel food cake rather than a pound cake.  Also, the glaze didn't enhance the flavor at all.  I was disappointed in this recipe - won't use it again.

Love it! At first I was a little apprehensive about putting the orange glaze on top of the cake. I was worried that the orange would somehow overpower the cake but I wanted to make it the way the recipe stated and I was pleasantly surprised! It just works and I loved it! I baked mine in a tube pan and just as other reviewers stated, it was a little difficult to get out of the pan and I'm not sure why. This is an excellent recipe. Simple to make with a down home taste. Really good, a keeper!

Good, but not excellent. I made some minor changes, I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and I'm glad I did, and added about 2 tbsp of vanilla. The texture was wonderful, but not as dense as I'd like, which is weird considering the thickness of the batter!  I did split the recipe in half and made half w/ the pecans and the other half I added the zest of a lemon and about a cup of blueberries. This was delicious!! Will be keeping this one in the recipe box,,, but will continue to tweak I think, until we have it perfect.

Great recipe. I got bored last night so I looked up what ingredients I had to bake a cake and came across this! I don't have a tube pan so I just used a regular old 9x13. I followed the directions except I used regular sugar because I didn't have confectioner's sugar. It turned out a little...hard? lol. I doubled the glaze batch to cover it and cut the baking time by about 30 minutes. It was so good though. I think I'll make this again. :D My husband liked it. hehe

The first time i made this pound cake I had one piece left the next day. I have made this cake several times for family gatherings and believe me i never have any to take home. This pound cake is delicious.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving and everyone seemed to like it.  I wouldn't make it again though.  I prefer a lighter texture and this was very dense.

This pound cake is really good. I ommited the pecan because im not a fan of it. I must admit that straight out of the oven, this cake taste really bland, but the following day it is just scrumptous. I don't like the crunchy crust either, so I only ate the cake itself.

Delicious! I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts instead, which was just as good. I thought the glaze was a bit too runny, but it added more flavor to the pound cake nevertheless. My cake was passed around and was gone in a few hours. I would definitely bake this again! Thanks for the recipe.

I'll bake this one again. I baked this for Thanksgiving and it turned out pretty good.  I read the reviews and used only 2 cups of sugar as others had suggested, and found it to be plenty sweet.  I opted not to do the glaze because I had baked other cakes with icing and wanted to give my family and guests different options with the cakes.  This cake is on the dense side, but good nonetheless.

This is a great cake.  The pecans are really great in the cake.  The only thing I didn't love was the glaze.  I'm not sure orange is a flavor that goes really well with the cake.  Next time I'll just use milk in the glaze.  But it was still really good.  I made these in Nordic ware mini bundt pans, and they were so cute!

If you are looking for the perfect pound cake look no furthere. This is the best pound cake ever. It isn't as dense as the ones you get in the store but I like my pound cakes a little lighter. I don't ever use the glaze b/c this cake stands alone just fine. I make it all the time and always get requests for the recipe. This is a new family favorite.

Delicious! Enjoyed making and guests enjoyed eating. I have also make almond variations as well. A special cake to make. I did not find it too sweet at all and neither did anyone I asked. Wonderful pound cake consistency. The glaze was well-liked as well. Will definitely make again. Great with coffee, for breakfast gatherings.

When I made this I left out the nuts because it was for a large dinner and some people don't like nuts - it still turned out wonderful.  It has a great texture and taste.  The glaze was a little runny so next time I might try adapting that but this is definately a keeper.

I thought this was excellent, our dinner guests had 2 pieces each!!  The only reason i am giving it 4 instead of 5 is because I didn't love the glaze as much as i thought i would.  It didn't turn out so hot for me, i'm not sure why.  So i'll try the glaze again and see if i can do a better job with it, but overall it really was great!!  Huge hit with the company!

I'm not a pound cake baker expert, but this cake turned out great.  I think next time I might try mising the pecans in the batter and then topping it will additional pecans and the glaze.

Really moist and delicious......I might add additional pecans on top of the glaze for a little extra flavor. Also, I used reduced fat sour cream and it was very yummy and easy to prepare!

I just made this cake.  It's so sweet!!!  If you are looking for a sugar cake this might be it. It's also very cake like (angel foodish) --not dense at all.  In my opinion, there are better pound cakes out there!  This is not a southern pound cake like grandma used to make!

this is absolutely the best cake i have ever made! it is moist and rises just right. i made the mistake of using 16 oz. of fat free sour cream instead of 8oz. so i had to cook it a little longer than what is indicated and it turned out great. my husband asked me to make this again. this is definitely a keeper!

I loved this recipe. I used Walnuts instead of pecans, I used a teaspoon of Black Walnut extract and a tablespoon of Vanilla extract. In the glaze I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of rum extract.

This cake is "all that". It doesn't even require a topping as suggested. The pecans taste comes through so wonderfully. Just follow the instructions and flour and grease the pan- the pecans make it kind of hard to release otherwise.

My husband LOVED it!  Wouldn't even share with me! I took the suggestion of substituting pecans for the flour and added extra vanilla and butter extracts.  I put a little glaze that I made of my own using vanilla and butter extract with 3tbls of water 1 1/3 cups of powdered sugar and chopped pecans. Thanks for the great recipe it was a winner in my house!

This cake was fabulous.  I made the nut/flour substitution and it turned out great.  The glaze was a nice tangy flavor on top of the pecans.

This was a great recipe. The cake was so moist and I was really impressed.  I added a ounce of cream cheese and 1 tsp almond extract, butter flavoring. I just wanted to see if the cream cheese would make a difference so I didn't add that much but next time I might add a little more.  It was really good.  Also I did not have any oranges so I substituted it with 7 up in the glaze.  I had to add a little more powder sugar to thicken the glaze.

Cake deserves an A+++++ all the way.

Everybody loved it.  The only advice I can give you is to make a little more glaze than the recipe calls for.  It also took about 45 minutes longer to bake in my oven than the recipe states, but it was DELICIOUS!

I've tried Pound Cakes before without much success, but this one is the best!  My husband loved it so much he helped me with the 2nd one I made.  We used one cup of ground pecans instead of one cup of flour and it makes for a very lovely and delicious cake. Thanks!

Other than having trouble getting the cake to come out of the pan (maybe because I only greased it and didn't flour it), this cake was superb!  Easy to make, didn't use as much butter as some other pound cake recipes and wonderful taste.  Everyone at work loved it. :)
It was my first time trying to bake with ground pecans instead of flour and a coworker I aksed had only used it IN ADDITION TO and not INSTEAD OF flour, but it worked out beautifully (I had used only 1/2 cup because I was afraid it may not work...)!

The best pound cake I have ever made.  This will be the only pound cake recipe I will use over and over again.  I loved how the outside of the cake didn't get that dark cause of the low oven tempurature.  Thanks for sharring your prise winning cake Carole.

I really don't see any difference between this recipe and one for sour cream pound cake except a few pecans on the bottom of the pan.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good recipe, it rises nicely, I just wonder how it would taste with pecans in the cake mix itself?

I don't know if this will work or not -- I'm just adding to my earlier review.  Here's a tip -- add the same amount of lemon extract as vanilla extract for just a touch of lemon and it is excellent.  My original review follows: This is definitely the best cake I've ever made.  I could have eaten the whole cake myself - it came up so nicely.  I love sock-it-to-me cake and have made red velvet cakes as well, but this is now my favorite!

Excellent cake.  I was surprised how moist is was.  Next time I think I ill try frosting it with a "lite" chocolate frosting.  The glaze was a little thin or I put it on too soon.  It sort of vanished.  Dianne

My fanily loved this pound cake.  My only problem is in the receipe the oven temp. says 300 for 1 1/2 hours.  I cooked cake this long and it was still raw I feel oven at 350 would work a lot better.

People at the office request this cake every time we have a birthday. 

Tender and moist, easy to put together. Excelent flavor.

Ground pecan variation noted in recipe works well also.

There is only 1 pound cake recipe that I have that my family has had me repeat over and over again until I tried the PECAN SOUR CREAM pound cake. My husband and children said " this is as good as the cream cheese pound cake,keep the recipe and make it again"  It is very good tasting and easy to make too.  The recipe is really a keeper.
