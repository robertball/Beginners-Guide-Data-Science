A respectable jumping-off point - a good premise but needs work. Here's what to do to improve it: If you are aiming at a fresh taste more reminiscent of the original then throw out the garlic powder (To save time mash/mince a whole head when you have time stir a Tb or two of olive oil into them and store in a small jar in the fridge. 1 clove=about 1/2 tsp) After browning the chicken pieces put them on a plate while you saute 1-2 cloves (depending on size) of mashed garlic. Return the chicken to the skillet and proceed as written. Be sure to add about 1/8 tsp thyme which is authentic in the native French dish. Also adding about 1 Tb tomato paste along with the wine and stock will 1) tone down the purple color imparted by the wine making the sauce a more appetizing chestnut color and 2) round out the flavor of the sauce. BTW may be done with boneless breasts but don't cook the chicken in the sauce the entire time as if you cook pre-sauteed boneless breasts in liquid for 30 minutes they will be dry and tasteless from overcooking. After you saute them put aside and simply add them to the sauce the last 5-10 minutes of simmering. The meat will be juicy and incomparably flavorful. These changes will result in not only an easy version of the classic dish closer to the original but also a better flavor with greater eye appeal. Real coq au vin features a pearl onion garnish and mushrooms either of which can be easily added at the end to this recipe if you like them.

Coq Au Vin is a very good recipe. It does surprise me though that several of the reviewers were either put off or least surprised by the purple color that the wine gave the chicken. When using red wine What other color were you expecting?

I tend to be turned off to chicken dishes because I find they often end up bland and flavorless. This recipe on the other hand was delicious! I was shocked to like a chicken dish so much! Definitely use chicken with skin to really soak up the flavors.

I thought this looked great but it didn't go over real well in my house. I think I would substitute shallots for the onions for a more authentic taste.

It was really good fast and easy! Since I only had drumsticks I baked them for 20 minutes at 375ÂºF before starting the recipe to make sure they would be fully cooked. I also added some paprika dried basil and some cajun spices to the salt pepper and garlic powder. Delicious:o)

I feel the need to come to the rescue of this recipe. First of all the "bland" flavor is the nature of the cooking method. When you are braising a whole chicken in large quantities of any liquid even wine - you will never have an intense flavor. The intensity you might crave can come from the reduction of the cooking liquids into a demiglase. Reduce that and you have a beautiful sauce to serve over the coq au vin.

My wife loved this recipe. The gravey didn't turn out for me but I think that was my fault. I will have to make a few measurement adjustments before I make it again but I would highly recommend.

I have served Coq a Vin to my customers in the past and although this is not traditionally how I have done it. This seems ok. Of course it was a process to make this dish but it always turned out fantastic. Rather than just dip the chicken in the red wine I browned the bird put in a roasting pan with the wine chicken stock thyme onions carrots and celery and then braised the parts for an hour or so the chicken would literally leap off the bone. Take the chicken out of the pan strain the red wine and reduce it to a sauce. Old world Coq a Vin. Naturally the chicken is going to turn purple but this is truly a fantastic dish is done correctly.

This is easy and tasty. The only difficult part is to saute the chicken. It took me about 20 mins to saute 3 lbs of chicken drumsticks other than that it is easy to make. The taste is very similiar to a Chinese Chicken & wine dish my mom used to make.

I used this as a great base recipe. As is it -can- be bland. The changes I made were...First I made the wine and stock into a marinade with 1 1/2 cups of Burgundy wine 1 3/4 cups of chicken stock 3 cloves sliced garlic(not crushed thinly sliced) 2 bay leaves and Italian seasoning garlic powder salt and pepper. I marinated the chicken in the wine and stock mixture for 2 hours prior to cooking. I sliced the onion into half moons and sauteed them setting them aside in a bowl. I dried the chicken on white paper towels before searing them in the large skillet I sauteed the onions in reserving the marinade. I returned the onions to the pan after searing both sides of the chicken well approx 8 minutes a side. I then poured in the wine/stock marinade and simmered it until it reduced to half than added the corn starch and water. I served it over white rice with a small bowl of garlic salt and pepper as extra seasoning if needed. It was needed but not much. The extra time marinating made the chicken super juicy and though my fiance is not a "fancy" man he absolutely loved it. Thanks for a basic recipe that has room to grow!!

You know....when your son says "Mommy do I have to eat the purple chicken"..something is not right. Granted I could have just screwed up the recipe. I did add a few of my own touches..but they aren't even worth repeating since we all ended up laughing at the food instead of eating it. I don't recomend this recipe at all. Once again...perhaps if follow the instructions EXACTLY..it might work out. I give this recipe 3 stars not for flavor or apperance but for the 3 people that laughed until they cried when I brought it to the table. ENJOY!

Next time I'd use skinless boneless chicken breast for this recipe. I found that the skin pulled away from the meat...didn't look appealing. But otherwise very tasty. Angela - Canada

The wine turns the chicken an uappetizing liver color. Other than being extremely salty - check out the sodium level - it's boring.

Easy and delicious French recipe! I had been craving this dish since I recently ate it at a restaurant. I didn't think that it would come close but it was actually quite tasty. I only had four chicken thighs on hand but I added two small red bliss potatoes two carrots two garlic cloves and some thyme. I also cooked the dish for over an hour on the stove to let it really soak up all the flavors. The house smelled so good! I will definitely try this one again for company.

we were looking for a meal that a man from france made for us. this was close but not nearly as flavorful. I think the author might make it easier for the reader if it said what type of red wine is best. i used a table wine.. i might try it again with melot or something with more flavor.

This was a quick and easy recipe. I cut the recipe in half and used 5 skinless chicken legs. It smelled great and tasted great but I found that there was hardly any gravy at the end and it was really thick and gooey looking.

Everyone keeps saying how the dish is bland - I say just add a bit more garlic salt and chicken stock to the mix and it was extremely flavorful if you ask me. If you're soaking chicken in wine - what color do you expect it to turn except purple?? Anyhow this is one of the best chicken recipe I've ever tasted. We added extra seasonings to the first "browning of the chicken" and although the sauce turns out a bit thin it tastes delicious and makes the chicken very juicy.

The dark meat chicken pieces were better while the white meat was on the dry side. Browned some bacon before browning the chicken used fresh garlic added some tomato paste and a couple sprigs of thyme.

Was very good the way I made it. I used a pack of 6 chicken wings added 1/4 tsp thyme and 2 tsp fresh minced garlic and used 2/3 cups red cooking wine and 1 1/3 cups chicken broth instead of 1 1/2 cups wine & stock. Cooked in a medium sized pot. Came out very tender and flavorful but only feeds 2-3. Maybe will try next time with drumsticks or thighs.

Fantastic - a perfect 10 stars! This was wonderful - so easy ingredients I had on-hand and a real crowd-pleaser! I used chicken breasts green onions a 2004 Shiraz and some fresh sliced mushrooms served over rice with buttered brussel sprouts. Looks very elegant on the plate delicious without a lot of extra fat or calories. Easily one of my top-10 favorite recipes of all time!

Good solid starting point. I added pearl onions and chopped mushrooms and used bacon grease instead of oil to brown the chicken put in a pat of butter to give the chicken a nice brown color. I served it over pureed cooked cauliflower and roasted brussel sprouts.

Loved this recipe! I've made traditional coq au vin and this definitely rivals it. I did add about 3 cloves of garlic to the oil when browning the chicken and increased the amount of wine and stock for more sauce. Even my picky daughter gobbled it up!

Amazing Recipe! I had the same exact chicken dish at a French place a few years ago and i am so happy i know how to make it now! I was a 1/2 cup short of wine it called for so next time it'll come out better but still came out great. I made it with seasoned sliced potatoes fried in olive oil and my husband LOVED it!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was so easy to make and very tasty. But I think it was so good because of the changes I made as follows: Added more liquid than called for so that at the end instead of using corn starch or flour I reduced the liquid down. And I doubled the onions. Also I used some of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute and Heinz 57 sauce (which added a lot of zip and nice color). All in all a very good dish and a keeper.

This recipe wasn t bad. I felt that the amount of wine used should have been at least doubled in order to have enough sauce. Also the recipe as-is lacked flavor and could have used some additional seasoning. However if the chicken would have had more wine to cook in the wine would have imparted more flavor to the dish and the lack of taste would no longer be an issue. As a starter recipe this is fine but dressing it up a bit doesn t hurt!

Love it! I've made a few tweaks such as using whole chicken breast tenderloins instead of shredding the meat and I usually add extra veggies as well but on the whole an easy & delicious recipe!

Nothing to rave about. I've never had coq au vin before so I thought I'd give this easy one a try. Only thing I did different was used chicken thighs instead of a whole cut up chicken. It lacks something maybe more salt or something. Not sure if I would try this again.

Very good easy version of the traditional recipe. My husband and I enjoyed it but it did not reheat very well the next day.

This is quite an easy and convenient take on the traditional recipe. Perhaps I cooked it longer than others but my chicken did not come out purple. I added more chicken stock as the sauce got a bit too thick even without using a thickening agent. I used a lot of salt pepper dried basil and fresh chopped parsley with I believe was key to adding flavor. I will try this recipe with mushrooms next time.

I love the tastes in Coq Au Vin but not all the trouble so I loved finding this recipe which I use as a base for my variations. I generally use skinless boneless thighs with excessive fat cut off; I dredge through flour and salt; I use a shallot rather than an onion; I cut up a couple strips of pre-cooked bacon (which has most of the fat already cooked off) and add once the chicken is mostly browned; I use jarred chicken stock so I can adjust taste tsp by tsp; I delete the cornstarch and garlic powder; I throw in a pinch of herbes de provence instead; I use more water and less wine; I add a can of petite diced tomatoes to pump up taste and make the color palatable to my picky kids. If it's still purple and I want them to eat it -- I hate to admit this -- I add a little ketchup. Doesn't hurt the taste but it does help make it look more red for them. Finally I add sliced mushrooms. Also I just pour the wine straight into the pan. I know this is a lot of changes but I was floundering until I found this base recipe so thank you.

I used boneless skinless chicken breast and it turned out very nice. My picky husband ate it and gave it his stamp of approval to make again. I was afraid he wouldn't eat it because of the purple color but as he said it definitely tastes better than it looks. Next time I'll probably add some different seasonings and use less onion.

I made this recipe with the modifications suggested by a previous reviewer and it is amazingly delicious. I think even without that it would have been a tasty dish however. The fresh garlic etc just pushed i over the top into gourmet territory.

Great easy recipe. Better with thighs drumsticks and wings than breasts. At the end I recommend just adding cornstarch not water.

My wife and I loved this recipe it keeps the dish simple and in line with the traditional Coq au Vin. I made a few changes following Baricot's excellent critique. I prefer chicken thighs they fit perfectly in the pan and the dark meat complements the wine. I used Cabernet. Thighs take a while to cook I simmered them for 40 minutes rather than 30. The additional time allows the wine to permeate the meat better. I sauteed the garlic cloves and the onion in the chicken drippings this integrates the onion and garlic flavor better with the sauce.I did not pour off the chicken drippings so as to improve the flavor of the sauce I also added thyme and a l/8 tsp of celery seed After simmering and removing the chicken I reduced the liquid for 10 minutes. The resulting liquid had a bite to it from the cabernet I added 3 oz of tomato sauce and half a can of condensed cream of celery soup.the tomato paste balanced the wine flavor and removed the bite. the cream of celery soup made the sauce creamier and added celery flavor. I whisked the gravy for 10 minutes and slowly added a small amount of cornstarch to thicken. Added canned mushrooms at the end portabellos or fresh mushrooms would have been better. the trick to this dish is to be patient with the sauce and spend some time reducing and whisking. the result was so good one would be pleased to be served it at a 4 star restaurant

After reading other similar recipes I decided to combine a few techniques in order to make this dish for my boyfriend's family. First of all I marinated the chicken in the red wine onions and spices for about an hour and then pulled out the chicken pieces to fry in a pan. I added the red wine sauce to another pan and let it simmer for quite awhile until it thickened up then added the chicken again. If the sauce isn't thick enough you can add a bit of flour to make it whatever consistency suits your tastes. I served with a side of mashed potatoes and cabbage (the only veggie we had in the house). Everyone really loved it and it was so easy!! I even baked a batch of brownies while cooking this!!

Loved it. Used Baricat's tips and used boneless breasts and served it over jasmine rice. Excellent! This is my first attempt at coq au vin and I was surprised how easy it was!

I followed the recipe to a tee. Be sure to make sure the chicken is av even thickness throughout - I pounded the chicken until it was about 1/4 inch thick to ensure an even cooking. The wine you use makes all the difference. I tend to prefer sweeter red wines and therefor my Coq Au Vin resulted in a sweeter taste as opposed to a red wine that is dry.

I made this a while back but forgot to rate it. It was very good and impressed my guests. The chicken didn't turn purple-maybe because I used wings? I have made it several times and it has always turned out great. It's especially good when the sauce is mixed in with white rice.

VERY tasty! I realized after I started cooking in the cast iron skillet that we had no lid so I made one of tin foil. It seemed to work fine but my husband thought the chicken dried out a little. Make sure you have a cover.

This was amazing! I made some minor changes just because that's how I roll. My wife gave this 108 out of 10 stars lol. So I used thighs with the skin on - I cooked a few strips of bacon and then browned the chicken in the bacon fat. I also cooked the onions in the fat for a few minutes too. I added about 1/2 t thyme with the wine and stock. I also added a few tablespoons of tomato sauce to tone down the purple color and add a little zing. After cooking the chicken in the liquid I removed it and cooked down the sauce a little. I wanted it even thicker so I added a touch of corn starch to a splash of wine mixed it and dumped it in to thicken it a touch more. I removed and discarded the skin from the chicken after cooking shredded the chicken a bit and served this with mashed potatoes. I crumbled the little bit of bacon that I used for rendering the fat over top and it was fabulous. Give this recipe a try. The people that gave it bad reviews are probably folks who didn't reduce the sauce or used white meat chicken and let it dry out. Use dark meat with the skin and remove it after cooking!! Adds so much flavor and moisture.

I made this and enjoyed it but it was difficult to get the sauce to thicken properly. I liked the red colour unlike a lot of other people here and I served it over rice. It was delicious but a lot of work and I don't think I would make it again anytime soon. Maybe once or twice a year.

Not enough liquid to create a sauce - I will add much more next time as it was a bit dry over rice. Will try it again though as the recipe was tasty and easy to put together.

I don't know how to add a recipe here but my take is: bacon 1/2lb cut up...shallots/garlic..salt/pepper..white wine (doesnt turn it colour..chicken stock..thyme...rosemary...butter/flour to thicken later...mushrooms optional crisp bacon then remove leaving fat brown chicken a few moments both sides add garlic and shallots to lightly cook return bacon cover chicken with wine & chicken (I add about half a bottle white wine first and let it simmer a bit then add the chicken stock) add rosemary thyme to taste - I usually do a couple pinches. Cook low heat covered. About 10 minutes before it's done I taste broth for flavour usually at this time adding more thyme. In a separate pot add 2tabl butter and flour to pot add some stock it will thicken quick then add back to coq au vin for a nice gravy. cook cover a few more moments Excellent with mash potatoes as the gravy is soooo good you will want to eat it as a soup

It made great use of the Barefoot Sweet Red Blend that I like to drink!  Very flavorful. Be careful with the oil. When you add cornstarch at the end, it separates the oil from the wine and you will have extra oil sitting in the pan if you added too much in the beginning.
