Simple and comforting. Recipe didn't specify whole wheat pasta, but descriptive sentance did. That's what I used. I added a bit more minced garlic, like a whole other clove and fresh parmesan. We ate every little bit. Sometimes, it dosen't have to be overdone to be a good recipe.

While this is good, I can't say that the family was wild about it.  The fresh thyme could easily be substituted with basil or oregano if you prefer another flavor.  I didn't have the fresh thyme, so I used a rounded teaspoon of pesto sauce for each sprig of thyme.  Instead of using 3/4 c of salted pasta water to make the sauce, I used a smaller amount of chicken broth and then simmered it just a little to get it to thicken.  We also didn't think it needed as much Parmesan cheese as the recipe states.

I just made this for dinner and I really, really enjoyed it. Such a nice simple recipe. I did make 2 minor changes, I did not use the green onion because I didn't have any, and I just used some Italian seasoning in place of the fresh thyme. Delicious!

My 3yo and I really enjoyed this.  I didnt have any green onions so I used a little extra onion.  I also used italian seasoning instead of fresh thyme and added some red pepper flakes.  When I added the pasta water it seemed to watery to me so I cooked that down just a little before adding the pasta and parmesan. Delicious!

A Yummy Spring/Summer meal!! Great as is (with a little less pasta water), but AMAZING adding whole grape tomatoes when adding the chicken, and baby spinach added at the last 2-3 minutes just to wilt (no need for the pasta water when tomatoes pop and yield their juices!!).

Yummy when I cook with pasta it is always wheat or whole grains and I love what the onions do to the pasta. I also have added peppers to the slow cooking sauce so delicious..

Yummy! But not amazing. Kind of like chicken noodle soup minus the soup. I'd make it again.

I used 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning since I had no fresh thyme on hand. Also was a little low on Parmesan cheese. Used a little less spaghetti water and added a few Tbsp of white wine. Next time will make sure to use the full amount of parm cheese, use some chicken broth as someone else recommended as well. Very easy and tasty!

Ehhh just ok, we felt it was missing something, like flavor. I didn't have fresh thyme, so could only use ground. To me it was pretty bland, even adding in red peppers

So I did not have Parmesan cheese, but I did have a giant block of sharp cheddar cheese, so I used that instead which turned out GREAT!

Restaurant quality recipe! I added cherry tomatoes and cilantro. I also used left over baked breaded chicken sliced thinly. Family raved that they tasted something similar at Olive Garden! Will be serving this again soon!

The flavor of this dish was great, but next time I think I'm going to add something green (broccoli? peas?) to make this a stand alone dish.

My son looked at his plate and you could see he wasn't too happy.  He likes his food very straightforward.  Luckily, he's a teenager and always hungry, so he tried it.  He ended up having second helpings.  The whole family liked it.  It was simple, tasty, and a great way to stretch chicken and help out the family budget.

Love this my girlfriend asked me to make it again. I added cellontro and extra onions to increase flavor.
