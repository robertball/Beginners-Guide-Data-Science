Thanks to the birds we have a bumper crop of wild black raspberries this summer.  They are tiny but very tasty.  The recipe is easy and delicious.    I didn't need 1/2 C. of the lemon juice/sugar glaze. 1/4 of a cup would would suffice.  My oven runs hot so I baked it 50 minutes and it was perfect.

Soooo good!  I used blueberries instead of raspberries, and topped it with a little cream cheese icing!  It was absolutely delicious
