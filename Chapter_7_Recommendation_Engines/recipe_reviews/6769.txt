very good. i halved this recipe. used butter instead of the shortening and used one packet of instant yeast. after it rose i deflated and rolled it out like you would when youre going to make cinnamon rolls. then spread a layer of cream chease (8oz)that was mixed with 2 T of sugar and 3/4 to 1 tsp of vanilla extract. then on top of that layer i spread some raspberry filling i had made by putting 2 cups frozen raspberries, 2 T lemon juice 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup corn starch in a saucepan and simmer for 15 min. then let cool completely. rolled it up formed into a ring then made cuts with a knife 3/4ths of the way to the inside of the ring. let rise and sprinkle with streusal topping and cook till golden brown at 375. you can do anything with this dough! thanks

After making a double batch of Carol's recipe I found that the ingredients and qtys worked very well together and produced a very good elastic dough just right for braiding. My wife said it was the best bread she had ever tasted. It makes the best toast too. Bill Axtell 11/25/01

Had this in my Fleischman's Recipe book from years ago.  When I went to bake this year . . everything is geared toward fast rising dry yeast.  this is an old recipe, like the one I followed for years . . except I add all milk.
Lets go back to the basics.

This is one of the best sweet doughs I've ever used. I have been looking for a really good sweet dough recipe for years and have finally found the "one". We are eastern European and my grandmother used to make a cake called cocosh. It's basically a sweet yeast dough that is filled with chocolate, rolled and baked in log form. The other more common known version is with poppy seed filling sometimes called mohn roll. This dough was perfect! Baked up light, fluffy and soft. Very simple to make and even easier to work with. Thank you so much for this recipe. I can't wait to try and make a challah with it.

My family LOVED this bread! I made a half recipe (2 free-form loaves) and one loaf was gone before they where cool. I baked this at 350 for 30 to 45 minutes. I used my baking stone, so the oven had to pre-heat for a hour, so the stone could heat up. It's great plain or with extras, but my favorite is to brush the crust with honey as soon as it gets out of the oven. This bread is also perfect for french toast.

I live in Mexico, at 5200 feet above sea level.  The sweet rolls here are fairly tasteless and finding this recipe was a godsend!  I made two adjustments for the high altitude suggested in the Joy of Cooking.   #1 added fake buttermilk (3 Tablespoons of unflavored yogurt to 1 C of milk).  I re-measured the 1 Cup of milk but the dough was still too wet. No problem, I just continued adding flour until the dough didn't stick to the bowl. #2 high altitude trick - don't let the dough rise to double it's size; punch the dough down when it has only risen half of it's size, but, let is rise twice before punching it down and rolling out.  The brown sugar here is very grainy so I wasn't sure how the cinnamon rolls would turn out but everyone raved about the end product.

Amazing for cinnamon buns, and exactly what I was looking for. 

I didn't have fresh yeast cake, so I used the equivalent of two packets of regular red star dry yeast (4-1/2 teaspoons). I also used butter instead of shortening. 

In order for the recipe to work with dry yeast I changed the method as well. I used warm water and put the water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl together. While that sat for a few minutes, I put the milk in a pan, scalded it, took it off the heat then added the butter. Once it had cooled enough to not cook the eggs (below 60C/140F), I poured it into the eggs I'd beaten in another bowl, then poured that whole thing into the yeast mixture. Then I added the flour and salt. 

I ended up using less flour than the recipe called for, probably because I wasn't using moist yeast cake. I had over a cup left over, so I would suggest starting with six cups for this recipe and then using the seventh on the counter while kneading. 

I found this dough quite tough to knead and work with, but I think that's a good thing because I can see how easy it would be to use the dough for braiding and shaping. It also baked into the perfect texture I was looking for: dense but not chewy or heavy. It was also not too sweet, but left a nice aftersweetness in my mouth. 

I used one recipe of this dough for two batches of cinnamon buns. On each rolled out piece of dough I spread about three tablespoons of butter, then sprinkled half my cinnamon mixture which was 1/2 cup of brown suga

I baked at 350 but maybe could be a little cooler like 335 - 325 would be my next try since I like the light in colour and softer.  Excellent cinnamon buns sweet bread dough. I also used less flour in this recipe.

This dough was awesome!  I goofed a bit and only had one egg so added a little more water to incorporate all the flour.  It was a shaggy dough and I maybe kneaded it  2  min. or less.  It rose beautifully and working with it was a dream--no stickiness and was able to roll out easily. I divided the dough into 3 pieces and made sweet rolls with one and froze the others.  Hope they do as well as the first batch.
