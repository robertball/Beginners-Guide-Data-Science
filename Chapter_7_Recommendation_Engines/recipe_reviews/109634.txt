Yikes......sorry but this has an unusual mix of flavors. I like caramel, apples, and peanut butter but combined it produces a puzzling flavor. At first it resembled apple cider vinegar but then there is a peanut butter after-taste. I scaled this recipe down to one serving using the servings calculator. I juiced my own apple and drizzled some caramel inside the glass before serving. I would not recommend this recipe...

The aste was very strong and not very sweet, had to add a ton of vanilla ice cream to tone it down and still, three diffrent people [Including me] said this tastes like you put a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich, with the bread, into the blender. Not a great taste or texture.

i would substitute the apple juice and chunky apple sauce with fresh apples either cooked or uncooked then blended in a blender.
