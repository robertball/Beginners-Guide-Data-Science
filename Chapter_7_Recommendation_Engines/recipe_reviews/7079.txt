Great tasting bread and texture.  I don't use a bread machine since I don't think the texture comes out as nice as oven baking.  For people without machines, this recipe couldn't be simpler.  Warm the milk and add the sugar and the yeast. Stir and let sit for about 15 min. to proof (the yeast will foam). If it doesn't foam, your milk probably wasn't warm enough. Then add the foamy yeast mixture to the rest of the ingredients and mix.  This dough is easy to mix by hand so you really don't need the KitchenAid.  The dough will be sticky. So after mixing, cover and let it sit in the bowl to rise 1-2 hours. Punch down and let rise again or form into rolls at this time.  Super quick and easy.  If you want a sweeter, richer bread, increase sugar to 1/2 cup and add one extra egg yolk. If makikng one large loaf, bake for about 30-35 min. at 375.

This bread is awesome. I'm kind of picky, I hate the way bread machine bread comes out. So I add the ingredients and set it to the dough cycle. Then I put the dough in my loaf pan and bake at 350Â° for 20 minutes, turning half way through. It comes out absolutely gorgeous. It is wonderful toasted. My boyfriend loves it. I no longer buy loaves of bread from the store, I simply bake this bread on the weekends. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I have made this with skim milk, whole milk, and half and half, it comes out tasty every time.  I tried egg nog once and it was disgusting.  I use butter instead of margarine. The first few hundred loaves I made I used Red Star bread machine yeast and the results were better than with regular yeast. The difference is a bigger fluffier loaf of bread.  I used Mediterrainian sea salt a few times but it seemed to make no difference.  I have made this with cold egg and milk and it comes out the same as having the ingredients at room temperature.  The loaf comes out big and my biggest problem was storage of a gargantuan loaf of bread.  A couple of things worked out.  First, you can slice it up and put it in a couple of zip lock bags.  Second, you can
store it in a Renolyd's oven cooking bag.  This bread makes excellent toast(oh,yes), French toast, stuffing, sandwiches, and bread crumbs. It has a sweet flavor.  It is addicting, so be careful!

Our entire family has been loving this bread! Not too sweet, with a nice medium/light crumb - simple recipe just as it is!  I just use my kitchenaid mixer, let it rise 1 hr., punch it down & shape it, let it rise again 15 min. and bake!  (rolls are my favorite)  Dough freezes superbly after 2nd rise, then pull them out anytime for baking.

Absolutely the BEST bread ever out of a bread machine.  I did not alter the recipe whatsoever...and it turned out perfect.  It's the first bread I've ever made that actually has a "yeast" smell, as well as the taste.  Please share any other recipes of this nature!  Thanks a million!

If you REALLY want to taste sweetbread at it's absolute best, try buttering one side of a nice thick slice and grilling it in the frying pan. Tastes just like danish!

No bread machine, just used my Kitchen Aid mixer. I proofed the yeast with the sugar and warm milk in the mixer bowl for ten minutes, added the egg and melted butter, then all the dry ingredients. This dough needed another half cup of flour, I just added it by leveled 1/4 cup until it formed into a ball and jumped on the bread hook. I kneaded it with the hook for about five minutes, then formed it into a ball and let it rise on my warm oven in a greased bowl, covered. Once it doubled, I thought I'd be creative and make a Cinnamon Swirl bread. I rolled it out into a long rectangle, then sprinkled brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon over the dough, then rolled it up. I made sure the edges were sealed and set it to rise on the warm oven in the loaf pan for another hour or so. I baked this for about a half hour or so in 350* oven, or until it smelled done. After that, I set out to make a batch just as recipe stated. Either way, it's a wonderful bread with just a touch of sweetness and richness. Very soft, close to a bakery bread in texture. Amazing bread. This one's a keeper, no matter which way I choose to use it. THREE DAYS LATER: I've now made this bread six times and we just can't get enough, either in cinnamon-swirl form or regular. Outstanding!

Excellent bread!! I live at a high altitude (6,000 ft.) and have trouble getting bread to rise properly, but this one was easy with a few adjustments and turned out beautifully! It rose to perfection, had a golden crust, and just the right texture, and was oh so tasty! I added 1 TBS of milk, decreased sugar by 1 tsp. and yeast by 1/2 tsp. and added a pinch of salt. Try this one, you won't regret it!

I tried this recipe twice and both times it overflowed in the bread machine and burnt. Anyone else have this problem? I even punched it down on the rise cycle.

Wonderful bread and so easy.  I tried it buttered and cooked in a fry pan as another reviewer suggested.  Then I drizzled honey on it and it was simply incredible.

This bread was so delicious - It does not last long in my house!  I made the dough for this in my bread machine, but baked it in the oven because I don't like the shape of the bread machine pan.  I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup, but otherwise followed the directions - using the "dough" setting on my machine.  Once it finished rising in the machine, I took it out, kneaded it a few times, shaped it, put it in a greased 9 inch cake pan, covered it, then set it to rise for 1 hour.  Once risen, I baked the bread at 375 for about 25 minutes.  Yum!

I followed this recipe exactly, but found that it doesn't state what size loaf this makes so i was not sure of what setting to choose on my bread machine (1lb, 1.5 lb or 2 lb)  I went with the middle ground and chose 1.5 lb but found that it didn't cook quite long enough, so I think the 2lb loaf selection would have been a better choice.  Because it didn't cook quite long enough it did come out a bit doughy, but the flavor was still wonderful and I think that the next time I make this, using the 2lb option, that it will be perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Delicious but the crust was a little dark for my taste. Next I might decrease the sugar by a teaspoon or so.

I just made these tonight as rolls and let me tell you they were awesome!  This is how I'm going to make them from now on.  They would even be good as buns for hamburgers or pulled pork.  I just put it in my bread machine on the dough setting and then put on a flour/greased cookie sheet and brushed with egg white then baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  I've made this in the bread machine on the sweet setting like suggested many times.  We always loved this bread but sometimes it would rise too high and get on the bread machine.  It always seemed like everytime I made this it turned out slightly different but we still loved it so I thought I would try the rolls and I'm going to make it this way from now on.  I got about 11 rolls out of this and there was pretty decent size so if you make them a little smaller you'll get more. This is probably my favorite bread that I've made in my bread machine!
UPDATE: I now make these as rolls all the time.  You don't need to brush them with anything if you don't want and they are better for leftovers.  Egg whites look pretty but they get gooey and sticky if there are any leftover.  Sometimes I brush them with butter too, but if you are planning on having an leftover don't put anything on them, they will be so moist the next day!  Love this recipe!

Wondeful bread! I've made it a dozen times if not more! Some other fun variations.....I've used this recipe and added 2 TB fresh-dried rosemary and it was wonderful!! I've also added fresh minced garlic and it was great! I'm totally committed to this recipe and have it memorized! Make it, you'll see!

This is a very good, very simple recipe. The loaf turned out beautifully from the machine. It is not as sweet or buttery as some recipes I've had and that was a little disappointing, but it's ease to make is very good.

This recipe is closest to the real Portuguese sweet bread you buy in Rhode Island.  My husband is a full blooded Portuguese and loves this.  He says it reminds him of home.  This is great.  Thanks

We used to only have this bread at Christmas and Thanksgiving because it was so hard to make by hand.  The hand-made bread is still admittedly better, still special, but this is a good version for regular use.  I like my bread to be a little sweeter so I add about six packets of aspartame (Sweet 'N Low) to the recipe.  (I know that might sound funny, but our family recipe calls for aspartame, and if you just add more sugar, the bread crust becomes really dark.)  Don't use Nutrasweet; Nutrasweet doesn't hold up under high temperatures and therefore is not useful for baking.

I CANT STOP EATING THIS BREAD!  Even my 18 month old is loving this.  I added 
butter instead of margerine, and 3/4 tsp of vanilla.  Next time, Im adding lemon
juice instead of vanilla!  Thanks for the soft, fluffy, yummy recipe!

This recipe IS awesome!  The flavor is just what I was looking for.  I wanted a rich sweet bread to use as a base for a cinnamon swirl raisin bread.  This is the one I'll use from now on!  I had problems, but it is definitely NOT the recipe -- it's my breadmaker.  I've made some great breads over the years by hand.  Since I got this bread machine every one of the breads I've tried have not risen as they should.  I've tried focaccia, pizza dough, pita, white & wheat breads, and have been disappointed.  It's always the same thing -- the rising.  I have not tried doing a bread entirely in it because I like to shape doughs as I wish, depending on what I'm making.  I've tried different forms of yeast to no avail.  I will make this bread again, by hand, but it is's in the 90's here & too hot to heat up the kitchen.   Before rating a recipe please be sure your complaints are actually due to the recipe and instructions, and not due to human or mechanical error!

Outstanding Bread Recipe! The ease of making it in a bread machine makes this recipe one of my favorites. I have made this bread 5 times already and it comes out perfect each time. It got raving compliments from my Hawaiian Portuguese friends too. They *loved* it. I will sometimes use this bread as a base recipe and add in 1/4 c. of finely chopped coconut, 1 tsp.of coconut extract and use coconut milk in place of the milk to make a coconut variation.  Another twist I use with this bread is to add 1/4 c. of crystallize ginger and 2 tsp. of Lemon juice to the recipe.  I also replace the white sugar with the brown turbinado sugar.  Topped with honey butter made with Lilikoi honey and this bread is ONOLICIOUS!! Merci beaucoup for sharing!

This is delicious and has a wonderful texture.  My bread machine doesn't have a sweet bread setting, so I used the basic setting/light crust and it came out great.  It rises very high, so you may have to prick the top during the last rise to keep it from overflowing.  I'm DEFINITELY adding this to my repertoire.  Thank you for sharing this Jennifer!

I make this as sweet rolls.
  
I roll the bread out and fill with the following mix:
I mix Â½ stick butter with Â¼ cup cinnamon and Â½ cup sugar for the filling.  

Then I roll it up into a log, slice, and put in muffin cups.

While these are cooking, I take 1c raisins and 1/8c merlot (have also had success with RC cola as a wine sub) and heat for 5 min on stovetop - just enough to hydrate the raisins.  

I use this raisin sauce ontopof the rolls instead of icing.

The best basic bread I've tried yet. I didn't have any bread flour so I used half white whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour and added to that about 4 tsp. wheat gluten.  For those of you who don't have a bread machine: heat the milk in a saucepan until it reaches 115 degrees F (the liquid in yeast breads should be 105-115), then mixed it with the yeast and sugar. Let sit for 10 min, or until foamy. Mix with flour and salt. Add the egg and margarine (I used a mixture of canola oil and butter, 50/50). Stir until dough *sort of* comes together. Dump dough out onto a floured counter; knead a few times, or until dough comes together. Let rise in the mixing bowl for 1 hour. (I cover the bowl with a damp towel I heated in the microwave.) Preheat oven to 350 F. Check the dough; it should be doubled in size. When poked, it should leave a nice indentation of your finger, not spring back. Gently dump the dough out on the counter and gently shape. Place in a greased (I used metal) bread pan (I think it was a 9x5) and bake for 30-32 minutes. Take out of pan. Let cool for 5 minutes (if at all possible; I didn't because my mouth was watering) and slice. This bread was fabulous. I didn't really change the ingredients at all (except the flour), just the instructions. Thank you for a great recipe!

Only slightly sweet.  Not the Portuguese sweet bread I'm used to getting in Fall River, MA from Portuguese bakers.  Tasted fine, but was more of a sandwich white bread than a sticky, yummy sweet dessert bread.  Wouldn't make again.

Wonderful recipe!  It was nearly as simple as using a mix, rose higher than any bread I've made, baked beautifully and tasted fantastic.  My kids really love this stuff and my 7 year old could nearly make it herself!   Thanks for this one!

This bread is excellent.  As with a lot of other reviewers here, I baked my bread in the oven instead of a bread machine.  It's great as a single loaf, or split into rolls.  Toast this bread if you know what's good for you.

Delicious!  Don't have a bread maker, but didn't need one.  I warmed the milk and added the sugar and yeast, waited 15 minutes and then added mixed by hand with the rest of the ingredients.  After mixing for about 2-3 minutes (don't really knead just mix because dough is very sticky and didn't want to add more flour), covered and let it rest, took 2 hours to double (slower than expected), punched down, transfered to greased 9" loaf pan, and let rise another 15-20 minutes. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  Came out perfect, slightly sweat, great texture, everyone loved it and was gone the first day!

Excellent recipe! Thanks so much. The first time, I reduced the sugar to about a 1/5 of a cup--and I didnt have bread flour so used all-purpose--was a nice light loaf. Great texture! 
The second time, I followed the recipe precisely--except I decide to run it through the bread mixer dough cycle, then took it out--let it rise about 30 minutes, and put it in the oven for 30 minute at 350 degrees. Awesome recipe--delicious--thanks!!!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it turned out excellent in my Black and Decker bread machine. It does rise very high (touched right to the glass window) but not so high that there was any chance of lifting the top off of the machine. Other reviewers mentioned that the crust gets very dark but I thought the crust was a perfect colour (not too dark, not too light) I set it on the light crust setting. Probably one of the best breads I've ever had. It was slightly sweet, light and fluffy and tasted great right out of the bread machine or toasted the next day. I can't say enough about it, just give it a try.

A great bread and it taste delicious too.The only complaint I have is the bread rises too high after it is baked and I think I will  have to scale it down to 8 servings the next time I bake this bread. By the way , I am from Malaysia and baking bread using the bread machine is still quite new to us.

The taste of the bread was great-but-the top of the bread was not done baking when the sweetbread cycle was over.  I made it twice and it happened both times.

I love this recipe...tweaked it a litte...instead of all milk I used 3/4 milk and 1/4 heavy cream, I also used real butter and increased the amount to 5 tablespoons (I know..wow right - you don't watch carbs when planning on eating sweet bread). I was actually trying for a sweet butter bread.  But the end results were fantastic!!..it only last 2 days in my house.  Not sure about the other reviewers who said it ran over..never happened to me...also, put your crust color to light...that should clear up the darkening of the crust.  Thanks so much for sharing this simple to make goodness!!!

Since I don't have a bread machine, I relied on the tips/methods of others here and did the following:  I combined the warmed milk with the sugar, 2 Tbs. honey and the yeast and let it foam.  I then added this mixture to the rest of the ingredients in my KitchenAid mixer and stirred for 3 minutes with the dough hook attachement.  I then kneaded it on medium speed (2) for about 8 minutes.  I transferred the dough to a lightly-oiled bowl, covered and let rise for 2 hours.  Punched the dough down and let it rise for another hour.  Baked the bread in a greased 9" x 5" loaf pan for just about 30 minutes at 375 degrees.  I found the bread very tasty, with just the right sweetness (witht the addition of the honey), but just a tad dense in texture.  I may try making this bread again, but will free form it rather than making it in a loaf pan.

So yummy!!! Wonderfully moist bread! I'll probably added just a little more flour and/or bake it a little longer next time because it was a little gooey when it came out of the oven.

Really good, but I had several issues with it (you need to understand that I am Portuguese myself and I live in an area where lots of great Potuguese sweet bread is made, so needless to day I'm a little particular.) First of all, this is yummy but NOT SWEET ENOUGH TO BE PORTUGUESE SWEET BREAD. I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup and it still wasn't enough. I think I'll try 3/4 or even 1 cup next time. Also the dough is wayyyy too watery. Either decrease the milk or plan on adding 1/2 cup more flour to the dough. And my personal opinion is that it comes out much better when you bake the dough in the oven instead of the bread machine. Thanks for the recipe!!

Not sweet enough for me.  My best friend is portuguese, and I must have had a different version of this bread.  Most likely it depends on the region of Portugal.  I surprised her with it, and she laughed.  Sorry!

This is an excellent recipe, in fact it's probably my favorite in terms of bread machine breads.  I tend to add a little extra sugar and also a little vanilla - it's great!

A very tender bread that the whole family enjoyed.  The sugar content is likely responsible for the overly browned crust on a "regular" crust setting.  A dark crust setting is not recommended.

I just had a few slices toasted with butter, and it's delicious! I preferred to bake it in a 9x5 loaf pan in the oven. So after going through the Dough cycle in the bread machine, I removed the dough, kneaded a few strokes then transferred to the prepared pan. I then covered it and let it rise (it rose nicely) in a warmed oven for about an hour. I then baked it at 350 for ~20 min. (Thanks to other reviewers for info on this method.) I usually cut back on sugar on anything I make, but here, I think I'd prefer a bit MORE sugar. Thanks Jennifer for the easy and very good recipe!

Delicious! I made in bread machine using dough cycle then baked in the oven so there wouldn't be a hole from the paddle. The whole family loves it! Will be making it to give as Christmas gifts with homemade jam.

MommyfromSeattle was right. This recipe is great. I followed the recipe almost to a t except I don't have a bread machine (or a sweet bread setting). I did add yeast and sugar with milk and let it sit. Yeast usually has to be added around 110 or 115 degree, so I warmed the milk to that temp. If u add it at a higher it'll kill the yeast. I then added he rest of the ingredients and let it sit for 2 hours. I also let it sit for another 20 minutes before baking it in the oven at 365. The bread is really not that sweet so add some honey and sugar if you desire a sweeter bread.

Wonderful recipe!  Perfect amount of sweetness as stated before.  I am so happy to have this recipe thank you for sharing.  It's simple and easy to follow even without a breadmaker.  I used my kitchen aid dough hook and mixed all ingredients and allowed to rise for 1 hr and then punched down and shaped into rolls and let rise for another 15 minutes.  They were wonderful.  My family all enjoyed them and they were gone quick.  Thanks to previous reviewers as well for tips on using the kitchen aid,making rolls and using all purpose flour(as a substitute). I can't wait to do more with the recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.  Update: 12/15/08  I made these again last night and have made them numerous times.  We love these rolls.  I have made the dough in the bread machine and in the mixer with dough hook and both work great.  The mixer is quick and easy.  Just Warm the Milk add the yeast and sugar and allow to proof until foamy (10 mins or so) and then throw in the rest of the ingredients and mix and form into rolls or bread loaf.  Allow to rise for about 30 mins-1hr and then Bake at 350 F for about 20 minutes or until lightly browned.  I usually butter the tops also.
My husband says these would be great with Jelly the next morning.  This recipe makes 12 rolls.

Instead of cooking the bread in my machine,  I used the dough only cycle. I then placed the dough on a pizza stone and brushed it with egg whites. I baked it at a 350 degree oven for 35 mins. It came out perfect, the bread had just right amount of sweetness, density and chewiness that can't be store bought. Yummy!

OK used the sweetbread setting on my bread machine but took the loaf out before the second rise.  I put it in my bread pan and proofed it by putting the covered bread pan on a heating pad set on low for an hour then cooked it at 325F in my convection oven for 30 minutes.  My oven won't go lower than 150F and the oven lights are LED so even they won't heat the oven.  The bread turned out wonderful.  I did brush it with a little egg white and water before baking and it added just a little extra texture.

This is easily my favorite sweet bread recipe.  I made a couple of adjustments/additions and it turned out very well.  I added an extra tablespoon of milk and I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar.  I also added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  I made the dough in my machine, then baked it in the oven for 45 minutes at 300 degrees.  I made french toast with this bread and it is simply amazing - topped it with butter and powdered sugar.  I had never had french toast with nuts before and this was superb!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Wow! This loaf came out looking beautiful!  Plus, it tasted amazing! Perfect texture and flavor. The best bread I've made in my machine! (And it actually tastes like my Gram's Portuguese bread recipe!) Definitely a keeper! (note: I used 2 yolks instead of 1 egg and ran out of bread flour so used some all purpose.)

YUM!  Made this last night and am making another batch this morning.  I am going to make it just a bit sweeter, roll in smaller round balls, fry and then roll in powdered sugar.  Oh yes, this will be made often!

This sweet bread is better than most Portuguese sweet bread you will eat coming from even the sweetest old portuguese lady (sorry Grandma). I use my bread machine dough setting then shape into 12 rolls and let rise again before baking at 350 degrees until just browned. I also love this recipe because it can be easily adjusted to make a little or tons. Many recipes for portuguese sweet bread make a huge amount. Thanks for sharing!

For bread taste and quality I would give this five stars, but I too had trouble with the quantity in my 2lb bread machine. The first time I made it it cooked into the top. The next time I made it I reduced the portions from 12 to 8, and it was better, but still almost too much. Make sure to use the light setting. The crust is beautiful and flaky, almost like a croissant. Delicious!

Very good. I baked it in a non-stick tube pan. It came out like a huge doughnut. I also brushed with an egg wash before baking, covered with foil half way through baking and buttered the top when finished baking and still hot. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy Easy Easy - and soooo delicious!  I have just recently started trying to make my own bread, and have had a lot of 'learning experiences' to start out with.  (ie, FLOPS!)  Which I do expect, but it can be frustrating.  It was sooo nice to try a new recipe and just have it work, and be delicious and exactly what I expected....

I didnt do it in the bread machine, followed some of the instructions in other reviews... including adding the extra egg yolk, upping the sugar to .5 cups and doing an eggwash on before baking. One loaf, 375 for 35 minutes....

One thing I would stress to others - this is a very wet dough, it seems too wet when you first let it rise. Mine was almost a batter and I was really worried!  

I did a very light kneading before the second rise and incorporated a bit more flour, but left it a fairly sticky loose dough.  I had to resist the urge to add a lot more flour to stiffen it up, and apparently got it about right. Just add barely enough to make it shape-able, and the end product will be light and tender.

wonderful bread! it was great with butter spread on it fresh from the oven. i made this by hand as i found out my bread machine was broken this morning. :( it was a very easy recipe, even for doing it by hand. i followed the recipe exactly and then kneaded the dough by hand on a floured board. then i placed in an oiled bowl and covered it with plastic wrap. i let it rise for an hour and a half, punched down and let rise again in the loaf pans. i brushed the top with egg wash to make it glazy and brown looking. i baked at 350 for 30 minutes. i'm portuguese and sweetbread is a big thing here in hawaii and this is THE BEST i've ever had. my roommate and parents loved it too! baked a few more loaves for christmas presents.

Pretty good - got rave reviews.  Added the zest of a quarter of a lemon and that added a really nice flavor.  Used a microplane to get really small zest pieces.

This was an OK bread.  Like other reviewers, the crust did get a little too hard and brown at the end, but the inside was a great texture and flavor.  My infant son likes that part!  I will continue to play with this recipe, but I am still looking for a staple white bread recipe for my bread machine.

My sweetie loved this bread.  I don't have a bread machine, so used my Kitchen Aid.  Had to add more flour (I used regular unbleached) as dough was too sticky to work with.  Well worth the effort and I agree with everyone that this is an excellent bread for french toast.

This was fabulous!  We are overseas and don't much care for the very stale bread available at the grocery store.  This recipe has enabled us to have toast, sandwiches and bread with meals.  Thank you, Jennifer.

This bread is more like a slightly sweet white bread than a "sweet bread", in my opinion. It does taste very good, and I think next time I make it I will use a little vanilla, as some reviewers have done. Seems like the bread would benefit from the added flavor. I decided to try mixing the ingredients in my bread machine (as one reviewer suggested) and then baking in the oven for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. I think this would have turned out great had I done exactly as this reviewer did. She baked the bread 10 minutes, turned it, and baked another 10. I didn't turn my bread during baking, and as a result, one side was very brown and the other was not quite done at the end of 20 minutes. So, make sure you turn the bread after 10 minutes of baking if you plan to use a conventional oven instead of the bread machine. I will say it smelled VERY good while baking. Just wish it hadn't turned out so brown on one side.

i was expecting a 'sweet hawaiian' type bread but this was still very good.  it makes a good white bread for pb&j sandwiches.
i dont have a sweet bread cycle so i used white bread/light crust.
i ran out of bread flour, so i used 1/2 all purpose and an oil/shortening substitute instead of margarine.
this will definately be our new white bread recipe as it doesnt completely rip apart when sliced.

I was making banana bread today and too late realized I'd oiled and floured 2 loaf pans when I only needed one so I popped this into the breadmaker on the sweet dough setting and then tossed it into the extra loaf pan--let it rise and then baked for 20-25 minutes at 350.  NO WONDER IT HAS 52 reviews!!!  Wonderful, easy and delicious!!

This bread is delicious! My husband just likes it sweeter so I put 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 and I use the dough cycle and then make rolls in the oven. I was able to get 10 good sized dinner  rolls after  letting it rise for about 40 minutes after the dough cycle.

Made it last night just as described, except 1/2 cup sugar so it would be a little sweeter. Cold milk and egg, bread machine yeast. Turned out great. There was only 1 slice left when I got home today, so the bread machine is running again tonight. It's a hit at my house.

Very good.
I read many of the previous reviews and added a 2nd yolk and increased the sugar to 1/2 cup and also added 1 tsp of honey. I wanted the bread to be sweet.

I made the dough using the bread maker using manual cycle. I removed the dough - its sticky - flour your hands - shaped it into a greased/lightly floured stone round pan, and allowed the dough to rise a second time for 30 additional minutes.

I baked it at 350 for 25minutes, it turned out perfectly.

I really enjoyed this bread while it was baking. The smell was absolutely lovely. I did add a tsp of vanilla, because I do that with most all my breads. It did sink a bit in the middle, but not too bad. That is why I only gave it four stars.

This recipe is AMAZING. My bread machine broke, so I did this by hand. 

Same ingredients but I added an extra egg white. I heated the milk on the stove and mixed everything together. This dough is VERY sticky, I floured my hands, and it was still sticky. I put it in a lightly floured loaf pan at 375 for 30 minutes (or until hollow tapping with fingers on top) Delicious!!

This was pretty good fresh.  Was a little dry the day after.  I did not use a bread machine. I proofed the yeast in my kitchenaid mixer, and mixed/kneaded in that... then put in warm oven for 1 hr to rise, then put it in a loaf pan, let it rise for another 30 mins, baked at 325 for 35 mins.

Loved this!  I used a little bit more sugar based on the reviews. I also don't have a bread maker so followed another review to make it by hand.  I love how dense it was! Will definately make this again

Really good recipe on it's own. I take the sugar to 1/2 cup, though.

For the world's best French toast, I add 2 tsp. of cinnamon, slice into thick slices and dry on the countertop overnight. I pop the extra slices in the freezer to keep on hand.

This was the very first loaf of bread I've ever made and it turned out fantastic! I've had homemade bread before that gets really crumbly and it's hard to do much with, but this has the perfect consistency. It was so easy to make that I may not even buy bread from the grocery store anymore!

Just as I remember my "Avo" making every week!  I used my very old breadmaker on manual and brushed the top with egg white; included the extra yolk into dough.  It rose, baked and tasted absolutely wonderful!  Family enjoyed it so much.  Will bake again and double the reciped.  Thanks Jennifer!

Absolutely fabulous. I have a 15 yr old breadmaker and this just barely fit. I was a little worried with 3 cups of flour but no mess.  Anyway back to the bread, I did go with 1/2 cup sugar based on others recommendations. Kids loved it, so did I. Went perfectly with our chicken dinner.  Thank you!

This was just ok to me.  It didn't wow or disgust me!  The only change I made was subbing veggie shortening for the margarine, as I had no margarine on hand.

This is the first bread I made in my bread machine, and it was a hit! The whole loaf was devoured in a day, and I've been getting requests for more of it. I increased the sugar to just shy of 1/2 cup, and it was perfect. Just sweet enough, and all you need is butter on it.

Excellent sweet bread. If you are watching your diet, use Benecol margerine (to lower cholesterol) and/or Splenda (0 calorie sugar substitute). You measure each of these ingredients the same as in the original recipe and the bread texture remains the same.  You have to be very careful when uncovering it after the last raise, but it's worth the effort to achieve the moist result.

I just got a bread machine 2 months ago and have made this 7 times. I have tried other recipes but keep coming back to this one. It is sweet, light, and the crust is good. This is by far our favorite.

excellent. i dont like baking in the machine because of the nonstick risk and because it wrecks the coating after a while (I'm on my third zoji pan now, others destroyed by bread crust scraping) so i also set on dough, then plopped into 8x8 glass dish, covered with towel, let rise 30 minutes, baked 20min @ 350deg. perfect.   was a hit at work and with self.   note: I replaced the 2tb marg with 2 fat tb of applesauce (no sugar added). came out awesome. used whole milk.   tonight will be making again in 15minutes, will also sub applesauce for marg but this time reduce sugar to 1/4 cup.

Great recipe. I have made this recipe as is, and thought the dough was too sticky.  I also like a little more sweetness.  Here's how I have adapted the recipe for us -- used 3 1/2 - 3 3/4 sifted bread flour, upped the sugar to 1/2 cup and upped the butter to 4 tablespoons.  I don't have a bread maker, so I proofed the yeast with the warmed milk for 10 minutes.  Add all the other ingredients and kneaded it by hand for about 7 minutes.  Put in a greased bowl, covered with a towel and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place.  Formed into rolls and let rise again for about an hour.  Baked at 400 for 15 minutes.  AWESOME!!!  I make these at least 2 or 3 times a month now.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

My girlfriend makes this recipe often.  She makes the dough in the breadmaker and bakes it in the oven. Mmmmm...

I yielded this recipe to 12 servings. This called for about 2 1/1 teaspoons of yeast which is equivalent to one packet of yeast (1/4 oz)...I used the Fleischmann's (the yellow packet kind). The recipe said this was going to be sticky but it was overly sticky in my opinion...so I added another cup of bread flour. To make the bread a little more rich and sweeter, I read the previous reviews and added another yolk and increased the sugar by doubling the amount (it called for 1/3 so I added 2/3 of sugar).   I didn't make this bread in a bread machine. Instead, I let the dough rise for two hours. Punched it down. Let the dough rise for another hour. Baked it in the oven for 40-45 minutes at 375*.  Turned out crispy on the outside and a little doughy in the middle...perfect :) Thanks again!

I don't have a bread machine, so I warm the milk and stir in the yeast and sugar and let it sit for 10 minutes.  Then i put everything in my mixing bowl and mix, then knead,rise for an hour, put in pans, then bake...still working on temp/time.  9x5 pan 30 min at 350 was perfect.  But larger pan was raw in center.  THE BEST

I've made this a million times. I love my bread machine but only the dough setting because I'm lazy lol I will say that this is a sticky dough and doesn't come together well in the mix stage unless you add a few sprinkles of flour atop it while it's going. I typically bake this as one loaf for 40 minutes at 350. It's pretty dense but my husband loves it :) Hearty and good with homemade preserves and fresh butter!

Put it in my bread machine on an 11-hour timer, and it over-flowed my bread machine half-way through baking. I finished it in the oven, but it fell to about half the volume it had risen to. It was still good.

Wow - this was great.  This is much fresher and denser than store bought.  I have never made bread before and it was so easy!  I took the advice to use 1/2 cup sugar and add the extra egg yolk.  I don't have a bread maker but the kitchen aid worked fine.

Got a better texture than the other bread recipies I've tried. The crust was beautiful and the taste good. Doesn't keep well. Might try this recipe again, but looking for more sandwich bread type recipes.

Great bread! I accidentally added 1/2 cup of sugar and it turned out PERFECT! I wouldn't recommend that for most bread machines though because it will cause it to rise over top of pan....yikes!.. I will be making this again and again.

I really like this recipe, the only thing that I change is I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour. So, 2 cups white, 1 cup whole wheat. That way I feel better about eating bread! haha

Absolutely delicious, light and sweet. I did not deviate from the recipe at all. I am very pleased because it tastes like grandma's rolls, but it is a loaf and it was so simple to make.  It was less than 5 minutes of prep time and I didn't need to scold the milk and wait for it to cool off.  I didn't even wait for the ingredients to get to room temperature. I just put them in the machine and let it do its thing.

 I have been using my grandma's recipe for sweet rolls made the old fashioned way for years, but I don't make them that often because it is too much work and time. I recently bought my first bread maker and this is the second loaf of bread that I have made in it. 

This recipe is a keeper. I will probably make this bread 3 or more times per week.

I used 1/2C sugar and only 1T margarine.  Recipe couldn't be any easier!  Made a high, sweet and chewy loaf.  Perfect accompaniment to dinner or for sandwiches.  We will definately have this more often.

WOW! Just what I was looking for...a sweet bread recipe with ingredients I already had in my cabinets. I used a little more sugar and used all-purpose flour (since it was all I had on hand) and it turned out wonderful! You don't even have to wait for the ingredients to reach room temperature--just dump them in and let it go. Super Easy. Just one problem...it was gone within minutes! The family loved it.

I thought this bread might now rise or turn out b/c during the knead cycle i looked in and saw that it was really sticky and thin - but by the 3rd rise cycle it rose all the way up and baked perfect - also the crust was light and not too thick like I have been getting with other recipes - so I'd say this is my new favorite (note: i used a bread flour mix instead of all-purpose or regular bread flour - my mix includes wheat bran, wheat germ, and potato flakes)

Awesome. Baked a loaf today and had BLTs with fresh tomatoes from the garden. Oh...how wonderful!!!!
I, too, baked mine in the oven like some at 350 for 25 minutes just 'cz I don't like the shape of the loaf from the bread machine. Didn't adjust anything.

This is a very tasty bread, reminiscent of ones from Hawaii. I now live far away from home so it's nice to be able to make my own fresh sweet bread without having to deal with the stale ones from the supermarket. I will definitely make this again!

The recipe called for active dry yeast and I debated whether I should use bread machine yeast. The active dry yeast worked fine and I was surprised how much the bread rose while baking. Don't meddle with a good recipe --- no wonder reviewers keep giving it 5 stars!

Wow! I made this exactly as written and had to make a second loaf immediately after the first one was tasted. What a delightful bread! So tender, tasty and just a little sweet. It does rise to the very top of the pan yielding a generous loaf of aromatic flavorful bread.

I've made this a few times on different bread machines.  It does rise too high on both machines.  On my machine it comes out really dark, even though I have the setting on 'sweet' and 'light' crust.  My crust turns out really hard, and the inside is really soft.  However, it does taste good.  I just can't bake it right!

YUM! I made this bread tonight for dinner and it turned out lovely! Slightly sweet with a soft center and perfect crust. I only made 1/2 of the recipe b/c my bread machine is small, and it still turned out wonderful. I served this bread with a homemade honeybutter and everyone loved it including my 16 month old son. Thanks for the great recipe. I am adding this one to my list of all-time favorites.

This bread is delicious!  It rises a lot, or at least it did in my machine--it pushed up against the lid as it was baking.  It is a very soft bread, so you won't be able to slice it very thin, but that's ok because it is so light.

I doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves for Thanksgiving dinner.  Don't have a bread machine.  I warmed the milk in a pan on the stove, dissolved the sugar and yeast in the warm milk and let it sit for 15 minutes while I combined all the dry ingredients in the bowl of my Kitchenaide.  After the yeast had foamed, I melted 4 tablespoons of butter into the milk mixture and then whisked in 2 eggs plus the yolk of another.  Slowly poured the liquid ingredients into the mixing bowl with the mixer set on med low.  Stopped and scraped down the bowl a few time and then let the mixer run on medium for about 5 minutes to knead the bread dough.  I preheated the oven to 170Â° then turned it off.  Oiled a large bowl, turned the dough out of the mixer bowl into the oiled bowl, rolled the dough around to coat completely, covered it with a damp towel and put it in warm oven to rise for 1 1/2 hours.  After rising, I removed dough from bowl onto a floured surface, kneaded for a couple of minutes, and divided it into 2 9X5 loaf pans, covered and let rise in oven for another 45 minutes.  Baked at 350Â° for about 35 minutes, till nicely golden brown and sounded hollow when I tapped the top of the loaf.  Cooled for a couple of minutes in pans, then removed loaves from pans and let finish cooling on a wire rack.  Some of the best bread I've ever made.  Nice crust with a soft interior and great flavor.  I always make the homemade bread for our family Thanksgiving, many there complemented me this year sa

Wonderful "New-World" way to make my great-great grandmother's "Old-World" bread!  Word of advice: to make it sweet you really should heat up the milk first.  Also, if your family is from Madeira Island like mine and you are used to this bread having Anise seed in it, I found that adding 1 tsp of crushed Anise seed was the perfect amount.   This saves me so much time- no more spending the ENTIRE day making Portuguese sweet bread! Thanks for the adaptation!

I have adapted this recipe because I do not have a bread machine but follow the recipe but make it by hand, and it turns out fabulous.  Also, bake in mini pie pans and makes a great bun for turkey sandwich!

I have made this bread several times, both in the bread machine and in the oven. When I have time, I prefer baking it in the oven as I can control the outcome of the crust easily. I followed one recommendation from a reviewer to add an extra egg yolk. The bread comes out a bit fluffier and less dense, which is how we like our bread. This is definitely a staple in our home. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Everyone in our family loves this bread!  My very picky teen daughter loves pricey Hawaiian sweet rolls and hates all other breads.  She happily uses slices of this bread for everything from deli sandwiches to chunks dipped in soup to grilled cheese to homemade pizza broiled in the oven.  It's her go to bread for all things these days.  I would rather she eat a wheat or whole grain bread but I will certainly allow her to use this bread in place of store bought bread with 25 ingredients.  I wondered about the temperature of the butter since it's not specified so I just use room temperature butter to ensure even distribution.  And yes I use butter, no margarine for this family.  It makes a large, perfectly sized loaf in my Oster bread maker.  Thank you for the delicious recipe!

I made this recipe 3 days ago and it has been the best recipe I have used so far. The taste is really good and everyone loved it. I did have the problem of it raising very high, it didn't overflow but touched the glass top panel and got stuck. It was all good though it made for a very large yummy loaf of bread. Thanks. Only thing I did different is activate the yeast in a little water before putting it all in the machine.

OMG I made this last night. I opted to put my bread machine on the dough cycle after I reading a few comments about it rising too much; I didn't want to take the risk. Plus, the bread machine loaf has an awkward shape to it that I don't fancy. The only thing I did was increase the sugar to 1/2 cup but honest the recipe is perfect as is. I am a bread-lover and this recipe totally brings me back to the way we make it in the islands. THANK YOU JENNIFER. This one is a keeper! I'm going to add cinnamon and raisins next time and make rolls. I'm so excited about this!

SO yummy! Turns out perfectly. I make my dough in the bread machine, but then bake it in the oven. I form it into a loaf, let rise for an hour, brush with egg, and then bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes. Probably the best bread I've made so far!

Fantastic! I am a potter and just made my first bread baking bowl, so I searched AR for a simple loaf to try.  Following the prior reviews I made this loaf in my kitchen aid then transferred to my bowl for both rises and baking (25min in preheated 350deg oven). This bread came out perfect and I will be making many more times!  Thanks for sharing.

I only added a tablespoon of honey to add an extra touch of sweetness to this recipe. I let the bread machine do it all, and it was delicious. Perfect for spreading with honey butter. The texture probably would've been even better if I'd taken it out of the bread machine and baked it in the oven--but I wanted to see how it turned out in the bread machine first. It was still excellent in the bread machine. Thanks for sharing.

I flavored this with orange extract, raisins, and cardamom. Delicious. It does raise a lot, so the top was a bit undercooked, but that's what toasters are for.

I made this recipe two days in a row... first time I accidentally omitted the butter/margarine... my family still asked to keep the left overs... it was amazingly good... My only suggestion is that I would use 3 1/4 cups of bread floor right from the start if I was not going to be available to add a bit of flour after I started the machine.  If you like sweet bread - this is the one for you.  Beautiful color, texture, and just a hit of sweetness.  I also use the low crust setting on most breads that I make.  Seems to not only make for a more tender crust but a moisture loaf of bread.  Thanks for sharing this recipe... who new!!!!

I LOVE this bread! I can't even begin to describe the flavor of it. Its so delicious. Everyone that I give it to raves about it. Such an easy recipe. I've made it several times. Sometimes I have to add extra flour depending on the weather and the brand of flour I'm using.

My Portuguese husband says it reminds him of his youth, torn up in a bowl and pour milk over for a breakfast or snack.

Absolutely delicious bread.  I made it in my bread machine using the sweet bread setting and it came out perfect.  I used fat free evaporated milk and once I substituted honey for the sugar but went back to using just sugar as my family preferred it.  It is remarkable toasted with butter and makes excellent french toast.

Turned out great even though my older bread machine stopped because of a tripped GFC after about 20 minutes into the cycle and I had to restart from the beginning. Subbed salted butter for the margarine but used same amount of salt as called for in the recipe. Used skim milk since that is what I had on hand.

Great bread machine recipe.Great texture,soft & yummy.The only thing that I would change would be to up the sugar to 1/2 cup.I may also experiment with taking the loaf out a few minutes early.Sweet breads tend to brown quickly in bread machines.Will certainly make again & again :)

I am clearing out my cookbook/recipe shelf, and want to add my notes...I can't remember how this tasted, but I made a note that it was too much dough for our bread machine (standard size).

I'm a bread newbie and made this wonderful bread the first time last night.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used fast rise yeast and baked on the quick cycle.  It was the best!  Beautiful, too!  I'm going to try my next loaf on the regular cycle but I can't imagine it being any better.  I think this is a bulletproof recipe.

I make exactly as written and always comes out wonderful.  My only recommendation would be to watch it towards the end, it sometimes overcooks a bit.

Yummy. I was afraid it would not be sweet enough so I took suggestions of adding 1 egg yolk and using 1/2 cup of suger and it came out amazing. I started it in the bread machine and I do not have a sweet bread setting so I just used the dough setting and once done I took out and put in a round cake pan since real Portuguese sweet bread is made that way. I was a bit nervous as it was quite sticky but I resisted the urge to throw in more flour and am glad I did not give in. I let it sit and rise for 30 more minutes and then baked at 350 for 25 minutes. It is just right in the middle. This is really good and easy for a home made version.

This taste really good, I accidently put in a 1/3 c. of margarine than the 2 tbsp that was asked for! It turned out fine, I didn't have a bread machine, so I did it the old fashioned way. I baked it at 400 for 16 minutes.

This bread was the first successful recipe I made in my bread maker.  It was ultra airy and had a touch of sweetness.  Tasted very similar to Hawaiian Sweet Bread (only not as sweet).  It didn't slice very well, just kind of ripped in the middle.  You would need extra thick slices (I'm talking 2+ inches or more) to prevent the bread from tearing.  I think this might've served better as rolls rather than a loaf.  I warmed my milk slightly in the microwave and melted the butter.  I added the salt to the liquids followed by the dry ingredients and finally the yeast.  I used all-purpose flour also.  I put the machine on the "light" and "basic" settings (not "sweet bread") but that was by accident.  The dough will look very wet...try to overcome the temptation to add more flour, it will be fine.  The crust was a bit crunchy, so next time I will make a conscious effort to use the "sweet bread" setting.  The bread is really good sliced while it is still warm and served with a good slathering of butter, heavy sprinkling of white sugar, and a few hearty dashes of cinnamon.  This bread is best the day it is baked.  Someday I will make this recipe and will set the machine to cease at the "dough" cycle and continue the process in the oven as sweet rolls.  GOOD STUFF!

I followed mommyfromseattles suggestions and did not use a bread machine. Even using all-purpose flour, the rolls came out great. Sweet enough to grill for breakfast but sturdy enough for sandwiches. These din't last long!

This is one of my favorite bread recipes on here.  I mixed everything in my Kitchen Aid and baked in the oven.  I didn't change a thing; this is perfect as is.  I should have taken a picture...the loaf was beautiful - like ones you see in a bakery.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - we'll be making this often!

Made as directed except I added a couple of tablespoons of honey. Did not warm any ingredients up and it turned out great. Was on the large side for my machine just barely grazing the top lid. Tastes just like the rolls from Bob Evans restaurants. Yum!

This bread is my new favorite! I added one extra egg yolk and it makes the bread even more delicious. You may need to add more flour. I added 1/2 cup extra.  It wasn't too sweet which I liked.

Not bad at all!  I'm used to sweet bread being lighter and fluffier, but I think it may have come out dense because it was my first time making it.  I don't own a breadmaker and followed MommyinSeattle's KitchenAid suggestions, added the extra sugar and egg white and finished with a light egg wash.  Delicious!

I have to be careful when I make this because invariably my wife will ask me to make three more loaves once the first is gone.  So unless you're really up for making this over and over and over again, don't start the cycle!  GREAT bread.  Very crumby though, I hold back a little on the yeast so it holds together a little better (2 tsp or less)

I, as many of the other reviewers, do not use a bread machine, I much prefer using a kitchen aid, bread pans and an oven.  Anyway... I added some cinnamon, nutmeg and a touch of ginger and used this to make French Toast, it was amazing!  This is a very easy bread to make, the dough is softer than I usually make, but I stuck to the reciep and am glad I did.

I am a huge bread fanatic and this bread just did nothing for me.  Normally I take bread out and eat half the loaf on the spot but i ate one piece and knew it wasn't what i was looking for.  To dense and sweet but not in a good way.  Ithink the Amish white bread recipe on here is much better.

I used MommyFromSeattles instructions because I too like the taste of oven baked over machine and this bread turned out wonderful!  So if you have any problem see what she suggested. My hubby and son raved how yummy it was.  We all agree never to buy store bought bread again.

I just baked this bread for my baby(even though he's still at work, it's a suprise for him) and it came out wonderful. The only adjustment I made was adding more flour. When the bread machine started to mix the dough seemed very moist and wet and was sticking to the sides so I just added about 3 tablespoons of flour. This bread came out perfect and you can eat it by itself or with butter. It's definitely something I'm gonna bake again.

I've made this at least 3 times (and probably a few times more). I've made it for us personally and for get togethers, everyone really loves it. Yes, it's tall and yes it falls a little at the top but people like the taste so much that they don't even notice (especially when sliced). I've had others ask for this recipe as well, I really like it and the ingredients aren't like your standard bread recipe. I make mine on the 1 1/2 pound size and I either do it as light white or medium white. Oh and I put the sugar just before the yeast at the end.

This bread was delicious. However, I did have a little problem with it... Because the bread was so large as one loaf, it got slightly overdone on top and bottom.  In other words, it tasted slightly burned in places.  Next time I think I might make 2 smaller loaves instead of one giant one... Maybe then I can freeze one, as the giant loaf is hard for a small family to eat before it goes bad.

Should have read the reviews first!  I have a 2 lb machine (4 c flour) so this should have had more than enough room.  It rose so much it lifted the lid. As a result baking was a little uneven.  Otherwise very good.  Nice crusty crust and good interior.  Unfortunately I stored it in a plastic bag and lost all that nice crustiness.  Still a good loaf.

Beautiful loaf of bread with a great texture.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for and won't change a thing next time I make it again.  Because I will definitely make this again.

EXCELLENT!  I made it a lower fat recipe by using skim milk.   At first inspection, I thought it was going to be to thin of a dough and considered adding more flour, but decided to resist the temptation  and just let it "do it's thing"...so glad I did! It had a nice high rise and was very fluffy.  It sliced beautifully and the taste was perfect.  Slightly sweet, but not overly sweet.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Just perfect! I used softened butter instead of margarine. 3 cups flour is 15oz for those who weigh their flour for baking purposes. Also I made sure to warm the milk to 100 degrees before adding it to the bread machine.

10 stars hands down!!  My family loved this bread, I made it for supper to go with a veg. soup from this site and it is all gone, this was so fluffy and soft the crust was perfect, not too crunchy,  tough or hard.  You have to try this, you wont be dissapointed.  ENJOY  I am making another loaf for morning toast, and or french toast.  YUMMY

Simple and easy, but one of our favorites so far. Yesterday, I made it a second time and added two tablespoons of honey. This seemed ideal. It couldn't have been a more perfect loaf and everyone loved it.

Mine didn't turn out so good, but I did change some of the ingredients.  I don't like to use oil, so I replaced it with melted margarine.  The bread was rubbery in texture and it was dry.  I will try it again and follow the recipe exactly next time and see what happens.  I've been looking for a simple bread recipe and I'm not giving up yet!

God bless the person who said to grill this bread with butter - it DOES taste just like a danish roll!!!!  This bread was easy and not too sweet (to me) but sweet enuf to have with my coffee this morning!  Next time, I may add some golden raisins.  I made it exactly (with the exception of adding 1 tsp of vanilla and butter instead of margerine).  This is my new morning-after-Christmas bread.

Nice flavour and texture.  It's a bit more rich than a regular white bread.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Only problem is that it went stale rather quickly; only solution is to eat it fast---shouldn't be a problem.

I grew up with this kind of bread, many hours in the making. This recipe is great, although my machine had it done in 2 hrs 30 min. I warmed the milk and margerine to 112 degrees and let the yeast grow for 10 min. Then I put in the rest of the ingredients and started the machinine. I am going to make dozens for Christmas gifts. My family will love it.

This bread had great texture, and my kids loved the taste. It had a nice flaky, crisp crust. I cut the recipe in half and didn't have any overflowing problems.  I gave it four stars because, like the other user this isn't like the other portugese bread that I have had:) But a great dinner bread!

Tried this recipe today. Simply  fantastic!! Would make excellant rolls.  I agree with other posts that in the bread machine you may want to put it on the light white setting.  On sweet bread setting the crust was very brown and a little hard.  Overall I can't wait to make it again.

Yum.  This was my first test with a bread machine- before I made my bread by hand.  It's so easy!  I don't have a sweetbread setting, so I used White bread, light crust.  The bread is light, fluffy, and with a tinge of sweet essence.  Recommended.

Mmmm! This bread was wonderful. My husband and I finished off about half a loaf right after it came out of the bread machine.  My only problem was that it over-flowed in my bread machine...I had to scrape the top of the maker since it rose so high and baked right on, the pan was also a pain to clean...but even with all that, taste wise this is a 5 star bread. I may try altering the recipe a bit to get a smaller loaf...

Thank you Jennifer!  This has become our favorite!   After slicing into lovely thick servings, I buttered, sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar and pan grilled till light brown.  Hmmmmm   However, this bread is just as delicious with nothing on it!

This recipe was very easy, and came out very tasty.  For my second batch I lowered the yeast to 2tsp, upped the sugar to 1/2 c, and added lemon extract and ginger. Delicious!

I made this recipe for 18 servings (1.5 times the ingredients) and I baked the loaves (2) in my pullman bread pans. They came out perfectly rectangular, with no dome and ready to be sliced. Once sliced, they look exactly like storebought slices, with no crust.
I cannot bake bread in any other pan, other than the pullman bread ones. The only catch is that they are very expensive here (I bought mine overseas, for 5 dollars a piece).

This is really yummy and so simple!  I absolutely love bread and sweets, so this combination is a winner in my book.  The bread did rise right to the very top of my bread maker and I was afraid it would finish its baking cycle uncooked in some parts, as the dough pushing to the small window of the bread maker didn't brown.  I was gladly proved wrong though, the bread baked perfectly and the crust was nicely crisp and brown (other than the top) and oh the texture!  Was absolutely soft and spongy.  The only negative thing I can say about this bread is that it does dry up rather quickly but toasting it eliminates that problem.  Great fresh, just as great toasted.

Maybe its the humid conditions here, but even on the light crust setting the crust of this bread comes out a little too hard/dark.  Other than that, it is really wonderful straight out of the maker with a little butter and guava jelly!!!

My family devoured this loaf.  Pushed the top off my old Regal Bread Machine and overflowed the pan, but it is delish!  Am making a second loaf today, cutting back to 3/4 cup milk and 2-1/4 cups high gluten flour...smells heavenly.   Hubby declared it the best out of the machine ever!   Thanks!

Comes out well in bread machine on sweet bread setting, but recipe difficult to make in smaller loaf size such as one pound. Name implies that this bread will be sweeter than it is. Probably will opt for another sweet white recipe, but it bakes up to a beautiful appearance, something which may have more to do with the quality of machine (Breville Custom Loaf).

I followed the instructions exactly. I've never had Portuguese bread and wasn't sure what to expect. The 2 pound loaf tasted like bread, with a hint of sweetness, and the texture was perfect. Next time I will experiment and make rolls. I'm a bread addict and this was a simple recipe to feed my addiction. I did toast a few pieces and buttered. It was delicious. In my mind, I thought it'd be sweeter and taste different which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.

I switched to butter a while ago because margarine is not good for me.  I have bread machine yeast and unbleached all purpose flour.
I just started the loaf.  I put all the ingredients in the bread machine and I am going to let it cook in there.
I haven't had Portuguese sweet bread in a long time. The family recipe has way too many eggs and I hated how long it took!
I'm excited for two things. First, I'm looking forward to the smell when it starts to bake! And second, I can't wait for a piece of warm bread with butter in 3.5 hours. 
I love the simplicity of the recipe.  When it's done, I'll come back and say how it came out.

It came out delicious.  Not quite Portuguese sweet bread but well worth it!  
Super soft, slightly sweet, and perfect bread machine recipe.  I'll be doing this again

Unfortunately, when making this I didn't have bread flour on hand (only AP). The bread still turned out well -- very soft and fluffy and just a little bit sweet.

This bread is wonderful!  my second time using this recipe, not nearly the last time.  Bread machine easy, only a few ingredients and it came out just as beautiful as the one pictured here.   I am giving it just a little time to cool before I slice into it, but i just pulled off what stuck to the mixing blade when I removed it from the bread machine.  It tastes as wonderful as it looks.  

i have been looking for a recipe for Portuguese muffins and have found a few but not locked down on one yet.  Next time I throw these ingredients into the bread machine I will hit the dough setting and make muffins with this.

This recipe makes fabulous, beautiful, slightly sweet rolls.  I used the dough cycle on the machine, then divided into 12 rolls and let rise again for about 35 minutes. Baked at 370 for about 16 minutes. They were the perfect dinner roll size, delicious and beautifully round. I'm betting this dough will make great sweet rolls, my next experiment. So excited to find this versatile recipe!

Very easy and super tasty. This was my first time making  bread and it came out wonderfully. I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and 1 1/2 tsp of rapid rise yeast instead of the suggested amount of regular active dry yeast. I couldn't take a picture  because it didn't last long enough.  It tastes very similar to Hawaiian rolls. Will definitely will make again.

I didn't use the sweet bread setting, but the 2 lb. button and light crust. It nearly took the lid off my machine! Wonderful, soft, just the right sweetness. My better half from Hawaii says it's nearly the " Kings Hawaiian" but not as sweet. Both of us find that too sweet. This is just right.

Turned out great.  Left in fridge for few hours to raise, then took out and made rolls with ham and cheese inside.  Put back in fridge to raise again overnight and took out next day for a couple of hours and then baked.  Delish

This was the best loaf of bread I've had in a long time. The texture was very nice and I did find the loaf to sweet. I would recommend to everyone to try it.

Great recipe.  Excellent ingredient proportions.   I combined all ingredients in KitchenAid mixer at one time.  Iâve been baking bread for decades and always proofed the yeast or created a sponge.  This is the first time I just added the yeast directly with the all the other ingredients . . . With excellent results.   After kneading in the mixer for 10 minutes, I leave it in the mixer bowl to rise.  When more than double in size, I turn the mixer on to punch it down.  So easy and no mess.  Yielded 2 medium loaves or 2 round pans of 8 rolls each.  I baked the bread at 350 for 30 minutes, the pan of rolls for 25 minutes. 

Increased sugar to 1/2 cup.  Used butter instead of margarine.  I added 1 cup raisins to the dough and sugar glazed the baked rolls.  Beautiful light texture.  Keeps well for 3+ days.  Freezes well.  Gave them away over the holidays.  Family and friends were all extremely complimentary.

I made this bread a couple days ago , everyone just loved it ! The flavor and texture is so perfect . I never bake the bread in my bread machine ( can't stand how it turns out ) however I do use it on the dough cycle for needing.  I make several loafs  of bread and rolls a week & this will be on rotation as well as a few other faves .

No changes, followed recipe exactly. This has become my go-to bread recipe. I make one loaf a week and whatever I have leftover by the end of the week is made into French toast on the weekend. I used my zojirushi virtuoso and had no problems with over rising

Update: swapped sugar for honey and itâs even better. Still my go to recipe!

This bread tastes exactly like Kingâs Hawaiâian Sweet bread.  I did as other reviewers suggested and just used the dough cycle on my bread machine and baked it in the oven.  Came out perfect.

I previously reviewed this and have made it several times now.  It tastes very good.  My problem is that it does not rise much and comes out of the machine very small.  My yeast (and other ingredients) are all good and I follow the recipe.  I do use buttermilk and a little extra sugar, but I do that with other recipes and they turn out fine.  Could it be the "Sweet Bread" setting itself?  Would this recipe work on the regular setting?  I still love the taste but would like the loaf to be larger.

This is amazing bread! I only use the breadmaker to mix the dough and raise it once. Then I cut into roll size pieces and stuff them with prosciutto & cheese, or ham and cheese (or any sandwich filling; with or without mustard... I go without since the bread is sweet enough). I pinch them shut and let raise again to get a puff. Then I bake them... they are gone before I get them off the baking sheet. I make a double batch and send my kids to school with them for lunches!!! They love it!

I have an old bread machine. This recipe doesn't work without over rising, full cycle. I choose the sweet dough cycle instead. After that I remove dough and divide into two loaf pans, let it rise for 30 minutes and then bake in a 350 oven til done. This is my go-to recipe. Friends can't wait til I bake and share the second loaf with them! The bread is sweet and airy. There's never enough left over for a breakfast casserole or French toast but I'm sure it would be delicious for both!

This recipe is right out of  The Bread Machine cookbook by Donna German that I have been using since it was published in 1991. It's a great recipe!!!! The original recipe calls for 2 eggs and I add an extra 1/2 cup of flour.

Amazing bread recipe, I own a bread machine but for this recipe I only use it to make the dough then I form into logs by hand and bake it in the oven. Be careful it will overflow in your bread machine for some reason so be sure and take it out after it's risen !

This is absolutely delicious. I cooked in the bread machine, and it turned out perfect. I heated the milk, added the milk, sugar and yeast in the bottom of the bread pan and allowed to sit (foam) for 10 minutes, then added egg and butter, topped with flour and made a well for the salt. My husband and kids are fighting over it. We think it's like homemade Hawaiian bread, which is one of our store-bought favorites. Especially delicious hot out of the bread machine with some salted butter. Excellent.

Wow!  This bread is pure perfection!!! Definitely try it. You will not regret it.  It's our favorite bread we have tried and we've tried a lot!!  I made it in my Zojirushi bread maker on light crust, quick rise.

Made it to the recipe, in the bread machine and the family devoured it. No surprise for those with a sweet tooth and bread lovers anyway!  I took it out a couple minutes early and shouldn't have...slightly doughy in the very middle so it didn't cut well.  But it didn't last long enough for it to matter that it wasn't sliced nicely! I thought it was okay when I tried a piece that broke off while cutting it, but slathering it in butter gave it a nice balance to the sweet and then I really liked it. I'm going to have to try it again and make some broiled cinnamon toast on it. Or French toast.  I'll be making this one a lot I think.

Wow, incredible!  I used half and half rather than milk because I needed to get it used.  Also warmed it up, along with the butter, before putting it in the bread machine.  I just made the dough in the machine and then made rolls from it.  I let them rise for 30 minutes and baked at 375 for 18 minutes.  I don't keep bread flour on hand, but all-purpose seemed to work fine.  This is seriously amazing bread!

I used the dough to make cinnamon rolls. They rose and baked beautifully!! I didn't bake it in the bread machine(I never do, I just use it for the mixing). I let it mix and then puled it out and let it rise on the counter.

This recipe is amazing!   I mixed all wet ingredients and salt before adding them to the machine.  Mix flour, sugar and yeast and then added.  Used the light crust and sweet bread settings.  Programmed my  machine to have it ready in the morning.  We all woke up to the sweet smell of fresh bread.  Thank you for sharing this jewel.

Over flowed and burnt in my bread machine on the "sweet bread" setting. ( My bread machine has a max bake setting of 4 2/3 cups of flour and I make bread recipes that use 3 cups of flour all the time). I didn't punch it down.

I took it out and scooped what I could in a bread pan because it was still doughy and cooked it in the oven at 375 until golden brown.
Was still good lol. It's a nice dense sweet bread.

If you're gonna be making this in a bread machine be careful.
Next time I make it I'll probably try to reduce the ingredients.

So after mixing, cover and let it sit in the bowl to rise 1-2 hours. Punch down and let rise again or form into rolls at this time. Super quick and easy. If you want a sweeter, richer bread, increase sugar to 1/2 cup and add one extra egg yolk. If making one large loaf, bake for about 30-35 min. at 375.
or  bake at 350 for 20min in an 8" round or make into pull apart rolls

I'm still trying to get the hang of my bread maker.  I've made this recipe twice.  First time I used the medium crust setting and it was too dark.  Next time I used the light setting and it didn't over rise and it was done nicely.  On the medium setting the bread puffed up way over the top of the pan, the light setting it didn't do it.  I have up to a 2 pound bread maker and I believe this is a 1.5 pound recipe so that is what I set it on.

This is a very nice bread.  I did use my bread machine to make it . Having read the reviews I scaled back the yeast 1/4 teaspoon.  (If I add 2 T and 1/4 teaspoon my bread always falls. Too much yeast. ) Minor adjustment to a good recipe. That said this  bread is very light.  Good texture, great for toast too. I think it rates 4.5 stars but they only give you whole stars to which to rate with.

Yes, I made it.  And made it.  And made it. And made it again.  This bread is absolutely delicious and it will replace my "go to" yeast rolls at my holiday table, it is that good.  I made it the first time in my bread machine.  I followed the recipe as written and I used the 1-1/5lb loaf size and the sweet bread setting.  The kneading/rising/baking cycle takes about 2:45.  This bread bakes up with a nice rise on the loaf and the crust has a nice light brown to it.  it is a "solid" bread, it has nice tiny airy pockets to it but it's a moist, dense bread.  It has a perfect sweetness to it and I can't keep it in the house long enough to get it on the table.  For holidays, I will use the dough cycle and section it into small balls to make rolls in the oven.  DELICIOUS, thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  This was DELICIOUS!!!!  I made the recipe exactly as is.  My Breadman bread machine does not have a sweet bread cycle, so I just set it to BASIC 1.5 LB and it came out perfect.  I did take it out about 5 minutes shy of the cycle completion as it looked like it was browning a little too much.   I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It tasted great but it didn't rise for me. I'm almost positive my yeast is alive since it is still new. I have a 2lb bread maker and it only filled about halfway. Is this recipe for a 1lb maker? It also was not very sweet at all! Makes great sandwich bread!

This is my family's favorite! Great just to eat or with sandwiches. It makes a nice big loaf in my Zojirushi. I use the Basic cycle because there isn't a Sweet Bread setting on my machine.

This bread came out AMAZING!!!! My kids, neighbors, and I all loved it! It has the perfect amount of sweetness to it, and it's so soft and fluffy. And the smell... fantastic! I think this will be our go-to bread from now on.

Changes I made: I read some reviews stating it overflowed in their bread machines, and since my machine only makes 1 Lb or 1-1/2 Lb loaves, I reduced the amount of yeast to 2-1/4 tsp (that was the maximum amount the recipes in my owner's manual called for, so I didn't want to exceed that). I also added closer to 1/2 C sugar, and added a splash of vanilla. I also brushed it with a mixture of melted butter and honey spread once I put it on a wire rack to cool. Thanks for the recipe!

was looking for something simple without 20 ingredients, and this fit the bill. I could not believe how this came out, it was perfect.I used buttermilk instead of milk, but that was the only exception.Better than the box mix, thank you.

Theres probably a trick to it. I guess punching it down. But this was my first time with this bread machine and Ididnt know it didnt do that. Bread rose waaaaaay too much and the top came out uncooked.
But the stuff that cooked was delicious!

Best bread I have ever made! My daughter said it tasted like the Hawaiian Sweet Rolls we buy at the store, which both my kids like - I am definitely substituting this bread for the store-bought, preservatives-added rolls.  It did overflow a bit, so I need to make a half-batch from now on, but it is so easy to make!  Can't wait to try out the Portuguese Sweet Bread II!!!

I don't have a bread maker, so I used my small oven. I also subbed soy milk and only 1/4th sugar. Surprisingly it wasn't too bad. I "baked" it for 1hr 30 on 160ish. However, I suggest much lower temp (140 maybe) for an hour. It's a bit crunchy on the edges but I think it'll make really good garlic bread. The taste is strangely addicting, even the burnt parts... Oh, I also let it rise for a few hours before baking it. Not sure if I should have done that.

Just delicious! I just discovered our bread machine; we've had it for years after it was given to us but had never used it. This was the first thing I made in it. How could something so easy be so delicious?? For those who claim it overflowed in the machine, it's made for a 1.5-pound loaf machine. I used 1% milk and it was perfect. Will probably use the light seeing on my machine next time, just because I don't like a dark crust.

Very good/easy recipe for a novice baker like me.  I did proof the yeast first (learned from reading all the user feedback), as I was using active dry and not bread machine yeast, and used the dough setting since the shape of the bread baked in my machine is too awkward for toasters.  This recipe turns out a fluffy sweet bread, we could barely keep ourselves from gobbling up the warm bread out of the oven.

Made this 3 times in 24 hours! Used all bread flour, and half bread/half ap... the last batch was a bit late, so I put it in the fridge for a slow rise... I think it came out even better - softer and more moist! My new go-to recipe for my kids!

I love making bread in my bread machine, and this bread came out just about as perfect as a bread machine loaf can get. I followed the instructions exactly as printed using the 1.5 pound loaf setting because the directions didn't specify, and typically breads using three cups of flour are 1.5 pounds. It filled the entire bread pan without overflowing. My whole family LOVED it, thought it was the best loaf they ever tasted.

This bread is awesome.  It's got a rustic texture and tastes a bit like Golden Coral's rolls.  I'm making on the average two loaves a week.  Slice it thick, put it in the toaster and put a little butter on it...awesome!

Was suprised how good this is!  Made this to give to a friend.  She loved it!!! Added approx 1/4 cup more sugar and 1/3 cup flour (my bread machine always seems to need more flour than called for for a good dough ball).  This is fantastic toasted.  Am making it for the 3rd time, wonderful toasted and with strawberry preserves.

Best tasting and easiest recipe ever! I made thousands of other recipes and none match up to this one. Know it by heart, and make it at least once a week for my family. Fantastic as French toast grilled cheese and even croutons. My kids love it.

This was the most amazing sweet bread ever!  I used a WestBend two pound bread maker and it turned out perfect!  Instead of using the active dry yeast and used 1 1/2 teaspoons of bread machine yeast (the standard for most sweet breads this size) and it worked just fine.  Will definitely be making this again soon!

Due to dietary issues, I make all my own bread.  I was looking for something similar to Hawaiian bread to make ham and cheese sandwiches for my family's lunches.  This turned out very well.  It had the sweet taste of the Hawaaian bread, but a slightly denser texture like a soft french bread.  Was delicious and will definitely make again. I did want to add the only change I made was to substitute unsweetened vanilla almond milk (which is all I keep on hand) for the milk in the recipe.  Turned out VERY well in my 1 1/2 lb bread machine.

I absolutely love thus bread! When my machine beeped I added a handful of diced candied  fruit (like that used in fruit cakes) and it was like Panettone bread! I also substituted 2tbso olive oil instead of margarine...I'd use butter, but we never use margarine in our home.

This recipe made a delicious & finely textured loaf that had just a hint of sweetness.  Excellent for french toast, sandwiches and, of course, fresh and warm w/ butter.

makes a great sweet bread. I like it as day old bread cut into thick slices to be dipped in liquid egg substitute mixed with some whole milk and vanilla extract for French toast--then slather on some lo-cal margarine and sugar free syrup.  reasonably non-fattening this way but still get diner type French toast with some natural sugar in the bread recipe for that extra satisfying sugar rush without over-doing the calories.  can add a little ground flax seed meal, wheat germ, and a little oatbran.  i usually substitute 1 c whole wheat flour with 1 tbsp vital wheat gluten instead of all 3 cups bread flour.

This was delicious!  My husband loved it! He said that its his favorite bread I've made so far in our bread machine.

UPDATE: To date, this is the only bread my husband wants me to make now.  We both LOVE it soooooo much!  It reminds me of little sweet rolls that one of my aunts used to make.

After followinig a reviewers instructions on how to make this bread without a bread machine (I don't have one) I turned out beautiful "store bought" looking loaves.  My stepson served his church mission in Portugal and LOVED this bread!  Thank You so much!

I made these tonight in the bread machine on the dough cycle. Then I made them into rolls and they were great. My family loved this recipe. This is a keeper. Thank you.

What a wonderful bread recipe! It has the perfect amount of sweetness and is great for breakfast. I make this regularly for my family and it never lasts long. I have actually found that this does better in my bread machine than in the oven. Every time I try to cook in the oven it ends up with a dark crust but still not done in the middle.

Excellent recipe. My kids love the hawaiian  bread from the grocery store, but it contains high fructose corn syrup. This is a great and cost effective alternative. Thanks for the recipe.

I put this in the bread machine on the dough cycle, then made it into 12 dinner rolls, baking at 375 in a greased 13x9 baking pan for 14 minutes.  They turned out so perfectly, you'd think I'd bought them at a bakery.  They melt in your mouth and don't even need butter.  The taste and texture remind me of Hawaiian bread.

Awesome! Made the dough in the bread machine and let it rise in a bowl that I placed in a warm oven. Punched down and let it rise again. Punched down and made nice rolls (let rise a 3rd time but next time I'll only do 2 rises)!!  I'm on my 3rd roll now!  ADDITIONAL ADD: 1/4 cup of loosely packed light brown sugar (and the white as stated in the recipe) and 1 T flaked potato (instant). Gave it a slightly denser inside but hubby LOVED it!  Hearty, great taste...this is a keeper!

We're huge fans of King's Hawaiian Sweet Bread Rolls and the whole family absolutely loved the bread!  I didn't change anything, followed the recipe.  Only four stars because one little part of the top on one end came out slightly doughy.  Going to try making it again in just a few minutes but using the Splenda-sugar blend.

This bread is wonderful....the best bread I have ever made in a bread machine.  Goes well with any meal and has a good texture for making toast (it doesn't smoosh down when cutting or crumble all apart).  My boyfriend from eastern Europe even likes it and he only likes his mom's bread :)

I let the bread machine mix the dough and then oven bake it. When through this is wonderful! It has great texture and is very flavorful. My family likes it best toasted with butter and homemade jelly.

This is one of my favorite bread machine recipes (although I am a new bread machine user). It's easy and delicious, and makes a really tall loaf (thank you to SANDRALYOUNGER for the tip on using an oven bag to store it!) I changed nothing and love it. Makes delicious french toast.

I guess I expected this to be a little sweeter?  I made as a "dessert bread", but would serve better as bread with dinner..tasty though! just wasn't what I was expecting from a "sweet bread" recipe.

This isn't your grand-ma' sweet bread because it won't give you heartburn...But it's great! I am sure if you want the EXTRA calories you could add an egg and double the butter...but I like it just fine. Mine tends to be bit well cooked but the bread machine is NEW and I'm sure that's my fault. I love my sweet bread med-rare...lol! Thanks for the recipe!!

I used an extra egg yolk and 1/2 c sugar per previous reviewers.  I let it cook in my 2lb bread machine with no problems.  It didn't rise right out of the machine like some have said.

Fabulous recipe!  I just dumped everything in my bread machine, put it on the dough cycle, popped it in the oven on 350 for 25 minutes and it was done!  It's so much better if you bake it in the oven, the crust is much softer.  Yum!

Very good but not quite what I had expected.  I have always had Portuguese Sweet Bread that had a flaky texture.  This was more of a bread consistency.  It was very good and tastes great toasted with butter!

This is the best bread machine recipe I have ever made! It has a super-light texture and is so satisfying. The fam wolfed this one down.

I have a 2 /2.5 lb loaf machine, so overflow wasn't a problem. I baked it as a 2 lb loaf and it was perfect! Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Gotta say, not really that great.  My Mom was never much of a baker so all her Portuguese friends would make her mossa because they knew she didn't.  Everyone had a different mossa but they were all pretty good.  This one is too dry and crumbly.  The top crust is usually thicker and chewy (my favorite party)which this one lacked.

I did mix it in my kitchenaid mixer and bake it in the over with an egg wash on it so maybe that had something to do with the poor outcome but I've done that a bunch of times and it always turns out great.

Wow... This was honestly some of the best bread I have ever eaten!  Perfect taste and just the right amount of sweetness.  It rose a little too high - ...but I will definitely be making this again - maybe into 2 smaller loaves.  I used the dough setting on my bread machine and then baked it in the oven...@ 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  I was so glad I did - because I would have had a huge mess in the bread machine after seeing how high the dough actually rose!!!

Deeelish!! You don't need a bread machine.  I do mine by hand as you would any standard loaf of bread.  My Bf's favorite.  if I go a week or two without making it he asks for it.  When the bread starts to get a bit dry it makes great french toast.

While it tastes wonderful, I don't think this recipe as written is good for a bread machine.  Many reviewers have noted that it rose out of the pan, and it did the same to me.  I caught it before it was too bad to clean out of the machine and put the dough in a normal loaf pan to bake in the oven, but I won't be endangering my bread machine again.

I have made this recipe about 6 or 7 times now.  And every time - the loaf doesn't even get to cool before my family eats the whole thing.  Great Flavor - easy prep.

Delicious! I don't have a bread machine so I used the suggestions in the reviews for making it without and turned out great. My family loved it and it was easy to make.

This seems like a no-fail bread. I made a loaf without the bread machine, 30 mins at 350. It's very good. We had it with a salty dinner, smoked pork chops. Perfect!

This was my first loaf of home made bread ever.  I don't even own a bread machine.  I did get a kitchenaid stand mixer for Christmas.  The bread was excellent.  It taste so good.  Thanks for sharing.  It is also easy to follow.

This bread was good, but boy did it make a mess in my bread machine.  It just grew and grew and grew.  I have never had one rise so much.  My daughter loved it.  Not sure that I would make again because of the mess.

This recipe was sooo delicious! I made it in the bread machine with the dough cycle, then put in a loaf pan and let rise 30 more minutes. Next I baked it in the oven on 350 for 30 minutes.  It was so perfect, much better than letting it cook in the bread machine. The bread was sweet but not overly sweet. The texture was wonderful too!  I'm very happy with the recipe.

This bread was very good.  I rate it four stars only because I was looking for a bread with a sweeter bite to it.  As for as white bread goes, it was excellent and will make again.

I'd give this more stars if I could. This is hands down the best bread I've ever made. Or tasted. I've made this twice now. My first batch was very heavy, dense bread but still very, very tasty. I had added a bit of honey to the dough. My second batch was followed to the recipe's T and was perfection. I made the dough in the machine, then pulled it out and place it on a cookie sheet. I gave me a very pretty, high loaf. Great recipe.

This was the first recipe I tried out in my bread machine.  I added about a cup of fresh chopped cherries in with the liquids.  It was excellent.  Will continue to use this as a base recipe for my sweet breads.

This bread was great, and everyone in the family said it was the best bread I've made yet with our new bread machine. I can't give it 5 stars, though, because it did rise up too much. Luckily, I had read the other reviews and was watching out for this, and I sort of punched it down (so the top didn't look so nice). But it was very tasty, and I'll be making it again.

I just took this out of the bread machine... it turned out GREAT!  I followed the directions/ingredients exactly. Very delicious subtle sweetness.  I will be making this again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Although this bread rises right to the top of my bread machine, it gets cooked right through everytime.  Tastes so amazing!  So light and fluffy.  Everyone loves this one.

THis was only my second loaf of bread that I made in my new bread machine.  
WOW!  It was beautiful!  I used the lighter setting because of the review I read.  It was wonderful.  Smelled great too.  I follow the recipe almost exactly, except added a touch of vanilla, and baked on light, white setting.

I made by hand instead of in a bread machine, and it turned out pretty well. I imagine it works even better in the machine!

Great recipe.  I had a couple of problems with kneading, but later found out that my bread machine finally decided to "retire" without notice.  I've made this again and again with my KitchenAid mixer and it was wonderful.

Delicious and easy to make.  My bread maker may be old, either that or I accidentally used all purpose flour rather than bread machine flour and it hit the top of the bread maker.  I will absolutely make this again, making sure that I use the right flour.

I've made this bread dozens of times...baked in my bread machine or just made the dough to make dinner rolls or a nice baked loaf in the oven. I like it sweeter so I increase sugar to 1/2 cup. If baking in bread machine, set to 'light' loaf as it comes out really dark at regular setting.

Delicious Sweet Bread! A compliment to any meal or sandwhich.  Easy directions, perfect in my Black n' Decker bread maker.  I was a little worried at first it wouldn't rise enough, in the end i was pleasently surprised. I'll make this over and over......
