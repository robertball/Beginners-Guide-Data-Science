The first time I made this I told the kids we were having something special for dinner.  Now they are always asking "can we have 'something special' for dinner".  They love it.  I make two loaves, one for them with the things they like and one for me and the hubby.  The cresent rolls were took a lot to prepare, so I used the Pilsbury pizza crust the second time around.  They all like it better.  Less soggy they said.

Maybe a bias rating, but I must say this one is great. The kids LOVE to help make their own pizzas, and if they make it, they will eat it! I can sneak in some spinach in the meat and I add some chopped tomaotes to the pizza sauce. But this is a great one to be able to 'hide' some veggies in!

I can tell this is going to be a great recipe! It's raining crazy here on this lazy Saturday and I happen to have crescent rolls, marinara (my own) and all kinds of shredded cheeses. We'll leave off the sausage, maybe toss on some olives and other colorful veggies.  My 4 children are going to have a blast decorating their own dinners! Thanks for the idea!

Was a great idea that i need someone to spell out for me. I used premade pizza dough instead of croissant for better texture. The kids had a blast. Not the best tasting, but the kids loved it, so who cares.

Sorry, but this did not work for us at all.  I thought by the reviews that it would be good for the kids, but the refrigerated dough was too thin for our liking.  I don't like giving bad reviews but this was turned down by our family

It wasnt my favorite. Simple and easy. I made mine a little more grown up by adding onions, green and red peppers. Left my husbands the same as the recipe since he eats like a kid. I also used spaghetti sauce since I didnt have any pizza sauce. When I cooked the sausage I added garlic and italian seasoning. I also drained the meat. I cook for 11 minutes but the dough was not done so I continued to cook it for about 18 minutes and checked on it a few times. It still was a bit soggy on the bottom but I think that could be remedied  with a few more minutes in the oven

EZ Pizza for Kids Haiku: "I'd say not easy. Rather just use pizza crust. Crescent dough a 'b.'" The filling/pizza "guts" tasted great and if we make this again, we'll use that, only spreading it onto prepared dough or crust b/c the rolling and pinching of the crescent roll and folding it over was not a kid-friendly task; in fact, it was irritating for me to do as well. I guess the bonus of folding the dough over (IF you don't let you kid(s) help) is that you could hide additional veggies inside, but I'd rather my kids know what they're eating, and enjoy trying new veggies w/o being subjected to sneaky-hidey-ha-ha. But again, I'll add that the sauce/sausage innards were tasty.

This was written by Maddie Wegmann. She is 8 years old and made this recipe for a tutoring session. "It tastes ok.I like it because I like cheese.I don't like it because I don't like rolls. I think it would be better if it had pizza bread on it. I would make it again??

This review was written by Michael Wegmann. He is 8 years old and Maddie's twin!  " It was good. It was good because it had cheese on it. It was bad because I don't like hamburgers. I will make it again.
