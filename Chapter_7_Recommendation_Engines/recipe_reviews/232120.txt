I thought these were delicious & creative!  I think I will make a few alterations next time.  First, I thought i had pressed the biscuit dough thin in the muffin pan, but there was a lot of biscuit at the bottom.  Next time, I will press the biscuits even flatter, reaching further above the mufin pan.  That will allow for more goo inside.  :-)   I also thought the mixture was a little too salty.  I might cut back on the garlic salt a little next time.  The flavor was good, but just too salty for my taste.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken and it worked great,

Looking for something quick to whip up for dinner, I gave this pot pie a try.  I had chicken already cooked and froze, so that help cut my cooking time.  I did lightly sauté half a yellow onion and one stalk of celery because I like the crunch it adds to a pot pie.  I also made my own cream of soup rather than use the canned version.  I had 2 packages of biscuits, so I got 20 little pies.  My husband loved them and proceeded to eat 6 of them for dinner.  Mine were done at the 12 minute mark.  I completely cooled, then individually wrapped the leftovers and froze them.  I will reheat in the toaster oven when I go to finish them up.  I would make these again and I think kids would really enjoy the individual servings.  Easy to add ingredients to your liking.

I readily admit my review may be a bit skewed because I was SO hungry when I made these. That being said, they did come together in no time (I used cream of mushroom soup in place of cream of chicken and the entire 12oz bag of frozen mixed veggies) using previously grilled chicken.  These took 19 minutes for me, and they should have stayed in longer, but I couldn't wait to eat any longer.  These were pretty good.  Not something I'd crave or purposefully make for the two of us, but would recommend for a quick weeknight meal.  However, it was really salty, and I love salt, so I'd recommend reducing the garlic salt to 1/2 tsp.  THANKS for the recipe!

I really loved this recipe. I made it with Campbell's condensed broccoli cheese soup and omitted the additional cheese in the recipe. Using broccoli cheese soup gave it a fantastic flavor that went well with the vegetables. I seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, and no salt seasoning from Costco. I added no additional salt.
These would be great to use with a variety of meats. Or to make vegetarian, you could add tofu.
These were easy, fast, and cheap to make. I will definitely be making them again soon. My husband liked them so much he said he would be happy to eat them every week.

This recipe was great! I totally omitted the garlic salt and have even left out the onion powder by mistake. There was still great flavor.  I like to steam my own carrots and potatoes and add thawed petite peas and corn from the freezer.
This recipes is so yummy, I double the recipe as I have 2 grown boys and a husband who usually finish them all up.

This is a super cute and easy recipe!  Like almost everyone else,I did have some minor adjustments.  I was worried about the doughy result given a full biscuit for each pie, so I used crescent dough instead which gave me a lot more room for the yummy chicken goodness.  I actually ran out of filling, so ended up with only 10 pies.  For the filling I thought it was salty as well, so I just added the onion powder and garlic powder (not salt) with some crushed pepper.  Fresh veggies on hand instead of frozen worked great.  I did not like all the cheese calories and fat, so I just sprinkled cheese on top and my son lovesFrench's crunchy onions, so I added that on some without the cheese to see if they liked that better.  It was about the same.

They're so easy I kept feeling like I must have done something wrong until I tried them, and they were great! Easy, cheap and my husband is obsessed with them!...I cooked the chicken in a skillet so I could season it more, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Big hit at my house.. I made my crust from scratch with a cream cheese dough. Best part is these freeze beautifully and make what I call the perfect busy night cheater meal.

My husband and I thought these were great! After reading the comments I cut back on the amount of garlic salt and onion powder only adding a few shakes of each (I didn't measure) The chicken works best in very small pieces. I boiled mine in chicken broth. I also used Grands Homestyle biscuits and to keep them from getting too bready I only used about 3/4th of a biscuit each. Definitely going to make these again.

I adjusted the spices and added onion and mushrooms. I cooked/heated all the ingredients before placing them into the biscuit cups. Please next time I'd rather just bake the biscuits separate and pour this over like a gravy. Either way it was really good.

I thought this was good, but not quite 5 stars in comparison to other dishes I've made from this site.  It seemed to need a little something more for flavor.  One reviewer put sauteed onions in it, and I think that would be good, or an alternate soup, as someone suggested.  Based on comments in some of the reviews, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and the salt balance seemed fine.  I also took someone's suggestion and flattened out the biscuit dough as much as I could, but there still was a lot in the bottom.  I think next time I will use a rolling pin to get it very thin. I think the servings listed should be changed.  Anyone who is really hungry would want at least two of these, maybe three.  The most frustrating thing about this recipe is that I could not find some of the ingredients in the sizes listed.  Soup cans were either 10.5 ounces or around 26 ounces.  The ones that were closer in size were not condensed soup.  The Pillsbury 10-oz. packages that I found had only 8 biscuits in them, so two packages would not make 12 muffin cups.

These were really tasty. I used condensed cream of celery soup as that's what I had but then added milk to make up for the difference in size and liquid. I used leftover chicken cut into tiny pieces (to hide from kids eyes lol) and probably about 2 cups of still frozen veggie mix. I also only used garlic powder not garlic salt, although next time I might add a bit more salt to the mix as well. My biscuits were sold in a 7.5oz pkg and had 10 biscuits in each can so I used 18 of the 20 biscuits and barely had enough filling for the 18th. I rolled each biscuit as thin as possible and then ended up using my fingers to try to mold it more into the cup. It's a bit hard because of the greased muffin tin, the dough wants to keep sliding down, but alas I got it where I was pretty satisfied. I did prebake the biscuits for about 3-5 mins first (while oven was preheating) and then scooped mixture in using large cookie scooper. I thought I'd made a mistake prebaking the biscuits but turns out I didn't and they were perfect. Not doughy at all inside. These also kept really well while I transported them to my moms house.  Husband and kids really liked them. Extended family also enjoyed but didn't want the leftovers. Overall really easy and good but a bit time consuming flattening the biscuits.

Oh My!  Just made these.  Was going to eat 2 but ate 3.
I'm into "container" cooking - smaller servings in food  servers - like baked eggs in avocado halves.  Anyway, like others, I wanted less biscuit and used cresent rolls.  Since there were 8 rolls in the can, I filled each to the brim to  use up the chicken filling and it worked fine.  Next time, think I'll omit the cheese in the filling and sprinkle some on top.  Still tasted a bit salty and I omitted garlic salt and used chopped garlic.  Sprinkled a little thyme on top to garnish.
Will definitely make again and play with them.  They are fun!

Pot Pie Cupcakes Haiku: "Forgot to review! Made these awhile ago, but we liked alot!" From what I can recall when we made these, they were fantastic, but too salty, super-cute to eat, but according to my husband "too biscuit-ey". I agreed w/ him in as much as I would've preferred mouthfuls of more vegg/chick than biscuit. But just like meatloaf "cupcakes", they really are fun to make and serve, especially when you have young children.

My husband and I thought this was delicious.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken soup because that is what I had on hand. I also omitted the garlic salt and onion powder.  I just added a pinch of garlic powder.  This was super easy to make and I will for sure make this again.

I made exactly as written. My picky husband, who doesn't like pot pies, ate 3 of them. I thought they were easy and tasty. Reheated in the microwave they left a little to be desired but would probably be good reheated in an oven.  I was surprised that my grandsons wouldn't take even a bite. Maybe next time I will let them help me make them. Then they might try more than a nibble.

My 10 year old son and I made this. I made some adjustments. I soaked my chicken in buttermilk and seasonings. I used garlic instead of garlic salt.  Then, we sautéed the chicken in a pan and put all the lovely drippings in the bowl with all the ingredients. Talk about yummy! My son ate 4 of them! Will be sharing and making again.

I covered the top wrapping the pot pie in the biscuit. It was great when it was finally done but needed to be covered with foil to not over brown the crowns while the centers were baking.

My husband and I really liked this one. We used green onions instead of onion powder and oh what a great flavor. Forgot to mix in the cheese so just put a little on top in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Just fabulous will definitely be making this again

Loved this whenever I make it. Put the mini-pies in a plastic bag in the refrigerator and used them for lunches for a week.  I live alone and this, with a salad, is the answer to lunches.

An all-time favorite.

Great. Halved the biscuits, good dough-to-filling ratio this way. Used regular sized muffin pan. Did not add salt as condensed soup has a lot. Added extra onion powder and added a salt-free seasoning blend. Kids and adults liked it. Easy and quick prep. Very filling. Will make again.

I had been wanting to try this recipe for awhile now and since I'm having a get-together tomorrow (about 10 people) I thought this would be perfect. My trial run turned out really good, in spite of the fact that I misread the directions and cooked it too long. The edges and bottom were overdone, but we ate them for dinner and enjoyed every bite. I'll be making these for my shindig tomorrow and I'm sure they'll be a great hit!

Delicious. I used extra large cup muffin pan so pies were larger. Used minced garlic instead of garlic salt & dried minced onions instead of powder. Used rotisserie chicken that I diced in small pieces. Instead of biscuits I used crescent rolls for thinner crusts. They did need to bake a little longer. Froze leftovers to take for lunch. Will make these again.

Very delicious & versatile recipe! We added fresh carrots for a little crunch. Peas, carrots, corn, green beans plus the chicken. The trick is to use croissant dough instead of biscuit. Wowza!

Used cream of mushroom, which had a too strong flavor.

What a great leftover dish! Made this for MNF for the crew with leftover smoked turkey from Thanks giving. A total hit! I left out the salt, added black and cayenne pepper, a smash hit!

I added WAY more spices and just used canned peas and canned corn. Lots more chicken and ham.

I sprinkled cheese the last five minutes of cooking.  These freeze great, and wonderful little bites for any party.

I will make this one again!

This was a big hit. I had Cream of Broccoli soup on hand, and had the remains of a bbq chicken rather than poached. Used garlic powder rather than salt, and they were perfect.

I forgot to add the cheese (argh!) so I sprinkled some on top. 
I pretty much followed the recipe - tweaked seasonings to taste - everyone  loved them!!! 

Easy recipe. Can easily substitute fillings for a change - keeping the cupcake idea. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe!!
