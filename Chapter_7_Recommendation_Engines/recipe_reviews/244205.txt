Absolutely perfect for summertime grilling. This easy to make 5 star recipe was a hit here during a BBQ without heating up the kitchen. The only change I would make is to double up on the bacon.

Holy cow, this potato salad is fantastic! I made as directed, but used bite-size red potatoes that I baked on a cookie sheet for 20 minutes at 400F. I then cut each in half and put them with the rest of the salad after they cooled off a bit. A huge hit that will be made again.

So delicious!! Used a little less olive oil and salt due to the bacon. Grilling the potatoes will be my go to for any potato dish.

I expected to like this after reading reviews, and the fact that we love most salads with oil/vinegar based dressings. We did not care for the flavor of this at all.

Yum!!! This is fantastic! I think we will decrease the oil and increase the vinegar next time...we just wanted it to have a bit more tang. We think it would be great as a breakfast food too.

I really like this grilled potato salad, it is flavorful and easy to add , additional items too. I have made it with basil infused olive oil and was very good ! (however only use 2 teaspoons of the infused oil, the rest regular olive oil)  I will make this again !

Excellent.  Learned it's very important not to dress salad until ready to eat.  I dressed it a bit early and it was much better initially than it was after it sat.  That's because potatoes absorbed the dressing which muted the flavor.

I made this to go with grilled sausages. It was excellent and I had compliments all round. I used thick cut double smoked bacon and white potatoes because I couldn't get red. I will cut back on the quantity of oil next time.  I will be making this again and again and...

Fantastic recipe. We smashed the garlic cloves (2) and then removed them before combining. Loved this recipe.

I made this recipe as we had space on the grill, and anything over 15 minutes is FAR too long for the cooking time, at least on our grill. After just over 15 minutes the potatoes were tender soft, and after 10 minutes resting, they were more like mashed potatoes than tender chunks. All that said, the flavor was very good. I'll do this again, just greatly reduce the grilling time on the potatoes.

It was a hit on Memorial Day.  I used  3 lb. of potatoes and tried to adjust the recipe accordingly, but the salad turned out a bit on the oily side.  Still came out great even though I charred some of the potatoes by accident.  Will make it again.

I thought this looked good but I donâ€™t have a grill so I cooked the potatoes and bacon in the microwave and followed the dressing exactly.  It was very good and I will make it again.

I'll be making this again.   Followed recipe except I didn't have a grill available.   Nice dressing and ingredients.  Love it hot or cold.  Tasty option without mayo.   Easy prep.

This was excellent!  My only regret was I doubled the bacon based on suggestions I read in other reviews, and it turned out to be a bit too salty for us.  Will leave the recipe exactly as is next time.

Wow, these are delicious and easy to make. Even our finicky brother who hates everything was raving about these. I used balsamic vinegar instead of the apple cider vinegar. We'll be making these  lots more in the future.

A hit with the family. I added extra bacon and a little fresh tarragon. I ended up splashing on some extra vinegar just before serving. Very good!

Delicious and quick!  Added more bacon in response to other reviews, otherwise made as directed.   You may need a little more dressing.  No reflection on the recipe,  potatoes vary.

I roasted the potatos in the oven as one reader suggested and it worked fine. I would have  given this 5 stars but I thought the olive oil flavor was quite strong.

I made this, as written, except for the parsley. I didn't have any. This was delicious, as written, and was a big hit with the whole family. I've been looking for a potato salad recipe w/o the mayo and have now found my go to recipe. May tweak a little but great original recipe!

This is an awesome recipe for those of us who really don't like regular potato salad. I have made this many times.

Maybe grilled  potatoes too long, but interesting taste. I made a mayo dressing, just prefer. Cut with apple cider vinegar and sweet chopped pickles with juice. Used REAL jar bacon bits. Would try it again.

My whole family liked it. I was hesitant because of the sugar, but it was perfect. Not sure I even tasted the sugar. And I'm not exactly sure how much bacon I used because I cut a one pound package in half and cooked it up. It seemed to be the perfect amount.

My friend doesn't like mayo so thought I would try this!  What a hit!  I increased the garlic to 4 cloves, used avocado jalapeno oil, and baked in the oven.  Very delicious!
