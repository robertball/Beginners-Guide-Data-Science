Mindful of hubs' sensitive innards, I left out the cayenne but this sure wasn't short on flavor! I added salt, used less cilantro (we're just beginning to like this stuff and didn't want to push it!) and more fresh, red-ripe tomatoes and simmered it a little longer than directed to really meld and bring out the flavors in that wonderful sauce. Just delicious!

This was a great dish, but I wish I had let it simmer longer. If I made it again, I might even let it sit in the crock pot for a few hours on low. It was great over rice, spicy but the perfect amount. I also used it as a filling in burritoes with cheese.

This was a great flavorful recipe.  I took the other reviews advice and let it simmer longer.  I served it over rice the first night, and used the rice/leftovers + cheese for vegetarian burritos the second night.  When I make this again I will use two cans of black beans.

I made these for dinner and it was delish!  I made one slight alteration, I added 3/4 cup of coconut milk which acts as an anti-flatulence, especially with gas causing beans.  Will be making this again.

Great recipe. Just the right amount of spice and easy to make. I used a pound of dried beans instead of canned. Just put them in the slow cooker with about 5 cups of water for a few hours before adding the rest of the ingredients. It takes about 8 hours this way. Left out the cilantro because my hubby won't allow it, but I think it would be a wonderful addition if you don't have picky eaters in the house. Added a splash of vinegar toward the end to fix the lack of umph. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!

This was SO GOOD and super easy. It was just spicy enough. I followed other reviews and let it simmer a while longer. My husband used the leftovers for burritos the next day. We will make this again for sure.

I loved this recipe! I was skeptical at first, assuming it was going to be bland or boring...but nope, I was WRONG. The beans, along with the freshly diced tomatoes and onions were super good. I like a lot of heat, so I added more cayenne than recommended. Served this with turkey burgers and sweet potato fries last night for a perfectly spicy meal. My boyfriend wasn't sure if he liked it or not, since he is used to the standard baked beans as a side dish. I think next time I will either serve it over rice or add some water/extra tomato sauce to it to make it into a chili.

Loved these - just wish I would of used less cilantro.  As hard as I try I am not a huge fan of this herb.  Next time I will stick to my tastes and I will enjoy this even more.  Thanks for this great dish kimmers!

Good recipe. The cilantro is quite overpowering, if I make it again I will put less in or leave it out all together. Served over rice with baguette on the side. Went well.

This is delicious! I didn't have fresh cilantro so I subbed about 3 tablespoons of dried. Coordinated nicely with cheesy chipotle mashed potatoes, also on this site.

I love side dishes that I can throw together on a wim with things I keep around... and an added bonus is that the flavors only get better the longer it simmers. So I decided to prepare this to go with Chili-rubbed pork with apricot bbq glaze...I got this started while I prepared the rest of the meal and dinner was ready in now time. I skipped the cilantro, as my bf thinks it tastes like soap... This paired very nicely with our pork and basmati rice.  Makes fabulous leftovers for lunch too!

Spicy, but good. I used a little less cilantro but otherwise made as written. I tasted it after it was done and it was a little bland so I let simmer for about 10 more minutes to let the flavours settle a bit. Tasted much better after that.

Absolutely delicious! I couldn't find a 19 oz can of black beans, so I used one 26 oz can. Also, two smaller onions worked fine for me. I simmered longer and added in the cilantro during the last few minutes, so it retained its freshness and color. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Very tasty and aromatic.  It's easy to make, and a great way to use up a big bunch of fresh cilantro.  We wrapped it up with steamed flour tortillas.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because of how it looks.  The colors and texture are unappetizing.  But the taste is five stars all the way.

This was okay. It was a lot thicker than I expected. I guess that's how people are able to make it into burritos  the next day. I will try that tomorrow. I only put one onion, and it was a lot!

Very nice dish. I'm always browsing for new recipes. I found this recipe randomly and decided to try it out. Great blend of flavours. However, I decided to be bold and use 1 1/2 tspn of cayenne, since I like the heat. Great flavour, but VERY spicy. I will definitely try this again.

Took the advice of another reviewer and added a can of pinto beans, as well.  Enjoyed this spicy and beautiful side dish, but there are just a couple things that I would do differently the next time.  First, I would peel the fresh tomatoes (didn't like the shriveled skin in the beans) and would cut the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp (that's just a taste preference).  Served with blackened chicken and cilantro-lime rice (both from the AR site), fresh pineapple spears and watermelon wedges.

Easy and so delicious. I made it tonight using 1 cup chopped tomatoes from a can rather than fresh and still fantastic! Everyone ate it up. Perfect on a burrito shell as well.

I'm giving this 4 stars.  It wasn't exceptional, but it was much better than I thought.  And it didn't taste like tomato sauce like I expected.  I think it could use some additional liquid, and then pureed a part of it.  Quick and easy and used up some tomatoes, onions and cilantro I had on hand.

This was delicious!  I only had one large onion (it was enough) and had to use Rotel tomatoes instead of fresh diced.  I let it cook for about 30 min and served over brown rice.  Husband LOVED it!

This is an excellent recipe just the way it is. The first day we eat it over rice. The second day I add rice to it and some shreaded chicken and make it into enchiladas. Yummy!  I use 1, 28 oz can diced tomatoes in place of sauce and fresh

I made this as written but left out the cayenne and passed hot sauce on the table. I also let it simmer for a while.  This is the best black beans and rice I've made and it will be the one I use from now on.

This was a very good black bean recipe with just the right amount of heat.  We had them as a side over rice for our Cinco de Mayo feast, but they could easily be a main dish.  Everyone loved them!

Make this, you'll thank me later.  

I make one change when I make mine..Instead of the tomatoes and tomato sauce, I use the habanero rotel tomatoes.  So amazing when served over yellow rice.  This was one of those recipes I stumbled on and have made it over and over and over again.

This is really delicious, and fast & easy to make.  It takes a little reminiscent of a good vegetarian chili.  I didn't have the green onions or enough cilantro, but the rest of the flavors carry the dish.  I would even consider adding more beans for a ratio of 1.5 beans to 1 tomato sauce.  This dish works great on its own for lunch, or over rice, or on top of a cheese quesadilla for dinner.  I will definitely keep this in my rotation, though I will continue to look for a recipe for delicious beans for burrito fillings/side dish with home-made Mexican.  By the way, the "Best Spanish Rice" recipe on allrecipes.com is fantastic and goes great with these beans.

We love a kick to our food and this filled the bill as written without over powering - (I like a 3/5 hot level so I still get flavor not just heat).  Our cans are in ml so I used a full can of tomato sauce that was over 15 ounces so would have been too runny to eat so I cooked up some basmatic rice and mixed in as well.  Of course this stretched to number of serving the dish made and we ended up eating leftovers as burritos and loved them.  Definitely will make again.  Habanero peppers also give this a little extra kick in the burritos.

Very good.  I cut back on the cayenne and cilantro since my husband isn't a huge fan and also added some grilled marinated-chicken.  Simmered for close to 30 min overall and will make again.

Delicious! I didn't have quite enough black beans so added some frozen corn. Added an extra tsp cumin. Also we only had dried cilantro but still 5 stars! I simmered on low 45 min while the rice was cooking. I look forward to trying this again with fresh cilantro!

My kids and I really liked this.  We used it for burritos topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  I added an extra 1/2 can of black beans.  I used canned tomatoes as that is what I had on hand.  I also didn't have cilantro so used 1 Tb of coriander in it's place.  Will be making it again.

Loved it!  I used less cilantro ... still getting a taste for it.  I added some salt, pepper, and simmered it for 1 hour.  Next time, I would double it and cook it in the crock pot. Just enough spice.  We love garlic and my husband is an onion lover!! Thanks :)

I was meal prepping for my husband and thought these would be good to go with his enchiladas. I doubled the recipe but reduced some ingredients. Out of his personal preference I cut back on the onions/omitted the green onions altogether but added some onion powder. My cans of tomato sauce were only 15 ounces and black beans were 15.5. I should have cut back on the cayenne but didn’t. These were spicier than I expected. I also only used 3/4 cup cilantro instead of doubling.

I love this as a filling for vegetarian/vegan burritos! Made it tonight and added some tumeric for color, flavor and health benefits. Left out cilantro and cayenne as neither hubs nor I like it. I suggest simmering it a bit longer to reduce the liquid which gives a thicker, better consistency for taco or burrito filling. If left runnier, would be awesome on rice! Great recipe, thanks!

My family loves this dish, hence 5 stars.  However, I think I would omit the onion completely except for the green onion,  and would use less tomato sauce because I agree with the other reviewer that the tomato flavor overwhelmed the black beans.  I was disappointed that the black beans didn't feature more prominently. The fresh cilantro and spices were great.

Really good dish with a definite spice kick. I love spice, but those of you who aren't fans might need to adjust the measurements. After reading the reviews, I cut down on the amount of cilantro. I processed 1/4 cup and used only that. I like cilantro and didn't find the amount I used to be overwhelming, but the dish itself would still be wonderful if you want to omit this herb. Other modifications I made: I used 1 onion instead of 2, used 3 diced roma tomatoes, and allowed the ingredients to simmer for approx 30 minutes. Served this over rice and used leftovers for burritos. Will definitely make this again! Thanks Kimmers :)

This was great for bean burritos w/some sprouts inside.  I did not have cayenne pepper so I finely chopped 1/4 cup of jalepenos. Loved the spicy kick will make again and again.

Super yummy & easy to make! I've made it over and over again. It's great over brown rice, and I plan to use it as a filler for burritos.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was SO GOOD.  The only thing I would do different next time is to use reduced-sodium tomato sauce because the sauce was a little to salty.  I loved the chopped garlic!

This is a super versatile bean recipe . . we had it under grilled chicken, with honey and lime zest - yummy!  The beans have the perfect amount of heat.  My husband, typically not a bean-eater, couldn't stop stealing bites out of the pan.

After all of the positive reviews I was really excited to try this recipe. I was sorely disappointed, however. It's not that it's inedible, it's just that the tomato flavor was so overwhelming I couldn't even taste the black beans, even though I used the 28 oz can. When I first made it, I added some other spices to try to balance out the flavors after I tasted how tomato-ey it was. When that didn't help I add a spoon of sugar (which I always add to my pasta sauce) and it helped somewhat. Still I would never make this again. I'm still trying to force myself to finish it.

Great beans. The only change I really made was instead of 16 oz tomato sauce, I used 8 and then added in a part of a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes with chilis - had them leftover and wanted to use them up. I'll make this again.. was really yummy.

Really liked this.  Thought there would be too many onions, but this really had a nice taste and not too oniony at all.  I cut down on the amount of cumin and cayenne pepper and it still turned out well.

This recipe is fantastic.  I followed the recipe but did let it simmer a little longer to make it thicker.  This is spicy (which I loved) but you may want to cut down the cayenne pepper if you are not a spice lover.  The next time I make this, I will probably add more beans. Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good but it was very similar to my usual Black Bean Chili, which has more veggies.  I have no complaints about this recipe though, we just prefer the other one.

Really tasty.  I used 2-16 ounce cans of black beans and served in a warm tortilla.  I have to agree with other posters that this is spicy just enough! Great recipe.

Very very good. I thought about using a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh, but so glad that I didn't. I simmered this for about 30 min. while my "burrito pie" from this site was baking and it got kind of soupy.

Very delicious, very easy. I used dried black beans instead of canned only because canned beans make me gag. Put all ingredients (except cilantro and green onion) in a pressure cooker w/ 1 cup of water and cooked for 35 minutes. Used slow-release method (for you pressure cookers')...perfect perfect side dish. Yum!

This was delicious. Made according to the recipe, other than substituting flat leaf parsley for the cilantro, as some people in my family refuse to eat cilantro. Easy to put together, and filling, as well as tasty. Thanks!

Excellent! Only change I made was using a large fresh jalapeno in place of the cayenne(just had one on hand). I also read other reviews and let it simmer a couple of hours.

Personally the cilantro could have been halfed.  Also another 5 minutes of simmering would have been a good idea but... the dish was delicious!!!

This recipe was super easy to make and tasted wonderful! My fiance ate 2 servings of it and everyone at work made me give them the recipe. I added mild green chiles and it was awesome!
