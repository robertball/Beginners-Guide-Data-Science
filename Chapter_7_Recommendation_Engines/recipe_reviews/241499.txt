Like Chef John, I substitute chicken broth for some of the water to give the dish a better flavor.  This is what made me want to try his recipe over others.

I also like that in his recipe, he doesn't skimp on the Louisiana  andouille (pronounced an-du-ae - the ll's are silent) sausage.  It really makes the right smokey-hot flavor for this dish.   Good andouille tends to be expensive,  and an economy version will just be called "hot smoked sausage" links such as Bar-S or Morell. (Do not use polish Kielbasa - totally wrong flavor.)

Also, there is a difference between "red beans" and "kidney beans".  It is the actual name for a particular type of bean - not just a color. Kidney beans may also be red, but they have a different flavor than "red beans".  Here on the west coast, I can always find dried red beans at Safeway, and Walmart sells canned red beans.

I serve with greens ("the recipe here for "Kickin Collard Greens is my favorite), some cornbread, and sweet tea.

Love your recipe for this classic dish, Chef John!  5 STARS!

My first time EVER making red beans and rice, and this was the recipe I chose. I served it with homemade corn bread (also in AR - search for Grandma's Cornbread) 

How mine differed:
1. Used a ham shank instead of a hock. 

2. I forgot bay leaves. 

3. Skipped the hot sauce.

4. Used pasillo peppers.

5. Used 14oz of regular old Johnsonville sausage w/pork, beef, turkey, and whatever else is in it.

THE VERDICT! 

Pros: 
1. I hate spicy food (and also have a toddler) so my milder version was perfect for us. 

2. My house smelled like Louisiana all day. 

3. Extremely filling! 

4. Huge amount of food and very cheap ingredients!

5. Leftovers! This recipe will feed my family of 2 and a toddler for days! 

Cons:
1. It took about 4 hours total, so my gas stove was on most of the day and someone had to stay home to man the kitchen. Would have preferred to use a slow cooker, but it gave me a solid excuse to watch football all day. (Also, the toddler can reach those knobs. Luckily, she's an obedient one with no early signs of pyromania.) 

2. Can't give the cooked ham bone to my dog, so she was disappointed about that. 

Overall, it's absolutely delicious. If you have several hours to spare and don't want to cook again for a week (or if you need to feed 10 lumberjacks), this is the recipe for you!

I just made this recipe, and it was delicious!! All of the ingredients came together nicely.  At first, I thought I had too much liquid, but I let it cook down a bit without the lid.  I put the lid back on and just let it simmer.  It began to thicken and became perfection.  I can't wait to make this for others...maybe my Superbowl party.  I did not use any hot sauce.  I'm not a spicy person.  Even without it, my husband says it has a nice kick to it.  I also added two chicken bouillon cubes for added flavor, so I actually added very little table salt.  Chef John has made me look good, once again!!

It did not explicitly tell you when to add the beans...add it with the broth.

Amazing. Comfort soul food at its finest. I’ve made this several times and it always turns out fantastic! After sautéing the sausage and veggies, I dump the whole thing in my crockpot, cook on low overnight, 8-10 hours. Winner. The house smells maddeningly delicious in the morning, and I can’t wait to spoon it over rice for dinner!

Delicious. Made this as written when hubby was out of town. The (grown) kids and I loved it. Made it again when hubby was back, but since he doesn't eat pork I substituted chicken andouille sausage and smoked turkey leg for the pork meats. Still very good.

This turned out so well! I made it in the crockpot - I soaked the beans overnight, drained and rinsed in the morning, chopped and sautéed the other ingredients  according to instructions, added them to the crockpot, then let it simmer on low all day and then cooked on high for the last hour or so just to make sure the beans were cooked all the way. I served it with brown rice. Thanks Chef John for such an amazing recipe! I’m glad for another crockpot meal. I’ll be making this again for sure.

Excellent!  I used a pound of chorizo sausage, soaked some dried kidney beans, left out the poblano pepper, salt & hot sauce, used chicken broth in place of water and didn't have a ham hock.  Smelled delicious cooking all day and served up over brown rice was a great presentation.  The flavor had a nice spice that wasn't overwhelming.  Delicious!

YUM!!!  Out of necessity, made it in crock pot, subbed chunk of ham for hocks as store that carries Andouille does not carry hocks, subbed Fresno chilies from salsa garden  to use them up, otherwise followed recipe.   Wonderful!

This was very good.  It was especially good the next day.  I did add cayenne because we like just a little heat.

We're having a Louisiana dinner night with some friends and I decided on making Red Beans and rice...OMG....this is the best.  I made the recipe exactly as it says...no changes.  I also made it the night before, and it does taste better the second day.  You won't be disappointed.   This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have made this several times and it is always amazing! This last time I just threw all the ingredients in a crockpot on low for 10hrs, and it was just as good as cooking it on the stovetop. I do soak the beans overnight and substituted the peppers for bell pepper, because that’s what I had on hand. I also used smoked sausage instead of andouille, and add about 2tbsp of Cajun spices to add the lost flavored from the andouille. I didn’t use oil and I also used brown rice instead of white to make it slightly healthier. Great Recipe!!

Very nice flavor!  Switched it up - used canned kidney beans and smoked sausage. Didn't have the ham but the flavor was still delicious.

oh my delicious!   everyone in our family (8 total) loved this dish.  We had leftovers but they were gone in 3 days.  (That doesn't usually happen with leftovers.)  I substituted canned red beans rather than soaking beans overnight. I rinsed them first. Worked great. Once all the ingredients were added to my pot, I boiled them for about 75-80 minute. (A lot less than the original recipe calls for.)  We all felt the flavors had cooked well together in that short amount of time. About 1/2 way through the cooking time,  I mashed the beans down inside the pot.  For whatever reason, that really made a nice difference in taste and texture. Loved it!  No doubt I'll be cooking this one up again and soon.

Wow. I'll never buy box mix again. Hard to find andouille near us so just made do with smoked sausage, though I think I might try chorizo in the future.

This was so delicious. I left out the hot sauce and added just under a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning. I also added a bit more onion and garlic than it called for. My mom doesn't like a lot of spice, so I mixed in a heaping spoonful of sour cream to her plate and she loved it. Super filling and comfort food at it's best. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Craving red beans and rice tonight but had to make a few subs. I worked  all day so canned red beans instead of dried beans and looking for budget friendly so used smoked lite sausage instead of the Andouille. Also used a little smoke seasoning instead of ham hocks due to the much shorter cooking time.  Put on some brown rice while chopping and lovely comfort food with leftovers. Yum.

Loved it! We used Chef John's recipe for the flavors but did this in our instant pot as we didn't soak our beans overnight and within 50 minutes we had Red Beans and Rice with NO hard beans.

Two pieces of constructive criticism:
1.    I have found that when you use raw dry beans you must soak them, (pref overnight in the fridge), in brine.
If I don't, then the skins are VERY tough and no amount of cooking will tenderize that.   I use 1.5 tablespoons of salt to 2 quarts of water for one pound of dry beans.   8 hour soak is best but  you can go to 12.   Then before you start your bean recipe drain the beans in a sieve, rinse and soak in fresh water.  Then start your recipe (saute-ing the onions, the sausage, celery etc....)  The beans will be ready to go in the pot and simmer by then.
2.   You didn't mention what to do with the ham hock.  I'm assume just put it in with the bean mixture at the beginning of the simmer process?
Otherwise this is a great recipe.!! 
(AND BRINE THOSE BEANS!!!  Try it if you don't believe me.  Beans are cheap)

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception  of only adding about an 1/8 tsp of red pepper.  This will be on the menu from now on. Everyone loved it!

Made this in pressure cooker and it was pot-licking good, even without the ham hock (couldn’t find it here in the U.K.)! No need to soak beans overnight.  Just add them with everything and cook on high pressure for 60min.  This is a crowd pleaser. Thanks, Chef John!

Simple and tasty. I did add extra seasoning because that’s how I cook. I also split this recipe in half because I was cooking for one.

My family really enjoyed this meal.  It is very easy to make as long as you have time time.  It was a little spicy but adding more rice for those who like a milder flavor was all it took to make it perfect.

Husband doesn't eat pork, so made w/ some substitutions. Andouille style sausage made w/ turkey, smoked turkey leg instead of hammock.... Also used my new instant pot at pressure to shorten cook time. Still came out really good.

BEST Chef John!  Excellent on all fronts!  Company LOVED it and ate every bit.  Thought it was funny in the written recipe the beans are left out of the instructions at the point when they should be added to the mix.  GREAT STUFF!

Very good! I used pickled jalapeños instead of the poblano peppers because I forgot to buy them, and it worked out well.

This is by far the best Red Beans & Rice recipe to date.    I left out the poblano peppers and green onions.  I added 1 tsp of creole seasoning.  There was mild heat, but it wasn't so hot that my kids couldn't eat it.

This was awesome. I did switch the poblano pepper for bell pepper but added a jalapeño pepper cut in half no seeds. Definitely a make again.

Followed directions as written, but also added some diced leftover ham. I'm used to red beans, onions, pepper flakes, garlic, and ham hock . This is my new standby beans and rice recipe, for sure!

Yummy.  I made this almost exactly as written except for omitting the cayenne since the andouille was plenty spicy.  We have a country store nearby which sells wonderful meaty smoked ham hocks which added great depth of flavor.  Oh, I did change one other thing.  I used a one pound bag of small red beans, which are smaller and not the same as kidney beans.

It looked so good.  But for just the two of us it was a lot of ingredients and effort for how it turned out.  We found it to be pasty, thick and bland - except for the sausage. Not on our favorite list anymore.

Red Beans and Rice is one of my favorite dishes in New Orleans but it has to be the authentic, long simmered stuff - plain red beans and rice will not do.  This version is perfect.  Extra work but totally worth it!  Very authentic.  I made this for Sunday family dinner (12 people) when we did a New Orleans themed night.  Everyone loved it - even the teenagers!

Hate to dissent from everyone else’s opinion, but... this stuff was spicy. A little too spicy. I like spicy food, but in this case, the cayenne and andouille together stole the show- in a bad way. Good thing I didn’t add hot sauce as directed! Frankly, I’m a little surprised no one else commented or complained about the heat. Oh well- like I said, hate leaving the low scoring review, but we (wife and I) were a bit disappointed. Look at me- I had to drink milk from the jug, while I wiped sweat from my brow!

I used the recipe as listed with the exception of using andouille sausage made from chicken instead of pork.  However, there was NOT a difference in the flavor.  This is BY FAR the best red beans and rice recipe I have ever made!!!  Make no two bones about it, I will definitely make this again!

Im from New Orleans so this is a staple, that I make on Monday. I used pickled tips, smoked sausage, andouille sausage and a tiny piece of tasso. At the end I pull a small bowl of just beans out and mash them, it will make them creamier. Great recipe Chef John. Love all on them

Modified it slightly, like i always do. Tend to spice up beans. As per my wifes culture, Asian, we do not mix rice with our food. Just like my own request to her, never ever, mix spaghetti sauce with the pasta, ever, it is just never done. Exact opposite to the way Filipinos make their spaghetti.  

   Anyway, red beans were good, although as is custom in our house, we do not serve things like this the same day. Next day usually, after the flavors have all melded together.

Yummy Soul food, Cajun food, whatever it is, it's great!! I added some paprika to make the rice a pretty yellow colour and Tony Charaches Cajun seasoning because I love it so. As always, a huge fan of yours. I give it five big ones.

I made three changes: One, I replaced the ham hock with salt pork (and omitted salt). Two, I used Beef Broth. Three, instead of adding hot sauce at the end, I dusted it with Chef Paul Prudhomme Seafood Magic.

So far, family and friends are loving it!!!

Used 1/2 t cayenne but still very hot. I have hot tastes so I couldn’t figure why so little made it so hot. It did allow the dish to remain “tasty” as time went on, so I’ll keep it just the way it’s written.

Followed all ingredients but I used the crockpot instead.  I  soaked beans overnight and sauteed the sausage and veggies a little bit in the morning but then combined with everything in crock pot for 8 hrs on low.  Every few hours I took a potato masher and would mash a few beans to thicken it up.   It was soooo good!!!  I even made homemade cornbread from another site to go with it.  I'm already looking forward to leftovers this weekend!!!!
IMPORTANT NOTE: It uses less broth when you do it this way - I used enough broth to cover everything in the pot, which was less than 2 quarts.

Oh, my gosh...delicious! I only had minimal changes. I added a little bit of baking soda to the water when I soaked the beans overnight, I also used ham shanks vs hocks, and fresh thyme because I had it on hand. I just had to add a celery top during the first part of the simmer for preference. The beans had a good amount of heat ( love hot sauce ). Served it with jalapeno cornbread and rice. The men were pleased! Thank you!!!

I made this with canned black beans because that's what I had on the shelf and I didn't have enough time to cook dried beans from scratch. It was delicious, even using canned beans!! The sauce is well composed. My husband, who doesn't like spicy food, thoroughly enjoyed the andouille sausage in this dish. That says a lot for the recipe.

Flavorful and comforting! The only issue I had was with the skin of the pablano pepper- during the cooking process, it separates from the flesh of the pepper pieces and becomes an unpleasant and fibrous texture amongst the otherwise smooth and rich bean base...next time (and there will be a next time) I’m broiling or searing the peppers until blistered, and then sweating them, to remove the skin. Overall, excellent recipe.

I've never made this before. Followed this recipe pretty much exactly, my family and I LOVED it. I did add a few big chunks of pepper and onion left over from chopped portions for extra flavor. (remove chunks when done) Plus added chopped/torn cilantro with green onions for the top. YUMMM-EEEE.

Wow!  First time I made it seemed like I've been cooking this my whole life.  Rave reviews from my neighbor and my daughter!  I made it a little too spicy for us but worth it extra water we had to drink!! I did use bell pepper instead and broth not water.

Thanks again Chef John. You make me look great in the kitchen! Everyone raved about this meal. My husband told me to make it again because it was so good. I followed the recipe, but I didn't have ham hock.  It was still outstanding. I think the poblano peppers are a must. I did use a potato masher to thicken it up. Yum...!

I have now made this twice...first time at home as in instructions, but substituted green pepper for the poblano pepper as I didn't have them.  Second time I made it while camping using cast iron dutch oven and coals with Poblano.  I do prefer the Poblano option as it definitely adds more flavor.  As for cooking in the cast iron dutch oven...I was using cheap coals so had some problems keeping a constant temp.  But I basically just kept it boiling for the full three hours cooking time.  At three hours, the ham hocks were just breaking down so wouldn't sweat the temp thing too much...just keep a steady boil going,  It was a great warm up and enjoyed by all campers on a cool day.

This was sooo good!  Since we don't like too spicy of food I left out the poblano pepper and used smoked chicken sausage instead of andouille.  I also used the left over bone from my easter ham.  My whole family loved this.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Last night was my first attempt at Red Beans and Rice (this is what happens when I watch food shows on TV ;) ).  Of course I chose a Chef John's recipe since it seems I can never go wrong with his recipes.  I prepared the recipe EXACTLY as written.   I cooked them longer as he demonstrated on his video to thicken them and oh my.... what a success.    They have a little "nip" to them but not too spicy.  We love sour cream so we topped them off with sour cream to our individual taste.  Sour cream also mellows out the heat just a little for my two teenage girls.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be making it again!!

Not bad. Followed recipe but doubled it. Definitely use salt. I used chicken stock and still needed salt. Also the andouille sausage lost a lot of bite/texture. Next time might brown andouille w oil, remove and cook the trinity in that fat/oil, put andouille back in at very end of cooking.

This is a simple and yummy dish, only thing I added was 1 cube of Knorr Caldo de tomate (tomato bouillon with chicken flavor)to the required water instead of salt.

Great recipe!!  I made it almost exactly as written and it turned out fantastic!  Only changes were 1/2 broth and 1/2 water because I didn't have enough broth and added the sausage closer to the end of the cooking time.

Most definitely will make again. The only changes I will make is a little less sausage, cut up way too much, and try to get more uniform pieces of it.
This truly has become one of my favorites after only making it twice. That's how good it is.
Update: I have made his 5 times already. It gets better each time.  It has now made it's way into my 30 day rotation of meals.

It was the best red beans and rice I’ve ever had. A restaurant quality meal for sure. I used two smoked ham hocks, because I had it, and I like to party. Other than that I stuck to the recipe to a “T”.

Oh My....GREAT! here is what I did differently: doubled the onion, used bell pepper instead of poblano, will try the poblano at some point though, extra garlic and in addition to using all spices as listed I also added about 1/2 tbsp of cajun seasoning...Awesome & just the perfect amount of flavor. I researched many recipes and settled on this one & now it will be my go to!

This came out absolutely delicious. I wasn’t able to find ham hocks but I did find ham shank - so I used that. I had to add a little extra broth at the end to get the consistency I wanted - and served with rice. It was perfect!

This recipe was very good. I did use green pepper in lieu of the poblano since the Anduille was already spicy. I only gave four stars since the ham hock I used fell apart and left small bones that could have been mistaken for pieces of ham. Of course if I had bitten into a bone it would have been Chef John’s fault somehow

Fabulous!  This is such a wonderful recipe.  We love red beans and rice, and Chef John's recipe was not a disappointment.  Great flavor, seasoned just right.  Can't wait for colder weather to make it again.

Excellent dinner. I used black beans because that is what I had. I can't handle spicy too well so just used a pinch of cayenne without the hot sauce, etc.. This is filling and tasty. Will make again for sure. Hubby loved it. Very nutritious and fiber filled. Enjoy!!

This was straight-up awesomeness, and just the ticket for post-Harvey Houston comfort food.  The only thing I did differently than Chef John was to not mush up the beans as much at the end to thicken it.  I believe Chef John smashes about 50% of the beans, I only did about 20% at most and it was perfectly to my taste as far as chunky/sauciness, and more attractive dish.   Enabled the rice to absorb some juices better I think.  Definitely recommend using the chicken broth instead of the water.  I used good-quality Cajun sausage (easy to get here).

This was a hit at our house, didn't have the bay leaves and don't care for thyme, but otherwise did it exactly like recipe.  We loved it.  Spicy and good.  Gave my beans a little longer to cook as I only had soaked them for about 4 hours.  We will have this many times in the future.

This recipe is spot on delicious!  My family loved it!  I have little ones so I was light on the cayenne and hot sauce just a little!  I used a Turkey neck instead of a Ham Hock.  Actually had real chicken broth I had frozen from a meal before.  The flavors soared!  Will definitely make this again!

Perfect as written. (One thing, though, Chef John: you didn't specify when to add the beans.) I know it's not authentic Louisiana, but I have also made this by adding 1 cup of uncooked rice during the last 20 minutes of simmering and it's a delicious one-pot meal. Another keeper from Chef John.
