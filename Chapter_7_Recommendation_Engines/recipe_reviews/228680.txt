Delicious and extremely easy!  I did not have any crescent rolls, so used tater tots instead, and I didn't have italian sausage, so used the bulk pork breakfast sausage, and it was really good! Other than that, I made the recipe as given.  Will definitely make it again!!  Thanks  Michele!

I didn't have the exact ingredients available; but this is a great base recipe. Here is what I did:

Browned the following:
12oz. Hot Italian Sausage (bulk)
8oz. Ground Beef
1 Orange Bell Pepper - chopped
1/2 large onion diced
1 heaping tbsp minced garlic

I didn't have any frozen mixed veggies so I added the following:
5oz fresh sliced carrot
5oz fresh chopped celery
6oz frozen corn (thawed)
1 Fresh Jalapeno (chopped)
4 Roma Tomatos (chopped)
Increased Oregano to 1/2 tsp and Black Pepper to 1/2 tsp

I also didn't have a full 16 ounces for Spaghetti sauce, So I added
13oz. Spaghetti sauce with about 3 ounces of water.

I topped this with a can of Immaculate Baking crescent rolls; since these are dairy free (and wonderful!).

This came out delicious! Thank you Michelle!

Made this and maybe it was the frozen vegetables that were in it, but it was only ok.  Next time, I think I will use some fresh vegetables and maybe some biscuits instead of the crescent rolls.  It was just missing something.

This is a new family favorite! I prefer the cheese layer underneath the dough topping so it stays soft. And the sweeter dough varieties that Pillsbury has are even tastier on top!

This is definately a keeper. I did a few things different. I ussed a pound of chicken sausage and I seasoned the meat mixture with garlic and onion powder and adobo. I used a jar of chunky green pepper and mushroom spaghetti sauce. Do add little water like a 1/4 cup to the jar and shake so you can get all the sauce. Lastly I used colby jack cheese. Family loved it...

My family loved this especially my hubby! I've made some changes but as always I use most recipes as a base and do my own thing. I always cook things separate and mix them together later. So I cooked  the mixed vegetables in some vegetable stock and cooked them to about 90% set aside. I used beef sausage instead of the Italian sausage. I also used the crescent dough on the bottom as well. I rolled the dough out in the pan and cooked it for about 20 minutes and put the mixture on top of the cooked dough. Then I put the cheese on top of the mixture and then put another layer of crescent dough on top and spread a tablespoon of butter on top of the dough. This was delicious! I was thinking maybe next time I'll add some sour cream to this mixture that seem to be a good addition to this recipe. Great recipe Michele!

made to the recipe, except didn't have mixed vegetables so I used some corn and some green beans that I cut into smaller pieces,  used Barilla Chunky traditional sauce because I like the bits of tomato in that sauce.   I did put the cheese on the last minutes of baking as others have suggested.
Very easy to make, smells great while baking in the oven!  the hot sausage gave it enough picante for us.  Had everything on hand to make it, hubby was happy, it wasn't a heavy meal, just added a salad, so I am giving this a five.

Made this for my family and it was delicious. Before I added the spaghetti sauce, I added extra oregano and salt, then also added basil and Parmesan cheese to the meat and vegetables mixture because we like lots of seasonings.

Ok base recipe... easy to jazz it up and easy to make.  But, I only gave it 4 stars because it does take a LOT of jazzing... I added more seasonings (according to family's tastes), added shredded cheese (swiss is really good on this!).  One time, I even added sauerkraut to the recipe and it turned out like a bierock (cabbage roll) casserole.  Again, super easy to change up so very worth keeping in the recipe box!

I was disappointed that the rolls didn't cook all the way through and I waited to put the cheese on the top. They were light brown, I added the cheese. When it melted, I served the casserole and the underside of the rolls were gooey. Kind of reminded me of Shepherd's pie, without the mashed potatoes. ADDENDUM: I have decided this is much better the second and third day. Flavors were married beautifully. I was still disappointed the crescent rolls didn't bake up better. I do think biscuits would be great on top but make sure they are cooked all the way through.

Was very good. The cheese burnt a little on our attempt and the dough topping was a little too sweet. Maybe a biscuit topping would have been less sweet and the cheese could be skipped. Will definitely make this again, the sausage and bell peppers make for a delicious aroma and taste.

FANTASTIC!!! I did change the hot Italian sausage to sweet sausage to better suit my family. With the veggies I added (peas, carrots and corn) my only side was buttery mashed potatoes. YUM!!

This turned out way better than expected. The only difference was I used dried chopped onions because I didn't realize I was out of fresh onion. Nevertheless, I followed this to a T and it's so hearty and flavorful. Oh yeah, I baked it for 20 min only because the dough was getting too brown. Saving this recipe!

Made this tonight. It was delish!!  I added fresh mushrooms, tri colored peppers and fresh peas instead of frozen veggies. I cooked meat with Montreal steak seasoning in stead of salt and pepper. I added a layer of both mozzarella  and Parmesan cheese under the croissant layer and then threw cheddar on top last 5 mins of cooking. My picky elderly mother ate every last piece! SUCCESS!!!

My family loved it. It's even better the next day. I didn't have frozen mixed veggies, so I used frozen peas. I had a  biscuit can rather than crescent rolls, too. Someone else suggested putting cheese before the biscuit layer. I did cheese both underneath and on top. Delicious and easy! Admittedly, my first casserole. Not my last!

It was okay. The crescent rolls on top made it just okay. Probably would have been better without them.

My family loved it however made several changes due to what I had available. A couple friends happen to stop by with their son, they loved it too.
I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, I did not have hot Italian sausage only original so I added a small jalapeno from the garden with seeds to meat while cooking. Because I used more burger, I added a little bit more flour, salt, pepper. I did not have oregano so I used MC Perfect Pinch Italian Seasoning and used 1/2 tsp. For the sauce, the brand I buy is smaller than what this recipe calls for so I used 23.5oz jar of Spicy Sausage Sauce plus a half a jar of Chunky 3 cheese. I did not have crescent rolls so I used butter flavored biscuits instead, I used a rolling pin and flattened them. I spread 1 C. shredded cheese on top of meat mix then put flattened biscuits on top, then added another cup of cheese. Baked for 25 minutes. EXCELLENT. I noticed several comments that said it needed some sprousing up...well this will do it! It gives it just enough kick but not where it is too spicy you can't eat it. My five stars is based on my changes, I am sure it is great the way she has it too.
