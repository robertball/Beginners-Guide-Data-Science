I've been making this cake for several years.  This is the first time I've heard of adding the fudge topping.  I always mix a jar of caramel ice cream topping to the sweetened condensed milk and warm it in the microwave so it's easier to pour into and over all those holes.  This cake is even better the next day (if it lasts that long).  Since we're such big fans of Heath Bars, I use no less than 6 on this cake.  This is one of my all time favorite recipes.  It's easy and delicious!

This is a super cake to make! Instead of poking holes, I made horizontal slits across the top of the cake, being careful not to go all the way through. Also, instead of pouring on the condensed milk & caramel sauce separately, I heated them up in a sauce pan over low heat & poured it over the cake so it ran into the slits. Sprinkled the Skor (Heath) chunks over the cake & then topped with low fat Cool Whip. I will definitely make this one again!

My family raved.  Super moist!  I substituted a jar of Caramel for the fudge.  Making it in a bundt pan makes it gorgeous too.  When you flip it out all the milk and carmel runs back down the sides.  Must try!

I hate to give a low rating, but this cake was way too rich.  Even my husband, who can out sweet anyone, coundn't finish his piece.  I'll try it again but I will omit the condensed milk and use half fudge half caramel.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Teri!  **UPDATED 7/23/07**  I made this again last night with these changes and it was wonderful.  I omitted the condensed milk.  I then thinned out a 16oz jar of hot fudge with approximately 1/2 cup of milk.  Poured that on top of the cake and frosted with real whipped cream.  Perfection!

This cake is very easy to play around with.  I've had this with caramel topping instead of fudge and it's delicious.  Definitely not for those who are weight concious but a great treat for those who are looking for something sweet.  Thanks Teri.

Made this yesterday for a birthday party, and everyone loved it...many even agreeing enthusiastically with its' name!  Ha!  That's kinda sad, even!  But, this was delicious, easy, moist, and oh, so decadent!  Definitely a guilty pleasure!  I used 1 C. Caramel Sauce topping and 1 C. Hot Fudge Sauce topping...just drizzled them both over the cake before the whipped topping and crushed Heath bars.  Awesome!

ALWAYS A WINNER!!! I made this cake for a party at work and everyone wanted the recipe.  It is so easy and that is a key for me.  It is so moist and extremely yummy!!  Best if chilled thoroughly.  I use butter fingers instead of toffee because I can never find toffee.

This is also good if you use caramel ice cream topping in place of the hot fudge and either chopped Snickers or Butterfinger Bars in place of the english toffee. This is one of those cakes that you bring to a potluck or family gathering and it's gone as soon as it hits the table.

I've been making this cake for about 10 yrs but feel the need to review it based on the fact that it's absolutely DELICIOUS!  Every single time I make this cake, it's devoured!  I am asked to make it for family and work birthdays all the time, in fact I am making it this weekend for my best friend, which prompted me to finally review it!  I always make it exactly as is, b/c that's how I like it, but you can modify as you like, using condensed milk and fudge/caramel then cool whip, and whatever topping you like (heath bar, or butterfinger, or even drizzling more fudge and caramel) and it always looks really good!  Great recipe, especially for the chocolate lover!

DON'T TRADE THE FUDGE FOR CARAMEL!!! I make this cake all the time like this with the chocolate fudge ice cream topping rather than the caramel other reviewers suggest, and I have actually beat a version that used the caramel in a bake off! The chocolate fudge makes all the difference. If you usually use caramel, follow this recipe and use the chocolate! If your friends and family loved it before, wait until they try it like this. I go a bit more decadent and use chocolate devils food cake instead of German chocolate cake, and I have people who beg me to make it!

Great cake! I made it for Easter and it was a huge hit.  I did make a few changes, 1. I used a whole can of sweetned condensed milk without heating it.  2. I used the whole jar of caramel topping. It made a lot more sauce.  I also used Butterfingers since i couldnt find heath or skor bars, and I put it in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving. It was not soggy at all, it was very moist, but had no complaints about it.  I have been asked to make it again for the next holiday dinner already. This will probably be added to the dessert table every holiday now.

I made this cake yesterday evening and I also submitted a picture of it as well, with that being said this is THE BEST cake I have had in a long time. I had tried other variations of a "Better Than Sex" cake, but this was by far THE BEST!! The only thing different I did was on the top I added just the Bits O Brickle Heath that isn't covered in chocolate and also added pecans. It is really to DIE for so good. I've told all my friends about it and forwarded them to this recipe and gave them a strict warning that it was uber sweet and totally delectable! Just having made it yesterday, I have to admit there are only 3 pieces left.. my boyfriend and I have devoured it..I just really can't say enough about it. I will toss my old recipe and stick with this one!

I love this cake!!!! I tasted this cake at a pot luck and have always wanted to try and make it. It was very easy to make and the whole family loved it. It tastes a lot better if left in the fridge overnight.

I have been looking at this recipe for quite some time.So when i went to the store today,i made sure i wrote down what i needed to make this cake.Okay so i did as the recipe stated just adding a few drizzle of chocolate syrup and melted chocolate pieces just to get a  deeper chocolate taste i baked the cake in two 8 inch square pans.About 4 minutes before the cake finish i heat the condensed milk 2 tsb of butter and the caramel for about 2 minutes in the microwave.So i pulled the cake out put the slit like the other reviewer recommened.Since i didn't have any skor bars i just used hershey toffe almond nuggets and just rough chopped them.I added the candy on the cake so that it could melt on top of the cake and then i spoon the caramel mixture on the cake.I only put whipped topping on one of the cake because my oldest son is a very picker eater.I did drizzle the remaing chocolate and carmael on both cake.And indeed it's a sweet rich cake it's very good me and my kids  really enjoyed it and my daughter friends liked it so thanks so a bunch Kiddos.THE NEXT DAY the cake is so awesome this cake will have you sneaking piece after piece telling yourself your not going eat anymore WoW is all i have to say.BUT I WILL BE ADDING THIS TO MY FAVORITE LIST

This cake sort of collapsed when I tried to make it into a layer cake.  It wasn't pretty, but all our friends agreed that it was better than any sex they had ever had, and they have all had lots of sex!

edit: I recently made this a second time and by the end of the night people were eating out of the pan and pratically licking the pan! ....sexy!

Always a showstopper!  This cake is now the favorite birthday cake among our group of friends.  One time I eliminated the whipped topping, coated the toffee with dry chocolate milk powder, and sprinkled that with some more powder on top of the fudge for an extra chocolate kick.  It tasted great and even looked a little more "up-scale".  Delicious!

I gave this 3 stars, cause it was tasty but so unbelievably sweet! The condensed milk puts it over the top. I would omit the condensed milk next time...

I make this cake but do not use the fudge. Be sure to poke plenty of holes in the cake and I pour the condensed milk on then the caramel while its hot. It soaks in the cake much better. I put the cake in the fridge overnight then add the cool whip and candy bars. Its MUCH better when it has a few hours to sit and soak up and even better when its over night. Exclude the fudge sauce and try only caramel!

I made this cake in a 13x9 cake pan and just left it in the pan after i made it, then i poked the holes with a wooden spoon. i used a jar of caramel topping and a jar of fudge topping plus a can of the sweetened condensed milk. I topped it with crushed butterfinger bars and cool whip. my whole family loved it but co workers said it was too rich.

I made this cake twice (just to let you know, I am a very experienced cake maker. LOL!). The first time, everything fell apart. The second time I used a spring form pan which held it all together. I have to say this cake was disappointing. My husband said "I can think of ten cakes off the top of my head that you've made that are a million times better than this". We didn't end up finishing it. I guess there is no substitute for homemade cake.

AWESOME!!!  No one had a bad thing to say about this dessert.....it is sooooooo delicious.  I baked my cake in a 10x14" pan (I thought a 9x13" would get too full with all the toppings) and it worked out well.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I cannot wait to make it again.  Good for the holidays but also good for any kind of potluck event.

I tried this recipe at a pot luck supper. I was so impressed with it. But didn't find the person who made it. Someone told me that it was a Better Than Sex Cake. So I looked it up on the internet and now I have it. DELICIOUS. WONDERFUL. THE BEST CAKE I HAVE EVER TASTED BY FAR. Thank you for putting it on your site.

This cake was delicious!  I would recommend making it the night before you serve it.  It tastes much better the next day.

Excellent cake!  Not nearly as sweet as I was expecting by the ingredients listed.  I did, however, cut back the candy bars from 4 to 3.  Seemed like plenty to top it.  Makes a lot so unless you want to be eating it for several days, it's better for a larger crowd.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!! And so did my boyfriend and his roommates. I added 1/2 jar of carmel topping to the sweetened condensed milk and I also used 5 toffee bars on top. I liked the cake the day that I made it, but found it was SO good the next day after the milk had soaked into the cake. This is a keeper for sure!!!!

Very yummy! I would recommend crushing up the candy bar as much as possible and keeping them in the fridge until time.

I love this cake. I have been making it for years. I sometimes use only fudge no caramel with fresh strawberries instead of the heath candy bar. It so good. I love it both ways.

Really important to let this cake sit at least 2hrs after you have completed it to get the full effect. The cake is good certainly nothing to write home about & if it is better than the sex you are having than you have my condolences.

I've also been making this cake for years.  It's always a hit at potlucks.  I have to say though, the "true" recipe calls for caramel not hot fudge.  I've never heard of using hot fudge on this.   Recommend using Mrs. Richardson's butterscotch caramel topping (heat it up a bit before pouring into holes).  And yes, you must make the holes (don't just pour the stuff on top or make slits).  Use the end of a wooden spoon.  The holes allow for the condensed milk and the topping to absorb into the cake.   This cake is VERY sweet!!

Made this for Labor Day cookout and it was a huge hit!  I used hot fudge because we are chocolate people but might try the caramel sometime.  My niece even called me a couple nights later to get the recipe because she was craving it!  She went to the store at 9:00 at night to get the ingredients and made it that night.

After baking the cake mix, I lightly cut a "checker board" pattern into the hot cake, and poured the condensed milk (mixed with a touch of the hot fudge).  After cooling, spread the rest of the Hot Fudge.  And, topped with Cool Whip and the Heath Bars.  After dinner, we cut and this was a gooey, fall apart'y mess.  Sooo good, it tasted like the devil made it - but I didn't like how it did not stay together.  After sitting in the fridge all night, it was better tasting and cut as it should.  CHILL FOR SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE DIVING INTO THIS!!!

WOW! I had never made this particular version of the cake, and it was devoured within a few minutes. I did make a few changes. I heated the hot fudge sauce for about 45 seconds in the microwave, and I blended chocolate and french vanilla whipped topping together to spread on the top. It was excellent, and I will definitely make it again.

This is a fantastic cake that is very moist and rich....however, I think the current picture is not right as that one is showing a yellow cake.   This recipe calls for a German chocolate cake mix.

This is an awesome cake.. :)    But I did change just a few things ..  I used a dark Chocolate cake mix instead of the German..and I used Milky Way Carmel topping (1 jar) that I heated with the milk..  I also used a knife to make small slits in the cake instead of the holes.. For the topping I did used Heath Bar Toffee bits.. Not chocolate covered though (lots of them - I like them..)  .. and Everyone enjoyed the cake with a dollop of fresh whipped cream (the cake is sweet so I cut back on the sugar in the whipped cream..)    Enjoy.. :)

I've made this several times, and it's always a big hit. You can get creative with the topping depending on what you have on hand. Instead of candy bar bits, I've used a mixture of chopped nuts, butterschotch and chocolate chips. Very good!

Really sweet and really good!!!I use real whipped cream instead of cool whip and sometimes substitute Crispy Crunch bars(Canadian, kind of like a Heath bar) instead of the toffee bars.

OMG, this recipe was *SOOOOOOOO* good!!! Days after the cake had gone, the memory of it lingered. I would turn to my husband and say, "You know what I miss?" He'd reply, "What?" To which I'd answer, "THE CAKE!" You see, mine is the sweet-tooth and his is salty, but even he gave it a 4.5 STAR rating. That is high praise! This cake was so exceptionally good that I'm going to have to force myself to wait a while before making it again. I give it FIVE STARS and a big glass of milk! ;)

We had a dinner party at some friends house and I was told to bring a dessert and I got on the internet to my recipe.com and found this one.  Everyone loved it and made me feel really good because i don't really care for chocolate and they were really amazed i fixed it.  It was so easy to do and thats the part i liked the best.  Thanks Teri,I am so pround you submitted the recipe to my recipe.com.

Super moist and decadent.  It was gone in a few hours at work.  The type of dessert that anyone will like.  The only change I made was that I used 1 cup of caramel and 1 cup of hot fudge.  It was great and so easy!

Incredibly easy! I made it the day before it was served since I read reviews that said it was better the next day. OH.MY.GOODNESS! It's so moist, rich and yummy! I had several people ask me how it was made and they too were surprised at how simple it was. I will definitely make this again!

Really good and really easy. This recipe was actually on the side of the german cake mix box. Also, I used butterfinger since we prefer that.

Followed the recipe and directions exactly as written. I had high expectations, with the name and all, but the cake wasn't as great as I hoped. I've had other cakes that I would consider better than sex.

My boyfriend had this at a party and requested it.  I used caramel topping instead of fudge because that's his favorite.  I also made my own whipped cream.  Awesome!  Thank you!

What can I say this was awesome! Better than sex? Maybe? Anyhoo, my husband and I ate most of this cake by ourselves. Serve with coffee or milk as it is a bit sweet, but other than that this cake is a hit. I will be making this again. Next time I will poke more holes in the cake so that the sweet milk will become more absorbed into the cake, but with that said it was easy and yummy!!! Thanks for sharing!

I made this cake for Valentine's Day, everyone loved it! I used caramel instead of hot fudge. I made the cake the night before and had a piece to taste test. It was good, but the next day, after chilling in the refrigerator overnight, it was PERFECT! Definitely chill the cake for a few hours before serving. It was like a different cake the next day.

Very rich! Don't go overboard with the sweet milk or fudge (or caramel in my case) because it will be TOO sweet to eat. This is a great cake when your sweet tooth is having a major craving.

I made this cake a loooong time ago when I saw Paula Deen make the recipe.  I can't remember if I used caramel sauce or chocolate syrup, I'm thinking chocolate syrup.  But I know either way is "better than sex".  

This cake is sooo good, and so simple.  I recommend it to any chocolate lover.  5 stars!

I've been making this recipe for years. There are so many ways to play around with this recipe. My favorite was to poke the holes in it with the wooden spoon then pour the sweetened condensed milk in the holes (used a "barbeque" ketchup bottle to make it easier) then I added raspberry/rhubarb jam in the holes. I topped the cake with cool whip and shaved chocolate. The cake was delicous and a HUGE hit! Now that I'm talking about it...I'm making it tomorrow!!

It's not often that my family will polish off an entire cake in the course of a couple of hours, but I saw it happen today with this recipe. It was not nearly as rich as I had expected, but absolutely delicious, and oh so moist! I did change a couple of things, of course. I poked holes with the end of a wooden spoon, as others had suggested, and I used caramel topping instead of chocolate. The biggest changes I made were these: I didn't use the toffee since I forgot to buy it at the store, so I substituted chopped pecans; I also mixed about half a package of french vanilla instant pudding mix with the whipped topping. Absolutely superb! I will be making this often.

Wow!  Made this cake for my husbands birthday party and it was a HUGE hit!  Only change I made was using one-half chocolate syrup and one-half caramel.  We'll be making this one again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Hey, I like sex...but I LOVE cake!  I love this cake and so did everyone else who was at the party!  Great recipe anyway you choose to top it.  I used carmel, but it is great with chocolate too.  Make sure the milk is handy!

I've made this twice.  Once as exactely written w/ 2C chocolate, and once w/ 1c carmel and 1C chocolate as others have suggested.  I probably wont make this again because it is sooooooooooooooo sweet!!  We ate it none the less, but w/ huge quantities of milk.  If you don't mind super sweet, than this is a perfect and easy cake to make for your family.

I tried this recipe because it sounded like sometihng the kids and I would like. I wondered if it may be a tad too sweet or rich for my husband's taste though.  Turned out great and my husband loved it even more than the rest of us! I made one as a test to eat here at home before a family gathering to see if it was suitble to bring there. Not only was it suitble it was gone quick! Second time I made this cake it dissapeared just as fast. I've made it three times already this week!

I made the mistake of letting my kids try this.  They now demand having it as their birthday cake.
Excellent dessert.

I hate to be a party pooper, but this really didn't do much for me.  Next time I need a gooey sweet fix I'll just eat the sweetened condensed milk on a spoon (one of my vices!).  
This cake is not better than sex, IMHO.  Hubby agreed on that too!

WOW! I made this for my husband's birthday and it was a HIT!  My husband doesn't usually have dessert, but asked for 2 PIECES of this!  He said it was the best cake he's EVER had!  I think this will be requested quite soon in our house.  Took the little bit of remaining cake to work and had to make copies of the recipe for co-workers!  Thanks Teri!

It is very, very good. Super easy! Thanks Teri!
I needed to bring a chocolate coconut cake to 
work and I added coconut to the cake batter,the hot fudge, and then I toasted some and sprinkled it over the whipped topping.. It was wonderful!
I got a ton of raves!  Yum Yum!

This cake is delicious and just melts in your mouth.  My family and I loved it, we served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to contrast the chocolate flavor.  I'm not much of a toffee fan, so I used melted chocolate frosting instead of the hot fudge topping and then iced the cake with the hot frosting.  It left a pretty outside that I sprinkled powdered sugar over.  I'm sure I'll make this cake again!  Thank you Teri!

I've actually made it before this is my second time. This time there is no caramel, not toffee chips either. It was pure delicious evilness the first time. It's Valentine's Day 2020... We will see this time around.

I've been making this cake for at least 20 years now.  After preparing the batter, I sprinkle 1 cup of mini chocolate chips over it before baking.  I use the 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk followed by a 17 oz jar of Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Caramel topping.  Just before serving, I sprinkle 1/2 cup of toffee bits and 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans over the Kool Whip.  Because it is so rich and so sweet, I find I can cut the 13 by 9 cake into 24 pieces and everyone is satisfied.

This was the hit at the Super bowl party:) I did use real whipcream,  and used a bunt pan, like people suggested. I also did half fudge and half carmel...So yummy and very pretty...

I have been making this recipe for years and have never heard of using hot fudge.  I have always used carmel ice cream topping and it gives it another flavor to savor...  I also have made it without the condensed milk, poking the holes and using only the carmel topping.  It is a little less sweet that way..

Very good! I mixed the fudge topping and the sweetened condensed milk together and poured them both over the warm cake and it turned out great. Very rich though, I wasn't able to finish my piece.

Wow. I didn't know cake could be this good! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the cool whip topping. I made my own icing (1.5 c. whipping cream, 3/4 c. 10x sugar and 6 tsp baking coaco). I also used a fudge recipe from this site. The cake was wonderful, although I suggest eating it same day, as the bottom starts to get pretty soggy after a day or so. Overall, I loved it an will be making it many more times!!

I just wanted to share how I played with this wonderful cake recipe for the Holidays.  I used boxed GINGERBREAD cake mix, and used the caramel rather than the chocolate topping.  This was a fantastic dessert that had my party guests begging for the recipe!  A new Christmas tradition here!

I've been making this cake for years. Everyone loves it!

It's also good w/ Smucker's butterscotch sundae syrup...when you want something other than caramel. It's an easy dessert, and definitely better the second day.

Have been making this for years.  It's a winner.  Here's a hint for the cake mix....I always add a teas. of vanilla to the batter, which takes away some of the "cake mix" taste.  Great recipe!

Wow! This is delicious and easy to make! Definitely for those with a sweet tooth.  Everyone who tried it loved it and wanted more.  I used all chocolate and chocolate whip, next time I'm trying caramel. I also used crushed butterfingers since I couldn't find the heath bars.  I don't see how you can go wrong with this one!

I've made this several times before. Yes it's rich, but eaten in moderation (which is difficult with this one!) it more than satisfies the sweet tooth. Have made this for a group and just for fun, varying it just a little each time. You can't beat sweetened condensed milk. (Especially since the cook gets to scrape the can!)

I made this for Father's Day, and it was a huge hit. I also warmed up the sweetened condensed milk with some caramel ice cream topping before I poured it on the still-warm cake. You go into this recipe knowing you'll come out with something excessively rich - how could it NOT be, with chocolate fudge and sweetened condensed milk and crushed toffee bars? My coworkers devoured the rest of it the next day.

The recipe was awesome. I had to change a few items since I used what I had on hand. I used caramel topping instead of hot fudge and I used a mixture of peanut butter and powdered sugar mixed together into crumbs for the topping. It was a big hint with everyone.

Although this is an excellent and very easy cake to make I've rated it 4 stars because it can't be better than Red Velvet!  

I used only 3/4 of the condensed milk because it just seemed like it would be too sweet with the whole can.  I used about 12 oz of hot fudge and only two Skor toffee bars because my mom said she didn't like candy on cake and it WAS for my pot-luck Mother's Day party otherwise I would have prefered 4 bars.

Everyone enjoyed it and I will definately make it again, and next time will try it with caramel and all 4 toffee bars!

Holy cow!!!  Talk about a total hit.  3/4 of the cake was the first evening and it was suppose to be for a birthday party the following day....I used Triple Chocolate cake mix which has chocolate chips in it rather than the German chocolate mix.  Either way the cake is fabulous....Thank you so much for this recipe.

I would give this recipe five stars, but the holes in the cake make it fall apart easily and difficult to cut into pieces.  Next time, I will try not to make as many holes and hope that the chocolate and milk are absorbed anyway.  Overall, this is a good cake for chocolate lovers, but not my favorite.

This is awesome.  I made it twice in one weekend, once with a cake mix and once with a from scratch chocolate cake.  Excellent!

I made this cake for my Valentine's Day dinner. My boyfriend and I loved it. The cake is very moist and the flavor is heavenly. It is not too sweet, it is just right. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. I plan to make it often in the future.

I needed a quick and really good cake for a birthday party at work.  This one takes the "Cake".  Very good, not too rich and a crowd pleaser!  From now on, I'll have the ingredients on hand.

This was excellent!  I now keep all the ingredients on hand, because the cake disappears out of the pan almost as soon as it hits the table.

I followed this recipe exactly and I found it to be TERRIBLE.  The tastes didn't go together quite right and it was so sweet that it overwhelmed the chocolate.  It was soooo bad that I will never make it again.

It was fabulous! My co-workwers were 
very impressed. My mom and my hubby (both
chocoholics) were in heaven. It was easy 
and the kids helped break the candy for
the top and poke holes in the cake. I can't
remeber the last time I made a cake that
brought in this much attention! Thanks

This is a very good, tasty and deliciously evil dessert.  I wouldn't recommend the toffee for small children that cannot chew well.

This cake did NOT live up to its name.  I don't know what all the fuss is about.  BIG disappointment, especially  given the name.  The Hershey's cake I made (off the back of the silver cocoa can) went over in a much bigger way.

All I can say is ... AWESOME!  In terms of scrumptious, easy, quick, transports well - it's all that!  I took this to a party and it disappeared in less than five minutes - mostly the crumbs too!  Excellent chilled also!

This is also a very moist cake. I did not like the fudge topping as much as the caramel of the other Better Than cake.

Try adding a jar of caramel ice cream topping with the sweetened condensed milk it is great too. Can be a little rich, but if you like rich cakes this is great.

THE CAKE TURNED OUT GREAT! IT WAS QUICK, EASY, AND DELICIOUS. MY FAMILY COULD NOT BELIEVE I MADE IT, THEY THOUGHT I BOUGHT IT ALREADY PREPARED.
IT WAS A GREAT RECIPE AND I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.
