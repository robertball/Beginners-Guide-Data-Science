these were pretty good. A nice change from regular cake-balls. I didn't have a way to display mine on sticks, so I made regular balls and and added sprinkles while the chocolate was still wet instead of decorating with contrasting chocolate. The white ones are way tastier than the brown ones. I'd like to experiment with this and make them raspberry-filled.

Maybe I made the Pops too big, but I could only get about 20 out of the recipe.  Overall they were a big hit at a football party.
