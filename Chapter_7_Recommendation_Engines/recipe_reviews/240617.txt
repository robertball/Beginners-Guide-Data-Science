Added a small box of orange jello, without preparing, to sour cream and it's wonderful just like my Mom would make it when I was a child. Thank you so much for sharing!

I have a GREAT TIP to make this salad much faster. For those of you that have a "Salad "Spinner....you can shave 3-4 hours off the prep time waiting for fruit to drain. I made a half recipe, so I was able to put all the fruit into my salad spinner and PRESTO!! Your fruit is ready to prepare right away! 
I loved the suggestion of the orange Jello powder, I mixed it separately with the sour cream before adding to the fruit mixture.  I took it a step further by adding a handful of maraschino cherries cut in half,  toasted coconut and toasted almonds. If I had macadamia nuts, I would of used that instead of almonds. But the salad was fantastic! You could add bananas if you knew there would be no leftovers, for cut bananas can turn brown if not consumed in a day. I made this salad today for a test run to see if  it would be good enough for my Hawaiian Luau Party next month. This salad will be a crowd-pleaser. You won't be disappointed,  especially  if you add the other ingredients I suggested.

I made this for a party and everyone absolutely loved it! I added a box of orange jello as suggested in the comments and it was sooooo good! There were no leftovers and some of my guests were sad that it was all gone. Wonderful recipe!

Made this for a dinner party last night and it was a hit. Brought none home. I think the bowl was licked clean. I did add a sprinkle of cinnamon on top, but this is a great recipe just like it is written. Mahalo!

I made this and my son at first didn't want to try it. Once he did I've had to make it three times now:)
