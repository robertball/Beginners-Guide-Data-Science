This was a great, quick to prepare recipe. However, instead of putting it in a pan, next time I'm going to make drop cookies out of it, using a small ice cream scoop and putting on a waxed paper lined platter. My family didn't think it would taste good because it looks dreadful when done, but it went over great. It made two loaf pans full. I was able to send some home to guests. Some of my family doesn't like fruitcake, but they liked this recipe. Only a tiny bit is now left for my husband to enjoy. I, alas, have diabetes and can't eat this. It is best to let this sit in refrigerator overnight for more flavor.

This is a wonderful holiday cake, especially for those people who don't normally like baked fruitcake. It is more like a candy than a cake.

I must give this recipe 5 starts for its wonderful taste. However, it sure comes out looking as something other than a loaf of fruitcake: it's gooey, and that aspect may turn some people off (like it did my husband). I think I'll try adding some more crushed Nilla wafers to it to try and firm it up more. Again, as to the taste, one can't stop eating.

This a wonderful recipe. A friend at school back in the early 1960 would bring this to school and share with me. I lost my recipe and was happy to find this recipe. Everyone in my family loves this fruitcake and has a hard time letting it mellow in the frig.

I have looked for this recipe for such a long time. My Mom used to make it. I thought it was a dream but here it is. I'm glad I found it. It's a great fruitcake.

I don’t like fruitcake. However, this fruitcake tastes really good! It’s not your traditional fruitcake, but the changes make it absolutely enjoyable! Unfortunately, it didn’t set up very well. That’s ok! Spoon it into a bowl or over vanilla ice cream and enjoy!

Omitting the coconut milk will solve the 'too soft to cut' issue and the fresh/frozen coconut provide ample coconut flavor.  My Grandmother and aunts made this cake annually for Christmas, packing the cake in small narrow boxes lined with foil to reserve moistness.  Slicing thinly is imperative as it is rich and makes the cake last longer if you can stay out of it, lol.
