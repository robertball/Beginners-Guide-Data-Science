My mother-in-law grew up during the depression and her French Canadian grandmother taught her how to make this recipe. I am rating this one a "five" with some minor changes. This recipe calls for 4 cups of flour, which is too much, leading to the "tough, chewy" texture that some reviewers are complaining about. Start with 3 cups of flour, 1 cup of broth and 2 eggs. The mixture will be a bit sticky, so I turn the dough onto a floured silpat (a silicone mat) and gently work in a bit more flour and then roll it out fairly thin. Then I use a pizza cutter to cut the sliders. Tonight I made the recipe more brothy, like chicken soup, but I've also made it thicker. My husband's family loves it over mashed potatoes---starch nirvana! I also like to add some dried herbs, a little garlic powder and a few bouillon cubes to the chicken while it is cooking for more flavor.

This was really good!  The sliders are a little chewy, I'm not sure if I did something wrong, and it doesn't say how thin to roll out the dough, so maybe I could roll it thinner next time.  I added baby carrots to the broth while making the sliders.  I also prepared the chicken the day before and put the broth in the fridge, so I was able to remove all of the fat off the top.  My family loved it too!  Thanks!

I LOVE sliders. In our family however, we make it with pork. We buy a fairly inexpensive pork roast and "stew" it like you do a chicken, with onions, celery and chicken broth. Then, make the sliders and continue as with the chicken recipe. It is SO yummy!!!!!!

WOW!  I have been looking for an old-fashioned chicken and noodles recipe 
for a while now.  This one fits the bill.  At the end, to the reserved broth, I added 
cooked carrots, celery, onion, celery seed, and a little sage to augment the 
heartiness of the gravy mixture.  THIS IS A KEEPER!

I have been searching for this recipe!  I grew up with this meal.  It was always a family favorite and a great meal for our entire family to share together in the winter, all the cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents.  We made "sliders" a family event!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I can't wait to feel like a kid again with my family!

This is an excelent recipe! Myself I like the broth left a little less thick. Probably because thats how my mother always made it. Also as a variation, after boiling the chicken a little garlic butter rub and some simple seasoning on the skin of the chicken and bake in the oven to crisp the skin. Chicken served on the side instead of in the soup itself. At any rate - Still very good - excelent recipe!

This was very good, but I only loosely followed it...I used 2 chicken breasts and 2 thighs with loads of fresh basil from the garden, a touch of red pepper, and loads of sauteed garlic.  I didn't have celery on hand so I used carrots, green pepper and broccoli from the garden.  For the noodles I went 50/50 white/wheat flour.

My husband and I just loved this recipe. The dough was fantastic to work with by using my mixer with the dough hook and rolling it out using my pasta machine. The only problem I had was thickening the gravy. My pasta had no extra flour on it so my gravy wasn't thick enough. Next time I'll thicken it with extra flour. Fantastic!

Thank you so much for this recipe.  My family really liked it.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken and it worked great.  I also found that a pizza cutter worked well to cut the noodles.  I will definitely make this again!

This is similar to the recipe my grandmother used and it has now come down to the fifth generation.  My kids always want to have this for Christmas.  No one is worried about turkey, vegetables or anything else - as long as we have "Chicken potpie".

Msmario, I always knew this dish by the name "putzin" too!  You are the first person to use the same name. Sometimes when I call it "putzin" people think I mean Poutine , which is totally different...but good!

My family is french canadian and we have made this is the exact recipe that we use too except we also add carrots to it!! It is absolutely a delicious, comforting version of chicken soup that has been in my family for a least 4 generations that I know of and I look forward to a big bowl of it EVERYTIME it is served or when I make it! :)

This recipe is simple, but very time consuming. Nevertheless, my family loved it. I added spices of my own to flavor the chicken broth the way I like it. It didn't turn out as thick as I would have liked it to be, but I had some rice in the fridge so I just poured it on that. Will use this recipe again.

My sisters and I grew up on this dish...definitely a favorite.  My father came from a very large family(he was the baby..the 13th child).   Even my grandckids have been raised with what we call "putzin".   and even beter the next day.   Economical, but tasty.   hmmm....honey?   guess what we're having tonight...lol

This was really good. I had to add quite a bit of chicken boullion, crazy salt, and salt and pepper for flavor as the broth didn't have much flavor to it. Otherwise reminded me of a great homecooked southern meal.

This is so simple and delicious!  There wasn't much broth left the second day after having soaked into the sliders, but still so tasty nonetheless.  I agree with others that this really needs some veggies in order to make it a more complete meal.  I placed lettuce at the bottom of my bowl as I filled it and it was cooked nicely simply from the soup itself.  The chicken comes out so tender it's very easy to de-bone.  Additional spices could be added if desired.  I really believe one has to stick with the home-made pasta for this one!  "Sliders" where did that term come from?  I always thought it referred to mini-burgers of some sort.

Good basic recipe. I added my favorite spices to the broth to add more flavour. I also added some veggies to the finished product for a more "complete" meal. I had never made homemade noodles before so i had no idea how much broth to add. I ended up adding almost a cup.

the chicken and broth are both very yummy.  I think I probably did not roll out the noodles thin enough.  They were very strange and not noodle-y at all.

This was a hit with my family. It tasted like the perfect "chicken and dumplin'" recipe I'd been looking for. I did not have bay leaves, so I used seasoned salt, pepper, and sage.

My 7 year old loved rolling out the noodles. It was a great way to use up our left over turkey. I am giving it 5 stars as a "kids recipe"  I would give it a 4 for an adult meal.

our family enjoyed this recipe very much. I just happened on this recipe as I was boiling a chicken to do "something" with it.  Thank you, you saved my dinner!  I did add seasonings and vegetables while boiling the chicken then strained the broth. yummy!!!

This is a recipe that my Meme made and past onto my mother who in turn past onto me.  In order to add a little more chicken flavour add some chicken soup base, make sure the noodles are rolled out thin so they are not left chewy or doughy. We served our sliders over mashed potatoes.  Very good.  This is also called "Poussin and sliders"

This is very similar to our Sunday family dinner, that included aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.  We gathered at my grandparents home and everyone brought a portion of the meal (several families providing the beef).  I am assuming that they used beef because my grandparents had a diary farm?  My grandmother did not use an egg, but I think I will try it next time I make them.  She taught me how to make these and started with some (a coffee mug as a measure) of the beef broth (and I add garlic my stock), in a large bowl.  She then sprinkled flour over the broth, saying "you need to let the flour breathe."  We continued adding flour while stirring after each addition.  Once it starts making into a ball (Kneading towards the end),roll it out very thin and cut into 3" by 3" pieces.  The broth will need water added and bring to a boil.  Drop the sliders into the broth, cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes.  She always said not to remove the cover or the sliders would be doughy, not sure if this make a difference.  Now that the weather is turning cold again, I am craving them and will have them for Sunday dinner with my granddaughter!

We enjoyed this recipe. The noodles get chewy (which my husband loved), but I think next time I will make them much smaller than the recipe calls for. I also had to add flour to the broth to get the "gravy," but it was quite delicious.

Put chicken in oven instead of in broth.
Brown about 20 minutes.

This was one of my late grandmother's specialties and one of my favorites. As a kid hanging around her kitchen she would let me help roll and cut the noodles. As some have mentioned, the chicken can be served separately from the noodles and gravy. The gravy by itself, if properly thickened, works well over mashed potatoes as well.

my family really liked this dish. I made a couple of changes, though. After straining the stock, and removing meat from bones, i added diced celery, carrots, and onions to broth. I let these simmer while I prepared the sliders. This made a tasty and nutritious addition.

This was such an amazing comfort food! I did throw a couple of carrots in the stock but other than that kept it the same. I didn't have any issues with the noodles they turned out perfect and I also  didn't need to add any additional flour to the broth it thickened up just right. So tasty certainly worth the trouble of making the noodles and really it wasn't that much trouble.

I liked the recipe but with modifications.. I added carrots and more seasoning. Next time I’ll roll out the dough a bit thinner to make the noodles more delicate. All in all a great comfort dish.

Loved this recipe!  My in-laws make this for holidays and it's fantastic.   But I wanted to try making it just for my family instead of large gatherings.   This recipe let me do that and it turned out really well!! Thank you for the great instructions!  Only thing I have to work on is rolling the dough thinner...it puffed up quite a bit.  When it springs back I'll let it rest then roll again.  I'll also make and freeze the dough beforehand to keep my kitchen cleaner...I had flour everywhere!

I love this! I didn't follow the instructions exactly but it was awesome! I have been looking for something like this for years. My grandmother made sliders when I was a child and no dumplings ever came close.

we've been making this in my family for generations. we boil chicken legs for an hour with chicken bouillon, s&p, & garlic in the water. I never measure, just use the juice and some flour with some salt to make the dough. never tried shredding the chicken  into the broth, we always baked it afterward; will try shredding it in next time. one piece of advice would be to drip the noodles in one at a time directly into the bubbles. if you don't, it could clump together. and definitely a weekend recipe. very time consuming. whenever I'm upset, I'm making glisançe! (what we call it)

Speaking for myself This was really good.  However it wasn't something my picky boys would go for, but their weirdos who don't understand good old fashion food.  

I used frozen chicken breast.  I boiled with carrots & celery along with seasoning & a bit of chicken bouillon.  Once things we're tender I pulled them from the broth.  I then used the suggestion of another for the noodles 3 cups flour, 1 cup broth, 2 eggs.  I cooked the noodles in the broth before adding back the chicken & veggies. Very tasty, and satisfied my need for comfort food.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Not great, but interesting to have made noodles for the first time. Definitely a waste to discard the vegetables, since the end-product lacks those when you follow the recipe.

This has always been my way to make chicken and dumplings, it is a no fail recipe, just add the broth to the pour mixture slowly until you get it it form a nice dough ball, if too much flour is left add a little more juice, if it's too wet, add a little more flour.  Make sure when you roll them out you flour your work surface and rolling pin and it will be as easy as pie and delicious.
