This is a great recipe! After reading the reviews I cut all the herbs in half and the flavor was perfect!  I've tried many different dumpling recipies, including the baking mix, and I've never had such perfect fluffy dumplings.  

For those of you who get 'soggy, sinking, or gluey' dumplings you have to leave the lid on for the entire cooking time.  If you lift it off before you will ruin your dumplings - every time!

These were absolutely delicious!  Delicate, light, fluffy, perfect dumplings.  I did note the suggestion of the original poster (Ronnastefan) and cut back the salt to 1/4 to 1/2 tsp... This is such a versatile recipe with herbs that can easily be changed to complement any dish that would benefit from dumplings.  Will definitely become one of my "go to" recipes.  Thanks so much for posting it.

Not what I was expecting..  They did come out fluffy, but seemed a little too overseasoned.  I'll cut back on herbs next time.

This was good, and added some nice flavor to my chicken stew.  After reading the other reviews, I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp and all the herbs to 3/4 tsp.  I also added 1/2 tsp onion powder and used 1 cup buttermilk instead of 3/4 cup milk (to make it taste more like biscuits).  This will replace my regular dumpling recipe.  Thanks!

Yummy, throw them over hot beef stew in a crockpot, cover, and cook 30 minutes or until done.

My family liked these and thought they were fine, but I found them too salty and I followed the recipe precisely. So, if I ever make these again I think I'll cut back on the salt. It had the right amount of herbs though. I think a half teaspoon of salt would be fine, considering the soup or stew you're adding them to is bound to be salty enough on its own. Either I'd do that or I would use unsalted butter.

I made these exactly as specified.  The were superb! I don't think I experienced the issue with the salt that others did since I always use homemade unsalted stock and unsalted butter when I make my stew/gravy.  It is always best to adjust seasonings at the end, but if you use canned/prepared stock or cubes, go light on the salt and you can always add more towards the end.  Thanks for a great recipe! Just like Grandma used to make!

After reading the reviews,I left out the salt, cut the thyme and oregano to half a tsp and used a full tsp of parsley. These adjustments were just right for our tastes. I would make these again. Thanks.

Really easy and cooks up to just the right, satisfying consistency!  Easy to alter, too, depending on the flavors in your soup or stew!

Awesome!  Did them in the slow cooker.  They took about 45 minutes to an hour on low.  I added garlic and onion powder and they needed a little more milk than written, but otherwise awesome!  I used them with a beef stew recipe also from this site!

I've been experiment cooking lately since hubby became diabetic.  I used half oat flour and half all-purpose.  The oat-flour made them heavier so they didn't get as big but cooked inside with a good texture...  I'd make them this way again except I'd  half the herbs and they'd still be flavorful imo...  :)

These are easy and tasted wonderful.  They were very light and fluffy. I reduced the salt and took the thyme out since my husband is not a thyme fan.  Highly recommend.

This was fantastic! Absolutely no leftovers. There were too many herbs. I read the reviews a few days ago and forgot that people had suggested reducing the herbs and salt (mine weren't over-salted).  They were super fluffy! I used buttermilk instead of milk and replaced 1/2 cup flour with whole wheat flour. Will definitely make again!

I tried this recipe for the first time today and was very pleased. Luckily, I had read some of the reviews and cut back on the salt, but I was a bit suspicious of the amount to begin with and very likely would have cut it back anyway.  These dumplings were light and delicious, very enjoyable.  I added two tablespoons of sour cream with the milk because we enjoy that taste.  I have to say one thing though, I used a tablespoon and a half cookie scoop to drop the dough in and I still got 22 dumplings. I can't imagine how you could 'drop by rounded tablespoons' would only yield 6 dumplings.  I almost doubled the recipe - thank goodness I didn't.

These were some of the best dumplings I have ever tasted. I love the herbs and they were so easy to make. My daughter who hates anything doughy asked if I could make them every night. They are very light and fluffy and so very flavorful. Try them with your next stew you will love 'em!

Really good, really simple, makes enough to fill a pot of soup. Listen to the other users and don't put in a whole teaspoon of salt, I think that must be a typo.

They were good - but WAY too salty (and I love salt). Cut the salt in half and they will be fine.

I used heavy whipping cream and they all fell apart, but the soup is amazingly good. Better than before the dumpling mistake; tastes great! I will try this again. The flavor is great. I used fresh herbs and it was perfect.

I didn't have all of the spices that it called for so I improvised by adding a little Italian seasoning with what spices I did have. Also added garlic powder and cheddar cheese. I put them in my chili and they were great! My husband liked them too. Mine took longer to cook but that was due to I made these, not in something just them by themselves, to take to my parents for THANKSgiving. My mom and my brother used the leftovers for Sausage Gravy Biscuit and said they added a great taste to it.

I used this recipe as a starter one. I made a few changes..... like using whole wheat flour and soy milk.  Also, added to the slow cooker at the last 45 minutes.

Tried these for the first time tonight.  I did use the 1/2 tsp salt, but otherwise exactly is given.  They were easy, quick and full of flavor.  Really rounded out the chicken stew!!  Plan to make many more times!!!!!!!

Good Dumplings. Next time I will make them smaller. I did cut back on the salt and seasonings. I used them in my slow cooker. Cover and do NOT peek. Let them cook for the last 45 minutes of dish.

Best recipe ever. I added 3/4 tsp garlic powder, and 3/4 tsp parsley, 3/4 tsp oregano, 1 tsp sugar. and 1 more tablespoon of butter. It's absolutely the recipe I have been looking for.
Hint: if your liquid isn't hot enough when you drop them in, they will not keep their shape as well and no peeking for 15 minutes!!

These dumplings were delicious but I only gave 4 stars because I did have to cut all the seasoning/salt in half.  Thank you for the suggestion to do so because these would have been too overpowering otherwise.  With the above modification this is a great recipe which my family and I will enjoy again in the future.

these were delicious! I put them with slow cooker chicken & dumplings from this site (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-and-Dumplings/Detail.aspx) and they turned out great. I did follow the advice to just use 1/2tsp salt & they were very tasty!

Loved these.  There is a notation about the salt being to high and should only be about half.  Since I do not cook with salt did not and had not planned to add.  Did not miss it as the dried spices added the flavour that they needed.  Will be making again.

Delicious!  As per original poster I lowered salt to 1/4 tsp and that was fine.  I probably put 3/4 tsp of each of the herbs (tailoring to a child a bit) and substituted basil for parsley (personal preference).  They were so good.  The Kid loved them, said they tasted like stuffing, a high compliment.  

I mixed it up as directed, made 12 balls and dropped into my simmering stew.  I covered it with a lid and didn't peek for 15 minutes, although I had to turn the stew down because it was boiling over.  After 15 minutes the dumplings looked sorta like brains and I was kind of worried but they tasted great, had great texture and were cooked in the middle.  My husband kept saying, "I can't believe you boiled bread and it cooked in the middle!"  

Saving this recipe, the family wants these again.  Thanks!

These are wonderful.  I used less salt and spices to suit my childrens taste.  Turned out light and fluffy.  My dumpling recipe for beef stew and chicken and dumplings.  Have used buttermilk because I had to use it up.  Really yummy too.  Thanks for your recipe.

This was my first attempt at dumplings and they turned out perfectly. The only seasoning I used less of was the salt and this worked for me because the soup I used these with had little seasoning (it was the only reason I didn't scale back on everything else).  Good recipe, thanks!

The flavor of these were great. However, they were mushy. I flollowed the directions exactly, so I am not sure what happened. They were fluffy, but soggy. I was expecting a dryer center in them. I may try them again. I'm not sure.

These are very good dumplings. I recommend less salt and longer cooking time. I allow my dumplings to cook for about 25 minutes for my dumplings to be more like biscuits.

These dumplings are right at the midway point between too fluffy and too dense.  They are fluffy, but have a good chewy texture without being undercooked.  They get four stars only because the oregano needs to be cut by a little. I like my flavors bold so at first I ignored the posters who said it was too much, but they were right. Next time I'm going to try them with different spices and see what flavor options I can create. Excellent dumpling recipe!

These are the best dumplings!  They can be too salty so you may want to reduce the salt but, they cook perfectly (if you don't lift the lid) and are never gummy.  I have made these dumplings at least a dozen times.  Absolutely delicious!

I paid heed to other posters (and Ronna) and though I needed to double the recipe I did not double the amount of herbs.   The dumplings were outstanding.   Thanks for the post, the recipe is a keeper.

These were delish-light and fluffy!! I also cut back on the salt and oregano, and I used fresh thyme and parsley. Mine looked jud like the pic (except I cooked in my slow cooker with beef stew).If your making dumplings, listen to the other reviewers and DO NOT open the lid for at least 12-15 mins!

Perfectly awesome!  I made these to go in the Beef Stew with Dumplings recipe on this site, and it was SO GOOD!  To be fair, I never actually measure spices when adding them to recipes, I just shake 'em in, 'cuz I know how much I usually like.  Biggest thing to remember when cooking the dumplings in a soup or stew... do NOT uncover the pot for at least 12 minutes after adding the dumplings - or they'll be gooey and gross.

Nice, but the herbs are a bit too overpowering as another poster mentioned. After all, there's only 1-1/2 cups flour and dried herbs are strong. I have a secret for making fluffy, non-soggy dumplings that I learned from a recipe from the old Lawrence Welk resort: Steam the dumplings first! They are divine and not soggy, slimy or sticky on the outside. I use a parchment paper-lined steamer basket over simmering water. Drop by teaspoonfuls, cover and steam for 10 minutes. Then, I add to the soup or stew. Wonderful. But I do like this recipe for its use of leavening that helps the fluff.

This is the second time we have tried this recipe,and it has been fantastic both times!  The first time I added a small bit of fresh basil, and I substituted fresh herbs for the dried ones. Fantastic. If using fresh herbs, you'll obviousy have to adjust the quantitites to avoid "over-seasoning". Thanks for the easy, great recipe.  Highly recommended.

I thought the flavor was fine, my only problem was I thought the dumplings were too fluffy. Those who love dumplings to fall apart in your mouth they are so light, would love them. I on the other hand like a dense dumpling, so I probably wont make them again using this recipe.

Dumplings turned out very light and fluffy. Found the herbs to be overpowering. Will cut them in half next time I make them (including the salt). Very simple ingredients and quick & easy to make. Thank you for this recipe.

They swell up pretty good. I 1-1/2 times the recipe, and my pot was filled enough I had to change to a bigger pot. I think one recipe would have been enough even for my 7 hungry mouths. I will likely use it again.

I didn't cut back on anything, as a matter of fact I added garlic powder and added a little more of the other seasonings.  We all loved it including the picky 20 year old.

Good with or without the herbs.  I use liquid oil in place of the butter to make it easier without problems.  Good with any soup or stew!

Very easy and delish! Changed some of the seasons to accommodate what I had available at home and it worked very well. Will make again:)

This is the basic dumpling recipe I got from my mom without the herbs.  It is 5-stars just "plain"; I'm sure the herbs add a whole other dimension.  I won't make beef stew without these.  And yes, cut the salt in half!

I threw these on top of a crock pot chicken and dumpling recipe instead of the standard dumplings, and my family raved about them.  Really, any combination of herbs will be delicious, just customize to compliment the flavors of the dish.

I gave this 4 stars cause I changed it a little and like it better than the original recipe or else I would have given it 5 stars...anyway I put parsley, oregano, summer savory, and basil...a half teaspoon each.  I also added a teaspoon of sugar because no matter what dumpling recipe I try it has to have that teaspoon of sugar...it`s just how my family has always made dumplings.  I must say it is now the only way I make dumplings now.  thank you very much for the great recipe because it led me to what I made, lol

Really enjoyed these. Even my son who hates dumplings finished them. I added to a beef in beer stew in a slow cooker. Left for an hour then quickly grilled to crisp up the tops. Thanks.

Nice fluffy dumplings add so much dimension to any stew!  These are very similar to what my grandmother called "feather" dumplings.

Awesome! I used half the salt, but kept everything else the same. I didnt think it was too seasoned at all, but I was looking for a very flavorful dumpling. I used the recipe for 6 servings, I would either cut back on that next time or make sure whatever I was making had more liquid. No matter what, this recipe is an absolute keeper!

This was my first attempt at making dumplings. My South African husband hadn't even heard of them. I added them to the beef stew and wow, they tasted just like the ones my mother use to make. I only added 1/2 quantities of herbs as suggested and that was sufficient. Well done to me on a successful first attempt and well done to the lady that submitted the recipe :-)

I followed the advice of others and cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  I felt the herbs were a tad overwhelming, and next time I will use half of each.  However, the fluffiness and texture of the dumplings was exactly what I was looking for.  I will make again, but with less salt and herbs.

Excellent! Used on the Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings recipe. Just spooned them on for the last 1/2 hr of cooking. Also, did half the herbs/salt and was still very flavorful. Wonderful.

awesome, I did not have thyme, or else I just have not found it yet since moving, so I used regular italian herb blend instead and the dumplings were terrific. I also make the dumplings in a seperate stock pot of boiling water so the left over soup does not turn all white.

I was looking for a dumpling recipe to go with my homemade turkey soup and this one filled the bill. I made the dumplings exactly as the recipe except I didn't have thyme, so I substituted it for sage. Yum!

I made these dumplings last night. We loved them! My daughter even asked for seconds (she NEVER does that). After reading the other reviews: As one reviewer suggested I used (1 heaping tbsp.) Italian Seasoning instead of the individual spices. After reading about them having too much spice and/or being too salty: I omitted the salt completely and doubled the flour mixture (I wanted left overs). I made these dumplings for chicken and dumplings and they were wonderful for that. I will definitely be making these for other things as well.

I love this recipe - although the dumplings always come out pinkish in color when cooked in chicken broth, the flavor is worth it. Salt, herbs... you've always got to adjust them to taste, and at a full tsp, we actually liked them... but when I make these for guests, I cut it down to the 1/4 to 1/2 that all agree is the right amount!  The dumplings seem to come out best if the "batter" is allowed to sit for a half hour or so, and the NO PEEKING WHILE COOKING rule should be followed.

My hubby n I just had these in chicken soup. Definitely will not make these again. I've made dumplings from my own recipe before and they came out lovely and just how I've had them in restaurants/other people's homes. Just thought I'd try someone else's recipe in case I've been doing it wrong all these years. Followed recipe to a tee but left the pot covered the entire cooking-time and reduced the salt as recommended in other reviews. Yet they ended up being the dumplings people have nightmares about - stodgy, gooey and mushed. Turned my yummy chicken broth into a thick, creamy gravy! There is no need for both baking powder and soda. In fact dumplings are ideally made with self-raising flour. The baking soda altered the taste of my soup and left a horrid taste in our mouths.

I adore this recipe.  I use them whenever I make a soup or stew, lately.  Super yum.  Also great with finely chopped fresh herbs, and I add sage if I'm doing a chicken soup.

Loved this recipe.  Reduced the salt per reviews.  I will play around with the herbs, based upon the type of soup I am making.  This is my new standby dumpling recipe.

These are so yummy! I did alter the herbs a bit and reduced the salt. They came out lite and fluffy and the kids loved them. Remember - NO PEAKING - or they will not come out right.

I thought this was a great dumpling recipe, though it called for too many herbs for my taste.  I reduced them by half.  The amount of salt was perfect.  They cooked thoroughly and were light and fluffy.

Really good dumplings. They puffed up nicely in my slow cooker and had just the right amount of herb flavour. Served them with Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings.

These were very tasty - especially paired up with Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings, as I did).  The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is that, following other's advice, I did significantly reduce the amount of seasonings.  I halfed them but next time, might even go a bit less on them (except the salt - that seemed appropriate at just halfed).  Overall though, I was amazingly impressed with this recipe - and myself, being the first time I've ever made homemade dumplings.

My family could not eat these. I followed the recipe exactly, and used it in a tomatoe soup that had similar spices and nobody could eat them.

Yeah these are pretty good.  I used water instead of milk, worked out fine.  I liked the fluffiness of these versus dumplings I've tried in the past, but I am still searching for the perfect dumpling recipe.

They were delicious! Used our empire apples from the backyard tree! Next time I will thicken the sauce a little more and put less filling in each turnover so they don't ooze as much. But they were very easy and tasty

Delicious. Substituted coconut oil for butter, and plain, full fat yogurt for milk. Added granulated garlic for a little extra flavour. Will be making again and again.

Adapted to gluten free blend, plus turmeric, using 1 egg + water, into a Turkey lentil soup, and dumplings were delicious,  not too hard nor soft, cooking up in 20 minutes ( 10 uncovered, 10 covered)

I reduced herbs, salt, and baking powder (high altitude). Remember, tightly close the lid. Put a towel between the lid and pot to keep condensation from dropping on them (thanks Cook’s Illustrated!). Add 10-15 min coming time for high altitude. I’m just over 5,000 ft. Very good savory dumplings. You can play w the liquid, use water, broth, milk, buttermilk. They’re still delish!

Great recipe! For liquid, I used 1 beaten egg and enough milk to equal 3/4 cup. Kneaded a few times on a floured surface, then let rest for 5 minutes. Rolled out to 1/8" thickness and cut into rectangles with a pizza cutter. I let them dry for one hour, then added to my soup. Perfect and tastes great.

im not a dumpling person. Only because i have tried them in the past and always failed, but tonight I added this recipe to my beef stew and i loved them. i made some changes as suggested by reviewers- cut down the salt by half, 1c buttermilk instead of the 3/4C of milk. They turned out so airy and light and not too salty but full of flavor. Going to be adding this to my soups and stews regularly now. They double in size when cooked so be aware not to crowd the pot TOO much. Thank you for the recipe!

Loved this recipe! This was my first attempt at dumplings, and they came out great. I took the advice from others and did 1/4tsp salt and halved all of the seasonings as well. I also switched parsley for rosemary. Very fast and easy!

I didn't have any parsley, but did add a "garlic lovers" seasoning mix instead which had some parsley in it. I should have read the reviews like I usually do and I would have definitely cut back on the thyme and oregano! My kids loved them as is, I thought the herbs were overpowering. Also had to cook/steam the dumplings twice as long (I think I scooped them too big!) very easy recipe and will make again (with 1/2 the  seasonings!)

Cut the herbs and salt by half lest ye are a-salted and over herbed. I failed to heed the advise of others an paid the price. Also, I think fresh parsley works better. We always have some laying around for the household bunnies. And no, we don't make Hossenpfeffer in our home.

We just finished a dinner of bison top sirloin roasted with sweet and russet potatoes, carrots, onion, and this recipe of savory dumplings. They worked up easily and tasted great except a little too much salt, as another reviewer mentioned.  My hubs didn't say anything negative about it but I thought so. I would be happy to make this again with a third less salt.

Thanks for all the great reviews over the years. Yes, just 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of salt needed. I don't know why the site won't let me edit my own recipe after a mis-print.

The taste was fine, but I followed the recipe exactly and the 'dumplings' were completely dissolved at the fifteen minute mark. There was no stirring or disturbing the pot once the lid went on, so not really sure what went wrong.

I followed Andrea W's advice about the herbs & spices and I must say, the dumplings were a hit!  Very tasty.  I will keep this in my recipe box.

I have made this recipe several times. It has always been amazing, fast and easy. I substitute coconut oil for the butter and have had zero taste or consistency issues. They are always light and fluffy and delicious.

I will never make another dumpling for soup. I've found my forever recipe.

I too have added these to a crockpot of beef or chicken stew - delicious! As there are only 2 of us I halve the recipe. When I make a stew, most of it gets frozen for future meals and  DH always insists on dumplings when I reheat in the oven. Tonight I'm making the dumplings with just lots of fresh parsley instead of other herbs for a change. Thanks for this great recipe - it never fails.

Perfect dumplings, no changes needed. We made these to go with my fiancé's beef barley soup, and they hit the spot. I'll use this as my go to dumpling recipe from now on.

Loved this recipe! I didn't have the herbs on hand so I replaced it with 3/4 teaspoon of garlic salt. Tasted great and wasn't bland at all. I liked how it thickened up my chicken soup too.

Very good, but a little to seasoned for me.  Next time I am cutting the oregano to maybe 1/4 and I followed suggestions of cutting the salt in half.  Very good though.

Delicious in "Hearty Turkey Soup".   Used up leftover turkey, added these, and it was just like Mom used to make.

A really good variation is to add a half cup or so (adjust to taste) of cheddar or  any cheese of your choice.  My favorite is cheddar and pepper jack.

True confession time...I made these this afternoon because my husband forgot to buy the Rhemes frozen dumplings at the store this morning. (Oh the shame!)  I followed the directions except I noticed pretty quickly I had only Oregano on hand in my understocked spice cabinet.  (Again with the shame, lol.)  I did have an Herbes de Provence Blend on hand and since it mostly had the same stuff, I subbed around 3 tbsps of it. I have never made dumplings before and wasn't aware of the "no peeking rule" but luckily my crockpot has a clear lid and I didn't peek enough to upset it too much.  This is how we learn, haha! My results weren't pretty as a picture but the flavor was very good.  I set the timer for 30 minutes and at that time, I took the lid off and stirred it gently to break them up a bit.  Some of the dumplings denigrated completely but I like a thicker soup so it worked out.  This is a very fluffy dumpling, as others have said, very bread or stuffing-like.  I have never had a dumpling like these before, I am used to a more dense texture.  Still, an easy recipe, flavorful results and a fun Sunday experiment.  Thanks for sharing!

Best dumplings ever.  I used 1/4 tsp salt, but will decrease thyme next time just due to personal preference.  Otherwise, yummy, fluffy, and packed with flavor.  This will replace recipe I have used for years.

I used entirely different herbs, but followed the rest of the ingredients almost exactly.I also made the mistake of putting the dumplings in to o small of a pot, and had to transfer them halfway through cooking, into a bigger pot.
They came out a little dense, but I think it's the pot issue.
I used my kitchen aid mixer to mix everything up.
I'll be using this recipe next time. Thanks!

Delicious! I wanted to make dumplings and panicked upon realizing I had no bisquick! It's the only way I have ever made dumplings.  Now I may never need bisquick again! All recipes you have done it again! I had no milk so I used water and they turned out just fine. I did cut the salt as suggested but for me the herbs were just fun be!  I will use th his recipe again!!

I halved the salt and thyme and added half a teaspoon of basil. I like my dumplings herby. The flavor was awesome. Be careful not to cook for too long or the dumplings will dissolve; they add flavor and thickness to the broth if they dissolve, though.

I've used this recipe a few times-- it's fantastic! 
I make it with "chicken and dumplings II" from allrecipes.com.

I accidentally used 3 teaspoons instead of 3 tablespoons tonight and it still turned out great! This is a keeper.

I love the basis for this recipe. I didnt add thyme.  Instead I added basil, parmesan and chopped spinach. My "stew" was a homemade pasta sauce. Soooo good. Thank you.

Very good and easy. We made this recipe gluten free for my sons girlfriend with her special flour bought on line at Meisters Gluten Free Flour cup for cup. She added 2 tsp of xantham powder, and increased the baking powder to 3 tsp. Usually a gluten free product is a little grainier. These were very tasty. We both saved the recipe. In both forms.

Very Good Dumplings!  I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp. per the reviews and these were great!  Perfect compliment to my slow cooker chicken.

This was my 1st time making dumplings.  I was very pleased with the outcome.  I cut the recipe to yield 4 servings.  I put in 1/4 t salt and 1/2 t ground thyme.  Everything else was the same per the yield. They were cooked over turkey stew.  Delicious!

While these tasted good, there was something wrong with the consistency.  They were almost too fluffy, and pretty much dissoved in your mouth.  I will keep looking.

I made these with the herbs halfed down and salt paired down as well. I put them in the slowcooker with my chicken stew and they were a doughy dense mass..More like a dough tumor than a fluffy delightful dumpling. Maybe they aren't fit for slowcookers. I have to give 4 stars for ease and taste..if they came out nicer they'd definitely be 5 stars!

These had GREAT flavor! As everyone before me I cut the salt and herbs to 1/2 tsp, awesome. The only disappointment is they are not as sturdy as bisquick dumplings, tend to be alittle to delicate, other than that they are perfect!

Good, but I did not use enough liquid and the pot I dropped the dumplings into was too small so it turned out like a biscuit topped stew.  Husband and son were very impressed and liked the accidental results a lot.

These dumplings are spectacular, even better than those I had growing up. The herb spice mixture makes the flavor pop, though in the future I will modify the spice mixture to suit our taste; the oregano in particular was a bit strong. I might reduce the thyme a little too. Spectacular recipe.  FOLLOW UP NOTE: I prepared this for the second time, reducing the thyme, oregano, and dried parsley by 1/4, which for us was the perfect level of "herbed flavor." One final note: I used one part water and one part chicken broth in which to cook the dumplings, which leaves a wonderfully rich broth when the dumplings are gone, to which I added some canned chicken and frozen peas to make a deliciously rich soup for later.

Very good dumplings. I was looking for a dumpling that didn't require stale bread and this one worked just fine. The spices add a lot of flavor to the dumplings so I might leave them out next time. Not that the flavor was bad, I just want to vary the recipe.

I'm a British girl living in the USA, so I needed a substitute dumpling recipe for one of my stews since I can't get suet over here.

This one looked ideal! I halved the salt as per some of the other comments, and I didn't make them as liquid as the recipe suggested, but rather rolled them into sticky balls and placed them in the top of my stew.

They became GINORMOUS! I couldn't believe how much they swelled up - at least three times their original size! This wasn't really a problem though, as they tasted great. If I was going to make them again, I'd cut down on the amount of herbs - they were too herby for my tastes and I didn't even include the parsley as I didn't have any. I would also probably halve the recipe to make fewer, smaller dumplings.

Will make it again with adjustments!

These are SO good and really easy to make.  Good thing I read about using less salt.  I used the herbs in their original quantities and thought it was fine.  Think I'll make the dumplings a bit smaller next time as they swell up pretty big in the stew...but that's just my preference.

These really thickened my chicken veg. soup.  They had good flavor, but I wanted something that held together a little bit better. I started with a soup and ended up with a stew.  Which isn't a bad thing, It's been so cold outside.  I usually use refrigerated buttermilk biscuits cut into quarters for dumplings in my stews and soups. I will keep trying.  It would be nice to put "from scratch" dumplings in my homemade soups and stews, just haven't found the right one yet.

Best dumplings I've ever had, or made, and super easy. Very light and tender. Not at all too salty for our taste. I do use kosher salt, wonder if that made a difference compared to those who thought it was too salty.

Whoa -- were these ever salty.  I think you would have to have a very specific taste to like these.  People found them a little unappealing.  Will probably not make again.

These were just "okay" for me. They didn't cook up as fluffy as I would have liked, and they actually seemed to melt into the soup quite a bit before attaining a solid state. Fortunately I made them about double the suggested size, otherwise there wouldn't have been any dumpling left to taste. I don't think I will use this recipe again, but they did taste nice.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and the dumplings dissolved into the chicken and dumplings that I made for DH!  I use the "stir, scoop, level" method of measuring my flour and the dough came out very wet.  I checked a couple of other recipes I have for dumplings and they call for more flour.  These dumplings made a nice thickener for the stew... and since I always make a big pot, I made ANOTHER batch of dumplings (my normal recipe) and added them to the leftovers the next night.  Worked out just fine, so all was not lost.  Just be sure that your dough is fairly thick, not wet... and, I usually use shortening, not butter, so the butter made have added to my problem with this recipe.  Thanks anyway... the flavor was good and I didn't find it too salty.

I thought these had a very good flavor.  They went into a chicken soup with peas, carrots, potatoes and mushrooms.  I also omitted the salt.  YuMMM
