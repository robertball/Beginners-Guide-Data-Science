This zucchini bread is the BEST ever!!  I always get requests for this whenever I make it!  It is very moist. We spread it with either butter or cream cheese, or just eat it plain. I always try to keep a bag of shredded zucchini in the freezer at all times, so I can make this whenever I want, not just in the summer!

yummy recipe; here are the changes i made: 1/2 the sugar, whole milk yogurt for the sour cream, and 1/2 ww flour.  skipped the nuts and added choc chips (12 oz). made muffins instead of bread and baked for 30 min. Very tasty- a keeper. (i will add the nuts next time too).

This recipe is perfect!!! I made it this summer omiting nuts and it bakes as expected and keeps/freezes well. It has a very mild and sweet flavor, that is not overpowered by the cinnamon of other recipes. I have even made this substituting apple sauce as well and has turned out just at good. Make it into mini muffins for tiny treats for the tots...they love them and don't know it's a vegetable!Thanks Lew for a keeper :-)))

Great bread. I have made it several times, with great results. I have been adding about a cup of chocolate chips, 1 tbsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tbsp. nutmeg, and 1 tsp. allspice. Also, it is a little bit oily - very moist, but oily - and so I may try subbing some applesauce and cutting back on the oil. I also use fat-free sour cream - works great!

I love it when the reviews on a recipe don't even bother w/ additions because it's so good.  This was that good.  And yes I added some spice based on what I like.  But the texture was what made it so incredible.  Fabulous recipe!  BTW, I also used it to make mini-muffins.  They're like little bites of heaven.  Thanks for the recipe!

Everybody compliments me on how moist this bread is. This is one of my favorites. I add a little extra zucchini and sour cream.

We thought this was good, but we've had better zucchini bread. I won't be making this again. I will try another recipe from this sight. Sorry!

Finally... I found a zucchini bread I like!  I was overloaded with zucchini this year, and have tried 3 other recipes before this one.  The others were too dense (almost spongey) and way too cinnamon-y for my tastes.  Although I did add about a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and allspice to this recipe give it a hint of flavor... it was just right, not overpowering at all.  The second time I made it I added a 1/2 cup of chopped apples... Delicious!  I also drain my zucchini... I don't squeeze it out, I just let it drain in a colander while I prepare the recipe.  It still comes out super moist and delicious!

This is a very moist and tasty bread.  I added 3 teaspoons of cinnamon and substituted yogurt for the sour cream (it cuts down on the fat, plus I always have a container of yogurt on hand).  I will save this recipe and make it again!  Thanks, Lew!

Easy, simple & delicious...the sour cream adds great flavor. Great recipe for those who don't like cinnamon, as most Zucchini bread recipes have spices.  My husband loved this...better than all other recipes, even tho' it's so simple.

This is a great recipe.  The sour cream adds just the right touch.  It freezes wonderfully.  I have made 12 loaves so far this year and they are gone!!  Very moist, just the right sweetness.

This is absolutely wonderful!  I made mine with frozen shredded zucchini leftover from last summer's harvest.  It was moist and tasty.  Will definitely make this one again.

Yum!  I always use this recipe because it turns out nice and moist.  I like my bread with a little spice though, so I add a teaspoon or so of pumpkin pie spice, or just cinnamon and ground cloves, whichever i have on hand to the flour. Great recipe!!

I used Greek Yogurt in place of the sour cream and used cinnamon applesauce for half of the oil.  Also added a healthy dash of cinnamon to it!  I made 1 loaf and 7 jumbo muffins!  My 2yr old loves them!!!

Excellent recipe.  Like other reviewers recommended I subbed applesauce for half the oil and I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  No walnuts due to personal preferences.  Freezes great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I had never made zucchini bread before and this is fantastic.  I do substitute applesauce for oil and I add cinnamon (sometimes even chocolate chips).  This is a fantastic recipe and I highly recommend it!

Baked up beautifully--lovely texture--but a tad bland.  I will definitely use this recipe again, but will add some cinnamon and maybe a bit of cloves.

This is wonderful bread.  My husband described it as "outstanding!"  I used whole wheat flour and added the grated peel of one lemon.  We enjoyed the bread toasted for breakfast with a spread of cream cheese - yum!

This is very moist. I baked 1 loaf just as written (without the walnuts as a friend is allergic and to the other I added 2t cinnamon, 1/2 c walnuts and 1/2 c golden raisins. We like both of them- the one with the additions is a little more popular in our home. I have added this recipe into my handwritten recipe book and that means this is my new "keeper". Thanks Lew!

Eureka!  I have found it!  This is the one zucchini  bread recipe that I am finally happy with (and so is my husband) -- easy to fix, moist, and it lends itself to little additions (I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and a few raisins)  You easily have two large loaves - one to keep and one to give away - although we kept both of ours!!  Thanks for a great submission.

i started cooking this recipe only to find that i had only half the flour, so i winged it, halfing certain ingredients, and turned out with a still marvelous zucchini bread. i had it ready for my family in the morning, it made a wonderful breadkfast, and a spread of butter makes this sweet simple delight a shining beacon of culinary perfection.

The best zucchini bread I have ever made.  I think it was the sour cream.  I used 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups of white flour, which added just a bit more flavor.  This one is a keeper!

Very moist & delicious. I was out of sour cream, so I put 1 cup cottage cheese, 1 Tablespoon lemon juice, & 2 Tablespoons of milk in a processor(you can use a blender too) and blend until smooth = 1Cup sour cream substitution. I shredded 1 & 1/2 thick zucchinis  and squeezed out most of the extra water from it before adding to the batter and I used a whole 6oz bag of chopped walnuts(publix brand). It measures to about 1 1/4c so I figured "why not?". StayAtHomeNation.blogspot.com

this recipe is really excellent.  i used whole wheat pastry flour, a little less sugar and oil than called for, and used non fat plain yogurt instead of the sour cream.  the texture is perfect and flavor is delicious.  i am keeping this recipe and will share it as well.

I lost my old recipe for zucchini bread and have been searching for a new one. I have found that many of the recipies are basically the same but the sour cream in this one makes it very moist with a wonderful texture. I am, however, used to a much darker bread  ( I think my old recipe called for brown sugar and cinnamon ), so if you're you like a spicier bread I highly recommend adding cinnamon. I added almost a tablespoon & found it could have used more( obviously, everyone's taste will be different). Otherwise, this recipe is excellent and I will continue to use it. Thanks!

The only change I made was to throw in a handful of raisins and a bit of cinnamon.  This was the best zucchini bread.  I made one large loaf and a pan of the individual loaves.  They baked for about 30 minutes and were done perfectly.  This will be the recipe I use from now on.  Thanks.

Heck Yeah!  This is great zucchini bread --  moist, sweet, and downright delicious!  It's a crowd pleaser for sure and from now on, it's the only zucchini bread I'll make.  Tonight I'm making my 3rd batch in as many days.  Everyone loves it and can't get enough -- good thing my garden is overflowing with zukes!

Loved this!  Super moist.  It was fantastic, and, I didn't change a thing about the recipe, except for not using nuts, because I don't like them in breads.  I did use one glass loaf pan and one metal one, because that's all I have.  Just note that, if you are using a metal loaf pan, it takes about 10 minutes less than a glass one.

Very moist but way too sweet. My recommendation is to halve the sugar and add spices like the other reviewers suggested:-) also the batter was uneven if you add the wet ingredients to the dry per the recipe. Dry should be added to wet.

I've actually made this a few times. I subbed out 1/2 c of brown sugar as well since I was low on reg sugar. I made it in my mini loaf pan which makes 8 loaves. It took just over 30 mins to cook instead of the hour. It tastes so awesome though!

This recipe had good taste, but not what you'd expect of a good and real zuchinni bread. It was missing the cinnamon and nutmeg I like, and the texture was much too light, fluffy and airy (for my personal  taste). When I make zucchini bread I like the loaf to be moist (like this bread), but also dense enough enough so it wont fall apart as I cut.
Maybe not sifting the flour would help?!!

This was a very moist and delicious bread recipe. I shredded too much zucchini so I had 3 cups instead of two so I doubled the walnuts to 2 cups also. I put them into three Bread loaf pans in case of overflow With the extra zucchini and walnuts. It cooked in less time because there was less batter in each pan but I kept an eye on it and it worked out perfectly. I will definitely make this again

I followed the recipe with no exceptions.  I baked for 60 minutes and it was overdone.  The taste was yummy, but the bread was dry.  I'll make again, but I'll tweak it a bit to see if I can get a better result.

I made no changes.    But the cook time is too long.  I may try it again as it was easy to make but bake it for less time.

Baked this in a 9x13; it only needed an hour, not the prescribed 80 minutes. Great texture, very soft and moist but still airy. I went ahead and added a teaspoon each of ground cinnamon and nutmeg, if I make this again— the only reason it's an 'if' is because shredding zucchini is so much work!— I'll probably up the amount of spice and cut the sugar. Looking forward to having this at breakfast tomorrow!

Thanks for the great zucchini bread recipe! The only change I made was that I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I had it in the oven baking before I read some reviews and I grabbed some strussel topping that I keep pre-made in the freezer and sprinkled some on top of each loaf... fantastic! It adds a nice little crunch. :)

I made this with coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and it was fabulous! Everyone raved about the first loaf and when I served the defrosted second loaf, I got the same reaction! Thanks for the recipe!

This zucchini bread is the best I have ever made.. Even better than my Moms bread. I made six loaves and they freeze great. All my family loved it. I did add 2 tsps. Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. Of nutmeg, and a little extra vanilla. Otherwise as the recipe states.

Really delicious, rich taste and so moist! Perfect with a cap of morning coffee- we love it just as is, plane. 
I made with with frozen zucchini- thawed it and rolled just a couple of times in my kitchen chopper to reduce size of the pieces. 
Thank you for the recipe, it is simple in making, but just perfect in result.

I was looking for a zucchini bread recipe with sour cream, since favorite banana bread recipe calls for it.  This was perfect!  I did toast the walnuts and added cinnamon, but made no other changes & loved it!

This recipe is fantastic!  Due to being out of oil, I used melted butter instead and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon just because.   I'll be freezing grated zucchini so we can enjoy this all winter.  Thanks south for sharing!

This recipe turned out awesome. I made a few changes to lighten it up. I made only half a recipe and used 1/4 cup oil, 1 egg and 1 egg white, and added a little extra zucchini. I upped the baking powder to 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and used only 3/4 cup sugar. Oh and I used a cup of blueberries in place of nuts. I guess it was a lot of changes but it came out delicious. I'm sure it's amazing as is but I'm just trying to cut calories. Will definitely make this again.

Very moist and delicious! You can't go wrong with this recipe. I made this recipe as is only substituting real butter in place of the oil. I left out the nuts this time but will be making this again many more times to use up some zucchini and will be adding nuts on occasion. Another plus is that this bread freezes well.  Cook time/oven temp was spot on. I do recommend this recipe.

This is a good recipe. I didn't butter and flour my pans and yes the bottom stuck.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon which I think it really needed.  I would use two 8 x 4 pans next time for a little taller loaf. Thanks for a nice recipe, everyone enjoyed it.

Just made this.  Followed recipe exactly.  Almost no flavor, in my opinion.  Should have had some cinnamon at least.  I've never made zucchini bread before so i don't have a comparison in terms of baking it, but I've eaten much more flavorful ones.

Very good!  I chose this recipe because the sour cream interested me.  Added chocolate chips to one loaf.  It was very good.  My daughter ate it even though she had previously announced she didn't like zucchini bread.

This is a very good moist zucchini bread. A little to sweet for me so the next time I make it, I will reduce the sugar to maybe 1 1/2 cups. I am not a fan of nuts in bread but I did use whole flax seed in place of nuts.

Nice recipe.  I made one large loaf and 8 miniatures, baking the miniatures for 35 minutes.  I tried to freeze the bread but alas, my best friend went home with the miniatures and my son's girlfriend went home with the large loaf.  So it's off to the kitchen I go.  Oh, I also added chocolate chips to the large loaf and even the batter tasted good.

I gave this recipie 4 stars because I had to make a few adjustments but after I did its fantastic and I wont be trying any others. Also, I have no idea what it meant to add sour cream alternately so after beating the egg/sugar mixture, I add the sour cream to that, just barely blend it, then add it all to the flour mixture and blend until just mixed. I only have an egg beater not a fancy mixer, not sure what everyone else uses.

My changes: 2 1/2c of whole white wheat flour, 1 tsp of baking powder instead of 1/2, 1 c applesauce instead of oil, and I also add 1 tsp of cinnamon.

Our family has been searching for a great zucchini bread recipe and now we've found it! tastes lighter than most store-bought zucchini bread and the hard layer on the outside gives it an interesting and unique crunch. Definitely making it again!

I didn't substitute anything and it turned out so yummy! The texture is light and crunchy on the outside like its suppose to be and super moist on the inside! Delicious! This recipe goes to my fav. Taste was right on but I remember my grandma's zucchini bread had spices in it so next time only for memories and not because this recipe by any means needs any added flavor-  but I may try adding a few spices just like grandma use to. Thank you Allrecipe.

I have to give 5 stars because everyone loved this recipe with these changes: 1 cup shredded zucchini, 1 cup shredded apple (Macintosh), used 1 cup organic non-gmo canola oil, used 1 cup pecans.  Great with vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe, I added chocolate chips to one batch and cinnamon to another, it turns out very moist, be sure not to under cook it or else you'll have a soggy bottom. I have made 4 loaves in 1 week and tomorrow I will make 2 more. We just love it.

This is the best zuccini bread recipe I have ever tried.  I was uneasy with the color of the mixture when I added the sour cream, but was VERY pleasantly surprised at how moist it was when cooked and the bread was a very nice even light brown color.  Everyone LOVED it!!!  I added a heaping 2 cups of zuccini. This was also very simple to make.  Good recipe to use for oversized zuccini from my garden.

This was awesome... I'm not a very good at cooking, but we went to an orchard and got some zucchini, and this recipe was so easy and super yummy.  I did not  do the pan, I did muffins...  Love it...

I used 1/2 cup applesauce with 1/2 cup oil, used chocolate chips instead of walnuts. I made muffins and 2 mini loaves, baked them for 30 minutes.  Very good!

I had leftover sour cream and a boatload of zucchini, so this recipe was just what I was looking for. The only things I changed was to add a couple dashes of cinnamon. If I make this in the future, I'd add a bit more baking powder and some more spices (mainly some cinnamon and cloves, perhaps).

Outstanding recipe. I used this recipe yesterday, making two loaves of zucchini bread and it came out delicious. Thank you. I have saved this in my recipes for future use.
