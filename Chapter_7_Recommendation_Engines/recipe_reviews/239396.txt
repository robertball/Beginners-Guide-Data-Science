Could not wait to try this as I love wings.  The sauce is easy to whip up and I marinaded the wings overnight. I really like the sauce and will no doubt use this sauce over chicken pieces in the oven for BBQ chicken indoors.  As for wings, I would use it again but with 2 improvements. When I turned them at halfpoint I had to resauce the skin side. If cooking indoors I feel they would be better on a rack over a pan, especially at the end when broiling them for crispness.  The other thing is I would cook them on the grill rather than in the oven to help hold the sauce on the wings.  Sauce leans toward sweet which is good on the wings but I would use bluecheese or ranch for dipping. Tasty!

Very good sauce. I added brown sugar since I like sweet/spicy flavors.

Made these on the grill after marinating over night and they were awesome. My husband said we have to have them again for the first Steelers game of the season.

I was very disappointed. I was looking for a sweet, spicy, smoky flavor and a could barely taste it.
I substituted legs for wings and baked in the oven per directions. They looked good, but since this was the first time I've made this, I tried one without the dip...bland.  Then one with the dip...ketchup!  So I threw the dip out and went back to my stand by, Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.   Much better.
I don't know if grilling would make much of a difference.
