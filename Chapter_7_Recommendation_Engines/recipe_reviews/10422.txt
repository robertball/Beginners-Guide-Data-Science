definitely good, but not sweet enough. i also took out the hard-boiled eggs - im sure this'd be tough to mix with any more dry ingredients - and instead added one regular full egg. i also didnt base the outside with egg. the dough comes out nice and soft, and tastes good - just i'd recommend adding some white sugar to it, maybe in place of some of the flour or just in addition, because these need some more flavor to get 5 stars. but they werent too much of a hassle to do.

I thought the taste was VERY good, but mine didn't turn out very pretty.  I did eliminate the egg yolks, a little too strange for me.  I also ended up eliminating the egg wash after the first batch because I didn't like the look of the egg wash.  I think I'll glaze them with white icing to improve the look.

Makes such a lovely cookie. I omitted the hard-boiled egg yolks and the final egg wash for a cookie that was a little more on the shortbread-side.

They looked good for Valentine's, I wish they tasted as good. They definitely needed something more, I just couldn't figure out what. I already added double the sugar since most reviewers seemed to suggest that, it did become sweet enough but it has to have something else. I wouldn't try it out again.

This dough was impossible! I followed the recipe exactly. It was really crumbley before I put it in the fridge. It was rock hard 2 hours later. I don't know how to salvage this.

Did I do something wrong? I have two criticisms to offer:  1) the dough was impossible to work with (cracked and crumbled when I tried to roll it) and 2) the dough was not sweet enough for my tastes.  I was not able to try a finished cookie as I could not get the dough rolled out.  I did love the raspberry heart idea, but with a different cookie recipe.

I have used white sugar instead of brown and it turned perfect. I will try next with brown sugar which I usually use and see how it tastes, but in my opinion either one works.
