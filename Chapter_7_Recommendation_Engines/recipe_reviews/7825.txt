Absolutely perfect and exactly how I remember it from my childhood.  I used orange juice instead of liqueur and it turned out just fine.  It *will* be lumpy at first - just hang in there!  Add the liqueur (or juice) to the butter and sugar and keep beating it; it will smooth out and then you can add the orange zest.

It was really crumbly after adding the GM - not at all spreadable.  I had to add approx 4T of milk to get it to spreading consistency.  The final product was tasty, but I have other icing recipes I prefer.

I used orange to replace the liqueur. The flavour of the frosting is very good. A few of the reviewers said the frosting was dry. But I have made this frosting many times already, as a filling for the Williamsburg Orange Cake (also from this website) and as a frosting for cupcakes (same cake recipe). As a filling it is great. Used as a frosting for a cake or cupcakes, I find it a bit soft. Perhaps it has to do with my hot and humid tropical climate - I live in Malaysia. But I will continue to use it because it smells and tastes great, and it's refreshingly different from the usual buttercream frosting. I just put the cake with the frosting in the fridge to set overnight before taking it anywhere.

I added some orange oil to the recipe.  It makes a tangy frosting.

I can only suspect that those who found this frosting dry and crumbly, messed up big time. The half cup of softened butter will take all that sugar perfectly well, but you MUST let it keep going! It'll be a complete crumbly mess for a good while, and then suddenly it will all come together. At that point, add your three tablespoons of liquid and it will be perfectly spreadable. For added fluff and spread, use a whip attachment in a stand mixer and whip it for a few minutes.

I used Grand Marnier in my frosting and it was to die for! Better than when my mom made it when I was little, though of course, the liqueur makes all the difference.

Followed recipe EXACTLY and it was sooooooo dry--added 6 tbsp of whipping cream and it was still too dry!  Continued to add a couple tbsp more and beat constantly, but icing never became shiny and smooth and it was a waste of pricey Contreau!  Very disappointing...

Also used orange juice in place of liqueur. Twelve teaspoons of liquid did not work for my frosting (it was a dry day, though.) Used approximately 1/4 cup of orange juice. Was a bit grainy (never became shiny even after much creaming). Decent complement to chiffon cake, as stated on Lemon Chiffon Cake recipe, but still ENTIRELY too thick. Tore my poor cake to pieces!

Really excellent icing for the Chiffon Cake recipe. The only change to the icing was it needed a bit more liquid so after 12 tsp. of Cointreau I added a water until the consistency worked.

The beautiful Chiffon Cake turned out so good. The frosting recommended was the Williamsburg Butter Frosting. Oh boy, that was so very tasty. Thank you Carol for sharing. This made my day!

Flavor was delicious using Grand Marnier as the orange liquor.  My batch of frosting was slightly dry, but I think measuring out sifted powdered sugar might solve the problem.  As other reviewers stated, you have to beat the mixture for a while before it all of a sudden switches over from a crumbly mixture to actual frosting concistency.  I used this frosting on a traditional 2-layer cake.  Doubling the batch was way too much, but one batch probably isn't enough for frosting lovers.  I could see where this frosting would be evil good on a darker chocolate cake.  Tasty recipe!  Thanks for sharing.
