This was a very good sauce, I will definitely make it again.  I only used 1 tablespoon of garlic powder I thought Two would be too much.

Spicy and sweet and just the right amount of thickness.  I used some to marinate center, thick cut pork chops and used the rest to coat after grilling.  This recipe, made almost as listed (I added 1 T onion powder, but kept the rest of the listed ingredients the same), is going to be my go to recipe until I die.

Good recipe, different.  I could not see shaking all in a jar so I heated slowly on the stovetop.  Blended those flavors and allowed me to adjust to suit our bbq.  Will make again, thanks.

This turned out darker in color than other Carolina mustard sauces that I have eaten/made, but it is still delicious. As the recipe is written, it is very thick--almost like a paste. I added extra vinegar and mustard to thin it down a bit. I also added extra cayenne since we like spicy. Very good sauce!

I used smoked paprika - amazing!
Took the advice to cut to 1Tbs garlic powder and it is still very garlicky (and good)
Hits all the flavor notes for me - tangy, sweet and spicy (which you can dial up and down with the cayenne to your liking...my family is fairly wimpy so we just add a pinch).  So good!

SC is the birthplace of mustard-based BBQ sauce having likely been concocted by the Bessinger family in the 1930's in Holly Hill, SC.  Although there is some argument that the Sweatman family was making a similar sauce in that same timeframe. This is a pretty good general recipe for a mustard sauce. I still prefer our family's version, but if you make this one you'll find it both tasty and authentic. Enjoy

Sweet to start, then tangy and finally the spice brings up the rear to really give this sauce a good finish

Loved it....I followed the receipt exactly except I put all in saucepan and heated initially.  Very simple and a very tasty change to the tomato based bbq sauce I normally make.

I was not expecting to like this so much!  I was thinking it would taste just like a honey mustard sauce, but it doesn't!  The tang from the apple cider vinegar plus all the spices put's this over the top.  I basted my chicken with the sauce before grilling, and I had halved the recipe thinking this made a lot, but I wish I would have just made as is, because I didn't have anymore to baste while it was cooking.  Oh well, lesson learned.  Next time!!

This is delicious!  I left out the salt because of the sodium and only put a few dashes of cayenne, but this tastes wonderful.  I will definitely make this my go-to recipe for mustard based BBQ sauce!!

Quite tasty... it thickens up quite a bit overnight so do make it the night before
