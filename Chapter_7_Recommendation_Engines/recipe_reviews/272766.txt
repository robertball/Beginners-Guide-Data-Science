This was really good. My family loved it! I used green bell pepper instead of jalapeño because I didn't want it to be spicy. I also didn't use any salt because the bacon and feta are salty enough.

A great meal. A few changes due to pantry content but good non the less. Will do this again.

By the recipe, this is an outstanding flavor combination that all will enjoy and it's easy to prepare in advance and cook up, serving a crowd with little apparent effort!  

If you're concerned about too hot jalapeños, just remove the seeds...served this with asparagus and mashed potatoes, my mouth is watering just typing about it!  YUM!

I did not add the bread crumbs and used one 15 oz breast, otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Would certainly make again, ...and again!
