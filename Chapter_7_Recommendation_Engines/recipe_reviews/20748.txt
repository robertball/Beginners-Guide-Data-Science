This recipe is very lacking. The ramen seasoning gives it an unappetising artificial flavor. Try omitting the ramen seasoning and add some chicken stock, sherry, garlic, ginger and brown sugar to the sauce. You will be amazed.

Great recipe to break through the fear-barrier of oriental cooking.  I added fresh ginger and carrots; cut back on the chicken and soy sauce (way too much of both for my family).  With these minor changes this is destined to be a favorite in my house!!!

there's nothing bad to be said about this recipe, but it's not great either. It's rather like fried rice, only I've had much better recipes for fried rice. I would not bother with the flavor packet from the ramen, who needs the MSG?? you can't taste it anyways, the soy sauce is a much stronger taste (and better tasting, too). It is very quick and easy, even my picky 5 year old ate it, so it can't be bad. Try it with frozen stir fry veggies, if you don't have fresh.

This recipe was tastey.  

Some Issues:  The cook the rice should be first because that takes longer than stir frying. I was confused on whether or not I was supposed to add the broth from the Ramen into the Rice.  I did not because I thought it would be too soupy.  Next time I make it I will not add the rice and ooodles into the chicken and veggies.  I think that may have made the noodles smoochy.

It was still a big hit with the family.

I actually just skipped the ramen and just poured half the flavor packet straight into the rice, and it came out pretty good

I was surprised to see so many low reviews for this recipe because my entire family really liked this one. To me it seems like people are expecting restaurant quality stir-fry, which just looking at the ingredients indicates that won't be the case. It's a great dish that you can load full of veggies, and switch out anything that your family doesn't like. The flavor was good (despite what people say), and was very filling with both the rice and noodles. Thank you for the recipe, ANNIEM!

I thought it was good. The ramen made it more palletable for my picky eaters. My pickiest hated it but that is not suprising. She is not used to zucchini.
