Delicious! I toasted the bread under a grill for just a minute first.

As a vegetarian, this has been a staple for me at picnics for years now. I am so glad to see that someone else has thought of this too. I've gotten wierd looks for eating potato salad sandwiches, and now I know I'm not crazy.

My mother and aunt used to eat these all the time and I do too.I look forward to having leftover potato salad! Being purists we love it just spread on white bread with butter and extra salt and pepper.

Actually, this has been a quite popular sandwich at Japanese bakeries and cafes since I've been alive.  However, the Japanese potato salad is made slightly differently: Small chunks of apple are added, along with very thin carrot and onion slices.  Mayo only, and seasoned with pepper and sea salt.  YUM.

I like doing this too. Don't see the need to add extra mayo, though, since potato salad typically has enough mayo as it is. Also: this is NOT a good alternative to peanut butter and jelly if you're taking it on a picnic or car trip because potato salad grows bacteria really quickly. At the 2010 Boy Scouts of America Jamboree, in which my family participated, lots of boys and leaders got food poisoning from potato salad that wasn't kept properly cold. It can be really nasty really fast if you're not careful...

Don't laugh, but I make these everytime I have left over potato salad, which I did, so I ate one for my meatless Friday lunch.  I sub mustard for the mayo, because I feel the salad has enough mayo.  Great minds think alike, eh Jenny?

I'm pregnant & can't stand the thought of most meat so nearly everyday I try a different veggie sandwich for lunch. This was actually very good. I used a good wheat bread & added paprika

I've eaten potato salad sandwiches all my life and love them on a single piece of plain white bread (folded over) with an ice cold Dr. Pepper. My mom always used plain mashed potatoes (no chunks for us) with all the other ingredients. We still prefer her way of making mashed potato salad.

Loved these.  The only change I made was to add a slice of aged Swiss cheese and a hard, crusty roll.  Thank you, Jenny.

I really loved this!! I have so much potato salad leftover from Easter, I just had to give this a try. My salad is a very simple recipe using potatoes, mayo, mustard, relish, salt, pepper with a lot of hard boiled eggs. I skipped using the extra mayo because this has plenty. I really love the tomato with this, it's great. I will definitely make this sandwich again, as I always make too much potato salad during the summer months. Funny thing is, I used to see my Grandmother eat these all the time and never had the desire to try it. So glad I finally did, thanks :)

This was wonderful on a spring day! =) I added extra pickles and left out the tomato because we were out. Great on a whole grain wheat bread or even rolled up in lettuce. Thanks!

This was pretty good.  As per other suggestions I used mustard instead of mayonnaise (there was plenty of mayo in the potato salad) and also added cheese to the sandwich.  My only problem with it was that my potato salad was to fancy, and overpowered the other flavours.  I believe a plain potato and mayonnaise salad would work wonders in this sandwich.

This was pretty good, and a nice alternative at barbeques.  It's easy to throw together on those nights I really don't want to cook!  I skipped out on the mayo and used mustard instead.  A little pepper was good,too.

Well this was certainly different. I liked it okay, but I wouldn't make it again. I didn't care for the textures together. It wasn't bad at all,I guess I simply prefer my potato salad with a fork. Thanks for something new. I enjoyed trying a fun meal.

Made potato salad last night. Had never tried this before, but for some reason when I got up today I was craving a potato salad sandwich this morning! Absolutely delicious. I added a couple of dashes of Texas Pete and this was VERY satisfying!

I'm giving this four stars because I really didn't like the tomato on the sandwich, but my boyfriend loved it. So, it's a keeper! Great for lunch :) I used whole wheat buns and only one lettuce leaf on each because the leaves were so big. This sandwich does have good balance, but is a little messy so have a plate under you with a napkin close by!

you know, when i first read this i thought it was crazy and weird but decided to try it anyway... i used mustard potato salad on toasted sourdough bread and added cheddar cheese. it was sooooo good. i wish i had some of my mom's homemade potato salad to throw on there to make it that much better.

I've done this for years.  I don't like meat, and my family does, so this is a substitute for making a separate meal for myself.  It's also delicious.  Here in Pittsburgh it's acceptable to add coleslaw to your sandwich, but I get strange looks when I ask for a sandwich with JUST coleslaw, potato salad, or macaroni salad.  Glad I'm not the only one!

A tasty snack but not something I will crave always having potato salad in the house in order to have on hand.  If I have leftover salad, it is a easy, fun option.

Yes, yes,yes! I ate these as a kid and haven't thought about it for years. Thanks for reminding me about one of my favorite sandwiches! Mine were just potato salad on white bread, but a tomato slice and lettuce sounds really good, too. Any way to eat potato salad is a good way!

I made this today with the Baked Potato Salad. It's tasty. Instead of pickles, I paired this sandwich with jalepeno rings. I'll have to remember to make this sandwich with leftover potato salad. I think I'll add deli ham, too.

EDITED TO ADD: I made this for both my husband and I, only with deli ham. So yummy. I used the leftover Mashed Potato Salad I made a couple nights before.

Like the other reviewer, without even trying the recipe, why would you add mayo to a potato salad that already has mayo in it?  Sorry, potato salad belongs next to a REAL sandwich.

My 7 year son loved this sandwich, I served it hot off the stove and added jalapenos for hubby's sandwich. Five stars, will certainly make again. Next time I'm going to try ranch bacon dressing for added flavor and 1 boiled egg.

Love weird sandwiches (none of which I discovered until I was a vegetarian).  First tried a potato salad sandwich when that was the ONLY vegetarian option and I felt like a sandwich.  Yum.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it's pretty much eating potato salad on bread.  I guess if you don't have a fork this recipe would be great for you.

I used to make these when I was a child. My aunt makes the best potato salad. I put it on white Shepherder's or sourdough bread. (No additional ingredients) It is fun to see I am not the only one! I made some potato salad for the today's BBQ (4th of July) and will have to have a sandwich tomorrow if there is any left!
Thanks for the smile. :)

So simple, yet I would have never thought of it!  I put it in a pita pocket instead of on a bun to make it a little less messy.  I will definitely have it again!

I used a plain homemade potato salad to make this.  I then added some onion and garlic powder and paprika. The tomato was a nice addition. This would be very good in a tortilla, wheat pita or on an english muffin.

We had these for a late night snack with some leftover potato salad I had in the fridge. I don't love potato salad so I didn't  have much hope for em but they turned out nice and maybe I won't always have potato salad lurking in the fridge after a bbq.

So funny, I was eating one of these when I decided to look it up. And to think, I thought I was the only person who ate this- my kids still think I'm nuts! LOL
I do not add extra mayo, and usually just eat it on plain bread, but today I had toast.

I made these DAILY during the first trimester of my last pregnancy.  My husband thought I was crazy- so surprised to see that someone else thought of it too!  It's actually delicious!

This was surprisingly good and a great way to use up leftovers! I don't think we would go out of our way to make this all the time, but it was nice for a change! Thanks for sharing. :)
