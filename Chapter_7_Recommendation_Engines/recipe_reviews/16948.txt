We used this recipe and LOVED IT!  We did, however, make some changes:
we used the following:
Velvetta Mexican Mild Cheese
Stag Chili without Beans
This was definately a hit!

I'm unsure what process cheese food is. I grated sharp cheddar cheese in its place. Is that OKAY? It sure tasted good. Went great as an appetizer for our card party!

This was really good but I arranged the dish a little differently. I mixed softened cream cheese with the salsa and smoothed it into a casserole dish. I then layered with a "healthy" chili containing beans (because we love them) to which I added a little cayenne for some heat and again, topped with fresh shredded cheddar and canned chile peppers. I popped the dish into the micorwave for a few minutes and it came out great. Thanks Mary!

Delicious recipe, my husband loved it and took the leftovers to work the next day, and all his coworkers raved about it.  Serve with Fritos scoops.

this was by far the easiest dip I've ever made and everyone loved it! I made it for the football game this past weekend and there wasn't a drop left by the time I got to the table. I had to make some more just so I could try it! So worth it!

This was good though, since I am not a Velveeta fan I used a mild cheddar instead.Seemed to be a crowd pleaser as I had none left over.

Tasty! This went well with our mexican-themed dinner, which included an enchilada casserole and mexican cream cheese roll-ups (also found on this site). I still prefer my "danger dip" recipe over this one but it was similar in taste and still pretty good. Fritos "scoops" worked best! Thanks.

As suggested by other members, I used Velveeta Jalapeno Cheese, The Campbells Chili Soup, and hot sausage and it completely made this dip.  I am not sure how delicious it would have been without these specifics.  Took to a party where it was a hit!  Making it for another party tonight...it was super when it was hot, but yet still great cold!  Never going back to old Taco dip!

This is very good and simple to make. I like the flavor that the salsa adds. I made it for a Xmas party and it was a hit with the young and old! A real crowd pleaser that i will make again and again!

I made this for our 'dip night' last night and we LOVED it! I did use chili with beans because we like it, but made no other changes otherwise. I just popped everything into my mini slow cooker and let it go, stirring occasionally, until it was all melted and combined. This was super tasty and a definate keeper in my house! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious! A real crowd pleaser. It helps to melt the Velveta and the cream cheese in the mivrowave before adding to the sauce pan. Also, it's really good when you add ground beef or sausage!

I make this on football Sundays.  My husband loves it. It is so easy, I just throw everything into a crock pot about an hour in advance and it's ready to go.
I always get complements on it.

Made this for the super bowl... it was really good!! The cream cheese didn't separate really well, which can affect the appearance, but it still tasted great!

YUMM- my family loved this! Made it on the stove top and then transferred to a mini dip crock pot. Used medium salsa but regular velveeta (lots of kids here) and hormel chili with no beans (although beans would have been fine). I did add about an ounce more velveeta bc I like it cheesy (or in this case- fake cheesy!). Everyone ate it up- will make again for another football party! I searched through so many recipes and this was perfect for what I was looking for. Thanks!

Excellent! I got tons of compliments and a few requests for the recipe. I used my own homemade chili (with beans). I used Velveeta but I think real cheese would be great as well.

This is the bomb !!!  I knew I had a party to go to tonight and I was looking for a new dip recipe to take.  Seems as though I always take the same thing. I came across this recipe and had everything to make it so decided to go ahead and try it.  Everyone LOVED it !  It even tasted fine once it cooled down and wasn't piping hot.  You can't go wrong with this combination !!!
