I was a little bit worried about the sugar in the raw because it is so big but this cookie came out fantastic! I only baked it until it was 2/3 cooked and then added ice cream on top.  I've never had my 15 year old compliment me so many times for a dessert!

We liked it. It was really good and the ice cream made it even better. The chocolate chips and the chocolate syrup evened it out and the cookie was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

This was my first recipe ever and it was amazing! My family loved it as well! If you love chocolate then this is the recipe for you, there are so many chocolate chips and hot fudge.
