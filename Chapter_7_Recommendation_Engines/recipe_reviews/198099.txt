I made this tonight using a jar of small oysters and some farmers' market eggs. It was fast and easy--puffed up beautifully under the broiler! With a green salad and crusty bread, this dinner took less than 30 minutes to get on the table.

Oysters and eggs, who would have known! I used this recipe as inspiration and made mine with garlic, onion, red bell pepper, bacon and a splash of cognac. Very good!

This recipe was really great.  I loved the flavor of fresh herbs with the eggs.  

To Katydid68, I think it's unfair for you to rate this recipe considering your lack of proper ingredients and several changes.  Try it with the correct ingredients and I bet you WILL rate it with 5 stars.  Maybe not but at least it will be more fair.

Tried this this morning. Maybe I shouldn't give it only 4 stars since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand and had to make do with dried seasonings and evaporated milk. Also, what I didn't like about it may have been my fault. I like my eggs a little soft and didn't know how to do that cooking them 2 different ways. My husband said it was OK and had a LOT of suggestions on how to fix it. I don't think I'll be making it again.

shucking the oysters (or whatever shellfish I bought; whatever was cheapest)was the hardest part. Nuke them in the micro for a little bit. They pop right open.
   Nice recipe.

It's raining here at the beach in SoCal, windy, grey--dark even. . .  Ahhh. . . This recipe made me think of my fine days in Seattle where I used to make hang town fry and recipes like it, using oysters, salmon, Northwest ingredients from Pike Place etc.  And I used oysters and salmon in this dish, potatoes also.  So it was indeed like a frittata.  I baked a large potato and sliced it, then fried it all crispy and brown in olive oil before putting the oysters on top to cook a bit.  Next I poured the egg mixture over, which was custom (isn't yours always, too?).  The rest pretty much went by recipe.

As written, this recipe was just OK for me because it was lacking in flavor and overall zip.   Having said that, it cooked up beautifully with the eggs fluffy and the presentation beautiful.   So, I believe this is a good "base" recipe from which you could add any meats, veggies and seasoning to your own liking.   I will definitely try it out again with sauteed onions added as a minimum, some salt and probably a stronger cheese since the parmesan was lost in the mix.

I liked it but, my wife couldn't go for the oysters.  She likes clams.  Maybe next time.

I followed the recipe plus added some veggies (potatoes, saut√©ed spinach and garlic) plus used freshly shucked oysters from my local shellfish farm.  It came out just like the picture,  which made me feel very fancy.  

However, I can't decide if I dislike eggs and oysters in combination OR if I'm just not ready for oysters at breakfast.  

I'll make again,  possibly with smoked fish- no oysters.
