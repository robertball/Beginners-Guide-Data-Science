This was nice - somewhat like a taco salad. I used less cheddar, only about 1/4 cup of sliced olives, and a chopped green onion instead of the chives. The tortillas in the middle were a bit soggy - next time I will not layer as in the recipe, but mix the chicken and soup/tomatoes, top with tortillas, then with cheese.

I'd never heard of this casserole but thought I would give it a shot.  Very yummy but you need to add more crushed chips on top each time you have it for leftovers for extra oomph :o)

I mexicanized this recipe a bit. Instead of cheddar cheese, I used one brick of mild cheddar, one brick of hot pepper cheese, and a bag of kroger shredded pepper jack cheese. Also, instead of the tomatoes, I used 1/2 jar of mild salsa, and added a couple tablespoons of diced green chilies on top of that. With using the salsa, you do NOT need to use the chicken broth at all. Also, I used a 16 oz package of the corn tortilla's - gave it a great flavor. Family absolutely LOVED it and my son ate the leftovers for breakfast this morning. 

I like a lot of cheese and so does my family. The recipe's amount would not do for us.

This turned out easy and good, although I think adding a little onion in it would help. Thanks for the post.

I used salsa in place of the tomatoes and zesty chips to give it more zip. It was awesome.

I used ranch flavored chips and served the dish on top of a bed of lettuce and tomatoes. Was different but tasty.

This recipe was very bland.  Even the tomato and chili peppers didnt give it much flavor.  I wont be making this again.

Very Good. Only had 5 thighs and it didn't seem like enough chicken so the 1st layer I made with the chips and then halved the chicken between the other two layers.

I thought the recipe was quite bland and I cooked it for 30 minutes (recommended 30-45) and the top was hard and flaky (over cooked).  Cook for less time if you decide to go with this recipe.
