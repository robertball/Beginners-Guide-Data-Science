Wow, I finally found something to use to baste pork chops on the George Foreman!  I didn't have any oranges, so I used some Orange/Lemon/Pepper spice blend from the cupboard.  I reserved some sauce too!  Served with green beans and small pasta (spray butter and parmesan).  Don't want to take away from this yummy sauce!  : ))

I used this recipe for grilled chicken breasts. Next time I will marinate the chicken in some of the mixture for a few hours -- it turned out too dry for my liking. The flavor was pretty good. I will try it again.

Very good and the chops were nice and tender.  Would use a little less orange peel next time I make it but we all enjoyed this as is.

Yummy...you should, however, make additional sauce, keep it warm and serve over the chops.  Also, you shouldn't put the sauce on when you begin cooking as it will possibly just burn (from all the sugar).  Cook the chops and put the sauce on only at the end of cooking.  Will make this again for sure!

I made this recipe for guests and it turned out really well. We doubled the recipe and left out the orange peel and everyone really enjoyed it.  I also used Kraft's brown sugar barbecue sauce with the greatest of compliments.

I used this sauce with pork kabobs and they turned out great.  Marinated the cubed meat for a couple of hours before cooking and brushed more sauce on as I turned the kabobs on the BBQ. I will definitely use this recipe again.

The pork chops turned out great. As per another reviewer I marinated the chops overnight. My husband will be making these again!

We made these chops and added the salsa from this recipe (http://pork.allrecipes.com/az/GrilldPrkChpswithSmmrtimSl.asp).  Both were delicious!
