DELICIOUS! I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream b/c that's what I had on hand. Also, I started out w/ 1/4 cup of the vinegar (personally, 1/2 cup seemed like it would be a bit much), and that was perfect for us. Loved the addition of the poppy seeds in this. I will def be using this recipe again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a basic coleslaw dressing subbing heavy cream for milk or buttermilk and rice wine vinegar for cider vinegar. The 1 teaspoon of poppy seeds did little to enhance the flavor of the finished coleslaw although visually appealing. If rated against bottled coleslaw dressings, this would definitely get a 5* but don’t expect it to match or exceed coleslaw you’ve had that stood out as among the best. The write up talks about eliminating the need to run to the store to buy bottled dressing but more cooks will have milk or buttermilk and cider vinegar on hand rather than the ingredients listed here. To season this a bit, mustard powder and Creole seasoning was added. This dressing is very good for what it is, but coleslaw that distinguishes itself from typical deli slaw is our preference.

Made this dressing last night for coleslaw to top pulled pork sandwiches.Everyone loved it! I only had 1/2&1/2 instead of cream and I did only add 1/4 cup rice vinegar. It came out fluffy, creamy and delicious! This will be my only dressing recipe. *I put it all in a mason jar and shook it up to mix. I think it makes the dressing mix better and come out thick and fluffy.

I've made this a few times already~~after reading the other reviews, I did make some changes this time, only because I like experimenting.  Used a little bit less vinegar & sugar, added about a 1/4 teaspoon ground celery seed,& ginger/garlic paste, and some dry mustard. Used lemon/pepper seasoning salt, & it will sit in the fridge a few hours before I use it.  I've also used it as a sandwich topping-very good! Thanks, Donna, for this quick, easy recipe.

I used 1/2 and 1/2 because I didn't have heavy cream (I also wanted to avoid the fat and calories too) I think it did the job that I needed which was to make the bodacious broccoli salad from this website.  Didn't have poppy seeds but it was good, no complaints from anyone and easy to whip up.

Wonderful ~ and so easy to prepare!  I cut the vinegar in half and used celery seed instead of poppy seeds.  Placed it directly into a mason jar and gave it a shake.  How convenient!   No more bottled coleslaw dressing for us.  Thanks for sharing!
