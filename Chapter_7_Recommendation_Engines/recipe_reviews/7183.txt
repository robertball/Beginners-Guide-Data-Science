I was looking for a flat bread that was like Gyro bread.  Cooking this in the oven made more of a cracker, so I decided to try it on a hot cast iron griddle on the stove.  They came out wonderfully!! Just what I was looking for.  I would up the salt to 1 teaspoon, a little bland.

A good little, simple recipe. On my second batch, I left it in the oven for an extra tenminutes, and they became like little crackers that can keep for a long time!

I like my flatbrod crispy and I found the baking time for this recipe a little short so after I baked them for 10 min. at 350 degrees, I put them all into a slow (150 degree) oven for an additional 45 minutes to make them crisp.

YUM!!!  I follow this recipe exactly but cook like pancakes on a griddle just because it's faster.  They are crunchy outside and a little more like gyro/pita bread on the inside.  Perfect for my Hummus!!!  Made several times over, perfect every time.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!!

I love this recipe, it was so easy to make and delicious!  I did change the salt to 1 tsp and I did pan cook/fry them.  It took about 3-5 minutes to cook each side and my peices were about 6" in diameter.  I am going to experiment with this recipe and add herbs and maybe even cheese next time.  I love this healthy alternative to other carb snacks.

Made this last night and topped it with onions, tomatoes, basil, chesse and spices to make a flat bread pizza. My wife loved it and asked me to make it again, so we can try different toppings. I made the bread as is and it was perfect.

Wholesome and satisfying! I made a few changes to make it more festive: ground a pinch each of cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, poppy seeds. Sprinkled the ground spices on top of the bread while baking.

Thank You SO MUCH for this recipe!!  I use this as a base.  I add garlic powder, onion powder, a little more salt and shredded cheddar cheese.  This recipe is so easy and really great! I cooked this along with meatloaf the other night, chopped some onion up and we made meatloaf pizza slices with it. Fantastic!!  Thank you again!

So easy and so delicious!  It is perfect with chicken salad, or any kind of creamy salad. Don't need to increase the salt as some other reviewers said. The recipe is just fine as written by Liz.  thanks for sharing!

DEEELICOUS!!! these were so healthy, simple and it's bread which is good because most bread has yeast which is bad for me so I'm really happy I found this recipe. If your one of those people that want more flavor in your food amp up the salt!

Great recipe!  Tastes almost like my mother-in-law's in Norway.  I made it one day when I was lonely for Norway, which is often.... It was a great comfort.  Thanks!

These were good. I cooked em in the frying pan with some oil instead of baking. Added an extra tsp of salt as suggested, but don't recommend it.

I served this with melted butter and it was pretty good.  It was also pretty easy to make.  Overall, though, only 3 stars because I probably won't make this again; it was just ok.

Excellent recipe. This was a nice crisp bread baked in a stone oven. I used Spelt flour and sesame seeds in it and wow it was the order of the day. Thanks

The first rule of cooking is that the end product tastes "good".  The item created must have a quality that those tasting it find it satisfying, enjoyable or complimentary with another item it shares the plate with.  Natural, organic, and home-made items must first meet this standard.

Unfortunantly, this does not.  It has none of the characteristics of Middle-Eastern or Mediterranean flat breads.  Its description as a cracker-bread is determinant only by the baking time.  The 8 minutes is not remotely accurate with ending up with a flat bread and if you double the time you still do not obtain a cracker.  The amount of buttermilk is also understated by 1/3.
Even following a suggestion to add spices and seeds left this recipe tasteless and without an enjoyable texture.

Okay, I changed the recipe plenty, but I loved it so I think it still deserves 5 stars.  I doubled the salt, substituted yogurt for buttermilk, and added 1/4 tsp of both garlic and onion powders.  I cooked on the stovetop in a non-stick skillet and they were delicious.  I think this is a great base recipe that can be altered easily to fit your needs and make a quick, tasty little bread.  This will be in constant rotation in my kitchen.
Edit:  I just used this as a pizza dough and it worked great.  The only change I made was upping the garlic and onion powder to a half teaspoon each.  Loved it!
