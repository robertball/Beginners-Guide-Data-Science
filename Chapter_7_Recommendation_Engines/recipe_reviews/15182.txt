Whoa!  Is this a cake?  Or is it a cake-shaped casserole?  I have to admit, I tried it because it was low in cholesterol - no eggs, but I really think it needs at least egg whites to make it a little fluffy, and I didn't have pineapple to use as was required by several other recipes.  It is *incredibly* dense, although it is also very moist.  However, it truly is not very much like cake.  I never should have doubled the recipe, but I wanted to make a bundt cake.  The directions say to use an 8-inch round cake pan.  It would have to be a VERY deep pan to accommodate the recipe as written.  I had so much batter after doubling the recipe that I was able to make a bundt cake AND an 8-inch square cake.  The bundt cake took about an hour to bake, which is to be expected.  Pick inserted in several places passed the "cake is done" test.  I sent the entire bundt cake to work with my husband to share and he said everyone devoured it.  My husband said he ate it because he liked the cream cheese frosting I put on it.  There is no accounting for why anyone else ate it, so I gave it 3 stars.  However, I really wanted to give the recipe 0 stars or just 1 star.  I really would suggest that you try a different recipe unless you happen to like an extremely dense cake.  Although, being so dense, it was no problem removing it from the bundt pan!

I finally found an egg less carrot cake!  I thought the recipe was good, not as moist as the cake with eggs.  However, I gave it 5 stars, since this is the best egg less recipe I have found.    Light on sugar (the way my husband likes it); and with a cream cheese icing it is very good.  I did a bunt cake and the amount was perfect.

I don't know what the previous reviewer did,  but I had no problem with the amount of batter.  Just enough for one cake.

The cake is fairly dense, but not incredibly so.  This isn't really a desert though you could westernize it with icing if you wanted to turn it into one.

I think the reason this cake comes out too dense is it has too little leavening it needs at least 3 teaspoons baking powder, better yet baking soda, and 2 Tb vineager in lieu of lemon juice, also reduce oil to 1/2 cup.

Very easy to make.

I changed it a bit, and works fine with 1/5 of the oil and more sugar. I also added some raisins and oats, and used hazelnuts instead of walnuts.

A really tasty, slightly dense, hearty cake/bread.  I added a few chocolate chips for some weird reason (with carrot cake?) but it turned out delicious! I used a greased 9 x 13 pan and cooked it for about 40 mins and it was perfect for my taste. Thank you very much for the recipe!

This was a great, healthier recipe! It's more like a thick loaf than a 'cake', which i enjoyed very much. I recommend using larger than a 9" pan, as it rises too high to cook thoroughly without slightly burning. It took a full hour, with a slight burn with the 9".. probably 45 minutes in a rectangular one, or two loaf pans, would work perfectly. I really enjoyed the crispy outside, but of course that turned into more 'moist' after i wrapped it for the night.. so i recommend baking it the day of. It was still quite moist, although i added a few things like the prev recommendations: 2 cups of milk, 1/4 cup oil and a 1/4 cup of applesauce (healthier), an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar.. it ended up nice and slightly sweet, the orange was subtle, the cinnamon too :) Def make again!!

This is very yummy! Tastes even better with some cream cheese frosting. I didn't use any orange zest in mine, and I used 3 cups of white flour instead of 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat. Defenetly not very sweet so use frosting for sure!
