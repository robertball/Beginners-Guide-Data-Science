I thought this was really good but I did make a few changes.  I didn't use broth, just a little water until it was the right texture for me. I also didn't save any onions for the top, just cooked all of them.  I didn't add chicken and added 1/2 cup frozen corn and 1 cup salsa (to the mixture after the black beans).  I put crushed baked tortilla chips on the bottom of a casserole dish, then added the bean mixture and then a little cheese, which I broiled.   I got to eat a lot for not so many calories!  I recommend this recipe.

Even though I changed a few minor things, I still ENTHUSIASTICALLY give this recipe 5 stars!  My husband and I fought the whole way on this recipe.  He was HORRIFIED at the thought of nachos with SPINACH and NO CHEESE.  Those, of course, are the reasons why I was drawn to this recipe in the first place!  So we compromised a bit.  I used only 1 cup of broth (to make it less soupy) and instead of 'wilting' the tortilla chips in the chicken mixture, I TOPPED the chips with it (DH hated the idea of 'soggy nachos').  Also, I used a can of stewed tomatoes (mexican style) instead of regular whole.  I added a bit of shredded muenster cheese to appease the hubby (I didn't miss it AT ALL).  DH, usually lukewarm at best, loved this recipe (wow).  Next time, to increase the nutritional value even more, I'll try baked tortilla chips, add another can of beans, and even more spinach (don't tell my husband!).  Also, my kids (4.5 & 18 mos) devoured it.  I couldn't be happier with this recipe and would recommend it to anybody...

Believe it or not my husband and I thought this might be good with shrimp... hah. But we like this chicken/blackbean version a lot and will make it again. I didn't have avocado (oh how I wish they had good ones here!!) but I know it would put this over the top. We also did not add stock- the "bean juice" was enough liquid. This made it nice and chunky and I served it like regular nachos.. spread chips on cookie sheet, pile high with stuff, then warm in oven. Good food. Oh PS- you might want to add more spices. I added cumin, chili powder, garlic salt... typical taco flavors. But it really could go a lot of directions. But thats why I gave it four stars b/c it def needs "a little something"

I tried to do this as nachos, but did not work. The chips got too soggy so I ate it without chips. It pretty much was just black bean soup.

This recipe didn't wow me, but it's good.  I was trying to decide between three and four stars and I settled on four because this is easy to make and about as healthy as a nachos recipe can be.  That makes it worth making again.  I skipped the jalapeno pepper and added a little tabasco sauce because I don't like my foods too hot and I wanted to be able to have more control over it.  I also reduced the broth by a cup and used the mixture as a topping for the chips instead of mixing them in.  I didn't like the raw onions on top, so I'll skip that next time.

I loved this recipe, the first time I made it I used fresh tomatoes and just cooked them down a little longer. I also used blue chips, my family loved this, I have made it once a week since.

I used this as a base to what I had on hand. I ended up boiling down some frozen salsa I made last year, then added the chicken, stock and beans.  I didn't have any spinach but can't wait to try this again with it. I poured it over crushed tortilla chips to still have some crunch. It was a great, quick dinner for my 2 year old son and I.  I will definitly make again when Hubby is out of town (he does not eat anything with salsa in it). Do try this!
