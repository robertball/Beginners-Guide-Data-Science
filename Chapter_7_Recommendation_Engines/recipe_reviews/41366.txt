It was okay.  It is a nice change from just steamed veggies.

This is a very tasty side dish.  It is chalk full of flavor and low calorie...which is perfect for my husband who is dieting.  I like getting new ideas on ways to prepare side dishes and this one is a hit!!

This was pretty good. I added some garlic and a dash of Tabasco to the veggies. Nice variated on plain vegetables.

Disappointing. I ended up adding practically an entire bottle of Italian dressing in order to get any kind of flavor. I didn't much like the boiled onions either. If I were to make this again - which I doubt - I would probably heat up some Italian dressing and then toss the drained veggies in it.

definetly a VERY nice change to just plain ol' steamed veggies. I tried this twice with other mixed veggies [ie, califlower instead of zuchinni] and it turned out pretty good

Quick, easy and pretty to look at -- I'll use this recipe again for certain.  Guests liked it, but I think I can also improve the flavor with more seasoning.  (Fun for me!)
