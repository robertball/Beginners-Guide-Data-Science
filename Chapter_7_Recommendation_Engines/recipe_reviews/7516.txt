My son did this for a cooking class project.  What a huge disappointment it was.  It would not come out of the pan (note: it says to only grease the pan, not flour).  It was very crumbly and dry.  It had to be cooked longer than it said to have the middle done.  The frosting was okay, didn't hardly cover the cake.  My husband's comment was it seemed to be missing something.  I watched my son make this and he didn't leave anything out.  I would never make this again.

I thought this cake needs more chocolate and maybe a teaspoon more of vanilla. But the frosting was very good. By the time the middle of the cake was done the sides were really dry.

The name says it all. This was really the best chocolate cake!  The cake turned out perfectly moist and the frosting...absolutely delicious! My dad said it was the best chocolate cake he's tasted! AND the directions were easy to follow! If you want the best, try this recipe!

This was very good! I did not think the overall appearance was very good though. The frosting tasted great, but it looked very thick and was very hard to spread. It was a big hit with my grandparents who came to visit and my family, I just was not as impressed with the looks of it. Thanks for the recipe I'm sure I'll use it again.

I made this cake and it turned out so great. I made it for my boyfriend and his 5  roommates and it was gone quickly. I didn't have vinegar so I didn't put that in, but I'm not sure it made that much of a difference. SO good.

This is the first chocolate cake I could eat without frosting it was so good and moist. My husband said it was the best cake I ever made. I did have to cook my cake longer around 25 minutes but I had no problem getting mine out of the pan. It was so good I made it again the very next week.

My 3 year old and i had a swell time making this cake.  I  used cake flour and halved the recipe so it would fit into an 8" round pan.  I did grease and flour the pan. (always do) it was done in the time stated.

I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients at home (I love the ingredient search!). These were really good. I made cupcakes with this recipe and they are disappearing!! FAST! I followed the recipe to a T. This is a keeper!

I never let a bad rating make me not try a recipe, so I tried this one. I made 2 9inch rounds. One I had to throw out, the bottom was burnt. Although it said 400 I don't know what happened. The other I savaged and it tasted allright, and I have to admit I added more cocoa. Probably about an additional 1/4 which made it more chocolatey. I would suggest baking this at 350. I also would add more cocoa or use a premium grade I used Nestle.

My family loved this cake!  I am making it for the second time for another family dinner tonight.  I used unsalted butter, so I added a little salt to the recipe.  We thought it was very moist and flavorful.

I did not like this cake.  I'm don't want to criticize this cake, but I must say that it is not my cup of tea.  I would like to recommend "Elsa's Great Homemade Chocolate Cake" at cooks.com.  It's amazing.

This cake was a big hit at my nieces 1st birthday party. It is moist and not overpoweringly rich or sweet. It was the 1st time everyone finished their whole piece of cake. The frosting is soooo delicious! it tastes like christmas fudge. The cake would be naked without this frosting. It makes a great cake filler as well.

I followed the recipe exactly but found this cake to be quite heavy (more like a brownie) and it had very little flavor.
I gave three stars because the frosting was really good. Instead of milk i used hot strong coffee for mocha frosting.

Sorry to say that this cake looked good but barely tasted like chocolate.  It wasn't awful but not great either.  My guess is that it needs a lot of actual chocolate in the recipe.  It was pretty but very bland.

I doubled the frosting and made a 9" layered cake. I found the cake to be on the dry side and would only give it 3 stars but the frosting was delicious, 5 stars. Averaged it out to 4 stars.

I tried 2 of allrecipes "best ever" and the only good thing I could say was that they were both easy to make and the frostings was great.  I wouldn't waste my time or the ingredients on this cake again but the frosting is wonderful.

Ok this cake was absolutely disgusting!!! All you can taste is the shortening. IT WASN'T EDIBLE!!! However, I gave it one star because the frosting was out of this world. I would recommend using another cake recipe and using the frosting in this recipe.

should be called the best brownie cake ever. was not fluffy like a cake. the cake was more like a brownie but not as rich a one.
did not use the frosting from recipe, used regular store bought chocolate frosting. cake was great tasting and very moist. definitely a hit!!
