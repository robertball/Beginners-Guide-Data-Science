Wow, why has no one tried and rated this recipe yet? Yay! I am first! :D This is an absolute EXCELLENT Vegetarian Chili option! with the inclusion of the quinoa, you do not miss the meat and it is SO healthy for you.  I made a couple changes, I used vegetable broth to cook my quinoa in as opposed to water (I always do and it lends a nice flavour to the quinoa), and used red quinoa as I prefer that over the plain.  I also used Ground Chipotle Chili Powder instead of regular chili powder as I love the smoky flavour it brings to the dish.  To make this even more healthy and to cut out as much sodium as possible, I used dried beans (re-hydrated) and instead of the canned/crushed tomatoes, I chopped up 4 large roma tomatoes, oops, one more, I left out the zucchini as I am not a fan of that vegetable. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly with all the other ingredients and it is spicy with the inclusion of the jalapeno and the chipotle, so adjust to your liking if you are not a fan of too much heat.  This does make a large pot worth, so I just divided it up into 2 cup portions and froze them, these will make great meals on the fly, just serve with some cornbread or a salad! Thanks Shauna for the great recipe! a clear winner here! :D

While I have been using this website for years, this is the first recipe I have ever reviewed. This chili deserves it! The only thing I did differently was to add an extra can of tomato sauce because I wanted a saucier chili. This was my first attempt at cooking with quinoa, so I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the texture of it in chili. But it was wonderful. It blended right in and added a heartiness to the dish. Great recipe! I will be making this again and again.

This was really good and quick to make.  Cooked the quinoa in chicken broth. I used green beans instead of zuccini and canned corn instead of frozen.  To make it healthier, I used no salt added canned beans and veggies. I will be making this again :)

My husband and I had heard that quinoa very healthy, and he really wanted to try it.  He chose this recipe as the one he wanted to experiment with.  I was rather reluctant, as food texture is a big deal for me, and I'm not a big fan of bell peppers.  I'm so glad that we made this!  Not only is the flavor excellent, but the crunch of the bell peppers really added a lot to this dish.  The quinoa was a different texture than I was expecting (I thought it would be more like couscous), and it turns out I really enjoyed it!  This recipe is very filling, and makes quite a bit, so we were able to freeze several containers for future meals.  Thanks!  (Oh - and my husband LOVED the chili!  He wants to make it again!)

Really loved this! Personal changes made: used veg broth and red quinoa; Added 1 tsp of coriander to the spices; red pepper was $3 each, so left out and wasn't missed; increased chipotle to 2 Tbsp (tip: pur√©e a can of chipotle in adobe sauce, then drop by tablespoonfuls onto a tray and freeze, then pull out drops as needed); added 1C of water with the tomatoes to help loosen the mixture; added 1 drained can of corn. Dollop Greek yogurt on top and a bit of shredded cheese. Great!

This turned out wonderful, I added twice the amount of spices since we like it hot and made it in the slow cooker for about 8 hours so it was really easy. Just added the Quinoa the last hour or so.

Oh I can't wait for leftovers tonight. So good and healthy! I did cook ny quinoa in chicken broth for a bit more flavor.  Also added dried corriander and dried cilantro leaves since I had no fresh. I did have to thin this out a bit with some water. Once the cooked quinoa is added, it still seems to absorb moisture from the chili. Added some fresh mushrooms and a can of fire roasted tomatoes too. Served with shredded Mexican cheese blend and of course for me, I kick up the heat and add red pepper flakes to mine. Thanks!

Fabulous chili! The quinoa was an excellent substitute for ground beef or turkey. It's very high in protein for a grain, so you keep the protein and skip the fat. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this last night.  What a great way to use Quinoa.  I soaked pinto beans the night b-4 in stead of the black beans, and added an 11 oz can of V8 juice.  Left out the  corn and zucchini, didn't have them and it really didn't need them, loved the chipotle added 2 T of that!
Thank you Shauna for a great recipe, I will be making this again.  I would give this 10 stars if I could!

This was very good; I did add a can of fire roasted tomatoes to the crushed tomatoes because there wasn't enough liquid for the veggies I had in there. I also then added a small can of diced tomatoes (I like a chunkier sauce). Left out the jalapeno - don't really like them & I don't like things TOO spicy. That said, I ended up putting in too many chipotle peppers in the adobo sauce - that made it MUCH too spicy - fortunately I had put in LESS cumin & oregano than it called for.

No one else in my family will eat, but I still like it - although too spicy, it's VERY good - I'll make it again though, keeping in mind not to overdo the chipotles!

I rate this four stars because while it's good as is, there's something missing. I played with it and feel these changes improve the outcome. When you're putting in the tomatoes etc. add the following: 1 tbsp cocoa (I know it sounds weird but it's really good in chili and you won't think it's chocolatey---it just adds some depth and body to the flavor); 1 1/2 tsps liquid smoke (this made a very big difference, highly recommend using); 1 tsp white sugar; 1 tsp brown sugar; 1/4 tsp cayenne; 2 tsps coriander. I also use just under 1 tsp salt and about 1/4 tsp black pepper. A great, healthy meal that goes a long way and costs little.

This is awesome.  I backed off the Jalapeno and used a small can of Hot Diced chili peppers.  I upped the chili powder a bit but it was incredible.  I was worried that the basic recipe was a bit runny but when you add the quinoa it thickens to a perfect touch.  This is a winner... even my kids loved it.

This was a hit with the whole family-even the 7 & 8 year olds. . I am the only vegetarian so when meat eating family likes a dish...you know it was good. They called it a keeper! I used fresh soaked black beans. Olive oil instead of veg oil.  I added an extra zucchini because we like them. I did not use the jalapeno but I use a roasted green chili. I added more tomatoe sauce and two fresh minced tomatos. I also added fresh roasted corn about two ears. served it to the meat eaters with chedder cheese sprinled on top. Yumm!

This recipe takes a little getting used to as the quinoa adds a very different texture to the dish. I made this in an attempt to find vegetarian dishes that my family would eat. The flavors were good, but the kids didn't like it. My husband just kept saying that it would be better with meat in it. Sadly, as much as I prefer vegetarian dishes, I'd have to agree with him on this one :( 

This will still be a standby recipe to use up food storage in the future.

I also used broth,  I threw it all in a pot and simmered it for a couple hours.  Ended up adding 2 extra cups of water.  Left out the onion, zucchini and hot peppers. (family preferences). Used a bit of onion powder, and I only had 1/2 a green pepper so I added 3 carrots.  
Still turned out wonderful and the kids ate it up with some crackers in it.  Obvioulsy versitile, quick and delicous.

Woah, this recipe makes a TON of food! Fortunately, I love this recipe & know that none of it will go to waste! I'm a vegetarian and am always looking for healthy, filling recipes...like this one! I followed the recipe exactly...although I simmered it for about 40 minutes (versus 20 suggested in the recipe).  This is a keeper!

Oh my gosh amazing! I did not add zucchini (not in season), or the jalapeno or chipolte peppers because we don't do hot food in my house (lol). It is still fantastic! We love it!

I made this chili for dinner last night and was REALLY pleased with it.  I am not a chili person at all, so that should tell you something.  A few notes:
1) like others, I cooked the quinoa in broth (low sodium vegetable).  I think red quinoa is key - don't swap out for the white variety.  
2) Next time, we'll add more chipotle peppers / adobo sauce.  It was very nice w/ the amount recommended in the recipe, but a little more would be great.  
3)  I added large chunks of portobella mushrooms close to the end of the cooking process (along with the corn, basically) as I like them in just about everything.  They were excellent.  
4)  Next time, I'll add more zucchini (I shred mine) and will probably do away with the bell peppers (just a preference thing - I'm not crazy about bell peppers in general and don't feel like they add much, other than color.
5) I used roughly 6 cloves of garlic.  We're garlic people.  Next time, will do same and probably add some garlic powder, too.  

We're not vegetarians, but I prefer cooking vegetarian meals (just more interesting than meat-based dishes, in my opinion) and as many of our friends are vegetarians, I try to keep a batch of recipes on-hand that will please everyone.

Even as-is, I feel like I could have served this to company.

This was good and hearty, but a bit bland. It's a great base, though. I made mine in the slow cooker, adding the beans and corn in the last hour. I used a dried chipotle instead of adobo. Next time, I'll bump up the spices and add a cinnamon stick, and I may add a touch of vinegar for some extra flavor. I may also throw in some garbanzos, because I love the texture they add.

This sounded so good but it came out way too thick and weird. It was more like eating some kind of casserole than chili - I could have used a fork. I like the idea so I'll keep looking for another recipe like this one, but this one definitely did not do it for me. Bummer.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  I was a little skeptical about trying it, because my previous experimentations with quinoa had been ho-hum. But this was great!  The texture of the quinoa in the chili works perfectly, it's inexplicable.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!  Usually I make turkey chili, and I didn't miss the meat at all.

Really good! I thought it was too thick, but that is easily remedied. I also think it would have been better if it simmered longer. My husband wanted to dislike it but didn't =)

My first time cooking with quinoa, and I enjoyed this chili very much.  I cooked the quinoa in vegitable broth per other suggestions, substituted one of the can of black beans for cannellini beans since that was all I had on hand and used 2 tspns of powdered chipotle instead of canned.  Chili was very satisfying and did not miss the meat, but the dish is probably not the most attractive meal I ever made if appearance is important to you(perhaps not a dish for a dinner party?)  One note, although this does make a big batch I don't think it was as much as 10 servings.

I'm so glad this recipe exists! I made it as written the first time, and now I can't stop making it. The hubby is a vegetarian and has been wanting some good chili for a while, which is how I found the recipe and now I actually prefer this chili to meat chili. I didn't find it too watery or thick or spicy...just perfectly delicious!

This is such a hearty chili, you won't miss the meat. I top it with a dollop of fat free sour cream and serve with a salad.  This recipe does make a lot, but you'll have lunch for the remainder of the week.

I have never rated a recipe, but just had to rate this one. It is SO delicious and incredibly nutritious to boot! My kids devour it, although I leave the jalapeno out for them and/or temper it with a dollop of Greek yogurt. I could eat this every day!

This was delicious. I made pretty much exactly to the recipe except I used more chipotle pepper and probably more spices all around (just to taste). I served it with avocado, Monterrey jack, and made a skillet corn bread to with it. We inhaled this.

Delicious!!!  My mother, who is on a gluten-free diet, is visiting, so I am looking for recipes that we can all enjoy while she is here.  Because of some pepper intolerance, I omitted the pepper, but otherwise made the recipe as written.  This is a very, very thick chili.  Some of us ate it in a bowl with a spoon, like chili would be eaten.  But my kids and husband actually preferred this rolled in a tortilla with cheese, sour cream and lettuce.  Either way, this made for a delicious dinner for the entire family.  Thanks!

This was really, really good. Had too many tomatoes from the garden so I decided to add a cup or two of those diced with a can of thick tomatoe sauce. I only added one can of black beans and another can of chili beans. It turned out awesome and I highly recommend. Very pleased with this since I'm not a big vegetarian person.

I decided to keep a tiny bit of the jalepeno seeds because I like my chili spicy. Bad idea, it was too spicy. I also lost the zucchini and added pineapple chunks, which was a very nice little extra flavor. And I couldn't find a cheap cumin so I used dried parsley instead. A very good chili, ill definitely make this again, but without the jalepeno seeds I added.

Huge hit with my carnivorous boyfriend. The chipotle peppers give it a nice smokey flavor. And  the corn, zucchini, red and green peppers make it a colorful and vibrant dish. Didn't change a thing. Highly recommend.

Really excellent! Some things we added/substituted according to what we had on hand: hominy instead of regular corn, green beans instead of zucchini, plus italian sausage. The chipotles made for a fantastic, full flavor!!!

Love this recipe!  So tasty and filling but light at the same time.  I served it with avocado slices on top - delicious!  I also tried to make the recipe "cleaner" by using fresh spices.  I'm looking forward to my left overs tonight.

Wow this is awesome!!  I have made several other quinoa recipes with beans, peppers and corn and whatnot and this is really  good.  I made my own pot of black bean just plain, no salt and made the quinoa with vegetable broth.  I didn't have jalapenos or the chipotle peppers stuff so i used five serrano peppers and a teaspoon of ground cayenne red pepper.  This is a really great recipe for emptying out cabinets as someone else suggested and the fridge of veggies you don't want to spoil.  It's not quite spicy enough, but that can remedied by some hot sauce i would say.

EXCELLENT!!! I hardly ever review recipes that I try, but this recipe is FANTASTIC, I will definitely be making this for years to come. I did make some changes- I didn't use zucchini (i like zucchini, but just wasn't in the mood). I used green, red, and orange peppers. Plus the corn helped make the chili very colorful. Instead of pre-cooking the quinoa, I simply placed all of the ingredients into a crockpot. Because quinoa really takes on the flavor well, it worked out nice. It took about 3-4 hours on high, but you could turn it to low once it gets going.

Fantastic dish! Went over really well, and besides for lots of chopping of vegetables, pretty easy to make. Reheats well for leftovers. Goes awesome with a side of cornbread.

Very delicious and nutritious!  I left out the zucchini and the corn (didn't have any), added a second jalapeno pepper and used an orange pepper instead of green as that's what I had on hand.  I used one can of black beans and one can of pinto beans.  This version was quite spicy, but that's how we like it!  Great recipe and very easy to alter based on what you have in your pantry!

This recipe is always a hit at my soup suppers.  I like to use Trader Joe's cajun black beans and mexican style canned tomatoes and skip the jalapeno.  The first time I saw this recipe, it also included ground turkey.  Either way, it's a keeper!

Fantastic recipe! I had diced tomatoes so I used those and a can of tomato sauce. I also couldn't find minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, I ended up just using a small can of jalepeno peppers. Added extra chili powder.

This dish was absolutely delicious!  The meat wasn't missed at all by my usually meat loving family.  Fragrant, healthy, and hearty!

Delicious Recipe! I add additional zucchini and bell peppers. It is a recipe that gets even better when served as left-overs

This is incredibly satisfying!  I don't like much spice, so I didn't add in the jalapeno or chipotle peppers and it was delicious. It will be a new staple in my household!

Really good.  It makes a lot, so good for freezing or leftovers.  The only thing I might change next time is leave out the chipotle peppers and just add hot sauce instead.

Delicious and healthy! I didn't use the chipotle peppers because I couldn't find them so I just use some powder instead. I serve this with plain greek yogurt (as a sub for sour cream), shredded cheddar and green onions. This is one of my go-tos! Great for leftovers as well.

While I would not define this as 'chili', it is very very good and very hearty for having no meat.  I love cooking with quinoa and it works so well here.  I didn't have any chipotle chilis in adobo sauce so I instead used a decent amount of ground chipotle seasoning.  Aside from that, I stuck to the recipe and I won't stray when I make this again.  Thanks! :)

This was a very good vegetarian chili! I cooked the quinoa in veggie stock cause it gives it more flavor and I only used one can of black beans and it seemed to be just the right amount. I also left out the zucchini and chipotle pepper cause I didnt have them. After I added the quinoa it seemed to be a bit thick so I added some veggie stock and it was much better. I will make this again for sure!!

For a meatless chili, this is a really delicious and simple recipe which I will be making again.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of no zucchini and doubling the adobo peppers.  In my opinion, the chili does not need the zucchini and tastes great without it.  I also used fresh pre-cooked leftover corn since I had it which added a great crunchy texture.  The quinoa does act like "meat" in the dish so much so that my meat loving dinner guests went back for seconds and returned a day later for leftovers.  I would allow for some additional prep time.  Maybe my knife skills are not up to par with others, but I definitely got behind on my chopping.

Delicious!!! i followed the recipe for the most part but took the suggestion of cooking my quinoa in vegetable broth opposed to water, I would reccommend to others to do the same. I didnt have black beans on hand so I used red kidney beans instead, left out the zuchini and used chopped carrots which i added in the beginning with the onions as they would need more time to cook than the other veggies and added a bit off grated cheese on top before serving, overall the chilli turned out great and il definately make it again!!

I really enjoyed this chili and my husband and daughter ate it without much complaint. The flavor is really good, and it feels good to eat something that's healthy. I wouldn't say it tastes just like regular chili -- that is to say, I wouldn't put it on top of a hot dog. But the flavor is really good

This recipe replaced my staple vegetarian chili recipe. I make chili at least once a month and this is our new household favorite for the vegetarians and meat eaters! The quinoa is like caviar it's divine! I love to toast my quinoa for a nuttier flavor.

SO TASTY!  omg...excellent.  i had to have 2 bowls full.  i love the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce; it gives it that great smokey spicy taste.  i added 2 pounds of ground pork (rinsed to reduce the fat) to give it some more protein!

It definitely needed some cayenne to kick up the heat! I also added some broccoli to make it a bit more hearty. I bit hit at the Father's Day BBQ, and I am the only veggie!

Unreal!  This dish is simply divine.  I have never rated a recipe until now, and this one deserves the rave reviews that it gets.   
I made it almost to spec, omitted the chipotle and added yellow bell pepper instead of green for more color.
This one goes into my all time favorite vegetarian dishes.  Flavorful, filling, colorful, whole food goodness!  Thanks Shauna for submitting this recipe!

This was fantastic, and on the first try too!  Healthy eating is new to my family, but my wife, my kids, and my kids' friends all *loved* this.  I mean, I'm getting requests from my daughter's friends to make this for them again so they can take some home with them.  They even offered to pay for the ingredients!

This was much better than the only other vegetarian chili recipe I've tried. I think the chipotle pepper added depth and warmth. I left out the jalapeno to suit my family's taste. I also had to leave out the red and green peppers, since my hubby can't eat them, so I should have added something else...Mexican chili powder maybe? I also think an 8-oz. can of tomato sauce and a can of sliced carrots would be great, but that's a matter of taste.

Despite the quibbles, I'm giving it 5 stars for introducing me to my favorite new product: quinoa! Thanks for the recipe!

Nice recipe, I added turkey, then the quinoa, it was super thick. I think adding both meat and grain was too much. I prefer it just as either a turkey chili or a quinoa chili, makes it a little bit runnier so you can slurp up the sauce with your jalapeno corn bread

Delicious! I threw everything in a slow cooker (omitting the oil), including uncooked quinoa (make sure to rinse quinoa if not pre-rinsed). I used 2 cups of chicken stock rather than water and canned corn rather than frozen. Cooked on low for at least 5 or 6 hours.

Holey Moley, this was fantastic! I made it per the recipe with only a few exceptions. Like many other reviewers, I cooked my quinoa in vegetable broth to give it more flavor. I added the juice of one lime after all other ingredients were simmering. Then I served it with sliced avocado and it was perfect. Rarely does my husband and 18yo son give me a two thumbs up for a vegan meal, but they did for this meal. I will be returning to this meal over and over again. I only wish I had found this recipe during football season!

The cardiologist said I need to eat better, but I loves me some chili so I tried this. I left out the corn and cooked the quinoa in sodium free beef broth. I like it quite bold so I upped the seasonings substantially, used low sodium salt and put in some of my secret chili ingredient (cocoa powder) and  if it didn't taste almost as good as . I also toasted the quinoa to bring out the nuttiness. I did add a little water several times to keep it from getting too thick. I don't know if that was omitted from the original recipe or because I added so much more dry seasoning. Also, to cut sodium I pur√©ed 6 Roma tomatoes in place of crushed tomatoes. Anyway, I'm gonna take some to my cardiologist in lieu of my copay next time!

I made this last night on the fly because I didn't put any meat out to thaw.  I had all the ingredients in pantry which is always a bonus.  I don't keep crushed tomatoes but used petite diced instead.  I also only used red pepper because green doesn't like me.  This came together very easily.  I did have to add about a cup of water to get the consistency I like.  I also did not put the quinoa into the chili instead I put it in the bottom of the bowl and ladled the chili on top.  This made a HUGE amount of food which surprised me.  Super economical to make.  It was very filling too.  The taste was spot on and the chipotle added a really nice smokey flavor to the dish.  The chipotle are spicy and I found I didn't need to add hot sauce to the dish which rarely happens.  Thanks for sharing such a great dish.  I will make this again for sure.  It exceeded my expectations and we did not miss the meat one bit.

This recipe was delicious and filling - my husband and I both loved it!  Made a couple of changes based on what I had available in my kitchen - I only had 1 can of black beans, so I added a can of kidney beans as well.  Yellow pepper instead of red, and I didn't have zucchini, jalape√±o, chipotle OR oregano so I added in one 4 oz can of green chilies and I felt like the flavor was good (especially since I prefer a less spicy chili).  Also, had canned corn instead of frozen on hand.  I feel like this is a fairly flexible recipe - using what I had it still turned out very yummy!  Will definitely make again.

I LOVE this recipe! I found the chipolte peppers in the section with taco stuff. I made a few small changes to accommodate my personal preferences (no corn, olive oil instead of vegetable, red quinoa cooked in chicken broth, no cilantro). The heat of this dish is awesome, next time I might add another jalapeno. In my opinion, this needs at least 2 cups of water. Loved it and will definitely make it again.

This was super yummy but too spicey for kids. I really enjoyed it but wished I could have made if for my daughter. I even left the jalapeno out.

It was really good before adding the quinoa.  The quinoa really tampered down the flavors and didn't add a whole lot.  Next time I make it I would use only 1/2 cup of quinoa.

I wasn't able to drain the quinoa, (no metal mesh strainer), but we both liked it quite a bit. Full chili taste without the beef.

I just recently adopted a whole food free from processed foods and gave this recipe a whirl.  It's fantastic.  I did make a few changes such as subbing the vegetable oil for heart-healthy olive oil and I added fresh chopped cherry tomatoes, fresh peas, and fresh sprouts while eliminating the zucchini, chipotle peppers, an cilantro (I didn't have any on hand!).  It required more tomato base to compensate for the extra ingredients but with slightly more fresh peppers and garlic, it was delicious!  I served it over red quinoa and have already made my second batch.   Hearty and healthy!

This is a great recipe! Quinoa is new to me so I needed somewhere to start. We love this version of vegetarian chili. I couldn't think of any improvements. Really good as the recipe is written.

Just made this for dinner. OMG so yummy...warning though, I kept the jalapenos out and halved the chili powder and it was the perfect amount of heat, a spicy, slow burn without overwhelming the other flavors :)

I'm rating this with only 4 stars because my son loved it, my husband said it was OK (could have used some meat), and I didn't like it because I don't like peppers.  Otherwise, it's a great recipe (based on Baby Boy's assessment!)

Healthy and delicious!
I too cooked my quinoa in chicken broth.  I omitted the bell peppers and jalapenos and added a can of green chilies.  I also just tossed in a can of corn.  I added a bit more garlic and cilantro.  This was my first time cooking with quinoa and I was pleasantly surprised.  Rinsing them did prove diffucult, as they are so tiny they go through any strainer I had on hand.  I just rinsed them in a measuring cup and strained the water through my hand.  
I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! All the yummy taste of chili with the light freshness of veggies. Loved it with a bit of cheese and crackers. 
Changed a few things based on what I had in the house. I'll be making this again and again.

This quinoa chili is amazing!  I made a few changes for my personal taste as well as what I had in the house.  This is just as good, if not BETTER than my turkey meat chili that is a staple in this house.  I'll return to this recipe in the future.

love it. Yum, yum. I added a bunch more veggies to get more into my kids. A good dollop of Greek style yoghurt on top to serve. 2 year old and 4 year old ate big bowls happily. Thanks for the post.

so, I think this would have been excellent, except my darling husband, when I asked him to please put in the rest of the ingredients, put the ENTIRE JAR of chipotle peppers in.. a bit too spicey for me, though I think we could handle more than just the tablespoon. I'll remake for sure!

Great recipe, but next time we will try it with half the quinoa. The Quinoa overwhelmed the vegetables a bit. Also love the idea of cheese on top, which i didn't see until after we ate.

This was delicious and a great/different take on chili. I did decide once I was adding all of the ingredients together that it was going to be too thick for my liking, so I added 2 cups of water witch chicken stock and I am happy I did. I also added 7 oz of tomato sauce. 
The chipotle peppers added a great smokey flavor to this recipe. I may even add a little more next time. 
I will definitely be making this again!

We prefer a saucier chili, so we added about 2 cups of tomato sauce to this. We also don't love cilantro, so we left it out.  The dish came out really well. I give it only 3 stars because we weren't really wowed or anything... it was just standard.

Tasty, easy to make, holds up well to reheating and fun to add in your own bits - mushrooms, scallion, whatever is in the fridge.

Delicious! I'm always looking for good veggie chili recipes and this one is one of the best! I added a poblano pepper because I had one in the fridge and sautteed the veggies in olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I would also add more of the chipotle peppers next time. Great recipe!

This was good. I was looking for a vegetarian chili since my mother is a vegetarian and this was a good choice, she really liked it.  It was really thick though and I would have liked it to be less thick.  If I make this again, I will add more stewed tomatoes.

Very easy to prepare and filling. My husband and I love spicy food, so, I did not seed the jalapeno and I added one whole chipotle pepper in adobo sauce which I think came up to slightly more than 1 tbsp. It turned out spicy, alright, and I like it very much. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderfully spicy and flavorful! I followed the recipe closely except that I omitted the bell peppers and made up for it by adding a little more minced Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. This will be a new family favorite I will make on a regular basis! I think next time I'll try serving it with avocado and lime. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is awesome.  I thought the peppers and spices were going to be overpowering but it's a perfect combination with the quinoa.  I added mushrooms and vegetable stock as well.  Delicious!

i adapted this a bit, for instance, i put way more chili powder and i put the whole can of chipotle peppers in it - maybe a bit too spicy but i still loved it.  next time i want to try cooking the quinoa in vegetable broth.  this is absolutely delicious!  so satiating and easy!  it came up as 10 servings (wow!) so i was able to freeze a lot of it and portion it to take to work for lunch.  what a great time saver and money saver.  and infinitely healthful!  one of my first ventures into cooking on my own and it was so good i feel so encouraged!  thanks!

Wonderful! I did not use the canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce since I am allergic to wheat and could not find one without it. Even so, it was still great and made lots of leftovers. 5 stars!

This was really good!  I didn't add the zucchini and jalapeno because I didn't have either, and left out the corn and cilantro (not big cilantro fans).  I'm not sure if the zucchini would have been a good addition or not, but I don't think it was needed. I used the sauce from the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, and wish I had used the chopped peppers as well.  It would have made it more spicy, which we like. The recipe didn't call for a specific amount of salt, but I would recommend somewhere between 1/2 to 1 tsp. of sea salt. Use half the salt to cook the quinoa and add the rest later. I will make this again.

So good! The quinoa adds a great texture and makes it 'meatier' than I was expecting. I recommend adding in some vegetable broth and don't be afraid to double or triple the adobo peppers if you like some heat!

I was surprised how many people thought there is meat in and when I told them it was completely vegetarian they loved it even more! I also modified this by adding a small can of tomato paste and a 3rd can of beans for a thicker & heartier chilli. Served with reduced fat sour cream....DELISH!

Delicious and so easy to make!  I have made this for company twice and was thoroughly enjoyed by all.  I used vegetable broth for the Quinoa and substituted a can of red kidney beans for one of the black.  I also left out the jalapeno the 2nd time and had significantly less heat.  We enjoyed it both ways!  Avocado and shredded cheese on the top were perfect!  This recipe also freezes well.

I was pleasantly surprised.  It didn't taste "healthy".  Husband and kid approved.  I added about 2 cups vegetable broth to make it soupier and a hint of lime.  Next time I think I would cook the peppers down with the onions as a personal preference for softer vegetables.

OK, but not a lot of flavor - especially since my family required that I not use the chipotle or jalepeno!  The texture was odd for something called "chili".  Mushy, maybe "polenta-like" to be nicer.  Any way to be creative with quinoa deserves our thanks, however.

Totally awesome!   Yum Yum.  I did make changes to use what I had on hand.  Did not use peppers or zucchini.  Added chili beans, carbonzo beans.  Did add cocoa, liquid smoke, and fire roasted tomatoes.  Definitely a keeper.

Really delicious. I didn't miss the meat at all! Add a spoonful of sour cream and it's even better!!! I didn't use the cilantro or jalapeno or chipotle peppers because I didn't have them, used canned corn and a mix of diced and stewed tomatoes and it was still fabulous!! Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! (PS Husband loved it too, and he's a meat eater.)

Wow I was surprised how yummy this turned out to be. I've always been hesitant because I thought quinoa would be bland, but this was great. I am no vegetarian, but I would make this over a meat chilli any day. Only variation I did based on other reviews was to cook the quinoa in chicken broth. With any quinoa dish I've made, that seems to make a world of difference with the taste. I used to use water then was put off quinoa for a long time because it was so bland.

It's a great healthy recipe but too spicy for me and just not the texture I like in a chili.  It sort of defeats the purpose of making a healthy recipe if I have to cover it in sour cream to be able to eat it.

With my recent quinoa obsession, I decided to try this recipe and fully expected my "chili must have meat" husband to just tolerate it. He actually really liked it, and the rest of us loved it. I left out the bell peppers and the jalapeno pepper and used a little more chipotle. Also threw in about a TBS of the adobo sauce. With 3 grown men and myself eating, the recipe was more like 6-7 servings. Served it with sharp cheddar, sour cream, and avocado. Super yum!

I left out the chipotle, replaced tomatoes with chili tomatoes, cut down the chili powder to two tsp., and the cumin to 1 tsp.  I didn't want it too spicy for the kids.  It went over well.

Oh my goodness!! My wife is normally the chef of the house but I made this recipe my own and I nailed it! I know this is a vegetarian chili but we're omnivores.  So I started with 1lb of lean ground beef, threw in the diced onion and cooked those together with some seasoning salt, cracked black pepper, and the garlic. I also used 2 cans of the tomatoes instead of the 1 the recipe called for so it would have for of a chili consistency. After that I had to start seasoning to taste so I'm not sure how much of everything I put in. Extra cumin, chili powder, some freeze dried garlic, a dash or two of the trader joe's brand season all, ground sea salt, and ground black pepper. I also substituted with red quinoa, added about a tbsp or so of sriracha, and the juice from 1 small lime (which is what made the dish). I served it over some homemade cornbread and oh my goodness!! Everyone loved it! Definitely making it again and again.

Excellent use of quinoa for a healthy, filling and tasty chilli. I found however, that hte proporations were a bit off - with one can of tomatoes and one cup of quinoa, the chilli came out more like a couscous and not as soupy as I like. I ended up adding two more cans of crushed tomatoes and the results were a family batch of excellent chilli. In the future though, maybe a half a cup of quinoa for smaller portions. I also didn't have chipolte so substituted bbq sauce for the smokey flavour - excellent!

We really liked this. I had to add quite a bit more liquid (I used veggie stock) as it was way too thick to simmer, but I really enjoyed the flavor.  I did use more than 1T of the chipotle in adobe sauce, more like 1/2 of the small can, but we like spicy.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe. It wasn't a hearty chili like I was expecting. It turned out a bit spicy and I think there was a too much quinoa. If I make this again, I will probably make some changes to the recipe.

Really great tasting and healthy recipe.  I didn't have fresh jalapeno so I chopped up some canned sliced ones which I think reduced the heat a bit but was still tasty.  Topped it with some shredded cheeses and served with tortilla chips. My fiance didn't even realize there was no meat in it until I told him after he polished off his second bowl.

As a vegetarian I was looking for a chili recipe with quinoa.  I was excited to try this recipe given all the rave reviews but I ended up being disappointed with it.  The dish came out very thick, almost like a quinoa pilaf with lots of other things missed in, rather than a chili.  I like my chili a little bit soupy but this was not, even after adding an additional 15-oz can of tomatoes!  The quinoa soaked up any available liquid.  If I were to make this again I would cut down dramatically on the amount of quinoa so that it would be an ingredient in the recipe but not the main focus of the dish.  Also, even though I followed the recipe it turned out surprisingly bland to me.  I had to add salt at the table to give it some flavor.

This was great!  I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth, didn't have zucchini, otherwise kept everything the same...served it with grated cheese and a little sour cream, yum!

This recipe is excellent!  I have made it a few times and have my version dialed in perfectly. I use low sodium/low fat beef broth instead of water to make the quinoa, I add an extra can of fire roasted tomatoes, little extra garlic and I double the chipotle/adobo amount to 2 tablespoons.  Huge hit in my family!

Just finished eating a bowl of hearty yummy healthy chili and now I have a happy belly and my husband, a meatlover, told me at the dinner table: "This is actually really good!" 
What more can I ask for?!

This recipe is great! Two things I changed were replacing the water with vegetable broth and adding a tsp. on cinnamon.  One hint to make this all a little easier is you can add the uncooked quinoa and water (or broth) at the same time you add the tomatoes and the rest of the ingredients. Bring it to a boil, turn in to low and cover and cook for about 15 min.  Turns out perfect!

Just made this today and it was easy and great.  My husband, whose favorite food is "meat," even liked it!  I made some adjustments like others who have reviewed the recipe.  I used one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans.  Also, since I do not like traditional bell peppers, I doubled up the zucchini and added one yellow squash too.  I used a couple of different "hot" peppers, but I took most of the seeds out, so the flavor wouldn't be too overwhelming and I cut up a little cilantro to balance it out.  Lastly, I added mushrooms too for additional thickness (I added them at the end with the quinoa and corn).  For garnish, I added shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Very satisfied!

This dish is delicious! My family of 6 are trying to limit our meat intake to once or twice a week. With dishes like this, it won't be a problem at all. I didn't tell my picky eaters (hubby and four kids) what it was until after and they didn't even realize it was meatless chili. The Quinoa in the dish really takes the the place of beef. I made the recipe with a few changes: used veggie broth to cook the quinoa, omitted the jalepeno peppers and only used 1/2 of the chipotle pepper. I also added some chicken broth after I put the quinoa in to loosen it up a bit. It is really thick as is.

Excellent recipe!  This was the first time I ever made chili and what a success.  I use to buy the canned chili which doesn't even come close to this one.  I ended up using kidney beans instead of black beans but I am sure using black beans is just as good.  This is a recipe I will continue to make.  Thank you for sharing.  All the best!

Made this for my husband and he loved it. I made a few changes based on what I had in the house.  I did not soak Quinoa.  I used organic.  increased chili powder to 1.5 tbls of Chili (Indian chili powder), and reduced black bean to 28oz black bean (can), no red pepper, 2 zucchini and 1 hot chili pepper.   I did not have chipotle pepper in adobe sauce so I left that out.  Left out oregano.    I used fresh jersey corn (as it was available).    I think you can make a number of changes to this recipe and it still would be excellent.

I had never had quinoa before, and I am not a big bean fan.  I found this meal to be fabulous!  The only thing I did was omit the chipotle peppers, and just added some adobo sauce.  My husband (who likes MEAT!) was also a fan of the dish - but he did stir in cheese.  I highly recommend this as a fall/winter meal to get lots of veggies and grains with a nice texture and taste.

Delicious!  Even my suspicious carnivore of a husband liked it and said he'd eat it again!  We used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies, plus a pepper and an onion for the vegetables.  Great way to eat quinoa!

I was looking for a new chili recipe to replace my old turkey chili.  My family loved it!  They didn't miss the meat.  I increased the chipotle pepper to 2 tablespoons because we love that flavor.  Wasn't too hot.  I used an orange pepper because I had one and left out zucchini.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy and good, topped with cheese, avocado, and light sour cream.   I Did add ground turkey as one reviewer mentioned but it would be just as good with out it.  The second day left overs were even tastier.

Wonderful chili with a nice smoky flavor!  I made it as directed and thought it was good enough to serve to even the most dedicated carnivore.  It was not a very brothy chili so if that is what you are looking for I would add an extra can of crushed tomatoes and adjust the seasonings accordingly.  Quick, healthy, and very gratifying‚Ä¶what is not to love about this chili?

This was great! Loved the flavor and texture. Though I skipped the jalapenos so my kids would like it. It was a little drier than I expected but we all still liked it. Next time I would add more tomatoes to the recipe. I did add a small can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos to the left overs the next night. Overall a great recipe.

My husband and I dont have the tolerance for spicy foods but this was really good.  Just really spicy.  If I could tone down the hotness then this would have so much flavor.  This tasted awsome.  First time cooking with quinoa and adobo chipotle peppers.  They are both really good.  We found this dish to be VERY filling.  So careful on the serving sizes.  Thanks for the post.

We found this to be very healthy and delicious.  The only slight alteration was 1 cup of vegetable broth in place of 1 cup of water in the quinoa.  Followed the recipe to a T beyond that slight change. This did make quite a bit which I divided and froze promptly for lunches.  It will come in handy I'm sure.  We will be repeating this one in the near future.

It was good, but not spicy enough for my tastes. I think maybe my spices are a bit old, so I'll definitely double them next time. Also, don't make a mistake like I did and use two 15oz cans of black beans-- this is definitely not enough! 5 stars because this is a great recipe and I think I ended up with a lack of flavor through my own fault.

Really good even if you‚Äôre not a vegetarian! I made multiple tweaks to this due to ingredient availability. I substituted the beans for red lentils and added ground turkey! The flavor in this is really surprisingly good! Will definitely make again!

My whole family really enjoyed this dish. I didnt have crushed tomatoes on hand, so I used one can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce. I also didn't have any zucchini or chipotle peppers, so I just omitted them. I'll definitely be making this again.

Delish!  Made this for my newly-vegan daughter and the whole family loved it. Though, it seemed way too thick even before the quinoa so I added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce (it could've used even more.)  The amount of quinoa seemed like too much, so I only stirred in about half of what I made - it was plenty, still overflowing with quinoa.  I also added a splash of lime for depth of flavor.  YUMMMM and sooo heathy!

No changes. Added some cheese and sour cream (a little bit) in the cup I ate.  Very tasty. Did use low sodium Black Beans.

Gave it 5 stars as I can tell it would be excellent as written, if you liked cumin and cilantro.  We are iffy on both and rather than bail on the recipe, I omitted cilantro and cut cumin down by half.  We still loved it!  Since we are not vegetarian, I cooked the quinoa in beef broth to add a little meaty flavour, so for those who can‚Äôt quite go vegetarian try beef broth.  This dish is a keeper for us.  The chipotle made it!

Tasty, filling, and healthy. Easy to make, perfect every time. Freeze the extra chipotle in adobo for next time. No one ever misses the meat! I live to top it with Greek yogurt (mixed with lime zest, salt and pepper), avocados, green onions, cheese, and serve with tortilla chips.

This is a great recipe!  I am new to the  vegetarian/vegan scene and have struggled  finding recipes everyone will eat.  This was a winner-my 3 year old dug in, and my hesitant 6 year old even loved it.  I adjusted the spices a little to suit our taste, but overall, it was a wonderful recipe.

This Recipe is so delicious and yummy! I would have given it 10 stars if I could. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing. It was a hit with my family and we all felt great after eating this healthier meatless and very filling Chili.Definitely making this again at least once a month!

Excellent hearty, healthy, gluten-free vegetarian dish.  Perfect for the winter and very tasty - makes 6-8 servings.  Generally followed the recipe but like others, I cooked my quinoa in vegetable stock and also needed at least 2 cups more stock  when I added the crushed tomatoes.  After adding the quinoa, I could definitely have used even more stock if I had it.  I did not add the jalapeno and found there was enough heat for us with the 1 Tbs of chipotle in adobo (I freeze the can in tablespoon dollops in a zip lock so always handy). Served with grated sharp cheddar, Greek yogurt and tortilla chips for dipping.  A keeper!

I added 1LB minced beef as Hubby is a meat lover, of course browned it first and excess the fat as much as possible. Saut√©ed one small chili, onion&garlic and spice, put them and set-aside beef together in slow cooker, along with other ingredients except quinoa, cilantro, peppers as peppers would get bitter if cooked too long.  Cooked on low for 4 hrs when I was at gym, added the rest, cooked on high for 1/2hr. Served with sour cream and corn dog casserole also from this site.  Hubby really likes it, however I found it was a bit bland for me so I added some chipotle Tabasco on my own plate.(Probably bcoz I didn‚Äôt add jalape√±o as I didn‚Äôt hv any on hand)  Anyway it was tasty and healthy, would be in my weekly rotation!

Made as the vegetarian option for a work "Chili Friday" and had more people eat this than some traditional with meat. Great healthy option, too! Left out the adobo peppers to keep it less spicy.

This was a second attempt to make a vegetarian chili that we liked and we finally found the one! Even my meat loving hubby enjoyed this chili and said he didn't miss the beef. I think the ingredients are what makes this vegetarian dish a hit,and the quinoa made it hearty. I used red quinoa and used canned green beans,instead of zucchini simply because we didn't have any. This is going to be apart of our meatless Mondays lineup.

This recipe is so easy and delicious!!  I used vegetable broth instead of water and left out the spicy peppers(just my personal preferences).  Using the vegetable broth just gives the quinoa more flavor.  I shared this with my friend for lunch and we ate the whole thing!  It was so good!

I make this at least a few times each month. It's versatile and almost any type of vegetables works well in this chili. I serve mine with corn bread, cheese, and sour cream.

I made this and shared some with a friend who immediately asked me for the recipe. I went totally lazy with it and made it in the slow cooker. I did not precook any of the veg or quinoa, and cooked on high for five hours, it was great! I just added the quinoa in dry and added in the veg broth I'd have used to cook the quinoa in with everything else. I used a can of Rotel rather than messing with the raw jalape√±o, and that worked out great, too. It didn't look terribly promising when I put it together, but by dinner time, it was super yummy, and kind of a lighter version of chili, good for a warmer day. It's going in the "keeper" file. Thanks for sharing!

We love this chili.  I try to make vegetarian a couple of times a week and this is one of the favorites.  I am on a feeding tube and "eat" the same things I make for my husband, just ground up in the blender, and this blends up beautifully.    I make homemade cornbread for a complete meal.

So this being my first vegan recipe, I was very skeptical. I've never been so glad to be so wrong. This chili was everything I wanted it to be. It is hearty and healthy and full of deep flavor with the spices added. I had to add about two cups of veggie broth because the quinoi soaks up a lot. I subbed the zucchini for green beams and used canned corn but results were amazing. So easy and quick with very little clean up. Would recommend to anyone looking for a healthy alternative.

it was good, but not outstanding.  very light.  my husband apparently can't live without animal protein so added chicken, but i liked it as is.  i added an extra chipotle pepper since we like flavor and spice.  it makes a ton so now we are eating through it.  i would cut it in half next time.

What a hearty and flavorful chili!  This recipe exactly as written is incredible!  However, it's very thick.  I've made it a few times now and have a couple minor adjustments.  First, I added a bit more of the chipotle peppers because I love the flavor. Second, I add either water or chicken stock to thin it a bit as it's so thick. And last, I serve with avocado.  Incredibly healthy and filling with the perfect amount of heat!

Absolutely love it! From the comments  I also used Ground Chipotle Chili Powder instead of regular chili powder.  Gives it a great flavor!

A breeze to make and absolutely delicious.  Never would have considered the fresh cilantro addition on my own.  It absolutely makes the chili pop.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I removed the zucchini, used half the amount of black beans.  I have chipotle chili powder instead just used 1tsp instead of chipotle and adobo sauce.  We love this recipe.

This is VERY filling and makes A LOT. I added two cups of water at the end because it was too thick for my liking. I also added a dollop of sour cream to each serving along with Mexican cheese prior to serving. Served with Tostitos scoop chips which was great. If I make it again I would probably added more tomatoes to make it less chunky.

First time trying a vegetarian chili. It was really good! We were going to make a big pot for dinner with friends who are vegetarians, but since our plans fell through we added some ground turkey for even more protein (we couldn't really even taste the turkey, so it easily can be left out). We like our chili a little less on the chunky side and more on the soupy side so we added three cans of tomato sauce, and cooked it in the crockpot for a couple of hours. With the added tomato sauce we also upped the chili powder. It came out delicious and there are a ton of leftovers, which we'll freeze for dinners later on.  The only thing I'd change is using less onion, which I found to overwhelm some of the bites a little bit, but that's a personal preference.

Omitted the cilantro due to family preferences, otherwise made it as is and it was amazing!! Kids and hubby loved it, definitely won't be going back to a version with meat.

SO DELICIOUS! I was excited to try this recipe because of all the veggies in it. I'm not a vegetarian but this chili was so hearty and filling! I'm not a fan of spicy foods so I omitted the spicy peppers. I can't wait to make this recipe again, it's my favorite that I've ever made!

I liked this recipe a lot, but I had to make some changes to it. The recipe as written is way too thick. You can see from the ingredients that the only liquid is one can of crushed tomatoes (the water listed is only for cooking the quinoa). For a recipe that filled half my stock pot, that was not even close to enough. I had to add another 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, a can of diced tomatoes, and a can of broth before it got to the right consistency.

I was a huge fan of this. I was looking for something healthy and filling, and as a big meat lover, I've been looking for a satisfying soup/stew/chili without meat, which honestly, I questioned if possible. I made this as the recipe called except I took the suggestion to cook the quinoa in reduced-sodium chicken broth. I was not disappointed, and I will be making this again.

This is the most delicious chili recipe I've ever had the pleasure of eating. It has delicious and round flavors but isn't spicy. Additionally I added some ground beef and added cheese to my bowl.

I have made this at least 3 times and it is easily my favorite, go-to chilly weather comfort food. Even though it doesn't include meat, which I know a lot of people feel is a requirement for chili, the quinoa does a great job of filling in and filling you up. I love the combo and variety of veggies, making it a healthier option for those who love chili. I like to serve it with a chunk of baguette, perfect for dipping.

"Chili" is a deceiving term for this dish, the texture and consistency is just not chili-esque. I might instead think of this as a warm Tex-Mex quinoa bowl. And it's pretty tasty by those standards. A reasonable chili alternative for vegetarians or vegans (with some obvious modification).

We loved this!  I don't know where quinoa has been all my life.  ( we did leave out adobo and jalape√±o pepper, but still it was just spicy enough for mild tummies).

We are a family of red meat eaters, I forgot to thaw out anything for dinner and chose this recipe as an alternative.  I am in love!  I had to leave out the zucchini and corn because I didn't have any - other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Full of flavor, very filling and my whole family adored it!  It was simple and we are impressed.  This is a five star recipe and one that we will embrace happily if we forget to thaw out meat again!

This was so hearty and perfect for a cold day. I skipped the green pepper, added 1/4 red bell pepper and 2 yellow squash instead of zucchini. Topped with nonfat Greek yogurt- delicious!

This is an amazing recipe! I did add my own little touches of course. First I used all organic ingredients. I also omitted the zucchini and the corn. I saut√©ed the veggies all together instead of separately, added some of the bean liquid and then the spices. Then I added the tomatoe sauce and beans. I also added a little cayenne for some more heat. I used rainbow quinoa and cooked it with some saut√©ed onions and garlic and used half chicken broth half water for more flavor. I simmered the chili for about 35-40 mins total. The chili was topped with spinach, tomatoes, avocado and some shredded cheddar cheese. Absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I are newer to quinoa and he was avoiding this dish since it was meatless but when I finally made it he loved it!

This is seriously amazing! I didn't have all the ingredients. I didn't have black beans so i used red beans but only 1 can. And I don't use veggie oil instead I use coconut oil. But besides those minor alterations it was amazing. I did however saut√© all the veggies together because I like mine more mushy. I'd suggest that way. It was super simple to make and very versatile.

If I could I would rate it 4.5 stars but it doesn't seem fair to downgrade the recipe.  It's a great base to customizing your own chili.  I loved the inclusion of the quinoa.  It made it so hearty.  My only suggestion would be to saut√© the peppers with the onion.  One reviewer said she liked the crunchy but that is not my thing so I softened them up before adding the other ingredients.

Delicious.  My husband thought it a bit spicy and that's with the jalapeno left out.  :)  My cilantro was bad so I couldn't use it but will make again.

This is our favorite chili recipe! My husband needs a high-fiber diet so this meal fits the boot. Makes us about 6 servings. We usually serve it with sour cream if that's all we're eating, but usually when we have it as leftovers we put it in our tacos & it's fabulous. I've made it about 5 times, and the last time I didn't have zucchini so I used a cucumber instead & we liked it even better. Thanks for the great recipe :)

This was outstanding! I omitted the zucchini and added an extra bell pepper. It was very substantial! It yielded a ton and probably could feed a crowd! Tremendous flavor, straightforward, one of the best chili recipes yet! This was worth it!

I made this for the first time with the intention to make something healthy AND that my boyfriend would like and this was a hit. I read a lot of the reviews and this is what I ended up doing: 1. Clean quinoa thoroughly, draining it till water ran clear, which took a few minutes. 2. Soaked it while cutting veggies 3. Cut whole onion, a bunch of cilantro (more than a cup cus we love the stuff), cut two whole tomatoes and seasoned two can of black beans with a little adobo - All while saut√©ing the onions till they got brown. 4. Added garlic after onions were brown for a few mins then added the quinoa and seasoned. 5. Added chicken broth and simmered. 6. Added a little more cilantro and cayenne pepper then added frozen sweet corn (which was thawing while I was cutting veggies) after 18 mins of quinoa cooking for five more mins7. Added two cups of beans (which I really liked and it was a great balance - I read a lot of people used only one can) 8. Simmer for five more mins and served it with Korean flavored BBQ chicken on top of tortilla with kale and American cheese (sort of like a burrito). Yummmeeeee. We have leftovers for days but I'm looking forward To it.

A yummy soup with the healthy vegetables for nutrients, quinoa for protein and bulk, and beans for fiber and protein.  I like that there is no meat, and of course one could choose to add meat if they wanted.  I added a small bit of sour cream to my serving and crumbled up tortilla chips on top.  A winner in my book.  The flavors are subtle, which is how I like it.  You can add heat with extra peppers or ground cayenne pepper, tabasco, etc.

Fantastic Recipe! Tons of flavor; very healthy and filling, and not salty at all. I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't miss the meat at all. I really like all of the veggies here; and this is a great way to introduce quinoa to those who don't particularly care for the flavor when served plain. My husband really doesn't like quinoa, but he didn't mind it in here at all! This is very thick and hearty, and makes plenty of leftovers! I saved some for the next day, and froze the rest. Highly recommend--give it a try!

Cut this down to 5 servings, used olive oil and wonderful (inexpensive) canned diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Tasty, filling, and muy flavorful.

This recipe won most original at a chili party we go to every year...came out VERY good with a few additions...I added sun-dried tomatoes,a little balsamic vinegar, dark chocolate and chicken broth (too thick) I also followed someone's suggestion to cook the quinoa in chicken broth which I'm sure could be done with veggie broth..LOVE IT!!

easy and great tasting!  Love all the veggies in it.  I'm not a green pepper fan so I used an orange one in place of the green and with the red pepper, yellow corn, black beans and green of cilantro it's a spectacular looking dish!  Had a little heat which was great.  Have recommended it a number of times already.

I adapted this recipe to use what I had on hand.  Used one small multi-color pepper and chopped carrots to replace the zucchini and other peppers.  I also didn't have a jalapeno pepper or chipotle in adobo, so I just increased the chili powder to about 2-3 tbsp.  I used canned corn and no oregano, salt or pepper.  I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, a bit less garlic and dried bean salad mix instead of black beans.  I was a little worried at first that it wouldn't taste good, but this is really delish topped with grated cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.  YUM!

I have made this dish several times. My family loves it but I had to make a few changes. I omitted the corn and the adobo sauce. I noticed there wasn't much liquid so I served it on tostadas topped with cheddar cheese and sliced avocado.

Very interesting dish.  I wasn't sure I was going to like it but wanted an alternative to meaty chili so gave the recipe a try.  I followed the directions as stated but added a pinch of cayenne pepper and used the original Rotel crushed tomatoes. What an incredible flavorful dish...it's very tasty and very spicy...definitely a winner!!

5 stars for something so healthy that tastes so good! Only change I made was to sub a quart of homemade tomato sauce instead of the can of crushed toms. I was leery of the zucchini but couldn't even tell it was in there. None of my boys noticed the meat missing, I could. Texture is different that usual chilli but it didn't taste that different. Was too spicy for one of my boys and I think that came from the chipotle and jalapeno. Next time I will leave out the jalapeno and use less chipotle. Like others who reviewed this,I would usually cook quinoa in broth. With all the flavour going on in this chilli, cooking the quinoa in water is fine. Save yourself the sodium intake. This is a must try if you are looking for a meatless dish.

I love this recipe!  I never added the peppers b/c they were always sold out at my grocery store.  This recipe is awesome!  I'm sure even better with peppers :)

It was yummy! 
I added 1 1/2 lbs of ground chuck. Instead of zucchini I added yellow squash. I cooked quinoa in beef bouillon to give it extra flavor. I added 1 can of rotel  Tomatoes. I used can corn instead of frozen and I also added a can of tomato sauce. My hubby said this is totally a keeper. We will add to our recipes to re-make. We made some cornbread to go with. It was awesome!!!

Amazing recipe. Hubby and 2 year old toddlers loved it. Great vegetarian option for the busy weeknights! Will definitely make this one of our regular meals!!! I added extra garlic and used chiptole chile powder and smoked paprika - to tone down the spiciness for the little ones. Shredded some sharp cheddar on top. It turned out absolutely delicious.

This turned out so well.  Our reluctant vegetarian was so pleased with the texture and taste.  We removed the corn, because, well, corn doesn't belong in chili. After tasting, we added a can of diced tomatoes and some shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  To serve, we topped it with sour cream and some more cheese.  We'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious flavors.  I made this recipe just as directed.  It was a little too hot (spicy) for my family.  So make adjustments where necessary.  I would suggest halving the jalapeno for starters.

Really enjoyed this recipe!  I didn't have any oregano and added extra chipotle/adobo (as I enjoy those flavors) ... it was great!  Served with sliced avocado, no cheese.; kept it vegan.  It is very thick and spicy!  Those who don't like as much spice might want to eliminate the jalapeno and use diced green chili instead. But please, don't skip the chili powder or chipotle.  I can assure you, any reviews that describe this chili as "bland" surely eliminated one or both of those things.  Enjoy!

Delicious! Loved these spices with the quinoa, black beans and veggies. I decided to use 2 cans of tomatoes instead of 1 to make it more smooth and moist. I also added about 2 tbsp. of fresh garlic. My husband finally didn't mind a "vegetarian" chili! Yay!

This is my new favorite chili!  The quinoa is great.  We make it in the rice cooker before adding it to the chili.  Couldn't be easier.  I love the added protein for my veggie kids.  
One thing we noticed (we've made this twice) was that the zucchini gives this a strange feeling when it's in chunks. Diced wasn't small enough, so the second time we shredded it.  This was perfect.  I could eat this every week.  Of course, we do serve it with a little sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese. Probably kills the calorie count, but it's sooo good.  :)

Amazing! This recipe is a keeper. I will certainly make it again. This time I did not add chipotle peppers or corn. The recipe does yield a lot of food - I took it to a pot luck so that was great. Everyone (including the meat eaters) really enjoyed it!

This was an excellent veggie chili recipe! I cooked the quinoa in veg broth and added a cup or two to the chili to thin it out. I also left out the zucchini, as I do not care for it, and substituted diced green chilis for the chipotle pepper since that's what I had available. I will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely amazing. It had the perfect amount of spice, and was really flavorful. Out of personal preference, I took out the zucchini and added carrots instead. I also added an extra can of tomato soup and a bit of water as it was really thick. Came to a perfect consistency. Will definitely be making this again in the future, thanks for an amazing recipe.

I decided to make this just from what I had in my pantry, so that said... it differs a bit from the original, but turned out really, really good!   I also cooked my quinoa in vegetable broth rather than water, for extra flavor.  I added 1/2 t smoked paprika to the spices.  I cut back the chili powder & cumin to approx. 1/2 T each, as it seemed like it would be too much.  I used the diced tomatoes that have green chilies in them and just 14 oz (all I had on hand).  I supplemented the rest of the tomato with about 16 oz of vegetable (V8) juice.  I used 1 can kidney and 1 can black beans.  I had no green bell pepper, so only used red.  Had no zucchini on hand, so left it out.  Had no jalapeno or peppers in adobe sauce on hand, but did have a jar of medium heat salsa verde, so put in about 1/2 cup of that to get some spice.  We topped ours with sour cream and cheddar cheese... Considering I did this completely with what I had on hand, it turned out great and the recipe gave me the inspiration to make a great dish!

Delicious!   Very hearty and healthy.  I used Chiplotle powder instead of the chiplotle peppers and 3 jalapenos instead of one.  I also added about 1 cup water as it was so thick, it was impossible to simmer, otherwise. Very tasty and highy recommeded.

This recipe came together quickly as I had some leftover quinoa in the fridge already!  Delicious, fast, and hearty.  I added a combo of red kidney beans and garbanzos as well as black beans (1 cup total) as well as a little salt and pepper.  Boosted the chili flavor with an additional teaspoon of cumin and chili powder. Didn't have any jalapeno or chipotle peppers but that was fine with me as I am a wimp and don't like my chili very spicy. I imagine this recipe would be even better with them!

I've been on this site a long time, but never reviewed anything before.  This was the best chili I've ever made!!  So filling, gluten free, and it tastes great!  A little bit of strong cheddar and fresh avocado make a great garnish.

I bought a giant bag of quinoa a while back and have been trying to find some new ways to fix it. This has to be the best way I've found to cook quinoa yet! I followed the other suggestions and fixed the quinoa in vegetable broth to give it a little more flavor, but otherwise I followed the recipe as stated. I will be making this again. Delicious!

I give this a 5 because it is a great recipe that you can tweak based on the ingredients you have in your fridge and pantry. I added to this recipe a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes and sweet italian sausage and both my husband and I loved it and he is not a huge chili person. I didn't have any chipotles in adobe sauce on hand and used chipotle chili powder. I also swapped the zucchini for an extra cup of frozen corn because it's what I had on hand. This will definitely become a winter staple at our house.

Made this recipe yesterday. I was looking for a recipe that used quinoa and came across this one.  It has a really great flavor and overall I enjoyed it.  However, I did feel like it need a bit of crunch, so I am starting to think of other things to serve it with and will probably try something other than zucchini next time.  I think the zucchini added to the "mush" factor.

Great recipe for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  Adjustments I made: added 1 can of mushrooms (drained), added about 1.5 cups of water to get the consistency I like, added 1 Knorr chipotle cube.  Used 1 can kidney and 1 can black beans (just for variety).  I skipped the corn, jalapenos and chipotle. 
This is my go-to chili recipe now!  Thank you!

Excellent!  Made this recipe for a vegetarian option for a birthday party (we had meat chili too).  Everyone loved it.  I used the chicken stock to prepare the quinoa as someone had recommended.  I also used fire roasted diced tomatoes, and added some fresh tomatillos from the garden with the zucchini and used green onions rather than regular.  Finally, i used an extra poblano chili seeded and diced!  Great recipe, very filling and good for leftovers too.  Really easy if you do all of your chopping ahead of time!

This is such a great recipe.  So good!  Even my husband said it was the best chilli he's ever had.  I didn't feel like going to the store so I had to make a few subsitutions.  I didn't have caned tomatoes so I used a couple fresh ones and (ha) a 1/4 cup of jarred pasta sauce to give it that tomatoey texture.  I also used one can pinto and one can black beans.  No bell peppers or chipotle but plenty of Jalapenos and Zucchini.  Few squezes of lime!  Such a great recipe, even with all the subsitutions it was amazing!

very good. next time I would put a little less tomato and a little more beans. Still, it is very good. The flavors blend very nicely. It's a good Fall/Winter meal. :)

Really good. Added some ground turkey and a little more spice (ground cloves).  Just wish recipe listed the actual serving size instead of 1/10.
