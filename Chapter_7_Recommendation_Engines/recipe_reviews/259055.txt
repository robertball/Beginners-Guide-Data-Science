The peanut butter sauce is outstanding. Pancakes are very good also. Overall a very tasty recipe.

These actually turned out better than I thought they would be. There were not as sweet as I thought. I think kids would love these the morning after a sleepover.  I wouldn't make these every time I made pancakes, but they're a fun treat.

Outstanding!! I used extra chocolate chips instead of M&M's.  We had pomegranate jelly syrup instead of the peanut butter one, kind of a PB&J breakfast!
