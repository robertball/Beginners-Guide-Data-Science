Wowee, this is so rich and good!!! 
I followed the recipe as written, though the head of cauliflower I used was small, so I did not use quite all of the butter & mayo mixture.
I cooked it along with some pork chops, so it was at 350 for about 30 minutes.
I really liked this one!!

Really good! I cut corners and used a bag of thawed frozen veggies. Next time I'll cook the veggies a little more so they go in the oven warm.

I had all the ingredients on hand and wanted to have a solid meal highlighting these veggies. I used applewood smoked bacon. I added mushrooms when sauteing the onion and had a flavored mayonnaise that I only used half of. It turned out really wonderful!
