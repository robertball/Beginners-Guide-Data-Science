Ok, this "recipe" seems simple enough, I know. However, the proportions are key as not to get too much of one thing. This recipe does it. The only thing I will do differently the next time is to chop the almonds before mixing. This will help you grab a balanced handful. With the almonds being larger than the sunflower seeds and heavier than the coconut, you end up eating them separately. Also, I added some cocoa bits...purely medicinal though. :-) Thank you for sharing this with us.

Very good, I used coconut chips in place of shredded coconut. My sunflower seeds were salted but my almonds were not, the salt level was good this way.
