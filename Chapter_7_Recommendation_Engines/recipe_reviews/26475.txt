Excellent recipe!!!  My husband does probably 99.9% of the cooking in the house because he loves to do it and he's MUCH better at it than I am.  I decided to make this for him and he loved it!  Since I made it, and he loved it, I know that this is truly a winner!

I was a little scared of all the spices but I followed the recipe ingredients to the letter.  I prefer the chicken to be tender so I fried it in olive oil and a little cajun pepper at the end of the process and added to the chili last.  The results were GREAT!!  Yummy!

This was really tasty with a dollop of sour cream. Loved it! I also added a can of corn and blended 2 of the cans of beans for a thicker soup. Plus I substituted jalapenos for the chiles because I love hot stuff! I might use less broth next time (ended up simmering for much longer to boil off some of the liquid). Either way, really great flavor!

Oh so good! I mostly followed the recipe but I forget to get thyme and couldn't find any bay leaves. I used two small cans of green chiles instead of fresh.  I added a liberal amount of hot sauce, and about 3 tablespoons of diced jalapenos. Perfect amount of spicy! I also used a variety of white beans. Pinto, great northern, and  cannellini.

We loved this recipe.  I had to make a few alterations when I didn't have exactly everything needed.  I used 1 can no-salt mushrooms, drained.  I cooked the chicken on my Foreman grill, but sautéed the rest of the vegetables.  I didn't have green chilies so I used 2-4 oz. cans, somewhat drained, and I didn't have any red pepper.  I used A LOT more broth, besides the 2-14 oz. cans, I used 1 large can.  I cooked everything in the slow cooker all day and then served each bowl with some shredded cheese and a small dollop of sour cream.  Also served with cornbread.  Oh yeah, I also added some extra cumin to the recipe to make up for all the broth I had added.

This chili is excellent.  I used my food processor to grind the chicken breast.  I made this for my father who does not like chicken and will not eat it.  He loved it and asked for more!

This is really good.  I added a dried chipotle chile that was blended with the stock and omitted the mushrooms, just because I did not have any.  My guests asked for the recipe. A dollop of sour cream tops it off beautifully.  I served it with tortilla chips.

Great recipe! We did add the corn as suggested for some of these white chili recipes and reduced the amount of chicken broth to try to thicken the chili to make it more substantial and less like a soup. It worked perfectly and we really enjoyed it. We will make it again!

This soup takes a long time to prep, and the final result was disappointing. We followed the recipe exactly.  I felt that the oregano did not marry well with the other flavors. My husband said the chicken tasted like boiled chicken. Kids didn't enjoy it either. Sorry, just not to our liking.

This soup was pretty good. The flavor was good, however i thought it was missing something. Maybe some diced tomatoes, or some carrots. I am still giving it 5 stars because my husband usally does not like soup and he loved this.

Good flavor, considering I'm not a big fan of broth-based soups.  On the other hand, hubby loved it.

I made a few changes.... Added some cheese and milk to make it creamy. It was more like soup but the taste was great! Will make it again for sure!

This was a very good base for White Chili.  I did make it my own way, as most of us do.  Here are my alterations: I used 2 cans of white kidney beans; I omitted the wine, rosemary, red bell pepper, green onion, mushrooms and bay leaves; I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a lot of frozen corn.  And I coated the chicken in flour and corn starch before browning.  That helps to thicken up the stew and keeps the chicken nice and tender.

I don't cook much, but in looking for a chili recipe I found this.  It was very good.  I used one less can of chicken broth, and let it simmer for 2 1/2 hours instead of 90 minutes until it totally reduced to "chili" instead of "soup".  Very yummy. My husband added some sour cream and hot sauce to his.  I may try jalapenos next time.

It was really good. I've never modified a recipe before but felt inclined only because the soup color looked more like a broth soup rather than a chili. So i used 2 cans of pino beans and one can of spicy chili beans. I drained the chili beans so it wouldnt tint the soup red. At the end of the recipe after it had been cooking for an hour i mixed up some campbells cheddar soup with milk in a separate pot.. Then mixed the cheddar soup into the chili. It gave the soup more of a creamy texture. One of the best soups Ive ever made!

Just made this recipe tonight with the girlfriend - had some variations.  Skipped the mushrooms and beans (don't like), the white wine (all our wines were red), and the chilis (couldn't find).  Added about a cup of water as we were afraid of it being too dry.  The water was a mistake - would've been fine without.  Served with cornbread and fried potatos.  I highly recommend this, even though it isn't very "white".  Thanks for the recipe.

LOVED IT! I thought this was great, flavors were wonderful. I made almost exactly to the recipe, changes: no rosemary or mushrooms(don't like), added 1/3 yellow pepper, and 1/2 cup milk at the end, to make it a little creamy. It was really good. I may try it over rice next time, but just as good by itself. I am looking forward to making this again, soon.

This worked out pretty good for me.  I substituted cilatro for the parsley for more bite.  Something I did differently was to take one(1)liquid cup of the chili out of the pot after mixing all the ingredients, blended it down, then returned it to the pot.  It really helped thicken it to a chili consistency. I served it with spinach gorgonzola cornbread.  It was good the first day, but even better the second for lunch.  Would make again.

This was great!! The family really loved it and that's what is all about, right? My husband Loved it the most!! Anyway, I just made a couple of changes, no mushrooms (didn't seem to fit the recipe to me) and used white beans instead of pinto beans.  I also added some cilantro along with the parsley both fresh.  Thank you

I had never had White Chili before, this is incredibly good. My husband says that "for now" he prefers it to red chili.  I made this twice in less than a month, once for my family and once for a party.  It was a hit at both!  I made a couple of changes the second time I made it: 1. Puree one can of the white beans in the food processor to make the chili creamier without added calories of sour cream. 2. Used 2 cans of chilis instead of fresh chilis 3. Added about 1/2 tsp of cayanne pepper for some added zip.  This is a total keeper of a recipe!

I have made this before and the remedy for the broth being too thin is to add one or two cans of cream of chicken soup or any canned soup that may compliment the mexican spices. I have also used a can or 2 of the cheese based soups that campbells makes. It thickens it up nicely and makes a creamier soup base. My family and friends LOVE it!! I serve it with fritos, sour cream and grated cheddar cheese.

Great tasting chili!  Delicious in fact.  I left out the red bell pepper and only used a can of green chilies and a jalepeno.  You may want to start with only 1 can of broth as it seems to be a bit runny.

Great recipe! I use great northern beans and puree 1 can. I also usually use 2 cabs of chopped grenn chilis if I don't have fresh ones. Delicious!

Made this last night and it was fantastic!  Now, to everyone who thought this was too soupy - it's supposed to be soupy!  The flavor is in the liquid!  I used two cans of diced green chiles instead of fresh only because I didn't like the looks of the ones in my grocery store that day.  Also reduced the mushrooms to about a half package, diced, and that seemed like plenty for me.  Same with the parsley: 1/2 - 3/4 bunch.  With the beans I used one can of pintos, one cannellini, and one great northern.  I seasoned the chicken with Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Pepper Blend and sprinkled a liberal amount in the chili as it simmered.  Went a little heavy on the cumin too since we like it.  Topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese.  All my guys thought this was a great meal for a cold day.  Froze the one serving that was left over.  Bonus: My husband and I agreed that this could very easily be a vegetarian dish.  I really don't think the chicken added to the flavor.  Next time, I'll just throw in some extra beans or soup pasta.

This one is a good White chili too. I've tried several but this is the first with the mushrooms...I think they could be optional for my husband. But I loved it!

Great recipe!!  I left out the wine and replace 1 can of pinto beans with a can of Cannellini beans.  My wife was skeptical about it and she really liked it!

Great flavor and a terrific alternative to regular chili!  I highly recommend this soup.  I cooked it without the chicken and added a can of navy beans to the recipe.  I also added in chili pepper and extra cumin.  Serve with sour cream and it is sure to be a hit!

I'm making this one again.  It tastes similar to the White Chicken Chili at Ruby Tuesday's, only better.  Worth the effort of putting together.

I made this dish over the weekend and it was an instant hit. I have a picky family of eaters BUT this chili was an absolute hit. There was enough leftover for one bowl. And I brought that to work with me for lunch. Yay me. 

I would recommend using gloves when handling/cutting up the chilis. 

Very delicious chili recipe!!

LOVED IT!  My bf went crazy for it too.  I left out the mushrooms since I ran out of room in my pot.  I also used cilantro instead of parsley and frozen green chili instead of fresh.  It was absolutely delicious.

yum! I did make some modifications. I heated up the olive oil with some chicken broth and essentially poached the chicken, and then shredded in the pot with two forks. I added a handful of dry pasta (what was left from a box of ziti) and some frozen corn near the end, and allowed it to cook down for 30 more minutes; the starch from the pasta and its absorption of the liquid thickened up the chili to a very nice stew-like consistency. Overall, I probably simmered the chili for almost 3 hours. Could do in a slow cooker too.

Great recipe.  I used fresh herbs, northern beans instead of pinto, and left out the mushrooms.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Yummo.

This is so good! It's one of those recipes you instantly want to share with family/friends. I only made 2 changes to the recipe - omitted rosemary (couldn't find mine) and subbed cooking sherry for the white wine (didn't have any). Even with these changes, it was fabulous! It cooks down to almost no liquid, so I suggest adding more chicken broth - maybe half a can to a whole can depending on how you like your chili. Fans of crumbled cracker or tortilla chips in the bowl will for sure want the extra liquid.

Is this chili ever GOOD!! I made it for a chili competition I was hosting, I didn't enter it because I was afraid no one would like it so instead made it for "fun".  Well let me tell you, EVERYBODY raved about how good it was and said it should have been entered.  The only changes I made was to use 1lb ground turkey instead of chicken breasts for a more chili consistency. I used 2 cans white kidney beans instead of 3 pinto and I also added a cup of frozen corn. I simmered it as long as a regular chili and it had the same think consistency of a regular chili. Not soupy at all. VERY GOOD!!

Awesome! Left out the red pepper, white wine, mushrooms, and parsley. Used more green chiles. Turned out great. Served it with a crusty french garlic loaf.

I thought this was just okay. I've made a couple of other white chicken chili recipes, and one of them was better than this. I made it exactly as written, but I found the addition of mushrooms, and especially the whole bunch of parsley, to be too unusual in a "chili" for my taste. It was good enough, mind you, and probably fairly healthy with the lean protein and all the veggies, but it just didn't wow me. It lasted me for 4 days, but I probably won't be making this again.

I made this wonderful soup with some variations because I didn't have canned beans or parsley... I used cooked dry beans and cilantro instead. The prep time was a bit long but I thought it was well worth it, the spices were just right.... true comfort food for a cold winter's night with a slice of homemade garlic bread on the side... delicious!

I have made it as written which is pretty good this the 4-star rating. Here’s the changes I made which I prefer:
