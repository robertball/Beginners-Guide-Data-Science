I've tried this recipe twice now because the first time it was way too salty. The second time I made it I used not even 1 teaspoon. I like salt don't get me wrong but with prawns you don't need a whole lot. I also used half the butter. Other than that the recipe is simple and tasty. I will use it again.

This is so delicious and totally simple!! Only one change...DON T use as much salt as the recipe calls for it s way too much!!! Just use to taste. Also it's excellent if you pour the oil and butter from the pan over some Orzo Pasta (the one that looks like rice) and serve that along with the Prawns! Thanks for the recipe!!

We really liked these. Really quick and easy to make. Great for an appetizer or a main course. The only reason these don't get 5 stars is the amount of butter. It can really be reduced by a considerable amount. I followed the recipe exactly and I had at least a 1/2 cup of butter left after the meal was done. We really enjoyed it though. Thanks for posting the recipe. Will definitely use again just cut the butter down.

Very good. I did everything like the recipe calls for except instead of sauteing them I broiled the shrimp. Served on top of hot Parmesan pasta.

First review ever! These were funtastic! True enough that there must be a typo and only 1 to 2 teaspoons salt is required - also consider if you are using 'salted' butter. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars! (I've been cooking long enough to realise that the salt quantity was way to much)

Delicious! Made it into a meal (as opposed to finger food) by tossing in a couple handfuls of frozen peas at the same time as the prawns, and serving over bow tie pasta. Oh, and only used a 1/2 c butter (plenty) and cut the salt way back...only used about a quarter/half teaspoon.

I made this today and loved it. It's a nice, simply way to cook prawns. As many reviewers have said, I left out the salt. The author said to add a side of vegetables if you want to make it a main meal. I wasn't sure how to do that or what would work, but I ended up going for spring onions and red and green peppers. I just mixed them in with the prawns and butter. I'm really pleased with how well that turned out - delicious and healthy!

I took a star because I believe the amount of salt in the recipe to be a typo! No salt just use salted butter and this is totally 5 stars! Super easy super fast and so delicious! I've used this recipe to cook rock fish and it was awesome! This has become my go-to recipe for sea food.... That is minus the salt.

I used this as a base receipe.  Added pasta water, chicken broth a few red pepper flakes, a bag of steamed mixed vegetables and some frozen peas.  Once plated I sprinkled some grated Parmesan and it was a big hit with the family. Easy Peasy and tasty!
