This was good....I still prefer pecan!  :)  But, I just had to try it for fun.  I did cut down on the sugar and was still plenty sweet.  Used the dark corn syrup and it seemed to have given it a nice flavor.  Thanks for a good recipe, Karin C.!

This was really good. I wouldn't say it was just like a pecan pie but it is very close. I had to sub brown sugar for the white since I was out. Also added 2 t of vanilla. Oh and I used Old Fashioned oats since that is what I always buy. This was really quick to put together. Thanks for the recipe.

I couldn't find corn syrup anywhere(it's not common over here) so I used a cup of honey and some aditional sugar(dissolved in a bit of water) as substitutes. Since honey browns faster I cooked it for less than 30 minutes(otherwise the upper part would burn), and it turned out great. Very moisty inside, but I love it that way. Thanks for sharing.

This was the first time I have ever eaten or baked an oatmeal pie, but my husband loves them so I decided to give it a shot for Thanksgiving. It turned out very well and was super easy to make. Some people really liked it, some hated it. It does taste similar to pecan pie, and I thought it was good served with whipped cream.

This recipe is what I was looking for. I live close to Amish country and it is just like they make it. The only thing is I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

Excellent and EASY!!!  I added some spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg) and baked at 375 for 40 - 45 minutes.  Came out perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Amazing!  I made this on a whim to use up some corn syrup and when I put it on the desert table - i noticed 1 piece missing.  When I turned around again, it was gone.  I do use a little cinnamin and nutmeg, but otherwise it's a perfect recipe - one I have never messed up!

Made a couple of changes because we are used to a pie that we buy at a restaurant in Ohio:
Added 1/2 cup flaked coconut and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  The recipe doesn't specify, but I used dark corn syrup.
I love this pie because it tastes very similar to pecan pie but my husband loves it because he says it tastes nothing like pecan pie!
