Pickled jalapeno rings are one of my most favorite things. I've always wanted to learn how to make them--this recipe made it possible. I added some crushed red pepper, that was the only change I made. I did not add the jalapeno peppers to the saucepan, I went ahead and put them in the canning jar and once the vinegar mixture came to a boil, I poured it over the peppers in the jar, put a lid on it and let it sit like that for ten minutes before refrigerating. I have not used them yet as I want them to sit in the vinegar for a week or two to really get good. I'll update my review once I've had a chance to try them. Five stars for this recipe for just being awesome. I am so tickled I could make my own. VERY easy.

This is an excellent recipe, as is. I have made it a couple of times now, adding bite size pieces of onion and bell peppers, to fit the chips (actually, reduced fat triscuits) I use for nachos. I won't be buying the ready made jars of slice jalapenos anymore. It's couldn't be much easier. Thnx Chef John!

Super easy!  I only made one slight change - I didn't have any oregano on hand, so I omitted it.  It still had a great flavor!  This makes 2 'jelly' sized jars full (not the tiny, squatty jars, but the small ones with decorative sides) if you use large enough jalapenos.  A great 'starter' recipe!

I followed (almost) the recipe. On Chef Johns video he said that the sugar would take 95% of the heat out....so I only used 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar. I like some heat. They came out great! Thanks for the recipe.

What an awesome recipe!  I had a ton of jalapenos in my garden and I didn't know what to do with them.  This recipe came up in a Google search.  I love the slight sweetness they have - I will never buy store bought pickled jalapenos again... these were wonderful and so easy!  Thank you for sharing!

Thank you chef John! I wanted to chime in that these tasted just like store bought banana peppers when I used long skinny sweet peppers. The best part is that these don't have yellow dye and sulfates. Do you know how hard it is to find pepper rings without that junk? Next time I make these, I will try jalapenos.The brine would also make a great base for a salad dressing. Just add some olive oil and voila!

Great recipe! I love Mrs Renfro jalapenos because they are so crisp but was going through about a jar a week and was sick of paying for them.   This recipe solved my problem.  Like another review I cut the sugar in half to keep more heat and placed them directly in jars and poured the liquid over.  I also added about 1 teaspoon of tumeric- it helped keep them teally green.  Five dollars bought me about five pounds at the farmers market and made four quarts; I used four cups each of vinegar and water and it was the perfect amount.  Thanks for sharing chg John!

I'm relatively new to canning and have never made jalapenos before. We all found this to be too sweet and not hot enough. Thank you though for posting it.

9 11 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/221961/quick-pickled-jalapeno-rings/ ... Soooo easy (which isn't a big priority, but nice that it is :D) & good!  Not so many pepper plants can put out a few peppers!  :)  I followed the suggestion about just putting the peppers in a jar then adding the hot liquid.  Something I didn't know - or notice - until now is that peppers float.  Soooo, you don't have to add extra liquid because some peppers aren't covered.  They're rebels & trying to get out of that jar!  Just give them a stir during the sitting time & a shake once they're lidded.  They'll still float, but be less resistant.  ;D  I tried one with the garlic, one without.  'Not a big oregano fan either, but I do like it & added it as the recipe states.  'Really couldn't tell it was there, but definitely are some good peppers!  Yum.  The garlic ones are definitely garlicky.  Very good, but you can tell without seeing it that there's garlic with those.  Chef John strikes again!  :) ... Cliff G's suggestion of reducing sugar to 1 1/2Ts will give ya some hot peppers.  :D

Great and easy recipe. These rings are definitely better than what you buy in the store. I made this with home grown jalapenos, which are definitely much hotter than store bought ones. The only modification I made was adding more garlic, since I'm a garlic fiend.

This past summer, my mom gave me a huge bag of fresh jalapenos she'd grown in her garden.  Being a lover of pickled jalapenos, I found this recipe.  Chef John has never let me down (I love all of his recipes!) so this is the one I chose.  I will admit, I had some trepidation over the addition of oregano, but I'm so glad I left it in.  The oregano added just a little touch of flavor that made these rings special.  I washed and sliced all of the jalapenos, leaving all of the veins and seeds in, as I like em' hot.  I then cleaned the garlic cloves and gave them a rough chop, leaving them in fairly large chunks.  As other reviewers did, I simply dropped the garlic in the bottom of the jar, then loaded the jalapeno rings on top, leaving about 1 1/2 inches of clearance from the top of the jar.  After cooking my vinegar mixture, I poured it into the jar, just covering the jalapenos.  I left them on the counter to cool for about an hour, then popped them in the fridge.  I was so excited to try them, that I only waited about 3-4 days before breaking the seal.  Holy moley, were those puppies HOT!!!  So, I put the lid back on and popped them back in the fridge.  After about 2 weeks, the sugar, true to form, had calmed the heat down.  I have since bought another batch of jalapenos at the grocery and made another couple jars since the first jar was gone in like 4 days.  What an incredible recipe.  Chef John does it again!  Make these NOW and don't change a thing about this recipe!

Everything I was looking for! Easy, quick, and after 4 weeks, very tasty! 

Can't wait to put these on everything :)

Just two quick notes: (1) I put this batch in 4 pint sizes, and I think as a result I was short on the liquid mixture in the end. I ended up boiling some water in the microwave really quick and mixing with a dash of vinegar, but next time I will increase the liquid by half to make sure I have plenty.

(2) I was pretty pessimistic about the oregano - not a big fan. But I followed the recipe exactly despite my misgivings and it turned out great.

Nearly identical to my recipe and excellent.  The biggest differences, and purely for long term storage, are no garlic and 5:1 vinegar ratio.  They will keep for a long time in the fridge this way. I usually run our after 6 months or so but I've gone up to a year.  Must be stored in the fridge though.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!!!  I made a pint 5 days ago and have been letting it sit in the refrigerator.  I tried them today and WOW!  I may try my hand at canning a couple jars of these yummy peppers for the winter.

Great, easy, fast!  I did cut sugar in half, and I also filled jars with jalapeno slices - then added hot brine.  Slices stay crisp.  Don't leave out the oregano.  I was skeptical, but it gives great flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe that helped me save my abundance of jalapenos!

Love this! Combined jalapeños, hot cherry peppers, and hot banana peppers and reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon to cut back on the sweetness to retain the heat (we like 'em hot!).  They turned out perfect! The double batch of ingredients and 9 medium sized jalapeños, 5 small cherry peppers, and 3 small banana peppers, yielded two pint jars of peppers.

I loved them but the seeds made it too spicy. Take half the seeds out and throw them away. put the other half in the vinegar marinade, don't leave them in the peppers, or you will regret it. I recommend this recipe

This recipe was incredibly easy and incredibly GOOD, maybe even addictive!  I increased the ratio of water to vinegar to a 2:1 ratio. These are so good all you can eat them straight out of the jar as a snack.  This recipe is awesome for banana peppers as well. Look no further for another recipe.

These are fantastic! I learned a lot from viewing the video for this recipe on foodwishes.com.  I used jalapenos from my garden - about 13 of them and this with the amount of brine here made a 1 pink jar.  I have eaten them in salads, burritos, on nachos and just solo. I will make again and again! Thank you so much for posting Chef John.

I'm not a huge fan of heat but I like spicy. The video said a lot of the heat gets removed but not so much, they were still killer hot. Of course they are hot peppers but I have a few different ways to cook them so the heat is reduced, I was hoping this was another but not so much. I have friends who eat the store bought ones and love hot peppers, after feeding them these ones they said they were ok. We'll see how they go over on burgers and nachos :)

Excellent! I made these exactly as written and who ever said the sugar would take most of the heat out was wrong! These are still very spicy. But we like them that way.

This couldn't get any easier, thank you!  I absolutely love Jalapenos and pickled vegetables so this was a win-win for me.  Absolutey delicious after ten minutes and I am sure after a week they will even be better.  I can't wait to make some tasty nachos for the boys next weekend!  Thank you Chef John....AGAIN!

I made this and I am so happy to have found this recipe.  I made it according to the recipe the first time.  It was good, but I improved it by omitting the oregano and adding black peppercorns and thin carrot  slices to the vinegar and water mixture.   I first  layered the jar with Moroccan bay leaves, jalapeno slices, partially cooked carrot slices and raw garlic slivers.  I then poured  the hot vinegar and black peppercorn mixture to the jar. After it cooled, I refrigerated the jar. I did not add any sugar and used Himalayan pink salt. Use large peppers since they are not as hot.  The first batch I made with small jalapenos were so fiery I had to wait a month before I could eat them. I also added tumeric to the vinegar to preserve color and crispness.  The oregano, even Mexican oregano is too strong I think.  Oh, I topped off the mix with Meyer lemon juice from my own tree.  This recipe is excellent and is far superior to any commercial peppers on the market. Thank you so much.

Try adding slice carrots.  When I buy from the Mexican grocery store they have that mixture on their shelves.  They are really good.

This recipe couldn't be easier. Based on another reviewer's suggestion, I use only 1 tablespoon of sugar in order to keep more of the spice. They turn out tangy, spicy and delicious - way better than store-bought jalapenos!  Just a note that the garlic reacts with the vinegar and turns an ugly blue, so if you see something that looks like mold, don't worry!

Five-star for ease and taste.  The initial taste is good, the jalapenos hot with a slight pickling.  I'm hoping these will taste quite pickled in 4 weeks.  I doubled the recipe and got two pints. I also made a jar of hot pickled green beans with the juice of the jalapeno mixture.

Amazing and so very easy.....I used green and red jalapenos that I was gifted from someones garden and made 6 pint sized jars. I adjust the recipe for 8 servings to ensure I had enough brine. It was perfect. I stuffed the jars with the sliced pepper rings and then poured the hot brine over as did other reviewers. I had somme on chili last night and they were spicy and a little sweet all at the same time and the jalapeno was still crisp! Excellent....I cant say enough about this easy recipe. Thanks!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I like it's sweetness and pickley flavor.  I've used it to pickle more than Jalepenos too.  I've done sweet peppers, cuccumbers, and I'm about to try some green tomatoes.  Thanks!

These were incredibly easy and soooo tasty! Besides the delicious jalapeño making everything more yummy, the pickling juice is a fabulous addition to refried beans as well! I will never again purchase pickled jalapeños from the store. I can't believe I am just now adding this recipe to my culinary repertoire.

I made this recipe as written and it's very good.   The jalapenos do lose some of their bite with the sugar, but they are still quite hot.   Mild enough that you can eat these plain, out of the jar, but hot enough that one or two is enough.   When I make this again, I will have about 1/3 of the jar with sweet red pepper.

I just made theses and they're still warm. I used jalapenos from my garden and they tastes great. I have been intimidated by the canning process so this quick pickling process was a great find. Thank you! I will be making them again!!!

Good, simple, easy to follow recipe.  Beware though, these are the hottest peppers I've ever tried (and I like spicy food)---I can't even eat one slice straight out of the jar.  I'm not sure if it's the jalapenos I bought or the recipe, but I wish they were a medium heat. They've been sitting in the fridge for a few days, and hopefully they'll mellow a little more over the weeks.   Next time I'll try the recipe with other veggies!

Easy, fast and good. What else do you need. You can make them hotter by reducing the sugar because I did. These are great though and so simple. Never need to buy the jarred peppers again.

These were a hit! very easy,only made 3 pints. I did replace oregano with pickling spice instead as my family does not like oregano, and used apple cider vinegar.

I found this recipe to be very easy and super quick. The flavor of the jalapenos was quite good but a little sweet. I did not find that very much of the heat was removed from my peppers. All in all though a good recipe! I also placed mine in the fridge right after I jarred them for fast cooling. This intern vacuumed my jar tops down. Might use less sugar next time.

My peppers are very hot this year, so I added one more tablespoon of sugar to tone the heat down. I also added in a bit more garlic. My peppers must be smaller, 14 filled a pint jar. I waited two weeks before reviewing the taste and even had some of the family over to help out with the taste testing. They're still pretty hot, so the sugar didn't tone the heat as much, they didn't taste real sweet either, so that was good. They sure are better than store bought and all agreed this is five stars, for ease, taste and freshness. Must have been good, they ate almost half the jar.

Just made my third batch of these and I love them. Started with recipe as written and they were great. This batch I ended up cutting the sugar back to 1.5 Tbsp to increase the heat and doubled the garlic just for personal taste and they are perfect!!!

These are simply fabulous!  When you use up the jalepenos,save the juice and slice up some onions really thin and add to the jar.  Also good for cucumbers! We sometimes buy the mini English cukes from Sam's and they go south before we can use them all, so I cut some in chunks or spears. I'm telling you, the used jalepeno juice is liquid gold around here! For those who want the peppers to have less heat, lay the slices out on your board then poke out the seeds and membranes with an apple corer.  Easy-Peasy!!

I am letting these brew in the fridge. The liquid did not cover the jalapeños so I made about 3 times as much for my 10 large peppers. I'll update my review after I taste them. Easy recipe.

When I was younger I could eat hot stuff with the best of them! ...not now. So these were especially good as the sugar softened the bite of the jalapenos, but the flavor was still there. Excellent on sub sandwiches and a few friends even ate them out of the jar! Easy too!

Simple recipe,  worked no problems.  The 3 tbps sugar should have tipped me off tho. Sooo sweeet! Exactly like every major brand condiment on the shelf - do people actually prefer it this way? Next time I try it I'll do everything the same but no sugar. Also I liked the idea from the commenter who suggested allowing it to cool in the jar with the lid on - helps vacuum seal.

I followed this recipe for spices, but rather than refrigerator peppers, I canned mine in a water bath for 10 min following the instructions for canning jalapenos in the Ball canning book.  The only difference was the addition of sugar and oregano.  Can't wait to taste them in a few weeks!

We have an abundance of jalapeños and green beans from our garden. Just pickled the beans and the peppers are next. I added red pepper flake to the beans and cut whole garlic cloves in half. We like to eat the garlic too :) Love this recipe! Super easy and super tasty!!

Followed recipe exactly and they turned out great!!  An excellent way to use and preserve those abundant garden grown jalapenos.  They go perfect on hamburgers and hot dogs to spice things up a bit.

Made these for my husband because he LOVES Jalapeno rings on almost everything.  He was so impressed that he say's make your own and don't buy bottled anymore. By the way, he buy's huge bottles of them from Costco.  But not any more. Thanks John.

They did seem easy to make.  I put them in the fridge and now a few weeks later I'm tasting them to see how they turned out.  HOT! WOW! I thought there would be a little less heat in them.  It does the job but, I'm looking for a recipe them cools them down just a bit. Yes easy, yes crunchy, yes hot!

Easy and fast. I wasn't sure how oregano would taste in this recipe, but it isn't overpowering at all. I left out the sugar just because I didn't think it needed it, and also to make it healthier. Glad I did, because it tastes great without it.

These were Fabulous!! Other than poking out some of the white pith on the majority of the slices, I followed this exactly. Crunchy and not too hot. (Use big peppers) I will make these MANY times over! Yum! Thanks :)

This is the say way I make pickled jalapeños except I do not add sugar and add Mexican oregano and a spot of olive oil to the jar before I seal it in a hot water bath.  Using red and green jalapeños makes for a festive gift.

Very easy to make. I don't eat jalapenos but I grew a few plants for the rest of the family. We were overflowing with jalapenos and this recipe helped preserve them to use throughout the year.

Wow, these are so good and so easy!  I easily doubled the number of jalapeños to the pickling solution.  I also like mine a little softer, so I cooked them few a minutes.   Also I have made these many times and have found that if I remove a lot of the seeds before pickling them, it really reduces the heat.  I slice them whole, the rinse and rinse to get the seeds out.  (Coughing the whole time) :)  They last a long time in the fridge too, months.  But mine seem to disappear too fast!

Absolutely ADORABLE!!!  OMG this is AWESOME!!!

I can't believe I have been buying the stuff coming out of jars for all these years.

Thank you so much for sharing this excellent recipe.

I added 1/4 of onions (string cut) and 1/2 carrot

This is my go-to pickled jalapeño recipe, I make it as-is, no substitutions, and love it. I will say, I tried to pickle other hot peppers (specifically cherry bomb) and the oregano wasn’t a good flavor profile match. But for jalapeños it’s great!

I followed this recipe for my first attempt at pickling. Took me awhile to figure out how to use them (my problem). Now that I have used them w/ red onions from the jar they tasted great in the salmon "Caseydilla" I made.

I've made this recipe 6 times, about to be 7 in just a moment. The first time I followed to a tee, and my husband found them to be too sweet to eat. So now I just omit the sugar and he swears they are better than store bought!

Great recipe and so easy. Keeps in the fridge for quite a while if they last that long. I stick to the recipe and my boyfriend eats them with everything. But then again, he’s Thai. :)

My husband devours these in breakfast burritos, on burgers, on sandwiches, on nachos... you see where I'm going here, right? I also used only half of the amount of sugar recommended to keep them more on the spicy side and they. were. perfect. Perfect I tell ya!

On a whim I bought a jalapeño pepper plant and needless to say it is thriving! I can’t believe how many peppers it’s yielding, I can’t keep up but I hate throwing them away. I’m not a fan of store bought pickled peppers, the texture leaves something to be desired but these! OMG, I can eat them by the jar full all by themselves. I love them. The only differences to mine from the original recipe are that all of my peppers had sun ripened red and I didn’t mince my garlic, I put in 2 whole cloves. Probably laziness, but let’s pretend the sight of them in the jar is attractive to me. So much yum, thank you, Chef John

I use a majority of my jalapenos from my garden on this recipe with no changes. I do a hot water bath with some to last the winter. Love these on sandwiches hotdogs and such. Once again Chef John delivers, love his recipes

I followed recipe exactly and, man, they were WAY too hot for me! (And, I like relatively hot peppers.) I don't even know how some said they were too sweet, I couldn't taste sweet at all. I  used about 12 jalapenos from my garden. Maybe they were just hotter than store bought jalapenos. I am going to try again, this time removing the seeds.

I used garlic powder instead of clove. I didn’t use oregano, I substituted minced onion. It’s a very easy recipe to follow, and doesn’t take long to do. Great for small batches.

Really good.  Easy too. Only change I'd make is to cut the sugar in half from recipe as we don't like the sweetness and don't need to mask the hotness.

Great recipe! I freeze jalapeños from my garden in the food saver. I find if I take jalapeños out of freezer and let sit for just a few minutes, they slice easily. I don’t buy the jarred variety anymore. This is an excellent use of my garden’s bounty. I make NO changes to recipe. Thank you for submitting!

I saw some reviews that it would be sweet so I added some extra salt!  Love this recipe.  I let it sit while we went to the store and came home to try it on a couple chips with beans, cheese and sour cream.  YUM!!!  No more store bought jalapenos.  Thanks.

Been making these for about a year now...love them!  I do use less sugar we like them hot,  everything else the same but I double the brine. I do prefer to stuff my jar  tight then add the very hot liquid and put tops on fast, as this will seal the jars. Cover the jars with a towel to cool and listen for the pop sealing sound. When sealed they can be put in the cupboard. If any jars do not seal then put in the fridge, and use first.

Full disclosure. I just made them and didn't try them yet. I had a bunch of jalapeños leftover that I didn't want to go to waste, so I used this recipe and broke out my pickling jars. Quick and easy to make. I used less sugar, descent amount of garlic, but did not have oregano. Can't wait to try them!

I like this recipe but it is a little too sweet.  Next time I will only use 2 tablespoons of sugar or possible 1.5.

I made it with very mild peppers and these are great for snacking right out of the jar!  Also fantastic on nachos and sandwiches.

We wanted jalapeños that still had a crunch. This fit the bill! We did use only one third of the sugar. Otherwise too sweet.

Excellent starter recipe.  I reduced the sugar to 1 tbsp and increased garlic to 4 large cloves of garlic(per preference).  Added onion to the brine.  brought all to boil and it was amazing.  Perfect if your looking for something close to what you purchase, but better, in my opinion

Bless Chef J. for coming up w/something quick and easy for this year's jalapeno crop! Not a big oregano fan, so I put fresh dill instead. Nom-nom. had extra liquid an extra jar and salad cucumbers so made threw them in. Since I originally put the jalapenos into the pan to cool, this made the pickles spicy: what a plus!

Perfect to go with my smoked fish dip! And so easy! I would just make sure to let it cool down even longer so the jalapeños keep a little more crunch.

Having a bumper crop of Jalapeños,  I had no idea what to do with them,  found this AWESOME way to pickle them, so I figured why not try it out.... Spoiler Alert,  If you enjoy pickled Jalapeños,  this is most easiest way you can do it.   Can't keep them in the fridge long enough.... 

I sliced my jalapeños along with the garlic, and some sweet peppers, placed them in my canning jar (kinda packed them),  then poured the mixture over the peppers.... I let it cool a little before putting it in the fridge...I make this on Sunday Night,  We let them sit for a couple of days before busting them out for Nacho's on the weekend.     Super Simple...

I had several jalapeños from my garden and decided to make pickles.  This recipient is so easy!!!  I added red and yellow peppers and onions.  They are SO good!   Now I want a garden year round so I will always have Jalapeñoto make pickles all year!   I only had pint jars so as you can see did not fill i up, but they will earn so fast it will not matter!

Update:  I have made this 3 more times. Added onions, carrots and onions, this time!  So easy to do!

Good, simple recipe.  Another way to preserve and stay on top of all those jalapenos ripening in my back yard.  I let my jalapenos ripen up on the vine to hot and red.  I reduced the sugar to just 2 tablespoons and added more garlic and lots of dill.  I add 1/4 teaspoon pickle-crisp (calcium chloride) to keep that crunch.

This recipe saved me as I had run out of ideas for all the jalapeños we harvested.   This is so easy and quick to make so I rely on it when I don’t have time to make my favorite......jalapeño poppers.
   I think next time I may only use 2 Tbsp. of sugar rather than 3.

I added fresh dill and cut down the sugar, I added the jalapenos to the boiling liquid and let cook for about 2 min, until the bright green was just going away

Quick and easy.  Much better than store bought pickled jalapenos.  Will definitely make this again.

These are SO yummy and easy. We will never buy them at the store again!  Started with making one jar. Today was 5 jars ?? Taste is similar to the pickled jalapenos at Qdoba. NOMNOMNOM

I did what others suggested and packed the raw sliced jalapenos into the jars and then poured the heated mixture over the top. They turn out very crunchy even up to a year later. I made 6 jars last time and just finished my last one this week. My only change was to add garlic slices to the jars so I could eat them pickled also. Awesome recipe! I've turned several of my friends on to these and they love them also.

The key thing about the recipe is the rinsing of  the pepper slices.  The more and longer you rinse the less heat you'll get.  Other than that, excellent recipe.

Great recipe. Better than jar peno's. I only used 1T sugar because I want my peno's spicier rather than sweeter. Turned out perfect. Also used 1 cup water and 1 cup vinegar because I wanted to make sure I had enough juice. Still turned out great with these changes.

I have made these so many times now. Often I swap the sugar for maple syrup (1/4 cup), or honey (1/4 cup) if I'm out of maple syrup. I don't think the recipe is too sweet at all. I usually transfer the jalapeños to the jars when there is still some bright green on them so they will stay a little crunchy, but sitting in their brine, they will quickly fade in colour too. I skip the oregano as I don't think it adds anything. I've tried other spices like dill and parsley, but I don't think they add anything either.
I live in China where these are so expensive and hard to find, so this recipe has been saving me money and convenience for 2 years!

I made these with my first harvest of mild jalapeños from my garden. They were absolutely delectable. I used a mix of red and green peppers with a good amount of cracking (spicier). I backed off on the sugar by half. I also added some quartered (long ways) baby carrots for additional crunch. Absolutely delish! Making again today with my final pepper harvest.

This was a super easy & straight forward recipe. I added chopped carrot & cut it with a crinkle knife to make it a fun wavy shape. The jalapenos were ready to eat by the end of the day.

I grew an impressive crop of jalapenos this year so decided to give canning them a try.  I like Chef John's quick method as I have plenty of refrigerator space.  We like them hot so I did cut the sugar in half, and they were pleasantly hot !

Delicious the first time do I made another batch with a later harvest from my pepper plants. Chef John's video for the recipe implies one should eat these rather quickly, but folks are clearly thinking longer term.  It's been six weeks since I pickled my first batch - guess I'll find out if they keep.

This is the 3rd year in a row that I've used this recipe...super easy. I double the recipe to make a full quart jar...recipe as is appears only makes a pint jar. I also add some red pepper flakes, a sliced red Thai chili pepper and a sliced golden cayenne pepper to keep the heat. This year I packed jars first with room temp sliced jalapeños , and then let the pickling liquid cool for about ten minutes before pouring over jalapeño slices to keep them a little crisper. Hoping they're just as good. Officially in my favorite recipes binder now!

I made a triple batch of these last weekend and just WOW!  They are so good!  I did reduce the amount of sugar so they would have some heat.  My jalapeños just keep producing so I will be making more this weekend.  Love them in my salad!

Very good, except my jalapenos always seem to lose their heat when I pickle them. I add crushed red pepper to help make them spicier.

Ended up adding a bit more vinegar than it says and could have kept the pot on the heat for a minute when adding the jalapeños but they turned out great! Rinse off jalapeños after slicing

I will never buy a jar of picked jalapeño rings again! I used a tad less sugar because I wanted to be sure they were spicy. You can also throw other things in with the jalapeños like onion or other kinds of peppers. I also use this for pickling banana pepper rings. THANK YOU!!

Simple recipe and can't wait to try in over nachos and cheese. I'm gonna wait a few days until jalapeno is pickled.

Delicious! I have used this recipe for 2 seasons now. I pickled all my peppers with this recipe. It is a tried and true recipe.  I don't modify anything about the recipe; however, I strongly suggest that cooks canning peppers for the first time make sure your cooking area is well vented.  Jalapenos cooked directly in the saucepan will give off "spicy"  fumes.  If you can do this outside, it's better. Another option to put the cut peppers into the jar and pour the boiling liquid into the jar, this cuts down on the  fumes.

Absolutely wonderful. Was making taco salad and didn't have any jarred jalapenos, but I had fresh ones and wondered if you could quick pickle them.  I am never going to buy jarred jalapenos again!  Thank you so much for this recipe

So yum! I am so impressed that I made this haha it is such a simple recipe. I didn't have white sugar so I added three 1 cm cubes of brown sugar and it was perfect. I was in a rush to make these and ate them right after letting them sit in the boiled solution for 30 minutes and it was still yummy. Will see how they taste after being in the fridge next.

Made with milder jalapenos. A hint of sweet and the heat hits but doesn't linger too long. Perfection.

My family adores this recipe. They eat them almost as fast as I can grow and pickle the jalepenos. In fact, my jalepenos are getting double the garden space this year so I can attempt to keep up with demand. These are FANTASTIC.

I've used this recipe for the last several years as jalapeños seem to love their spot in my garden.  I throw in lots of garlic cloves.  If I have small onions in the garden I slice them and add as well.  I am surprised at how much I used this until another crop arrives whether it is for sauces, pizza, whatever you can imagine.  The pickling takes out just a bit of heat do seeds are never a problem.  Once again, a Chef John winner.

This is a great recipe.  I use home grown jalapeños & serranos, add some chopped carrot & onion, and only half the sugar. I also double the liquid as I find the listed amount isn't enough for 2 pint jars.

This is a pretty great recipe.  I use it for both jalapenos and mixed colored sweet peppers.  My modifications, which work pretty well, are:

1.  Apple cider vinegar instead of white

2. Raw cane sugar instead of white

3.  Liberal use of fresh oregano, and

4.  I don't heat the mix, I just can it cold.

After 3-4 days it's ready to eat.

Excellent and easy just as printed, but like all the best recipes it allows some tweaking for personal preferences. Personally, I use less sugar, a higher vinegar to water ratio and 1 tsp. turmeric for the colour. 
Don’t pay too much attention to the comments on the ‘heat’ as there are many factors, including individual perception of what is ‘hot’. The biggest ‘heat’ factor is the jalapeño you start with. Lots of factors come into play with the raw pepper including: size and age of the peppers; where they were grown (even peppers grown in different areas of the same garden can vary); how much sun and/or rain they received during their growing season; how long you let them sit before sampling them, etc. You can temper the heat down by the quantity of seeds you keep in the batch (less seeds = less heat), the amount of sugar (more sugar = less heat) and if you have added sugar it usually will take a week or two to lessen the heat. However, unless you run a trial batch from the peppers you are using it is a guessing game on whether or not you they need to have their heat tempered to suit your taste. 
After you finish a jar of peppers save the juice for a little something special. Cut some small matchsticks from raw carrots and/or jicama (about 1/8” x 1/8” x 3” long) and marinate in the jalapeño juice for 12 – 36 hours, then use 4 to 6 of the matchsticks as a spectacular garnish on white fish or chicken. Or you could offer them in a separate small serving dish.  mmmm!

I have made this a few times.  Excellent recipe.  At first I used red and green jalapenos and everyone liked it. 2nd time i added a few carrots and small chunks of onions, even better.  Last time I made it, I used 75% jalapenos and 25% habaneros.  OMG  great flavor and real good heat

I use this recipe for green beans, all peppers and cucumbers! Works great, just have to double the recipe if doing anything other than peppers so there is enough liquid to fill the jars!

These are amazing. I have made them numerous times nothing in the store compares to them. I usually make three  or four pints at a time using jalapeños from my garden and find they last several months in the coldest part of my refrigerator. I follow the directions for preparing the peppers  from the video and find they have the perfect amount of heat for us. The written directions don't tell you to rinse the peppers after they are sliced. This easily removes some of the seeds for those that don't like them super hot.  More rinsing means less heat so don't rinse them too long. Like others,  I place the sliced peppers in the jar and poor the hot liquid over them, seal them and refrigerate after they reach room temp. I have used this recipe with Serrano's, banana peppers, green tomatoes....you get the idea ??.

Well, haven't tasted it yet, but how could it go wrong with those ingredients? I got to use up my end-of-season excess of peppers and it looks GORGEOUS.  I can't wait to slap em on some grinders or nachos!

Perfect!
If it's not spicy enough it's not the recipe's fault, but your peppers'. This has the tiniest bit of sweetness to balance the vinegar. I put these on everything but my waffles. ;-)

Really easy brine to make for Jalapeño peppers.  I do prefer an all natural (unrefined) sugar for a brine with a bit more bite and less sweetness. I grow them, pickle them, and have them all winter long. The longer they sit, the hotter they get if you leave the seeds in. Try it and enjoy!

I followed the suggestion if you wanted hotter rings to reduce the sugar.  I guess our garden jalapeños were really hot.  Husband loves them, almost too hot for me.  Will leave sugar as is next time.

I made this recipe exactly as written. It is AWESOME! My jalapeños are hot enough that you really can't eat them by themselves (tested that theory on several people who all agreed!) but in this recipe they ended up perfect. They are still quite hot, I can't do more than 4-5 on a sandwich, but they are much more enjoyable now. I will definitely be doing more of these as the jalpenos continue to ripen.

I used half the sugar to make it more spicy and I put the jalapeños in the jar before pouring the mixture over it like other reviews said. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I had double the amount of peppers (20) so I doubled the recipe but it seems there is a lot more liquid than peppers and I used a jar that was 4x the size of a jam jar (other reviews said the recipe made 2 jam jars worth) and couldn't fit all my peppers in.

Edit: My one batch of peppers were way too spicy so I kept the same amount of sugar the recipe calls for in that batch. Basically just add sugar to your taste.

The recipe is great as is, but we added a little extra garlic and dash of red pepper flakes. We were amazed at how easy and quick this solution worked to preserve a bountiful harvest of jalepenos and cherry peppers from our garden.  Best pickled peppers we've ever had and are happy we will get to enjoy them into winter. Bringing a jar to a BBQ today!

Trying this again.  I was determined to can these to give as gifts...  So here is what I did.  Made the exact same ingredients but doubled because I had so many jalapeño peppers.  Filled 5 12-ounce jelly jars with my sliced peppers.  They were gorgeous shades of red and green fresh from the garden.  Poured the hot mix over them to fill the jars.  Putting them into a hot water canning bath covered with 1 inch of water and going to let them process for 15 minutes.  I was probably a bit heavy on the garlic and vinegar...  Stuck to the same amount of sugar.  Will update to let you know how the 'canning step' went....  Thanks for the recipe-- this was easy enough that I was willing to dive in and the reviews convinced me I won't be disappointed!

This is a very easy, basic recipe to follow.  I like to cook the peppers for about five minutes just because I like the peppers a little less firm.  Super easy to double or triple or whatever to take care of summers endless peppers...  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these yesterday with my first batch of jalapenos.  They are beautiful.  I took all seeds out.  I just tried them and they are excellent.  I love that they are crisp even though I put them in the boiling water.  I hate mushy jalapenos.

Made these last fall and gave to friends and family, now they are all asking when I'll making it again.  Reduced the sugar after the first batch to 11/2TBS because we like it hot.

Very awesome!  The only thing different I done was add crushed red pepper to taste and added in some Serrano peppers and just a little bit of liquid smoke for a hint of smoke flavor. Absolutely awesome.

This is as easy as it gets and the end result is great. I sold them at my market garden and people request them annually. The heat of the product is managed well by increasing the seed number. I do not add the peppers into the pan, this keeps them more firm. I also add some red chilli flakes to enhance the flavor.

I have made these several times now and I found out the first time that the amount of liquid was not enough to really cover the jalapeños or fill my mason jar that I put them in when they are done. Maybe my jalapeños are larger than normal? I doubled all the ingredients except the jalapeños and made it again and it worked out better. My husband said they were the best I have ever made.

Made these and they were delicious. 
Personally, I'd like to reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe next time because I like my pickled veggies to be a bit more piquant. These were also approved by a guest and my bf, so that made me happy. 
The best thing is that the longer you leave these guys in the fridge, the spicier they become.  Using the left over brine to make pickle juice drinks, quite tasty. 
Certainly will make again.

This is a must have in my house.  We use them on anything from breakfast burritos to burgers.  Its a great way to use the jalapenos that I froze from my summer garden and enjoy year-round.

I made this for the first time yesterday and the only thing I changed was adding a little red pepper flakes. They turned out delicious! Very spicy! I let them sit in the fridge for 24 hours before giving them a try. I may reduce the sugar next time.

Thank you for the recipe to use as a guideline!  I will never buy store brands again.  I made a quart for $0.50.  My last two quart size cost me $4.99.

This is a new family favorite.  We grew extra peppers this year just to make this recipe in larger quantities.  I added a little onion that was also in the garden but followed the recipe exactly other than that addition.  Spot on recipe!  You won't be disappointed with this one. (servings to 24 and 12 lbs of peppers)

I really do like this easy recipe.  The sweetness combined with the hot Jalepenos makes it a very tasty treat in anything you would like to add them to.  This is my second go around with this recipe.

Wonderful and worthy of repeat! I reduced the sugar to 1 Tbl spoon to keep the heat, and  added 3 sliced carrots. Next time, I'll thinly slice 2-3 garlic cloves (instead of mincing) to add to the mix.

Great pickled jalapeños! They are similar to those bought in stores, simple, only rings of peppers, add them to prepared sandwiches, chili, soup, anything, or any recipe.

Good recipe. I Used a 12oz. bag of japs and it yielded almost a full quart. I followed the recipe as written and let them age in the fridge for about 3 weeks. They came out crispy and very tasty, but not a store bought taste just real tasty and pretty darn hot and I like hot.

Fantastic and easy method to marinate jalapenos.

I made these with garden grown jalapenos and replaced the table 3 spoons of sugar with 3 tables spoons of "very hot" crushed red peppers (40,000 heat units) bought from a local spice shop.  Just for giggles I added a teaspoon of sugar.

Hot, hot, hot!

Yet not so hot that it kills the flavor of any food you may add these wonderfully marinated jalapenos too.

Thank you!!!

2nd time I've made this. It is sooo quick and easy. I made this at Christmas and gave to all then men in the family. LOVED IT! i didn't add oregano either time (keep forgetting to buy more after running out) I do add a bit more garlic and tad less sugar. I used 22 peppers this time so I had triple the liquid recipe to cover them in the jars. I put the peppers in the jar first and then added the liquid. Only, to make sure I proportioned the peppers correctly. I have done it the way the recipes says. Both work great. Someone else posted that it wasn't spicy enough. Keep in mind your peppers dictate how spicy it will be. The larger the pepper the less spicy. If you want it spicier add crushed red pepper like some suggested or use a spicier pepper.

Came out exactly like the jars you buy at the store. I never knew it was so easy to make, and you save a lot using fresh jalapenos and ingredients you have on hand. I didn't use any sugar, garlic, or oregano because we just wanted a plain base. Will be making this method a habit when I get fresh jalapenos!

Very easy to make.  Still setting so I will give them a try tomorrow.  Smells divine though.  I also lessened the sugar in these so I can still have a bit of the heat to go with it.

Had a bumper crop of jalapeños and this was the perfect answer.  You can retain much more heat than commercial preparations and you can add any additional spice that you love.  We added finely chopped onion that was left over from guacamole prep and it was delicious.

I would give this recipe 10 stars! These are 10 times better than store bought canned jalapenos! !! The jalapenos are addictive to eat especially in nachos. Beware, because I got my family eating 10 lbs of these jalapenos, and they all raced to the bathroom.

These are by far the best jalapenos I've ever eaten. I made as is and my family can't enough of them. I've made 2 times now. I only wonder if you could make and then water bath can them for later use. As I am new to canning. Any suggestions?

I liked it very much! At first, they were too hot after I finished the recipe, but I poured another couple tablespoons of sugar in the warm vinegar water and shook the jar and when I tasted them again am hour later, they were perfect! I also added an extra garlic clove which made them taste great.

Made the recipe one rainy afternoon and my husband came inside complaining of the smell.  I thought it smelled terrific.  Anyway, typical him - he adores them, eats them straight out of the jar in front of the open fridge door, and has given 3 jars away to friends (I made a double batch.) And he wants me to make more.  Highly recommend.  My only question - maybe I'm not seeing it - how long can you keep them ?

I used this as a starting point for my peppers.  I decreased the sugar (we like the bite) and added coriander seed instead of oregano.  Fantastic!

Just finished making a batch.  I changed the white wine vinegar for cider vinegar and added loads more garlic.  In winter we drink the liquid to ward off a cold at the first sign of.  Great stuff.

Oh wow!this recipe is so super easy and fast! Just tried them after a few weeks ... So good! I'll definitely be planting more jalepeno plants next year. No need to buy store brought ever again. Tried both with and without garlic and I couldn't really tell much difference. Thanks for this recipe!

Great use for the two large bags of jalapenos that came in our CSA box. Very easy, kept well in the fridge and were delightfully hot!  And I highly recommend wearing a pair of rubber gloves, taking out your contacts later might be painful otherwise :)

I also tried these with hot banana peppers and it worked just as well.  I fill the jars with the peppers then pour the boiling liquid over them and that works just fine.  I also cut back on the sugar I only used 1 tablespoon and they were exactly the way we like.

Smells amazing when you open the jar. I hope these last longer than a few days. I used on nachos last night. Very nice. Thank you Chef John. I am a big fan of yours.

This recipe is so quick and easy. Within a few days, the jalapeños are pickled and deliciously crunchy!  Thanks so much for sharing.

I have now made this four times and will be making on a weekly basis. I was copying a recipe for Jalapeno Mac & Cheese (Myron's Steakhouse) and decided I should make my own pickled jalapeno slices. Good move! I will never buy store brand again. This is so easy and they taste so good.

We absolutely love this recipe.  I leave out the oregano but other than that we can't get enough.  Just whipped up a big ole batch!  Thanks for the recipe!
