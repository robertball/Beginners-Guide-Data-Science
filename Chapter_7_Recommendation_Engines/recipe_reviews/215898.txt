This is definitely sweet.  The use of carrots and honey mustard was interesting.  Although I liked the ideas, I wouldn't make it again as written--I'd go less on the honey mustard and less on the sugar and just a dash of salt.  I did not like the idea of using the tuna liquid or mashing the tuna; it was mushy enough without doing those steps.  I enjoyed trying this recipe though.

I thought this would be a hit with the kids but they didn't care for it. I didn't like it at all.

Used it as a dip instead. The sweetness works out better that way.

I did like the crunchy celery and carrots. I didn't care for the sweetness of it.I won't use it again.
