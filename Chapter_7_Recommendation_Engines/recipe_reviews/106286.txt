This is a perfect pre-bedtime drink.  Instantly relaxing and brings on the drowsey feeling. I highly recommend grating whole nutmeg too. Very tasty and soothing.

This is pretty good. It sounded like a slight twist to a Vanilla Creme that you can get at your local coffee shop that I've been wanting to try. I made this by switching the nutmeg for cinnamon and it tastes really delish and warming.

I think this should read 2 TABLESPOONS of Splenda. I would hope that's the case anyways.

I was first wondering why the heck a milk recipe was up on this website so I decided to try it out. I was a bit skeptical at first, but when I tried it I was amazed. This milk is sooooo good! I will make it again, but maybe with a bit less sugar. Oh yeah, I used superfine sugar (to make sure it dissolves) instead of Splenda because I don't really use Splenda ever. It was very soothing and aromatic. I am drinking it as I speak and feel a bit more sleepy.
