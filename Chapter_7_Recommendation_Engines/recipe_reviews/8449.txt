These were a big hit. I let the strawberries sit for about an hour after I chopped them so they wouldn't be too mushy. Also, I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar based on other people's complaints of lack of flavor. These were excellent - made them for snack at my son's kindergarden and even the kids loved them!

I took some recommendations on other reviews for this recipe: added 1/2 tsp each vanilla extract and cinnamon, & left out 1/4 C of the flour.  I wasn't in the mood for muffins, so I baked this in a 9 X 5 inch loaf pan.  It worked really well.  This bread was a wonderful treat for breakfast, toasted and spread with some homemade strawberry butter (1 tsp confectioners sugar, 3 strawberries, and 1 stick room temp butter combined in blender or food processor until smooth).  Heavenly!!  This is a really great way to use up strawberries that need to be used before going bad.  I highly recommend this one!!  Hope you like it as much as I did...

So Yummy! I've never made strawberry muffins before! I took the advice of others and added some vanilla and 1/2 c more strawberries and they turned out great! Soft and moist and full of flavor!  I dusted the tops with cinnamon and sugar before baking and it made an excellent crust on top!  I definetly will be making these again!  I'm going to use these for my VBS kids tomorrow, so we'll see what they think!  I made mini-muffins for them! Definetly a 5 star muffin!

One of my biggest pet peeves is when people make alterations to a recipe and then review it...you're not reviewing the recipe because you changed it!  With that being said, I made this as is and it tastes like homemade strawberry shortcake.  I thought it was good...others said that it is "too bland," and I disagree...I thought it was a great texture and very good.  Maybe next time I will incorporate some changes to suit my own personal taste...but I think this recipe deserves a chance before you go changing it.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a wonderful and easy strawberry muffin recipe. Such a great taste and very moist. I added the 1/2 teaspoon of cinnimon, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Perfect, not too sweet not too bland, just right! Thanks!

The best muffin recipe!! I was very successful using 1 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose white. I threw in some wheat germ and some nutritional yeast and just added a bit more milk (soy was great). I also used a frozen berry mix and they just turned out wonderful!! Thanks for the recipe :)

I made some modifications after reading other reviews, and they turned out DELICIOUS.  They have stayed yummy and moist for 3 days.  I added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and about 3/4 tsp of cinnamon. I also substituted whole wheat flour for 1 1/2 cup of the flour and I used Splenda instead of sugar.  Absolutely delicious.

These turned out wonderful. I used fresh chopped strawberries, a little over a cup, and did increase the sugar by about one quarter cup - I wanted a more dessert-type muffin. I had never had strawberry muffins before, and was pleased at how much the fresh fruit taste came through. A definate keeper. Thanks!

I made this recipe vegan (and thus changed it A LOT).  The muffins were perfect!!!  To make vegan: 1/2 cup SOYMILK + 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar instead of milk, 1/4 cup SOY YOGURT instead of 1 egg, 1.5 cups CAKE FLOUR instead of 1.75 cups regular flour.  Also, I added 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon allspice, and greased the pan with cooking spray instead of paper liners.  Bake for 20 minutes.

Needed a baked gift that I could throw together in a hurry so I made this in a loaf pan rather than muffins.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 cup of finely chopped rhubarb. I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to compensate for the tartness of the rhubarb. I topped it with a mixture of 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 T. butter.  Since it was a gift I couldn't sample it, but if looks and aroma are any indication of taste this was going to be very much appreciated by its recipient.

Excellent muffins! I took other people's advice and made the following modifications: I used less flour, only using 1 1/2 cups flour. In addition to the recipe I added an extra 1/2 cup strawberries, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Before baking I sprinkled a sugar & cinnamon mix on top. They turned out so well... very tasty!

I made these into mini muffins (baked 10 mins at same temp.) and they turned out great! I made the recipe exactly as written for my first pan, and then made the rest with some modifications so I could compare. I added cinnamon sugar to the tops of some and then added 1/4 of mini choc chips to the last 10. While the modifications were good, I actually preferred the "plain" ones. I felt like the other flavors competed with the strawberry. The "bland" flavor of the original muffin lets the flavor of the strawberries really shine through. Will probably be making these when my fresh raspberries come in!

I just made these and they're fabulous!!!  I did what everyone else suggested and added the 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and they turned out heavenly!  The only thing I didn't understand was that my batch produced 12 instead of 8 muffins.  I filled the cups about 75% of the way before baking and they turned out like standard muffins so I am not sure why I got more than the recipe said I would.  Also, I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup of oatmeal ground into flour instead of the white flour, just to make them a little healthier.  YUM!  I can't wait to share them with my friends tomorrow!!

Didn't change one thing about this recipe and the muffins turned out wonderfully. One of the best muffins i've had! So easy and so tasty. But if you like the really sweet or spiced type of muffins then this is not for you since the taste is quite mild (BUT NOT BLAND!) All of those who gave this recipe less than 5 starts should question their taste buds. It tasted even better the next day! Definitely one of the best strawberry muffins!!!

Five stars for basic recipe with the highly recommended modifications from other cooks: 1/4 C less flour, add 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/2 tsp (+) vanilla, 1/2 tsp (+) cinnamon. I also added the optional cup of milk chocolate chips. Very tasty! I ended up with 10 good sized muffins after the additions. 

I also didn't slice the strawberries since many people said they didn't like their texture after baking. I gave mine a fairly small dice, then sprinkled them with sugar and let them sit for about an hour. You still get definite bites of berry, but the texture is not so mushy. 

I can see adding pulverized oats and/or wheat germ to the next batch. I will definitely make this again. It would be good with just about any berry. Great way to use up fruit that's almost past its prime, too.

Average.  I'll definitely make this recipe again.  It's acceptable and I can dig that.  My kids loved them.  Maybe a drop of strawberry extract would spruce them up a bit, they're mild in taste.  Thanks Katie!

I've made these three times in the last two weeks at the espresso cafe I own.  Everyone seems to like them and they've been selling great.  We do a really large batch and we make the muffins in the jumbo muffin tins and they've turned out great every time.  Thanks, Katie Mae.

Very nice. I doubled the recipe and made two loaves instead of muffins. Next time I am going to make sure that the strawberries are nice and sweet prior to using them. Mine were a little sour and the bread ended up tasting like cranberries instead of strawberries. Still good though! If the strawberries are tart next time, I will cut them up and then let them sit in some sugar before using.

Very good basic muffin recipe.  I made the sugar 3/4 cup and it made it the perfect sweetness.  You could add just about any fruit to this and it would be great.  Next time I might add a little cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice or a struesel topping, but the recipe doesn't have to have it to be good.  Thanks for the recipe Katie!

These were fantastic!  I also used a few others recommendations of: 
letting the strawberries sit for about an hour,  adding 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar - replacing 1/4 of the white sugar.  Thanks!

I followed recipe exactly and these were bland - almost tasteless.  I even used very ripe, juicy strawberries.  Would not recommend.

These are delicious! The only changes I made were to add a little vanilla extract and more chopped strawberries. Some of us thought they tasted like strawberry shortcake and some of us thought they tasted like muffins with strawberry jam inside. Either way, everyone liked them. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great, simple muffin recipe. I took the other recommendations and added a half teaspoon of vanilla and a generous sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter. They're quick and easy and a big hit in our family.

I thought it was good but bland, even after adding vanilla and brown sugar.  Not sure what can be added to make the muffin tastier.  I'm still on the lookout for a great strawberry muffin recipe.

Followed the recipe as written, but did take the suggestion of one reviewer to dip the top in a little melted butter and sugar (used turbinado) after they came out of the pan.  I made mini muffins, and the yield was 24.

I read alot of the other reviews (which were helpful) and did the following adjustments: decreased flour by 1/2 c., used 3/4 c. ww flour, used homemade applesauce instead of oil, used 1 tsp each of cin. & van., added 1/4 c. brn sugar, used almost 3 c. thawed strawberries.  No, the muffins didn't brown and yes, they stuck slightly to the paper and had a spongy consistancy, but that was okay.  I really liked the muffins!  I'll use this recipe again.

These muffins were delicious.  I would have never thought to put strawberries in muffins, but I had loads of strawberries and didn't know what to do with them - this was the perfect solution!  I have to say that I did modify the recipe as others suggested (used 1 1/2 C flour, 1/4 C brown sugar and 1 t vanilla) so I can't really comment on the printed recipe.  With the modifications, the muffins were great.  Very good flavor and very, very moist.  However, I do actually think that the original recipe would be pretty good - next time I think I'll follow the original recipe, but maybe add the vanilla (not so sure it really did need the brown sugar).  I think this would make a great basic recipe for muffins - would probably be good with other fruit such as blueberries, raspberries, etc.  Thanks for the great recipe!

OKay...I loved this muffin...but, I tweaked it differently from everyone else. I used the same ingredients and portions except I put in 1/2 cup of buttermilk, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup of oil(I had organic sunflower oil and I used what I had), plus 1 tsp. of vanilla. I sprinkled some sugar over my strawberries to juice them a bit and then chopped them. This changed the flour to make the muffins pink rather than white as pictured. Mine were delicious. I based my changes on the fact that buttermilk makes better cake batter always than sweet milk! It is strange to me to add cinnamon and other spices as this in my opinion competes with the fresh strawberry flavor. (I'm 64 and have a lot of experience with cooking/baking!) My version made a dozen in the reg. size muffin tin.

These were really quick and easy.  My 3 year old loved them.  I did modify them a little just to make them a little healthier.  I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup rolled oats.  I also added 1tsp each vanilla and almond extract.  Just before baking I also sprinkled a little sugar over top.  Even my husband who rarely eats muffins said they were really good.  Next time I may try adding nuts or even ruhbarb.

This is a very good and very easy muffin recipe! I did as so many members suggested...I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract. I used frozen strawberries that I chopped and thawed. These muffins had just the right amount of sweetness. This recipe made 13 muffins not 8. I will be making these often!

The batter was very thick and almost elastic like bread dough...I triple checked the recipe to see if I had mismeasured an ingredient but hadn't.  So I added a little more milk.  They came out VERY bland.  The batter doesn't seem to be sweet enough.

These are great! Very moist and tart. I sprinkled a bit of crystal sugar on top and they turned out beautiful. I added a little vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg too.

For everyone who thought these were bland: omit 1/4 c of the flour.  I like Betty's version better-it is sweeter and lighter.

The dry to wet ration of the mixture was WAY off!  I ended up having to add another egg and some applejuice to get the batter anywhere near ready!

Okay so I tried the original recipe and it wasn't all that special. The muffin was dry and not very sweet or strawberry like. Technically I'd give this recipe a 3.


But with these following changes I'd give it 5 stars. Add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 more cup strawberries and I substituted coconut oil for the canola oil.  Cut baking time down to 18 minutes and they are perfect

Excellent recipe.  First I made strawberry chocolate chip muffins.  Adding chocolate really made a difference.  I used the recipe for 6 muffins and ended up making 9!!  Everyone loved them, and by the next day they were all gone.  So I decided to make banana chocolate chunk muffins following the same recipe, and I got 10 muffins out of it.  Not quite the same as our favorite bakery, but still excellent muffins.

This was a good, dense breakfast muffin.  The tartness of the strawberries are there and it's not very sweet.  I didn't add the brown sugar as others suggested but I'll probably try it next time.  The cinnamon and vanilla were good additions. Great with a cup of coffee.  ONE LAST THING: I think the yield is wrong.  It says 8, so I changed the yield to 12 since I wanted to make a full batch, but that batter made enough for 21-22 muffins. I'm thinking the actual recipe would be perfect for 12.

Very good.  Added a little brown sugar and increased the cooking temp.  Maybe didn't need brown sugar or less of white because they were really sweet, but cupcake good sweet.  Will make again.

Although they did not look the prettiest, they tasted pretty good! I used frozen berries that were not the greatest anyway and I think that affected the appearance.  I added the brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla as recommended by other reviewers.  I sprinkled sugar on top before baking, would probably add a streusel topping next time.

They didn't last long around my house.  They were so good.  I did change a couple of things after reading reviews.  I only used 1 1/2 c flour and added 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Yummmy

I am disappointed in how these muffins turned out. I too wish I would have read more of the reviews before I made them. I doubled the recipe, but did not make any modifications. The batter was very thick and the muffins turned out very dry and bland.  I doubt I would make them again, but if I do, I would make some of the changes recommended in other reviews.

Good muffins BUT you have to read the reviews and use the advice offered. I decided to make them "Chocolate Dipped Strawberry Muffins" by adding about a cup of chocolate chips. I added the brown sugar, vanilla extract, and lessened the flour a bit (like the reviews suggested). They were good but the strawberries got kind of mushy, making the muffins a little mushy inside. But all in all, very good. The chocolate chips were a VERY good addition. I would definately reccomend it!

This was my first time making strawberry muffins, and they turned out pretty good.  I did sprinkle the tops with some sugar before baking.  The only thing I didn't like was the strawberries were kind of bitter after baking. Maybe it was just my strawberries and no fault of this recipe.  The recipe also yielded me 11 decent sized muffins, instead of the 8.  I will most likely try again when strawberries are abundant and may add just a tad more sugar.

I love it!! it's not overly sweet, which I really like, you can really taste the strawberry, if you love strawberry you will love this! it's very moist on the inside. I took others advice and put 1/2 tsp of vanilla and  1/2 tsp of cinnamon and replaces canola oil with  1/4 cup strawberry yogurt. turns out lovely!

Perfect!  SO GOOD!.  Cut back 1/4C flour as another suggested.  This was easy and VERY good.  I made these up to go with Fuffy eggs and Grampa's corianderturkey sausage for BREAKFAST for DINNER night. :)

I absolutely love this recipe! I've done it a few times, and even started doing my own variations, for example:  - You can add cinnamon and/or ground ginger on the dry mix. - You can 1 cup of any fruits u'd like, and it works. - U can sprinkle sugar or brown sugar on top before baking, and it makes an awesome top.  Here are some ideas I tried to substitute the strawberries:  - bananas + strawberries  - blue berry + strawberries + raspberries + blackberries + a little of lemon zest  - Apple + cinammon + raisings  - Mango + orange zest + golden raisings. For this one, instead of 1/2 cup of milk, I added 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of orange juice. This one is, so far, my favorite!  Next, I'm gonna try pinapple and other not usual/tropical comboinations.

These muffins are perfect for breakfast, They are not super sweet which is exactly what I was looking for when I was searching for a strawberry muffin recipe. I have only used fresh strawberries so far, so I am not sure how well they do with frozen ones. I added a crumb topping but next time I will forgo that and just eat them plain. This is a really awesome recipe and it will be added to my permanent collection.

I'm not sure how these got a 4 star overall rating, they were only ok at best. Even after following some of the past reviewer advice and adding the "extras" I just found these to be very bland.  1st time I've ever been let down by choosing a recipe on the site by user ratings.  Sorry this one was not a keeper!

I've made this twice with the recommendations that other reviewers have given (1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup brown sugar) and it's awesome. Not too sweet and my husband loved them.

Girrrrrl, my house smells like Heaven! I have a new neighbor and wanted to bake something to take over to her and her family.  My strawberries were at the use 'em or lose 'em stage and I found this recipe.  OMG, I hope I can keep Hubby out of them so there's enough to share with our new neighbor!! I did increase the amount of berries. Worked like a charm.

These muffins turned out yummy! I made them for a class I am in and got rave reviews! I am glad I checked the reviews before making these as I did add the extra brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon. I also used fresh strawberries! This will be a good summer recipe since I love strawberries! Next time I will sprinkle a little cinnamon/sugar on top for more sweetness.

I did the following, as recommened by some: add 1 t cinnamon, 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Micro frozen strawberries (1 1/2 cups or so) til soft enough to smash with a spoon. Add strawberries and liquid. 

Makes 12 med-sized strawberry muffins, bake for 20 minutes. Great!

After complaints of lack of sweetness, the second time I added 1 tablespoon honey and I topped it with a mix of 1 tablespoon sugar & 1/2 teaspoon lemon peel from another recipe. I used olive oil instead of canola oil.

I added the 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar as other people have and found that it really improves the flavor of the muffins.  Also, I try and find the hardest strawberries possible because they cook better than the mushy ones.  I also cut a strawberry piece and place on the top of the muffins.  My b-friend absolutely loves them.  He is allergic to eggs, so instead of eggs I use 1/4 hot water and 1/2 teaspoon of yeast abstract diluted together, and even use Splenda instead of the regular white sugar.  They taste perfect even with substitutes.

I did only a couple of modifications, such as I didnt have Canola Oil,so I just used vegetable.I also added 1 tsp. Vanilla, used 3/4 cup of white sugar, and added more strawberries (close to 1 3/4 cup).  Me and my picky husband think that they turned out really well. I think that if I would have only put in the recommended amount of strawberries, it definetly would not taste that well. The strawberries give it a very nice moistness. so i would bump it up to like 2 or more cups next time. The recipe only made 6 Jumbo muffins for me (Oddly enough,I only have Jumbo tins or minis!) But they are very nice. I also REALLY sprayed the pan, cause I really hate it when they stick. Overall, very easy to make and delicious.

I added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 cup brown sugar and used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and these muffins came out perfectly.  It is a great recipe for using up extra strawberries.  They are especially tasty warm right out of the oven!

Excellent, super easy recipe. We added a simple muffin struesel topping which brought a touch of sweetness and finished them off just right. Fresh berries are the way to go if you've got access to them.

Delicious muffins!  I tripled the recipe and made 24 good-size muffins.  I agree that the muffins will be even prettier if you have a few extra strawberry pieces to tuck on top of the muffins before baking.

These muffins were great! You'll probably want to double the recipe :) I found that it was nice to put a few pieces of strawberry aside and then gently press them into the top of each muffin right before you put them in the oven.

The muffins first off were really bland and tasted like flour. The muffins were a nice color on top but the bottoms turned out really dark and almost burnt and that was just the mini muffins. The larger muffins I made I followed the cooking temp and time and every single one burnt.

i added about 2.5 tbsp of strawberry jam to the batter, and i made 24, I found the ingredients when making 24 were a little too thick and dry so i also added about 1/4 cup extra of milk. i didn't add any extra spices and they still turned out wonderful! i topped the muffins with a dusting of icing sugar and served them warm... MMMMMM very tasty, not too sweet at all.

I used white wheat flour and buttermilk in place of regular milk. I added 1 t. vanilla and the zest of 1/2 orange (lemon zest would also be good instead). This complemented the strawberry flavor without overpowering. It did seem like too much flour, so I suggest starting with 1 1/2 cups and add more at the end if the batter is very runny. I also added 1 cup cooked quinoa. This helps you feel full and adds protein.

These muffins are great - but I did make a few changes.  I used apple sauce instead of oil and I also followed other reviews and left out 1/4 cup of flour and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also put a sliced strawberry on the top of each muffin and then sprinkled it with white sugar to make them look nice.

Um, it wasn't that this was a bad recipe, but that me and the family messed up a bit on these... Let's start with we made 72 cupcakes at once.... and then we took out some sugar... substituted in some crushed hazelnuts... you know, the usual mess ups... 

Still tasted great!

Nothing earth-shattering but it did the job of giving my daughter the kind of muffins she wanted and everyone was happy. I did add 1/4 cup of water after I had the whole thing mixed because the batter was so thick. I got 16 muffins out of it.

These muffins were so yummy! Instead of making full sized muffins, I made mini muffins... I used 1 cup regular flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. Also I used half splenda and half sugar. They turned out delicious but I wish I would have read the other reviews and added some vanilla or cinnamin. They could have used a little more flavor. Good though :)

I made these this morning for my daycare kids:) but they are picky so I wont base my review on them, I tried one warm from the oven, delish! I did make the changes that alot of reviews did, I first doubled the recipe, added the cin,van. I used veg oil because that is what I had,cut the flour down a 1/4 CUP for each recipe., used frozen strawberries and thawed in micro, then mashed them,also made the struesel top. I think they could have baked longer but could be my oven, baked them for 22 minutes. I would definetely make these again. Tomorrow thinking I will make blueberry muffins :)

Would have rated 5 stars because i loved these muffins, but had to add a little extra to them. I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon & vanilla extract as another member suggested. Also a 1/4 cup of brown sugar..couldve even added a little more. If I didn't add the extra brown sugar they definitely wouldn't have been sweet enough.. but great recipe overall!

These were okay in my opinion, nothing special. I love strawberries, but had never had strawberry muffins before. I followed joshtymom's recommendations and added vanilla & cinnamon and used less flour. Their consistency was good and moist, the flavor was just lacking something.

I used egg substitute, about 1 1/4 c frozen strawberries, and per other reviews added a dash of cinnamon and vanilla to the batter, and sprinkled a little Splenda brown sugar on the tops. The brown sugar makes a HUGE difference, a nice thin crispy crust. The flavor of the muffins is pretty nice, nothing spectacular, but definitely nice. They looked beautiful, puffing way up over the tops, and I got 10 rather than 8 out of the batch.

I've already eaten three of these today----I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 c. brown sugar to the recipe, as several had suggested. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the muffin tops before baking. The muffins were perfectly done at 22 minutes. Very tasty, easy to prepare, and something new to make with fresh strawberries. Definitely a keeper recipe!

STRAWBERRY MUFFINS!!!

I followed other peoples suggestions and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon & 1/4 cup brown sugar to the mix.  I also made it a heaping cup of chopped strawberries so it probably was closer to a cup and a half. I also sprinkled the tops with a pinch of an even mix of brown and white sugar.Delicious, fresh and something new!!! I would have never thought to make strawberry muffins before this and it was totally worth it!!!
NOTE!!!  You know your oven best... if your oven runs hot start checking around 20-22 minutes.  One batch of mine was ever so slightly browner (not burnt though) than I would have liked at 25 minutes.

I added 1/4 brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers and included the vanilla essence as well. The muffins came out a nice light brown, the texture was spongey! The best bit was that the flavour of the strawberries was eccentuated. 

I made chocolate fudge sauce to drizzle on top just for fun.

I would use this recipe again but add more strawberries or try another fruit.

Good recipe, but needs a touch more flavoring. :) I pureed my strawberries since my little ones don't like chunks of fruit in their muffins. But the batter needs a touch more zest! Will add a touch of lemon and a bit more cinnamon and a little brown sugar next time.

These were really easy to make and tasted great. I did follow other reviews and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 of the total sugar called for. Also I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla extract. Also I sprinkled white sugar on top of the raw muffins before putting them in the oven. They came out great!

Delicious!  Be sure to add brown sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon to these.  Extra strawberries can't hurt either.  Will make again.

I also added: 1 tsp vanilla, 2 TB lemon zest and 2TB lemon juice. Added 1/4 c. brown sugar as well. I also used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour. I used the recommended amount of flour because I used frozen strawberries. Before i put them in the oven I also made a crumb topping with flour, sugar and butter then baked as directed. Yummers! The lemon strawberry really works!

Solid recipe.  The muffin consistency is very good.  Not too crumbly at all.  I think I didn't use enough strawberries and next time I might consider pureeing them for more distribution of the strawberry flavor because even with following other reviewers suggestion of adding some vanilla and cinnamon, it the flavor was lacking the sweetness I was looking for.  Also, I followed another reviewers proportion of whole wheat/white flour and next time I would only use white.  They still taste very good but I can tell they would be better with use of only white flour.  All in all though, a very solid muffin recipe.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this.  I read other recommendations and added 1 tsp Vanilla, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1 tsp Cinnamon & 1/4 c old fashioned oats.  I substituted the applesauce for the oil, whole wheat flour for white flour, splenda for the sugar, and good old fashioned egg whites for the eggs.  Delectable!  So fresh out the oven.  I always spray my muffin cups, so they don't stick to the paper when not using any fat.  Thanks to all!

Not bad fresh out of the oven, but a pretty boring flavor. After they cooled they had a strong baking powder after taste.

I was a bit skeptical of following other people's advice in adding the extra strawberries since I'm not really a big fan of the strawberry but I chopped them up into pretty small pieces and added an extra 1/2 cup because my kids love them. Wow! I've made them twice now and they are amazing. They've turned out very moist both times and I think chopping the strawberries into smaller pieces makes them look prettier. In my opinion these definitely need the addition of the 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon (more if you love cinnamon) . I added the 1/2 tsp vanilla both times just because it seems like it should be in there so I can't really comment on whether or not they lack flavor without it. The sugar/cinnamon mix sprinkled on top is yummy but the muffins are also delicious without. If using the topping make sure to sprinkle on very generously. The first time I didn't put a heavy sprinkling on and could barely taste it so it was kind of a waste. I have tried these in mini muffin tins and regular sized and I think the mini ones turn out a little better. With the addition of the extra strawberries I had a bit too much batter for my 24 mini muffin tin so I filled 3 of those silver muffin liners that you can just put straight in the oven without a muffin tin and they turned out great. I will be making this recipe again and again!

I made these last night and I must say that they are yummy.  I did make a few changes though after reading previous reviews.  I added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, increased the strawberries by 1/4 cup and decreased the flour by 1/4 cup.  I also sprinkled the muffins with a cinnamon sugar mixture before placing them in the oven.  They turned out awesome and I will be making these again soon.

With the added 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/4 c brown sugar these were absolutely the best muffins EVER!  I've never had strawberry muffins before - these are excellent.  The kids even chose these over the double chocolate chip muffins I made...now that says something!!!

Really great recipe!  I had a few hiccups,  but managed.  First, I didn't have milk, so I substituted watered down half and half :(  Not a good substitute, but I was desperate. haha.  I was pleasantly suprised.  Also, I doubled the batch, thinking that 8 was a small yield.  They must have been large muffins, because I ended up with about 24+ muffins.  There was batter all over the place!  Have to say they are yummy!

Good basic recipe, but couldn't really taste strawberries unless I bit into one.  Definitely a good breakfast muffin though; may use strawberry jelly to up the flavor.  Very good use of strawberries which are about to turn bad.

These turned out GREAT!! I recommend the recipe to anyone who feels like a fluffy yummy muffin! all I changed was used brown sugar rather then white, and added extra strawberries...otherwise there was no need for extra sugar, or less flour (As some other reviewers suggested) they were sweet and so yummy, I ate 3 of them as soon as they came out of the oven, ha ha

the only changes I made, after reading many reviews, was to add  1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I did not add the extra brown sugar as suggested by others, as I didn't want to make it 'unhealthier' :).  They turned out great! Very moist and flavourful.  I did scale the recipe down to 6 muffins, and sprayed with pam instead of using liners.  I will make this again, in a large batch, and freeze them.

These were not good. I really wanted to like them and took the advice of others and added vanilla and cinammon, brown sugar too which  didn't help they were tasteless. My 2 yr old daughter took one bite and her exact words "this doesn't taste very good"  Next time i will try a standard blueberry muffin recipe and just substitute the strawberries.

These were good muffins. I used fresh strawberries...and made 12 regular sized muffins. They turned out dry...I prefer moist muffins. I don't think that I will make these again.

Really good especially since they're not too sweet...which is perfect for me! I double the strawberries though.

The reciped as written is 2 stars - it is very bland. I have used many of the recommendations and tried this reciped a couple more times - added spices, vanilla, changed up the flour (whole wheat), changed the sugar and I still wouldn't give them more then a 4. There is still something missing, I think I might have to give up on this recipe soon.

These were so good!!! I have such a sweet tooth and discovering new muffin recipes is always a treat. I added the brown sugar as many others suggested. Would recommend these muffins to anyone and will definitely make them again

I Just pulled these out of the oven and let me tell you how good my house smells right now! I did follow some other reviews and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and a 1/4 c. brown sugar. I also used 1/4 c. sour cream and 1/4 c. milk instead of the 1/2 c. milk. I just tried one and it is very good!!

My family loved these muffins and they did not last long. I wish it made more. Next time I'll have to double the recipe. I added about a teaspoon of strawberry extract (flavor) and sprinkled a little sugar on the top of each before baking. Delish!

I made these muffins just as written, and they were wonderful! They had just the perfect amount of sweetness, and I loved the color of the strawberries! I used frozen strawberries, which worked very well. My family really enjoyed these. This recipe is a keeper!

These were amazing! I followed a lot of the tips from fellow bakers; I added cinnamon, vanilla extract, and reduced the baking powder lever (the first time I tried you could really taste it.) My husband took them to work and they were gone in an instant!

This recipe was delicious! I used self rising flour and omitted the baking powder and salt. I made mine in paper liners. They are easy and taste great. I'm going to try them with different fruits, also.Thanks for a great recipe!

Muffins baked up fluffy and moist.  Batter is a good base for other fruit such as blueberries and apples.  I will not buy "boxed" muffin mixes again.

This is a phenomenal recipe.  I tweaked it a little by using self-rising flour, due to the convenience, and I also added about 1/3 a cup of the fruit pureed and about a quarter cup of shaved coconut also pureed, to add a little flavor to the mix.  My wife loves these and I can't wait to make more.

Just made this recipe today for breakfast baked in a bread pan instead of a muffin tin. Taking in to account other reviews I made the following changes:
1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour with 1/2 cup white flour, 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar BLEND along with a scant 1/2 cup grandulated sugar mixed with splenda. Added 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 2 Tablespoons ground flax, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, and 2 Tablespoons extra milk.
The loaf took 35-40 minutes to bake. I sliced strawberries on the side and it was a healthy and really tasty breakfast. Husband love, love, loved it, and I did too! Try it - you'll not be sorry.

These muffins were very tasty although I did make a couple of changes to the recipe:
1. Decreased flour by 1/4 cup
2. Added 1/4 Cup of brown sugar
3. Add 1/2t of vanilla and a little cinnamon to the liquid mixture
4. Used homemade spiced applesauce instead of oil (a much healthier alternative)

The result was slightly sweet fruit muffins. I diced the strawberries quite small which seemed to distribute them well while still having chunks of strawberries. I also put half a small strawberry on top. I would definately use this recipe again. It's great to use up bruised strawberries.

Amazingly moist! I took advice from others and added a bit of extra milk,nutmeg,cinnamon and a pinch of ground clove. I also mixed in brown sugar and splenda baking blend instead of regular sugar. I mixed half wheat and half regular flour and threw in a handful of chocolate chips. Instead of oil I used applesauce w/ 1tbsp of veg. oil mixed in. I topped muffins with a sprinkle of sugar and chopped pecans. My boyfriend was very pleased!

Oh my goodness, this recipe was wonderful. With some advice from others I added the brown sugar, almond extract, and cinnamon. These were a big hit with my family especially my kids. I will definitely make them again. These were also really easy to make.

These were so simple to make and it was a good way to get rid of some strawberries that I had. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding 1 tsp vanilla. I was able to make 12 muffins with this recipe and when I put them in for 20 minutes, it was more than enough time. Next time I'll leave it in for 15 minutes and then check on it then. My husband doesn't like really sweet pastries so he thought these were "REALLY good muffins" and he said he could eat a bunch of them without feeling gross afterwards. He said there was a subtle flavor which he liked. I just had one for breakfast this morning and will be making this recipe again, experimenting with different fruit.

Whoa what went wrong with mine. I used frozen berries and they turned out awful. They are bland and the berries turned to brown slime. If they aren't better after completely cooling I will have to throw them away.

I liked these, they were tasty and light. However I only used 1/2 cup chopped frozen strawberries and added ~1/2 cup smashed bananas which made it a little sweeter. Next time I will add more strawberries with the bananas.

I love this recipe. Makes really moist and tender muffins, and is very versatile. 

I first made 6 jumbo strawberry muffins with the original 8 serve recipe, adding in the cinnamon, brown sugar and less flour as suggested by many. And I just finished eating 2 mini chocolate-chip muffins based on this recipe, swapping out the strawberries for chocolate chips and shaking in a generous amount of super-fine drinking chocolate powder. 

Using a convection oven, preheating 200 degrees and baking at 180 for 13 minutes, This is currently the only recipe that has worked with my mini-muffin pan!

Yum!

These were very good.  I added the 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp vanilla, but it still could have been sweeter.  Maybe next time I'll add more sugar.  Very good with butter.

Spontaneous YUMM's from the peanut gallery give this recipe a definite thumbs up.  I used fresh strawberries and followed the recipe as written.  After reading reviews that expressed concern for sweetness we experimented and found brushing the top of the baked muffin with melted butter and dipping it in sugar provided the answer for us.

These were very good. My first time making muffins, or baking anything and they turned out very well. I did add a bit of extra sugar and some brown sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. The Sweetness was just right for me. I used frozen whole strawberries and put them in muffin cups. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Great recipe! I did make some of the recommended adjustments. I took out 1/4 cup of flour, and added 1/2 teas. vanilla and 1/2 teas. cinnamon. I also added a bit more milk to adjust the thick consistency (about 1/8 - 1/4 cup additional).  I topped the muffins with streusal topping (1/3 cup brown sugar, 1T all purpose flour, 1/8 teas. cinnamon, and 1T butter cut in.)
I love how easy the recipe is but because of the necessary adjustments I gave the recipe 4 out of 5 stars.

Delicious!! My son who doesn't like strawberries loved these muffins.  I did add 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/4 cup brown sugar like the other reviews recommended.

Wonderful!  I used fresh strawberries, and these muffins turned out moist and tasty, just right.  Very easy to follow.  This recipe made six (6) jumbo size muffins.  I wouldn't change a thing.  My daughter says they are the best I've ever baked.  Will definitely make these again!

I sent these to school for my son's snack day.  I made mini-muffins thinking the kids may not want to eat very many.  I was wrong, they all at three or four!  They are delicious!

This was great! I didn't follow it as is though. I added a 1/2 cup more sugar, 1/2 cup more strawberries, a teaspoon of vanilla, zest of two lemons, and sprinkled the top with brown sugar. It turned out wonderful! Will definitely make again.

Used brown sugar instead of white. Used a teaspoon of strawberry (smuckers) inside each.  I made  large muffins (for a coffee shop) so the recipe made 4 large and 1 small/half size muffins. Topped each with cinnamon sugar and then spiraled the top with cinnamon glaze once cooled.  Tasted the 1/2 muffin and thought it was OK, not fabulous.  We'll see what the coffee shop crowd has to say about them. Something different, so that's a plus.

I added 1/2t vanilla to wet ingredients and 1t Cinnamon to the dry. I used fresh berries and added an additional 1/4c brown sugar, using Splenda for the white sugar called for in the original recipe. The flavor was great, but, based on other reviews I reduced the flour by 1/4c and used more berries. Do NOT do this... the additional juice from the berries caused the muffins to cook on top but not on the bottom. I even cooked them 5 extra minutes. I think next time I'll use the recommended amount of flour and berries. I like the cinnamon, vanilla and brown sugar though. I believe it would be a 4 star recipe without my mess-up. Thanks for posting!

No modifications necessary according to my family, although it's apparently very different than most muffin recipes -- less sweet, more savory.  We liked it so much we used it as a base for many different flavors, adding honey, oats, chocolate chips, peppermint extract, candy canes, raisins, ect. to taste.

Great recipe. No need to add extra milk/cinnamon/etc. 
To prevent the strawberries from falling to the bottom, be sure to (as the instructions say) mix with the dry ingredients first!  If you find them bland, invest in a bottle of strawberry extract, and add 1/2 tsp of that. These muffins are best served warm, with butter.

Instead of making muffins- I made a loaf - i changed some things per everyone comments - added a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon. Reduced flour to 1 and 1/2 cups. I made two loaves one using strawberries one using blueberries - both turned out amazing!!! I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of both loaves and cooked them for about 35 min on convection baking.

Swapping organic Demerara and raw cane sugars, adding the brown sugar, and vanilla extract, allowed the light sweet taste of the strawberries to take centre stage!

Very tasty.  I did add some vanilla and cinnamon.  My batter was really  dry so added a splash of milk and got a good consistency for muffins.  Could use more strawberries.  Next time I will use 1-1/2 cups.

I have made this recipe at least five times and we love it!  I did listen to some of the other reviewers and add 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also add another 1/2 cup of strawberries.
I don't have a muffin tin, so I made it as a cake.  Yum!!!!

Thanks for the recipe and thanks everyone for the tips on what you did. My granddaughter helped me make these, and she wanted her Mom to get the recipe. They were well liked! I adjusted the recipe to 12 muffins, because 12 is better than 8 at our house. The recipe then says 1 1/2 eggs, where I used 2. Air drying the fruit for a while was a fantastic tip! No mushy strawberries! I always add my fruit to the wet mix instead of the dry so the flour coating doesn't clump. I even do this with dry fruit like raisins and craisins so the flour mix doesn't sit in the cracks of the fruit.  For our household, we like the end result better this way. I also used one cup whole wheat flour and the rest white. Next time I'll try it with part quick oats as well. I added 1 tsp vanilla, about 3/4 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. In my oven they were done in 20 minutes. We ate them with strawberry-rhubarb jam.  Mmmmm!

These were very good. I was looking for a healthy baking recipe, wondering if there was such a thing, when I luckily came across this! With barely any oil and only 1/2 cup of sugar, these are the perfect sweet treat! The yield is incorrect though, these make more like 12 large muffins. I would have added more strawberries to the batter because I thought that the muffins needed more chunks. I added a splash of vanilla and some lemon zest, but these would also be fantastic with chocolate chips, orange zest, etc. These would also be great with a light whipped cream frosting on top.

Just made these and decided to keep them all for ourselves instead of give them away to friends.  I did them exactly as the recipe stated, however found them to be missing something - good but not outstanding and I only like to give away outstanding results.  Thank you for the recipe though, we are enjoying them here!

Followed the recipe and I wouldn't make them as is again. They are too bland. Add vanilla, spices, just something.

I thought it was a little bland, my husband thought it was delicious.  To me they tasted like strawberry pancakes, which makes sense since he is a pancake fan and I am not much of one.  Good crispness on the outside and  fluffy moist cake in center. Inside also was firm enough to handle the strawberry liquid without leaving it gooey or dry. Quality recipe where baking formula is concerned, but needs more ........something to be great.

My batter came out too dry - I used fresh strawberries, so maybe a little juice from frozen was missing? But I added about half container of strawberry Greek yogurt, and it was great. I always do a cinnamon sugar dust on my muffin pan, and then my son sprinkled a few mini chocolate chips on each. I didn't get a full pan of mini muffins from the original size recipe - one short.

These muffins where ok, my fiance enjoyed them but i found the mix was way to thick and so i had to mix in a little milk. I added 1/4 cup brown suger,1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cinnamon. And made a little topping with melted butter, white sugar, and cinnamon. These are pretty good just not as sweet as i like them.

It was perfect, just the way it is. Add a scoop of ice cream for vanilla. I don't understand why someone would alter this by adding Cinnamon or Nutmeg, Bleccch. Save it for apple muffins. Seriously?

i made these they were so amazing. my dad devoured them like no tomorrow i love how this site allowd you to adjust the receipt. though if you got to make 24 muffins in one batch you have to add almost 1/3 cup milk i poured a little at a time until the batch was just right. my computer isnt allowing me to add the pictures but it was amazing. thank you to the poster.

Awesome way to make use of rapidly presiding strawberries.  Thank you to the o.p. and the reviewers for modification tips.  The sugar on top made a most excellent crust. 

I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1.5 tsp of vanilla. In lieu of cinnamon, i added 1/4 cup of Hershey's cocoa and also 1/4 of milk chocolate chips.  

I used 2 cups of strawberries; makes for a gooey chewey center.  Smells very, very good. 

Happy baking,  happy eating All!

To say I can't cook is an understatement, but I followed this and it was fantastic! I added the vanilla and cinnamon like some others recommended and made it in a bread pan. It came out so good I couldn't believe I actually made it!

They tasted of baking powder, weren't quite sweet enough for my preferences, and didn't have enough strawberry flavor.

I've tried this recipe and it turned out just wonderful. I added a little more sugar and strawberries then in a recipe. And I also added cinnamon and sprincled on top with brown sugar before baking. Everybody who tried them, loved them a lot. They are very easy and fast to make and have basic ingridients that everyone will find at their home! I suggest everybody to try this recipe!

Definitely a keeper. Easy, quick and they taste like home made biscuits with fresh strawberry jam! I always try new recipes as written, and then modify to my tastes, but not this one, its perfect as is. Would also be excellent with fresh cherries, peaches or apples!

Perfect as is. I was looking to use up my strawberries before they went bad So may have used a few extra strawberries. Also sifted dry ingredients together before adding liquid. As many have said these are not supper sweet but that is because they are muffins and not cup cakes. If you want something sweeter then by all means add the extra sugar and such but I don't think it needs it.

As per the advice of others I used 1.5 cups of strawberries, vanilla (I used a full teaspoon) and I added brown sugar as well as the white sugar (about a tablespoon). LOVED these! Sweet, moist and they taste like they're from a bakery! I added sprinkles for my young kids.

Living in Japan, it's hard to find a good muffin recipe that doesn't require ingredients I can't normally find in my local grocery. Not only were these simple, but a perfect snack for my two rambunctious boys. Not to mention a great way to use up all our strawberries before they go bad. I took the advice of others and added the vanilla and cinnamon. Perfection! Thanks for such a great recipe.

Just made these. Read all reviews first and made the following changes. 1 1/2 cups strawberries instead of 1 cup. 1/4 c white sugar & 1/4 c brown. Reduced flour to 1 1/2 cups. Added 1 tsp vanilla. Also since i usually don't bake with oil, i substituted that with butter. Had one hot out of the oven. It's ok. A bit tart. Maybe next time i should have kept the 1/2 cup white sugar instead of reducing it to 1/4 cups. Did not try adding cinnamon as i didn't want it to over power the taste of the berries. Waiting for them to cool so i can test them on the kiddies :)

Done in 20 mins. Made 10 regular size muffins.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and modified this recipe slightly.  I added vanilla and cinnamon and used a mixture of brown and white sugars.  I left out 1/4 cup of flour as one reviewer suggested, but then added it in at the last minute because the batter looked a little too wet - I should have left it out because this turned out a little dry.  I also almost added an extra 1/2 cup of strawberries, but changed my mind on that as well - another decision I should have gone with.  I will definitely make this again with 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/2 cups strawberries.  I may or may not add the 1/2 tsp cinnamon, but either way I am willing to bet this will be perfect.

Quite yummy! I had to make this recipe with brown sugar instead of white sugar because we were completely out of white sugar.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I used frozen strawberries completely thawed.  I also put some of the strawberry juice from the thawing in with the other ingredients.  My muffins turned out great!  They rose and were a little brown on the top.  I left them in for 25 minutes as the recipe stated.  My boyfriend even said they were "alright" - which is "good" in his book!

This wasn't great. I needed to make about a cup of strawberries into something, but like everyone else, I thought they  were bland. 2 of my 5 kids didnt like them enough to finish theirs. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. I am a little baffled on how to make these more flavorful. I might mess with the recipe. Almond extract with sliced almonds on top might help with flavor and texture. I will not be making this as written again.

These were amazing! I thought they were up there with Costco muffins in yumminess. I did follow the recommendations of others though; I cut the flour by a 1/4 cup and added a teaspoon each of pure vanilla extract and cinnamon.

Turned out great!  Did add a little more strawberries because I had them and didn't want to waste them. Also, added some vanilla and cinnamon because we are fans of both.  I know my kids will be asking for more as soon as they are gone!

This was a really tasty, mildly sweet treat! I made some changes based off other reviews.  I added in 1/2 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon, as well as cutting out 1/4 cup of flour, and adding an extra 1/3 cup of strawberries.  It turned out very moist and delicious.  I was baking at someone else's house and didn't have a muffin tin, so I followed the idea of using a bread pan, and it worked out quite well.

I thought it wouldn't be sweet enough, but didn't change anything except for the yield (I made 24). I think anything else would overpower the strawberries and strawberry muffins that don't taste like strawberries are kind of a let down. Only thing I changed was adding a single blueberry on the top (for 4th of July). Perhaps because blueberries are incredibly sweet to start with, it made up for the sugar glaze I was going to add if they weren't sweet enough.

Amazingly delicious!!! I made these as written the only changes I made was finely dice 9 strawberries and let them soak in 1 tbsp of sugar for 15 min while I prepared the rest. I used brown sugar instead of white, and used applesauce instead of the oil (tried to make these as healthy as possible) also added vanilla extract. They came out moist and full of strawberry flavor, these only lasted 2 days! I made two batches one as mini muffins, and regular sized muffins. I will be making again but going to make them with white whole wheat flour and maybe add some cinnamon and nutmeg for more flavor! I highly recommend these!

Wonderful base recipe! I just tried this, and after taking the other reviewers advise, this is what I came up with:
Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla. Also used 1/4 cup of both white and brown sugar. But the best for me was I used cranberries(always have on hand) instead of the strawberries. Wow, what a great punch of sweet and sour. The inside was really moist and flavorful.
Great start to a nice muffin base. So many things one can do with this one.

This recipe was so good the next day I made another batch with fresh strawberries and blueberries!  Added vanilla and a little cinnamon.  Trying this one again today and I'm going to do half whole wheat and half white flour with my same strawberry blueberry mix.  I did add more berries than the recipe calls for.  I always do!

These were pretty good. I doubled the recipe (lots of boys to feed!)and took another member's advice of adding 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinammon, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I topped each muffin with a thin slice of strawberry and sprinkled with a little brown sugar and cinammon before baking. They came out real pretty. My only critique is that the texture isn't real "bready" like you would expect a muffin to be (I was thining banana bread density), it's a little harder almost like the outside of a biscuit..yummy though! I'll try these again for sure, maybe add another 1-1.5 tsp baking powder.

these muffins were so good! I doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp. of vanilla as other reviewers suggested. I also added a bit more strawberries, but that is to your liking. They turned out so moist and flavorful. I am not a big muffin fan, but I really liked these! They are easy to make so it was a good recipe to have my kids help with! I will definatly make them again!

These were great.  Not as light and fluffy as I might have liked (more of a biscuit consistency), but great nonetheless.  Doubled the recipe and added some blueberries.

Loved this recipe. My 8 year old daughter ate 3 right away..piglet,lol. I added more sugar as I had a sweet tooth and more strawberries. They turned out so moist and yummy. I used frozen strawberries and didn't have any problems with extra liquid.

I took other suggestions and reduced the flour by 1/4 cup and instead added 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Then I did some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Finally, added some vanilla to the liquid and the recipe went from good to stellar.  yum!

I made these muffins as is. I didn't have canola so I used vegetable oil. Don't think that made a difference. I used thawed frozen strawberries. 

  I added cinn/sugar to some tops and that made them better. the last 4 I added 1t vanilla and a strussel topping and that made them even better.

 The batter itself is ok. I think next time I will keep the vanilla in and mix cinnamon in with the batter.

I really loved this! I made the recipe as is increased to 12. Newly trying my hand at baking. Next time I will use less flower. They were kinda heavy, dense. I'll add vanilla, as well. Otherwise they were amazing! Definitely keeping this one around.

these muffins are very yummy! like other reviewers, i made a few adjustments: added 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and decreased flour by 1/4 cup. i also used at least 1 1/2 cups of fresh strawberries (i think if you use much more than this, there's not enough batter to separate the strawberries and the inside of the muffin gets a bit gooey).  I diced them up really small to make sure there was strawberry goodness in every bite.  oh, and i got 12 regular-sized muffins.  i can't decide if they are better with cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top, or by themselves. must try a few more just to be sure.....!

These were very bland and not what I hoped for at all. I baked them in paper muffin cups and it was hard to get the cups off. They seemed to be completely baked through (even with toothpick test), but the strawberries seemed to turn to mush inside the bottom of the muffin. It tasted more like strawberry oatmeal to me.   (I did put a few back in to cook longer, but it didnt change. The outside got harder yet the inside was still a thick oatmeal consitancy.)

These are really good, easy to make and once baked they freeze well for another day.  This is one of those recipes that most of us would have the ingredients on hand for other than the berries, great when they are plentiful and in season.

As written, I give this recipe 4 stars, but it has 5 star potential. Made it as written the first time, and they were fine, but the second time I made these changes. Used 1 1/4 cup strawberries which I mashed with my potato masher, slightly. Still had some good chunks of berries, but more of the juice seeps out to add flavor to the muffin. Used buttermilk instead of regular milk, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup sour cream.  These changes made for a moist, sweet muffin balanced out by the tang of the buttermilk and sour cream. Just lovely.

I've made these quite a few times, and I always love them.  I do the alterations suggested (1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 2 cups of strawberries) and I think that helps.  I make mini muffins instead of the standard size and they take 18-20 mins at 375.  One batch typically makes a little over 3 dozen mini muffins, and if I calculated it right, they  are about 50 calories each.  I've used fresh strawberries and strawberries I've frozen and they've come out the same.

They are not overwhelmingly sweet, but it's still a nice little homemade treat!

They were quite lovely and I had fun making these with my younger brother! :] Although I would probably add some more sugar or pick sweeter strawberries next time as the strawberry portion of the muffins were a bit tart. Also, the batter tastes delicious!

Yay! Super easy, even for a novice like me, and delicious! (I also added cinnamon, brown sugar, extra strawberries, and vanilla as per other reviewers.)

I used whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of oil.  I made one batch with the strawberries chopped but they just oozed juice while baking and made them so ugly with brownish liquid all stuck to the sides.  For the 2nd attempt I pureed the strawberries and it made them much prettier and the taste was great but the texture was a little gummy in the middles even after cooking for extra time.

There is a reason that blueberry muffins are more popular - strawberries just have too much water in them.  The muffin recipe itself is ok and everyone enjoyed the muffins despite the sogginess around the berries.

I was skeptical about these but it actually turned out very good. I used buttermilk instead of milk and added a dash of vanilla extract. The batter was very stiff, but muffins were actually airy and moist. Most of the flavor here comes from the berries and with the ripe summer berries it was great. Everyone from my toddler to his grandma enjoyed these muffins. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

By far the easiest muffin recipe I've used.  Delicious - perfect amount of sweetness, which is not too sweet.  I often have to halve the sugar in most recipes, but I don't have to alter the quantities in this recipe (although I do add 1 tsp of vanilla). I usually double the recipe because the children gobble them up for breakfast & take them to school.  They go fast.

I thought these were pretty good - I used fresh ripe strawberries and followed the recipe to the letter with one exception - I added a tsp of vanilla.  I thought they were tasty, if a bit plain.  I think next time I'll do a streusel on top for a bit of extra flavour.  Other than that, they were enjoyable and easy to make.

QUICK, EASY BUT LACKING IN  FLAVOR.
These muffins were a breeze to make and I wish I would have read through some of the reviews before making.  I made the recipe exactly as written and they turned out bland.  I am not giving up on this recipe because they were so easy to make.  I will try this again with the reviewer recommendation of adding vanilla and brown sugar and decreasing the flour content.

great recipe to build from. like the others i added vanilla, cinnamon, and also a pinch of nutmeg. to make it a little more on the healthy side i used 1/4 cup applesauce in place of the oil and 3/4cup of whole wheat four. these are just delicious!! especially with the strawberry butter (used recipe given in previous review)!!!!  these are more like bread cups but perfect for breakfast or throw in as a snack for the kids! these won't last until my husband gets home to even try them!  so thank you for the recipe and everyone's reviews!!

I just made these.  My hubby really liked them, and he is not really a big fan of muffins, cakes etc.  I did what everyone else said to do and it turned out very good.  I also (after they got out of the oven) put butter and sugar on the top.  Very good. I will make them again. Would be great with coffee or milk!

I liked this recipe.  I like that they are not overly sweet as well.  I ended up cutting up my strawberries and squeezing a little lime juice on them and added a tablespoon of brown sugar and about a half teaspoon of cinnamon to them and let them sit while I mixed the remaining ingredients.  I also added one of those individual serving cups of granny smith applesauce and decreased the oil a little.  Baked at 375 for exactly 25 minutes.  They were not overly brown but a toothpick test came out clean so I took them out and cooled in the pan as directed for 10 minutes.  After cooling completely I stored in the refrigerator in a ziplock.  This morning I heated up one in the toaster over for a few minutes and it was perfect.  Will make this recipe again and will probably experiment with other berries as well.  Yummy!

Excellent recipe!  Have used it many times and everybody loves them.  I have also used many different mixes of frozen fruit and the muffins come out great every time.  I normally double the recipe which makes an even 2 dozen use 2 1/2 - 3 cups of fruit.  These muffins freeze great as well and just pop them in lunches and are nicely thawed once coffee time and recess arrives.

I added the extras that other reviewers suggested (1/2 tsp of vanilla & cinnamon, 1/4 c of brown sugar). I also did probably 1 1/2 cups of fresh strawberries. And I only did 1 1/2 cups of flour. They made 12 regular sized muffins.  So far I am about 10 or 15 minutes past the 25 minute mark, and they are still a little doughy on the bottom. I assume it is taking a little longer because of the amount of strawberries I added. Next time I wont be adding as much cinnamon.   My final thought: They are yummy with the extras, but Ill use less cinnamon next time.

I too added the brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. My wife has decreed that these are her all time favorite muffins! I also made the strawberry butter that one of the reviewers posted. The first time I prepared it just like he said too. The second time I found that I was almost out of butter, but I had some creamed cheese on hand, so I combined chopped strawberries, cream cheese, powdered sugar, and butter together. I highly recommend taking the time do this. This really takes it to the next level!

I followed the suggestions made by other reviewers as follows...  Only used 1 1/2 cups flour, added 1/2 teaspoon of both cinnamon & vanilla, added 1/4 cup of brown sugar, finely chopped 1 cup strawberries, sprinkled sugar on top of muffins as well.  Made 24 mini muffins, cooked for 15 minutes. Next time I will try it with only 1/4 teaspoon of salt as I could taste the salt using 1/2 teaspoon. Good way to use bulk strawberries.  My son who doesn't like fruit gobbled them up.

These were good, everyone enjoyed them. I found them to be a little bit dense, they didnt fluff up like other muffins I had made, but the flavor was definitely there. I added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon, as well as about 1 tsp vanilla extract as there are my staple muffin ingredients!

was ok, I did do the changes that were suggested by the others added the brown sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and did the sugar cinnamon on top, it was just missing something.  I will have to play with the recipe a little and see if I can find out what it was missing.

I picked up some berries in Watsonville, CA and couldn't eat them fast enough.  These muffins were the perfect way to use them up.  I followed the advice of many other posts and added cinnamon, brown sugar and vanilla.  They turned out beautifully. I made "Strawberry Bread" also from this site  (I had a LOT of strawberries to use!) and I loved the cinnamon in the bread.  Next time I will use more cinnamon in the mufffins.  All in all, these are delish!  Thanks for the recipe!

these were fairly easy, i used fresh strawberries, i used a little extra strawberries and made 6 jumbo muffins, good flavor and texture, freezes well.  I did turn the broiler on for a few seconds to get the top browned better, i like the top crispy

Absolutely yummy! I followed the other readers' recommendations and added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, upped the strawberries by 1/4 cup and reduced the flour by 1/4 cup. Not only that I baked them in mini muffin tin (24 mini muffins) for 20 minutes. The kids just gobbled them up and I am going to make a second batch right away to freeze for quick on the go snacks

Made this for the 2nd time in 2 weeks. Both batches turned out perfect. I followed the advice of other reviewers and subtracted 1/4 cup of flour and added 1/2 t of cinnamon, 1/2 t of vanilla, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. DELICIOUS and EASY to make.

the muffins themselves turned out very soft and moist.  i used melted butter instead of canola oil, and added 1 cup rhubarb with the 1 cup of strawberries; rounded out recipe to a good dozen. very fruity and delicious.

Yummy! Added 1t vanilla and 1t cinnamon, 1/2 cup more strawberries, and 1 more egg(i thought the mix was a little dry). Sprinkeled tops with cinnamon sugar. They came out perfect! Not overly sweet, just right. I will be making these again. Thanks.

Great recipe... I used the suggested vanilla (1/2 tsp)/cinnamon (1/2 tsp)/brown sugar (1/4 cup) modifications with fresh strawberries. I chopped about 1/2 cup strawberries VERY fine and the other 1/2 cup with more traditional chunks... With using the almost liquefied (that is a bit of an exaggeration) strawberries, I think the berries' natural sweetness would have sufficed--I'm not sure the brown sugar was necessary. Still verrry good.

Great recipe!  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I added vanilla and cinnamon like other reviewers suggested.  I also subbed 1/2 of the canola oil for browned butter to give it a richer flavor.  so they're DELICIOUS, but not exactly the original recipe.  I doubled the recipe and got about 70 mini muffins.  FYI, if you're doing mini muffins, they only bake for about 15 minutes.  Also, a little cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top adds a nice touch :)

These were good muffins, but not what I was expecting. They weren't sweet enough for me. Also around the fresh straweberries the muffin was soggy. I tried to cook my second batch longer to eliminate some of the soggyness but it didn't really work out that well, it just made the tops harder.  I'm going to keep looking for a better strawberry muffin recipe.

These were pretty good.  They were the second muffins I've ever made (first being the "To die for blueberry muffins").  

I made very minor changes, one of which was using frozen strawberries instead of fresh, but I don't feel that it makes a difference.  Though I read that some people did complain about the frozen strawberries having a "watery" taste, that did not happen with mine at all; they were sweet, soft, and jam-like, and I was content with them.  

Another change I made was adding a bit of vanilla, brown sugar, and cinnamon, though the muffins still tasted a lot less strong than expected, which I kind of like because do I enjoy the subtle sweetness of the strawberries.  However, my boyfriend told me that he liked the blueberry ones a lot more, and said that these were too bland for his tastes.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly, and as written this is a four star recipe.  The second time I made it I added the vanilla, brown sugar and cinnamon as other reviewers have suggested and with those changes it is worthy of five stars

Delicious.  Definitely add the vanilla and cinnamon.  I also used 1/4 cup less of the flower, and did half regular flower and half whole wheat flower, and added about 1/4 cup more of the strawberries.  Only other thing I would do differently is cook them 5-10 minutes less, they were a little hard on the outside.

Yum!!  I did add 1 tsp. vanilla like some other reviews noted, used about 1.5+ cups of strawberries cause I had them.  The batter was SO thick I got worried, so I added a couple splashes of extra milk and stirred again.  It was still pretty thick, but it turned out great.  Batch made 12 muffins with a bit leftover.

This recipe is wonderful for those with allergies or other dietary restrictions.  It is easily adapted.  I made mine with spelt flour and used Stevia in place of the sugar.  I also substituted yogurt for the milk, and added the cinnamon and vanilla.  They were wonderful!  Easily the best recipe I have tried since beginning my diet!  I almost forgot they didn't have any sugar in them :)

These were pretty good, but they definitely needed more flavor. I wanted to make it the original way the first time to see if it would be worth making again with tweaks. I probably would make these again but with adding either vanilla or strawberry extract.

I used fresh chopped strawberries and fresh blueberries.  I also added a few teaspoons of  Polaner 100% All Natural Fruit Spread to the final batter.  This is a super easy recipe and I like the fact that I did not have to use butter!  The taste is good.

These muffins turned out great. I made a few changes as the other reviewers suggested. I used half whole wheat flour, and added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. I also decreased the sugar from 1 cup to 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. Very moist and it had a great flavor from the strawberries.

These were decent, just not exactly what I expected. I was imagining light and fluffy and these were very dense. I added some vanilla, and I don't think they needed it - that's all I could taste.

This was an excellent recipe.  I made a few of the changes as suggested by others such as substituting 1/4c brown sugar for an equal amount of the white sugar, added vanilla and cinnamon and sprinkling the tops with a mixture of white/brown sugar and cinnamon.  I doubled up the recipe to fill my 12 cup muffin tin and with the extra, made 12 mini muffins which turned out great - just bake them for 15 minutes.  Will definitely make these again.

Wonderful!  I had to use up some strawberries quick and this was the perfect recipe!  Didn't have canola oil so I used vegetable oil , but otherwise followed directions exactly.  I was nervous that theses would taste more "muffin" than "strawberry", but I was wrong.  And other reviewers are right about how good it made the house smell while they were baking.  Will make again and again! Thank you for the recipe!

These were so so so yummy ... I followed the recipe exactly; however, I was out of milk so I used some whipped creme (1 cup) mixed with one cup of water ... otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly ... I did sprinkle the top of the muffins with cinnamon mixed with sugar ... I made six large muffins out of the recipe ... oh, I did use maybe 1-1/2 to 2 cups of strawberries ... in any event, they were beautiful, moist, delicious ... hardly bland ... very strawberrieee and yummeee and almost professional looking!!!

Instead of strawberries I used fresh cherries and added some walnuts. Absolutely Perfect.

Yummy!  Based on the original recipe, I only gave these muffins 4 stars, but they certainly have 5 star potential with a few modifications. They are light, very moist, and not overly sweet. I did add brown sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon after reading the other reviews and think rhubarb would work well in this recipe, toowith some additional sugar.

I had trouble with this recipe. Some of the strawberries, after being cooked, were mushy and super moist. I think if I had chopped them into smaller pieces this would not have happened. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, which was good.

To spice up these muffins, I added 2 tablespoons orange juice and 1 tablespoon orange zest.  I followed previous suggestions and added 1/2 tablespoons vanilla and replaced 1/4th of the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also sprinkled the tops of these muffins with raw sugar before baking them.  These simple additions fixed the bland flavor and resulted in beautiful strawberry orange muffins!

I made mine with fresh strawberries.  Added extra strawberries and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla as several had suggested. They were great.  I'm not sure why but I got 12 nice sized muffins and the cooking time was exact for me.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I had some strawberries that were on their last leg, and I thought I would give this recipe a try. I am glad I did! I made them exactly as called for, but I didn't measure the berries, so I'm pretty sure I put extra in there. I sprinkled the tops w/ cinnamon sugar, as was suggested by another reviewer. My family was real happy with these muffins. I'm glad I tried them. I will definately make these again. Thanks for posting:)

Very nice muffins.  I added vanilla but otherwise kept the rest the same.  These were big muffins--don't know if it's my liners or what, but I ended up with 9 huge ones.  If I had only filled them 3/4 full I probably could have gotten 12.  Thanks for the recipe--bf liked them a lot.

I made the recipe "as is" and they baked up beautifully but lacked flavor.  I didn't want a very sweet muffin, but these were too bland. Maybe next time I will add some brown sugar, vanilla & cinnamon as other reviewers suggested.

These muffins were ok at best. I used other reviewers comments about adding the cinnamon, brown sugar (Splenda)and vanilla,but the came out very dry. I also used regular Splenda for the sugar. I wasn't happy with the texture, but the flavor was ok.

I made these with my son and they turned out great.  I didn't have strawberries so we used frozen mixed berries.  At the suggestion of a few other reviewers  I added 1/4 c brown sugar and some vanilla and used 1/4 c less flour.

My muffins came out delicious! I did alter the recipe a bit - Instead of white flour, I used a combination of whole wheat flour (mostly), soy flour, and oats. I used dark brown sugar instead of white, and a combination of ground flax seed and strawberry applesauce in place of all the oil. I also added 1 tsp each of cardamom, nutmeg, and vanilla extract.  The cardamom goes especially well with the strawberries.  This is the first time I have made strawberry muffins, and I'll definitely make them again! It was a great way to use up the leftover frozen strawberries I had from smoothie-making over the summer.

I had no problems baking these muffins as the recipe was pretty much straightford.I liked the texture and moistness of the muffin, but I liked mine a little more sweeter. I shall add some strawberry jam to my next batch.
Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very good with the added suggestions from other users. 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 cup brown sugar. I didn't use a full 1 3/4 cups of flour. The recipe says 8 muffins but I got 12 full size muffins from mine... also, baking for 25 minutes would have been too long. 20 minutes was plenty for me!

Excellent Base for muffins. I used 1 cup of blueberries. I put sugar cinnamon in first before putting batter in.  Delicious.  I will continue using this as a base for berries, etc.  Thanks!

I substituted blueberries for the strawberries.  I usually don't measure to much but it was about 2 cups of blueberries.  My family loved them!  I'll be using this recipe a lot it is very simple and quick.

I made these as the recipe stated, since that is what I believe you should review on. These are edible but not great. I was hoping to use these for a bake sale, but they stick too much to the papers to sell.  Luckily my 3 year old seems to like them.

I think this recipe is a good start for a muffin recipe because you can throw in almost anything to make them your own. 

I stirred in 1/4 cup strawberry preserves and 1 tsp. almond extract. I would recommend adding 1 tsp. orange zest and will try that next time! 

My muffins turned out very yummy. Mildly sweet, they browned on the top and had a pretty pink color inside.

Pretty good and very easy to make. Next time I will add a little cinnamon sugar to the tops before I bake just for a little extra sweetness.

I doubled this recipe and added a splash of   vanilla, 1/2 cup brown sugar, a little more fresh strawberries than called for and the juice and zest of 1/2 a lemon. They turned out moist, flavorful, like jammy muffins.

I really liked these muffins. To make them healthier, I substituted 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour. Also, I would take of a minute or two of the baking time. They made a healthy and yummy breakfast for the week.

These muffins were not good at all.  No flavor, strange texture, stuck to muffin paper, & did not brown at all.  I had to add extra milk because there wasn't enough to mix the flour mixture.  How in the world did this get 4 stars?!

After adding more vanilla and a smash (or two) of strawberry vodka these muffins were full of flavour.  They smelled great, looked fantastic and tasted delicious!

Not a good recipe. I don't know how it got such great reviews. Even after I added the cinnamon and vanilla that other reviewers added it did not have a lot of flavor. It was easy to make but didn't taste great. I recommend finding a new recipe.

Added some brown sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg based on other suggestions; I also added a small handful of Quaker oats. I pureed half of my strawberries and chopped the other half. I also added some blueberries to this mixture. Muffins rose fine, taste good- chewy and moist. Only issue is that they stick to the baking cups.

These were great for morning tea. They are a great way to use the strawberries from the garden. They were quite plain but still tasty. would reccommend if you have leftover strawberries or a strawberry plant.

Followed the recipe exactly. Excellent texture; however, major lack in the flavor. Something is missing here... They don't quite have a taste. Sugar needs to be added at least. Maybe some vanilla. I don't know, but this one needs some flavor boost.

I followed both previous add-in suggestions by including vanilla, cinnamon, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and substituting 1 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour.  I also added some raisins as my husband loves them...the muffins are so moist and delicious!  Oh, and I had to add extra milk.
Next time I am going to add CHOCOLATE CHIPS for that added ROMANCE :-)

These muffins were delicious. I made the mistake of overbaking them, so they were too dry. They would have been better if they were sweeter though.

These were okay. Like others said, there wasn't much flavor. I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and some vanilla. I think next time I might mix in some fresh pineapple to make the flavor a little more pop.

Based on earlier reviews, I doubled the recipe (It easily made 24 that way.) and added 1 teaspoon vanilla and an extra cup of strawberries.  (That would be 1/2 tsp vanilla and a total 1 1/2 cups strawberries for the recipe as-is.)  It was a hit!  My kids loved them, and my husband and I enjoyed them with coffee.  I think the extra strawberries made a difference, plus they were really ripe and sweet.  Remember, they are muffins, not cupcakes.  But still, they are very yummy!

five stars for easiness but 2 for taste.   i expect muffins to be fluffy and these were as hard as bricks! once cooked the strawberries lost all color and made the muffins mushy and unappeitzing.  it was also not sweet at all, it just tasted like tough bread.

Very good muffins, and so easy to make. But I will definately be adding more sugar next time, and perhaps some other spices to boost the flavor a bit. They are a bit too bland as is. But still, VERY good! Thanks!

I like these a lot.  They are light, not too sweet and fabulous right out of the oven.  I made 12 instead of 8 and cooked them for 6 or 7 minutes longer than indicated.  I also sprinkled a smidge of granulated sugar on top.  A huge hit!  (And a great way to use up last year's frozen berries!)  ETA:  I used a little more milk that the recipe called for too, adding it until the consistency looked right and the flower was all mixed in.

These turned out wonderfully - just what I was looking for!  I did double the recipe, and after reading all the comments I felt compelled to add only one thing - one teaspoon of vanilla.  I did use frozen strawberries, and I only let them thaw enough to chop easily.  I ended up with 3 cups of berries only because I chopped first, then measured later.  :D  I found them to be quite tasty, very refreshing and not overly sweet.  I'm not sure why others had so many problems, but this recipe was so simple to follow and everything came out perfect.  Thanks for sharing a tasty way to use up last year's crop!

These muffins turned out great!  I did tweek the recipe slightly.  I used almost 2 cups of frozen strawberries.  I microwaved them for 1 minute, and then smashed them with a fork.  I added them at the very end.  The muffins were completely pink, with little chumks of strawberry.  All in all, they were very strawberry-y, and nice and light.

I used this recipe but ended up changing it a lot to attempt a healthier breakfast choice for my picky toddler. I doubled the recipe firstly-then swaped 1/2 cup flour for 1/2 cup flaxseed meal. I added 1/2 cup non-fat vanilla yogart, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamin, and replaced some of the white sugar with honey.

Thses turned out perfectly - very pretty and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, but am transitioning to veganism, so I used Ener-G brand egg replacer and soymilk.  So, other vegans/strict vegetarians out there, don't be afraid to try this one!

This is a good muffin recipe; if you are wanting something real sweet try a cupcake recipe.  I think that store bought strawberries (fresh and frozen) are a lot more tart than home-grown ones.  If using store-bought strawberries I'd toss them in a little extra sugar before adding to  the dry ingredients, or maybe use frozen sliced sweetened strawberries instead.  My children and I liked this recipe as is, but the first words out of my husband's mouth was "It's a little different, needs more sugar."  I added a few slices of chopped peach to this and am eager to try it with only peaches!

Very tasty! I brought these muffins to work and everyone loved them. They taste like strawberry shortcake. I think that next time I will use even more strawberries, though. Also, there is plenty of batter for 12 medium muffins. Simple and delish!

Overall, flavor was good - with some tweaking. Added the vanilla, cinnamon, and brown sugar as everyone recommended. Instead of adding milk, I used 2 dead ripe bananas mashed up and thinned with water to make the required amount (works great as a binder at high altitudes). Dough was a bit dry so I just added a little more water. Muffins came out just right on my sweetness scale!

I LOVE these muffins (with a few changes).  Take out 1/4 cup of flour, add 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1t cinnamon to the dry mixture and add 1t vanilla to the egg mixture.  After all mixed together, I added 2-3T of vanilla yogurt and they are fantastic!!  I liked them better without the strawberry on top.  I could get about 8-10 regular sized muffins out of a batch (if I could stop eating the batter).  SO EASY AND YUMMY!!

A very good muffin recipe - I used fresh strawberries, added 1/4 cup of brown sugar as suggested, and instead of 1 tsp. of vanilla - I used almond extract.  Made a good combination.  I doubled the recipe and attempted to make a dozen mini muffins for the kids, but they were a bit too dry - regular muffins were yummy and as someone else commented - they almosted tasted even better the next day!!??  Thanks for the recipe - I'd try this batter with different fruit too!

I really like this recipe - I did the changes that the other users suggested - added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 cup extra sugar. I didn't cut down on the flour because I only used an 1/8 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce to reduce the fat. It tasted great!

OH MY! I added 1 tsp of vanilla to this, and it is absolutely delicious! This is a great recipe to use up those strawberries you bought on sale.I put a slice of strawberry on the top of the muffins before baking, absolutely gorgeous! This is a keeper! Update: After dinner, we crumbled up the muffins and put them on vanilla ice cream.  This made a great addition!

This recipe is fantastic! I added a couple changes myself by adding a small dollop in the centre, of cream cheese (4oz) & icing sugar (1/4) blended together. They were delicious!! I guess because of the filling, I didn't need to add more sugar to the recipe but did add a bit of vanilla. Thanks!

This recipe needs a little bit of help.  Whoever suggested adding the vanilla, cinnamon, and brown sugar was right.  The flavor was wonderful!!  However, they are a little heavy.  Need to figure out how to make them a little lighter.  Otherwise, not bad but do tweak to your liking.

These muffins are very moist, but they could use a bit more sugar. . .maybe just a personal preference. . .I also liked the idea of putting a small slice on the top to make them look cute. . .I would definitely make them again, they were very easy!

This recipe is delicious, but I must admit I felt the need to add about 25-30% more sugar to it. I think using fresh strawberries works best. The recipe is a little time consuming at first, but once you get familiar with the process it speeds up. I also made these with a vegan egg substitute, and they turned out really well, holding together nicely. I triple the recipe, as it is too much work for just 8 muffins. In addition, they taste too good to make only 8.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The frozen strawberries worked well.  The muffin were a very good texture (crispy on the outdide, soft, light, and fluffy in the inside.)  Everyone in my family loved them.

I took the suggestions from other reviews and if you do that they are PERFECT!  Instead of 1 3/4 c. flour decrease to 1 1/2c. of flour, add 1/4c. brown sugar, and 1/2t. vanilla.  Can substitute any kind of fruit, definitely a keeper!

These turned out great. Even my picky 5-year-old liked them. I used half self-rising flour and half whole wheat (because that's what I had) and added 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also only cooked them 15 minutes, and they were lightly brown and very fluffy - just right.

This is a great recipe. I tweaked it a bit. I added brown sugar to the white. I added a bit of cinnamon. I added vanilla and strawberry extract. Also put extra strawberry’s and had to put a touch more milk. The result was some awesome muffins.

I made these . . . or something inspired by them, in any case. Looking back on what I did while baking, I don't think what I made can really be said to be the same recipe, though it was definitely born out of this one!

(I swapped vegetable oil for (melted) butter, added vanilla and almond extract, more strawberries, brown sugar as well as white, and a few other adjusted quantities. . .)

I read the negative reviews and really don’t understand them. I thought these were delicious, perfect with my morning coffee. Note that they are traditional, old fashioned muffins, not the kind that taste like cupcakes.

I very much dislike canola oil, so I substituted very light olive oil. I used fresh strawberries and would never use frozen. Four stars because tossing the strawberries in the flour mixture made the batter a bit grainy. They baked fine, but I wouldn’t do that next time. If you feel you must have something very sweet, macerate the strawberries in sugar first. These don’t need cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, etc as has been suggested.

I would make this recepie again, but my family and I tried them and they were a bit dry. If I would make these again I would add more milk. If I made them again and added more milk  I think it would be not as dry.

Delicious! Made the same changes as others, but I think the real key is chopping the strawberries small enough so you get some in every bite.

Had to give this simple recipe a try. I had all the ingredients on hand and it’s very easy that a kid can do it. Heck, if I can do it, anyone can! Although many reviewers stated this recipe was bland, I still wanted to give it a shot. I started with the exact measurements of the original recipe, tasted the batter, then added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract that others suggested. I actually added a little drop more after that. I finished it off by adding cinnamon and brown sugar on top.l before baking. Overall, like many of the reviews mentioned, the taste was lacking. It barely tasted like strawberries but the topping was nice and crisp. The muffin itself was just ok for me, it was  not as moist as I’d hope, but as long as It isn’t dry, I’m ok with it. If you warm it up in the morning with some butter then I think you can still enjoy this simple recipe. Thank you for sharing this basic and simple recipe!

Followed several people suggestions and added 1/2 tspn of vanilla, 1/2 tspn of cinnamon, 1/4 cup of brown sugar and extra 1/2 cup of strawberries. Also cut flour by a 1/2 cup. Thank you to the user who suggested the strawberry butter. Delicious! Don’t forget to sprinkle the top with brown and white sugar - it gives it a nice crust on top. I have also found that fresh strawberries work a little better than frozen. With frozen, you have to chop them up with a food processor which creates some “strawberry powder” which in turn turns the batter red. It’s not a bad thing, but I like seeing the chuckle of strawberry. I also make these in small loafs instead of muffins. They are easier to cut and butter!

I made these and substituted the sugar for Splenda, and subbed half the flour with almond flour to make them so my husband could eat them. Oh I also added a tsp of pure vanilla to the batter.

These muffins were very good. I made them for a May Day supper. I didn't change anything and I will definitely make them again, only I will add vanilla, as I do to almost all my baked goods.

I made this recipe following the advice of most reviews–adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. The muffins tasted great! However, I feel like they could still be improved. The two additions I would make next time would be to add confectioner sugar and milk drizzle icing.  I would also add the zest of  1 orange or lemon to the batter to give it a little more punch.

I made these as mini muffins. Same temperature, only for 10 minutes. The result was bite-sized muffins, perfect for my 6 year old. (He immediately scarfed down 5!)

I looked in a lot of places before landing on this recipe. I added half a cup more strawberries, left out 1/4 cup flour, added 1/4 cup brown sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. (No cinnamon.) I was surprised at how moist and simple to put together these were! Will absolutely make again.

I didn’t read the comments before I made this, that being said the muffins are bland. I won’t make them again. Perhaps adding other flavors would help, but I trusted the rating of this recipe so I figured it was a good recipe to try. I don’t know how so many people gave it five stars?? The consistency of the batter was super thick, I double and triple checked to make sure I added the right amount of liquid and dry ingredients. It also made 12 muffins, not 8 like the recipe states.

These were horrible. Did not smell good, did not look good and did not taste good. Stick with traditional fruit muffins, strawberries are just not it. Followed recipe exactly except added vanilla per other reviewers suggestions.

I made blueberry muffins the other day and they turned out very dry and blend. So I decided to make strawberry muffins today and guess what, I read the recipe and noticed that all the ingredients were the same except instead of blueberries there were strawberries. Nah. I’ll pass.

My 4 year old loves these! I like that they are not overly sweet. They come together quickly. Most times I make the recipe exactly as is. Occasionally, I'll add vanilla and sprinkle raw cane sugar on top. These freeze well too!

Can't wait to make these again. These were so tender, light, and flavorful. I too added vanilla and cinnamon in these and I also sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar on top before baking. I made six jumbo muffins and baked them 25 minutes.

Very moist, hubby liked them so it's a keeper. I used applesauce instead of oil, added 1 tsp. Vanilla, also used 2 cups frozen strawberries and I used two eggs instead of one. Also made a simple streusel topping to add to the top. Very good..

This is such an easy recipe that tastes great.I put extra strawberry’s and didn’t bother to mix liquid separate , I just threw it all in together and didn’t over mix. I also used a little less sugar then called for. NOT bland at all, so good I ate 3 of them but I did make them small.

Great recipe! I did take the advice I saw on many of the previous comments: I used 1.5 cups flour, added 1/4 cup brown sugar, increased the white sugar to 3/4 cup, and added 1 tbsp vanilla extract. I also made mine with chocolate chunks (in addition to the strawberries). I used olive oil instead of canola, and they turned out wonderfully! I’ll definitely use this recipe again. Happy baking, friends!

Before making I read the reviews and was a little skeptical about how this recipe would turn out but I tried it anyway!  I did end up adding some extra sugar and some vanilla extract as the reviews suggested. They turned out great in texture and flavor! they could've been a bit sweeter but all in all this recipe is great! P.S. I replaced the milk and canola oil with coconut milk and coconut oil.

They turned out really good. I just added vanilla and orange juice to the milk mixture, and cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry batter. I also put a sugar crumble on top! The crumble has brown sugar, butter, white sugar, cinnamon, and flour(Let sit in the fridge before use so its nice and crumbly!!)

I made mine into bars instead of muffins. I did add vanilla, brown sugar and cinnamon into my batter after reading all of the reviews. I also doubled up on the strawberries. My family loved them, made 24 bars in 10 minutes they were gone!

I had too many strawberries in the fridge so I started looking for strawberry recipes. This one had good reviews, so I tried it. I always follow the suggestions in the reviews, so I added the recommended brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon and reduced the amount of flour as suggested. For my own little twist, I also added about a cup of white chocolate chunks, because what goes better with strawberries than chocolate? I also added a cinnamon brown sugar mixture to the top before I baked them. Finally, I doubled the recipe because I wanted to use my large muffin tin. This turned out perfectly for 12 large muffins. The muffins are incredible! In fact, a picture says a thousand words.

Made according to directions, but did add a little vanilla. I used some extra sweet fresh strawberries grown in some grandma's garden, which most likely make the difference. These muffins came out perfectly. A simple recipe that's very quick to mix up and bake. Impressed.

Quick,easy and tasty recipe to use up some of the 25 pounds of strawberries we picked. I added 1tsp of vanilla and followed the recipe exactly.  Going to make another batch later. Thank you for a great recipe.

These muffins were ok, but just not sweet enough. And the canola oil gives a very different flavor. I wouldn’t make them again.

My grandson asked for strawberry muffins for breakfast, so I made these exactly by the recipe. I think I was expecting something like strawberry bread (similar to banana bread, more a dessert than a breakfast muffin). I do think the other reviewer's  additions would probably help these muffins; otherwise, they are rather plain.

Easy and tasty. Added a little vanilla, cinnamon, and clove to the batter, and sprinkled a little Demerara sugar on top. Even with the added sugar topping, they weren’t cavity-inducingly sweet, which I like. Also used a 6-muffin tin and increased the baking time to 30 minutes, and they came out moist and a little on the dense side.

Next time I’ll probably add even more strawberries, and maybe look into what to change to make them a little fluffier. But just as they were, these are a great way to make sure strawberries actually get used during strawberry season.

I had strawberries about to go bad so I decided to cook something with them. I came across this recipe and decided to make it. I was a little unsure how I would like this because I had never had or heard of strawberry muffins before. However, they turned out very yummy! he only alteration i made was used a cup of buttermilk instead of cow's milk since I was out of cow's milk.

My 2-year-old son and I LOVE strawberries so I am always looking for recipes that I can use year round. We happened to have some fresh strawberries on sale near us but they were pretty bruised (considering that it was February in Wisconsin I was surprised they were on sale at all!) so I wanted to use them in a recipe rather than just eat them. These muffins were incredibly moist and not super sweet so I felt comfortable with my son having them for a snack or for breakfast.

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I  made it with frozen mixed fruit and a little mango.  I also added some ground flax seed.  I made them for the homeless folks here in Punta Gorda and got rave reviews!

Will never make again. The batter was very thick, lumpy, and dry. I had to add 1 more cup of milk to make it the consistency I could actually put in the muffin tin. Plus, it took way more than 25 minutes to cook all the way through.  As I took a bite, it had a very bland taste despite of me adding cinnamon. Will never make ever again!!! Very sad because I made it for a get together and it didn't turn out as I expected.

I followed the recipe exactly, it turned out to be a dough-like consistency. Seems the 1.75 cups of flour was too much. I had to eyeball and all more egg, milk, and oil.

We made this many times the first night!!!  We tested recipe the way it was written... just needed a very little push to be great!!! So we tweaked it, strawberries were used and we added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Then we used blueberries, we added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. Lastly, we doubled the recipe and used blueberries and strawberries in same bowl... so we added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 2 teaspoon cinnamon! We are off for a mini vacation/wedding festivities out of town! We will have great snacking food to share for sure!!! Thanks so much!!!

Overall the muffin was moist but I didn't think the strawberry flavor was strong enough.  Next time I would add more strawberries.

it was a little doughy.  Not sure if it was the foreign oven i was using that wasn't hot enough or it was the batter.  With all the strawberries in the muffin it was hard to tell if it was cooked enough from the outside.

These were alright, but bland.  I even added a 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and vanilla.  The kids liked them though.  Maybe I should try to add 1/2 cup of brown sugar too.

Made them exactly as written, just added tsp of vanilla. They were ok, just a bit too dry. Don't think I will make them again.

I added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla. When I make this again, I will add 1/4 cup of natural brown sugar as many suggested. For those that hated the recipe, I am not sure how they went wrong, but here are some tips that you should keep in mind when baking in general: cut the fruit small, TOSS them in flour before adding the wet ingredients, make sure all ingredients (especially milk, flour and eggs) are room temperature.

This was pretty good, I added some extra sugar and some cinnamon to the 2nd batch as to the first batch didn't seem quit sweet enough for me. Overall pretty good.

I followed the advice of a few others. I added vanilla, added a half cup more strawberries, used half cup sugar and half cup brown sugar and added vanilla and cinnamon. Mine needed to cook longer and not sure if it was because I didn't let my strawberries sit an hour after I chopped them, or if there were just too many strawberries but my muffins are a LITTLE mushy! STILL delish!

I added cinnamon and took out 1/4 cup of flour out bc I read the reviews and I did not like it.  If I had to make it again, I would add more strawberries and take out the cinnamon and add some vanilla extract.

The recipe was really bland... even with vanilla extracts, cinnamons, and additional 1/2 cups of strawberry... the strawberry was barely there...  Had I known better, maybe an additional 1/2 cup of strawberry jam or preserves and a zest of lemon may have boost the flavors a little bit more.

They were a hit with my brother. 

Substituted agave for the sugar and reduced the liquids based on the agave instructions.  Took about five minutes less to bake than suggested.

I love these muffins. But like a lot of people I added a couple other ingredients.  Some cinnamon, and brown sugar and kept everything else the same.  I could tell if I didn't add these two extra items they would have been on the bland side so I recommend adding them in if you want any flavor.  Other than that next time I may not put in the entire amount flour to see if that may help make them even more yummier.

I made this recipe as is so I could see how the original recipe tasted. It was really good! I plan to make it again with a couple of changes...I think it they need to be a tad more sweet and have a little more fruit. This is a really good base recipe though!

I love this recipe! This was incredibly simple and I will definitely be trying it again. After reading through the reviews, the only things I added were extra strawberries (about a 1/2 a cup) and 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon. The muffins turned out very tasty and I got compliments from others!Highly recommend : )

I was skeptical as I was making this tecipe. Instead of batter, it turned out really thick like cookie dough. I didn't read any comments for pointers like usual and wish I had added vanilla and cinnamon. These turned out quite delicious, crunchy and biscuity on top but still tender. I didn't have quite enough strawberries so I added some blueberries.

I did use frozen fruit and chopped it frozen and then let it thaw a bit before adding to this recipe.  I did not have an 8 cup muffin tin so adjusted the recipe to make 12 muffins and ended up with 16 so I would think an 8 cup recipe would make 12 muffins easily.

Before doing anything else, I chopped fresh strawberries (a little less than a whole 16 oz carton), mixed them with honey, and let them chill for at least 45 minutes. Doing this lets a syrup form, which I strained from the berries and added to the wet ingredients along with a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. Instead of the oil, I used butter, which gives it a much richer flavor (and had to add a little more milk). To the dry ingredients, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon. After putting them in the muffin tin and before popping them in the oven, I put almond granola and powered sugar on the top. They only took about 17 minutes to bake, absolutely not 25. They were very, very good with the alterations. Without, they would have been very dry and bland.

Was a thicker batter more dense then airy and a little plain but that was good since my strawberries were very sweet and fresh so it balanced out.  I did add cinnamon and vanilla for my second round of these!  Hope this helps!

I LOVED this. I did omit 1/4 cup flour and did add 1/4 cup brown sugar, cinnamon to taste, and vanilla to taste. I didn't have any canola oil so I had to use EVOO. Couldn't tell the difference. These came out nice, fluffy and moist! I added a little more strawberries probably a half a cup more just to use up all I had. Right before putting them in the oven I sprinkled sugar on top to give them a nice sugar crust. I will for sure keep this recipe and make them again!!!

These came out great! Moist and delicious. As suggested by other viewers, I added the 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp brown sugar and that made a difference. Kids loved them.

I made this as directed and thought they were good. The batter was thick but the strawberries kept the muffins from getting dry. It you like your muffins super sweet, this isn't the recipe for you.

These muffins tasted great! I used applesauce instead of oil and it turned out fine. I also added 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/4  cup of brown sugar based on the other reviews.

Good base recipe, i don't mean to criticize or correct this recipe, but that said this is more of a earthy bread then a muffin recipe. What I recommend is melting a quarter stick of butter, pouring it over it and about 1/4-1/2 cup of confectionary sugar mix with some water until ya get a icing . Then pour butter over it first , then the icing you made. Drench them and then drain the excess. Comes out a lot better and also i recommend more strawberries also instead of just 1 cup, maybe add half a cup more.

Fairly good recipe. I reduced the sugar by half which probably wasn't a good idea. I also used frozen strawberries which made the texture a little mushy, but that's my fault. I added vanilla essence and cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers and I don't think the recipe would have tasted good without those spices. Overall, I'd make it again, this time with the suggested amount of sugar, and fresh strawberries.

I liked these muffins. Based on other reviews about lack of flavor, I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 2 Tbs strawberry jam to the batter, but I think I also cut the sugar in half. I also added a dollop of nutella in the middle of each muffin for a yummy twist, but I think they would have tasted great without it too. No complaints here- these were a big hit!

I've made these several times, I always add brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and cream cheese, my wife fell in love with them! They were also very good before the changes! Kudos to the OP, another good idea is to give them a filling of either strawberry cream cheese or strawberry preserves/jam/jelly :)makes them very good in the mornings!

I added 2 T. strawberry jam as well as an individual strawberry yogurt cup (greek oikos with fruit on bottom). I also added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 t. vanilla flavoring, 1/2 cup more strawberries and a dash of cinnamon from other reviewer suggestions. I filled the muffin tin to the top and the results were very moist, full topped muffins! If the strawberries were fresher the flavor would've been stronger but I will add blueberries or another fruit for a good contrast next time.

I precisely measured all the ingredients for this recipe before cooking. The consistency of the cake was good, however I found the taste to be somewhat bland. So I would suggest to add a little bit more sugar to the recipe to compensate.

I made these for my grand daughters pre-school class. I think they tasted a little dough-y. They also stuck to the cupcake papers . I don't know what happened. I froze them and when thawed the papers came right off. Don't know what happened. I thought they were just OK, but the kids loved them!

I made this recipe without the enhancements. I thought it had a great texture. I thought it was kind of bland though and I couldn't taste  the strawberries. It would definately need some more sugar for one thing.

LOVE LOVE LOVE these!  I 1st tried the recipe over a year ago when we were in a cottage rental & I had some strawberries that were going soft.  I also didn't have a lot of different ingredients on hand.  They were a hit.  We have since made them with blueberries, grated apple (added cinnamon for that one) and various fruit combos.  I just subbed in banana & chocolate chips today- haven't had one yet but they smell & look delish! Thank you!!

a pleasant surprise! I was sure about these when my son asked me to make them, however I just tried one and they are GREAT! I added a teaspoon of freshly ground allspice to mine and they make a great breakfast/coffee muffin! one of my favorites.

I used apple sauce instead of oil and added 1/2 t vanilla extract. I also used about two cups of frozen strawberries which I chopped in my food processor with about 1/4 cup of Penzeys vanilla sugar.  It made 12 muffins. They are very moist and tasty.

The recipe needs more sugar & something, though i'm not sure what that something is. Not very flavorful.

I tried this recipe yesterday. Unfortunately they turned out very dry... they looked great though :-) I guess I should not chop the strawberries up too finely (can't find them in the muffins), and add some more milk and oil. Perhaps the oven temperature was too high (I have to guess the temperature because my oven is ancient). I will certainly try it again with bigger pieces of strawberries and more milk. Thanks anyway for the recipe!

Used Almond Milk and fresh strawberries and the recipe turned out fine. These muffins are delicious.  Will definitely make these again!

I made this with fresh chopped strawberries. They were not sweet enough and needed something either more sugar and some spice like maybe 1/2 tsp Cinnamon. Seemed very dry for muffins so I did add a full cup of milk. Didn't seem to brown much for baking at stated time. Also it made 12 with the added milk.
Recipe needs tweaking so hence the three stars.

As written they are very bland (made them and would give them 3 stars).  To make them better (and healthier) I used applesauce instead of oil, pureed the strawberries, used egg whites instead of whole eggs, used whole wheat flour and also added vanilla.  Also sprinkled sugar on top of each one before baking.  We all loved them.

Delicious!  Took suggestions from others and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon; used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of just white sugar as recipe calls for; added 1 tsp almond extract, 1/2 cup slivered almonds, and threw in 1/2 tsp nutmeg with the cinnamon (when using cinnamon I almost always use nutmeg as well).  Baked in loaf pan for 50 minutes, then drizzled with a glaze made from mixture of powdered sugar and reserve juice from frozen strawberries with a couple drops of almond extract.

These muffins are sooo good! I followed the advice of others, added a 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1tsp vanilla extract, and 1tsp cinnamon. My husband thought they were so good, he went back for more! Definately a keeper!!

I made these after I went strawberry picking and had a lot of strawberries to do something with.  They were a little dry - just okay, nothing special.  I wouldn't bother again, most likely.

These muffins are a big hit whenever I make them.  The key to making them fly off the plate is using really ripe, fresh strawberries.  Your muffins will not be bland!  Like others, I've added cinnamon and vanilla, and also sprinkled a mix of cinnamon and sugar on top to give them a crunchy, sweet finish.  Wonderful muffins.

Wish it made more muffins! I didn't use baking cups per another reviewer. Thanks! 
I made some changes to the great base recipe:
Used a dash of nutmeg and a few dashes of cinnamon to dry ingredients.
Used applesauce instead of using any oil
Added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract to the wet ingredients.
Sprinkled chopped berries with a little sugar while I was prepping everything else.

I had some fruit to use and this recipe did the trick! Because I don't yet own a muffin pan, I just used a 9x9 glass dish, which resulted in muffin "cake". It was equally good, and with some chopped candied pecans, it was a special breakfast treat for a week!

Vegan changes
We did change the recipe a bit but I will still rate it a 5 stars because it came out great. 

We used coconut oil instead of canola.
Almond milk instead of cow milk.
Used 1 1/2 cups of flour versus the 1 3/4 cups. 
1 energ-y "egg" instead of the egg. 
1/2 tsp cinnamon.

I made these for breakfast for the girls this morning. Followed the recipe and added a splash of vanilla extract. We have a ton of fresh picked strawberries and these muffins came out amazing! They aren't overly sweet, kind of like a portable strawberry shortcake. Quick and easy to make as well.

This was a great recipe. And yes, I did add the additional ingredients as the other reviewers. At the time I made this, I didn't have any cupcake papers so I baked it in a cake pan. Discovery! More like a scone and less like a muffin! Anticipating trying this without the strawberries but with almonds. A lovely recipe any way you choose. Hats off to the original chef!

Followed the recipe to a T. Pretty great on their own. The only thing I would change for our taste is a bit more sugar. Other than that, this recipe is great! Thanks for sharing Katie Mae. This recipe will be used many times in my family for sure!

Followed the recipe exactly and found them bland and dry. I remade them with a few additions and they turned out much better. Here's what I did, first I added 1 tbsp fine lime zest, to the berries. Increased the sugar by 1/4 cup and oil and milk by 2 tbsp. each. Later I made a double batch and added 1 extra egg as well. So I think this was an ok base recipe.

Loved it. But I did change it. Swapped the oil for melted butter. Added 1/2 tsp sugar & 1/2 tsp vanilla to the chopped fresh strawberries and let them rest while I got the rest together. Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp of cardamom, 3/4 c mini chic chips & 3/4 c unsweetened flaked coconut.  Batter was thick and sticky. A knockout. Made 12 regular size muffins. Domed nicely.

I made some changes based on other reviews and still thought it was just ok. I reduced flour by 1/4c (used a 75/25 mixture of all-purpose and whole wheat), added 1/2tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon, and added a little extra milk. I used frozen mixed berries which seemed to work fine. Despite decreasing the flour and increasing the amount of milk the batter was still extremely dry and stiff, had to almost double the amount of milk to get everything moist. The recipe only made 10 muffins but that makes sense since I decreased the flour. Overall it was an easy recipe, the texture came out great and the flavor was fine but nothing special. I probably won't make again.

These are excellent muffins.  The texture and flavor is perfect.  I did add one teaspoon of vanilla extract, as I usually do.  I will surely make these again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Katie Mae.

This recipe is good but if you like desert type muffins these most likely won't satisfy your taste buds. I added a good dash of cinnamon and almost a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 cup sugar. I used blueberries instead and a dash of grated lemon peel and only 1/4 tsp of the salt. I had to use a little more milk because the batter was too thick but even after the extra stuff I added for flavor it was still only mildly sweet. This highlight of this recipe is the fruit flavor so if natural fruit sweetness is your thing then you'll like these but if you have a real sweet tooth these will be too bland or mild for you.

2.5 stars, really.  As written, this makes for a bland muffin.  Perhaps a squeeze of lemon juice over the berries would brighten the flavour--or some zest.  Cinnamon would also make a good addition for next time.

These were good and easy to make.  I liked them as the recipe called but next time I might add a crumble to the top to give them a little pizzaaz.

Yum! I used only 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flower. Will use extra strawberries next time. Sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the muffins prior to placing them in the over.

I am trying to help out around house more.   I don't really cook but am trying my hand at it to impress the wife.   I made these muffins.  I added the vanilla abstract and cinnamon as people suggested.   I also sliced and chopped into quartets a whole banana.   Baked as suggested, so good!  I dusted with icing sugar when cool and it was fabulous!  Even the wife was impressed 8).  A must for any beginner in the kitchen.  5 stars, will make again for sure

I tried this recipe today with modifications like many people did.  I really liked the idea of using buttermilk as one baker did, plus I don't use it often and I had some from another recipe this week.  I also used organic palm sugar which turned the muffins brown and I used just a touch of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla, 2 eggs and coconut oil.  The only trick is my coconut oil kept solidifying, but i just warmed it a bit and it worked.  These are very moist muffins without alot of rise and not too sweet.  I did add a little sugar and cinnamon on the top, but that didn't sweeten them significantly, just added a little crunch. The batter was pretty thick and I did need to put in the muffin cups with two spoons.   These will make a great breakfast snack tomorrow as well!

We found them a little bit dry. I would take out a 1/4 cup f flour OR add extra strawberries. Also add 1-2 tsp of vanilla and 1-2 tsp of cinnamon. They are delicious and I would make them again with a few minor changes.

Wonderful recipe.  I added blueberries along with the strawberries and they came out very good.  If you are looking for a sweeter muffin I would add more sugar to the batter, but we liked them just as is.

Maybe I just have a sweet tooth but I'll definitely be adding some more sugar next time. The husband doesn't really like sweet things so he ended up loving these.

I am bit crazy for almond extract, vanilla is just vanilla. The mild almond with the berries makes these more interesting and 1/2 cup of whole wheat swapped for some of the all purpose flour is a simple wholesome addition that did not harm these muffins one bit.

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added 1/2c. strawberries, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/2 t. vanilla and 1/2 t. cinnamon.  I also decreased the flour to 1 1/2 cups.  I added a topping of 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1 T. butter.  We enjoyed these strawberry muffins and will make them again.

Easy and delicious! I did like a lot of others and added:
1/2 tsp vanilla;
1/2 tsp cinnamon;
1/4 cup brown sugar.

These are great when you have strawberries you need to get rid of. It's a quick recipe that, if you already enjoy baking/cooking, you will have all the ingredients in your home (with the addition of strawberries). I got good reviews from family.

I've been on a muffin kick lately. Making blueberry, banana and now these. They were very good. I added some extra strawberries just because I didn't want to leave any in the fridge. Next time I make these I'm going to add a little vanilla because I think they were missing a little something. As they are now, they are very enjoyable.

These are so good we didn't care if we spoiled our appetites by eating them before a meal!  I didn't think that 8 would be enough, 3 adults and 2 children in the house, so I changed quantity to 18 and I am so glad I did.  I am no longer young enough nor strong enough to come out well if there was a fight over them.  LOL

These are delicious!  I love muffins that have a thick batter.  They rise high and are very moist.  I also like that there is not a lot of sugar.  I increased the strawberries because I think you can never have too much fruit.

I just made these today and I too added 1 tsp vanilla, sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking and they are very good. They really aren't as sweet as I thought they would be. I also added more strawberries to really get that flavor. I didn't have a large muffin tin so I made 12 small ones. I will be making these again.

Bought some strawberries from a school fundraiser, needed a recipe to use up my strawberries, followed recipe.  Thought they were very good, but thought they were a bit dry. But like the fact they had small amount of sugar. Would make them again.

I loved them. I carefully followed the recipe, but I ended up having to use more milk. The numbers are a little of, but overall, a simple taste. Spread some butter on top and it's perfect.

These were delish!  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as recommended.  I added extra strawberries and substituted milk with soy milk and they turned out fabulous!

Yummy muffins! I used 1/4 cup of cream and 1/4 cup of milk, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and a bit of brown sugar to the dry ingredients. Definite hit in our house!

I really enjoyed these muffins!!! The only thing I changed is that I added more strawberries, instead of 1cup I put in 2 cups.

This is the first strawberry muffin I have ever baked, I didn't read all the tips about vanilla and cinnamon so I didn't add them but instead of all white flour I substituted 1 cup for whole wheat flour and OMG delicious! They are a huge hit already and they were only baked an hour ago. I will definitely be baking them again and again.

I did not try the recipe as is, I'm sure it would've been ok, but the changes I made based on other reviews make it great! I reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups, used a generous 1/4 cup of each brown and white sugar, added a splash of vanilla and about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Lots of flavour and beautiful texture. I'm sure as written flavour might have been a bit bland, and maybe even a bit dry but with the changes made this recipe is a keeper!

followed the reviews of others and cut the flour by 1/4 cup, added a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon. 25 minutes was too long - they should have come out 2-3 minutes earlier. the end result was okay, but the strawberries gave it a weird flavor - should have sprinkled sugar on them first or something. I'd try a different recipe if I was looking to make strawberry muffins in the future.

The only reason these were not five stars is because a towel in my house caught on fire. It only left a small mark, though. These were really good, especially if you use an electric mixer to mix them. They were really sweet, didn't turn out how the picture looked though, but thats okay! They were such a delight to bake (I'm ten years old and I'm learning alot about baking) I am thinking about selling these along with my lemonade stand that I will have in about a few weeks. Anyways, delicious!

I agree w all others on here that state this recipe is too bland.  I followed it to the T and made no modifications except I added the brown sugar and cinnamon to the tops. That did help but the muffin its self was not sweet enough.  I will try these again with more sugar and see how they go but recipe as is not so good..

Delicious Remake to this recipe called "Not so good for you but sooo good strawberry muffins". I followed the recipe adding the recommendations of 1/2 tsp vanilla, and adding a streusel topping (Recipe for streusel topping: 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup butter, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon) For Moister cupcakes omit 2 of the cupcake tins and add water. These were so moist and delicious, try this remake!

I didn't have strawberries, so I used raspberries....so good!  I also added a touch of Vanilla extract and used half whole wheat flour. Further - I added milk to the finished batter as it was very dense, the result was nice and fluffy muffins!

I made these muffins exactly as written, only using a mini muffin tin. They are sweet and fulfilling. I would chop the strawberries smaller next time so that they would be more evenly distributed in the muffins.

Great recipe with some adjustments!  I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla to wet ingredients, then 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 brown sugar to dry ingredients.  I used a frozen bag of mixed berries - defrosted in microwave for 2 minutes, then mashed.  Yummmm!

So good!  I loved the sweetness of the strawberries and a great way to use fruit that is almost overripe.  I also added bananas to one batch, turned out great.

These muffins are very good.  I chop the strawberries in my food processor, add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, and then sprinkle them with cinnamon and sugar before baking.  It's a great way to use up strawberries that have been in the fridge a while.

I followed the recipe exactly and these are delicious. I used fresh picked strawberries which have a much better flavor that grocery store strawberries. I mixed all the dry ingredients together then all the wet ingredients together, with the strawberries in the wet ingredients. Add the wet to the dry and stir with a spoon just until the batter is mixed and no dry flour remains.  Not over mixing is the secret to good muffins.

Made these today with Fresh Strawberries, and they came out great!
i got 12 smaller ones out of it, and baked for 18-20 mins. I also added a splash of vanilla, and some cinnamon- but thats just because i pretty much add that to any muffin i make :) They tasted great right out of the oven. will be making these again!

This recipe made my muffins turn out real good. The muffins came out to look almost exactly like he ones in the display picture. The recipe was easy to follow and it shows by the result of the muffins at the end. If I would change anything to the recipe, I would add some extra flavor to it like vanilla. But overall, the muffins taste good, and I would definitely recommend this recipe to someone else.

This recipe is very easy to follow. The product we created has a heavenly taste and shape was nice, we like the muffins a lot! And i recommended not to over-mix the ingredients, it would make the muffin get more smooth!

I took the recommendations for adding 1/2t cinnamon, 1/2t vanilla, and 1/4c brown sugar, used fresh strawberries, and these turned out great! The dough was very thick, agreed. But I was still able to get them measured into 11 standard muffin cups. I used Bakers Joy spray instead of using cupcake liners. There was just enough crunch to the outside, and the insides were perfection!

I made these tonight and used all the tips from other reviews (cinnamon, vanilla, brown sugar) and these still came out very bland.  Very disappointed as I was hoping to use these as a gift for a coworker tomorrow.  I won't make again.

Strawberry Muffins Allrecipes.com  Just made it and it came out amazing. I listen to the reviews and made a few changes. I added 1 c. rhubarb sliced, 1/4 c. brown  sugar (lightly packed. You could get away with 1/8 cup), 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp almond essence (opt). I subtracted 1/4 c. of flour. I substituted 1/2 c. of 5% cream  for 1/2 c. of milk and added a tsp of lemon juice to the cream (to make it into rich butter milk. Note that lemon juice to regular milk also makes buttermilk). Take some of the brown sugar and sprinkle on the strawberries and rhubarb. It soaks in a cuts out most of the tart Moist fruity goodness!

These were pretty good. We went strawberry picking and needed something to do with all the strawberries. These were really nice because they aren't all that sweet and can be served with dinner like a roll in muffin form. My boyfriend loved them, and they looked beautiful.

I made these yesterday morning as a "treat" for my breakfast. DELISH!! I had fresh berries on hand from a local farm and they worked perfectly. I added 1/4 cup coconut palm sugar (brown would be fine) and 2 teaspoons of vanilla as suggested by other reviews. My husband had one for an afternoon snack and said they were VERY good. I reheated one for my breakfast this morning and the flavors were even better. This is going in my favorites and will be shared with all my family and friends. I highly recommend this recipe. Thank you.

Want a real rating for this recipe - unchanged?  Here it is.  Blah.  Not bad, blah, just ok blah.  These muffins are just OK as is.  I made another batch added a tablespoon of lemon juice, another 1/2 cup strawberries (to total 1 1/2 cups) and 3/4 tsp cinnamon.  Much better.  I would have rated them a 4.  Then I took the advice of several reviewers and changed the flour to 1 1/4 wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour, changed the canola oil to Greek yogurt, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and changed the sugar to 1/4 cup brown sugar.  The muffins were heavier, denser, drier, and not very tasty.  My kids said the best part of the muffin was the top that I had sprinkled with chunky sugar.  They also stuck to the muffin wrapper.  Not much of an improvement from the original recipe in taste.  Rate those a 3 also.  I think I'll move on to another strawberry muffin recipe that will yield a better tasting muffin.

Excellent recipe!  Wonderful taste and easy to put together.  I had to add a little extra milk, tho--about 1-2 tbsp.  Other than that, I'm extremely pleased that I found this recipe.

While the muffins are tasty, this recipe is not correct for 12 muffins. There is far too much batter, and not near enough cream cheese filling. The muffins overflowed the tin. I had enough batter for probably 18 muffins, however I only had enough cream cheese mixture for 1 teaspoon for 12. I would not bother with them again.

Did most of everyone's reviews - diced the strawberries, added 1/4 c. brown sugar, 3/4 tsp. cinnamon but then added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp of vanilla bean paste. The husband said they were probably the best muffins he's ever had!

Tried this recipe tonight and really liked it. I used half white whole-wheat flour, so mine had a slight biscuit with jam flavor, but they were very good. I would definitely make them again.

I really liked this recipe. I hand chopped my berries so they would not go to mush. I also added in 1/2 cup of mini white chocolate chips and a dash of vanilla extract -they turned out great and my husband ate them all in about two days! I wish the recipe would make a full dozen though.

These were Tasty!I would add a bit more sugar because the taste is a little bland. I threw in some cinnamon and pumpkin spice, nutmeg works too. They came out brown and crunchy (not burned) but thats a reason why i liked them. These are perfect for a simple quick breakfast idea.

We followed the recipe nearly word for word except for adding a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg, and they turned out incredibly bland. The batter was too dry so I added more milk to thin it out and it took at least another 10 minutes in the overn until they were finished. The muffins themselves were stuck to the liners and nearly impossible to eat. There are plenty of other great muffin recipes on All Recipe so this will be the first and last time I use this one.

I am giving the recipe 5 stars, based upon the way I made it. I scaled the recipe up to 24 servings (which actually yielded 32 good sized muffins). I substituted coconut oil for canola oil, used a combination of skim and 2% milk, 5 cups of KA White-Wheat flour (vs 5 1/4 c in the recipe), 1 c of white sugar (vs 1 1/2 c in the recipe). I also added 2 t of vanilla. I made a topping of 1 c brown sugar mixed with 1 T cinnamon and sprinkled about 1 t on top of each muffin. They took 20 minutes to bake and are AMAZING. Better than my previously tried and true strawberry muffin recipe and the only one I'll use from now on!

This recipe was great and I would make them again, but it did require a little tweaking (hence the 4 stars).  It needed a little extra sugar, some vanilla, a sprinkling of cinammon, and a banana to add flavor as some other reviewers recommended.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Loved them!  I followed other suggestions and added a little bit of vanilla to the batter, and a few more strawberries than the recipe calls for.  Then once I filled the muffin tray, I added cinnamon and brown sugar on top.

So, I set this recipe o 12 servings, but it gave me 16 muffins, which wouldn't be bad, however ... there was too much flour (I even added less than what was required of 12 muffins), and, on the recommendations of other reviews, added the brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon. The taste was still blah. I'll try this recipe again, though with less flour, perhaps a bit more sugar and a bit more of the added ingredients.

Absolutely incredible.  Just made these for breakfast for my family and tasted one for myself.  I was concerned when I tried the batter and it wasn't sweet, but the strawberries throughout definitely take care of that. Perfectly golden and crispy on the outside with a light, fluffy interior.  Perfect muffins for a surprise Sunday Breakfast!  I hope they like them as much as I did...if not...more for me!

This recipe was really good, but the frozen straw berries taste a little weird in the muffin. So I think other people trying this recipe should use fresh strawberries. I followed everything in this recipe and- besides the frozen strawberries- it was delicious! Plus I added a little vanilla extract. I recommend this recipe.

I took the advice of several others and added vanilla and cinnamon, but then to make them a little healthier I substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for 1/4 cup oil.  Because of the applesauce, I added 2-3 minutes baking time. They were delicious!

I made these just as the recipe calls for and they came out very dense and gummy.  They're almost inedible.  It's not often that I'm disappointed with such highly rated recipes but this one was definitely a let down.

I needed to use up the leftover strawberries from our garden. I used applesauce for oil and almond milk. I did add some vanilla (1/2 tea spoon) and cinnamon (1/2 tea spoon). They were great!

i used applesauce instead of oil, and whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  i did 1.5 c strawberries, and added .5 t vanilla and .5 t cinnamon. good! it made 12 muffins, baked for 25 mins. perfect. maybe use liners next time: when i took them out of the pan, some of the strawberries were left behind.

Wonderful recipe, the perfect muffin recipe. I included all of the recommended changes which were: cinnamon, vanilla extract and brown sugar - I also added some strawberry extract and a tablespoon of custard powder and they were fantastic! I also frosted them with a pink strawberry frosting because I love frosting! PERFECT recipe and I'm not even a good cook! :D

These were SO easy and tasty! I did add some cinnamon and brown sugar as well as extra strawberries. I crushed half of the strawberries and just chopped the rest and it turned out great- only cooked a pan of 12 muffins for about 18 minutes- they were golden brown and the knife came out clean :)

I used the suggestions to add the extra vanilla, cinnamon, and brown sugar. I also doubled the recipe and used my jumbo muffin tins. They were the perfect balance of sweet and tart. A big hit with the kids I'll be making more spin offs based on this recipe!

These muffins were really good.  I did make some changes.  My son is dairy free so I substituted the milk for almond milk, added some teff for extra protien, lowered the sugar a bit and added a few chocolate chips.  My whole family loved them.

i really like these. i made these as written except i increased it to 16 muffins for 8 people for a sunday breakfast at work. if youre after a sweet dessert type muffin these arent for you. if you want something savory and sweet to have with coffee ( or in our case sausage ) these were just right. super easy. im totally impressed.

These are absolutely evil! I can't stop eating them. I did add vanilla and cinnamon but not brown sugar. I thought it had plenty already. I also had some extra and made a peach strawberry loaf! Awesome and will never make another muffin recipe besides this one :)

A little dry, but i got used to it pretty quick. They were good. I am not sure what I would add to make them a little moister. Easy to follow and the measurements are right on target for 8 muffins.

My husband loves anything with Strawberries and I was glad to find this recipe. We have had the pre-made mixes before and this one by far tops anything semi-homemade. The flavors were perfect and it really helped to the let the strawberries chill after cutting them so that it was easier to mix them in the batter. It also allowed more of the strawberry's natural sweetness come out and meld with the batter.

I will have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers that these muffins are very bland. I followed the recipe as written up until I added the milk mixture to the flour mixture. It was way too thick so I added 1/4 cup of milk to thin it out. Unfortunately, my kids didn't touch these muffins and they love strawberries. They did turn out light and fluffy, though, but it still needs improvement in flavour. I would also add an extra few berries, too. I might try this recipe again, with changes recommended by others.

Was good although I had to follow other advises like additional sugar, cinnamon & less flour. Was moist, light & fluffy. Delicious even though I used frozen strawberries. Will make again.

I had leftover apple cranberry relish from this site and needed to find a way to use it. I searched for a muffin recipe where I could substitute the fruit...WOW!!!! This came out great substituting one cup relish for the cup of strawberries,my husband loved them and he doesn't care for cranberry relish!! In the recipe for the relish add a 3 oz.box of strawberry jello to the sugar to make it the amount of sugar called for.

I made these as the recipe states (doubled) only adding 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I doubled it because I had 2 cups of strawberries.  Yielded 24 regular muffins.  They were very good and cooked well.

Most people who reviewed this and loved these muffins changed the recipe so it would taste good but still gave it 5 stars, which I don't understand. As is, id give this 3 stars. But w/ some changes its a 5 for sure... I added vanilla and an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar as well as some cinnamon like other reviewers. I also used 1 tsp baking powder and 1tsp baking soda in place of the other baking powder because most muffins call for baking soda and I didn't want the muffins to be too cake-like.  Id just only baking soda next time though. With these changes the muffins were good, even better with some butter. Def. something id make again (w/ the changes made) if I had extra strawberries to use.

A big hit at our house.  I added 1/4 brown sugar, and used 1 1/2 cups of flour, and topped them with a dusting of sugar before baking.  Beautiful and yummy! Update: I mashed a banana and added it to the wet ingredients, and used brown sugar instead of of white. I baked them in a tray of mini muffins and 6 reg muffins. Turned out fantastic!

Very sweet and delicious! I read previous reviews and added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar, as well as chopped the strawberries and let them sit for 1 hr before baking.  They did need to bake for 10 min longer, however! I topped them (once cool) with an easy lemon glaze (confectioner's sugar, freshly-squeezed lemon juice, and a bit of grated lemon zest)! Perfect muffins.

These were awesome warm out of the oven, I wish I made more! My family loved them too. They were also very easy to make and I had all of the ingredients already. It was a great way to use up some fresh strawberries.

My kids and I liked these a  lot. They are not meant to be a sweet, dessert-like muffin -- they are more scone-like in flavor and light-and-fluffy (at least mine were).  I guess I always think the strawberries in strawberry muffins end up being a little mushy, so I was expecting that and it didn't bother me.  We all loved these!

These muffins are great! The only changes I made were... I added 1/2 tea each cinnamon & vanilla, as suggested by other reviews. I also used 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt (brown cow) instead of milk. Fantastic!!!

Absolutely delicious and soo easy! I followed recommendations and added some brown sugar and vanilla and they tasted very good. Made 1 dozen muffins that came out of the pan without sticking one bit (did not use paper liners). I used fresh strawberries and they were not too soggy at all. Literally took about five minutes to toss everything together. Thanks for the recipe, will definitly make again!

Alright so I only did one substitution, i substituted the oil for applesauce. I didn't think it would make a big difference (maybe a little more dense) but oh my goodness these were dense as a rock, and dry after 1 day. I know I didn't over mix it.

I made these with an added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and substituted 3/4 cup of whole grain white flour for regular flour. They came out very tasty and I will definately be making these again next time I have an abundance of strawberries.  The only down side to them is that they do not keep well, so I recommend putting them in individual ziplocs and freezing them so you can have them on demand if they won't be gone within the first day or two. Perhaps next time I will even add a streusel topping. Thanks for a great and versatile recipe!

Awesome!  I subbed the 1/2 cup milk with 3/4 cup buttermilk, added some vanilla, and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I also split the flour between whole wheat and white.  The taste of these between the buttermilk and strawberry is incredible.  You could probably sub the oil with sour cream and get a similar result.  THANK YOU!

Hum... I think I should have read the reviews first...  I made them just like the recipe said, and they are good, super fluffy, but a little more sugar wouldn't hurt!!

Nice and easy recipe! I did do what other reviews had suggested and added extra sugar (brown), vanilla and about 1/4 C extra chopped strawberries.  I think that next time I will add a bit of a struessel topping to make even more sweet! My husband loves these split in half and warmed with some butter.  Great recipes, its a keeper for sure!

The muffins turned out really well. I used frozen strawberries that I thawed in the microwave for just about a minute. I did add a little bit of vanilla and butter extract to add some flavor (about 1tsp of eacth). Other than that, these muffins turned out very moist and flavorful. I will definitely make these again.

I think the addition of cinnamon and vanilla extract is pretty essential flavor-wise, and adding a little brown sugar like some of the other commenters mentioned is good too, but otherwise this is a nice, easy recipe and it's pretty healthy.

Never really contemplated using strawberries for baking since I like fresh strawberries so much, however since I had a surplus decided to make these and was so glad I did.  Fresh out of the oven with a pat of butter, these rock.  So good.

Not bad. I added some vanilla like a couple of other commenters suggested, which added a nice extra flavor. However, the strawberries were kind of bitter - this could've just been the batch of strawberries I bought, since I cooked them into muffins to try to salvage the taste - and I really should've eaten them with some butter or something on top, since they were a bit plain despite the vanilla. Still good, though; I would make them again as a good, quick go-to breakfast treat.

These were delicious!  Made them last night for breakfast this morning and they couldn't have come out more perfect.  I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla & 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for extra flavor like someone else had suggested and was very happy with the outcome.  Hope you are too!

YUM!! 4 stars simply because I changed it, like everyone else recommended. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and did half-n-half brown and white sugar instead of adding the brown sugar as extra. I don't like terribly sweet things and these have a delicious flavor without being overpoweringly sweet...although the full amount of white sugar in addition to brown sugar would still be ok I think. I doubled the recipe and came out with 20 muffins. They are moist and delicious! I would love to try using blackberries sometime. Definitely going in my recipe book!

This is a simple recipe that uses ingredients most people will already have on hand. They are not very sweet, which I loved!   I used half AP flour and half Whole Wheat and they came out well!

The are fantastic muffins!  I also added the vanilla, cinnamon and let the strawberries drain after i sliced them (they were fresh and very juicy).  I was glad that i did because the muffins were still a bit 'wet'.  Maybe drain them longer next time....we'll see.  YUM

I am giving these 3 stars because my granddaughter and her friend loved them. I, on the other hand, did not. They were very bland and a little dry. I did add a few extra strawberries but didn't taste them at all. A waste of my time and ingredients. Will not make again.

I did what other reviewers suggested and added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I mostly-defrosted one 10oz bag of frozen organic strawberries and chopped them up.  We were out of milk, so I used evaporated milk (worked just fine). I filled 12 normal muffin cups and 25 minutes baking time.  The results make your house smell wonderful and the muffins are so delicious everyone ate a bunch (my husband had 5?).

Me and my boyfriend loved it so much! I'm going to make it again soon. A simple and good muffin recipe. The muffins are not too sweet, just about right. Don't need to change anything, but did add 1/4 cup more strawberries. It took nearly zero effort to make, strongly recommended!

this was a pretty good muffin but I didn't think it was anything too spectacular.  The recipe definitely made more then 8, I was able to get about 12 out of the batter.  Other then that easy very to make.

These muffins were moist although I added about another 1/2 cup of strawberries, the flavor was rather blah considering I added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  I will add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon next time and a about  a 1/4 cup brown sugar. But all in all they weren't to bad.

Delicious! I love this recipe! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was a little bland, so I added brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and chopped pecans! I also put it into a bread pan- the whole family loved it! Will definately make again!

Just the right amount of sweetness.  I added a tsp of vanilla essence and substituted berry yoghurt for the milk.  However that meand I had to add a little more milk to make the batter drop but the flavour and texture of the baked muffins was excellent.

While these are easy enough to make, I have tried this recipe twice and came away disappointed both times.  The strawberry flavor just doesn't come through as I had hoped.  I did add vanilla and cinnamon as suggested.

Very nice.  I only changed the recipe by adding the vanilla and the cinnamon.

These muffins were amazing! They had just the right amount of sweetness, not too sweet and just the right amount of strawberries! I had nothing but compliments for making them! I will be making these again soon.

I followed everyone's advice and made these changes: 1/3 c extra sugar, 1.5 tsp vanilla plus to grow on, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and an extra 1/2 c strawberries. There was way too much cinnamon for us--even my husband said it confused him to have cinnamon with strawberries instead of apples.

These muffins were delicious. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Also, I baked them for about 20 minutes due to having an old oven.

Sorry, these muffins were pretty bland and just ok. Looking back at some of the reviews (after making them), I noticed that a lot of people who are liking these muffins have added some ingredients and/or changed the recipe in some way. I would highly suggest doing so because these muffins have the potential to be good.

These muffins are just plain awesome.  I did add the vanilla, and haven't tried it without the vanilla, but they were just fantastic.  Will make them again and again and again.

I took everyones advice and added the brown sugar and vanilla. I also made 1.5x the recipe and turned it into a loaf! I loved it! I would definately make this again. The only problem I had, was that I used frozen strawberries and they bled and turned my loaf pink! Next time I will lightly flour the strawberries and add them last :)

Soooo good!  I followed the advice of others and also added 1/2 tspn of vanilla and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also dusted w/ cinnamon and sugar on top before baking.  So good - even the next morning they were moist and delicious.  Loved 'em!!!!

They were pretty good! I made 12 regular muffins, and as others suggested, added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp cinammon and 1/4 cup brown sugar. My husband's only complaint was not enough strawberries! But he's the kind of guy that wants doble fruit in any kind of muffin. I'll definitely make them again!

As others did, I added 1/4 c brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I also sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar before baking.  The recipe made 8 nice size muffins.  They were great and the strawberry flavor was just right.  A great way to use up those last strawberries that are maybe just a bit too mushy to eat plain.

These were excellent, but I did make a few additions per other reviewers' advice: I replaced 1/4 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to dry ingredients, and added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the wet ingredients. Once I put the batter in the muffin cups, I topped each muffin with a mixture of cinnamon, white sugar and brown sugar.  They turned out awesome (they almost taste like a strawberry shake). They have a lovely, sweet strawberry flavor and are not bland at all.

These muffins were fantastic with a lot of tweaks.  Additions:  1/2 teas cinnamon, 1/2 teas vanilla, 2 tablespoons orange juice, 2 drops orange extract.  Substitutions:  used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the oil, used 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup Splenda for the sugar, used 1 cup all purpose flour + 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for the flour.  I also used at least a 1/2 cup extra strawberries.  I've already made two batches of these muffins and will definitely make them again.

These are super easy to whip up and use your extra strawberries for. I love them! I did what other people said and substituted 1/4 C of the Sugar for Brown sugar and added a tsp of vanilla.  I also sprinkled sugar on top before I put them in the oven.  In my oven I had to cook them a little bit longer than suggested.

I have to say these were very bland. I even used freshly picked strawberries and that didn't help it much. I doubt I will make this again unless I have too many strawberries I need to get rid of.

I gave this a 3 because of the alterations I had to make. Mt batter was WAY too thick. I had to add milk until it became the usual consistancy of the muffins I'm used to making out of the box. The cooking time was also off. I only needed about 15 minutes. They would have burned if I kept them in any longer. However they were very tasty! I mixed some blueberries in with the srawberries! I did NOT add vanilla or brown sugar and they were very sweet

yummy .. these are a perfect breakfast muffin. I also added 1/2 cup more strawberries and used white and brown sugar. Definetly add cinnamon and vanilla gives it more flavour. I mixed up a cinnamon and brown sugar topping and they came out beautifully. thank you for this wonderfully fresh recipe.. mohh i used fresh strawberries also tastes fresher.

5/6/12-I made these again this morning (funny almost 2 years apart). I've made them a few times and they are always good. This time I made them according to the recipe and added 1/2t. of Almond Extract. This was the best batch yet. I always use fresh strawberries they just hold up better. My 5 year old loves them and wants them again tomorrow.
 5/4/2009-These are in the oven now and look so yummy. I did use 1 1/2 c of whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and thought they were to dry so added about another 1/2 cup of milk to get to a more normal muffin consitancy. I can't wait.

These came out okay. I made some changes that all seemed to work so thought I'd mention them here.  I added a little vanilla and cinnamon. I left the sugar as is. I got rid of the oil and substituted it with low-fat vanilla yoghurt. I had to add about another 1/4 C of milk but not sure if that was because of the sub or because I used skimmed milk or just because of the recipe, but the dough was elastic and not the normal 'gloopy' muffin batter.   I filled all the muffin cases halfway, added a scant teaspoon of strawberry jam, and then covered them up. Very tasty and low in fat (even if not low in sugar ;) )

very easy, yummy, great way to use up strawberries before they go bad.  Did change a little bit, i added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp of cin. and a 1/4 cup dark brown sugar than sprinkled sugar on top before baking. Additions made batter a little dry so added about a tablespoon of evaporated milk (i was out of milk)the result were the Perfect Breakfast muffin.  Also made the strawberry butter mention by Saved by grace. Went together perfect wouldn't make them without!

We made this this morning because we had a lot of extra strawberries. We followed the recommendation of a reviewer and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar. We also added 2 cups of fresh chopped strawberries! It was extremely easy to make with little mess. They turned out pretty good, a little sugary and it was a little hard to taste the strawberries with all the other ingredients overwhelming it. This recipe is pretty yummy and fast to make (there's only a few left now!) but nothing to go 'wow' about. Good if you're hungry and you want a quick breakfast!

I combined this recipe with the cream cheese filling from Strawberry Cheescake Muffins and they were delicious.  Followed some others' suggestions and added vanilla and cinammon - Delicious!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

These are wonderful! I didn't realize that I didn't have enough flour until about halfway in, so I ended up using 1 1/4 cups white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. They turned out really awesome! I'd use the whole wheat flour again, too! The strawberries melt into the muffins and it tastes like little pockets of strawberry jam inside. Yum!

After reading all the reviews, I was a little apprehensive when making these muffins.  I really wanted these muffins to be delciouse because I was serving them to company this morning with breakfast.  Well, they tasted pretty good, they do have a weird texture around th strawberry's though.  I wish mine turned out a little more attractive.  I would make again, but just for myself, not sure if I would serve again to company.  This is a average tasting muffin to me, hence the three stars....  (I too added 1/2 cup more sugar to the recipe)

I am making this recipe for the first time, & my muffins are in the oven.  I will rate here in a few minutes. I did make some changes:  I used a combination of white and multigrain flour instead of plain APFour.  I also added an envelope of Cinnamom Roll Instant Oatmeal.  Used olive oil instead of Canola oil.  I was going to add vanilla but forgot to.  I only used brown sugar instead of white. And once in the muffin tin I topped with a mixture of raw brown sugar & cinnamon. On a couple of them I threw walnut pieces on top.. Well, here goes they are coming out of the oven, they look delicious, I'm taking a bit.....They are Delicious, Great, and Yummy.  Success.  Next time I will add the vanilla and a bit more brown sugar.  I can't wait to serve these to my 3 precious children for breakfast tomorrow.  A Keeper.

I must have chopped the strawberries too finely since they were lost in the muffins. I'll try them again with at least 1/2 C more strawberries since there wasn't enough strawberry flavor for my tastes. I substituted whole wheat flour for the AP flour and they were tasty. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise (with additions of brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla from other reviews), and somehow I ended up with enough batter to fill 10 muffin slots to the top. Not the perfect recipe quite yet, but it's definitely a nice alternative to the typical muffin varieties.

I made these for my kids breakfast today and they came out great!  I used 2 cups of frozen strawberries, and added 1 tsp vanilla 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup brown sugar and decreased the flour to 1 1/2 cups.  They had great flavor and were very moist.  These will be a regular in our house for now on!

These are quite good!  I cut up a whole container of strawberries to use in this.  I did do the 1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil.  They turned out quite moist and had a good flavor!

I followed other suggestions and added 1 tsp vanilla, a dash (or 3) of Cinnamon and a dash of ginger. I also added 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and about 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used closer to 2 cups of fresh sliced strawberries and mixed it all in my stand mixer.  Took me about 5 minutes tops to make these and get them in the oven- so easy!  They are in the oven- I'll add how they taste in a bit! update: they came out a little underdone, didn't puff up like muffins usually do.  They were flavorful and sweet, but my bf wasn't crazy for them.... Will have to make again....  Update #2:  Made these again, followed the recipe exactly except I added about 1/2 white sugar extra and an extra handful of sliced strawberries.....  They definitely came out a bit bland and not too sweet.  Not sure if I will venture to make these again, I might just search out a new recipe instead.  Sorry!

Definitely a winning recipe! I have made this twice now, using frozen strawberries, and you would never know I used frozen ones. We took these to a dinner and everyone loved them. If using frozen strawberries, cut them while they are still frozen (to make cutting easier) but leave them to thaw about 15-20 minutes longer. This will prevent your cook time, or finished muffin consistency from being affected. I also sprinkled with white sugar half way through the bake time. TIP: Do not use liners. Just lightly grease your pan.

Very delicious and moist muffins! They were on the light side as far as sweetness goes, but I like them that way, so it worked out! Would definitely add more sugar for those who like them sweeter if eating the muffins alone. I ate mine with some french vanilla yogurt, and it was so yummy! They were my first muffins and were very easy to make.

Big hit in my family.  I did add the 1 tsp. of vanill and an extra 1/4 cup of sugar as other people had done.  I think if you serve with jelly you don't need to add any extra sugar.  I'm actually going to make them again for breakfast tomorrow.  We LOVED them.

The only substitute I made was olive oil for the canola oil, just because I didnt have any handy. I used frozen strawberries and the trick is to let them fully defrost before adding them to the batter. These muffins are surprising moist but they don't keep long so eat 'em quick!

They had OK flavour but they were dry, flat and sticky on the tops. I dont understand why people are rating some recipes so high when they arent that great, it is misleading to people looking for a good recipe.

There were tasty, I didn't have only strawberries in the freezer, so I used a "mixed field berry" blend.  They were good.  The younger boys didn't care for them too much, but the teens loved them.

I am from New England and we don't tend to see or make strawberry muffins.  These were super tasty.  I used corn oil because that is what I had.  They came out great.

First of all, I doubled the recipe for these muffins.  I also took member reviews and added 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, another cup of strawberries, a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also completely replaced the oil with plain nonfat yogurt which, I felt, did not compromise anything.  With these adjustments the flavour was pretty good.  I really enjoyed the flavour of these muffins but the texture left something to be desired.  Although the texture wasn't necessarily "bad," I disliked how sticky they were when I handled them while eating.  I will probably add some oats on the top the next time I bake these and I will also probably add a little bit more flour if I increase the strawberries again. Needless to say, I will be baking these again, but with the adjustments listed above (I want to experiment with whole wheat flour as well!). All in all, a pretty good muffin recipe to build off of, and really easy to make super nutritious!

I'm not sure what I did wrong with this one; I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract for extra flavor because other reviewers said the batter was a little bland, but the muffin was not very good.  They browned a LOT, but I cooked them as per the instructions.  The strawberries were also mushy and gave the muffins a strange texture.  I wasn't very happy with them, so it looks like I have to keep searching for that perfect strawberry muffin recipe.

I changed the recipe slightly since I like to soak my flour 12-24 hours before I make anything.  I substituted water with a little lemon for the milk, added strawberries, and mixed it together the night before. Then in the morning I added all but the baking powder(I used baking soda) with a tsp vanilla.  I added the baking soda last and it poofed so nice. The muffins were so light and fluffy and good.

I made "muffins" (actually made bread in a loaf pan, took 40 min) using the suggestions by everyone else. I added 1/2 teas. each of vanilla and cinnamon, an additional 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 teas. nutmeg. With the additions it was pretty good, but I don't think I'd make it again. It wasn't fantastic and it didn't get finished. I didn't like the texture of the cooked strawberries; maybe if I mashed them more and it was more evenly distributed that would have been better. In all, I'd rather make strawberry shortcake with fresh strawberries :-)

As per the suggestions of other reviewers, I added vanilla, cinnamon, and brown sugar, used an extra 1/2 cup of berries, and decreased the flour by 1/4 cup. I also subbed in 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. For aesthetics, I added half a strawberry on top of each one. They look great, taste great, and smell wonderful! They were a little tricky to get out of the muffin tin, but that may be my fault for not greasing it enough. I'd like to try it again using paper liners or silicone muffin cups. My batter yielded 12 medium muffins and baked 25 minutes in a convection oven.

These muffins are good, but I do not care for the consistency of the cooked strawberries when it is done.  I did add the extra brown sugar and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, but I did not reduce the flower because I knew when the fresh strawberries cooked they would release a lot of water.  I also used all ww flour and added 2 tbls of gluten. The mixture was more like a biscuit dough hen placing into the pan but came out perfectly.

Yum.  Made them with 1/4C less flour and also added the 1/2t vanilla and a few T of seedless raspberry jam.  So yummy.

These were good, but I wish that I had read the reviews first.  I had added pure vanilla extract, butter and strawberry flavorings on my own, but I think that the addition of cinnamon would have been wonderful.  Very light, moist muffin.  My children love them, so that makes them a keeper in this house.  I think I will light roll the top in cinnamon sugar to give it that extra kick of flavor.  Make sure that you add some vanilla or flavoring of your choice to really make these great!

I took some advice from other reviewers, added cinnamon, vanilla, cut back on flour, used half white sugar/half brown sugar, and used more strawberries than called for. Still, I found these fairly bland, with a weird texture. The only mouthfuls I enjoyed were ones consisting of mostly strawberries. Too bad, I was excited to make these.

These were ok.  They were bland.  I used frozen strawberries, so maybe fresh ones would be more flavorful...  I did throw in a few blueberries.  As others had stated, they do not brown.  I got 10 muffins instead of 8 too.

This was a quick and easy recipe. Added some brown sugar and cinnamon per the recommendations in the other reviews. Made them for a March of Dimes bake sale. They were all gone in a few hours.

This recipe did not work for me.  While somewhat tasty, the muffins had a rubbery texture, and the muffins stuck to the baking cups.  Like some other reviewers, I noted the muffins did not rise very much.  Also, the tops of the muffins did not brown or turn golden, making it hard to tell if they were actually  done (I kept them in the oven for the recommended number of minutes per the recipe.)  I substituted some brown sugar for the white, and added the vanilla and cinnamon as others suggested.  I used fresh strawberries, which I pureed before adding.  I thought the flavor of the strawberries came through, but overall, the recipe was not successful for me.

Even though I took others suggustions and added cinammon and vanilla and 1/2 cup more strawberries, the flavor of the muffin was still kind of bland and flourey. I LOVED the baked strawberries though so I want to try this recipe again. Next time I will try another suggestion and puree strawberry into the batter before baking, and use 1/2 brown sugar in place of the white to see if I can fix the muffin flavor. Wish me luck! :)

I thought these were very good and my picky son LOVED them.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, and next time I will replace the oil with applesauce.  I doubled the recipe and added about a 1/4 cup brown sugar as well as about 1 1/2tsp vanilla.  These were sweet, but not overly sweet and a great way to use up the giant container of strawberries I had in my fridge!

I made these muffins on a lazy summer day. They were delicious! Surprisingly they weren't as sweet as I thought they would be, but the strawberries were an addition as good as sugar. They disappeared the day I made them!

Awesome!  Of course I'm partial to anything strawberry.  I took the advice of other reviews and added 1 teas. vanilla and 1/2 teas. cinnamon.  I also made the strawberry butter mentioned in the reviews to go on the muffins.  I loved it!  I'm always looking for new ways to use up the strawberries from my garden and I will definately keep this recipe in mix for th future.

It smelled and tasted pretty good, but the overall texture of the muffins were kinda mushy from the strawberries. Do add the vanilla & cinnamon as recommended by other reviewers.

good muffin recipe, although i took some advice from other reviewers and subtracted 1/4 c. flour, added 1/4 c. sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla and some cinnamon.  they were perfect and fluffy. i'm still not sure how i feel about strawberries in muffins though so next time i might try it with blueberries or peaches instead.

nothing special about this. 

it was easy to make. i added in more strawberries and added some strawberry conserve.

it tastes nice fresh out of the oven. the crust is sweet and slightly crunchy.

it didn't leave me wanting more.

While these taste quite nice the recipe took much longer to cook then stated. This might be because I only used paper cups and no muffin tin though, (I unfortunetly do not own a muffin tin) they also turned out rather flat because I used paper cups.

these muffins are super easy to make. i used brown sugar instead of white and  i added some cinnamon and vanilla but the muffins still lacked some pizzaz. but  very good, they taste healthy and are perfect for a snack or as a light breakfast pastry.

This was a really easy and delicious recipe and I will definitely add it to my collection.  I used a 12-muffin pan and med-sized muffin cups and found that they were perfectly done in only 12 minutes.  I used 3/4 c sugar like someone suggested and they were nice and mildly sweet.  I also sugared the strawberries ahead of time and let them create their own juices for more flavor and that worked out really well.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on top at the end for presentation.  I didn't get super rave reviews from everyone that tried them, yet everyone took more.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Definitely needed more milk, or perhaps slightly less flour. They are very, very heavy muffins. You will only need to eat one to fill up. I added 1 tsp. each of vanilla, almond extract, and butter extract to enhance the flavor and it really helped. Otherwise the overall flavor would have been too subtle for me--I guess I just like to be hit over the head with the taste! I added brown sugar to the top for a crunchy topping. I thought these were really quite good, and my dh remarked that they looked like they came from a bakery.

I made these for Sunday breakfast with frozen strawberries and they turned out great.  I made strawberry butter to serve with them and that just intensified the great strawberry flavor.  I can't imagine what problems one could have with this recipe unless they just don't really like strawberries or maybe aren't familiar with the correct way to make muffins.  They were great and thanks for sharing this recipe as it's going into my permanant file.

Followed recipe directly, with only one changed.  Added about 2 Tablespoon of sugar.  The result is delicious, not too sweet and real strawberry taste with every bite.

I just loved them and so did my 3 year old. After reading the reviews, I decided to heat up some sugar,water, and corn starch along with the strawberries, to make them sweeter. Then I added this mixture to the batter and blended it in.
I was able to make 9 large cupcakes and they were soooo good.
I will definitely make these again!

I followed the recipe on these but they just weren't very sweet.  I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh so that could have been where I messed them up.

Wow I switched the Strawberries to Blueberries (I ran out of Strawberries) and the recipe turned out excellent. They're the best muffins I've had in a while.

I was a little scared because I ran out of paper cups but they came out nicely from the tray.

I would've gave this a five but my dough was too dry and I ended up adding an extra TBSP or two of  milk.

This is a wonderful, basic recipe.  If you're going to change everything and it doesn't turn out great you can't really rate THIS recipe.  If you replace all of the A.P. flour with whole wheat, it will turn out heavy and flat.  My only suggestion is to top this muffin with course sugar for that crunchy top.

I liked this recipe for its simplicity- and I had all the ingredients in my cupboard. I added canned blueberies (1/3 C)- as my original intention was to make blueberry muffins, and I doubled the recipe, which actually came out to 24 regular size muffins. They tasted great- not too sweet...just right for a morning treat!

Just not at all my thing.  My family liked them a little.  I added brown sugar, vanilla, and dash of mace.  I also used fresh firm berries so they would not get mushy.

Sorry these didn't work for me. I agree with others that fresh fruit seems to work better than frozen, which is what I used. Frozen strawberries just didn't do it for this recipe. I used whole wheat flour, which have created a problem, too. They came out quite flat, too, they didn't rise even with the baking powder. Anyway, it was a nice try & I had fun trying it out, so thanks anyway!

Really yummy! I had some leftover strawberries from strawberry shortcake that were about to go bad.  They were really soft and I didn't want to throw them away so I added them to this recipe. Like others, I added the vanilla, cinammon, and brown sugar.  I also added some of the strawberry juice.  I don't have a muffin tin, but baked it in an 8"x8" Pyrex dish.  Needed to add about 5 minutes to the baking time.  Really good... like a strawberry breakfast cake.  Will definitely remember this again for any berries that may be too soft to eat.

Great recipe. I made a double batch and added rhubarb for a fun twist -- as well as the vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by others. Also topped with shaved coconut/brown sugar. Very moist and tasty. Made a great addition to my breakfast menu.

It was VERY good. I'd give it more stars but I changed added so much, I'm not sure that's how the original would have tasted.  As suggested: I added 1 tsp. vanilla, a mashed banana (less on the oil), some quick cook oatmeal and more strawberries. It turned out great! But the muffin seemed to have a hard time holding itself together with all the excess strawberries. Anyways, a great basic starter recipe. Thanks!

I thought these were really good.  

I followed some of the suggestions:

added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup brown sugar, vanilla.  I didn't add the vanilla yogurt as that would have made it complete soup.  I found that I needed the flour others were taking away.  I used 2% milk.  My strawberries were from the garden so somewhat mushy, maybe that is why.  If you just add a few chopped berries to the flour at a time and toss as you add I think it helps.

The cooking time slightly overcooked my muffins that were in a muffin sprayed with pan.  I had doubled the recipe and I tried some in foil liners  - and the recipe time was perfect for those.

Thanks for the recipe.  I have never made strawberry muffins before this.  Many other kinds, but not strawberry!

This was a pretty good recipe. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/4 cup brown sugar like the other reviews recommended. Yummy, but not fantastic. They were good when they were fresh and warm. But I went to eat the last one 5 days after I made the batch, and the strawberry I placed on top was starting to mold, gross! (I did store them in a tight container.) So either avoid the strawberry on top, or eat them within the first couple of days.

I quite enjoyed this recipe - I doubled it and made a big batch of bread out of it.  I added the vanilla and brown sugar as recommended, but I wish I had cut back on the flour as well, since the final product was a little too dense.

I doubled this recipe, and used frozen berries.  I found this recipe to be ok.  At first, I found these muffins to be kind of bland but I liked that they were not too sweet.  The next day, however, they were much better.  I will keep this recipe as a "maybe" but will continue to look for a new recipe.  It's not a bad way to use up those strawberries though!  Thanks Katie Mae!

I made these tonight and with a few changes they turned out great!  I did add brown sugar in addition to the white sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.  The taste was so great.  I am very pleased.  I think this may be good with some nuts added also.

I chose this recipe because it specifically said it was okay to use frozen strawberries. They turned out okay. Next time I'll use fresh berries and see if they're much better.

A terrific recipe with a few changes...I added 1/4 extra brown sugar and a tsp. vanilla as suggested as well as a dollop of homeade strawberry freezer jam in the middle (made it very moist and added flavor).  I also followed advice and placed a slice of strawberry on the top before baking.  When ready to bake sprinkle with cinnamon sugar!  Lovely to look at and delicious.  My kids claimed it was the best of muffins and we make alot of varieties.

Loved this recipe! I substituted buttermilk for the milk, and added Cinnamon and Nutmeg. You have to add a bit of milk too, to adjust the consistancy. I used fresh berries, and added chopped dried apricots as well. This recipe will go down as one of my favorites! I plan on trying it with other fruit as well.

I loved these muffins.  They are so good warmed up with a little butter on them. Yummmmm.

I followed suggestions and added cinnamon and vanilla and substituted 1/4 C. brown sugar.  They are perfect if you use peaches instead of strawberries!

After taking the other suggestions given on the review section, I still found the recipe bland and doughy. I will not be making this recipe EVER again.

These are like muffins with "embedded" strawberry jam. Very easy to make and tasty as well.

A hit with everyone in my family!  I added demerra sugar on the top of the muffins before I put them into the oven...a nice touch that someone else suggested I think.  Freeze well also!

When I mixed all the ingredients together, it seems a little too stiff, so I added 2 mashed bananas. They're good, but a little bland. So easy though, I will make them again.

to just give it a bit more taste, I add a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Tastes great!  My 
co-workers couldn't get enough:)
