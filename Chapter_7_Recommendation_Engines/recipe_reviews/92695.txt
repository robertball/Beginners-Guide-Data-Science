These tasted great, I sent half of the bars with my husband on his way to work & his co-workers loved it. It just isn't quite what I was looking for, but I would definately make it again.

I made this with a bunch of kids at work and it was pretty easy. The kids and staff thought it was great. We left out the coconut because none of the kids seemed to want it and of course it turned out fine.
