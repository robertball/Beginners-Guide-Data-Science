This recipes just confirms that we only like refried beans when they don't dominate the taste of a dish. For those who love refried beans, they may love this recipe, however, my family didn't care for this much. I'm giving this 3 stars only because our dislike for this recipe may not be the recipe's fault...it just didn't match our tastes. Thanks anyways.
