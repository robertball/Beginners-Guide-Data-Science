This was SO GOOD!! Absolutely the best stir fry recipe I have tried yet.  The only changes I made were the addition of peas (next time will probably add broccoli, snow peas, etc.) and i didn't have cashews so i toasted some almond slivers and sesame seeds and i think they were a fine substitution. i added a litle more ginger than called for.  I thought the blend of flavors in the sauce was just outstanding and everyone said it smelled and tasted fabulously. very good recipe, only change i would make would be the addition of more vegetables.

I thought this recipe was really tasty.  I did alter it slightly...I used 2 TBLS instead of 2 tsp of oil. Using the first TBLS of oil, I cooked the celery and carrots and added 1 head of chopped broccoli, 1/2 red and 1/2 green bell pepper chopped, 1/2 cup frozen snow pea pods and 1/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms. After stir frying them, I added the chicken (and added an extra 1/2 lb more than what the recipe calls for). In addition, I doubled the "sauce."  The result was delicious.  Although kids who are picky with their veggies may not enjoy it as much, this recipe is one that you can cater to what you enjoy.  My five year old loves it and got a kick out of eating the cashew topping. I was hoping that the sauce would be sweeter in taste and next time I might add a tsp of orange zest or something but overall, it was really good and sooo easy to make.  I will be making this more often. What a tasty way to eat your veggies!!

The flavor on this was outstanding. The orange was just right and the sesame oil was a very good "secret" ingredient. I agree though with the other reviews on the sweetness or hotness - it needed a little more of one or the other. I added a little more sweetness in the form of mirin and that worked great. I might try hot pepper sauce the next time for hotness! Also per other reviews I doubled the sauce and added extra veggies. I'm glad I did because I don't think there would've been enough for our family of 6. I added zucchini, pea pods, bean sprouts, garlic and even spinach. The only thing I would suggest is to cook the chicken first for two reasons, one is for sanitary reasons. I didn't like that I was putting raw chicken on my veggies. The other reason was that the veggies got too soggy after being in there so long. I prefer them a little crunchier and so does my husband. All in all a great dish.

this is a very simple and quick dish. i used a bag of frozen "stir fry" veggies, added in red pepper flakes for a kick, and had peanuts in the pantry so i used them instead of cashews. i'd suggest adding in the sauce before the chicken is entirely cooked, to avoid bland chicken. this recipe is very versatile -- you can add any veggies, meats, nuts you want. the sauce was good -- the whole dish reminded me of something you'd get in a restaurant.

I loved this recipe. Who knew healthy food could taste so good. I left out the celery and didn't add nuts because my husband does not like them in stir fry and I added about a tablespoon and a half to make it a little sweeter. I also added a little garlic and salt and pepper to taste which is not mentioned in the recipe. This will be how I make stir fry from now on. Oh, and I also used olive oil and it turned out just great. I might try sunflower seed oil next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

Not a big hit at our house.  All we really tasted was the orange juice and we won't make it again.

My son absolutey loved this and I thought it was really good, but hubby just thought it was okay.  I think it is a fresh and light flavored stir fry.

Made this for my husband and friends. My first attempt at a stir-fry, and they couldn't get enough! No leftovers to speak of. Made exactly as listed and served on top of jasmine rice.

This was a good start, but I don't think it called for enough veggies.  So I added broccoli, green bell pepper, snow peas, a red onion, 1 extra carrot and some baby corn.  I also added two garlic cloves and a little bit of toasted sesame oil.  I left out the celery.  Since I added so many veggies, I increased the OJ to 1 cup and added a bit of extra honey and soy sauce.  I started cooking the chicken first because I prefer my veggies still kind of crispy.  The chicken was perfectly tender and the veggies were great too.  The sauce was good, not too orangey.  Served over brown rice.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I had leftover white rice and needed something that I could just throw together. My husband thought I'd slaved over dinner!  It was a great, healthy dinner! Thanks.

Added broccoli and garlic to the stir fry.  Served over brown rice and spinach leaves.  Nice light citrus flavor when you are tired of the heavy salty/soy sauced ones.

Too much orange juice.  Otherwise delicious. Great alternative to our normal fare!  
Added muchrooms and will likely add peppers and broccoli next time as well.
In addition, after reading other reviews, I also browned the chicken serperately and then added later.

Never before, and I do mean never, have I felt compelled to write an Internet review of anything, let alone a shared recipe. However, I prepared this dish for the first time, strictly according to specifications, and I have to tell the world:  it is fantastic. The sauce is savory without being too sweet or too sticky and the cashews and green onions tossed in at the end add lovely crunch and flavour too. While it lends itself to endless possibilities, substitutions, and embellishments (as other cooks have suggested) this one is awesome straight out of the gate; it certainly received praise in my home.

This was fantastic!  I made a few alterations  - Here's what I did: Instead of OJ :  OJ/Pineapple juice blend - not as bitter and definitely did not overpower the ginger. Instead of Honey: I used Maple Syrup. Instead of Cashews: I used honey roasted peanuts.  I topped each dish with the peanuts  I doubled the amount of ginger. I added Pepper to taste for some extra zing. For the veggies I used: Grn Peppers, Carrots, Yellow Onions.

If I could give this more stars I would - it was wonderful.  Minor changes:  I added some snow peas, broccoli, red & yellow peppers, and a small can of drained pineapple tidbits - then served over sushi rice.

I didn't have any fresh OR powdered ginger for that matter, but it is still very good, but I can tell that it would be better with some ginger. I crushed up some unsalted peanuts and threw them in place of cashews.

I thought it tasted okay. I followed the recipe exactly as well and thought the orange juice was too much. But if I were to make this a second time which I may in the future, I think I'll add the sauce in along with the chicken so the chicken has more flavor to it like some others have suggested.

The Love of my life, Stewy and I enjoyed this recipe this evening. It was very soothing and fresh. It was also very easy to make. I am going to share this recipe with my friends. It's not often that I share recipes so this must be an excellent dish. Until my next review...
Ciao for now

This is a keeper. Didn't have ginger root or peanut oil so I substituted canola oil and 2 tsp ground ginger. Also drained and added a small can of sliced mushrooms. It was great served over rice!

This was freaking YUM. Mine turned out a little salty, only because I used peanuts instead of cashews because that was what I had. (Didn't look at the canister, apparently they were salty peanuts.) Didn't matter. Everyone but the little inhaled it. Next time, I might add a little more honey, maybe some orange zest. Thanks for the recommend, Caitlin. This one's a keeper. NOTE: I served this with Fried Rice Restaurant Style.

This is a perfect stir-fry. I make it all the time but I usually use carrots, zucchini, mushrooms and onions.  Don't forget to put the cashews on top or you'll miss the delicious cruch.

there wasn't really anything bad about this recipe, it just lacked some kind of flavor. it seemed fairly bland. if you can use this as a basic recipe and add some flavor to it, it would be better.

I cooked this tonight for my husband and myself. He doesnt like onions or nuts, so I just put those on my portion. It was very good. It does have a strong citrus flavor. But I liked that. I also added broccoli and snow peas.

I was skeptical about this recipe being too sweet, so I cut the honey by 1/3 and added 2T of lemon juice. I doubled the sauce and used bok choy,broccoli, snow peas and onion slices along with the celery, carrots, and chicken.Didn't have any cashews, but we didn't miss them. The vegetables supplied the necessary crunch. This will be a keeper, Robyn, thanks.

I made this the other night and thought it was very good.  I did not use all the o.j. when doubling the sauce like I always do.  I used 1/2 cup chicken stock and 1 cup o.j.   I was afraid it would have too much of an orange flavor as per one reviewer.  I did add a little more honey and soy sauce, but that was my preference after tasting. It could have been because I used less orange juice, which would have made it sweeter.  I didn't have cashews, so I used peanuts.  I thought it was really good.

My husband loved this, but isn't the slight bit picky.  It was lacking something in my opinion. Needed to be more sweet, salty, or spicy.  Tasted like orange juice mainly to me.  Next time i will add more soy and honey and less oj.

Great recipe!!  Even my kids ate it, and right now they won't eat anything.  The only changes we made was doubling the recipe for the sauce to allow for the addition of more veggies (mushrooms, baby corn, broccoli and water chestnuts).  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I followed the directions pretty much exactly, but the sauce just tasted like orange juice. Way too sweet. I added a couple of teaspoons of chili garlic sauce and about another tablespoon of soy sauce at the end just to balance out the flavors. It was good then and very easy to make.

Tasted amazing, to those of you who think the flavor was kind of bland or plain...when you add the sauce to the chicken and vegetables make sure you put the heat to low-medium as this will let the juices soak into the chicken more, and after that just make sure you don't let the sauce boil for too long or it'll quickly evaporate out.

I'd been looking for a stir fry honey chicken recipe so I could continue to have the dish I so loved from a restaurant in NYC.  I replaced in this recipe what was different, for veggies green and red peppers and onions, for nuts walnuts and it was almost identicle and made me homesick for when I lived in NYC.  Very healthy and deliscious.  Give it a try.

This is a good recipe although it needs a few alterations to fit our taste:  A little more honey and less orange juice, less mushrooms and the addition of water chestnuts.  I also added some broccoli.

My husband and I both love this recipe.  It's probably one of the best stirfry recipes  I've ever tried.  Works like a charm every time and is great with different variations, like broccoli or peas.

The kids and I thought this was wonderful.  The flavors went very well together.  I only gave it 4 stars because my husband didn't like it.  He thought it was not authentic enough after being spoiled with real asian food on a recent business trip.  The rest of us enjoyed it though.

My wife is pregnant and has a bit of a hard time with many meals but we found this to be very easy to prepare and quite tasty.  We did agree though that the sauce needs a little more kick.  Adding something to sweeten it or give it some heat would give the initial orange flavor a more lasting and pleasing effect.

A nice, easy tangy dish. Served over basmati, it was delicious. Living in Tokyo, I have to make do with what ingredients I can find here. I made a lot of changes to this recipe and it still turned out fine. Instead of celery, I used 1/2 cup mushrooms, 2 carrots, 2 small eggplants and 1/2 cup snowpeas. I used 2 TABLEspoons of olive oil instead of peanut oil. I doubled the sauce amount since I love sauce. I used regular soya sauce, not light. A bit of spice would be a nice addition, though the sauce is kid-friendly without the extra zip. We didn't have cashew nuts or green onions on hand so we used sesame seeds on top to add some nutrition. Nice and easy.

A lot of bang for the buck! This easy, quick recipe makes a delicious main dish. I brought it to our book club when we were discussing "Tara Road", (my idea of what Marilyn was trying to make when she burned the pots!) and it received great reviews! It reheats well.

I used to make something similar to this years ago from a recipe I got from an advertisement in a magazine.  That recipe has since been lost...until I found this one here!  I believe it is close (if not exactly the same) to my lost recipe.  To make it a bit healthier I cut the chicken down to 1 pound and added a chopped red bell pepper and snow peas.  Those were lovely additions and worked well.  I also used regular soy sauce instead of low sodium, and the result was not too salty at all for my tastes.  Lastly I swapped peanuts for the cashews (cheaper).  At first I thought the sauce was too thin, but it thickened up quite a bit for the leftovers so I'll keep the sauce the same next time.  I generally don't like things too sweet, so I was light handed with the honey measurements but it's not overly sweet at all.  I think a touch of heat would be a nice complement to the sweetness, perhaps a chile or red pepper flakes.  Served on nutty, brown rice which was wonderful with this.  The trick to recipes such as this is how well you cook the veggies.  If they're crunchy they are not done yet, if they're soft you took it too far, just needs to be firm.  This was as good as I remember!  So happy to have my long-lost recipe back!

I have made this recipe twice and really liked it both times.  I actually like the strong orange flavor.  I cooked the chicken first and then added the vegetables.  I also added one clove of garlic and used ground ginger since I didn't have any fresh ginger.  Served it over jasmine rice.  Will definitely make this again.

I've never made anything like this but it seemed quick and simple so I tried it. I followed the recipe as close as I could making only 2 adjustments:

I had no peanut oil so I used olive oil.

I had no lite soy sauce so I used regular.

I generally try to follow a given recipe exactly the first time but I had to make the above 2 changes.

I also made the sauce separately first, thickened and all, to make sure I would like it. I did.

This was GREAT!!! Really, really good, and the kids liked it as well. I will make it again for sure and maybe ad some heat and make a bit more sauce than indicated.

Made this for supper last night and had to substitute ground ginger for the fresh.  It had excellent flavor, a little onion-y.  Could not BELIEVE it was six servings!  I could have eaten half of it easily.

This is a great recipe - a rare stir fry recipe that doesn't taste like some variation on teriyaki. What mades it better is marinating the chicken in the sauce for a few hours before cooking, then removing the chicken from the marinade and browning as per the recipes instructions.

This recipe was okay. It had a nice orange and ginger flavor to the sauce, but it was lacking something. Next time I will add minced garlic. It was easy, though. I used peanuts because I didn't have cashews, but it was still good. Warm the nuts before you serve them to bring out the most flavor.

Very good - I doubled the sauce (as I do with almost anything I cook that's to be served over rice) and put quite a bit more soy sauce to even out the acidity of the orange juice. It's going in the permanent recipes file ;)

After the reviews, I found this disappointing. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't particularly good either. I doubled the veggies and sauce and added some cauliflower, half a red pepper, minced garlic, salt and pepper. A healthy recipe but nothing special.

This was a big hit with the family! It was dead easy to make. And everyone rantend, raved and ate second helpings. I changed the recipe by cutting the chicken into cubes, coating them in cornflour and frying them until lightly golden. I did this the day before because it was for a big family dinner. On the day of the dinner I added the chicken towards the end so it was warmed, but overly cooked. Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish was excellent. I read the reviwers and follow Larkspur advice to add brocoli stems since I didn't have celery. I also added garlic, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, brocoli florets and fresh squeezed orange juice. Served with basmati brown rice.

I love this dish.  The sauce and the veggies are perfect together.  I didn't have the celery, scallions and cashews but I have all these other veggies in my fridge that I need to cook before they go bad.  So I just gathered all the veggies i could find, cut them into small pieces, and basically followed the recipe.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this dish, even my picky 2 yr old.  This will be my go to veggie dish from now on.

Wow! This is a very deceptive recipe! It is so easy to make, yet it tastes so amazing that you would never know by the taste how simple it really is! The only changes I made were to add sliced broccoli stems instead of the celery, and I used pineapple-orange juice instead of just regular juice because that was all I had! Oh, I also used walnuts instead of cashews as well. It was still so wonderful that I will be making it again and again!

I had some cut up chicken breasts marinating in Italian dressing overnight and was looking for a recipe. This was very good and easy to make. I doubled the sauce and added more veggies. I did sprinkle garlic powder & pepper and on the chicken. I didn't have peanut oil, so I mixed a little sesame oil with olive oil. I also steamed my veggies until they were tender crisp. I browned the chicken, added the sauce & cooked until it got thick, then mixed all together in a bowl. I served with brown rice. My whole family liked it and wants me to make it again. I had leftovers for lunch today and it was just as good heated over.

This is a good recipe. It's not bland, but not as intensely flavorful as I had guessed. Obviously, one needs to have an appreciation for the ginger flavor if he is to enjoy this recipe. Ginger is prominent. I chose to add a little salt at the end, which bumped the flavor up a bit. The cashews and green onions taste exceptional. I had one helping without them; I just forgot. When I added them in the flavor went from 3 star to 4 star.  Why don't I have stirfry more often?  It's easy and very good.

It was good, but lacking some flavor. I used almond slivers instead of cashews, added a little brown sugar, a vidalia onion, and half a cup of sweet orange marmalade.  I drizzled extra honey on top of my plate for more flavor, and put it on a bed of brown rice. I will probably make this again.

If you're looking for a healthy meal with a light tangy sauce, this is it. I served it over white rice, and added the cashews in a minute or two before the dish was ready (softened them a bit). Very fresh and simple.

I really liked thi sand it really surprised me too! The sauce tasted horrible right after mixing it all together an di was hoping it would taste better once warm and thicked and it did! A lot better. I don't eat meat so I used a fantastic substitute called Veat which has the same exact texture and flavor as chicken w/out the death of an creature! Anyhow,it coated very well and it was just tangy and sweet enough and it looked like a restaurant dish! I will make again!

This was a great variation on the usual stir-fry. The orange juice and cashews gave the dish an extra-sweet kick! Next time, I'll add more vegetables, but we were totally satisfied!

This was very yummy. I, too, changed things a little bit. I halved the amount of chicken and added broccoli and more carrots. I served this over bulgar wheat. This is another allrecipes keeper. I think I will try adding a dash of tabasco or red pepper flakes to the leftovers. With or without the extra spice, this was terrfic.

I had this dish tonight for dinner and was thrilled with how it turned out.  Per someone's recommendation, I added in 1/2 of both a red and green pepper as well as some sliced mushrooms.  I also added two tablespoons of a store brand Orange Citrus Marinade to give it some extra zip.  The result is one happy customer... thanks for sharing!

I didnt think I would like orange flavor in my stir fry, but this was really good. I substituted orange punch for the OJ, and it worked well. If I make this again I will double both the sauce and veggies.

This recipe was great for me because it didn't require any fancy ingredients.  I live in South Korea and many of the spices used in Western cooking are very difficult to find here.  Cooking this took very little time which is great for someone with a busy schedule like myself.

This recipe is excellent. It is so versatile. We aren't big celery fans here so I usually substitute with whatever vegetable we have on hand (broccoli, snap peas). I've even used Apple juice in a pinch before. Definitely one of our favs. The sauce is delicious.

When I tasted just the sauce before mixing all together I found it heavy on the oj flavor, BUT when eating it with the chicken and veggies, I ended up eating a 2nd serving.  Thought it worked well all together!  Family liked it.  I did add more veggies, as well as some bell pepper and broccoli since we needed to use it up.

This was pretty good and made a fast weeknight dinner.  I used broccoli instead of celery and left out the green onions.  I had to use powdered ginger in place of fresh, but would use fresh next time.  I think the title is misleading though, as it is more of an orange-nut stir fry and not so much honey.  You could definitely taste the orange flavor, but if you use good quality orange juice, it turns out nicely.

Loved this healthy recipe!  I have made this several times with a few cooking changes.  I omitted the ginger root.  I cooked the chicken first in 1 TBS of hot peanut oil and then removed it from the pan.  Added another 1 TBS of peanut oil and the vegetables, including water chestnuts, green and red bell peppers, and cooked for 3 minutes.  I then added 1/3 cup water and placed a lid on the pan for 2 min.  Removed the lid, added the chicken again and cooked for a couple more minutes before adding the orange juice mixture.  Once it thickened, I added the cashews and green onions, tossed a couple of times and served over a bed of white rice.  The vegetables were still crunchy and not mushy.  What is so terrific about this recipe is how easy it is to add different vegetables for a different combination with this flavorful sauce.  It's easy and a wonderful to eat lots of fresh vegetables.  Thanks so much!

Pretty good, I've never been able to duplicate the taste of asian cuisine at home and this came pretty close. Served it with broccoli and some fried brown rice.

Excellent, fast, and easy! I went a little heavier on the ginger and added a big pinch of red pepper flake. Only way to do it!

This was great! I had to use garlic in place of the ginger, and i added some red pepper flakes. Next time I will make sure I have ginger since it could have used just a little more kick.

This was OK - a good starting point, but not good by itself. Sauce didn't thicken, even though I had added cornstarch. I eventually took it off the heat before the vegetables were cooked into oblivion, but the sauce was still very watery.

Could have used more spices for flavor, too.

A very good stir-fry! I used canola oil instead of peanut oil and onions instead of celery (I hate celery). I also left out the spring onions as they give me heart burn. However, even with all these changes, the end result was still very yummy. I'll definitely make this again!

I wasn't all that crazy about this recipe.  I made this almost to a T (except I doubled the sauce, which actually isn't necessary unless you add a LOT more vegetables or want lots of goo for your rice).  It was too sweet for my taste, the green onions didn't seem to go with the rest of the dish and the orange flavor was very overpowering.

The cashews and green onions sprinkled on top are what really "make" this dish and take it from 4-star to 5-star, so don't skip those two magical ingredients! I loved this recipe - very easy, delicious and healthy. How often do you get a recipe that fulfills all three requirements!

This was a good dish.  I marinated the chicken in soy sauce and chili paste for a few hours before stir frying it.  I also added a fresh mix of chive, basil and cilantro to the top of the stiry fry when I finished cooking it.  Instead of cashews, we had Beer Nuts, so I put those on top.  So good!!  I will make this dish again.

We loved this recipe!  It was so simple and tasted great.  I used olive oil instead of peanut oil since that's all I had at home.  I upped the amount of oil a bit.  I also took advantage of the salad bar at my local grocery store.  It sure cut down on a lot of the prep work since I was able to buy already cut up celery & carrots.  The sauce was fantastic, I didn't change a thing.  Next time I may try adding additional vegetables!

This was good except for the orange juice - it was too much.  I would recommend using about 2 tablespoons as opposed to the 3/4 cup.  I don't think I would make this again.

This was okay, but not great.  The citrus flavor was kind of overwhelming and did not meld well with the other ingredients.  I probably won't make this again.

We loved this! Left out the cornstarch because I didn't think it was needed. Next time, I will add more ingredients, perhaps broccoli or red and green pepper. Also, I used no-salt cashews and next time I will use regular cashews or honey roasted ones. The type that I used seemed to be a bit too soft.

This was the first recipe I tried from this website. I added some onions, green, yellow and red peppers to the vegetables which gave extra flavor to the stir-fry and also added much more soy sauce and ground ginger to the sauce. It was rich with flavor and guests loved it.

Good recipe. Red & green peppers made this tastier & very pretty, plus a little diced pineapple adds more citrus and interest. I also used pre-marinated lemon pepper chicken breast (most groceries seem to carry them) which I cooked first, then chopped and added near the end.

I made this recipe tonight...I did it a bit different...I used carrots and broccoli, garlic and just a touch of crushed red pepper flakes.  I also doubled the sauce as I had ALOT of chicken.  My husband really liked it.  I thought it was pretty good and I would make it again !  It might be really good with beef too, or even pork...worth a try.  Anyway, thanks for the recipe !!!

This was an amazing recipe.  I'm a college student and I made it for my friends.  It's quick, easy, and everyone loved it!  I added extra veggies and a neat idea is to add small orange slices when the stir-fry is finished cooking.  (Don't try tangerines, they're too bitter.)

Absolutely delicious! I used fried tofu instead of chicken, and added some broccoli in addition to the carrots and celery......the Agedashi-esque Tofu recipe from Allrecipes worked amazingly well with this.

My husband is diabetic and it's hard work trying to find suitable tasty recipes.  When we first tasted it I asked him what he thought and re replied "I'm not sure yet".  I tasted it and thought it was great.  He said he thought so too but didn't want to influence my opinion.  We'll certainly have this regularly and make it when entertaining guests, as it is so quick to make.

The sauce was like something you'd get at a restaurant.  I really enjoyed this!  My kids weren't crazy about it but they are really young (4&6).  I only used one teaspoon of oil and substituted the veggies for frozen red, yellow & green peppers as well as frozen snowpeas and carrots.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I thought it was great. Kind of spicy!My family thought it was a bit salty. I didnt use sodium free soy sauce though so thats most likely why, because thats the only "salt" that was in here!ha. I served over rice.great. :)

This recipe was decent.  I love Chinese food and we have some outstanding local restaurants which probably taint my opinion on all home stir frying.   I made this according to the directions but quickly found it too "orange" flavored for my taste and bitter.   Added more honey as others have and ended up "doctoring" a little more with red pepper flakes, etc.   Just OK in the end.   It's worth another try, bending some of the flavor proportions in a direction that we like.  That is the beauty of stir-fry.   You can adjust as you go.

The sauce is delicious.  I put in garlic and  onions with vegetables, also mushrooms.  I don't like nuts, so did not use cashews.  I added stock cube and dried chillies. and didn't find the orange juice too much.  I also went lightly on the cornflour.

I made this for my girlfriend who loves veggies, so i added broccoli and sugar snap peas.  Plus i stir fried up some noodles on the side for a nice base.  It was a huge hit, the sauce is sweet and tangy.  We will definitely be having this again!!!

I really liked this, but didn't love it. It's very flavorful but I think a little bit too sweet for me. Next time I'll try to cut the OJ in half and substitute the other half with chicken stock and see if that cuts out on the sweetness. Otherwise, this was so easy to make and it really did taste great. I made it with white rice - the sauce from the chicken tasted great with the rice.

easy stir fry,great sauce.Added diced onion to the carrots and celery, salt and ground pepper. After chicken was cooked and simmering for the sauce to thicken(which it did very well) I added in some parboiled frozen peas but just about any green veggie would work. Also, added some brown sugar while simmering the sauce.

We loved this, but I also doubled the sauce recipe and instead of doubling the soy sauce I used 3 tbsp soy sauce and added 2 tbsp. Hoisin sauce. Also added fresh broccoli and water chestnuts. Served over brown/white rice mixture. We will add this to our menu more often!

This was an excellent recipe. Did add the garlic and sesame oil  and increased the veggies as suggested by some reviewers . My husband can be picky at times when trying out new recipes and he enjoyed this dish with no complaints. Will definitely use again and thanks for the submission. There are actually few chicken recipes that I have used from this site that I don't use again and again. Most are fast and not a lot of work and the results tasty!

I thought this dish was excellent! I used turkey cutlets cut in strips because thats what I had out. I cooked the meat first until no longer pink. Then I added three fresh cloves of glaric, I diced up half of a fresh tomato with seeds removed, half an onion, a can of green pigeon peas (drained), 1 cup frozen mixed veggies, and added it to the pan with the meat, and cooked for a few minutes to soften up the onion and glaric. I followed the recipe for the sauce to the T except I used ground ginger not fresh. Poured the mixture over the meat, added some hot sauce and red pepper flakes for some heat, mixed well covered and cooked for another ten minutes. This is a keeper, will make again. You can use any type of protein you wish, even tofu if your a vegetarian. Served this over brown rice.

No "zing" to this stir-fry, and much too orange-y.  Not something that I'd cook again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It is defintely a keeper. I substututed turkey for chicken and it was equally enjoyable. Just make sure you cut up the turkey pieces quite small as the turkey is not quite as moist as chicken breasts.

Easy to make and the only thing you might want to do is add more carrots and celery. Definitely use fresh ginger because it adds more flavor. We ate without putting this over anything, but if you want you could put over rice. We didn't have any green onions so didn't bother & not sure if really necessary. Will be making again.

This was fine, but didn't really "wow" us.  Easy to make, but likely not make again, only because it seemed rather bland.

It's good, but I taste a bit  of the orange juice in the stir fry. I also like how people added zucchini instead of celery. I don't think the celery was needed.

It didn't taste bad but I was surprised how bland this was considering the ingredients would suggest otherwise.

Really good. I had fun cooking this. I Cooked the chicken on the BBQ before cutting it up in the stir fry. I also added mushrooms. My husband liked it a lot.

This was good. The only change I made was adding a red bell pepper. Next time I would add more veggies (broccoli, edamame, snow peas, ...) It really has a nice flavor and is easy to make.

Fast, healthy, mild flavor. I would add sugar snap peas and maybe a smidge of red pepper flakes.

This was excellent! 

Of course I put my own spin on it. I didn't have orange juice so I used pineapple (100%); I mixed the whites of the chopped scallions into the veggies and the green into the sauce; I used sesame oil because I didn't want to buy peanut; I think I used 3 or 4 Tbsp of chopped fresh ginger; I toasted the cashews; and finally I tossed organic bean shoots (bean sprouts) on top of the finished and served products. 

So delicious! Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow. ^_^

Decent stir fry. We added more veggies. Loved the texture and crunch of the cashews.

Quick, easy, tasty. I added more veggies (green peppers, broccoli, snow peas and water chestnuts) and doubled the sauce. Next time I'll probs use more ginger and soy and a little less juice and honey as the sauce was just a little sweeter than I would have liked. Overall very tasty. Good for a weeknight.
