This was really a great marinade. It makes a lot so it will go a long ways. I used it on pork chops (marinated for 8 hours) as opposed to fish and it really turned out wonderfully on the grill. I did omit the tequila (didn't have any) and I did add a Tbl of brown sugar to sweeten it just slightly. Will use again! Would also recommend it for use with chicken.

AMAZING! I used it on tilapia and shrimp (marinated for about 12 hours) and the flavor was incredible - really fresh and tangy, but not too overwhelming. Would probably be just as good without the tequila. Five stars!

Outstanding marinade...made as directed.  Used it with talipia and shrimp and then grilled them.  Put in warm flour tortillas and topped with Avocado, Tomato and Mango Salsa (from this site)...excellent!  (Was worried that marinade would be too strong because I marinated seafood for 3 hours...no worries...it was perfect.  Didn't have problem with fish turning green, either.)

Excellent marinade!  Used it for grilling shrimp! Used lemon juice instead of lime and it worked quite well!

Thanks for a wonderful marinade!  The flavor was just right-tangy, spicy and not over powering at all.  Tried it on shrimp kabobs and cod fillets, then grilled them both.  Made for a light and refreshing meal.  Enjoyed with a New Zeland White wine and Maui Sunset, what a perfect night.

No time to marinate so I roasted fish kebobs in the sauce @ 375 for 25 minutes. Brilliant! I know it wold be even better grilled.

This marinade is wonderful, I wouldn't change a thing. I made a half recipe for a freshly caught striper, and it was a huge hit! The thick consistency helps the marinade stick to the meat for lots of flavor. Definitely making this one again, and again. I think I'll try it on chicken too!

I've made this marinade several times for grilled veggies and chicken. The recipe is huge, so I cut it in half unless I'm entertaining a crowd. Made as written, it was a bit spicy for my husband, but cutting the jalape√±o in half was still flavorful enough for me. The downside is that this does take some time to prep, but if you make it in advance and marinate overnight, the meat and veggies can go right on the grill without extra effort which is great for entertaining. I use it at least twice each summer.

We loved this with chicken breasts on the grill! After adjusting for 4 instead of 8, I added more lime juice to 1/2 cup and just used the whole bottle of Mexican beer (why not?!). I'm not a fantastic griller so I've learned to marinate extra long -- 4 hours on this one. The chicken was absolutely divine! Great lime taste with an earthy note from the beer. This is so easy and so good.

The most amazing shrimp marinade I have ever tasted.  I felt like I was sitting on a sunset beach restaurant in Mexico.  Don't change a thing.  Don't even think about skipping the cilantro.

This is perfect! Some people like heavy flavor, I don't, not on my seafood! It's not red meat, so... This was pefect! And I also used the marinade to keep the other three meats I tried also at the same time moist! Thanks!

I marinaded for an hour prior to baking some Tilapia and broiling some shrimp.  The flavor didn't penetrate the meat very well and my family was a bit turned off that the fish and shrimp were green.  The flavor of the  marinade was ok, but I won't be making this again.

I used it on Shrimp Kabob's for a party and got rave reviews and several requests for the recipe.  I backed off on the onions though.

Great flavor! Used this for fish tacos on Talapia. Even good the next day,I usually don't save fish, don't like the taste the next day, surprisingly okay on the second day. I did omit the Tequila as I did not have it in the house. This is a keeper!

I cut in half the amount of jalapenos for my husband.  The shrimp was still most delicious even with only half the jalapenos and I am a jalapenos lover.
