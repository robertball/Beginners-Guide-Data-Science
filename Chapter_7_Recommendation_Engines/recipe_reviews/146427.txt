This has very good taste, but still wasn't a hit with my family.  I may make it again once a year or so.

I used chicken broth instead of just water. This recipe is tasty.

This soup is just delicious! It's very easy to make and it has the best taste! My mother made it for the first time several months ago and then recommended it to me and now I keep some in my freezer all the time. It makes six very generous servings!

Outstanding!  I am on Dr. Joel Furhman's "Eat to Live" diet and this recipe makes boring beans a wonderful food.  I like the crisp celery and carrots.  Just right.  Sometimes I add lemon or worchestershire sauce at the table for a little more zip.

This is an easy, excellent soup that has become a favorite request of my family. I used chicken broth instead of water and added 2/3 cup Idaho instant potatoes during the last 5 minutes.
