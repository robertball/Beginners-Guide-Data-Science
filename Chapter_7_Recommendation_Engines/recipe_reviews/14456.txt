You have got to try this salad it is sooooo good.  I was paying alot of money for this from the local supermarket deli.  I was so happy when I found the recipe.  Gave some to my friends one didn't like tomatoes the other doesnt like cucumbers and they both said that they like this salad.  One of my new signature dishes.

My husband and I both loved this salad.  I added a little more lemon juice and garlic to the dressing, but just because that's our taste.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!

It is really good.I perfer to use the plain feta cheese instead of the flavoured one.
It is best to make the night before or at least a few hours, inorder for the salad to have a better flavour.

This served as a good base for my salad.  I made the salad as stated,  adding chopped sundried tomatoes,  and a little extra vinegar and lemon.  After refrigerating for about 5 hours,  I tossed with romaine and feta before serving.  I recieved a lot of compliments on this one.  Thanks for the recipe. :)

I think I just had the best lunch I ever had.  I just made up this salad and it was delicious.  I didn't measure the dressing ingreadients I kind of just poured them in  and tasted as I went along and it turned out fabulous.  I added a large clove of garlic and next time I think I might use a small one, it was  a little strong and  I don't think anyone will talk to me now for a week.

I made this with the baked havarti chicken and it was excellent.  Hubby, who was skeptical, and not fond of feta, actually said "ok, we can move to greece now"  ;)  I was actually quite proud that I made my own dresing rather than using store bought.  The only thing that i changed was that i let the veggies marinate in the dressing overnight and I think it turned out excellent.  Resturant quality even.  Will absolutely make again.

The dressing seemed to have too much oil in proportion to the rest of the ingredients.  I added more lemon juice, but it still lacked something for my taste.  Still looking for that elusive "perfect" Greek salad dressing.  Thanks for sharing!

A friend of mine made this at her last party and it was so good I had to have the recipe.  I make it all of the time now and everyone loves it. I do like the regular feta cheese also though.  Now if they would just make low cal olive oil!

The dressing is really good with a few adjustments. Double the vinegar, lemon, and oregano and its perfect. I usally keep some made in the frig to use on all kinds of salads.

Great recipe. Used peppercorn feta and let the salad marinate overnight. The ultimate compliment came from my niece, who when told I had made it from scratch, replied "Yeah, right..."

This is a good one. Only I reduced the oil quite a bit & forgot to add cheese. Yet it tasted pretty good. Thanks.

I've been making this salad for a couple of years and have passed it on to many others who love it! I LOVE the dressing recipe and wouldn't change a thing to that part. The only changes I make are: using half a red onion, omitting the olives (husband dislikes them), and using regular reduced fat feta cheese. Sometimes, just for something different (looks great and serves more guests), I add half a head of red cabbage, chopped, and then double the dressing recipe - it's a huge hit.

Wow...simple, easy, yummy.  Normally we order Greek salad, this was my first time making it.  I added a slightly bit more lemon juice and red wine vinegar... and we used kalamata olives which we had on hand.  I also added a few leaves of romaine that we wanted to use up.  So simple and yummy.  Great recipe.   Don't forget to add salt and pepper to your dressing...and taste it first.  Makes all of the difference. :)

Wow!!  This salad is wonderful!! I used double the amounts of red wine vinegar, lemon juice, and feta called for.  Additionally, I used plain feta instead of tomato basil.  Since the store was out of plumb tomatoes, I used cherry tomatoes instead.  I cut them in half.  They were so sweet and added to the flavor.  My partner loved this salad and I plan to add it my list of regulars.

My whole family loved the dressing for this salad. We like Greek salad and eat salads several times a week. The dressing is lemony which is how we like it at the restaurants we eat Greek food at. The herbs give it balance and you can still taste all the veggies.

Excellent Salad Recipe, Lynn. The only thing I changed was to substitute Kalamata olives for the black and used plain Feta rather than flavored. Very Yummy! For a more filling salad, I sometimes add Romaine lettuce, too. Thanks for sharing!

I really like the dressing. The salad ingredients make a delicious standard greek salad, but if you don't have all the ingredients, it's OK.  Just dribbling a bit of that dressing on a few sliced tomatoes is yummy.

Delicious! My wife said the dressing was very good. I doubled the dressing part of the recipe and I used red onions, and one slice of deli thin cut salami cut in half in my version of the classic greek salad. My whole family enjoyed this, and I will look forward to making it again.

Very good. Just added a lil more vinegar and garlic. The dressing was perfect and light. I also prefer the traditional feta cheese.

The family loved this salad!  The vinegar and lemon juice does not overpower the dressing at all.  It has a mild taste, which we loved.

This taste just like the greek salad you buy in the restaurant. It is so easy to make and tastes amazing! Everyone over supper was raving about how good it was. I just added 2 extra teaspoons of red wine vinegar and used red onions. Enjoy!

MMMMMM this recipe was really good. The leftovers got better and better. I can't have feta so I used blue cheese but that was the only change I HAD to make. Thanks for posting this recipe. I'm making it again tonight.

Made this salad twice, for a potluck and a house party, and it was a great success! I did make several adjustments, though. I used 1/8 cup vinegar and 1/8 of oil, little tiny bit of sugar, extra garlic ,fresh oregano and thyme. I prefer plain feta as I add the spices and I decided to stir in some 3-color pasta (rotini). Results were awesome. Definitely a keeper!

Instead of making the dressing I used a pkg. of Italian dressing made with up with red wine vinegar and salad oil.  It gave great flavor to the salad.

I made this salad for Thanksgiving and it came out nice. I  didn't use quite so much oil and vinegar as was stated in the recipe. Used a lot of feta cheese because my family loves it. Going to make again for Christmas.

This recipe was pretty good.  I doubled the red wine vinegar and lemon juice in the dressing, but it still seemed like just too much olive oil.

Simple and wonderful.  I used halved grape tomatoes and a seeded regular cucumber since that was what I had in the fridge.  This is a simple and easy salad.  I was surprised even my 4 year old ate the cucumbers without a fight.

I’ve always loved Greek salad but hate buying it because it’s always saturated in dressing. My son made this salad while I was at his house so I had some. Amazing! I could eat it as a meal! We made a huge bowl  for my daughter’s birthday party and surprisingly everyone loved it! Ate the whole batch. I’m making it again today for dinner! Been craving this salad!

I used this recipe as a guide and not word for word.  I added a lot more veges than it called for and used the same ingedients for the dressing only in different ratios.  I also  added Cavendar's Greek Seasoning...that is what made it so good plus I had my own Greek Seasoning that I had made and added.  I used the same ratio of Extra Virgin Olive Oil as I did to the other liquid which was at least 1/2 cup.  I made a salad to feed 8 to 10.  One thing though I would recommend is to use whole cherry tomatoes instead of the romas.  I seeded the romas and my cucumbers but still wound up with a lot of liquid coming from the veges.  I only use these recipes as a guide and then add whatever it is we like to it.

My favorite salad. We moved to India about a year ago and it's so hard to find good lettuce where we're living so I was having a hard time making a good salad until I stumbled upon this recipe. However, it's a cucumber base salad so I put 5-7 large cucumbers and use green olives instead of black. I also use regular cubed cheese instead of feta. It comes out great every time. Stirring the dressing till the salad mix is ready is brilliant; it mixes the flavors so well. Thank you.

I brought this to a party and everyone kept asking who made it because they loved it.  I made original recipe which was great.  I added some extra feta cheese, lemon juice, 1 can of beets, and 2 cans of quartered artichokes just based on personal preference.

I made this for a BBQ recently and used various coloured bell peppers instead of just green. Everyone loved the salad, especially how colourful it was.  I have added this to me favourites list and will definitely make this again.

Loved It!!  Used a block of plain feta and cut in squares instead of crumbled sundried tomatoe basil feta - - also used the dressing from this site "Absolutely Fabulous Greek / House Dressing" and  unbelievably good - - and lasts for days!  Will be my go-to Greek Salad combo.

I was in a hurry so I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic in the dressing. And I think I used a little more lemon juice than was called for. Also I added a little Dijon mustard to help the oil & vinegar emulsify. But Other than that I followed the recipe fairly accurately. It was a big hit!

This salad was so light and flavorful! The dressing was perfect for our taste. I don't care for feta cheese but this was all so good together. Made it again the following weak. I added kalamata olives this time! So good!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I used kalamata olives and added a bit more lemon juice and red wine vinegar than the recipe called for.  I like my cucumbers sour!  I also used grape tomatoes since that's what I had, but I don't think it added or took away anything from the original recipe.

I made this and followed directions as shown and added green pepper chunks.  I increased the servings to 10 thinking there would left over from a family of 5.  The salad was delicious because of the wonderful fresh ingredients. Next time I will decrease the amount of olive oil and increase the amount of lemon juice and red wine vinegar to more flavor. It made a great main salad  served with a side dish of pizza!

Okay this is a great dish for spring and summer!! But, my husband loves to get creative in the kitchen. So here is a litter twist on it. I guess you would call it Sautéed Greek Salad... After preparing as directed above we placed in the fridge for 4 hours, stirring occasionally to allow the flavors to absorb well. Then placed 3 table spoons of butter melted in a large skillet, poured in all the ingredients except the liquid, add an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of Garlic Powder cook until all veggies was nice and tender. Remove from heat and melted mozzarella over top.. It is nothing like a Greek Salad we know. But it was absolutely to die for.

YUM!! The only thing (for me) was the amount of dressing seemed like it would be WAY too much...no problem! I just made it on the side (with a little extra lemon and vinegar, as others suggested) and added to individual bowls, saving the rest for later. I used a little less than a tablespoon for my large portion of salad...it would be swimming if I used the whole amount! Thanks! This shall become a regular summertime dinner!

Yummm. Made a few minor changes, not worth mentioning. Delicious, fresh, summery taste. Surprisingly, it keeps well for a couple days in the fridge. Thought it would get too soggy but it didn't.

This salad is great!  I omitted the garlic and the olives but I know the salad would be great with them too.  Greeks do LOVE garlic! =)  I didn't use the tomato basil feta, I used plain feta and a LOT OF IT!  I think i used about 12 or 14oz of feta! I love feta and I like a lot of it in my Greek salad!  Also I didnt crumble my feta, I cut it into about 1/2 in cubes.  I like it this way so you can get a nice bite of feta.  Great recipe and good for you too!! Thanks Lynn!

Very Good!  I only had white wine vinegar on hand that I used instead of the red wine vinegar, but still yummy!  Added a bit of Garlic powder and black pepper for a little extra flavor that I think it needed.  Also, I would probably only use 1/2 of a lemon, taste, then add more accordingly.

Very yummy Greek Salad!! I will be making this again for sure. I served it with Holly's Hummus (Also on this site), Pita Bread, a meat & cheese platter with Prosciutto, Salami, Mozzarella, Munster, Provolone, olives & artichoke hearts. & For dessert the White Chocolate Fruit Tart (also found on this site). This was my birthday dinner & everyone loved it, I even loved preparing it!!

I loved this recipe - changed it up slightly - used chives instead of onion, and regular plain feta instead of flavored. Marinated everything together for about 5 hours before serving and turned out great!!

I adore this salad. It has a fresh, delicious taste. I frequently make it for a light lunch, and it would be a great side dish too. I use less oil to lighten things up, and add more lemon juice. I also prefer plain feta cheese.
