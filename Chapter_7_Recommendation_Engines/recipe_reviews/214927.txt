I made a little change and used smoked gouda to give it a little change in the taste. Got rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Made this for a small get together.  Big hit, went great with red wine.  I had never made stuffed mushrooms, so I thought it was a bit time consuming cleaning the darn things, so I only did about 20.  That's just me, not a reflection on the recipe.  Tasted great!!

This recipe did not turn out well for me. I must have done something wrong, since all 4 reviews before mine were very positive. My stuffed mushrooms came out dry, and the flavor was bland. I also detected a slight fishy taste, which is common in frozen spinach. I will not make this again, but for those who want to try this, I would recommend using fresh spinach (sauteed & chopped). Also, try drizzling with a little olive oil if it comes out dry.

I tweaked this a little based on what I had available and personal taste, but it turned out fantastic. I didn't have Gouda, so I substituted Asiago. I doubled the garlic and added 2 oz cream cheese because I knew I wanted mine to be very cheesy and one review mentioned they were dry. When I filled the mushrooms, I brushed a bit of melted butter over the mix before I sprinkled on the final Parmesan.  I actually had a little filling leftover, so I'm stuffing a couple portobellas for dinner tonight that I will serve with pasta and red sauce like a "stuffed portobello parmesan" The whole tray of these mushrooms disappeared in no  time at the potluck. You'll be so glad you made these.

I had part of a package of mushrooms to use up (8 mushrooms) and a couple handfuls of fresh spinach so I halved the recipe.  I quickly sauteed the spinach and then mixed in the remaining ingredients.  I used mozzarella, parmesan and rosemary asiago cheese (didn't have gouda).  I've never mixed an egg in mushroom stuffing before and I was skeptical but they are good!  I didn't sprinkle the additional cheese over the top - seemed like overkill to me.  I also used seasoned Panko bread crumbs instead of regular.  I will make these again!

Outstanding. I made these for a family gathering and they were gobbled up. I added some cream cheese to the mix just because I had it on hand.

This is a very basic recipe that with a little tweaking can be an awesome recipe. I halved the recipe because I only had 20 mushrooms of various sizes. The filling as written was dry and tasteless. I added 4 oz of cream cheese, Mrs Dash herb & garlic and shallots that I sauteed, I also omitted the salt. I laid the mushrooms on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, sprayed lightly with baking spray and baked for 10 minutes, flipped them over, filled and baked for 20 minutes, they were the first to go at our neighbourhood open house.

These were ok but pretty dry. If I made them again, I'd drizzle them w/garlic butter before the 2nd bake & maybe top them w/more cheese. Just felt they needed more humph.

I made these on thanksgiving and am looking forward to making them again for Christmas! My husband and his family also agreed these were the best stuffed mushrooms! They are addictive, my husband actually ran to the store on thanksgiving for me to make a second batch. This recipe is a keeper, the only change I made was I cooked fresh baby spinach.

The wife and I both loved this recipe/base. My variations were using Costco fresh mushrooms (some of which were 4-inches in diameter), fresh Kroger bagged spinach (boiled a minute or so until tender), shredded mozzarella and grated parmesian cheese and for the final baking, I covered the stuffed mushrooms with Sargento Light Swiss cheese.

Very easy, tasty, and we put this on our favorite list ! We used fresh spinach & chopped by hand ; may pulse spinach in a blender next time so that the mixture is more compact but not necessary.

I liked it, especially the low calorie count. I would probably use more cheese next time.
Thanks!

I have these at a restaurant and was looking for a crappy recipe and this fit the bill. It was very appetizing and are a great snack option.  I am a vegan so I substituted cheese for it dairy free cheese. It was a hit my kids even like them without realizing that I had change the recipe to a day free  vegan ?? recipe. kudos

I am so glad that hese were so simple to put together because they were gobbled up very quickly!  I followed the recipe with only one change, I added some finely diced red bell pepper for color.  I will definitely be making more of these!

I followed the directions pretty closely, except I used fresh garlic instead of from a jar. The flavor was very nice, but they were a ittle dry. I will make these again, but I will add a bit of cream cheese to moisten them up a bit.

This is the best mushroom appetizer !  I have taken this to several covered dish parties and everyone keeps asking me for the recipe.  My family also loves this and keeps asking me to make it as side dish with steaks and chops.  I sometimes substitute Asiago cheese just for a change.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made it and added a 1/2 cup of vegetarian meatless meat -TVP and the Gouda cheese had jalapeño bits and it was amazing.  Also diced the mushroom stems after cutting off hard stem ends.  I got both tips from others plus a similar recipe!  My wife loved them so much she went out two days later, bought the ingredients and tried to repeat...LOL.

Absolutely wonderful!  I didn't have gouda cheese, so i used some extra italian blend cheeses and fresh chopped spinach (no need to saute).  I used 12 extra large mushrooms with the full recipe, can't wait to make them again!

I chopped the stems of the mushrooms and added those to the fresh spinach I sautéed. It was good but I had to make enough changes that I don't think it was worth 5 stars.

Great recipe, came out perfect the first time and that doesn't happen very often in my kitchen. The only change I made was I didn't precook the shrooms. yummy!
