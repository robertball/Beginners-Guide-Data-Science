I was leary to try this cake, but it is actually really good!  I threw in a small zucchini that I had around, too.  The batter was very thick and I didn't think it would be moist enough, but once the fruit and veg is added, there's plenty of moisture and it mixes well.  I used whole wheat flour and would maybe add some ground flax seed next time to really drive home the healthy factor.

It's a lot of work grating up all of those veggies but well worth it. So moist and not overly sweet. I didn't have a bundt pan and so I used a 9 x 13 pan and didn't change baking times. Turned out very good. Thanks for the great idea!

This cake turned out great!  My kids love it and don't know they are eating their vegetables.  I used whole wheat flour and added a small zuccini.  The next time I will try reducing the butter.

This stuff is wonderful.  My dad threw away our grater, so I just thinly sliced the carrots and potatoes and used apple sauce instead and it still was awesome.  We eat this stuff constantly. Thanks very much.

My children all have different tastes, but they all loved this cake for our Sunday morning breakfast.  This is the one morning we have time to share breakfast together the "vege-cake" is now a Sunday favorite! (And I love that they are eating veges!)

Fantastic cake!  Perfect if you like a treat that's satisfying but not too sweet.  I could not find currants so I substituted them with dried cherries:)  I'm keeping the cherries in.  I will definitely make this again and pass the recipe on to friends.

I am looking forward to trying this recipe.  I am going to experiment with cutting back the sugar, maybe using agave syrup in place of.  Also would like to try it with a mixture of low-gluten flours.

This cake was Fantastic!!!! I left out the currants and used dark molasses and it was so tasty.  I brought it to work for the girls and they were shocked it had potato in it.  I will definitely make it again!

This was a really good cake.  My little sister just thought it was carrot cake, but the flavors went really well together, as well as with a bit of vanilla ice cream.

Man, this is good! I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and the juice from the orange I zested. I didn't have currants so I doubled the raisins. I also only used 1 1/2 tsps of baking powder because I was worried a full tablespoon would leave a bitter aftertaste. The predominate flavors are orange and spice, and it's wonderful. I think next time I make it, I will use whole wheat flour. Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome flavor and nice and moist.  Everyone loved it.  A bit of a pain to make though.  It was a bit crumbly too, but not dry at all!  I gave it 5 starts because even though it was a pain to make it was still so good.  The kids loved it!
