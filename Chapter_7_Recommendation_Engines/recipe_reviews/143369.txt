I doubled the recipe and brought this to an outdoor BarBQ. It disappeared quickly and no one seemed to even notice that there was no mayonnaise. The only thing I did differently with the recipe was that I used both all purpose white potatoes along with the red ones.

I cut the tofu amount in half and added a cup of plain yogurt instead. I also used jalapeno mustard, and it was delicious!

This salad is flawless.  I don't like mayonaise potatoe salad, but this one is light and delicious.  I can't taste the tofu!  It literally tastes like I used cream instead of tofu.  Very good.  Will make regularly from now on!

I was VERY skeptical about this recipe but my husband loves potato salad and we don't eat mayo anymore, due to health reasons.  Tried it and we were pleasantly surprised.  A little bland at first so we added a few TBL of sweet relish and that did the trick for us. Great alternative when mayo is out of the question.

This was great - certainly couldn't tell it was tofu! My only complaint would be that it tasted too strongly of mustard.  However, my husband did not think it was too 'mustardy'; he said it was exactly how a potato salad should taste!

My husband doesn't like mayonnaise but I love potato salad.  This recipe worked great for both of us!  I added some cilantro because I had it, but it didn't need it.

I am on WWs, so this appealed to me.  I calulated it as 6 PP value per serving, which is pretty good.   As with most recipes, I altered it a bit.. No green peppers,tripleded up on the mustard and added maybe a 1/2 cup of pickle juice. This is I think, the first time I have ever used tofu in a recipe, never mind silken tofu.  Of course, I have eaten tofu in various dishes at Chinese/Japanese/Thai restaurants.  This was, while light tasting, a great substitute for a mayo based salad.  I say give it a try and alter to suit your tastes!

I added cilantro, spinach, jalape√±o in it. I used my already diced up sweet onion and used regular idaho potato instead of red(use what I already have). I LOVED it!!

This is very good, and no one asked what the dressing was made of, so I didn't tell!  My family is so weird that I knew if they knew what the ingredient was, they suddenly wouldn't like the potato salad.  I mixed the dressing up the night before using it.  The salad is good and I liked all that was in it, but it was a tad dry.  I didn't add the pickles, as we are not a fan of them in our salads, so that may have accounted for a little of the dryness.  I did add the milk in right before serving.  My co-workers love playing 'guess the ingredient' in foods that I make, and this will be a good recipe for them to try.  Update:  I'm leaving my review at 4-stars for the day the salad is made.  It would only be a 3-star when serving the leftovers.  It is a little watery, and has a slight after taste.
