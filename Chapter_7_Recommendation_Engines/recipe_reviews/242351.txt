Great recipe!  Tasted amazing, great veggie combo.  I did make a change to the cooking process, however, but only because I don't have a pan that can go in the oven.  Instead, I sauteed the vegetables, put the mixture into a 9.5" glass pie dish, and then poured the eggs over it.  I believe the baking time ended up being 35-40 mins; I've lost track of how many times I added 5 mins.

Also, due to different tastes, I left out the jalapeño and the cayenne.  And since it was for my mother and she is lactose-intolerant, I also left out the cheese.  I did add bacon though!

Great base recipe! a little bland the first few times I made it, but a great snack on the go and very healthy.
If you want to spice it up a bit, I sauté an onion and mushroom to the dish. I switch up the veggies for whatever is on hand. 

be sure to add a good amount of salt to each step as the eggs can be tasteless if not.

Made it exactly as written and it was delicious! Will definitely make this again and is a great way to use the dozens of farm fresh eggs from our neighbor.

Chef John strikes again - simply awesome! Per video, set the oven temperature to 350, that's not in the recipe. Also the video suggests blending some pesto into mayo for a quick aioli style topper. Great call - as John says in the video, the dish doesn't need it, but it takes the dish to an even higher level.

First time making a frittata. Forgot asparagus at the store- added shitaki shrooms which filled it in nicely with a small yellow onion (omg yes!) and extra potatoes. Very very very good!! Added the simple aioli he recommends in the video which made it excellent! We'll see how it reheats in the morning for breakfast :)

Made this for my vegetarian mom for Mother's Day. Super simple and smells delicious! I went a little heavier on the vegetables and skipped the potatoes, and I used a tomato basil feta. I will definitely be keeping this recipe!

This was awesome!  Not a goat cheese fan so used a mixture of Parmesan Asiago and Mozzarella and everyone loved it!  Adding to my favorites for sure.

I followed it exactly. I could probably have baked it for a shorter amount of time.

Delicious! I had to sub a few things: jalapeño powder for fresh, chives and yellow onion for leeks, yellow squash for zucchini, nondairy plain yogurt for cheese, and didn’t have asparagus. Lol lots changed but I don’t think anything significant. I’m always looking for a tasty way to get my morning veggies, and this will be one of my go-tos! Two large and very filling servings for us and plenty leftover for lunches/next day. There’s a lot of chopping but that’s not a big deal and could be done ahead if needed. Oh, I did add some old bay seasoning which was a good fit.

Great use of vegetables! Used recommended vegetables but could use anything on hand. Found it easier to layer sliced potatoes on top of the sautéed vegetables, then added 3/4 of the cheese (used grated gruyere), then poured the eggs on top and sprinkled remaining cheese on top of all. Took approximately 35 minutes to cook until set and didn’t need to broil at the end.

Excellent!  I made for Mother’s Day brunch and it was delicious. The video was very helpful as this was my first frittata. I used a 12 inch skillet so added 2 eggs and 2 additional cups of vegetables (broccoli and mushrooms). I used one white and one sweet potato. I will certainly make it again.

My husband was inspired by Chef John to make this for Mother’s Day today. It was divine!!!! He followed the recipe, only needing to extend cooking time slightly. I absolutely loved it! Thank you chef!

I  used sweet potato instead of white potato, and added some leftover cauliflower and broccoli and minced onion instead of leeks and it turned out really good.

This was really a great recipe, and so simple! I did some substitutions with the veges,  what I had on hand.  I had some leftover corn,  didn't have any spinach. I did have a leek, and the zucchini . I put in some garlic, and used just regular cheddar cheese. Green chile instead of jalapeno. I only had half of a leftover baked potato. I have never had any luck with cooking frittatas in a skillet. I sauteed everything in some butter and olive oil (except the already cooked veges) then baked in a oiled pan for about 25 min until set. (Extra  time for high altitude) Topped with the cheese and that melted while it was cooling. Very versatile and yummy! The veges taste very fresh. I think next time I'll put a little dill in. Thank You Chef John for another great recipe!

This was an easy to follow recipe that can be adapted to use whatever vegetables I have on hand. I mixed it up a bit using some leftover cauliflower and fresh carrots. I cooked them in the skillet first since they were harder veggies

Yum! I used what vegetables I had on hand from the garden- yellow summer squash, serrano pepper, swiss chard, snow peas, asparagus, and a red onion. I added red pepper sprinkles, garlic, salt, pepper and 12 fresh eggs from our hens. Before I added the eggs over the top of the hot vegetables, I sprinkled feta cheese over the top. I sprinkled Monterey jack cheese over the top of it all and baked at 350 in a 13x9 pan for 25   minutes.

I made this for the Mothers Day brunch my wife and I just hosted for our family. I didn't really change the recipe, I just doubled it using a 15 inch iron fry pan.
This turned out great, and my wife, mother-in-law, and our entire family really loved it.
I found it very easy to make, even though I had to guess on the cook times because of the volume I made, but everyone enjoyed it so much, I know I'll be making it again.
Thank you, Chef John, you're the man...

Beautiful for small brunch. So tasty, and no bread!   Love it. I used mozzarella and Parm. Just prefer it. Made it,  baked it, broiled it all in the cast iron skillet. So easy.
