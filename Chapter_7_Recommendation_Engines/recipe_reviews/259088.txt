7.22.17  My mango was at its peak ripeness, and this morning,  I enjoyed an absolutely delicious, creamy, full fruit flavor breakfast drink, and I even used skim milk.  I really think of this as a smoothie, more than a drink, but call it what you like, just give it a try  I like the nutritional breakdown on this, as well, and I know this will be making a repeat performance soon!  Niayola, thanks for sharing your recipe.

My whole family loved this mango drink. I didn't have enough ice cubes, so I used almost frozen milk to make up the difference. This recipe is going in my favorites.
