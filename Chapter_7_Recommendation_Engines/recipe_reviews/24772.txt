Hubs and I loved these! It's such a treat when I find a recipe that truly stands out from the ordinary! I found the tiniest Yukon potatoes which were particularly attractive on the plate. The recipe is just perfect as is, although the next time I make these I might try a little more horseradish for just a bit more kick. For presentation and a bit of color I sprinkled some finely chopped parsley over the top, but fresh minced chives would be equally good. Just delicious!

A delicious side dish that is ready in a flash. I cut the new potatoes in quarters to speed up the cooking time. The potatoes were ready in half and hour.

I was surprised how good these were.  My husband even had seconds.  The horseradish takes on a sweet taste and the lemon is very mild.  I used low fat marg. to save on calories.  Will definitely make again.

Different and delicious!  I cut any larger potatoes in half. Needed to increase the cooking time slightly.  Recommend you stir the potatoes halfway through the cooking time to baste them in this delicious sauce!

These little potatoes took FOREVER to bake and my sauce ended up burning. So, once they were just about done, I transferred the potatoes to a new dish and remade the sauce and put them back into the oven. Next time I'll definitely take the advice of other reviewers and cook them in the microwave first and then the oven. The end result, however, was wonderful. Everyone really loved this dish!

I've made this a number of times, and everyone loves it.  Since I usually have them on hand, I use medium sized red potatoes, quartered and boiled for 15-20 minutes, and then just top with the sauce.  Simple and packed with flavor.

Wonderful.  The flavor is very unique.  Use real butter - margarine doesn't taste as good.  Recipe says you can just make the sauce and pour over cooked potatoes, but I wouldn't recommend it.  The sauce really needs the hour in the oven for the flavors of the horseradish and lemon to soften and blend.  I've made this three times and will make it many more, I'm sure!

Thought they were great! I sliced the potatoes and then stirred them every 10 minutes or so in the oven and it only took 1/2 the time.  I would definitely recommend them!

Very easy to prepare.  I used a crinke cutter and placed the mixture in a foil bag and grilled it.  The taste was fairly good, although I am not sure if I would make it again.

I made these last night and they were delicious. Even my 6 and 2 year olds loved them. I doubled the horseradish and lemon and added some dried parsley flakes- mostly for color- and parboiled the potatoes first and they came out wonderful. Will definitely make these again.

This was wonderful! I roasted the potatoes at 400 degrees for about an hour, so they were browned and crispy on the outside, but buttery on the inside. I also made two batches of sauce- one to cook the potatoes in and one to toss them in after they were done cooking. I got rave reviews on this!

This is the recipe which introduced me to All Recipes.  A few years ago, I was at a friend's for dinner, and she served these potatoes.  They were fantabulous!!I begged her for the recipe and asked her where she got it from.  She told me "All Recipes".  The minute I arrived home that night, I immediately went to their web-site, and I've been addicted ever since.  It's the only one I go to for recipes, now.

I roasted the potatoes uncovered and they were browned and so good. I cubed yukon gold potatoes instead of using new potatoes. I served these at a party and everyone asked for the recipe. (No one could tell there was horseradish in the recipe.  It adds a subtle flavor.) Love this recipe!

I have tried this recipe twice. The first time as written and the second time with a mix of potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion. Both times it turned out excellent. Everyone in the family loved it, even the picky ones. We will be enjoying again soon.

These potatoes were absolutely FABULOUS, they reminded me of Greek Lemon Potatoes if you changed the seasoning a little. The kitchen smelled wonderful while they were cooking.  I was glad I made extra because everyone wanted more.

 Because I read the other reviews, I doubled the lemon and horseradish.  I used rather small new potatoes cut in half and they were done in about an hour.  I also used olive oil instead of butter.  I think I might add some oregano next time too.  

This recipe is a keeper and will be served often at my table.

These were pretty tasty, but I followed the recipe exactly, and the potatoes were not thoroughly cooked.  You definitely need to cook them longer.  I was pleasantly surprised that the horseradish wasn't overwhelming.  It mellowed out with the lemon and butter.  I also added about 3 cloves of minced garlic for extra flavor.  I will make again, but will cook at least 10 minutes longer.

These potatoes are excellent.  I used Yukon Gold and quartered, cutting the cooking time to about 45 minutes.  I know others have done this on stove stop and served with the sauce, but baking really enhances the flavor.  I will definitely make these again and again.

Fabulous recipe!  Wouldn't change a thing, except to add that they are almost as good cooked in the microwave (in a covered dish).  Cook on high for about 8 minutes, stir, then cook for about 8 more minutes...times will vary of course, depending on your microwave.  Much quicker for those of us limited on time.  Thanks, Teresa!!

I was surprised that this could have used even more horseradish and lemon.  Also, I cut the potatoes in half and baked uncovered as I like them browned.

You could not of paid me enough to think I could ever slip horseradish by my husband, but I did last night.  I cut regular russet potatoes into 1" cubes and followed the recipe from there.  Not only did he eat them he raved about them!

I make these potatoes often.  They are wonderful.  I usually use small red potatoes and cut them into similar sized pieces, and prepare the sauce on the stove in a saucepan before mixing it into the potatoes.  They are tangy and crisp on the outside.  Thanks for a favorite recipe!

These were YUMMY! I did do a few things slightly differently as to what I had on hand and such...I used idaho potatoes that I chunked and replaced the butter w/ olive oil (using slightly less) because I was trying to be healthier. I also used the juice of 1 whole lemon and added in some dried parsley for color. I think that next time I will definately up the horseradish because I really loved the flavor that it gave to the potatoes and would love it to be even a bit more stronger. We were very pleased with these! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've made these twice now.  I doubled the sauce with 2# of potatoes.  I cut red potatoes depending on the size into quarters and sometimes 6ths.  I parboiled them for about6-7 minutes and left them in the strainer to get nice and dry.  I melt the butter in a saucepan (microwave would work fine) and then mixed in the horseradish, lemon juice and the other seasonings, then poured them over the potatoes in the tin foiled lined pan and mixed them gently.  This made quite a bit of sauce for the potatoes.  Put in in a 375 degree oven for approx. 30-35 minutes, gently stirring after 15-20 minutes.  When they were done, they were lightly crisp and the horseradish and lemon were perfect.  You could taste each individually.  This is an absolutely outstanding recipe.  The secret I found for me at least was doubling the sauce with 4 TBLS of the horseradish and the lemon.  My company were just mad for these potatoes.  I made Best Ever Brisket from this site to go along with them.  My whole dinner was heavenly!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Excellent recipe. My husband and I both really enjoyed it. I boiled the potatoes (until tender) and baked them for 15 minutes. Ran them under the broiler for 2.5 minutes to brown the tops. I also added 4 cloves of minced garlic (sauted in the butter) and 2 tbs mustard. This will become a staple in our house.

This was fantastic, as well as really easy.  Made some modifications though.  I nuke the potatoes for like 10 minutes, tossed in olive oil, so I don't have to cook for as long in the oven.  It gets done quicker, and they're more evenly cooked.  Great the original way though.  I make this all the time.

What a great combination horseradish and lemon.  What a tasty potato recipe.  Enjoyed with tomato chicken.  Used red horseradish.  Next time I will use white horseradish.

wow! These are amazing spuds. I thought the horseradish would be to strong but it was great. Really gave the spuds an extra zip of flavor. must try these :~)

KILLER POTATOES! My wife said they're the best potatoes she ever tasted- "better than french fries". Makes us want to try this with other vegetables like asparagus!  Only change: Baked for 45 minutes then BROILED for 2 minutes at end to finish, then added 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley.

Did not taste the horseradish at all.  We like strong horseradish, so I will probably double it next time.  I have high hopes for this recipe, I just think the original measurements don't meet our tastebud levels.

So glad I tried these! They were perfectly tangy, and the horseradish wasn't at all overpowering. I will make these again for sure!

This is a great recipe. The sauce is absolutely wonderful. I think the recipe should state that these potatoes should be sliced, and the smaller the better. When I make these again, I will be sure to double the sauce and remove the potatoes from the pan into a bowl and pour the sauce over them. Believe me, you will want to get every drop of the wonderful sauce! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and easy. Even my son who claims he hates potatoes (but loves horseradish) gobbled them up. Had tonight with steaks in cherry sauce over spinach. Perfect! Thanks for the recipe. UPDATE: Created an appetizer using this recipe with baby yellow potatoes and prawns, was soooo good. Thanks!

This was delicious. I par-boiled the potatoes(cubed-my preference) Mixed the sauce ingredients and melted them together. When the potatoes were just barely tender I drained and dried them well and then covered with the sauce. Then set them aside while my meat marinated. Reheated them over very low heat to fully cook the potatoes and cook the sauce. They were so-o-o good and full of wonderful tangy flavor. Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm a fan of this recipe and have made it several times. I recommend cutting the potatoes into halves or bite sized pieces in order to decrease cooking time and better meld flavors. I also think the recipe benefits from 3 tablespoons of horseradish rather than 2.

Loved!  Such a unique flavor.  I never would have thought of putting horseradish on roasted potatoes, but it is wonderful.  Like others, I quartered my potatoes - I used Yukon golds.  I tossed them in the mix of butter (NEVER use margarine), S&P, lemon juice and horseradish and then roasted covered for about half an hour.  I tossed them and then finished them uncovered because I wanted some crispy edges.  One caution for me is that the leftovers were not nearly as good the next day - the flavor seemed off.  So, at least for myself, I'll be making them just in the amount I plan to eat at one time.  They are so good, I'm fixing to make some more right now.  Thanks for such a deliciously different recipe!

Delish! I have made this 3 times in the last month.  I had family and friends in town at separate times and made this as a side. Got raves!  Recipe is so simple and delicious.  I add more horseradish and the zest from the lemon. My only regret is I didn't create this recipe!

Half butter half evoo.  Also added in about half a white onion.  I used a new HOT horseradish and it mellowed out a bit too much in the cooking process so next time I will add in a bit after cooking.

I just made these as the recipe says.   I cooked mine at 350 for like an hour and 20 minutes.. they still seemed like they needed to crisp up a bit and weren't fully soft.   Usually when I make red potatoes I cook them at 400*..  I will be making these again for sure but next time I may double the horseradish and use 5 or so cloves of minced garlic.   These lacked flavor but I only took off one star because I know they could be great with some tweaks :)

The taste was subtle so it's great with a strong flavored meat, like BBQ ribs.  However, it's a bit bland on its own.

I loved this recipe!  It was easy and tasty, I had no leftovers.

I did cut my potatoes in half.  Also, whenever I roast potatoes I cover them until they start to soften, and then remove the cover to brown.  This helps avoid the raw on the inside, black on the outside potatoes.

This is a tough recipe to rate.  The 1st time I made it, it was very greasy due to the butter & was barely brown at all because of being covered during baking.  I used the broiler at the end to crisp them a bit.  The second time I tried it, as I thought the flavor had possibilities, I substituted 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil for the butter & put all the ingredients in a ziplock bag which I shook.  I sprayed aluminum foil with Pam & baked the potatoes (cut up into potato salad size pieces) uncovered at 400 degrees, turning them once & checking that they didn't burn.  They were crispier & much less greasy this way.  I probably won't make them again as my family liked them but preferred my usual recipe with dried seasonings.

This was definitley a new way to make potatoes.  Next time I would add even more horseradish and lemon juice...my husband thought they needed more flavor.  I did precook them in the microwave for a bit first, they still did take a long time to bake. And they seemed to cook unevenly, next time I will boil them for a bit.

Good but not great.  It was surprisingly bland considering the horseradish.  I would double the horseradish and choose a "hot" brand.

I'll admit, I wasn't sure about this recipe.  But, I was curious.  Wow, what a good dish!  It was so delicious, so happy I tried it.  I had to par boil my potatoes before baking (I had many dishes going at the same time).  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly & they turned out great.  Next time, I'll double the horseradish (i love it).

I was a bit nervous about this recipe as I don't like spicy or hot at all.  They weren't and based on other reviews I increased the amount of horseradish.  I was amazed at how much the horseradish mellows out when you cook it. The only other things I changed was I added garlic.  These were delicious and I will definitely make these again and I may even try to increase the the horseradish a little more.

What a nice change of pace for potatoes!  Really enjoyed this and it uses ingredients I have on hand,love that.  Made as directed, other than cutting them in half.  Next time I think I'll uncover them to crisp up at the end.

Can't believe how good these were, I don't even like horseradish. I added dill.

I made these with a minor addition of some fresh green onions that I needed to use up.  Everyone loved them.  As previously stated by other reviewers, the horseradish was not a distinctive or overpowering taste.  So, if you don't like horseradish, don't let that stop you from trying these yummy potatoes.  I used my Pampered Chef stoneware roaster, and the potatoes turned out nicely browned on the outside and tender on the inside after an hour in the oven.  This is definitely a keeper.

Easy to prepare, but I wasn't too impressed with the sauce. The lemon flavor dominated, with some spice from the horseradish.

Another "wow" for Allrecipes!  This gives roasted potatoes an all new taste!  The horseradish is just enough for a little zip, not at all overwhelming, and the lemon juice balances it out with a little fresh lift of flavor.  Who would have thought to put these two together!  Loved it, and will keep it in my "serve this to company" file!

These were good. Won't replace my standard way of making new potatoes, but I would make these again occasionally for something different.

I took the advice of others - par-boiled then baked at 400 and then took the lid off - but never got the crispness.  BUT - added just a smidge more horseradish - other than that followed the recipe exeactly -  even though they weren't crispy - the flavor was wonderful!

Loved this recipe.  I added some chopped red onion, grated lemon rind, and extra horseradish. Although I am not really a fan of horseradish, it WORKS here, especially with the fresh lemon!  To my serving, I added Walmart's Peach-Pineapple Chipotle Salsa.  Totally yummy.  Thanks!

Very good.  Used russets instead of new potatoes and added a bit of garlic oil cause garlic is good!  Next time I will add more horseradish cause it was almost too mellow after cooking

I made these as written, and while tender and delicious, I was disappointed that I could not detect the horseradish; it just disappeared. I will make these again and try increasing it. Thanks for sharing the recipe - it's a great idea.

This recipe is very good but I felt it wasn't reaching it's full potential. It seemed in the other reviews most people cut the potatoes in half or in quarters to reduce the cooking time which I did as well based on the recommendations but after making this I think I would cut them even smaller or do slices. This is because the sauce was so delicious, I felt it needed to cover more surface area on the potatoes. Next time I will also make more of the sauce, I had to scrap it off the bottom of the dish and smother it on the potatoes to really get the flavor. The horseradish and lemon was so tangy and savory! To my sauce I added 1/2 tsp of lemon zest and 1 tsp scotch whisky to really make it punch.

I am not a potato fan although I serve them often. These tasted wonderful with its lemony-horseradish cooking sauce. Don't shy away if the horseradish scares you. It is tamed by the lemon and the starchiness of the potatoes. I used regular white table potatoes, skin on, cut into at least quarters. I parboiled them for 10 minutes to shorten the 1 hour baking time. I stirred them halfway, kept the cover on and they were cooked in about 40 minutes. I let them rest for 10 minutes in the baking dish when they were done to soak up the delicious sauce. I'm sure this would pair with any kind of meat, it went particularly well with steak.  Thanks for a real treat that I plan to make again soon.

After reading reviews, I double the amount of lemon and horseradish and I also subbed olive oil for the butter.  I cut the potatoes into halves and quarters to speed the cooking. The flavor was wonderful, not overpowering at all.  In fact, I think next time I will probably add even more horseradish.

Pretty good, though it was a little bland for my taste.  Not really enough sauce, but it went well with the pork that I made none the less.

This was tasty, but I felt it needed something more herby.  It was simply a dab of butter on potatoes.

YUM!! I made these with chicken breasts with a horseradish pan sauce (from a Rachael Ray cookbook). They were so good together, but the potatoes were SO good. I used regular Russet potatoes that I had peeled and diced. Will definitely make again!

Yummy!  These potatoes were the perfect side dish for a salmon dinner.  They have a wonderful aroma and flavor!  If you love horseradish as I do, you will love this recipe!  I added some minced garlic and dried parsley flakes, I also doubled the horseradish, salt, and pepper!  I can’t wait to make them again!

These were very yummy and easy. I cut them in small bites and they were ready to go in about 25 minutes. I served this with the Parmesan Tilapia on this site and it was a great compliment.. thanks for the wonderful recipe.. FYI they are not spicy so if u want spicy potatoes you need to add some hot sauce or something else...

A little bit time-consuming, but worth it. The flavor was good but there wasn't enough 'sauce.' I would make this again but double up on the horseradish/lemon/butter, and reserve half of it to pour over the spuds as they are served. Thanks, Teresa!

These potatoes were very good.  Was looking for something easy, but different.  This was a great choice.  I was surprised that the lemon wasn't overpowering.  I think next time I would broil them thought because I like my potatoes with more color.  I would definitely make these again.

Maybe because it was the day after Labor Day, I was looking for a recipe for red potatoes that wasn't potato salad.  I used larger ones than what you'd call "new" potatoes, so I cut them up into @ 1 inch pieces.  I made a little more sauce than the recipe called for, based on comments in other reviews.  The whole family LOVED them.  The only change I made is to melt the butter and make the sauce in a small saucepan.  I found that I couldn't put foil on the hot dish if I melted the butter in the dish I baked the potatoes in.  If you use a dish with its own lid, that may not be a problem.

very good and very forgiving.  I cooked a little slower in the oven because I had meat along side.  Very good flavor and wonderfully golden brown.  I would probably use a little more horseradish next time because my husband loves the flavor.

I bake these all the time with butter,salt,pepper and dry good seasons italian dressing mix. So i made it this way and added the lemon juice and horseradish. It really kicks it up a notch!!! We loved the horseradish!!! This will be my new recipe for new potatoes with my addition of the good seasons. Thanks Teresa! I make these at least once a week during the summer!

For those of you who don't like the lemon-horseradish flavoring (or don't have these ingredients on hand), simply leave them out and add some garlic powder and ground black pepper (to suit your taste) instead.  Sometimes I'll even substitute garlic salt for the regular salt if I'm really in the mood for garlic.  These are really easy and there are never any leftovers when I serve them at family get-togethers.  

If you dare -- Try doubling the sauce.  YUMMMMMM!!!

I thought these were good, but not spectacular.  I served them with swordfish and they went nicely together.  Next time I'll bake them at a slightly higher heat to try to get them a little crisper (and to shorten the cooking time).

When I started by making the sauce, I was very optimistic as it smelled so good!  I used cubed yukon golds & baked according to directions.  Unfortunately, they didn't taste as good as I'd hoped.  My husband even tried to ask politely, "What are these potatoes flavored with??" Maybe it would be better to roast potatoes normally & then mix with this sauce at the end?

I gave it a 4 star rating because I loved it, but hubby or kids wouldn't come near it.  They're not really fans of horseradish, but I can usually get them to at least try it.  I will make it again, but it will be one of those nights when I'm home alone...

I wasn't too sure about these potatoes, but was willing to give it a try and they turned out delicious.  I turned them a couple of times so they were nice brown and crispy.  There was not one scrap left after our dinner.  We will certainly have this recipe many more times.

Outstanding flavor.  However, the next time I make this I will cut up the potatoes as I baked them whole and it took well over an hour.

Loved this side dish! I didn't have a lot of time, so I boiled the potatoes and poured the sauce over them after draining. Next time I will bake everything together. Anyone looking for a different potato recipe should try this!

WoW!  Terrific recipe and makes a wonderful side dish for steak on the grill.  Serve these potatoes with medium rare steak, tossed salad and full-bodied red wine and you'll have a menu fit for company.  My company raved with praise & begged for the recipe!

Loved this! I used horseradish sauce instead of horseradish, and that and the butter gave these a nice creamy flavor.

Really nice subtile flavour. I found that the cooking temp needed to be higher, at 60 min they were still really hard. I ended up cooking them for 80 min and they probably still could have used a few more min.

I doubled the recipe and added two tablespoons of honey to the sauce because I was afraid the lemon and horseradish flavor was going to be too acidic and possibly overwhelming.  I used steam in bag potatoes and cooked them halfway (according to package directions) in the microwave then finished them off in the oven for 30 minutes with the sauce mixture.   If anything, next time I will use more horseradish and may omit the honey, because despite the sauce tasting overpowering before cooking, it mellowed a lot during the baking process.

Good.  I followed other reviewer's advice and doubled sauce and cut potatoes in bite sized pieces for 30 minutes cooking time.  Would be good with beef dishes.

These are the best potatoes we've ever eaten. I used a 1.5 pound bag of tiny mixed yellow, red and blue (or purple)-skinned potatoes that were about 1" diameter. Did not have horseradish on hand, but I did have some creamy horseradish sauce with roasted garlic so I used that instead. They were absolutely delicious. Corey does not like potatoes, but he loved these. I love a recipe that is simple and easy and tastes fantastic.

I made this recipe exactly as written. My husband and I didn't care for the lemon flavor. It somehow didn't seem to "go" with the horseradish and butter flavors, or maybe we just didn't like the lemon on potatoes. Next time I think I'll leave out the lemon juice and shake some parmesan cheese into the horseradish/butter mixture.

Served this to company tonight along with grilled filet mignon with an herb rub and roasted haricots vert.  The potatoes were excellent!  Made the recipe as written and stirred the potatoes after 30 min to be sure the butter/horseradish/lemon sauce was covering all the potatoes.  Got rave reviews from our guests, and it's really tasty!  I will make this again.  

It's an easy recipe and really delicious!

These are awesome!  My go-to potato dish for Easter since none of the family likes scalloped.  I have made this with horseradish as the recipe calls for, and have also used horseradish sauce which is a little milder.  Both turned out perfectly.

Normally I make rosemary roasted potatoes so I thought this might be interesting. I made a double recipe of the sauce for 3 lb of chunked red potatoes and slathered them before roasting. There was a hint of lemon fragrance while cooking. When I tried them they tasted liked plain roasted potatoes. So I squeezed 1/4 cup of lemon juice and upped the sauce recipe to stay true. I coated the potatoes and returned them to roast another 15 minutes. All the sauce soaked in but the taste was still too mild to overtake the roasted potato flavor. I was surprised the horseradish and lemon was nice but the flavor was too subtle. Everyone at dinner party ate the potatoes but thought they were just plain. No one was offended but no one raved.

These are great, but in the bottom of your dish, place skinless,
boneless Chicken Breasts, cover and cook for 1 hour on 350. You can also cut up some Zucchini squash and mix with the potatoes and it is delicious. Place Potatoes and squash on top of chicken breasts, cover and bake 1 hour.

Great way to prepare potatoes. Like some other commentors, I cut the potatoes in quarters before baking - however it still needed about an hour to cook. It could have used more flavoring - Next time I'm going to use less butter and more horseradish/lemon.

Needed way more of everything to add flavor.  Very bland.

This is a good recipe to double or triple to feed a crowd.  I use unpeeled red potatoes to save money and uncover the dish after 30 minutes to brown the potatoes.  Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious.  I brought these to a potluck and they were highly complimented.  I ended up using red potatoes cut into quarters because I didn't have new potatoes and I added more horseradish, just becasue I like more spice.  Turned out great.

Steamed the quarter-cut potatoes (much faster) and put the sauce over green beans too. Delicious!!

These potatoes were pretty good!  They had a nice hint of lemon and horseradish to them that gave them a nice fresh flavor.  I may next time put in a little more horseradish to give them more of a kick.  I didnt cover them since I wanted these to get nice and browned and crispy.  I cooked them a little longer than an hour and they were perfect.  I sprinkled fresh parsley over them when done.  These would be good with some fresh thyme or rosemary added also.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make again!

I used red potatoes that were not 'small.'  So, thinking this was only covering the outside of larger potatoes, I finally cut them into quarters or smaller halfway through cooking.  This allowed the sauce to get more "into" the potatoes.  I agree the horseradish didn't come through very well, but that is OK since I wasn't sure what I thought of horseradish with potatoes anyway.  I thought they were good.  I like potatoes and make them "herby" a lot (rosemary, etc), so this was something a bit different than my usual.
EDIT 9/13/11: Just made these again and decided to up them to a 5.  These are actually very good.  Again I didn't notice the horseradish, and the lemon is subtle, but the mixture does give them a nice subtle tang to them.  (I just noticed many wanting these crispy.  I for one love them soft cause they're more "melt in your mouth.")

This was good, but it didn't give the horseradish flavor I was expecting.  I still liked it, but would have liked more "bite" to the horseradish.  I guess cooking the horseradish mellows it.

So delicious!  I actually used a pound of wax beans instead of potatoes (less carbs) and kept everything else exactly the same.  This couldn't have been any easier, I just melted the butter on the cookie sheet and mixed everything else into it!

Great side dish--I'll probably add a bit more horseradish and some garlic next time.  It was perfect with slow-cooked pork and steamed broccoli.

I doubled the ingredients for the sauce as suggested by other reviewers. Also used Butter Buds instead of butter and I have to say, we couldn't tell the difference. I would increase the horseradish as there needed to be more tang if the dish was touting horseradish. Will definately be in my favorites folder!

The lemon really overpowered these potatoes.  We eat horseradish on sandwiches so we are use to the heat.  I doubt I will make these again but if I did I would cut the lemon down.

Per other reviewers I doubled the sauce, but alas, they were too tangy for anyone to enjoy. We all made puckered faces. Nice idea; thanks for the post.

Nice as side dish!  The potatoes need to be stirred half way through.  I'd also recommend baking uncovered the last 15-20 mins.

Followed the recipe to a "T" but was in a hurry, (crock pot had already been going for 8 hrs) & decided to do this recipe in the microwave. Came out 'ok' but I'm sure that had I done them in the oven like the recipe says - they would have been a "4". Next time I'll time it better.

A nice use for horseradish other than cocktail sauce. My husband and I loved these. I boiled for 20 minutes and then baked for an hour with the sauce. The potatoes turned out so soft and flavorful!

This sauce is awesome, since I love lemon and horseradish.  I've made this the long way and made the sauce separate to eat with boiled potatoes. Excellent!

needed a quick side dish last minute and this was fantastic! Of course it has butter so it has to be good. But the flavors turn out so nice after being in the oven for an hour. Had everything on hand so that also made it a no brainer.

I sliced approximately six small Russet potatoes and cooked them at 350 degrees for the first half hour and then at 400 degrees for the last half hour (stirring them about every 10 minutes).  I added an extra tablespoon each of butter, horseradish and lemon juice (unfortunately, not fresh lemon juice).  I also added minced garlic (about two cloves), a quarter teaspoon of hot sauce and used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  I thought they tasted pretty good (with just enough of a spicy flavor).  My husband rated them as a four and said he would only give a five rating to mashed potato recipes.

Really great recipe, although the potatoes were a bit dry (nothing a little more butter couldn't fix!). I served these with Seared Tuna Steaks with Wasabi Butter Sauce (from this site) and the two were a perfect compliment. The horseradish becomes much more mild when cooked. Delish!

These potatoes were very good!  I am always looking for new ways to make potatoes and these will be a new favorite.  An added bonus is the fact that they are so easy to make.  Try it, you'll like it!

These were awesome. I served them for a dinner party and everyone raved about them, including my mom who is an incredible cook. She actually asked ME for a recipe! I added three cloves of garlic and a little extra horseradish and it was perfect. I also used red potatoes because that is all I had. Great recipe.

Very very good! I, like the other reviewers, was pleasantly surprised to find that the horseradish did not overpower the potatoes. My only suggestion would be to make a few less potatoes so that they will be more coated with the sauce. My family really liked it I plan on keeping this recipe for the future. Thanks Teresa!

Very tasty - the horseradish was not overpowering at all and the flavours blended really well.  If anything, I would cut back on the butter a bit.  I added fresh chives from my garden just before serving.  Thumbs up all around the table!

Holy cow, these were fantastic.  I used horseradish sauce in place of the prepared horseradish because that is what I had on hand.  I boiled the potatoes and topped with the sauce, these will be a new favorite and went perfectly with my prime rib roast!

As other reviewers stated - the cooking time on this recipe is off - I too cooked mine a bit in the micro before putting it in the oven and listened to other reviewers who added garlic and onion.  Took another 45 min. to cook, with a lot of watching and the end result was just so-so.  We ate it but I won't be making this again.

Easy and quick.  I too omitted the butter and just sprayed the pan with butter cooking spray.  Still missing something though to make it 5 star... something to balance the horseradish maybe?

Good flavor.  Baked the (cubed) potatoes for an hour and still weren't completely done.  Added chopped onion & 3 cloves garlic (minced).  I stirred the potatoes every 15 min.

Surprisingly very tasty.  I didn't have Prepared Horseradish on hand so I used Horseradish Sauce instead, just added a little more than what recipe called for.  It turned out wonderful....my husband and I loved the flavor.  I will now try with the Prepared Horseradish which I bought.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks.

I liked this recipe, and I am a big fan of horseradish.  I am always looking for new ways to cook potatos and this one is good. If you don't like horseradish you will not like this dish.  I would make again, with maybe a little more sauce to add more flavor.

This was a really great change from the hum-drum potato side dish.  I used several sprays of "I can't believe it's not butter" and omitted the butter.  Its very tangy, but could use a little more heat for us.

I used red potaotes cut into chunks, and broiled after one hour to crisp them up a bit.
Very tasty, although my kids would'nt touch them.

This recipe was quick and easy to make.  The potaotes have a tangy flavor, and were not liked by one adult member of the family.  However, I found them to be delicious.

Oh, my, THAT was wonderful!  I parboiled the potatoes 5 minutes, added two bell peppers cut into 1" squares.  To the sauce, I added half a HEAD of roasted garlic cloves, mashed, and used 2T olive oil instead of 4T butter.  Baked uncovered.  WOW!

Very easy to make. Used a little more horseradish in mine only because I wanted a little more bite. Great change from plain old. Went great with leftover prime rib.

My fussy hubby even liked these. I par cooked the potatoes in the microwave (2 minutes on each side), cut them in half then put them in the sauce in the refrigerator until dinnertime. I placed them cut side down on a cookie sheet. They cooked and were crispy in about 15 minutes at 425 degrees.

I made this following the recipe exactly as written and did microwave the cut potatoes a bit prior to putting them in the oven.  I wish I would have made extra sauce because a lot of it evaporated during the baking.  The lemon/horseradish mixture was great on the new potatoes and it was a very welcome break from the way we usually cook them.  I thought the lemon flavor was a bit  strong but certainly not overpowering.  The baking  lessened the harshness of the horseradish so those of you who might shy away from this recipe because of that don't worry.  All in all it was pretty darn good and a definite keeper.

I was not impressed by this dish and I don't think that I will make it again.  For my tastes, there was definitely too much lemon and all that butter just made them greasy.

Except for cooking the potatoes on the stove top, I followed this recipe exactly.  Even if that was why they were too greasy and lemony for me, I simply didn't like this recipe.  IMO, Those flavors don't belong on potatoes.

I made it both in the oven as recommended and by boiling the potatoes first.  Both are good but I think I like the boiled one best.  Great recipe!

3 stars as published as it would have been much too bland, 5 stars with my changes. I doubled the horseradish and lemon to 1/4 cup each and left the butter the same. I also increased the oven temperature to 425 per my previous experiences roasting potatoes, reading this recipe I knew they'd never cook in an hour at 350. I also left them uncovered, we prefer our potatoes with a little color and crisp. Overall a decent recipe with modification that lends itself well to customization.

The simplicity is deceiving! The flavor is certainly present without being overpowering. We served these nuggets with prime rib. And they won  a WOW ! We will definitely prepare them again as written.

The ingredients just sound wonderful together. As others suggested, I added a lot more horseradish and roasted them in the sauce, uncovered for a nice browning. I eyeballed the amount of sauce I used for the amount of tatters I used as some said theirs were a bit dry. I didn't have a problem. I poured a bit of sauce over them when plated but I was still wishing there was more of a horseradish taste; Hubs didn't even notice it. Hmmm, would try these again but up it even more!

Great, easy side dish as written.  Suggest buying the smallest potatoes or even fingerling potatoes to get all of that good sauce coated on every bite.

For us, I would reduce the lemon juice (pretty tarty) and increase the horseradish for more kick.

The potatoes were different, but very good!  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I made some changes, and the cooking time was off.  I increased the lemon juice and horseradish to 3 TBSP each.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular, and used a little more than 1/2 tsp (I like salt).  I also added some garlic powder and dried parsley.  My potatoes were very small, but I quartered them anyway.  I'm glad I did because 1 hour still was not long enough for the little potatoes.  I cooked them uncovered for about 1 hr 10 min, and put them under the broiler for about 3 minutes.  Very tasty, and I will definitely make again!

this was very good.. i halved the butter but used oil instead.. used the bottled lemon juice and upped it to 3 T's.. we only had russets in the house so just cubed those and baked away.. stirring half way through.. tried to put them in the broiler but was afraid of burning them so not for too long.. the horseradish was not very pronounced at the end like i was hoping for.. either way they were still delicious.. ty for the recipe

easy to make, and looked great on the platter, but the lemon was too tangy for us...used small Yukon gold potatoes, and cut them in half...probably won't make it again..

Great side dish!  We used half redskin and half yukon golds.  Personally, I think the redskins were better.

Very simple, and I like the flavor something to change up the same old potato, but next time I will add more horseradish because we didn't taste it much!

I just made this without knowing that someone put it to paper.  Also they have a hot horseradish sauce that I just love.  I did it all in the microwave in 9 minutes, because I was hungry.

During our dinner, we kept spontaneously exclaiming "I love these potatoes!"  "These potatoes are so good!"  Definitely a keeper.  I made them according to the recipe, except that I uncovered them for the last 15 minutes or so.  These will be a staple in my house, and I bet there are a million variations you can use with the basic recipe.

Excellent recipe!  The sauce is just wonderful.  I think next time I will quarter the potatos so that I can get more sauce on them.  Recommend doubling the sauce.  We had this as our side with a beef tenderloin roast for Christmas and it was fantastic.  Thank you!

My husband loved this and I thought it was pretty good too. I pounded and seasoned chicken and did not bother to cook in skillet. I pre cooked bacon and little and sauteed some onions in the bacon grease and added cheese the last 5 minutes. I will make this exactly the same way regularly.

Had to use red potatoes, but the sauce still made this a really outstanding dish.
2-6-13: Used baby reds.  Very, very good.

This was so incredibly good.   I didn't have the full hour, so I parboiled first and then baked them for about a 1/2 hour.  Everyone at the table raved and there wasn't a scrap left.

I was hoping for more a prominent horseradish flavor, but it just seemed to mellow out during baking.  This was an OK potato dish, but not spectacular (and that's OK, since it's  simple to put together).  If I make again, I definitely will uncover for 15 minutes or so.  Browned/crisped potatoes certainly would be more eye-appealing.

I've never left a bad review but these just weren't very good.  The butter separated from the other ingredients.  It seemed like it needed something to bind together the sauce.  The horseradish and lemon just didn't go together for us.

Sooo good!  I thinly sliced Idaho potatoes, added 3 cloves of pressed garlic and increased the horseradish to 3-4 T.  Cooked for 30 monutes at 350 for 30 minutes, and slowly increased the temp to 400 for 30 minutes then let it cook for 10 more minutes uncovered and stirred it every 20 minutes or so.  Gave the potatoes a nice thin brown crust.  Served w/ spare ribs rubbed with horseradish and spices (cooked w/ the potatoes) (put the rub on in the morning and wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for 7-8 hours before cooking.). My new favorite potato recipe!!

* You can also boil the potatoes for 10 minutes and then finish in the oven to roast to save time.

Taste like potatoes with lemon squezed on them.  Would have been alot easier.  We could just barely taste the horseradish.

I would have to agree that these were nothing spectacular but that's not a bad thing! This is a good basic recipe that puts a twist on regular roasted potatoes. It would be nice to find a way to have the horseradish flavor come through a wee bit more.

This is a very good, but not amazing recipe.  I served these potatoes with the marinated flank steak recipe and it was a perfect flavor combination!  Everyone liked them, but no one was blown away by them.  I will definitely make them again.

All I can say is...YUM!  Made this because I was home sick and didn't have many groceries, it was a fantastic surprise.  I'm not a huge fan of horseradish on its own but it's a winner in this combination!

I give this 4 stars because we love any baked or roasted potato dish, but as other reviews have noted, the horseradish really didn't stand out. Maybe subtle flavor is the intent, but I'd prefer a bit more. I used Yukon golds because that's what I had, and after an hour they still weren't done, so I removed the foil, bumped the temp up to 425, and roasted for another 15 min, and they came out great. I also used olive oil. Good dish, but probably not a keeper; I have other recipes I like better.

These were really delicious! I steamed red potatoes while I melted everything else together in the oven. Then I tossed it together and baked - uncovered - for 30 minutes, re-stirring every 10 minutes. The horseradish really mellows out when it's cooked, so I added a bit more during the last 10 minutes for a little extra zip.

these were SUPER yummy.  Add A LOT more horseradish so it comes thru.  The flavor is there, but the bite is mellowed.  You might want to make extra sauce, too, so all the potatoes soak it up.  I sliced the potatoes and baked it all in a small casserole dish.

This was really tasty.  I did not have any oil, so I used 3 scoops of veganaise mixed with water.  I cut the potatoes up and mixed them with thinly sliced onions--like an au gratin.  I tasted the liquid mix prior to adding and I put in more horseradish than recipe called for and wish I had added more. Doubled sauce.

Delicious & robust!  I used idaho russet potatoes that I had on hand - which I peeled and chopped. I added some fresh chopped parsley before serving. I was concerned that the horsradish would be too strong/spicy for the kids. That was not the case!  The horseradish was mild and just added a good "kick"! I made these potatoes to accompany roasted chicken & baby carrots. It was the perfect addition!

Wow!  These were surprisingly delicious!  I'm not a big fan of horseradish, but my husband is.  I made these for him, but I LOVED them. They had a zip to them from the lemon horseradish combo that really lit up an ordinary meal!  Will be making these often!

These were absolutely awesome!  We love horseradish and lemom and were surprised at how delicious and mellow the flavors became after baking.  I often spread potatoes onto a baking sheet with olive oil and various mixes of spices.  I think I'll try this mix to see how it turns out.  We like crisp potatoes but don't like to fry.  Definitely will make again!

Yum! Very tasty! I did make a couple changes - used a little olive oil instead of the butter and added a heaping teaspoon of dijon mustard, as I think it goes so well with lemon and horsereadish.

I mixed all of the dressing in a bowl before I added the new potatoes, which I had quartered. I also added an extra tablespoon of horseradish. If I make this again, I'll decrease the amount of butter, I think it had a little too much.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I've made it multiple times for special occasions (and ordinary occasions) and it never fails to collect compliments.  Don't be afraid of the horseradish.  There is really only a hint of flavor and it's not overwhelming or overbearing at all.

I use regular sized yukon gold potatoes and chop them into 1/4ths or 1/8th, depending on size.  I do usually need to cook them for 90 minutes instead of 60 to make sure all the potatoes are soft.  I've never had a problem with  the sauce burning.

Special twist for potatoes. People who like horseradish really like this dish but also others. The next time I would use 1/3 less butter and a spoon more of horseradish.

The first time I followed the recipe as written (except I sliced the potatoes) & it was great.  So good in fact that I made it again a week later but used olive oil instead of butter in a effort to make it a tad healthier.  In my opinion it was just as good with the olive oil, so that's what I'll do from now on.

Loved this tangy side dish.  The potatoes were cooked to perfection.  I used potatoes that were called little gems. It is a mixture of white, red and purple (blue) potatoes.  I had never seen these before(Canadian product)  They were amazing!

Made these potatoes last night and thought they were good, but not wonderful.  My husband picked up spicy horseradish sauce at the grocery instead of regular.  I don't know if that really made a difference in the taste.  I took other's advice and par-boiled the potatoes first and baked them for half an hour.  I will try these again with regular horseradish sauce and not par-boil them first - that way I can fairly rate this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe.  Tasty.
I boiled the potatoes before baking to cut down on baking time. I also upped the amount of horseradish, lemon and salt. With those modifications, the recipe was very good!

Good but not great.  I would actually give these a 3-4.  I made these for company and they were so-so.  A few people commented that they were good and the rest didn't say anything.  I usually like to entertain with STELLAR recipes that get lots of compliments (who doesn't?)!  I may make these again for a quick and fast potato but won't do for company.

These were a nice change to regular butter and garlic potatoes.  I added and extra TBSP of horseradish like others suggested, and doubled the lemon, because we love lemon.  These weren't the kids favorite, because they don't like horseradish, but my husband and I enjoyed them.  I'll make them again.  Thanks!

I did several suggestions offered in previous reviews of this recipe. (Sliced and quartered the potatoes, increased the horseradish an additional Tablespoon and increased the pepper by several grinds) There was little to no taste and the potatoes took WELL over an hour to bake.  Sorry, but this one wasn't worth that kind of time.

Very yummy.  Disagree with the gal who cooked 1/2 hour at 400..the sauce got sort of black.  350 for 45 was good for my little yukon gold. Basted again 1/2 thru and 1 and 1/2 timed the sauce.

These were quite good, something a little different for a change, very nice along side roasted pork tenderloin. Will make again, thanks!

Good recipe.  I used bottled lemon juice, so the flavor wasn't as stong, but still good.  I'll use fresh next time.  I also used Yukon Gold potatoes- they worked fine.

I really enjoyed these. I followed recipe exactly but didn't use as many potatoes as some said there wasn't enough sauce. The lemon and horseradish were not overpowering but had great subtle flavor, the potatoes turned out golden brown and buttery, I was really impressed with this recipe.  I give it a 5, the bf gave it a 3, he said it was too bland.  I thought it was the perfect blend of a little spicy, a little tangy, and buttery.  Yum!

Read that a reviewer's small children liked these potatoes so dared make them for my husband.  He loved them, told him later they contained horseradish or he might not have tried them.  Will definitely make again.

I tried this recipes with the potatoes and it was excellent.   The next night we had chicken for dinner and used the same sauce, pouring it over the chicken at the end.

The only thing I changed in the sauce was I used less butter (margarine), next time I will try vegetable broth in place of the butter.

I'm not quite sure how I feel about this recipe. The potatoes didn't have that much flavor. I might try it again and make less potatoes so they can get more coated.

Very tasty taters. The horseradish gives it a nice kick but doesn't over power. Will make again.

This was delicious. I was surprised that the horseradish did not overpower the dish.For general information, the sauce separated in the oven and lost some of its zing.  I will just heat it thoroughly next time and pour it over roasted potatoes.

These are really good. Not my ultimate favorite, but it got great reviews from my family and the tanginess of the lemon/horseradish combo, really livens it up. I used baby purple potatoes and it was wonderful.

These are wonderful !!  I sliced the new potatoes, as they were a bit large.  Then I layered them with the sauce and baked as directed.  Great side dish with roast chicken...can't wait to make during BBQ season.  Thank you!!

excellent.   seems like the horeradish would be overbearing, but it blends perfectly!
