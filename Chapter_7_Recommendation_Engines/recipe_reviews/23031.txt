We always make these as a treat for the kids and adults too.  I make them on the stovetop in a big soup pan and fill the bottom with water, then spoon the mixture over the apples every once in a while.

I really liked this one. My vote is to not leave out the red hots...It's like an inside-out candy apple. Tasty.

I wasn't sure this would turn out so well without the butter, but I didn't have any and this was just about the only baked apple recipe that didn't call for it.  I left out the red hots and this was wonderful!

I'm Sorry, but here I go again, lol.  HOW CAN YOU RATE A RECIPE YOU DIDN'T MAKE?????? The recipe is for RED HOT baked Apples.  They call for redhots.  It's in the title.  I don't get it, lol Anyway, outstanding recipe, sure to be a long time favorite in my house, lol!

Nice recipe, I also added about 1/4C. of raisins, it adds a little more flavor.
I also placed a dab of butter on the brown sugar mixture before placing the top of apple back on. I covered with tin foil for first 20 minutes then removed tin foil for the rest of baking time.

Really good flavor! I liked the red hots and would add them again but I was disappointed that they didn't melt and make a nice cinnamon syrup like I thought they would. They did soften and were chewy though, which was still tasty. I'll make these again probably next fall :)

Awesome!  These were soooo good.  I used Jonamacs and these tasted just like my favorite treat(cinnamon candy apples) from the state fair.  The idea to leave the bottom when coring was great as it kept everything where it was supposed to be.  Even if you don't like red hots you really should try them because they totally make these special.  AND they are fat free.  :)

This is a great recipe.  It's very simple to make.  My grandmother used to make these for me when I was a kid and now I make them.  They go great served with vanilla ice cream.

I used Granny Smith Apples and added  a  1/4 pat of butter to each apple.  YUMMY!  This is the best baked apple recipe I've ever tried.  Now I'm thinking about making an apple pie and adding the cinnamon red hot candies.   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

My family LOVES this recipe just the way it is written.  I never change a thing about it and there are never any complaints or leftovers.  I can't imagine why you would want to change a thing about this recipe.  To each his own I guess.

I really liked this for dessert, especially since I've been trying to lighten up my meals lately.  I lightened this too by using Splenda brown sugar.

My Aunt used to make these every time I came to visit. I still make these and that has been 50+ years. An old standby, and still as good. Use Granny Smiths for holding the shape and contrast  between sweet and hot.

This is the way my mother and her mother made these, including the red hots.  I am not sure who my grandmother got it from, but her grandmother was German, so maybe there.

Ever notice how , often, the simplest things turn out the best?  Can't wait until tomorrow.  My granddaughters will be over, and I'll have these.  They love applesauce, so am sure these will be a totally awesome treat.  Don't think they have ever had them before..  rdavis013

I have been baking apples with red hots for over 40 yr. I also fry apples,make applesauce, & pop corn balls with red hots. 
Using them with the apples you do not need the cinnamon or brown sugar. The red hots add all the sweetness you need, also, adds the color red & makes them  very festive.
The pop corn balls are a tradition for Christmas & the very few times I haven't made them you can hear the groans of all my kids. They simply expect them no matter what. I also have  3 Granddaughters who come & help me make them so as to keep the tradition going.
They are the very best.

For a healthier, sugarfree, delicious, and very lazy option, cut out the stem of each apple, and insert 3-4 red hots only.  In a covered casserole, microwave 4-6 minutes.  The apple core becomes miniscule, once the apple is cooked, and is easily removed by diners at the table.

Excellent recipe.  For a colorful christmas side dish I place the apples on bright green lettuce leaves and fill the core center with crushed drained pineapple.  Everyone raves over them.

I made it with hot tamales instead of red hots. Great! But next time I would put both candies in the mixture. Braeburn apples took about 35 min but the granny smith took about 50 min.

i consulted this recipe looking to find out how much water to add to a recipe i made at camp years ago as a child. It's pretty similar. Core out leaving the bottom intact. Add 10 red hots. I added a sprinkling of cinnamon as mentioned in this recipe. decided to add 10 drops of water which is what this recipe IS missing.  Stuffed the top with a marshmellow which gives it a little more sweetness so no need to add sugar. Decided not to add the butter as I never did that at camp. Wrapped in foil. Placed in a bed of hot ashes. cook for 20 minutes, maybe more. Delicious!

I make mine in the micro.  I actually cook in mine.  Depending on the size of the Apple it takes aloud 4 -5 min.  I have always added the red cinnamon candies from the start cause I love cinnamon. You Can add whatever u like. Great this time of year!!  Try it you will like it!

These are awesome! Only made three but followed the recipe except I buttered the dish and put a teeny bit of apple juice in the bottom of the dish. Will most definitely make these again!

I generally am not a fan of baked appled, but this one was very good.  Only made 3 and we were wishing for more.

They were pretty good.  The kids loved them.  For some reason my apples kind of turned inside out during cooking...
