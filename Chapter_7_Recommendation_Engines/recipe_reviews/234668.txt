I forgot to add the maple syrup, and I still will say this is really good.  This may not look like your classic apple crisp, but it tastes every bit as good, and is so much simpler to make.  This would be a particularly nice dessert if you have unexpected guests drop in.  It just may be that my apple was a little small, but I would check the apple halves for doneness at 25 minutes (before adding granola), as mine did turn a bit mushy with a full 45 minutes of baking.  Caraloopy, for your first recipe, you’ve given us a winner!

I did not make this recipe a written. i was looking for a baked apple recipe that used granola. I used the idea of adding cream cheese to my baked apples (sliced). i served this to a ladies luncheon for 8 ladies. We all enjoyed the "sauce" that the cream cheese made in the apples.

Great recipe, Carolyn!  Easy to make, and delicious.  Since I didn't have any Allspice, I substituted Ginger and Cloves.  Because of the sweetness of the granola, I think I will use a little less brown sugar, next time.  Thanks for submitting!
