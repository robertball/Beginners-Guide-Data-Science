I am a gourmet cook. Unlike many I would never use/substitute lite calorie items. It just doesn't taste right and many low cal items are full of carcinogenics and junk to make them taste decent.. If you make something, make it right or don't make it at all. Worried about calories- eat a smaller portion. Life is not a play-you don't get more than one chance at it; there are no rehearsals. Enjoy things and don't sweat the small stuff!!!

I thought this recipe would likely give anyone a heart attack, so I fiddled around with it a bit. I used low fat sour cream instead of the heavy cream, and used light parmesan. It turned out delicious; my husband loved it, and he hates it when I "low fat" everything. Much healthier than the 62g of fat per serving! Thanks for the Fab recipe, Carol!
around with it

This was very good though I prefer to use fresh ingredients. I used fresh garlic (4 cloves), squeeze of lemon instead of lemon/pepper, 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. Rotini pasta for ease of eating and I think it 'catches' the sauce better. I also chopped up the chicken and the peppers for our kids. Used olive oil not butter. Very pretty when finished with the red and green peppers. Next time I will make a little roue after sauteing to help the sauce thicken. I used quite a bit more seasoning. In the end it was delicious.

When ten of us share our N.C. house rental for our yearly vacations, I always do all of the cooking and am constantly looking for meals that can feed a crowd. Well, this recipe certainly did the trick! I used evaporated skim milk in place of the heavy cream and penne in lieu of linguini. Everyone truly raved about this dish!

WOW! I made this last night and it was delicious, totally thought it tasted like I had ordered from a restaurant. Made a couple of changes. To cut the fat I didn't use the oil, and I used fat-free sour cream (only because I am lactose intolerant and can't handle cream) I can handle sour cream though and I used just less than a cup. It came out like a dream. I used Zatarain's creole spice and I went a little over board. My husband likes it spicy (I don't) but I kept eating anyways, because it tasted so good. Had no lemon pepper so used real lemon juice and then added cut up tomato and diced onion, and used minced garlic instead of powder. Also, cut the chicken into bite size pieces. I will definitely make this again! With just a little less spice. 
Thanks for a great recipe!!! Anna

Wonderful!!!  I omitted the butter and doubled the seasonings and used fat free cream.  The cream was a little thin for my taste.  I'll try to thicken it next time and see if that works.  In any event this dish had wonderful flavor and the colors looked very pretty on the plate.  This could easily be used as a vegetarian dish.  I'll definitely make this again.

Okay, this is my 2nd review.Of course it was fantastic the first time but I wanted to cut down the fat so we could have it as often we we wanted to! This time I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and thickened it w/ a little cornstarch. Worked great.I also used just green peppers, the others are so expensive! If I was going to make it for company, I would buy the red and yellow but for the family green is fine. I dont think the flavor suffers, and the kids push half of them to the side of their plates anyway! WE LOVE THIS, YUMMMMM

Excellent recipe - definitly restaurant taste to it. I didn't want to gain the restaurant weight though and used milk instead of cream. Was a bit watery but I didn't have cornstarch to try and thicken it.  Still, the taste was unbelievable! Will try the cornstarch next time.
Other changes I made - Diced the peppers and only used one green, used fresh garlic and mushrooms, olive oil instead of butter, and cut up chicken.

This was so good!  I made this last night because it was raining and we couldn't grill. I used Cajun Seasoning Mix from this site to season the chicken.  I doubled the amount of chicken and removed it when it was done cooking before adding the vegetables.  Peppers always seem to take longer to cook for some reason.  When it came to the sauce I used 2 cups of half and half and some sour cream and corn starch to thicken it and to make it a little less hot.  It was wonderful!  I tossed it with regular spaghetti and some parmesean cheese.

For the reviewers that thought the sauce is not thick enough instead of adding cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up throw in a handful of mozzerella it thickens the sauce up perfectly and adds to the flavor. This is a great recipe I have made it several times!!

Hands down, my favorite recipe on this sight.  The only thing that keeps me from making it much more often is the fat/calorie content.  I saute the chicken, remove from the pan, and slice into strips.  Then I put a mixture of butter and olive oil in the pan and saute the veggies (which I dice into cubes to make more appealing to the kids)in the great browned bits on the bottom of the pan.  Then I add the spices, the cream, and the sliced chicken back into the pan.  I let the mixture cook on low for 10-15 minutes so that the sauce will thicken, and also to allow the flavors to "marry".  Toss with the pasta and you are in absolute heaven!

Basically good, but needs adjusting.  I had three chicken breasts so sauteed in 3T butter (& used 1 1/2T cajun seasoning), which may be part of the reason the sauce was so thin.  It didn't need that extra butter.  Probably one, or one & a half tablespoons would be fine for two.  I went for half & half instead of heavy whipping cream (the other recipe with the EXACT SAME NAME - how confusing is THAT?!? -uses half & half).  That's another reason the sauce was so thin.  Although, other reviews (that used heavy whipping cream - & all the butter ... Hmmmm ...  :D) still needed to thicken.  I'll try cooking the chicken; then vegs; then removing & adding flour; then the cream or half & half.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but thin.  'Wasn't spicy enough for me.  It was "mild" on the scale of "mild, medium, hot, extra hot".  Something to remember, if you have leftovers, the sauce spices up overnight.  Still thin :), but spiced up.  :D  Fresh parmesan cheese is a must for great presentation.  That "powdered" stuff doesn't compare.

I made this last night for my husband and our best friends.  They RAVED over it!!  Went back for more!  I made a few changes, I used fresh squeezed lemon,fresh minced garlic, cut the peppers  into bite size pieces and used an italian blend of cheeses.  Oh, and to make it faster I bought butterball sandwich starters grilled chicken breast and cut them into bite size pieces, and covered the chicken with Zatarains Creole seasoning (lots of it if you like spicy). Cheese bread sticks and green salad compiment this meal, and a good blush wine would go good. It turned out wonderful!!!  Thanks for the recipe this is a keeper!!

Very, very good.  Hubby really enjoyed this, and he's very anti-creamy/cheesy anything.  I added some chicken broth along with the cream to give a little more flavor. I seared some chicken tenders sprinkled with old bay in a non-stick skillet and removed them when they were cooked through.  I added the veggies, sauteed them and deglazed my pan with about a 1/4 cup of white wine and then returned the meat to the pan.  I served this with thin spaghetti and garlic bread.  Great meal.  Thanks Carol

Wonderful recipe.  I don't know when the last time my husband had so many compliments.  I mixed sour cream with the pasta instead of using the heavy cream and topped it with the chicken and vegetables.  I used Paul Perdomme (?) poultry magic on the chicken and it was awesome.  I also used red, yellow and green pepper which made a great and colorful presentation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

YUM! I am only sad about not having mushrooms on hand because they would have made this pasta dish that much more delicious! We really enjoyed it. I love cajun chicken pasta and this recipe is just as good as some I've had in restaurants. For good cajun chicken pasta, you just have to ignore the calories and do some sit-ups in the morning. ;) Thanks for a heavenly, indulgent, spot-on meal. Will definitely be making this one again!

This was one of the easiest tastiest pasta recipes I have ever made! This was so good. I did change it just a little bit. I cut my chicken into strips before putting Tony's on it. I also used more Tony's because we like things with a kick. I used fresh garlic instead of powder and used double the amount of lemon pepper and basil. I also added a dash of cayenne for a little more fire. I also added a couple tsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. I served this topped with parmesan, fresh diced tomato, and chopped green onion. I have made this with chicken and have also made it with Italian sausage. Both ways were to die for! Thank you for a super easy and mouth watering recipe tha is sure to become a household regular!!!

**UPDATE: This is in my TOP FIVE favorite recipes on this site!!! I make it on a regular basis now.**
     I love this recipe! It is so different from anything that I have made and yet it is now a new staple in my family.  I did not change anything since I wanted to try it first the way it was written, though I couldn't find Cajun seasoning anywhere -- so I took the advice of another reviewer and purchased Creole seasoning. Oh, and I only had fettuccini pasta so I used that instead. This is so yummy and has the perfect amount of flavor. I will actually be making this again tonight since I have had several requests from my husband recently.  Thanks oodles for this recipe!

A consistent family favorite!! The only thing I change is adding in extra cajun seasoning and putting parmesan cheese in while everything is simmering together to thicken the sauce. Delicious!

Excellent!  It's easy easy to customize with your favorite veggies.  The pasta doesn't need any extra salt, because the cheese and cajun seasoning is already salty.  Also, there only needs to be one chicken breast and bell pepper, unless you want to double the pasta.  Instead of adding cream, I tossed the pasta with enough olive oil so it didn't stick.  It was a lot healthier and still tasted great.

Excellent! Made a couple changes...made 8 servings...used 2 pounds boneless chicken breasted cut into bite size pieces, shook in zip lock bag with 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons of cajun seasonings. Melted 2 tablespoons of low fat butter and cooked chicken over medium heat for about 7 minutes. Removed chicken to bowl so it wouldn't dry out. Melted 2 more tablespoons of low fat butter on same pan, sauteed 16 ounces of fresh sliced mushrooms, 12 ounces of frozen chopped green and red pepper and 10 ounces of frozen chopped onion. Cooked until mushrooms were soft then added all the other seasonings from the original recipe. Used 1/2 cup of light cream and 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Heated through then added the chicken for a few more minutes on low. Mixed in 1 pound of cooled bow ties pasta. Mixed in some grated parmesan cheese.

This is great!!! I used a bag of frozen red, green and yellow bell peppers. Cooked the same way/time as this recipe directs. Didn't have heavy cream so used low fat sour cream. This is will defiantly be a regular meal I make.

Delicious!! I doubled the recipe. I had to omit the mushrooms(frowns) because I'm the only one that likes them. Also only green pepper because it's cheaper. I aIso added a pinch of red pepper flakes. I didn't really measure the ingredients but it still came out excellent. Will for sure make this one again

Pretty good, but Ive tried a better recipe before. Just couldnt find that recipe so I followed this one pretty closely, and changed some stuff bc I just didnt have the ingredient on hand.
I sauteed an onion and some minced garlic in olive oil, then added chopped up mushrooms and bell peppers. to that i added pre cooked shrimp ( w cajun seasoning on them). I also flavored the veggies w cajun seasoning, salt, garlic, and black pepper. To this I added non fat Greek yogurt instead of cream ( small container). Then i added bowtie pasta, and it turned out quite well.

Really tasty!  Very creamy and flavorful. I went crazy and added some sliced andouille sausage. Also substituted one cup heavy cream for a cup of milk with a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed in.  I like the crunch/color/and flavor of uncooked green onions too, so I left them out of the cooking pan, and sprinkled them on top of the pasta before serving.
What wasn't eaten at dinner was happily taken to work for lunch.

Loved this. I think next time I may sprinkle the cajun seasoning on as it is cooking as it was a bit strong for my taste. I used less green  pepper since my daughter would just pick it out anyhow. After cooking the chicken I cut it in bite size pieces and mixed it all together to spread it out a bit more,But thought it was wonderful and will definitely make it again.

OMG, this was excellent!  I substituted the heavy cream with 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Didn't have dried basil so I used italian seasoning, and no mushrooms so I added orange and yellow bell peppers.  I was pleased and so was the hubby!

I'm really surprised at the number of positive reviews for this.  The husband and I thought it was terrible.  For one, the timing was off.  Cooking the chicken first and then adding the veggies for a few minutes resulted in overdone chicken and underdone veggies. It also could have used more pasta for the amount of sauce. Both of these could easily be adjusted, though. The real issue was the sauce. It was so plain!  Cream with some dried seasoning - that's it.  No layers to it at all. Won't be making this again.

This was excellent.  Made as prescribed, substituted evaporated milk for the cream.  Great texture, not at all too spicy.  Will definitely make again.

One of my favorite dishes! This meal is perfect. I didn't have the cream, so I used one cup of evaporated milk, and I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used 1/2 tea of lemon juice. I used 1 tea spoon of cornstarch to thicken. Very very tasty. Also, I used 1 and 1 half tablespoons of Cajun seasoning, and 4 cloves of garlic. Delicious!

This was very good, although I modified it to a more low fat version.  Instead of using heavy whipping cream, I opted for skim milk.  Then, I thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I also found that it needed quite a bit more cajun seasoning for our liking, so I added that as well.  Oh, and I chopped the peppers and chicken.

Very good!!

This recipe was so delicious and easy.  The flavor shocked us all considering how little cajun seasoning you use.  Very yummy!  We couldn't wait to eat it for leftovers.   I would only recommend adding more mushrooms.  Other than that it is great!

This had a great taste, but it was not creamy enough, even tho I added about a 1/4 more cream than it called for. next time I will adjust some more to make it creamier. but over all a great recipe.

Great dish! I always make the same 3 or so pasta dishes, so I gave this a try! I generally follow the tweaks in the reviews when trying new recipes, so I doubled up on the seasoning, used real garlic and lemon juice, and only had red and yellow peppers so I omitted the green one.  This was delicious! However, when I remake it, I will NOT double on the seasoning again! It was a tiny bit too hot for me, but not inedible! Also, I used rotini pasta.  Thank you for this!

Very good! I did not use mushrooms or green peppers because of personal preference. I also ended up having to cut my chicken into strips after 8 minutes in the skillet to speed up the cooking process. If I hadn't of done that it would have taken forever to cook.

This was delicious! I made it with fat free sour cream rather than the heavy cream and 1/2 the butter, to cut the calories a little bit and it was still amazing. I also added a little extra cajun seasononing to kick up the spice. Highly recommended.

Hi. Excellent recipe ... I judge recipes on how easy thay are to follow ... I enjoyed the preparation process despite being new to the cooking arena.  I was a bit concerned that the butter and cream might make this dish somewhat heavy... but ..no ! ... it imparted a light touch to the Creole / Cajun spiced flavours, making them subtle rather than 'in your face' spicey.  Used Creole seasoning ... Being a Brit, I thought that Cajun and Creole were the same thing..... should never have mentioned this to my partner, a Yankee (from NYC) Imperialist, who has lived in New Orleans ad allegedly knows the difference.   Ho Hum ... next time I shall keep my mouth shut !!

I mixed this recipe with "Peppered Bacon and Tomato Linguine" by dalgal. The two together made the most wonderful dish imaginable. My husband said I totally outdid myself this time.  Looking back at both recipes I just realized I forgot to add the parmesan cheese at the end. But no one seemed to mind.  lol

This is another one of my husband’s favorite dishes. Yes, it isn't the healthiest meal in the world but, it's worth a try! We double the sauce (b/c we LOVE saucy stuff) and the seasonings! If you think the sauce is a little watery...you can add a small amount of cornstarch until you get the consistency you want. I have also made it where I added broccoli and that was really good too (I steamed the broccoli ahead of time). 

LOVE IT!!

Wow.  Just wow.  I had a lot of things I wanted to tweak with this recipe, but I always follow the rules the first time (or so I try) so that my rating is based on the recipe and not my whim.

And wow.  This recipe is amazing.   I've now made it 5 times (in three weeks) and my family and extended family rave about it.  

The base recipe is awesome, but (you knew that was coming right?) I have found that buying a bag of frozen popcorn shrimp and scallops and throwing a handfull of each into each batch makes it SOOOOO much better.  

I personally like spicy food and this just doens't have much of a kick.  I add white pepper and crushed red to my portions.  My kids rave about this recipe as-is.  My wife and mother immediately declared this my best recipe.  Seriously folks... try it.

WOW!  This just might be my new favorite dish. Some changes I made: added a whole can (1.5 cups) of evaporated milk in place of the cream. I didn't have any lemon pepper. Also, as others have mentioned, add flour gradually to thicken.

My husband and I loved this dish.  Delectable!!
I took some of the other reviewers' advice and used evaporated milk (2% no less!) and added cornstarch to thicken.  My husband wants me to make this dish when we invite his family over for dinner next weekend.

This dish was so delicious!  I added cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce up which worked well. I also used 1/2 cup less cream but I found that there was still too much sauce.(The pasta was swimming in it)Overall great spicy flavor, definately a keeper!

This was really good.  I made a few changes to it.  I added Italian sausage, used a whole red pepper, used half and half instead of cream, and doubled the cajun spices.   I let the chicken sit in the spices for at least a half hour, and used penne pasta instead of linguine.  Delicious!!

I added some Tabasco to the sauce to perk it up a little bit.  I also found 2 cups of cream created too much liquid, try cutting the amount in half.  For a lighter alternative, mix 1 cup of cream with 1 cup of bouillion.  It is, all in all, a very tasty recipe!

We really liked this dish!  Thanks for the recipe!

Folks, if you want to use a different spice, or different amount, olive oil instead of butter, sour cream instead of whipping cream - then do it!  But don't complain in your review or post that you changed the entire recipe - that is just plain rude.  Post your own recipe online.

Cooking is personal.  Everyone tweaks a recipe to fit their tastes.

The best! Used fettuccini instead of linguini noodles. Also when you add the whipping cream to all those veggies and chicken there's nowhere in the pan to whip it up into a cream so I added a bit of cornstarch to get it creamy. Really really good recipe. I also used a lot more than 2 tsp of cajun seasoning.

We knew we wanted some Cajun chicken pasta but lately our favorite chain restaurants plays have left or taste buds less than satisfied. This recipe is now part of our households favorites. The only change is that we added a little more seasonings and pepper. If you come across this recipe don't pass it up! I wonder if I could use something else other than butter like olive oil to cut down on the calories. 5 stars

Family favorite!  I do cut the chicken up into cubes.  Sometimes, I use half and half instead of whipping cream.  Either way, very good.  This is what is requested when my older children come home for visits.

OMG, this is soooo good! I made it exactly as directed except that I omitted the green onions & used Zataran's Creole seasoning instead of Cajun seasoning for my taste. Also, when I was making the recipe, everything tasted so good until I added the parmesan cheese to the sauce mixture. Don't get me wrong, I love parmesan cheese but it changed the taste and consistency of the sauce especially after mixing it in with the pasta. It became chunky or broken (separated) instead of creamy like the sauce was before adding the cheese so next time I will just add the parmesan on top of my dish instead of mixing it in with the sauce. The thickness of the sauce is perfect using the heavy cream. It won't be the same substituting anything for this which is why other reviewers found it watery so if your gunna make this, you gotta do it all the way and you won't be sorry. AWESOME RECIPE!!!! Thx Carol

I also wanted to make this dish healthier so you need at least 2 cups of milk and 1/4 cup of corn starch instead of heavy cream. I also doubled the spices and added minced garlic and garlic salt. This dish was so tasty!!!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe and the only thing I would do different is omit the salt. The cajun seasoning I used had enough. Both my kids 21 & 17 LOVED it! I will make this again and it now has a permanent place in my recipe book! Thank you!

Great recipe, an instant favorite...I prefer all of the extra pieces to be cut smaller, but that will not change the flavor..even some of our oh so picky eating children really seemed to like this. Cant wait to have it again.

I used 1 cup of light sour cream.  Emerils Creole Seasoning and sprinkled all over diced pieces of chicken.   Added some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.  Very good, can't go wrong!

This tastes just like a dish served at a local restaurant that we used to order all the time...until we found this recipe.  My husband and I both love this.  I make it exactly as written except sometimes I leave out the red pepper when I can't bring myself to pay $2.50 for one...it's really better with it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Followed recipe to the letter and everyone thought it was pretty good.  Several did add salt or more parmesan cheese to amp up the flavor and I do think next time I will add some garlic and or a little more salt.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Carol!

Didn't have mushrooms.  The dish was great.  Everyone ate until they were stuffed, and I had enough sauce to add more noodles for leftovers.  I will be making this again for sure.

I made this using sourcream and added more peppers, everything else was the same.  Over all it was just ok.  Flavors were a little bland and the creaminess of sauce didn't sit well with the rest of the ingredients.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used chicken tenders and sprinkled the cajun seasoning on them rather than shaking them. I served it with whole wheat linguine and used red and yellow peppers. Delicious! The next time I make it I will add more mushrooms (as DH requested.)

This was excellent! I doubled the chicken  & pasta but kept all the other ingredient the same amount.   I used Evaporated Milk instead of Heavy Cream.  We don't like  mushrooms and did not have green onion so we left that out.  Instead of just butter to saute the chicken in I always use a little Olive Oil too, that way the butter doesn't burn, etc.  My Calories are as follows: Each Serving 506 cal.  19.5 Fat.  52 carb. 3.25 Fiber.  42 protein. I used penne instead of linguine, because its less messy. This dish was so fantastic!  It was made super fast and it was super easy.  We used Purdue Chicken Tenderloins instead of plain breast because it is just easier to work with and really has less fat, more nutritious, etc.  I did not have the Cajun Seasoning so I made it from the spices I had on hand from a recipe that I was told is here on Allrecipes.com.  Anyhow this dish is a winner and I will be making it again for company!  YUM!

I make this dish often and usually exactly as Carole intended. However tonite I had some left over roasted pumpkin. I cooked the dish to the recipe and sliced my pumpkin and heated the pumpkin in the microwave then layed it over the top of the completed dish. The sweetness from the pumpkin complemented the other ingredients beautifully. Thanks again Carole.

I've been making this for years and it's absolutely a hit every time.  We don't do mushrooms in our family, so I eliminated them and I saute thinly sliced red onion with the peppers instead of the green onion and it's fantastic.  Our dinner guests always say, "it's better than eating at a restaurant."  Also, I use chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts.

I love this recipe.  It's in regular rotation at my house.  I always lighten it up with milk and cornstarch to replace the heavy cream, and it's still great!

As I was making this, I became apprehensive that it would be as good as I'd hoped. As it turned out, I was very pleasantly surprised. The chicken had great flavor, the sauce was tasty, and the presentation was beautiful. I, too, substituted fat-free half-&-half and thickened with a bit of cornstarch. Hubby r-e-a-l-l-y liked this & ate the leftovers (I had made a double batch) later that night.

This was delicious! Next time I will cut back on the peppers, a bit too much for my family and I will add regular onion in addition to the green onion.  Right before I took it off the stove, I added a tsp of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and it came out the perfect consistency.  I will def. add this as a regular menu item.

This was very very good.  I did however change a few things.  I doubled everything except the chicken and bell peppers.  For the pasta, I used 1 pound versus 4 ounces.  This made the sauce very thin.  I then added 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with water.  It thickened up like a dream.  Next time I will add a bit of cayenne to perk it up.  We also like spicy food.  This yielded 4-6 servings instead of 2.  We like leftovers. :)

I thought this was tasty - added a little extra Tony Cachere's, though. Also added parmesan cheese to the cream sauce itself.

Pretty good! I took the advice of another review, and used 2% evaporated milk to cut the fat.  Very good idea, by the way. The bell peppers were a litte overcooked, but I can fix that problem next time. Husband and Mother-in-law liked it.

Very Good!I used fat free half and half plus a few Tbs. corn starch instead of cream and cooking spray instead of the butter.It tasted decadently rich with hardly any of the fat!I was very pleasantly surprised.Other than that the only changes I made were to use a pound of pasta and to double the sauce amount,oh,I also added more salt.I will definitely be making this one again!

Excellent flavor...when you change the directions a little.  You really only need two peppers, 1/2 lb of pasta, and 3 chicken breasts cut into strips.  You need to use alot (4 tablespoons at least)of cajun spice to coat all the chicken, which definitely makes the flavor excellent!  I also suggest cutting the cream down to 1 1/2 cups and putting the heat up to med-high with continuous stirring will thicken up the sauce.  Also, don't add the linguini to the sauce, ladel the sauce over the linguini when it's served.

I'm not sure if I did something incorrect, I tried doubling the recipe and the cream sauce was very milky.  I would have preferred a thicker white sauce. Disappointing.

I tried the recipe and found the liquid portion to be 'thin'. The overall flavor was definitely restaurant quality. I tried using a bit of starch to thicken the liquid but it didn't work. I need to work on this recipe a bit more to have a thicker sauce. Another thing that could 'possibly' be done is to use an alfredo sauce with the same seasonings...just an idea..

This is fantastic!  I do use a little more butter & cream than recipe calls for.  I buy the jar of hot whole sweet piquante peppers add about 6-8 of those plus I mince up a jalapeño. My husband & I like things spicy!  When I add the cream & spices to chicken & veggies I add a little juice from the jar of peppers plus I add a lot of grated cheese.  This is a great pasta reminds me of chicken Riggies!

We liked this recipe a lot. There is a great flavor. One thing I will say is that it is too salty. The lemon pepper has salt. You add salt. The Cajun seasoning has salt. I will omit the addition of salt in the future. Also, it helped me to remove the chicken and slick it to stir the pasta in.

I took the cue from another reviewer and used sour cream. The result was fabulous. It tasted a lot like the cream Philly cream cheese cooking sauces that - while delicious - sell for a lot more and probably have a lot of additives. Glad to have found this cheaper and healthier way to make it!

this recipe was great as is. However, I changed a few things (olive oil instead of margarine, less salt and more vegetables, and added shrimp) to make it "healthier". Over all, the family enjoyed it and are already asking when am I fixing this again! No leftovers-ha! Imagine that! :-)

This recipe was great! My husband LOVED it. I ended up using sour cream instead of heavy cream, which I wouldn't recommend because it made the sauce taste a little more sour than I would like. I also ended up using about twice as much of the seasonings as it calls for. If you season to taste, it can really come out delicious!

I LOVE this recipe! I kick up the Cajun seasoning a bit more (Tony's is the best!), use fresh garlic and lemon juice, and swap out the cream for sour cream and it is AMAZING! Use different noodles for better texture and sauce control. :-)

This was amazing. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've had ever. I used 4 tsp of Creole seasoning in place of the two tsp of Cajun seasoning. I used two tbsp of extra virgin olive oil in place of the butter to cook the chicken. I added some minced garlic to the chicken while it was cooking (maybe 3 cloves). I added the parmesan to the heavy cream also added 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce. My husband loved this, and he doesn't really like bell peppers. Thank you, Carol!

Rivals any I've had at any restaurant. I added an additional 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese to sauce as it was cooking. Extra rich...extra good! Next time will try shrimp instead of chicken:) Highly Recommend!!

OMG! This is fabulous.  Reminiscent of Emeril Lagasse's  New New Orleans Pasta but less work.  Something I'll be making often.  Didn't have m'rooms on hand, added more cheese  but otherwise followed recipe, only tripling it.  Yummy!
Extra note:  After having made this reciepe at least twice monthly, I now use bow tie pasta, cook it very al dente, and simmer in sauce for a few minutes.  Sauce it absorbed into bow ties and sauce becomes thicker and pasta even more flavorful.
Also good for those on a ketogenic diet only using zucchini noodles.

The flavor is definitely restaurant quality.  This recipe was awesome!  I did make some minor adjustments but used this as a base and it really impressed the family.  I added shrimp and a New Orleans sausage.  I used fat free half and half to lighten it up a bit. I also went along with some of the other comments and used fresh lemon juice and fresh garlic.

Delicious, we all loved it!! High-fat, maybe, but if you don't eat like this every day it certainly isn't gonna kill you. I wouldn't change a thing!

i've made this twice and everytime it was a hit. the first time i did it exactly like the recipe said then the second time i changed some things. insead of only using red and green pepers, i used red, green, and yellow bell peppers to add more color. i added more mushrooms, just because i didn't want them to go bad and made my own cajun seasoning.

Very good. I took the advice of another reviewer and used fresh lemon juice, pepper and garlic instead of packaged ingredients. I like heat so instead of using green pepper I used 2 jalapenos. Also needed more salt, and I tossed a bit of asiago cheese toward the end and let things simmer for a few minutes more than recommended to give all the flavors time. No chicken in mine but it was still great.

Try replacing half of the cream with coconut milk.  *Delicious*.  (Though that makes it a bit less Cajun and a bit more Thai.)

As others have suggested, you can get orange & yellow bell peppers too, for more color.

I have been using this site for years and this is my first review! I had to review this because it was awesome! I followed directions as stated and it was great. My husband hasn't came home to eat yet but I don't care! I love it, it's better than any cajun pasta dish I have had in any restaurant. I feel like I have to exercise later tonight but well worth it!

I substituted cubanelle peppers for the green peppers and added a can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos to give it an extra kick. This recipe is sure to please everyone at the table.

Great recipe...I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and chopped the red pepper into small pieces as well.  (I left out the green pepper.)  I used fat free half and half instead of cream.  I found the recipe makes more like four servings instead of two, which is nice since we'll have leftovers tomorrow.

My favorite Mexican restaurant makes something similar to this and I could not find a copycat of it to save my life. Until this one. I sliced the chicken because that's what they do at the restaurant, and I doubled everything except the chicken and spices. It was still very spicy, but very, very good. Will be making it again.

I used frozen red/green peppers, and light cream, which may have made a big difference in the final product...but I probably wouldn't make it again as it did not taste very cajun-y (like the restaurants) it was sort of bland.

This was good. We always like a little extra added spice, but did enjoy the blend of flavors in this dish. How can it go wrong? Chicken, cream, cheese, spices, and pasta? Yum!

Yum! We all loved it!! I followed the recipe very closely - but did use a can of evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream. the 'sauce' was perfect using that! Also we used 1lb w.w.penne pasta for four of us, and there was plenty of liquid for that much pasta (can of evap milk = 12oz vs the 8oz cream).  Also used more cajun seasoning (4tsp) for 2 large chicken breasts that I cubed. All else was as written, and we're definitely going to have this again!

I reduced the amount of fat by using half and half and thickening it a bit with cornstarch.  Any dish that uses this many bell peppers is sure to be a big hit!

Absolutely excellent! Went together really fast and the taste was wonderful! We left out anything that had the word "salt" in it since we're not big fans of salty tastes, and split the cream with sour cream but otherwise followed the recipe except for using more pasta. Excellent!! Will definitely make this again.

So good my husband will eat the entire  thing by himself. I did make it to a "T" the first time and we had company and they all asked for the recipe. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, time I have made it I use zucchini and yellow squash instead of peppers and it is just as amazing. LOVE IT

This is everything I look for in a dinner recipe. Simple, easy, tasty, and quick. I used chicken tenderloins, green peppers, and mushrooms. Subbed low-fat sour cream for the heavy cream to cut out the fat and it was delicious (sauce was still thick).

I'm an idiot. I read the amount for the cajun seasoning wrong and used two tbsp. instead of tsp. Jeez. I did double the vegetables, used a large yellow onion instead of one green and sauce ingredients using FF half-n-half and just a little spoonful of FF sour cream as I wanted to cut calories where I could and add in more veggies. I took other reviewers advice and made a roux from the butter and a little flour before adding the FF half-n-half. We all thought this was good, just freakin' hot. That'll teach me to rush through dinner. Don't make the mistake I did. TSP not TBSP.  It makes all the difference. Next time, I'll leave out the lemon pepper and use fresh garlic.

I though this recipe was only okay, although my boyfriend really liked it.  I added flour to thicken the sauce and used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I also added more cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.

I thought this was a great dish- a nice change of pace for a midweek meal. I loved the peppers in it too. I used fresh basil as this is what I had on hand and I'm glad because it was a bright addition.

A favourite!  This has now been entered into our bi-weekly meal plan for regular rotation! :)  I used the "Cajun Spice Mix" from this site and it was also fantastic (and makes it possible to alter the spice factor).

Great recipe, especially when you need something different. I made my own cajun spices (recipe from site) since I didn't have any on hand, went a little liberal with the red pepper flakes and it was almost too hot (my fault) I also used fat free half &half, husband loved it, will be making again!

This is very good.  We all loved it.  Recipe states that it makes 2 servings but, it makes alot more than that.  There were three of us and my husband even had seconds and there was still enough left for 2 people.  I will be making this again.

This was excellent!!  I spiced the chicken and then cut it into stips.  I also didn't have green onions on hand so I just diced about 1 cup of yellow onion and doubled all the spices very very yummy!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I changed this recipe quite a bit to lower the fat content and reduce the spiciness for my kids.  I used 1% milk with 1 tablespoon cornstarch whisked into it instead of the cream, and used cooking spray in place of butter.  I made my own Cajun seasoning using 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/8 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp paprika.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I squeezed some lemon juice into the sauce.  The whole family loved it!  This tastes like it came from a restaurant, and we will use it often!

This recipe was amazing! I'm 13 years old and I told I family I would cook tonight, so I finally chose this one. I got rave reviews from everybody, and it was noted "best meal I've made to date!" I think the sauce was the best part, my mom even drunk the sauce from her bowl! TIP: I made my own mix for the cajun spice ( celery salt, cumin, red pepper, paprika, chili powder). I am definitely going to make this recipe again!

I used sour cream instead of heavy cream and it tasted great.  I did have to cook it longer to soften the peppers to my liking.  I also added 2 wedges of Laughing Cow french onion cheese to the sauce which made it really creamy.

I was looking for a wow dinner and this was definitely it.  I doubled the recipe, used half and half and added some red pepper flakes.  At first the sauce looked a little runny but I let it sit for a few minutes with the pasta added and that was just long enough for it to thicken slightly.  Leftovers were wonderful, hubby said it was awesome!

Wow. It's just so very tasty.  Because I veered so far off the recipe I should tell you what I did so beginners can get in a comfort zone to make your own changes and still get great results. What's Cajun seasoning? I used Old Bay Blackening mix in the yellow tin.  I thinly sliced chicken, added my "cajun" mixed and tossed around in a hot pan glazed with tiny bit of oil.  In went a few thinly sliced red & yellow peppers.  In went a few globs of spicy brown mustard, and a couple shakes of Chili powder.  I wasn't sure about the cream but I did add just a few splashes of 1/2 and 1/2.  Then a handful of grated Almost forgot- I threw in 3 chopped scallions at the end, and extra black pepper.

We loved this!  I skipped the green onions (because I forgot them), used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and thickened with flour in the end.  A hearty, cozy and very flavorful meal with just a little kick!

This recipe is great, with a few changes. I use canned mushrooms, double the cajun seasonings, and add sliced sun dried tomatoes. I also slice up the chicken before cooking it and add the parmesan into the sauce. That will thicken it up! Use Tony Thatchers, it is the best cajun seasoning, just omit salt.

This recipe had way to much bell pepper. The first time i tried it, it was way to salty.  The second time i tried it, it was way to bland.  I should have subsituted thyme instead of lemon pepper. I wont try again.

This was great!  I also substituted a 1/2 cup of the heavy cream for white wine, then used 1 cup cream for the rest.  Perfect, and didn't take a long time to make, either.

This tasted divine! Instead of butter, I used olive oil & also squeezed the juice from a lemon instead of using lemon pepper seasoning. Loved the light creamy lemon flavor. It's a nice cool down from the cajun-coated chicken.

This is one of my favorites.  I used Emeril's cajun seasoning recipe for the spice and added shrimp to the recipe. Also I used a yellow pepper in place of the green, and added baby asparagus. With these additions, you basically get the Cajun Chicken Pasta from Bahamas Breeze  - only better!

This was an excellent recipe. I prepared this meal for my fiancé last night and he loved it. I made a few revisions such as adding crushed red pepper, cajun turkey sausage, and yellow peppers. He likes spicy dishes, but the spices were not too overwhelmingIt's an ideal meal for a large gathering. My fiancé really enjoyed the cajun turkey sausage addition.

I've had this recipe in my favorites file since 2002.  I do change things, like using less pepper, chopping it instead of slicing it, more mushrooms and onions, more cream, use shrimp and chicken, there are so many possibilities.  That is what makes this recipes part of my favorites.  It is great as is but is easily adaptable.

I doubled the recipe and the heavy cream was really watery.  Next time I might boil off the water from the peppers and if that doesn't work, might simmer the sauce to boil off some of the liquid.  Other than that, it was perfect as is.  Not too hot using the prescribed number of tbs for the cajun seasoning.

Very tasty. I added the parmesan cheese at the end to the sauce to thicken it up as well. We only used green peppers and tossed in some crab as well. It was very good and it is a keeper in our house. My husband has already requested that I make it again.

This is amazing. I like the sauce thicker, so I added some corn starch mixed with water. A tiny bit bland, so maybe I will add some Old Bay into it next time.

This was so good and easy to make.  I added some flour to the recipe and ended up adding quite a bit of milk, too, as I wanted more sauce.  I also doubled the cajun seasoning.  It was perfect!

This tasted wonderful, even though I substituted evaporated milk plus some flour for the heavy cream.  My husband and I both agreed that it tasted like something you'd get at a restaurant.  The ingredients are pretty inexpensive, and the preparation is not complicated.

Awesome recipe, there is just no other way to say it!

The spices are just right...Sauce is not thick but it coats the pasta well and isn't a problem. 

The only changes made were because of personal preference only...I had to leave out the mushrooms because my husband won't eat them....and I cut the chicken up into bite sized strips.

Thank you for a great recipe! I feel like I am dining in my favorite eatery when I serve this!

This is the first recipe I've made from this website and I have to say, I was pretty impressed. I took a lot of the suggestions from the reviews and added some special touches. I substituted penne for the linguine (I now have to make more pasta for the leftovers though). I also cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and coated it with a mixture of cornstarch and a lot of Emeril's Bayou Blast. I used olive oil instead of butter, 2 red bell peppers, a whole container of mushrooms, 2 scallions, 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, and a handful of fresh chopped basil. I omitted the lemon pepper. Half & Half worked well and I added 2 chopped plum tomatoes and some Romano cheese at the very end. I also had to add some salt and pepper and more Cajun spice for flavor. It was a very colorful, filling and tasty meal. Next time I want to try it with shrimp and andoiulle sausage.

I order this dish just about every chance I get whenever I go out to eat...I have to say....this is by far the best version of Cajun Chicken Pasta I've ever had. The balance between the different type of peppers and mushroom and the cajun seasoning was unbelievable.  The two teaspoon worth of cajun seasoning was perfect...wasn't too spicy but still had a good enough kick to the chicken.  I was overly impressed how much flavor the green and red bell peppers contributed to the dish as well as how well everything went together to make this yummy cream sauce...you have to try this!!!!

Yum!  I was looking for something similar to the Pasta New Orleans that is available at Fishbone's.  Not an exact match but this certainly gets you started.  Make extra, it definitely gets even better the next day.

I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  I also used seafood - shrimp and salmon instead of chicken.

This recipes is fantastic!  I followed it exactly except I didn't put any mushrooms in and I used jerk seasoning because I didn't have cajun.  It is delicious!

Yummy!  Being from Louisiana, I'm always hesitant to try anything that has "cajun" in the name, because it usually never measures up to my standards.  But this was REALLY good.  The heat level was just perfect.    For the cajun spice, I used Tony Chachere's, and I omitted the salt completely.  It was far better than the "cajun" pasta I've had in several chain restaurants.  My husband told me that of all the recipes from this site that I've prepared, this was his favorite.  Next time, I'm probably going to try adding shrimp.

This is a restuarant quality meal. Delicious, and great presentation.  The recipe is great as is, the only thing that needed changed was a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I used a little extra cajun seasoning-- it was still not very spicy... just perfect for pasta though!
I used half as much cream, as a personal preference.  I also diced the chicken.
Next time, I'll probably add tomatoes and use bow-tie pasta. 
My boyfriend always gets the cajun chicken pasta at Chili's, and says he thinks this is "VERY comparable" --he wanted to make sure I added that in here.

Very quick and very good. I used evaporated milk instead of the cream and also used only enough to make a nice sauce (therefore eliminating the runniness others experienced. It does thicken up the next day.) For a less spicy variation I use less Cajun seasoning. I added carrots and used regular onion instead of green onion.

Outstanding recipe. The whole family loved it, even the children. I added olive oil to the butter. I also drizzled olive oil with garlic powder and onion powder over the veggies while I cooked the chicken. I cut the chicken into strips before I cooked it. All of these modifications came from other reviewer's suggestions.

this was wonderful, I like cajun foods, that aren't to strong and this is just that, you can taste the cajun and it has somewhat of a kick, but it is not to over powering, the sauce is wonderful too! the only thing I would chance, is for my own preference, to cut the chicken into strips before serving. This is a great recipe everyone will love!

This is a very good recipe.It reminded me of a dish I used to order at The Old Spagetti Factory.It need a little more cajun spice then the recipe calls for and I let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes so it will thicken.

This was very good...but 1st I would like to give some advise that might help.  Make sure you add a little cajun spice to the bag at a time!  I dumped mine in at once and it came out really spicy/salty like (Louisiana's) which makes the sauce WAY TO bold!  Thank God I didnt add the extra salt!  So I had to dump out the sauce, TRY and wash some of the spice of the chicken off and start over again! :/ SO the next time around...I did NOT add the salt but did add extra garlic, crushed red peppers and the other suggested spices. After all that fuss It was very good! Just be aware of the cajun which already has salt in it, or you could have one salty dish.

Loved this! I had to double the recipe for my family of four but I still increased the linguini noodles to 12oz instead of just 8. Also, used a variety of bell pepper (red, green & yellow) and added a couple of good shakes of Old Bay to the chicken. I had to add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce but overall, an easy recipe to follow and very tasty! Great with garlic bread. Thanks Carol!

I make this recipe often.  The spices and peppers give it a great flavor.  I just changed my rating to 5 stars because of the versitility of the recipe.  I've made it with turkey kielbasa and shrimp now.

This is a favorite of ours.  Although, I do add 1 Tbsp. cajun seasoning and eliminate the salt.  I also add 1 chopped onion with the peppers.

Even a humble college student such as myself can manage this one.  I added zucchini and used regular onions instead of the green ones.  I also made the sauce with 1 1/2% milk (I'm in Germany, their milk's different!) thickened with a little roux.  It's maybe a little heavy, though.  Be sure to be hungry!

The chicken in this dish was good but the sauce was really blaw and runny.  I even added some cornstarch and water but it didn't help thicken it up. Won't be making it again.

The recipe was very good. The reason we rated it an overall 3 is because it is listed as cajun and it was not spicy as you would expect from the name. This one needs some adjusting to make it "cajun".

This recipe is in our standard rotation of weeknight meals. So easy and so tasty! My two cents on tweaking is to cook the chicken fully, then remove and slice. When cooking the veggies, add one more table spoon of butter and saute until the frond from the chicken is gone. Then add the cream, spices, and cheese.  And about the spices, I use my calibrated eye to add the spices, and if it's more than specified, well good on ya! Especially on the cajun seasoning!  After the sauce has thickened a bit, add the chicken and pasta and toss.  Simmer a minute or 2 more, and you are good to go!

By far my favorite recipe on here. Added a bit more Cajun seasoning because I love the flavor but otherwise didn't change a thing. Delicious!

I'm rating this AS-IS, rather then rating it after making 10 changes like most people do. 

The ingredients/flavor is great. However, the execution is off. 

1) The vegetables need more like 5-6 minutes, and the peppers should go in first as they take longer to cook.
2) Once the cream is in, I let mine cook for 9-10, rather then just heating through. This took care of the "too thin" problem. 
3) It also needs more cajun spicing (enough to thoroughly coat the chicken), as there's no way 2 tsp would coat 2 chicken breasts.
4) Try to use fresh ingredients if possible (i.e. a clove of garlic, 1-2 squeezed lemon slices, etc.)

With all that the flavor turned out great, but there wasn't all that much sauce.  I'd bump that up next time.

Absolutely fail-proof.  I used Large Tubeti pasta (instead of fettuccine) 1-1/2 cups  2% Low Fat milk instead of the heavy cream and 2 rounded tablespoons of cornstarch (dissolved in the cold milk) to thicken the sauce plus doubled the Cajun spice and a 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper.  Yum!  Picky eater husband had seconds and left overs the next day.  Can't get enough.  Quick, simple and delicious.  Can't beat those three things when it comes to a good dinner.

We loved this!! I'm not that much into spicy food so I used less Cajun and added some garlic and herb mix. I took the chicken out while I cooked the veggies and put the chicken back in after adding the cream and spices. I let it cook for another five minutes because my chicken was thick and it was perfect! Quick and easy!

It was a good recipe! Restaurant style like some of the other reviews stated. I did however make some adjustments since some of the other reviewers stated it was too thin and wasn't spicy enough (depending on your palate) I enjoy spicy food so I adjusted accordingly. I made double the recipe. First, I added half a package of cream cheese, 4 ounces of mascarpone and used half and half. Instead of garlic powder I used fresh garlic, I also added cayenne pepper to taste in the sauce. It still didn't make it thick enough, but will try a

Best pasta dish I ever had.  Followed instructions to the T and no regrets.  Was initially afraid that it might be a bit too spicy  but had just a hint of latent heat.    Letting the creme simmer for a bit also helped with the consistency when it got served.  Definitely moved to the top of the list...

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great!  The only thing is my family prefers our food to be rather spicy, so I started adding a little cayenne pepper to spice it up.  My kids love this so much they request it frequently.  It's quick and easy!

Really good! I doubled most seasonings (really!) and it was very tasty.  I also used chicken tenders and sliced them up.  My husband and I had leftovers for two additional dinners.  Freezes really well, to reheat I added a little milk and water to the pan and covered it for five minutes.

Excellent!!!  I used 1% milk instead of cream and it worked just fine, since I put the Parmesan into the mixture which helped thicken it a bit.  I left out the seasonings that were to be added at the end--except for the basil--since it was already spicy and salty enough.  Otherwise it's a winner and will be one of my regulars.

I added more seasoning than the recipe stated, and it was still so bland! I won't make it again.

Excellent!! I only changed some minor things: 1) I added more Cajun Seasoning (we like Spicy food!), 2) I added more mushrooms (4 just didn't seem like enough, we love mushrooms), 3) I used Cornstarch to thicken the sauce, and 4) I added extra Parmesan Cheese (We Love our Cheese!)... The creamy, cheesy sauce was a nice contrast to the spiciness of the dish.  It was Very Good, and it will become a regular in our household!

Delicious! The second time around I used regular yellow onion instead of green onion because the green onion was tasteless and it made the dish presentation look ugly!

Delicious meal. We made zucchini pasta (zoodles) instead of pasta and used a half a cup of sour cream and a half cup of Chardonnay instead of heavy cream. This added flavor and cut calories. We also chunked the chicken instead of keeping it a whole filet. It was amazing after we tweaked.

With a few changes, this Cajun recipe turned into a healthy dish that we love and will definitely make again!  Changes:  3 chicken breasts, 1 T Cajun seasoning, no butter, 12 mushrooms, 3 green onions, one clove of garlic, no garlic powder, no salt, 3/4 c nonfat sour cream, no cream, 1/2 box linguine.  We will enjoy this as leftovers tomorrow, and I will be making a bit more linguine to add to the dish.   Next time I'll probably use 3/4 box from the start.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Carol!

This was delicious! I made the recipe almost exactly as it was written. Unfortunately, the grocery store was out of green onions, so I left that out, but I highly doubt that made very much difference. I also doubled the recipe, and I'm really glad I did. It would not have been enough if I hadn't doubled it. The last change I made is that I added a cornstarch slurry at the end because the sauce was waaaay too thin. It was like soup. Overall, the recipe was really good. Great flavor! However, I was hoping for a little more spice. When I see "Cajun" I want it to be a little spicy. Next time, I think I will add some red pepper flakes. There definitely will be a next time though :)

For the non-dairy people, I substituted Olive oil for butter and goat's milk for cream.   I added a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce and it was perfect. I couldn't tell it wasn't cream based.  Delicious.

Very tasty, easy to make, will make again.  I used sour cream instead of heavy cream, and will use light sour cream next time. Used mini-peppers, green onion. Hubby liked it, it has a definite "kick" to it. Didn't have linguine, used egg noodles, still good!

My husband made this the other night and we were blown away. He made it exactly as written and it was absolutely wonderful. Next time we will try using sour cream instead of the heavy cream for health purposes though. This recipe definitely made it into rotation.

This is great!  I sprinkled the Cajun seasoning directly on the chicken (because I'm too lazy to put it in the bag) and it worked well.  It was very good as is, but I prefer stronger flavors, so I added more Cajun seasoning to the sauce for my personal preference.  Next time I will add one minced garlic clove for more flavor.

This was good but not quite what I expected. Followed the recipe exactly and it was a bit too spicy for us, even though my husband and I both like spicy foods. The sauce was good and I followed the recommendations to thicken it a bit with corn starch. I would make this again but cut back a little on the Cajun seasoning.

I love this recipe. I found it while looking for something different to do for dinner last year. Well, I love it. And my husband does too. It's so great. It's a bit spicy but not too much. 

We've also tried this one with shake N' bake on the chicken instead of the cajun spice and it's very good.

This recipe is superb! My husband had defrosted some chicken and I wanted to try something different. Loved the creaminess of recipe and the cajun on the chicken made it have quite a bit of a zip. I think I'd try something a bit more mild than cajun as I'm not one for spicy food, but otherwise I'm very, very happy with it! I would definitely have this again. My husband and I were VERY happy with it.

Overall I thought the recipe was good.  I did alter slightly...I cooked the chicken first and removed.  I then cooked the onions/peppers/mushrooms and fresh garlic.  I cooked them longer than the 2-3 minutes.  I used 8 ounces of rotini pasta and thought it was the perfect amount. I used a small amount of pasta water to get the right consistency for the sauce.  After it was made, I tossed in a small amount of cubed fresh mozzarella. This recipe lends itself to tweaking it to your family's tastes.  Leftovers microwaved perfectly.

This is a great recipe! My boyfriend and I loved the full flavor. I will probably take some of the recommendations for cutting the fat and adding some different flavors next time. It's a great start to a wonderful dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty! My husband loved it. I did make a few substitutions based on what I had in my pantry at the time. Instead of fresh mushrooms, I used canned. I also used fresh garlic (2 minced cloves) rather than garlic powder and red onion rather than green. I didn't have any whipping cream, so I substituted one cup of evaporated milk. Even with these substitutions, the dish was incredibly tasty. I highly recommend it and will definitely make again.

My husband absolutely loved this dish!  The chicken was moist and tender and the sauce was flavorful!   I used "Cajun spice seasoning mix in a jar" recipe from AR so I could control the salt in the seasoning.   I also used half and half instead of heavy cream and had no problem with a thin sauce. When you take the dish off of the stove it will be thin, but, as it sits for a few minutes the sauce will absorb into the pasta for a perfect yummy dish!

I didn't make any real changes because I think if you read a recipe on here and then change everything it's not fair to review it at all. It's delicious! I used a sweet onion because the green onions at the store looked terrible. I used red and orange peppers because the green ones make me burp like a teenaged boy. (I could burp the alphabet). It's even better the next day. Hubby loves it the night I make  it and even better for lunch the next day!

I had left over penne in the fridge, with about 1/4 jar of ala vodka sauce and leftover chicken. I sauteed some green peppers, mushrooms and a little red onion. Then added the pasta, chicken and sauce. Because I had sauce, I didn't need to make it but we like spice and flavor so I added cayenne, garlic powder, black pepper and some basil. It was delicious and a creative way to use all those leftovers! Next time, I will make the sauce and let you know!

A really excellent, quick meal. I took my cue from other reviewers and reduced the fat by replacing butter with olive oil and cream with milk. I thickened the milk with a tblsp of flour. I left out the peppers because they don't agree with me, and used real garlic and a squeeze of lemon instead of lemon pepper. For "cajun seasoning" I used Penzey's "southwest seasoning." The whole came together in a flash, tasted and looked great. Thanks for the recipe and the suggestions for changing it to meet my dietary needs (and the contents of my cupboards!).

Followed the directions exactly except that 1. I cut up the chicken into bite-sized cubes and browned  before adding the other ingredientst, and 2. I didn't have lemon pepper so I used a little lemon zest and a total of 1/4 tsp pepper. It was very, very easy, super fast, and delicious. A definite keeper. It says it makes 2 servings but that would be two REALLY big eaters. I'm sure the leftovers will go fast. Thanks Carol!

Made this tonight and it was a hit. I used sour cream instead of heavy cream. The grocery store was out of heavy cream! But wow. So full of flavor and yumminess. And easy. :) dWill definitely make again.

Just finished with dinner and one word, amazing! I doubled the recipe and seasoned the chicken to taste but everything else stayed the same. My husband loved it and request I mix in some shrimp too. Definitely a keeper.

My husband & I both love to cook...we were so excited to try this recipe! It did not fail!! Incredibly delicious! Used bow tie pasta instead of linguine as a request from our son because bow tie pasta is "more fun"! Besides that...followed the recipe to the letter.

This was excellent! I agree with others that it tastes restaurant quality. The only thing I changed was that I used half & half instead of heavy cream. I am already looking forward to making it again!

I am giving this a 4 because I LOVED how the dish tasted, but had to make some adjustments to make it healthier.  I used all of the same spices and veggies, but cut out the butter and cream.  I sauteed my veggies first in olive oil, then added my chicken after about 10 minutes (I like my veggies a bit softer, so therefore sauteed them longer).  When I tossed everything together, i used 4 oz of plain yogurt instead of the cream.  I then put it on top of spaghetti squash instead of pasta.  SOOOO delicious and MUCH less fat and calories!

My family of 5 loves this dish. I have preschoolers and a teenager, plus my husband to please. 
I chose to add zucchini and yellow squash to add more veggies. I also use chicken breast tenderloins so that they cook quickly and evenly without getting dry or tough. Rigitoni is easier for my little ones to eat, so that's what I used.
It's worth it to add fresh minced garlic and fresh basil when time permits.

I have made this over and over again. My family and co-workers love it. I usually double all seasoning except salt, omit the butter and parmesan. Also, I added hot sauce and additional Cajun seasoning, and parsley.

This is really good. Not amazing but pretty close. I followed the directions just as written but I also added fresh minced garlic along with the garlic powder. The sauce was too runny for my liking so I added the parmesan into the sauce instead of just using it as a garnish creating an alfredo sauce. I also put a little cornstarch into it as well. Let it rest a bit a voila, the runny sauce thickens. =p I really enjoyed this dish and will be making it again.

This dish was delicious, the only thing is that I  doubled  up on ingredients,  feeding a family of 5. I used sour cream(light) instead of a heavy cream. When making this dish make sure you use enough cream so the pasta want  be dry! My husband and children loved it !

This is wonderful!  I pre-cut the veggies & measure out spices the night before if I'm going to be busy  (I actually make up a large batch of the seasoning to have on hand).
I double the mushrooms & you can use fat-free 1/2 & 1/2 (not as rich) or fat free sour cream! Great with garlic toast and a salad!

This was a really good meal and fast as well! My modifications: - Used Creole Seasoning instead of Cajun. - Used more mushrooms because we love them. - used a large pot because once it get down to adding the cream, my skillet could not hold it all. - sprinkled some additional (1/2 teaspoon) creole seasoning into the cream sauce because the first time we made it, my fiance said it tasted like hot chicken in cream. Adding Creole Seasoning into the cream brought it all together. - Also let the sauce thicken up in the pan before serving. Without that, the sauce was a little too runny.

5 out of 5 I would have given it more but it needed a little shrimp to be truely cajun! This is a fairly simple yet delicious recipe. I changed just a couple of things, I have problems digesting green bell peppers so I used a yellow, Ialso like a coarse sea or kosher salt, and you can't beat fresh cracked black pepper, the recipe works well when the servings are upped to four rather than two, and I prefer the giorgio mushrooms in a glass jar. I think a half pound of small shrimp would put this recipe on my top 5 of all time, try these small adjustments and I think you will be blow away, Bon Apetite I guarentee!

Really good!  And no offense to the creator, but I also changed a few things to make it not as likely to clog the arteries. . 

I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces, seasoned them with a carribean cajun seasoning (Mrs. Dash- saltless) and browned them using Pam instead of butter. They cook quickly so be careful not to over-do it.

Then add in everything else.  I omitted mushrooms, used vadalia onion instead of green, and used light cream instead of heavy cream. 

Like a previous cook mentioned, I squeezed some lemon juice on the chicken while it cooked instaed of using the lemon pepper and it was great! The chicken ended up so juicy.

I had to add a bit more salt (ground sea salt) than listed, as the seasoning itself doesn't have any. Also put some ground cayenne pepper to give it a kick last minute.

Overall- really good!  Boyfriend went back for seconds, and is now taking a nap. Always a good sign!

I really like this recipe! Followed the direction to the letter, the only modification was to thicken up the sauce a bit at the end. I was thrilled when my son was willing to try it by just looking at the recipe and even more excited when he stated it tasted "awesome".

this is a great recipe! once i added in the heavy cream it still was too wet so i took out about 1/2 cup of sauce and added some flour to thicken it up gave it a stir and poured it back in the pot and after doing that it came out perfect!!! my hubby loved it so this is definantly one i will make again...

A new favorite!!  I did make slight modifications due to the ingredients I had on hand (a roux and whole milk for the cream, white onion instead of green, and only 1.5 orange/yellow peppers), but I don't believe it affected the outcome for better or for worse.  I did cube the chicken and peppers to make it easier to eat.  I will make this again and again!

I have now made this recipe twice and can NOT get enough.  It's absolutely incredible.  And ironically, one of my favorite dishes is the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken pasta at TGIFriday's - this recipe practically tastes identical.  In fact, we were looking for copycat recipes about a yr ago because they don't make it anymore!  Anyways, I highly recommend this one - it's fantastic!  I'm 1/2 tempted to try it with spicy sausage instead of chicken to see if it's good that way too!

I made this for the first time tonight and found it to be very easy, quick and delicious. Also, this meal is inexpensive if you already have all of the spices. I will definitely be making this one again.

This is a fabulous, versatile recipe.  I doubled it, and to cut the fat I cooked the chicken and veggies in olive oil and instead of the heavy cream I made a roux of flour and butter and used 1 C skim milk and 1 C half and half and added the herbs and spices for an incredible basil cream sauce. I even made the sauce with pasta again for a separate side dish. This is a recipe for company and family alike. Fabulous!

I couldn't find cajun spice, unfortunately, so i just tried to re-create it using paprika, salt and pepper, italian spices, basil and some other spices.. i even added chili poweder for a little kick! and it was yummy!!!  and i also substituted heavy cream with 1/2 soy cream and 1/2 heavey cream, and it still worked!

I doubled the mushrooms, olive oil instead of butter, and used half and half instead of cream. The results were delicious. It was flavorful without being too heavy. The picky eaters in my family liked it so I will be making it again!

My family loved this dish. I cut my chicken breasts in half but next time I will cut them into smaller strips. I also added corn starch to the sauce as a thickening agent.

I was looking for something new.. and found this recipe.  It was pretty good!  I omitted the mushrooms all together and used a regular onion instead of a green onion.. everything else I kept the same.  Will definitely make again!

This was very good. I ended up doubling the amount of Cajun seasoning. I didn't use mushrooms because I don't like them. I also added some peanuts. Once I added the peanuts it tasted very similar to a Thai noodle dish I get at a local restaurant here in Los Angeles.  Overall this recipe was great and I will make it again.

I followed this pretty closely except like others I substituted sour cream in place of the heavy cream (I'm sure it is heavenly with the heavy cream!). and skipped the parm (mostly because I just wanted to eat and forgot!).  I didn't have dried basil but I had fresh and I always use fresh anyway when I have it.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I am so glad we tried this recipe! I made it for my husbands family and everyone loved it! Even my husband's sister who doesn't like bell peppers! :) I used about half the bell pepper the recipe called for and about dbl the mushrooms, but it was delicious! Very flavorful dish! I highly recommend trying it!

YUM! Had a nice kick to it, not to spicy, but just a good kick! My only complaint is, I followed this recipe exactly, and it was sooooo runny, but I added cornstartch and it was an easy fix. Very good!! I do think you could cut back on some calories in a few places, with the cream and butter, and I plan on trying some other ways next time I make this!!!!!!

I cooked this for a weekly supper club & it was fabulous. The only things I changed were that I baked the chicken in a butter/Tony Chachere's marinade instead of cooking it on the skillet (it comes out juicier) and I used Half N' Half (thickened with a little flour) instead of the heavy cream. I also went with fresh lemon instead of lemon pepper. This was awesome & everyone went back for seconds. I used bowtie pasta to pick up the sauce better. Yum :) I will definately be making this one again.

A great addition to this recipe is Andouille sausage, wostercher sauce, and Louisiana Hot sauce.   You can substitute the spices with Emeril's Essence recipe. I also have found that bowtie pasta works best.

I like this a lot. Other than a little bit of heavy cream it is actually quite healthy for you.  I really liked the spice of this meal and I added some onions for sweetness to counteract that along with the colored peppers.    As far as a quick and tasty pasta from scratch goes, you can't really beat this one.

I made this using only 1 TBS of butter instead of 2 and a cup of 5% cream mixed with a tablespoon or so of cornstarch instead of the heavy cream. Healthier that the original recipe and it still turned out fantastic! I really loved all the fresh veggies in it. The recipe says it serves two, but my husband and I had decent sized portions for supper and there was still enough leftover his lunch which was a nice bonus.

This was really excellent.  My husband said to add it to my book of "winners".  I used half & half in place of the cream and left out the lemon pepper as i didn't have any.  One of my sons is allergic to dairy, so I made his with thickened chicken broth instead of cream.  It was really good as well for those that would like to make a healthier version of this recipe!

Love this recipe! So simple and tasty. Great for a quick weeknight meal and for a party entree.  I use a garlic alfredo sauce instead of the heavy cream and it tasted great.  I also added pepper flakes to the butter that the chicken was cooked in... this added a nice spicy kick.

So easy. This was a lot easier and faster too than it sounded. I had this done by the time the pasta was done. I sliced my chicken into strips and then sprinkled them with the seasoning before cooking. I made more linguine though as I wanted to get 3 servings from this. A wonderful dish and there is some left for hubby's lunch tomorrow. This was a little spicy but I made my own cajun seasoning and tend to be heavy handed with cayenne so that was probably my fault. Very good, thanks for the great easy recipe!

Didn't really notice the cajun flavour a whole lot and it was a bit oily, but still pretty good. Next time I might coat the chicken breast in seasoning, cook it and then slice it and put on top of the pasta.

OMG This was delicious. I used extra cajun seasoning and chicken thighs. It was as good as any cajun pasta I have had in a restaurant. Next time I'm gonna make it with shrimp.

This was the first recipe I ever made from this site, and it is incredible! My husband and I loved it so much, that I made it the very next week when we had friends over. They loved it too! Unfortunately, it is very unhealthy, otherwise I'd make it all the time!

I am so happy my sister made this dish one night.  This dish is a regular meal in my house now.  One thing I do is let the sauce cook a little longer after I add the cream so that it thickens.  Otherwise the sauce is to thin for me.  LOVE IT!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Preparation was quick, even with some alterations I added. I wanted this to taste spicy so I used Tony's Creole plus paprika and chili powder on the chicken. I let the chicken set while I julienned red and green peppers and a Serrano pepper. While the noodles cooked, I broiled some bacon. I used (some of) the bacon grease to cook the chicken. I added the peppers and completely forgot about cooking the mushrooms (oops). So, I tossed those in last minute. I cut recipe portion in half and used only 3/4 cup half and half. I added all the dried spices to the H&H. I added about a 1/2 cup of the cream to the chicken and peppers along with 1 tsp of cornstarch per other recommendaions. I allowed it to cook down for a few minutes. I was really happy with the consistency but didn't realize my pasta wasn't thoroughly drained (my fault) so my sauce loosened up. I had to cook everything a little longer to thicken up a bit. The taste was good minus the fact I thought it was a tad too salty. Next time will add either broccoli or mix spring mix. This is an easy, quick recipe that is versatile which really makes this five star *****

Great flavor to the sauce.  It was spicy, creamy, and interesting.  The sauce is also very versatile, so you can made a lot of additions.  When I make this again, I think I will add some spicy sausage (it definitely could have used some) and some broccoli or spinach (since it was lacking in vegetables for me).  I think I couldn’t really taste a difference from the basil so I would probably add more of that, and also some parsley (to make it taste “fresher”).  All around good recipe that can be easily tailored to your preferences.

This was so good! I didn't change a thing. I'm not usually a big cream based sauce fan, but this was great. My boyfriend said that this was one of his favorite meals that I made. Next time I might try adding sun dried tomatoes for some tangyness.

There is little you can do to make this recipe any better.  It is one of AR's very best.  As a previous reviewer suggested, use the frozen peppers-saves time and money!  Reheats nicely.....if you have a Sunflower Market in your area, use the Cajun Seasoning that comes in the grinder-WOW!!!!!

I give it 5 stars, my hubby gives it 4 stars.  He though the mushrooms didn't quite go with it and that it was a tad bit too creamy and rich for a cajun pasta.  I loved it though! ... i say go with my opinion!  haha ;)

I made this recipe as a spur of the moment what to make meal for my boyfriend and I.We used angel hair pasta for thats all we had on hand. Like others mentioned I used sour cream but went ahead and mixed it with the cream as well. Along with the Cajun seasoning ( I used Tony Chacheres) we also coated the chicken with cayenne pepper. The pasta came out amazing. Also used corn starch as a way to thicken up the sauce.

I thought this was very good.  Only change I made was adding more mushrooms.  Next time I would thicken up the sauce a little more.  Very good recipe as is!

Wow this is really good. I can't believe how easy it was to make. O.k. i I only changed a couple things thanx to all the reviews. I used 1 cup sour cream instead of heavy whip and used evoo instead of margarine. If you like chicken, pasta,bell peppers, and cheese you will love this. And I'm wondering how did it make so much? Seems like more than serving for 2, but thank goodness. Next time I'll use chicken breasts instead of cooked canned chicken LOL, but still wonderful!!

I doubled the cajun seasoning and did 1 tsp of every other seasonings, since some reviews said it needed more flavor, and we love flavor.  I made this recipe with and without meat, because I'm a vegetarian and my husband is not.  I increased the cream to 1 3/4c and divided it by two pans.  I added broccoli to the vegie pan and it was fantastic.  The chicken pan turned out a flop, oversalted.  Apparently, the creole seasoning I used is extrememly salty; doubling it was so wrong, my fault.  Next time I would be much more careful with seasoning the chicken before I cook it.  But, that said it is a GREAT recipe.

I doubled the spices, cut up the chicken, used half low-fat sour cream and half low-fat plain yougurt in place of the cream, and used olive oil in place of the butter, per suggestions from other reviews.  It was fantastic!

This was pretty good. I did cut the chicken into strips, and cut the peppers into smaller pieces, added fresh garlic, and more mushrooms. I also used lowfat milk and cornstarch to thicken it up and I used whole wheat pasta and olive oil instead of butter. Tried to reduce the fat as much as possible. Still very good. If your looking for super thick sauce, don't use milk as it is a little thinner than I would like. Next time I'll try half and half.

This was good but I still think it needs tweaking...I used FF sour cream and fresh basil and garlic and added some quartered cherry tomatoes. The seasoning was kind of one note with the cajun seasoning (I love it, but it just needed something else). I think I will play with adding other seasonings, otherwise this is an amazing base recipe and has tons of potential! The chicken tasted great cut up in pieces and we used rotelle instead of linguine.

FAB!  I'm from New Orleans and was very impressed.  Only thing, I might omit the mushrooms next time.  They turned the sauce brown.  I can't think of any cajun dishes that have mushrooms in 'em!  Will definitely make again though.  It was delicious!

Great recipe!  I made this for my parents when they visited and I got very good reviews.  My boyfriend said it was one of his favorites.  I did not add as much cream just to cut back on calories and added a little hot sauce, we like things very spicy!

Lovely!  This cannot be screwed up (and trust me, I tried.)  I cut up the chicken as others suggested, but cooked it through before adding the veggies.  I knew the chicken would be overcooked, but had pretty much given up on it at this point and covered the thing to soften the peppers before adding the cream.  Added the cream and spices with one hand and used the other to peruse the Chinese take-out menu, reduced the sauce, took a bite, and WOW!  Thanks so much for the post.

Fantastic! After one bite my husband said "If you don't make this again, I'll have to get with a lawyer".  I made the "Cajun Spice Mix" recipe from this site (submitted by Bobbie Jean) for the seasonings and used about 1 1/2 Tablespoons for 3 chicken breasts which I cut into strips. I followed the advice of others and used rotini pasta, red and yellow peppers (instead of green), sauted with about a half of an onion sliced and a clove of fresh garlic instead of the green onions and garlic powder.  I also used a squeeze of fresh lemon and 2 Tablespoons of fresh basil.  I used 3/4 cup half and half with about 1/4 cup cream to cut some of the fat. I probably could have only used half and half but I was afraid to lose the creaminess.  I did thicken it with a little cornstarch and did not add any additional salt.  Very minor changes to an excellent recipe!!

This was very good. I increased the serving size to 3 because I had 3 chicken breast halves. A few things I did differently: I cut the chicken breasts in half so I had 6 pieces. I sliced up a yellow pepper in addition to the red and green peppers. I used a small can of mushrooms instead of fresh mushrooms. I didn't have any lemon pepper seasoning so I added a little extra ground black pepper and a splash of lemon juice. I didn't have heavy cream but I did have some leftover sour cream and regular cream which I used. I also didn't have any green onions so I just left them out. Finally, I added some more butter and some cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end. Will make this again!

I loved this recipe, my only suggesting would be to leave out the salt. Depending on what Cajun seasoning you use there is already enough salt in that. Otherwise this was awesome and my boyfriend had 3 plates.

Spicy, but a little boring.  I stuck pretty closely to the recipe.  I subbed the cream with fat free half & half, used rigatoni, and didn't have green onions.  I have a hard time believing those things would have improved it, had I included them.  It was edible, but I don't know if I'll make it again.

This was so yummy! I was worried at first because the sauce didn't seem to want to thicken...but after about 2 mins of simmering it thickened perfectly. My fiance loved this and so did I. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Excellent.  Though I did make one big change.  I was suprised to realize I was out of chicken, so I substited ground beef.  Loved it, but can't wait to try it with chicken!

This was a great recipe! I had read some of the other suggestions about using sour cream and thought that was a good idea. My boyfriend suggested using cream of mushroom, so I used half of each, which I think added an interesting flavor. I also used a bit more Tony's than others might since I like my food a bit spicy, but next time I might just blacken the chicken instead. All in all this was a great dish!

I made this for a pot luck. Everyone seemed to like it. I made more than suggested and it wasn't as creamy so I added more heavy cream and it was much better. Next time I'm going to just make less and I think it would be great. Also, not enough kick or much flavor so I will add more. Everyone seemed to like it though! This will be a keeper! Thank you!

This is a colorful and flavorful dish.  Since we are watching our calorie intake, I used fat free half & half to lighten it up a bit and thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch.  I used Konrico Creole Seasoning for the cajun spice and tossed it with spinach and chive linguini because that was what I had on hand.  Delicious!  This would make a very nice dish to serve to company.

I found it a touch bland. 

Next time, I'll add more garlic, crushed red pepper, and some roasted red peppers or sun dried tomatoes. 

Definitely the ground of a great recipie, but it needs to be kicked up a notch.

Pretty good dish.  Made it exactly as recipe stated.  Sauce was perfect consisency.  I like spicy... really spicy, and this particular dish was spicy but not hot.  I will use some hot sauce next time for my taste.

This was REALLY good. I haven't had success with cream sauces in the past but this turned out great. I only used the equivalent of one pepper (mixed green, red and yellow). I added diced tomato, zuchini and used baby portabellas. I used bowtie pasta instead of linguine. It turned out wonderful. I will definitely add this to the rotation.

Maybe I used a bad seasoning brand because the chicken really didn't do it for us. The pasta, on the other hand, really was wonderful.

This recipe was GREAT!!!  Tastes just like the one from TGI Fridays.  It was a little spicy with dredging the chicken in spices next time I will sprinkle heavily.  I also sliced the chicken and combined with the sauce and pasta, after cooking, this made the sauce the perfect consistancy.  Makes great leftovers too!

I love this recipe!  Although the recipe is good as written (except I add extra cream) I now cheat and use jar alfredo sauce.  I still coat my chicken in the Cajun seasoning and fry up with the veggies but then I just pour on the sauce, heat and serve.

Had a great depth of flavor. It was just a LITTLE too spicy for our family, though. Will add only 1-1/2 tsp. Cajun seasoning next time. Also,I will cook mushrooms first THEN add peppers: because mushrooms weren't done but peppers were getting overcooked. And,I prefer the sweetness of yellow (& red) to the green peppers. I added some cut fresh asparagas (just cooked in the pasta water)for more texture & to cut the richness some. Will make again,(with those couple of changes) when wanting something rich but spicy.

OMG!  This was delish--and I followed the recipe to a T.  I was a little afraid the sauce would be thin, based on other reviews, but it seemed fine so I didn't add/change anything. I made it this past Sunday for our friends, and we all loved it so much I'm making it again this weekend for my in-laws.

Unfortunately I had to drain twice, once from the chicken and once from the peppers, and it took away lots of the flavor, but all I had to do was re-spice it afterwards and it tasted great!!

I found this to be pretty bland even after doubling the Cajun. I used half and half instead of cream.  I think if I were to make it again, I would add in some sour cream and maybe some Dijon or dried mustard or maybe a small jar of green chillies. I also put in some flour maybe a 1/8- 1/4 cup and coated the chicken an peppers after sautéing them. I turned up the heat a little to cook the flour and then lowered it to add in the half and half. It turned out OK, but I think some sour cream would add an interesting note.

My husband asked if we could give this recipes more than 5 stars!!!  Wonderful! The changes I made: I cut up chicken into bite size pieces, I used fresh garlic, omitted the green onions (didn't have any), omitted the mushrooms (don't like them), used EXTRA cajun seasoning (Tony's creole seasoning to be exact. My hubby said this is his new favorite dinner!

This was ok. I did use half and half instead of the cream so not sure if that would make a big difference. I don't think so, I've substitute items like this in other recipes and they still turn out great so this is probably just not to our taste preference. There are different types of Cajun seasonings so maybe that makes a difference but either way will not be making this again.  Thanks!

This recipe has so many great flavors. My entire family loved it. To make it a more healthy recipe I used fat free half & half and added corn starch for thickening.

"WOOOOW"....I made this over the weekend and EVERYONE was amazed how so few ingredients good taste so wonderful.  I doubled the cajun seasoning and my friends and I couldn't get enough.  No leftovers.  :)

AMAZING recipe! We use more cajun seasoning and chop the chicken up into bite-sized pieces for easier cooking and eating. We also add a few more mushrooms, but that's just us (we love mushrooms).  Wouldn't change a thing - this recipe is DELICIOUS!  Definitely a keeper.  My boyfriend begs me to cook this at least once a week :)

This dish is absolutely wonderful! I have made it several times and it is sooo good every time. Sometimes I use a little less heavy cream if I want the flavor to be a little stronger. So delicious it's hard to put down!

My family loves this recipe.  I substitute 1 c. fat free sour cream for the heavy cream to reduce the fat and calories.  I add imitation crab meat in with the chicken and use lemon juice instead of lemon pepper.

I thought this was really tasty. Instead of heavy cream I used half and half and then cornstarch to thicken it up. The recipe doesn't state that the chicken should be sliced up or chopped in any way but I found that it was easier to work with when it's cut up. I guess maybe it's because my pan was a little too small but I had to take the chicken out of the pan while I was sauteeing the veggies. Then I added the cream and other stuff and then put in the cooked chicken after I added the linguine. This recipe was actually a little more work than I thought it would be due to all the chopping I needed to do. I would make this again though.

This was pretty good- my husband loved it, so that's a plus! I used fat free half-and-half and it still turned out very good (used cornstarch to thicken it up a bit).  Thought it was a little bland at the end- so added some garlic salt, and it was perfect. Very spicy!

I absolutely love this recipe! I've actually had this dish at two different restaurants and after my first time attempting to fix it, it turned out just as good as when I dined out. The only difference I have to say is that I added shrimp and then some cornstarch to make the sauce a little thicker. That idea came from another reviewer and I was very pleased with the results!

I loved this recipe!  I used half and half instead of the heavy cream and it made it a lot saucier.  I served it in bowls with a lot of good garlic bread.  Definitely a keeper.

This was an awesome dinner.  My husband thought that I was an amazing cook.  He said it was restaurant quality.  The only substitution I made was to add more garlic powder.  We are garlic fans.

I made this for dinner for my boyfriend last night.  I didn't have any cajun seasoning so I had to substitute some Old Bay and chili powder.  I added some minced garlic and onions and left out the mushrooms (my boyfriend's not a fan).  The Old Bay made the chicken a little too salty but that's my fault for not using cajun seasoning.  Other than that, this was pretty good.

Fantastic! I just finished eating it and it was great. I'm actually chewing on a peice of bell pepper right now. I did add extra cajun, a little crushed red pepper, yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper, drained the liquids, used portabello mushrooms, did not sautee' the green onions, used them as a fresh garnish instead, and used feta cheese instead of parm because that's what I had on hand, all in all it was fantastic!!! My husband and son loved it too! I think that even if I hadn't changed a thing it still would have been to die for! I think it was almost better than the Louisiana Cajun Chicken Pasta at Cheesecake Factory. They better watch out for this recipe :)

This pasta is amazing! My husband would eat it every day if I let him. Even my four year old asks for it! The only variations I've tried are substituting the linguine with penne pasta, & slicing a couple links of andouille sausage to saute along with the chicken. I'll probably try adding shrimp as well. As it packs a lot of calories, it's probably best only occasionally, unless you use lower fat substitutes where you can. Everyone who eats this loves it & I'd give it ten stars if I could.

This was great! I didn't use the cream b/c we didn't have any in the house, but we did have some premade alfredo sauce that actually did just fine and was good in a pinch. Next time I'll try it w/ the cream, but the alfredo was good and the store bought stuff is a good consistancy for the dish.

I used portabello mushrooms because I wasn't sure what kind to use, and they really were great in it.  I think I used a little too much cajun seasoning because it was HOT! It was still delicious though.  We're definitely going to make this one again.  A really, really amazing recipe.

I made this sauce with the chicken over linguine without the peppers and it was great. I added more parm. than required and also added 1/4 cup sour cream to make the sauce richer. I also made this sauce with shrimp and it was delicious! Will make again I am sure.

Easy recipe-great presentation.  I took other memeber's advice & cooked the chicken, vegetables & sauce seperately & it looked fantastic spooned over the pasta.  I just felt compelled to write in & say that the sauce was definitely NOT too thin.  I added a TINY bit of flour when I started on the advice of almost everyone who reviewed it-but actually had to end up pouring in more cream than the recipe asked for because it was becoming too thick.  I started the sauce in a clean pan, maybe that's why.  In any case-great dish.  It tasted wonderful.

This is by far the best recipe I have made from this site. I've been making it both for week-night dinners, as well as for weekend guests! The flavor is excellent. The only thing I change is the amount of sauce. I usually double it, because my family likes extra. Excellent dish!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now and I still love it.  The spices are a great combination.  It is nice to have a creamy pasta that isn't bland.  I use fresh basil and I do thicken the sauce because it is a bit thin.

Delicious!  Made this last night for my boyfriend and we both loved it!  Has so many good flavors.  I made some minor alterations/substitutions.  First, I seasoned the chicken breasts, then put them in the fridge for an hour to soak up the flavoring.  Then, I used 1/2 Half & Half, 1/2 Heavy Cream (although next time I'll use all Half & Half), as other users mentioned, the sauce is thin, so I just added a couple of tablespoons of corn starch.  That worked perfectly!  Finally, because I love cajun seasoning, I added an (additional) 1/2 a teaspoon in with all the other spices. Will definitely be making again!

This tasted so much better than I was expecting. The family ate the entire giant bowl. I cut out the mushrooms and onions because my family can't stand either and I added flour to the sauce as several people suggested and that made it far less runny. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. My fiancee liked the chicken and the sauce but it wasn't exactly his type of dish because he doesn't like bell peppers. So if you don't like peppers, this probably isn't for you. On the other hand, I LOVED it and my parents really enjoyed it. I did make a few alterations, however. Instead of using dried basil I used a few leaves of fresh basil and chopped it up. Also, I used fresh lemon juice instead of using lemon pepper. And I threw in some yellow bell pepper along with the red and green. I added just a little more Cajun seasoning once I'd cooked the chicken and tasted it. For the sauce I added a little bit of flour to thicken it up some more. This turned out great. Thanks for sharing! I will definately use this again.

Great tasting, very easy chicken recipe. It is spicy but that is what makes it so good.  A nice change from plain chicken.   I followed the recipe except I cut the chicken into strips to cook faster and I didn't have heavy cream.  I used a sustitution (3/4 cup milk, 1/3 cup melted butter)  I also used a litte cornstarch to thicken the sauce since I didn't have the cream.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent flavor and easy to make. I didn't have any cream or evaporated milk, so I just used regular whole milk. Was still fabulous even if not as creamy as might normally be.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  I didn't use the pasta, I served it over rice.  Other than that, I made it as written.  I'll use some fresh garlic next time, as well as fresh basil instead of the dried.

Wow .. this was fantastic!  Tonight at 5:15 I had no idea what we were going to have for dinner - all I knew is there was chicken tenders defrosted in my fridge.  I did change the recipe a bit and did this:  Sprinkled the chicken tenders with LOTS of cajun seasoning - let it sit on the counter while I started to boil some gold potatoes.  When the potatoes were almost done I put the chicken tenders in a skillet with about 2 tablespoons of butter - saute'd them until the potatoes were almost done.  I then added a cup of heavy cream, a dash of garlic powder, a dash of basil, and some grated fresh Parmesan cheese (not the green box kind).  Simmered that until the potatoes were done (and mashed) and served it on top of the potatoes.  Definately a keeper - thanks!

After step 3 I removed the chicken and greens from the pan. Then I melted 1/4 cup of butter in it, added cream, crushed garlic and Parmesan cheese. Then tossed everything together.
Yummie.

My fiance and I absolutely loved this recipe! The pasta turned out wonderful! I served it with steamed green beans and garlic bread. I used veggie spiral pasta instead of the linguine. I also added extra chili powder, red pepper flakes, and onion powder. (The onion powder was an accident I had grabbed it instead of garlic powder). I wanted to use up some of the peppers that I had in my fridge so I added half an extra pepper and used red, yellow, and orange since that was what I had. I used chicken tenders and cut them into small pieces, and I added shredded asiago cheese to the sauce which helped thicken it. I will definately be making this again!

This was very, very good.  I made it for my in-laws last night.  They love cajun food so I was hoping for the best.  I made it for 5 people so I used 2 large chicken breasts and a couple tenders plus a pound of medium shrimp.  I cut the chicken into thin strips to cook faster.  I did not double the peppers but I did double the green onion and seasonings.  I kept adding Tony's cajun seasoning so I probably used way more than called-for.  We love spicy food.  I cooked the chicken, removed it from the pan, cooked the peppers a little longer than called-for cause I don't like them super crunchy.  When they were almost the way I like them I threw in the shrimp.  When the shrimp was almost done I put the chicken back in and then the cream.  I heated it through then threw all that in the big pot with the drained pasta.  I used 10 ounces of bowties.  I used 1 cup heavy cream and another cup of half and half.  It was a little runny but I tossed in a bunch of parmesan at the end which kind of thickened it up.  Even after we all had seconds I ended up with some leftovers which is better than not enough.  Next time I'm going to experiment with fat-free half and half and maybe not use so much or find some way to thicken it first.  I served it with salad and french bread.  The sauce was so good we all "sopped" it up with our bread!  SUPER DELICIOUS!!

Was pretty good but very rich and creamy.  If I make it again I'll probably add more cajun seasoning.  Overall pretty good and was even great reheated.

This recipe is great!  I too made some alterations that I will share.  Since many said they had "runny" sauce I cooked the whipping cream alone on low for about 1/2hr then added as the recipe states.  I also omitted the green pepper and added tomatoes.  Ours was not too spicy at all so I am not sure if cajun seasonings vary.  Yummy recipe for sure!!!

What a great recipe! We loved it. It's easier to cook the chicken if you cut it up though. That also makes it easier to manage when you add in the veggies. The sauce was so good. Another keeper!

I adore this recipe..  It is so easy to make and always pleases everyone.  I always add a lot of parmesan to the sauce while it cooks to help thicken it, and because we like more cheese flavor than the recipe calls for.  Sometimes I add a pinch of cornstarch to help with the thickening.  Add zuccini and summer squash to this.  Yummy.

Made this recipe for dinner last night, and we loved it!  I bought chicken tenderloins and just cut them into bite-size pieces, which made it even easier.  I supstituted thinly sliced vidalia onions for the green onions and bowtie pasta for the linguine. I also added the parmesan to the mixture, rather than sprinkling on top.  I think this may have helped to thicken the sauce a little.  Just finished the leftovers for lunch.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing, Carol!

Excellent recipe!  Turned out great did what others suggested: sub cream with 2% milk and cornstarch.  Didnt have green onions sub for yellow onion and green peppers only and used rotini instead of linguini.  Turned out great.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was very good!  I did make a few changes though . . . substituted olive oil for the butter and 1 cup sour cream for the cream.  I don't like mushrooms so I added some zuchinni and diced tomatoes.  Yum!  The first time I made this I mixed the veggies, chicken, and sauce all together but it made it look not so good.  The next time I made it I heated the sauce up seperately and spooned it over the pasta when serving, then added the chicken and veggies.  The presentation was much better!

Delicious and easy to make. I added more cajun spice for a little more kick and thickened the sauce with cornstarch as suggested. Would definitely make it again.

Great recipe.  Made it for the first time for guests! (They're used to being my culinary guinea pigs.)  They loved it.  I used some 2% milk and half-and-half instead of the cream. I used more basil and lemon pepper (maybe 1 tsp each).  Very tasty and restaurant-like.  Attractive presentation.

Very good recipe! The only change I made was to melt butter and cajun seasoning in a ziploc bag. Then I added the chicken to the baggy and shook till coated.  Then I emptied the baggy into the hot skillet and continued with the rest of the directions.

This is my second review of this recipe.  It's still awesome.  I diced the red peppers & chicken, and used olive oil instead of butter.  I also added minced garlic and pepper flakes at step 3 instead of garlic powder.  The first time around I used green peppers, but didn't like them.  This time around I used peas to maintain the colorful presentation...yum!!  Also, I added a little corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up.  A winner!

This was a really yummy alternative for making a meal out of chicken.  I did not use the cream, but substituted milk and cornstarch.  I also made my own cajun mix.  This dish had a nice little kick to it.  I will definitely make it again.

Just a bit of tweaking due to lack of ingredients and personal tastes.  I used all red pepper since I don't like green.  Also used fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream.  Also added garlic after sauteeing the mushrooms and peppers.  Omitted the cajun dredging and simply salt and peppered some frozen tenderloins from Costco.  Lastly, served everything over a bed of low carb pasta.

This dish was very simple and very tasty. I, too, used half and half and mixed some flour in before adding to skillet. I also added some parmesan while dish was cooking. The sauce thickened up perfectly after about ten minutes. I used Emeril's Bayou Blast (or something like that) and the level of spiciness was just right. Definitely a keeper!

This is my boyfriend's absolute favorite dish, which I have made for him using this recipe about 5 times now. I have found that adding some cornstarch right at the end of cooking thickens the sauce (flour would work too). I just eyeball the amount though because I don't really follow measurements very well. As for Cajun seasoning, I find that the brand I have is not spicy enough, so I usually concoct something appropriately spicy to rub on the chicken before cooking. I always use chicken breat tenderloins or cut up the breasts myself, and I usually use about 1 pound-- you really don't need any more, what with the veggies and pasta. I add a whole 8 container of sliced mushrooms, and as much sliced bell peppers as I can fit in my skillet. Very good recipe, my boyfriend thanks you many many many times (I like it, but I don't care much for cream sauces). Oh, and I have used half and half with some success in place of the heavy cream as well. If you thicken it, the flavor is not much affected by the substitution.

Excellent dish. The sauce is a little runny, and I'll be looking for a way to thicken it up, but the flavor was superb. I have realized there are wide differences between what different spice distributors coin as "Cajun Seasoning". My boyfriend had some no name brand which looked, smelled and tasted like Italian Seasonings. The one I have home, I believe, is made by McCormick and looks similar to chili powder. It's loaded up with various peppers and other goodies. If you find that this dish is too salty, I highly suggest replacing your brand of Cajun Seasoning with another - as the difference between brands can be extreme. I served this over rotini vs linguini simply because the curls in the pasta hold the sauce better.

Oh MY! This was one of the BEST recipes I have ever made! My Swedish fiance LOVED it!!!! He couldnt stop with the compliments! We didnt find this salty at all as others had. I used Louisiana Cajun seasoning because I was out of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning. We forgot to add the cheese on the first serving. But he went back for seconds adding the chesse then. I tried it with the cheese and I will say it really doesnt need the cheese. This dish made a very nice presentation and we will be making this many more times! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This was excellent.  My pregnant wife who is not eating very much ate every bite.  I will cut the chicken pieces into smaller pieces next time and probably won't use red bell pepper unless I'm serving for company since they are more expensive.

Thanks for a great recipe. This was just wonderful. I doubled the recipe and cut the chicken into bite size pieces. I also added more
green onions. Next time I fix it I'm going to use
shrimp, yum!

This was very good, but to us was sorta plain tasting.  I added twice the called for cajun seasoning and a BUNCH more salt and garlic powder.  With those additions it was a nice dinner.

My husband raves about this dinner! It's become the number one requested dish in our house. Even my 2 year old will eat parts of it. I have been searching high and low for a cajun chicken pasta like I remember from my favorite cajun restaurant.  I like this one better! Wonderful!

I just LOVE this recipe!  It's tastes great and the flavor was just terrific!  I agree though with the other posts.  To much cream...I had to pour some of it out because of it.  Next time I will have to cut it down.  I'm thinking that with the amt required per serving I think I'll just use 6/8 of it.  But it still is definitely one that I'll want to make again.  My picky boyfriend loved it too. ^_^

This is a great but heavy recipe.  Because of this I tend to save it for special events and refuse to use anything other then heavy cream. It's also great with salmon instead of chicken, which was the way I prepared it. (I also took out the mushrooms)

I really like this recipe.  I made it low-cal (low fat) by using fat free sour cream instead of heavy cream, and reduced-fat parmasean.  It was really just as wonderful as the original.

This is excellent.  My husband doesn't normally like cream sauce or pepper, loved this.  I used the lemon pepper and cajun spices without salt, and added about 1/2 tsp of salt. I used 1/2 & 1/2 and 2 tbl of cornstarch.  I also added the parmasan directly into the sauce.

My whole family loves this dish. For our variation, we add zucchini and squash. We use very little cream, and serve it over wild rice. With a side salad and rolls, dinner is on the table in no time.

This was pretty good.  I added more cajun spices and had to use half and half instead of cream (our pitiful grocery store was out of cream).  I made it a second time with shrimp too, and it was good that way too.

I found a less fattening way of making this dish that still tasted like a rich cream sauce, instead of two cups of heavey whipping cream I only used about 2T and that was to just mix the corn starch and then i mixed the heavey cream with fat free 8oz sour cream with a small amount of parm. cheese. The sauce came out creamy and very yummy. and im sure it had to have less then 113g of fat per serving.

This was incredibly easy and flavorful - I chunked my chicken breasts prior to cooking for ease of eating as well.  I added extra cajun seasoning for an extra spicy flavor.

This was really, really tasty, and it made fantastic leftovers as well.  Next time, I would use less whipping cream, however, because it came out a little thin.  The other thing was that it made about 4 times as much as I thought it would!

This is a great recipe.  Fairly easy to make too.  The sauce is a little runny, I suggest thickening it with flour or cornstarch.

I really loved this recipe.  I made it even quicker by using the pre-cooked chicken strips.  Everyone in my family loved this and accused me of getting take out from an Italian restaurant.  It is a keeper!!!

My husband and I went crazy over this, after I added sun-dried tomatoes!  It could be a little more spicy for it's namesake, but otherwise it was perfect!  I would definitely recommend the sun-dried tomatoes though!

The flavors were really good. I used lemon juice and cut the butter. I just sprayed my pan with avocado oil. I added spinach instead of mushrooms.

My boyfriend LOVED this!! Disclaimer:  I made some adjustment since I made this on a whim after searching for recipes to use my red bell pepper and diced onion.  I sautéed the diced onion and bell pepper until the onions softened and became translucent and added a handful of sun dried tomatoes. Didn’t have green peppers or green onion but I don’t really care for them.  I also added spaghetti squash to add some extra healthy fiber and bulk to the dish (halved, pitted, baked 425 F for 35 min, forked into strands).  I turned the heat to low and added sour cream instead of heavy cream and it turned out GREAT.  My boyfriend took one bite and said “Oh babe this might be my new favorite dish of yours”.  Best of all, the healthy adjustments worked out great!

I added a heavy half-pound of andouille sausage so the serving yield was more like 4-6. It was delicious but like all cream sauces didn't reheat well, so next time I would make just enough to serve one time.

Personally I did change the recipe and added some cayenne pepper to the chicken while I sauteed it. Thanks for the recipe.

Yum - added a can of mild green chili's. Tip don't forget to keep your pasta moist while mixing the chicken and veg. I didn't have all the ingredients but did have the important mains and built off the recipe. V good. Also, I used Trader Joe's chipotle lime seasoning I didn't have Cajun alone.

Recipe is wonderful exactly as provided. If you like a little more heat, add a tsp of red pepper flakes when cooking the pepper and add a can of Rotel with the cream (I decreased the cream by 1/4 cup).

This was really good. I had some leftover rotisserie chicken and some leftover noodles. Just threw them in the pan with a diced red pepper, a few mushroom and spices as listed. I used a cup of half and half instead of cream as that's what I had. This could not have been easier and it was so delicious. It was a little more peppery than I anticipated so id probably leave black pepper out next time so my kids would eat it too. I will definitely make this again.

I made this dish for family that came in from out of town; to feed all 10 of us- I used 6 chicken breasts, sliced, then halved, shaken in a bag with Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning, also added 1 more red bell pepper, 8oz of mushrooms, and a tomato (I had almost a whole one leftover from breakfast) I substituted half and half instead of heavy cream (because that’s what I had on hand) and added a couple spoonfuls of sour cream to the sauce. Also added a tablespoon of flour mixed with some half and half in a slurry to the sauce, because I was worried it would be too thin, but I don’t think it was necessary after all. Definitely a crowd pleaser- everyone went for seconds, and we had nothing left over!

I could eat this every single day.  Everyone I've made it for loves it including my kids.  Quick to whip up but tastes like all day prep.  I can't even guess how many times I've made it.  I don't change anything major about it except how much of the spices because at this point I'm liberal with them and don't measure.  I put lemon pepper and Cajun spices on the chicken while it cooks and I add Cajun seasoning to my pasta water and add  everything originally called for in the cream mixture while it all simmers as the noodles boil.

perfect just as written! I sprinkled extra cajun seasoning over everything because we like a little extra heat and allowed it to simmer to let the sauce thicken a bit before serving , but thats a personal preference

This is so good!!! I don’t eat onions so I didn’t add those! But I did add yellow and orange peppers as well! I made double the portion and chopped up chicken. I added a little bit of mozzarella! I used olive oil instead of butter. Also couple more spices to match the flavors my family likes!! I will for sure be making this again!

Loved it! 

The only thing I did differently was coat the chicken with a little bit of olive oil along with the seasoning to make the chicken moist and tender.

Wonderful! I used chicken thighs instead of breast bc I like the dark meat flavor. My family loved this and I made a batch without the chicken for my daughters who are vegetarian. They loved it as well.

We loved it the first time i made it. i would suggest either shredding the breast into larger chunks or removing it from the pan and doing the pasta. Next time will also add a bit more cream, as there wasnt much left over to reheat.

The lemon pepper ruined the dish. I was sooo sad. I think i might try it again and just. It out in the lemon pepper. All the other flavors seemed to mesh well except that one.

Kind of reminds me cheese cake factory’s Cajun pasta but a great alternative. I baked the thin cut chicken slices in the oven at 400 for about 35 min. Used blacked Cajun seasoning on the chicken. Only thing I did differently with the pasta is add 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan instead of 1/4 cup because more cheese the better, duh.

I am allergic to cow dairy (hives, anaphylaxis, the whole bit) so I had to use coconut cream and smart balance “butter,” nevertheless, my husband gobbled it up. I loooved it too. I’m sure it would’ve been even better with actual dairy, but I have to eat good food too! I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Followed it exactly as it was written except that we used fresh basil instead of dried since we had it in the garden.  My husband likes spicy food so he added some cayenne pepper to taste and we both LOVED it. Will make this again and again. Our go to dinner when we want to eat pasta!

Amazingly delicious!!!
I followed your exact recipe and we loved it. Extremely easy and fast.
I have made it a few more times (that's how much we love it, even my very picky daughter that doesn't eat anything) a couple of times without the chicken and it was still delicious the only difference was I put a tsp of the cajun sauce in the sauce because we love a little spice.

My mother in law and I decided to make this on our way home from work and we happened to have all of the ingredients except heavy cream.  We followed the instructions almost exactly except we basically doubled the recipe and added more spice than it said to. Instead of using heavy cream, we used approximately 3/4 cup of sour cream and a splash of whole milk, put the lid on it and let it simmer for a few minutes. Everything was so good. We didn't use very many noodles because we were trying to keep it as healthy as possible. The chicken turned out perfectly tender as did the vegetables. We will definitely be making it again soon.

So very, very good, and very easy! Just a caution, check the sodium in your Cajun seasoning before adding more salt.

Truly an excellent dish! It also makes a good amount too! I made a few minor adjustments to the recipe: added about a tablespoon of flour to thicken the sauce, used only half or each pepper, and used 1/4 tsp more Cajun seasoning than in the recipe to give it some more flavor. I will def be making this again.

Yes, was too thin.  I added corn starch at last minute.  Will probably use flour to thicken next time.  It was very tasty.

Great recipe. I substituted Coconut milk for the heavy cream to cut the fat. It worked like a charm. Take the can of coconut milk , place in the fridge overnight and prior to use, pour the juice out and use just the stiffness of the cream.

I wanted to get into cooking since its something I've neglected doing for a very long time.  This was such a great recipe to start with and was so delicious.  I substituted the Cajun seasoning with Chile Lime Seasoning Blend I found at Trader Joes; it worked out perfectly.  The cream sauce really makes this dish come together.

Delicious! Make the full fat version as the recipe calls for and use butter. I didn't have lemon pepper seasoning so I opted for a squirt of lemon with some freshly ground pepper. As one reviewer already suggested, next time I will make a little roue for a thicker sauce. Still it was very tasty!

Awesome dish. I doubled up on the sauce and had half the green and red peppers the recipe called for, and baked some chicken tenderloins that I sliced into 1" slivers... 

Came out awesome and fed a family of six. 

Thank you for the recipe! I will be making it again!

This was amazing! I ended up doubling the recipe but did not have enough cream so I threw in some Classico four cheese fettuccine sauce and it was delish! I also subbed celery instead of mushrooms because that is what I had on hand.

Second time making this recipe in quite some time.   It was BETTER than I remember! Still delicious and no shortcuts.  I added extra veggies for the "Health" factor that just made it more irresistible! Will definitely make it again!

I made this for a very picky eater - my husband! The only thing I had to substitute was green onion. Not one green onion to be found in this town! So I used a small regular onion and it was really good! Hubby gave it a thumbs up, said I should make it again!

Super easy and so yummy! We have this 1-2 times a month. I reserve a little bit of the pasta water for the sauce and cut the chicken into strips. I also omit the mushrooms :( ... husbands preference not mine! I was nervous about the lemon pepper at first because I don’t use it that often and it’s usually on catfish but all the seasonings worked great together.

I thought the calories were a tad high for one serving. But it says this dish makes 2 servings. I got 5 servings out of this dish which brought the content way down. I might use half and half next time. 
Definitely delicious and will make again!

If was good for people who can't eat stuff without a lot of heat/spice I made 4 servings . I love stuff with a kick so add  more spice! If I do it again I will add more heat and maybe change out for dark meat  or sub it out for shimp!

Wohoo! First Cajun dish ever, and it was a HUGE success! 
This is very easy to control the amount of heat the dish has. You have complete control of the Cajun seasoning.
 I didn't have cream, so I used milk and sprinkled flour in until it was thick enough. 
Didn't have lemon pepper, so I added fresh ground peppercorns and lemon juice. 
Didn't have garlic powder, so I just added minced garlic to the mix.
Didn't have linguini, so I used penne pasta.
Didn't have green onion, so I used chives and yellow onion. 
*Also added ½ pound of shrimp to the 2 chx breasts... Sooooo yummy! 
Could easily use rice or potatoes for all the people wanting to have a gf option.

Definitely salt to taste after serving. I liked a little more salt but my French hubby loved this as is! I didn't have a couple of the seasonings so I just substituted with other spicy spices and it turned out just fine!
The sauce will be a bit thin since it IS just heavy cream but it mixes in with all the ingredients very well and isn't soupy.

I have made this dish for my family a million times. I have made a few changes, or example adding more cajun seasoning (just because I like the spice) and maybe adding more peppers specially yellow ones for the color. My husband loves it and it is safe to say he is a picky eater.

I used orange bell pepper, asparagus and drained artichoke hearts.  Omitted green pepper, mushrooms and substituted half snd half for heavy cream. It was delicious. Next time will use home made Cajun spice as the prepared was a bit too salty.

My family LOVES this...I have made it serval times.  I usually add a little more veggies to the dish, sometimes asparagus, or more bell pepper.  I also double the cajun spice, as my family likes things spicy.  My son asks me to make it at least once a month!  Super easy to make!

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I can think to change is just to cut the chicken into smaller pieces, as opposed to halves. Regardless, it was well received in my household!

This recipe was a keeper!  The only changes I made was to substitute olive oil for butter and fresh
minced garlic for garlic salt.  I probably used a bit more cajun spice.  :)

I just made this recipe for the second time. I made it exactly as submitted. My first go round I rated it four stars, but now I am rating it five. We love this dish and I will definitely make it again. Hats off, once again, to the ingredient search function in Allrecipes. I found this recipe because I had  jar of Cajun seasoning in my pantry and I wanted to use it up. What a great find - I'll have to by more Cajun seasoning soon!

Thank you for posting a quick and easy to make dish!  I only had half and half on hand but it provided a rich and creamy sauce.  This is an awesome and tasty dish!  Completely agree with another review that this is a restaurant quality recipe.

I made this and it was fantastic. I am making it again but, I’m swapping the linguini for penne because it is my favorite pasta. I used fresh garlic and it came out great!

This was really good! I couldn't find cajun seasoning, so I just used rotisserie chicken seasoning and lemon pepper. I was skeptical about just using cream for the sauce, but it was excellent. I'll probably use about 1/4 cup more cream next time and a little less pepper.

First of all you have to double the recipe.  My family loves it with bow tie and tonight penne rigate pasta. In other words,  it doesn't matter what type of pasta. Your family will love it.

I didn't have cajun spice, so I used Creole, which worked just as well.  My entire family loved it!

My family LOVED this!!! I added the spices in with the chicken while browning in butter, and put the veges in last, and cooked until tender (putting a lid on it helped speed it along). I used Alfredo sauce from a bottle and added the whipping cream to it.  I cooked the linguine separate, sauce separate, and the chicken and veges.  I poured the sauce into the linguine and topped with chicken and veges. MMMM good.

I feel that saying you made changes is not the same as saying something against the recipe you are following. I never go by exacts when it comes to seasoning, but I can say this combination of ingredients/seasonings was a hit with my husband.
Sometimes I make it with shrimp; starting the vegetables and then adding the shrimp and cream. Usually I add extra spicy seasoning.
I have found the cooking times to be accurate and tend to use almost this exact recipe as well as my own variation a couple times a month or so.
Some of my variations: shrimp instead of chicken, extra Cajun seasoning, adding some corn starch to the cream to thicken the sauce.

My hubby doesn’t care for spice so I didn’t add that ingredient but I seasoned it as if I was making regular chicken and I added shrimp. Love love loved it!!

Absolutely loved it! Tips: Cook the noodles as instructed, to al dente, not more! Do NOT cook the noodles with oil, just the salt. This way the noodles will absorb some of the sauce. I used 1/4 tsp. garlic powder instead of 1/8, and I did not turn down the heat until I was ready to add the linguine. Leaving the heat at medium and stirring intermittently will allow the sauce to thicken since it’s heavy cream. This kept it from coming out runny. If you’re looking for a really spicy dish though, then you’re going to want to add something with more of a kick, like a jalapeño or something similar. Enjoy!

First of all, thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I have made it now six times and it is one of my family's favorites, getting me the nicest compliments.  After preparing it a couple of times, I make the following changes which improved the dish quite a bit for out taste.
1. I cut the chicken breast in quarter inch slices and sauteed the slices in two batches for about 4 minutes so the chicken came out evenly cooked and still tender and juicy.
2.  I doubled the amount of cajun season for the chicken.
2.  I used a pound of mushrooms and 4 large peppers to create a better (for us) ratio of meat/veggies.
3.  I used about a cup of chicken broth to extent the sauce a bit.  Adding the parmesan cheese, either freshly grated or store bought, will thicken the sauce enough to make it perfect for your linguine.  
Please try the original or my version.  You will not regret it.

I made this for the first time and it turned out AMAZING!
The only thing I did was substitute the green onion for sliced red onion. This was sooo good!

Very tasty,  I made my own cajun seasoning since I didn't have any.  If you like spicy this wasn't spicy at all.  So you might want to add more chili flakes and cayenne pepper if you like it hot.   I also didn't have heavy cream so I just used milk, It still turned out nice. I added more parmesan cheese to thicken it up a bit.  I will make it again.

My husband made this tonight and it was excellent, the best pasta dish I've ever had. He added regular onions, fresh garlic and did tri color sweet peppers. Took a small plate to my parents and they were raving, asking for the recipe. Will definitely be making this every once in a while. My 5 year old even liked it!

The only changes I made was 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup fat free milk with a tablespoon cornstarch. Didn't add mushrooms and had no lemon pepper so I used black pepper.

Came out very yummy!! Will surely make again and again!!

Delicious as is!! Everyone ate it up. I made it with home made noodles and everything went together so well. Next time if I were to make it again I would probably add some spinach And maybe a pinch more of Cajun seasoning but that's it!

Very good! My boyfriend and I made this for dinner recently and we really liked it. Used penne pasta noodles instead of linguine. Also didn't have Cajun seasoning but had most of the spices except for garlic powder and lemon pepper, so we just chopped up garlic and added some lemon juice (probably not the proper way to make up for those spices, but still tasted good). I had an overripe tomato too, so I diced it up and tossed it in with the rest of the veggies. My boyfriend also added extra cayenne pepper and black pepper, so a bit hotter than what's called for -- still good! I'll definitely try making this again.

YUM!  Loved everything about this recipe!  The heavy cream sauce makes it for me.  I added extra parmesan cheese because I like it but followed the recipe exactly as written.  It wasn’t overly spicy but did have a kick to it.  Will 100% make again!

My whole family loved it!! My 4 year old daughter asked for seconds, and that never happens. My husband would have liked a little more spice, so next time I might add a little more garlic powder and cajun seasoning. I will definitely be putting this into our regular menu schedule. Thank you Carol Spradling.

First, let me say that I follow recipes exactly as written except when I don’t have one of the ingredients. For this one, I didn’t have Cajun seasoning so I used taco seasoning. I also use more butter than is ever recommended so I probably doubled that. Other than that I kept to the recipe and it was absolutely delicious. 

Thanks for a great, quick mid-week dinner!!

I added extra seasoning and Cajun seasoning when I added the cream to the pot. I used spinach and white onions instead of mushrooms and green onions. Also doubled the potions..

Delicious!!! I used 4 boneless chicken breast cut up coated with the cajun seasoning ...sauted in 4  tablespoon of butter until almost done then added 1/2 a bag of frozen green, red pepper and onion strip mix.  Used 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2...I didn't use the lemon pepper seasoning...I left the other seasonings the same... I used whole 16 oz box of linguine and 3/4 -1 cup shredded parm cheese.  This meal was fabulous.

I didn't have the green pepper, onion and mushrooms so I substituted zucchini along with the red peppers. It was a little too spicy for my one daughter so if I make it again I will cut back on the Cajun seasoning. Very easy to make.

My family loves this.  One time I started to make it only to discover I was out of Cajun seasoning and lemon pepper, I made my own seasonings.  I won't ever go back to using the store seasonings.  It is so much better when I use fresh lemon zest and blend my own Cajun spices.  I also like to add a tablespoon or two of Marsala wine and reduce it while cooking the peppers.  Yum.

Second plate was better than the first, I would let it sit and the sauce thicken before serving. Otherwise great recipe.

I have made this a few times and everyone in the house loves it!  I have also successfully substituted Sweet Italian Sausage for the chicken; the sausage adds a different spice flavor from the cajun seasoning when you get a bite of it.

I forgot the green pepper so I used Red and Yellow. I made it kid friendly (my kids hate vegetables) so I cooked the peppers and mushrooms really soft so that it would blend into the dish.  Used chicken tenderloins to cut down on having to cut up chicken (needed a little more butter for the veggies as the tenderloins was thicker) and I thought it would be more filling. When  time to serve just chucked up the tenderloins  with a woooden spoon.  Easy clean up I used a deep cast Iron skillet and a tall boiling pot. ( The kids did the cleaning)  Easy recipe inexpensive easy clean up. Over all a hit ???? for my picky eaters.
 Read some reviews that was negative just wanted to add some tips I did. First I seasoned the tenderloins in a plastic zip lock with salt,pepper cajun and garlic. I let it sit for a hour in the fridge before browning cooked in a cast  iron skillet on med then after about 7 mins put on low and let it simmer then add veggies back on med hi then turned off heat and let the heat from the skillet continue cooking the chicken and veggies while pasta cooked when the pasta was almost done then I turned heat back on to about med low and added the cream and seasoning mixture. Added pasta let cook for about 7-10 mins

We really enjoyed this meal, but I made a lot of changes to the recipe. The most important are probably procedural:
1) When draining the pasta, reserve the pasta water. 
2) Once the chicken is cooked, pull it from the pan (wrap in foil to retain heat). 
3) Return the chicken to the pan when you add the pasta. 
4) If the sauce is too thin, add pasta water (1/4 cup for me) and simmer until thickened, keeping it a bit thinner than you want your final product to be. Then add the cheese.
5) Taste. Add salt/pepper/cajun seasoning/lemon juice or whatever else is needed.

Since it's in season, I added asparagus pieces to the chopped peppers and onions .  To thicken the sauce , I used flaked parmesan  as well as some frozen pesto and let it melt into the sauce during the last step.  
It was very good and very springlike.

I was not expecting this to be so good! I followed the recipe except I didn't have basil and used chicken cutlets. It's flavorful and easy. My husband went back for seconds and the pan it was made in will be easy to clean cuz it's empty!

Made this last night! Just like everyone said, its definitely restaurant quality!!!!!!! I did add more Cajun seasoning per the reviews.  Since I doubled up the recipe for more servings, it then increased the whipping cream to 3 cups.  I bought 1 16oz bottle of heavy whipping cream, and to make myself feel better, I bought a fat free half and half, and used a cup of that to equal out 3 cups.  Like some reviewers said, it was a  little watery. I even cooked it a little longer, so I did add some cornstarch to thicken it.  Other than that I cooked it and added the other ingredients just like the recipe called for. It was sooo good! Easy, inexpensive, and good! I would recommend this for large parties as well. This is now my go to chicken pasta!

This is a great recipe! My family absolutely loved it.  I made a couple changes, and like a few others, I didn't use the heavy cream. I also switched up the protein and used shrimp in place of the chicken. It turned out amazing, and we would totally make it again.

Restaurant quality recipe!  One of my favorite things to do  when I make this is watch the look on the face of someone who hasn't had it before when they take the first bite.  "Wow", and "this is great"  is usually heard.
The only thing I do differently is I saute mushrooms on the side ( not everyone at my house likes them) and put them on top of the pasta right before serving.

Delicious!  Made it with leftover chicken and added sun dried tomato paste. Definitely a winner. Next time might add some Cajun sausage as well.

Very good recipe. I incorporated the previous suggestions of fresh garlic and frozen roasted bell pepper and onion mix.  After sampling I definitely recommend doubling the cajun spice.  I also recommend sprinkleing in some flour to make a roux before adding liquids as it is too thin as directed.

This was very easy and delicious! I chose to use more of the cajun seasoning and more parmesan but overall a great meal and easy to make.

This was great. The only thing I would change would be to nix the extra pepper and just use the lemon pepper.

This was excellent, perfect for 2 with a little left over for a light lunch. Heavy cream didn’t make it heavy on the stomach. Made it as called for first attempt with wheat pasta, James loved it and rated it 5 stars. Just a tiny bit salty for me. Served with a simple salad and Chianti. Plan: Next time add grilled shrimp and sausage (have venison on hand) for 3meats

I'm vegetarian so I took out the chicken, added onion, minced garlic, and I didn't have mushrooms so I left those out as well. I also added a little garlic powder, turmeric,  crushed red pepper, and  more cajun seasoning. It was very good will definitely make again.

I use pre-grilled smoked chicken breast, sautéed fresh garlic with the cut chicken breast. Realizing I needed more butter, I added extra virgin olive oil. I used whipped cream and right before serving added the parmesan cheese to the mixture. Seemed to help with the thickening. We loved this recipe.

It was great! But I tenderized chicken breast and added an extra half cup of heavy cream. I think I would add full extra cup next time and I doubled the season.

I added sundried tomatoes to this and it tasted sooo good. I also used crimini mushrooms because they have more flavour. I mixed sour cream and table cream also. I will make this again for sure! Perfect for company even!

This was delicious. I doubled the recipe and used 16oz of pasta and there was still plenty of sauce. I also added shrimp because that seemed to add to the Cajun theme. The entire family loved it and we will make it again for sure.

I love this recipe my mom used to always make it and now I make it all the time while at college. Although I do prefer serving this on white rice more than noodles because it absorbs the sauce much better. I also subbed out the heavy cream for 2% milk and added some small salad shrimp which really make the flavour pop. With the bell peppers I usually use an orange, yellow and red because Walmart sells it in a cheap three pack.

I loved the taste. I actually may have made the sauce with to much fluid. I do like a more thicker sauce as opposed to a runny  or to much sauce.

I thought this was really tasty. Petty much just what I was looking for. I did make a couple changes to make it easier on myself. Plus I didn’t have Cajun seasoning. So I substituted creole. I wanted a bigger portion so I used 3 chicken breasts. Used about 3-4 tsps of the seasoning. I used a bag of frozen peppers and onions a whole pack of mushrooms and instead of making my own sauce I used a jar of Alfredo sauce. I used a whole box of fettuccine noodles and added season to taste. It was delish. Reminds me of T.G.I. Friday’s Cajun chicken pasta. ( which was what I was wanting )

Nice starting point to make this your own dish. I highly recommend adding a lot more spice and seasonings, otherwise it'll be a little bland.

Amazing! My picky kids loved it. A little spicy for my 2 year old but we pared it with jellow to cool her pallet and she loved it too! I cut the chicken into cubes but other than that I followed the recipe 100%. Will make again, probably next week.

A local restaurant has cajun chicken pasta on the menu. I love it when they actually get it right but they are rather in consistent. So I searched online and found this recipe. All I've changed is a small increase in the cajun spice and it's perfect. I may try angel hair pasta instead of linguine next time.  I know this will become one of my go to dishes.

This is just try right amount of spice and tasted great. I would love to find a way to make the sauce a little thicker and will probably add onion next time! Awesome recipe!

Used half & half cream instead of heavy cream (which I will also cut in half next time), and I used rice instead of pasta. Flavor was delicious!

This was a winner! I made some tweaks to my liking - Added more Cajun seasoning as well as cayenne and red pepper flakes (we like it SPICY). Also added a small can of mushrooms. I did not have lemon pepper on hand. I sautéed sliced onion with my bell peppers because, why not. Husband was super happy. I served this with cheddar herb biscuits and roasted garlic broccoli.

This recipe is delicious! The first time we made it we followed every ingredient and it was really good! The second time I made it I did not have heavy cream on hand so I used 1 cup of milk  mixed with about a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce. I had to cook the sauce a little longer but it turned out perfectly! I added about a teaspoon more of the cajun seasoning on the chicken and added some salt and pepper at the end to finish the dish!

It turned out great. Instead of just an cup of heavy  cream I added 1 and a 1/2  cups instead. I also added 2cup of fresh spinish cut thin,and  1 cup of  Sun dried tomatoes to give extra flavor. I let it simmer for about 10 to 15 min to thicken the cream. Lastly I added the noodles and it came out perfect..... If adding more cream I suggest to also double the ingredients.

It was wonderful! I added a little crushed red pepper just to spice it up a little. A little added bonus for me was that my daughter had JUST come from the hospital after having a baby girl so I think this will be added to the Family Recipe box under her name(-:)

I quickly put this together and it was yummy!!! I didn't have heavy cream so I just used milk and I didn't have any lemon pepper. I added sliced onions and chopped asparagus and used spaghetti noodles because I didn't have any fettuccini. Super easy and yummy!

Excellent flavor where ingredients compliment each other and none overpowers.  I used fresh basil and added 2 roughly chopped roma tomatoes because I have them both in my garden.

Family loved it.  Flowed the recipe but used half and half instead of heavy cream and added a little blackened seasoning to the spices suggested--very little.  Will make a little bit more next time as family members wanted more.

The flavor was subtle and delicious. The only thing I added was about a half more cup of heavy cream.  While I liked it, the lady I cook for is not a fan of red or green peppers. This is a dish I may have make for myself.

Made this for my girlfriend and I, and it was great! I did change up a few things though:

* Instead of heavy cream I used half and half. Granted, it isn't exactly that much healthier than heavy cream, but tried to cut where I could.

* I didn't have any red bell pepper available, nor mushrooms, so I ended up adding broccoli and serrano pepper (for extra kick).

* I ended up adding a bit more Cajun season during the cooking process with all of the vegetables because the chicken was a little bland. I think next time I would let the chicken marinate in the seasoning over night with a bit of olive oil.

* I saved about a quarter cup of the pasta water and added it in with the half and half when I mixed it with all of the ingredients.

One thing: make sure you have a big enough pan when you cook the chicken and veggies. I ended up cooking 3 chicken breasts, it was hard to add in the veggies to the same pan. Definitely going to be cooking veggies separately prior to adding it to the chicken.

I actually made life more difficult and grilled the chicken instead of making this a "one pot" sort of dish.  Definitely recommend and I also suggest letting it sit a bit! The cream will thicken and the flavors will develop more.

This recepeith is extraordinary but hey!!!! the chiken is way overcooked!!!!! If like me you like tender chiken, then cook your chiken and put it aside, youll add it once the cream is reduced. One other thing, if like me you want to use your whole package of mushrooms, you cant, i tried and it makes too much water. Once again, cook it seperatly and put it aside. Youll add it before to put the cream. Extraordinay!!!!!! :o) 

Ps: when you drain your pasta, keep the drained liquid. Youll poor your pasta with it before to serve, it improves the taste of it and your pasta will always looks fresh, not old, dry and sticky. Never put oil, your pasta will lose it taste.

This dish was a hit in my house. It was a little too spicy for me but I thought it was good. My husband & son however, loved it. I used red, green, yellow & orange bell peppers & accidentally forgot the parmesan. To me it tasted like a New Orleans dish. I will make this again.

Very tasty recipe! I may have to find a marinade for the chicken, didn't take much of the Cajun seasoning I used. Fiancée loved it and we had plenty of leftovers

I've made this two nights in a row and it's fantastic! I've added shrimp, scallops and chicken one time and shrimp, sausage and chicken the other. Both times were very tasty. I LOVE garlic so I added three spoonfuls of minced garlic to the meat before I sauteed it all.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times as written. I love seafood so I add shrimp to the mix so delicious. It's the one dish my husband goes back for seconds.

Yummy! This was my first successful pasta from scratch. A few things were unclear in the ingredients section. I'm a new cook and therefore I need more description on what type of heavy cream and Parmesan. Regardless, I was able to figure it out and the pasta was easy to make. Everything came out delicious! I recommend you try it out. However, I do have a question: how do I make it spicier?

Excellent recipe.  Only thing I'd add next time is either sun-dried tomatoes or add cherry tomatoes (halved) at the end.  Served with a side salad and garlic bread.  Already looking forward to tonights leftovers for lunch tomorrow. :)

Very good! I subbed canned coconut milk for the cream and used rigatoni noodles cuz we had some leftover from another meal. I'm a flavor lady so I'd add extra Cajun and pepper next time!

I almost rated the wrong recipe because there are two with the same identical name. The recipes are almost identical with slight changes.  Bot it is an excellent recipe and very tasty. Only change was to use rotini and came out great.  Next time I will cut the chicken into strips as in Tammy's version.  Will make this often. These 2 recipes should be labeled differently.

I sprinkled both sides of the chicken with cajun seasoning,  and baked it.  Sauteed the peppers and onions, added the seasonings and heavy whipping cream and it thickened perfectly.  I did add some cajun seasoning to the sauce.  Turned out excellent!

This was absolutely delicious!!!!! I added minced fresh garlic in addition to the rest and substituted whole milk for the heavy cream ONLY because it was the one ingredient I was missing. And O M G it was FABULOUS. I fully support the use of heavy cream tho, would have made a thicker sauce, but it tasted so fantastic it didnt matter to me!!!

Awesome  dish!   I doubled the Cajun seasoning because I like  Cajun things spicy, and I added a little Parmesan and a very small amount of corn starch to thicken it up during the cream-adding stage (based on reading reviews and notes from others before making it).  I also used whole wheat linguine, but will try semolina linguine next time to see if it makes it even better - if that's possible!

Perfect, refreshing dish that's easy to make on a busy weeknight. I closely followed the recipe...with some minor exceptions. My boyfriend and I are not a fan of mushrooms...so I subbed those out for chopped grape tomatoes. I also cut up the chicken into small pieces about five minutes in, for a more even cook. I used McCormick Grill Mates Cajun seasoning.

I used 1 lb gf pasta and 3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Also, 3 cups of  rice milk that I thickened with about 2 T. of potato starch.  Maybe 2 1/2.  Used a whole green pepper and about 1 1/3 red peppers and 8 oz fresh mushrooms.  tripled the spices except the cajun seasoning which I just generously sprinkled on both sides of the chicken before cooking in the cast iron pan.  We all liked it!

I cut the butter with olive oil and omitted the red bell pepper and green onion. I also substituted shrimp for chicken and half & half for heavy cream. Instead of the random seasonings toward the bottom of the list, I used copious amounts of Old Bay, and I used more Cajun seasoning than the recipe called for. The flavor was really nice, but I think my mistake was using an entire package of linguine; other reviewers complained of the sauce being too thin, and I thought I could solve that problem by adding more pasta. I think half a package would have been perfect, but all the pasta I used just soaked up all the sauce leaving it a little too dry.

This was very good.  I used 1 pound of thinly sliced chicken breasts and cut them into bite size pieces.  I guessed on the amount of linguine noodles.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream (w/a small amount of cornstarch for thickening).

Very good! I adjusted to my take, a little less peppers, a little more mushrooms.

Few Edits:
1) Lightly saute chicken in butter and seasoning, remove and place aside.
2) Cook veggies and garlic together in fresh addition of butter. Season liberally.
3) Add 1 tbsp of flour and cook until the bitterness is gone
4) Add 1/2 cup of white wine
5) Re-Add chicken.
6) You can add spinach... The whole bag
7) Add al dente pasta
8) Add 1/2 cup water and the heavy cream
9) Double the cheese
10) Simmer to thicken sauce to desired consistency.

Comes out a billion times more creamy

I've made it without the green peppers and so added an additional red pepper.  I think it is pretty yummy and will make it again.

Delicious! The only thing I changed was that I added more vegetables, and I removed the chicken and vegetables from the pan to let the sauce simmer on its own before tossing everything together. Super easy meal to make!

I made this tonight for the first time. Both wife and son liked it and want it again. I'd like to try it with some peas and/or broccoli thrown in. The sauce was thin, but not overly so. I did add extra cajun seasoning to spice it up a bit. We will definitely try it again.

I made this dish with shrimp instead of chicken and fresh green beans instead of mushrooms and my family loved it!!! Easy recipe that you could throw in whatever you have on hand...that's what I love about it.

One of the best meals I have ever made!  Love it!  I did keep it on the lowest setting to keep it warm for 15 minutes before eating it, while I waited for family members to arrive home.  Don't change a thing!  The recipe is perfect the way it is.

This was good. I doubled everything and quadrupled the seasonings not including the chili powder. Used half the seasoning with the chicken and the other half for the sauce.

It was sooo good! My husband is such a picky eater and he RAVED about this one! The only change I made was that I added some minced garlic before I added the chicken because I love fresh garlic. Wonderful flavor!

This was a delicious recipe. The flavors and textures were perfect. I am a persnickety about terms though, and this is not anywhere near Cajun. New Orleans?  Yes. Creole? Maybe. Cajun? No way. And Cajun is not a mix of French and Southern cuisine. It is an orphaned child of rustic peasant French cooking, left to itself  in the swamps of Louisiana for over 200 years, growing strange and delicious in its isolation.

Simply great.   I used the small penne pasta instead of linguine, a couple drops of lemon juice instead of lemon pepper, and a shallot instead of green onion.     Taking the advice of others I  add 1 T of butter  1 T of melted butter to create a rue for thickening  in my pan and used 1/4 cup of the pasta water to help the sauce stick to the pasta.    My husband said it was better than the one we've been getting at the restaurant.    Definitely going into our regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

This turned out lovely. Except I cooked the sauce separately, added cream cheese to the Alfredo sauce. Cooked it then added it to veggies. I will definitely make this again.

This is an awesome easy dish! No reason to substitute "lighter" ingredients. I have added cooked shrimp at the end and that worked well.

I have made this more times that I can count.  This is better that anything you can buy at a restaurant.  My whole family loves it!

My husband took one bite and said, "yep, I'd have this again".  It's a keeper!  We both agreed though that we didn't necessarily like the peppers so I think we'll be trying broccoli or spinach next time.  We did mix the Cajun seasoning with plain bread crumbs this time, so will try it without the bread crumbs next time, but I'm confident it will be just as good.  Great recipe!

This is a family favorite recipe, particularly for my teenage sons. I use chicken Andouille sausage in addition to chicken breasts and leave out the mushrooms. Also, since we have family members who require a gluten-free diet, I use gluten-free penne pasta. The other ingredients mix nicely with the shape of the penne, better than I think they would with longer pasta, but to be fair, I haven't tried any other pasta types.

This was a killer recipe!! So easy to make in a big ole wok, incredibly filling, and delicious. This was the first recipe I have made off of this website. 

I made this with 16 oz of linguine and multiplied most of the ingredient measurements by 4.
Different: Used two cups of cream. Used fresh garlic. 

Next time I would use significantly more garlic and double the amount of green onion and use a bit more peppers and mushrooms for a preferentially veggie-ful meal. A touch more seasoning would be preferred and I was slightly disappointed it didn't come out spicy. Adding some chili next time.  Overall excellent and excited to tweak to my preferences next time!

This was really good. Followed the recipe pretty closely except I cooked the chicken separately from the veggies and threw in a few cloves of fresh garlic. Whisked a tbsp of cornstarch w half and half before bringing it all together. Next time I might throw in some crushed red pepper in the sautée for a little extra kick and maybe some fresh basil as a garnish. Thanks Carol!

No changes and yes I will make it again but I recommend that you do not put your Cajun spices in a bag as this gives you to much spice.  I  would just use the dispenser and apply the spice to the chicken to your taste.

I've made this a gazillion times, it is fast, easy, and delish. If you're eating healthy, the chicken and veggies are delish sauteed per the recipe and eaten alone wo the cream and pasta!

It is impossible to make a meal to satisfy all 5 people in my family. They all loved it! There are so many things that you could do to add more "pop" to it, but my family does not go for "pop", so this was perfect.

Vague. There was no mention of slicing the chicken, I had to refer to the video. Only one green onion? I used the entire package. I also used chicken thigh filets. I do that for all chicken breast recipes. The end result was Excellent!

Turned out pretty good, although the proportions seem a bit off. I only used 1 pepper and I still thought it was too much. I wish I had seen the minced garlic suggestions, that sounds like a good addition.

New addition to the dinner rotation! (Although not often since it's not really super healthy.) Like others I found the sauce a little thin, so I made a slurry with corn starch and cold water and added it to simmering sauce slowly until I was happy with the thickness. I'm not a mushroom fan, so I didn't add that and my green pepper was going bad, so I used a yellow pepper and it went well with the recipe. Absolutely add real Parmesan!!!

This  recipe is amazing!!  I prepared it exactly as written.  My 12 and 13 year old girls were  almost drooling by the time it was done.  It smelled SO good.   The flavor was beyond my expectations!  And even better than that, for the left overs the next day, I sprinkled at little more Cajun Seasoning on it and added about 3/4 c. heavy whipping cream..... just as good warmed up as it was the first time.  This is definitely a keep and "fix again" recipe!!!!

Although pretty easy and relatively nutritious, I felt the combination of the lemon pepper with the Cajun seasoning was a little funky. Could be user error too ;).

Excellent recipe! It sounded so good, I decided to double the recipe, since we like leftovers. I used 3 large cloves fresh garlic, 1/2 tsp lemon juice & thickened the chicken/peppers/mushroom mixture with 1C low fat milk thickened with 2 T cornstarch. As that began to thicken, I added 2/3 C fat-free sour cream + enough milk to make 1C (mix together first). I tossed about 6 oz. linguine in with the sauce & served with freshly grated Parmesan. Super yummy!!

So good and so easy! My 5 year old ate his entire plate as well (he likes a touch of spicy, like sausage/pepperoni).  I used fresh garlic and lemon juice instead.  The noodles aren't spicy they have just enough flavor so they aren't bland.

This was a hit at my house with my family of 6. I followed the recipe exactly (using red/yellow peppers as I had them on hand). After the first bite, my daughter asked it for her birthday dinner.

This was delicious! The only changes I made were two. I used fresh garlic and put the full 1/4 cup of parm in the skillet as the last step. The sauce was too thin until then. After...perfection!

This was extremely good and very quick and easy to prepare. I chunked my chicken and sliced the rest of the veggies. I did add a clove of garlic because it was already out and I also added a half cup of pasta water. Other than that, this is going to be made over and over again.

Love this dish.     Changed it a little.   Added some more spices and cream so it has a more creamier taste. But I love love this.      The flavor is great.

I'd give it a 4&1/2 stars. I did a little adjustment by sprinkling a little crushed red pepper, instead of lemon pepper. I think it would be Fabulous with prawns, too. I chose to make my own pasta, which really set it off. I used slices breast, so had enough for 6 servings with enough left over for tomorrow's lunch for 1-3 people. I'll definitely make it again.

The only reason I dropped a star is for sauce thickness. The flavour, ingredients, and dish was phenomenal, just wish the sauce was a bit thicker. Thanks for the great recipe, will make again and add a bit of cornstarch at the end.

Family loved the recipe.  We left the cream out because a few of the family can not do dairy and it still was a great choice to make. We have substituted it with Coconut Milk and is excellent that way.

It was lovely. Made exactly as recipe was printed....but nowhere in the recipe does it instruct you to slice the chicken breast... I watched the video to answer that question. Might try some of the "changes" next time to save calories, but the original was wonderful.

This was a good, easy dish to make.  I cubed the chicken, then shook it in the Cajun seasoning.  After browning in olive oil, I removed it from the pan, and then sauteed the green peppers and mushrooms, adding onion slices.  I used evaporated milk instead of cream, and used spiral pasta instead of linguine.  (I made do with what I had on hand.)  It was a little spicy for my husband, but I thought it was just right.  I will be making it again.

I prepared this (almost) as written, and it turned out great.  I used gluten-free pasta out of necessity,  hoping that the Cajun seasoning would help mask whatever flavor the gluten-free pasta imparted, and it did.
Although I agree that freshly grated Parmesan cheese should be used on top for both flavor and presentation reasons, I added a tablespoon of  powdered Parmesan to the cream sauce to help thicken it, and it worked well.
Next time, I will increase the amount of mushrooms and green onions by half because I like veggies and think the recipe can support it.

Now that I've made this a few times, I've settled on using 1/2 c. sour cream instead of heavy cream and a little extra parmesan.  I also omit the mushrooms and only use 1 pepper (red).  Very nice, easy meal for the weeknight rotation.

Wow!! This turned out phenomenal! Only change we made is that we used three chicken breasts, so we increased creole spice a bit. I think we could have used a bit more pasta in the end product, but overall hubby and I LOVED this and will be making it again!

Made this tonight and my family absolutely loved it!!! I used penne pasta, just to hold the sauce better and for ease of eating for us.  Instead of the Cajun seasoning I used creole, and it was fantastic!! Used fresh squeezed lemon in place of the lemon pepper since I didn't have any.

Holy smokes was this delicious. I tried to keep to the recipe as much as possible but as I didn't have any cream I used 3/4 milk and 1/4 butter mixture. And even before then, I realized there wasn't any Cajun seasoning in the apartment so I ended up using a normal chili pepper, black pepper and salt to season the chicken. But I am not complaining! The taste was incredible and had that extra bite I just loved. The sauce was very liquid-y, but I felt that it was better that way, especially since thickened sauces are usually too heavy for me, and if I wasn't so full by the end I probably would have tried to lick the plate. Just an extra thing, I put 2 "stalks" of green onion into the mix but honestly it added a little crunch of freshness that I genuinely enjoyed that next time I might add more (also because I have a lot in the fridge that will just go to waste otherwise if not used).
Rating: A must make dish and a definite repeat offender.

This was really good, everybody in my family loved it and my son had seconds. I made a couple changes, but pretty much stuck to the recipe. I cut the chicken into strips and sauteed it in garlic olive oil with some onions then added shrimp. I used sweet peppers, mushrooms, and snap peas to add a couple more veggies to it. I used half a cup of half and half and seasoned it with a little bit of flower

It was great! We did a lot of doctoring. I used fresh garlic instead of powder, twice the specified amount of cayenne, gumbo file, double portions of green onion and peppers.

I did use this recipe as a foundation, I needed to use some andouille sausage as well. I cooked the sausage first then cooked the chicken added the vegetables and added grape tomatoes after the cream. It turned out very nice.

Overall, a great base for a mild Cajun Pasta dish. I would recommend mincing and sauteing 2 cloves of garlic. In the sauce stage, I'd add another tablespoon of cajun seasoning (and possibly a teaspoon or more Cayenne Pepper) then I'd add a full cup grated Parmesan to thicken and give it more of a spicy Cajun Alfredo sauce.

We are adding this to our list of favorites to make again.  I have a suggestion for those who do not like the consistency of the sauce.  Based on my experience  with making an Alfredo cream sauce, I simmered the cream and spices in a separate saucepan for  approximately 8 minutes , added the Parmesan, and then poured it over the vegetables and chicken.  I think this step improved the consistency of the sauce and we did not find it too thin. The change I would make next time is to double the sauce recipe, and I expect the simmering time to be longer.  Overall, we liked this one and felt like we were getting a dose of veggies in the meal as well.

Was wonderful.  Didn't really change anything except didn't have lemon pepper but didn't miss that.  I didn't realize you should have cut up the chicken breast, since that was not stated in the recipe but should have been smart enough to notice.  DUH!  But I cut it up and put it back in the pan and everything came out great.  Will definitely make this again.

Finally reviewing this recipe after many years of making it. In culinary school the students would run a restaurant and this always sold well. The spices were upped and we added anduoille sausage or cajun shrimp to order.

It was ok.  A bit disappointed with all the great reviews.  Maybe because the bell peppers were still crispy even though I followed the recipe to a T.

This recipe is absolutely perfect for two.  I used homemade Cajun seasoning for member Joslyn's recipe, and substituted orange bell pepper for the green one in the recipe. The taste is excellent and there was no heart burn one might expect from all the spices that go in the recipes making.  Simply put - -  DELICIOUS!

I agree with others who'd stated that the sauce was too watery; I added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. This was a tasty dish, however, very mild on Cajun flavors. I tripled the recipe; however, only used 1 of each green and red pepper.
Again, the recipe doesn't completely match the video; the recipe says nothing about slicing the half chicken breasts, but in the video, the chicken appears to be more like cutlets.

Delicious recipe with a nice kick to it. The Cajun seasoning I used had salt in it already so It ended up being a little too salty for me but still delicious. Tastes very similar to the Cheesecake Factory's Cajun chicken pasta

My husband, kids and grandkids LOVED this!  Since I tripled the recipe, I chose to bake the chicken breasts in the oven at 400º for 25+ minutes, sliced them thin, then continued on with the recipe as directed.  Instead of heavy cream, I used 2% milk and a little Half and Half — it was delicious!  A couple of minutes after I had stirred in the milk, the sauce was still pretty thin.  To thicken it, I mixed a little cornstarch in a little bit of cold water and added it to the sauce:  perfect!

Yes, I will make this again!  Thank you, Carol, for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I used chicken thighs and after cooking them in the butter i chopped them up. I ended up quadrupling the recipe and it came out fantastic! I have a VERY picky teenager who usually doesn't say much about meals but she raved about this one and ate 2 bowls!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I really liked this recipe as is.  Not too spicy since the cream helps cut down on the heat.  But enough flavor so that I can agree that it tastes like a cajun dish should.  I would recommend this recipe.  I'll be making it again.  Yum!

Everyone in my family thought  this was great.  I made a few changes:  cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces,  used lowfat 1/2 and 1/2  (1 1/2 Cups), some cornstarch for thickening the sauce, and substituted fusilli for the linguine because I didn't have any linguine, and added some minced garlic. It was delicious.  Next time I'll add more 1/2 and 1/2 because I like it a little saucier but that could be because fusilli  needs more sauce than linguine.  This one is great, and the amount of heat is dependent upon which cajun seasoning you use (I picked a slighty milder one than most as I don't like it too hot.)  Delicious!!!

Delishious!!   The only thing I did differently was to:
- double the basil
- remove chicken once partiallly cook
- excluded peppers
- cooked enough mushrooms to replace peppers
- whisked spices into cream and stirred into mushrooms
- added 1cup cherry tomatoes sliced in half  and 1 cup shredded Parmesan to thicken
- added chicken into creamed mixture until warmed
- Served with shredded Parmesan 

This recipe is so incredibly easy and unbelievably delicious!!  I know what I did different looks like a lot, but it truly isn't!  I will be making this dish on a regular basis.  My hubby said the "flavour was bang on!"  And he is an incredibly finicky eater!  

Congratulations Carol Spaulding for submitting such a fanstatic recipe!!!!  Thank you!!

Made this for my boyfriend who isn't easily excited about any food. On his second plate he said I could add this to his favorite list and make it whenever I wanted! Easy to make and so very good! I didn't substitute anything but the next time I believe we'll add one more chicken breast and more mushrooms. Thanks for sharing!

I left out the peppers & mushrooms since I knew my 16 year old wouldn't eat it if they were in. Toned down the cajun seasoning for the same reason. And I used leftover roasted chicken. Nice and simple, the hardest part was cutting up the leftover meat. Oh, and I added a bit of chicken broth just on general principles.

Wonderful. The only change I made was the addition of 1 tomato sliced into 8 pieces sliced top to bottom when I added the cream so it would be warm without being soggy.

This is definitely a repeat meal! The flavor was amazing. I would have to say it's restaurant quality. The only thing I did to alter the recipe was to thicken the sauce up a little bit. And it says it serves two but we have enough for another meal.

Really good! I used half and half instead of heavy cream and doubled the Cajun seasoning and garlic powder. Would add more mushrooms and green onion next time.

Great recipe.  The only change I made (because I was pressed for time) was I bought a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  I pulled it all apart and than seasoned with the Cajun seasoning, added to the skillet with butter and than added the veggies.  Perfect and took about half the time.  Yummy!

Excellent recipe with restaurant quality taste.  This will be a go to for our family.  i did forego the heavy cream for half n half.  i used a little less than the recipe called for and the last quarter cup of it i mixed in some cornstarch to help thicken the sauce just a bit.  Otherwise i followed the recipe as written and it was excellent.

Much better than I could have anticipated! The taste was awesome! I seasoned the chicken a week before I prepared the dish and placed it in the freezer. It was very easy to prepare. I will certainly make this again!

9/5/16:  Really good, was craving shrimp/cajun. Doubled recipe and Used olive oil instead of butter, 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream plus added a can of evaporated milk.  Added a can of peas, tomatoes with oregano, shrimp ( tossed in the last 5-10 minutes of cooking).  Next time might add 1/4 c of white wine.

I made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe as written and it was good but a little bland for our taste.  The second time I increased the Cajun seasoning on the meat by 1/2 tsp. and added 1/4tsp. Cajun seasoning to the cream when I boiled it down to thicken.  My husband liked it better the second time.   It was very good and I would make it again.

This did not turn out as well as I hoped. I doubt if I will make it again but if I do I will add more spices. I think a little cumin and more Cajun seasoning would help.

With all of the seasonings and such, you'd think there would be a whole lot more flavor.  Our family kept adding salt and pepper to give some flavor to it. Strange. I think freshly crushed garlic and more cajun flavor would have helped.

It was absolutely delicious! I didn't have the cajun seasoning but had all the ingredients to make my own so I used that. I ran out of lemon pepper so my dish didn't have any and I only had sour cream so I substituted it for the heavy cream and it came out awesome. The son and hubby gave me high fives at the dinner table and 4 days later and the they are already requesting/demanding it again!

Great easy recipe. Only thing I did was double the ingredients for the sauce and made a whole box of pasta.  I also used chicken tenderloins instead of the breast.

My daughter loves this!  Second time I made it vegetarian by adding tons of mushrooms instead of chicken.   Didn't have any heavy cream but added some alfredo sauce and some cream soup then thinned it out with milk.   Also did not add as much of the cajun spice... about half.   Really good!

I love this dish. I get this meal all the time at our local bar, so I was pleasantly surprised to get this recipe  in an email. I made it the next night and it was delicious. I did double the recipe since I was using a box of linguine   and added a couple of jalapenos sliced for a little kick.

Yummy!  My Cajun seasoning stuck to one chicken breast more than the others, so when I make this again, I'll skip the plastic bag and just sprinkle it evenly on each chicken breast.  Otherwise, the recipe was perfect just as written.

It was great! After a taste test, my husband added more cajun seasoning for an extra kick (He is from Texas).  Will definitely add this to my recipe repiotore.

I have made this recipe a few times.  We love it!
The last time I made it, I used olive oil (instead of butter), and a can of coconut milk instead of heavy cream (you can't taste the coconut with the Cajun spices).
I also just sprinkle the Cajun seasoning on the chicken after I cut it up instead of using a Ziploc bag.

This was a great sounding recipe, and the first run was delicious!!! The only change I made was to use a little extra Cajun seasoning because the amount specified didn't really coat the chicken well. Also doubled up on mushrooms. You have to like Cajun spice; but if you do, this is a great and relatively quick recipe. If you precut the peppers & onions, you can throw this together on a weeknight after work. It also reheats very well if you use a non-stick sauté pan.

Very yummy!  My family raved about this recipe, and I liked that it was very quick and easy to prepare.  I did not alter the recipe in any way.   I did use the recipe for Cajun seasoning from this site and it worked well.  Thanks for another great recipe!!

This is a great base for this sauce, consistency was too thin though. I whisked in some plain cream cheese till it was melted & mixed well then followed by sprinkling grated Parmesan on top.... Made it absolutely & amazingly delicious!!!!!! Definitely will be making this again but with shrimp next time, YUM!!!!!!

I used lemon zest instead of lemon pepper and 2 cloves of crushed garlic instead of garlic powder.   I also added a seeded jalapeño pepper for a kick.  I make a lot of Italian dishes but my husband has declared this his new favorite!  Bravo!

My version replaced the chicken with cod fillet and cream of shrimp and smoked oysters. Also added dried Wasabi peas for garnish and exotic flavor.

Everyone loved it!!  I actually marinated the chicken in a zip lock with the cajun seasoning and a little olive oil for about an hour in the fridge.  I cooked the chicken then removed it and cooked the veggies adding chopped garlic (I also diced the peppers).  Then put it all together and added the spices and cream.  Then I used freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  So good.

*I didn't measure the cajun seasoning I just poured it in and used a package of thin sliced chicken breast not thick breasts

I did not have onion stems so I used a small yellow onion also I had on hand light creme instead of heavy creme.   Other wise I followed the directions fully. 
The dish was very savory. The taste was  very good. I will definitely make it again!!!

Delicious.  Used garlic cloves and splash of lemon juice..  Substituted cream for sour cream.  Seemed too dry.  Will use cream next time.

My husband loved this! I made a couple of small changes based on preferences and what I had.  I rubbed the chicken breasts with some turmeric and Tony Chachere's creole spice blend. Too, I added some parmesan to the sauce - just a little. I sliced the breasts into strips, and I used real onion and garlic to saute  the chicken in a little olive oil. Other than that, I used the other ingredients, especially the cream. It's a nice dish and so quick and easy! He's already asking for it yet AGAIN.

Great quick dinner.....the only change I made was to substitute the heavy cream as it is not something that I stock. I added light cream cheese with milk that I had on hand. Turned out great. Leftovers also freeze well

Disclaimer-I didn't make the recipe as written.  I had planned to have a shrimp with penne pasta dinner and was looking for something a bit spicy or creamy rather than red sauce based.  This sounded perfect and it was.  Made pretty much as written, but substituting reduced fat evaporated milk for cream, shrimp for chicken and penne for linguini. My husband doesn't usually like the pasta mixed into the sauce, but he had two helpings of this.

I made this with penne, fresh garlic and fresh lemon. It was a big hit. I did add more Cajun seasoning just because I like a little more heat. I used the heavy cream. Don't expect an Alfredo consistency. If you let it simmer a bit with unrinsed pasta, it does thicken a bit.

This was delicious!! This was easy and relatively quick. The only substitution we made was using half and half instead of heavy cream, which makes for a less rich and lighter sauce consistency, but it still tasted amazing! We also mixed in some cheese at the end of cooking time, instead of just sprinkling on top, which helped thicken the sauce a bit. Great dish, can't wait to make it again!

Everyone loved it.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half.  The sauce was watery so I used cornstarch the thicken it at the end.  I doubled everything and used a whole box of linguine (family of 4) and had 2 good sized portions left over to freeze.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was DELICIOUS. Super easy to make. Next time I will add a little more mushroom and green onion. Will also try it with half & half instead of cream just to try and cut the fat content a bit - although it probably won't cut it by much! My husband and boys loved it as well so it's a keeper.

I used sour cream in stead of the cream, I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes as well... added capers as well! It was great and will make again!

First time I made this recipe "As is" and it was delicious. "...a symphony of flavors!" is what my husband called it, (giggles)
Really tasty.  I'll work on a low fat version next time.

This was fantastic! We used EVOL instead of butter, and rotini instead of linguini, and the pasta soaked up all the sauce. We will definitely cook this dish again! Can't wait for lunch and leftovers!

This was simply delish. I used a red pepper, a small sweet onion, mushrooms  and zucchini for my veggies. Made the Cajun seasoning recipe from AR . Love garlic so finely minced a large clove  and threw it in toward the end of cooking the chicken. Added about a tablespoon of flour to the spiced covered chicken befor cooking. This helped to thicken the sauce as well as I saved a bit of the pasta cooking water to add to the sauce since I used non-fat half and half too. I put sbout a tsp of the cajun seasoning in the cream sauce which took it up a notch.  I'm sure I'll make this again and again. Might vary pasta and veggies, but the basics are a great building block for an awesome dish. Thanks for posting.

This was much better than I'd expected.  I have to say, I loved it.  I'd make it again in a heartbeat.  My picky 13 year old girl loved it and my picky 3 year old enjoyed it as well, eating most of what was on her plate.  I do admit to making small changes.  I  subbed sour cream for the heavy cream, added baby broccoli and chopped the mushrooms up into bits so my kids wouldn't know what they were.  Ha!  I also added fresh basil.  My husband wasn't home for dinner and he'll be sorry!  I do have a little leftover though.  Unless I beat him to it.  : )  OH, one last thing...I used Zatarain's Creole Seasoning instead of Cajun seasoning...because that was what I had on hand.  I'll have to try Cajun seasoning next time and see what the difference is.

Fantastic base recipe and a favourite for both me and my husband.  First two times I made as written and then played around with ingredients to more suit our tastes exactly.  It is absolutely heavenly !  Thanks for sharing this one !

Loved this, easy and quick.  I made no changes, but really had a hard time using heavy cream. I think I will try it with half and half next time.

Absolutely delicious!! My husband said this was in the top 5 dishes that I've made and I make a lot. My daughter, who rarely eats anything heavy, had two servings. The only substitutions I made were to use fresh basil instead of dried and I added the parmesan (doubled portion) in with everything else instead of just as a topping. I also added fresh cilantro on top, just because I love fresh cilantro. Definitely will be making this again, soon.

yumm!  this is really good.  I followed the recipe except I used fresh garlic and fresh lemon.  I used heavy whipping cream and butter, as the recipe called for. My cholesterol is just fine! This is delicious.  I will make this again.  you should try this, you won't be sorry.

I love cajun chicken pasta it's delicious. I use half and half instead of heavy cream but I also put in shredded Italian blend cheese. I add cajun to the sauce as well. I don't use measurmants I just add my spices til I like the taste. Also I use Italian blend spices instead of just basil. You can also make this without the chicken and it's still really good. I think that's about it. Oh and I'm from NY I use dinosaur bbq cajun and it's amazing must try if available.    :)

This is the best recipe I've made from allrecipes so far. I probably added WAY more Cajun seasoning, like a tablespoon instead of a quarter teaspoon, because I wanted it to be spicy. Prob went a little heavier on the other spices, too. But I LOVE it! Will add a little more cream next time and add some shrimp maybe. Hubby likes it too. Gonna add red pepper flakes for even more of a kick next time. We like spicy. Yummy. Thank you!!!!

I loved this meal.  It truly tastes like something from a restaurant.  The only change I made is adding red onions instead of mushrooms because my family doesn't like mushrooms.  The entire family gave rave reviews including my picky 8 year old son. I will definitely be making this again.

I've made slightly different versions of this recipe many times. It's super quick and easy to make.  I disregarded the lemon pepper. I use white onion instead of green onion. I used penne noodles instead of the linguine noodles.   I've added red pepper flakes for a kick sometimes. I've also added 1 smoked sausage link or kielbasa, sliced.  I haven't tried the fresh mushrooms, but I will next time.  This recipe has gone into my weekly meal rotation. It's great.

This is now a regular feature of dinner at my house.  My 5 1/2 year-old and picky husband love this!  The only changes I made was to use a slightly lighter cream and switch up the colours of peppers to whatever is on hand (usually red and orange).

I love this recipe.

I usually cut out mushrooms because I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms in general. For heavy cream, I use half and half and it works great.
I also throw in crushed red peppers into the sauce and the little bit of spice adds volumes in my opinion. This is one of my favorite recipes. Love it

This was an excellent recipe - restaurant quality right at home.  I didn't have quite a cup of heavy cream - so I used some half and half - 1/4 cup to get a one cup measure.  And I didn't have the Cajun seasoning so I just sprinkled seasoned salt over the chicken.  Hubby loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

This is absolutely delicious! Did use EVOO instead of butter & lowfat sour cream. Sautéed the vegies for a while then added the chicken. My son (16) loved it & said I could make it again anytime.

This recipe is very good. I used 4 garlic cloves and a squeeze of lemon juice for 'fresher' ingredients, from another reviewer's suggestion. I also thickened it with 2T flour, and used half & half, so it is not so heavy. I have made this a few times and have added chopped onion, sausage slices, and even some tomato sauce; all of them being very good. This is a very flexible recipe. Thank you

I made a few changes like some others suggested. I cut the chicken into large bite size pieces. I made the creole seasoning recipe from this site since I didn't have any. It makes a LOT so if you need creole seasoning make half the recipe. It's not very spicey so I'm going to add more cayenne to the mix. I also used fresh lemon juice just before serving and used half and half instead of heavy cream. I also sprinkled a heaping teaspoon of flour over the chicken and vegetables and cooked it a few moments before adding the half and half to help thicken it up but it made the sauce too thick so I had to add some chicken stock to loosen it up. My husband really liked it. The two servings are very large so we made it three serving so that my husband had leftovers for lunch the next day. Very quick recipe and only had two pans to clean. This will be part of my regular monthly meals now.

this is a keeper. family loved it. I made exactly except used chicken tenders and half and half instead of heavy cream. The addition of the fresh veggies really lightens it up. Next time I may use a little more Cajun spice.

I followed the recipe and it was a little too soupy for my liking but I really enjoyed the flavor, next time I'll cut the cream back a little.

I've made this over and over again and it's definitely restaurant style. It's enjoyed by my family and friends. I've even added shrimp. The only suggestion I have is that there needs to be more cajun flavoring order to call it cajun. The amount in the recipe is not enough. I added a bit more but still didn't get what I'm used to when eating something cajun. Nevertheless I love this recipe.

I have made this 3 times, each time I omitted the mushrooms and basil because of family food preferences.  Love it. So easy. The third time I used milk  to cut fat and calories and it did not change our enjoyment of the dish.

I love to cook, so I made This for the club I DJ at.
This is the most easy and delicious recipe. I always read the reviews before I began, and there were a lot of helpful hint. Like using lemon juice instead of lemon pepper my hubby doesn't like pepper hot foods. I also used , minced garlic as well to govern the salt content. I used an abundant if Cajun season on the chicken, and both Cajun, and season all to taste in the sauce. It was the club rave.

I added an extra pepper and used some potato flakes as a thickener (the sauce is exceptionally runny).  I also chose to cube the chicken, simply for preference.  It tasted good, but I don't think it's a dish I'm going to incorporate into my regular rotation.  If you are looking for 'Cajun inspired,' then this may fit the bill.  If you are expecting a taste explosion of spice, you might want to keep searching.

So i definetly read many reviews before i made this. my boyfriend and i always love to cook together and decided to cook this. I used baby bell peppers (no green ones lol) and i did add about 2 tsp of cornstarch to the sauce. i first started cooking the mushrooms, then added the onion and bell peppers, then in a separate pan i cooked the chicken, then added the heavy cream to the mushrooms and bell peppers. we kept the chicken separate til the end. delish! better than the store bough alfredo!

I made this tonight for my boyfriend but made a few changes according to our preferences and it came out amazing! I doubled the seasoning and the Parmesan, changed the chicken breast to thighs and the linguine to vegetable penne, and added butterflied shrimp. We absolutely loved it and I will be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe. ??

My family said it was like it came from a restaurant! I used bowtie pasta, increased the butter (go big or go home), cut the peppers and chicken in smaller pieces, added minced garlic, omitted mushrooms (family member doesn't like them), and added seasoning salt and more Cajun seasoning to the sauce. I also had to thicken the sauce a bit with a tbsp of cornstarch mixed with a tbsp of cold water. Small tweaks but an overall great recipe! Definitely in the rotation.

Great recipe!  Used thicker homemade egg noodles (10 oz), and substituted 1 1/2 cups  skim milk for cream.  Added couple shakes of Ms. Dash's seasoning (any one will do).  Thicken with cornstarch mixed with some water and taste was great.

This pasta is so good! The first time I made it, my husband told me to immediately add it to the rotation. I thicken the cream sauce before adding it, and use a little more pasta to get the ratio right, but it's amazing as is.

Great recipe. I used 6 thighs instead of breasts which, once cooked, i halved and sliced against the grain into 1/8 inch thick strips and 3 garlic cloves instead of powder. I also used juice from 1 lemon in place of lemon pepper. I used fettuccini instead of linguine and only 1 bell pepper. The sauce would have been runny but i let it reduce before i added the cooked pasta. I think next time ill half the chicken and use shrimp also.

This is so simple and it's easily restaurant quality. This reminded me of a cafe plate from any little place in the French Quarter. It was really tasty and truly tasted like southern Louisiana. I added sun dried tomatoes and fresh parsley at the end with a lemon wedge. I needed some acid to cut that cream but YUMMY, I will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe, it was super easy. I made it 2 nights in a row because my family loved it. I rated it a 3 because I made a few changes to it, I didn't used the mushrooms(they freak me out), used mozzarella because I didn't have any parmesan, used yellow onion because I didn't have any of the green onion, and I added a little flour to the chicken to give it kind of a crust. Overall it was good and I will be cooking it again soon.

So good! I used sour cream instead of heavy cream. I actually prefer using shrimp with this instead of chicken, or mixing them together.

It Was Great & The Sauce Was Rich. Only Disappointment Was That The 1 Cup Of Heavy Cream Was Not Enough, I Had To Use The Whole Bottle.Next Time Im Going To Add Shrimp To The Recipe.

This is an amazing recipe!! I tweaked it just a bit-- for example, I put minced garlic in the butter and saute it first, then I seared the chicken both sides to really seal in the Cajun seasoning.  

After doing that i pulled them out to medallion/cube (your preference).  I added in the veggies and saute them for a bit before adding the chicken back in to finish getting rid of the pink.  After the chicken was back in the pan with the veggies, I added the seasonings (lemon pepper etc.) to saute with the veggies and butter.  

After I did all that, then i added the heavy cream.  Leave the lid off, and I also let it go longer to help the liquid evaporate and the sauce to thicken.  My family LOVED it. 

I also used an italian cheese mix (put some in with the sauce and then garnished on top). 

Hope you enjoy it as much as i did!

O! M! G!!! This was sooooo good!! So I alwayyyyys get the Cajun chicken pasta at TGIFs. But honestly this is 10 times better. I made a huge pan of this for my family of three and we ate it for two days (lunch and dinner) with no complaints! And when it was gone everyone was sad! ??

So good! I added half/half and 1/4 cup cream cheese, instead of the heavy cream. Plus, I squeezed some lemon in it in place of the lemon pepper.  I over did it with the spicy Cajun seasoning  according to my picky eater son, but he still ate it all!

Absolutely loved this dish.  The next time I would use cubes of chicken rather than strips, as they were a little big.  Would be wonderful with large juicy shrimp.

I made it tonight for my family and it was a hit! I don't usually follow recipes to the 'T', so I just season things liberally until they taste good ;). I used chopped fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and I doubled the recipe to feed my family of 4 and have left overs. My sauce was not thin, and I think it's because I let the mixture simmer, first covered, and then uncovered. Oh, I also used red yellow and orange bell peppers, the ones in the packs of 3 in the produce aisle!

I made this without the chicken because we already had chicken prepared.  I used chicken andouille sausage instead and followed the same direction. I chose to add in some fresh garlic instead of just powder and added double the Cajun spice. I also added more than a sprinkle of Parmesan because the cheesier the better!!! It was delectable,delicious and scrumptious!!!!

I really enjoyed this dish! I added more cheese, mainly just because I love cheese and used boneless chicken thighs since I like dark meat better, but other than that I made no changes to the recipe and it came out great.

Excellent! Even my kids liked it. But I will say the serving size is off. Since it says "serves 2" and I have a family of 5, I double it. We barely made a dent in it.

So good! I definitely recommend making it. I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces first, covered in Cajun seasoning, then sautéed in the butter as instructed. Added the veggies and spices but I didn't have any cream so I used milk (I removed the chicken and veggies and added a little flour to thicken the sauce.

Not what I was expecting, but pretty yummy. I followed the recipe to the tee, and it ended up pretty soupy, but if you add more than the recommended amount of pasta it covers pretty well. Great for leftovers.

I think cooking the chicken after covering it in the Cajun seasoning is really important. I added the seasoning to already cooked chicken and it lacked flavor. It was good but it could have been better had I followed that step. I used fat free sour cream instead of heavy so that may have affected it slightly as well. Definitely one to do again but I'll follow the seasoning instructions more closely.

This pasta was amazing! I'm not much of a cook but I am great at following directions. I followed the recipe with the exception of a few things. I cut the linguine pasta in half while cooking. I did not have green onions so I used a regular onion.  I substituted the garlic powder with garlic salt because I did not have any. I also added a bit more cayenne pepper because I wanted it to have a little more kick. Mine was not really  "creamy" but I wasn't really going for that consistency.

I used cream fraiche instead of thick cream. The recipe is delicious, probably one of the best pasta dished I've ever made.

Wow. We will Definitely be making this recipe again! Creamy and tasty with a little kick. Other than deglazing the pan with a splash of white wine and using fresh, minced garlic, I followed the original recipe. A filling & quick weeknight meal. Thank You.

I'm newlywed and not the best at cooking. I decided to try something new that was still in my comfort range for a Valentines Dinner. If there were 10 stars it would get all 10. Super easy to make, very fulfilling, and fairly cheap to make. I added a little extra heavy cream, added Italian seasoning towards the end, and omitted mushrooms as I hate them. I worked all day, got home at 4, started cooking at 5 and had my main dish, salad, bread sticks, and a cake all done and we were finished eating by 6:15! Now if I can talk my husband into doing the dishes hahaha

Delicious!!. Made it more spicy with extra Cajun! Used sour cream and half n half for the cream, also stone ground mustard.  Used penne pasta instead, red yellow orange bell peppers, and onion, sauteed.  Delicious!!

Love the flavor of this. I didn't realize this was only for 2 servings so I increased to almost 3/4 box of linguine and added a little bit more liquid in addition to the cream.  I used a little half and half and some skim.  Next time I will add a lot more veggies.

Very good, but we didn't have any heavy cream, so we used a little milk for about half of the meal and it was delicious, and the part without milk was delicious, too! 
Also, putting the chicken in a bag with the cajun seasoning and shaking it up was such a good idea!!! It made the chicken really pop. Just make sure you get air in your bag before trying to shake it. :)

This is a great dish. I made it in my cast iron skillet. I only used one pepper and substituted one of the bell peppers for a jalapeno pepper which packed a nice punch. One cup of cream provided more  than enough sauce, I would probably scale back on the cream next time.

Very good. I doubled the recipe for my family of 4. Not really eaten by the kids but DH & I really enjoyed this dish. Very creamy (I added 4tsp corn starch mixed with milk at the very end to thicken) & very flavorful. It could even stand to be cut back a bit on the seasonings. I cut up the chicken prior to sautéing, used 1/4 of a white onion (no green onion on hand) and a 3 pack of organic bell peppers (red, orange & yellow). I used homemade cajun spices from this site omitting the crushed red pepper & using only half of the cayenne pepper to keep it mild. I will significantly reduce or omit the lemon pepper next time as I though it was too potent. I used 3/4 the spice amounts and 1 cup whole milk with 1/2 cup heavy cream. Very tasty! I will make this again. Thanks!

I would suggest specifying that whipping cream is the same thing as heavy cream.  I used the heaviest I knew of, which was coffee cream, and it did not work at all, rated 4 stars because im sure it would have been way better with the cream that the author meant.

Absolutely looooove this recipe! It is a little fattening, but totally worth it. I made it for a diner party of 4, would probably double the recipe if I was to make it for guests again.

I knew as soon as I read the reviews and not every single person made changes, that this recipe was going to be AMAZING. It did not disappoint!! I have a house full of picky eaters but decided to try this one anyways, and am making it for the second time tonight. (The first time being less than a week ago!) & this is my first written review if that tells you anything. I have to agree with a previous post though. If you are going to make it,make it right. And enjoy all the fatness because it is WELL worth it! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Quick and easy. I would reduce the amount of linguini to keep it moist. I'm not a massive spice person and this had just a minimal bite to it, be liberal with the Cajun seasoning.

4 1/2 stars!  My husband really loved it.  I made this nearly as written, only a few changes.  I only had 1 green pepper, so I made due with that.  I used white onion, instead of green.  And no heavy cream, so I used a cup of 2% milk with added melted butter.  I made my own lemon pepper and Cajun spice combination...the premade ones have too much salt.  Because we like things spicy, I added some more cayenne pepper, to taste.  What I really enjoyed about this recipe was the ease of preparation...nice, especially on a weeknight.  I will make this one again.

I made this the first time and LOVED it, however my husband doesn't care for a lot of spice (i know cajun pasta).  The next time i cut the cajun seasoning in half and it still turned out wonderful.  I have also used shrimp instead of chicken and its great!

This is an awesome recipe. I used "slap ya mama" seasoning. I actually made the sauce on the side. The sauce is good. But healthier eating is just putting the vegetables and chicken directly on the noodles. (I liked it better this way). I added large chunks of onion on my second time making this recipe and thought it was a good addition. This has become a family favorite.

Good recipe as written.  I will use only red bell peppers next time - personal preference. And more vegetables, less chicken.  And low fat sour cream.  But by good and will lend well to alterations if you choose

Loveee this recipe! We made it in cooking class in school for a project and it was great. However when I make at home I change things a tad bit. I cut the peppers into smaller pieces, more so diced, and usually use a red pepper & an orange pepper. I take the chicken out when it's done and cook the peppers and green onion for a few minutes until softer, and then put chicken back in and add cream. I add some cornstarch until it thickens, this turns out amazing!

A family favorite in my house! I didn't have any Cajun Spice so i made my own. I skip out on the mushrooms as it seemed to changed the flavor/texture. loved it.

I added 1 tsp of chicken broth base to the cream and 1/4 cup white wine to the pan after cooking the chicken. This tasted so good I couldn't stop eating it even after I was full.

Loved it! My picky kids ate every bite. The only thing I did differently was cut the chicken in smaller strips. Next time Im adding Shrimp too, I think that would be an excellent addition.

I made this last night.  It's just so easy to make and felt like we were eating out at a restaurant it was just so good.  I will make this again and again.  I did use only half of the red, yellow and orange peppers .  Wow will make this for company.

Holy Moly this was good! I substituted jalapeño peppers instead of bell peppers (cause I'm crazy!) and omitted the mushrooms because my family doesn't like them. We all loved it! Will definitely make again.

Made this tonight and it was okay. Too soupy and not spicy like other cajun chicken pastas I've had in the past.  I will make this again but I'll probably add more cajun seasoning, some hot peppers to go along with the bell peppers,  and use some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Thanks for a base to add to though!

I didn't make many changes. Just a couple small things, yellow bell pepper instead of red and a lot more mushrooms! We like it spicy so next time I might add some cayenne pepper. But I loved this recipe and it's super easy to make! I will definitely be making it again.

I always feel bad for changing a recipe but this really did turn out amazing. I changed it from 935 calories per serving to only 295 so it's worth the changes I made as follows:
Swapped out the heavy cream for 1/2 cup light sour cream and 1/2 cup plain fage Greek yogurt, swapped the butter for olive oil, Lemon pepper for lemon juice, added 1 extra tsp of Cajun seasoning in with the yogurt and sour cream, used costco organic garofalo penne pasta (about 10 oz vs only 4). These changes made it about 6 servings vs only 2 as well. Delicious!

I made this for Sunday dinner but substituted asparagus for the green pepper and added Havarti with the parmesan. 
Outstanding! Even my picky 10 year old loved it. I assume you meant  Laissez les bons moments rouler et bon appétit!

I will make this again. I substituted chicken for shrimp and it came out perfect. I also tried this dish with chicken and accidentally used the parmesan while cooking the chicken. It came out amazing. I also substitute butter for olive oil.

Taste great and the only change I made was adding the Parmesan cheese into the sauce at the end to thicken the sauce more.

This was a good meal!! I think I'll play with the seasonings a little next time I make it as it was waaaaay too spicy... Not sure what went wrong (maybe the pepper) other than that this dish was great!!

I've added this recipe to my routine menu. My husband and I love it! To make it with less calories, I use 3/4 cup half and half and  and 1/4 cup heavy cream then thicken with corn starch. I also serve it over whole wheat penne instead of linguine. I prefer this recipe to many similar pasta dishes that I have eaten out!

I used pork instead of chicken since I thawed the wrong meat out.  Learned how to substitute milk for heavy cream since we were out of it.  Added spinach and carrots when I added the peppers and mushrooms.  Cooked the noodles in beef broth.  Everyone except my picky eater loves it.  Husband and son went back for more.

Next time I'll add garlic, more cajun spice and Sriracha hot chili sauce.  The Sriracha will go on just before serving and blended in.  This was very good following the recipe but for my taste not spicy enough.  I do like dishes where the vegetables are cooked with the meat and this works well here.

This has become one of my favorite recipes. Even though it's rich it's worth making just the way it's written. I don't go out to dinner much, so, this is the way I splurge.

This pasta dish was just fantastic--even better the next day. I made the recipe as stated, but just added more of some ingredients to stretch it. Even as I started to eat it, I knew I would be making it again soon. No, it is not a dish that is low in calories, but every now and then, you just need to make it. It rivals similar pasta dishes that I have had at restaurants. I had kale with sauteed garlic, and cheese toast on the side. Yes, I know I'll have to run an extra mile tomorrow--but it was worth every bite.

Made this recipe today, yummy!  I substited the green pepper though for a 1/2 red & 1/2 yellow peppers, instead of using a full cup of heavy cream,  i put 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/ cup half n half, i also squeezed a 1/2 lemon in because i had no lemon pepper.

SO GOOD. Made this today and it was DELICIOUS. To cut the calories, I used half the butter and light cream. Used 1 lb. chicken tenderloins and cut them up into tiny pieces. Doubled the cajun seasoning, no lemon pepper, and increased it to 1.5 cups of cream. Cooked longer to let the sauce thicken. This is a definite keeper.... and hubs was a fan!

This was amazing and left my family wanting more.  The spices were adjusted to my family's taste in that I didn't use as much as the recipe called for but enough to bring through the flavor.  Easy and delicious.

Love this recipe, have made it several times. I use 1/2 & 1/2 and potato starch to thicken. I added some crushed pepper for a little more kick

Yes, I will make this again. Hubby and I both loved the flavor of this dish. I prepped everything early to make it easier and quicker come cook time. The only thing I changed in this recipe were the bell peppers. We used half of a red and half of a yellow. I would also suggest cutting the strips in half

It was awesome!! I doubled the recipe because we have a family of 6. Perfect!! I also diced all the peppers because our kiddos are a bit picky. No complaints on this one ;) They keep asking me to make it again and again! P.S.  You get the cream in the milk section. Buy the Heavy whipping cream.

My husband is very picky and he said he would like to eat this once a week!  It was very good, flavorful and filling.....as well as easy to make. The only adjustments that I made were I doubled the Parmesan cheese and added fresh garlic, about a teaspoon or so.

This was liked by my family, but after reading the reviews, I made some changes.  I used reduced-fat sour cream instead of heavy cream, and even with that substitution, the sauce was kind of thin.  I replaced the butter with a few tablespoons of vegetable oil.  I used Creole seasoning on the chicken and Creole seasoning, lemon pepper, and basil in the sauce.  The seasonings were just right made that way.  I'm surprised by the claim that this recipe makes only 2 servings.  Those are awfully big servings!  I'd say that it makes 4 servings.  I doubled the recipe for 4 people and we ate about half of it, although I left the pasta on the side and we did eat most of that.  Next time I make this for 4 people, I'll increase the pasta but keep the other amounts the same.

Add time for cooking the chicken (or cut into strips prior to reduce cooking time). Taste was quite good. Family enjoyed it.

This was great!  I made it at the fire department with only one adjustment: everything was x4.  These are 6 large firemen and this proved to be plenty.  I followed the directions and they turned our great.  Also, being a sauce guy I would even increase the size of the sauce for my little family so I could pour more delicious sauce over the noodle and attack with some french bread.  WILL FIX AGAIN!

Truly restaurant quality!  I upped the pasta by 200%, the Cajun seasoning by 50%, used half and half as a sub for 1/2 of the heavy cream,  and used some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Three large chicken breasts was the perfect amount of chicken.

Everyone in the family loved it! I used 2 large chicken breasts and diced them. Tossed with about double the Cajun seasoning. I halved the butter and added some EVOO instead. I used fresh basil, garlic, lemon and pepper instead of the dried versions.  Also used half and half instead of heavy cream. I did add about 2 tbls corn starch to help thicken the sauce a little.  I also choose to use fresh pasta which I think added to to taste. Will definitely be making this again.

It is the perfect amount of spiciness. The veggies and meat soak up the flavor wonderfully. 
The only thing I wish I did was cut the chicken breast into slices before cooking. I ended up cutting them afterward. But I can always do that next time! I would make again!

This was great but I used fresh garlic and basil and I used sour cream instead of heavy cream be cause I already had it in the fridge. We would probably add more chili spice next time.  We like it hot.  Great recipe!!

When I made it, I didn't have any lemon pepper but we had everything else! Instead of dried basil I used fresh. Rather than marinating the chicken in the Cajun, I fried it in a pan with BACON GREASE. yum! I loooove bacon *°* I may be 13 but I can cook a delicious meal for my family!! I definitely will cook this again, and I definitely will reccomend it to others! Pasta dishes seem to be my specialty :D

Absolutely fantastic, added a bit more cajan spice to the chicken and a little more lemon pepper  reduced the salt and pepper but otherwise stuck to the original recipe. I would highly recommend this recipe, finished dish had great texture and a  lot of great taste

This is beyond fantastic!  I had to increase all the spices, including the Cajun seasoning, almost tripled all of them, but it was amazing. I also added the Parmesan cheese at the end so it melted into it. Thanks for the recipe, this is definitely a keeper!

Fabulous!  I didn't have a green pepper so threw in a jalapeño.  Otherwise used all ingredients as written.  Family said definitely make again.

The only thing I did different was I used a bag of chicken fajita meat. I did overdo on the Cajun seasoning (I thought there wasn't that much in the recipe). This was better than Chili's pasta! Wow! I'm amazed. I used 2 tablespoons for a single serving. Don't do that. Lol

M wife and I really liked this recipe, but we will make a couple of changes to the recipe next time we make it; leave out the salt, and tone down the Cajun season a little. Other than those couple of things, this recipe is a keeper. Lots of flavor, and easy to make.

I was concerned about the amount of fat so, I decided to try it using 6 oz Evaporated Milk instead of 8 oz Cream, since evap milk is half the calories and fat I went with that.  Honestly it was so good, I am afraid to try with the cream, as I can not see it being any better. I also used one minced garlic instead of the powder. I used whole wheat linguine.  This has become a regular on the menu.  We love it!

I used half and half instead of heavy cream.
 I made it for 4 Servings instead of 2.
 Next time, I will not double the spices - as it made it a little too spicy for my wife's taste.
 other than that, she loved it.

This was awesome! Even my picky man loved it. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I cut up the chichen into bite size pieces because it's just easier that way. I also added fresh basil and a squeeze of lemon instead of lemon pepper. Also, I added 1 cup of light sour cream instead of heavy cream to cut down on the fat a bit. Lastly I added some shrimp for some pizzaz because I like to live on the edge. Awesome awesome dish!!!

Great blend of flavors (personal preference to omit the mushrooms) for a quick and easy dinner.  Had to simmer the sauce a bit longer to reduce the cream but better than using a thickener.  Definite keeper!

I didn't have quite enough chicken so I sub'd in some kielbasa sausage. It was pretty good, will try again without the sausage. Chicken was definitely better than the sausage.

Very disappointing.  I expected flavour with the Cajun title but it was very bland. The sauce disappeared after the pasta was added even though I added an extra cup of 1/2 and 1/2. There were leftovers despite 3 hungry men and no raves or requests to make it again.

Made this last night for the first time and we loved it! I did not have bell peppers so I threw in two pasilla chilies which gave it a bit of a bite but the cream toned it down. Also used fettucini instead of linguine....we will be making this again for certain!!

Easy to make which is just how I like it and worth the effort.I admit I cut down on the peppers as I thought two would dominate the flavour. And I used crème fraiche instead of cream. Still a delicious dish though.

I tried this recipe last night and it was awesome!!! The first time I make a recipe I follow the recipe to the T and I did so last night except I did cut up the breast into bite size pieces. Other than that I made exact measurements and closely watched cooking times. My wife and I loved it. No leftovers. I will make this again very soon.

Great recipe! Thank you, I will definitely keep this one!! We are huge pasta lovers, but don't like all the richness and calories of cream sauces,  so I doubled the pasta and used 1 1/2 cups 2% milk with 1 TBSP cornstarch instead of the heavy cream.  Found smokey Cajun seasoning in the bulk at Winco so used that (sliced the chicken prior to mixing with the Cajun seasoning). Other than those few changes followed the recipe, I know it would be fabulous exactly as written, but it was fabulous this way too! Thanks again fo the recipe!

This was really good. Although I did add about 1/2 cup of white wine and let it reduce a little. Then I added the cream and finished like the directions indicated.

SO GOOD! I used a red, orange and yellow pepper (cut up a little smaller than strips). I used a regular onion because I didn't have a green one. I also used a couple fresh basil leaves instead of the dried. I bought Purdue's light & fit thin cut chicken. I used the entire pack and cut them up in large bite sized pieces. Coated the chicken in the Cajun in a bowl (used a little more than called for). After adding the cream and other ingredients I let it simmer on the lowest heat for almost 10 minutes. It came out so good! My sauce was thin as well but it worked with the extra chicken I put in. I also didn't measure the pasta. Just put in what looked good. It held very well to everything and didn't need to be anything thicker. Thanks for sharing. I will definitely be making this again and sharing as well:) If you can just use the cream and butter. It really makes it. Just don't eat it every night.

This was an excellent dish!  Flavorful and spicy but not overpowering or hot....My whole family loved it.  I always make the recipes I pick here exactly as they are written then think up some "tweeks" for the next time if we liked it.  I can't think of a change I'd make to this one!  Thanks for sharing!

this was SO GOOD!  Better than any I've had at a restaurant.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so didn't use it, but that's really the only thing I did differently. I'm sure the grandsons will have this one in frequent rotation - maybe I better try some of the lower fat versions? Nah!

Loved this and so did my guests. First time, I made it just as it was. The second time, I added my own touches and added sausage and shrimp, along with the chicken. So Yummie.

pasta turned out really good. family said that they want more . I ommited the mushrooms since I didn't have any . I used an onion in place of the green onion . I had to use a different type of chilli powder since no cayenne was on hand . also I put a dash of mustard for better taste . In place of the heavy cream I combined 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup butter . next time I will season the chicken with more then just the chilli powder . sauce was great . will make again :)

Very easy meal to make and it tastes great. I chopped up green and red peppers and sautéed it for about 7-10 so there would be no crunch. Added habernero for some spice. chopped up chicken breath into pieces and add shrimp!

I prepared it this time just as written and it was super tasty! Um...except the linguine. All I had on hand was spaghetti, but still...Oh my goodness! I LOVED the Cajun seasoning on the chicken. Next time I will try it with a couple differences though. Sour cream for the sauce (as many others have said to cut down on fat and be more cost effective), fresh lemon, and double the basil.

Absolutely amazing!!! Only thing I changed was instead of 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream, I did 1 cup of heavy cream and half a cup of sour cream! I'm so glad I found this recipe and so is my born and raised New Orleans boyfriend :)

Peppers didn't seem to compliment and the cream was runny. Next time I think I would 1/2 the cream and probably leave the peppers out and add more mushrooms

An easy, versatile and yummy dinner! Instead of butter I used a tablespoon of coconut oil, and I completely ditched the salt. I doubled the spices and used about a 1.5lb of chicken.It was absolutely delicious though I think I over spiced the cajuned (which isn't always a bad thing!) Definitely a must try!

Worked out great, but was grateful to previous reviewers for healthier suggestions. . . used half and half instead of heavy cream, and slightly lowered garlic content (for husband, not me!!!) I did thicken the sauce with corn flour, as well. Realised too late that my mushrooms were no longer possible (what a waste!) but added fresh spinach to make up for (a really good addition, in my humble opinion).

Super good! Fairly easy. Fresh and satisfying. Has some zip to it, so diners with a delicate palate might back off on the amount of Cajun spices. The recipe doesn't mention slicing the chicken, but I'd recommend that. Also, you can easily extend the recipe, for more diners, by adding a chicken breast and pasta.

Made this EXACTLY to the recipe, just made it in a bigger portion. It tastes amazing! My boyfriend and I both love it. I prefer spicy food and he really doesn't like spicy but the heavy cream tames down the heat enough to make it perfect for both of us. Definitely recommend.

I'm a new cook and this is my go-to recipe. It's easy but tastes like you spent a lot of time cooking it! As someone recommend in their review, I substitute the cream with sour cream and it's just as delicious. I also prepare this with twice as much pasta.

FANTASTIC ! This is a restaurant quality dish! Once all the ingredients were prepped and assembled it was quick and easy to cook .I did not have green bell pepper, only 1 red. I had skinless chicken thighs and cut them in strips. This would be great using shrimp also.

Really good dish. Leave the cream till the end and just before you add it, add a few tea spoons of lemon juice to deglaze the pan, then add the cream and then the pasta. yum!

This is a very forgiving recipe. I used three bell peppers, didn't measure mushrooms or green onions, noodles or seasonings. And since I knew I was using more than 4oz pasta, I used an extra 1/2 cup cream. My family and I loved it!!!

Delicious flavor!! I added a lot of extra cajun seasoning, subbed fresh lemon for lemon pepper, and extra mushrooms. Also mixed the parmesan into the sauce. I needed a little flour to thicken the sauce as well. Amazing flavor, highly recommended.

This was very good. It is the closest to Aubrey's restaurant's Rattlesnake pasta I've ever found. The family all loved it. It called for cajun seasoning, so i used one of the recipes on this site for the cajun spice and it was great. I didn't have any heavy cream so i used sour cream and milk. I did double the sauce recipe because i was feeding 4 people. Definitely a keeper. I will make it often.

Great recipe! The changes I made were cutting the chicken in to bite size pieces and seasoning the chicken with thyme along with the cajun seasoning. Additionally, I let it simmer and added more cream to thin it out a bit. I also took one other reviewers suggestion and used rotini instead of linguine and let it simmer. The entire family loved it.

This was so good! I used canned mushroom because that's what I had and I didn't miss the fresh. My son is allergic to milk so I used coconut milk (the canned stuff not the drink) I was worried it would taste coconuts but it didn't. This is a keeper!

I've made this and I can tell you that it's amazing. The sauce had just the right consistency. Personally I added a little more pepper and salt that what it called for as well as hot pepper.

A delicious recipe! I cut back on the calories a bit by making a white sauce and using it instead of the cream. Thank you for sharing your recipe .It was really good!

Tried this recipe tonight for dinner and it was a huge hit.  I left the mushrooms out as my family doesn't like them, but it was such an easy dinner to make.  Very tasty.

I made a few alterations (naturally as all home grown cooks do) and I have to say it is amazing.  I am not normally a fan of this style of pasta but it turned out absolutely delicious. I'll be making this again.

Awesome!  First time we tried this recipe. We didn't change a thing except changing out the green pepper for broccoli.  We're always amazed when folks try a recipe here, change it around till it doesn't even resemble the original and say they love it or hate it... this one was fantastic as is!

I used whole wheat pasta. I left out the mushrooms. I also added one can of rotel to spice it up. really one can was too much maybe half a can next time lol. I followed the advice and used low fat sour cream. my friend thought it was too spicy but I loved it. Paired with a goat cheese and a red pasta sauce dip with bread. it got a 10/10 tonight.

I am from Louisiana and saw the name cajun chicken pasta and decided to give it a try. The reviews seemed good, so I was expecting a delicious dish. (First let me say that my rating is based on the recipe as listed...I will never rate a recipe that I have modified.) Based on what is listed the recipe was just okay. The base was really tasteful but the chicken is so bland. I will reattempt to make this dish, but next time I will try it with fajita chicken. I believe it will add that missing flavor so many of us are saying is missing in the recipe. Also, it will eliminate step 2, how great is that!

I just made this dish tonight and it was a great success. I doubled parts of the recipe since I cooked for a family of 4 and the recipe is for 2 servings. I was hoping for a small leftover lunch tomorrow; however, there are no leftovers. Instead of doubling the chicken I cut it into small bite sized. I doubled the veggies. I doubled the butter. Added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the butter after sautéing the meat and veggies to thicken the sauce a bit. I then added the 1 cup of cream called for and added 1 cup of milk to double the sauce. Doubled the seasonings too. Absolutely delicious! Will be a repeat dinner for sure. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I prefer intense, complex flavors and this has become one of my go-to recipes! I was completely surprised that the kids (pre-teens) love it as well. I make it exactly as the recipe states, although sometimes I let the chicken marinate in the Cajun seasoning for a few hours if I have time. I love the balance of flavors as well as their intensity - this is a great recipe for every night or for company!

I made this pasta as written.  It was very good. It was also easy to make.  My family and friends got a chance to sample it.  They thought it was a keeper.  This made me feel good because I am not a cook.

I did not use any onions and used 2 cups of bell peppers (all red and yellow, no green: heartburn city, YUCK!) .  Other than that stuck to the recipe and it was DELICIOUS.  

I was not too impressed with the first couple of bites only because I was expecting more of a "bite".  But the more I ate, the more "heat" I got and I FELL IN LOVE with this dish!! It is a KEEPER!  I'll be making this once a week I'm sure...boyfriend LOVED it!!

I am an absolute  beginner in cooking but this chicken turned out amazing. This amount of heavy cream was a bit too much for me (or I didnt use the right amount), so I strained the whole thing before serving due to the excess but it still turned out fine!

This recipe turned out perfectly! The most delicious pasta I've made this far. I only made a few minor changes. I seasoned the chicken breast halves with season salt, garlic powder and black pepper prior to shaking them in cajun seasoning. I sautéed the bell peppers with the chicken until the peppers were soft. I omitted the mushrooms as I'm not a big fan of the shrooms. And I also mixed in more of the Parmesan cheese to thicken up the sauce a bit more and to make it a little cheesier. Simply amazing.

Followed the recipe exactly except for the basil (I was out.) Oh, and I subbed the linguine pasta for bow tie pasta. Very, very good. Reminded me of a flavorful, spicier Alfredo. Will absolutely make this again! Thank you for the recipe :)

Delicious!  I did make a few minor changes, using only red pepper,  adding 2 more teaspoons of cajun seasoning and using a sweet onion instead of green.  Even my 4 year old loved it.  Definitely going to keep this recipe handy!

Made this exactly as stated. It was easy and fairly quick. I managed to inhale the cooking smoke and almost choked on the cajun seasonings!  My husband and son loved it. I am not a big fan of cajun seasoning but thought it was good. I gave the recipe a 4 because I think it could use more of the sauce.

Other than that it was great. I will be making it on a regular basis (I switched out 1/2 and 1/2 for heavy cream.)

This is such an amazing recipe.  I've made some modifications instead of chicken I put clams and shrimps and also zucchini.  My daughter and my hubby totally loved it and they said we should have it every Saturday night. Thank you to the creator!!!

I get asked to make this all the time...and have made it probably over 50 times for my family and friends.  It's always a hit and is a "treat day" meal in our home.

The first few times I didn't add the peppers b/c it sounded like a weird addition to me...but make sure to use them b/c they really give the meal a little something extra.

I usually either use less cream or cook it down to make the sauce thicker...and I always just make my own cajun seasoning (w/out salt) and adjust the spice to taste depending on who is eating with us and how spicy they like their food.

I also add extra chicken, vegetables, and cheese.

I always serve with whole wheat linguine or fettuccine, and instead of adding the pasta to the sauce, I just serve the sauce over the pasta so it's not creamy sauce overload.

Made this for my husband last night and it was AMAZING. I didn't have whipping cream so I simmered down one cup of milk and one cup of coconut milk down to one cup total volume to substitute. Worked like a charm! Went back for seconds!

I didn't really measure and used a lot more Cajun spice and mushrooms. In my opinion I should have used less peppers (I used all red). I did use fresh lemon juice, garlic and fresh basil. This was great! Thanks

This was a great recipe but I could tell, even from the 5 star ratings it needed a little tweaking. I see that most were having an issues with it being to watery my solution was simple... Add 1/2 a cup of grated parm. Not the powder stuff shredded. As it melts it becomes a thickening agent and turns the heavy cream into a rich "stick to the noodles" sauce. Other modifications that I made... Cook the chicken, remove to a plate. Cook the veggies (I added in a sliced zucchini for some umph to the dish as suggested by other reviews) removed to the same plate with chicken. Then I made the sauce with 1/2c chicken broth, 1 cup heavy cream, then one can of diced tomatoes with juices, 1/2 cup shredded parmesan  simmer for 5-8mins then added the chicken and veggies with their juices to the pan simmered another 5 mins. Toss with noodles.

A DEFINITE MUST-TRY! Amazing recipe! It is now my signature dish. My guy absolutely loves it and is constantly asking me to make it. I don't add the mushrooms (not a big fan of them), and go easy on the lemon pepper but am generous with the basil. It's all about finding what variation on the recipe works best for you.

This recipe was great to start with, but I wanted to make it a one pot meal so I changed a couple of things.  First I have to triple the recipe, otherwise my kids would lock me out of the house! I substitute crushed red pepper flakes for the black pepper, use 1 quart of light cream and 2-3 cups of chicken broth.  I also use more than 6 tsp. of Cajun seasoning, closer to 1/8 - 1/4 cup.  I add my pasta at the end, let cook for about 15 minutes and it has turned out great.

This recipe is a winner.. hubby loved it! I did make a few changes though.Instead of cajun spice I used peri peri spice and a little chicken. I used fresh garlic and fresh lemon and half a glass of white wine. The white wine makes it tasty because the sour cream is bland. I also used extra spice. Will def make again. Thanks

Delicious recipe!! The only adjustment I made was white onion instead of green onions.  My husband loved it and asked me to make it again within a week!!  It's creamy with just enough spice, and I served it with corn muffins which paired well with it!! Leftovers heat well in the microwave as the pasta does not seem to soak up all the sauce. Definitely a keeper for my recipe box.

I didn't realize I was out of lemon pepper :( and I cut up the chicken but other than that I followed the recipe and it was delicious. My family gobbled it up. Having read all of the reviews I may try to lighten it up a little bit next time though. I like to follow the recipe the first time before I make a major change. I would definitely make this one again.

Original recipe is very good. I am not Cajun by birth, but am by heart. I can't count the times I have been to New Orleans. To me, a change was needed. I use Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning, half the peppers, and double the onion. I also add the Parmesan when I add the cooked linguine. Serve with French bread. Amazing!  The original recipe gets 5 stars...my variation gets 6.

A real simple way to cut down the fat, is to substitute the heavy cream with 2% milk and fat free cool whip. You get the rich creamy taste without the fat. Works well in most recipes that call for heavy cream.

I "veganized" this recipe by using Gardien chicken scalopini, Earth Balance butter, and Silk brand creamer. Then I omitted the Parmesan, and thickened the sauce with some mashed potato flakes. So rich and flavorful! My husband and I also love the leftovers!

Very yummy! A great all around warm you up comphort dish. I did however make a slight change. I used cream cheese and chicken broth to replace the cream because I had none. Omited the parm cheese and used fresh garlic and basil. Will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing.

My whole family loved this!!  I only had about half the heavy cream called for so for the other half I used whole milk.  To help thicken it a little more since I used the milk I added a little parmesan into the sauce as it cooked.  Yum!!

This turned out great for a small dinner party ( I doubled everything). The only change I made was I substituted yellow squash (had it from the garden) for the mushrooms. I also reduced the amount of peppers just a little.

This recipe has been a HUGE hit. My boyfriend requests it which is saying a lot. The flavors are SO good and it only gets better as a left over. We found that the chicken is more tender if you use the following method: you start with cooking the chicken and then set it aside when it is almost done, continue the directions in the recipe by cooking the vegetables in the chicken pan and then add the chicken back in at the end to simmer in the sauce a little.

I think it's much better without the mushrooms. Otherwise, a really fantastic dish! To slightly lower the fat content, I use half and half or light cream with a bit of flour/cornstarch.

I made this for several dinner parties. Everyone really loved it! It also makes homemade pasta soar through the roof with flavor.

LOVE this! I think it's a bit deceiving though when it says it serves 2, because I felt like it would have served 4. We tried it with half and half and it tastes just as good as with heavy cream. Either way, this is a super quick and tasty meal!

Awesome flavor - I used spiral pasta and cooked chicken in Buffalo sauce rather than using cajun spices - When chicken mixed with sauce - it added a kick and really good tang flavor. Was a big hit at a dinner party.

Sory to jump off the bandwagon but I agree with the reviewer that said something is missing here.    I work for a well known chain reataurant and brought home some of our cajun spice.  Based on other reviews I used twice as much as suggested.    I used a teaspoon or more of fresh basil and some red pepper flakes but somehow the sauce did not meld flavorwise -- it had some heat but no depth..  I used 1/2 and 1/2 but the problem was not in the richness of the sauce but rather it seemed one demensional if that makes sense.  I probably won't even bother to tinker with it on a retry.

LOVE this recipe!  I use 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup lowfat sour cream instead of the heavy cream.  It's definitely not as thick as it would be with the cream, but if you let it cool a bit it thickens up, and it works for my husband and I!  This has become a regular for us, though I use whatever veggies I have on hand.  Broccoli especially tastes great in this dish!

This was amazing....so quick and easy.  I did make a few substitutions based on others reviews, used half and half, olive oil, fresh garlic, chicken tenders and wide egg noodles.  Have been to Louisiana many a times, this compares to some of the best creole dishes out there...even my picky husband couldn't get enough.  One tip, before adding in the pasta to toss, add in a splash of the pasta water to help thicken the sauce along with the Parmesan cheese.  Cannot wait to make this again.

WOW cooked this using the heavy cream and added orange peppers and cut the chicken into bit size. I cut the chicken up when it was about done cooking and still in the pan worked well. TASTED AWESOME restaurant style and VERY easy. I know its easy because im new to cooking and made it flawlessly and both roommates loved it

This recipe is an absolute winner. In looking for a recipe with lots of flavor, but light on the waist line. With using cream, this recipe didn't fit the bill, but still sounded amazing. I simply added milk instead of cream. With the Parmesan cheese and adding the pasta to the pan, it didn't make it too runny and was perfect. I also added a little more Cajun seasoning to the chicken to make it a little spicier. But overall a winning recipe.

Ive never written a review before but this was sooooo good I had to!  I used half n half instead of heavy cream, and no onion by personal choice...added some zucchini.  It came out really runny at first so i added flour a 1/4 tsp at a time to thicken it up to my liking...didnt effect the taste as long as you dont add too much (MAYBE a tsp at most).  It turned out thick, creamy, full of flavor, but not too spicy!!  PERFECT!  I also doubled the recipe and had just enough for leftovers.  Dont leave out the cheese at the end

oH mY gOoDnEsS this was good!  This one goes down as one of the best pastas I've ever made!  I will definitely be sharing it w/ friends and family!    Next time, I would probably cut back on the cajun seasoning just a tad.  I also didn't add any extra pepper....it didn't need it.  I added two cloves of chopped garlic and made mine w/ cheese ravioli.  It turned out phenomenal!  Yumm......too bad there wasn't much left for leftovers tomorrow.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was delish! I didnt have heavy cream so I used sour cream, I changed it to 4 searvings, but only had a cup and a half of sour cream, but it was fine. Maybe next time Ill add a little more spice. But we loved it and I cant wait to make it again. Also had no green onion, just used a yellow, orange and green pepper.

I thought this recipe was wonderful.  I doubled the seosonings.  I used Bow Tie Pasta instesad.  I laso used more Cajun Seasoning while cooking the chicken.  I doubled the Basil and Lemmon Pepper seasoning.  It was so good.  I will cook this again.

Awesome recipe- thanks so much! I stuck to the recipe, except I used a roasted chicken from Kroger (I shredded it and then coated it with the cajun seasoning) and I added red onion, fresh garlic, red pepper flake and used reduced fat sour cream instead of heavy cream to make it a little healthier. I was a little worried when I started making it because I was thought it was just going to taste like sour cream, so I added a little more cajun seasoning- and don't worry- it doesn't taste like sour cream at all!! My boyfriend took two bites and said "This is ___ delicous!"- That's the 1st time I've had to bleep his comment, so I'm taking that as a good thing ;)

This is simply delicious.  I was looking for something to rival the popular restaurant chain's menu version, which I often ordered.  We stopped going out to eat altogether and I was having a hankering for this dish.  I always attempt to follow recipes exactly as they are written,  so as to experience the individual's creativity.  Well I didn't have the mushrooms for this dish, but did have some fresh spinich.  Excellent!  And I'm sure it would have been great with mushrooms also.  My wife loved it.    The cajun seasoning I made using another recipe I found here.  Also very good.  I will no longer be purchasing the pre-made varieties.  Will be making both again.

This was really good.  Don't be afraid to add more cajun spices.  I cut the chicken up after cooking and before adding to the pepper mix.  Made it easier to eat.  Using low fat sour cream in lieu of the cream is just as good and a lot less fat.

Super fast, delicious, and presentable!  After making this recipe many times just as directed I have made a few changes to save time, money, and calories!  I replace the fresh bell pepper mushrooms and green onion with 1 or 2 bags of frozen red, green & yellow bell peppers and onions.  And, I replace the heavy cream with the 1% milk in my fridge. I have also made this with a rotisserie chicken but prefer the white meat breast.  With these changes I can have this dinner on the table in under 20 minutes!!!

I literally just finished cooking & eating this dish, and my boyfriend & I were quite pleased. delicious! I did modify it, most noticeably by using shrimp instead of chicken. I also only used about 1 TBSP of margarine instead of butter. I used only 1/2 green pepper since that is all I had, as well as 1/2 a vidalia onion, again, since that was readily available. Traded the heavy cream for half & half as someone else had mentioned, and I also more or less doubled all of the seasoning, as well as threw about a TBSP of minced garlic in with the shrimp & veggies as they cooked. Also, I was saving my mushrooms, so I switched that out for spinach. No Parmesan at all, as I don't have any. Absolutely awesome! Reminds me of a something I used to eat at Red Lobster, only much better! Thanks for the tasty recipe.

My wife loved it.  I used all organic ingredients.  I substituted the Heavy Cream with Half & Half.  I'll use the Heavy Cream next time just to make the sauce thicker.  You  can make your own cajun spice (Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper,Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, sea salt.  I also used Penne Pasta.  Very easy to make.

I didn't measure the Cajun seasoning and I was worried I added too much and the meal would be too spicy for my kids.  They ate it up!  My 3 year old had seconds and my 2 year old was saying yum, yum and Mmm throughout the meal.   Score!

excellent recipe. this is our new favorite dish. it tastes just like the one from the restraunt i used to work at, and i met my husband. so, it really takes us back to the 'simpler times'. i have really picky kids and they all love it. the only change i made was chopping up the bell peppers and chicken and used penne pasta instead of linguine and mixed it all together. will continue to use!

Amazing and flavorful!  I changed a few things.  Used Spiral Rice Pasta, 1/2 c. Coconut Milk, and 1 lg. Tbsp of Lite Sour Cream.  Also used fresh garlic and lemon juice.  Be careful of the Cajun spice!  I might have over done it just a bit.  It's my first time using it, and a little seems to go a long way.  (And I love spicy food!)  I can't wait to make this for my family!

Amazing dish! I followed the recipe and it was grrreat!  I did however feel I should cook it with low fat sour cream next time like a lot of other people did.  I'm sure that will be great as well.

We had a dinner party last night so I tried this recipe out, it was amazing! I left out the onion and used alfradeo sauce since I didnt have any cream. I also tripled the cajun seasoning, and it had just a small kick to it. Everyone cleared their plate and couldnt compliment enough.  Thank you for sharing!

YUMMY.  I basically doubled it and here is what I did...cooked 3 chix breast w/ cajun seasoning in some butter and evoo.  took out and sliced in strips.  sauteed 8 large mushrooms, 1 green pepper cut in strips and 1 red pepper in strips until peppers started to get soft.  it was taking awhile so then I added the cream mix (a couple dashes of lemon juice, basil, garlic powder, salt, pepper and 2 cups fat free 1/2 and 1/2 ).  brought that to a boil and it was thin but it was cooking the peppers like I like them.  put the chicken back in and kept cooking (soft boil) until it was the right thickness.  I ended up adding about 3 TBS of flour (1 at a time) to thicken the sauce. ended up getting thick.  didn't need the parmesan.  used 13 oz. of whole wheat pasta.  SO GOOD.  husband wants more mushrooms in there.  they made the sauce watery so that maybe why it took so long to thicken.  could probably even use skim milk which i might try next time.  thanks so much- we really loved it.

This is a very flavorful dish.  I used half and half instead of the heavy cream and I wouldn't do that again.  Mine was too thin, even though I used some cornstarch.  The flavor was great though, but follow the recipe as is and it will be great!

I don't give reviews often but since I'm Cajun I thought I'd review this one.  It was a very good and simple dish.  I left out the pepper and it was spicy enough. I used penne and it was great. I'd also suggest simmering the vegetable and chicken before you put the cream.  I used a little evaporated milk and pasta water instead.  I used half butter and half olive oil to brown the chicken to make it healthier and I also sprinkled it with wheat germ.  I used Tony Chachere's for the Creole Seasoning.  These are not changes but only suggestions which I find helpful.  The parmesean cheese really top's off this Terrific Cajun Chicken Pasta!

Excellant recipe, were trying to eat healthier and have been using the whole grain pasta that is pretty much available at all the grocery stores other than that didn't change a thing. I served it again with oven baked cracked wheat sourdough rolls when we had a dinner party and everyone cleaned their plate! And asked for the recipe! I forgot to rate this recipe and have made it for several years now and my family request it at least once a month.

This is a great recipe. I made it for my fiance this weekend and he is already asking when I'll make it again. Next time I'll try to make it with the 1/2 and 1/2 and cornstarch like some of the other reviewers so that I don't gain 20 lbs before my wedding. Other than that I added some crushed chili peppers to give it a little more kick because it reminded me of a dish I used to get in a restaurant and that dish was spicy. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe. I did alter some stuff though. I used a little more chicken breast which I cut into smaller pieces, used only 1 of each pepper, and added more seasonings due to personal preferences.   I totally recommend this recipe to everyone and will be making it again soon!

I can't believe I've never left a review for this. I've made this for about 10 years now. We use rotini, chicken thighs and shrimp. I leave out the lemon pepper as my husband doesn't like it but add more cayenne. I've made variations on this to try and cut back on calories like half milk half cream- using some chicken stock in place of cream (cook it down a bit before adding cream). Many ways to cut back on calories without losing flavor. I wouldn't use this as a weekly rotation dinner but it's a good easy tasty meal for the occasional calorie splurge??

Good base recipe. I used skim milk w/ cornstarch instead of heavy cream. I thought my sauce was too thick while others complained of it being too thin, so I suppose it was my fault. Just be careful when using milk and cornstarch. Add the cornstarch very slowly because for some reason this thickened very fast. Next time I'll add some chicken broth to the sauce as well. I read that some people used lemon juice, but I just went with lemon pepper and it was fine. I sauteed the chicken (and company) with EVOO instead of butter. I added a bit of minced garlic in with the peppers because we love garlic. I used maybe half of 1 green and half of 1 red pepper. Using two full peppers would have been way too much. I skipped the green onion and went with regular, white onion. Also skipped the mushrooms. I used the Creole Seasoning Blend from this site for the cajun seasoning. I cut the chicken into strips so the pieces would have more flavor. I shook them in the bag and also added a bit while the chicken cooked. The cook time for the chicken was a bit longer than suggested, so I imagine full breasts of chicken would take even longer. The flavor was excellent, and I think this cajun flavored chicken might be even better with rice instead of pasta. It gave us some good ideas, though, so thanks.

This was pretty good.  I used green pepper since I didn't have a red one as well.  I added a bit more cajun seasoning to the sauce and used part chicken broth part heavy cream to cut calories a little.  Also added in chopped garlic and onions.  It was good and I will make again.

Winner!  Add onions!  Make it faster, I picked up a package of frozen fajita mix (local Safeway Grocery, frozen dept), it only has strips of chicken breast, green bell pepper, red bell pepper and onion, do not use the package of fajita seasoning, obviously... made it fast and delicious, just as good as when I cut everything up fresh.  Furthermore, I have used both Tony Cachers creole seasoning and Zatarains, and both are excellent.

I made this last night and we absolutely loved it.  It was actually much better than I expected it to be.  I did a couple of things different.  I used chopped garlic instead of powder and I used Creole seasoning instead of Cajun seasoning because that was all I had.  It is a definite keeper for this family.

I used spiral pasta and cut the chicken into bite size pieces and tossed it all together.  I doubled the pasta and sauce (using half cream, half milk) and followed the advice of others, making a roux to thicken the sauce.  I will make this again and again!

This is one of my go-to recipes. I make mine without the green peppers, mushrooms and green onions (just because I don't like them) and add in yellow and orange peppers. I think it makes the dish look prettier too.

I made this on a budget for 24 people so I used less chicken and peppers, but it was still so good! I used half and half and sour cream for the sauce, and I made my own cajun seasoning.  This was a hit for all that love peppers.

I loved this!  I used fat-free half-and-half in place of the heavy cream, with a little flour to thicken it, and it was still very rich.  I used a spicy chipotle linguine.  I omitted the lemon pepper because I didn't have any.  This was a great flavor, great mix of textures.

I LOVE this recipe!!  It is sitting on the stove, waiting for my husband to come home.  I keep picking at it.  The only thing I did differently was to use half heavy cream and half sour cream because that was what I had on hand.  I used Cajun's Choice creole seasoning and I am in love!  The sauce does seem to thicken to a perfect consistancy after sitting for a few minutes, uncovered and off the hot burner.  I don't know if it it because I used some sour cream but I love it.

Just as an FYI- I have been making this recipe for AGES, but it's perfectly fine to use 1/2 and 1/2 or Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2, though the FF is a little sweet for the recipe. I often use a little of each. One of my hubbys fav recipes.

Very quick and simple recipe, I thought the Cajun flavor was a little light, next time I may add a little more. Just needed something to give it a bit more of a kick, but good basic over all recipe.  Just needs a little tweaking!

My husband and I both really liked this and he is not a fan of creamy sauces.  I do saute the chicken and vegetables separately, and sometimes in olive oil rather than butter.  I also like using a regular sweet onion rather than the green onion.  Really tasty!

Wonderful recipe! As good as any I've had at a restaurant. I did use Penne pasta instead of linguine and plan to try it with low fat sour cream next time.

My husband I are are not huge pasta fans, but this was great and I want to make it again and again. I used sour cream, as another suggested rather than cream. And, actually, the only sour cream I had was already mixed with salsa from a previous meal. I used it anyway and it turned out so delicious. I forgot the parmesean cheese but didn't notice until after the fact when I came back to rate this 5 stars!!

Wonderful recipe! There are only two changes I make are using half heavy cream and then I substitute half-half. Also, I add a lot more cajun spice! This is a much loved recipe in our house!

This dish turned out great.  I substituted olive oil for the butter, cayenne pepper for cajun seasoning (because cajun seasoning has too much salt in it), and garlic pepper for the ground black pepper.   One of the best dishes I've ever made! :)

Great recipe and so easy!  I sliced the chicken into strips for easier eating for my 7 year old.  Added red pepper flakes for an extra zing.  Added about 1/4 c of white wine with the peppers and deglazed the pan.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was great and mimicked a version at a local Italian favorite of mine. I changed the pasta to Penne noodles, and increased the butter, and heavy cream to accommodate more pasta(12oz). I recently found this recipe and made it twice. First as written and then with modifications. It is excellent and we cant get enough.

Very good, especially the chicken. We found the linguine a little bland. Next time I will add the Cajun spices directly to the pasta and up the other seasonings.

Great Recipe! But instead of putting all those individual flavors (the lemon, onion, etc) Try adding a bit of Mrs. Dash seasoning. The flavor will not be as fresh or strong, but if you are in a rush for dinner, It's great! I always make this recipe with Mrs. Dash, because it has all the flavors that it asks for.

This was a huge hit, everyone loved it! I will double the sauce next time because i did add more chicken and pasta to feed 7. I loved how easy and quick it was for such an amazing dish. I also dusted off the bread machine and had fresh french bread to go along with it. YUM, Yum, Yum!

I probably won't make this very often since it is really unhealthy, but the recipe was GREAT! I didn't have cajun seasoning so I just substituted it for another spice, but it was still delicious. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe!  I made this recipe as written but omitted the mushrooms and green onions due to personal tastes.  I have made this numerous times since then and started to add cayenne pepper to give it a little more heat.  I have also tried using fat free half & half in place of the heavy cream. The heavy cream is better, but both are delicious!

I love this pasta dish!  It has great flavor.  I modified it just a bit as I didn't have any mushrooms in the house.  I added an extra .5 teaspoon of the cajun seasoning to the chicken thighs, as well as used fresh garlic over powder.  I did not have lemon pepper so I just omitted that.  My fiance loves it too.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

OMG!!!! My newest most favorite meal!!! It was terrific! Just the right amount of seasoning (left off basil and lemon pepper). Better than but similar to Olive Gardens Chicken Scampi.

Did not have heavy cream and wanted to reduce fat content...used fat free half & half, sour cream, and a dollop of part skim ricotta cheese. Flavor came out well just too watery. Will need to thicken up next time. Also eliminated  chicken and added more veggies and made with penne.

Wonderful!!!  Tastes great the next day too! I used half a lemon instead instead of lemon pepper, I used the pasta with an assormant of shapes so my child would eat it.  I also cut everything into cubes (bells and chicken).  I love it and I only use 2 pans for this dish, another plus!!!

Great Recipe!! Definitely give this a try. I dont follow the measurements for the spices at all. I add much more and it never seems enough. You will definitely need to at least double them but start with the measurements given by the recipe to see if you like it and then add as you go. I also do not follow the directions and have perfected my own way to make this. It really is a fool proof recipe, you cant go wrong with it!! So YUMMY!!!

This recipe is sooooo good. It's an absolute favorite of mine. I put freshly squeezed lemon juice in the sauce for extra kick and sometimes I use four different colored peppers (red, orange, yellow, and green) to make it extra pretty and flavorful. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I love this and have made it for years!  I do make alot more sauce than it calls for.  I've also substituted half & half or evaporated milk and cornstarch when I don't have whipping cream on hand and it was still great!  I have used frozen green peppers and they were fine also.  I also stir the parmesan into the sauce as it is cooking so it has time to melt nicely.  Everyone always asks me for the recipe and absolutely LOVES it!

I had to use sour cream as that's what I had on hand, but it still came out rather addictive. Will definately be making again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic flavor!! I had to give it a 4 because the sauce was way too thin! I had to put in about a 2 tbsps.to the sauce to get it to thicken, plus let it simmer for 20 minutes to get it right! Other than that, the chicken was delicious! I doubled the cajun spice and added a little flour to make sure it would coat well. I also used fresh garlic and jalapeno to add more of a kick! I will make this again!!

This recipe was okay. I did double the spices and used half and half instead of heavy cream. The sauce was weak but thickened up with the addition of corn starch and once I added the parmesan, it was fine. One person thought it was too spicy, I think it depends on the brand of cajun seasoning you have. I only had one option at my grocery store. I'm not sure if I will make it again.

This was excellent!  I used Tony's salt free seasoning and olive oil instead of the butter.  Also used lowfat buttermilk instead of cream.  Also used Barilla plus pasta instead of white pasta.  This is certainly a keeper!!!  Taste like it's from a high end cajun restaurant like Copeland's!

This is a super recipe, however, there are some changes that I made to improve it slightly.  I would suggest cutting down on the amount of red and green peppers slightly, and quarter the mushrooms rather than slicing them.  In addition I would suggest draining approximately half of the liquid after cooking the meat in order to yield a thicker sauce.  Overall an awesome meal, and it went over really well with the guests.  (A recipe for a super cajun seasoning on Allrecipes: Simple Cajun Seasoning

I am a big fan of this one! You can change it up to use just about any pasta you want (Penne, Fettucini, or etc.) I also use all fresh ingredients, esp. garlic (which is always a given in my house) and this recipe is absolutely perfect!

This was really tasty.  Next time I make it I'll kick the heat up a bit by adding extra Cajun seasonings and Cayenne pepper.

This was the best. I added a few ingredients to kick i up a notch. 1 tsp red pepper. I didn't use any green bell pepper as I didn't have any on hand, but it still turned out great. Very restaurant quality like. This recipe is very tasty, easy and fast.

This was simply awesome.  We added more chicken than was asked, so we doubled the spices in the final stage and added an extra teaspoon of cajun seasoning in the shake process.  It was very tasty, and very easy.

Fast and easy this is a "make again Mom" recipe! I added half of an orange pepper and used additional cajun seasoning. Next time I'm going to substitute the chicken for shrimp and add smoked paprika! Yum!

this recipe was phenomenal.  there's no other word for it.  It's one of my new "impress the guests" recipes, because as my mom described it, "this is better than eating out at a restaurant."  the recipe is beautiful with the peppers (the first time i used just the red and green, but on the second time i switched some out for yellow and orange as well).  my suggestions: add more mushrooms.  LOTS more mushrooms than it calls for.  to make it healthier, used olive oil instead of butter to saute the chicken, and i replaced the cream with half and half.  this made for a slightly runnier sauce, but by using angel hair pasta in place of linguine, the smaller noodles were better able to absorb the sauce, and it worked well.  i also about tripled the spices, but i happen to like things extraordinarily spicy.  i made these changes to my tastes, but if you make it as is, you will still have an absolutely delicious, beautiful, phenomenal meal in front of you.

Thanks for the recipe Carol!  This was great.  Both of my kids were here for dinner and everyone loved it.  The chicken really had a "kick".  We all love spicey food.

Wow.  I went to Vermont last week, and in the snow storm in a VERY small town I was able to get all the ingredients at a small store.  Like others, I did cut up the chicken, I added a 1/4 lemon instead of the lemon/pepper combo, and minced up 3 cloves of garlic instead of the powder.  Because I like mushrooms, I added more as well.  I used a pint of lite sour cream instead of the cream as others suggested and it worked great!  I was glad to lighten it up.  Since we had some left over, I did notice the sauce was not enough.  Next time I would use 16oz of sour cream (as I love the sauce) and just boost up some of the spices.  Plus, I like my peppers well cooked, so I sauteed them longer until soft.  Because the place I was at had no grater, I cut the parmesan in chunks and added them at the end.  The flavor was fabulous and now that I'm home look forward to making this again.... soon.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I was a little worried about making this dish because my kids are kind of cry babies about spicey food, but my husband begged.  WOW... what an amazing dish.  The only things I changed was I used penne and fresh garlic.  Oh I also cut the vegies and meat into bite size peices.  My kids loved it.  They cleared their plates and asked if we could have it again next week.

This is incredibly good. Very complex flavour. Used 1 cup skimmed milk and 2-3 tbs cornstarch instead of heavy cream,butter flavour canola spray instead of butter, and skipped the cheese, for a low fat/calorie version.And it still turns out great. Thank you so much Carol.

Cream flavor was*very* strong.  We ended up adding significantly more Cajun spices, pepper, and salt to compensate.  All in all, quick and satisfying dinner!!

The dish is fine, except that there is too much cream. The dish would be better, if it were more of a marinara base. Personally, the cajun spices should be heavier.

Fabulous! I added a good amount more cajun seasoning to the chicken than the recipe called for, we love it spicy! Used one red and one yellow pepper also used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. SO DELICIOUS!

I used olive oil, 1/2 lite sour cream and 1/2 2% milk to lighten. Fresh garlic and lemon juice too. Very good recipe!

I loved making this recipe. I did make a few minor changes, I added red pepper flakes and upped the cajun. I love spicy foods! Instead of heavy cream (due to the fat) I had low fat sour cream and to make it a little more saucy I threw in some chicken broth. I also added a little lemon juice because I felt like something was missing. It totally made the flavors pop. Also I used real garlic instead of the powder. Just for color I added yellow peppers and tossed out the mushrooms (because I hate them). Over all this recipe is easy and great! My picky husband ate every bite.

Thickened the sauce a tiny bit with 1 T of flour and some parm.  Good, fast recipe when you multi-task!  Works great when you have a vegetarian and 2 meat lovers sitting down together for dinner b/c you can just keep the chicken separate until you serve it.

This recipe is excellent!!  It is very similar to TGI Friday's 'Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta' (minus the shrimp), which is one of my favorite meals at Friday's.  Now I can have something almost identical to it for a lot less money and not even have to leave the house!  My husband loved it as well. Can't wait to make it again!!

We cooked this dish for the first time tonight and we loved it. We didn't have any cajun seasoning so we used southwest seasoning and it was still excellent. We like to think it tasted better than anything we would order in a restaurant. We will definitely cook this again!

SO good! Everybody loved it! I used a bunch more cajun seasoning and used half and half and sour cream for the base, but it turned out really nice. I didn't have red peppers, but I did have diced tomatoes, so I used those with the green peppers and onions and I didn't have mushrooms so I just omitted them. I will definitely make again.

This has become my husbands favorite dish by far.  Although instead of the peppers and onions that he won't eat I simply added fresh brocoli which brightens the dish right up.  Also instead of  the cream, I use Half/Half

Yum Yum this one was a winner!  Delicious.  The heavy cream was a bit more indulgent then we should get used to so I look forward to trying a few of the lower-fat versions suggested in other ratings.  I added red pepper flakes to the sauce which  pleased the waiting tastebuds.  We shall dine again on this in the future.

I tried this last night and absolutely loved it!  It really does taste like something you'd get at an Italian restaraunt.  My only complaint was the small serving size... I needed enough to feed a group of 12 and I'm always a bit wary of the measurements I get when I adjust the serving size, but this still turned out wonderfully.  I didn't have cream and was out of milk so I ended up substituting half evaporated milk and half sour cream for the cream and got a perfectly creamy sauce.  I think I may up the Cajun seasonings a bit next time because I would have liked a bit more spice, but it was perfect for the kids!  And I think I may substitute different vegetables, too, with whatever I have on hand.  But this recipe is great!  A new favorite.

This was really good! It was spicy and nice! I modified it slightly (made a roux, added evaporated milk and probably will make extra of the thick white sauce cause it needed a bit more than the 1 cup...) but relatively simple, and good meal...

This was tasty! I didn't expect my four-year-old to touch it but she really enjoyed it. I used less cream and added a little milk, then thickened with Ultra Gel and it was still rich and satisfying. Thanks for a keeper!

Extremely tasty.  I did make a few altercations however:  I doubled the spices like a lot of other reviewers did, and I sauteed one dose of the spices in the butter before putting in anything else, and I put the second dose of spices in where the recipe says to.  Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty closely - I would highly recommend.

Great recipe but next time I will double the seasonings and substitute sour cream for the heavy cream.  It tasted like restaurant quality as is but we like a lot more spice and the cream is just too fattening for frequent dinners.

Very good taste, not great presentation. I made the following changes: 3 t. Cajun seasoning, no green pepper, 1.5 c. fat free half-n-half, added 1/2 T. cornstarch to sauce.... turned out delicious and slightly spicy!

This recipe was outrageously good.  I am a vegetarian so I used vegetarian QUORN Naked Chik'n cutlets and YVES jalepeno sausages for the "meat".  I used fettucini.  For veggies, I added onions, garlic, spinach, tomatoes, jalapenos, green peppers, red peppers and shredded carrots.

Love it! Used pre-cooked grilled chicken strips for a time-saver and used sour cream in the sauce. I wanted a recipe that was close to the cajun shrimp plate at O'Charley's and I've found it. Husband loved it too!

Very good.  Will definitely make again.  Next time I think I will increase the cajun seasoning and add a little cayenne.  It was a little more mild than I expected.

This was my first attempt at a dish like this.  Turned out awesome!  I loved the peppers in it.  The only thing I changed was to cut up the chicken into strips before cooking and omitted onions and mushrooms because we don't like those ingredients.  So good though!  and a beautiful dish!

This was extremely quick and easy!  I made a couple of changes to fit what I had on hand - light sour cream instead of the heavy cream and fajita seasoning instead of cajun seasoning.  My husband said it was like eating a fajita over pasta!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was a great recipe.  The only changes I made was to add lemon juice and add a lot of garlic, as well as hot sauce to give a little extra kick.  I think I added a little too much pasta so I had to add more flavor.  Very good.

This is so good! My new favorite. I'm not much for measuring, but I tried to follow this pretty closely. Okay, I made a few little modifications, but purely to suite presonal taste. I left out the mushrooms and added some strips of yellow onion. I also tried a bite with lemon pepper, and decided against it. Bow tie pasta is easier to eat so I used them instead. Zatarain's Creole Seasoning was liberally applied, and I added extra salt and pepper. The cream sauce was a little runny so I let it simmer while the pasta finished boiling, and I threw in a few pats of butter when I was stirring it all up. The sauce thickened to perfection, and it tasted amazing! I prefer highly spiced food, and this hit the spot. It seems like I made a lot of changes, but none of these takes away from the original intent. Delicious!

Very good! I used 8 oz of mushrooms, roasted red peppers and doubled the parm cheese (this also helps thicken the sauce). Also used penne pasta- it soaks up the sauce better. Will definitely be making again.

This was good, but I thought the cream sauce was a bit too rich for me.  My husband, on the other hand, liked the sauce.  If I make it again, it will be just for him.

This was really good.  I used quite a bit more seasoning than called for.  Got the sauce just the right thickness by adding some corn starch.

Da bomb!

I used Jmonroe62 suggested "Cajun Spice Seasoning" from allrecipes.com and the dish came out amazing.

I can't wait to make it again!

I thought this was way good, and my picky boyfriend liked it all right. May have been better if I hadn't experimented without reading other comments. Not sure if anyone else has said this, but mine came out thin when I used half & half. Next time I'll start the sauce by making a roux to help it thicken. Or hopefully the store won't be out of lowfat cream. I could fully imagine eating this every week, great flavors I thought.

Excellent dish. I have made it a few times and found that a little flour or cornstarch helps thicken it a bit and some crushed red pepper gives it a nice kick.

This was FANTASTIC!  I'm definitely keeping this recipe around. I had to triple the recipe, and I think 3 cups of heavy cream is too much for the dish, so next time I'll go lighter on the cream. Still, this was a very tasty dish that I plan on putting in my rotation!

YUM! Followed recipe but didn't have any mushrooms. Can't wait to try again with shrooms. I guess if I have to nitpick, I waited for the sauce to thicken up a bit more than it did, but hey, cream is cream, you can't really go wrong. Excellent recipe.

Took recomendation from other reviews and added more seasoning at the end. Used yellow onion and omitted the mushroom. It was Delicious. I also used bowtie pasta because it was all I had. Would definitely make again. Thanks

Yu-uhm!  My husband gave this a 5 star all the way!  I added a little extra of each of the spices, but I think it would've been ok without doing that.  This has become a regular!

This was an excellent recipe.  My husband even raved about it the next morning.  The only change I made was to use whole wheat spaghetti instead of the recommended pasta.  Came out great.  Thanks for another keeper from this great site

So lemme start off by saying that in 18 years of Marriage I have probably cooked maybe once per year, so I wanted to start doing something special for my wife. The recipe is easy, and to make it "healthier" I used low fat cream, and only 250ml for a 4 person portion. Very nice, and something I will make again

This recipe was great! I omitted the onions and mushrooms (just due to personal preference). Everyone loved it and certainly wanted seconds. Served with warm crusty cheese bread. Totally awesome recipe, will be making it regularly now- thanks!

My family loved this recipe. I did as a previous review stated. I made my sauce alfredo style and added a little cayenne to the sauce. YUMMY!!! I will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this several times now, and it gets better every time.  Whether you chop up the chicken breasts and pepper, or slice them.. it doesn't seem to matter.  I have used yellow, green, and orange bell pepper, have omitted the mushrooms (husband won't eat them) and adjusted the amount of the cajun spice (we like it extra spicy) this is still one of the easiest tastiest recipes I have come across!!

this was excellent and easy, if your find it to salty its because u are using can parm, dont, use fresh and grate yourself big difference in taste, if sauce is to thin let it sit for a few minutes before u serve, i will be adding this to our favorite list, this would be good with shrimp or crab,

Was very good and made a lot. Next time I will put more cajun seasoning so it's spicier. This will be added to the rotation at my house. :)

Excellent! My daughter surprised us by making this recipe for dinner on her day off from school - she followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of making extra pasta) - it was wonderful! ...the only problem was that it was SO good, it was hard to stop eating!

Wow this was so good!! I did change a few things.... added a whole onion, used all red peppers, doubled the sauce, and added cayenne to the sauce. I did cook the chicken in the pan and then removed it the oven to finish cooking. Then I sauteed the veggies, with a little butter and fresh garlic. I removed the veggies to a bowl and then started the sauce. I did make the sauce more in an alfredo style. Used half a stick of butter, added the cream, spices, and parmesean cheese. Then I tossed the veggies, and chicken back in to simmer for about 5 min. It isn't easy on calories but is worth it for a special occasion meal with a gourmet taste.

I made this for my mom's birthday, and she liked it a lot. I haven't cooked major dishes much, and this was extremely easy to make. I modified some parts after reading other people's comments though, like adding cornstarch. & I couldn't find any Cajun seasoning in stores, so I had to improvise and use Creole seasoning instead. But, I'm definitely making this in the future.

I have been making this for years and it's my daughter's favorite recipe. I leave out the green peppers and use extra cajun seasoning for a nice and spicy dish. Because I leave out the green peppers, I add extra mushrooms. Wonderful pasta dish. I wouldn't attempt to make this low fat. We don't have this very often because it's so rich but it's wonderful "as-is."

I really wanted us to like this one but we really didn't care for it.  Maybe if I'd thickened the sauce?   It was runny.  Thanks for the recipe though.  I do give it points for being easy.  :)

This recipe was so easy to make. I'm a college student living with my mom and my boyfriend so im always looking for new things to cook and this one was a big hit. The only thing i changed was the chicken i cut it into cubed pieces and i added a roue of butter,flour,lemon pepper and garlic powder to thicken the sauce it turned out perfect!!!

This recipe is awesome and I love it. I usually dont have all the ingredients so I omit things here and there and it always turns out the same, which is delicious. Its a pretty heavy dish so I don't like to make it that often but when I do people love it and gobble it up. I love the cajun seasoning and I use A LOT of it but sometimes using too much can get salty so becareful! If you use a lot of that seasoning, I suggest that you omit putting in salt.

YUM!!!! I had no peppers so I used mushrooms and added pancetta to add another dimension. Delicious! I also added more parmesan cheese than called for. I was eating it cold from the fridge the next day! Definitely not light but very yummy!

YUM YUM!  This dinner is fast, yet it is super enough to serve to guests.  I do cut the chicken into pieces, add twice as many mushrooms, and add a lot more Cajun seasoning (probably ~3 tbls...we like things spicy).

I would serve this recipe to guests. I prefer to cut up the chicken rather than serve them whole. I also omit the mushrooms.

Recipe was pretty good, but it didn't have the spice I associate with "Cajun" cooking.

Yummy!! I doubled the seasoning, used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and sprinkled cayenne on the finished product. I served it with garlic bread. I am going to be making this recipe for years to come! Thanks!

I added a tablespoon of oil for the saute, left out the mushrooms, and used half & half instead of the heavy cream. It was well received. ^_^

I made this, as the real first pasta dish I've ever made, and it was great. I pretty much followed the directions to a tee, but substituting 4 garlic cloves rather than garlic salt.

I modified it a bit. I did not cook the chicken with all that Cajun spice...just some. Then I put some Cajun spice in the sauce. It tasted just like it was from a restaurant!

Absolutely delicious! I cut the chicken into bite size pieces because of the children and because I think it gets seasoned better that way. I thickened it just a little and served it with garlic bread. Seasoning was not too spicy so it was good for the whole family. For an adult only dinner I will add a little more spice as we like it hot. You won't be disappointed with this recipe.

If you like spicy this recipe is for you. Even though my family said it was good I think it was a little spicy for them.  I thought it was great. I omitted the mushrooms, used a big red onion instead of green onion and used half and half instead of cream and extra peppers. Next time I make it I will use less cajun seasoning so the family will enjoy it more but if you like it spicy then it's great as written.

Outstanding, just like a dish from one of our local Italian place.  I used fresh pasta but next time I will used the kind that comes dry in a package because the fresh stuff seemed to absorb more liquid than I would like - I think that the regular pasta would allow the sauce to remain creamy.  The flavor was outstanding, and the texture was perfect.

wonderful!!
made mine with roasted red pepper and a few sun dried tomatoes. sauce was made with half and half, and turned out a bit thinner than expected, but was well absorbed by the pasta, and not at all a problem once assembled. for cajun spice, i used paul prudhommes poultry magic, and drenched it!!

next time I'm going to try it with shrimp and substitute buttermilk.

This recipe is very versatile and very yummy!  Kind of like a skillet alfredo.  Did i forget to mention that it was easy and didn't take forever to make?  Next time I will be trying with shrimp and extra Tony Chacheres.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is excellent! All 6 people in my home LOVED this. Even the 9 month old! (I put his food in the blender.)I made 12 servings thinking I would have left overs with no such luck. Oh I added more cajun seasing to my plate just because I LOVE spicy. I will make this recipe alot. Thanks for posting.

This recipe was amazing, just the right about of spice!  I will be making again and again.  I used light cream instead of the heavy whipping cream but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  It was quick and easy to make!  YUMMY!

This is very good, but it absolutely NEEDS more salt!  I thought it was a little bland, then I added a lot of salt and it was awesome!!  Also, I would try half and half - the heavy cream is not at all subtle and the recipe calls for a lot of it.  However, with about triple the salt it would be great!

i thought this was really good. it definitely needed more salt and i'll probably add more cajun seasoning next time as well (it wasn't spicy at all so i think it just depends on the cajun seasoning you have on hand). my partner thought it tasted a little plain with the first bite but it got better the more we ate. 
the sauce wasn't thick enoughm
but overall, this was pretty delicious and i will definitely be making it again.

So good, and so easy too eat way too much. My husband and I were unable to move for some time after dinner, which is both a very good, and a very bad thing. So, so yummy.

I really liked this recipe, however I only used some of the ingredients. I used penne pasta, then I started cooking the peppers. I did the peppers first, so that they wouldn't be crunchy. I seasoned the chicken very well with Cajun spice with S&P. I added the chicken to the pan with the peppers then I added the pasta and lastly the heavy cream. Although I only used the spice and salt and pepper, it came out great. Next time I make it, I'll add chopped jalapeno peppers to it. If you've ever been to Uno's Restaurant, it kinda reminded me of their "Rattlesnake Pasta".  The hubby loved it so much his tummy hurt b/c he over did it.

I liked this but hubby and kids did not! I found the spicy taste very nice - they thought it was too spicy.
I must admit, I changed a major part of this because I had no cream..I added tomatoes (tinned) and some white wine instead and had this with a red sauce.  Myabe the others would have liked it better with the cream sauce - I will make it again properly and hope they do!
Thanks.

We loved it! I added 1/4 c. breadcrumbs to the cajun seasoning and it was great...I'll remove the chicken next time before I add the cream just so it stays cripsy but it was still wonderful. I omited the mushrooms (my husband doesn't like them) but I think asparagus would be a great add for next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent. I would have given it a 5, but my wife and father thought it was just a little spicy. I did not. I would make very few adjustments to this one. Prepare this one and enjoy. Thanks

My family loved this one.
I scaled it for 6 people and made a couple of changes.  I added more cajun seasoning, cut the chicken into bite size pieces, used the whole container of parmesan cheese and added it to the sauce instead of on top.
we will make this one again and again!!

Absolutely delicious!!  The only changes I made were to cut the chicken into bite size pieces and add a little extra cajun seasoning.  Other than that I kept everything else the same.  Will definitely be making this again.

Amazing! I just made this for the first time and plan on making it again soon.  I substituted half and half for the cream and added a dollop of sour cream, but left everything else the same. This makes about 4 servings in my opinion, so count on alot of delicious leftovers!

Absolutely wonderful flavor (flavor, not heat).  This receipe works great with four chicken breasts and a full package of linguine.

This is a quick and easy dish.  I really thought that there wouldn't be enough chicken or enough pasta but it worked out perfect.  Slightly spicy without being flaming hot.  I really enjoyed this meal.

My wife who does not like Cajun, LOVED this. I made it just like the recipe said. It was fantastic. It would be good if you added crawfish tails or shrimp to it as well. I did put some crushed red pepper in mine as well (not the whole dish, just my own).  It was great. Thanks!

Delicious!!!!  My only struggle is that I can't get the sauce right.  When I followed the recipe exactly it was too thin.  The next time I melted the cheese in it and the thickness was right, but I could never keep it the right temperature.  We had to keep warming it up!  Also marinaded the chicken in oil, vinegar and the Cajun seasonings and then grilled on the BBQ!  YUMMY!!!

Absolutely fantastic!!!!!  I called my Mom half way through dinner to give her the recipe!  I did make a few minor changes.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces, used lemon and herb seasoning instead of lemon pepper, and used red onion instead of green.  Delicious!!!!  This one is definately a keeper!!!

Everyone loved it.  Used lowfat cream (store didn't have heavy cream) and it still came out with great flavor.  Used a bit extra of cajun seasoning for more kick.  Also cut up my chicken pieces and used angel hair pasta.  Quick, easy and good!

I have made this recipe on numerous occasions now and it is amazing.  Everyone loves it.  Instead of heavy cream I often use half and half so it's not quite so rich.  Still amazing.  It's my boyfriend's favourite meal!

I didn't notice that before I bought the ingredients, and was afraid that it wouldn't make enough, but it did, even with an extra person at the table (so this recipe served 3 adults and 2 children as written.)  I'd say the only change I'd make next time is to add a little cornstarch or something to the cream to make it a little less runny.  Good recipe, though.

I made this this weekend and it turned out pretty yummy. I did read the reviews and make a few alterations. I pounded my chicken boobs thin, then i cut em in half, then mixed the cajun seasoning with flour and dipped the chicken in and cooked it in the pan. Then i took the chicken out, and put the veggies in. Instead of mushrooms i used zuchinni. I cooked them around until done. Then stirred in the cream and spices, with the addition of a little more cajun seasoning.Oh yeah, i added a little sour cream as others had suggested. Then i put the chicken back in the pan, and swished it around. Put the lid on and simmered for 5 minutes. Took the chicken out, then stirred the noodles in. As others commented, it made way too much. But it was tasty. I thought it was pretty good, my boyfriend loved it.

This was so easy to make, and tasted delicious. I added more seasonings to my taste and cut the chicken into bite size pieces, will definitely be making again.

Very pretty dish.. tastes pretty good.  It's not too spicy.  I would put a little more Cajun powder and black ground pepper if that's what you want.

I made this for my partner & another friend & it certainly hit the spot.  Like others I added cornflour & some sour-cream but otherwise stuck with the recipe - think next time I'll add a little bit of chile powder or cumin for the tiniest bit more of a kick - am having it for left-overs today though!

This was a great recipe. I was able to make it in a hurry when, at the last minute, I had to cook dinner for 9 people. The all enjoyed it!

Note: When cooking this dish for a larger crowd you have to play around with the scaling of this recipe. ie: you cannot simply multiply the amount of each ingredient by 4 for a group of 8. I didn't require nearly the amount of sauce that the scaled up recipe suggested.

Thanks!

This is one of my weeknight standbys--it is quick, easy and absolutely delicious.  I make this when I wish we could go out but we can't because it's as good as a pasta dish you would get in a restaurant.

This was a delicious dish! I made this with shrimp instead of chicken.  I also added cornstarch to thicken the sauce and used reduced carb spaghetti of all things and my boyfriend said it was "Orgasmic" and requested this dish again soon after.  Next time I will add both chicken and shrimp!

I made this the first time for company, trusting it would be a success.  It was!  I doubled the recipe since it said it served two.  I cut the chicken up into slices and used penne instead.  It looked great and tasted even better.  I was afraid it might be too spicy but it wasn't. My husband does not like pasta very much but he loved this dish!  Thanks for a "keeper" reicpe!!

This recipe is a winner!  VERY generous portions though (not that my husband complained!)  I didn't make any changes, nor do I intend to!  I was a little concerned about the cajun spice, but I needn't have worried.  Nice and quick for busy week-days, too.  Thanks for a good one!

I added 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms and omitted the peppers because of personal preference.  Sauce was thin as others have mentioned, but at cornstarch slurry solves that problem.  This is a wonderfully tasty dish.

My family loves pasta and this recipe. It is a great hit with company as well.  One piece of advice is to make sure that you let it heat thoroughly once the pasta is added, or else you will be serving soup.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did omit the salt though because my cajun seasoning had plenty, and so did the lemon pepper.  I used a combination of heavy and light cream (only because it's what I had in the house) and it seemed a little thin so I thickened it with some cornstarch.  Once it I took it off the heat it seemed a little thick, so I probably didn't need to thicken it at all.  Used angel hair pasta (just a personal preference) and the flavor was awesome.  My husband loved it too.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks, Carol!

This recipe is excellent!! I marinated the chicken breast for a couple hours with "McCormick's Cajun Seasoning", galic powder and a little "Mrs Dash" and sauteed my vegetables before adding them in with the sauce.

 Thank You for sharing this great recipe with me.

Easy and delicious! I had cut this recipe out of 'Taste of Home' magazine years ago and so glad to find it again.  I always add a little olive oil to butter when frying or sauting.  I had no heavy cream so subbed 4 oz. cream cheese and a cup of milk.  Also added a can of chicken broth and some white wine and let that all reduce.  I don't care for lemon pepper so used juice of one lemon.  Great flavors - will make often.

I found the sauce gets dry with the pasta so it tends to get less saucey, but really tastey overall, loved the cajun in it. I will defenetaly make this again and extra sauce with it also.

This was ok, a little mild for my tastes, but came to life more with the adition of a little salt and butter. I did not use an MSG based cajun seasoning and omitted the mushrooms due to an allergy so maybe that is why mine was sort of bland. I served it with cinamon and brown sugar yams and a salad.

WONDERFUL! Instead of heavy cream I used half and half and added a small amount of cornstarch to thickin.  It was so flavorful. After cutting my veggies up I drizzled a little olive oil and garlic and onion powder on them and let them sit while I prepared the chicken.  
This recipe was a hit.  There were no leftovers.

This is just awesome.  I've tried variations of it, but love it the way it is.  I have to scale down the Cajun just a bit for the hubby tho, but not by much.

The first time I made this I doubled the chicken, and so therefor I doubled the cajun seasoning.  Big mistake.  I loved it that way, but the people in my household who only like a mild spice din't like it as much.  The second time I did it, I again doubled the chicken but left the cajun spice amount the same.  What a difference that made!!  Very delicious, very creamy very easy and quick to make.  A perfect school night meal!

Really really fabulous!  My five year old ate five servings!  I used penne instead of linguine because I don't have time to cut up pasta for my four small children, but it worked really well.

AWESOME DISH!!
My husband doesn't like pepppers, so I substituted fresh broccoli for color.  I also added way more mushrooms than the recipe calls for.
I have made this several times.  The sauce is runny if you make it exactly like the recipe calls for. 
To make this an even easier dish, I now buy Alfredo sauce mix (the dry package type) and use it in place of the sauce ingredients in the recipe.  It doesn't seem to take away any of the flavor and makes it much more low-fat.

The parmesan cheese makes all the difference in this recipe.  I found that I had to adjust some of the amounts of the ingredients to taste, and once I added some tomatoes it was wonderful.

The chicken had a nice flavor to it, but I didn't care for the sauce or lack there of.  I used fat free sour cream so maybe that was the problem.  Without the flavoring on the chicken this would have been very boring.  Very pretty dish though with all the peppers.

A bit spicey for the kids.  Make chicken nuggets for them and enjoy the dish with your spouse!  Very easy.  Very tastey.  I used Emeril's southwest seasoning. Has just enough "kick" to it.  Definitely on my top ten recipe list!

This was absolutely delicious! My husband raved over it.  He loves cajun food and I really have never made cajun before.  I came to the right place for a recipe.  Instead of only 2 tablespoons of cajun seasoning, I used the whole jar.  It gave it the kick it needed.  From now on this dish will be a regular at our house.

This is a delicious recipe.  I don't like peppers so I left them out and the recipe is just as good!  Also a variation on the recipe would be to add artichoke hearts or sun dried tomatoes!

Whoa! what a dish.  My boyfriend doesn't like pasta w/ cheese sauces, but he loved this! I added extra cajun seasoning just before serving.  A family favorite. I think I'll make it again tonight!
