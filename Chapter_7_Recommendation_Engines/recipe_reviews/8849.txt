I learned a great tip to crisp up chicken on the food channel show..Calorie Commando. Place chicken on a wire rack (like the kind you cool cookies on). This allows the bottom of the chicken crisp up as well.  I use chicken tenders.  I baked 15 minutes at 400, then broil for 5 minutes for extra crispness.  Instead of butter if you want to save calories is to add a capful of vinegar to some milk (it is a substitute for buttermilk).  This tenderizes the chicken as well and the coating sticks well to it. Then spritz with a light spray of oil and bake.  This recipe also works well with Panko or cornflake crumbs.  I've used this recipe to oven fry zucchini and mushrooms too.  A much more healthy alternative than deep fried and they actually taste better!  It's amazing how many calories you can save by using these simple steps.  Thanks for the great recipe!

these were great!  Very tasty and crisp and much better than fried.  I used a beaten egg to get the batter to stick rather than melted butter for a lower fat content.

Best chicken nuggets that I have ever had.  I used some suggestions from the reviews, and they turned out very well.  I used skim milk to coat the chicken pieces, instead of butter, before coating with the mixture, and I used the cooling racks on top of a cookie sheet to place the nuggets on, so they would be crisp on both sides.

These chicken nuggets were great and easy to make.  PLEASE, EVERYONE: IF YOU ARE GOING TO RATE A RECIPE, PLEASE FIRST FOLLOW IT!!!  IT IS SO ANNOYING TO READ REVIEWS (ESPECIALLY POOR ONES) AND SEE THAT THE COOK DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN.  It is great to make changes and add your own twist but that shouldn't affect how you rate the recipe.

These were very good and tender!  I didn't want to use all of that butter, so I used two beaten eggs mixed with a splash of olive oil.  I was running short on Parm so I used half the amount.  Served with Honey mustard dressing- very tasty!

I reviewed this one a few years back...still making these today.  Do what a reviewer below suggests and use panko crumbs plus bake on a rack.  I turn them 3/4 through for even browning.  I also add pressed garlic to the butter for extra yummy flavor.

These were great! I used 1 1/2 lbs. chicken tenders cut in half. Used only 1/2 tsp.salt, Since bread crumbs were seasoned, I  reduced basil to 1/2 tsp. and also added 1/4 tsp. black pepper. Put all dry ingredients in a plastic baggie and added my chicken,after dunking in butter, in small batches to coat. Used some of the left over crumbs sprinkled on top and drizzled whatever butter I had left over on top of the chicken. I used fresh grated parmesan and they came out wonderful! I used to pan fry my chicken nuggets and it took forever,this is so much faster and easier and the best nuggets I have made so far. Thanks Teresa!

These were awesome! A lot better than any frozen or fast food chicken nuggets. I made them for my boyfriend with some corn on the cob as a side.  We loved the dinner.  I recommend flipping the nuggets about 3/4 of the way, to make sure one side doesn't get too brown.

I was pleasantly surprised by these.  Great flavor.  I made the following changes: (1) instead of butter, I used about 1/2 T. of vinegar and 1/2 c. milk and soaked the chicken pieces in it for about one hour in the fridge; (2) put all of the dry ingredients in a bag and spooned the chicken pieces in, shaking to coat (no mess!); (3) sprayed with cooking spray for a crispier coating; and (4) baked on a wire rack set on a cookie sheet.

Very delicious! Did not run out of bread crumb mixture. As a matter of fact, I had to make a little more to finish out chicken strips! Next time, I'm gonna have spaghetti sauce as a dip. My husband and I agreed that would go well with the chicken nuggets.  lkjohnson

I make these all the time for the little man of the house - they freeze great! I don't use butter, instead I use egg to coat the chicken - using butter makes them less healthy and also VERY salty. I make up four-five breasts at a time, get about 30 nuggets out of that. I cook them for the whole time (then throw a few in my mouth!) and pop them in a freezer bag. Whenever we want a quick and easy lunch, we pop five of them in the oven at 400 degrees for around ten minutes, easy peezy!! Thanks for an awesome idea and awesome recipe!!

What a great recipe! My whole family loved these nuggets. I did not have too much of the bread crumbs left, but I did use half of the salt, thyme and basil like some of the others suggested!

This was an easy and excellent recipe. Will definitely keep this one (even my five year old stepdaughter liked it). Will try it next time without the butter (dipping it in milk) so that it is lower in fat. Thanks for the great recipe.

I wanted to make something like Chicken McNuggets to please the kids. I didn't have a lot of ingredients on-hand or a lot of time to search, so I went with this recipe. I told my wife I'd make her something else for dinner, anticipating the final product would be something like McNuggets.

I used the modifications to the recipe that RESALEAPPAREL recommended in his/her 2 Nov. 2006 review (cooked on a cookie rack, used 1 Tbsp vinegar and a cup of milk instead of butter, broiled for last five minutes). I also had to use mostly Ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.

As soon as I sampled it out of the oven, I stopped preparing the second meal for my wife. These suckers are healthy and good. Turned out moist and delicious. I cut them into 1.5" squared or slightly oblong shapes. Highly recommended.

I cut this recipe in half and used two smallish chicken breasts. The breadcrumbs I used were homemade. I did need a touch more butter to coat my pieces. I baked these on a large shallow pan that I coated with foil and placed a wire cookie sheet on. These turned out really nicely-- cooking them on a wire rack made them crispier than they would have been just cooked on the baking sheet. The kids were quite surprized that I could make chicken nuggets at home. The kids ate them but they did not care all the thyme in this recipe. I'll make this again but I'll find some way to lighten this up (like maybe using egg white to coat the chicken instead of all that butter) and use italian seasoning instead of the individual spices that are called for.

Made these along with sweet potato fries (both oven baked).  My grandkids BEG for these everytime I cook for them. I used milk to dip the chicken as I didn't want to use all that butter. I served them with ranch dressing, BBQ sauce & honey mustard. They were great! ("dipping" is half of the fun for kids!)

Very tasty healthy alternative to store bought chicken nuggets (which I haven't had since college probably 8 years ago).  I decreased the amount of bread crumbs by 1/4cup and increased parm(fresh) by 1/4 cup.  Omitted salt, decreased herbs to 1/2 tsp. each and added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  They baked up pretty crispy maybe because I sprayed them with olive oil spray before baking.  Also, I omitted the butter and just marinated them in buttermilk before breading.  This made them very tender and juicy!  So, with a bunch of changes these were great!  I'm sure they would be super with the butter but my fiance is on a diet so that wasn't in the cards last night.  Yummy!  Will make again!  Maybe I'll turn the oven up to 425 next time to brown them more for appearence

Only Four Stars on this one.  These were great, 1.5 inch peices make the perfect size nugget.  I will however challenge the butter issue.  I am not one of those health nuts who care about fat content but I will say the butter made them relatively greasy and the crumbs/parmesan did not want to stay put.  In the future I will take the other reviewer's suggestion of using egg, I think that would bind the crumbs a little better.  Cooking them on a cooling rack was yet another great suggestion, it worked great.  I paired this meal up with baked sweet potato french fries. MMMMM MMMM, I will definitely make this again, and I will play around with different spices too!

I followed the recipe but used unseasoned breadcrumbs.  It was a pinch too salty.  What I didn't like was that it seemed a bit grainy.  Kiddos weren't crazy about them either.

Loved these. I used whole wheat Panko bread crumbs, added some garlic powder, basil, salt, a few other seasonings. Soaked in butter milk (vinegar/milk) for 5 mins before shaking in bread crumb mixture. Baked for 25 mins at 400. SO good!

Great little recipe.  These are really good served cold.  We bring them when we're going to spend the day on the boat.  Just keep them in the cooler and people can grab a few when they're hungry.
Also these are a really good for potlucks.  Put them on a platter with a bowl of dip and you're good to go.  Even better if you have some in the freezer already!  To freeze them just take the rack you baked them on and put the whole thing In the freezer (once it's cooled of course).  When they're good and frozen put them in a baggie.  That way they'll freeze individually and you don't have a big frozen lump of nuggets.

What a great dinner! I used cornmeal instead of bread crumbs to make it GF. I also let my chicken marinade in buttermilk for an hour before cooking, this made it tender. Baked on a cooling rack to make them extra crispy. Great, will make them again!

I made a few changes. I used 1 package of whole wheat saltines, crushed with the other seasonings and parmesan cheese. I also marinated the chicken in a roasted garlic store bought marinate. I didn't need any butter or egg because the bread crumbs stuck. I put the cracker crumb mix and chicken in a ziplock and shook till they were covered. I also followed a previous review about putting the nuggets on a cooling rack on top of the baking sheet. It worked great! They were awesome! I would recommend if you reheat these don't do it in the microwave...try the broiler or toasted oven.

Thought the receipe was easy to make...the only thing I would do differently would be to cut down the amount of "bread crumbs". There was no need for an entire cup. Otherwise, I will definately make again!

These were by far the best baked nuggets I have ever made. I took other reviewers advice and added crushed garlic to the melted butter. I also put the nuggets on a cookie drying rack in the oven (on top of a cookie sheet) so all sides were crispy. I find panko crumbs make the best coating.  We will definitely be making these again!

We make these all the time (even without any kids!).  I dip the chicken pieces in milk instead of butter and it works just fine.  Also try spraying some Pam on the nuggets before baking them to crisp them up a little.  Also, I don't put the salt in - it's fine without salt.

I only had 2 tbsp of parm left so I just cheddar for the rest.  I would probably do less basil and more of thyme and italian seasoning.  Also used egg instead of butter and cooked them for an extra 5 mins.  I wonder if this recipe would freeze well or not.  Has anyone tried it before?

These were a hit. My son requested chicken nuggets for his birthday dinner, so I made these. Everyone (including the grandparents) loved them. Highly recommend this version over the processed store bought kind!

A nice start, but lacks in the flavor dept. Swapping buttermilk for the butter worked well for a lower fat (and cheaper, and less messy/greasy) option. Perhaps with the right dunkers (marinara, etc), this would be better. Also opted to bake on a cooling rack so the bottoms could get crispy instead of soggy.

Very good! I used black pepper and old bay instead of thyme and basil to give them an extra kick, and they turned out great! Will definitely make these again.

My oldest son loved these!  My younger (picky eater) son wouldn't even try one :-(  Hubby loved them.  I used panko crumbs instead of italian bread crumbs.  I added 1 tsp each of old bay, garlic powder, onion powder and salt.  I cut up the chicken and let it marinate in buttermilk for about 30 minutes.   I skipped the butter, the buttermilk was all it needed. **Tip***Preheat your pan in your oven.  This will quickly brown and crisps the nuggets.  Turn them about 1/2 way through to brown both sides.****

Everyone in the house loved these, from my littlest one to my picky husband!  The only thing I did differently was to soak the pieces of chicken in a salt-water ice bath, then drain & dry before continuing with the recipe...just to give the meat itself a little more flavor and to help keep it moist.  I have been told this needs to be a regular menu item at our house!

Wow. These were amazing. My kids, who NEVER like my homemade nuggets, chowed down. Only change I made to the recipe was to use plain bread crumbs with Italian seasoning and skipped the extra seasonings.

Very good.  Served with Chef John's honey mustard sauce from this site.  I think next time I will substitute poultry seasoning for the thyme.  Found that flavor to be a bit off.  Also, I soaked in buttermilk (milk/white vinegar) for several hours and omitted butter.  Used strips instead of nuggets

These had a good taste but were on the soggy side.  I did broil the pieces on each side, but I didn't do it too long because I didn't want them to dry out.  Next time I'll try using a rack placed on a cookie sheet as others have suggested.

Perfect nuggets for my one year old! I saved a baggie full to keep in the freezer for quick lunches. I thought they tasted great as well! I made a sauce of mayo, dijon mustard, and honey. mmm.

Yum!!  The entire family loved this one!  I served it with Ranch dressing for dipping.  The only part I didn't like was how long it took me to get the nuggets breaded, but I'll solve that next time by making several batches at once and freezing for a quick meal later.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were really good and best of all- EASY. Plus, I had everything on-hand which is always a plus. Unfortunately, the kids wouldn't touch them. I think this could be 5 stars if you reduced the seasonings just a bit. It was right at the line for my husband and me and I think that's what pushed the kids over on these. I like the "bones" of this recipe though, and will make it again down the road, just with a tad less of the spices. I always bake any chicken I want to crisp on a cooling rack and I lightly sprayed with a mist of oil. They had a great crunch.

Fantastic-I used panko bread crumbs and turned them halfway through the cooking time as they got too brown on the bottom if I didn't. These were a hit with the whole family.

This was delicious and fast.  I made the recipe exactly as is except for the bread crumbs, I substituted panko crumbs because thats all we have in the house (panko crumbs make a delicious breading).  My son thought this was the best chicken he ever had and said "Wow these chicken tenders don't even need ketchup." :)  (and that says a lot from him.) I also always bake "breaded" meats on wire rack as this helps to avoid soggy bottoms.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It is a keeper!  Oh and by the time you are done you probably will have used only about a tablespoon of butter on all of the chicken so don't substitute it, just use it.  It really makes the tenders, well, tender!  :)

Tried the recipe 'as is,' and they were flavorful and tender but not crispy or brown. Plus, they were swimming in oil. I had a ton of crumb mixture leftover even though I double coated them, thinking I did something wrong.

Next time I'll put them on a rack to see if the crispness improves.

My kids finally ate something! I reduced the salt, basil and thyme to 1/2 tsp each becuz my kids like more bland food and offered ketchup, ranch like one mom suggested and applesauce for dipping. Even with the seasoning reductions it was flavorful enough for the adults. Thank you for this recipe.

Finally!  A recipe that both of my stepkids -- who have completely opposite tastes when it comes to non-dessert foot -- BOTH like, and that is not unhealthy!  I made this recipe exactly as written except that I used skim milk for dipping the chicken, rather than butter, to make it a little healthier.  Turned out great!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

My mom has made this recipe for years and now that I'm out on my own I decided to give it a go myself. They came out just as good as my mom's and my boyfriend absolutely loved them! I took the advice in the reviews and used an egg instead of butter as well as cooked half of them on a cookie rack (couldn't fit too racks on my cookie sheet)The ones from the rack seemed slightly crispier but there wasn't really any big difference. Will definitly be making this one again!!

We love these in our house!  I've made them with both butter and a skim milk buttermilk substitute which both turned out great.  Now, instead of buying processed chicken nuggets from the store, I make a ton of these every 4-6 weeks and then freeze them.  Pop them in the oven for a quick heat up and they're ready to go!

This is so easy and yummy. It literally took me 20 minutes of prep time and 20 minutes of cook time. I likely will try to make it healthier and reduce the butter content next time but this recipe is plain and simply a winner!

These were delicious!  I baked them on a baking stone, which makes it near impossible to dry out chicken.  They were moist and tasty!

I've been looking for a way to make chicken that my 3 yr old son would eat.  We have a winner!  I read many other reviews and decided to substitute the butter for 1c milk and 1tbsp vinegar and soak chicken for 1 hr.  I also put the chicken on a cookie rack.  Next time I will probably cut the basil and add some garlic salt.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

As far as baking chicken nuggets goes, these are top notch!  I used shredded Parmesan b/c it's all I had on hand, but the fresh grated (the green can scares me!) is the best stuff to use.  There is no doubt these are not the same as fried, but this is the next best thing when keeping healthy eating in mind-let's face it, you can't truly duplicate that which is fried.  I seasoned the chicken before breading, and I used egg/milk to get the crumbs/cheese to stick. Also melted a little butter prior to adding the chicken to the pan and flipped halfway through cooking.  Thanks!

This is great! I am always looking for toddler friendly recipes, and this one is a regular in our house.  We like to accompany the chicken with some BBQ sauce and honey mustard for dipping.  You can serve with cooked veggies, or fresh veggies with ranch dip to make the perfect (easy) "Finger Food" meal! Thanks for posting!

These were great and so easy to make. So much better than store-bought, processed nuggets! I think I might add a little garlic next time for extra flavor.

I could not get the breading to crisp. I did 15 min at 400 and then broiled for 5 minutes, and used a baking rack over a cookie pan...a few of the pieces got a bit crispy but the breading was soft on most of the nuggets. That said, my hubby and stepkids still loved these, so I'd make them again. Even w/o crispy breading, the flavor is great. I cut the butter down to 4 TBSP and added a clove of minced garlic. I used Italian Herb breadcrumbs instead of seasoning them myself. Fast and easy! We used BBQ, ranch, and homemade honey mustard dipping sauces (although hubby says these are flavorful enough to not require any dip!). These are easy and since they require ingredients I always have on hand, I'm sure we'll have them again.

My kids must be too used to the Purdue processed kind-- they took one bite and said 'yuck.' They were really tough, even after marinating in buttermilk. Any other suggestions? Hmph.

well i so rarely hear my 5 year old rave about my food, that this definately deserves 5 stars just for that! I wanted to cook them on a rack, but i didn't have enough room ( used 5 breasts) so i placed them on greased foil ( after spraying nuggets lightly with oil) and flipped halfway. i also broiled for a couple minutes just to darken the colour a bit but it probably wasn't necessary. i did not use butter to get the crumbs to stick, as i was concerned about them falling off, so i did the traditional method of flour, beaten egg, and crumbs. worked like a charm! these were crunchy, juicy, and flavourful. i did find the crumb mixture a little salty when i tasted it, so i added about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup of bran! not only did it add health benefits, but it tasted absolutely wonderful! i will be adding bran to my breadings from now on! i also added a little garlic powder.

Yummy. My husband declares these the best chicken nuggets he's ever had. I didn't have Italian seasoned breadcrumbs on hand, so I used plain and added 1 T of an Italian seasoning mix to the bread crumbs before adding the other seasonings. I also substituted 2 beaten eggs for the butter for extra sticking power. The results were fantastic. Tastes even better cold from the refrigerator the next day. Another "next day" suggestion that's slightly higher in fat content: my husband and I also found that these also taste great if you fry them in oil, turning once so that both sides get nice and crispy and somewhat browned.

My kids love these and I like them too. You can reheat them the next day on a wire rack in the oven. 

I simplified the recipe, using only Italian bread crumbs, shelf-stable parmessan, and salt. No need for the extra spices. I put the chicken in an scrambled egg wash before dredging in the dry ingredients. Then I spray the nuggets with cooking spray before baking. Less fat, but crisps up nicely.

Yum.  Make sure the chicken is well thawed or the butter freezes to the chicken and the crumbs dont stick!  I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and added oregano and basil instead of thyme. Served to company with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots.  Everyone wanted seconds!

My son loves nuggets but I'm worried he's been eating too much of those store bought ones for his own good.. I'm glad I found this recipe and he and hubby loved it!  I even used it to coat some sweet potatoes on the sides and the sweet salty cheesy combination was a hit.  And healthy too! I followed other reviews  and used buttermilk and baked on a rack.  I won't eat other nuggets again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I've made these for years.  My kids love them as do we.  I buy tenderloins so I don't have to spend the time cutting chicken.  I also dip in egg instead of butter.  I use 1/2 tsp salt and thyme and bake on cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet flipping chicken 1/2 way.

I tried this..
Turned out perfect..But I'd suggest if you use beaten egg for dipping the chicken into, instead of butter since it wasnt much sticky

Terrific recipe! I cut up the chicken, put it in a ziploc baggie and covered it with Franks Red Hot sauce for an hour. Then I used panko bread crumbs. Family really enjoyed it. I also used the cooling rack- great idea!

I used a few eggs instead of butter, and no salt, thyme or basil. There was enough seasoning in the Italian Breadcrumbs. Delicous.

The best baked chicken nuggets recipe ever.
I have tried so many before this one and results were...well never up to the mark. This one is a keeper.
I did listen to other reviewers and made them on rack over cookie sheet. I have also made one more change, instead of butter, for half pound chicken...I mixed one egg and one tbsp olive oil....in the end sprayed everything with Pam before putting it in oven. There is only one change I would do next time to make it extra crispy, flip and broil for last 5 min....if you don't like crispy I would still flip them for even ness.

just made it last night, I was going to get a bag of Tyson strips, but didn't want to pay $9 for 26 oz. and Chicken Breast was $1.77/lb.  As others have said, there is a lot of salt with the butter and parmasean cheese, so I would cut the salt in half.  I might also try to use an egg instead of butter next time to take out some of the fat.  I turned the nuggets over about halfway through and they became crispy on both sides.  Make the nuggets yourself and save a fortune, for about $5 and my prep time, I was able to make almost twice as many nuggets as in the Tyson bag.

Yum! These were REALLY good! If you like Wendy's chicken nuggets, you'll LOVE these (they are a spot on copycat, IMHO). And, if you follow Teresa's directions TO THE LETTER, you'll be in for a real treat. I didn't and wish I would have.... I did what reviewer awesome in tummy did and drizzled my leftover butter mixture (I added 2 cloves minced garlic to mine) OVER my nuggets before popping them in the oven to bake. BIG MISTAKE! Although great in theory, this prevented my nuggets from browning / crisping up. To compensate, my hubs dropped each nugget in our fry daddy VERY briefly, but as a result, our nuggets were slightly OVER browned and not as tender as I would have liked. :( NOTE: Many reviewers suggest baking these on cookie cooling racks. I purchased mine from Pampered Chef years ago, but fortunately, I kept my product use and care instructions. If you own PC cooling racks, DO NOT place them in the oven!!! They are NOT oven safe! I ended up using an Airbake cookie sheet (i.e. the ones with holes in them that allow air to circulate, resulting in crisp crusts, etc.) set over a standard one to catch any crumbs that fell thru. This worked "OK," but I really think a plain 'ol cookie sheet would have been fine. If you use a standard sheet, just be sure to check halfway thru baking and "flip" your nuggets if they are not browning on the underside. Mac & cheese and tater tots complemented our simple meal. Thanks for sharing, Teresa! I'll be making these again for sure. :-)

I double this recipe to freeze and use them instead of the nasty store-bought kind. I pre-marinade in milk and italian dressing and skip the butter. It's also easy to play with the coating. Granulated garlic and minced onions added in are really yummy.

Very good! I cooked them on a metal rack and they turned out perfect. I was really surprised that my 2 yr old didn't like them. I'll have to try and make them again in a few weeks and see if he changes his mind :)

Everyone loved these!  I did not use butter or egg.  I just put the bread crumbs and spices in a gal. zip lock bag and shake. Sprayed the pan will PAM and after I added the coated chicken I sprayed the top of them with Pam.  I will make again and very easy to make.

These were good but I was disappointed in the color.  Mine didn't brown nice as shown in the picture.  I used Panko rather than Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs as that's what I had.  Would that have made the difference?  I did use the suggestion to marinate the chicken in 1/2T vinegar and 1/2C milk for an hour before baking.  They were very tender just not as pretty & crispy looking.  UPDATE: I just reread the recipe & maybe I should have still dipped them in the melted butter after removing them from the marinade.  I skipped that step because they were already wet.  That might have made them brown better.  Will try that next time.

Very tasty.  I've made it this way but there are a few variations I do that I think make it a little better.  If you like it a little spicy then marinate it in hot pepper sauce and eggs for a few hours to overnight.  I also took the suggestions of another reviewer and added some pressed garlic to the butter but I also let that marinate to get more of the garlic and butter flavor into the chicken.  In both cases I bake it on the wire rack for more crispiness all around the nuggets.  I think I might also try adding pressed garlic and honey to the  egg and hot sauce, perhaps a few other spices, yet to be determined. This is a great recipe to play with.  I've been having a lot of fun with it.  I'm used to be known for all the varieties of chicken wings I created and now they're adding chicken nuggets to my reputation and it started with this recipe.  People are telling me to open a bar and serve my wings and variations of these nuggets so they can get them all the time when they want.  If I wasn't so far past the bar scene at 53 years old and not wanting to deal with drunk kids anymore I'd consider it.

A hit in our house! Quick, easy and the kids loved them! You really can't ask for more on a school night. I used 1/2 cup of buttermilk to dip the chicken in and really pressed the breadcrumbs onto the nuggets and baked on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet.  They came out very juicy inside and crispy outside. Will defiantly be making again!

Love, love, love this recipe!  I use seasoned breadcrumbs instead of all the fresh herbs.  My toddler would not eat it otherwise.  Also, chicken tenders are easier than boneless breasts.  I dip the chicken into milk, roll it in the breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mix and then place it on a wire rack over my cookie pan.  Works great and tastes delicious!  I cook for 25 to 27 minutes.

These turned out really well, very yummy. Did not have the dried basil and didn't measure out, seasoned with different stuff I had. Garlic salt and powder, dried parsley, onion powder. I also seasoned my butter with fresh garlic. So easy too. My breading was a little soggy underneath the chicken but they were so good I barely noticed. Thank you for sharing, this is a keeper!

My nuggets turn out better than the frozen store-bought ones! Plenty of spices, a hint of parmesan cheese, and whole wheat panko bread crumbs make all the difference.

These were good - I used panko bread crumbs instead of Italian seasoned ones, and put a wire rack over a foil covered cookie sheet to bake them. I accidentally forgot the parm, but even without it they were good. I'm not a huge thyme lover, so I will probably cut back to a 1/2 teas (if any at all) next time. Also, I reduced the salt to 1/2 teas.

Easy and good.  Put foil down and lightly greased it to make for easy clean up.  Did not quite use all of the butter called for and used about 3 1/2 chicken breasts to fill and 11x17 pan.

Really, Really, Good!  I wanted to make this a little healthier so instead of dipping the chicken in butter, I used egg whites instead.  After reading other reviews I was worried about these nuggets being kind of soggy but they weren't at all.  I just baked them on a foil lined cookie sheet and flipped them after ten minutes.  I don't know if using egg whites as opposed to butter helps with the sogginess, but it was a non-issue for us.  Also, there were bites where I could really taste the thyme.  I think it could be cut back some or omitted all together, same with the basil, just using italian bread crumbs would be season them enough.  Also, if you have really picky kids, leaving out the basil and thyme would mean no big green flakes to have to explain.  Great Recipe!

I followed the recipe for the most part and it was pretty good but next time I think I will drizzle butter over them but other than that it is pretty tasty!

I couldn't have made my kids any happier.

I only had plain crumbs so I added two tsp of italian seasonings, skipped the extra herbs since I was out of basil and they still tasted great.

This recipe is by far the best...I used a buttermilk and hot sauce marinade instead of butter (2 1/2 cups buttermilk and 1/3 cup of hot sauce) and 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of the whole teaspoon that the recipe called for. I also used the wire rack that the other reviewers suggested...Delish!!!! Thanks so much for the recipe.

I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I improvised and threw in some Italian seasoning to spice it up.  I also substituted the melted butter for 2 beaten eggs. 

I lined a baking sheet with foil, and placed a wire rack on top (as others have suggested). I lightly sprayed the rack with non-stick cooking spray. 

I cut the chicken into thin strips rather than nugget size.  I thought the thyme was a little overwhelming, and will likely only put half of what the recipe calls for  next time.

I cooked the chicken on 400 degrees for 10 minutes then turned the broiler on Hi for another minute (total of 11 minutes per side). I flipped the chicken over and did the same. It turned out very crunchy, to which I was pleasantly surprised!

I used some thinly sliced chicken breasts I happened to have.  I cut them in two lengthwise and this made nice tender portions.  Dipped in buttermilk instead of butter.  Used panko crumbs instead of Italian bread crumbs.   Baked on a rack and finished under the broiler as several have suggested.  Very juicy with a very tasty crust.  My son who is very picky about his chicken tenders and normally only likes them fried, actually enjoyed these.  Even with the rack the bottom did not brown as nicely.  I might turn them next time.

thanks for a quick and kid-friendly recipe! only change i made was to dip the chicken in egg whites instead of butter.  something about chicken in chunks rather than baked chicken breasts that is more appealing to my kids :)

Great recipe! Instead of using the 1/2 cup of butter, I used milk. Worked out just fine. I also added garlic powder and onion powder. Tasted really good re-heated the next day for lunch too! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were the best nuggets EVER!! I used most of the tips on the review section like putting the crumbs in a ziploc bag to evenly coat the chicken and also added crushed garlic to the butter. I didnt have a cookie cooling rack co I made my own by twisting aluminum foil and making it into a rack.

These do taste a lot like the frozen kind, but they were a nice change from fried chicken.  I halved the amount of Parmesan, thyme, and basil after reading other reviews.  I was glad I did because they were still herby, but not overwhelming.  I had no problem with them crisping up at this temp or straight on the sheet.  Also placed aluminum foil on my baking sheet for easier clean up.

This recipe was really good!  My BF asked me to make these again SOON!  The only change I made was instead of melted butter I used one egg and a 1/4 cup milk to dip the chicken in per Skoo on the exchange.  Thanks for a great recipe!  :)

I've been playing with various versions of baked nuggets, and these are by far the best. I followed other readers' advice and passed on the butter and instead marinated the chicken pieces in buttermilk (or milk and vinegar) for 30 minutes. I also substituted panko for bread crumbs for extra crunch. The parmesan cheese adds so much flavor! I also recommend cooking the nuggets on a cooling rack so they crisp up nicely. Easy, healthy and delicious. My kids (5 and 3) love them. And they freeze and reheat very well.

These are really really good.  I'm sure these would be just as delicious if I followed the recipe exactly, but I made some changes to fit what I had on hand and to make them just a little bit healthier.  I followed several other reviewers' suggestions.  In place of the butter, I used a half cup of 2% milk mixed with a half tablespoon of lemon juice stirred in and left to sit for about 10 minutes.  For the crumb mixture, I used half regular breadcrumbs and half Panko to make them extra crispy.  I also replaced the Parmesan with sharp white cheddar just because I was running low on Parmesan, but I really liked the taste anyway.  I double breaded the last 10 or so nuggets because I had a bit of breading left over.  I tried two methods of cooking: Baking the nuggets on a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet lined with foil, and baking them directly on a foil-lined cookie sheet and then broiling the nuggets on low for the last two minutes of cook time.  Both ways produced crispy nuggets, but I think the ones baked on the wire rack were just a bit more crisp.  This recipe can be part of a healthy, well balanced meal, and best of all it is super delicious.  I will make these again!

These are great!  I used half butter/half milk in place of butter, and added a little garlic.  Next time, I will just add a bit of pepper to the mix.

I was looking for a healthy alternative to breaded chicken and I found it. I didnt really follow the recipe, but i did follow the reviwers!  I followed one reviewers suggestion to use buttermilk instead of the butter to reduce the fat and another reviewers suggestion to use the cookie rack over the baking pan to crisp up both sides of the chicken and they both totally worked!! Turned out wonderful!  I cut bigger pieces for chicken parm and used italian breadcrumbs for conveinence.  Cooked it close to 30 minutes @ 400 and broiled them with a little mozz on top for 3 mins.  Dont forget to spray with Pam and flip 3/4 through...served with whole wheat penne and leftover tomato sauce. Thank you reviewers!

Fantastic! My 4 year old, who doesn't eat much of anything, just closed his eyes in ecstasy! He ate all of it and asked for more! I did substitute the butter for Smart Balance Spread melted, and it worked just fine. It was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Easy recipe, this is a keeper!

Husband and kid loved these. Their plates were practically licked clean. Served with honey mustard dip. I found that I had a little crumb mixture left over, so I cut up a few pieces of skinless thigh as well.

The taste was just ok for us.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I followed other reviewer's and baked them on a wire rack.  These nuggets took way longer than the specified time to cook.  They were anything but crispy, and didn't turn brown.  I had to broil them to get a good color on them.  A total disappointment.  I will keep looking for a suitable nugget recipe.

Oh my gosh, so delicious!!! I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used regular, and added about 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning to it. Other than that, followed the recipe perfectly. Turned out great!!! They're very good as is, or with a dipping sauce. Will definitely be making this again!!

This was excellent!  I made them into bite size popcorn chicken.  The flavor was so good that I didn’t feel the need to dip them in any kind of sauce!  Also, I be it would be really yummy on top of a salad!

quick and easy, my toddler loved them. I cut the chicken into chunks like Chick-Fi-La does. A nice alternative to those prefrozen things in the grocery store that are loaded with preservatives!

I love this recipe just as much as my family! Even though I too made minor modifications from the original recipe, it still came out delicious! Instead of the tbsp of basil, I used dried minced garlic (I'm a garlic lover).  I used 2 eggs in place of the butter. The cooling rack idea from another reviewer worked great. I have a cooling rack that fit perfectly inside one of my cookie sheets. The only reason why I used the cookie sheet was to avoid any crumbs falling to the bottom of the oven, on the floor or even the countertop. This idea most definitely helped to make the chicken crispy & not soggy. Cooking the chicken in the broiler for the last 5  minutes was an added bonus to really crispy chicken.

I love this recipe so much.  It's a great base recipe.  I choose to sub out the butter for one whole egg beaten because it sticks the coating better to the chicken.  I sub out half the bread crumbs for potato flakes.  When I bake it, I take the top part of the broiler pan, wrap in foil, and put the chicken on there.  The pieces gets crisper that way.  Generally, I make the coating and put it in a box and only use what's necessary when needed.  Also, I tend to add garlic powder, paprika, pepper, and whatever misc herbs I feel like using.  =)  This recipe has been in my rototaion for over 2 years.  I've used this for portabella mushrooms too, which worked out great.

These were yummy. Very flavorful.  A bit greasy, but the taste makes up for it :) I also cut down on the amout of herbs and salt.  Next time I will try either an egg or milk instead of the butter.

Just made these this weekend and I thought they were absolutely fantastic.  My husband liked them too, but thought they were a little TOO flavorful.  Kids would probably find these too much as well.  As I like strong flavors, I thought they were great as is, but next time I'll tone it down just a bit.

Way too much extra breadcrumbs. Definitely use less than indicated, or you will throw a lot away. Very tasty though, especially with honey mustard or BBQ dipping sauce.

I used the precut chicken tender strips and halved all the coating ingredients. My husband & I thought it was good and my extemely picky 7 year raved about it saying "You finely made something that tastes good." Believe me coming from this kid that is high praise.

This awesome. A million recipes say dip in milk and egg, or buttermilk, or what have you. Go there and follow them if you like - these buttery nuggets of goodness rock the party BECAUSE of that delicious ingredient. Don't make them if you don't like it, they might be good that way, but again- tons of THOSE recipes out there.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because I had to modify the original recipe. It's 5 stars with modifications... When I first made the recipe exactly as written, I found it to be a little on the greasy side with all the butter.  After reading the reviews, I took some other's advice and dipped the chicken nuggets in faux buttermilk (actually skim milk with some vinegar) and then used the trick of baking them on the cookie cooling rack. They turned out perfectly.  My husband even liked the flavor of the nuggets "as is", without dipping them in bbq sauce, which is a first for him!

I'm rating this a three and made it almost exactly as written but used milk with capful of vinegar for wet ingredients  instead of butter which worked quite well, and used plain panko breadcrumbs instead of regular Italian flavored.  I salted/peppered my chicken as I always do and found it too salty with the added 1 tsp of salt so I would omit the added salt (plus the parm cheese adds quite a bit of salt too.) Would omit the thyme and basil altogether...family didn't quite like the flavor but still ate it up with dipping sauces.  Good recipe for cooking method (went by # 1 reviewer.) I would make this again with these variations.

These nuggets taste so good and are so much more healthy than fast food chicken nuggets.  I make ahead of time and freeze so they can easily be heated up for a fast lunch for kids.

Great stuff as a starting point, but I am trying to reduce my wheat consumption so I did something a little different.  Here were my changes:  I used 1/2 cup fine ground oats (often called Scottish oats) in place of 1 cup breadcrumbs, 1/3 cup parmesan only, one egg mixed with a fork(in place of the butter)and I eliminated the extra salt (parmesan cheese is salty enough for me).  The basil/thyme quantities were not changed. I used a 400 deg oven for 20 minutes and then put it on broil for 4 min to brown it a little more (it appeared a little too moist on the bottom before I did this).  Excellent gluten-free option!  This was enough for three chicken breasts.  I served it up with quinoa cooked in chicken broth and a huge Greek salad, inspired by the herbs in this recipe.  It was enjoyed all around.  Thanks for the idea!

Not all that much flavor, but when dipped in sauces like BBQ or honey mustard then it really doesn't matter.  I love serving real chicken nuggets to my family, and they love them.

This was AWESOME!!! ...I have to admit that i was not sure WHY the directions say "lightly butter" the pan. So, be aware to use little butter because the bread crumbs will absorb the butter and make the nuggets soggy. ..The taste was unbelievably GREAT. I WILL make this again.

Not my favorite.  Pretty bad, actually.  Don't think I'll use the butter next time--the coating slid off during baking and didn't crisp up properly.  Tasted soggy on the outside and breadcrumbs came off on our hands.  Will modify later and post another review after modifying.

Followed the directions. Chicken is very tasty. I used a wire rack like someone suggested. Next time, I'll roll the chicken in flour, then egg wash before the crumbs so, it sticks better.

Last time I made them I used parsley and oregano instead of thyme and basil.

Made these tonight and they were really good and tasty. Even the picky eater kids liked them and the only nuggets they've ever had came from a fast food place. The only change I made was the bread crumbs. I used Progresso's unseasoned just because, with the thyme and basil, I didn't think the kids would like the extra seasoning and they came out perfectly seasoned. These would make an awesome appetizer when watching NASCAR. Will definitely make again. It's on my favorites list.

I used 1/2 c of "buttermilk" (milk & lemon juice) and baked it at 400 for 15 min and then broiled for 5 min like someone suggested. Really like this a lot! Also did strips of zucchini the same way.

I love this recipe and the fact that I can get kids to eat the chicken.
I made this for my friends and their 2 year old daughter. They told me she wouldn't eat chicken. But she couldn't get enough of the meat cookies, she sat on the kitchen floor before dinner was even ready and ate almost half a pan of the "cookies". It helped that they came out of the oven on a cookie sheet like real cookies. Her parents make this for her regularly now.

Used these to make "nugget in a biscuit" for the kids.  (Chicken nugget wrapped in buttermilk biscuit, then dipped in mashed potatoes and BBQ sauce.  It's a youtube thing.)  They said the nuggets tasted better than the ones from the store, plus they were way cheaper.  Win all around.

kiddo loved it but I found it to be too fatty, I think all that butter wasn't for me, why not just fry the nuggets? Baking doesn't cut out on much Thanks however for the recipe.

My husband and son thought these were very good. I thought that they were so-so. The thought of all that butter and fat made me a bit queasy and defeated my intention of making a more healthy version of frozen nuggets. Instead, I used a whole egg mixed with a bit of buttermilk for dipping the chicken. Otherwise I followed the recipe (but cutting down on the salt). 

I baked them on a greased baking sheet and sprayed the tops with some cooking spray instead of the butter. After baking 20 minutes on the top rack directly under the heating element, the coating was still pale and almost doughy, but the chicken was cooked through. I'm hesitant to blame the recipe, though, since it's a new range and my first experience with using a gas oven (my old one had an electric oven). We wanted crispy nuggets, so I ended up taking them out and browning them up in my electric skillet.

All in all, a decent basic coating recipe with plenty of room for experimentation with spices.

I've been looking for a chicken nugget recipe that my kids will love so I can stop buying those nasty processed ones. This recipe was a hit from the get-go! I make these about once a week for my family, and the kids love them. I bake them on a cookie cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet-they get nice and crispy on all sides that way. I also just use Mrs. Dash Italian Seasoning and some smoked paprika (my favorite spice), with the parmesan, bread crumbs and salt. I've made these for my friends kids when they come over, and they are always amazed that I "made" chicken nuggets that the kids will eat. Thanks for the great recipe.

These are really good! The whole pan disappeared last night with my 11 year old eating a huge amount. I made this one once before so tried a faster way this time by melting the butter (only a few TBLs) in a glass bowl, throwing in the chicken pieces and stirring. It worked great. Then I scooped them up in batches from the butter bowl and put them in the coating bowl, stirred and picked them out as they were covered. It seemed a lot faster than dipping each one individually! They were good with ranch dip and BBQ sauce! I remember wasting quite a bit of coating last time I made these so used about 1/2 of each dry ingredient and it was about the perfect amount for 3 chicken breasts all cut up. I must have cut the pieces small enough because they were done right at 20 min.

We LOVE this recipe and use it on pork roast cut into large nuggets all the time!  I never have any nuggets left over (using about 2# roast).  I do, however, usually have some breading left so keep a portion separate so it doesn't get contaminated and then keep it in a baggie in the fridge for next time.  There WILL be a next time.

this is my go too recipe for chicken nuggets. Seriously, the 'breading' on them is scrumptious. I have made them for two families who i took care meals too and they loved them and asked for the recipe. The only change I make is that i buy some flavoured croutons and blend them up and add them to the breadcrumb mixture. But the herbs and parmesan are what makes them superb. I usually use some ranch or caesar salad dressing for the dip although they'd be good with a sweet honey mustard too.

WICKED good! These are delicous treat for an adult appetizer at a party. Huge hit with myself. My kids are going to love these!! They are super easy to make. Do not bake them on a pampered chef stoneware pan! Bake them on a regular cookie dish or they will not the same crispiness. Flip after half the cooking time to bake evenly.

Made these last night! They were a hit! :) I took the advice of some of the other reviewers but I also added a little creole seasoning to give them a little kick. Will definitely be making these again!

These have become a favorite in our house. As other reviewers suggested, I soak them in buttermilk first and then cover with breadcrumbs.  I then put them on a wrack over a baking sheet (I use cookie cooling wracks) and drizzle with olive oil.  The crispness seems to vary each time but they're still very good. They definitely beat store bought any day.

Great recipe and idea! I did what a lot of the other reviewers suggested and used buttermilk or milk/vinegar to dip the chicken in first, rather than butter. My family loves these! Sometimes I use panko or a mix of panko and breadcrumbs, depending on what I have in the pantry. I also used the same idea last time I made fish. We liked it better than frying it!

Great Recipe!  Very tasty, I like them along with my 2 year old.  Instead of coating with butter I use egg and it works just as well.  Freezes well and still juicy after a minute or so in the microwave.

Wow! My kids love them. My youngest daughter pouted when she saw the nuggets for lunch. She said that she doesn't eat nugget. I told her to just taste it first since I was the one who made them. When she tasted it she smiled and she said "Mom this is the best nuggets in the whole world." And the funny thing is, she asked for the chicken nuggets again for dinner. Thanks Teresa for this wonderful kid's meal ... Cheers!

Fantastic! I made these gluten-free by using crushed, roasted rice chex instead of bread crumbs and it worked wonderfully. I used a few other substitutions and modifications: I cooked it on a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet, I dipped the chicken in a mixture of beaten egg and skim milk, and I added garlic to the bread crumb mixture. These were wonderful--my dad ate one and immediately informed me that I was cooking these for dinner next week.

My husband and I LOVE these!  I've made them twice in two weeks.  We used 2 eggs and about 3-4 TB milk to dip them in instead of butter and it worked great with less fat.  We also tried them with regular Panko bread crumbs and Chipolte Panko bread crumbs, which gave them a little kick.  They are great left over too.  We put them in foil, open to keep the crispiness.  DEFINITELY recommended to all my friends.  Also great for crowds and VERY EASY!

Outstanding!  My kids loved it, kids being 17 and 21 :-)  .  I simply substituted lowfat milk for the butter, and cooked it on a rack on the cookie sheet.  I cannot believe how juicy this chicken was.  Wonderful!

These were awesome!  I had made a chicken recipe before using grated parmesan so I was eager to try this version.  I didn't have the spices so I used two teaspoons of a dried italian spice.   My brother absolutely loved these as did I!  I will make these again for sure

Easy and delicious! I only did 2 things different, used egg instead of butter and I didn't have italian bread crumbs so I used plain and added some italian seasoning to it.  These came out wonderful, my 13 year old raved about them and asked when I could make them again!

Served these as-is to my VERY picky 5- and 2-year olds. I was told that "these are better than McD's" which is one of the best compliments my son could give me with how limited his diet is.

These were very good.  I omitted the salt because typically there is already salt in seasoned bread crumbs and 1 tsp is a lot!  Paired these with Sweet & Sour Jam.

These turned out great! I used a pound of tenders and eggs instead of butter (ups the protein and decreases calories). But, I have to warn you that this makes WAY too much coating. I could have easily done 2 or 3 pounds of tenders.

very very yummy.  I made chicken breast, instead of frying I used this.  Fantastic alternative, we don't eat a lot of fried foods.  I marinated the breasts first in zesty italian dressing over night, I did not have basil so I used parsley.  I also used plain bread crumbs instead of seasoned. Turned out delicious!

This is a fantastic dish! The only problem is that my kids eat it all before I have a chance to get to any of them! I love that they're baked and they are so much better for the kids than the fast food alternatives. They go great with the honey-dijon mustard dip. Yummy!!

I read the reviews, had high hopes, was disappointed. I used panko breadcrumbs, shredded parmesan (instead of grated), only half of the thyme, and half of the basil. Instead of butter, I used buttermilk. I baked on a wire rack, like suggested. They never got really crispy (or brown), even with the panko breadcrumbs, and they were WAY too salty. I will probably try again with half the salt, and normal bread crumbs to see how much my meddling had to do with the poor results. Wish me luck.

These were fantastic! I made them for my kids one day and I ended up having them as well. I was nervous before making them, expecting them to be soggy like so many other recipes I've tried similar to this one. I took other reviewers advice and baked them on cooling racks placed on a cookie pan. They turned out crisp and juicy. Perfect! Thank you for sharing!

My kids NEEDED to have nuggets for one of the many parties they were planning with each other.  Of course, they were referring to a certain restaurant's variety, but I was looking for something healthier.  These were a hit with the whole family!  I used others' ideas - milk instead of butter, using a rack on a cookie sheet to keep them elevated, spraying them with a bit of olive oil after breading them, and flipping them part way through.  I'll definitely be making these again!

Awesome! I used fresh ingredients and marinated these in buttermilk instead of butter due to personal preference. I used italian seasoned bread crumbs along with parmesean cheese but I increased the amount of cheese. I baked the chicken on a cooling rack which was placed on top of a baking sheet. I turned them over half way during the baking. It took me a little longer to bake and crisp them up but was well worth it! It was golden brown, cirp and tender on inside. What a difference when using fresh ingredients. I also dipped them in sweet and sour sauce II and honey mustard dipping sauce from this website. Yum!!

Very tasty, and pretty quick and easy. Instead of melted butter before the bread crumb/cheese dip, I rolled the chicken in mayonaise/honey mustard.

Used corn flakes and saltine crackers for base. Used finely chopped rosemary, parsley and basil, ground paprika, pepper and the cheese made all the difference. Bake on rack. Awesome.

This was a decent breading recipe for chicken nuggets or fingers. It's a basic breading recipe though and nothing special or different from pretty much any other baked chicken breading of this sort. I added Red Robin seasoning to mine which gave it some extra flavor. I served these with honey roasted red potatoes -- the recipe is on this site and is fantastic. This was good but I'll keep looking for something that is more remarkable.

NOT SURE IF I BAKED THESE CORRECTLY, DID NOT HAVE ITALIAN BREAD CRUMBS SO USED PANKO BREAD CRUMBS AND STIRRED IN 1 TBSP OF ITALIAN BREAD CRUMBS...IT WAS OKAY. BUT SAVED THE LEFTOVERS AND MADE CHICKEN PARM SUB AND IT TURNED OUT WONDERFUL

This was delicious! My 4yr old gave it 10 thumbs up and my 7 year old said he rated it a million thumbs up!!  I did follow some of the other tips.. I used an egg wash instead of butter, and cooked them on a cooling rack...  I also turned the broil her on them for a couple of minutes each side to make them super crispy!! I used chicken breast tenderloins as well to save a little time!  This is definitely going into my list of faves!

Also, next time I will make half the amount of the seasoning, because I ended up throwing away quite a bit.
I made Baked Basil Fries to go with it! They complimented each other perfectly!

Wow, these were a hit with the kids!  I used "jumbo tenders" and since we are a gluten free family, gluten-free corn flakes worked well.  I used half the butter and mixed in an egg.  The crumbs stuck well and the chicken came out tender and juicy!

I never thought I'd give a baked chicken nugget 5-stars but this was amazing!!!  Incredibly flavorful, tender and loved by the entire family.  I made a few tiny modifications:  added garlic powder and pepper.  I also cut the chicken pieces a bit smaller than typical nuggets so that it was almost like popcorn chicken.  Delicious!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers on salad with honey mustard dressing.

Very good recipe. My kids loved them & I didn't feel like I was eating "kid" food. I substituted the thyme & basil for Italian seasoning. Other than that everything else was the same. Very tasty.

Wow!  Amazing is one word that could described this yummy simple meal.  My son, who is 15 months, is quite picky about the meat he eat.  He devoured it!! I have make this twice.  The first was with Planko break crumbs which gave an extra crunch to it and the second time I went by the original recipe.  Both ways, was great!

Yum Yum Yum!!!  The thyme was a little strong, not overpowering but strong.  I think next time I will not put quite as much.  These were great and I felt somewhat healthy making my own chicken nuggets.  Even my two year old daughter ate these without any complaints!  They were easy, quick and delish!

Thought these were very good. Definitely better than any pre-made from the stores. A little dry. I used egg wash instead of butter, so maybe that's why? After the 1st batch was done, I brush-coated my remaining batches with canola oil.  Not alot.  Just tapped each nugget with the brush.  Thought those came out better.

I also did the egg and skim milk coating instead of butter before breading.  I used plain bread crumbs with parm cheese and cajun seasoning instead to give it more of a spice kick.

This is amazing! Slight alterations to make them crispy: 1) use panko breadcrumbs (which come seasoned so I don't use herbs listed) 2) put the nuggets on a baking rack over a baking pan so butter drips and both sides become crispy 3) broil for 2 mins at the very end!

These were pretty good in my opinion but really good in everyone else's opinion so that works for me :).  I liked that they were baked though.  I only had regular bread crumbs so I added italian seasoning in addition to what the recipe calls for.  I baked them on cooling racks too, they didn't get quite crispy but they weren't soggy either.  We'll have these again.

These are so good!  I omitted the Parm cheese due to a dairy allergy and used soy butter instead of regular butter.   I also used Italian Panko breadcrumbs  and they still taste amazing!  My family likes these way better than fast food nuggets now.

These are easy to make and delicious.  My kids loved them and I felt good knowing what was in their nuggets.

I made these for my boyfriend and I, he loves them, I think they're good but not the best.  Nice flavor, but a little crumbly.  Maybe it's something I'm doing wrong? But it seems a little shake and bake-ish.  So all in all, it's good but not delicious, and very easy to prepare so I will be making it again!

I use 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs for half of the italian bread crumbs and soak my chicken (pieces or tenders) for 2-3 days minimum in a mix of nonfat plain yogurt (enough to coat, buttermilk would work too), few healthy dashes of hot sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and salt and pepper. The marinating makes a world of difference, especially since it can be easy to overcook chicken. The marinating keeps the meat moist. Once you're ready to coat the chicken in breading, the marinade is all the moisture you need - no butter, just some non-stick spray. Cooking on a rack above a sheet pan is perfect for getting a crisp coating, just flip half way through. **Update: These are just as tasty without marinating, but I do pour a little milk and lemon juice on the chicken before breading. Adding several shakes of cayenne to the breadcrumbs boosts flavor without making it spicy. So good!

Fantastic! Don't think I need to ever buy those pre-made ones anymore! (next time I am going to try the lightened up instructions someone (?) gave in their rating. Just to taste the difference.)

I cooked them exactly as the recipe instructed, except I used other people's suggestions for cooking methods. I had three batches so I cooked each of the batches differently. The first batch I baked for 15 minutes then threw them in a frying pan for the last few minutes to help brown up the coating. The second batch I cooked on a wire rack in the oven, and the third batch after cooking on the wire rack I threw into the broiler for 5 minutes on each side. No matter what I tried, I could not get the breading to stick. They would be almost perfect if the breading would stick. Other than that, they were very good. My whole family ate them up. Next time I will use regular bread crumbs and just add a dash of Italian seasoning--the Italian seasoning was a little on the strong side.

I just made these the recipe was in the family favorites bookbook. I followed the recipe exactly. Very very good I will make them again. My dipping sauce was hot mustard/sweet and sour sauce. I baked them 2 minutes longer than the recipe stated.

I didn't have enough cheese so maybe that was the problem but the seasonings just seemed too strong imo... Too much Italian flavor; hubby said all they needed was salt and pepper next time.

I followed this exactly, except I used a full cup of parm cheese, and cooked them for only about 12 minutes- DELICIOUS! Great flavor, great crust on the outside, and not dry at all. There were definitely no leftovers!

Tasty as-is but I think I'd like to tweak the spices to my own preference next time. I tried the cooking on a rack over a cookie sheet method and thought it worked well. Cut the chicken in sizes based on desired "crunch factor". Smaller pieces will be more crispy. Thanks :)

Very easy and fast to make... Just pop them in the oven.. I did however take some advice fro the other reviewers and broiled the nuggets after 15 min. for only 5 minutes and turned out nice and crisp.  Love Love Love.. Roomie loved it!!

Fantastic! Using the wire rack really crisped up the nuggets in a little shorter time than recommended.  Used the 1/2 c milk with a teaspoon of vinegar (buttermilk substitute).  Always use freshly grated parmesan.

I altered this recipe by melting Smart Balance light butter instead of regular butter to further reduce calorie count.  It did the job of getting the crust to stick and crisp and we couldn't even tell a difference in the taste.  Kids love them and I don't have any guilt feeding these to my kids.

I have know this recipe for over 25 years as "Chicken a-la Speed of Light". My first encounter with it was in a recipe book published by the elementary school that my sons attended here in Colorado Springs. It was donated by one of the school teachers. It has always been a huge hit with my family members.  I have prepared it as an appetizer and as a main dish meat course. Very easy and very good!

These wre fabukous.  I just mixed them in mayo and then in the crumb mixture and baked.  Everyone loved them.  I baked a 350 for a little longer.  I will make a big batch of these and freeze them and use a nuggets.  I did need more crumb mixture though.  Just too good!!  Thank you!!

These were a definite hit for all four of us.  I soaked the chicken in buttermilk for about an hour and then coated it.  I didn't want the extra calories from the butter.  I put all of the coating ingredients in a gallon size plastic bag and then added the chicken.  After a short bit of shaking, all of the pieces were perfectly coated.  We served ours several different types of dip (ranch, bbq, sweet and sour, pepper jelly, ketchup).

Followed advise of others and used cookie cooling racks on cookie sheet.  Also cut butter down to 1/4 cup.  Did some chicken tenders and zucchini at the same time.  Was great!  Kids loved it:)

Great recipe! Instead of butter I used beaten egg to dip them in and then used gluten-free breadcrumbs (hubby is gluten intolerant) to dip them in and otherwise as directed. Perfect!

I had some turkey burgers to use up so I thawed those, cut them into eighths, dipped in egg substitute and baked on a pan that has holes in it to let them brown on both sides.  I'm sure the butter would have been better because these were a bit on the dry side but mine were practically fat free.  A little honey mustard dipping sauce and these were fine.  I'll make them again - the coating had great flavor.

I loved this recipe. I used panko bread crumbs (way less additives- check out the ingredients in regular bread crumbs) and marinated the chicken in buttermilk and garlic prior to breading. After baking I sprinkled them with more parmesean and dipped them in marinara. Thanks for this great recipe- sure to be a standby for me!

I must have done something wrong...no one at my dinner table liked these (husband, 2 daughters-ages 7 & 10, and a friend-age 7). They were very bland. The only change I made was I used milk instead of butter to coat the chicken. I also used cooling rack to crisp them...it didn't work. It took forever for them to cook...much longer than in the recipe says. I may try one more time since most everyone else raved about them.

i'm a low-carber for life, but this recipe sounded really good.  i used 1c of parmesan and left out the bread crumbs.  since i didn't have the seasoning from the bread crumbs, i added 1T italian seasoning.  i followed the suggestion to bake these on a rack and i'm happy to say they came out much crispier when i did so.  i also used this recipe on catfish nuggets and tilapia fillets, and both came out delish.  also good for chicken wings.

Fantastic ! I made twice - first time I made as directed (hence the 4 stars);  Second time I tweaked by using a mix of panko, italian bread crumbs, and cheese.  Then dredged in flour, egg wash (egg + 2T water), then breadcrumb mixture.  Let sit for 10" on cookie sheet, then spritz with spray and baked 15" at 400 and (as other reader mentioned) 5 more minutes under broil to crisp up.  Served with rice, salad, and corn, and honey mustard dressing.  Family loved.  Three chicken breasts got me about 32 nuggets.

Really yummy and tender chicken.   I used half bread crumbs and half cornflakes (didn't have enough bread crumbs) and I used half milk and half butter instead of all butter.  I cooked on a wire rack.  Next time I will put them under the grill for the last couple of minutes to really crisp them up.  Will be making again for sure.

This was a great recipe! I used skim milk to coat the chicken instead of butter (for a healthier meal). It was very good and I will definitely make this again. Very quick and easy to make especially after a long day at work! A+ recipe!

These were easy, quick, and delicious.  For how simple the ingredients are, its sure has a great taste. My entire family, 5 kids and hubby, all loved this, and we will be making it often.  We dipped them in bbq sauce, catsup, and ranch, and all were great on them.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

oh my word, oh my word, oh my word! i cannot even describe how yummy these are. i leave out the special spices and just use garlic powder, salt and pepper. the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese (sometimes use romano to change it up) give it enough pizzazz!! i make this about once a week! i do broil it at the end for about 5 minutes and it makes them nice and crispy.

I did make some changes 'coz I didn't have the necessary ingredients and couldn't run to the store either. But the end result was AWESOME! the changes i made was...to add some broken dry red chillies (just a pinch)....no thyme (coz I didn't have any) and 3-4 cheese triangles grated (no Parmesan on hand). I loved it...and I it was brilliant. For me it took approx. 13 minutes on either side. And it wasn't too brown or burnt or anything. Just Right! Thanks Teresa!
*** UPDATE***
It's brilliant with Parmesan too!! But cheese triangles are equally brilliant!! And paprika gives it an AWESOME kick!! :)

These were very good, but too salty for our taste. Next time I would either half the salt or omit it entirely. There is enough flavor that you don't even need salt. Also, I double breaded the nuggets, and would NOT recommend doing that again. The breading became soggier rather than crunchier with the double layer. Otherwise, very easy, very good, and it would be easy to "hide" some shredded carrots or zucchini into the breading to satify a picky kid!

Yum Yum Yum. I agree that it was not as crispy as some kids would like, but it was fine for me and hubby (and kids ate it up, too!).  I made half by just spraying with Pam Olive Oil spray (instead of butter) and then dipping in crumbs...tasted great and saved calories/fat.

As others suggested, I halved the salt, and other spices adding a touch of cayenne pepper.  I soured my milk by adding vinegar and let the chicken soak overnight (as per Alton Brown's suggestion when making his fried chicken)  Anyway, these were really really good.  My girls ate them in no time asking for more. Great picnic food, they're even good served cold!!!!  This one's a keeper!

Yum! This recipe is great. I made a few small changes...dipped in milk instead of butter, left out the thyme (didn't have any), added a little garlic powder, & used a little less Parmesan cheese. I dipped them in homemade BBQ sauce & they were delicious! My husband didn't even dip his in anything & he loved them :). I definitely recommend the trick of cooking them on a wire rack, because I did mine like that & they were perfectly crispy!

My nuggets turned out SO yummy! The one change I made was I took so of the other reviewers advice and soak the meat in milk with a little vinegar instead of the butter. I also used Pheasant meat instead of chicken and it tasted GREAT!!

These were so good! Crispy and better than store bought! I *used a baking rack, that probably is what makes them so crunchy without frying, and *put all my dry ingredients in a ziploc bag, and added egg-coated chicken to bag with slotted spoon, then just shaked! I transferred to rack using same slotted spoon. I didn't have to touch the chicken at all and clean up was simple!**

An excellent dish for toddlers! My 2 year old NEVER eats chicken or fast food chicken nuggets so I had my doubts. I can't believe she ate 8 pieces for lunch! With ketchup, but still! I don't like frozen chicken with preservatives so I made extra to freeze for later lunches. I also used egg instead of butter and garlic herb bread crumbs. This is a great dish to freeze and much healthier than grocery or fast food nuggets. DELICIOUS!

THE BEST CHICKEN NUGGETS! And so healthy! I only had plain bread crumbs so I added 1T Italian Seasoning, 1tsp each of onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, ground black pepper.  Didn't use butter, used milk w/capful of vinegar and 1 egg to dredge. Baked at 400 for 15 min on cookie racks and then flipped them over and broiled for 5 min.  They came out perfect and so tender!!  Also made the Honey Mustard Sauce on this site - I don't like mustard and this sauce tasted so good with the nuggets - it's a MUST!

Good recipe. Instead of making chicken nuggets, I used this recipe to make chicken tenders. The ingredients were able to coat 9 fairly large-sized tenderloins. Instead of using melted butter, I used 2 eggs whisked with a splash of olive oil. I baked these on top of a cooling rack (which I set on top of a cookie sheet) to ensure that all sides got crisp. Since I used tenderloins, I had to bake for an extra 5 minutes. Oh, and I decreased the salt (the Parmesan is salty enough). I really like the thyme flavor - nice touch.

This recipe was pretty good but not one of my favorites. We made half of the batch with butter as the recipe states and they were way too greasy for us. Then we made the other half substituting ranch instead of butter and they turned out much better. I could take or leave this recipe.

The Parmesan and the herbs tasted strange to me...the sharpness of the cheese and the somewhat bitterness of the herbs overpowered the chicken.  The flavoring definitely needs tweaking.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It is not rocket science, but a good basic meal to throw together quickly, which is why I pulled it up.  My kids ate, but didn't love it, there was too much seasoning and flavor (which I loved) for their taste, because they wanted to dip them in ketchup, ranch and honey, none of which tasted great with this.  I loved the butter in this recipe (healtiness aside), and plenty, almost too much breading stuck.  I would not use as much basil next time, and maybe plain breadcrumbs would be sufficient with the added herbs. Definitley a keeper, though.

Way easy and delicious, better than the frozen ones (although probably not anymore healthy). Does not serve 6, but will definitely make again. Thanks!  **UPDATED*** I now dip them in buttermilk instead of butter (saves a ton of calories). I grease the pan with cooking spray, lay the coated chicken pieces evenly, then I spray with the cooking spray. They still taste awesome and are A LOT healthier.  I mix 1/2 dijon and 1/2 honey for dipping sauce.

These were really terrific.  I used chicken tenders and cut them up, used the top of my broiler pan covered with foil, and used a whole egg with a LITTLE melted butter.  Will definitely make again, as they were devoured by my family.  Next time I believe I will flip them halfway through cooking time to get them nice and crispy on both sides.  Thanks for sharing!

Very flavorful and better than the fried version!  I also made this recipe with eggplant and it turned out wonderfully.  I recommend using a cooling wire rack on top of a baking sheet to toast both sides as recommended by another reviewer.  This is a keeper!

These were great!  I didn't add the basil as others suggested and had to put my dry mixture in the food processor as the cheese I had was shredded, not grated, but it came out fine!  I also used egg beaters rather than the butter and turned them over during the last 5 minutes and then turned on the broiler at the very end to really brown them.  This mixture also works well for fish filets (i.e. tilapia or other white fish).

This is a great recipe for baked chicken tenders, but would recommend using eggs rather than butter to dip chicken in before breading.  I also purchased chicken tenders, rather than breasts that needed to be cut up.  It's a good base recipe that you can easily personalize for your own taste buds.

I made these for my boyfriend who loves chicken nuggets. At first he said they were too dry, but tasted alot better the next day. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I might use olive oil instead of butter.  I will try it again for sure.

To reduced the fat I used egg white with a small amount of butter to coat rather than a 1/2 c. of butter. These turned out great!

These were excellent!  My picky 5-year-old even ate three of them and declared them "yummy".  They weren't as crispy as I had expected, but the flavor was great.  Next time, I will cut the salt in half though.  Both my husband and I thought they were a little too salty, but that may have been due to the kind of seasoned bread crumbs we use.

Great tasting recipe, so much better than any chicken nuggets you could get at a restaraunt or out of any box.  I found that reducing the amount of butter they still taste just as good, but cut the fat.  Kids and big kids both will love this recipe, and it is very quick and easy to make.

Tasted kinda funny... I used tofuken, ( we're on a vegan diet (except for bacon), dipped em in dijonaisse, used powdered dried lemon rind ( a little zing), skipped the basil and thyme - used marjoram and dill instead ( fresh of course ),  and deep fried em in lard ( scratch yer plate crispy! )…
Other than that and spraying with a wee bit of GMO corn oil - we followed the recipe,  then - we nuked em for a few minutes to ensure healthy eatin!!

(Dogs didn't care for em…. but we all sure scarfed em up !)

These were very flavorful and probably the best chicken nuggets I ever made.  I definitely will make them again.  They cooked for me in about 10 min.  rather than the 20 min. baking time suggested.  Came out of the oven tender and moist with a nice crunch to the topping.  I followed the recipe with the exception of omitting the salt.  I don't feel they need it and I am trying to restrict my sodium intake.

I used egg instead of butter for the chicken dip and it worked great! Great option for calorie watchers.

I made this in an attempt to get my extremely picky eater to enjoy something healthier than the frozen nuggets in the store and McD’s nuggets. Since my son prefers the dark meat, I used organic, free range, boneless skinless thighs. Also I used half Italian crumbs and half  panko. The panko made such a difference in the crunchiness of the breading! I also used olive oil with the butter. I cooked them for 15 minutes at 400 then flipped them and cooked for an additional 7 minutes. SUCCESS!! He loved them and ate all that was put in front of him!

I'm usually critical of recipes that are alternatives to normally deep-fried foods,  but this is a great alternative to the overpriced chicken nuggets you buy at grocery stores or fast food restaurants.  I used the skim milk and vinegar instead of butter per one of the other reviewers suggestion.  I added 1 tbsp of hot sauce and marinaded for an hour. Also added 1 tsp Cajun spice to the dry mix - I like the nuggets a bit spicy.  If you like them sweeter - ala Chic Fil A nuggets - then add 1/8 cup sugar - white or brown to the dry mix.   I also baked them 15 min. @ 400 then broiled for 5 min. to crisp them up  per another reviewers suggestion.  Only wish I'd doubled the  recipe  so I'd have more.   Hint:  really press the dry mix into each nugget.  Shaking in a bag doesn't get enough dry mix onto the meat in my option.

I've made these twice in a month's time...  absolutely DElicious!

I chop up 4 chicken tenders into 1  1/2" bite sizes, and let them soak in melted butter, while I prep the cookie sheet with a layer of aluminum foil and a rack sprayed with Pam.
Then I toss the chicken bites in a covered plastic container filled with seasoned gluten-free bread crumbs & parmesan cheese.
Then place them all on the sprayed rack about an inch or so apart, and cook at the 400-degrees for exactly the 20 minutes.    (i do not flip them) (the butter is necessary to 'oven-fry' them) (salt is not needed, cuz the butter & parmesan cheese is salty)
PERFECT every time.  Mmmmmmm
Served with honey mustard dipping sauce, mashed potatoes & sliced carrots.    Life. is. good.  :-)

I have made this recipe twice. The first time, I followed suggestions from other reviewers and substituted the butter with milk. They turned out dry and tasted terrible! My toddler would not touch them. The second time, I tried the recipe again but following the exact instructions. They turned out amazing! My toddler loved them this time and I thought they were a million times more tasty. I think the butter is key even though people think it's too fattening.

I made this for the first time, and it turned out great.  Loved the flavor and the lightness of the breading.  I will definitely make this one again.

I made in exactly as it says.. the whole family loved this and i have the pickiest daughter!  first time in a long time i didn't make dinner just to have her choose pizza rolls instead. only thing i will change next time is skipping the salt or using less. When it wasn't eaten with a dipping sauce, the only complaint was a bit too salty from the family. I added a little black pepper as well. thank you!!! new regular for us!

This turned out AWESOME and was a big hit with my 5yr old. I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs on hand so I substituted the bread crumbs for some stove top turkey stuffing I had. I crushed it up very fine with a spoon. Then added garlic powder, onion powder and seasoned salt. Grated some fresh parm and mixed it well. And added a Lil bit more parm on top b4 I put in the oven. Delicious!!!!

I'm not sure why the butter is better than using egg whites to hold the batter on. Wayyy higher caloric content, and I didn't think it tasted any better. If anything, it made the nuggets 'wetter'. I would make again, but with egg whites (like I usually do) - which is a substantial change from this recipe which is why I only give 3 stars.

Only changes I made was grated parmesan cheese (it's what I had on hand) and substituting the basil and thyme for oregano and parsley (again what I had on hand). But I will definitely be making this again. It was a hit with my husband and 20 month old son.

A great recipe!  
The two minor changes (due to allergies of dairy) I made was soaking chicken in non-dairy milk for 30 min first to make it tender and then drain milk and dipped into the breadcrumbs without using any butter.  I've used rice and coconut milk to soak the chicken in, both are delicious and less fat than the butter.  Thanks for the recipe!  I like  the italian spices.  So much better than store bought.  I'm sure the buttered version would be fantastic for those without dairy allergies.

I followed the suggestions to use half the salt and thyme (didn't have any basil).  Enjoyed these!  Next time I'd like to try the egg instead of butter and see how it tastes. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made with egg instead of butter! My son is a very picky eater and absolutely loved these. He doesn't even like chick fil a nuggets (which I love). On a low carb diet and these fit the bill. Will be making again.??

I stayed close to the recipe but used an egg to coat the chicken instead of butter. I found this to hold the crumb coating beautifully! Also, instead of using Italian seasoned crumbs I used Kikkomans Panko crumbs. Made them crunchy and yummy.

So much more than "just" chicken nuggets.  Excellent!  I am calling them "Herb Parmesan crusted chicken bits."  Kids and husband love them.  I plan to use them for appetizers at an upcoming dinner party with toothpicks.  Simple and slightly refined taste.

Everyone in the family loved this recipe. My kids have asked for chicken nuggets every week since I first followed this recipe. And now I make extras for the kids to take as part of their packed lunches the next day. 
besides reducing the amount of salt the recipe called for, I didn't change a thing.

Made these today for my picky children and they loved it!.  The only adjustments I made were that I used an egg since I was out of butter and didn't have italian bread crumbs on hand so I used panko bread crumbs instead.  It was a bit salty for me, so I might just omit the salt next time, but regardless, my children loved it!!.

I made these for potluck at church and they were gobbled up! I used plain panko bread crumbs, then added dried thyme, parsley, sage, onion and garlic (added these extra seasonings bc I didn't have Italian). Next time I may use egg to coat chicken instead of butter to make it a bit more healthy but these were delicious.

Like one reviewer I tried the cooling rack approach but I didn't have a baking pan large enough for the rack so I just used the cooking rack.  Turning the nuggets after 10 minutes gave me the uniform brownness that I was looking for, being sure to place the nuggets on a cooling rack after they finally came out of the oven to keep them from turning soggy which was probably moot since they didn't last long enough to get that way.  Also, not having bread crumbs, I used panko instead but I intend to try the recipe again as written.

Made a few adjustments  and wanted to share!  First of all, I used parchment paper instead of a a greased cookie sheet they did crisp up but I did flip them after 10 min and then cooked other side about 7 min.  I halved the Basil and thyme, added some garlic powder. And they were really good but my 6 year old didn't love them! . The thyme is still strong. FYI.  Still a pretty good baked nugget when adjusted to taste

I used  chicken tenders and only cooked 15 minutes! I also did the milk/vinegar instead of butter combo. This was very easy and tasted great!

I was skeptical about this recipe, despite the ton of butter, as my kids are completely hooked on frozen chicken nuggets.  I was amazed, as were my kids at how good these were!  I used whole wheat bread crumbs (made from just drying my old ends of loaves of bread) and added italian seasoning.  All the seasoning I was just winging it, but it turned out to have perfect flavor.  I only cooked mine about 15 minutes, used a rack like others suggested.  It didn't turn out as crispy as I hoped, but still delicious.  Though it didn't taste buttery, it seemed a bit heavy, so I'll try others' suggestions and use buttermilk next time.  I'll be using this recipe often.  Thank you!

I look to cook, but this was the first homemade chicken nugget recipe I have ever tried and I am a huge fan. The only things I did different was add some garlic powder to the coating and flipped the nuggets halfway through baking to prevent getting too brown on the side touching the pan. This recipe is a keeper!

I made these for my future wife to be as the cornerstone of our engagement dinner, and showed up with them when I knew she would be walking in her front after finishing her nursing shift. She was swept away by the smell, and although she said had already eaten, they were still greatly appreciated. I should have called her before deciding to surprise her, but have not been unable to find my phone for the last week. I guess love and good food is just spontaneous like that, and this meal may have just sealed the deal.

First time making chicken nuggets at home and kids loved it. I love it too that it didnt have any preservatives that store bought one had.I omitted Thyme because I didnt have it. Even without it, the output turned awesome. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Everyone loved them -- even the pickier eaters.  I ran out of butter and had to skimp on most - still delicious.  I wonder how well they would freeze and reheat?

Recipe turned out wonderful! I used chicken tenderloins instead of nuggets. I did not use the butter! I soaked mine in buttermilk for a while, then I used the other ingredients, exact measurements as the recipe called for. I did bake for 30 minutes. WOW! I got rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe Teresa! Saved as a favorite!

How can anyone do fried chicken nuggets when this recipe exists? These were great! I couldn't stop eating them. Followed the recipe to the letter and, as so many had recommended, placed these on a cooling rack to bake. Increased time to 25 minutes--nuggets were golden brown and crispy. Mmm. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Success! At the aforementioned suggestions, I substituted the butter for 1 egg and a bit of olive oil. I also set to broil for the last 5 minutes for added crispiness. I'm making this one a permanent household staple.

Love these for low key dinners. I love to use Italian croutons for my breading. I also tend to double bread them to make it crispier. Fantastic when eaten with homemade fries.

Very tasty. I followed directions and it turned out great. My husband said they were better than Chick-fila. I read that other put the chicken on a cookie rack... I might try that next time, but I thought they were perfect as is.

These nuggets were gross.  Perhaps they would taste better with a traditional breading.  But butter + Italian seasoned breading + parmesan cheese = gross.

I will try panko and eggs next time.  My 4 year old enjoy breading the nuggets but couldn't even get the nugget into his mouth because they smelled gross.

My kids are like most kids, they want food that isn't always the best for them.  So when I found this recipe I was so excited to try it on them.  They loved it, heck we all loved it.  I didn't use all the butter, but it was still awesome!  We will be making these again and again! Thank you for posting!

Wow! My whole family loves this recipe.  I am so happy to have a healthy alternative to chicken nuggets. I followed the suggestion of using buttermilk and broiled for five minutes after the initial baking time. I also made the honey mustard dressing II from all recipes, which I also recommend. This is a recipe I will share with friends and family.  We will definitely make this again.  Thank you for your contribution.

Made this recipe last night, everyone liked it. I wish the bottom of the chicken would have been crispy, put it on a cookie sheet, but the bottom was not crispy. Maybe next time I'll turn the chicken half way through baking it. I think the buttermilk was the secret. Family could not believe how moist it was. I actually put it under the broiler for a few minutes, just to brown it.

My whole family absolutely loved this recipe! I marinated chicken in buttermilk first, and skipped the butter. Other than that change, I followed the recipe exactly. This will be in regular rotation at our house from now on!

I used roasted garlic bread crumbs last time, because the store was out of the other kind, and they turned out awesome. We never have leftovers when ever I make these.

I'm 63 male, lazy when it comes to cooking BIG things( major projects) .. This was great ! easy ,tasty, & I doubled the batch (Even I know 1 batch was a tease ! ) .. did it EXACTLY (this was my first with this recp.). came out OUTSTANDING ! I did however use a egg wash instead of butter, & think next time will reduce the salt by 1/2...THANK YOU TERESA ! ;-) ( also made mashed taters w/ butter browned onions , & mixed veggies ! to die for ! Will ALSO consider using Turkey Breasts ( my fav. for reg nuggets )

I truly enjoyed the baked chicken nuggets. The flavors were good and robust. I will adjust the salt flavors based upon my dietary needs.

As written these are soggy and too salty.  using butter as the binder for the bread crumbs is not a good idea as the covering doesn't stick well and they don't get crunchy.  will try them again with some of the suggestions of the other reviewers and see if I get better results.

It was great! This is a basic, non-threatening chicken nugget for picky kids and an easy enough recipe for this busy kitchen challenged mom. My kiddos ate it. It held up for lunch boxes the next day.

I made this for my picky kids the other night and they loved it!  I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and used about half the amount of parmesan and Italian seasoning.  I did not have seasoned bread crumbs so I used plain and upped the amount of seasoning in the mix.  I also dipped them into buttermilk instead of butter to make them healthier!!  Yummy!!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Pretty good....family ate it up....used Italian whole wheat crumbs and sprayed my chicken with an olive oil spray rather than dipping in the melted butter. Tasty non the less....bet would be better with butter...but was trying to save some fat and calories. Also used a grated pecorino romano cheese...thanks!

I have made these several times my kid love them.  Even their friends love them.  I do not add the salt and I used unsalted butter, because the Parmesan cheese is already salty enough.  I also cut down on the thyme. They are awesome. I recommend making a homemade honey mustard sauce with them.  I always have to double the recipie and rarely have anything left over.

I'm not quite sure if I missed something, but I followed the recipe exactly and my family thought it was okay.  I make a recipe just using the seasoned bread crumbs and my family didn't taste a difference?

Excellent - my children ate every one and asked for more.  Some tasted a little saltier than others but I like salt.  If you do not like salt, definitely reduce or omit. Very easy!

These are the best nuggets/tenders that I have made.  I think the butter really makes them flavorful.  I loved them and my 2 year old did too...and she's a tough audience.

This is wonderfully flavorful. I made it once as chicken nuggets, then used it again to make backed chicken breasts--they came out so juicy! Works well with butter or egg wash. You can also set aside extra of the seasoning in the fridge for quick chicken next time.

Delicious! On other readers suggestions, soaked the chicken in buttermilk while prepping the breading, then baked on a rack on baking tray. Didn't have breadcrumbs, so put 2 loaf ends in food processor and added hot cayenne chili powder, dash of garlic powder and a bit of freshly ground pepper. 
I used 2 large breasts and would have needed more breading for 3, especially as I was already using a generous 1C bread crumbs. Will definitely make again!

These were pretty good. I did use an egg instead of butter and it worked just fine.

I make something similar to this all the time. I dip my chicken in a beaten egg and turn half way thru baking. Yummmy -- Plus you can make mini chicken Parmesan sandwiches too ( sliders) top with tomato sauce & mozzarella. My son is 13 mo and this is the only chicken nugget I serve

Upon the advise of another reviewer, I used butter milk to save the cholestoral of butter. It was a big mistake. I am using eggs next time.

I like the idea of this recipe but I think I added too much seasoning to each piece and let the chicken soak too long in the butter. If you are going to make this, moderation is key. I ended up with chicken that was soggy on the bottom and way too seasoned on top.

My son loves these!  I've made every other type of nugget and he keeps asking for these.  I prefer not to do the butter, but when I replace it with anything else, he won't eat them.

Delicious!   I put mine on a cooling rack which was on a cookie sheet and then under the broiler the last 3 minutes - they were crispy with great flavor!

These were okay.  I followed a reviewer's tip and used buttermilk instead of butter.  Next time I think I'll try the butter.  Very crispy but the flavor was a little bland.  They were good dipped in BBQ sauce.

Turned out awesome.  I used eggs and some olive oil in place of the butter.  I did not have any thyme on hand, so I used some marjoram instead.

One of my favorite recipes from no on. It is very tender and it tastes amazingly! I didn't put Parmesan. I also added quite a lot of garlic powder and some white pepper. I also added more salt

This recipe was great, and I've already made it twice this week!  I love how easy it is.  The only substitution I made was that I used buttermilk instead of butter to coat the chicken.  I served with "Ranch Dressing II" as a dip, and it was a hit!

These are AMAZING!  My daughter loves these nuggets.  We did a very rare stop at a fast food chain and she saw they had nuggets and wanted them... she HATED them!  lol.  Told me they were "disgusting"  (She's 3).  These are the only nuggets she'll eat.  'Nuff said!

I replaced the bread crumbs with oat bran (not oatmeal) and the butter with an egg beaten with a little olive oil to make it a little healthier.  I would definitely use this recipe again but i would use a cooling rack as suggested if you have one--not 100% necessary but a couple of the nuggets stuck to the cookie sheet when I turned them over.

Read reviews and made a few changes... Soaked chicken pieces in skim milk first, coated with egg and then with bread crumb mixture.  Did not use butter at all.  Turned out perfect!

There were really super good.  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used crushed up Ritz crackers. Also, although I usually prefer to use fresh parmesan, I used the sprinkle kind that comes in a shaker. This seemed to distrubute better throughout the mixture and helped in getting a good coating on the chicken before cooking it. The teenagers LOVED them. Definitely a keeper!

Loved this! Added spices to the bread crumbs and used the tip to spray the bottom of the pan and top of chicken before baking. VERY moist and crispy! Paired this with 'Baked Yam Fries with dip' from this site. The dip is great with these chicken fingers! Will make again soon:)

Made this last night and every member of the family loved this recipe. Followed member "resaleapparel'" suggestion and cooked these on a wire rack. I also added a small amount of cayenne pepper to the bread crumb mix, which gave these guys a little kick. This will become a staple in our busy evening meal plan.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  I dipped chicken in a beaten egg instead of the butter because I'm counting calories and they were still delicious.  Since I used italian breadcrumbs, I think the extra dried spices were a little overkill.  Next time I'd omit them.  The thyme was really strong.  But overall this was a very delicious and healthy meal that I'd make again.

Nice and simple. Like one of the other reviewers, i dipped the chicken in milk rather than butter to lower the calories. Also, i skipped the thyme and basil because my kid is a picky eater. he loved them and actually asked me to make them again! Yea!

I substituted EVOO (Olive Oil) for the butter.  I make bulk food like this for my 15 month old.  Found the recipe one hour ago and pulled the chicken breast strips from the oven 5 minds ago.  WONDERFUL, thank you for the recipe

Not bad. Eat them all fresh out of the oven, though. Reheated, they turn into flavorless rubbish.

Yum!  So good!  I didn't have fresh parm so I just used the kind in the green can.  I also dipped it in egg instead of butter.  I was so delicious and tender!  My husband loved it.  Great recipe!

Super easy and good! I'm not a big fan of the thyme and basil so I left them out and used eggs. This is great for a quick lunch or dinner.

These were definitely the best breaded chickens I've ever made at home -- I'm sure it's the butter! I was making these as part of an Asian-stye menu so I left out the cheese and thyme, but kept the other measurements. So good! It'll only feed 6 if those 6 aren't very hungry though if you're using standard serving sizes of 4oz each! So tempting to overeat! Thanks for the recipe :)

This was a easy recipe to make and it was wonderful. i did change the butter to egg for less fat and also used homemade bread crumbs and fibre one cereal to give it a healthy kick and it turned out great. i am keeping his recipe to future use.

These were great!  I am so grateful another user posted about using the cooling rack inside the oven...my nuggets were perfectly crispy!  I was also in a hurry and found that soaking the chicken in the butter mixture (I made mine half butter half egg) and then coating them with breadcrumbs by shaking in a gallon Ziploc bag worked beautifully.  These are definitely going in my recipe book.

I didn't enjoy the herb flavor on these. I prefer my nuggets simple,battered with the basic flour,egg,salt,onion and garlic powder.I deffinitely won't be making these again.

These are definitely "good" but I was expecting more.  I placed the nuggets on a rack on a cookie sheet (as other suggested) but the crumbs fell off and burned in the over causing quite a smell.  They were tender but not as crispy as I anticipated.  Our grandchildren didn't care much for them.  Next time I won't use the Italian Style bread crumbs, but rather plain bread crumbs.

These are very good chicken nuggets!  I dipped them in an egg before putting them in the bread crumb mix.  I think the bread crumb mix could be reduced by a third...I had a lot of bread crumb mix left over.

Really good and overall really easy.  Probably should have used a meat thermometer to make sure not overcooked.  Could use a little more flavor.

These were really good!! I made some butter milk & marinated my cut up chicken in it for a few hours. Then I skipped the butter & shook my chicken in a zip lock baggie with the dry ingredients. I could have used half a cup of bread crumbs I had a ton leftover! I also left out the thyme (hate it!) Baked on a cookie rack to crisp them up & they were so delicious & very moist! Next time I think I'm going to add some pepper & some garlic to the dry ingredients & maybe even try crushed crackers for some added flavor! Overall great meal though :-)

These nuggets were delicious & tender!  Followed recipe exactly.  I broiled for 5 minutes at the end of cooking time.  Leftovers tasted well the following night and did not dry out when heated in the microwave.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

Delicious, easy...I made it with butter the first time and with skim milk the second, and I think either way is good, so I'll be doing milk from now on just to cut back the fat.

This was awesome! Very tasty, turn half way through backing for even browning. Also, I recommend using half the serving of salt and less of the cumbs and cheese--I had too much left over. Another thing I did was double coat a few pieces.  It was very good, better than expected. I highly recommend!!

I made this for the first time tonight, and I will make it again.  However, the next time I make it I will be leaving out the salt (I didn't put in as much as it called for and it was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY too salty!!!) and will most likely cut the thyme and basil down quite a bit.

These are sooooo delicious! I've used a similar recipe where you dip the chicken in dijon mustard, instead of melted butter, before coating in crumbs--it's awesome as well! Try this recipe!!!!

Very tasty nuggets.  I used coconut oil in place of melted butter for my share, it gives them even more flavor!  The coconut oil nuggets did not crisp up as well as butter nuggets.  I would recommend flipping the nuggets halfway through cooking so they crisp up on both sides when using butter.

These werent too bad.  The coating ended up a bit dry eventhough I sprayed the pieces with PAM... which I guess is to be expected when baking  a bread crumb coating.  I would flatten the breasts next time so the pieces are not so thick.  I will try this again sometime.

I loved everything about this recipe except I felt that the nuggets were entirely TOO SALTY! The next time, I will eliminate the extra teaspoon of salt. The bread crumbs and the parmesan cheese have plenty of salt to make these tasty.

Fantastic! I'm working on replacing the processed food we used to turn to, and these are a wonderful replacement for chicken nuggets in a bag. In fact, all I did was cut the chicken and the 9 yr old did everything else. I used two egg whites instead of butter, added a dash of onion and garlic powder to the breading and a healthy bit of fresh black pepper. (There was lots of breading left, but not ONE piece of chicken was left over).

Really good and crispy. I took the advice of another and used vinegar and milk instead of the melted butter. I also baked the chicken on top of a cookie wire rack.

Great recipe! Cooked them on a rack & I added a packet of dry Ranch dressing mix to the breading & it had a great tang to it!  Also, 5 minutes or so before it was done I sprayed non-stick cooking spray (butter-flavor) on both sides of the tenders & it gave it an added crunch. Hubby said to put it in the regular rotation :)

Kids absolutely loved these!   Prepared using the cookie cooler thing on top of the sheet as described in other posts.  Also some vinegar splashed in mild as the coating for a healthier twist and it worked great

These were great. I made as indicated but replaced the salt with garlic salt.  I also turned the nuggets partway through and took them out when they looked crispy.  I think the total cooktime was longer than what was called for here.

I LOVE this recipe! It's fun and easy. I made it for a friend of mine who has 4 kids that are picky eaters. They all liked them and she did too! She kept telling me they tasted gourmet.
Some times I use butter and sometimes I use eggs. Depending on what I have. I don't use salt, but I do use pepper instead.

The Parmesan cheese made these nuggets have such a nice flavor.  The family enjoyed these and I like how they are baked instead of fried.  Will definitely make these again.

Using the cooling rack did help, but I think flipping them half way through would help keep both sides crispy.    I tried it using the milk and vinegar as a substitute for the butter as one of the reviews says. They turned out OK but would probably be better with the butter or maybe even egg. I will re-review if I try them again with butter.

came out great, I cut up and seasoned the chicken the night before and also added egg to the butter. used Italian bread crumbs and then added a little Parmesan cheese. i wish i had a rack to put them on because when flipping them the shell of stuck to the tray :( but over all it was amazing and 1 millions times better than going to mc donalds # just saying

These are really good! I like to cut them up into bite sized pieces in put them in garden salads!  Only difference is I half the thyme and basil.  I'm just picky about those herbs.

I liked this recipe, go a little easy on the parmesan as its flavor is very pronounced in the original iteration of the recipe. Also use a butter alternative and cook on a rack as suggested, else they get a little soggy on the bottom.

I tried to make these exactly as stated, but found out I was out of Parmesan cheese and only had half of the amount of Italian breadcrumbs needed. So I improvised: I made a double batch so I used 1c Italian crumbs and 1c regular crumbs. I added basil, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt to it. I did dip the chicken in butter. Baked 23 minutes, didn't turn them and didn't need to. They came out perfect! Next time I will use all Italian crumbs, but will add garlic to the butter.  These were excellent and loved by my 6 kids AND myself! That never happens!

I used the measurements the recipe calls for, except I was trying to make it lighter, so I used milk instead of butter. I also followed the suggestions and baked them on a rack on top of a cookie sheet. I was a little disappointed. Mine never really "cooked" on the outside even though the chicken was finished. I put them under the broiler for a minute at the end, and that crisped them up a little, but not really the way I wanted. I think its a really good idea, so I will definitely try it again with the butter and doing it directly on the cookie sheet to see how that turns out. Even with the butter, its got to be healthier than fried. Thanks for a really good idea.

Love this recipe.  So simple.  Only substitution I make is margarine instead of butter.  Also, the mix is enough for 4 chicken breasts instead of 3.

We really liked these.  I didn't want to add any butter to the recipe, so I coated my chicken pieces in plain nonfat yogurt instead.  They didn't stay crispy to the second day that way, but the flavor was great!  I didn't have any thyme so I skipped that also.  Great kid-friendly meal.

Very easy and yummy dish.  Great healthy food for the kids since the chicken isn't fried.  Didn't have a problem with the crust not sticking.  Putting on a wire rack over cookie sheet worked great.

Don't substitute the butter, it's worth the calories!  My whole family LOVED these nuggets.  Definite keeper!

I was not a big fan but my kids liked them so I'm being generous with my 4 stars. I used the wire rack and put them under the broiler for the last few minutes but they still were not crispy at all. The bread crumb texture was sandy.

I made these as one of the foods for my sister's bridal shower and they were a HUGE hit!  I had so many people ask how they were made.  I used some of the suggestions here: I used unflavored Panko instead of breadcrumbs, I dipped the chicken in eggs instead of butter, and I baked the nuggets on a rack on top of a baking sheet.  Other than those three things, I followed the recipe exactly!  I've never gotten so many compliments!

Delicious recipe! I followed the suggestions of other users, and dipped the chicken pieces in an egg mixed with a splash of olive oil to cut down the calories. Still tasted great and is just as good leftover on a salad

For about 2lbs of chicken, a half-stick of butter was plenty.  To save time with the whole dipping procedure, we just poured the melted butter over the chicken in a bowl and mixed it around.  Then put the chicken in a different bowl and gently mixed in the breading.  Worked perfectly and no messy hands or wasted baggies.  Baked on broiler pans, then broiled at the end to crisp it up a little.  Quite good for a healthier chicken nugget option; we ate with barbeque sauce and honey.  Do they taste like REAL chicken nuggets?  Well...no.  To really get my nugget fix, they have to be deep-fried, sorry.

I only had 2 chicken breasts thawed, so I used those and cut the ingredients in half. I used fresh parsley in place of thyme, since I didn't have any. I think I will shake off some of the bread crumbs before baking next time, as they seemed a little dry on top. They were a tad burned on the bottom, so next time I will either turn them 3/4 of the way 10 minutes in, or I will switch to broil when there are 5 minutes left.

Really good!  Better than the ones made with Shake and Bake.  I omitted butter and dipped them in 1 egg mixed with about 1/4 c. milk.  Also used 1/2 the salt, thyme and basil since the crumbs are seasoned.

The perfect dinner for the first night of spring soccer!  Quick, easy, portable, and best of all, nobody said it was disgusting.  Made it just as written except took earlier reviewer's advice and baked it on a cooling rack so both side could crisp up.  Very good.

These were OK.  I really didn't care for the whole "butter wash" thing.  Seemed too greasy for my taste, but my husband liked them just the same.  Not really sure I'll be making these again.

My husband is a big fan of these nuggets!  I altered the recipe a bit: substituting 2 beaten eggs for the melted butter, and subbing chili con carne powder from Penzy's for the herbs. I used plain panko bread crumbs instead of seasoned. My goal was to make it a little crunchier, spicier, and healthier. I consider it a big success :)

These are really good! I love the flavors1 Much better than the frozen kind! My ultra fussy daughter wouldn't eat them, (nothing against the recipe- she wouldn't even try them), so I can't give then five stars.

Excellent! Used panko bread crumbs; next time I may crush them a bit, then dipped the chicken in "buttermilk" and baked on the cooling rack over a cookie sheet. Easy and better than anything you'll find prepackaged. The fresh grated parmesan made it superb!

Very tasty with the exception of being waaay too salty.  Cut the salt to 1/2 tsp and it should be better. Better yet, use crushed ritz crackers and omit the salt completely.

My husband and I thought these were amazing! I loved them so much! I will definitely make them again. The only thing I will do next time is add less salt. Still awesome though! Best nuggets I've ever had!

Followed recipe exactly and turned out delicious! I did bake them on wire cooling racks as others suggested so both sides got crispy.  Great with some hot sauce!

What an easy recipe! I took the suggestions from other reviewers and used milk instead of melted butter, and baked the nuggets on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet. I could probably have coated another one or two breasts with the batter. The only change I will make next time is to use half the amount of salt listed. Thanks for an easy recipe to jazz up otherwise boring chicken!

With these nuggets, my 2-year-old consumed chicken at home for the first time in his entire life (sadly, I'm serious) and told me several times how much he liked them. My 4-year-old thanked me at least 10 times for making them and told me I make "The best chicken nuggets in town! Even better than Wendy's, McDonald's, and Target!" Definitely a keeper at our house!  I made the recipe as is, but added a tsp. of garlic powder. Next time I will cut the bread crumb mixture down by a bit because I had WAY too much.

The last time a served my 3 year old grandson frozen chicken nuggets, they were so tough he couldn't bite through them. After making this recipe tonight, I'll NEVER buy frozen nuggets again. These were wonderful and so much better! Boyfriend doesn't like herbs so I didn't put them in, but I used seasoned salt. I also took the other reviewer's advice and used the milk with vinegar instead of butter; worked great! I am sooo happy to have this delicious and economical recipe!

These were really yummy. My husband and three year old scarfed them down. I made them with mashed potatoes and green beans. Delish! I also used beaten egg rather than butter to coat the chicken. Also, make sure not to overbake or they'll turn out dry. Reheated nice and crispy in our toaster oven! =)

These chicken nuggets are delicious!!! I did not follow the recipe. I did half butter and half egg mixture and I added minced garlic to wet mixture. I also added garlic powder and ground mustard to the dry mixture. I used organic bread crumbs from trader joes instead of italian bread crumbs. Great recipe! My husband loved it! Served with honey to dip the chicken pieces in.

Very good nuggets!  My VERY picky 2 yr old loved them!  I did the breading using half bread crumbs and half panko.  They were very good.  I might do full out panko, because I would have liked them a little crispier.  I did not use a baking rack so only one side was "toasted".  I will probably use one next time.  I also would probably cut the baking time by 5 min or so, because the chicken was slightly dry. I did not have Italian seasoned bread crums, so I used plain crumbs with about 1 1/2 tsp of  McCormick's Herbes De Provence (which contains rosemary, marjoram, thyme, savory, and lavender).  I very much enjoyed the spice. It smelled like pizza while baking.  :) Also, I only had 8 strips of boneless, skinless chicken tenders, so I cut them into thirds and then did the recipe.  They worked out excellent!

Really easy. I don't even add the extra spices and it turns out great every time. I've also tried mixing mayo and melted butter instead of just mayo and that's great too.  We used this recipe for fresh caught fish which was delicious!

I made these for my kids who eat to many processed chicken nuggets. I used Panko bread crumbs and instead of the butter, I used buttermilk. Not only did my kids like these but my husband like them also. Next time I make these I'll double the recipe and freeze some nuggets.

These were just okay for my tastes. My nuggets came out extremely moist and tender, which I loved. But something about the actual taste threw me off. I wish I knew what it was, because I was expecting to like this one a lot - I love Parmesan. But I highly doubt I'll be making these again. Thanks for sharing though.

Last night I made frozen bagged popcorn chicken and thought I would try the homemade ones tonight, the homemade ones were way better than the bagged ones but not as crispy. I had a lb of chiken tenderloins that I cut up into little pieces. I dipped half of them in milk and half of them in butter, then followed recipe as stated. I baked them seperately so I could decide which ones I liked better. The dipped in butter was way better had more flavor. I broiled them for 3-4 minutes at the end to try and make them crispy. Very good for the kids will make again and try to freeze some.

instead of making it into nuggets, I used full chicken breasts.  turned out very good even my husband that doesnt like baked chicken, liked it!  I cooked them at 375 for 20-25 minutes.  I also used egg instead of butter to coat chicken.  Then I poured the butter over and let it bake. yum!

I've made this so many times, and it's delicious! However, I liked it so much better when I added a cup of crushed corn flakes to the mixture and a 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. It made them crunchy, and with almost a tiny bit spicy. Absolutely delicious. Add the corn flakes!!! You'll love it!!!

Very easy, delicious recipe. Even my kids love it, which automatically deserves a 5* in my book. I've made this twice and both times thought that I can half the bread crumb mixture - or double the chicken w/ original recipe.

These were good...but they sticked to the cookie sheet like crazy...not sure what I did wrong, followed the recipe I would just make sure you put lots of non-stick cooking spray before baking :) my husband loved these but I thought they were messy.

Very simple and delicious.  I used the cooling rack like someone else suggested and they came out very crispy.  The only thing is that for some reason mine took way more than 20 minutes to cook.  It took them more like 40 minutes on 400.  Not sure why - they were not big pieces.  Very yummy tho and worth the extra wait time!  Thanks!

These were really easy to make and they came out great. I tweaked it a bit. Instead of the herbs I substituted it for Italian Seasoning. I also added garlic powder. I also took someother reviewers suggestion and instead of soaking the chicken in butter I used milk

These are delicious... I didn't have Italian Seasoned breadcrumbs, so I made my own and added some Italian seasoning... other than that I followed this exactly, although I will admit that I baked them on a baking rack so that they'd be crispier. Thanks so much for sharing such an awesome recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used a beaten egg instead of butter. Awesome! So easy, my roommates loved them, and they taste and look better than traditional chicken nuggets.

My kids loved these. They have been missing chicken nuggets for a while and these seemed to help them with that. Mine didn't get to crispy so next time I think I'll flip them over half way through baking them. Thanks!

Great recipe! Husband loved them!! I too used the milk instead of the butter and they turned out well. I cooked them a little longer than the 20 minutes just to make sure they were done. Also turned them 3/4 of the way to ensure they were browned on both sides. Used Italian seasoning instead of basil and thyme recommended and it worked out fine.

These were pretty quick, easy, and tasty. I think the bread crumbs didn't stick too well with just the butter holding it to the chicken - next time I'll make an egg wash.

This recipe is yummy and easy. A couple small changes, I seasoned my chicken w/ salt and garlic ahead of time. I mixed italian seasoning in w/ the breadcrumbs along w/ the parm cheese. I used I cant beleive it's not butter instead of regular butter. I baked them 17 minutes on one side then turned and baked for 3 more minutes. I didnt grease the cook sheet and it was fine. I served them w/ honey mustard for dipping and then maashed potatoes and corn as sides.

YUm.. used panko, fresh parm and no butter.. just sprayed them with olive oil spray. They baked up very tasty. I reheated leftovers in a 350 oven for 10-12 minutes and they crisped right back up

Great recipe!  I used panko bread crumbs and followed others suggestions and used egg and evoo instead of butter.  Baked on the cookie coolers and broiled at the end.  My 6 year old told me they were better than chick fil a's!  Fibbing a little?  Maybe, but making a Mom's night , priceless!

These were very yummy! At first I was a little nervous because if seemed like all of the breading was falling off but they were perfect!! :) I did broil them for about 2 min on each side to make them a little more crisper!

This was a hit with my family.  I took the advice of others and dipped them into egg with olive oil.  I also added garlic powder and baked them on a cookie rack placed on the baking sheet.  What a great way to keep them crispy.

So good! I made a few changes, and these were so great! I used crushed cornflakes combined with a small amount of bread crumbs. I added garlic powder and itialian seasoning to the mix, and it was so yummy! Instead of using butter before dipping, I made my own "buttermilk" by combining skim milk with a cap full of vinegar. The end result was a super juicy and moist chicken nugget! These will become a regular in our home, and once we have kids I will make this for them regularly!

I picked this recipe because I'd been craving chicken nuggets but didn't want all the calories of store bought or frying. I did beat an egg and add in some olive oil as another reviewer did, then I threw it all in a bag and shook it up! I'd recommend doing it this way as I can't imagine it'd be the same without the egg for stickiness. It turned out great! I served it with some Parmesan Ranch dressing and a side of pasta, and my boyfriend loved it. Not as good the next day and a little on the dry side though, still really good right out of the oven.

I followed the recipe, but next time I make them I will adjust by.... it called for to much butter, I will probably only use 1/3 cup, I also used a cooling rack over my baking sheet to help it stay crispy on the bottom, it worked great!!  Will make extra next time and freeze for my daughters lunches.

Great recipe.  Another way to cut calories and fat is to dip the chicken in fat-free ranch dressing before coating.  Kids liked it.

Very good! I've added this one to my keepers. To reduce the fat content,I used 1/4 cup egg beaters instead of butter.

My kids loved it and so do my husband and I.  I omitteed the butter and used 1/2 cup of milk with 1 1/2 - 2 tsp of white vinegar (let it sit for five mintues to "set up" a bit).  I also followed other reviews that suggested baking them on a rack at 400 for 15 min then broiling for 5, they came out cripsy on both sides!  Because of the Italian seasoning (which is not that overwhelming by the way) I gave my family some leftover pizza sauce to dip it in.  It was a hit!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent! So easy and delicious too. These are italian flavored though so they won't go with any dipping sauce. My husband didn't care for these, he would have preferred plain unseasoned chicken. I loved the italian flavor. These turned out nice and crispy and even though I forgot to grease the baking sheet, they didn't stick and turned out great. Thanks for posting this, I enjoyed these.

These were great.  Took the advice of another reviewer and put the chicken on a cooling rack and then put that on a baking sheet.  This made the nuggets very crispy.  Much much better than the processed junk you buy in the frozen food section.

My 7 year old son loved these nuggets.  I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts and they came out great.  My son paid me the best compliment when he said "These are better than the ones at Sonic(drive in food restaurant)!."  Made my day. Thanks for the great recipe.  We'll be making this more often.

I skipped the herbs because the kids don't like leaves in their food - and the flavor was great.My only complaint was that they were a bit dry. Overall pretty pleased and will make these again.

These are a fabulous and healthy alternative to the regular fried chicken nuggets.  Everyone I have made them for LOVES them! The only thing I do different is drop the chicken in buttermilk (or 1 cup milk w/1-2 tsp of vinegar) before I put the coating on them. I think the buttermilk helps keep the chicken moist.  You've also got to use fresh grated parmesan for it to really turn out good.

very yummy.  I made strips instead of nuggests.  didn't have buttermilk used a bit of sour cream, yogurt and milk to marinate chicken.  Made my own mixture of bread crumbs with italian seasonings.  Thanks for the wonderful idea.  It was yummy!

Very good. Used the cooling rack method others had recommended. Cooked for 15 min. Broiled for 2 min. Crunchy outside, moist inside. My 3yr didnt even need the ketsup! Thanks for sharing.

A couple of changes...I used olive oil to coat the chicken pieces, and the pan.  Also, used just a t. of ital. seasoning in place of the seasoning.  Also added ground flax seed to bread crumbs, and on top of all the pieces before baking, for extra nutrition...the kids never knew :)  This is an awesome recipe, moms!!  Feed your kids better by making these easy homemade nuggets...no more store-bought, processed junk!  Just give yourself an extra 20 minutes, and you'll be doing your children a great favor!

These are good, even my picky husband said he would eat them again.  The only change I made was to use 2 whole eggs instead of butter to coat the chicken.  I did not use a wire rack like many recommended, so they weren't too crisp, but very tasty and tender.  Thanks!

This was a great recipe, the chicken was so tasty and moist!  We finished all of them as soon as they came out of the oven.  The ones we ate last were a little bit soggy, but next time I'll cook on a wire rack so they can crisp up a little bit better.

These are so yummy. I also made some modifications to make it healthier: for dipping sauce, I used 2 beaten eggs as recommended by others. I used Panko bread crumbs because they were the only type I had on hand and added the spices as indicated in the recipe. I used a light coating of cooking spray on the cookie sheet and then put in oven at 400 for 15 min as recommended. I then broiled, but only for 2 or 3 min as they would otherwise burn. They came out so tender and so delicious! Some reviewers recommended the Honey Mustard Sauce from this site, but I thought it was extremely fatty so I left out the mayo. I just added equal parts spicy brown mustard and clover honey and voila - a great dipping sauce for these yummy nuggets, and much healthier to boot!

I used half the salt, thyme and basil recommended and added a bit of garlic powder. Instead of the butter, I used a couple of beaten eggs. These are so simple and so delicious! I usually serve them with oven-baked fries and baked beans.

Great chicken recipe! I followed it exactly with the exception of placing the nuggets on a wire rack and spraying them with Pam before baking. They turned out moist with good flavor. My husband and 8 yr. old loved them. I served the chicken alongside Creamy Twice Baked Potatoes from this site and green beans, for a delicious meal. Glad to add this to my collection.

These are the best homemade chicken nuggets I've ever made. I've made these multiple times at the request of my boyfriend, who absolutely loves them. I've also used chicken tenderloin strips to make these as well. I use canola oil instead of butter, Italian style bread crumbs, and a different mixture of spices to taste (usually paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, dried basil leaves, dried oregano leaves, Italian seasoning, and sometimes rosemary.) I think these nuggets taste best when dipped in "Honey Mustard Sauce" from this site.

These were so simple but good!  I used chicken tenders instead of cutting up a chicken breast.  I followed another reviewer's tip to cook on a metal rack over a baking sheet (I just used the rack from my toaster oven).  This worked like a charm.  The inside stayed moist but the bottom did not get soggy.  I served with pasta shells florentine from this site and it was great together.

WOW.  these are delicious!  I can't say enough great things about these.  Relatively easy to make and so, so, so delicious...the parmesan taste is wonderful.  I had to bake mine longer than 20 minutes, maybe my oven is slow?

Yum, yum, yum! I used about 1 1/2 cup of milk and 1 tsp of vinegar instead of butter, and just regular bread crumbs instead of Italian. I also spiced it up with a little bit of dry bbq seasoning. Served with bbq sauce... it cooks a little quicker if you make bite size nuggets, but the prep then takes a few minutes longer. I like the idea of baking things that you would normally fry. I served this dish with baked French fries, and corn on the cob! Like I said YUM!

These are so good & easy to make.  I have three children & my son loves chicken nuggets, but is very picky about what kind of nuggets he eats:)  He loved these!!

These were great and super easy! I took the advice of others and used egg instead of butter to make the breading stick. I also flipped the nuggets halfway through so that both sides would get a little more crispy.

Great flavor!!  I didn't change the recipe a bit.  I tried 2 batches, 1 baked and 1 fried in a pot of canola oil.  Both were fantastic!  Frying was much faster and gave the nuggets a real nice golden brown color.  The baked nuggets were just as flavorful but took longer and weren't as dark and crispy.  I will definitely make these again!!

Loved this recipe!  I did as previous posts mentioned and placed chicken on a rack a broiled for last 5 minutes.  Very flavorful recipe and will plan to make again soon.  We enjoyed with both honey mustard and barbeque dipping sauces.

We loved these!  We liked the herbs and the parmesan flavor, and they were just crispy enough for us.  Next time I will try dipping them in olive oil instead of butter, and I would love to try this with fish!

These were great! I replaced the butter with beaten egg, and left out the salt; but I put all th herbs in and they were fantastic. I made a quick dijon sauce with cream, dijon mustard and taragon microwaved for about 30 seconds to go with.

Oh my...loved this recipe. My family mostly eats chicken, and you think that most "chicken nuggets" are the same...but I loved this one! The nuggets are moist inside and crispy on the outside. I followed the advice of another and broiled the last five minutes or so. Probably should have turned over once to keep crispiness consistent, but still are definitely great. This will replace my usual nuggets coating mix. Thanks!

I needed a last second recipe for the chicken i had thawed.  This was great.  I chopped everything and the kids did the measuring and all the rest.  They decided to chop broccoli to go with it.  THEY LOVED IT.  each kids ate double what they eat on average nights.

I did broil the nuggets for the last few minutes and i think it browed them nicely and made it a bit crispy.  

For my husband and myself, i put buffalo sauce on them.  they were fantastic.

This is a keeper.

WOW...my family loved these.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.  If anything, I would flip them over half way through cooking so that they would crisp better.  I used a stone baking sheet.  They were really good and this will be a recipe that I keep.

Good stuff!  Want to make prep real simple and significantly less messy?  Melt the butter in a large microwavable bowl.  (You can actually cut the butter somewhat with this method.)  Put the cut up chicken in the bowl with the melted butter.  Toss to coat.  Then dump in the bread crumb mixture.  Toss to coat.  This way, the temp of the chicken doesn't make such a difference either.  (I noticed this in someone else's comment.)  My niece has to limit her dairy intake, so when making this for her I skip the cheese and add a bit more bread crumbs.  It still tastes great!

Pretty good.  After reading the other reviews I dipped the chicken in egg first instead of butter.  I skipped the spices and salt, and added some ground pepper.  I drizzled melted butter over each piece before baking.  I would make this again, very easy and better for you than fast food!

These was a great breading recipe, my only complaint is that is was too salty.  Because grated parmesan usually already has salt added, next time I will leave the teaspoon of salt out.  Did not have thyme so I made without, still flavorful.  I sprayed them with butter spray half way through so that they would crisp up a little bit.

Wonderful!  This was so incredibly easy and my girls loved it.  The flavor was great for both children and adults (not too sweet or too savory).  I also loved it because it is incredibly adaptable... tweak the spices in the breading and you're good to go with almost and "theme" meals!

My small son and I really liked these.  They were even good cold, left over!  I also used egg to dip them in rather than butter,  The only problem I had, was by the end, my crumb coating was very soggy and clumpy from the first chicken pieces, so I couldn't get it to stick on the final pieces.  I think we will make this again, though!  Thanks!

This is a great recipe although I used an egg wash instead of butter.  I used the butter instead to drizzle over the top of the coated chicken when I baked them.  It made for a crunchy nugget!

These were very good and easy to make. Next time, however, I will add some garlic salt and fresh ground pepper for that extra kick. Good basic recipe. I also used egg instead of butter (to coat the chicken) to cut down on fat. Worked great!

These are pretty good.  I did dip in an egg wash first, then in the Italian breadcrumbs, dipped in the butter with a little garlic powder mixed in, then dipped in Panko breadcrumbs because the Panko crumbs are so crispy.  Panko is a Japanese breadcrumb.

I really like this recipe. My husbands only problem with it was that he would've like it better if they were fried rather than baked. It did take a long time to coat all of them with the bread crumbs. Next time I will try using a ziplock bag.

This recipe was easy and made a lot of chicken nuggets for only using 3 chicken breast. I didn't use as much salt and I only sprinkled basil and thyme in. I thought it tasted like there was a lot of salt or something.. maybe it was the parm cheese.. not sure. My husband liked it.. although, I think I wouldn't add much parm cheese next time. Good with honey mustard.

Pretty good. Very tasty although next time  I will dip them in an egg mixture so the bread crumbs stick better. I found they weren't "crispy" and the bread coating was very soft. I will work on this one to see if I can improve them.

These are so easy to prepare and everyone likes them---adults as well as kids.  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand when I made these so I crushed croutons instead.  Since they are already seasoned, I didn't have to add any salt or pepper.

I needed something quick to make for dinner and this was a great hit! I didn't have any Italian crumbs on hand though. So instead, I crushed up some Ritz crackers and they turned out so yummy! Will definitely make these nuggets again.

GREAT recipe!  My 7 and 6 year olds loved it...and even ate their peas for more nuggets.  All I heard at the table was chewing and "mmm" noises.  My son asked me to "make this a lot!" The hubby enjoyed them a lot too!  The mix makes a lot and I think you could cut it down a bit to save a few pennies.  Thanks for a true kid friendly recipe!

I'm in college and I need really easy, quick recipes so I can eat and run. A bit too much preparation for my liking. I think they would have been good if I wouldn't have burned them. I think the 20 minutes was too long, or maybe it was the 400 degrees. I also found all the measuring of the spices a big pain. I would suggest guesstimating.

Panko breading mix spices were all wrong. and too salty. Tasted like a failed attempt to make micro mini chicken parm pieces (dip your own sauce). Two stars for the technique of rack on a lined cookie sheet.  Won't make again. Would rather have fried chicken or commercial nuggets. Can't understand the many 5 star reviews-

The butter sort of leaked out in the oven and because of that it wasn't really able to get crispy and the breading had a hard time sticking.

These were good. I used milk instead of butter, as other users suggested. I also coated the chicken twice to make sure they were coated well. I also added a dash a cayenne for some spice.

Way too much thyme. Next time I will use plain bread crumbs. These almost need a marinara to dip with since they are soo Italian-style seasoned.

I made it exactly as per instructions. It was moist and flavorful. Much better then shaking and baking. I know I could have changed it all kinds of ways but this is the recipe. Make them the size they say too. The flavor explodes in your mouth if you don't  cut them up smaller.  I also didn't  dip them in anything to get the true flavor experience.

Super easy, tastes good. I used a couple of suggestions of other reviewers: used a cooling rack over the baking sheet so it would crisp underneath, and stirred an egg into the butter for the dipping liquid (cooled the butter slightly). Seasoned to my personal preference. I'll do this recipe again.

I cooked these two different ways - air fryer and oven. They were both great in their own ways. The air fryer ended up being my favorite (fiancée's was the oven). I put the leftover breadcrumbs and cheese  in the oven to crisp it up and cook out the bacteria. Then I used it as a topping for the carrot rice I made for added texture and flavor.  I also used it as a dip for the nuggets for additional crunch.

I didn't have thyme so I used organo. I used a beaten egg and took out the cheese, it turned out amazingly. We had no leftovers.

I have made these many times. They are a favorite of my picker eater and the whole family. I used panko and added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning since the panko wasn't seasoned. That's only because it was what I had in my cabinet. I have used the seasoned breadcrumbs before.

I will definitely make this again. It works great on whole chicken tenders too, just increase the baking time.

First time my toddler actually ate the chicken I gave him!  Win!  I followed the breading recipe, soaked the chicken tenders in milk with a bit of white vinegar (or you could use buttermilk) for about 10 mins and then dipped into the breading.  Sprayed breaded chicken with canola spray and baked at 400F on a raised grate on a foil-covered cookie sheet  for 20-25 mins.  The tenders were not crispy as I had hoped, but they were a win for my 16 month old.  May try a bit of panko next time instead of all seasoned bread crumbs.

Did not change them recipe much.  Did not have Italian crumbs so used regular with some Italian seasoning added. 
They were very tasty.

Very good recipe. We would reduce the sage and thyme-did not put in the full amount this time, even when doubling the recipe. Not sure which had the strong flavor, and it was more flavor than we prefer. Otherwise, a nice light coating and tender inside.

It was good, but not great. Hence, the 4 out of 5 stars. I followed the recipe exactly as is, but found it to be a tad too salty and lacking depth. Not anything crazy amazing, but still good. It's best served with marinera sauce

We love it!!! Finally, a healthier and tastier option for the kiddos! I did follow the milk and vinegar (butter milk) option offered instead of butter, and cooking them on a cookie cooling rack ( in the reviews). This one's a keeper! Thank you!

These were great!  I put the dry ingredients in a baggie so everything got coated, then flipped half way thru cooking.  They came perfect, crunchy outside but tender inside.  Will definitely make again!  Thank you!

quite good.  Remember to dunk them in butter before the breadcrumbs.  I didn't. But still good. Drizzled them with butter before baking.

This is by far my favorite recipe I've found on here! There are a few things that I do different. I don't like the butter to breadcrumbs - so I use milk. I also add half breadcrumbs and Pankos, so much crisper when using them both together. I also add different spices. I use the basil, thyme, garlic powder and italian seasoning. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us. I've even passed it on to family and friends.

Very simple yet delicious. I made it for my girlfriends 3 yo son, who is a very picky eater, and he loved them. On top of that, both of us adults enjoyed picking at them too while I made our dinner. Such a quick dinner that we for sure will continue to use this one in a pinch.

Watch the sodium content in this recipe, I use unsalted butter and don't add any salt. The parmesan cheese and the bread crumbs have what I need and I season the chicken with Mrs. Dash for flavor. Picky kid likes them and family loved them.

The more breading, the better! Both the kids and I like that crunchy outside of the nugget. Definitely gives it that "fresh-out-of-the-freezer-dino-shaped-nuggets" feel that the kids are crazy about. The adults were happy too. A little BBQ sauce and we were in nugget heaven.

My kids loved these!  Even the picky eater who never eats nuggets without BBQ or ketchup said they were so good he even likes them alone. Love that these are baked and are pretty quick to prepare and cook. Thinking we might be done with frozen nuggets for good. I did use egg instead of butter following other reviews and only had plain bread crumbs so I added a touch of Italian Seasoning.

Delicous. I placed my chicken in a food processor to give it that fast food chicken texture the second time around. Will continue processing the meat from now on.

These were sooo good!   I used Panko bread crumbs.  After putting the breading on, I put them on a sheet pan with a wire rack on top.  Cooked them for 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven and then FLIPPED the nuggets over and cooked for 5 more minutes under HIGH BROIL.  Came out perfectly crispy on both sides.    The entire family loved them!

Mmmmm good!  Made it just like the recipe said.  A stand-by for feeding the kids.  :)  Great cold, so we take them on trips packed in the cooler for finger food.  Works well to melt the butter in the pan you will bake in.  Then, add the chicken, stir to coat and dump breading on top.  Stirring to coat.  Fast and easy!

Tastes good, but butter turns the  breading to mush. I tried to broil after done to crisp it up without much luck.

This is the best chicken nugget recipe, by far!! So easy to make, and so much better than frying. I followed recipe to a T, it does require a lot of butter, but its worth it. My whole family loves them!!

I love this recipe. It's easy to follow and quick to make. I did some changes to the recipe. I soaked the chicken in seasoned buttermilk. And also made it into tenders instead of nuggets. Definately recommend this recipe.

As some other reviewers noted, this came out soggy from the butter, and too salty. I did not love the seasoning choice - it was too much for traditional nuggets, and not the amazing blend one might expect for a seasoned nugget.

Isn't the whole point of baking something to not add grease? Will try again using something else to hold on the bread crumbs - milk, egg, anything really.

These are so easy and always taste wonderful! I add a couple eggs to the butter before coating the chicken and it helps keep the breading on.

Thought a recipe with this many stars and reviews would be a sure thing.  These were tasteless, soggy and gross.  If I hadn't made several dipping sauces to drown these in, they would have been inedible.

This turned out great!  I used tenders and also used melted Earth Balance spread to dip the raw chicken in. Baked on a rack for 20 minutes, rotating halfway through cook time.  Then finished by broiling for 3 minutes.  

My husband and I really enjoyed them. Will definitely be making this again. It was so easy.

I used boneless, skinless chicken tenders. I LOVED this. The chicken was moist and had so much flavor. I used two pounds of chicken and still had a lot of breading left over, so I'd probably reduce some of the spices and breading mix. But I will definitely be making this again.

Yep delicious! I took suggestion of baking on a cooling rack & turned out very crispy.  Next time I will use cooking spray first.  They did stick just a bit.  Saving this!

A family favorite.  Quality differs according to quality of breadcrumbs and parmesan you use so keep that in mind. The technique is great. Turns out crispy and so much easier than battering with egg and pan frying.

Loved these. Took recommendations and used eggs instead of butter, and baked in a wire rack. Need to remember to flip the nuggets 15 minutes in and broil for 5 minutes. So delish a nd not greasy.

I found this to be a little to salty but the flavor was good. Next time i'll reduce the salt and hopefully that will make it better.

These are so tasty. Just a little too salty. I will use less salt the next time, maybe half or none? I will definitely make them again.

All in all a good recipe. Way too much thyme though! Half it unless you just love thyme.

I found them a little flat for taste and I think I left them too long in the buttermilk mixture as they were not as crunchy as I would have  liked them to be.  Will try again though.

It was great! My sons loved them.... which says A LOT for my picky eaters. I did the recipe as is, no changes. I will be making this often! By the way, butter isn't bad for you. It was given that reputation when corporations wanted to push the "like butter" products as healthier (buckets of spreads and such) because it was cheaper for them to make. Which we've found out, they were not healthier in the least. But if using something different makes you feel better, that's understandable. There are plenty oils out there that all of us should partake in often for several different types of foods. One of my faves is avocado oil, then olive oil.

I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was great.  I wouldn't touch the flavors but may kick it up a notch by adding a touch of the Chipotle bread crumbs too.  However, crispy on the bottom, not the top.  My rack may have been too low, but next time I will tweak it using egg in place of the butter and cook using a rack & foil as others had done.   I only added sea salt & fresh ground pepper (cuz I love pepper)  Granddaughter requested them in your school lunch tomorrow instead of a sandwich.  Now that's an endorsement!   Definitely will make again.

Yum yum. I also made it in strips - just as good and a bit faster. Great with plum sauce or mango chutney. I did find it too salty - the Parmesan already adds salt.

Fast and easy to make and fairly foolproof. I used italian seasoning blend instead of the individual spices and when I ran out of regular bread crumbs I used some panko for the last few nuggets. I will definitely make this again!

Made with olive oil instead of butter to coat the chicken (family member avoiding dairy). Added oregano to the spice mix instead of thyme. Panko bread crumbs. Flipped near the end of baking time to ensure more even toasting. Best nuggets ever.

The breading mixture and butter could be halved and you should always cook anything breaded on a wire rack to crisp the bottom.  Otherwise the recipe was good.

These turned out great. I did bake them on a rack to ensure crispy texture all around. Also I made them with my 3 year old niece so we cut them into heart and star shapes. We will definitely make them again. Thanks

Definatly turn these over after 15or20 min.  They will brown on both sides.  Panko works with bread crumbs so they won't be too salty and have better texture.

These were yummy but I made some changes. The first change  I made to cut back on the sodium was using  plain panko bread crumbs  instead  of the seasoned regular bread crumbs. They were still delicious and super crispy.  Instead of the melted butter I used one beaten egg and a splash of milk to coat the chicken before dredging in the bread crumb/cheese mixture.I served this with along with roasted cauliflower. My 5 year old son loved all of it and asked for seconds!

these were so tasty and MUCH more easy than any other nugget recipe.  most recipes like these usually call for eggs but I was running low on eggs so when I found this one, I was so excited.  very quick and easy but I would recommend to double (or triple??) this recipe because it will go very fast!!!

This is such a simple, quick and delicious recipe. First time we tried it we followed the recipe. And it was yummy! Kids ate it up. Second time I added garlic powder and onion powder to the seasonings. Even better! This will become a quick and easy staple when I'm short on time. Eat it with a bit of rice and a side of steamed veggies! Dip in ranch or ketchup or BBQ sauce. Thanks!

They were pretty good, not great. I couldn't help but keep thinking how killer they'd be if fried, but I guess that's the point of this recipe.

The grandkids will never want restaurant chicken nuggets again! I did use the suggestion on cooking for 15 and broiling for 5 to finish, as well as the cooking rack to keep the bottoms off the pan. Both great suggestions.

There was too much breadcrumb mixture and the coating slid right off.

Thank you for a great recipe :)
My toddler and his toddler cousins loved this for mid day meal! I loved it as well. It comes out nice and crispy without a ton of fat hanging on the cooking sheet or the meal plate. I did cook the chicken slightly higher temp of 420 for 20 mins. 

I did substitute the butter for olive oil- which I placed directly on the chicken, before the breadcrumb mixture. Also subsitituted panko for breadcrumbs because it's what I had on hand

I made this recipe exactly as is, and I thought it was awful.  It was too salty, and the crust was not crispy at all, just mushy.  I was also not fond of the flavor.  Will go back to frying my chicken nuggets.

My family loves these nuggets.  I think that 1/2 cup butter is too much.  I think 1/4 cup is plenty to simply toss with the chicken.  We were out of bread crumbs so we mashed up one sleeve of Ritz crackers.  Worked great!

Great recipe! My husband ate most of them. Kids and I didn't get too many. That's ok, I can make more. The only thing I changed was the basil - I didn't have any so I had to omit. Subbed with parsley instead. I'll definitely be making these again.

Big hit with the kids and parents too! It was so helpful to look in the comments and see the tips people had. I soaked the chicken in vinegar and milk instead of butter. It was tasty :)

These were great. My husband fried his nuggets and I made these as an experiment. Both of us preferred the baked option. I did put them on a cookie sheet, to crisp up the bottom, which worked great!

I used milk with vinegar. The coating changes I made were to finely grind up dry oats, salt to taste, minced dry onions, and original salt free Mrs. Dash blend.

It didn't taste like chicken nuggets.  More like smaller pieces of baked chicken. Not bad, but not what I would go to when craving nuggets. Maybe if it were fried??

The flavor of this was good and they were juicy and tender.  Not crisp however! I did them on a rack over a sheet pan and it would seem that 400 should have crisped them but it didn't. I think I will try convection next time.

Followed basic recipe closely, but I did use a rack, as another reviewer suggested. The nuggets did not brown using this method.  The grandkids enjoyed them (good flavor),  but next time  would bake directly on the sheet, turning halfway through baking.

Great recipe! I used the cooling rack over cookie sheet to bake them as recommended by others and they were crispy, delicious. My breadcrumbs were not seasoned so I used the salt indicated but it would probably be too much salt if using seasoned bread crumbs. I wil try egg instead of butter next time to make it healthier

These were super easy and delicious! I used one of the tips of another reviewer to cook them on a cooling rack. They were crispy all the way around. Even with thawing out the chicken, this took me about the same time to make these as heating up frozen chicken nuggets. But these were so much better and the spices are perfect. Definitely making these again!

The first time I made these I was looking for a fresher chicken nugget that wasn't processed or frozen junk. I followed the recipe but I didn't like them much. The kids said they were too salty and the flavor was off. So I tried again but made some changes.  Used an egg dip, omitted the salt and butter, used plain panko instead of Italian bread crumbs, omitted the dried herbs listed and in place I made a batch with fresh Italian seasoning, garlic powder and fresh ground black pepper. The other batch I made with Weber brand Kick'N Chicken Seasoning for a more adult spicy flavor. I did turn halfway to cook more evenly. Overall a good starting recipe if you're new to making chicken nuggets but as is it needs tweeking.

Made this over the weekend and brought it to my neighbors house.  Even though I made a ton, the three of us just polished it off... it was delicious!

The only thing I did different was instead of dipping it in butter first, I dipped it in fat-free Italian salad dressing. 

I used Wish Bone light honey Dijon salad dressing as a dipping sauce and that was extremely delicious.... highly recommend!

I have made chicken nuggets before with eggs instead of butter but this time I seen this recipe and thought why not I'll try it. It might just be my provocative but I will stick with the eggs instead off the butter for now on. It just didn't taste right to me.

I looked at this recipe and thought I am going to make it that way and another way and have a test.  Well one I used the bread crumbs and the other I used Panko and put it on a rack.  I used everything the exactly the same.  When I pulled them out of the oven I asked my kids what they thought.  They liked the look and taste of the one with Panko so much better.  So this is the reason for the 4 star.

Delicious!!! I had plain bread crumbs so I used that instead and I only put 1/2 tsp salt in it. I also listened to some of the other commenters and I dipped them in milk and a capful of vinegar instead of butter. It is moist, tender, and delicious! I will definitely make it again, although it's a bit tedious. Thanks!

I substituted panko breadcrumbs instead of italian breadcrumbs.  I accidentally used salted butter instead of unsalted & these came out VERY salty.  My fault!  Next time if I use salted butter I won't but salt in the breading.  I also lined the pan with parchment paper which made clean up super easy!  The kids loved them even though they were a bit too salty (again, my fault).

I did use thighs instead of breasts. And added some smoked paprika because well I'm hooked at the moment. 

I will never even consider buying store bought ones now.

Quick, easy and tasty. I made it for lunch with sweet potato fries. I did bake for an additional 5 minutes because I wanted the chicken to brown a bit more. I will make this again!

Great!  Easy to fix, uses ingredients many people already have in the pantry, and tastes good.  Appeals to adults as well as little kids.  Good without a dipping sauce.  Did use half the salt called for; next time will use none.  Also, as suggested by a few other reviewers, used a cookie rack placed inside a baking sheet, so that it would bake better.

I used 8 chicken tenders and baked it for 25 minutes on 350. I cut down on the dried herbs slightly, but it was very good.

These were very good, but for my personal taste, 1 T. of Basil was too much.  I would definitely make these again, but I would cut the Basil to 1 t instead.  Mine didn't look like the photo when they were done, but they were quite tasty!  Dipped in honey mustard and oh yeah!
   Will definitely make again!

These nuggets came out better than I thought they would ! The kids loved them with some bbq sauce and the adults with some Buffalo sauce.
The only thing I have to say against  this recipe is that it leads to some waste of ingredients. 
I had 3 medium size chicken breasts and I was sure 1/2 cup of butter was going to be too much. So I started with 1/4 cup, thinking if needed I will get more. But that amount was enough. Also, the bread crumb mixture was a lot more than what's needed to coast 3 chicken breasts. More than half of it was left over. So , my advice, for the amount of chicken called for in the recipe, cut in half  the rest of the ingredients.

I will make these again :-)  they were really good  but my husband thought they were not crispy enough.  for the second batch I put them on a cookie rack and they did seem a little more crispy but I think cooking them normally on a baking sheet and turning them 3/4 of the way through would have been best.  Also maybe cooking them a little longer.  they were good though and very moist :-)

Easy and delicious!!! Used homemade breadcrumbs as I had some leftover buns to use up. Made for my daycare kids (2 three year olds, and 18 mo old, and a 9 month old). Everyone loved it! Will definitely make again, might even try to make ahead and freeze for a super quick meal. :)

These. are. delicious!!!! I followed the recipe as is, and they came out great! They have such a wonderful flavor. They're not super crunchy but did have a little bit of crispness to them. So, so much better than frozen chicken nuggets! Thank you for the awesome recipe!

This is my second time making this. I have to say the second time around was much better. The first time I followed the recipe to a T. And I found it to be too salty.   This time around I omitted the salt and I found that it tasted better. Even my picky 3 year old ate it!! My husband loves this recipe!! Will def do it again.

Family really liked this.  I cooked these on a cooling rack, but I should have sprayed the rack with a little oil first...the nuggets stuck.  I also used beaten egg instead of butter to dip the chicken in before bread crumbs.  My picky daughter even liked these!

Soaked the cut up chicken breasts in buttermilk (milk + vinegar actually), then made as directed, baked on the wire racks as others suggested.  Delicious.  A little soggy on day #2

My husband and I loved this recipe. I made chicken trips instead of nuggets. I cut the required amount of butter by half and added almond milk to the butter. I also added some cajun pepper to the bread crumb mix. I will  be making this again!!

I love this recipe, however for just my husband and myself, we like dry potato flakes, so I substitute part flakes with bread crumbs to make them even more crispier and omit the salt.

I used the rack method and it was crispy.  Nice blend of flavors.  I cut my nuggets thinner to keep them juicier.  I served them with a roasted Brussel sprouts and Apple's recipe also on this site.  Satisfyingly healthy!

Loved this recipe. I followed exactly as written, because I'm trying to learn to cook. It was beyond simple to accomplish, which is a must for me because I'm so new to cooking. My daughter loved them, and she is  four. I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for sharing it!

This was a definite winner at the dining room table and super easy to make. The kids were all hurrying after school the next day to get their hands on the leftovers! This recipe would also be great to cook in bulk and freeze to eat later.

Very easy to throw together but it's lacking in the flavor department. Maybe some garlic would kick it up a notice. Also I'll try baking them on a wire rack next time to make them crispier.

Absolutely love this recipe!! I did however change it up a little by omitting the cheese and using 2% milk to coat the chicken instead of butter and added some garlic salt!! Yummy! Plan on making a huge batch to freeze next time! My family loves these nuggets!

Instead of butter we used egg whites.
Tried it with butter but came out soggy

these are a little more work than frozen, but taste SO MUCH better, and are not hard at all!  My daughter helps me with the dredging, and we usually double the recipe.  Everyone in the house loves them, even my picky 7 year old!  :)

These were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as I always do the first time around for any recipe. However, I made half of the bread crumb mixture with panko. My husband preferred the panko nuggets whereas I preferred the original. We agreed they were both great!

I love chicken nuggets but have always hated that the coating on them is so greasy and fattening. These are perfect. The coating is nice and light and actually has flavor. I will be making these a lot!

The taste of these is good but I managed to improve it a little. Here in Finland we don't have Italian breadcrumbs so I make my own with spices. But I also toast breadcrumbs to make my own shake n' Bake. here's what you do: layer the bread crumbs on a clean, dry frying pan and set it over medium-low heat. Once it heats up, use a flat-tipped spatula to scrub the crumbs off the bottom layer and shake the pan to re-even them. After  few minutes they start to darken and then you should scrape and shake every minute to void burning them. Soon they will be the color of toast. Remove them from the pan immediately and let them cool, then add the spices you like -I go with Herbes de Provence, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and onion powder-. You can make as much as you want and store for later use. They give baked things the look of fried and well, they taste better :)

Right away I need to say that I left the cheese out of this recipe, but they didn't need it. They were great on their own! However, they were pretty salty; next time I make them, I will probably leave out the teaspoon of salt.

LOVE this recipe!  I have been making this regularly for a while & just realized that I have never written a review!  All 5 in my family love it.  We eat these more like chicken strips & serve with homemade honey mustard.

Tried these last night and they were gobbled up very quickly by 8 adults! I used panko instead of breadcrumbs and still works great! This is a fantastic childhood favourite!

Awesome. Just like Mom's chicken cutlets... Except baked is healthier and smaller chicken pieces means more amazing bread crumb mix! 

I added some liquid smoke to the butter dip!

I made these for myself and my 1 year old, who usually does not like meat. I used half the Parmesan cheese, used eggs instead of butter and skipped the salt entirely to make them a little more tiny person friendly, and served them with a very basic tzatziki-esque dipping sauce. She gobbled them up, and I found them very tasty too.

I made as directed I don't think the issue is the recipe it's that my kids weren't interested because it doesn't look like McD's.  Maybe if I re-introduce again it'll go over better as the older kids liked it.  However, the target people I was making this for didn't like it (7 and 10 yrs old.  I know, I know....)

These chicken nuggets were fantastic.  Only change I made was to add garlic powder to butter--got to have that garlic.  Served them with the Honey Mustard Dipping sauce from this site.  Delicious!

I liked these a lot! I don't think it's necessary to cook for 20 minutes-more like 17 minutes. I didn't realize that I forgot to add the parmesan cheese and salt, until AFTER they were all baked. However, the chicken was delicious and this recipe is so easily adjustable. I will definitely be making this again, and maybe adding my own flair to the recipe. Thank you!

Awesome....I have made it three times and everyone loved it? The first time it was a little salty so now I do not add the salt at all. it is perfect that way as we like to salt to our own taste.

Whipped these up for my kiddies for lunch. SUPER easy + I had everything on hand (bonus!). I love the idea of baking them rather than frying in oil - oil is such a mess & baking is much healthier! These turned out very tasty!! I only had two chicken breasts but it was enough for the four of us...I had a ton of leftover breading. My two older girls didn't rave about them, they said the were good tho.  My 2 yr old gobbled them up! I served them with honey-mustard, BBQ & honey (didn't have any ketchup).

Loved 'em. At first bite my 11 year old "No, thank you." Then he started getting hungry watching the rest of us gobble away and he tried one again and ended up eating 4 or 5. The kids dipped them in ketchup and I dipped mine in creamy caeser dressing. Yum! Will make again, just as is.
thank you!!

Made this recipe before, it's great! I've done a cheddar and Doritos take on this too, it's super easy and really tasty when you need something on the go but don't want fast food nuggets!

This was a good dish, but seemed a little one note. I even added a bit of chili pepper for some heat, but it needed more. Perhaps adding double the pepper, half the salt, and 1 tsp of hot sauce to the melted butter will do the trick!

I brined my chicken for 3 hours before baking (2 t sugar, 2t salt) to give the chicken extra flavor and tenderness. I used half Panko bread crumbs and half italian. It only took 6 TB of butter. The taste was perfect. It fed 6 people.

Just made this tonight. I took the advice of others and cooked it on a wire rack so both sides crisp, it didn't work.  The chicken was juicy and the flavor was good but it didn't crisp like store bought ones.  The plus side is these are healthier for you.

I loved these, if short on time you can also fry them up with a little oil in half the time, they're already coated with butter so you don't need much oil.

These were pretty good for healthier chicken nuggets.  The only changes I made were to use buttermilk for coating instead of butter (I was in a healthy mood) and I only used 1/2tsp of salt.  They didn't brown very well (probably the lack of butter) even with some cooking oil spray and they weren't very pretty to look at, but the taste more than made up for it.  They weren't bland at all like some chicken recipes can be.

This is a great recipe. So much better than store-bought frozen chicken nuggets. I subbed the bread crumbs with almond meal and the butter with coconut oil and it was amazing.

All six of my picky eaters loved these nuggets!  They even asked for me to make them for lunch again the next day!  I love that they are baked and had a wonderful crispy coating...amazing flavor!  This is one we will be making time and time again!

Really good! Maybe a little too many spices for me, so I would recommend getting rid of the thyme and basil, and just stick with the Italian bread crumbs which already have spices in it. I added a bit more cheese for that amazing cheesy taste, and it turned out amazing!

I made per directions, but I did turn them half way through. These never browned up, so they looked the same coming out as they did going into the oven. They weren't crispy. Just flavorless. The bread crumb texture wasn't pleasant in the mouth. I used chicken breasts, and I think they were too thick. My kids didn't feel like they were eating chicken nuggets, they felt like they were eating chunks of chicken breast. I baked for exactly 20 minutes and they ended up dry. Sorry, it was a bust for my 15yr old, my 12yr old, my husband and me.

Great kid friendly recipe. My kids love this recipe and it's a good way to get them to eat chicken. I always turn the chicken nuggets about halfway through cooking so that both sides get a little crispy. Even my husband loves this recipe, though I should note that we are not ecotic tastes kind of people. 

Also, since we make this recipe so often, I make a large batch of the breading mixture and keep it in my fridge. Then I just pour out how much I'll need when I'm ready to make it. Saves a lot of time on nights when I'm looking for a quick meal.

This was a HUGE hit in my house! Didn't have basil but still came out very good. Going to use some of the other suggestions next time and going to use fresh grated pram next time also. My two girls liked them so much they asked to have it for their school lunch the next day!!

As I did with their fathers and uncles, I'm now teaching my grandchildren to cook.  This is a great recipe for teaching! They learned to 'pound' the breasts to a uniform thickness and cut them to an appropriate size.  They understand why we chose to soak things in an acid bath rather than use butter or oil -- we tried it both ways.  They love the original seasonings with Panko crumbs and marinara sauce.  But this recipe also lends itself to improvising and the kids tried shorting the thyme and basil and adding some chili powder, garlic and oregano and using queso for dipping.  Another winner. Thanks so much for giving me a recipe that allows me to continue a tradition with something relevant to this generation.  Out of such successes cooks are made!

I can only rate this based on my family's reaction since I didn't have a bite to eat - they ate the whole thing before I could sit down.  They said it was very good.

My 7 and 5 year old boys loved this recipe.  I baked for 30 minutes on cookie racks so both sides cooked evenly, then broiled for 10 minutes to crisp them up. The kids couldn't believe they weren't fried and they said they were better than McDonalds.

Tasty! Breading each individual nugget got boring pretty fast, but work was not in vain with end results. I used crushed crackers in place of bread crumbs as I didn't have any on hand, and replaced thyme with oregano. I also baked half of them straight on the cookie sheet and half raised on a cooling rack. The ones on the cookie sheet were crispier and had more of the golden look. I turned all the nuggets over at the end and baked for 5 more minutes. Husband and baby both enjoyed.

I cut the chicken into 1 inch chunks and soaked the chunks in milk for about 2 hours in the fridge. I also baked the nuggets on a cooling rack. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and 16 month daughter LOVED the nuggets. I thought they were a little too salty but good overall.

This recipe was a hit! My two sons, ages 6 and 8, are pretty finicky eaters. They were ready for a second helping in the couple of minutes I spent consolidating used cookware and plating my own food.

As for myself, I think I'll have to tweak it a little next time.

Good recipe with quick prep for a family dinner.  I omitted the basil because I was out and used plain bread crumbs.  I think next time I'm going to add another tsp salt because they were a little bland and replace the butter with an egg wash.

So good!  followed others advice.  Used skim milk, egg white instead of butter.  baked on a cooling rack and broiled for a couple of minutes at the end to crisp them up.  Perfect for the kids and perfect for the parent to put on a salad.

Made these with thighs, worked great.
Also, I did the standard flour, egg, breadcrumbs, not sure what's with all that butter.
Anyways, kids devoured them, so I'm happy!
Serve with honey mustard, you'll find a great recipe on allrecipes.com

While they tasted really good, the amount of work put into seasoning them up I feel could've been done faster by simply using shake and bake parmesan flavor.

I didn't think these were anything special, unfortunately. I thought with the Italian breadcrumbs and Parmesan they would be better than most nuggets, but sadly these were way too salty for us.

We really liked this recipe.   I just wanted to add a few notes.    I did find the breading made more than we needed, but I used 3 portion sized chicken breasts.   I could have easily used 5 chicken breasts for the amount of breading.

I melted butter, but I didn't melt a whole stick, I figured that would be way too much.   I melted approx. 3 T worth and it was fine and there was some butter left over after coating the chicken. 

When you use butter, it makes it nice and brown/crispy on the bottom -- I didn't really have to worry about flipping it.  Like one of the other reviewers I just broiled it at the end to brown it on the top.

This is definitely a keeper :)

EXCELLENT flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I might do different next time is flip the chicken 3/4's of the way through cooking so both sides end up crispy.  Otherwise, PERFECT and I plan to cook again!

I always wanted to get away buying frozen chicken nuggets for my kids so when I saw this recipe, not only my kids love it at least I know they are eating much healthier nuggets. It goes well with honey mustard dip plus I used Ritz crackers or Japanese bread crumps and i worked well.

Love the recipe as is, but I also use it as a base to work from.  I tend to use yogurt and milk rather than egg or butter to coat the chicken, and I when I have old bags of chips, I mix crushed chips and panko to get a unique crust.  I've had tortilla chip crusted chicken and even sun chip crusted chicken.  And I use chicken tenders and don't always cut them into nuggets.  It's faster and cooks just as well.

Its homemade shake and bake chicken, not really what I wanted/was expecting. You can't really pick up the chicken like you would a chicken nugget because all the bread crumbs fall off. For this same reason you can't really dip the chicken because all the bread crumbs fall off in the sauce. 

I'm not a fan of shake and bake so I didn't think this tasted very good.

I was looking for a recipe for Chicken Nuggets for my grandchildren. Because of their allergies, I was looking for one without egg, milk or cheese. So I revamped this recipe to their needs. I used her "butter spread"...I skipped the cheese...I didn't have Italian Bread crumbs, so I used Ritz Crackers ( crushed) and seasoned it with Mrs Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning. It was quite different the way I did it, so how could I give it 5 stars ,...2 reasons...it didn't use eggs and I could use her "spread" and the original recipe sounds SO good, I will try it with my husband. By the way...the kids loved them!

We really liked these. I did decide to use beaten egg instead of butter. One egg was just enough to coat all the chicken. I think I could have halved the breadcrumb mix, as I had a lot left when I finished. I wanted to prove to my daughter's boyfriend that homemade was better than shop bought and he had to agree after eating these. Thanks for the recipe Teresa.

My kids, 5 & 7, LOVED these.  They are extremely picky eaters and they ate every single bite.  I will make these again.  I used crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs and I omited the thyme.

I have made these several times with a few changes. I put spray butter (non fat) in a dish with garlic and dredge the pieces of chicken in then.  I use italian seasoned bread crumbs and panko bread crumbs and lowfat paremsan cheese and put it all in a ziploc bag. I then throw all of the chicken pieces in the ziploc bag and shake until all pieces are covered. Then put on a cookie sheet well covered in PAM, then I spray each piece lightly with Pam and while cooking I turn over once. We like our's crispy so the last 5 minutes I turn up the broiler and take out to our liking. We make with the honey mustard dipping sauce on this site. perfection, they taste they are fried without the fat!

Family pleaser!  I made my own bread crumbs which was very easy. Like others, I used milk and vinegar to coat the chicken instead of butter.  I also placed the chicken on a wire rack over cookie sheet to cook on both sides.    Very good and tender.

My hubby loved these, I thought they were just o.k. To be fair, I made my own breadcrumbs + spices--I wonder if they would have been better with store-bought Italian breadcrumbs.

Didn't have bread crumbs in the house so I darkly toasted two slices of whole wheat bread and ground them in the food processor. Added a few dashes of garlic salt and some dried basil, then only used half of the butter to dip the chicken in. Loved how they crisped up in the oven. I lined the cookie plate with parchment paper to ease clean up.   MY TWO YEAR OLD AND 8 YEAR OLD LOVED THESE!

I used milk and vinegar as suggested instead of butter.  I also didn't add any seasonings because the breadcrumbs were seasoned.  I didn't cut mine into nuggets, but used precut chicken strips.  I turned them half way through baking.  They turned out crispy and juicy.  Next time I'll try adding a little more seasoning though.  I'm thinking a tbs of Italian Herbs seasoning would do the trick.  I served this with marinara sauce.

I altered the recipe. I used chicken tenders since that is what I had. I also used homemade croutons and crumbed them up in a mini food processor/chopper to make bread crumbs. They were garlic flavor. I forgot the parmesan cheese. So after completely changing the recipe, it was fantastic. I also mixed dijon mustard and some honey together to dip them in. I will make these again.

I made this exactly as written and it was great. Next time I will try the use of milk or egg to dip in before the bread crumbs to cut back on calories. This was good and easy for a needed quick lunch.

Wonderful! I am in college and love to cook for my friends. I made this for a few of them and each of them loved it, saying it was degrading to call it "nuggets" since it was far better than any nuggets they had ever had. I will definitely continue to make this wonderful and easy recipe

This recipe is good! I would agree the Panko crumbs make it best and by adding garlic to the mixture makes it even better. Next time I will be trying buttermilk instead of butter to lower the fat, plus you could marinate overnight with garlic to give the chicken more flavor.

Great flavor.  My kids and hubby loved it.  The coating did not get as crispy as I would have liked but the flavor made up for that.  I used the leftovers in a ceasar salad the next day.

We used the recipe on chicken tenders, it was great, we put italian cheese blend on some of them and served it with pasta and a red sauce.  The kids ate them as they were with the pasta on the side and everyone enjoyed it.

these were fantastic. absolutely awesome. I only had 1/2 the amount of bread crumbs I needed to I substituted with 1/2 finely crushed saltines. I sprinkled some paprika and garlic powder on the chicken before dipping. I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome these were!

so, these turned out moist, but the taste didn't go over well.  i'm not sure if it was the brand of breadcrumbs i used or just all the addtions to the breadcrumbs.  i will try again with a different brand.

Yummy! Very tasty and picky toddlers approved. I used an egg to dip the chicken instead of the butter.  I also cooked the chicken for 25 minutes too.

these were really good. Made them for my 4 and 2 year old.  I used promise light instead of the butter and used shake n bake mix instead of the bread crumbs only because thats what I had on hand.

YUM - I left the recipe out for my hubby to make while I was out, and from what he said, it was easy to make.  My 3-year-old liked them as well.  One change we made:  We used crushed oyster crackers in place of breadcrumbs because we were out of breadcrumbs - they turned out great.

These were really yummy and so much better than processed nuggets. I used plain yogurt in place of the butter and they turned out great. Next time, I might leave them in the yogurt longer to tenderize, but they were tender as is. Thanks for a great recipe.

Easy to make and my daughter and her boyfriend seemed to like them. I think the cooking time is a little long, and the amount of dried basil seems excessive. Thanks!

Very tasty and kid-friendly.  I took the advice of other reviewers and did not use butter to coat the nuggets but instead used skim milk.  I also baked the nuggets on an elevated cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet so that the bottoms would not get soggy.  Nobody likes a soggy nugget!  They came out great.  I plan to use this recipe again tonight.  :o)
Update:  I finally tried them using the butter as the recipe calls for.  While they are healthier without the butter, they are definitely yummier with the butter!  WAY delicious!  I also used seasoned panko bread crumbs.  Not sure it really made much difference to the overall recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly.  These were delicious and a huge hit with my toddler and husband.  I turned them about 10 minutes through so they would be browned on both sides.

I often buy my boneless skinless chicken breast from the grocery store in jumbo packs.  I often have a lot of trimming to do before I freeze the chicken in meal size packages.  I usually end up with some pieces too small to be frozen with the chicken breast but large enough to keep for chicken tacos or chicken for on top of salads.  I tried this recipe instead last week and it was a winner.  They taste so good that you don't even WANT any dipping sauce to go with them.

Awesome! Try marinating in balsamic vinaigrette for a few hours (or overnight) before dipping in the breadcrumbs mixture, which eliminates the need for butter and really enhances the flavor.  I have also made 'buffalo' bites by adding some hot pepper sauce to the marinade.  These reheat very well!

Really great!  Instead of dipping it in butter, I dipped it in a mixture of 2 eggs and a little milk.  I did as another suggested and turned it on broil for a few minutes to really crisp it up.

These were pretty good! I used salt free margarine insted of butter. They were nice and quick and tasty and risped up well when I used my cooling rack on a cookie sheet. I accidently put in too much thyme so I will be more careful next time. Great for when I am craving chicken Nuggets.

I made this for my son's birthday dinner and it was well received by both my children and a visiting friend.  Much healthier than the fried version and I like using chicken breast instead of processed chicken pieces!  I did leave out the extra herbs as my son has an aversion to too many "green things" in his food and subbed garlic salt for regular salt.  I dipped in beaten eggs instead of butter.  I baked on the cookie cooling rack and they came out nice and crisp.  Next time I will try to broil for a few minutes at the end to get them a little more brown.

I needed to make something for lunch during a seminar so it had to be premade and kept cool until lunch time. I tried this recipe and it turned out great!  I had to use the butter to coat the chicken as there were no eggs left in the house and it did not seem too fattening and tasted really good.  Was please witht he flavor although I confused the amount of the Basil with the amount for the Thyme and it was really good.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!!

I took  the advice of others and used eggs instead of butter. Had no problem with the breading sticking to the chicken. I also used my cookie cooling rack so the chicken would crisp up on both sides. Worked great. I did add rosemary to the breading. For dipping sauce I used "Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken" recipe from this site. Boy was this a good dinner!

Loved this.  Made some changes to make it lower in fat - used fat free parm and milk instead of butter (per others' suggestions).  I've also substituted buffalo sauce for the butter, which adds a kick!

I love this recipe! Although the second time I made it, I used crushed tortilla chips then added a lil italian seasonings and my family just gobbled them up!

This recipe was wonderful.  My 18 month old ate every last piece we served her and wanted more when it was gone!(she usually won't eat chicken at all)  I followed a few of the changes suggested by using milk instead of the butter and using the cooling rack.  I did not flip the chicken 3/4 of the way through but I will in the future as the bottom was a little moist still.

I wonder how to keep all the breading on nuggets? My nuggets were a bit naked. Made it for picky daughter, had to make her to finish it. The rest of family liked it.

Best chicken nuggets ever!!! I used shredded parmesan since i didn't have grated and 2 beaten eggs w/ olive oil in place of butter as someone suggested. Also cooking them on a cooling rack made them crispy all around!!!

I liked them a lot, but the kids were less impressed. They like their nuggets very boring, the bland frozen kind. I keep trying to make them homemade to get them to eat a little more nutritiously, but no go. Still, I thought this recipe turned out pretty darn well.

These were great... took a little longer in the oven than what was indicated, but I think that has more to do with how big your nuggets are. I used egg instead of butter. Yum!

These were relatively time consuming for chicken nuggets!  They needed more flavoring also.  Good, but not 5 stars!

Nuggets tasted good fresh out of the oven. I flipped the nuggets halfway through cooking time in the oven, so they wouldn't get all soggy. Wouldn't say they taste as great as deep fried though (I wish). It's best to eat them on the same day, they don't taste as good after they have been refrigerated. I think next time I will replace the butter for egg and see what happens. I had trouble getting my dry ingredients to stick after the butter dip. Egg would probably make it easier.

It was a pretty good recipe with the grated parmesan crumbles.  Too bad my daughter still didn't want to eat too much of it. Used margarine instead of butter. Chicken thigh instead of breast. Garlic salt and added italian seasoning with some thyme.

Made this a couple of times now & it is ok, nothing special. I believe kids would like these & could help prepare. We dip in honey mustard that we make. Will make again as nuggets & chicken breast, just not often.

Because I made changes to the recipe, I feel it would not be fair to give this recipe less than 5 stars. I loved the flavor of the breading, and so did my children. My husband thought it was "good" but he is hard to please ;)  Changes I made: Double dredged the chicken, first in whole wheat flour, then in egg mix and then into the recipes breading mix. I did fry them instead of bake, in about 1 inch of oil, and they turned out wonderfully crunchy and the flavor was fantastic! This is a keeper, and no more processed chicken nuggets in this house!

so yummy! me and my husband liked these nuggets as much as my 3 year old! they were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. a few modifications: used plain bread crumbs and added 1 T. italian seasoning and 1 t garlic powder, used one egg beaten rather than butter, and placed the nuggets on a cooling rack in the oven as others suggested. we put the nuggests on top salad greens with carrots, cucumber, green pep, diced tomato and low fat shredded cheddar cheese. then topped it with fat free ranch and enjoyed a healthy and DELICIOUS salad!! yummy!

These were okay, but not great in my opinion.  I used saltine crackers, because that is what I had on hand and maybe this is why I didn't care for them much.  I will probably make these again, but add more seasonings.  However, I did sub an egg for the butter and it worked well.

These were good, but not a favorite for chicken nuggets.  I used whole wheat bread crumbs and used egg instead of butter.  VERY salty!  The flavor didn't really work for us as nuggets, but I'm giving it 4 stars because I think this would be a great recipe to use when making chicken Parmesan.

I'm vegetarian, but I made these for my boyfriend, and he said they were the best he's ever had! I added a spice rub that I had gotten on allrecipes to the breadcrumbs to add a little heat, which he enjoys. Thanks for the recipe!

Great kid food! This one scored an 11 outta 10 with my 2 year old! I used crushed saltines instead of breadcrumbs (was all outta crumbs!) and these were a huge hit! I also used a beaten egg (with a little water) to dip instead of butter, and they were crisp and juicy! I found 20 minutes a little long for my batch (which I cut to 1" cubes) so I shortened it to 15 minutes.

The chicken in this recipe came out very good and tender.  I used the amount conversion for 4 servings and instead of 2/3 cup butter, i used 2/3 cup 2% milk with 1 capful of vinegar, per one of the user reviews.  I also used 1 beaten egg to help the breadcrumbs stick.  I had a bit of difficulty having the breadcrumbs "stick" nicely, but it did work out.  I baked for 15 minutes, flipped the pieces then broiled for 5 minutes and it was cooked perfectly and mildly crispy.  I felt there was a bit too much salt for my taste, but I would definitely make this recipe again.

Awesome! I used the suggestions by other reviewers and dipped them in a skim milk/vinegar mixture instead of butter. We loved these! They are a great change for chicken! Also used the cookie rack suggestion, and the time was right at 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Thank you very much!

This recipe got great reviews when I made it for my sisters.  I dipped the chicken in egg instead of butter and used less cheese, but the nuggets were still great.  I'll be making them again.

Considering I used an egg wash vs the butter, I probably am doing the original author a dis-service by rating it a 4, but maybe next time, I'll sneak in a bit of butter for a few of the nuggets.  Other than that, I would reduce the amount of basil or completely eliminate it.  The rest of the mix seemed great.  Perfect for dunking in BBQ sauce, honey, or whatever you prefer...

These were good. Definitely need a dipping sauce, we used honey mustard. I could not get the parm cheese to stick to the chicken, might be because I dipped in milk and not butter, will make again and use butter

This recipe is really good.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular ones to add a little more crunch.  I also used 2 T. parsley instead of basil and thyme and had to use the whole box of panko for 3 chicken breasts.  I also let my chicken soak in low-fat buttermilk for 15 minutes prior to dredging through the breadcrumbs (I like the tanginess).  Also if you want to get the bottoms of the nuggets crispy, when they are done cooking take them out of the oven, flip them over, and turn the oven to broil.  This way the bottoms won't be soggy, while the tops are crispy.

DeLish! Very easy to make. I used a raised rack in my covection oven as noted by another user. You can modify the breadcrumbs to your own preference. Mine included some garlic powder and red pepper instead of those listed. Nice alternative to fried. I used chicken strips because I'm too lazy to cut them up!!! Just make sure they are about the same size. Baked about 20 mintues

This was tasty with sauce. Mine were a little on the dry side, but this didn't stop us from eating them. This could have been due to cooking them a little too long, although I did follow the recipe cook time & temp. I baked them on the wire rack as suggested & liked the crispiness. I also did the dipping in egg rather than butter. We enjoyed these as a healthy chicken nugget with honey mustard and ranch sauce.

I made two different pans of this recipe - one as written and one using panko breadcrumbs and egg.  We (my husband and two girls, age 5 and 4) thought that it was good and everyone ate until they were full but it wasn't a showstopper.  When asked if they would eat it again, everyone said "eh."  Thank you for the great base recipe however, I think we will play with it some more.

The flavor was good but was not quite crispy enough.  I baked them on a broiler pan and broiled the last 5 minutes or so.

These were delicious, though they didn't taste cheesy to me (I'm not sure if they were suppose to). As others suggested, I used 2 eggs instead of butter and they came out very tasty. I will definitely be making these again.

The kids really like this recipe. I would definitely say stick them under the broiler for about five minutes at the end. We also used the egg instead of the butter. I like that it is lower in fat that way, but that is probably how they got crispy.

Very good, but make sure you have a LOT of dipping sauce because the breading makes the chicken very dry tasting.

My daughter really enjoyed this recipe. I used an egg to have the mixture stick as per other reviews, and wished I had used the butter instead, it was a bit dry for my taste. Oh well, health prevails!

I was wowed by the tenderness of the chicken. My husband, who does not care for chicken, and my 2 year old loved this recipe. I added a clove of fresh garlic to the melted butter and a little cajun seasoning to the bread crumb mixture. Wonderful!!!

These were fantastic! I just used seasoned Italian breadcrumbs combined with the cheese and some black pepper. In addition, I used chicken tenders (cut in half or thirds, depending upon the length of the piece), and they were super easy. Delicious, easy to make, and quick weeknight meal!!

This recipe is fantastic.  I made only one change to make it easier.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and left out the spices.  My kids though they had a bit too much rosemary.

My daughter (who is very hard to please) had a feast with these. They were tender, flavorful, and healthy. I served them with "Chuck's Favorite Mac and Cheese" and they paired really well together. Defenitely a repeat at our home!

These came out way too salty and herb-ey.  The parmesan cheese has plenty of salt, as does the Italian breadcrumbs, so the extra addition of salt is just too much.  (I guess I really should have known that.)

My husband only ate a couple and then said, "I just don't like them."

So we're still looking for a good baked nugget recipe...

These have a good flavor.  I made some of the pieces too small and over-breaded them and they were still good.  We're going to try again and this time I know they'll be even better.  Thanks for the recipe.

Not bad, my family liked it alot the only thing is that the bread crumbs didn't want to stick to the chicken, after I baked the chicken. So they ended up as half-covered chicken nuggets. Oh well.

This recipe is wonderful and simple, an easy thing to make with ingredients I always have.  I baby-sit a 3-year-old, and he had so much fun helping prep the chicken pieces and put them on the baking sheet.  For some added fun, I used a sharp knife and made shapes out of the chicken breast - hearts, stars, circles, etc.  They baked wonderfully.

Great flavor, the only thing I changed was the butter..instead I used egg whites to dip the chicken in to try to make it a bit lower it fat. This did not seem to hurt the flavor at all. For a good low fat dip I used some salsa.

I was surprised how crisp these came out.  They were very good.  I sprayed a little cooking spray in the pan and it kinda fried the bottom, which was good I thought the bottoms would get soggy.  I left out the extra spices because my bread crumbs were flavored.  I used the kind of parm cheese that is dried and grated, not the crumbly kind.  Overall excellent, I think these could be used in a number of italian dishes too, like chicken parm or even chicken alfredo.

I liked that these nuggets were so easy to make and baked... but I didn't really like the addition of thyme. If I make these again, I'll leave that and the basil out as others have noted.

These were fantastic!!  I also added garlic powder to them.  I didn't use butter but dipped them in egg instead.  They came out great and smelled devine.  I mixed some honey mustard dressing using honey, mustard, paprika and parsley.  Yum! The kids loved them and so did the adults.

I am horrible at cooking meat!  But... this came out absolutely perfect and juicy.  I used chicken breast tenders and egg wash instead of butter.  I will now use this method from now on and am able to say I can now cook chicken perfectly.  Thank you!!!!!

This recipe is so tasty and easy. To make it a little easier - use chicken tenders so it's less cutting.

Excellent! I drizzled melted butter over mine before baking and this helped to crisp them. I made mine chicken strips instead of nuggets.  Will definitely make again.

Tasty! My parmesan cheese is a bit salty so I deleted the salt from this recipe. The kids really liked this. They decided to dip in ketchup instead of a more appropriate marinara sauce. Cooked in a convection oven for more crispiness.

Better than McDonald's any day! My daughter loves to help with the preparation and it's so easy to make! You can even use these ingredients to make with whole chicken breasts. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

These were pretty good. Very flavorful.  I was out of thyme so I substituted dried Italian Seasonings and this worked well.

If you love chicken nuggets, you might really like these.  If you're just looking for something different to do with chicken then I'd keep looking.  I probably wouldn't make them again.

Not bad for baked! They were pretty tender inside. I served with honey mustard dressing and bbq sauce for dipping.

These tasted great. Mine came out a little dry but I think I over cooked them. I really like the fact they are baked and much healthier than most other chicken nuggets.

WOW!  What a simple, fast, yet GREAT recipe!  My boyfriend LOVED it.  After reading reviews, I used Kosher salt and a little garlic powder.  I definitely will do it again for us and guests.

I made these for my kids after watching "Supersize Me" and found out how bad fast-food nuggets are. . . (YUCK) so I decided to try these and just freeze a bunch for easy dinner for the kids.  Works great.  Kids loved them- but DEFINITELY DECREASE THE SALT - cut it in half at least because it tastes WAY to salty.  Other than that, these are great.

These were good. I followed some advice of others and used chicken tenders, and also put garlic in the butter. Next time might cut down on the salt a little bit. Added black pepper and cooked 23 minutes turning once.

This was an easy recipe to make baked (instead of fried) chicken nuggets.  My family did comment, however, that they seemed a bit mushy from the butter.  This may have been due to my daughter dipping them a bit too much when making them but they did have a good flavor.  I did take the advice of others and only used half the amount of spices.

this recipe was pretty good for the kids. I used a beaten egg to dip the chicken in and decreased the spices based on the other reviewers suggestions. Very quick to make.

I liked how easy this was to make and it tasted great too.  I made a side of honey mustard to go with it and the flavors were wonderful!  I will definitely make it again!
