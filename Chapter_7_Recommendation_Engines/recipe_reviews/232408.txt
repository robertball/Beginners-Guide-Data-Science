Wow, we love this.  I used a mild curry paste, roasted the chicken and once done set it aside to rest covered with foil.  Blotted out some of the chicken fat from the pan and added tater tots to the roasting pan.  The tater tots cooked while the chicken rested and the vegetables cooked.  It was a lovely meal.

My wife and I loved this. I added curry powder to add a little heat under the skin. And small pads of butter to moisten the breast.

we just love this recipe.  It works on all cuts and types of meat.  Last night did on a pork roast.  It was tender and full of flavor but not spicy.

This was delicious and way easy! Served with couscous and roasted zucchini. No fuss dinner for family. I would definitely make this recipe again!
