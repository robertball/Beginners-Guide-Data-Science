It wasn't bad. The cookies weren't noticeable. What was noticeable was the ketchup flavor imparted by the chili sauce. I used the Heinz kind, perhaps it meant Asian chili sauce? I can see this dish being tangy with an Asian chili sauce and the gingery cookies...but as it was, it was nothing special and in fact, we can't eat the carrots because of the ketchup flavor. (Though, that isn't bothersome on the meat and potatoes as ketchup is a usual flavor there.) I probably won't make it again but I am glad I tried it, I think I'll just add ground ginger to my usual pot roast recipe to create the flavor I was imagining here. Thanks for the recipe!
