I *love* guacamole. I've made the quick and easy guac with mashed avocados and salsa, and I've made it fancy from scratch. So, please believe me when I say that this one is fabulous! I made it exactly as written. We had to stop ourselves from eating all of it and spoiling our appetite for the rest of our Cinco de Mayo meal! Savory, sweet and just plain delicious!

So delicious! Brought this to a party and everyone couldn't get enough....including the toddlers! My hubby got into it too because he got to use his manly choppin skills when we were makin it. :) I added an extra mango because it was ripe and I didn't want it to go bad and it was still really great! Thank you for the recipe!

My wonderful husband made this for a birthday/dance party we were going to.  This was a HIT!  People woofed it down.  Great mix of flavors.  Used 1 t. of salt; 1 T would have been WAY too much!  Make this NOW!

I reduced the salt to.1 teaspoon,  but otherwise followed the recipe.   This was good and a nice change from traditional guacamole.   Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Ok, I didn't measure a thing, including the avocados, but darn this was good. The mango was still a little firm, but that only added to the chunkiness.

Amazing! Only suggestion is less salt. We halved the salt and it was still too much ( and this is coming from a girl who lives salty). Wondering if maybe the recipe called for 1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp. This is delicious though. The mango really adds something special.

Made this as it was written and it's good but I felt as though it's too salty.  I'm going to the store today to buy another mango to hopefully even out the saltiness! It's still pretty good overall and would definitely make this again (just with less salt)!
