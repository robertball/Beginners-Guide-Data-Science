I really cant cook.  There I said it.  I was skeptical making this because everything else I make will sit there until I eventually throw it away or my toddler decides he'd rather eat SOME.  This cake was GONE within two days.  TWO days.  I couldn't believe it came out of my kitchen.  If you really want to show off, add a tablespoon of lemon extract, rum extract, butter extract, vanilla extract and coconut extract.  

I still can't believe this cake tasted that dayum good.

And I can't cook (which my husband reminds me of in subtle ways)

I didn't use cake flour (simply because I didn't have it.) and I used powwdered sugar instead.  I also increased the baking powder to 2 tsp and added 1 tsp of salt.  It was really moist and just perfect.

I enjoy vintage recipes and whether or not you are aware of it - this is as close as you to get to the old "one pound of all ingredients" found in old recipe books.  Thank you, Arvilla, for reminding me to make this cake once again!  Wonderful flavor.

Wonderful, it is the recipe I have been looking for, my husband does not like cakes at all ,I made him taste this cake, and since then he asks me every week to bake him a pound cake. He even takes some to work with his lunch.  My twist to this cake is that I used 1 cup of mild and 1/4 cup of fresh orange juice plus the zest on one orange. 
I sent the recipe to my friends, they all loved it, Thank you

This was one of the best pound cakes i have ever made! It was very moist and absolutely delicious. The only modification I made to it was instead of the 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon butternut flavored extract, I added 1 tablespoon of lemon extract. I will be making this cake again soon.

PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I DID WRONG. All the reviews for this pound cake say its "great", well mine did not come out too great both times I tried it..I know I had to have done something wrong.  I followed the directions and ingredients but BOTH time my cake out looking like it was not cooked in the middle, it was kinda "gelled" or "solid".  The first time it happened I thought it was because I took it out of the over a few minutes before the 80 minute instruction. The second time, I left it in about 10 minutes longer than what was instructed.  If anyone has any idea..please let me know.  I also had a temperture thing in my oven to make sure it was at 350 degrees.  This was cooked in a bundt pan both time.

Although the flavor was good...just way too much butter for me...just a matter of personal taste I am sure...there are other recipes listed that have good flavor and texture...but are not as WEIGHED down by fat.

This was a fabulous recipe. I added orange flavoring instead of butternut. And I was able to scale the recipe to fit my pan size, as pans here in Brazil don't measure the same as in the states.

I will probably use this as my basic pound cake recipe in the future, though I don't consider it fabulous.

I made this today for my mom's birthday.  I think there is too much butter/not enough flour.  The top of the cake was very buttery and looked almost deep fried, and the bottom was very firm and had a gelatinous texture.  The flavour was nice, but it was not edible  :(  Not sure what happened here.

This is the BEST pound cake that I have ever tasted.  Not too sweet just nicely fluffy.  I was able to fill a tube pan and a 9x13 pan.

This was a really good recipe. I forgot the baking powder and it still came out great. The cake was very moist and the outside was crunchy... yum.
