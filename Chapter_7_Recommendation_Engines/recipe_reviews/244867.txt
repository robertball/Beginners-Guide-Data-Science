My husband is always trying to get me to make green beans (I truly dislike them). Well not after making this recipe! I could not stop eating every last one. I can see how some would be put off by the saltiness of the soy sauce even though it's reduced sodium. I added a touch of sugar to even out the flavor. I would add a dash or two of sugar and then taste test. I halved the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  There's something addictive about this sauce!

I made the Allrecipes magazine version of this recipe which called for low-sodium soy sauce.  I'm glad I did because it was still plenty salty. My son and I thought a few dashes of sesame oil  brought out the sesame taste nicely.  Everyone enjoyed it!

I didn't have any sriracha sauce so I used Cholula Hot sauce. I LOVE fresh green beans and was looking for something different besides a little butter, salt and parmesan. This is top notch! I finally bought a bottle of sriracha just for this recipe I can hardly wait to try it again.

I made these for Thanksgiving as I loathe green bean casserole.  It was definitely a hit, with many going back for seconds.  I didn't have low sodium soy sauce so used regular.  It was a bit salty, but not a deal breaker.  Will definitely make again.

I used only half of the soy sauce initially as I thought the full amount might be too salty (even using reduced sodium soy sauce).  I did add a bit more as I felt additional flavor was needed.  The sauce tasted good before I added it to the beans, but really wasn't prominent when added to the beans.  This may be due to the reduced amount of soy sauce.  I think I would add a touch more Sriracha were I to make this again (which I probably won't).

I used frozen green beans, and omitted the sesame seeds, but otherwise made as directed. It was delicious! I will say, without the sesame seeds to toast, the onion and garlic do not need that additional cook time in the butter that was meant for toasting the sesame seeds. My first batch burned after being in the butter about 4 minutes total, so I tried again and only left it in about 2 1/2 minutes before removing from the burner.

Really great beans that I liked a lot.  Only Charlie and Jeff ate them but we didn't have enough. Next time I will make the full pound. I used frozen beans and didn't even steam them. I just stir fried them in the sauce pan.

Stir fried green beans 3-5 mins, then added garlic, green onion, chili-garlic paste, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, water and chili flakes.  Cooked until thick.

The salt was overpowering for both myself and my wife. I did use light soy sauce but if I try this  again I would consider using Tamari instead of soy sauce. Have to experiment a bit..

I had never had green beans this way and found that I liked the sauce!  Only difference is I had frozen green beans on hand, which I lightly steamed.  Served it with Perfect 10 Cod, another recipe featured in the magazine.  I will make this green beans again!

We loved this recipe. I'm not into really spicy things and was concerned with the siracha. Concern not necessary, it had a kick to it but nothing crazy. I made from the magazine and didn't have 2 lbs of green beans, just 12 oz.  bag on hand.  We decided to throw in some shrimp with it and it was awesome. Add some rice and you have complete meal. Just looking for other things to use this on now.

Delicious! I got this from a magazine and it was doubled, but it also said to use low sodium soy sauce. Otherwise it would probably be too salty. This would be great on just about any steamed vegetable.

We really liked it and plan to make again. I was surprised at how well the flavors melded together and now I want to put that sauce on other things, heck it would be delish on fish maybe... .? I do agree with the previous review that the soy sauce was strong. I'll be thinking of ways to dilute it just a little, maybe use less. Enjoyed, thank you.

This had too much soy sauce for us.  This was OK, but I would reduce the soy sauce by half in the future. I admit this could be a personal taste preference, and I know this is the first review, so I don't want to discourage others from trying, but this would need tweaking for us.
