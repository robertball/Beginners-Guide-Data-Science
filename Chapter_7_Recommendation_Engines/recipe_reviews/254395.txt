I couldn't find any Recaito or cilantro seasoning bases. I just added some mild green salsa and a bit of cilantro. It turned out pretty good but I wonder what it would taste like with the Recaito. Wish it was easier to find! 

But thanks for the plant-based protein recipe. :) I love that about this dish!

This recipe had good flavor and made a nice side dish to a spicy sandwich. I added 1 cup of water to cook the quinoa, as the OJ would not have been enough liquid by itself.
