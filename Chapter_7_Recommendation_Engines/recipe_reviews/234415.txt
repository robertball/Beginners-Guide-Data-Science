There are quite a few recipes like this circulating the web but this one was less complicated, involving less steps.  Man, was it good.  I seasoned the chicken with some garlic salt as well as the salt and pepper and  cooked it  in a combination of olive oil and butter for a little extra flavor.  One and a half teaspoons each of honey and balsamic vinegar seemed a little skimpy, so I increased that to one tablespoon each and it was just the right amount.  I combined the two before I added it to the chicken and it blended in easily.   I try to limit my carbs, so I served this with fresh green beans and sliced tomatoes but frankly, this would have been even better with some hot cooked rice.

The first time, I followed the recipe without any kind of alteration. Whereas we liked it OK, we felt there was room for improvement. First, there was not enough sauce to suit my husband. I started by saut√©ing a couple of cloves of finely minced garlic after cooking the chicken (removed chicken to a plate and kept warm while making the sauce.) I then reduced 1/4 cup dry white wine by half, and added 2 Tb of chicken stock, along with the doubled balsamic and honey. This rounded out the flavor perfectly to suit our palates. Simmered the sauce for a few minutes until it started to get a little syrupy. Added the chicken back in and folded it gently into the sauce for 2 minutes to rewarm the meat. Sprinkled liberally with a chiffonnade of fresh basil at the last minute. Served it over rice cooked in chicken stock and it was a fabulous summer dinner.  Although those steps added to the prep time, it was still pretty quick to throw together. The flavor advancement made the few extra minutes seem like a good trade-off.

I'm amazed that such a quick dish could be SO delicious! I couldn't stop eating this, and ended up stuffed!  I do have to say that this recipe would make 2 very skimpy servings.  (6 ounces of tenderloins as called for in the recipe ended up being 2 tenderloins which in my opinion is enough for one person, not two, so make more!)  The package of chicken I bought was enough to triple this recipe so I made the whole package, and I'd say that made a good amount for 3 people. I will make this often! YUM!

Lucky's Quickie Chickie Haiku: "Needed way more sauce. Barely covered the chicken. (Didn't change a thing.)" A nice and flavorful chicken, but would've greatly benefited from doubling, or tripling the honey and balsamic vinegar. I loved the basil and the simple and quick instructions, but wouldn't make again without heavily increasing (or marinating with) the sauce.

As a student, it's quick and easy to make. And cheap! I've done it with pork as well, which was also nice.

This raises the bar on a simple to make chicken dinner. I followed the recipe exactly including fresh basil which was so terrific in this dish with the honey and balsamic.  5 Stars for a simple and flavourful dish you can whip up in no time.  Thanks Lucky...I think even the Picky will love this Quickie Chickie...

A very tender tasty easy chicken meal that will go with just about anything, we all loved it. There are not many chicken recipes that I don't previously marinate my chicken, but this one doesn't need it.  I had two boneless chicken breast I cut into tenders. I don't have a scale but knew they were more than 6oz. so I used a tablespoon ea. of the honey and balsamic vinegar. I did add some minced garlic too. I recommend this for anyone looking for a quick easy meal. I served with Ann's rice pilaf and Sauteed Zucchini (Frackfamily) both on AR. Thanks Lucky you got a real keeper here.

Dear friends, please try Lucky's recipe. It is delicious! Yes, quick and oh so tasty, definitely weeknight and company worthy! I tripled the sauce so that we would have plenty to spoon over a favorite pasta, grain and legume medley that we enjoy from World Market. I also added 6 ounces of sliced crimini mushrooms to the chicken while sauteeing. Fantastic summer meal too! Thank you, Lucky Noodles!

This has been a favorite for a long time partly because it is so quick to make and makes wonderful use of my herb garden basil.  Use any cut you'd like, adjust the cooking time.  You may want to double the sauce.

Lucky this is soooo yummy! Thanks for sharing it! I baked some chicken drumsticks with just salt and pepper on them. I tripled the the sauce and just whisked it up in a bowl. In the last 10 minutes of baking the chicken I just brushed the sauce on evenly, then poured the rest over the drummies.  Topped with fresh basil once out of the oven. Soooo good, DH loved it too. I will be making again, and using the sauce to spin wings in! :)

Skipped the basil (forgot it actually), but added more ground pepper and honey. Oh my goodness it was so good. Significant other was digging in kitchen for leftovers. This will be part of our usual meals from now on. So easy!

OMG this recipe is so good! I was hesitant to try it with such simple ingredients but boy was I suprised. The chicken looks and tastes like you have been marinating it all day. Quick cooking time ensures a juicy tender result. The pairing of balsalmic vinegar and honey is magic and the basil is the perfect touch. Thank you Lucky for a truly magnificent recipe. I also seared them in a combination of butter and extra virgin olive oil. I love the color browning in butter gives the chicken.

I barely know how to cook and this was really easy to make! I wasn't sure about the sauce but it was rather pleasant - I like the subtle sweetness. I'm glad that I tried it - I'll make it again. :)

I was out of balsamic vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used fresh sage from my garden.  It was delicious!

Wanted something different and man this was it! I doubled the honey and vinegar and also added 1/2 teaspoon of onion and garlic powder. My wife and 4 year old loved it!!! We used brown rice and fresh green beans for the sides.

I saved this recipe for when fresh basil was available from my garden.  I increased the honey and balsamic to 3 tablespoons each for 1 pound of chicken tenderloins.  The result was an excellent balsamic glazed chicken and a delicious dinner!  Thank you Lucky Noodles! :)

This is a quick and flavorful dish that is perfect for those busy nights.  I used twice as much balsamic vinegar and honey because I wanted a sauce to drizzle on top of the chicken breasts which I had cut into medallions.  Thanks LN for sharing!

As promised, this was quick!  Be sure to measure everything before you start, or you will overcook!  Tasty, great for an in-a-jiffy dinners everyone needs, now and then.  I doubled the sauce, served with rice, salad, and crusty bread, and this lunch was tasty!  And, did I say, quick?  Thank you for posting, but thanks even more for sharing your zest for life and your great big smile!

Super fast and easy, I added  little garlic to the oil in the pan prior to cooking the chicken. Tasted fantastic and looks lovely with the caramelization of the balsamic with the honey in the pan providing a brownish gold marinade and intensifying the appearance of the browned chicken.

The only change I made was tripling the sauce as we had more chicken than the recipe called for. 
This recipe was loved and devoured by 2 picky kids. Huge success.

I was looking for a really quick chicken dish to take to a couple with a new baby, and this was it!  I made it exactly as is, but took the advice of some reviewers and tripled the ingredients for the sauce.  This was a very good, and quick, recipe that I will make again.  Delicious as written, but I will add some garlic next time.

Easy and delicious!  I read the reviews first and doubled the vinegar and honey and I added thyme instead of basil because that's what I had on hand.  Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe! So easy! I didn't measure the vinegar or honey. Just put enough of both in the pan with the juices to evenly coat. You could do so much with this recipe.

Loved the flavor! I adapted this to be a bashed chicken vs pan cooked and it still turned out great. This will be in my rotation for "ways to make chicken exciting on a weeknight".

Yum! I doubled the sauce and would double it again for next time. Maybe adding a corn starch slurrey to thicken the sauce. We had this with couscous and green beans but i think it wiuld be really good with rice.

This  is getting three stars because I followed the directions  exactly, it turned out well and family ate it.  Personally I did not care for this recipe.  I kept thinking of the one reviewer that said they could not stop eating this chicken.  I had no problem stopping and although it was fine, for me, it was just that.  Maybe it was the basil I didn't love,

As the other reviewers said, definitely increase the sauce. Next time I might put a little cayenne in there, too, to kick it up a bit.

This was easy to make and delicious. My whole family complemented me on the meal. I did what another reviewer did and added some chopped garlic and a little white wine to the pan after taking the chicken out, then put chicken back in after hearing that up with the balsamic and other ingredients.  Definitely triple or quadruple the recipe if you are making more chicken.  The sauce is delicious.

Good, quick dinner.  Since I used a pound of chicken, I quadrupled the sauce. It coated the chicken, but I will make a little extra next time. As suggested, I added fresh garlic to the sauce. Cooking with vinegar is a challenge for me because of it's strong flavor that is too much. It wasn't too much for this recipe

Certainly quick! Note, at the end, stir the ingredients in for a brief time as recipe states. If you were to let everything sit in the pan and continue heating, the sauce will eventually turn brown. 2nd NOTE: Definitely needs at least a tablespoon of the honey and balsamic otherwise it disappears while heating.

WOW!  I was concerned because the ‚Äúsauce‚Äù is not liquidy so I thought it would burn but it was yummy. Great basil and balsamic flavor. I put on top of plain couscous - very good, quick yet tasty dinner.

Easy to make with a great flavor. I agree that the fresh basil is the key. It would probably be ok with dried basil but its great with fresh.

This recipe was so simple to make and the flavor was terrific.   I did remove the chicken once it was cooked, added a tablespoon of butter to the pan.  Then I added the sauce, simmered until thick and added the chicken back in to coat.   Even with this step, the time it took to make this dish was fast.   I will definitely make again.

This recipe is very simple and is anyone can make it! I literally just started cooking (this is my 3rd dish ever making) and it turned out way better than expected! I did change the amount of honey and added 3 tbsp instead of the 1 1/2 that it called for and I am glad I did! I also served the chicken over whole grain rice (Uncle Bens) and they went fantastic together!

I usually don't have much luck with recipes involving balsamic vinegar. I have never found a recipe that I liked until now. I did make a couple of minor changes. Sauteed a couple of cloves of chopped garlic with the chicken. Made lots of sauce. 3 tablespoons each of the balsamic and honey. The sauce tasted quite strongly of the balsamic so I took another reviewer's tip and added a couple of tablespoons of chicken broth and that made it perfect. Will definitely be going into my dinner rotation!

This is a very decent tasting chicken - feel guilty giving it 5* as it is so easy and is quite good.  I followed recipe quite closely 'cept for the fresh basil I used dried.  I would imagine the fresh would be very appealing.  
Thanks for the great quickie chickie recipe !

This was impressively fast and easy to make, and it smelled and tasted delicious. My husband and father-in-law said it was amazing, and we had no leftovers when it was done!

Super easy and really tasty. Probably got the balance a little wrong with a little more honey than balsamic. Still tasted really good and got all thumbs up but a touch more of the sour would have made it even better I reckon.

Wow, this was fantastic. I did one small thing different, and that was to add a bit extra vinegar and then reduce it down to a glaze.

Quick and easy.  Made as written but felt the sauce needed something else to round it out.  A few drops of soy sauce did the trick. Yum!

Found this recipe years ago (first I ever cooked on All Recipes). Love it! Great for a quick meal on any weeknight. tastes like something you'd pay $10 a plate for at a restaurant.

Absolutely delicious and so flavorful!  I added minced garlic, 1/4 cup white wine and reduced to half after cooking chicken. Then added 2 TBSP chicken stock, along with 3 TBSP Balsamic and honey(I mixed together before adding to pan). Simmered for a few minutes until thickened a bit. Added chicken back into pan and gently stirred to coat chicken with sauce. Sprinkled with basil. I served it over rice cooked in chicken stock and green beans. Definitely double the honey and balsamic vinegar foe enough sauce. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe Lucky!!

I needed something quick and simple with ingredients on-hand to use up some fresh chicken breast.  This was it.  It was simple and delicious.  I didn't have quite enough honey on hand, so I put it a little brown sugar to make up the difference.  It was great served on rice..  I gave it just 4 stars because it did need way more sauce.  I had doubled the amount of sauce like others recommended, and it still needed a bit more.

I added a bit of garlic salt and "Complete Seasoning" from Badia, and it was AMAZING.  Next time I'll make more of the sauce, but I can't believe how good this was.  I also agree that fresh basil is a must if you can get it.  Definitely making this a staple.

This was great!  I used about 2 lbs of chicken and about 1/4 cup each of balsamic vinegar and honey.  That made some extra sauce, but it was good to have extra to spoon over the chicken pieces on my plate.  I want to try marinating this next time I make it to see if that gets the flavor all the way through the meat.

It sounded simple and it was. I slightly increased the sauce, but will need to increase more next time. I also marinated it for about 3 hours before cooking.  I served with parsley potatoes and steamed broccoli. There will definitely be a next time.

I was looking for something quick and easy, using ingredients I had on hand. This was wonderful! I took some suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the sauce. I also added some chicken broth and white wine. My whole family liked it, even my son who doesn't like chicken! I served it over egg noodles with some grilled veggies on the side. We will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe.

Made this tonight. After reading some other reviews I decided yo make a lot of the sauce (as I was using a lot more chicken). I added a little to much honey for my liking, but everyone else thought it was wonderful. 
Also, didn't have fresh basil (its the middle of a snow storm in Canada. not the cheapest or the most readily product to have on hand) i used dried and in my opinion it was fine. I'm sure the fresh add a nice boost of flavor, but its not the end of the world if it's dry. Just add extra to make the flavor stand out -Lanna

Didn't like this at all.  I wanted to since they are ingredients I always have on hand, and it seemed easy. There was just very little taste, and the flavors that were there did not blend well.

I used 3 cubed chicken breasts and tripled the sauce.  After browning the chicken, I deglazed the pan with some chicken stock and garlic, (didn't have any wine!), added the chicken and simmered until syrupy.  Served with a side of rice and broccoli.   Fast, easy, and delicious.

If it weren't for the high rating, I wouldn't have tried this just because of the ingredients ... I'm soooo happy people rated this because it's absolutely worth making! I used about 1¬Ω lbs of chicken breasts that I cut into strips so I approximately tripled the other ingredients. I used raw honey and yeah ... seriously, this is fantastic. Very quick; very simple; very yummy!!!

Wonderful flavor! I was afraid to try this recipe on the family--DS doesn't like balsamic vinegar, DBF doesn't like 'sweet' meat--but it turns out the combo is a hit for both of them :) I scaled the recipe to 4, which would be 12 ounces of chicken, which once weighed was 4 strips of tenderloin...that wasn't enough for the three of us! Next time I'll make a whole bunch more :) Thanks so much Lucky Noodles for sharing your recipe!

I finally got around to making this and I‚Äôm glad I did!  For about 10 ounces of chicken I doubled the sauce, which worked out very well for us.  The honey, balsamic vinegar and fresh basil are a winning combination!  I combined the honey and balsamic and then added it to the chicken and just sprinkled the basil on top when plating.  Thank you Lucky!  We‚Äôll be making this one again!

We had this recipe and the only tweak I did was leave out the salt as I have not been cooking with it for years.  Family just loved this recipe.  LOL so much that next I make it instead of 4x the amount I am going to have to do at least 10x.  Thank you LN for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I have been trying to make this for some time now and something always comes up that prevents me from it!  OMG! Lucky, these are delicious, and I made double the sauce like you had suggested to me.  I used my fresh basil from the garden and it was fabulous!  The only complaint my husband had was I didn't make enough!  Next time I will make double the amount of chicken for us.

Great! Easy and quick meal.. Followed advice of another reviewer and made more of the sauce (about 2-3tbsp each of honey and balsamic vinegar) with 1 large chicken breast cut into strips. Didn't have basil on hand, but it was still good :) Will definitely make again!

Only gave a four star, for one reason. You need to double up and double up again with the balsamic/ honey.The honey with the balsamic is a great combo. I did however, cook the chicken, put aside and than   cook the balsamic/ honey, and add in the chicken. The FRESH. Basil is a must to complement the dish. Very quick easy dish with a punch of flavor. Thank You for Sharing. A Keeper.

Flavors are great and it is really easy but wish the flavors seeped more into the chicken. Left with tasty exterior but tasteless interior. Will probably just increase the honey, balsamic, and herb to have a little extra sauce to dip the chicken into.

I certainly agree with everyone; this is delicious.  I am so glad I finally tried this recipe.  It has really been popular on here.  I did pound my tenderloins and also as Lucky suggested, I doubled the sauce.  This was so quick and simple to make.  I served it over some seasoned rice.  This will become a regular here.  Thank you Lucky for sharing this awesome recipe.

It's hard to believe that something this quick, easy and with so few ingredients could be this delicious! I made exactly according to the recipe - just doubled the sauce as others have suggested.  Fresh basil is a must!

It's good but I agree with the other reviewers. As a college student this is a way too small portion. Double the chicken and almost triple the sauce. It's something I can make for myself and is really tasty. I usually serve it on rice or noodles to help fill it in.

Wow!  This was so delicious and so simple! I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and onion powder and increased the honey and balsamic both to 1 TBSP. I used chicken breasts and served them over rice, the rice tasted great with the sauce!

I used chicken breast pieces, but other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great for something so quick and simple. The fresh basil really makes a difference.

I have been meaning to make this for a long time.  It was worth the wait.  Simple, flavorful and very satifying.  As Lucky has advised in her daily posting, I did make extra sauce and put on rice.  Wonderful recipe!

This was indeed quick - it got done before my 20 minute rice method.  Next time I think I will add the sauce a little earlier to cook it more so the flavors combine and incorporate into the chicken more.  Great recipe!

If you have fresh basil on hand please make this!  The basil, honey & balsamic were a perfect combo!  I did use boneless breast so I simmered a little longer.  Make sure you make plenty of sauce to spoon over chicken when you serve.  Simply delicious!  Thanks, LN :)

Simple yet delicious for so few ingredients. I added a bit of butter in with the olive oil. Nice way to make use of my abundance of fresh basil this year. I doubled the sauce but I'd even triple it. It was so delicious, and there would be more for potatoes and rice without skimping. Thanks for the great recipe, Lucky Noodles!

EXCELLENT!  This recipe came together so quickly and was so super yummy that I know I will be making it again and again.   I used chicken breasts which I cut into medallions because that is what I had on hand.  The only thing different I will do next time is to pound them thin so they will be more tender and soak up more of that delicious sauce.  Oh yes, and definitely make extra sauce.  It is soo good!   Thank you Lucky Noodles for sharing such an EXCELLENT recipe!!   I only wish I had tried it sooner!

I used Costco's organic chicken breasts sliced horizontally, and I always put a little butter in with the olive oil to brown just because I love the color so much.  Instead of just salt and pepper, I seasoned with Papa's Seasoning from this site, but otherwise I followed the directions.  This really fit the bill for tonight's dinner, and it was just as advertised---quick and delicious!  Thank you so very much, Lucky Noodles!

Seeing Cathy Myers post made me realize that I never rated this- although we tried it a month ago!  It is so fresh and tasty- my whole family loved it.  I will take the suggestions and definitely make more sauce!!  Thanks for sharing a nice, healthy and easy to make dish:)

Loooooooved it!  Couldn't wait until our basil was ready for the picking so that I could make this recipe.  It was worth the wait!  I had 4 boneless chicken breast that I cut in strips and tripled the sauce due to the amount of chicken I was using.  This really is a very quick and easy main dish to pull together.  We had 'My Potatoes' from AR and bruschetta using fresh basil, diced tomatoes, green onions and olive oil on toasted hot dog buns with the chicken.  Thanks, Lucky for sharing this recipe.  It really does make for a fabulous, quickie, meal!

Flavorful recipe & quick to prepare...my bf & I love this! He's more of a red meat guy, but he'll make this any night in a heartbeat. I prefer honey, he prefers molasses, but either way, it's scrumptious. We double the "sauce" to have some for dipping & to mix into our side veggies.

Really good and easy to make, had lots of fresh basil so i added a bit more. It turned out perfect, my kind of meal, quick, easy and tasty. Thank you for sharing Lucky:))

I made this again and it is a great way to use basil.
The chicken is tender and juicy. Delicious.

We loved this recipe. I doubled the basil, honey and vinegar.  Tasty and quick.  We enjoyed with buttered pasta and broccoli.

Easy weeknight meal, served with store bought refrigerated mashed potatoes and salad.  I doubled the sauce so we could drizzle some on our potatoes.  Used more honey and less balsamic instead of the 50/50 ratio, because I knew my kids would prefer it a little sweeter.  It still had a lot of balsamic flavor and they gobbled it up.  Fresh basil is a must!  Next time I might use stir fry strips instead of tenderloins, which would cut the cooking time.  Thanks for sharing :)

Made this tonight with my daughter, and it was pretty good! We doubled the recipe to feed four people. My only complaint is that it tastes almost exclusively of basil. But next time we‚Äôll just add a little less basil and it‚Äôll be perfect. Nice, easy, quick dinner for a rushed working mom.

Very good and easy. I doubled the sauce as others suggested, and I think I would have liked a little more. I added minced garlic but  otherwise made it as written and I‚Äôll certainly make this again.

Quick and easy.  Great for something in a pinch.  It's kinda small for two servings though. I cooked 1 lb of chicken and upped the balsamic and honey to 2 Tbsp each. I also used dried basil and mixed the basil, honey, and balsamic ahead of time.

Really enjoyed this! Quick and delicious! Followed another review and added chicken broth along with garlic powder and old bay seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  Tripled sauce!!!
I didn't have fresh basil but dried still worked.  Thank you for a easy and flavorful chicken dish. I served it with rice.

This was so good!  Served it with rice and fresh zucchini, and doubled the sauce, as previously suggested.  I was looking for recipes to use my garden basil, and this one is a keeper.

sooo good!  fresh basil wasn't available here this time of year but I used Gourmet Garden Basil paste in the tube in the produce section and it worked great.  What a great tasting sauce but I did triple the amount per other reviews. Awesome flavor.  Served with brown rice and broccoli.

Yes, just used regular chicken breast cut up into pieces. Not really our taste. Likely won't make it again. Have only made it once, accidentally pressed on made it multiple times as I didn't think it took the first.

My father-in-law liked it okay, but neither mys husband nor I enjoyed it. Just not a combination of seasonings/flavors we like. I don't see myself making it again unless I change some things.
