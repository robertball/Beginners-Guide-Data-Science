I first made this while recovering from a stomach bug and thought it would be easy on my system. I make it now because its just so good.

I did make this but without the bacon. Also, I don't drain the water, because it has a lot of potato flavor. I add a carton of Swanson low sodium chicken broth and , I use low fat evaporated milk . I also add a handful of grated cheddar when I serve it. My husband and I think it's great!!!

An excellent starting recipe. Good as is and or with additions like leeks or ham  even carrots if your living dangerously. I was living dangerously.

It is a good basic recipe. I made a few changes, like adding creole seasoning for a little spice. Also didn't drain all the water, and added a bit of  flour. I also chopped celery and added that. I have 3 teenagers, and a very picky 9yr old niece who ate it all  up. I will definitely make it again, only next time, I may have to make double the recipe so that I can have leftovers for lunch the next day!

I didn't read the part that said to use 20 oz. of evaporated milk, so I just used one can. The milk wasn't going to be enough. So I kept the water the potatoes were boiled in, since it had cooked down by this time anyway and added a big spoonful of flour to the milk and added it in. Now it came out perfect.
