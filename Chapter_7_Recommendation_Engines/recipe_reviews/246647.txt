This is a great marinade, it does make a lot.  I made a quarter of the recipe and it was more than enough for 3 steaks.  I think this would be excellent on chicken.

This is THE BEST marinade I have found thus far. It tenderizes so don't leave too long -- I used it with boneless skinless chicken thighs for 4-5 hours before I grilled them and the whole house raved. Definite keeper! I didn't have sherry (didn't substitute), blackbean sauce, or garlic chile paste. I'll try again with those and update this review later.

I tried this on boneless chuck short ribs, and it was very good.  I didn't change a thing, and I marinated overnight.  I have quite a bit of the marinade left, so I'll try it on chicken tomorrow.  I did not discard the used marinade for the ribs, and I simmered it for a few minutes on the stove until it reduced to about one half.  Then I drizzled it on the meat and grilled veggies for serving.

We really enjoyed this marinade and is so close to the one at our speciality grocery store.  From now on I will be making it instead of buying it.  I used it on beef kabobs.

Sooooo good as is. Tastes just like my local butcher's marinade.
