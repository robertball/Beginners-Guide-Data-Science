This was quick and easy.  I did make a few changesâ€¦ I used tortilla chips instead of taco shells and I also use a homemade taco seasoning.  I dipped my tilapia in flour, then egg before I coated it with the chip and seasoning mixture.  It makes a better crust that way.  I also topped my taco with fresh sliced avocado, tomato and red cabbage (the tacos needed a little color).

just made this. is easy, fast & very yummy. no fat, just fish, no fishy taste or smell. my husband who isnt a big fan of fish like this so much. said is a keeper. so into the box it went. i think that any type of fish can be used. side note-i used my own homemade taco seasoning.

Loved this recipe.  I would spray the foil as my tacos stuck.  I used salmon and the lime tortilla chips.  Very good.  Cooking time was good.  I put homemade guacamole, lettuce, tomato, mozzarella cheese and onion in my taco.  Very good.  Served it with Mexican rice.  Will make this again.  Thanks for the idea.

I made fish tacos one time prior to this and the kids love this version better. I used tilapia and my 5 y.o. Niece thought it was chicken. I took another viewers recommendation and dredged it in egg and flour before encrusting it w the tortilla chips. I added salsa w the sour cream. U can eat it as a taco or pile toppings on top (I did) and eat by it self. Kids are asking me to make again soon and I will.

This made some great fish tacos.  For the 2lbs of Tilapia we had, probably used close to 2 TABLEspoons of (homemade/not salty) taco seasoning.  We don't like the packaged taco seasonings, as they are usually MUCH too salty for our taste.  For the coating, used a mixture of crushed tortilla and Dorito chips (had on hand/needed to use up).  We did need to dip the fish strips in beaten egg first to get the crushed chips to stick; our fish was not wet enough on its own to get the crumbs to stick.

I just made these, very good. Need to figure a better coating process, egg batter, water, milk, just to make the taco chips stick to the fish.

Roommate and I love this--we made a couple changes though. We used an egg wash to make the crumbs stick to the fish, and we use Cool Ranch Doritos to coat (we found the taco shells and seasoning a little bland). Great recipe!

Yummy!  I think it might be a bit better if the fish was fried but this was healthier & very good. I used crushed tortilla chips & make a garlic/dill aoli as a topper, serving with shredded lettuce & tomato. Definitely a keeper.

Pretty good recipe, I loved the crunch. I used cod and regular salsa. The only thing I thought was the fish was a little bland. Next time I will add more seasoning.

Very simple! Best of all, this recipe allows you just how simple baked fish tacos can be and allows you to tweak and make it yours. For my first try I covered the fish with flour, dipped it in egg and used crushed tortilla chips for the crust. I chopped onions, tomatoes, used queso fresco for the cheese and cilantro wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.

It was okay but the taco shells and taco seasoning mix completely overwhelmed the flavor of the fish.

This was a great easy and fast recipe. The only I would do differently was to spray the foil with Pam or something to the equivalent. The pieces of fish stuck to the foil making it hard to turn them.

This recipe is super simple and can be easily altered to use whatever you may have on hand as far as coating goes (left over tortilla chips, taco shells, etc).  I dredged the fish in flour and then in egg before coating in the crushed shells.  It makes for a super crunchy coating.

Quick and easy. Used homemade pico for fresher flavor and substituted Tostitos "hint of lime" chips instead of the crushed tacos.

This is a keeper! I used tortilla chips instead of the taco shells, didn't have any so that was my go to choice and worked great! Avacado and onions and whatever else you prefer is delicious with this recipe!

I also used tortilla chips instead of taco shells and a homemade taco seasoning. Added Cheddar cheese, onions, and all the other Taco fixings. The family loved them. Went great with home fries.

i did make a couple of changes because i used what was handy. I crushed a bag of Nacho flavored corn chips and very lightly buttered the foil. It was delicious !! I will make this recipe again.

not very crispy or crunchy. hard to get an even coating without some kind of oil or batter.  I even used the dorito taco shells to try to spice it up a bit, but ended up being a bit bland.

My son loved it! I used sole, dried it, then put a squirt of lime and a shake of chili powder before coating in the crumb mixture.  Next time I'll make sure to remember to flip them (or better yet put them on rack) so they're not soggy on one side.

I used tortilla chips & spicy taco seasoning. Ironically it was a bit bland. I won't make it again. I'll stick with "Parmesan Crusted Tilapia Fillets"

I did dip the fish in egg whites before putting the coating on. These tacos were absolutely scrumptious.  Added coleslaw as one of our toppings. Yum.
