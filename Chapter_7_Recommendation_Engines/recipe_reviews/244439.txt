Very good, easy way to cook chicken. I used Worcestershire sauce, instead of soy sauce. The chicken came out very moist & falling apart.

I also used Worcestershire sauce in lieu of soya, started on high (which I found gave a browning effect) then back to slow. The outcome was incredible. Such an easy recipe  (even for me)!!!

The chicken was moist, but I didn't get any flavor from the soy sauce.

Excellent.  I note that Iâ€™m not a big salt eater and soy sauce is naturally salty.  Nevertheless, it was fantastic.  I balanced the flavor with roasted cabbage and potatoe salad and it was a perfect blend! Highly recommended!

This was so simple and delicious!!! The Perdue chicken I cooked was a little bit larger than 3 pounds; so I did the math and cooked it longer. This is a succulent time saver. It was also fresher and cheaper than buying frozen tenderloins for recipes.

Ah This has  I have tried on all recipes and I have tried many many I don't understand why it has to have a bone in chicken especially with the fatty Parts on it I had to continuously pick out bones before I could serve it and the hunks of fat and skin we're not worth it and dishing it up it was so dry that I had to add more shots I won't do this one ever again

After 5 hours in the slow cooker, the chicken was dry and way too salty (soy sauce).
