These three ingredients fit perfectly together. This is a simple appetiser to put together and during the hot summer is refreshing as much as it is beautiful. As written in the description, I served mine cold meaning uncooked after being refrigerated of a bit. This goes perfectly with a nice cool, crisp white wine. Definitely use a prosciutto crudo that is "dolce" (sweet) versus the more flavourful options. I used San Daniele but think Parma would be even better. Anything too savoury will take away from the delicate flavour of the figs, no matter how sweet. Thank you for your recipe Stacey08!

I have a fig tree and chose perfectly ripe figs so they would be sweet and not  too firm, then prepared the dish as directed, serving it hot.  My husband was skeptical initially about the goat cheese but ended up loving the flavor.

Quick, easy, & delicious! I used bacon instead of prosciutto... a good substitute & always on hand! Pitted dates would work in place of figs also. My husband loved it too... it reminded him of a dish served at our local tapas bar.
