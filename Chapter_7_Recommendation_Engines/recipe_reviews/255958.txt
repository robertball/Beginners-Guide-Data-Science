These chicken tenders tasted ok. They are definitely healthier than the fried ones or even the baked ones using melted butter, olive oil or mayo as part of the breading process. I was hoping to taste the pecans, but the taste of the crackers was predominant. Also, despite the spices added to the pecans/crackers mix, the chicken was still little bland for me. I did cut the cayenne by half because of the kids, but the whole amount would have just made the chicken spicier, not more flavorful. Last, I want to mention that the oven temperature and the baking time were the right combination and  the spraying of the chicken with Pam seemed to help the breading stay compact. I will be using this "trick" when ever I bake breaded chicken or fish. If I make this recipe in the future, I will season the chicken 1st and use more pecan and less crackers.

I gave it 4 stars because i couldn't rate it 4.5. Will definitely make it again. Next time I will add a tablespoon of maple syrup to the egg whites and use a little less cayenne pepper and saltine crackers.

We substituted Ritz crackers for the saltines.  It was delicious. Next time I will use more nuts than crackers.

My husband and I really liked this new chicken dish. The toasted pecans make for a delicious flavor. We'll have this again and again!
