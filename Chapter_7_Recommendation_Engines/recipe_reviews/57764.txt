Absolutely loved this!!!! Served with buttered fettucini pasta. Great flavor. Only addition was some salted butter when sauteeing the chicken breasts. I did flatten the breasts so they would be thinner and cook quicker.

Really easy to make and my wife loves it. I use 1/2 black olives and 1/2 green olives for a change. I add the tomoates close to finishing the dish. I just don't like them to be mushy. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Once again, the flavors and ingredients I'm familiar with and love.  There are just not enough occasions to use the combination of rosemary, garlic, white wine and olive oil.  But it was the addition of the fresh tomatoes and black olives with the chicken that was a little different and I loved it too! The color contrast, in particular, was striking and they contributed  a great deal of flavor.  Please watch cooking time - if you want moist, fork tender chicken, the time directed is a tad long - about 5 minutes too long!  I dusted the chicken in flour before sauteing, then, once the chicken was cooked through and the wine had reduced, I removed it from the heat and swirled in a couple pats of butter for a rich, velvety sauce. Served with a little pasta, this was just excellent.  Note:  By all means, use the garlic to taste - 6 cloves for two chicken breast halves is a tad much.  Depending on their size of course, two cloves should do it.

The ingredients look great. However, when it is cooked the chicken is dried out with no flavor.  Recipe should be adjusted or I cooked it wrong. Heating the chicken on both sides before adding the spices may have sealed them out.

This is a great dish to make on busy weeknights. I use less olive oil (about 1/3 less) than recipe calls for to reduce total fat. I also use pitted kalamata olives instead of black, and I use halved grape tomatoes in place of plum. The color contrast is greater and the shape holds up better.

This was okay but nothing stellar.  I found that it used way too much rosemary, and I'm a big fan of rosemary!  I sauteed some thinly sliced onion along with the chicken and it seemed to compliment the flavour well.

Came out great!   Cut chicken into 1 inch pieces and coated in seasoned flour so gravy came out thickened.  Also subbed some capers for some olives.  Served over brown rice/quinoa mix.
