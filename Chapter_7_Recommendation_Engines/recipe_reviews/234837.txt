Good recipe, however, a crucial step is missing, which is why some people ended up with sweet scrambled eggs. I'll explain how to prevent that.

Instead of mixing all the ingredients together at the same time, what you should do is beat the eggs to an even consistency in a mixing bowl, then add in the sugar, mixing well.

Then, heat the milk and vanilla in a pan over low to medium heat just until it starts to simmer. (I also added a splash of Grand Marnier but this is optional) Turn off the heat.

Add a little bit of milk (~2 tbsp at a time) to the eggs, mixing very well before adding the next dose of milk. Do this with about half the milk, and then add the rest of the milk in all at once and stir well. What this does is heat-proofs the eggs, so it'll prevent them from turning into scrambled eggs and you'll have a creamy consistency at the end of all this.

After that, add your salt, stir, and then pour into your baking dish, sprinkle with nutmeg, put in the water-pan, and cook at 325 F for an hour, or until nice and set!

I lost my custard recipe and am now making it again with regularity.  All those other recipes say scald the milk, stir constantly and pour slowly into egg mixture yadda, yadda...........so not necessary.  I don't ever remember  doing that and I made custard for years when the kids were kids.  This recipe is simple, easy and never fails.  Can pop the whole thing, pan, water and all in 5 minutes.  Now THAT'S a quick dessert.

Easy and straightforward, this makes the traditional egg custard.  The baking time was longer than mentioned in the recipe for me, and that may be because of my oven, so be sure to check the consistency before removing it from the oven.

I followed the directions exactly and somehow this turned out terrible. The consistency resembled scrambled eggs and it was incredibly soggy. We had to stick it in a strainer before eating. Won't be using this recipe again.

I've been wanting this for sometime. My mother use to make this. It was so easy an fast to make. The only thing I did different was cook it 10 minutes longer. At the specified time a toothpick test said cook longer lol. Ovens vary. The person that gave you the bad review obviously didn't know that and probably has a hard time cooking instant oatmeal ! Also I doubled the recipe. It is delicious. I let it cool to almost room temp then refrigerate till good an cold. Thanks for a great old time recipe !

quick and easy. I cut back on the sugar and I still found it too sweet. I might only use half the amount stated here next time (I don't have a sweet tooth.)  I steamed this instead of baking it to cut down on cooking time. Steaming took 15 min, low to mid fire.  Don't be too generous with the cheap vanilla extract, if you are like me, using the cheap ones. I added only 2 drops and didn't like the chemical taste. I might leave it out altogether next time. I used ramekins and 2 eggs yielded 4 servings.

This is my 2nd time making this recipe.  In both instances, I added extra eggs to reduce the watery stuff at the bottom.  It could probably use more eggs yet -- probably double the recipe's recommendation.  

I made a triple batch on both occasions.  I didn't set it in water -- just put the whole batch in a casserole dish and baked at 300 degrees for a longer time (no fuss, no muss).  

Also, both batches came out too sweet for my taste.  I reduced the sugar by 25% in the 2nd iteration and still found it too sweet.  May need to reduce sugar by 50% to make it even less sweet.

I like to have this for breakfast with some fruit compote (simmered cherries, raspberries and blueberries with canned mandarins), which I make ahead in big batches too.  

I like the protein it provides, especially if I can find the right sugar ratio, so it's not a carb overload  first thing in the morning.

This is so easy, I thought there had to be a catch - it wouldn't be the old fashioned egg custard I wanted. Nope, no catch, it was the *perfect* egg custard I hoped for. I will make this again and again! I may experiment with the extra egg and some cinnamon as another reviewer suggested. 

I don't know how you could possibly screw up this recipe. "Scrambled eggs" you say? You didn't wisk  it long enough I suspect,  and I also suspect you used a fork. There is no way it is "scrambled eggs" if you did exactly as recipe is written. 

This is the best light dessert, not too much sugar, and you get protein too! What's not to love?

I made with 3 whole eggs and 1 extra yolk. Many reviews said it was too sweet so I was very close to reducing the sugar and I'm so glad I didn't! It wasn't sweet enough for me so in the future I'll increase the sugar. I had no problem like some reviewers with scrambled eggs, I used my Cuisinart mixing stick which I mixed for 1 minute. The entire dessert took 5 minutes to make and was delish! I'll definitely make again.
Edit. I made it again today since the first batch lasted 1 day. I used 5 whole eggs, 2 egg yolks, 3 C milk, 1 C sugar, 6 packets of Splenda, 1 Tbls pure vanilla (if you're using the cheap stuff don't add too much). I baked for 1 hour in ramekins on water bath. It came out perfect! Do NOT skip the water bath. Custards need this step! I rated the original recipe 4 stars bcuz of not enough eggs or sugar. With my adjustments I give it 5 stars.

I was surprised how easy this was to make. The cooking time should be 1 hour and 20 minutes. It was still too liquid at 1 hour. (My oven is very accurate) My guests loved it with mixed berries and a bit of whipped  cream on top.

My grandmother and aunt used to make this all the time growing up, but they made it from memory and never bothered to write it down, so when I asked for the recipe my aunt said it was very easy but couldn't remember the ratio of egg to milk. Needless to say I was relieved to find this recipe. I mostly followed the recipe except that my grandmother baked with rose water all the time, so I added a bit of that with the vanilla and I also added cinnamon to the nutmeg in very small amounts for the topping. It was a hit.

I loved this! Just like my mom used to make when I was sick. I made this a second time with an extra egg to help it set better - and almond extract instead of vanilla with a touch of cinnamon, Yum!

Love this recipe! I have made it several times. The only change I made was to use 3 eggs instead of 2 (our hens lay small eggs). I use a stick blender to mix everything together before pouring it into the ramekins. Be careful not over cook it or, yes, your custard will come out looking like scrambled eggs.

Make this routinely.  It's packed with protein and satisfies my sweet tooth.  I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and you can't tell.

Made as written (twice). Making a double batch now and can't wait. The kids LOVE it! Plus I've found that using powdered milk (made as directed) works great- I always have some in the cabinet so we can make this anytime!

I’m sorry to say that this recipe simply is wrong. It will give you sweet scrambled eggs. I have no idea why it is still included. The fixes: (1) heat the milk to just until the edges start to bubble, then add to the egg-and-sugar-and-vanilla mixture (previously whisked for 45 seconds) one tablespoon at a time until half the milk has been added, whisking constantly, then add the rest, and (2) check at 45 minutes until a knife comes out clean.

First time I made it and or tasted custard and everyone liked it. I will suggest what not to do. Don't use cupcake paper... they will become soggy paper.  Use boiling hot water for hot water bath or place water bath in oven for a few minutes prior to placing cups in it. Don't be too close to oven when you open door as boiling hot steam will meet your face.  It will have a slight egg flavor but not too heavily. It doesn't rise, so fill to near the top.

I did not have individual cups, so made it in a larger 1.5 qt casserole dish.  There was a layer of liquid under the custard, which was like whey. I will get a set of cups and try again. I was able to save this batch by using a slotted spoon. It is a bit sweet, so may think about reducing the sugar.

I have made this twice...once exactly by the recipe and once based on the suggestions of the reviewers.  Here are the results:

Exactly by the recipe:  This is definitely the way to go for maximum flavor and texture.  It came out perfectly.  It was pretty sweet, so reducing the sugar by about 1/4th may be the way I try it next time.  

Used reviewers suggestions : I added an extra egg and decreased the sugar by half.  It didn't really taste like anything and the texture was too egg-y.

I followed this recipe pretty much as it is.  Maybe a bit less sugar and I added an extra egg yolk for richness.  I was also out of vanilla so I used a dash of almond extract.  I used five ramekins and it was divided perfectly, as I like the dishes full.  The texture was perfect! Easiest custard recipe ever!! No problems with eggs "scrambling"....just gotta make sure you wisk the heck out of it.

Simple but perfect. I did have to bake it a little longer (10-15 min) but I generally use larger ramekins and I live at high altitude and I have an old oven so these things could affect this.

Easy & delicious! I doubled the recipe and added extra eggs (6 total because I wanted to use them up) and substituted jaggery for the white sugar because I didn't have whit sugar. I also baked it 1/2 hour longer. My family loved it!

I quadrupled the batch so I have to cook it for 2 hours. I added clove and cinnamon as well. It's super delicious!

Too sweet and poor texture, baked at too high a temperature for too long.  I'm trying a 2nd time, adding vanilla extract, reducing the sugar to 1/3 c., scalding milk prior to whisking into eggs, and baking in water bath at 300F for 30 minutes.

Made this per the instructions and ended up with sweet, watery scrambled eggs. A few other reviews had some good tips so read thru. I'm sure it would taste great if there were a few tricks shared.

Very poor recipe. Should have about 4eggs not two. The custard it produces is very sweet and floats on top of watery syroup
And the lower legal of the custard does have a cottage cheese look to it...easy but not great...

Very simple and turns out fine (especially if you have an immersion blender).  FYI, custard curdles ("turned out like scrambled eggs") if your oven is too hot, you overbake it, and it goes > 180; shoot for 165.

Terrible recipe.  Needs more eggs, less sugar, and scaled milk. I followed the recipe but it came out watery  looking custard.  I’ll go back to my old Betty Crocker Recipe which is so much better.  Simple and easy doesn’t always make for a good product.

As always, I added my own twist. The eggs seemed a bit small (large eggs aren’t that large these days) so I used three and I used 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream to 1.5 cups 2% Lactose free milk. I used the cap on the pure vanilla extract to measure 1 capful.  Apart from that, I followed the recipe and sprinkled ground nutmeg on top. It made just four custard bowls but I guess you could stretch it for six people if you had to.  Absolutely delicious,  but it could perhaps have used a little longer in the oven to set the middle a little more. I will be making this again, but a larger batch.

My custard came out great. I didnt add nutmeg, instead a bit of cinnamon. Next i will add a little more vanilla we used the imitation kind the reg vanilla extract was too expensive for an ingredient ill rarely use.

Made it but I didn't want a multitude of custard cups in the fridge so I baked it in a single small bowl which had a clip-on lid. I didn't warm the milk which may have caused me to extend the baking time but it still turned out fine. Consistency was like pudding. I may try it warming the milk and using less to thicken it next time.

I followed the recommendations of another of warming the milk alone first(almost scalding it) and then add milk to the egg and sugar mixture.  I also added vanilla bean to the milk while it was warming.  When I put  the ramikins in the oven, I added a little bit of water to the sheet pan so they baked in a water bath.

Such comfort food, and so easy!  I added a little more in the way of spices, but aside from that, followed exactly.  Sweet, warm and creamy!  And I used 2% milk too.

Just made it for the 2nd time and added a pinch of corn starch while whisking.  Another change was to bake it in a 8x8 glass pan.  Even better if I say so myself!

This is the best egg custard. Add more eggs if desired, but it's not necessary. I make it all the time. It's so good. Fresh fruit can be used to top it, whipped cream also can be used to top it. Simply the best egg custard around.

I used to make egg custard from a mix - and can't find it anymore.  Now I wonder why I ever did... it's incredibly easy and comes out great.  I didn't change a thing, and I did use the little sprinkle of nutmeg on top.  Made with 2% milk, it's also not heavy on fat.  Note to self - 6 custard cups fit easily in my blue glass 9 x 13 pan.

Cut down on the sugar - used 1/3 cup rather than 1/2 cup.  May cut it down a little more next time.

Its hard to say where this went wrong for me. I really appricate actual measurements rather than just a dash or a pinch of something. How hard is it to just measure what you need?

Easy and versatile; no whisk? use a mixer or blender. In my oven with oven thermometer it takes 1:05-10. I leave out the nutmeg as it tends to collect at the edges and burn, but I do sprinkle it on top right out of the oven. Also, 2% milk works great. I prefer brown sugar and currently have some in the oven using stevia. A great basic recipe that's easy to experiment with.
For evenness, I whisk the eggs and vanilla first, then add sugar, salt, whisk some more, then slowly add milk as I whisk.

Made this twice now. The first time I cooked too long - I expected it to firm up more in the oven. Second time by the recipe - 1 hour. Much better. Great with ginger snap cookies!

You definitely have to whip this with a mixer (it would take too long by hand). If it's thoroughly mixed though, it comes out perfect! I made it in a large dish instead of small ramekins so the cooking time changed, but still easy to make!

Made at the request of my husband, since he can no longer find the Jello custard mixes. I added an extra egg, but otherwise followed the recipe ( I did cook for 70 minutes). He said it tasted exactly like the custard his mom used to make :)

I added four eggs instead of two.  Then, when the custard were nearly cooked, I added sugar to the tops and put them under the broiler.  They turned out nicely.

I made the custard according to the recipe which was very easy.  I couldn't take pictures-my sons devoured it BEFORE I was able to try it.  By the way, I'm in Miami, and the grocery store by my house has  a shortage of eggs, so I have to wait until stock is replenished.  Thanks for the recipe!

I replaced nutmeg with pumpkin spice. I put mine in the freezer and then defrosted it for a nice frozen egg custard. It was icy but still very delicious. I put mine in silicon cupcake containers so it slid out nicely.

This was great and so easy! Mine needed more time, too, even though I used 2C custard dishes so it was shallower than using the standard 1C dishes. Other than that I made it just as directed. I was surpised, since I've only ever made custard the standard way by cooking the milk first. I devoured mine and could eat 10 more. Guess I'd better make some more.

I didn't have enough white sugar so I substituted with an equal proportion of brown sugar.  The molasses in the brown sugar gave it a wonderful color and flavor.  I also heated the milk as one of the other reviewers suggested and mixed it with the brown sugar first to dissolve.  I also used a whisk and beat the eggs separately before adding the milk to them a little at a time after it had cooled a bit.  I divided into four small coffee mugs and baked it an additional 10 minutes and then let it sit in the hot water bath another 10 minutes before removing the cups to cool on a wire rack.

This is great!  I made it diet friendly both low carb and sugar free using Splenda as the sugar (increasing it to 1.5 cups), coconut almond milk, heavy cream and half and half and used 3 eggs (its what I had left)plus an additional 1/4 cup heavy cream.  I also threw in a half package of unsweetened coconut then topped it with pumpkin pie spice.  The recipe is solid and perfect for converting to diet friendly.  Please don't go with the changes because I used this recipe as a way to use up some ingredients and it still turned out awesome.

This is a quick and easy dessert and great served warm or cold.  I served it chilled with fresh berries and some whipped topping.  And I didn't feel guilty about having dessert!

So easy and good. The first time I made it I liked it but I could taste a hint of eggs, which I wasn't fond of (but can't complain because it is EGG custard). So the second time, I added a little more sugar and an extra dash of vanilla and I loved it. Just tasted like a sweet, refreshing custard, no egg. I served it with strawberries and graham crackers. Great simple recipe!

I made it and it came out perfect but the one thing that i did differently was i beat the eggs first made in a cupcake tray and baked 30 minutes longer! Yummy i will definitely make again soon!

I couldn't find small custard bowls so I ended up using cereal bowl sized Pyrex... they had to stay in the oven an extra 20 - 25 mins but other than that quick'n'easy, thanks!

Amazing recipe! I tried it and it turned out perfect. Tastes like something you can have at a nice restaurant. I added half cup condensed milk and one and half cup milk instead plus replaced some sugar with honey for my little one. Definitely going in my favorites box

I added two more eggs(mine were on the small side) and a pinch more salt, I used four 8oz ramekins to bake them in with a small cake pan as the water reservoir. Good for dry run now time to add the fun stuff!

This was very nice. I followed the recipe and let it cool and then served it with whipped cream and some berries on top. It wasn't fancy, but that's just what I was looking for.
