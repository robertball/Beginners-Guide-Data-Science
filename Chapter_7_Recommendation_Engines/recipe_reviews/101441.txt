This was pretty tasty.  I'm only giving it 4 stars cause it took a while to get the kabobs together, but that's with any kabobs you make.  Make use you don't over steam the potatoes, I did and some fell over while cooking.  I marinade the steak alittle long.  I think next time, I will make the potatoes and throw those in the marinade along with the veggies.  Cause it was a pain to base
