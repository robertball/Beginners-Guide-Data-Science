This dish absolutely had no flavor despite the loads of spices I attempted to flavor it with. Will not be making this dish again.

Wow, this really tasted great!  I used sliced turkey sausage and left out the milk, but other than that made the recipe as written.  I wouldn't change a thing if I were to make it again.

Yummy change of pace.  I didn't have Condensed Cheddar Cheese soup on hand so I substituted 2 cups of shredded mild cheddar cheese instead. I know it's a Campbell's recipe but I'd rather use fresh ingredients and I suspect it helped with the flavor a bit.  I also used regular pork sausage and added a dash of oregano.  Served with a bit of shredded parmesan cheese.  Turned out well this way and I will be making it again!

This is a tasty super easy recipe to make, The cheese soup is kinda bland, but throw in a couple of ounces of velveeta and it becomes real cheesy. I also put some grated parmesean on top. I'm gonna experiment with this one...

This recipe was a hit in our house hold, i added a extra can of the cheddar cheese soup to make more sauce. I will definitely make this one again, even my Fiancee who can be fussy at times liked it.

It wasnt too bad.  I threw in some browned chikcen as well as the sausage.  My family wasnt wild about the sausage.  They pushed it aside but really liked the chicken.  The cheesey sauce was really good.  I will make again and just use chicken cut into bit sized cubes.

My family loves this dish, but I also add an additional can of Fiesta Cheddar Cheese soup to make it a little creamier.

This was very easy and pretty tasty.  After reading some of the other reviews I was concerned it could be bland, so I added a can of Rotel.  I would do the same if I make it again, as I think it was probably an improvement.  I might take the suggestion of another reviewer and throw in some cubes of Velveeta -- I never use it, but the cheese sauce could use a bit more "tang."  My family loved this.

Next time I will make this with hot italian sausage!   It was a split vote on this recipe, I thought it was ok but my boyfriend loved it.  I made it with red pepper because we prefer them over green.  We both thought it would be best to try with hot italian sausage next time.

I thought the cheese sauce was bland.  I will probably heat up the leftovers with some velveeta to add flavor.  My husband said it was okay but I don't think I would make again.

My husband loved this ! I did make a couple of changes, instead of milk I used chicken broth to add flavour , I added some heavy cream about 1/4cup and added about 2 tsp of Epicure brand Bacon,Cheese and chive seasoning, topped it off with fresh Parmesan to each serving, delicious.

A nice pairing of flavor. I was looking for a Pork Dish and found this Sausage Dish.  I was really hoping I had Campbell's Canned Cheese but alas, I did not. So I substituted with shredded cheddar and a marinated pork chop. I added a step by throwing in some bacon pieces in the pan before the onion, green pepper and garlic. Added the milk and shredded cheddar, slice my pork and then combined in skillet. I will be making this again, always with a touch of bacon ;-)
