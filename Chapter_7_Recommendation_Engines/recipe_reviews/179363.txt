I used a small pyrex dish instead of a pie plate. Also I upped the apples to 4 cups. Everyone loved it! It's more of a custard or buckle then a pie. I've already been asked to pass on the recipe!

My husband made this and followed the recipe exactly.  It was really good, but I wouldn't call it a pie.  It did have a somewhat custard like texture and taste when warm out of the oven, like some other reviews mentioned.  However, when it cooled, I thought it was most like what I would call a coffee cake. I will make this recipe (or my husband will) again.

This was really good.  I reduced the sugar which I usually do for apple pie recipes but I wouldnt recomend that because it tasted a little salty.  It must be from the bisquick because I didnt add salt. Next time I will use 4 cups of apples like someone else did.

I've only made this once so far, and to be honest it looked really wierd going into the oven.  I wasn't going to bake it.  But it came out great, and was delicious!

I liked it, was out of nutmeg, but not noticeable in the recipe.  I will add more apples next time, seems like the bisquick took the consistency away from the apples in the pie.  When you pour it in the pie pan, looks like you don't have much there, but the bisquick fills the pan and you have a nice filled pie. Tasty!

Almost all of the "impossibley easy" bisquick recipes are hard to beat.  Quick, tasty and good.  When you are pressed for time, these are great.  I always mix up the liquid ingredients in the blender, or use your hand blender.

My family loved this recipe.  I didn't have Bisquick so used self raising flour for the pie and plain wholemeal flour for the topping.  Also used a can of apple pie filling instead of actual apples. Quick and easy to make and the end result was delish!

This is a great recipe if you just want to do something quick and easy.  It came out much better than I thought it would and was delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.
