Delicious and "guilt-free"!  I used fat free vanilla yogurt and used wheat germ instead of granola.

Very good!  You can easily change up the flavor of the yogurt and the fruit.  I made this using lemon yogurt and blueberries.  My intention was to serve this for dessert, but we were too full, so Hubs had one for breakfast the next day and another the day after that.  The first time he said the granola maintained it’s crunch, but the next day it wasn’t as crisp.  So I would say making this one day ahead is fine, but not two days ahead.   This is a nice, light dessert or breakfast!

What a delicious, healthy and easy snack this was for me! I used Quaker Natural Granola (oats, honey & raisins) alternatively with fresh blueberries, raspberries and low-fat Vanilla yogurt. It was just way TOO hot, humid and sticky to cook dinner on a stove tonight. This was perfect as it filled me up and left me feeling "guilt-free"!

These were delicious! I didn't have the fresh berries, so I microwaved (to thaw) about 2/3 cup of frozen strawberries for 1 minute on high. I mixed those with a freshly cut peach.  P.S. I made my own granola by sprinkling oil on it, drizzling honey on it, and then toasting it in a toaster oven for 3 minutes. Stir about once every minute-otherwise it will burn. :-)

My kids really liked this. I used homemade low-sugar granola and FF yogurt. My kids thought they were having dessert for breakfast and that I was "the bestest mom ever."

FANTASTIC. Love it. I used all different kinds of berries, including strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. I served it in a margarita glass. The ladies that came to brunch thought they were in a fancy restaurant!

Such an easy and delicious recipe. I live in the Chicago area and used Milk and Honey brand granola and this made the perfect breakfast! I would recommend for a quick desert, breakfast or snack.

Excellent quick and easy breakfast! I used blackberries and raspberries but found the seeds to be a little annoying. A little dob of whipped cream on the top and this was a great light dish.

These were so good.  I made my own granola.  My kids helped put the parfaits together and they loved it.  There's no need to add any sugar to the berries.  These can be assembled and hold up pretty well in the fridge for a couple of hours in the event you are doing a brunch and need to make other things.  Will make again !

Easy, pretty and good. Good for you is an added bonus.  Would be good with any kind of berries.
