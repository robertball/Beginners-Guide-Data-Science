I made this cake for my dad for Father's Day, and it was great. The only changes I made were to add a little more chocolate and I took it out of the oven after about 20 min. I am definitely not a great cake baker, and this cake still received rave reviews from the fam. Thank you for the post!

I am a chocolate lover. That being said, this was not chocolatey enough for me. I was going to frost it with Rick's Buttercream but with the lack of chocolate, I changed direction and put a french silk frosting on it. I also think the method was a bit off and I should have followed my own instincts. The fats should be creamed and then the dry and the buttermilk should be added alternately till blended. The resulting chocolate cake was pale and looked like a beige colored cake. I think it needed 1 more oz of chocolate too. Thanks for sharing.

Made this for Christmas dinner. Moist and delicious! I thought the directions were a bit off too, but I figured it out. Didn't have quite enough coconut - maybe 3/4 cup, which was  plenty - but it came out very well. I tossed in a little more chocolate because we're a family of chocoholics and frosted it with chocolate buttercream. Will make this again!
