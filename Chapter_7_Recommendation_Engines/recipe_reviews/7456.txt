This was the first cheesecake I've ever made and it turned out real well (and tasted really good!).  There are better cheesecakes I've tasted, but considering how basic the ingredients are and how simple it was to make is why I rated it a 5.

I wasnt impressed with the outcome of this cheesecake at all. It was very simple, and i followed the directions completely, but despite the reviews, I wont be making this one again.

I have used this recipe several times and it has become the family's favorite. A Must Have at Thanksgiving dinner. I do use a more traditional graham cracker crust and set a bowl of cherry pie filling on the side for those who wish to cover their cheesecake.

I have tried this cheesecake 2 times its good but  not everyone loves the tangy taste of so much lemon.

 I tried  AGAIN  a third time but WITH MY OWN   trust me a lot of research was done for the perfect recipe and I came up with my own using a lot of  different ideas. 

 I tried it last night and it came out Magnificent. HAD A TASTE TEST AND  EVERYONE WHO TASTED IT LOVED IT.
 It was smooth and creamy and not one crack and for someone who has baked only 3 cheesecakes I was very pleased its just what I want my cheesecake to taste like.

Wonderful, my family loved. One cousin said it wasn't sweet enough, I prefer it and everyone did too. This is my go to cheesecake recipe now. Only thing I changed was I used a ready made gramham cracker crust.

This is not only the best cheesecake I've ever made, it's the best I've ever eaten.  A great treat for family or friends.  I top it with cherries or blueberries.  I've made it severeal times now, and it always comes out exactly the same. Very easy and delicious.
