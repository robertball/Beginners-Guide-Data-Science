I like any recipe with brussel sprouts in it so this one really caught my eye - I changed it to a cold salad, and when I took out the bacon, I left the drippings in the skillet and added a 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts - saut√©ed them for about a minute, then added the walnuts to a bowl with 4 TBS brown sugar and gave them thorough coating and then put them in the freezer for 20 minutes along with the bacon bits.  For the brussel sprouts I took frozen sprouts, soaked in hot water until they are cuttable and halved them, then steamed them in the micro for about one minute, then put them in the fridge to cool.  I tossed the salad with the sprouts, bacon and sugar coated walnuts and served them chilled.  Yummy!

YUM!  Needs a little salt, and I left out the caraway seeds.  Very tasty, although I used olive oil instead of veggie oil and basalmic insteat of white wine vinegar.  I doubt that it made that much of a difference.  I'll definitely make this again!

I don't often find interesting brussel sprouts recipes...I don't care for carraway seeds so I substituted toasted sesame seeds and I added carmalized onions and my family and I loved it.

This was so good!!  My sister in law made this and we chowed down.  I love fresh and even frozen brussel sprouts.  She made this without the caraway seeds but we are gonna make it again and then add them to compare.

This was just okay, though I give points for the idea of thinly slicing the brussel sprouts - now I'll do that any time I prepare them!  It could be because I'm not crazy about caraway seed, except in rye bread or (with a light hand) in sauerkraut.  I would make this again, but leave out that particular seasoning.

This was awesome!  Next time though, I will omit the caraway seeds, as the smell totally turns me off.  But even with them, once I tasted, they were soooo good!

We are not Brussel Sprout eaters, but since I found some really fresh ones in the store, I decided to try this recipe. I did not use all the oil called for -just some of the bacon drippings (okay that's not the healthiest, but tasted good.) I used Splenda instead of sugar and seasoned rice vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar. After reading the reviews, I used only 1/2 teaspoon of the caraway seeds (and that was fine). I would suggest that you clean and slice the sprouts before steaming, otherwise they are soft and not easy to cut. We enjoyed this recipe even though my husband said he did not like sprouts.

This was edible, but I will not make again.  I ommitted the caraway seeds.  I thought the vinegar was too strong, not sweet enough, and I think I would prefer more of a mayonnaise dressing.  My husband liked it. It made my 9 year old gag, but she doesn't like sprouts or vinegar.

This was an okay recipe, but I did make a few changes (for the better I think - hence only 3 stars) ... I sliced the sprouts and steamed them in the microwave for 3 minutes ~ then saute'd them in the bacon fat.  Removed them from the pan and then to the pan added about 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil and 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar (more of a sweet and sour thing) .. heated that up, added the sprouts back in and mixed them - then dumped the spinach in and tossed to coat.  Most of the spinach leaves were still on the "raw" side and those were good - the ones that were wilted I didn't care for at all.  (I didn't add the caraway seed because I realized I didn't have any - though I don't think it would have made a difference)  Thanks anyway, though!

Well Barrett, in our house caraway seeds definitely don't stink and they added a great layer of flavor to this already fantastic dish. Our two favorite vegies and the bacon dressing created a wonderful side. Thanks!!!!

How different! I usually don't care for caraway seeds, but they gave this salad such an interesting flavor. I was tempted to salt the spinach mixture before adding the bacon, and I am glad that I didn't. I left the sprouts whole rather than slicing them. I probably won't make this often, but I'm really glad that I tried it!

I was a little confused about "thin sliced" brussel sprouts.  I used frozen, cooked them in the microwave, then cut them in three slices each.  I used evoo and balsalmic vinegar.  I thought it was a little too much sugar but overall I was pretty impressed.

I made it with sesame seeds, pistachios, potato latkas, and smoked herring.  It was pretty darn good.  A bit of plain yogurt or sour cream on the side.  With Chardonnay.

This is a wonderful side dish. One must definitely add the caraway seeds to this dish. And I used balsalmic vinegar, instead of the white white vinegar.

Made this last night and it was a big hit. I baked the bacon and used the fat to cook the Brussels sprouts as suggested. I didn't add the vegetable oil-I felt like the bacon fat was more than enough. I used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar instead of the white. I was skeptical about the caraway seeds but I put them in right at the end and they were perfect!
