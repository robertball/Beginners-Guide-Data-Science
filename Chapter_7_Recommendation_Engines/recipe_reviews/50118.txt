As a refreshingly cold and light dessert, this recipe gets a five.But the overall flavor is rather bland due to the nature of apricots. For this reason I gave it a four. I will make this again and add a little lemon juice with the orange for a little more bite.I will also try it with Kerns Strawberry/banana nectar.
