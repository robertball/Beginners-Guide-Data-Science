Wonderful cookies! I am not usually fond of soft cookies or raisins but these are good. I soaked my raisins in just enough wine to cover them (3/4 cup instead of 2 cups) and soaked them overnight. If you get the raisins that are moist packed just for baking you will need even less wine to soak. I cut the cinnamon back to 2 tsp but 2 1/2 tsp would have been fine. I used lemon extract and no vanilla. I would make these again.

This recipe tasted strangely like banana bread but not in a bad way. It was nice enough but not good enough for me to make again.

I really enjoyed these cookies.  I had them to munch on for days (made 4 different cookies in a day), and they were as soft and yummy almost a week later as they were right out of the oven.  My kids really liked them as well.  I didn't use as much wine as called for to soak the raisins because it was not needed.  Just enough to cover them worked great.

I made these with gluten free flour and used grated lemon peel instead of the extract. Because I had no brown sugar I only used white sugar. I baked them at 350 for 12 minutes. These are delicious!

Great recipe. I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and was extremely pleased with the results.

I was looking for a recipe to use an opened bottle of white wine and found this one. The story pulled me in and I HAD to make them. Plus it called for raisins which isn't a common ingredient any more. They are fantastic cookies-- moist and flavorful. Our company loved them and wanted the recipe. A keeper for sure!
