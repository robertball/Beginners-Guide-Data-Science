This is the best fried cabbage recipe I've ever had!  The flavor is wonderful.  I've made it twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but decided to make a few changes when I made it the second time.  I didn't use the oil for frying the bacon (you really don't need it) and I took the bacon out of the pan when it was done.  It gets a bit soggy after you add the cabbage because of all of the natural moisture coming out of the cabbage as it cooks.  I added it back in when the dish was almost done.  I also found that it needs more time to cook, but I guess that's a matter of personal choice as to how crisp you want the cabbage.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!!!!!

This has become a family favorite of ours that we crave! The only thing I did differently was saute the onions on the side and then added in.

Great recipe, but I think it is better if you double the bacon and omit the vegetable oil.  Next time, I also will take the suggestion of dipping out the bacon before adding the cabbage and onion, then adding the bacon back after the cabbage and onion have been fried.  The bacon does get a little soggy if you keep it all in the pot together.

Oh the memories this dish brings back! I am a southern girl who practicaly grew up on this stuff, but haven't made it for my family because we try to stay away from fried food as much as possible. On a whim I made this tonight.I cooked the bacon first, didn't add any extra oil, in fact,poured a little out, added a bit of minced garlic, caraway seeds and celery seed. I also threw in the crumbled cook bacon during the last couple of minutes. As I was making this, I remembered that my Mother and Grandmother kept a lid on it and lifted it now and then to stir, which differs a bit from this recipe as it says to stir continuously. So I cooked it with the lid on , and it was perfect! my husband raved on and on about it!

I agree, omit the oil and maybe some extra bacon, but I have always added splash of red wine vinegar to fried cabbage and use brown sugar for the white. It seems to add that little something. I also cook mine longer and it is great.

Great recipe! I took the advice of others: I eliminated the vegetable oil, doubled the bacon, and removed the bacon before adding the cabbage and onion, and returned it when the cabbage was almost done.  I also didn't stir it as much.  I placed a lid on the pan which helped seal in the flavors of the seasonings.  Mmmm... Good!

Made this twice. The first time exactly as written, the second time, I omitted the oil and doubled the bacon, just using the bacon grease to cook the cabbage in. It's so much better this way. Oh, and a tablespoon of sugar instead of a pinch. So good...

This brings back fond memories of my mama's kitchen. Cheap, too, especially in the spring. I did make a few changes - left out the oil and used just the bacon drippings. Left out the onions. Removed the bacon before adding the cabbage, then added it back just before I was ready to serve. Also cooked it a little longer, till it was just done - a touch crispy and not a bit limp. I will be using this recipe a lot this spring and summer!

Good basic recipe for fried cabbage like my mom always made. But here are a few tips: 1)Please don't use the extra veg oil - too greasy. The bacon fat will be more than enough if you follow tip two. 2)After cooking the bacon, remove it and put the chopped cabbage right into the the hot oil. Cover with a lid immediately and turn your heat down a little. This causes a fry/steam. The water in the cabbage keeps the cooking going without burning. 3)I add a pinch of sugar to cut down the acid/tang a bit. and 4)Add a pinch of baking soda to also cut the acid and reduce some of that gas that cabbage can produce.

Loved this recipe.  My hubby loves southern comfort food, but it takes so long to prepare.  I tried this recipe hoping to have "southern" cabbage and cut down on the cooking time.  It worked!  The only reason I give it 4 stars is you do need to cook it a bit longer than the directions for true "southern" cabbage.  Thanks for sharing!

Super easy and very delicious.  I didn't use the oil but used the fat from the bacon which I think gives the recipe more flavor. You can also cook some wide egg noddles and mix the cabbage with it and it makes it a complete meal.

I work at a retirement home as a cook.  I had to make cooked cabbage for 53 residents and 4 staff.  I love your customize button as I had to upside the recipe to 50 servings.  Well I want to tell you that I did not make enough because I had about 15 residents and 1 staff wanting seconds.  I was the hero at work that day--I will make it again when I have to make cabbage!!

This is an old German recipe---Add about two or three Tbs. cider vinegar and it's a sweet and sour fried cabbage that I've enjoyed for the past 80 years and still loving it.  I also dice up the core of the cabbage (no need to waste it) and cook it too.  Delicious !

This is so yummy!  I cooked the bacon, reserved some of the grease, sauteed the onions and some garlic then added the cabbage and poured about 1 or 2 TBSP more of bacon fat and continued to cook! I totally skipped the oil as it really doesn't need it with the bacon fat plus I think the bacon grease gives it more flavour.  I also loaded it w/ S&P to taste!  THX

This was my 2nd time making cabbage and I followed this recipe almost exactly and it was AWESOME. Even my partner who hates cabbage ate it and loved it. I did add diced smoked sausage to it and sauted the sausage and some onions with the bacon. I omitted the oil and added some flaked red pepper (a pinch), a bit more sugar than the recipe calls for and a tablespoon of applesauce. Yes applesauce which heightened the sweetness and flavor.  I cooked it longer than teh recipe calls for because I like cabbage soft. This was really good. We ate the whole pan. Yummy!!!

Fried cabbage is always good, but you don't need the oil just a little more bacon (well done and crumbled).  Also, bell pepper cut up and thrown in with the cabbage and onion completes this recipe.  Sooooo good!!!

I started out tasting it...now I am on my 6th helping.  I have only two small bowls left...which I plan on finishing after I submit this review.  I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed cabbage this much!  I did make some modifications...I eliminated the sugar and added chopped scallions, garlic, and cajun seasoning.

Delicious.  Crisp bacon and remove from pot.  I love my cabbage cooked until it is wilted.  Crumbled the bacon, placed cabbage in a serving dish and sprinkled the crumbled bacon on top.  A little slice of heaven.

Excellent recipe.  I eliminated the oil and sugar. Increased bacon to 1 lb. and sliced it into small pieces.  When bacon was crispy I took it out of the pan and set aside.  Used grease rendered by the bacon for the cabbage and onions (increased to 2 onions and added 2 cloves of chopped garlic).  On the side cooked 2 large quartered potatoes and when almost soft added them to the cabbage.  When all was cooked, added the crispy bacon and a large bunch of chopped parlsey.  YUM!  My family went wild as served with pork chops and mushroom gravy.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised, this was really good. Just him and I were eating it so I used half the cabbage, didn't use the oil, used the same amount of bacon, onion, but added more sugar. This went along great with our broiled pork steaks. Next time I might add some chopped apple in it. 9-7-12 This time I used turkey bacon and apples, still just as scrumptious :)

This is very good and tasty.  Like others suggested, I add fried bacon after cabbage is done.   I saute onion in bacon grease. I don't add veggie oil but I add 1 tbs butter or margarine to cabbage and 1 pack of Goya ham seasoning.  It is very good. Thanks for sharing a good recipe

This was delicious!  I've always been one to say "I don't like cabbage" when really I just never had it with bacon.  HAHA!

I did make some changes.  I omitted the vegetable oil, cooked the bacon then removed it from the pan.  I then cooked my onion (only about 1/2 cup) with a clove of garlic in the bacon fat.  Once that was how I like it, I added the cabbage, salt, pepper, and a pinch of Truvia (I'm going for low-carb here).  After about 5 minutes, I crumbled the bacon back in and mixed it up well then plated.  It was so yummy!

I make this all the time. Instead of using vegetable oil I use bacon drippings and omit the sugar. I also use sweet onions instead of white onions. Preferably Vidalia onions. Try it using this variation I think it tastes much better.

Wow! This is excellent! I agree, It really isn't necessary to use any oil at all to cook your bacon in. I also removed my bacon from the pan and I cooked my cabbage in a very little bit of the drippings. I then added the bacon back to the cabbage at the end of the cooking time keeping the bacon a little crisper.

Looked good, carmalized onions, bacon and a little browning of the cabbage itself. I like the cabbage limp, I don't require all the oil, better if that is cut in half. A good stand by recipe.

Love this recipe but you do not need the vegetable oil, the bacon grease is plenty. I also cook the bacon whole and then crumble it in at the end. Yummy! Making it again tonight, its my husbands favorite.

truly tasty!  Like others, I left out veggie oil & sugar, used 4 slices of bacon, pulled out bacon before putting in cabbage and onions (returning it at the end), and let the veggies cook about 20 minutes covered (med heat) stirring occassionally (5 minutes cooking is too crunchy for me and this dish).  Two thumbs up :)

Awesome! I used more like a third of a lb of bacon, yellow onion instead of white onion because it is what I had on hand and I did not use any vegetable oil. This was absolutely delicious. The relaxed texture of cabbage and onion mixed with the crunch of bacon was so yum! Needless to say my house smelled terrific.

Here in N.O. this resembles what we call smothered cabbage and true smothered cabbage is cooked for a wile with ham (ham bone is best) and or pickle meat.  We cook it real slow for 3 hours covered, stirring every 1/2 hour or so, then add baby carrots the last hour of cooking.  We also add more seasoings, including some bay leaf.

Loved this.  I increased the bacon to 6 slices, ommited the vegetable oil and only used 1/2 of a very large cabbage.  First time making fried cabbage and it was a big hit!

I like this recipe for its simplicity, and I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and omitted the oil and doubled the bacon.  It was still TOO greasy for my taste.  I will make it again, but next time I will cut back on the bacon and cover the pan while it fries to seal in the flavors at bit.

10/12/14 - I made this again today and I think the difference was adding a about a TBSP of sugar versus a pinch.  My husband loved it and ate a second helping.  I won't cook it too often as we don't eat a lot of fried foods, but it is DELICIOUS!

These were pretty good...I did make a few changes. I reduced the oil to 1 TBSP (the bacon generates enough grease). I also waited until I added the cabbage to add the salt and pepper, and eliminated the sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Maybe I did something wrong? It seemed kind of tasteless and very greasy. I kept having to add more salt. I will probably not make it again.

i made this for new years day along with black eyed peas and cornbread. excellent recipe. i didnt have much more than a bite of this, but the guys wiped out a whole pan of it. the only change i made was to use salt free seasoning when i cooked it and i put salt on the table for those who wanted it since i dont cook with alot of salt. i will make this again. they loved it.

YUUUUM!!!  I loved this!!  I made cabbage rolls for dinner and didn't want to waste the 3/4 head of cabbage so tried this recipe. Glad I did! I didn't use the bacon but regularly keep bacon grease in the freezer for frying with flavor...perfect time to get it out.  I used 2 T of bacon grease and NO vegetable oil.  If you cook long enough, it really doesn't need any more oil.  I found mine needed more salt for my taste.  Then after a good 30 minutes on the stove, I splashed some vinegar in the pan, stirred it around and served.  I planned on having it for a second meal but husband loved it so much he polished it off the next day!

I used this recipe as a guide since I only cook cabbage at this time of year when family members usually give me fresh cabbage. I did not use the extra oil and I too put the bacon in when the cabbage was almost done. In my bacon grease I sauteed the onions but also added some bell pepper and celery and a little garlice.  This dish is also good when you use salt meat and smoked sausage instead of bacon but the bacon version is my favorite.

So yummy. My hubby learned to make this as a kid. His family's housekeeper was very southern! We like to use 4 or 5 slices of bacon and little or no oil. It really doesn't need the extra oil. You can add a little chicken broth if it needs more moisture though!

I have made this apple butter 2 times, and was delicious. But, I used 1 cup of splenda, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, being as the apples were sweet. I also added to the recipe 2 heaping tsp. of apple pie spice. Was  very good! MaryAnn

Hey, y'all!  This was divine!  The only thing I did differently is I used butter instead of margarine and it was delicious!  I did use about 3 Tbs sugar, too.  Fantastic and everyone loved it!

This was great. I didn't use the vegetable oil. The bacon grease was enough. I added some nice hot peppers and it was perfect! Thank you!!

This is a delicious way to prepare cabbage.  I usually add 1/4 C. water and sometimes I don't use bacon, instead use a lot of margerine mixed with vegetable oil. It's really tastey and zippy to splash it with apple cider vinegar at the end too!

This has become a regular go-to for me.  Love it!!  I'm not a Southerner so I can't comment on the authenticity but I can speak to the flavor - and it's wonderful!  I love the health benefits of cabbage and finding new ways to include it in my diet - this a great recipe for that.  I've made this a few time and last night I had this as my side along with my BBQ pulled pork and rice - a great combination!  I have modified this just slightly by adding in some minced garlic while grilling the onion and bacon, then adding about 1 Tbl of sushi vinegar (seasoned with salt and sugar)  with the cabbage to give it a hint of sweet and sour - as a substitute for the white sugar in the recipe.  This dish is super easy to make, healthy and so good!  It can go along side of many mains!

This recipe was surprisingly good, and very easy to make.  I did not have bacon, but had a little leftover pork which I fried till crispy.  It did the trick nicely.  I used the leftover cabbage, after making the the cabbage tamale recipe with the large outer leaves.  We ate the whole thing in one sitting, everyone loved it.

Our new year's meal tasted great with this cabbage.  The only think I changed was omitting the oil, and I added more seasoning (garlic, pepper, salt, onion powder, diced jalapeno and a little of the juice from the jalapeno jar.)  very good!

Excellent and easy. I used 4 slices of bacon and sautéed the cabbage in the drippings. No extra oil was needed! Splash of red wine vinegar is nice and so is a bit of red pepper flakes. Thanks

Like most others, I omitted the oil. I used an entire package of bacon, which I felt was the perfect amount once crisped. I used a smaller head of organic cabbage and it took a LOT longer to cook down to the texture I wanted, even cooking with a lid on. Even though I browned the the onions and cabbage in the bacon grease, it still didn't produce the bacon flavor I was expecting. I added some garlic powder to the cabbage while cooking, subbed about 1 T brown sugar, and added a few splashes of red wine vinegar as I generally do when frying cabbage. Served with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread, which was a fantastic pairing! Overall, the taste was just ok; I'll try again with a different brand of bacon. I still have high hopes for this!

The secret to good cooked cabbage is bacon grease and a little sugar.  Butter can be used in place of the oil.  We love cooked cabbage, but seldom use onions with our cabbage; although, we love onions. Play around with this recipe and adjust the seasonings to your liking.

Very good. Warning, All the ideas in the comments are good but this dish is Best kept simple. I made mine with red onions and some balsamic vinegar. Kind of like the recipe for "Pancetta Fried Cabbage". It tasted kind of German and would be great with fried potatoes.

Wow! Can't get enough! I did not use the oil or the sugar. I fried the bacon and set aside, used some of the bacon grease and sauteed the onions and cabbage then added the crumbled bacon back in. This is super easy, delicious and nutritious! Thanks for the recipe.....just like grandma used to make! :)

Holy cow this was delicious!!! I didn't use salt as the bacon is salty enough already. I did scoop the bacon out and stir fired the cabbage and onion without it cause I wanted my bacon crispy. I added 6 strips of bacon instead of 3 and drained some of the grease before adding the cabbage and onion. So declicious!!!!

Awesome recipe. We have made this so many times, it is now a staple in my home. We like our bacon, so i use closer to a half pound. I also add a half cup of white wine to reduce. And chipolte in adobe to taste(usually 2 for a kick).

Been eating this my whole life. It's best when made with Early Jersey Wakefield cabbage straight out of the garden. I always add carrots as well. Try using andouille sausage, smoked sausage, and country ham as well.

I love cabbage, but didn't care for this. Greasy and bland. I don't do bacon, so left that out (which I always do on recipes & usually the food is still amazing... not so with this one). Don't like to waste food so I'll figure out a way to make this edible...  maybe red pepper & garlic.

I used just bacon grease that I had saved because I was out of bacon, still turned out really good. This was a nice way to fix cabbage for New years, and everyone enjoyed it vs. plain old boiled boring cabbage. Served with corned beef brisket and spicy bean salsa for a different start to the new year.

This cabbage is very good, i like other reviewers cooked the cabbage in the bacon grease after removing the bacon and added the bacon back in at the end,crumbled on top so that it would maintain its crispness. I also cooked the cabbage much longer than 5 minutes as I do not like it crisp. I prefer it well wilted.

I like to add a couple of thin-sliced tart apples. Saute them in the bacon grease with the onion. Brown sugar instead of white and just a dash of white vinegar. We had this at a pioneer re-enactment village made over a woodstove and it was awesome!

I left out the sugar and used about 2 tablespoons of butter instead of the oil.  I also cooked it a bit differently- cooked the bacon then removed it, added the butter to the skillet and cooked the onion for a couple minutes, then added the cabbage and cooked it, stirring occasionally, for about 10-15 minutes until the cabbage was cooked as much as I wanted.  Then added salt and pepper and the crumbled bacon.  It was really good!  Very cheap and easy and I'll definitely make it again.

Its not even dinner time yet but Ive been robbing it out of the pot... surely its wrong to like cabbage so much?!!   Am in Germany and bacon isnt as widely available so I bought some diced stuff which is almost the same anyway! Yummy xx

Very good! I made it without the bacon as I am a vegetarian, and it was still awesome. I was curious what the sugar would bring to the dish, but it turned out perfect. I wouldn't change a thing.

Great!  I used 1/4 lb. diced ham steak because I didn't have the bacon and it turned out great!  We will definitely be having this again.

There is nothing like southern cooking! People always look at cabbage to be a bland dish, but the bacon and sugar add alot to it. I love to change it up and use salt pork and even hamocks. Really any type of pork will flavor this dish real well. I prefer my cabbage roughly chopped instead of stredded or sliced but this seriously is the best cabbage recipe on this site.

This was great! This was my first ever attempt at fried cabbage! I made it exactly as stated, using an electric skillet.. It turned out perfect! I was afraid hubby wouldn't like it but he loved it, and my 8 yr old daughter did too! We will definitely make this again! Thank you so much for the recipe!

Great start to a wonderful dish, but it truly needed more flavor. I used much more bacon than stated, therefore didn't need to use the oil at all. Family loved it and thank you!

I really actually liked this quite a lot, and loved how easy, quick and cheap it was for a first attempt cooking cabbage. :) I did double the bacon and added 2 tsps sugar. Delish.

The only change I made was to cut out the oil.  I used a non stick skillet and added 1 tea hot sauce.  If it sticks it add 1 tea butter and it is the best ever and I am a true GRIT. Thanks Vickie oh yea my husband who never liked fried cabbage loves this we cook it a least 2 times a month.

I would at least double the bacon next time and like others, take it out after it's done, crumble it and add back in just before serving.  With the extra bacon I would give it 5 stars.

This was great! I couldn't cut the oil out as I used turkey bacon, so I subbed olive oil for the veg. oil. I also added some red pepper flakes. Yummy and healthy.

I had to prepare this without  bacon. But I was still able to prepare cabbage with the pan drippings from the Consomme Pork Chop recipe on this site.  I added a couple of pats of real butter, a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and then followed the recipe as stated. was wonderful!

Great recipe, but I don't use any oil...just spray my pan with pam, cut up lots of bacon in 1/2" squares and fry it up, with the bacon and grease still in pan add a whole head of SAVOY cabbage (cut of course)and an onion.  For seasoning I add 1 packet of GOYA Ham flavoring...no salt or pepper!

This was really good, my husband loved it. I used red cabbage only because the green cabbage heads were all to big for just the two of us.  I also used a 100% natural sausage, as my husband cannot have any presertives in his food. I cooked it in a little butter and olive oil.Will make this again.

Surprisingly good! I've recently moved to a colder climate and since we like to eat things in season, I've been looking for good winter veg recipes. These big scary looking heads of cabbage aren't so bad after all!

DEEEELISH!  I like to add  a little soy sauce and eat it with plain ole rice for an excellent lunch. This is a great recipe and one my grand kids happily go back to for seconds! I've used it as a veggie side dish for dinner and there's  never any leftover. Many thanks for another great addition to my recipe box.

This was so good, even the kids enjoyed it. I did make a couple changes for times sake. I used a bag of pre-shredded cole slaw instead of shredding the cabbage. I also used dehydrated chopped onions, 1 T, instead of the onion.

LOVE THIS!! I used turkey bacon, olive oil and omitted the sugar.  Even my bf, who hates cabbage couldn't get enough of this.

Yummy!  I followed the advice of several others by not adding the oil, and removing the bacon from the pan before adding the cabbage and onion.  I also sauteed the onions a little before adding the cabbage...perfect!  My husband is from Arkansas and absolutely loved this dish as part of our Good Luck New Years Day meal!

WOW!!!! After a little incident at the store (I wound up grabbing a head of cabbage instead of a head of lettuce like I had intended to do)I was stuck out clueless not knowing how to cook cabbage, but I knew how it should taste. The was it. I followed the instructions about not putting the extra oil and taking the bacon out before putting the cabbage in. I did not even add sugar. It turned out terrific, Thanks sooo much for this recipie. :)

Tasty & simple.  I used about 3/4 pound of bacon & drained all drippings except 1/3 cup & omitted the oil.  Bacon flavor is better this way.  Added a bit more sugar & browned the cabbage a bit longer & it was great.  Even my son who hates cabbage liked it.

To cut down on the fat I use turkey bacon cooked in the microwave. I also only use 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil (Olive, of course!), and add a little extra water. We think it's the best cabbage we've ever eaten. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this mostly for myself and I didn't think my wife would care that much for it but I think she liked it as much as I did. I did change a couple of things... First, I added 1/2 pound of kielbasa sliced into 1/2 inch slices. I didn't use any of the veggy oil and only 1 tablespoon of butter and I added a few caraway seeds. I cooked the cabbage a bit longer than 10 minutes until it was very tender. The result was perfect.

This was too greasy for my taste (not a fan of fried anything), but my husband is making it again tonight and reducing the oil to 1 T per another review.  He uses maple cured bacon and omit's the sugar altogether.

I'm a northerner so this isn't a comfort food for me but I've always wanted to try it.  It was a little greasy for my taste so next time I think I'll omit the veg oil and just use a little more bacon.  Other than that it's good and I'll make it again the next time I have a head of cabbage on hand!

This is a delicious cabbage recipe...very easy to make. I deviated from the recipe just a bit. Instead of a head of cabbage, I used a bag of coleslaw mix with carrots, added a full teaspoon of sugar and allowed it to simmer for 30 minutes. It was so good, I’ll definitely make it again!!

I loved this dish. I did make a few changes as follows:  I did not slice the cabbage. I chopped it. Not small pieces either. I didn't use any vegetable oil at all. I used 9 slices of bacon cut into one inch pieces and one and a half onions. I used all the bacon grease instead of the oil and salted it as I went along. I did not put sugar in it. I fried the bacon in a six quart pot first until crisp. I scooped out the cooked bacon and added the chopped onion to the bacon grease. I cooked the onion until soft and then added the chopped cabbage. When the cabbage was soft, I added the bacon back to the pot. I'm making it again for St. Paddy's Day instead of boiled cabbage

Have made this twice now. The first time I'm not sure what I did wrong, it tasted ok but I knew it could be better. So made it again last night. Turned out great. Just had enough left over for my lunch today. Will be making it again.

I love fried cabbage! I also don't put the cabbage directly in with the bacon. I remove it and add it back later. I've also always put green peppers in with mine. That's a personal preference. Thanks for a great recipe!

We liked this. I did not add the oil when cooking the bacon, thinking the bacon grease would be enough. I did spray the pan during cooking but that did not add the amount of oil called for. Will plan to make it again.

This recipe is as old as the South and there is a reason for it's longevity. It is fantastic! I cook this for my family from time to time and no matter how many times it is cooked there are no leftovers, ever...Delicious almost comes close to describing this.
It's easy, quick and wonderful. Works great for any occasion and there are never any waste leftovers.

Very Good. I had a very big head of cabbage so I added a few more strips of bacon to the recipes. I will still add the extra strips even if I use a smaller head next time.

The most popular dish on the table!  Made it exactly by the recipe.  Do be careful to not over-cook.  A couple of super-mushy bits are fine, but you don't want to reduce the whole thing to a bowl of cabbage mush.

This is a yummy Southern dish.  I doubled the bacon & cut it in 1" lengths before cooking; then omitted the oil.  I cut the cabbage in a 2" dice rather than slicing into strips.  I also used 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper & sugar.  It made an amount for 4 people to have a hefty-size serving.  I served this with brats & small new red potatoes.

Who'd have thunk?!? It was great! It was simple to make. I was looking for something that would use up a cabbage that's been in the fridge for a while and this was a perfect and delicious solution.

I have made this recipe multiple times. We LOVE it. It is quick and easy. The only thing I have to add is don't overcook your cabbage. Although I cook it a little longer than suggested (maybe 3 more minutes), it can easily be over cooked and soggy.

I made this for both Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. It was so good that I was asked to double the recipe for Christmas. This is now a family favorite. I substituted pork bacon for chicken bacon and it was delicious.

Delicious!!! My boyfriend loved it.  

I didn't use but a drop of vegetable oil, added some butter and instead of adding sugar I added sweet onions.

I have had cabbage one way.  With a New England Boiled Dinner.  I have loved the cabbage in it, but never thought about doing anything else with it.  Then came cabbage rolls!  I loved the cabbage part so much, I grate cabbage into the meat mixture & wrap with two leaves.  Hmmm.  Then THIS dish floated across my tongue!!!  I LOVE IT!!!  I took the recommendations from several folks about the bacon, covering it, (lowered heat), cooked longer, etc., but didn't change the ingredients.  Guess I must have been a "southerner" in another life  !!!  Thanks for posting!

Blessings!

Just made this (with a few changes) and the family loved it. My husband does not eat pork so I used Turkey Bacon. I cooked the turkey bacon until crisp (used about 6 slices), used 4 tbs butter instead of oil, brown sugar instead of white and a sweet Vandalia onion. Just a sprinkle of creole seasoning in addition to those listed. Next time I'll double the recipe because they all wanted seconds :)

Great foundation for a beginner like me. I tweeked it a little. I added butter, 3 slices more bacon, a lil more salt ,sprinkled some crushed red peppers and added a package of hidden valley ranch seasoning and it was delicious.

I used just a drop of oil because my bacon was 80% already done when I put it in the pan.  I then like many people suggested removed the bacon after it was crisp.  I sautéed the onions in the bacon fat before putting the cabbage in.  After adding the cabbage I added the salt, pepper and sugar as directed.  About half way through the cooking I tasted the cabbage and added more salt and sugar to taste.  Placing the bacon back in at the end added a nice crunch and flavor to each bite.

I'm well past 65 and had never had fried cabbage. I had never even heard of it until I was searching low carb recipes.  We shall be having this on a regular basis.  I agree with many other reviewers.  The next time I will not add the extra oil and I will at least double the bacon.  This is a very good side dish.

I loved this recipe. I didn't have fresh bacon on hand so I used hormel real bacon pieces instead and it was great! I also put a top of the pot to soften the cabbage a little. My husband always turns his nose up to cabbage and even he liked it!

This is the first time I've made fried cabbage and it was delicious! What we did: cook the bacon separately first, add more bacon (2-3x more), omit the canola oil and cook the cabbage in the bacon grease, add more than a pinch of sugar (about  1-2 tsp.), add caraway seed (but not too much because it could be overpowering--I'd say about a 1/4 tsp.), add celery seed, and cook down for much longer than the 5 minutes suggested. It turned out wonderfully. Next time I may try adding a little red wine vinegar to taste. Very good!

It was ok but not my favorite, but I'm not a huge cabbage fan.  It coild have used a little more bacon, a little less cabbage for my taste.   I added a titch of red wine vinegar before serving to give it a little something extra.  Probably will not make again.

Very good, but I added a little white vinegar for a sweet sour taste.  I used the grease from the bacon to sauté the cabbage and onion, and before serving I crumbled the bacon and sprinkled it on top!

OMG! Cabbage is not a favorite of mine. However, my husband wanted it for New Year's Day. I did a research on southern cooking for cabbage and came across this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly without adding anything extra.  It was the best that I had since growing up in the south. This will be one to add to my recipe box! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is completely simple.  Kinda too simple.  I doubled the bacon (used turkey bacon) and didn't cook it in oil.  Also, I cooked the cabbage for longer.  I am not a big cabbage lover so this recipe was just ok for me.

Loved this recipe!!!!  Made it yesterday for our extended family and even the kids who don't normally like cabbage "loved" it.  ( their words).  I added about a cup of juice from the corned beef that had cooked all day in the slow cooker and that added even mores flavor t this recipe.  

Really great, can't wait to make it again!

I used this recipe as a guide.  I didn't have bacon but did have leftover bacon grease and I only used a few tablespoons of bacon grease.  I left out the onion since we had onions in other dishes for dinner.  This turned out great and is my favorite way to eat cabbage now.

The recipe itself was easy and straightforward.  I did alter it a bit, so I can't rate it as is, but I will share my alterations.  I added caraway seeds and celery seed as one review suggested.  I also added a bit of balsamic vinegar, and a little less sugar.  Cooked it up for about 15 minutes and added in crushed ramen noodles just before serving.  Delicious!!

i am from the south and never heard of this until my colorado husband cooked it for me, i fell in love ! but, he uses no sugar, like these recipes or cider. which i am glad because i am not a big sugar or salt person when cooking. if you haven't tried this...don't delay. we add smoked sausage or kelbasa to make it the main course.

We eat alot of cabbage in our house. But, I had never made fried cabbage. I made a couple small changes to this.I added some polish sausage and only used 1/2 an onion.  It was so good! My husband said "this is the kind of meal that I could eat until I made myself sick."

My husband and children loved this dish! I followed the directions exactly except that I added a tad bit more sugar...to entice my children to eat cabbage. However, it was so delicious that I don't think I needed to add anything extra.

Delicious dish!  I did modify a bit- skipped the oil and added an extra strip (or 2 ;) shh) of bacon, used 1/2 a red onion and a big Napa cabbage.  This was a hit with the whole family.  I was a tad nervous about salting bacon, but it turned out fantastic.

THANK YOU!  

my son had been asking for cabbage with dinner for months and i just couldn't figure out wthowdy to do with a cabbage besides coleslaw.  I served this alongside mashed fingerling potatoes & grilled chicken breast.

friggin delicious!

Excellent!!  Just like we had at a restaurant in Tulsa, OK.  Instead of oil I used 1 tbsp butter, but left everything else as is.  Great with steak, too.

Excellent recipe, easy and great tasting.  I added more bacon with a little olive oil.  I also removed the bacon and cooked down the cabbage/onion a bit, then added the bacon back in.  Also sprinkle is some crushed red pepper to heat it up some.   Kiss your Mammaw for a great recipe :-)

We make this a lot at our house, but I use shedded coleslaw in a bag. Fry slivered bacon with onion, then add coleslaw. Mix together and cover with lid. Simmer for about 10 minutes, then add salt and fresh ground pepper and 2 tbsp of sourcream. Mix together and serve. Really yummy!

This was delicious!!!!  Instead of vegetable oil and bacon, I used EVOO and turkey bacon and it turned out wonderful.  This one is a keeper, will be cooking this again!!!  UPDATE - - 12/11/11.  I made this again last night.  I used regular bacon and instead of 2 Tablespoons of water, I had a some chicken broth that needed to be used so I used that instead.  Still DELISH!!!! I will continue to use this recipe.  Thanks for sharing

I had never tried this, but was doing a Southern cooking night and wanted to try something new. We really enjoyed this! I didn't use any veg. oil and I still thought it was a little greasy, but the mix of flavors was great! I added some garlic, as well as onion powder and paprika. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  Normally I hate cabbage, but this tasted great!  I was out of bacon, so I fried it up with a little breakfast sausage instead.  I served it with the Southern Ham and Brown Beans recipe from this site and some hot cornbread, and the cabbage was the first thing gone.  I will definitely be making this again!

Great Dish!  It is super easy to put together.  I only adjusted the cooking time as I like my cabbage tender.  Once all the ingredients were combined I covered the skillet on low.  Super Delicious!

Really good flavor...i'd probably do half the pepper next time as it was somewhat spicy to the family, but overall it was really good.  Also increase your cook time!

This is good stuff.  I did add a bit more bacon.  I used turkey bacon because that's what I had, but it needs real bacon. I also did not 'stir continuously' for five minutes.  Instead I put a lid on it for about five minutes and stirred occasionally until it was tender.  My wife loved it.  I'll make this again and again.

I followed other reviewer suggestions and added more bacon leaving out the vegetable oil. It was very yummy, but the recipe calls for way too much pepper. I only used half the recommended amount and it was still quite strong.

This was my first time cooking cabbage and this recipe was great.  I followed it to the letter and was tempted to eat it all by myself.  My husband who is not a big cabbage eater enjoyed it as well.  Will definitely save this recipe to make for years to come.  Thanks!

I did take the oil out as well, and this was EXACTLY what I had hoped it would be. As a pregnant mommy, I have been craving this dish, and it did NOT disappoint. Will make over and over again. So simple.

I grew up on this recipe. Mom, who was from Alabama, made it in her big cast iron skillet most of the time and didn't use the oil.  She added a little garlic and she added peppers to her own servings, since we kids didn't like spicy foods.  It is my favorite way to eat cabbage and I'm happy to see so many people enjoying it, especially those who were not previously cabbage lovers.  I will always enjoy this dish!

Definitely remove the bacon from the pan after frying and add to cabbage before serving. Great side dish, or even main course with some cornbread. Yummm.

This was great, especially with cornbread on the side. I made exactly as is, except I left out the 1/3 cup of oil, but drizzled a little olive oil in as needed. I will definitely make this again, especially with a garden full of cabbage about to be ready to pick!

Here in New England fried cabbage is a must. This recipe very good, never any leftovers no matter how large the head of cabbage. Thanks! The only thing I do differently is fry a bit longer for a little more color & depth of flavor.

Did not use the oil, like others said.  This was great!  I had never had fried cabbage before and I loved it!  So did my family.  Served with roasted balsamic pork and asparagus.  This was way better than the pork!  Thanks

I used pre shredded cabbage...so simple!  Was just delicious!  I would double the bacon and throw another pinch of sugar in... just remove a little of the bacon grease if necessary so its crispy and not soggy.

This is delicious.  I didn’t use the vegetable oil but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My husband who doesn’t care for cabbage enjoyed it and my kids gobbled it up.

This was delicious!  I reduced the oil to about half.  My family loved it, including my very fussy daughter.  I actually served this with Pulled Pork and it went perfectly together.

This was fabulous! It tastes just like what my Grandmother used to make. I used 5 slices of turkey bacon and just 1/8 C of olive oil. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I wasn't sure if my hubby would like it but he absolutely loved it. This will definitely be added into our list of regulars.

I'm what my husband would call a yankee, so I'm not sure what this is suppose to taste like, but I thought it was pretty good. I used shredded red cabbage b/c that's what I had on hand.

Really good smoky flavor.  Double the bacon, omit the veg. oil, and saute onion for 5 minutes before adding cabbage, need to cook cabbage longer.  Add 1 - 11/2 Tbs sugar.

Cooking cabbage has always been my "achille heel", but this recipe was fabulous!  I did modify it by adding a lb of smoked sausage to the cabbage 10 minutes before it finished cooking. I also cooked it for about 30 minutes and added about 1/3 cup of water.

Needless to say this was my entree, rather than a side dish.  This turned out better than I expected, and I look forward to cooking it again.

LOVE.  Doubled the bacon, no oil. 3 generous pinches of sugar.  To finish, a dash of red wine vinegar for freshness.

I'd never heard of this before and I was desperate to use up this massive cabbage I was given, and I was really sick of coleslaw.  This was pretty good.  I added extra bacon and no oil or sugar, and it was pretty greasy.  I think it was lacking somewhat in flavour and could of used garlic, herbs ect.  I won't make regularly because I rarely eat bacon, but this was quite good nonetheless.

I loved this cabbage!  It was wonderful - flavorful, crisp and tender.  That teeny bit of sugar made the flavors really pop.  I made two changes: first, I pulled the bacon out of the skillet when it was done, crumbled it, and added it back in when the cabbage was cooked so that it stayed crispy.  Second, I added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, simply because my husband likes a little kick to his veggies.  Both of us loved it and we'll be making it again!

Yum!  This is a traditional southern recipe, and it brought back memories.  I did not use the onions or the oil (the bacon grease was definately enough), and I cooked mine with lid on until tender.  I prefer to serve the bacon with it!  That's my favorite part!!

I tried this last night. I did omit the sugar and the oil and just used the bacon grease drippings. I even added a can of Rotel at the end of cooking time for a little spice.  Turned out great.  This will be a keeper for us.  Thanks!!!!!

This was a hit at our house!  I did everything as directed this time, but will probably decrease the oil next time and maybe try turkey bacon, just to make it a little healthier.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  This tastes like the wonderful cabbage I had in Germany! It is absolutely delicious!!  I didn't have bacon and so used sausage. I had it with bratwurst and gravy. My husband said he felt like he was back in Germany. Thanks for sharing this!

Thank God for the AllRecipes site, and for sharing folks who post recipes like this!  My mother used to make this as a main dish; she was a Depression child, and knew how to extend and stretch any ingredients.  She passed on in 1991, and I was certain I'd never eat this again, as she never wrote the recipe down.  I was so very glad to find it on here!  I, too, didn't use oil, but doubled the bacon and used the bacon grease to fry the cabbage.  After it browned a bit, I reduced the heat a smidge and covered the pan.  Perfect!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!

We enjoyed this recipe  new year's day.  I had no idea my family would like cabbage so much, since we've never had it.  Every bite was eaten, and they wanted more.  Great addition for 'money' in the new year.

My mom made this when I was a kid, but she never wrote down her recipes, when she died it had died with her. I am so glad I found it.  It brings back fond memories as well as a wonderful taste.  It wasn't too oily for me, but I am southern and we grease everything to death...

This recipe diserves a five because it was very very tasty, and it was easy to make (much easier than boiled cabbage, but alot more fattening... lol)!  Anyways, I made this with "New Years Day Black Eye Peas" and "grandma's buttermilk cornbread"... this meal turned out to be a ten!!!  Everyone raved.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I like cabbage raw, and in cole slaw, but I hate boiled cabbage, so I was looking for a New Year's Day alternative.  I found it with this recipe!  As far as cooked cabbage goes, this wins the place in my cookbook.  I did use butter instead of veggie oil and probably a touch more sugar than I should have, but it was yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

My boyfriend asked me to make him some fried cabbage for dinner. O_o  Needless to say, the idea made my stomach turn, but I found this recipe and tried it anyway.  It was good!  I used a bit more bacon since he likes the flavor and a sweet onion with a little less sugar.  Between the two of us, we finished a whole head of cabbage!

This was really good... easy, fast and very tasty. I didn't use the full amount of oil and it was still pretty greasy though. I will cut back on the oil even more and I will fix this again! :-)

It was nothing spectacular but good comfort food. A great use for my cast iron dutch oven. Much less messy than my skillet. I will just continue to use my own recipe which is whatever I want to put in it with now need to follow a written recipe.

I've made this a couple of times now, using the suggestions others have made.  My family and I loved it.  A little Scotchbonnet sauce enhance it a bit, but isn't really necessary.  Highly recommended.

I made this according to recipe but I first cooked the bacon, removed the bacon and instead of adding oil, I used the small amount of bacon grease. I also added the bacon at the end and it was nice and crunchy!
And I cooked it for about 10 minutes and it was tender but with some crunch!!

I swapped out the bacon for some leftover ham I had in the freezer.  I recommend adding a touch of garlic and cajun seasoning for extra flavor.  It's a fave of my husband's and makes the best NYD tradition.

I gave this meal 5 stars because I I used the base recipe, but I added my own spin. If you want to make this your entire meal, I would recommend adding sliced kielbasa sausage. I also cooked my onions at the same time as the bacon.

This is sooo delicious!  I did omit the oil, used extra bacon and instead of adding the bacon back to it,  I threw in a smoked sausage and fried it up in bite size pieces. Took that out. Sauteed onions then added the cabbage and sausage into the pan covering it.  I stirred it occasionally until the cabbage was tender. I just prefer sausage with cabbage versus bacon. The bacon grease is the only part I used of it. There's nothing better than bacon grease when it comes to certain frying. It was so good!

Very good recipe. I left out the oil. The bacon drippings from the bacon is all that was needed. I added about 1/8 teaspoon of sugar to reduce the acidity of the cabbage.  I added a pinch of salt and pepper. Perfecto.

Turned out fantastic with a few alterations. Like others I admitted the vegetable oil and removed the bacon after it was cooked. To the cabbage I added about a quarter cup of beer. It gives it a bit of a Bavarian flavor.?

I did make one change.  I decreased the amount of vegetable oil and added a little olive oil. Added more bacon also!!! Mmmm bacon.
So easy to make and absolutely a tasty dish. 
The two of us devoured all of it at dinner.

We add red peppers, mushrooms, and some times shredded carrots to this. Then serve with some garlic shrimp or some smoked sausages.

Made this several times but with different meats and I must say bacon gives it the absolute best  taste.  I don’t agree with  the 5 minute cook time but that’s just  a personal texture preference.  Will make it again and again.

It was wonderful. No substitutions but did allow it to cook on medium high for about 12 minutes and then slowly cook for covered for 20 minutes while I finished everything else. Also amazing he next day for left overs.

For me, I thought it was strange to season the bacon and vegetable oil, so I skip that step as well as I did not use any vegetable oil. I fried 5 pieces of bacon until crisp and then I remove the bacon before adding the cabbage. There was plenty of bacon drippings left behindI to use in place of the vegetable oil. Then I season the cabbage and the onions, threw in a dash of red pepper flakes, and cooked it down until it was just about ready. I then added the crispy bacon back into the pan, with a tablespoon of butter. I mixed everything in and it turned out wonderful. I think if I had followed the recipe exactly I still would have rated it 4 stars, but the way I prepared it,  I believe it had better flavor

I made this as a side for baked white fish so I didn't use any bacon. I sauteed garlic & red onion in olive oil with the cabbage shredded on top. Added a little smart balance for flavor and added some fresh cilantro at the end. Served fish dinner with this as sauteed cabbage instead, and had carrots and sweet cornbread muffins.

I made this today with very few changes.  I used the bacon grease instead of veg oil.  And almost a lb of bacon (lb minus what we nibbled on before cooking) and added minced garlic while I was saluting the onions.  This is a great easy recipe that I will be using again.  Thank you.

It was really good. I used some of the ingredients and added a few of my moms secret ingredients. Cabbage are my all time favorite to eat and I LOVE them with hot sauce. I could literally eat a whole bowl or plate of them alone ! No bread !

Doubled the bacon and removed the bacon after cooking, then added it at the end so it would stay crunchy.   Used a yellow onion instead of white.  Also, doubling the bacon negated the need for additional oil.  This is my second time making it and I will make it again.  I omited a star only because of the modifications.

I would also be watchful of excess oil and fat and season generously, I found a sprinkle of Franks works great

I found this to be on the bland side but I like spicy food and food with a lot of gusto. I doctored it up quite a bit. It was pretty good after that but I'll most likely stick with a hot bacon dressing I use for a wilted spinach salad for this recipe.

Decent recipe as written. Needs more onion so next time I'll do one and a half or two. Also doesn't need any vegetable oil at all. The bacon yielded plenty of fat to cook the onion and cabbage. And the sugar isn't needed either because the caramelized onions and cabbage provide plenty of sweetness.

I had a head of red cabbage that needed to be used so, sliced that up with a sweet white onion, used bacon grease instead of vegetable oil, I am part of the Keto Lifestyle so no veggie oil for me, fried this up and oh so yummy.  Used a teaspoon of monk fruit sweetner versus the sugar as well.

Oh my goodness!  I just finished a bowl of fried cabbage, and it is so goooooood!
Because of others' suggestions, I added a TBSP of brown sugar.  I also reduced the liquid at the end and then added a few TBSPs of cider vinegar.  After that reduced, I dished out the cabbage and ate it with buttered whole grain bread.  Wish I'd had rye.
Anyhow, this will become a staple.  I love cabbage, so I sliced and chopped the whole thing, including its core.  Then I cooked it covered for close to an hour.  It was hard to wait, but worth it.

I absolutely HATED cooked cabbage almost all of my life until a church member introduced me to this recipe.  Now this is the ONLY way I serve it with the following changes: sliced smoked sausage instead of bacon, a bag of frozen peppers and onions, Zataran's seasoning to taste/tolerance (spicy!).  So good!

So good!! I used 1/2 tsp of coconut oil as I think it makes sautéed and fried veggies more robust than vegetable. I omitted sugar. Printing off to go in my recipe rotation.

This came out pretty good! I used 6 slices of bacon and held back some of the grease and used that. I did add some minced garlic and a splash of red wine vinegar.  Followed the cooking directions.  I would make this again for the cabbage loving souls in my family!

This was OK.  Somewhat bland.  Needs kicked up a bit with cayenne or red pepper flakes.  Easy and quick side dish.  Goes well with chicken.

Really good recipe!  We used 6 slices of bacon and no oil. Cooked it for 30 minutes. Crispy and delicious. We also removed the bacon and added it at the end. We added some garlic too.  Garlic makes everything better!  So does bacon!

Loved it!  I ,add it for my hubby's diet.  I diced and fried about 10oz center cut bacon, removed from the pan, and poured out all but a couple tablespoons of fat. I added a quartered and sliced Visalia onion and head of cabbage, also quartered and thinly sliced. I popped them in the pan and gave it a good stir. I added a bit of powdered chicken bouillon and a tiny

Growing cabbage in my garden and needed a recipe for my first head. LOVE this dish! Simple, easy, quick, and VERY flavorful. I did double the bacon though because, well,... I love bacon. Adding this one to my repertoire.

Very few changes,  cooked longer, no oil was needed, as I thought the bacon made enough. cooked bacon until crisp removed and cut into smaller pieces and added back to the dish when completed

Was tasty and interesting. Stayed true to original recipe, but will make some changes next time. Will go easier on pepper, perhaps use pancetta (and a bit more of it) than bacon, and perhaps a bit less vegetable oil. May also try some spices.

Although I used the meat and fat from a ham hock instead of the bacon, I can tell how good the bacon would make it as well.
I don't ever remember using onion for cabbage, but it really added to the dish.
A very simple, but a very tasty, side.

This was a HUGE hit with my family - no leftovers  The only adjustment I made was to reduce the amount of oil from 1/3 cup to 1T.  It was delicious & will become a regular side dish in our home.

This is my first time ever making fried cabbage. I added more bacon two cloves of garlic, onion powder, garlic powder, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and a little Cajun seasoning. It came out perfect. Will be doing this again.

I would rate as a 4 for now, as I would like to make a couple of changes next time. Yes!  It was a very tasty dish! ?? The next time, I will crisp up the bacon more before adding in the cabbage, and use about 3/4 of the amt. of oil. Need to adjust to see how this amt . goes. I may end up just using 1/2 the amount of oil the 3rd time. We really liked the cabbage as a side dish.

This was fantastic. I fried the onions with the bacon in the oil and after I added the cabbage and spices, I also added a can of Spicy Red Pepper stewed tomatoes with the juice and let  it simmer down until the juice was gone, a little longer than the recipe called for. The whole family loved it, served with Italian sausage. Thanks!

Will be making this again and again.  I modified slightly.  I used 6 slices of bacon because my cabbage was quite large .  I did not use the veggie oil , just cooked my bacon and used what grease that came off it.  Put my cabbage in larger pot and poured bacon dripping over it, the added a couple of tablespoons on water to deglaze the skilled then added it to cabbage.  I was out of onions, so I seasoned with onion powder, salt and pepper.  I simply over looked the sugar in the recipe and didn't add it.  I stirred/tossed until the cabbage was well coated and wilted.  I followed the advice of others and added my bacon towards the end of cooking the cabbage so it stayed somewhat crunchy.  I could have actually cut the bacon grease down a little, but none the less it was plain, simple, quick and low cost......delishious.

Loved this dish. I cooked the bacon first (cooked half a pack) and set aside. Fried the cabbage and onions in (half )the bacon grease. For extra flavour, I added soya sauce to taste and brown sugar to taste. I definitely cooked the cabbage WAY longer then 5 min. I like my cabbage softer. It was delicious!

Absolutely delicious!  I've heard since I was a child, that cabbage was my mother's only craving during her pregnancy with me, she ate cooked cabbage almost daily.  So far, I've never found any cabbage dish that I don't like, and in fact I'm the only one of my siblings who can even stand the smell of cabbage cooking.  This recipe is now I've of my favorites!

Delicious but I am a bit confused as to how to make the best version of this-- bacon kept in or taken out? lid on or off? vegetable oil or not? I guess I'll have to make it a number of times and try different things. definitely try it though

This is absolutely delicious. My brother hates cabbage but loves this. He requests it. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the recipe doesn't have enough bacon. I double or triple the bacon. And from the other reviews I'm not the only one who thinks so. I made it today for a family dinner. Yum

I have been making this recipe for years. Delicious as is, and sometimes we splash in some red wine vinegar for the last few minutes of cooking for extra kick. My favorite way to eat cabbage

I made this but cut the recipe in half, it was only for me and hubby. I poured out the excess fat, leaving just enough of the bacon grease for flavor. I used olive oil and cut the amount in half. This recipe is best eaten freshly made. We added a dash of quality balsamic vinegar to the finished dish and it was GREAT! That gave it an Italian flair and added a little more flavor! I recommend it for cabbage lovers and even those who are cabbage squeamish!

I use more bacon and I omitted the oil and used the bacon grease and some butter (to taste).  I like to cook mine a little longer, but that's also a matter of taste.  Delicious!   Sometimes I add some smoked sausage too...also delicious!

Great tasting, simple and quick recipe!  My crew loved it!   We are bacon crazy so I doubled the crispy bacon and added at the end to maintain crispiness.  Also poured the bacon grease into the cabbage.  Yum, Yum

This was wonderful!!  I used the bacon grease instead of adding grease to the pan.  When the bacon was done I removed it from the pan and tossed in the onions to caramelize.  Then I added the cabbage. I put the bacon back on top, and mixed none stop with tongs, flipping the cabbage to pull the caramelized onions from the bottom to the top.  I also added garlic powder to taste.  Once done (we like ours crispy and hot so maybe 5 minutes)  I drizzled white vinegar over the top so not to over power the flavor, one last toss with the tongs and we ate it up!

Have been enjoying this dish since I was a little girl at my Grandma's.  She was first generation Irish/American so I am not sure if the recipe came over from the old country or not.  The main difference is Grandma added egg noodles and mixed them in with the cabbage and bacon.  A complete meal in a bowl...protein, vegetable and starch.  When my kids were at home, this dish was always a big hit any day of the week and there was never a morsel left in the bowl.  My children are grown and they still love it as much as they did back then. (Sometimes I add a little sour cream on top of mine.  I like it both ways but the family prefers the original.)

I didn't use the amount of cabbage, so estimated the amounts needed in the rest of the recipe.  Cabbage is one of my husband's favourites.  He loved it.

This was very good I added a few extra ingredients to mine because I wanted a extra kick,  so I added a half of jalapeño pepper seeds included diced very fine. Some green and red peppers and a whole red onion and white onion too simple because I can't get enough onions. I also added fresh parsley and one scallion and a teaspoon of old bay seasoning for that extra spice. And because I love that bacon flavor I also used two packets of smoked ham flavoring by Goya so yeah I used the recipe more as a starter and kicked it up but it came out delicious.

this dish was delicious! I mostly followed the recipe except instead of 3 slices of bacon, i used 6; eliminated olive oil. Also instead of cabbage I used a coleslaw bag because of the purple cabbage and carrots.

Amazing!! My entire family loved it!! We are huge bacon lovers, so I used 5 pieces bacon and cut the bacon unto 1 inch pieces. It took a lot longer to cook, but the cabbage out of our garden had extra thick leaves. My husband said he could eat this a few times a week and never get tired of it!

Very good but had to cook for much longer than specified. Also make sure you cut you cabbage up well.

Our family never had this before. I wanted to try some different sides for the summer instead of the usual. My family didn't let me go more than a week all summer without begging for this!

This was absolutely delicious. I followed other reviewers advice and cooked 5-6 pieces of bacon and set it aside while cooking cabbage in bacon grease.  I used 1 TBS sugar. I also combined it with buttered egg noodles to make Haluski. Kids and picky-husband gave it two thumbs up. Easy, one pot meal!

This was absolutely delicious. I did tweak it a bit though. I used 6 pieces of bacon instead of 3..mostly because I accidentally burnt the first 3(whoops), I omitted the oil. I added some minced garlic and just a dash of cajun seasoning! It was seriously one of the best vegetable side dishes I've ever eaten. YUMMY!

Thank you, JDANX3, for a good recipe!  I basically followed the recipe as written, but doubled the bacon and did not use any oil to fry it.  I did find that it needed a couple splashes of apple cider vinegar and a bit more sugar near the end of cooking to suit our personal tastes.  Yummy served with turkey kielbasa and cornbread!

Made this for New Years and the whole fam loved it! I thought it was too oily but still really good. Followed recipe exactly. Next time I'm going to just use the bacon fat only to fry it in. Maybe add a little oil if needed as I go but I think it can be done without.

Delicious!  I followed the other suggestions and didn't use oil and cooked double the bacon.  Removed the bacon from the pot when it was done cooking.  I took just a bit of the bacon grease and sautéed the onions for just a bit.  Meanwhile, cooked the cabbage for a few minutes, added the onions in and other ingredients. When nearly done, crumbled the bacon into the cabbage mix.  Made some black-eyed peas to go along side.  Seriously delicious.

I cooked the bacon first, in the pot. Added the cabbage leaves, a pinch of sugar and other seasonings. Came out great. I believe omitting the oil helped.

Very easy, indeed! I didn't have the onion so I used the white bulb part of the green onions I had and added maybe1/2 tsp of onion powder. I used a wonderful Hormels Turkey bacon without much fat so I did use the oil recommended. We both...especially my very selective husband....loved it!

A great basic recipe for cooked cabbage.  Used about half the oil, not much onion and some corned beef.  Just frying the cabbage with oil, sugar, salt, pepper and about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar was a GREAT addition to an otherwise heavy meal.  Loved the crunch, texture and flavor.

This was very good, easy, & cheap.  I followed the advice from the comments, doubled the bacon and omitted the oil, added some garlic, celery seed and a bit of cider vinegar, also had to cook it a good bit longer than indicated, maybe it's because I had a large cabbage!  And I took the bacon out then added it back in at the end so it would not get soggy.

I used red cabbage instead of green cabbage.  I cooked 4 strips of bacon until they were super crispy & set them aside.  I sauteed the onion & cabbage in the bacon drippings with salt & pepper until wilted & slightly carmelized.  Once done cooking, I crumbled the bacon & added it to the cabbage & onions.  Really good.  I omitted the sugar as the cabbage is a bit sweet on its own.  I will make this often.

This was just like my MamMaw & Aunt Lula used to make.  Quick & easy way to get your husband to Love cabbage!  Like others suggested, I rendered bacon fat while cooking and omitted the oil.  We are a bacon loving house, so I added a few more pieces of crumbled bacon & placed that on top of cabbage after it was plated so the bacon would stay crisp.  This was a good way to use some of those tougher, outer green leaves.  Since we are empty nesters now, this was an easy recipe to make in a small portion so we didn't have any left over. I had planned on enough leftovers for lunch the next day, but my husband went back for thirds!  He's already asked when we can have this again!  Great dish for fall when fresh cabbage is plentiful.

Fabulous!  Served with Pork Chops with apples (found on allrecipes) and sweet potatoes.  Perfect southern meal.  I did drain the bacon grease off because don't like that much grease.  I made it just like the recipe and wouldn't change anything about it.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe.  The only change I made was I used bacon bits because I didn't have any bacon on hand.  I will definately be making this again!!!

I love this cabbage recipe because it's so easy and because the taste is wonderful. It's good with or without the bacon. It's so very fast to make and goes great with so many main dishes. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this tonight and it is delicious, who knew the missing ingredient in my cabbage was onions! I did add 3 more strips of bacon and some garlic, (we love garlic), but I bet it didn't even need it! Thanks

I had to make this without bacon, because I didn't have any. I used a little garlic powder in the vegetable oil and made it the rest of the way suggested. This was AWESOME. Even my husband who doesn't like veggies loved it. I bet it's even better with the bacon.

I have made this twice now. Once without bacon and once with it and both time it was excellent. It is now in regular rotation in our house! We had it with perogies and sausage. The perfect comfort food!!

on a scale of 1-5, i'd give it a 19!  sounded good, but I was completely blown away by the taste.  Took other reviewer's comment of increasing bacon to 6 slices.  when I prepared it, I found I had 7.  Recipe was not clear about draining bacon grease...so I just left it in the pot, followed the recipe as listed.  Made this for just my wife and I.  We polished it off completely.  Definately has found a home on a regular basis.  Felt sorry, though, for the main course.  It had to find a back seat to this.  My wife and I kept saying WOW!!!

I used andouille sausage instead of bacon. There is no reason for vegetable oil, just use enough bacon fat, or sausage. Around these parts this would be called "smothered" cabbage. It was mighty good with some red beans and rice, baked sweet potato, and cornbread. Mmmm!

I changed this by only using the bacon grease and draining off all except for perhaps one Tbsp.  I then removed the bacon and added the onion, then after 2-3 minutes added the cabbage, waited 1-2 minutes and added the cabbage, salt and pepper and pinch of sugar for love.  I added the cooked bacon and placed gnocchi 1 on top of cabbage along with Chicken-Fried chops submitted by sydny from this site.  What a great rounded off meal this was.  Try it, you will enjoy it.

Wonderful recipe! So simple, so quick, so tasty!!! The only alterations I made were I used 2 tblsp of virgin olive oil to cook the cabbage and onions in. Once they were tender and almost ready to serve I used real bacon bits and sprinkled over the top, then tossed in to warm throughout. Perfect! (And no having to deal with any bacon grease). I served this with some good old canjun red beans and southern cornbread! My husband thought he'd died and gone to "redneck heaven"! Sure was good! Thanks for the great recipe!

YUM!!!  I didn't have any onion, so I browned the bacon in it's own grease, tossed in the cabbage with pepper and sugar.  Covered, stirred occasionally and enjoyed every bite!

I saw this recipe on the day I wanted to cook it but had no bacon in.  However I did have some sliced ham which I sliced thinly and used instead of the bacon.  I left the ham in and other than that cooked it as directed and it was lovely.  My husband was very impressed by how tasty it was.  I cooked it with lamb chops and mash.  Great combo.

My boyfriend loved this recipe.  It was my first time making fried cabbage - I never liked it as a kid.  I loved it - I'll definitely use this recipe again.  Next time I will probably use 2-3 more slices of bacon.

Really great cabbage recipe.  I tried this one for New Year's day and the family loved it.  Even my son that "doesn't like cabbage" said he would eat this one again!  I didn't add any of the extra oil just used the bacon grease that was needed and I added extra bacon because we like it.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good. I cooked my head of cabbage in a wok.  I had to cook mine for a long time, 30 minutes, to get it to the consistency I wanted: really wilted and a little carmelized. I just like mine 'cooked down'. 
Also, maybe because I cooked so much, the bacon fat wasn't even needed because I could not taste the flavor of it.  I didn't add the bacon back to this because I didn't want to soggy bacon with the wilted cabbage. So, I'll stick to EVOO in the future, no bacon. Salt, fresh ground black pepper and sugar provides the results I like.

Delicious and easy. I followed the recipe exactly and agree with others that it was a little too oily.  Next time I'll just use the bacon drippings.

This recipe was great. I cooked it for our New Years Day dinner. I added about 3 more slices of bacon and also another 1/4 cup of sugar because I like my cabbage sweet. It turned out great and the family loved it. We will definitely have this again.
