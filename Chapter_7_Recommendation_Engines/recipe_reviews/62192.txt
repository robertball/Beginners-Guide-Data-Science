This was a great way to use my fresh-picked strawberries!  The nectar keeps well in a pitcher in the fridge.  Whenever I feel like having a tasty drink, I pour some nectar over ice and top the glass off with gingerale---yum!

This is a good way to use up strawberries. I had to add Splenda to this, however, as it really wasn't sweet at  all. I also ended up pouring mine back into the blender and blending it with some crushed ice to chill it. I suppose if you started with chilled ingredients, the finished product might be cold. Keep this in mind, as this type of beverage tastes better cold (at least in my opinion.)

I made this with apple cider. I like the suggestion of also adding ginger ale!

This is quite thick, so I'm assuming it's supposed to be added to something else to make a drink. I added it to ginger ale to make a pretty, refreshing non-alcoholic drink.

I added a bit of sugar, just because I like my drinks a bit sweet but it was actually really good without the sugar.

when i made this everyone liked it. it was pretty good but almost to much strawberry. instead of a quarter cup apple juice i used a half cup. in my opinion it was better. it was warm. if you dont have time to wait for it to chill in the fridge, add ice.
