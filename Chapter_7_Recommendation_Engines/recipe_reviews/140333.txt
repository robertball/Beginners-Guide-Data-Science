I like this recipe, but  I have had some problems with this recipe in that the eggs aren't done enough or they are too tough.  To solve this problem and make them perfect I first set the ramekin with the butter and cream only in simmering water.  When the cream is hot, I break the eggs into it and put just a little cream on top of the eggs with the cheese.  Then I place in the oven.  This process helps to cook the eggs evenly and gets them just right.  Hope this helps anyone who has had the same problem I've had.

Yum!  Perfect for breakfast.  I am not a huge breakfast eater so I cut the recipe down even more from the one serving.  I used 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of cream (well, sour cream as I don't have cream) then just sprinkled on salt, pepper, chives, and the parmesan.  Didn't even measure those.  Mine took longer than 12-15 min to bake--more like 20, and I had the oven on higher bc I was preheating for a bread I'm making.  Otherwise, delicious and easy.  A good way to make sunny side up eggs without frying.  Served with pita bread and it was great.  Could easily be made for a number of people using muffin tins.

This is a great recipe!  I tried a variation by substituting mozzarella for the parmesan, red onion for the chives and topping it off with a thin bits of smoked salmon.  Wonderful combination served with a slice of tomato.

maybe I should not be rating this since I change a lot of thing but it was out of necesity, I wanted something different with eggs for this morning and didn't have all the ingredients. I only had eggs and heavy cream, I used saute onions instead of chives and cheddar cheese instead of parmesan, I also use someone else adviced and cooked the eggs in a muffin pan one egg per cup everything elese the same and it turn out soooo god. I really liked how easy it was to make all those eggs and everyone gets to eat at the same time warm eggs. definately doing again next time using chives and parmesan.

Yummy, but this is what an egg coddler is for.  So much easier and more energy efficient to put these ingredients into an egg coddler w/ a screw-on top, and boil to desired doneness in a pot of lightly salted water.  Why did they stop making coddlers anyway??

Made it exactly and it was greatl! It was easy to make. It was a bit bland, I recommend increasing the onion and parmesan cheese.

This is one of my favorite breakfast recipes! I've made this myself for years, and this is nearly identical to my own recipe (I've always used leeks instead of chives). Even my picky husband loves these!

I've started making these regularly for breakfast.  I have changed some things from the original recipe along the way.  I read a reveiwer who used sour cream instead of heavy cream which sounded interesting, so I tired it and like it a lot better. I also skip the parmesan and chives and instead use dill and paprika. I liked it the original way as well though and it still warrants five stars. Delicious!

Extremely easy and yummy.  Didn't have chives, used onion instead.  No ramekin, used small tea cup.  Turned out just fine.

I've made these several times now.  I use another reviewer's recommendation of using a muffin tin (just make sure to spray it with Pam first).  The versatility is endless - you can experiment with combinations of cheese, herbs, and a touch of meat (e.g. chopped bacon) - and the presentation is very nice.

Yummy eggs!  I had no cream or chives so had to interpret the ingredient list liberally.  Used 1/2 T butter and about 2 t milk instead of the cream and baked them in my jumbo sized Fiesta mugs since I don't have ramekins.  Before adding the eggs, I put the mugs in the microwave to melt the butter.  Topped them off with just salt, pepper and parmesan.  My eggs were freshly laid ones from the farmer's market and pretty big so they took a solid 22 minutes to bake in the oven.  They turned out great- the whites were almost completely cooked and the yolks were cooked on the bottom and set on top.  The whites were SO creamy!  I don't know if it's because of the recipe or because the eggs were fresh.  In any case, I'll definitely make this recipe again.  Probably will do the milk-butter combo for the cream because I rarely have cream on hand, but I will try to add some chives next time (depends on whether they take off in my garden).

This was ok... I personally like cooked whites and runny yolks, but I had a hard time getting the whites to solidify enough, and by the time they seemed ready the yolks were totally dry. Perhaps I cooked them too long- several extra minutes because the whites seemed too runny. I really did enjoy the flavors together (chives are wonderful with eggs-definitely use them!), but I think I will try less baking time if I make them again, or heat the ramekins a bit to help the whites along......ok, tried it again using the first reviewers advice and it was so much better that I had to add another star. Heating the ramekins in a hot water bath, then adding the eggs and letting them sit a minute before removing them from the water and cooking them per instructions the rest of the way helped the whites solidify and the eggs were definitely ready at 12 minutes-I wouldn't go a minute longer than that, because the yolks were cooked slightly more than I would like. this method made all the difference, thanks Joan B.! Oh-I used two small ramekins for this recipe-making two servings, one for my boyfriend and one for myself. We both enjoyed them very much, and the presentation is so nice in the ramekins.

I LOVE Shirred Eggs. they are truly delicious. I discovered them many years ago after reading James Bond order them in Casino Royale and HAD to try them. I have been in love with them since. they can be baked to the consistency you prefer for fried eggs and enhanced in ways fried eggs cannot. for those who prefer a firmer set it is easily achieved by the simple office of a wider, more shallow baking dish. while those who like a softer set can simply use a deeper dish. makes ALL the difference in the world.  Shirred Eggs are a wonderful classic and easy dish.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but was very disappointed. Even though I baked the eggs for longer than suggested, they still came out undercooked and watery. My husband, who loves eggs, did not care for these. I will not be making this again. Sorry.

I'm putting this for a 5 as to not negatively affect the overall rating, but I don't think it was a 5. But, I had to substitute a lot of it - including sour cream for heavy cream, mozzarella for parmesan, and onion powder for fresh chives. I also had to bake for close to 20 minutes. This worked out, and my husband liked it a lot. I, however, thought it was strange. But, I don't like runny yolks, so that could be the answer. The mozzarella and sour cream were fine subs - the onion powder I'd skip in favor of fresh chives next time.

Tried this recipe today and loved it. I didn't have any heavy cream, so I mixed some sour cream with a little milk to the right consistency. I did use the other ingredients. I didn't measure the cheese and chives, but just sprinkled on until it looked right. I wish I would have made three. Looking forward to trying these with different herbs and cheeses. I did bake them a little longer as I don't like runny whites. I also had bacon and buttered French bread toast with them. Great breakfast.

I made these today and they were absolutely delicious!!!  I measured the cream but did everything else by adding what I thought would be good.  I must say it also took my oven 20 minutes and I have a really good oven.  I would make this again and for company!

Seldom have cream on hand so used ricotta cheese instead.  Had to bake for 18 minutes (my stove is very accurate)then finish in microwave for 15 seconds.  Whites were set and yokes a little runnny, like we like them.  Absolutely delicious!!!  Used free range eggs I bought from the Mennonites so they were extra good.  Had always heard of Shirred Eggs but didn't know how they were made...am glad I found out!!!

The only change I make is I cook them at a higher temp so they finish in the 12-15 minutes. I usually cook mine at 400F and they are perfect at the 14 minute mark, whites are cooked, yolks are a little runny. Great recipe and a rich and creamy change from the usual over easy. These feel a little like luxury on Monday mornings without adding extra time to breakfast.

Love this!!! So delish. I added bacon; put each egg in a separate ramekin with 1.5 tsp of cream. Then I placed the ramekins in a pyrex dish with hot water on the bottom and put it in the oven. It took longer to cook - more like 20 minutes or 25. But the eggs came out perfect.

Great!  I switched it up a few times and it was amazing every time.

Added some garlic during the cream step, used bleu cheese one time, feta another... rave reviews!

This was absolutely HEAVEN. NOTE: I used fat free half-n-half and it came out perfectly. That was the only change I made, other than using organic eggs.

This is very good as written, and an interesting change of pace for breakfast.  I believe it may have been better suited to our tastes to use sour cream in lieu of cream, and a cheese other than parmesan.

I'm low carbing, so I was looking for something new to do with eggs for breakfast. This was very yummy! I loved the texture the egg whites took, creamy and soft and the yokes were perfect to my liking, mostly set (I left mine in for 18 minutes). The whole dish is wonderfu, as is!

Overall a great recipe!  I use a mini cast iron skillet to bake in the over for 11 minutes until the white cooked.  I also added shallots and cooked bacon chopped and used Cheddar cheese on top.  Delish!

Gave this 5 stars because hubby loves it!  It is really rich and depending on the size of the eggs, I too, have had occasional issues with getting the eggs done.  But all in all, I make them whenever I have cream in the house!

I found that the eggs needed more like 19 minutes in my oven. Then, after the 3-minute rest, the yolks were runny and whites were just barely set. Absolutely the most delicious eggs I've ever had! Will be making this again, for sure.

These are the things I had on hand to cook with: half and half, green onions, asiago cheese. Those were the only changes I made except the cooking time. After 12 minutes the whites were still raw so I upped the temp a bit and cooked another 10 minutes. That cooked the yolks almost completely though and I'm a runny fan. That being said the flavor is fantastic. Next time I'll adjust the cooking time some more and hopefully can find the right balance. Such a great alternative egg recipe!

This recipe has become a standard in my house. Sometimes instead of 2 whole eggs, I use a tablespoon of heavy cream, 3 egg whites and only 1 yolk.

For being such an easy recipe, this was pretty tasty!  Mine needed to bake longer also.  I used light cream, since that's what we had in the fridge.

Very good and very easy!  Would be great for a brunch.  I used a muffin tin as recommended by another and they turned out perfectly.  It needed something, not sure what though.  Maybe more parmesan?

Perfect!  I did bake in muffin tin (1 egg in each muffin cup).  Cream on the bottom, warm up in oven for a minute and then add eggs, etc. Baked for 15 minutes and let sit for a couple.  Just perfect!!  Thank you.

Very good and simple to put together.  I left in oven for 15 minutes, but the whites weren't as set as I would like, so I am going to leave in about 1 - 2 more minutes next time.  Ovens vary, so will need to check occasionally.

Best way to make an egg! If my understanding is correct, this is a French recipe. They call for gruyere. Which I used, and was amazing! I didn’t have chives or green onions so I chopped up some Italian parsley. I also had a little spinach on the side. My toddler detests eggs and she couldn’t get enough of these!!

This recipe is super easy, gets cooked in the oven so minimal mess and is tasty.  Also I can see substituting chives for baby spinach.  The eggs are very similar to poached eggs so I am going to make shirred eggs for my next eggsbenedict brunch leaving behind those runny whites when dropped into boiling water.

YUMM!  As a kid I did not like runny yolks.. you think I would have re-evaluated this position as an adult but I had not.  We have our own little flock of spoiled feathered friends that are giving us lots of eggs so I have been on the search for different egg recipes.  I tried this today with one egg in a ramekin  and it was wonderful.  I love the salty parmesan  cheese and the runny yolk and the rich cream.  I will certainly make this again.  Next time I will see if any of the 5 kiddos like it.

Good, easy recipe but I will definitely cook the eggs at the lower end of the time stated next time.  The yolks were very well done and I would have preferred them a little runny.

My grandmother made these every Sunday but baked them for about 40 minutes and served over toast (we call them "baked eggs"). Sprinkle with paprika for a little color.

Great flavor!  You must use the Parmesan as the flavor will be a bit off without it.  It was rich and creamy without being overbearing.  I put green onions and parsely on it after getting it out of the oven as I didnt have chives.  Served with a spring greens and grapefruit salad.

Best eggs ever. I added some fresh dill and garlic chive before cooking and it was out of this world. I like my eggs a little runni so I cooked it for 8-10.

This could not be any easier!  I have also made these with caramelized onions on top, and it tasted very yummy.

We substitute Worcestershire sauce for the chives in the recipe, which is wonderful.

I didn't enjoy theese.  To me they tasted almost chemicaly.  I used margerine instead of butter so maybe that's why.

Good! I used leeks diced fine instead of chives, but they were very good.

These took a little longer to set up.
Better than sunny side up!
