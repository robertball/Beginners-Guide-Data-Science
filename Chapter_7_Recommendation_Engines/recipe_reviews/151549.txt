First, only had to cook 60 minutes, and 55 would probably would have been okay. Made this when trying to use buttermilk that was about to be out of date.  We ate it warm, so just drizzled the glaze on each individual slice.  Good, moist cake, but not in the "decadent" category.  The peanut butter and chocolate are not intense flavors. The glaze defnately helps provide that extra sweet factor. Hubby ate two pieces, so it must be good!

Pretty good. Made a couple of changes out of necessity. No buttermilk so I substituted with 3/4 c milk + 1/4 c sour cream. Used a basic caramel topping and it was ... okay. I also used butter instead of shortening.
