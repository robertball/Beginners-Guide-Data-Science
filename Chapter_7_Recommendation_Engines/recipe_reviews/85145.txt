Never mind the chicken and brussels sprouts I served this with - I could have eaten this all by itself! Five stars for being a good basic recipe to use as a starting point for your own creativity, with endless possibilities. What I liked best was not having to boil the orzo first, drain it, then proceed. I sauteed chopped cremini mushrooms along with the onion and garlic in both olive oil and butter. For a little more dimension in flavor and creaminess I used a mixture of chicken broth, cream and a good glug of white wine. In addition to salt and pepper I seasoned this with some fresh thyme. Delicious!

For a much creamier pasta, add 1/2 cup thick cream, simmer for at least 3mins., before tossing the other ingredients.

YUM!! I omitted the onion, and added a dollop of sour cream, a splash of milk, a Tbs of butter, chicken, and veggies and this was an awesome dish. Will make again. Thanks!

This didn't have the creaminess of a typical risotto, but it was still very yummy! I added some parm and a bit of fresh chopped raw spinach. I made a whole pound and my family devoured everything but a couple of tablespoons. Thanks Cynthia!

Not a risotto but a good pasta side.  The liquid/orzo/time ratios are the key elements.  Everything else is open for play.  I used half chicken broth, half white wine.  Added fresh tomatoes (while cooking) and fresh basil and butter (at the end).  Served Parm cheese on the side.  Nice to be able to put it on and leave it while you're doing a quick steak/chicken breast/fish fillet.  My tip:  I grate the garlic on a micro plane (instead of mincing) and throw it in with the onion (no chunks of burnt/bitter garlic).

I actually cooked the orzo in 2% milk (with a little white wine and water thrown in for good measure).  Added onion, a can of stewed tomatoes and some frozen peas. Top with parmesan.  This stuff is so good.  I served with a basic shrimp scampi and some green beans.  'Twas very well received :)

This was very good and I was able to make it using ingredients already on hand.  I did modify the recipe by using half chicken broth and half evaporated milk.  I added a little more milk to the orzo as it was drying out.  I also added parmesan cheese to the top.  Definitely a keeper!

omg this was heavenly!! i've never made a homemade risotto because it sounds too labor intensive, and i'm more of a quick and easy type of cook :) well this was both, and turned out wonderfully.  i've also made it will mini pearl pasta which had the same great results.  mine is never dry, has great flavor, and goes with a lot of different types of main dish.  thanks for a great stand-by recipe!

Really good and simple My orzo was cooked in less than 15 min. and parm cheese would be a nice variation

I took the advice of some other reviewers and added butter and basil to the recipe, but I did NOT add any cheese. The orzo had a delicious flavor that complimented the salmon I served it with, without being overpowering or sticky. Great recipe.

wonderful way to use orzo, and it makes a ton. probably more like 6-8 servings. to make this taste more like a traditional risotto, i did add a couple of tablespoons of white wine at the beginning, and added a bit of butter and parmesan cheese at the end. i stirred it quite a few times throughout the cooking to release the pasta's starches  and make it creamier, so i needed to add a bit more liquid. i think i used about 4c chicken stock. in the end, this tasted very much like risotto to me, just easier. a good base recipe, would be good with added veggies or herbs, too.

I loved this recipe, but DH was not a fan.  I think this was easy and it was creamy and delicious.  Definately something I would like to keep in the recipe files.    I did add a splash of white wine for flavor.  Thanks for the post.

VERY GOOD!!  We loved this!  I made this early in the day and simply reheated it in the microwave for a couple of minutes just before serving.  I changed the process by sautéing my onion in the EVOO, then adding the orzo and sautéing until golden.  Then I added the garlic and sautéed until fragrant; added my broth, covered and simmered.  My orzo was done in a lot less time, so watch it carefully.  I added a little chopped fresh parsley for color.

We love this! Great fast and easy side dish that is sure to show up at the table often. I will say that as written this makes a ton probably closer to 6 1/2cup servings.

Just delicious and very, very easy. Like some others, I added a splash of white wine and finished with about 2 TBSPs of heavy cream, topped w/ parmesan. I will be making this again.

This was a quick, easy side dish.  The flavor was less than overpowering.  We did add some parmesan cheese as others have suggested.

This recipe was so good and so easy! I did add broccoli to it at the beginning with the onions and garlic and added cream and parm in the last 2 minutes of cooking but it was just so good! A very good substitute for a risotto if you don't have the time to make it.

DELICIOUS! I skipped the onion, but I wouldn't next time. I used two cups of chicken stock (reconstituted cube), one cup white wine and half a cup of cream. Add the cream near the end. I could eat this by the bowlful!

Love this recipe.  As close to rissotto as you'll get without all the fuss!  My husband loved it too.  Thanks for a great idea : )  

Personal touch...stirred in two tablespoons butter at end after turning off heat with about 3 1/2 oz freshly grated parmessan.  Served topped with freshly grated parmessan on top.  DELICIOUS!

This was delicious!  I cant compare it to being a good mock of risotto since Ive never made it before.  But I would have to say it should be very close since how creamy and light this came out to be.  So good!  I used beef broth instead of chicken and this would be so good to add different flavors into it like parmesan cheese and other veggies.  Great side dish and I will definitely make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very Easy and Very Delicious! Followed the recipe with the exception of deglazing the pan with approx. 1/4 cup of white wine and then proceeding. I'm not sure where I messed up, but this did not come out as "creamy" as I had expected but it was still excellent and everyone really enjoyed it. A nice change from our regular risotto recipe, plain rice or pasta. This will be a new "go to" for a fast, easy and very tasty side dish. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe reminded me very much of the Mushroom Orzo on this site, which I love!  Definitely not similar (IMO) to risotto, but delicious and much easier to prepare!  I did add some chopped cremini mushrooms along with my onion and garlic and also added some white wine in with my chicken broth.  I chopped some fresh thyme and stirred in at the end, earthy, yummy and oh so good!

Great recipe! Super fast, easy, and yummy! I took another reviewers advice and added 1/2 cup of cream w/ the stock. I also added mushrooms w/ the onions and garlic and a hand hull of parm cheese near the end. Also, as w/real risotto I had to had a bit of stock near the end. Risotto w/out the fuss!

I used butter & olive oil combo, then toasted the orzo in the pan for a few minutes.  Then I started adding broth and added my garlic & onions.  One the orzo was cooked, I tossed some fresh spinach in to wilt. I sprinkled some asiago cheese on just before serving.  Delicious side dish for my grilled chicken.

A new family favorite. I left the kitchen to log on and tell everyone that this dish is as simple and easy as it claims AND it is simply delicious. I always try the original instructions first before changing it around - next time I will try adding mushrooms as suggested. Parmasan cheese made this delicious dish pure bliss. I was sad to put the leftovers up - not that there were a lot to put away. My sweetman stopped me before I could put them up for thirds. :-) Thank you Cynthia Clark!

Love this recipe! Use it a lot - sometimes with rice instead of orzo or wine instead of chicken broth. It's a great base recipe.

I love orzo pasta & risotto, but I do not like the time it takes to make risotto, so I tried this.  Not the same, but very good.  I added a little half & half, chopped basil & parsley at the end.  My crew ate the whole thing!

Tasty but not creamy. It was easy and used things already on hand. Nice for a weekday sidedish.

Fast, easy and good.  I added Pecorino and a good splash of cream at the end. Used semi de melone instead and added peas.

Easy to make but a little bland.  This is a basic rice pilaf recipe, and I think it's better with rice.  It needed quite a bit of salt at the table, and it was better with some parmesan on top.

so this was an easy alternative to traditional risotto, and my kids and hubby loved it,.  I used 1/2 the amount of chicken broth and 1/2 heavy cream and a splash of white wine.  I also threw in a cup of mixed veggies and a dab of butter and some parmesan cheese at the end and it was delicious.  thanks for the great recipe.

Gave it 4 stars only because I added some butter, mushrooms, and basil to the recipe. Otherwise did everything else exact. It was great side dish.

I love risotto, and half of what I love is the anticipation of it, all that stirring and smelling while you wait. However, I do not have unlimited amounts of time, and in a pinch this has substituted nicely. I have even made it with some of my favorite risotto add-ins like mushrooms and crab.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I added tomatoes to it er some reviews.  It was okay.  The second time, I just used the ingredients listed, except I substituted 1 can cream of chicken soup for 1 of the broth (per another review).  I liked it much better this time around.  It wasn't bad the first time - it's just the tomatoes change the taste a lot, I think.  This time I got more of what I'd anticipated when I read the recipe.  I also added a sprinkle of parmesan near the end of cooking.

I made this cause I had orzo but not a lot of other stuff so I needed a simple recipe.  This was awesome!  I gave it a four because I doctored it up to a five.  Started with 1 tbs good olive oil and 1 tbs butter.  Added italian seasoning and a touch of cream.  It was awesome my boyfriend loved it, and that's all that's important to me!  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this tonight and it was a hit.  I added some butter, a little milk and sourcream at the end and it gave it that extra creaminess I was looking for.  With the leftovers I added some Velveeta and more milk and it was very good as well and will make a great side for tomorrows dinner.

I added a bit more garlic to begin, and used College Inn white wine and herb culinary broth. Added julienned sundried tomatoes and half-and-half toward the end.  I then transferred it to a shallow casserole dish, sprinkled with green onion and a mix of shredded mozzarella/provolone and parmesan, placed under the broiler for a few minutes.  I thought it was delicious!

I wanted risotto today but was feeling lazy and ran across this dish. It wasn't risotto but wow! This little dish is big on flavour. I didn't have orzo pasta so I took some spaghetti and broke them into orzo-sized pieces. I added a small bit of cream and some parmesan cheese when the pasta was almost finished cooking. This came out so delicious! It's a great base recipe. I served with grilled chicken and an extra sprinkling of parmesan cheese. Made a quick and easy lunch with minimal effort. Thanks for sharing.

Tasty and easy.  I added a couple tbsp of milk whenever it got dry.  In total, probably used about 1/2 cup milk.  Will be part of my rotation to serve alongside Parmesan Chicken 1 from this website.  Next time, I will add wilted spinach for a balanced meal.

Agreed that it's not a risotto, but is still a nice side dish.  Very easy to play with and adapt to personal taste.  I doubled the garlic, used 3/4 chicken stock, and added 1/2 cup of half n half during the simmering process.  Added chopped fresh spinach towards the end.  I took advice and topped with parmesan cheese.  Now either I put too much parm on top, but I found it to be too rich.  So if you use any sort of cream/milk, careful on the cheese.  Will make again!!

I just made this recipe for dinner with some simple chicken and salad and it is awesome! Very simple and there are a thousand ways you could change up the flavor with different herbs, stocks, wines, ect. This will definetely become a staple in my household. The only thing I did differently is that I halfed the recipe & I stirred in 2 Tbs of unsalted butter in the end to help with the creaminess. It turned out great!

Easy and my 8 year old daughter loved it! I made it as written and my daughter and I really enjoyed it, then I reheated the leftovers with cream and about 1/2 cup parmesan cheese along with some herb sauce mix from the gravy section of our local grocer. Hubby loved the leftovers! Is it risotto? No, but it was good and easy as stated. It is a little "creamier" if you Overcook the orzo (usually served a bit al dente) a bit. Well, we  liked it anyhow!

I used 1 T butter and 1 Tolive oil along with one can of chicken broth and a chicken bouillon cube w/water instead of just plain water. I also added some grilled chicken and frozen peas at the very end. Very tasty!

This made a lot more than 4 side dish servings. Also, it wasn't creamy at all. It tasted like orzo cooked in broth with onions and garlic. I was looking for something creamier so next time I'd add cream and butter at the last few minutes. It's good, just not what the description said.

I made this based on the reviews that complained it's nothing like risotto because I don't like risotto but my husband loves it.  I thought this would be a nice compromise.  Well, I can't say I wasn't warned by other reviewers, but this was NOTHING like risotto.  Nor was it creamy as described  in recipe description blurb.  This isn't to say the recipe was bad...a little plain but still good.  It's just not at all what it was advertised as.  I'll probably make this again with a few additions (parmesan cheese, more onion and garlic).  It certainly was quick and easy.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe... certainly I agree with the other posters, it isn't classic risotto... but it is still a delicious side.  I added 1/2 cup shredded farmer's cheese (all i had.. i would've used parmesan) and also some herbs (rosemary, marjoram, oregano).

Great alternative to everyday rice or pasta.  Very quick and tasty.  I did add a handful of parmesean cheese at the end to make it extra creamy.  Will make this again, and play with add-in's.  Thank you!

This is my go - to side dish.  I can get it started and then let it simmer while I prepare the entrée.   My family loves it.  It is NOT risotto.  And that is ok.  The only thing  I add is freshly gated parmesan.  I stir in about a cup just before serving.

I was looking for an easy side dish and this fit the bill.  To have so few ingredients the pasta had great flavor!  I added a little fresh parsley to the end of the dish.  It didn't in anyway taste like a risotto to me, but, it was a good pasta side dish that would work with most proteins.

I was looking for a simple side dish to go with Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style recipe that is a long time favorite. Made per directions this is good but sprinkle with finely shredded parmesan and it's excellent. We had friends over for dinner and they loved it.

Only thing wrong with this recipe is the name, otherwise if you just want to make really good basic orzo pasta - this is a great recipe.   No it is not at all like risotto... but you could simply add cream, butter and parmesan cheese at the end and it would be more like risotto.   Anyway,  basic orzo it is and it's better than the instructions on the package.  Add some spinach or other small vegetable and you've got a nice side dish.    To use up the leftovers, I added some bacon, half & half, butter and parmesan cheese and it was excellent.

Delicious and so easy. It's not quite risotto but out of all the orzo recipes I've tried, this one is our favorite! It's a nice alternative side dish and goes well with chicken, salmon, shrimp, etc.

I did the recipe as written with these additions ... 1 jar of Giorgio mushrooms, 4 TBSP of unsalted butter, and 1/2 cup of Kraft grated Parmesan cheese (like for spaghetti) plus salt and pepper to taste. It was VERY good. I didn't realize how much 2 cups of orzo makes though ... That's a lot more than enough for 4 people, serves more like 8. There weren't enough mushrooms. Next time I will cut the main recipe in half and add the rest as I did. Very yummy!!

This was a good side to the Greek Chicken I made in the crockpot. I used the chicken stock from  the chicken, which was seasoned with lemon and oregano. 

The orzo was perfect topped with the chicken. Next time I'll add some lemon zest to the orzo to give it more of a kick.

Good start for a quick side dish but definitely not creamy like risotto.. Maybe next time I'll take others advice and add a splash of white wine and some cream. But it is quick and easy!!

This was good, though I wouldn't say it is all that similar to a risotto. You definitely want to kick it up a bit. I used a mixture of chicken broth, white wine and lemon juice for the liquid and mixed in some Parmesan at the end. Great side for salmon.

I have made this recipe a few times and love it.  My family eats it up.  It is great because my husband is lactose intolerant so I love the fact it doesn't have milk, cream of anything soup, or cheese.  I also love to sauté mushrooms with the onions, and I've added stir fried chicken and vegetables for a whole meal in one dish. It's had great reviews around our table.  It does make a lot when you add chicken and vegies, so you may want to cut the recipe in half.

The recipe wasn't bad, but it lacked the creamy texture of traditional risotto.  I cut back on the chicken stock and used a splash of white wine. I also added parmesan cheese and sour cream.

Loved this recipe.  I omit the onions however, my Italian grandmother's rule was to never mix onions and garlic - use one or the other, but never mix them, so I didn't.  The dish is marvelous!

This recipe was great, except it turned out a little dry for my taste.  That was quickly fixed by adding 4 cups of broth instead of the 2 cups directed.  I also added some thyme and dill because we served this with fish.

I made a few changes for my likings, since I use cubes to make the broth, I replaced 1/2 cup water with 1/2 cup evaporated milk, fried some onion, and since I added too much oil, I added some flour to the oil to make "roux" (even though you have to use clarified butter for that) And some garlic powder/black pepper to it and some cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it more. Took me only 8 minutes to do this :D Will make again and again and again and again and so on and so forth

I made a similar mock risotto with a few changes to this recipe, turned out pretty good :) 
 I use left over jasmine rice (cooked) and I added a green squash diced small with onions & garlic sautee plus I added a bit of milk and butter at the end for some extra creaminess since my rice was already cooked and wouldnt create as much starch. 

Thanks for the idea :-)

This was only ok, and I even used 1/2 chicken broth, 1/2 cream to make it creamier.  It is a good base recipe, but needs a lot of work to make it really good

I thought this was very good! I didn't mind that it wasn't creamy. I thought it was incredibly delicious. So delicious, I couldn't help eating leftovers cold! I also made this with vegetable broth for a pescatarian friend and it turned out pretty well!

Mixed reviews for recipes always intrigue me, and since I have been looking for more orzo recipes thought I would give this one a try. I made as directed except added freshly grated parmesan just before serving and it was very good. There are several brands of orzo, and I found the one with the smallest size. In other recipes, I have found this tastes more 'rice-like' and it was the same with this recipe.

I made a few changes and ended up with a wonderful, vegetarian main dish.
I added a 1/2 cup heavy cream and a pinch of safron during the simmering step and at the end, I added 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, everyone was in love with it.

This was just ok.  It tasted like noodles in broth.  I added some ricotta cheese (because I had it on hand) and some parmesan to help give it some flavor.  It's a good start, just needs some dressing up.

This actually turned out rather creamy. I used about 1 cup broth and added some butter and shredded cheese at the very end. Was actually very good!

Good and easy recipe.  I can't compare it to risotto, because I've never had it.  But it was a very nice pasta dish.  I left out the onion and added more garlic.  Went well with Creamy Pesto Chicken.

This made a nice side dish, but I think it needed a little more flavor.

As "mock risotto," it's a failure, because it's pasta, not rice.  Why not just call it "tasty orzo?"  As a pasta side dish, it's nice.  You didn't do anyting wrong, FLORIDAMAMA.  Risotto isn't hard at all, it just takes a fair amount of time to stand there stirring it, and sometimes we don't have an extra 20 minutes.

Although my husband liked it, I thought it was very bland. Very easy though, and would probably great with some stir-ins like sun-dried tomatoes, or fresh basil.

This mock risotto was excellent.  I cut the recipe in half since it is just my husband and I, and I also added a little smoked paprika to it.  YUM!
