Excellent moist cake . I replaced one half  of the oil with applesauce (three quarter cup applesauce  three quarter cup oil and instead of just folding in lightly packed shredded  zucchini I folded it in  then muxed it at medium speed with my mixmaster for one to two minutes to make the batter. 
Then I replaced  the walnuts with chocolate chips since I do not care for walnuts. Very good when frosted with the Zucchini brownie  icing recipe on this site.

Very moist and yummy cake!  Only used 1 cup of oil-- that was plenty.  Substituted chocolate chips for the nuts.  Baked in a bundt pan at 350 degrees for 50-55 minutes and dusted with confectioners sugar.  Superb!!

Fantastic fudgey, moist cake. I love it for two reasons -- it's versatile and easy, it even works in a high-altitude area, like Denver where I live. I use white whole wheat flour (King Arthur and Wheat Montana sell a white spring kernel variety, which is lighter and sweeter than regular whole wheat, but just as nutritious), and it still tastes like regular chocolate cake. Also, I can trim the fat without it tasting low-fat.I replace 1/2 cup to 1 cup of the oil with applesauce or mashed pear (use a small hole grater on an apple if you don't have any applesauce). I've made this recipe three times now, and when I'm not being health-conscious, I love it with chocolate glaze. I make a quick one with cocoa powder (mix 2 TBS oil, 2 TBS melted butter, 2TBS Karo syrup, 2 tsp vanilla, 6 TBS cocoa powder, 1.5 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 cup milk or more depending on your desired consistency).

Just an update on my review from last year.  The cake is still excellent and everyone still loves it, but I wanted to let you know that it is also now a blue ribbon winner!  I entered it in the chocolate cake category at our county fair.  I frosted it with a vanilla powdered sugar frosting and it took FIRST place.  Just thought you would like to know.  Thanks a gain for the terrific recipe and new family favorite.  P. S. My husband is very finicky about vegetables even when they're in breads or cakes and he really loves this cake.

I made this cake for my friend's birthday party and I copied some of the changes that the other members suggested. I  cut the oil to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 cup of apple sauce. And instead of using all, all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup of all-purpose and 1 cup of whole wheat. I also cut the sugar in half because the applesauce is sweet so that would make up for some of the missing sugar and then I added a tsp of vanilla. Anyway, when I brought this cake to my friends birthday party, everybody raved about it! Even my friend who hates all vegetables and fruits LOVED it (she still doesn't know that it was a zucchini cake because I haven't told her yet). AWESOME cake :)

My organic farmer brought me an impressively large zucchini this week.  Yikes.  This recipe was exactly what I needed.  Quick, easy, used lots of the green stuff, and tasted GREAT.  I used a bundt pan (65 minutes to bake) and made a simple chocolate glaze for the top.  Heavenly.  The kids devoured it, and as they helped me make it, they knew exactly what was in it!

Don't make this cake before reading this review!!!! The cake was wonderful, but please don't add 1 1/2 cups of oil! We all agreed that 1 cup was just right - too much more would have resulted in a dense, greasy cake. No need to use applesauce for some of the oil, either. This cake was perfectly moist with just 1 cup of oil. We also left out the nuts, which was just fine. I used olive oil, as I do with most of my baking, and it was great. We all agreed the cake tasted better room temp the next day rather than warm out of the oven. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made these into cupcakes (comes out to about 24--remember to shorten the cooking time though) and they were super good!  Only one person could tell there was zucchini in it (that's only because she got a piece of peel).  I would definitely make this again!

This cake was extremely moist; however, it had a somewhat bitter flavor.  Too much cocoa powder?  I will try it again and use 2/3 cup rather than 3/4 cup cocoa.

Great Cake!  and Easy to make too!  Great in bundt pan rather than 9x13 cake plan.  No icing required.

I made this cake the other day and was very impressed with how DELICIOUS and MOIST it was.  I cooked it in a bundt cake pan (had to add an additional 5 minutes due to the pans' depth) and topped it with a Confectioner's Sugar Glaze.  I received lots of compliments and would definitely make it again!

When you plan ahead at the grocery store for your week's meals and you don't end up making all the meals you planned, you are left with stuff you intended to use and didn't - like zucchini. I was hell bent on using it one way or another and this cake proved to be a wise and delicious choice.  I made this as cupcakes, 1/2 recipe, 12 cupcakes. The cinnamon/chocolate combination didn't appeal to me, so I left the cinnamon out, adding a half teaspoon of chocolate extract instead. (You could also add vanilla if you like but I don't think it's necessary here) I also skipped the nuts this time around.  Deep, dark, rich and intensely chocolate, you would never know their base was zucchini.  You don't see it, nor do you taste it.  Not too sweet, which made them perfect for a gob of chocolate "Ganache I," also from this site. Worth buying zucchini for the sole purpose of making these again, rather than making these just as an excuse to use zucchini up!

FAN-TAS-TIC.  I added a 1/4 cup more sugar (based on some reviews stating it was "bitter"), used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar,  half whole wheat flour and 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil.  Also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  What I especially love is that this just tastes like a truly decadent chocolate cake, not a cake with less oil AND vegetables! I also like that it doesn't have a strong spice flavor, as many zucchini cake recipes (containing cloves, etc.) tend to do.  Perfect with a cream cheese frosting for my son's 2nd birthday!

Excellent cake. I used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 3/4 cup of oil instead of 1 1/2  cups of oil. I just wanted to cut down the fat. My family loved it.

This cake was really good, very moist and pretty chocolatey. Good way to use up summer squash! (used a combination of zucchs, festival, etc) The squash made it moist but were not at all noticeable in the final cake.  A couple tips, some mentioned by previous reviewers -  1. Be sure to ring out the squash after grating. I put mine in a strainer and pressed out the excess water.   2. Dont overcook it. Cook it just until a toothpick comes out mostly dry. For me in a 9x13 pan, took 40 minutes and was perfect.  3. It is not very sweet. I paired it with a simple chocolate buttercream frosting - 1 stick butter, 2 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa powder and 1/3 cup cream. With the frosting, it got a "Wow!" from my 7 yr old nephew and a group of 3-7 year old boys eagerly gobbled it down! Would not have been sweet enough on it's own for kids.

Sure seemed like a lot of oil, so I did 1 cup oil, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. It still seemed like a lot of oil--maybe next time I'll flip-flop those measurements.  I topped it with chocolate cream cheese frosting: 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, 2 1/2 c. powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/3 cup cocoa powder.

We loved this cake!! I followed a couple of suggestions made in other comments. I added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and baked it in a bundt pan. I also drizzled it with cream cheese frosting.

I thought this cake was OK only. It was moist but really only because it had a LOT of oil and eggs, not so much for the zucchini, which seemed to be incidental. It isn't a dense cake, just has a moist texture, but fatty moist rather than wet moist. I didn't care for the cinnamon/chocolate combo. I'd rather add good real vanilla. I did throw in 3/4 c. mini chocolate chips which was a nice addition. I probably won't bother with this cake again, at least not with the cinnamon. It isn't terrible, just not what I really care for.

A really deep, dark, moist cake. Recipe says bake in a 13x9, picture shows it in a Bundt. I used a Bundt pan and didn't frost or glaze. I reduced oil to barely 1-1/4 cups and sugar to 1-1/2 cups, and I'm sure I could have used just one cup each and it would have been fine. I also put in only 2 cups of zucchini, because that's all I had. Used Hersheys Special Dark Cocoa. An excellent recipe that does not have to be followed to the letter. My family really liked it. Dh was going to take it to a work event. but once he had two pieces, ended up taking something else so he could have this cake at home. If you really love chocolate, add mini chocolate chips for a complete chocolate experience.

Until a couple of weeks ago, the idea of having veg in my cake totally repelled me. But my sister had been begging me to bake a carrot cake for her birthday, so despite my reservations - I did and then I realized I had beem prejudiced all along, coz it tasted delicious! So I thought, heck, maybe I'm missing out, so I decided to make this zucchini cake for my boyfriend. He's always saying that my chocolate cakes are too dry, and this one seemed like it would be moist. I gave it a try, and  - this is the best chocolate cake I've ever baked! So moist and fudgy! I'm definitely gonna be making it again!

This was very moist and delicious!  I didn't use walnuts, but did add choc. chips-hubby said with chips, it didn't need frosting!  Next time I make this (tomorrow) I will omit cinnamon, as it wasn't bad, but wasn't necessary either. (for the flavor we are looking for)  I also used 3 PACKED cups of zucchini. Try this cake!

This was awful.  My husband and I took one bite and threw it away.  Very bitter and not sweet at all.  I have other wonderful chocolate cake recipes....this one is quite bad.

My friend made this recipe exactly according to this recipe and it was so good and not too sweet!  I always try to make recipes a bit healthier when possible, so I substituted in 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cup of reg. flour for the 2 cups of flour.   I also sub. 1 1/4 cup natural unsweetened applesauce plus 2 Tbsp veg oil instead of the 1 1/2 cups oil.  (The thought of using that much oil just makes me feel sick!)   Mine had to bake for at least 1 hr. and 15 minutes.  I did not add the nuts since my girl has a nut allergy.  My version was more moist and slightly more sweet, and well worth the extra baking time, it didn't need any frosting!  :)

Super moist but not enough chocolate. Next time I will add 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter.

Loved these - I only added 1 1/2 cups of sugar and I had a ripe banana, so I threw it in for the added sweetness. I also took advice from someone commenting and grated two apples to make 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup oil.  We used chocolate chips - the kids LOVE them and so do I!  This is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a family picnic and it was delicious; not a crumb was left over.  The only changes I made to the recipe were that I added a half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips at the end, and used pecans instead of walnuts.  This is a wonderful recipe that I will make again and again.

I work in an elementary school and the cooks make this recipe for the kids... Of course, they just call it "Chocolate Cake." Anyhow, the kids LOVE it and the leftovers go to the staff lounge, where we fight over the last pieces. They do not put frosting, just dust some confectioners sugar, and it's delish!

I changed this recipe quite a bit and had a lot of success. I'm fairly health-conscious, and I figure that if I'm going to make something with zucchini in it, why would I detract from that by adding so much oil that it makes it disgusting? One and a half cups seems far too much for a cake that already uses zucchini to retain moisture. I also very much dislike sweet cakes, and thought the two cups of sugar would be too much (I don't understand the people who think it's not sweet enough!). This is not meant to be a "milk chocolate" cake. It is very dark, which is how I like my chocolate cake.

The changes I made included halving the oil and replacing the other half with milk, using half the sugar, using all purpose whole wheat flour, omitting the walnuts, adding a couple teaspoons of vanilla and using a bundt pan. It turned out fabulous, and was barely sweet with a really dark chocolate flavour. After the changes I made it was not fudgy and instead turned out light and fluffy; no one noticed that it was made entirely with whole wheat flour. I could almost imagine it as a breakfast cake. If you only have a taste for milk chocolate though, this is not for you.

Hope this helped!

I made this cake gluten-free for my husband's birthday and it was awesome.  We loved it and I gave a piece to my non-gluten-free friend and she raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I made the following substitutions:   I)  I used 2 cups of Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free All-Purpose Baking MIx instead of wheat flour.   II)  I added 1 tsp. of flaxseed meal to substitute for the 1 tsp. of xantham gum that Bob's Red Mill recommends for baking with the GF mix but I suspect that the cake would be great without flax or xanthum, etc.   III) To lower the fat, I used 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  (I used Trader Joe's gravenstein applesauce as it's so tasty but it does have some added sugar.)   IV)  I omitted the nuts.  V)   I mixed powdered sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled that on the top of the baked cake as my husband doesn't care for frosting.

I've made this 3 times in two weeks! It's amazing. Instead of 1 1/2 cups oil, I did 3/4 cup oil and then 3/4 cup apple sauce. I also added chocolate chips & walnuts (about 1/2 cup each). So moist and yummy...this is a keeper !

This cake is awesome.  I have made it 3 times and get raves.  Made this healthier by using dark cocoa and also  substituted about 1 1/4 c. (or more) of the vegetable oil with unsweetened applesauce & the rest used olive oil.  I also added 1 t. of vanilla.  And instead of walnuts I used 1 c. of dark chocolate chips.  I baked in a bundt pan & iced with cream cheese icing (8 oz cream cheese & 1/4 c. butter creamed, then stir in 1 c. confectioners sugar & 1/2 t. vanilla).

Good cake. It was fluffy but the top was a bit crusty, almost like a brownie. Sweet enough to be enjoyed without frosting.

Oh WOW, this was good!  However, I'm only giving it 3 stars, because I made quite a few changes based on food-allergies and other reviewers' suggestions.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups of oil (dear God!), I used 1 cup of pureed pumpkin, 1/4 cup vanilla soy yogurt and 1/4 cup canola oil.  I used spelt flour instead of all purpose (wheat-allergy), reduced the 2 cups of sugar to 1 cup, and substituted 3/4 cup of gluten-and-dairy-free chocolate chips for the walnuts (we're not nut-fans).  I baked it in a bundt pan for 55 minutes, and the results were spectacular--rich and moist without being heavy or crumbly.  I poured the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (with a few modifications) from this site over it once it had cooled, and it was just awesome.  I've been trying to make the perfect chocolate cake for years, and this is definitely it.  Thank you so much for the excellent base-recipe!!!

I made this for my daughter's 4th birthday. It was AMAZING!!! I followed another reviewer's advice and used 3/4 C applesauce + 3/4 C oil. Also I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of walnuts since my son is allergic to nuts. This one is sure a keeper :)

Very yummy. I substituted 1 cup sugar with 1 tsp stevia sweetener, and reduced the oil by 1/2 cup to 1 cup total. Instead of frosting I topped with chocolate chips and crumbled walnuts. With the sugar reductions, my diabetic hubby can have a small piece.

These were DELICIOUS! I made mini cupcakes subbing a cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of white, and a 1/2 cup apple sauce for 1/2 cup of oil. Unless told, no one realized there was zucchini! Mixed peppermint extract with some vanilla icing, and topped with soft peppermint candies. Great little holiday treat!

Awesome moist cake!!! Cut the oil to 1 cup and used zucchini brownie frosting from site and used mini chips instead of nuts.  Awesome!! The only thing i'll say is I wanted a chocolate chocolate cake and it could've done without the cinnamon.  But I still liked it with the cinnamon!!! Plus I got to use some of my bumper crop of zucchini. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this according to the recipe but added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I frosted it with buttercream frosting and loved it! Next time I might try it with chocolate frosting(maybe chocolate chips too) to make it even richer.  This is a very moist cake, and the cinnamon flavor is nice but I might leave it out next time as personal preference.  Will definately be using this recipe again, thanks for sharing!

Made this twice - very moist!  Used a bundt pan & baked for 1 hour 10 min. Used 1 c. whole wheat/1c. white flour; 1 c. brown sugar/ 1 c. white; substituted applesauce for oil.  Delicious!  Didn't bother to ice, but I'm sure this would be great!

I've been looking for a great chocolate zucchini cake recipe ever since I lost mine over 10 years ago.  This recipe is very quick and easy and the end result is delicious!  I usually make the recipe in a bundt-type pan and use a chocolate glaze frosting over the top.

I substituted half of the oil with applesauce.  I also added chocolate chips to the batter.  It turned out moist and decadent.  Great recipe.

I personally love this cake recipe!  It's a real crowd-pleaser.  However, I don't add the walnuts, and instead of frosting I add chocolate chips (1 bag) and brown sugar (liberally) to the top before baking!  The chocolate chips get really gooey and the brown sugar adds a nice crumble crunch to the top!  It's VERY tasty!!!

Excellent recipe!!! I made this today for my brother's birthday cake. I omitted the nuts as half the family is allergic to them. I also substituted applesauce for the oil. It doesn't take away from the flavor or richness but does get rid of quite a bit of the fat. Everyone commented on how good it was.

I was looking for something fast and easy dessert to make with the ingredients that I had on hand which included a big zucchini from the garden.  Wow, did I ever find it!  This cake was awesome...wonderful flavor, super moist and no need for frosting.  I just sprinkled a little powdered sugar on it after it had cooled.  I served it with ice cream and some Sander's hot fudge (if you're from Michigan, you know how yummy that is) and it was a hit!  This cake also was a great conversation piece with trying to guess the "secret" ingredient.  By the way -- I didn't change a thing.  The recipe was perfect.

Love this cake!  Very moist and chocolatey.  Followed some alterations and only used 1 cup oil, and added 1 tsp vanilla, and subbed chocholate chips for the nuts.  Grated the zucchini and mixed everything in my KitchenAid.  Cooked in a bundt pan for 65min.  I didn't even hide from my kids that there were zucchini in it.  They didn't care and you couldn't even see the zucchini when it was done baking.  The whole family really enjoyed it.

UPDATE: MY MIL TOOK THIS TO WORK TO SHARE WITH HER (AND MY HUBS - THEY WORK AT THE SAME OFFICE) CO-WORKERS. EVERYTONE COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS ZUCCHINI CAKE AND SEEMED TO REALLY LIKE IT! This was allright. Not my favorite cake, but decent nonetheless. My neighbor recommended I try this recipe. She has been making this very cake for years and is the SAME one she has made for me many times - and one homemade gift I always look forward to (who knew???)! I LOVE cinnamon, but felt there was FAR too much of it in this cake (the cinnamon taste overwhelmed everything else). I envisioned a moist, chocolately cake, but what I ended up with was a slightly sweet cake with a STRONG cinnamon taste. Even the chocolate fudge frosting I topped my cake with seemed oddly out of place (while chocolate and cinnamon generally complement each other, they didn't this time). NOTE #1: To cut some calories, I subbed HALF of the oil called for with unsweetened applesauce. NOTE #2: My neighbor forgot to tell me that she subs pumpkin pie spice for cinnamon. Had I known this, I would have done the same. :( This definitely improves the flavor, IMHO (and is the reason I like her cake SO much more than mine). If I make this again, I'll DEFINITELY use pumpkin pie spice, leave out the walnuts (personal preference), skip the frosting and dust with a sprinkling of powdered sugar instead. Thanks for sharing, Sandy! My in-laws seemed to enjoy this and were given leftovers to nosh on all week. :-)

Yee ha! This was soooo good...and loved that there was a veggie in it! Noone knew or could tell. I only used 1c of canola oil instead of the full cup and a half. Next time I will sub half of 1c. for applesauce....who needs all that fat and calories....but taste-wise was delicious....also subbed mini choco chips for the nuts since the kiddos dont like them. Yummy!!!

FANTASTIC recipe!  Thanks to reader reviews, I substituted half the oil with applesauce, so 3/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce.  Substituted Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips for the walnuts.  Topped with a decadent chocolate frosting using 3 squares unsweetened chocolate melted in a double boiler with 3 Tbsp. butter.  Cool 5 minutes; transfer to mixer bowl.  Beat in 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. espresso powder, 2 tsp. light Karo syrup.  Add 3 c. confectioners sugar and continue beating.  Add 2 to 6 Tbsp. milk, adding one Tbsp. at a time to desired consistency.  Beat until fluffy.  Spread on cooled cake.  I brought this to a friend's dinner party last night; she made her Italian MIL's Chicken Parmesan.  A great cook; she HAD to have my cake recipe!  This will be a summer dessert tradition to use all that garden zucchini. Thanks, Sandy, for sharing your wonderful deliciousness!

This is a great cake even without frosting. I couldn't bring myself to use all of that oil so I used 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, and 1/2 cup Greek honey yogurt. I also added about 1/2-3/4 cup of chocolate chips instead of frosting it. The cake was dense and super moist. This will definitely be my 'go to' recipe when I have extra zucchini around :)

My family and I did not like this recipe in the least.  The cinnamon/chocolate combination was unpleasant.  The cake was also dry and did not rise well.  I will not make this again.

I have made this recipe several times and my whole family loves it! Great use of leftover garden zucchini. It's moist and not too sweet. The only change I've ever made is using a applesause/oil mix if I have applesauce in the house. Either way it's still great. I've also baked it in a bundt pan at 350 degrees for 1 hour then topped with a store bought vanilla glaze

Outstanding!  Made this for work and several people asked for the recipe.  The only difference I did was I pureed my zucchini ( texture issue)  and used half a cup applesauce and 1/2 c. oil

This was really good and moist! I frosted with my favorite chocolate icing: 6TBSP margarine, room temp, 2/3 c cocoa powder, 1 TBSP vanilla, 2 1/2 c unsifted powdered sugar and 1/3 (or a little less) c milk. YUM!!!

This is a very good cake, but I did make some changes to the recipe (thanks to previous comments!)

I reduced the oil by half, and used 4 cups of shredded zucchini.  I also used whole wheat flour, to make it healthier, and it worked just fine.

I didn't have nuts or semi-sweet chocolate chips, so I used milk chocolate chips, and I think that was a mistake.  They were too sweet - dark chocolate would have been much better.

I also think that the sugar could probably be reduced - the cake turned out almost cloyingly sweet and I'm pretty sure that a sugar reduction would fix that.  I'll try it next time.  

Overall, a good recipe that I will try again (with a few more changes!)

I am a huge failure at homemade cakes from scratch of any kind so I put my batter in muffin tins hoping for cupcakes but expecting muffins. But what I got was a delicious cross between a moist cake and a fudgy brownie! I only rated this 4 stars because I used a generous 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of melted butter (I like the flavor of butter more than oil) instead of the oil. I think that the whole 1 1/2cups of oil (or applesauce or butter) would have been way too much since the zucchini is so moist. I used half dark chocolate cocoa powder, half regular, and I think that really gives it a good chocolate flavor. I didn't care for the nuts in this because I could still taste the zucchini somewhat. Next time I make this ill use chocolate chips instead of the nuts and id reduce the sugar by half if I ended up putting a frosting on top of some sort, they were plenty sweet as is! Thanks for sharing

4 stars only because I don't follow the exact recipe. So good! I've made it a couple of times, and even made it as the base cake for my kids birthday cake. I do the following alterations: I use 1/2 cup oil + 1 cup of sour cream instead of the full oil amount. Also only use 1 cup of sugar, and omit the cinnamon and nuts, but I add 1/2 a bag of mini chocolate chips. It is not too sweet, extremely moist, and chocolatey. I think the chocolate chips definitely add that extra goodness. You can't tell there is any zucchini in it.

I've made this recipe twice - first time without any changes which was really good, second time substituted 1/2 Cup Brown Sugar for White Sugar and 1/2 Cup applesauce for 1/2 Cup Oil.  The second version was "over the top" good!  Topped it off with chocolate cream cheese frosting - fantastic!  This is a permanent keeper in my recipe file!

This is a fantastic recipe. I admit I was not expecting much, just a way to use up some extra zuc, but the whole family and friend ate it up!  Based on some suggestions here I used a bit less cocoa powder, applesauce for 1/2 of the oil and choc chips instead of nuts.  Baked in a bundt pan and it tasted like a Costco choc chip muffin, but so so moist!  Would be great with frosting, but totally does not need it. Making again today to take camping this weekend.  Delicious!

This was a wonderful recipe. Easy, ingredients on hand, and the moistest chocolate cake ever! I used the vanilla glaze recipe from this site and drizzled it over the cake (which I made in a bundt pan and baked for 1 hour at same temp listed) and it was the best. Have alot of choc.zcake recipes and this one is by far the tops!!!!

I admit I had my doubts about this recipe as I was putting the weird-looking zucchini-filled batter into the pan, but the cake is VERY tasty with no discernible taste or texture of zucchini. Moist, mildly sweet, chocolatey... what more could one want?  I made this in a bundt pan (greased and covered with cocoa - not flour) rather than a 9x13, I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I probably used more zucchini than called for (one giant - maybe 4+ cups).  I will absolutely make this again.

Yum! Very easy to make, incredibly moist. It could have been a tad bit sweeter for my buds but that's a simple fix. I used a bundt pan, it looked beautiful. I topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze the first time but tried Hard Chocolate Glaze the second time. I totally prefer the Hard Chocolate Glaze, not too sweet but very rich!

This is the best chocolate zucchini cake I have ever tasted.  Very easy to make..so moist and a great chocolate flavor without being too sweet.  I put this on the table at work at 9am and it was gone by 10:30.  I will make this again and again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

Great cake topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze by Ginger found in Allrecipes.com.  I baked it in a bundt for 1 hour and like other reviewers, substituted chocolate chips for the nuts.  Also found that 1 medium-large zucchini grated with my food processor gave me the 3 cups necessary for the recipe.  I did decrease the cinnamon by half just for my preference.  I've now frozen 4 bags of grated zucchini in 3 cup amts just for this recipe.

A very good moist cake.  I just thought it wasn't chocolately enough so the second 
time I around I added a cupful of chocolate chips to the batter instead of the nuts.
Very tasty!

I made this recipe and brought it into work along with a pan of Chocolate Zucchini Cake IV. This was my first time making these recipes, both were made in 9" x 13" pans, baked for 50 minutes and topped with homemade cream cheese icing. This recipe won hands down. People enjoyed how moist it was and the walnuts were a nice touch (from the other recipe which was somewhat dry and did not call for nuts). I personally enjoyed this recipe as well and will use  it from here on out!

Needs no frosting!  This is a great cake!  I followed others' advice -- I want to taste chocolate in a chocolate cake, not just sweetness and fatty frosting.  I cut the sugar in half to 1 cup.  To cut fat, I used unsweetened/natural applesauce to replace half the oil (i.e., 3/4 cup applesauce, 3/4 cup oil).  I replaced nuts with chocolate chips, but that was just cuzza the nutty anti-nuts in the fam.  I used a bundt pan and baked it for about 30 mins at 350, and then 15 more at 325.  Skipped the frosting and just sifted powdered sugar over it for elegance.  Looked and tasted sensational.  Moist, chocolately, and simple.  Bring it to any coffee or tea, or any get-together.

OH WOW! Absolutely "LOVED" this! Even my pickies loved it! Loved that it was not to sweet, because the cream cheese icing brought it home. Did cut back on the oil by 1/2 cup and was really nervous when it came out of the mixer a congealed mass, but stuck with it until the zucchini was folded in. Then had to start fending off the helpful"testers"! Will definitely move this to the front of fav's. And I am starting to look forward to husband going in to the garden again!

Substitute 1/2 of oil with sour cream, and you will be in heaven.  If you want to turn this into cupcakes, cook at 350 for 18-20 minutes until toothpick comes out clean.  Makes 36 if cups are 2/3 of the way full.

Amazing cake.  Rich chocolate taste, dense cake and a ridiculously easy recipe.  Like others, I subbed choc. chips for the nuts (preference).  I also added more zucchini than called for (1 cup more! Trying to get rid of some excess squash).  It didn't make a difference at all.  I've also made it with yellow squash with equally excellent results.  I love this cake and give the recipe to anyone who grows a garden.

This recipe is great if you want to use up some of those zuchinnis growing out back. I made this with a few changes (1 cup applesauce/no oil and chocolate chips instead of walnuts), and it was moist and tender. However it lacked in chocolate flavour and the cinnamon was not a pleasant taste. After a second go at this cake, i added some melted chocolate to the batter, some prepared instant espresso, omitted the cinanamon and replaced with pure vanilla extract and glazed the cake with a shiny chocolate glaze when cooled. All the changes made for a completely different cake but now suits my family's tastes. Thanks for a good base recipe.

Incredibly fudgey and moist! I used 4 extra large eggs, 1 cup of oil and 1 cup of applesauce, chocolate chips instead of nuts, and just 2 1/2 cups of zucchini (although the full cups were jam packed, so it may have been 3 cups loosely filled). I baked it in 2 9" round pans for 35 minutes and iced it with chocolate cream cheese frosting from this site. I told the people I fed it to that there was a secret ingredient and asked them to guess what it was. It took them awhile--they only figured it out when one of them found a little piece of peel. Next time I might peel the zucchini so that they won't end up in the cake, because the rest of the zucchini kind of dissolves so you can't tell it's in there!

Like another reviewer suggested, I cut the oil to 1 cup and it still turned out fantastic! I topped it with Hershey's chocolate icing (recipe on their baking cocoa canister.) Next time, I think I'll ice with buttercream or peanut buttercream. Thank you for this recipe!

I am giving 5 stars but I did have to change it for my purposes. I replaced the cinnamon with vanilla. I do think the cinnamon would have worked here but since I was going to frost with strawberry frosting I decided on omitting the cinnamon and adding vanilla. I also decreased the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup as there was complaints about bitterness. Other than that I follwed to a T. I used two 9" cake pans and bake time was 35 min. I frosted with real strawberry frosting from this site and the result was divine. Everyone said it was 'the best cake they've had'.

Really yummy!!  Subbed 1 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1 cup of the oil and chocolate chips instead of walnuts because family doesn't like the nuts.  Didn't frost it at all.  Extremely moist and flavorful!  Great way to use the abundance of zucchini in the garden!

Utterly fabulous! Like other reviewers, I was a bit shocked about the amount of oil, but I followed the recipe as given and it turned out amazing! Moist and fudgy  without being greasy. I used extra light olive oil. The only substitution I made was choc chips for the walnuts. The second one is in the oven right now!

I really like this cake. It is just like one my grandmother and mother used to make when I was a child. The cinnamon chocolate combo (although not my favorite mix of tastes, yet a different and fun mix) in this moist cake brought back fond memories. Thanks.

What a great cake!!! I added a tsp. Of vanilla out of habit. I only had one cup of oil. I baked it in a bundt pan instead. I frosted it with the chocolate frosting recipe from the Zucchini Brownies on this site. It is delicious. Very moist and the cinnamon is so nice.

I was really looking forward to this cake and I'm so surprised it got such great reviews. This is terrible as is. I would not make it again. It lacked so much flavor. Definitely moist, but no flavor. I think there is way too much cocoa and its making it bitter in taste. I am going to have to figure out how to make it sweet - I will likely have to add a cream cheese icing to it ... or something. So disappointed. I cannot imagine how this won a blue ribbon anywhere unless it was in front of people that do not have tastebuds or like bland, bitter baked goods.

Moist and chocolatey! I used half applesauce and half olive oil.  I used two skimpy cups of raw sugar and omitted the cinnamon.  I frosted it with powdered sugar with cocoa, coconut oil, vanilla and milk.  This is a keeper!

Oh, this is such a wonderful cake!  The chocolatey aroma fills the house!  I would not omit the cinnamon; it does not overpower the cake, just gives it an unidentifiable complex flavor.  I added a cup of chocolate chips and replaced half the oil with applesauce.  The cake is moist and rich and slices beautifully.  For a generous amount of glaze I melted 6 ounces of bittersweet baking chocolate with 4 tablespoons of butter in microwave; added a bit of agave nectar to sweeten slightly.  YUM!

I have made this recipe a few times and the first couple times I grated the zuccini a bit to large for my taste, I was able to bite into zuccini. I just baked it for a friend today. I grated with 1/2 cm thick grates and I couldnt find a single piece which I prefer. I used olive oil instead of veg oil couldnt taste a thing. I chopped up strawberries and crushed the walnuts on top. Gorgeous!

This was AMAZING!  I did two substitutions though--NO OIL.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup applesauce in place of the 1 1/2 cups of oil.  Instead of the cinnamon I used Allspice.  Other than that, followed everything to a T.  Amazing Amazing Amazing.  Will definitely make this again!

A good cake. As with any zucchini cake, it tastes best if you let it sit a day. I threw in a handful of milk chocolate chips, because I had some to use up. It added a nice texture.

Excellent. I have made this recipe 3 years in a row late in the summer when the zucchini are in season. We are not nut fans in our household so we omit the nits. Very moist and does not require any frosting. I have made it with 3/4 cups shredded coconut instead of nuts and it was very moist. Can't lose with this recipe.

This cake is amazing.  I made it and brought some to work-everybody loved it.  My one son is very picky and only likes brownies-he loved it!  I only replaced 1/2 of the oil with applesauce and left out the nuts.  Frosted with a cream cheese icing.  Thank you for a GREAT recipe!!

Very yummy, rich, moist cake (almost 'brownie-ish').  I used this recipe to make cupcakes and everyone loved them.  I used a brown sugar/caramel frosting which was a great choice.  My only complaint is that they are a tad too oily...only use one cup of oil to fix the problem.  Thanks for the ticket to 'YummyVille'.

I usually try to make recipes the way they are written before I leave a review, but I just could not bring myself to use so much oil! I substituted one cup of the oil with buttermilk, and it came out beautifully moist. I also left out the cinnamon, swapped one cup of sugar with one cup of mini semisweet chips, then I frosted it lightly with vanilla buttercream frosting. Delicious! Please try this, you will be pleasantly surprised. I will surely make this again and again.

LOVED THIS. The kids loved this, and it received rave reviews from all who tried it.   I gave it a cream cheese frosting and it was perfect!!!

The cake was perfectly moist and not too sweet.  I don't think anyone even suspected that zucchini was in it!  Will most definitly make this again!

super moist and chocolatey, I added a splash of vanilla and cut back on the sugar a bit and used half the oil. to replace the oil, I used about a cup of shredded apple, but you could probably just use a little more zucchini. I iced it with a super rich chocolate ganache made with real cream and coffee liqueur. to die for.

I have too many yellow crook neck squash, so I was wondering if you could replace the zucchini in bread and cake with yellow squash (seeds removed) instead. So I tried it with this recipe. Wonderful! You couldn't even see it or taste it, but it was wonderfully moist. The 1 1/2 cups of oil bothered me so next time I make this recipe I'll be using a combination of oil and applesauce instead. Thanks for helping me get rid of some yellow squash.

This is the first cake I ever made from scratch. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday, for a finicky group of eaters. They realized there was something different in it, but no one guessed it was zucchini. It turned out great; very moist and flavorful, and I feel good that it's at least a little healthier than the typical chocolate cake.

I've rated this 4 stars as I think the amount of oil does make this cake a big greasy. Could easily be reduced to 1 cup by adding some applesauce or milk. I'd be tempeted to throw in a load of chocolate chips too for more of a real chocolate hit.  It's very moist and quite a fragile type cake. Not too sweet and can carry icing or a glaze well. Refrigerated it should keep a couple of days nicely and freezes well.  I added 4tsp of cinnamon and 1/2tsp nutmeg. It was still subtle.

fantastic! i changed the recipe a bit by using 3 eggs instead of 4, 1 cup oil and half the amount of sugar. i couldnt beleive how well the zucchini blended and hid into each slice. my husband didnt even realise it had zucchini in it and my mother pointed at the walnuts thinking she'd spotted the veg :) will definitely make again...perhaps each week till the zucchini season runs out! lol

This recipe was a disaster for me.  The recipe is at no fault.  I didn't have enough oil so I used some about 1/2, 1/2 vegetable oil and olive oil making up 3/4c.  I added 1 grated apple as a substitute as another reviewer suggested if there's no applesauce. I was short about 2-3T sugar so I added a little brown sugar instead.  Didn't have walnuts at all. Didn't have the right sized pan  And I had the oven on grill for the first 20min which burnt the top a little.  Ok, after all that I managed to save it some how.  It turned out super moist, but I am not that fond of the texture and found it quite oily even though I used only half of what the recipe called for.  It definitely is not a normal chocolate cake flavour. I can taste a hint of cocoa but it's not giving me  that sweet chocolately hit, although it is quite sugary sweet. Don't think I'll try again based of the flavours.

Like most other reviewers I cut down on the oil to 1 cup and added applesauce to compensate.  I skipped the cinnamon and nuts and subbed 1 tsp. vanilla and semi-sweet morsels.  I made it into two torte-like cakes by baking it in 2 round baking dishes.  I iced it with a hybrid of the satiny chocolate glaze and the sour cream ganache.  So moist and delicious with 25% less guilt because there is a bit of vegetable with the chocolaty decadence.

I make a couple substitutions: I substitute half of the oil with applesauce, and I put chocolate chips in place of walnuts.  I also omit the cinnamon.  I've made this several times now, and people just RAVE about it.  It's a definite favorite, and I can *almost* convince myself it's healthy.

This was my first attempt at zucchini cake and it rocked! I found it to be extremely moist and rivals any devil's food cake out there! And it was a little less of a guilty pleasure as there is so much zucchini in it! I would definitley reccomend this to anyone look to make a fantastic chocolate cake!!!

I was looking for a good recipe to use up a lot of the zucchini from the garden. I added about 1/4-1/3 cup of vinegar for a bit of zing. I also substituted some applesauce for the oil and about half of the sugar with splenda. It turned out to be a crowd pleaser. Very moist and plenty sweet.

Loved it.  I have a son who will not eat "green"  so I tried this to see if it would fool him.  Did it ever!  He at 3 pieces and was asking for more.  Chocolate Zucchini cake is now his favorite.  The only change I made was using 1 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce, and left out the nuts.  Other than that followed exactly.  Have made 3 time now and always turns out great.  It is fast and easy.  Thanks for he recipe.

The best chocolate cake I have baked.  Thank you for posting, Sandy.  I followed the advice of using apple sauce in place of half the oil.  I made a chocolate frosting with creamed butter, icing sugar, cocoa and milk and it was a perfect match.  The cake is so moist and I can convince myself that it is healthy!!

I made a double recipe one cake for my step-dad and a over 2 dozen cupcakes for home.  The cake turned out very moist, and my hubby and 3 year old loved the cupcakes.  I topped this recipe with Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site.  I followed the recipe exactly except putting in half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.

Delicious!  I can't imagine frosting this cake--for me it was perfect straight from the oven (or warmed in the microwave) and served with a dallop of whipped cream and a drizzle of raspberry sauce. I subbed semi-sweet chocolate chips for the nuts, which makes it even better when served warm.  The cinnamon adds a nice flavor, but it can tend to drown the chocolate.  Next time, I'll try skipping it.

I used dark chocolate powder and omitted the cinnamon. It was very dense and more of a brownie/bread consistency. I use Satiny Chocolate Glaze over it. My family and coworkers thought it was very good.

I try to hide veggies in many dishes, and this worked perfectly!  I couldn't resist telling my 9yo stepson as soon as he swallowed his first bite, and he still almost licked his bowl clean.  I did sub 1/2 the oil for applesauce, then cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups, still plenty sweet.  I have a wimpy grater so I gave up on it 5 min. in and added chunks of zucchini to the blender with the oil, applesauce and eggs.  This one is definitely a keeper!

Thank you for this excellent recipe.  I decreased the oil by 1/4 cup and increased the zucchini by 1/4 cup.  Also, I used whole wheat flour.  My friends and family all had second helpings!

Everybody loved this cake. They all asked me to make them another one! I made some changes by using half wheat flour and half white flour. I used half applesauce and half olive oil and I used half splenda and half sugar. I also used 3/4 cup chocolate chips and omitted the walnuts. When the cake came out of the oven I melted some leftover chocolate chips on the top and used that for the frosting. Yum! I ate one piece and had to give the rest away other wise I would not be able to control myself. He, He!

Did 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour, and 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce, added chocolate chips and sliced almonds, topped with cream cheese frosting.  A very easy cake, very moist.  Nice with the additions to add some interest.  I squeezed the water out of the zucchini and that probably helped keep it from being too soggy.  Nice!

I made this cake at high altitude (9000 feet) and it turned out perfectly in a 9x13 glass baking pan: moist, well-risen and very flavorful.  It has an absolutely amazing taste - full of chocolate and the cinnamon gives it a special kick.  The zucchini (if finely grated) can neither be seen nor tasted but keeps the cake moist for several days.  I followed suggestions of other readers and substituted 3/4 cup homemade applesauce (no sugar) for the oil.  I also used chocolate chunks instead of nuts.  It might turn out better in a non-stick pan rather than greasing/flouring a regular glass baking dish.  If you plan to serve it right away, cream cheese frosting is the perfect complement.

This is the best!! I used 3/4 c oil and 3/4 c applesauce instead of all the oil. Next time I will up the chocolate to 1 cup.  Really great recipe, super moist. I made it in a bundt pan for 50 mins, I'm at high altitude and didn't change anything else and it came out perfect. Brought it to work...it was gone super quick.

This came out great! Better than most "normal" chocolate cake... I can't imagine why some reviewers said it wasn't good. They must have done something wrong. The only changes I made were: replaced half of the oil with applesauce and used chocolate chips instead of walnuts. I will definately make this again.

Very good, moist cake.  I used chocolate chips instead of nuts, which made it really chocolate-y.  We didn't think it needed any frosting at all, it was quite good on its own.

My family really loved this one. My husband doesn't like nuts, so I left them out. I also used shredded zucchini instead of grated. It make no difference. It was excellent!

Great recipe! Very moist, lots of chocolatey flavor- yum!
Changes i made was to use 3/4 c oil and 3/4 c sour cream and to use choc chips instead of walnuts. 
I've made chocolate zucchini bread/cake for years and this recipe is tops!

This was a disaster.   Way too large an amount of batter for a 9x13 pan.  Mine rose and bubbled over into my oven and looked like a pile of coal (lumpy) when done.  I will NOT be making this again.

This cake is awesome!! Super moist and quick to make. I did follow some other reviews and used 3/4 sweetened applesauce and 3/4 vegetable oil. Turned out great.

I followed ALLIEA's suggestions from 8/24/05. Replacing the 1 1/2 cups oil with 3/4 cup applesauce,  3/4 cup oil, and added mini chocolate chips in place of the walnuts.  Finally I frosted it with the "Frosted Zucchini Brownies"  frosting recipe from this site.  This cake is by far my favorite zucchini recipe  to make.  My family can't stop talking about it!!

Please start rating the recipes as written before making changes so we can judge the true recipes and not all the changes people added or thought it needed. I made this cake without the suggestion / changes and glad I did the cake was great as written !

Delicious! This is the second year I have made this. First year...put in all the oil called for. It was super yummy, but a bit like eating a chocolate sponge soaked in oil. Made it using only 1 cup oil and it is just as good, with much less grease. There really is no need for  any more oil than 1 cup. Can't taste or even see the zucchini, which is nice! And by the way, I use high quality extra virgin olive oil and it tastes just fine!

I lost my favorite recipe for chocolate zucchini cake. This was pretty close to what I remembered. I finely shred the zucchinis and instead of walnuts, I added 2 cups of chocolate chips. My batter didn't look as thick as what the video shows, more consistent like boxed cake batter. I made it in a 9x13 glass dish and was ready in 50 minutes. My favorite recipe had it were you sprinkle at least 1 cup of chocolate chips on the top once you get it out of the oven. Then place it in back in the oven (turned off when you take the cake off but it's still hot) for about 2 minutes, till the chips are melted then spread it evenly.  I must admit, this recipe is pretty close to the one I lost. It is moist and you can't taste the zucchini at all. My son ate a nice big slice with milk. Thank you.

Excellent, moist cake. No one believes that there are 3 cups of zucchini in it. Made a few changes to make it healthier.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup, added 1 cup of white flour, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and cut the oil to 1/2 cup.  Added 1 full cup of cocoa.  I have made this cake 5 times and have added various glazes including chocolate, vanilla, and almond flavored.

Left everything thing as is and it was delicious the only thing I did was add berries so I poured half of batter added raspberries and blackberries. Then the rest of batter. No one even knew it had zucchini in the cake till after when I told them lol. My fiancé even admitted it was really good even though he hates vegitables. I also used a cream cheese frosting on this and made strawberry flowers

Very dense, moist cake! Easy to convert to gluten-free by substituting gluten-free flour mix! I also like to substitute mini-chocolate chips for the nuts to make the cake allergen-free. (I used Enjoy Life non-dairy chips)

This is the first time I've ever made a dessert with a vegetable. My neighbor brings us enormous zucchinis and I am always looking for ways to use them. I must say I was a little nervous about messing up a chocolate cake. 

Since this recipe has been reviewed by loads of people I decided to use some suggestions: I only used 1 cup oil, no cinnamon, a tsp of vanilla, and no nuts. It mixed up nice and was fun to make with my husband and daughter. We made it in a bundt pan and baked for 60 mins. 

We let it cool through the afternoon and tried it after dinner. This was THE BEST chocolate cake I've ever had. My family loved and we even sent half to our neighbors. Everyone loved it. It was the perfect sweetness so we didn't even put anything on top. Just perfect. Thank you!

Winner!  Even my 4 yr old grandson requested this for his birthday!  What did I change??? Not much.  I added a carrot just because I was shy a bit with the zucchini.  I did add my new favorite addition to cakes.... two or 3 tbls of instant vanilla pudding mix.  It makes every cake just a bit moist and even more delicious.  I finished the cake with a cream cheese frosting that I put 1 ounce of melted unsweetened chocolate in the mix.  I'm salivating about thinking of having it tonite for the birthday party!!!!

Excellent moist chocolatey zucchini cake.  I made it in a bundt pan and it came out perfect!  I love a fresh homemade cake that turns out well in high altitude and this one does.  Making it again with a yellow zucchini.  Yum!

Great way to get rid of a ton of zucchini! Super moist and just the right amount of chocolate. I used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup regular and then 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 3/4 cup vegetable oil! I also threw in a handful of dark chocolate chips which helped out! It still turned out great and my husband has no clue it is semi healthy ;)

This cake is absolutely fabulous. The zucchini adds just the right amount of moisture to the cake and no one would ever know that is has a vegetable in it. I topped my off with chocolate frosting, but it is good with or without frosting. I used half sunflower oil and half grape seed oil.  I will be taking this to my neighbors.  Perhaps, if you have a fussy eater, it is one way to get them to eat their vegetables! lol

I just finished making this cake and I followed the directions exactly (and yes, I used 11/2 cups of canola oil) My husband said this is how we'll use the grated zucchini from the garden. My youngest daughter makes a fantastic zucchini bread but my husband likes this better! Although I did spray the Bundt pan well, it still stuck some to the bottom but that is what hubby ate hot!! No icing or glaze needed either. I was quite worried about the batter when it went into the pan; however it did take close to 60 minutes to be done but well worth the wait.  will make this again for sure!!

I really loved this cake.  I used a Bundt pan and instead of walnuts I substituted semi sweet chocolate chips.  I frosted the cake with a drizzle of melted: 1 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 stick of butter and 2 TBSP of corn syrup (I melted in my microwave for about 2 minutes).  VERY chocolaty and moist!  By the way I also used 3 cups fresh PACKED shredded zucchini.

I used apple sauce instead of oil. It turned out good but different. It's a heavy cake so if that's not your style choose a different cake. I like my cake heavy so we loved it.

My family and I love this cake, very moist and delicious. I follow the direction for the first time but it was little bit bitter to my taste so the next time I used 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and It was perfect. I omit the walnuts because I don't really care for walnuts and to make it healthier I used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I also use 1 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup canola oil instead of 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil. Thanks for sharing the recipe Sandy.

I have baked other chocolate zucchini cakes before, and this recipe is not my favorite. There is, in my opinion, wayyyyy too much oil in this recipe. I first made it with the amount it calls for, and I was alarmed by how oily the batter was. So I then began to scoop out as much oil as I could. I probably managed to scoop out about 1/2 a cup. I baked it anyway, even though I thought it was still too oily of a batter. Once baked and cooled and dusted with powder, it was a very greasy cake. However, it was very chocoalty and delicious. (I did add chocolate chips). No one could call this cake dry, that's for sure. It was so moist, that it was almost like eating a pudding. I will use this recipe again, but I will use far less oil. Farrrr less. Next time I will probably stop at only one cup and see how that goes. But flavor-wise, it's a tasty recipe and it's easy to follow. I will try it again and tweak accordingly.

I made this cake entirely vegan with egg replacer instead of eggs and coconut and vegetable oil. It was fabulous and a huge pleaser. Very moist and incredible. Not too sweet either. Thank you!

This cake is amazingly moist and delicious!  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and it was just enough coconut flavor to make it even better - (if you like coconut).

I am only putting 4 stars because my husband and father thought it was not sweet or flavorful enough. They would put three stars and I would put five. I really liked this cake. I made it in a bundt and baked for 50 mins at 350. Then I glazed it with a simple powdered sugar glaze. I really enjoyed the walnuts in this and I think some chocolate chips would be good too. I also did some of the changes that others did with 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 all purpose white and 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil. Thank you very much!

This was excellent!  I did as others suggested and reduced the oil to 1 c. (didn't replace with applesauce or anything else), and the cake was still very moist.  I also subbed the nuts with chocolate chips.  This is a keeper.

This was a big hit with my family. They were hesitant because of the zucchini, but ended up loving it. I substituted half of the zucchini with yellow summer squash. The cake was moist and fudgy.

I love this recipe for Chocolate zucchini cake because it is dairy free My grandson cannot have dairy and it is always hard to find a recipe that doesn't have some amount of butter or sugar.  It was moist and rich.  We made it together and we will make it again!! Thanks!

This is one of the best chocolate cakes I’ve tried!  Perfect texture and flavor.  It’s very moist which is often hard to come by in a chocolate cake.  No one would ever suspect that it’s loaded with zucchini, but they would be asking how you got it to turn out so moist.

Yummy way to use up extra zucchini!  We used 2.5 c zucchini, only 1 c. of oil, 1/3c. of applesauce, and chocolate chips instead of nuts.  Dusted with powdered sugar--a big hit!

Someone made this for my dad's bday, and it was delicious! Vert moist and chocolate-y.  She made it as a bundt cake, and it didn't travel that well, but we put it back together and put strawberries over the cracks.  Everyone loved it.  You would never know there was zucchini in there unless you were told. :)

For a "healthy" cake, this is pretty good.  I ended up using Dutch process cocoa because that's what I had on hand.  And I tried to make it low-fat by substituting applesauce for some of the oil (I think I did 1 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup oil).  But the finished product came out dark, fudge-like, and delicious.

OMG, this cake is fantastic!  I used only one cup of canola oil & substituted 1 C. chocolate chips for the nuts.  I had zucchini in the freezer from last summer's garden.  I peeled it and pureed it in my food processor.  I baked in a 9x13 pan for 50 minutes  and it was perfect.  Everyone at work loved this cake & could not believe it when I later told them it was made with 3 cups of zucchini!

Another time I cut oil in half & used applesauce for the rest & it too came out well.  Thanks for the recipe

This cake is absolutely amazing- no taste of zucchini at all! I put in 4 cups of zucchini, blended with the eggs and oil, as another reviewer mentioned. Using the blender instead of grating the zucchini really saves on time. I also cut down the oil to 1/2 cup and sugar to 1 cup. I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 more cup cocoa. The cake came out very moist, rich, and delightfully dark chocolatey. It almost has a hint of bitterness to it, which I personally like.

I used whole wheat flour and it was great! I grind my own from hard, white, winter wheat, which is much lighter than most of the whole wheat flour you can buy, so I probably wouldn't use more than half whole wheat, if I had to use store-bought.  My daughter-in-law only likes real mild chocolate and I like real dark chocolate.  I put a rounded third cup of cocoa powder in and then filled one layer cake pan, then added another fourth of a cup of cocoa to the remaining batter for the other layer.  I also cut down the oil to one and a fourth cup.

The flavor turned out great but seemed a little under cooked in the middle even after adding about 10 mins to the cooking time.  It could be that I used about 3/4 c more zucinni than was called for though. I also used half oil and half applesauce to lower the calories.  I will definitly make again with a few little tweaks :)

This was an excellent cake. Wow. I had a go-to chocolate cake recipe for years but I think this will be the new one because it is made with zucchini and can be altered to be made healthier. I replaced whole wheat flour for the all purpose, cane sugar for the white sugar, 3 eggs instead of 4, 1 C of melted butter since I do not have vegetable oil and I grated an apple on the smaller grating hole to get the 1/2C apple sauce for the remaining cup of the oil. It was so good, I didn't even ice it and took slices on a hike and it was devoured and loved and friends were surprised it was "healthy". Next time I will replace more of the oil with grated apple and maybe put a few chocolate chips into the batter so I'll feel the melted chocolate in my mouth. This was an amazing recipe and so tasty. Thank you for sharing!

Very moist and delicious.  I've made this a couple of times.  This time, I had about 1/4 cup of butterscotch chips left that I added.  Also used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup AP flour.  Turned out well!

Nice recipe.   Here are the modifications made:  used 1 cup WW flour and 1 cup white.  Decreased oil to 1 cup, added some almond slivers and vanilla.   Rated only 4 stars as there are the recipe calls for 4 eggs and this seems like a lot.

This was the most chocolatey zucchini cake I've had--a lot are good, but taste more like a spice cake.  I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts--but they sank (which was still good, just not ideal).  Next time I'll try mini-chocolate chips and see if they're light enough to stay afloat.  I frosted with chocolate frosting.  If you peel the zucchini and remove the seeds before grating, and then especially if you grate small, kids won't have a clue that there's a veggie in there.  (Not that this is the most healthy way to feed them veggies...)

This cake wad Great. I did make one change - I added about a cup of chocolate chips to it. My daughter told me I make the best chocolate cake which is great since she doesn't like zucchini. I frosted mine with the hershey chocolate frosting recipe on the back of the hershey chocolate package.

So yummy. Very rich chocolate cake - I couldn't even tell there was zucchini in it. I used 4 oz of unsweetened chocolate instead of cocoa powder, as I was out. Reduced the oil to 1 cup. Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. And left out the cinnamon. I baked in 2 x 9" layer pans for about 55 minutes. Frosted with chocolate cream cheese frosting from this site.|Upping my rating to 5 stars. Again I left out the cinnamon, but everything else is as written in the recipe. Baked in muffin tins - be sure to use papers, they were sticky little buggers - could be because of my smaller helper who greased the pans. Again the zucchini was not detectable - I'm convinced it just magically evaporates. This should be your go-to chocolate cake recipe. Freeze shredded zucchini so you can make it year round!

I honestly have to say I was VERY skeptical about this cake...veggies in chocolate cake?  The cake was a big hit!  I made all the taste testers guess the "secret ingredient" and no one knew!  I made homemade cream cheese frosting to top it off.  Very tasty.  Not too rich.  Very moist!  Excellent choice.   I made the cake in a bundt pan instead and it came out great.

This is a great recipe.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used half applesauce.  Otherwise used the recipe as is.  Very moist, choco, and a hint of spice.

Like others, I reduced sugar and oil, replacing some oil with applesauce, subst'd choc chips for walnuts. Prior to folding in the zucchini and chips, I beat the batter on high speed for 3 minutes (box mixes usually say to do that). I don't make many scratch cakes, but I needed to get rid of zucchini!  This recipe is very good!  My husband thought it was one of the better scratch cakes he'd ever had as far as texture.  My kids think I'm lying about there being zucchini in there.

I had a bunch of zucchini and found this cake a great place to use it.  It is very easy to make and I agree, it is not too sweet.  I used the dark chocolate cocoa and it made it very dark and very chocolately. The zucchini makes it moist but yet can not be tasted.   I made a basic icing of pwd sugar, cocoa, stick of butter, vanilla, milk and tad of lemon.  This was a very hit!  Will make it again.

This was outstanding, I used orange extract instead of vanilla.  Everyone raved about this one.  The glaze was a bit of a mess, not sure if I did it correctly because it was super runny. After some time in the fridge, it hardeded up and still tasted awesome.

Great cake! I did as other reviewers suggested and only put 1 cup of oil, but other than that stayed right to the recipe. I agree with the reviews that said this cake is best the next day...liked it the first night, but LOVED it the next nights we ate it!!!

Super good, super quick and easy. A great way to use up some of that zucchini. I cut down on the oil from 1 1/2 cup to 1 short cup and also cut back on cocoa to a short 1/2 cup.  Not as greasy and bitter.

Excellent cake. I cut out most of the oil by substituting 1 cup of applesauce, 1/2 cup of yogurt and 1/4 cup of oil. I also substituted 1 cup of Splenda for one of the cups of sugar. Turned out great. Thank you for an excellent recipe.

A good way to satisfy my chocolate craving and use up zucchini from our garden at the same time! I made a cream cheese frosting to go on top, and the combo was quite good. A very yummy cake that I will probably make again.

I made this cake exactly as the recipe called, except for nuts (because my kids don't like 'em).  Will absolutely make again.  Definitely recommend.

This recipe never fails.  I use pecans instead of walnuts, and always go half/half with oil and applesauce.  If I want it to be sweeter I throw in half a cup of chocolate chips.  Delicious with a cream cheese icing for desert, and a pretty good breakfast too!

I added 1 cup chocolate chips.  I used 3 small/med sized zucchini.  I baked it for 35 min in a 9X13.  Tastes much better after setteling a day so bake the evening before.  Very moist! Frosting is not neccesary especially with the addition of chocolate chips.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla.

Incredibly moist.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and whole wheat flour for the all-purpose to make it a bit healthier (still a pile of sugar though, would have liked to substitute for this too).  Added "Texas Chocolate Frosting" (more sugar, but soooo yummy!).

This is a terrific recipe. I am gluten intolerant so I had to do some revisions with special flours, but it came out great! Very moist and chocolaty. I omitted the nuts in the cake and instead mixed them with a cup of chocolate chips and sprinkled them on top before baking. This is definitely a cake I will make again. Thanks, Vicki

This really is moist and fudgy and DH loved it..however, we couldn't tell it was zucchini in it.  I used a cup of toasted pecans and a cup of chocolate chips.  Also did as others suggested and used half oil and half applesauce.  I made it in 2 loaf pans with cream cheese frosting.  Will definitely make again.......

This is the best cake I've ever made from scratch. It is so moist. The first time I made it I was short one egg, and it turned out fine, so I've made it that way every time. I froze shredded zucchini so I can bake this cake in the winter!

Add 5 more stars to this rich chocolaty cake! My DDIL has kept our home filled with summer vegetables from her garden but I could not use all of the zucchini. I misplaced my favorite chocolate zucchini cake recipe and have never found one that my family enjoys until yesterday. I followed the recipe except to follow advice to cut the oil by half and supplement with applesauce. I used smooth applesauce with cinnamon. I did not add nuts but topped with a generous helping of chocolate chips. We had the cake for dessert and I can see that it is not going to last more than 24 hours in this house. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Very yum.  I also substituted half the oil for applesauce.  Very moist.  I made cupcakes and frosted half and just put powdered sugar on the other half.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, what a cake! My family said it may be the best chocolate cake they have ever tasted. To up the nutritional value I used Olive Oil and I substituted powdered Carob for Cocoa to give it lots of fibre!

This cake is so moist to the point of tasting soggy.The cinnamon spice also stands out too much.My children did not like it at all.My husband only ate 1 piece. Since my family has quite a few 'chocoholics',that has never happened before.

I tried this recipe last summer and really liked it. As a matter of fact, I spent considerable time trying to find it again this summer after I lost the recipe. Last year I used mini chocolate chips in place of the walnuts, baked it in a bundt pan, and did not frost it at all. I adjusted the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon, and substituted 1/2 cup of the oil with unsweetened applesauce. This year, my husband AND son loved the cake when I frosted it with vanilla buttercream frosting, although it was too sweet for my taste. The next time I make it with a frosting I will decrease the sugar to 1-1/2 cups. One of these times I'd like to try it with the walnuts, but my family prefers it without.

Good cake but compared to my mom's recipe for chocolate zucchini cake (which is the best) this was tooo moist and chocolaty! My mom's doesn't call for nearly as much cocoa and you can taste the flavor from the zucchini whereas in this recipe it is masked. The family still ate it but just not our favorite...

Very delicious.  Very rich and moist.  I made it in a bundt pan like others suggested and drizzled chocolate icing on top.  It looked very pretty too.  I didn't tell anyone there was zucchini in it until afterwards and no one could guess what the "secret" ingredient was.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Yummy. I would double the nuts for next time. Also, about 1/2 way thru the cake baking I would sprinkle 1 cup of chocolate chips over it. Good for taking to a BBQ where your worried about it drying out--Very MOIST. Thanks for such a good recipe.

Put real whipped icing on it and found it too sweet.  I think next time I will use whip cream.

I was skeptical about 1 and half oil, it seemed too much, until I was done. This is the Absolute BEST cake I have ever made. I  bake all the time and know a good recipe. This is it, the moistest, most flavourable. I added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips which makes it even better.  I made a cream cheese frosting with almond flavoring and it made a masterpiece. Don't pass this one up. Try it, you will thank me... Happy Baked New Year....Peace and be kind to one another

My cake turned out good. I only used ¾ cup of oil.   I agree with other reviews where it was mentioned the original recipe called for too much oil.  
I had self-rising flour so I use that. 
I omitted the walnuts and cinnamon. 
I used chocolate chips instead of coco powder because of what I had.  

Btw- I noticed some reviews mentioned the cake coming out bitter. The reason is because some zucchinis can be bitter.  Taste the zucchini before you put it in the mix. 

The cake came out moist and good.
I like it more the next day when I took it out of the fridge. Tasted better slightly cold than hot.  I ate 2 slices for breakfast because I couldn’t wait to eat it as a dessert.  I’ll definitely make this again soon.  

Here is how I adjusted it.  

2 cups self-rising all purpose flour
1 ½ cups white sugar
¾  cup chocolate chips
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon sea salt
4 eggs
¾ cups of vegetable oil
3 cups grated zucchini

I'm sure this cake is great, it's just not for us. I made this cake and it did not go well for us.....it sunk in the middle, very bland and just not our level of rich chocolate that we like.

First time I made this cake I just loved it.....but I felt that I could jazz it up by putting zucchini, 2 apples and 1 carrot in the food processor to grate equally making a 2 cup concoction of my favorite things ….. oh and added I cup chopped pecans.

 I  make this cake every three weeks!!!!

I followed the remaining ingredients as directed ….. this cake, Carrot cake, Tres Leche and 7 Up Pound Cake are my favorites. My husband loves the Carrot Cake the best, but this one comes in a close second. This one is my favorite as I love Chocolate.

I have made this several times since my zucchini started coming on; my family loves it! I leave out the walnuts and throw in a handful of chocolate chips. I have also been subbing unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil. Most recently I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and I think it handled the switch just fine. I have yet to add frosting; it is moist and sweet enough without it.

This cake has a lovely, moist texture and is quite good.  When I bake I almost I always substitute  white-whole- wheat flour for 1/3 of the all-purpose flour, which never affects flavor.  I used Hersheys Dark Cocoa Powder.  As advised by others, I was planning to use applesauce for half the oil, but my applesauce was out of date.  So I used 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup homemade yogurt.  Next time I'll use 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup yogurt instead.  Husband I and would have liked it a bit sweeter and with more chocolate (our personal preference) so next time I'll add dark chocolate chips.   There definitely will be a next time!  One warning:  If your zucchini has seeds, scrape them out before grating.  I didn't and the seeds are rubbery in my cake.

5 stars for sure. I did leave out 1/2 cup of oil, and salt. I will make this one again. I used loaf pans makes 2, and baked for the time given. I will say that I think it also depends on the cocoa power for how deep of a chocolate taste it comes out. The darker the powder the more chocolate taste you will get.

I made this when the weather FINALLY cooled off a little, and I had a baseball bat (giant zucchini). Fooled my husband who refuses to eat zucchini ( he like it).  My mom, who is a great cook, said it was the best chocolate cake she ever ate! (I also subbed 1/2 the oil with applesauce)

Very moist and has rich chocolate flavor. Not having cocoa powder available I substituted with a dark chocolate hot chocolate mix. Also substituted 1/2 cup of the oil with apple sauce.  Husband and adult kids wondered how soon I’d be making the next one when there was still a little bit left of the first one.

Best chocolate cake recipe I ever tasted.  Rich, moist, and truly decadent.  So rich that instead of frosting, I paired it with homemade whipped cream.  Everyone that has tasted it absolutely raves about how delicious it is.  Nobody believes that it has three cups of zucchini!  This is a keeper!

Loved it! I did cut the oil to 1 cup and it was still very moist. I will make again and next time I will try coconut instead of walnuts. For us walnuts are for brownies and breads.

This is my go to recipe in the summer when I suddenly have a lot of zucchini growing in the yard. Instead of frosting it, I dust with powdered sugar for sweetness perfection. Moist, choclately, and delicious. This cake is always a hit wherever I bring one.

Served without frosting like a snack cake. Delicious, moist. Big hit at work.  If serving without frosting you could dust it with some powdered sugar before serving to make ti a bit fancier.

So yummy! I didn’t really know what to expect with this recipe, so I was pleasantly surprised! I did cut the sugar about a third cup because I don’t like really sweet. As another reviewer suggested, I subbed applesauce for half the oil (and margarine for the other half because I was out of oil ). I baked in two loaf pans for probably 40+ minutes. The cake came out moist and yummy! It tasted good with and without cream cheese frosting, and definitely not too sweet! I’m in love!

If you like dark chocolate this would likely be a lovely cake. its very rich, especially if you use the half oil half applesauce trick the rest of the comments suggested. However, if you're sensitive to bitterness like I am, you should probably steer clear. That unsweetened cocoa with the zucchini is not for the faint of palate.

Very delicious, moist cake. Very rich chocolate. I did not put in the walnuts, I added a bag of chocolate chips. Half a bag of chocolate chips in the batter and sprinkled the other half on top before baking. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla with the oil and eggs, an extra half teaspoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of cloves, and half a teaspoon of nutmeg to make the chocolate richer. Delicious!

I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts and about 3/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of butter. Served it with no frosting at a picnic and got raves. Delicious. Will make again soon.

This cake was amazing! Very moist and not overly sweet. I bought powdered sugar to sprinkle on top, but it didn’t even need it. The cake is perfect without any frosting or anything extra on top. Will absolutely make again.

LOVE THIS CAKE.  I followed advice from previous reviews and used 1 cup of vegetable oil.  The cake is excellent, but it did stick to the sides of my bundt pan even though I generously sprayed it with oil.  Next time I will either use a pan I can line with parchment paper, or I will use the full 1 1/2 cups of oil.  I also added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Yum.

This is always a favorite!

I have made this many times from an older version print out I had and it always turned out perfectly. HOWEVER, the last time I made it using the website recipe (version III), it was very greasy - so cut the oil down from the 1 1/2 cup it is asking for.. 

Taking a look at the other two versions, they ask for 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup oil. So definitely use less oil.

I loved this cake! If it wasn’t for the fact that my husband and I ate the entire thing in an embarrassingly short period of time, I would make it more often. I’m considering making 1/2 the amount in a 9x9 pan. Has anyone else succeeded with that?

Very easy to make and delicious. I did make substitutions. I did half brown sugar,  half white sugar, and I also did 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and 1 cup of baby food my baby doesn't want anymore (apple&blueberry, and beet/pear/ pomegranate). I used a borderline large zucchini that I grated with a fine sized grater, the pieces are not noticeable at all in the cake. You can't even tell. I also added a splash of vanilla, about a tablespoon, to counter any bitter taste people were mentioning in reviews. I kept the cinnamon and cocoa measurements as listed.  Taste like a yummy chocolate cake. 
I made sure to let it sit a bit while I buttered and floured my baking dishes and pan. I used 2 pie dishes and a small loaf pan. It took about 30 minutes. I knew they were done based on the smell. I smelled strongly of chocolate  about 5 minutes before it was done. When the cake was done the chocolate smell subsided a bit and it smelled more like cake. I did not open the oven door until it smelled done to me.

One of the moistest cakes I have ever made. Have 20# of frozen zucchini from the garden I am trying to use up. Thawed the zucchini then drained all the juice out by wrapping then squeezing the zucchini multiple times in dish towels. I used my immersion blended to finely chop the zucchini ( knew if my family saw or felt any texture from the  zucchini it would be all over!) For a little deliciousness, topped the cake with cream cheese icing. Keeper recipe!

So I made a healthy version of this for my kids substituting the sugar with coconut sugar (same amount) and the flour with coconut flour (same amount) and the oil substituted with half amount in unsweetened applesauce so 3/4cup used. I didn’t opt to put in the nuts either. It turned out unreal good!!!! The kids beg me to make it again and again! Highly recommend these modifications if you are looking to avoid flour and sugar =)

I made it as per the recipe except for the nuts, so that it can go to school with lunch. It’s moist and delicious and goes in my book of favourites.

It’s that time of year when there are too many zucchini. I made this chocolate cake one weekend, and it was so delicious I made cupcakes with the same recipe the next weekend, with adding a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter. I left out walnuts both times. Wow, so moist and delicious! I just read some of the reviews about how to make with less oil and would like to try that. They don’t seem too oily to me, but it does seem like a crazy amount of oil when I put it in!

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I did one part sliced almonds and two parts chocolate chips instead of walnuts because that's what I had. Fudgy and tasty.

Dense, heavy and oh, so wonderful!  Just like Mama used to make.  I've made three of them so far.  The first two I used a standard cream cheese with chocolate icing.  The last one I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe on this site.  It was very good, but could be a bit sweeter in my opinion!  With the cake, I did not add cinnamon or chopped walnuts.  I used chocolate chips in stead.  I also used a bundt pan for two of them rather than the 9 x 13" pan recommended in the recipe.  The bundt pan required 60 - 65 minutes to bake.

I substituted 1 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1 cup of the oil, omitted the nuts and used 1/2 c Splenda for 1/2 cup of the sugar.  Baked it in a bundt pan for ~50-55 minutes.

I served it once with buttercream frosting and ince plain.  My grandkids loved it!!!

Tastes great.  I baked it in loaf pans instead of 9×13, bread turned out to be slightly crumbly. I will have to twik this a bit. Aside from crumbles, this is an excellent addition to my zucchini bake collection.

This cake was awesome!  Per other review recommendations, I reduced the oil amount to 1 cup.  I used coconut oil.  I was a little concerned about the remaining 1/2 cup fluid I wasn't putting in, so I threw in a  1/4 cup coffee. I used chocolate chips instead of nuts, also.  This will be on my seasonal zucchini  must have recipe collection.  It's that good!

Delish!! Followed the recipe, a little shy on the sugar, but otherwise didn't stray.  Came out light and fluffy. Not too sweet, and uses a good amount of the prolific squash!  Didn't frost it as we are not super into sweets. Doesn't need it. IF I were to take it to work or serve guests, I would probably just sprinkle with powdered sugar for looks.

This is a super moist chocolate cake! All 3 of my kids gobbled it up and not until it was gone did I tell them it had 3 cups of their least favorite veggie in it! They actually said they couldn't taste it or see it, so they didn't mind! My 7 year-old even asked if I would make another one the next time we get a zucchini! This one is a keeper!

The cake is very moist and yummy! My kids won’t eat walnuts so I substituted mini chocolate chips but otherwise made it to the recipe. We frosted it with cream cheese frosting and it’s a new favorite with the kids. It would be great with chocolate ganache if you want more chocolate.

I also replaced half the oil with applesauce, used 1 1/2 c. Sugar and made them as cupcakes. Substituted mini chocolate chips for walnuts  and dusted with confectioners sugar.  Moist and incredibly delicious! Froze them in two packs for portion control for us as long as we only eat one pack per day haha!

Hard to rate when I tweaked but these are very good. Moist, nice texture, a nice sweetness and perfect chocolatiness
*I used 3/4 c. Coconut oil and 3/4 c. Applesauce
*i used raw turbinado sugar
*did not have a grater, i shredded then blended the zucchini with the liquids then combined with dry ingredients

Baked for about 25 minutes

Very good cake, moist, but not really "fudgy"  Used everything as stated, with the exception of the cinnamon and walnuts. Overall simple, can hardly tell there's any zucchini in it, and pretty tasty. Greatly benefited from some cream cheese frosting, too.

I used 1/2 wheat flour & 1/2 white, sub'd 1/2 applesauce for the oil and sprinkled in some chai seeds. It only took about 45 minutes to bake. So moist. Looks great. Not overly sweet. Will make it again!

I modified this recipe using gf flour and a sugar substitute.   It made a great brownie style sheet cake for a bbq.  I would have liked it better with real sugar but the cake was very moist and no one would have known it was zuchinni if I hadn't told them.

This was a very moist & chocolatey cake. I love that there are 3 full cups of zucchini in it. It's a great way to use up all of that zucchini from the garden.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups of oil I used a 1/2 cup of oil, 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, & 1/2 a cup of applesauce. I baked it in a bundt pan & topped with some ganache  & have also baked this cake in 2 loaf pans.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour & 1/2 regular once too & it was still delicious.

I omit the cinnamon and walnuts and make a ganache frosting. This is a delicious cake and if you peel the zucchini no one can tell that it has it in there.

I made it GLUTEN FREE! I made it exactly how it is written, but substituted Gluten Free flour instead of regular flour. It was amazing, moist and set up nicely. I did add some frosting...just made it even yummier!

This cake was excellent!  Very moist and chocolatey.  I made it for 4th of July. Added chocolate chips in place of nuts because of nut allergies. I used the icing recipe on the Hershey’s cocoa can. The whole cake was eaten.

Delicious and moist. I’ve made this twice this week because it keeps getting eaten up by all my daughter’s friends and I have a lot of zucchini to use up.  I replaced walnuts with chocolate chips and topped with a simple cream cheese frosting.

I tend to do major changes to all my recipes and they generally work:
Replace Veg oil with: 3/4c melted coconut and 3/4c grape seed
Replace 4 eggs with 4 “flax eggs”
Replace 2c sugar with 1 1/2c honey
Replace flour with  1 1/2c all purpose gluten free flour and 1/2c coconut flour.

It’s so good.  Not as sweet as most cakes (which we like, and we actually decrease the sugar a little anyway) with a delicious depth of flavor from the cinnamon etc. We have also successfully served it to many kids who loved it.

We love this recipe.  I use Bob’s Redmill 1 to 1 baking flour substitute to make this cake gluten free. It works well!  Following others ideas, we also substitute half the oil for applesauce. Lowering the cinnamon is also a good idea unless you’re big on cinnamon flavor. The recipe also works well for cupcakes (withbor wothout papers, just grease first). Moist, chocolaty, and the leftovers keep well. Delicious!

I made the recipe EXACTLY as written. I don't say this lightly, this is the PERFECT cake. Moist, rich, fluffy, with a perfect amount of sweetness.  I was tempted to reduce the sugar, but I'm very glad I didn't. It only took 40mims

Amazing! I added mini chocolate chips (made it oddly crunchy) and frosting and it did not need any. Couldn't tell it had zucchini. Will definitely make again.

My family loves these! This is the second time I’ve made them. First time I followed directions exactly (except omitted the nuts due to allergies) and they were awesome. 2nd time tweaked it a little. First
I only used 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 2nd I puréed my summer squash( it was in my freezer, I thawed but didn’t drain, so I puréed all the liquid with it), 3rd because I was out of vegetable oil I subbed 3/4 cup applesauce.
With the puréed squash the batter was wet enough that I didn’t add the additional 3/4 cup of missing oil/applesauce, and made them into cupcakes. I did add about 3/4 cups dark chocolate chips. These turned out awesome!! My kids raved about them. It made 2 doz cupcakes and I put the rest in a bread pan, it was a smaller loaf, but still decent size and I took it to a social function and got rave reviews! I’ll definitely be making it again and actually keeping the substitutions I made this time because I think they made it even tastier!

I have made this delicious cake twice in one week, per requests from my neighbors!  I modified it slightly as one comment suggested:  reduce oil to 1/2 cup and add 1 cup unsweetened applesauce. Reduce sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  BAKING TIME was much less than recipe states. I baked @ 350 for 32 minutes. Done perfectly!    Also I greased the pan and sprinkled it with sifted cocoa.   No icing,  just sprinkled confectioner's sugar before serving. Pretty and conserves even more calories!

I need some help here, peeps.  

I tried making this multiple times yet the ingredients do not want to incorporate.  I never even got to the point where I could add the zucchini  Every time I tried, all I got was a coarse paste-like substance.  The oil never was absorbed and would pool at the top of the "mixture".  I can't call it batter because what I got is NOT batter.
Does anyone have any idea what happened??  I have baked MANY cakes and have never had a total failure like this.  I know I am measuring properly and following along just as in the video.  However, they get cake batter, and I get a total mess.

Moist and delicious, with just a touch of cinnamon. I make it as is and it is perfect. It’s now my go-to chocolate cake recipe - have have to freeze grated zucchini in the summer to make sure I have some to make it in the winter!

I made this recipe with 2 cups of zucchini, 1 cup of canned pumpkin, and I put in a total of 1 cup cocoa powder to help mask the taste of the pumpkin. I also used a food processor to pulverize the zucchini, and my two best friends (both of whom swore they’d never eat zucchini or pumpkin because they hate those foods so much) ate this recipe and had no clue there was zucchini or pumpkin in it. It would be a good way to sneak more veggies in to kids, too.

DELICIOUS!  I've made chocolate zucchini bread but this is definitely cake.  I wanted to reduce the amount of oil so I used  3/4 C of a mixture of olive and Canola oils  plus smashed ripe pear.  Also added 3/4 C of chocolate chips.  I didn't have apple sauce or walnuts The results, well there were only crumbs left when I served it.  It was light, moist and needs no frosting.  This is one of the 10 ways I used the overgrown zucchini this summer.

Very Good!!! 
I made it with a couple of the suggestions in the reviews. I replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce and I did add 1/4 cup of extra sugar. My family loved it! Note to those saying it was bitter - I think if you use dutch processed cocoa it might not be bitter. That's what I used & there was no bitterness at all.

Moist, delicious, and a huge hit with everyone I've served it to. I substitute chocolate chips for walnuts for extra decadence. I mixed in half during the mixing process and then the rest after partially cooking it so they don't sink. I've also made it as a bread for easy transport. You have to make sure to oil and flour the pan, but it works well.

Would have been a 5 star except for the amount of oil the recipe calls for.  I advise reducing the oil to 1 cup as others have stated.  I made it once in a bundt pan and once in 2 loaf pans.  Works great both ways.

It wasn't dense at all, and certainly not fudgy.  I was expecting more moist, but this baked up like a cake.  Not sure where I went wrong.......

So moist and flavourful. Added chocolate chips instead of nuts. Don't love all the processed oil though. Would love see an alternative ingredient to this one. Made muffins too. Great for lunches and snacks.  Making it again tonight because first batch is gone!

I followed the  recipe except put nuts on top of frosting. Seemed a little dry, but had shredded zucchini an hour early and drained off part of the liquid. Also added chocolate chips to batter. Will make again and maybe add extra cup of zucchini and substitute applesauce for part of oil. Makes a big cake.

LOVE this cake...BUT less oil!!  I could not taste the zucchini at all (peeled of course), and it's not overly sweet, and super moist, which is awesome.  However, as I was putting the oil in it seemed like it was just overkill, and wish I had stopped myself.  Next time I make it I will certainly cut the oil back like many mentioned on here (to 1cup instead, or 1/2 unsweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil, prob will try olive next time).  I feel the excess oil made it too spongy and not cake-y enough.
I omitted the walnuts and added a homemade cream cheese frosting with much less confectioner's sugar than the recipe called for).

OMG!!  Can anyone tell me what I did wrong?  I followed the recipe exactly.  The recipe called for only one loaf pan yet there was enough batter to fill two pans.  I put almost all of it into one pan and within ten minutes it was overflowing all onto the oven floor.  Maybe it was my zucchini measurements?  How does one measure zucchini?  Also, this recipe does not call for squeezing the liquid from the zucchini but it was so sloppy/soupy with liquid seeping up the sides of the pan.  All around nasty mess!  Regardless, it was a complete flop!

The kids liked it a lot, and I'm happy they're getting a hidden vegetable. My husband and I liked it as well, but we thought it had a strong flavor. I just can't place the flavor. I just sprinkled it with powdered sugar to cut back on calories.

Holy crow is this GOOD!  So, so, so moist!  Made similar changes as others did:  only 1 cup oil, a smidge less sugar, subbed the nuts for choc chips, baked in bundt for 50 mins.  Doesn't need frosting - serve with vanilla ice cream, or melt chips in coconut oil for a quick & simple glaze.  I've made this 3X in past month...just sayin...

I made this with my kids today and it turned out great.  I'm at 5,000 feet so I worry about how things will rise, but this worked just fine.  I didn't have enough oil on hand so I substituted in some applesauce for part of the oil.  Very moist and not too sweet.

Now this is my kind of cake - no need to sift ingredients or get out the mixer, just combine ingredients and bake!  Changes that  I made were - I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour as another reviewer suggested, and halved the oil and used unsweetened applesauce for the other half.  The cake turned out so moist!

This is a great cake recipe! Simple moist. 

Since I planned on frosting it, I cut the sugar in half, and used only 1 cup of oil (I only had 1 cup of olive oil on-hand).  Honestly, even without the frosting, it's totally sweet enough with just 1 cup of sugar. I used the chocolate cookie buttercream frosting recipe to frost.

Ugh, SO GOOD.

1 1/2 cups of oil is TOO MUCH! Just about every recipe on the web for Chocolate Zucchini cake is like this one with 3 exceptions. 
1) They all call for 1 cup of oil. 
2) Some call for the addition of chocolate chips. 
3) Some call for the addition of espresso powder (which enhances the flavor profile of the chocolate).  

That extra half cup of oil makes the cake heavy. That's why people say they can swap out half cup of the oil for applesauce- b/c it is unnecessary!

 Also, oil is like butter in that it should be mixed with the sugar, and then egg before adding to the dry ingredients. Otherwise, it stays on the outside of the batter and never incorporates well.

I'm going to stick with the recipe from Sally's baking addiction, or King Arthur flour, as they both turned out much better than this one.

This was a delicious way to use a huge zucchini from a co-worker's garden!  I used one large zucchini grated down in to just slightly over 3 cups.  I used 1 C white sugar and roughly 3/4 C brown sugar.  I sifted the flour, leavening agents, salt and white sugar together in to the stand mixer bowl, then on lowest setting paddle mixed in brown sugar, closer to a 1 C of cocoa powder, 1/8-1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4(ish) tsp of cinnamon.  I then added the eggs and closer to 1 1/4 C of canola oil. Slowly mixed in the zucchini and then baked in a greased and floured tube pan at 350 for 1 hour 5 mins, started checking at 50 minutes.  Then dusted with powdered sugar... so freaking good!! Three co-workers asked for the recipe today!  I just wish I had added chocolate chips, I didn't add walnuts, chocolate chips would have been awesome!  Will totally make again!

Took the advice of other reviewers and went half and half on the oil and unsweetened applesauce. I actually was short on the cocoa (this was a "spur-of-the-moment" dessert) by almost half, but still came out chocolatey (with the help of a tablespoon of nesquick syrup lol). Dusted with powdered sugar and voila'! Wonderful texture and flavor. Kids loved it, husband loved it, and no one the wiser about the zucchini!!!! I'll be sure to plan the next time I make it as to have all the cocoa.

Wow!!! I usually HATE homemade cake, they aren't as rich as the box-made kind, but THIS CAKE, WOW!!! I will be making this on a regular basis. Moist, fudgey, great depth of flavor, just plain amazing. 
Based on comments made by others, I left out the cinnamon, only used one cup of oil, squeezed all of the liquid out of the zucchini that I could, and used 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of nuts. This does not need icing (would be an awesome chocolate muffin), but it did pair nicely with the chocolate icing recipe given on this site that is made using chocolate chips, condensed milk, and vanilla (drizzled on the icing). Next time I think I will only use 3/4 cup chocolate chips and try a vanilla glaze, this cake is chocolaty enough without adding chocolate icing.

Whole family loved it! A few changes: diced instead of shredded for ease and convenience, added 1/4 chia seeds (couldn't tell), used 1 cup of coconut flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, added some shredded coconut on top which toasted perfectly. Added some homemade vanilla  frosting (3 C powdered sugar, 1/3 cup softened butter, 2 tablespoons  milk and 1.5 tablespoons vanilla, beat until smooth). So good!!

Yum! I used 4 cups of zucchini only because I have so much zucchini and needed to use it up. I also swapped the oil for the half applesauce/half safflower oil mix because I'm used to baking with applesauce. I made mine into cupcakes for convenience. Took about half an hour to be ready. (Picky kid standing over my shoulder while writing this review said "THOSE WERE SO GOOD". Clearly we will make this again. :)

Super moist and light cake. Since there are only two of us, I cut this recipe in half and baked in a 9x9 pan. I did cut the cocoa down to 1/4 cup for half the recipe and it still had a good chocolate taste. I did mess up and added 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/2 tsp for the half recipe.  I actually liked the flavor. It didn't scream "cinnamon". My husband loved the cake. I would make this again and still use the extra cinnamon. I left the nuts out because I don't like nuts in my cakes.

So moist and delicious, not sure what the zucchini adds to the chocolate cake but I'm not sure I'll make another chocolate cake without zucchini in it! Definitely cut back on the oil - maybe 3/4 c.  Made mine without the nuts or any chips - just chocolate and zucchini.  Great recipe!

First time, I followed the recipe; noticed that there was a lot of oil in the pan after unmolding (used a bundt pan). So this time, I decreased the oil by 1/4 cup, and it came out perfectly and still super moist. Much better tasting the next day, so if you can wait a day to eat it, I would!!

Delicious and moist. A hit with my co-workers. I did make a few changes. Substituted one cup whole wheat flour for a cup of all purpose flour, Used half cup special dark unsweetened cocoa powder and quarter cup normal. I only used one cup of vegetable oil and one cup of brown sugar. Everything else remained the same. No one missed the extra sugar or oil. Cake looked and tasted great and had a nice texture. Will be making often.

This recipe reminded me of what my aunt use to make all the time. It was delicious, very moist and just sweet enough. The only alterations I made was cut a bit of the sugar and added a dash of nutmeg, other than that, superb!

The cake was very moist. I decreased the sugar which gave it a slight bitter taste. I was trying to make it healthier but next time I will put full sugar as it definitely needed it for taste.

I made it because I have a 6 yr old who has Selective Eating Disorder (SED) and has an extremely limited diet. She'd NEVER try zucchini but ate it up with no problem when hidden in the cake. Great recipe and plan to make it again. 

I did make some minor adjustments: I added some chocolate chips and I swapped out pecans for walnuts. Next time though, I will not add nuts; it added an unexpected texture.

I made this cake with very little changes. I used melted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, omitted the cinnamon (personal taste), and substituted walnuts with coconut. I baked this in a bundt pan, made a ganache with canned coconut milk and chocolate chips, and topped it with toasted coconut. This cake is delicious, and I wouldn't change a thing.

I love the way this turned out!  I added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  I also made cupcake size cakes.  No frosting needed!  I ended with 36 total.  It's saved an I'll do it again.

I will definitely be making this again. I did 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup cinnamon apple sauce left out the cinnamon, and subbed chocolate chips for the nuts. I also used half Splenda, half sugar. I made them as muffins and baked about 22 minutes. Delicious!

Best chocolate zucchini cake ever.  For frosting I used cream cheese, coffee, vanilla and confectioners sugar. It doesn't get better than that.

I made a couple changes just to try to make it a little healthier. I added one cup of sugar and one cup of Splenda. I used unsweetened applesauce for the oil. The cake turned out great and moist. I also made it in a bundt pan to make it pretty. The recipe says that this cake isn't too sweet and it isn't. I needed a little more sweetness so I sprinkled a light layering of powdered sugar on the top. The powdered sugar dissolved into the cake. This recipe would be outstanding without any changes. I was pleasantly surprised that with the changes I made,  it was great!!

This is my go-to chocolate cake nowadays.  I often have to cook low-fat recipes for a family member with a restrictive diet and I've found it possible to substitute out a good bit of the oil for applesauce with very little change in taste or texture.  It is a very good, moist, chocolatey cake!

I definitely recommend grating the zucchini somewhat large (just not on the finest side of the grater) as otherwise the batter becomes very liquid.

WOW, for a keeper of a recipe! Of course changed some stuff like everyone does. Used GF flour mix, more zucchini than it called for, coconut oil instead of veggie oil, half the oil and half apple sauce, 1 cup beet sugar and 1/4 cup honey, and added chia seeds. 
Divine flavour; not over-the-top in sweetness but wonderful, flavorful, moist cake.

This cake passed the supreme test...our grandchildren ate it up!  Although the 8-year-old asked why I had put nuts in it?  It was because I like nuts.  Hubby wonders if we could reduce the oil?  The cake leaves a residue om fingers.  Anyone try less oil?

Too bad I discovered this at the end of zucchini season. Love the dark chocolate and the light, slightly moist texture.  The hint of cinnamon sets off the chocolate beautifully.  This was a huge hit at work. I used just a half recipe of cream cheese icing.

Definitely a GO-TO dessert to impress! I made it with 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 the oil and added 1/2 c. coconut because I like coconut. It came out super moist and delicious. Next time I will try 1/2 c. oil, 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce, and 1/2c. plain greek yogurt. And if I want to give it to my chocoholic friends, I will add 1/2c. chocolate chips too.

Best cake ever! Reduced the oil to 1 cup like other reviewers. Also substituted the walnuts for chocolate chips and added a tablespoon of instant expresso. Poked holes in the cake with a chopstick and topped with chocolate glaze. Soooo yummy!!!!

This is the best cake I have ever made.  Love the chocolate taste and is very moist.  Love it and will make it again for sure.  I iced it with a creme cheese icing.  Excellent.  I also made it in a bunt pan.  Everyone loved it!!!!

This cake was such a moist and delicious cake.  I don't do a lot of baking but I thought it was extremely easy to make and you don't even taste the zucchini in it.  I replaced the walnuts with mini chocolate chips for the  and used only 1 cup of vegetable oil.  I also cut down the sugar to just about a 1/1/4 cups.  I also baked my cake it in a bundt pan at 350 degrees for 55 minutes. I would definitely make this fabulous zucchini cake again!

Like other reviewers, I reduced the oil.  I cut it down to 1 cup, and added water to make up the moisture.  I thought it was still a bit greasy, but it tasted great.  I loved it, and will definitely make it again.  I'm only giving four stars because I didn't make it as written, and it would be too oily that way.  We tried half iced with a chocolate buttercream, and half without icing.  It's great both ways, depending if you prefer more or less sweet.  If you want it for a sweet snack, skip icing.  If you want it to be more decadent, add the icing.

I actually made it by trading out half the flour for Montana Whole Wheat flour, and half the oil for applesauce. Then, I added 2 tsp Espresso powder, and 3/4 cup chocolate chips instead of walnuts. I made it in a bunt pan a sprinkled powdered sugar on it. Everyone LOVED it!

Love this recipe. I added a hand full of chocolate chips and a hand full of white chocolate chips on top before baking.  Also, I only need to bake for 45 minutes at max in an aluminum pan.

This was absolutely delicious!  I made a few changes (only because of personal preference).  I always substitute unsweetened applesauce in place of oil.  I think it makes it very moist, but not oily.  I always double the cinnamon and I added 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I omitted the walnuts, just because I didn't have any.  This recipe made 4 small loaves.  I wrapped and froze 3 loaves to take with me to any upcoming holiday parties- they will start soon.  This recipe was so delicious!!

I agree with everybody that this is a very moist brownie.  Great chocolate flavor and cant detect zuchini except an occasional bit of green.  My only problem with it is that at the beginning, due to the dryness of the batter... the sugar didnt completely disolve giving a noticeable grainy texture when chewing.  I will definitely be making this again but will try to disolve the sugar before adding.  Im surprised I didnt see anyone else having trouble like this.

Made it just the way it says except I used pecans. Topped with brown sugar cream cheese icing. Kids helped make it and we all think its one of the best cakes we have EVER ate. I think you need to put the  cinnamon in, yum.

Really really good.  Made it for my husband's birthday, everyone loved it.    I did omit the nuts and added a tsp. of vanilla because it's something I always like to add if it isn't in the recipe and my husband doesn't like nuts in cake.  So very nice and moist.  Wouldn't need frosting, but I did frost because it was for a birthday!  This is definitely a keeper and good use for those zucchini.

I really like this cake. I made it into cupcakes and got 32. The only variations that I made were to add 1 tsp. vanilla and substitute 1/2 C. applesauce for 1/2 C. oil. Delicious!

I have to say I am disappointed with this cake. The reason for this is that zucchini cannot be detected because of chocolate, and zucchini is not even needed here given the flavour.

I also substituted flour with whole wheat and had only 3/4 cup of sugar and that seemed plentiful. I also added another 1/2 cup of walnuts.  I baked it in a muffin/cupcake format and got 16 out of it. The ones that I baked in the light muffin pan were crispier.  The total time was 60 min. It was nice and moist, but the taste was all chocolate (not bitter) and it was too greasy. 

If I were to do it again, I would omit chocolate entirely or do 1/4 cup or just lightly dust the top. I also would substitute sugar with Xilitol  have one cup of almond meal mixed with water instead of oil, and again do it in a muffin cup. I want zucchini to shine.

This is GREAT recipie as is w/walnuts and/or chocolate chips.  If you find it bitter it might be you prefer milk vs. dark chocolate & could alter with other reviewers suggestions. 24 cupcakes took about 38 min in a 350 convention oven.  1 1/2 cups of oil is a whole lot of fat & I doubt you could cut back w/o applesauce or other substitions b/c the batter is just right as is.  I'm going to try a lower fat version next time and maybe the partial stevia substation a diabetic family suggested in another review.  My daughter actually requested these for her birthday and her picky friends had NO idea there was a veggie in here.  Dusting w/confectioners sugar instead of frosting.

I omitted the cinnamon and I reduced the oil to 1c. substituted water for the remainder, next time I would use cold strong coffee instead of the water to enhance the chocolate flavor.

I substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts and dusted the cake with confectionery sugar.  It was the most moist cake I've ever had.  The chocolate flavor was rich and you would never know it's made with zucchini. Everyone at the party raved about the cake, especially my niece who is a trained chef.   She loved it so much,  I'm making this cake for her today. This cake is phenomenal.

Made it twice. Reduced the oil and cocoa as others have mentioned.  Oil, 1 cup. Cocoa, 2/3 cup. Baked in a larger rectangular pan and added Peanutbutter chips! Both time it didn't even last 8 hours! Great use for all that zucchini.

Very moist and easy to make. I added only a 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 1/4 cups of oil. I also made cupcakes instead, cooked for 22 minutes and they are perfect.
I will be making these again, I will try apple sauce in place of some of the oil and sugar to cut the calories back a little bit.

I replaced 1/2 c of oil with yogurt and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2.  It was just ok but next time I will add at least 1 3/4 c of sugar.  It was super moist and delicious!!! Kids enjoyed it!!!

This is absolutely delicious and already I've had several requests for the recipe.  I made minimal changes: substituted half of the oil with fruit puree (have used apple, blueberry, pear all work), chocolate chips instead of walnuts, and doubled the cinnamon.  My zucchini measure is "generous".  Didn't bother to ice, it's that good.

I thought this was great!  I forgot the vanilla and it was still wonderful!  I used the mini chips and tossed in flour before I added to batter.  I greased the pan with room temp butter and floured.  No problems sticking at all.  This will be my go to for chocolate zucchini bread.  So good!

Love this cake! It turned out moist and very chocolatey.  My family devoured it in no time.  As some others I baked it in  bundt pan, didn't change the recipe or cooking time at all.  I had some left over chocolate ganache in the freezer so I thawed it out and thinned it with a little water, then drizzled it over the cake.  Quite an economical cake, lots of chocolate flavour with no fancy ingredients (unless your idea of fancy is zucchini!) Will most definitely make this one again

Delicious and not too sweet. Great without icing. I added more walnuts than called for (and toasted them first) and a cup or so of chocolate chips because chocolate. The cake was a bit greasy on the plate so next time I'll try substituting applesauce for half the oil. Regardless, it was so yummy!

Sometimes when it comes to vegetables out of sight is out of mind and this cake is a triumph of rich chocolaty goodness! This recipe is so close to my homemade brownies I knew it would be delicious. I didn't change anything, just topped it with a bloop of cream cheese frosting.

Really moist, owing to all the zucchini. I added more cocoa for more chocolate taste. You can taste the zucchini just a little bit, but it's gentle and goes well so that's just fine by me :)

Replace half the oil with apple sauce. I halfed the sugar, apple sauce added to sweetness. Next time will add more sugar for company. It wasn't very sweet with half the sugar. Add 1tsp vanilla extract.

Others suggestions to try:
Frost with zucchini brownie icing recipe
Frost with vanilla powdered sugar frosting
Dust with confectionery sugar
To make it healthier do half all purpose flour and other half whole wheat.
Tastes better next day. Not as tasty hot.

Made it with some revisions.  Sorry but  as suggested by some, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and reduced the oil to 1 cup as well.  I did not add applesauce. I used Cup 4 Cup Gluten Free flour and coconut oil.  It was delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

Very flavorful and delicious. It made a BIG batch though. I put it in one pan and it fell when I took it out. Thought it was done...oops! Also broke in two like the Titanic when I took it out of the pan.

Oh my gosh, this is AWSOME!  I tried using only 1 cup oil like some suggested but my batter became too stiff to manage so added the other 1/2 cup the recipe called for. I also added mini chocolate chips instead of the nuts.  SO GOOD!

This was So delicious and fluffy. I did half the recipe and baked in an 8" square pan for 25mins. 
Also used only 2/3 cup of sugar for half the recipe and swapped out all the oil for unsweetened apple sauce. I would give this a 5 but there is no way I'd add all the sugar or all that oil.. It unnecessary. The kids love it.. And have no clue there is a vegetable inside.

This cake is yummy!   I took the advice of some other reviewers and substituted half of the oil with applesauce.   I also added a tsp of instant espresso powder.  I always add that to my chocolate  cakes...it makes the chocolate taste so dark and rich.   You would never know there is zucchini in this cake.   I didn't frost it, we just eat it with a squirt of whipped cream on top.   This recipe is a keeper...thank you!

Yummy, moist cake - actually, I made cupcakes! I used about a cup of unsweetened applesauce and the balance oil. I reduced the sugar to about  1 1/2 cups. Cupcakes took about 12-15 minutes baking time.

I did as others suggested and replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce.  I also cut the sugar in 1/2 and it came out moist and chocolatey!  I doubled the recipe and it made 12 full size cup cakes and two loaf pan size.  I will most certainly be making this again.  Also, it freezes well.

We had a  party with about 20 guests, needless to say it went quickly.  It was a raging success for our Father's Day celebration, and not one person didn't enjoy it.  I left out the walnuts, as I didn't feel like making an extra trip.  Great recipe I will make it again, hopefully sometime soon.

Changes: half whole wheat flour (1 cup) & half AP flour (1 cup), instead of 1 3/4 cup oil made with 1/2 cup canola and 1/2 cup applesauce, eliminated nuts. Baked in 2 loaf pans for chocolate zucchini bread. Moist and delicious. Thanks for the recipe! Note: 3 cups shredded zucchini is about 1 1/2 regular store bought size zucchinis.

Thank you for a good basic recipe. Exceptions were 1/2 oil replaced with applesauce and Splenda baking mix for sugar.  The cake was moist and sliced well but didn't have enough of that rich chocolate taste I was craving.  Next time, I'll replace cinammon with  espresso granules and frost with a rich chocolate concoction.  Might add chocolate chips, too.

Delicious! I did not add walnuts. I made half this recipe. I used some apple sauce instead of the oil. This was moist and yummy! Update: I made this again using only oil, no applesauce and I added the walnuts. Fantastic!!!

As per othe reviewer's advice, I used only 1 cup oil. I decreased sugar to 1-1/2 cups sugar but will increase to 1-3/4 cups the next time I make it as I didn't find it sweet enough.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 cup choco chips. Did not add cinnamon. This makes a nice dense cake.  The cake actually gets more delicious the longer it stays.

Very nice and moist. I didn't have enough vegetable oil so I used 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup apple sauce. Didn't have walnuts so I used the same amount in chocolate chips. I baked it in a bundt cake pan for the same amount of time. Good flavor, texture, moist. Nothing to complain about. My four year old wrinkled her nose at the green zucchini going in but gobbled up the finished product. lol Will make again and again.

Made this for my Dad's birthday and it came out better than I had hoped!  I made it into two loaves and the baking time turned out to be a little over an hour.  I also replaced the oil entirely with canned pumpkin and replaced the cinnamon with espresso powder (about 3/4 tsp).  Instead of the nuts, I used 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips which added that extra level of decadence.  Ended it with a drizzle of melted chocolate.  Noms!

I've made the cake but I want to frost it. Anyone have a decent non-dairy frosting (I don't like adding milk to frostings) suggestion for this one? 
I'll let you know my review after the frosting and after I have tried the cake ;)

Excellent recipe!! I didn't have any problems with over-sweetness or bitterness like some of the reviews mentioned. I made two round cakes with these quantities and my family and friends loved it - and none of them would ever have known it had zucchini if I hadn't told them afterwards! Will definitely make again.

I just took this cake out of the oven.  When I turned it over onto a plate, a small piece broke off and I couldn't resist eating it.  It was delicious!!  I was afraid that I would be able to taste the zucchini but you can't even tell it's in there.  I made this in 2 loaf pans so I can freeze half.  I also only used 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce.  Came out perfect.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added an extra egg and only needed to bake for 40 minutes, it would be too long to bake the recommended time (9x13 pan, I am at higher altitude). The mixture is very thick if you wait to add zucchini at the end as directed but is just right once zucchini is added. I added slightly less sugar by choice and not quite as much cocoa only because I was running low. Very nice results. I might try addinng some vanilla flavor next time and of course full cocoa amount.

Love this recipe. Changes: 1/2 sugar and brown instead of white, split the oil to 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce. This is the third time I'm making this recipe and I'm sure I'll make it again. - Becca

Like another poster suggested I used 3/4c applesauce and 3/4c coconut oil (instead of 1.5c oil). Also used 1 3/4c whole wheat flour instead of white. AMAZING cake :)

This is a great cake, just like the heading described ... I will definitely make this again.  I did not use cinnamon or nuts because of personal taste, but that is no discredit to the recipe.  This is also a great use of zucchini! To the rates that said it was too moist, my advise is to take the grated zucchini and wring it in a dry dishcloth. This will remove the watery moisture, but still leave the zucchini.  Also, you use more zucchini this way.

Excellent. Only used 1 c. veg. oil. and baked it 45 min. Perfectly moist. Oops also didn't have enough white sugar so used a 1/4 c of brown for the diff. Definitely ck doneness sooner than you would think. Depending on the amount of zucchini used, etc. that will make a huge difference.

This is a great, moist, dense cake.  A little goes a long way, but it's delicious.  I didn't change anything to the recipe and it came out perfect as is.

I'm rating this recipe four stars only because I altered three things:

1. I used only one cup of oil 
2. I replaced the walnuts with chocolate chips
3. I used a bundt pan instead of the 9x13 pan

Very delicious and moist cake, surprisingly not too sweet! I used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site and it gave the cake the perfect touch of sweetness. Thanks for the recipe!

The cake has a bitter aftertaste. I don't know if that is from the zucchini skin. I used whole wheat flour which I wish I had not, and pecans because I don't like walnuts. The cake is not as chocolaty as I was hoping. 

The reviews on this cake were great so I feel like I must have done something wrong.

First time made it as the recipe stated, but wanted to make changes: substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, and next time will use only the applesauce, used 1/4 c less sugar, and egg beaters for the eggs.  Everyone at work loved it!! (I made it like a sheet cake, and it was so moist)

I didn't use nuts.  I put chocolate chips in.  I baked it in a Bundt pan. It was very moist and tasted a bit oily.  Next time I think I would use only 1 cup of oil.  I also didn't frost it.  I served it with a dollop of Greek yogurt.

I scaled the recipe to 42 servings as I had an enormous zucchini to use up and 7 eggs.  I halved the sugar (used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown for the halved amount) I halved the oil and used fat free sour cream for the other half as I did not have applesauce. I only used baking powder for leavening as I was using Dutch processed cocoa. I added 1 tsp of espresso powder, only used 1 tsp cinnamon. I used Robin Hood Omega 3 Whole Wheat/Flax flour for the all purpose. I had approximately 6 cups of grated zucchini. This made 3 very large loaves that baked in 75 minutes. They were really fudgy and delicious, smelled awesome while baking.

This is a very moist cake and my family loved it. Like other reviewers I reduced the amount of oil to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce. I baked it in a bundt pan for 50 minutes and drizzled a chocolate glaze over the top after it cooled.  Definite keeper.

This is a fabulous recipe to use up that extra zucchini that that everyone has on hand. This cake came out moist and delicious.  I used a bunt pan with cook time of 55 minutes.  The changes I made were as follows:  used 1/2 cup oil 1/2 cup applesauce, split the sugar 50/50 with brown and white, and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  I tossed in extra zucchini as well. This is a very easy recipe to follow or change to your liking and still comes out great.

Funny story, my husband made this for us one night, but since  we only wanted a small cake he halfed the recipe - except for the zucchini! Even with double the intended zucchini, it turned out great! This is my new favourite chocolate cake recipe. I am going to have to freeze more grated zucch so we can enjoy this in other seasons too.

This was so easy to make, and so moist! Made in a bundt pan , used 1 c applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, and added chocolate chips. It was so moist that I had to use a LOT of powdered sugar on top before it stopped just absorbing it!

SEE BOTTOM FOR IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!  This cake is scrumptious!  I made a couple changes: eliminated the cinnamon and nuts then added 1 tablespoon of vanilla, 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, and the zest of a medium lemon. I did not use frosting but, I sprinkled a thick layer of organic sugar on top before baking which gave it a tasty crunch and fun texture to the top.  I was going to order a professional cake for our family reunion but,  my boyfriend said to make this cake because it will be remembered more than a store bought one. I don't decorate but, he said it didn't matter. What a nice compliment! OH YEAH...IT ONLY NEEDED 35 MINUTES!!!!! DON'T SET OVEN FOR 50 MINUTES. IT MAY NEED THAT LONG FOR YOU BUT, CHECK IT AFTER 30.

This was so tasty. I used 1 cup of honey and I cup of xylitol to replace the sugar.  Then I changed the flour to 1/2 cup Brown rice flour 1/2 cup sorghum flour 1/2 cup tapioca starch 1/2 cup potato starch and 2 tea spoons of xantham gum to make it gluten free.  Was very tasty :)

Reduced oil to 3/4 cup and added 4 oz prune puree since that's what I had on hand instead of applesauce. Omitted nuts. Frosted with chocolate cream cheese frosting. AMAZING.

This was a great way to use up zucchini and very tasty. It's only fault is that, when it is without frosting, it tastes a lot like zucchini bread. Though what could I expect? :) It also bothered me that I could see bits of zucchini. Maybe I'll shred it finer next time.

This cake is awesome! I have made it more than 10 times with several variations. As another person wrote, it is a versatile recipe. For the first time today I have replaced all the oil with buttermilk (1c. instead of 1 1/2c. and 1 less egg because it was moist enough). Usually I replace half of the oil with applesauce. One person commented on their cake being bitter. It could be the type of cocoa powder used. If you are an individual that isn't fond of cinnamon, leave it out. Or add a whole Tbsp. if you are a cinnamon lover like me. Expresso powder can be added to enhance the chocolate flavor if the cinnamon is left out. Happy baking!

Made for small group - Herb's birthday (2015) - liked it. Not too sweet. Added pecans because I had them. Added white chocolate chips - they disappeared - frosted with cream cheese frosting. Very pretty! Moist! Tasty!

Amazing! Couldn't even tell there's zucchini in it, and everyone including my kids loved it. I often make stuff zucchini (cored and stuffed with rice and ground beef in tomato sauce) and needed a new recipe to try with the cored filling. This was perfect! The cake was super easy to make and came out very moist. I did not modify the recipe other than add grated Godiva chocolate instead of walnuts. Yum!

Super soft and moist. Very tasty. Followed recipe to a T except used chocolate chips instead of nuts. Took it out at 50mins on the mark, nothing stuck to an inserted toothpick. Topped it with cream cheese icing and crushed candy canes for the holiday season :)

Per the suggestions I too cut the oil to 1 cup and added mini chips instead of nuts, only because the grandkids don't like nuts. I used chocolate Cool Whip for frosting. Delicious! I'm making it again today. As much as I like playing with recipes. ....I'm not changing a thing on this one.

Wow. Amazing cake! Dense, moist, and incredibly delicious. My husband said it was the "best cake ever" and this is a man who says that cake is his favourite food-- so it's tall praise!

I did end up making a few adjustments… 
- Cut back on the sugar by 1/2 a cup
- Cut back on the oil by 1/4th of a cup 
- Omitted the cinnamon & walnuts completely
- Added about half a cup of shredded coconut.

Watch your baking time. The recipe says 50 minutes, but ours was done in about 30 min.  I will absolutely be making this again. And again. And again!

My friend keeps me supplied with fresh zucchini from her garden. Boy was I glad when I saw this recipe. For the most part I followed the recipe with the exception of the 1 1/2 C Oil. I substituted it for 1 Cup Chunky Cinnamon Apple Sauce and 1/2 C fresh Pear puree. It was sooo good. Very moist! I topped it with this sites Ganache II and sub the Bittersweet Chocolate with SemiSweet Chocolate Chips. It was KILLER Chocolate Cake! Thank you, Sandy!

I did as some did and replace part of the oil with applesauce, but it seemed still a little dry.  So I put it in the refrigerator while it was still warm and it moistened it right up. Hubby loved this and he usually does not eat sweets.

All I can say is "Have Mercy"! I left out the nuts because my child has nut allergies but this was the most moist delicious chocolate cake I've ever eaten. Used a zuc from my garden. I did not grate the zucchini, but instead kinda chopped it and placed in the blender. Then I kinda squeeze what I took out and measured three cups. I'm making this again this weekend because I have to satisfy my chocolate cravings. Used 1 cup of oil and I'm going to try the idea of using choc chips instead of nuts, what the heck!

I've made twice this récipe. The first time I followed the recipe and it turned out good, maybe to oily. The second time I only used 1 cup oil and that made a big difference. It turned out GREAT!!!! My kids (3 and 6) ate the whole thing in about 48 hours. Never found out there was zuchinni in it. Even with just 1 cup oil the cake is really moist, it doesn't really need any frosting.

This cake is amazing!! So tasty, so easy to make, very moist, and everyone loved it! It's a great way to use up extra zucchini from the garden. I also love the cinnamon in it. It's now my go-to chocolate cake! :D

I did not use cinnamon but added a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of "instant espresso" coffee.
Excellent use of zucchini that have grown beyond the tender stage.  If you peel the zukes before grating, no one will know that their rich chocolate cake contains the "green alien life form" (as one family member has labeled this versatile vegetable.)

Loved it! used the glaze recipe that Islander suggested and it was superb didn't take as long to bake as recipe said, but I just watched it and turned out fine! I baked half asd muffins and half as a cake! i have tried it both ways and i find its better without cinnamon but thats personal preference! all around great cake!

Delicious cake. I made it vegan by replacing the 4 eggs with 4 bananas. It turned out wonderfully, very rich and moist. I also left out the walnuts in case of nut allergies at the potluck I was taking it to. I think next time I will cut it into smaller pieces due to the richness (I cut it into 24 pieces this time). Delicious though and very easy to make vegan for my friends who don't eat animal products, a win-win.

Surprisingly good cake.  Very moist and used up extra zucchini. I took some of the reviews and used less oil (used a little over a cup) and replaced the nuts with chocolate chips for the little people in our house.  A hit for all.

Fabulous!  Rich,chocolatey moistness that no one will guess has zucchini in it!  Can't figure out how that works as my shreads weren't super fine.  Crazy!  We added mini chocolate chips instead so nuts as suggested by another reviewer,  Divine,,,

Used this recipe for my son's 2nd birthday party cupcakes - we had a lot of zucchini from the garden to use up and he is a terrible veggie eater, so I thought - the best of both worlds :)  At first taste I thought these were great - but later on I felt like they had a little bit of a bitter taste.  Maybe it was that our zucchini were a little on the larger side, but I'm not 100% sure.  We'll try it again this summer with small zukes and see.

I followed the advice of some reviewers and used 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the full 1 1/2 cups of oil. I also used 1/2 tsp cinnamon instead of the whole teaspoon.  My complaint was more with the texture of the cake rather than the flavor.  Even though I grated the zucchini very fine, I could still get some zucchini texture coming through. The cake was also a little too moist.  It rose and then as it was cooling, it really sank down a lot. I do like my cake moist but this was just a bit too much.  I would use a little more flour next time and cut back on the zucchini. Even my zucchini bread recipe doesn't call for that much.

This is a great recipe. The cake is moist, and very chocolaty. I made it with 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of one cup of oil.

Yum!!! I've made this and eaten it with cream cheese frosting and without any frosting and it gets rave reviews from everyone! Is super moist! My 6 year old even requested it for his birthday cake this year! Great way to use up zucchini and I've substituted yellow summer squash and it was just as good!

Very moist and tasty, BUT a bit plane and boring as such. I baked it in a round cake pan and cut the cake half in the middle and added a layer of  cream cheese with jam to give some more taste. Good basic recipe for a birthday cake.

I just made this for a party.  It was a huge hit.  This cake was incredibly moist and you couldn't taste the zucchini at all.  I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of oil and used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup vegetable oil and replaced the walnuts with semisweet chocolate chips.  I also didn't ice it.  I just cut it in squares and sprinkled with powdered sugar. This is a keeper!!

Excellent recipe. I've been using it for quite awhile now and have made a couple adjustments. I use 1 cup sugar 1 cup stevia, in place of the oil I use vanilla Greek yogurt. I frost it with chocolate frosting , my family absolutely loves this cake.

I modified this recipe a bit and it came out fantastic! First of all we are a gluten free household and to make this cake gluten free I used 1c all purpose gluten free flour and 1c ground up quaker oats. I did not use the cinnamon but instead used 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper to bring out the chocolate flavor. I used 2 tsp of baking powder instead of 1 to help make up for the gluten free flour. I did also take everyones advise and used only 1c of grapeseed oil instead of the 1 1/2 the recipe suggested. I suggest using a bundt pan for this cake if you go the gluten free route the cake will not rise. Another suggestion and what I did with it is to make a triffle with vanilla pudding and whipped cream.

This recipe is amazing and very easy! I have made this cake multiple times and it has been a huge hit every time. I use whipped cream cheese icing and chocolate chips in place of the walnuts. It is also a great use of my garden's over abundance of zucchini!

Very moist and great tasting cake. It was a little bit on the sweeter side for me so maybe next time I'll try making it with a bit less sugar. Decided to make them into cupcakes so it's easier to "share". I omitted the nuts but added some semi-sweet chocolate chips on top just before baking. Great way to eat zuchini!

This is a fabulous recipe, moist with great texture.  I made it exactly as written and we loved it.  Only thing I would change next time is to add more nuts, as we love lots of nuts.  I made a thin layer of cream cheese frosting for the top which complemented it perfectly.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made this cake for my husband and it was Great!  I made my favorite frosting which is Creamy Cream Cheese.  The cake was very moist and had a wonderful chocolate flavor.  I will definitely put this in my recipe box and make it often because it is so easy to make!  RRH in WV

Great cake!  I did add only one cup of canola oil to the mixture vs the 1 1/2 cups called for in the recipe. The cake came out very moist.  Topped with cream cheese icing.  Outstanding.  I will make this again - great way to use up  zucchini from the garden.  My 88 year old mother asked to take some home - that's how good it was....thanks for sharing.

I've made this cake several times and it's fantastic. The zucchini just melts into it. You'll never be able to tell it's in there.. I do leave out the walnuts, and I now omit the cinnamon as well. It's good with the cinnamon, but I found I don't really care for the combination of cinnamon and chocolate. Great recipe.

I used a bundt pan, baked it for 55 minutes, used 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup unsweetened applesauce, and glazed it with a chocolate glaze recipe from this site (1 can sweetened condensed milk 1 cup chocolate chips stir in sauce pan till melted, then add 1tsp vanilla, pour over cooled cake--it makes a lot so I only used about half of the frosting) family said it was delicious but a little dense, all in all a winner!

A very good recipe.  I tend to add more zucchini which makes it a more pudding like and it sneaks in more veggies for the kids.  Our family loves it.

I added a few tablespoons of flax seed and used whole wheat flour.  I also replaced 1//2 cup of oil with applesauce to make it a little healthier.  You couldn't tell, they were very moist and delicious.  I made them into muffins and added chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  My husband and picky 10 year old daughter couldn't get enough of these.  Will be making these again soon!

This recipe made for some excellent cupcakes! I made them twice; the first time I realized I had far too much batter, so I cut it in half the second time to make eighteen or so cupcakes. I made some of the same changes that other reviewers suggested, including replacing some of the oil with applesauce. Before I added the zucchini, I was afraid the batter would be too thick, but the zucchini brought in loads of moisture! I put in mini chocolate chips instead of walnuts and topped the cupcakes with buttercream frosting or vanilla glaze. I took them to a party and they were a huge hit!

This was delicious! Very moist and chocolaty. Quite addicting! I did, however, replace 1/2 cup of the oil with applesauce and added some chocolate chips in place of the nuts. (I love an extra kick of chocolate.) Next time I'll add a little vanilla to enhance the flavor.  But, don't worry about any frosting (it doesn't need it)! Mmmm... I'll definitely make this one again.

The most amazing chocolate cake ever.  You can't taste the zucchini at all, it's just moist and delicious.  It's not too sweet either.  I added a semi-sweet ganache coating over my bundt cake and it was perfect.

I followed another reviewer and replaced half the oil with applesauce, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cup, and used chocolate chips instead of walnuts (to make it kid-friendly). I've made it twice, once in a bundt pan and once in a 9 x 13. Both work great! I also used some dark chocolate cocoa in my second try! The kids liked it better with icing, but devoured it despite knowing it had "yucky zuccini" in it!

very good indeed!  very moist but light texture.  I used a bit less sugar (and used xylitol) and applesauce for some of the oil, a bit more than 3 cups of zucchini, all else the same, thanks for the recipe!!!!!!

This is a moist, chocolately cake and if you make it with shredded zucchini you don't know it's in there.  I frosted it with the chocolate frosting recipe listed by another reviewer (the one uses 6T marg. but I use butter and it frosted a 9x13 perfectly).  This also baked up in 50 mins for me.  I also left out the nuts for personal taste, but I also didn't sub them with chocolate chips like many have stated. Other then no nuts, only using 1 C oil, and 4 C zucchini and vanilla instead of cinnamon (personal tastes) it is a good cake.  The low rating is 1. due to my changes 2.  just not a fan.  I guess if i would of added the chocolate chips it would of been chocolatey enough for me but if I'm to break my diet for chocolate cake, I will stick with my very moist dark chocolate cake recipe.  I have a lot of zucchini this year and most years that I usually freeze for use in soups/stews in the winter.  As for making it into breads or cake i do now have a bread recipe that I will make again but I would only make this again IF I get an abundance of zucchini that I froze and made into breads.  Thanks for sharing it's a good recipe with some slight tweaking but just not my cup of tea. :)

Great flavour but came out very heavy. I used one of those giant end of season zucchinis and I think there was higher water content than average so I'll drain/squeeze it next time.  I made a sour cherry filling using sour cherries, sugar & cornstarch cooked for until thickened, and then iced with chocolate buttercream.  Froze the cakes when cool before icing, then again between crumb coat and final icing.

I made this cake twice using a 9 X 13 pan and it was awesome.  Very moist.  The third time I used a Silicone fluted pan.  Adjusted the baking time to 50 min but found it slightly dry, but still good.  I used a boiled chocolate frosting!

I had a ginormous zucchini and didn't know what to do with it. I'd already fried some and made bread. I am so glad I tried this recipe. The cake tasted like a Betty Crocker cake. No one can even tell there's zucchini in it. I will definitely make this again.

An awesome, moist chocolate cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and made butter cream frosting for it.  It was great and my husband had two big pieces.  Would also be good with chocolate butter cream or cream cheese frosting.  A delicious way to use up the fresh garden zucchini that's coming in now!

I've made this cake a number of times now - and as written it is a bit oily in my opinion.  I now use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the 1 1/2 cup of oil and it is still very moist.  We don't like nuts in our cake, so we substitute chocolate chips.  It makes a large bundt cake - an excellent cake with the noted substitutions (that many reviewers have already noted).  This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe in the summer when I'm using up zucchini!

It's hard to wait for this to come out to give it 5 stars - I have a good feeling about this one; but how can there be a choc cake recipe without vanilla?? I added some... Also, I definitely replaced more than half the oil with applesauce. It came out perfect.

VERY CHOCOLATEY and moist.  I did cut the oil to 1 cup.  2 cups would've been WAY too much....THIS CAKE DOES NOT NEED ICING. icing is really guilding the lily..... The only down side to this cake is that my zuchinni was visible.  It doesn't show in the photo, but it was visible . Maybe if I had peeled it? or maybe if I had pureed it?

This is a wonderful cake. After reading other reviews I cut the oil to 1 cup. Took no time to put together.  I have one more way of using up all the zuchinni.  I will add this to my recipe file to make again.   I am going to make some and freeze them.

Wow! Wanted to pull up that 2nd zuc. plant (one's usually too many) but with this recipe, I 'm keeping it! I omitted the nuts, added shredded cocoanut, dark and semi sweet chips, less oil, used applesauce, and now have a new fav. Thanks!

This cake is so yummy and moist!  One of my favorite cakes to make.  It uses a lot of shredded zucchini up, so that is always a plus!  I will make this one over and over!

Anything that gets my son to eat vegetables is great in my book..and this is super yummy! Substitutions: whole wheat flour instead of whole purpose. Subbed applesauce for 1/2 of the oil. Used a sugar/truvia blend instead of sugar. I also used 1 T of instant coffee dissolved in 2 T hot water so as to bring out more chocolate flavor. To cut down on sugar, I just slighly melt a bit of frosting and drizzle it on the top. Delicious...and my son thinks he's just getting chocolate cake!

I don't give many 5's, but this was quick, easy, and a great use (disguise) of zucchini.  Loved it.  I also topped it with the peanut butter frosting and the combo was A-mazing.

This cake was awesome.  My 21 year old son loved it and couldn't believe I used zucchini. I used the cup of chocolate chips.  Shared it with many friends who said they had zucchini coming out of their ears!!

Excellent cake!  Followed others' advice and subbed some applesauce for oil, also added 1 1/2 cups choc chips, which was almost too many.  A cup would have been plenty.  Used 9x13 and mine was done in 40 minutes.  Very moist and very good flavor.  For icing, I microwaved a can of store bought icing and poured it over the cake.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe with some modifications to make a wedding cake for friends with specific requirements regarding use of organic and "healthier" alternatives.  To meet their requests I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, eggs from free range chickens and organic sugar.  The batter ended up too thick, more like a dough, so i thinned it with almond milk before adding the zucchini.  The result was a fantastic, moist, fudgey cake that everyone loved.

I've made this with the traditional gluten-free three-flour blend and a tad of xanthan gum, and it is fantastic!  My picky four year old stirred the 3 cups of zucchini in herself, then gobbled it down when it was baked, proclaiming that "You can't taste the zucchini!"

I've made this a couple of times, but I always turn them into cupcakes! I generally end up doubling the recipe or even tripling when zucchini season comes around. These are a hit! People adore them. I do make sure to add dark chocolate chips to the batter in stead of walnuts (allergies)... and it makes them a nice not to rich treat. Sometimes I ice them, sometimes I don't - either way, adored.

Like everyone else's reviews, I used only 1 cup of oil but I did NOT use applesauce to compensate. 1 cup of oil was just fine. I went a little overboard with the zucchini (perhaps 3 cup 1/4) to make it more moist. Otherwise - it is perfect! The texture is fluffy and it is not too sweet, which makes putting a frosting just the right, as it won't make the cake so sweet to the point feeling sick.  The recipe is easy and very straightforward!  Highly recommend it.

Edit: I made this again and replaced the nuts for chocolate chips. Turned out so much chocolately - even better than my first try.

No creaming the butter!  That makes the recipe extra easy AND delicious.  I made it just as the recipe states except I used special dark cocoa powder to make it even more dark and fudgy.  About half the cinnamon just because of our personal tastes.

I'm not a fan of chocolate cake, but of all the ones I've tasted, I would have to say this was one of the best.  I did not put in walnuts or cinnamon and I halved the recipe as well. I also used about 3 parts applesauce to 1 part oil for the portion that was supposed to be all oil.  I made two 7 inch round cakes and used a cream cheese/cool whip/oreo/sugar frosting between the cakes to make a "giant oreo."  I also spread this frosting on top and that was probably another reason I thought this was so good!

I followed this recipe exactly except for two changes. I had grated an extra cup of zuccini and omited 1/2 cup oil.  The cake was delicious, moist and not overly sweet which is good for me . I used cream cheese-vanilla-icing sugar-soya milk for an icing to give the extra sugar boost and it looked like a cake out of a magazine. Thank you very much....

I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil rather than a whole 1 1/2 cups of oil, as well as chocolate chips for walnuts and it turned out great! Cooked it in a bundt pan for 50 minutes.

So moist! So chocolatey!  My family ate it all up, and I used a lot of zucchini from the garden. Next time I will make it with no nuts.

Amazing cake, no frosting needed.  My husband and our friends loved this cake.  I did use applesauce for half of the oil. The cake is super moist and good. I made the cake in a bundt pan and sprinkled the cake (after it cooled)with powdered sugar.

This was my first attempt baking a cake with coco powder, as well as,zuchini. I will definitely be making it again. I have been craving chocolate since I needed to adapt a healthier lifestyle. I used canola oil and cut the amount in 1/2 by substituting unsweetned applesauce. 1 Large zucchini was exactly 3 grated cups. I drained the zucchini before folding it in to the batter. I also used a hand mixer to mix the ingredient. Baked mine an angel food cake pan for about 70 minutes. Frosted with the Chocolate Cheese Frosting from this site. It was a big hit and everyone loved it. I didn't tell my husband that zucchini was in it until after he said how good it was. He said it was the most moist cake he has ever had.

I made this recipe, but instead of putting it into a regular cake pan, I made it into cupcakes!  They were really moist and weren't too sweet.  I added some vanilla yogurt to replace about half of the oil. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting and they were really good!

I love this recipe! It is a great way to use up all of that extra summer zucchini that people keep leaving on my doorstep.  I used 2 cups of coarsely ground LOCAL spelt flour in place of unbleached flour, and the result was TO DIE FOR!! It gave it a nice grainy texture and the taste was superb.   Also, I used 3/4 cup of applesauce + 1/4 cup oil instead of a whole cup of oil.   I think that both modifications made this recipe extremely tasty and probably much healthier. I will definitely make this one again!!

Absolutely the best cake!  I will be making it over and over again.  I had to leave out the walnuts because we have nut allergies in the house, but I can imagine it tasted awesome with the nuts!

For the amount of sugar that went in, it sure wasn't very sweet. I just tried a piece and for me it was just 'okay'. I may buy some whip or ice cream with a little rasperry sauce to sweeten the cake. Nice texture and moist tho.

I followed the recipe except for the following: Used only 100ml oil and substituted the rest with peach puree which was what I had on hand, cut down the sugar to just 250g, replace 1/3 of the plain flour with wholemeal flour. Added some flax seeds to make a healthier cake, and squeezed out most of the moisture from the zucchini with a muslin cloth. Baking time took just 50 minutes by which time the cake browned nicely. It was nicely moist and tasted just right, not too sweet.

Excellent chocolatey and very moist cake! Made it for my daughter's bday, and ever since relatives want the recipe and want me to make it all the time. You can't even taste or barely see the zucchini, and if I didn't tell them, they wouldn't know.

Delicious.  Made 24+ cupcakes and baked for 30 minutes.  I made them healthier - for half of the flour I used white whole wheat, for half of the oil I used pumpkin puree, and turbinado sugar instead of white because I ran out of white sugar.  Added a tsp of vanilla because all cakes need vanilla, right?  These were a big hit with my friend who is allergic to dairy.  It was his first chocolate cupcake of his entire life - and he's 40!

We made muffins instead of cake and my kids loved them. Even my zucchini hating hubby ate one before he realized what he'd done. We substituted 1 egg and 3/4 c. of the oil with unsweetened applesauce. I think if we'd used all the oil it would have been too much.

I also replaced 1/2 the oil w/ unsweetened apple sauce (so 3/4 c. oil, 3/4 c.applesauce).  I also squeezed out my zucchini before mixing it in. Wowie Zowie, this cake kicks butt!  I am not a good baker, and it was still easy.

This was wonderful! Unfortunately, half way through prep I realized I only had two eggs, so I threw in a cup of applesauce. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the oil by half and used applecause instead...so the cake was kind of a choc. zucchini applesauce cake. I also used full fat cocoa powder, so who knows if it was unsweetened or not? Great, great cake!

Finally, a truly chocolaty zucchini cake!  I tried a different recipe but it only had enough cocoa in it to make it brown LOL

The only changes I made:

Reduced the oil to 1 Cup~that is plenty!
Subsituted cinnamon with vanilla.

Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this recipe!  We have a garden this year and have been trying many new zucchini recipes.  This one is our favorite by far.  I did not frost this cake, but I added mini chocolate chips to the top, was great and my kids loved it.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

So INCREDIBLE!  I took it to a baby shower and got rave reviews. Nobody knew it had zucchini unless I told them. Super moist, dark chocolate cake.  I made this with a caramel frosting which made it super yummy.  Plus I added about an 1 cup extra of zucchini.  Hands down, this was great!  Will definitely use again(actually I've already made it twice).

This is a fantastic recipe!
But i did make a few changes.
I did use just the half amount of sugar, it is still more than sweet enough. also, only 300ml oil, and just 40g cocoa. but i used 150g of bittersweet chocolate, melted with 4 Tablespoons milk.
The cake is very tasty.
Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Thanks Sandy!  This cake is delicious.  I took the advice of others and used 3/4c  of applesauce.  Cake was moist and absolutely delicious.  Topped it off with Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni.  Will definitely make again!

Moist, dense cake with chocolatey flavour but undertones of 'healthy-ness'.  You could get your kids to eat it with icing or sprinkled with icing sugar!

I have to say that this cake was definitely better over the few days AFTER I baked it.  The texture at first was kind of "squishy" and it really turned me off.  It got better over time, though and turned out to be quite a tasty cake considering the fact that it had zucchini in it!  We frosted with cream cheese frosting...Mmmm....

This cake is super sweet and super moist.  I shared it with dinner guests and they loved it...even the 'non-zucchini' eaters.  Given the sweetness in the cake itself, I would not frost it.  I simply sprinkled powdered sugar on to give it a 'finish'.  I also sprinkled the nuts on top after the batter was in the pan but before baking, and only on half of the cake.  (Some do not care for the nuts...this way everyone could enjoy it.)  Super recipe!

I made this recipe for my family and my in-laws and it's the best chocolate cake any of us has ever had.  The best part of it is that it's so easy to make and it's fool-proof!

Absolutely delicious!  I even added less sugar than it called for, and it still was plenty sweet for us.  My husband is gobbling the whole thing up right now!

I loved this recipe! It was delicious! I was doubtful from the title of the cake including zucchini (!!) , but I couldn't even taste it...it tasted wonderful! My co-workers loved it as well!
