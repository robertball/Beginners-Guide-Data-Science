The overall taste of the ingredients was very good.  I followed the recipe, but it turned out to be very thin. Although it was messy, everyone like the taste of it. (Next time, I will add the "wet ingredient" slowly, mix until I get the right consistency, and then drink the rest!)

This is a hit at every party.  I use a can of the Woody's extra sharp cheddar spread and garlic powder.  I also recommend microwaving the Woody's and cream cheese to make it a little easier to mix together.  Perfect for a football party!

My mother used to make one similiar to this. Use Wise Spread cheese instead. Sautee the garlic. and start with 1/4 cup beer. Keep adding until you get the consistency and taste that you want. That way it won't be to messy or runny at all. Also when we make it we put it in a round pumpernickle loaf. We hollow it out, fill it with the dip and put the top back on. You can tear off pieces of the loaf and dip it or you can cut up some italian bread. While also using the inside of the loaf that you took out as well for dipping.

I followed the instructions to a T.  My husband even reviewed the recipe to see if I did this one correctly.  This was terrible.  My whole family tried it, including my parents who came for dinner.  It was thrown out.

I enjoyed this recipe.. I made 2 different dips, A spinach dip and this one.. I thought the spinach dip would be the good one and i was going to not like this one.. Turns out, i ruined the spinach dip and really liked this one. Maybe, the people on here who messed up used the wrong kind of cheese? Or possibly didn't get it whipped correctly.. because I had no problem making it. I loved it. Thanks.

This recipe gets 4 stars only because of the changes I've made.  Rather than processed cheese (yuck!) I used shredded extra sharp cheese.  I have made this twice now and used Guinness as the beer.  It was a huge hit both times and is now known as my Stout Cheddar Pretzel dip as I use it with my homemade hot buttered pretzels.  Hope these modifications help!

Great flavor in this dip!  I used fat free cream cheese and 2% skim velveeta and used a half cup beer(oops, misread the recipe).  I also used the crushed garlic that comes in the jar.  I tried to mix it with beaters, but realized very quickly it would not mix that way (I'm sure partially due to the reduced fat and not softening the cheeses long enough) so I put the ingredients in bowl over boiling water and covered it, stirring occasionally until smooth.  It worked like a dream.  Ate this one with homemade pretzels!

Awesome! My party guests went wild for it. I wasn't sure what "processed" cheese meant so I used velveeta. I also used a good ale. Let the cheeses soften and process. Slowly add beer until the consistency you want. I liked mine being a little fluid because I made pretzel bites for dipping. I made it a few days before the party and then dumped it in a mini crock to warm it.

I loved this dip, but made it a little bit differently.  My grocery store didn't have velveeta (I guess they're too good for huge hunks of processed cheese!) so instead, we bought 8 oz of Cabot hot habanero cheddar.  I cut it into several cubes, and melted it in the toaster oven for a few minutes, then just put the 8 oz cream cheese right on top for a couple more minutes, probably about 10 minutes total.  I stirred them together, which takes a few minutes because it is still chunky but I didn't want to burn the cheese.  Once it got a little smoother I poured in beer (a red ale) just a little at a time, probably about 1/4 bottle, to get the right texture.  It was amazing!  I was worried that using the unprocessed cheddar would make it too oily or otherwise a bad texture, but it was perfect, even when reheated in the microwave the next day.  We ate this with Mall Pretzels from this website - perfect combo.  The Cabot habanero cheese was very spicy - just a warning.

This was a great dip! I served it with pretzels and it was gone in no time.  
If you want to make ahead and refrigerate before serving, just heat on low in microwave and stir until creamy again.  Yummy!

Some may enjoy the processed cheese flavor in these, but I do not. Just a matter of preference and we all have them :) Anyway, this is a great recipe if you use a high quality cheddar cheese spread, one with real cheese and limited added ingredients. Or use a chunk of sharp cheddar you shred your self (pre-shred has a powder on it to prevent sticking together & this can cause it to be gloppy when melted, not smooth). If using cheddar you will need to heat the cream cheese and cheddar together to melt and become smooth. Cool before adding beer. Add only 1/4 cup beer to start to control consistency. You can always add more if need be. This dip is better if chilled overnight to allow flavors to mellow and develop. Great served cold or warm!

Tasty, but a little bland.  It was extremely thick, but I put the bowl in the microwave and heated it, and it was SOOO much better!  I will definitely keep this hot next time.  And add some hot sauce or worchestershire sauce like other recipes called for.

This is SO easy, and gets rave reviews at every tailgate party we take it to! To get the right consistency, make sure and use an electric mixer and cream together the cream cheese and Velveeta before trying to add in the beer. Make it a day ahead of party time to get the garlic to really come through.

This was sooo good! I used my food processor to blend all of the ingredients together, it made for a very smooth and creamy dip.  I also only used half of the beer called for because I tasted it and it seemed kind of strong.  After it sat in the fridge for 2 hours though, the flavor mellowed out and made for a really nice dip! I served with crunchy pretzels, but I bet this spread on warm soft pretzel would be delicious!

Loved it. i used The Doppelrock from Great Lakes Brewing Company and I swear that beer was made for this recipe.  I also added a few other seasonings including Slap ya Mama to give a little heat. People went crazy for it.

This was ok just not suited to our tastes.
