This a very yummy recipe and so darling for fall. I used orange peppers split long ways and they looked like pumpkins. I parboiled them for 2 minutes and gave them a cold water bath. I used leftover spaghetti sauce with added smoked sausage pieces. I layered Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese with the sauce. Cooked for 20 min with the foil on 20 min off. Perfect!

I made this using a classic bolognese sauce.  My kids were apprehensive, but it was a big hit with them and my husband!
