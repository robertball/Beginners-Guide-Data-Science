Awesome recipe.  I initially tried the recipe exactly as written, and thought it was too sweet.  I've made it another 3ish times since (..it's that good!), but with some healthier alternatives: whole-wheat flour, replace oil with applesauce and easily halve the sugar.  These never last more than a few days in my house!

These are great muffins.  I am on weight watchers so made some changes to make them healthier and only ONE POINT!  I used whole wheat flour, splenda instead of sugar and applesauce instead of oil.  They are still moist and delicous.  I did have to cut the baking time by about ten minutes this way.  My 3 and 2 year old children are enjoying them as we speak!  The only problem I had was the first day they stuck to the paper wrappers but today they are fine.

Holy cow!  These are great muffins, and I know muffins!  My family all loved them.  I used all whole wheat flour in place of white, and used applesauce in place of half the oil.
Thanks a lot!

These come out really moist and tasty. I frequently add raisins and nuts instead of the apples.  I also tend to cook muffins for 18-20 minutes at 400 degrees instead of 30-40 minutes at 350 degrees.

This is definitely going to be one of my "staple" recipes!  A great way to use your leftover pumpkin, as it only calls for about 1/2 a can.  I omitted the topping and made a simple cream cheese frosting, very yummy. This batter made 7 normal sized muffins for me, and I found that the baking time was a bit too long at 25 mins.  Next time I'll check them at about 20 mins.

Great tasting muffins!  I used Splenda and some brown sugar in the mix and added a little vanilla.  I also used half the amount of oil with a little milk because I didn't have any applesauce on hand.  For the topping I used brown sugar and added some oatmeal.  These were done in only twenty five minutes on 350 and came out really moist.

As good as everyone says!  I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup, used applesauce for half the oil, and baked in a 9 x 13 pan for ease-- no problem!  My 2 1/2 year old might have eaten the whole pan if I'd let him.

Awesome Recipe! Tastes Great! I added some extras like chocolate chips and raisins. And instead of two cups of apple, i shredded 1 apple and smashed in a banana with the pumpkin mixture. Then right before it went in the oven, I sprinkled it with granola. Great morning treat!

This was a great pumpkin muffin recipe. All of my children gobbled this up which is very rare to find something they all love. I did use whole wheat flour and they still were very moist. It does appear at first that the batter will be too dry but this is not the case at all, continue to mix and they will turn out great.

Excellent!!! I halved the recipe and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and feel that something would have been missing without the nuts.  Very moist.

We loved this recipe!!  I also left the apple skins on.  I also used oat flour and buckwheat and brown sugar (about half of what it called for) and they were delicious!!  Thanks for this recipe.

YUM! I made the recipe as is, only subbing one cup of whole wheat flour as part of the 2.5 cups.  I got 12 reg size and 24 mini muffins out of the recipe, but only had enough topping for the 12 larger muffins.  I did add chopped nuts to the topping and a few sprinkles of nutmeg.  Don't leave off the topping to save a few calories - it really makes the muffin.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it will be a "make again" here in my house.

whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and applesauce instead of oil. YUMMY!!!!! I do suggest using all purpose flour for the streusel though.

I doubled the batch and got 39 muffins (for Thanksgiving). Replaced the oil with applesauce, too. The streusel did not come together right for me...ended up with a chocolate colored "blob" of soft butter. Maybe I didn't work fast enough and the butter got too warm or maybe it was the beer I drank before hand. At any rate, these muffins are really good!  They have a dense texture. Not light and fluffy.  Also, mine were done in 30 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I found these to be too dense and heavy.  The flavor was good, though.  I just wish the texture had been better.  The first day, the muffin papers were difficult to remove and pulled off chunks of muffin.  The next day this was no longer an issue.  So if you use muffin papers, let the muffins sit overnight before you try to remove them.  I skipped the topping and just sprinkled the tops with some cinnamon and white sugar before baking.  I'm going to try these again and work on improving the texture.

I made these with applesauce rather than oil to reduce the fat content. I thought these were a little sweet (could be from the applesauce sub) ... hubby thought they were just right. He has more of a sweet tooth though! Next time, I'd reduce the sugar just a little and increase the pumpkin pie spice. This one is a keeper.

These are delicious! BUT be careful with the baking time -- in my oven 30 minutes was plenty for the pans on the top shelf, and too much for the pan on the bottom shelf

Quite moist and delicious.  I used canned butternut squash instead of pumpkin, whole wheat flour for AP, substituted 4 oz. unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 the canola, used 1/2 egg beaters with whole egg, and added a handful of quick oats.  For topping, I cut butter in half and used brown sugar instead of white.  Baked a double batch in a 10x17 pan for about 40 minutes.  Freezes beautifully.

Very good! I suggest sub applesauce for oil, use already spiced pumpkin in a can so you don't have to worry about the pie spice, and use red delicious apples.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the directions exactly and they turned out fantastic.  The only thing that I would do is add a little more pumpkin for some additional pumpkin flavor and cook for a max of 30 minutes.

Excellent! Had to use banana in place of eggs because of my daughters allergy, used applesauce in place of oil to make it healthier, and only one cup of sugar.

I would really rather rate these a three but due to my families reaction I won't. I made these this morning and ate one warm from the oven. I just reheated one and ate it with butter. I must say I like it better the second time. My entire family loved them. I thought they were ok but lacking something. The outsides were chewey while the insides were nice and moist. I feel the strusel topping didn't really do anything special. Next time I may adding a few mini-chocolate chips to the topping. See if that dresses them up a little. I would give this recipe a solid "ok".

Yummy!!! Best when adding half oil/half applesauce, 1 3/4 c. sugar, heaping tablespoon pumpkin pie spice, dash of cinnamon, almost a full small can of pumpkin, and 1 large chopped Granny Smith Apple. I made a little more of the topping too. The topping is a little crumbly, but a nice change.

I am a health nut and always looking for tasty alternatives. I changed a few things to make it low cal. I used 2 cups flour,  1 cup sugar, 3 egg whites and  1 apple. I also didn't need the oil since the moisture from the apples worked just fine. I had to also modify the baking time to 24 min. I added some oats to the streusels to add some grains.  I followed everything else in this recipe and it made 12 perfect muffins and only 170 cal each!!!

Good muffins.  I got 24 though, not 18.  The topping didn't work for me, next time I'll try a different mix, maybe brown sugar instead of white, my butter was straight from the fridge too but it didn't crumble.  Oh well, they still tasted good.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious!! I only had to bake them for 28 minutes and they were done. So 35 minutes is probably too long! They were very moist and the topping nice and crisp. Next time I may add another cup of apples to them. I will definently make these again and again!!

Very very yummy.  I made the changes as other reviewers had about the whole wheat flour and apple sauce.  Will make these again.  And next time I will use better apples, mine were not baking apples and were not sweet enough.

I made this recipe for a crowd of parents and kids.  They were liked by all!  I used applesauce for half the oil, and you couldn't tell.  Next time I won't use any oil.  With the added applesauce, I did think they were too sweet and will not use as much sugar next time. A guest said he liked them, and "he doesn't even like muffins."

completely fabulous!  5 stars even with healthier substitutions - splenda for sugar, applesauce for oil, and left off the streusal topping and used coarse ground sugar instead.  these were super moist, and really flavorful.  i much prefer large chunks of apple instead of finely chopped ones, but that's just a matter of preference.  delicious!

Everyone who ate one of these had to have 3 or more! My youngest did not like the apple chunks, so next time I am going to dice them. I followed the directions, but I did double up the spices as other's suggested. New all time fav't in this house!

PERFECT! The only thing I changed because I had to was I used more pie spice for the streusel instead of cinnamon which I forgot.

Very delicious muffins!  I used some other reviewers' suggestions: all whole wheat flour, halved the sugar and used applesauce instead of oil.  Despite the healthy changes, the flavor combination is wonderful and sweet enough for my family.

I made these today with my three year old and they are super delicous.  The batter was very thick (not like your usual muffin mix), but it produced an incredibly moist muffin.  I did use whole wheat flour, 1 1/4 cups of sugar and Mcintosh Apple for the batter.  Brown sugar instead of white for the topping. This made 12 huge muffins and took only 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  Scrumdiliumcious as my 3 year old says.

Absolutely wonderful!  I followed the recipe ingredients list exactly and couldn’t be happier with the results.  My muffins were soft, tender, fragrant, and had high, beautiful crowns!  Here are some tips to help you achieve great results:  First, I used fresh, green Granny Smith apples.  I always bake with tart apples so that the final product doesn’t come out too sweet.  They complemented the pumpkin wonderfully.  I filled my muffin cups nearly all the way to the top and used muffin liners for easy extraction from the pan.  Rather than making 18 muffins I made 12, plus 2 mini loaves to give away to friends.  I took the muffins out of the oven at 25 minutes but left the mini loaves in the full 35.  I lightly greased the mini loaf pans and the bread came out with no sticking.  One more thing, make sure that your spices are fresh.  Some reviewers stated that their muffins didn’t have enough spice flavor, but perhaps the spices were just old.  They lose their potency over time.  Happy cooking!

I chose this recipe to make for my sons 1st grade class. Thinking it made 12 muffins, I doubled it, since he only needed 20. Much to my surprise on the double check, it made 18 - which worked since I wanted to have at least 1. These are SUPER! My 4 year old loves them, and my 1st grader's class now wants him to bring snack EVERY DAY! I left off the crumble topping too, since I had to transport, and opted for a creme cheese icing instead. I will definitely hang onto this one.

This was great!  I took the advice from some of the other reviews and added only half the sugar, used applesauce instead of oil, and used half of wheat flour.  They are great and I didn't even add the topping making them a healthier snack.

These muffins are so moist and delicious!  I added an extra two tablespoons of oil because I felt like I was stirring it too much to get the batter to come together.  They are moist and perfect and the combination of apple and pumpkin is such a great fall combo!  I brought them into work and everyone has raved about them.

My family loves these muffins! However be warned that these may be too sweet for some. We never put in strusel topping on ours and they are still wonderful. Highly addictive!

Very good! I had to substitute the pumpkin spice with cinnamon and nutmeg...turned out great but I was missing the "spice" will do next time with the pumpkin spice.  The guys at the fire station ate these one's up quick!

I think this would have turned out better as a bread. The muffins were really dense and stuck to the muffin papers. I baked some in greased muffin tins and didn't have problems with sticking then. Overall, the taste is really good, but I think next time I'll make this in loaf pans instead.

Delicious!  I've made it twice in the last week and got rave reviews from friends, classmates, coworkers, and my kids!  I just had problems making the crumble both times.  I blame that on myself, though, and they still came out SCRUMPTIOUS!  :)

These muffins are moist and delicious.  I read the reviews after I made them and would, like many others, recommend reducing the sugar by half and substituting whole wheat flour for white flour.  I will make those adjustments next time I bake these muffins along with substituting the applesauce for the oil.  I ran out of cupcake liners after baking one batch so I made mini muffins instead.  Adjust the bake time to 16-17 minutes for the mini muffins.

So yummy! Used 3/4cup agave nectar and 3/4cup sugar instead. And instead of the crum topping, after muffins were cooked, I dipped the tops in melted butter then in cinnamon sugar. Delish!

Substituted gluten free flour in for the all-purpose flour, and this recipe worked beautifully.  Not only were they delicious fresh out of the oven, but the next day too!  I did double the dry ingredients for the streusel topping as 4 tsps of butter was too much.

I used pure pumpkin and added some cinnamon along with the pumpkin pie spice but still lacked flavour next time I will use pumpkin pie filling or use a lot more spice. But overall they were very good with the topping and addition of apples.

These were easy to make. But I find them a bit too bland and too caky. You can hardly taste the pumpkin in it. I used fresh pumpkin, which does superb in a pie with great flavor. But these are not very interesting. Just a sweet muffin.

Great muffins - moist and flavorful. I'll add more pumpkin next time though.

Excellent! I used extra pumpkin in place of some of the oil, but everything else was as written.  I  will make this again and again!

Absolutely fantastic! I substituted applesauce for the oil & cut the sugar by 1/2 cup to make a little healthier but still yummy. I even made a second batch for my diabetic mom with splenda and no topping-she gave rave reviews! Another delish sub- pears for apples, both worked great.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover pumpking and found this.  These have a good flavor.  I used applesauce in place of oil and Splenda for the sugar.  My streusal topping didn't turn out very well, that would have made them better!  :)

Deliciously different! I made exactly as written. I would like to try it will wheat flour and applesauce the next time i make them. Perfect recipe to use up leftover pumpkin. I have a butternut squash to use up and i plan to substitute it with the pumpkin in the recipe. I'm sure it will taste just as good!

Very good recipe!! I have made these 2 ways one with canned pumpkin and one with fresh. The one with fresh pumpkin is out of this world 1,000 times better, I also used a stick of melted butter instead of oil and doubled the pumpkin. I love this recipe it is defiantly a keeper.

Very good! My two year old who doesn't seem to really like anything sweet or otherwise loved the mini muffins I made and couldn't stop asking for them, I eventually had to cut him off:) I followed the exact recipe and it turned out great.

I'm not giving this five stars because I changed some things and don't know how the recipe would taste without my changes.  My version of it turned out really tasty, though!  I used a sweet variety of apples (Braeburn), so I reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  I also used about 1 1/2 cups pumpkin because that's what was left of a can I'd used a little from for pumpkin pancakes a few days ago.  I wanted to retain the nutritional value apple skin offers, so I just diced the apples without peeling them, and I left off the streusel because it just adds extra fat and sugar I'd rather not have on there.

The consistancy of these muffins were amazing. I did subsitite 1 cup of brown sugar for the white sugar, and for the streusel i only used brown sugar. It came out excellent!! I will use this recipe over and over again.

Oooooh these are good! I tried 4.5 stars...and the only reason I can't rate this a 5 is because they aren't pumpkin-y enough for my taste. Next time I make them I'll use the full can of pumpkin (15oz, or about 1.5 cups), and add a little less pumpking pie spice and add a little cinnamon. I used Gala apples chopped super-fine - didn't add a lot of flavor because they're not a flavorful apple. Haralson apples would be phenomenal in this recipe! I can't wait to see what my kids think of these. I actually changed the servings to 27 to use the whole can of pumpkin up, and got 24 minis, 6 jumbos, 12 regular, and 1 extra jumbo size muffins. Can't wait to make these again!

I just made these and they're great!  I substituted out the veggie oil for coconut oil and instead of pumpkin pie spice used nutmeg and cinnamon.  I didn't do the streusel part either.  Yum Yum!

I wasn't quite ready to bake with pumpkin (still too hot outside!) and had sweet potatoes I needed to use.  I roasted the sweet potatoes in the oven, mashed them up and substituted for the pumpkin.  The only other change was I used my jumbo muffin tins.  This recipe made 9 delciously moist muffins.  Will be making this often.

these are delicious! I had some old apples to use up so I did a search for apple muffins.  I stuck to the recipe but used whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of the oil, and 1 cup of splenda sugar, 1 cup of regular brown sugar.  I did not add the streusel because I am watching calories and fat. I made 21 small muffins (which took 20 minutes to bake) and 1 mini loaf of bread (which took about 35)  delish!

Very Good muffin. I used 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 white whole wheat flour. I also only used 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup apple sauce instead of the 1/2 cup of oil. I used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of the 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.

These muffins were great. I followed the reviews and did half whole wheat flour, cut the sugar in half, and substituted applesauce for the oil. I also added a little extra apple, like maybe a half cup. You did not miss the oil or the sugar. I made one batch with the struesel topping as written and then for the next batch I just sprinked some cinnamon and raw sugar on top and it was fine. So fat free muffins! (basically. :)) These will be my go-to recipe for healthy, moist, and yummy muffins.

These muffins were amazing.  Everyone loved them--no leftovers.   I substituted apple sauce for the oil and they were moist and delicious.   I used quite a bit less butter in the streusel and it came out great.  The muffins stored well overnight, but the streusel got mushy.  They tasted great, but if you want them to be as pretty as possible, make them the day you want to serve them.

Maybe my favorite muffin ever.  I made mini muffins and medium size ones and had to adjust the time, but that was all.  I bake the mini muffins for 18 min. and medium size for 25 min.

These were delicious. Following another reviewer's advice I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. I didn't have pumpkin spice and so used another recipe on the website which allowed me to use ingredients I already had at home.

Great muffins!  Very moist, flavorful, and tasty.  I think the recipe as is would make a great muffin but here is what I did different:  I grated my apples and used brown sugar in the streusel.  Things I will try next time are:  a little less sugar, my apples were tart so I used the full amount but will cut back next time.  I would love to try wheat flour next time.  I will also replace at least half the oil with applesauce, there was a small pool of oil left in the bottom of my pan when I removed the muffin.  Just don't think it needs that much.  Overall, a really good muffin!

Awsome recipe. Doubles the topping, there's no way there's enough as indicated. Used splenda in the dough, and used one egg and one and a half tablespoons of mayonaise instead of two egss. Moist & yummmmmmmy!

Because of kids, I didn't add the streusel topping (it just gets dusted off...) and I grated an apple as dice/chunks of fruit or anything else don't do well here.  As per other reviews, I reduced the sugar and added some white chocolate chips.  Overall, it's pretty good. THX

Big hit, very moist, the streusel makes them look very attractive. I reserve judgment on the apple--dicing them was too big, though they cooked just fine; not sure they really added anything to the taste. Use tarter apples? Shred them?

Very good recipe.  Everyone liked these muffins.  However, as written these would be WAY too sweet.  I cut the sugar in half and felt that they were still too sweet with the topping.  Next time I'll cut down the sugar even more and leave off the topping.  I think these would be good with fresh cranberries instead of the apples, too.

These were wonderfully moist and fragrant and disappeared in half a day. I did cut the sugar in half (used brown instead of white), didn't peel the apples, and used whole wheat flour. Afterall, there is also a struesel topping with sugar! I was looking for more of a healthy treat for breakfast.

Not too sweet.  Just perfect!  Everyone LOVED these.  It was a fantastic use of leftover fresh pumpkin!  I used Splenda instead of sugar, reducing it by half; applesauce instead of oil; and omitted the baking soda (because i didn't have any on hand).

Wow!  I don't review too many recipes on this site ... but this one I had to.  The muffins were amazingly moist and flavourful.  And I love my muffins!  I halved the recipe, used "Pumpkin Pie Spice II" recipe from allrecipes for the pie spice and added about a Tablespoon extra oil.  I was worried the batter was too dry -it is quite dry for a muffin batter but worked very well regardless.  I'm going to try this in a loaf pan tonight.

Absolutey delicious and moist muffins. I used apple sauce in place of oil, half the sugar, 1 1/2 cups whole wheat bread flour and 1 cup all purpose, flax seeds and fresh roasted and pureed pumpkin.  I will be making these again and again

Delicious!  I replaced the oil with applesauce and halved the sugar.  Because I like spices I sprinkled extra nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon.  They took 30 minutes to cook.  Super yummy!

I started this recipe intent on following the method to a 't'.  That went out the window when I found I was very short on pumpkin pie spice.  I made up the difference with ground cinnamon and ground nutmeg.  I had 24 muffins when done and 2 days later, I have 2 left!  Delicious and moist!! I used 2 mac apples and fresh pumpkin.  I like the other ideas given on the review, like the wheat flour and apple sauce and will try that next time but as written, this recipe is a keeper.

I changed pretty much exactly what 'RochelleJanine' did (kept the oil though since I didn't have apple sauce on hand). I also precooked the apples in butter/cinn/sugar (splenda) then added it to the batter. The cook time is much less this way at least 10 mins shorter to be sure. Delicious and healthy!

I just made these muffins for the first time and they were a home run! In a multigenerational household of 10 people, that can be a challenge, too. I made the healthy changes others recommended like whole-wheat (I grind my own), applesauce instead of oil, too. Then I broke up the sweetener by using 1 cup Splenda, 1 cup Stevia for cooking, and 2/3 real sugar.

The other thing I did was eliminate the streusel topping. Instead, while they were still in the pan right out of the oven, I spread a tiny bit of real butter on top. As it melted, I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon-sugar mixture. This melted the butter and the sugar and gave them that tiny bit of crunch on top.

Looks like we've found a new family favorite!

I made these for a women's breakfast at my church and they were delicious!  Very moist.  I did change the recipe a bit... 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 (will probably use less next time), added extra pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice, and I used brown sugar instead of white for the topping.  They were a huge hit!  Will definitely be making these again.

Delicious! Baked at 350 for 25 minutes and they came out perfect. I absolutely would do no longer than that. I also used granny smith, honey crisp & Macintosh apples....the flavors were great! Perfect muffin to have with your coffee on those chilly fall mornings :)

SO GOOD!  I also used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of granulated sugar. Also used applesauce (Motts with cinnamon) instead of oil.  I mixed in a few handfuls of chopped walnuts, YUM!  This will be a staple in my kitchen!!!

My kids LOVE them! I have a picky eater who does not like chunks mixed in bread so I shredded two apples in the food processor. It worked great. Thanks.

These are really good. I made half with the streusel topping and half without, and I prefer the ones without it. These froze very well and stayed moist.

Very moist! My husband who doesn't care much for pumpkin loved them and requested another batch. I used gala apples with a bit of granny smith mixed in. Gala are fairly sweet and soft, and granny smith are more sour and crisp so it was a nice contrast.

These are really good!  Didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp allspice. Cut the amt of sugar in half. Subbed half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce. Also did 2 c of AP flour and 1/2 c wheat flour. Hanging on to this recipe! Best part was that both kids had fun helping me make these.

These things are crazy good!  I substituted the veg oil for yogurt--plain vanilla worked fine. I also added some finely minced crystalized ginger to the batter, and added ground ginger to the streusel topping. I doubled the cinnamon, because I like extra spice.  The muffins disappeared in minutes at my office.

I made these muffins with a few substitutions based on other reviewers- used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 of the oil for applesauce. I made them a little smaller since I was making them for nusery school. I should've reduced the cooking time a little.

Love this recipe, but I think it would still be great if you cut back on the sugar.  I'm trying 1 1/2 cups next time.

This is a great recipe - perfect for crips Autumn mornings/days.  I modified this recipe by cutting the sugar down to 1 c.  I also used whole wheat flour and canola oil.  I thankfully had some pie pumpkins that needed processing, so I processed fresh home-grown pumpkins for the pumpkin puree.  Finally, I didn't add the streussel topping in order to save on calories and sugar. The muffins were still a good choice.

I really like the flavor of these muffins, as well as the health benefits. I used whole wheat flour, 1 cup of brown sugar, grated apple and applesauce versus oil. I did not use the topping, but I did add dark chocolate chips and cinnamon to the batter. These muffins were very moist and my taste-tester roommate loved them.

Fabulous - chock full of juicy apple bits; wonderful w/ pecans. I substituted sour cream for the milk w/ excellent results- no topping necessary. Worked well as loaves.

Healthed it up a bit by replacing oil with applesauce and replacing 1 cup flour with whole wheat flour & ground flax seed. They turned out great!

These were great! I also did the healthy revisions suggested by other readers - applesauce for most of the oil, reduce sugar by 1/2 , and I used a large egg white in place of the second egg. I couldn't believe how light in texture these were for being all whole wheat flour.  Next time I'm going to add some chopped pecans.   The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because I think the amount of sugar in the original recipe is totally unnecessary.....

This a pretty good basic recipe, as others suggested, I used all whole wheat flour and used applesauce in place of the oil. I also added walnuts and only used 1 1/3 cups of the sugar.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was b/c it  does not have a strong enough pumpkin flavor for me and I will use more pumpkin next time

It was tasty! Since i knew i would sprinkle the sweet crumbles which the recipe says, i used 3/4 sugar of which is required in the recipe, to make muffins. Everytime when i bake something with apples, i always wonder what kind of apples people use...i used Gala cuz it was on sale ;-) If i didn't sprinkle the crumbles, i would've followed the recipe. I'm sure i'll make this muffins again!

FANTASTIC!  These are delicious. The only chnge that I made was to the apples.  I used apple pie filling instead.  I did chop the apple pie filling into much smaller pieces before adding it to the batter.  These are delicious, especially with the Cinnamon Honey Butter off this site.  Will make again..soon!

Super delicious! But WAY too much sugar,they came out way too sweet. You could probably use half the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. Especially with the apples already makeing it sweet, you may even be able to use 3/4 cup sugar.

I personally didn't think the apples added anything to this muffin.  Overall though, these muffins were pretty good.  I added chocolate chips for an extra kick.

We all found these to be delicious, even after I cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and substituted applesauce for the oil.  I also skipped the topping to keep them a little healthier.  I would make these again.

Of the 5 different muffins that I made, husband liked these the best.  (he would prefer it without the topping.)  And we liked the apples in there. One large apple was enough for the amt called for.  nice recipe..thank you!

I just made these.  I decreased the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup, but they are still a bit too sweet.  Despite that sweetness, though, they taste fantastic.  They are nice and moist.  The next time I make them, I will probably cut the sugar by at least half, and maybe add white chocolate chips or chunks.

i have made this twice now, both times w/o the streusel.  still delicious!  very moist and flavorful.  i don't have pumpkin pie spice so i substitute 1 1/2 t cinnamon, 3/4 t ginger, and 3/8 nutmeg and 3/8 ginger.  for 2 C. of apple, i used one large apple.  it was slightly less than 2 C. but still worked just fine.  also, i used cooking spray instead of liners the second time and they didn't stick, so you can save yourself some liners if you need.

I'm sure these would be delicious as written. However, I modified the recipe to make it healthier. I used all whole wheat flour, apple sauce in place of oil, half of the sugar (and I used brown instead of white), 1 T flax+3 T water for each egg, and no streusel topping. They are so good refrigerated! Thanks!!

These are FANTASTIC.  I halved the sugar as many suggested, and the muffins were the perfect sweetness - used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 brown.  I didn't have a few ingredients on hand, so I omitted the apples, used olive oil instead of veg oil, and there was no struesel topping. The batter was a bit dry (maybe because of no apples?), so I drizzled some milk in to bring it all together. This made 12 good size muffins. I can only imagine how good they would be with the topping.  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic muffins! I made an extra big batch so I wouldn't waste the can of pumpkin - I set the recipe to 32 muffins and used 3 eggs (the adjustment is for 3 1/4 eggs but 3 was fine). I didn't use paper baking cups - just sprayed the muffin pan (check them after 30 minutes or so - I never made it to 35 min). I wound up with 30 muffins. I made some with topping and some without - excellent either way! We ate many, gave some to our neighbors and had enough to freeze as well. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I made this as a bread instead of muffins, that was a mistake.  The bread was so dense, I had to just keep cooking and cooking it until the top was completely dried out.  I still gave it 4 stars because maybe it would have been much better as a muffin.  I didn't have apple so we added a banana and we also added rolled oats to the topping.  Next time, I'll try as a muffin.

Loved this recipe, my whole family did. The only change i'd make is to replace 1/2 the white sugar with brown sugar and use brown sugar for the topping.

These are great!!  I will have to try the healthier recipe changes as some other reviewers have listed!  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, added some pecans, and added oats to the streusel topping!  The muffins needed a bit more baking time, but that might have just been my oven.  They turned out very moist!  Yum!!!

I made this for a gathering and everyone loved the muffins.  I used 1/4 c oil and 1/4 c unsweetened applesauce.  I also used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 1/2 c white flour.  The spice flavor is very pleasant.

One Sunday afternoon I made 3 batches of double recipes and distributed them at work the next morning.  I still have people coming up to me and raving about the muffins.  I also froze a dozen and brought them to a potluck a few weeks later, they were a bit more crumbly, but tasted wonderful.

These muffins really deserve 5 stars, the only reason I'm giving 3 is because they all burned after 35 minutes in the oven. I was still able to cut the botton off and we could eat the top. Other than that these muffins were absolutely delicious. Next time I will bake them for 20-25 minutes.

Pretty good!!!  Not enough pumpkin and I think I will add nuts next time.  Used 1/3 flour,wwflour and wheat germ mixture.  Will try applesauce next time instead of oil and cut back sugar as suggested.  But as is very good hearty muffins perfect to go with eggs and turkey bacon

These muffins were amazing.  Everyone loved 'em. I added about a 1/2 cup of milk at the end, though, as the batter was too crumbly to be able to easily pour.

Exellent muffins1 This is the first time I've tried pumpkin muffins, and they turned out great. I usually stick to chocolate muffins, which are my absolute favourite, but these were great, had a rich flavour and left a wonderful aftertaste. I do have to admit that if you expect the pumpkin taste to be very powerful in this recipe, you might be dissapointed. I added powder sugar on top because I had read in some of the reviews that the recipe indicates too much sugar, so I put less than mentioned. The muffins turned out a little bit less sweet than I wold have liked, so I think that if you stick to the recipe, it will be okay.

Awesome! Best muffins ever! I doubled the pumpkin and left off the topping, still great! I am making these, by request, for thanksgiving, with cream cheese icing! Super yum! I, unlike most others, think the amount of sugar is just fine!

These were very moist and delicious! I only use 1 cup of sugar and I replace the oil with apple sauce. Also good to add in 1/4 cup of chopped nuts.I have even skipped the topping due to time and they still turned out great! Yumm :)

Using whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, and halving the sugar doesn't take the taste away and makes for a healthier-than-usual muffin.

These muffins are already gone -- they were a huge hit at breakfast!  I grated the apple on a box grater instead of dicing (to save time) and the muffins turned out incredibly moist and delicious.  The streusel topping gave them a nice crunchy top.  Perfect!

This is a very good muffin recipe.  I reduced the sugar by half, and I used apple sauce instead of oil.  The first night the muffins stuck to the paper muffin-cups, and I though I might have overcooked them.  But, by the next morning they easily separated from the paper and the muffins were very moist.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I really loved these!! Such a great, low fat recipe, only 1 WW pt. I also used applesauce for the oil and splenda for the sugar.  I agree with another reviewer that if paper cups are used they stick until the next day. I think they are even better the next day, though. I love that they are healthy and still taste awesome!

Awww.. These were soooo good! I wish my kids liked them. My only advice is to shred up the apple if you have picky eaters b/c my one son liked it till he saw an apple piece and than didn't touch them. My husband said they tasted good but he also didn't cake for the apple chunks so I'm not giving up on this recipe b/c I really REALLY enjoyed them, I'm just going to grate the apple next time. And the crumb topping was to die for! It went perfect w/ these muffins! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! THANKS!!!

I double the apples it calls for when I make this recipe. But it is delicious!  They never last long when I make them.  The only thing I noticed is their tendency to be soggy the next day....this doesnt happen often, as they are eaten pretty quickly.

This recipe was great - I made them with my son this morning.  The only things I did differently was used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown, and I replaced 1/4 cup of oil with applesauce.  Very yummy and I'll definitely make again!

I made 100 of these muffins for my daughter at her school Thanksgiving feast. The kids like them ,but I think they were a little too grown up for pre-schoolers. I thought they were very good though. Will make again for a snack or breakfast in the fall.

These are great! I've made them twice this week and had people request the recipe!  I used half the sugar in the actual recipe, but then I also added carmel chips on top of the strusel....so stinkin good!

Super easy and yummy! I used whole wheat flour and 1-1/2 cups of evaporated cane juice sugar to make it a bit healthier and it turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

Make these muffins! As some reviewers suggested, I used half oil and added applesauce and used brown sugar instead of white. They came out delicious and I will make them again & again!

Awesome!!!  I didn't have 'pumpkin pie spice"  I used 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and a dash of cloves.  I used 1(ish) cup of pumpkin (pureed-not from a can).  

Yummy!!!

These muffins are fantastic. My entire family loved these muffins. I have made them with the topping and with cream cheese frosting. Both ways are simply great.

Have made three batches of this recipe to rave reviews from all taste testers at my work. I too replaced the oil with unsweetened apple sauce and these muffins were absolutely awesome. I have also passed on the recipe to six people so far.

I used egg whites for the eggs and applesauce for the oil and they turned out great, the apples were nice and soft! A great recipe to use up extra pumpkin.

I LOVE this.  I couldn't stop eating the batter!  I used a little more apple (2.5 or 3 cups), and egg substitute, and they turned out perfectly.  Excellent recipe!

I had enough batter to make 12 muffins and a bread, and while the bread came out delicious the muffins were slightly overcooked (they were in the oven about 30 minutes).  Making the streusel was kind of annoying and for some reason it didn't melt right on the muffins so the finished product looked dusted with powder.  If I make this again I'll add more butter to the streusel and be sure to take the muffins out earlier.  I did love the moist pumpkin/chunky apple combo!

My husband loves these. They are a little dense for my liking but the flavor is nice. I usually never make any changes to a recipe before trying it once, because it irks me to read reviews where people make changes then complain. But this time I cut the sugar becuase it seemed like a lot to me. I don't know, I think it would be fine with the full amount of sugar.

These are delicious. The muffins are tender and flavorful. I only had to bake them for 25 minutes and they were done. I used Granny Smith apples and, since they were fairly tart, I tossed them in about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar before folding into the muffin batter. I will definitely be making these again!

These were good.  My husband loved them but my kids not so much.  I added apple juice when mixing because the batter wouldn't stir together, 1/4 cup in all. REVISED: I made these again and they turned out better than the first time.

Thes muffins are great! DO need to know what size can of pumpkin to use since they come in different sizes and I used the BIG can and had to add some more flour and BS. Ha-ha. Great taste, i used applesauce instead of the oil and wheat flour instead of white. Also added alittle nutmeg and some vanilla. Will make again! thanks

These were delicious. They got gobbled up almost as soon as I took them out of the oven. The apple and pumpkin made a wonderful combination. I had about 20 people over when I served them, and everyone seemed to enjoy them.

These were great! I used dried cranberries and one apple. Used 2c flour and 1/2c bran.  Decreased the sugar to 1c and threw in a banana and a 1/2 c. Peach yogurt. Sprinkled with a bit of brn sug and some cinnamon.

This recipe was very moist, and it made two dozen. When I tried this recipe the second time,I doubled the streusle topping and added a little bit more flour into the topping. It worked out perfect.

I made these muffins the healthy way (as recommended by other reviewers) because I was mainly making them for my toddler.  These were FANTASTIC!  I wish I had put more chopped apple in though.  I am sure if you made the recipe as stated with the oil, sugar and topping these would be pretty special.  Will keep this recipe in mind when I need a recipe for a special occassion.  Wil keep making them the healthy way in the mean time!!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe very closely (didn't peel the apples and left off the topping) and they were great!  I easy and great treat for brunch or breakfast meeting.

I followed this recipe exactly as it is.  I made these for a teacher gift. My husband and I thought that they were pretty good.  However, my 2 boys just ate the struesel topping off and left the rest of the muffin.  They said that the apple was weird combined with the pumpkin.  They preferred plain pumpkin muffins.  Oh well. I didn't make it for them anyway!  :-)

These were really good despite adding one too many eggs by accident. Whoops!  Will make again!

I was not impressed by these. The batter was very dry, but I was not concerned due to the other reviews. However, the muffins themselves turned out dry as well. I also found them too sweet, which was surprising because the struesel topping didn't melt well. The only change I made was substituting whole wheat for white flour.
