This was amazingly easy and SO tasty! This is now in my weekly rotation.. The only 2 things I did differently were to use Jack Daniel's Dijon mustard, which gave the chicken a nice smoky BBQ flavor, and I used 2 extra large chicken breasts that I pounded down to about 1/2" thick. A quick note: Don't overdo the preserves. I put 3-4T on the first chicken breast because I thought the chicken breast was bigger and would need more. Not so! The preserves didn't caramelize as nicely as the breast I only put 2T of preserves on.

I don't normally like orange or citrus flavoring in my food but my husband wanted to try this and he was right. This recipe tastes great and I will definitely make this again.

I make this recipe so often for my friends, and they've all said it tastes so good!  I continue to make this recipe at least once a week and the taste never gets old.  It's a recipe that's guaranteed to please!

Thought it was really good.  The only thing to be careful with is that the apricot preserves are more jelly-like and less chunky.  The chunks made it a bit hard to spread over the chicken, but it was still tasty.

I tried this recipe last night.  It was wonderful!  I didn't have apricot preserves but I did have orange marmalade.  It was delicious!  I served it with brown rice and parmesean asparagus.  My very picky daughter said it was the best meal I've made!  LOVED IT!

This recipe is deffinately a keeper. I actually made this with Salmon fillets and was yummy! I was gonna make it with chicken thighs and realized i forgot to thaw them. Well decided to try the recipe on some individually wrapped salmon fillets that were easily thawed in hot water. Followed everything the same except for cooking time. Turned out great! Moist and full of flavor!  Can't wait to try this on chicken!

This was excellent.  I use the orange peel from the jar (Spice Islands) and it works just as well as fresh.  I had all the ingredients in the house which was even better!

The cracker crust on this chicken was great but the perserves on top weren't well recieved by my family.  The only thing I would suggest is keeping the perserves under the broiler for a little longer then suggested.

Delicious!  We made the gluten-free version using Glutino crackers and it still turned out great.  I added garlic powder to the cracker mixture for some extra flavor.  Easy and highly recommended!

AWESOME AND EASY.  The first time I tried this I did not have any apricot preserves so I used peach and it was wonderful.  The chicken still stays moist when you warm it up in the microwave.

This was tasty but I was disappointed that the cracker topping  did not become crunchy, rather the chicken pieces were soggy.  It was tasty enough and the family thought it tasted very similiar to a sweet n sour chicken.  I will try again with a panko breading.

Sorry, I wasn't impressed!  I was really looking forward to this because of all of the reviews, but it just really lacked flavor.  I even tried marinating the chicken for 30 min prior to putting the crackers on.  All I felt like I was eating was the preserves.  More power to you people who enjoyed it, but I will not be adding this to my favorite list!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. The entire family enjoyed very much and I was a bit nervous as my 7 year old can be a bit picky and I was sure if Apricot preserves would be a hit or a miss. He liked it very much. All the flavors mix very well together. May sure the crackers are made into crumbs. Thank you rSteinbock for this yummy creation!

The BEST recipe I've ever tryed here! I did not expect to be as delicious as it was! I used town house crakers and 2 chicken breasts, and followed the recipe. I cooked the first side for 15 min, flipped and the other side for 20 min (it was not done in 15). Then I broiled with the preserves for 4 minutes. I served with brocoli and rice. I wish I has some sauce to put on the sides.

I really liked this. I cut up the chickens into bite size pieces. Then put the cracker crumbs in a bag and just shook the pieces to cover them. It probably didn't take quite 30 mins to cook... I served it with fried rice and broccoli.

This was very good, moist chicken.  I loved the taste of the whole wheat cracker crust.  It will be a regular at our house.

This is my go to thigh recipe.  The whole family loves it, it's easy to prepare and it is so moist and delicious. I use Polaner apricot and it is wonderful every time.  I have made it no less than 25 times and every time I get rave reviews.  By the way... I change nothing!

I made this today and it is terrific!  I used Panko instead of crackers and brown spicy mustard.  It was moist and tender.  I think that you could use other flavors such as a berry flavor also.

Pretty tasty stuff, be careful not to burn the jelly!  Will make again - will add jelly late as a type of salsa next time rather than cook with it.

Very yummy!! As someone pointed out, the apricot jam is more chunky then smooth, making it hard to spread. If you have a blender, or something like it, I put it in that and blended to make a smooth paste. Did wonders and tasted awesome! Served with sweet potatoes and sugar snap peas.

Not having whole wheat cracker crumbs I made my own with fresh Wheat Thins crackers; a really bad idea: they were heavy and strong (although we love the crackers) and I had to scrape off the soggy bottoms.  Even though the chicken thighs were basically over-cooked they were still moist and with the other ingredients were pretty flavorful.  Exactly what whole wheat crumbs do you use?  I had on hand Town Club, Ritz, and Panko and anything would be better than what I used.

Really great.  I had bone-in thighs so baked an hour, crackers did not burn, rather than preserves, I poured some Chinese bottled orange sauce and sprinkled liberally with sesame seeds, broiling until toasted.
