These were really simple to make and very flavorful! I was looking for a more nutritious and filling muffin for everyone to grab a quick breakfast and these do just that.  The only change I made was using 1/4 cup of natural agave syrup in place of the sugar.  These smell great while baking and I will make these again!

Made almost exactly as described and they turned out great. Only changes , doubled the applesauce, used 2/3 cup old fashioned oats instead of cereal . Kept all the rest as is and cooking time was exactly spot on at 15 minutes. These turned out moist and delicious.

Good muffin, if a little gooey. Great basic recipe. I used whole wheat flour and added 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt, only 1/2 c sugar and closer to 2/3 c applesauce (probably why a little gooey)....the magic happened on the second batch when I decided to add 2/3 c wheat bran, and used 2/3 c (scant) dark brown sugar rather than white...mmm mmm good :-)

Fantastic recipe.  My husband will only eat breakfast if you send it out the door with him - so I'm baking half a dozen giant muffins a week, and always on the lookout for new recipes.  This time I had some fruit yogurt to use up, and the blackberries are ripe in our backyard.  I whipped up the whole lot in the cuisinart to break down the oats (hubby doesn't like any hint of "nutrition" in his food) and added a little more flour to compensate.  I stirred in the berries by hand.  Next time, I will substitute cucumber puree for the applesauce to add a little hidden green to his diet.

I made it following the recipe exactly and was surprised--and a bit disappointed-- to find they are not sweet. I liked them but will add a little more sugar next time.

These are amazing! We added streusel topping. Incrediably moist, unfortunately they disappear too quickly.

I used half wheat flour and half almond meal. Turned out a little sweet. Almost like a single serve cobbler/muffin. A little too delicious ;) Next time I think I will use an unsweetened yogurt and grind the oats to make them a little lighter.

My daughter made these for a school project and they came out great!  She made them even healthier by using whole wheat flour and only a 1/2 cup sugar.

I don’t care for these. The only change I made was using 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour. I wanted a higher fiber muffin, which these were. They didn’t rise as I had expected and were pretty goopy.

It will be a great muffin I think; I had really healthy blueberries so 2 cups was a lot, the bottom was moist & primarily blueberry.  I could still tell its a tasty combination when balanced. I did use  hole wheat flour and 2/3 c brown sugar . I look forward to trying again.

I added apricot preserves, 1 tbls oil, blueberry yogurt and made it in a brownie pan. I finished with a lemon glaze.  It was moist but dense. Maybe low fat milk?

I made this muffin using steel cut oats, plain unsweetened Greek yogurt, unsweetened applesauce and frozen blueberries.  Texture was good, but I found them a bit too sweet.  Will make again, but cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Oh My Gosh!  These are Amazing!  Instead of sugar I used low glycemic agave syrup.  Worked perfectly.  I will triple batch it next time so I have some to freeze.  I could eat the entire batch right now.  As an added bonus these make your house smell absolutely wonderful.  One of my favorite recipes of all time on Allrecipes and I make a lot.

These muffins are great!  They don't taste or feel like a "healthy" muffin.  I used whole wheat flour,  homemade unsweetened chunky applesauce, and plain Greek yogurt, and they were still plenty sweet enough.

We liked the muffins a lot.  I ground the oats, and I don't think they would be good without doing this.  I did not add much salt and would recommend doing more than a pinch.  I used large frozen blueberries and I would recommend using small one if you can find them.

Very good.  I did make some changes - full fat greek yogurt, reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Also pulsed the oats in food processor as another reviewer mentioned.

I think I would add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of coconut oil next time. They stuck to my muffin liners. Or spray the inside of the liners before adding the mix. I love the healthiness of the recipe.

This is the perfect recipe for flavorful, healthy muffins! I tried many substitutes as an experiment, and they still turned out successful! Here is what I changed: 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. regular flour, 2/3 c. brown sugar instead of 3/4 white sugar, and 3/4 c. applesauce instead of 1/2 c. applesauce. Here is what I added: 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/3 c. wheat bran, and 1/3 c. ground flaxseed. My hope is to use this as a base recipe for other muffin flavors by replacing the type of fruit and by adding nuts.

Made with 1/2c rolled oats and 1/2c quick oats (for the 1c whole grain cereal) and fresh cranberries instead of blueberries.  Everyone in our house enjoyed these muffins.

These muffins are hearty and tasty. I used old fashioned oats instead of quick oats, and only used 2/3 cup. and 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda, instead of 2 tsp baking powder. I also added a little nutmeg.

Experimented with this reciepe as an early morning snack prior to a day of snow tubbing. They were a big hit with the group. I was impressed by the moistness and I love using applesauce and yogurt instead of oil.

All fresh ingredients, used Quaker rolled oats instead.  The muffins did not rise, they just baked.  They tasted okay, very strong blueberry flavor (which is why it's call Blueberry Muffins), but they are ugly as sin!  Got to serve these in the dark.

Excellent recipe!!!! I made these as written the first time and they were perfect. The second time I substituted a browned mashed banana for the applesauce, used brown sugar in place of white and decreased it by 1/4, and added a streusel topping which I made from oats, flaxseed, brown sugar and butter. Delicious versatile recipe!!

These were delicious and my husband is not a bread lover but he said I can make these any time.  I used whole wheat flour and only 1/2 c sugar per other reviews.  My husband was watching our 1 yo grandson and tried to feed him pasta and he wouldn't eat it.  But he said he ate 3 of these muffins.  They are a hit with our family and we will definitely make them again!
