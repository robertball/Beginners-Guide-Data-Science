I was looking for some way to use the vegetables that I had in my salad drawer.  I served it for Sunday dinner.  Everyone thought that this recipe tasted so fresh, especially on a cold evening.  My 1 and 4 year olds ate everything on their plates.  I used a pint of grape tomatoes cut in half in place of the regular tomatoes and made sure that the other vegetables were cut into small pieces.  I also used regular yellow onion instead of the red onion, finely diced.  I added a chopped avacodo as well.  I didn't have time to let the salad marinate in the refrigerator, so I let it sit on the counter for about 45 minutes and tossed it occasionally.  In all, it was delicious!

I made this tonight and thought it was really fresh tasting. I used what vegies I had in fridge: broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, radishes, grape tomatoes, and onion. I also added a small amount of celery salt into sauce. I will definitely make again.

I will definitely make this again. I used halved cherry tomatoes and an extra green pepper. It was sitting in the fridge for about 4 hours and the flavour of the dressing really shone through. Many Thanks.

This tasted good and certainly looked beautiful, but it definitely wasn't 5-star good.  I guess this is a dish for the sugar lovers, which I am not.  I thought it was a little plain.  Some olive oil or some fresh herbs might jazz it up.

Simple and good. I stuck to the recipe exactly and got all good reviews. I'm a vegan/vegetarian so this was great and even better that no veggies were cooked.

We really enjoyed this salad. Love the perfect balance of acid and sweet and texture of the fresh ripe tomatoes and crunchy peppers and celery. I used red, orange/yellow heirloom tomatoes, shallots and a mixture of red/yellow/orange/green peppers to use up some stuff on hand. Very happy to find this quick, easy and simple recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This may be called "green" pepper and tomato salad, but I only had the sweeter tasting mini yellow peppers on hand, and it was delicious that way.  I did also have to substitute white onion, but I was able to use up those tomatoes in a very yummy way.  I also garnished with a little parsley, and it made for a prettty side dish.

The dressing proportions are just right for this recipe. Not too, wet, and not too vinegary.   I added a bit of corn kernels, and thought seeded cucumber might also taste good.   But, really, there is no need for alterations, as I thought this recipe was great just how it was! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious! I substituted cucumber for the celery and I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. Everyone in the family enjoyed the salad. Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this for my husband a few days ago and he has already asked me to make it again. He said the dressing is fantastic and asked me to try it on other veggies, like cucumbers and radishes.

This was light and refreshing. I recommend using fresh ground sea salt and pepper for maximum flavor since there are so few ingredients. I finely minced the red onion to give the dressing more oomph. This was a nice light side for a rich tuna casserole. Next time add fresh parsley

I've had vinegar/sugar marinades on veggies before, but this was sooo good!  I don't know if it was the cider vinegar instead of white or the combo of veggies used (I omitted the onion and used 3 colors of peppers) or maybe I was just really hungry, but wow!  Definitely will become a staple recipe for me!

Nice simple salad with nice flavour.  I tend to like dressings that are a little more complex in flavour, but this was nice for a change.

This was one of the worst salads I have ever served to guests. I know this because it was hardly touched after the initial serving. The green pepper was way too strong and over powered the entire dish. Very disappointing. Will not make this again, I'll stick to my own summer salads.

This was a great salad recipe. I altered it a bit, using tomatoes, celery, green pepper, cucumber, corn, beans and avocado. The dressing was nice -light and refreshing. I have been searching for different homemade salad dressings and this is one I will be making again and again, as its simple and easy. Thanks for sharing

This was a great base to start with to use up veggies I had on hand. I did not have any green pepper but used 1/2 a red and 1/2 a yellow along with 2 roma tomatoes and 1 stalk broccoli, sliced up 12 black olives and used the last bit of celery. My husband does not like raw onion so omitted that but added 1/2 t. onion powder. I also added 1 T. olive oil and 1 T. grapeseed oil to the dressing and added some bowtie pasta to really dress it up. I used splenda in place of the sugar. You can change this  in so many ways, just depends on what you have on hand that you want to use up. A very fresh, tasty and healty side dish!

This is a pretty tasty salad. I think it has a little too much tomato though. I used two peppers and two tomatoes and I still felt like it was a bit too similar to salsa.

This is great for anyone who has a garden and is being over run with tomatoes and green pepper! I tasted the original recipe and it was nice and light.  I happen to have some leftover pasta from the night before and mixed it in also and added some fresh basil from the garden and some feta.  I love it when nothing goes to waste! I gave it only 4 because it isn't something that I would crave but is a nice vege side for a summer dinner.

Oh, yum!  Even the children who "hate" raw tomatoes asked for seconds!  Great way to use up that late summer produce.

This was tasty. I omitted the celery because I didn't have any, and had to use a white onion because it's what was on hand. I also left out the salt, as I don't care for additional salt in my food.

Have made a  salad similar but this was real good.  I added a clove of garlic mashed in to the salt for extra flavor.  Then wanting to spice it up a little I added 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper.  Sort of spicy but real good.  I plan on making again

Very refreshing for a summer side dish! I added a large cucumber cut into small chunks and a small package of cherry tomatoes sliced lengthwise. My kids ate this up, and I cant wait to have more today. Thanks for the recipes!

I was thrilled when I found this recipe. My Italian mom made this for us for years and when I asked her how she made it, she couldn't remember. My family and friends love it. Thanks!

This was so refreshing.  Used a small container of cherry tomatoes, cut in 1/2 instead of regular tomatoes.  Loved the simplicity and flavor of this salad.

Made this for dinner as a change from our regular salad.  Didn't have green pepper or red onion so substituted with yellow pepper and onion; also did not put in all the sugar.  It was a hit; cool and refreshing.  My partner asked that I make it again for a dinner party tomorrow.  I know I can make it ahead and let it sit in the refrigerator until tomorrow...how easy is that!

This salad was EXCELLANT!  (Did not use the peppers because they are not my favorite.) Great way to use all the home grown tomato's.

Easy, fresh, can change veggies to suit your tastes and/or clean out fridge.  I used grape tomatoes, added fresh parsley and did not use the celery. Simple changes and it was delicious.

Loved this!  Served it along side grilled NY strips & bbq shrimp, but this salad is what my husband couldn't stop talking about!  Didn't change a thing, except I poured it through a strainer before transferring to a serving bowl.  Not necessary- I just didn't want the vinegar smell overpowering the rest of dinner.

Love this!!! Absolutely incredible~I added a medium cucumber as well because my garden is producing way too many and it is incredible of  course I doubled the dressing to account for the extra cucumber. I will make this many times more!

P.S.  I admit that I had been skeptical of all that sugar.  :)

So good!  Made just as written (except Baking Splenda instead of sugar), and refrigerated all day.  Great flavor, and just as good the next day and the next.

This was really good! I picked this recipe randomly and made it cause i had all the things needed. I honestly thought I wouldn't like it very much cause i don't like eating raw onion much but i was really wrong. It was a really yummy recipe! It's so fresh and the sweet taste made the onion and tomato go together so well. I will be making this again and keeping it in the fridge for a snack. Thank you for the recipe!
