This hummus is quit enjoyable.  The taste of cucumber add a different twist.  It is the first time I have made hummus and did stick to the recipe.  The only negitive is that it is a bit thinner than the hummus I am used to.  It could be that I added too much lemon juice (it was a large lemon) or the cucumber was too large.  I will make this again.

Yummy!  I didn't have the tahini paste so I used 1 Tbsp sesame seed oil and about 1/3 c. sunflower seeds in place of the tahini paste.  I used it as a spread on our sandwiches at lunch--that was a bit messy as it oozed out the sides, but very tasty on the toasted flatbread.

I found this really good! I LOVE hummus & eat it all the time. I always use cucumbers to sip into the hummus, but never thoughts about adding them to the dip itself! The only thing I did differently was add about 1/4tsp of Beaumonde seasoning (along with the other listed spices). it is just a personal preference of mine. Very good recipe! Thank you!

This was my first attempt at hummus and this recipe is easy, delicious and incredibly healthy. I also made the pita chips from this site. Definitely will make again. Thanks for sharing!

BLAHHHH! For those of you ladies who said you made this hummus for your first hummus are really missing out on a good hummus. I made it exactly as stated and it was flavorless. I added some cumin which is in regular hummus and more olive oil and it helped a bit but will not make this again. If you want a good hummus a can of garbanzos, 1/3 cup tahini, juice from a one lemon. Tbsp cumin salt, and pepper and add olive oil while its all blending and use lots of garlic. Then top with paprika  cant go wrong.

Good stuff.  The cucumber adds a fresh twist to this easy-to-make dip.  A great, healthy alternative for veggie trays.

Liked this, it is different, refreshing.    I don't add salt and used lemon pepper instead of black pepper.

Yum! The cucumber makes this really light and fresh tasting. I added a few chunks of fresh jalapeno (for a half recipe) to give it a little more flavor. Thanks!

Wonderful cucumber hummus.  It goes well with "Naan" recipe on this site by Mic. I used a large lemon and I think it was too much. I will use a smaller one next time.

I used a whole cucumber as directed but found this made it too watery.   I wasn't a big fan, but had house guests who enjoyed it.   I'd be willing to try this again with only 1/2 a cucumber (or less) for a more hummus like texture.

Great even without the Tahini! Like some others I didn't want to go out and buy Tahini paste because I wasn't sure that I would ever use it again so I just added some stir fry/sesami oil and a half teaspoon of sesami seeds I found in the back of my cupboard. Probably didn't even need the sesami seeds to be honest. I didn't add any olive oil at all for the recipe because of using extra sesami oil.  

Used 1 teaspoon of salt and a shake or 2 of paprika and this hummus came out amazing and delicious. If I had to redo it though I would probably have used a smaller cucumber because the one I used was so big I think the extra juiciness of it made the hummus a little liquidy. I'm thinking it'll harden up in the fridge though. All in all I'll be doing this one again. GREAT FLAVOR.

I have a ton of cucumbers in the backyard and I fount this. Delicious for a snack! I added onion and a pinch of cayenne powder, just a hint of spice.

This recipe is awesome! I've been looking for a hummus recipe that was different, and this hot the spot! I only added 2 cloves of garlic because my boyfriend complains I always use too much. It's still turned out wonderful! Definitely going to be a go to healthy snack!

Just so-so. I enjoy hummus quite frequently and loving cucumber I had high hopes for this but I have to agree with another reviewer in that if this is the first recipe used for hummus there is a chance that one might not experience the best of the possibilities and choose not to try other recipes. 
This is indeed a 'light' recipe and surely healthy but lacking taste such that the cracker or pita overwhelms.

very different taste of regular hummus even a non hummus lover ended up liking it. Its a refreshing taste that is perfect with cucumber from a garden. The taste is light and refreshing.
