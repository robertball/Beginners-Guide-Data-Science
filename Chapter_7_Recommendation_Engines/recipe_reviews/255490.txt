I really enjoyed this recipe and it was exactly what I was looking for. I had the pumpkin spice pudding mix, gingerbread cake mix, and canned pumpkin and wanted an easy recipe to use all 3. The substitutions I made were gingerbread cake mix instead of yellow, 2 cups of whole pecans and then I crushed them, added some pepitas, added a little salt to the nut and sugar mixture, and subbed applesauce for the canola oil. I really liked how moist the cake is. Itâ€™s also somewhat dense so I called it pumpkin bread instead of cake. But I had positive feedback and my relatives are asking me to make it again for Thanksgiving. Thank you!
