This recipe is awesome! I made it for a baby shower and it was a hit. Since then I've made it for another baby shower and a wedding luncheon, people asking me for the recipe each time. I double this recipe, using more cheddar and less sour cream and cream cheese (1 1/2 cups sour cream, 1 1/2 packages cream cheese) than it asks for and put it in a large bread bowl. I think what makes this so great is the salsa. If you don't have a really high quality salsa, it just won't turn out right. I go to the On the Border (mexican restaurant) and buy fresh salsa from the restaurant. It makes a HUGE difference and the result is amazing. I always serve with cut up baguettes, I don't like how it tastes with tortilla chips. I also increase my oven time to 2-3 hours when I double it and it comes out perfect after a little stirring halfway through. I highly recommend! It's one of my husband's favorites, no more rotel and velveeta for us! Thanks for the recipe Julie!

This is a hit. Great for a party. Friends had a Mexican dinner for 10 and our contribution was to be an appetizer. I didn't want to take a layered dip (good thing - someone else did) and this was perfect. I used a 1lb loaf but doubled the dip. When the dip ran low, I spooned in the dip that hadn't fit in the bread bowl (had heated it in the oven in a pie plate.) I served this on a big wooden platter with the torn-out bread and Fritos Scoops sprinkled around it. I'd been skeptical about baking this 1.5 hours, but after doubling the dip it needed at least that. Next time I will double it again but use a 2lb loaf (more bread to dip). The dip is yummy and goes fast.

Thanks for this recipe. It was a hit at my godson's christening reception. We also added a twist by serving it with bread squares, pretzels, and broccoli for dipping!! It was great!!

This is like heaven in an edible bowl!  I use the hottest salsa possible to give it an extra kick, and also use a bit more cheese.  I have only had raving compliments from family and friends!

This was fantastic, I did not double it, and it made plenty for 10 adults. I baked it in a glass dish, and served scooped chips around it. I did add cumin and hot sauce, used fresh medium heat salsa probably 1 1/2-2 cups.. will be making sure to make this often for my gathering or to take with me.

This was an excellent dip. I had a big cook out for Cinco De Mayo where I had many mexican dishes. This was was the one that everyone, and I mean everyone, raved over. And you can't go wrong with the presentation. The bread bowl adds a unique dimension.

Good but the bread was not good for this dip so I would just use tortilla chips and either skip the bread bowl alltogether or just use for presentation

My husband wanted a jarred cheese dip that I refused to buy him saying I could make one at home that was close and better tasting. I used homemade salsa and reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. Instead of making it inside the bread, I let the cream cheese warm up on the counter for a bit and mixed it with the sour cream and spread it in a shallow baking dish. I spread the salsa over the top and the cheese over that. I baked it for 30 minutes at 350*. My husband loved it! I should say so.....he ate the whole thing by himself! I think next time, I might add some homemade taco seasoning or chili seasoning in with the cream cheese/sour cream for extra flavor.

made the dip exactly as is but did not put in a bread bowl. i baked it until bubly and served with tortilla chips. This was nothing special, it was very tangy and quite thin. I would not make this again.

This was pretty good...I made it for a surprise birthday party and it was all gone before the birhday girl got there! Everyone loved it though...served best with Frito dips. I think it is so important to use fresh salsa (like pico de gallo)... othere reviewers said it turned out to be pink but this was not the case with pico de gallo...and it's so delicous! I also added onion, plenty of hot sauce, Adobe (really adds to it) and cumin. Turned out bowl-lickin' good *UPDATE - i get requested to make this for EVERY little party, get together, whatever. it is that addicting and good. just kick up the spices when making it and be creative

I made this for a themed Mexican dinner party as an appetizer and it was GONE! So yummy! Along with the reserved bread pieces, I also served it with lime tortilla chips. The guests blocked the door and wouldn't let me go home until I gave them the recipe! Luckily, I got out alive and managed to keep it a secret. Hee, hee...

This is a great recipe I just want to let everyone know you can cook this in the microwave if you are short on time and pour it into a bread bowl after or just omit the bread bowl like I did. Microwave for 3 minutes, stir well repeat microwaving for a few mins at a time until you've cooked for 9-12 minutes. It's delicious and takes a fraction of the time. From the time I read the recipe  until it was done was 15 minutes. It turned out fantastic too. I may try it in the bread bowl. I assume the length of cooking make the flavors a bit stronger? Either way its a great recipe, just wanted to let everyone else know it can be done in 15 mins start to finish.

My sister in law gave me a recipe very similar to this. It is a problem... I could eat every bit myself! Same ingredients, different measurements. Cooks in only 22 minutes 

2 Loaves french bread. 
2 8 oz cream cheese, softened
1 c. sour cream
1 c. salsa
4 c. cheddar cheese

Mix together all wet ingredients.  Cut off top of one of the loaves.  Scoop out insides and fill with wet ingredients.  Put on cookie sheet, uncovered, and bake for 10 minutes.  Cut up the other loaf (along with the inside and top of the loaf you filled) into bite size pieces and spread around the loaf with filling in it and put back in the oven for another 12 minutes or so.  Cooking the bread pieces the whole time would make them too crispy.

WOW! I mad this for Christmas Day this year 2010, & it was a hit. I did what another viewer suggested. I added 1 1/2 cups of sour cream, 1 1/2 packs of cream cheese. Everything else stayed the same. Plus I went to our local Mexican Restaurant & bought freshly made salsa. I'm telling you I will never go back to other cheese dips. Oh! I also use the Sargento Authentic Mexican Shredded cheeses, I use 1 1/2 bags if that cheese. So as that viewer said, I also doubled the recipe. It was just enough for a nice round of Italian bread or a Farm bread, or even a sourdough bread & baked it in aluminum foil & baked it for 2 hours, the last ½ hour I opened up the foil to let it get a little crispy. I also stirred it around half way during the baking. All I can say is YUM-MO, You won't be sorry :)

My husband thought this was amazing.  He is a cheese fanatic and just ate this up.  I just thought this was ok.  It didn't have the taste that I was expecting after reading all of the reviews.  I guess I had really high expectations.  I did think this was good.  Thank you for a recipe that I know I can make as a treat for my husband.

This was a hit with my Bible Study group!!  I was very happy with the way it turned out. It's delicious, easy to make and crowd pleasure!!
I stirred the mixture after taking it out of the oven and this evened out the temperature of the dip. Make sure to buy an extra loaf of sliced Italian bread to eat the dip with!!  It's gonna go FAST!! Thanks for sharing with us all!

I took this dip to a barbq and they ate every bite, even the bowl.  I used medium hot salsa and it had incredible flavor.  I'm sending this recipe to my entire family.  Thanks Julie

It was good.. but not great. I used an amazing cheddar garlicky bread bowl and then just a regular crusty breadbowl. No difference so I know it wasn't the bread. It just didn't do anything for us. Needed more flavor. I decided to actually follow a recipe the way it was written instead of putting my own tweek on it and I guess I should have tweeked it!

This is so good!  Just the presentation alone gives it five stars, but it's so smooth and delicious too!  The icing on the cake is that it's super easy to make, which is a huge bonus for me.  Thank you!

Really good - I did not cook the dip in the bread bowl (I ran out of time before people came over!)  So I put everything  into a saucepan and warmed it up in there before putting it into the bread bowl.  People were going CRAZY over it!  It was gone in minutes!

This is a delicious recipe that I make every year for Superbowl parties! I barely get to have any for myself because it goes so fast, definitely a hit. It is so fast and so easy to make. Now, I've learned to double the recipe and put the mixture into two bread bowls so have enough to go around!

I make a similar recipe served COLD with tortilla chips (Tostitos Scoops are a hit). Chill for at least 2 hours. This recipe is always a hit - people want to lick the bowl saying that it is "addictive".  I agree.  Recipe doubles easily, so I would suggest it because you will run out if using this for a party.

This was good.I got compliments and it was very easy. I bought 2 boules and cut the 2nd one up into neat chunks. I found that the ripped up pieces kinda fell apart in the dip. The color was not very appetizing though. It was a wierd pink. I changed the servings to twelve instead of the nine and that was great because I had the extra that didn't go into the boule in the oven in a small crock pot on the counter and refilled the boule when it was low. Next time I make it I will add some taco seasoning to see how that works. By the way I used On the Border medium salsa.

This recipe was pretty good.  I'm surprised that I didn't see any suggestions about adding chorizo sausage.  I browned some, then used some paper towels to drain the fat off (I use the paper towels like cheesecloth and squeeze the chorizo to get as much fat off as possible).  I served this in my crock pot instead of in a bread bowl and I'm glad I did because as this sat at room temperature it hardened and needed to be warmed back up.  Once we got the crock pot plugged back in though, it was fine.

Not quick, but definitely easy, and definitely good. I used Pico de Gallo style salsa, and juiced a 1/4 of lime. I also used 2 cups of cheddar instead of 1 & 1/2. I will use this for parties to come.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED this recipe!!!  Did need to kick up the heat a little so I added a few jiggers of Frank's Hot Sauce and it did the trick.  Love serving this with Tostito GOLD chips and shortcut the baking method by microwaving it for about 10 min.  Perfect mexican party favorite!!

Followed recipe, but baked in a small casserole dish, covered with foil.  Stirred it after 30 mins and it tasted pretty bland, so added 1 Tb chili powder and 1 1/2 tsp cumin.  Tasted pretty good and consistency creamy at this point.  Baked it another 30 minutes and consistency now like cheesecake.

I made this for our monthly game night and it was a big hit.  Not all of the dip fit in the bread bowl, so I put the rest in a small casserole dish and baked it for 45 minutes.  Would make this again.

My husband makes this dip for parties & is asked for the recipe all the time!  There's never anything leftover - even the bread bowl gets eaten!  We use sourdough bread instead & toast the bread pieces.  Low-fat substitutions don't change the flavor hardly at all.  One can vary the spice with mild, medium or hot salsas.  This is a staple in our repertoire.

Great recipe.  My dip had chunks of cream cheese in it when it was done because I didn't mix well enough.  Next time I will try using a beater to mix it.

I made this today using On the Border salsa and hawaiian bread. It was really bad.  I give it two stars though-- because it could be improved.  It's mild flavor would lead well into adding a package of chopped crabmeat or shrimp.  I would never put it back in the bread bowl. Waste of good bread, and it was better with tortilla chips.  I'd also add either some packaged taco seasoning or some cumin-chili powder.  I love Mexican food-- and Rotel dip.  This recipie sounded great, but was really a disappointment.

Very Good!  I added SCALLIONS and sliced BLACK OLIVES to all some color and give it alittle more zip! I also used GUACAMOLE DORITO'S, yummy!  The hot salsa makes it. Everyone loved this recipe.  I am making it again tonight!

I just love this recipe!  I've made it several times, and it always goes really, really fast.  The only thing I do differently is just because I can be lazy (lol):  I don't bother measuring the shredded cheese.  I use one package of preshredded cheese from the supermarket (I find the seasoned ones the best, like taco or some Mexican blend).  I like to serve this with not only the bread, but a hearty tortilla chip (like Tostito's Gold).  The other thing I wanted to mention is that I wouldn't recommend using a sourdough boule for this.  I tried it once, and it gave off a beer-like smell which I think in turn made the dip not taste as good.  Definitely a staple in my recipe file.  Thanks, Julie, for this yummy recipe!

Great dip, made a sourdough loaf to put it in and it was awesome. Only thing I'll be changing next time is I'll toast the bread separately and make the dip on the stove, baking it together made the bread too soggy.

I brought this for a pot luck, so I did not make it in a bread bowl, but served it with cut up French bread.  It was very good.

Made this for my work, and it was gone before I knew it.  They loved it.  I also used chipotle cream cheese, which made it a little more spicy.  I also used 6oz bread bowls; sourdough and french.  I guess I didn't follow the recipe to be exact, but it came out great! I used this salsa recipe for the dip: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/mango-salsa/detail.aspx

Have made this dip multiple times since I found it a few months ago and have gotten lots of compliments! The cooking time is a little high, so after a little after an hour it'll probably be done. AMAZING and addictive!

Great appetizer for our Christmas eve dinner!!!

We had three adults for dinner so we cut the recipe down to four servings which was still plenty!  We did not put the dip into a bread bowl but rather baked in a shallow baking dish for approximately 45 minutes (until it bubbled).  We served with a variety of crackers and breads.

I think my expectations may have been a little too high, because although this dip was good, I didn't like it nearly as much as other reviewers. Most of my coworkers who tried it were complimentary. Every single person who saw it had to know the ingredients.. it was pretty gross-looking..

This was a HUGE hit at the party I just hosted!  I have to make copies of it to give all the guests!  It was so easy to make, the hour and a half in the oven gave me time to prepare the rest of the food and then I just took it out and put it on a platter with the scooped out bread and tortilla chips.  Oh yeah, I added about 1/4 cup more salsa for more flavor.

I have made this recipe several time for different occasions. I like it b/c I can put it in while i am still doing last minute things b/4 guests arrive and it is always a crowd pleaser - I like to use the Tostidos Rest. Style salsa with A LOT of cheddar (or that Mexican Cheese blend you can buy at the store works really great too!) ENJOY

This is a great dip! I know lots of other reviewers said they liked it in the bread bowl, but I make it right in an oven safe dish and serve it with tortilla chips. Also, if you do it without the bread, it doesn't take nearly as long to heat up. Make sure you use a salsa you really like, if not you probably won't like the dip.

I made this to bring to a superbowl party and I left it at home because I thought it was awful. I am glad I made other recipes or I would have arrived empty handed. It looked like pink goo which would have been ok if it tasted good.

This was the best dip I have ever made!  I made it for a tiny "girls night" party and my girlfriends were dipping EVERYTHING in it! corn chips, potato chips, - you name it!  It was delish!!!!  The only thing I changed was to add 2 1/2 cups of cheese and I used a rye bread instead of Italian!  I will make this dip over and over again!!!

I eliminated the bread bowl as it was for a Mexican themed buffet, so served it with the lime chips as someone else had mentioned.  The only thing I would change would be for a little color, I would add some green onions for some color using the tops.  I also used the hot Pace Picante sauce as most the people we know like it hot.  It WAS all gone when we left.  A definite keeper!  Thanks, Julie!

This was awesome! I cooked half of the dip in a smaller loaf for a snack for my husband and me. We ate the entire thing. If I had made it all, we probably would have kept eating!

Excellent!!  So easy to make and yummy, too!  I've made this a few times now and everyone has loved it.  I use tortilla chips to dip instead of the bread pieces.  But when the chips and dip are gone we tear off pieces of the bread bowl and eat that too!  This is usually gone within 15 minutes!  Thanks for sharing!!

I've made this at home and have taken it to parties.  It always goes quickly!  One time I had to use a pumpernickel loaf because that was all the store had left and it was still great.  We like hot salsa and extra cheese!

Tasty, and easier than I thought it would be. I used two cups of cheese, though- half sharp cheddar and half mexican mix. And HOT salsa gave it a kick!
