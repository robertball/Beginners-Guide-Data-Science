This was okay, but I ended up doing so much additional adding I think it ends up being a new recipe.  I didn't have white wine vinegar so used red wine vinegar.  I followed the directions exactly and it was way too sour, so I added another tablespoon of sugar.  I think didn't think it had enough taste so I added a couple of cloves of garlic and some red pepper flakes for kick.  It ended up okay like I said, but was still just missing something.  Plus the basil taste was a little strong for me.

Very tasty! I'll make it again but with a touch less vinegar as it had a little too much for my taste.

This dressing was much too sour for my taste.  It was quick and easy to make though.

My wife and I really enjoy this dressing.  It has a lot of ingredients, but they all go together really well.

Delicious! I used regular white vinegar, olive oil, and mustard seed instead (because that's what I had). Will make again!

This was really easy to make and pretty tasty. Best to use real herbs if available.

Nice dressing, but for my tastes, I think olive oil instead of vegetable oil and some chopped garlic would have improved it.  It had just the right amount of vinegar/pungency for me.
