i was a bartender for about ten years and if youre looking for something with a little more kick try this..... fill your glass with ice and then add the kahlua and a shot of vodka. then fill with the soda. if you have a friend who needs a kick put two straws in it and race to the bottom... tennessee mind eraser is what they call it here. happy drinking.

I followed soupisgoodfood33's review and made my drink with ice first, then the Kahlua following with the soda water. Yes. That's kind of a "duh" moment for me but honestly, that's the way to go.

This has been my favorite drink for years. The only thing is you must add a big squeeze of lime.

I bartended for years, and this was my go-to drink for when I just wanted to sip with friends. It tastes like Coke with a kick.

Make this with coke for an even better flavor.  Taste like root beer with a kick.  My favorite drink for years.

So I had one and thought okay this is good, liked the coffee taste at the end. Then thought what the heck let me "down" another one, and just one more before guest get here.... the rest is history! THANK YOU for an evening I was told was a blast.

Loved it. I like to stir mine really well because I don't like the flavor of club soda by itself.

Yummy! I have loved Kahlua for years but never had it with club soda, this was really nice. Kahlua is so sweet, the club soda cuts through that a little so it's very pleasant to sip on. Thanks for sharing :)

A tasty treat at the end of a long day.  I've also gotten adventurous and tried other things with club soda, and would recommend Tuaca as well.

I love Kahlua.  Tried this -- I thought it was a good substitute for a cola drink but with a bit of kick.
