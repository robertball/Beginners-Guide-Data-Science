I substituted strawberry jello for lemon, raspberry jelly for apricot and added mandarin oranges.  I also doubled the recipe, but found 1 jar of jelly was still plenty.  It was delicious and a big hit at my Church potluck!

I made this today and it was a hit. It was easy to make and not a big clean up at all. I wanna try making it again with different flavors.Once I do it I will post flavors and how it came out.

My father loved this dessert so much that he asked if i wanted to start a dessert business on the side.  He told me it was the "best tasting thing he had ever put in his mouth"!!!!

looks like a recipe a friend's mom used to make only she used apricot baby food.  I am going to make this version for a school picnic tomorrow :-)
EDIT:Not sure what happened but it separated and was not creamy and fluffy :-( tasted good, but no one took any because it looked kind of gross

I really wanted to like this! :) The concept is wonderful, but it was so sickeningly sweet we couldn't finish it
