This is one of my favorite appetizers-sooo good and EASY. Great to make ahead and freeze. I prefer using unsalted butter and garlic powder
though as this recipe can be salty.

I didn't like this at all.  Way too salty and too greasy.  I served for guests at a dinner party and they were all very unimpressed.  I used on party rye.  Maybe better on thicker pieces of bread that can soak up all the grease.  Won't even try to modify this one.

I have made this recipe many times over the past 25 years, with 1 major change. If you add the jar of Kraft Old English Cheese Spread it makes a super delicious appetizer that can be prepared and frozen way in advance and kept on hand for unexpected guests.With this change, I'd give it 5 stars.

I didn't like this recipe at all.. way too salty, even though I only put in 1/2 the amount of seasoning salt. It sounded good but just didn't live up to the expectations!

I have not tried this yet but i have a suggestion to make. I have a recipe that calls for all the ingredients listed plus one small jar of kraft old english cheese spread! Add that and you will see a huge difference! My mom made this at holidays and now i am requested to bring it all the time!

This was the hit of my tea party! I did change the recipe a bit based on what other reviewers said: I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and I used half the seasoning salt. I will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe!  I added about 2 tablespoons of cream cheese to the mixture to make it taste more like the classic "crab rangoon"  then topped the english muffins with shredded mozarella cheese before baking.  Everyone loved and asked for the recipe! (Even the picky eaters that don't care for regular crab rangoons enjoyed this appetizer)

I tried this with tuna since I don't like crab.  I did note the butter/mayo mixture was quite salty (and I'm a salt-a-holic), but once the tuna was added, put on muffins and toasted, I didn't really notice.  Perhaps the stronger flavor of the tuna covered it up, so I'd suggest plain garlic powder.  But all in all they were pretty decent, though I thought only enough mixture for 4 (whole) muffins.  And easy to make.

I read other reviews so I made the changes I thought would help. First, I used fresh crab. Second, less salt by half added fresh sliced mushrooms. Made all the differnce!

When I made this I omitted the garlic salt and seasoned salt, substituting GARLIC POWDER and SALT-FREE SEASONING instead.  With those minor changes, we can all enjoy the toasts!  I'll be making this again!

This recipe was very good but next time I will use 1/4 tsp of garlic powder instead of the garlic salt and cut the seasoned salt in half. Our guests enjoyed it but agreed it was a bit too salty.

I used half the butter called for and twice the crab meat. Didn't have seasoning salt or garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and sea salt. We liked it, and we'll make it again.

I used imitation lobster in chunks and I should have cut it into smaller pieces. Didn't spread. I used wheat bread and turned it into a sandwich. Fairly good but I bet the original recipe is better. I'm careful about salt so I used unsalted butter and no seasoning salt. I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

SO tasty! The only problem was it was crazy salty. Next time I'll try it with regular garlic (not garlic salt) and see if that cuts back the saltiness enough. I put mine on sliced French bread, but you could put this on anything. Very good and so simple! Will be making again.

This was REALLY good, with a couple of minor tweaks.  I used the ingredients listed, but change the amounts.  I had about 8-10 ounces of meat from crab legs, so I used that.  Only used about a tablespoon of butter (3/8 cup seemed like WAY too much!), 2 tablespoons of "Mayo w/ Olive Oil", 1/4 tsp. garlic powder (NOT garlic salt), and 1/4 tsp. seasoned salt.  This was just enough for a mixture that was mostly crab, which is what I wanted.  I used multigrain sandwich rounds instead of muffins, sprinkled the top with just a pinch of plain bread crumbs, and broiled as indicated (about 7 minutes).  They were fantastic!  Definite make again.  Next time I'm going to use some sliced French bread sticks for the toast.

It was ok.  I had about 15 people over and it was the only appetizer that was not finished.  I most likely will not make it again.

I did not care for this too much. It was way to greasy and salty, even after I reduced the salt to half as per other suggestions. If i were to make it again, i would reduce the butter and mayo as well.

I made a few adjustments which made this recipe great.  I substituted garlic powder for the salt (will use only 1/4 t next time).  I also addes about 1/4 c or so of finely crushed bread crumbs to thicken up a bit.  My kids loved it.  I thought it was pretty good, too.
