I gave this recipe 4 stars - not because we didn't like the taste - it was very good; but because of the amount of liquid.  I used the advice of previous reviewers and cut back, but there was still too much watery liquid.  I dissolved one vegetable bouillion cube in about a half can of chicken broth.  To this I added about 3/4 cup of sherry.  I used a bag of frozen pearl onions along with fresh mushrooms, fresh rosemary, black pepper and salt.  I parboiled some red potatoes and added them to the crockpot about an hour before serving (I didn't want them to be mushy).  We really liked the way this tasted and I will cook this again.  Like so many crockpot recipes, its presentation was lacking - not the flavor.

Crock Pot isn't Necessary

This was a good recipe.  It was easy to prepare: chop and wash vegetables, add liquid ingredients (I used a can of vegetable broth and a can of chicken broth and the cup of sherry), I added the  seasonings and mix everything together in a roaster.  I then put my pork shoulder roast on top of everything.  Good for letting kids help, i.e., adding the vegetables, liquid and seasonings.

Because my roaster was fairly large I added carrots, and more mushrooms and potatoes.  I adjusted the seasoning (to my taste) to compensate for the extra veggies.

I braised this at 275 degrees for over 6 hours and it was excellent -- hearty, tasty and beautifully tender.  Vegetables were tasty.

This was awesome! I used Pork loin instead and replaced the pearl onions with a sliced yellow onion. Potatoes wouldn't even come close to fitting in my smaller sized crock pot so I served the pork and very tasty gravey over mashed potatoes. This is the best pork slow cooker recipe I have ever tried - will serve again and again.

This was the most tender pork I have ever had in a crockpot -  very good.  I didn't use sherry, used 1 can (2 cups)fat free chicken broth instead of the quart of veg broth, added 2 cloves garlic chopped, and sprinkled 1/2 package of dry onion soup mix on it.  Next time I'll add a thickener to make a real gravy and cut back the liquid to 1 cup total.

This recipe was great (after a few changes)!  I followed previous suggestions and cut down the liquid significantly.  I used ¾ c vegetable broth and ¼ c sherry and had TONS of liquid.  Threw in a few carrots and served over mashed potatoes.  My husband called this melt-in-your-mouth-pork. Delicious!

This was very good.  I didn't have a problem with too much liquid.  I used one can of chicken broth and 1 cup of sherry.  After the dish was done, I poured the cooking liquid into a sauce pan and thickened it with cornstarch mixed with sherry.  I added carrots and garlic.  I really dislike the flavor and aroma of rosemary, and one whole tablespoon of dried rosemary seemed like an awful lot.  I picked up a package of fresh "pasta" herbs which included fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme and oregano.  I used several springs of thyme and oregano, and only one of rosemary.  That was plenty to flavor the pork with just the slighest hint of rosemary without overpowering the dish. I would have rated this higher if it weren't for the overuse of dried rosemary.  Otherwise, this was quite good, and my husband and I enjoyed it.

Wanted to add that I've made this with pork shoulder ribs as well - but both those and the roast should be boneless (at least that's what I prefer).  Whatever cut of pork you chose, make sure they aren't TOO lean (very lean meats will come out tough when slow-cooked).

We often add a lot more mushrooms just because we like them so much.  If I don't have pearl onions, I use frozen chopped white onions, it's all good.  My husband is always requesting this.  

As a previous poster mentioned, there is a good amount of extra liquid/gravy (we like it that way).  But keep that in mind - if you don't want much, drop the amount of broth and sherry by half.  Or you can thicken it to make more of a stew.  Whatever you feel like, ya know? :)

My boyfriend still talks about this meal, two months after I made it last.  He actually brags about it to his friends...lol.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, however I did add some carrots because I had them on hand.
It was very tastey, and so tender that when we went to remove it from the slow cooker, we cut it in half with a nylon serving spoon (likely because it had been slow-cooking for the whole day).  
Thanks so much, it was a definite hit!

Very tender, fall apart pork.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth, and just a splash of sherry.  It was still really liquid-y, so I thickened it to make a gravy.  The meat was so tender it literally fell apart, so I shredded it.  I served it over egg noodles, which I think was a mistake.  If I make it again, I'll probably skip thickening the sauce, and then serve it with rice instead of egg noodles.  Thanks!

Excellent and easy pork roast.  Like others, I used frozen pearl onions, halved the broth, added baby carrots, and cooked the potatoes separately b/c there wasn't enough room in the pot.

This was so tasty!  Next time I'll take the bones out of the meat before I cook it.  I'll also stick with what I did this time: using only 1/2 the can of vegetable broth.  I didn't put in mushrooms, but instead used carrots & potatoes (Idaho, not peeled).  I layered meat, liquids, seasonings, onions, potatoes, then carrots.  Just tossed it all in, didn't mix, and let it cook all day while I was a work.  By the time I got home, the potatoes were nice and soft but not mushy, the carrots were the same.  The meat was very tender.  It's like a cozy stew!  I'll definitely make it again.

This was very good. The pork was really tender, as were all the veggies I put in (carrots, mushrooms, potatoes). Good flavor and it smelled delicious while cooking all day.

Turns out the frozen hunk of meat marked "Pork Shoulder" that I pulled out of the freezer was actually 2 thick pork steaks. I had my mind set on this recipe, so I used them. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and cut the sherry down to 1/2 cup. Added all the veggies but the mushrooms at the beginning, put the mushrooms in for the last hour of cooking. After 6 hours on low, I took the steaks out, shredded them (didn't take much more than poking at them), and returned them to the pot. I cooked it on low for another hour, then thickened with about 1/2 cup of instant potato flakes. Served it as a pork stew with french bread for dipping. I thought it was pretty good, but my fiancee was raving about it! 4 stars because I added thyme, a bay leaf, and a clove of garlic to make it more flavorful. Thanks :)

The flavor was good but I agree with some other reviewers that the liquid was too much, and I only used half.  I will try this again.

The pork is tender.  But bland flavor and artistic presentation is awful.  Grayish brown food.  Will never fix this again.

I was nervous about making this, due to the mixed reviews, but it was FANTASTIC!  We followed the recipe exactly and dipped the pork in BBQ as we were eating it and it was tender, just fell right apart and tasted wonderful!  I would recommend cutting down the liquid and using diced onion instead of pearls.  We'll probably forgo the mushrooms and use carrots next time, too.  I also used a center cut pork loin as my cut of meat.  Those who say this is bland and dry must've done something wrong - it will become a regular recipe for our family!!

This is an easy worry free way to get a scrumptious home cooked meal to the dinner table.  Great for a lazy Sunday.  Do take heed that this recipe calls for too much liquid.  If you reduce it as the others suggested you will be just fine.  Also after the 1st 5 hours I chose to add 3 Tbsp blended with cold water until smooth.  Crockpot cooking will not reduce liquids, therefore this will thicken it up a bit.  Also, I took a picture because I remember someone saying it lacked presentation.  Presentation is up to the indivdual.  There are many different Crockpots that not only cook, they also look great serving.

I like crock pot recipes and this one is a keeper.  I followed other reviewers suggestions on reducing the liquid.  I used 2 cups veggie broth and 3/4 cup sherry and had PLENTY of liquid after it got done cooking.  I will probably just use one cup of each next time.  I roughly chopped a white onion in big chunks instead of pearl onions and also added some carrots chopped the same way.  One last thing, I should have left the mushrooms whole like in the pic.  Didn't realize how much they would shrink :-)  Overall a great recipe.  Thanks Lori, for posting it!

This recipe is great!  Just made it tonight and had to come back on to rate it.  Instead of pearl onions (I don't like them) I sliced a sweet onion, and I also added carrots.  My huband said this one is keeper!  The only thing I might change is use a little less broth and maybe add some thyme.  But it was great as is!

This was really good. i seasoned the roast first with salt, pepper, garlic powder and some italian herbs, then browned it on all sides. I also reduced the liquid a bit- 1 cup sherry, 1 cup chicken stock...it was plenty of liquid. also, I served this over egg noodles that I cooked in stock and some of the liquid from the crock pot...my hubby loved it! He even went back for seconds...will definatley make again!

We liked this recipe - I did it in a LeCruset pan in the oven at 275* for about 7 hours. I only used 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup wine and it was dry. I'd add a bit more liquid next time. Oh yeah, I think my meat was beef too. No problem! I served it with brown gravy and buttered noodles. We didn't eat many of the roasting veggies (pots, carrots, regular onions). I would make it again - husband gave it thumbs up (his tail was wagging for the good dinner)!

Maybe it was me, but I followed the recipe exactly, and we did not like this at all. Won't be making this again. Sorry :(

I used a 3.5 lb. pork roast, which ended up being to big for my crockpot! After I had dumped all of the ingredients in I had to cut part of the roast off.  I think I ended up using too much cooking sherry in the end, but all in all the roast came out tender and pulled apart nicely.  I'm not sure I liked the mushrooms cooked all day in the crock pot, they come out over cooked...?? With the vegetable broth, sherry, etc.  it seems like it's too watery or something you have to drain the potatoes well otherwise you end up with a lot of watery "gravy" on your plate.  Tasty recipe, however not sure I'd cook it again this way.

I changed this recipe to use what I had around the house. I don't remember what cut of roast I used, but it was just under two pounds. I used 1.5 cups of water with 2 cubes of chicken bouillon in it. I omitted the sherry and potatoes (we ran out of spuds a couple days ago!), used 1/2 an onion (diced), a can of sliced mushrooms, 2 carrots (chopped into big pieces), 2 stalks of celery (diced), and then I added a little thyme and Italian seasoning. After maybe four hours, I added half a package of brown gravy mix, and then half an hour before I served it I added some cornstarch slurry to make it thicker and almost gravy-like to serve over pasta. To me, it NEEDED salt! I salted it a little in the pot, and that helped a lot. It was pretty good, and reheated fine. Thanks, Lori, for a great base recipe!

Since my boss and I are on low carb diets, I omitted the potatoes.  I also didn't have sherry or vegetable broth.  I used sliced yellow onion instead of pearl onions, chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (and not so much, maybe 1 to 1-1/2 cups).  After slow cooking overnight, I used a package of mushroom gravy mix to thicken up the liquid.  I made this for my boss and she said it was "out-of-this-world good" and that she and her family licked their plates!

Nice Slow-Cooked Pork Haiku: "Tender, easy, good. (I used pork loin, and not roast. I'll make this again!" I had a massive hunk of pork loin that I'd split in half to freeze, so I used part of it for this meal. I also only had about a cup's worth of pearl onions, so I supplemented chopped Vidalia for the other half. Otherwise, the rest of the recipe went as written for me, and the pork was fall-apart-tender in about 6 hrs. on low. I'm surprised that the rosemary taste didn't come thru at all, so when I make this again, I'll definitely increase the rosemary, as well as add some minced garlic, and possibly some carrots, just for some additional veggies to sit and soak up the nummy juice.

This recipe was very good.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used only 3/4C chicken broth and 1/4C sherry, and I did not have too much liquid. I also used a regular onion, chopped, and omitted the mushrooms.

I put in all the ingredients plus two cans of sliced new potatoes and 2 cans of sliced carrots. We then went for an 8 hour ride. The house smelled great when we returned and the result was fabulous. This recipe has been added to my recipe box and will be used again.
Thank you Lori.

Good, I have made it several times. The sherry was a bit to overpowering for my family's taste, I used chicken broth instead and then used the leftovers for pulled pork BBQ the nest day.

First I would like to say the pork was excellent!  Super tender.  But I think the recipe called for too much liquid.  Lori did note that you could cut back.  I think I would use half next time so that at the end you could make more of a gravy rather than having it like a soup.  Then it would be more like a pot roast.  Yummy!  It would be great with mashed potatoes.  I'm not much for the pearl onions.  My husband called them "onion balls".  Sliced or chopped onions would work. I have never made a pork shoulder roast and this was great.  Thanks for another great pork recipe.

I wanted to use up a pork shoulder roast I had in my freezer so I went on Allrecipes to find something good.   This roast did not disappoint.  I used a bag of small purple and white potatoes, a bag of frozen pearl onions, a box of fresh mushrooms and 2 cups chicken broth as I didn't have sherry.  I threw it together in 10 minutes and put on medium.  It was done in less than 6 hours.  Delicious.

This was very good and the pork was incredibly tender. I read through some of the reviews and made some changes.  I used 1 can of chicken broth and 1 cup of sherry.  I did use the pearl onions, but substituted baby carrots for the mushrooms.  I also added two cloves of garlic and some fresh rosemary in addition to the dry. In the future I would cut back just a bit on the liquids.

Great recipe!  We browned the pork roast on the stovetop and placed it on top of the liquid/vegetable mixture.  We also added carrots, and used about 1/4 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of red wine instead of sherry and still had lots of liquid.  My husband said it is his new favorite pork roast!

This recipe was okay. The pork was greasier than I expected. The potatoes and boiler onions came out very yummy and savory. I made bbq pork melted sandwiches with the leftover pork: definitely recommended: saute some onions & a good bbq sauce: pile onto hearty bread & melt stovetop for a superyummy sandwich. The recipe calls for too much liquid in my opinion, yet it was very moist and flavorful. Eye appeal? Not so much. Savory & hot & melty? Definitely. All around? Pretty Good.

Very tender, I enjoyed it.  I used sliced onions, about half the sherry, and a little less broth than called for.  It still had a lot of liquid, but I'll keep that in mind for next time.

A very tasty and easily prepared recipe that I have made a few times.  Here are my changes: added tons of garlic, used chopped onions instead of pearl, added carrots and sun-dried tomatoes for color, and used slightly less liquid than called for.  Also, omitted mushrooms (I don't care for them) and most recently left out the potatoes since I didn't realize that I had none.  It was delicious, and is versatile for different serving options: I have served with egg noodles, barley, rice, pasta, or crusty bread for soaking up the liquid.

Made this sans the potatoes (not enough room) and substituted a tsp or so of Mortons herb spices instead of rosemary. Cannot rave enough about how tender it was and the taste was super. Pork roast never tasted so good.

Very easy to make and the aroma was great - giving it a 4 stars because the meat was a bit dry and the flavor wasn't very strong.  Had my in-laws for dinner and they were very happy with this, as was my husband ... added carrots and used regular onion as opposed to the pearl onions.  I would make this again and add in some italian spice.

This was absolutely delicious! I couldn't fit the potatoes in the slow cooker, so I boiled/mashed them separately and used the sauce as gravy over both the potatoes and the pork.  I did thicken it with some cornstarch.  I used frozen pearl onions which worked out just fine. The key ingredient is the sherry. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was really good.  My family enjoyed it.  I used chicken broth which gave it more flavor and I had to add quite a bit of garlic salt.  I did not use the sherry (I didn't have any) and it was still good.  I did think, however, the dish turned out to be more like a soup.

We loved this recipe, even though I didn't have room in the crockpot for the potatoes. It turned out with more liquid than expected, probably because I left out the potatoes. We poured the leftovers over noodles and ate it as soup. Will try it next time with the potatoes, or add barley for a heartier soup. Yummy!

I'm not a big roast fan, but my husband is, so I made this, knowing that it was right up his alley. Well, he absolutely RAVED about it. The pork was melt in your mouth, the potatoes were cooked perfectly tender, and the mushrooms and pearl onions were nice complements. 

Next time, I might even go a bit overboard and take some of the juices and make a bit of gravy to go with the pork for a very traditional Sunday dinner. Add some rolls and presto~ the perfect meal.

Thanks!

This is the best pork roast I've ever had.  Moist and flavorful.  I think that next time I might add less broth and sherry and more vegetables like carrots and green beans because the vegies were so good!  Thanks for the great recipe, and my family thanks you, too.

Best pork ever.  If too much liquid just pull pork out of crockpot and place on nice serving platter and don't use broth. It is fantastic!!

This is an amazing recipe!!  I was told by my partner, "this is a keeper!!!"  I read the reviews and used chicken broth, carrots, thyme and bay leaf.  I wish I had made more carrots.  I will make this again, and again.  Thank you to the chef for sharing!!!!

While some people criticized this recipe for being too watery, there is an easy fix for this: Make a gravy! Ladle the excess liquid into a saucepan. Thicken with cornstarch or flour until it reaches a creamy consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste. I even sliced up a few mushrooms from the crock and threw em in there. It is hands down the most delicious gravy I have ever tasted! You can pour desired amount onto the dish when it's done. It makes a huge batch so save it to pour over mashed potatoes another night.

I seared the roast over high heat in my iron pan. I agree with other reviewers and cut the broth to 2 cups with a little less than a cup of wine.  That still gave me quite a lot of liquid, but I like the meat to be almost completely covered while it's slow cooking.  Since I reduced the liquid, I also cut the rosemary to a half tablespoon ... I think I'd cut it to a teaspoon next time because it's flavor is so strong.
The resulting pork is very close to a pulled pork.  I would make this again ... possibly adding green beans and carrots.

This was fabulous. I did follow some of the other reviewer's suggestions and made the following changes: Halved the veg broth, 3/4ths cup of sherry, doubled the rosemary, added some thyme, and a clove of garlic. Next time will add way more salt but other wise it was AMAZING.

I decided to rub the salt, pepper & rosemary into the roast and brown it in olive oil, before adding to crockpot. I never measure 'chopped' potatoes, just cut up 4 med and 2 sweet potatoes. Didn't have pearl onions so chunked 3 med onions, and after reading how much liquid everyone's having left in it, I used a TOTAL of 3 cups between beef broth,rose wine & sherry (only had 3/4 cups sherry-rest was beef broth-1 can and wine to bring up to 3 cups). Also added 3" chunk off stalk of celery, cut to 1 1/2" sections and a few carrots,chunked up. Roast tasted good, but it 'shredded' when I tried to cut it. Would make GREAT shredded pork, but I may have to use a different cut of pork or let it sit a while before cutting-I think I used a boneless pork loin.

This was just great! I didn't have any onions, so used dried minced onion. Didn't have any rosemary so I used Italian seasoning. Also, cooked it in the pressure cooker. Just wonderful.

I thought it was really good and had a lot of flavor. I used a tenderloin and only cooked it on low for 6hrs. I did use less liquid, 3/4 c wine, 1.5cup chicken broth.  And matched it with multigrain rice and put some cranberries in it. Yum! Thx.

Excellent and easy crock pot roast recipe. Using other suggestions, I cut down on the liquid - 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of sherry. Once te roast was finished, I strained the liquid out and thickened it on the stove with cornstarch.  This made a flavorful gravy that I served over boiled golden potatoes topped with the pork and veggies. I also added carrots and used four fresh sprigs of rosemary.  This recipe is a keeper!

Good, I didn't taste much of a difference of doing it this way verses just putting a plain roast in the crock pot with the vegetables.  A pork roast puts out enough liquid on its own.  There was obviously more liquid, but not enough of a difference in taste of the meat.  Ill probably do without the broth next time, maybe just do the sherry, see if that helps.

Not bad, but we didn't really care for the sherry... I'd cut it in half. Also, I used about half the liquid called for, and still ended up with too much.  I made gravy with it, but doubt we'll be able to use all of it.

How big do they make crock pot's?  I couldnt fit any spud's in mine either.  I thought that the extra sauce/gravy could use some thickining.  I used some corn starch added to the gravy and tossed it on some smashed potatoes.  The flavor in the pork was faint.  With only BBQ  and this one in the arcives for shoulder I'm not sure if I'll use this one again.  Lot's of extra sauce...

Wonderful, flavorful, and easy!  This cut of meat is a bit too fatty for my taste (but my husband and I are both pretty picky about fat)  I will definately make this again, but will try a slightly leaner cut next time.  All my guests raved over this super simple dish.

This is great.  I used pork shoulder, bone-in, and fresh rosemary. Serve with mashed potatoes (or sweet potatoes)  rather than cooking in the crock, my potaotes got mushy.

this recipe is great! i usually oven roast pork shoulders and loins, and was looking for something a little different.  the rosemary adds a GREAT flavour, as does the sherry.  i noticed that many people commented regarding too much liquid - i actually added 2 cups more (vegetable and chicken bouillion), and am using the very tasty cooked mushrooms/onions/potatoes/broth mix as a base for soup, after lifting out the pork shoulder roast. i'll add carrots, celery, kale, chopped fresh spinach and maybe stewing beef for the soup. the tender pork will be served on a bed of spiced basmati rice, with sides of steamed broccoli and cauliflower, el dente.  yum!

Followed the recipe but tripled the roast to a 9 lb Boston butt. Decreased the liquid by just using 2 cups of sherry.  It smelled wonderful all day and tasted even better!

Delicious.  I used red wine in stead of sherry.

Followed the recipe but, per the reviews, I cut down the liquid a bit and still had too much liquid.  Pork (and sauce) was unbelievably tender and tasty.  Will make again.

This has a wonderful flavor but I only used 24 oz. broth and the cup of Sherry and still had plenty of liquid to make gravy the first and second days. I served it with mashed potatoes the second day as the potatoes were mostly eaten up. Yum!

I didn't have vegetable broth so I used a can of cream of celery soup and substituted white wine for sherry. I sliced onion and layered it with potatoe sliced on bottom. There still was enough liquid even though I used only a third of what recipe called for. It was very good and I probably make it the same way again.

I used pork tenderloin and put spices directly on the pork- garlic salt, pepper, oregano, thyme and rosemary.  I put some onions  over the pork, then layered carrots and cut red potatoes followed by the rest of the onions.  Finally I added the liquid.  Because I had chicken stock on hand, I used that.  The mushrooms went in the crock pot about an hour and a half before finished.  My husband and I enjoyed it and have lots of leftovers.

This is fairly easy and I love the flavors. Easily serves 5 plus leftovers. Chris likes the extra juice as stock.

Very good! Nice variety for way to make pork. It did have quite a bit of liquid, but I didn't mind that.  Just might use 2 less cups of stock next time like others suggested. :)

I've made this twice now and each time it s wonderful. I did cut back the liquid and there's still a lot of it but I don't mind it keeps the pork juicy. I added basil along with the Rosemary for some added flavor and yumm! I'll keep making this every time

Listened to all the other posters and reduced the liquid by a lot.  I seared the roast first.  Then I only added 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup cream of chicken soup (both I had in the freezer left over from something else) plus 3/4 cups sherry.  Also just used what I had in the house - frozen onion/pepper mix, yellow onion, and no mushrooms.  Cooked it all day on low (240 degrees) Hubby loved it.  It's also great as leftovers.

This tasted pretty good, but the pork ended up being a strange mixture of flaky and dried out, which I didn't like, so I think I'll marinate it in the veggie broth next time. We don't have sherry just lying around so I used cranberry juice with a splash of apple cider vinegar instead. I added carrots and used sliced onions instead of pearls. There was a lot of liquid but we just used that as a sort of gravy for the dry meat and dipped crusty buttered bread in it. I would make this again.

I have made this recipe twice for company and everyone loved it! I did substitute cherry cola for the sherry, still came out great. I plan on making it again for Sunday supper!

Took the advice of other reviews and used 1 can vegetable broth,  substituted white wine for the sherry.  Cut up ½ onion, rosemary, salt & pepper.  My roast was frozen so I cooked it on high for 4 hours until it was 160 degrees. That was it and it was perfect.
