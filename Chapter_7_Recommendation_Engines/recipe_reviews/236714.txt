This isn't a fancy lasagna, but with some changes it could be incredible. This is a basic beginner lasagna for those who want to graduate beyond bottled sauce. I made fresh lasagna sheets, and aside from this basic change followed the recipe. I think what might help this recipe would be a blend of beef and Italian sausage. Next, because water gives no depth to the sauce a nice Cabernet Sauvignon would be a great replacement. Instead of seasoning the beef,  season the tomato sauce mixture...prepared the day before would let the flavoring meld. Then pour it into the cooked beef mixture. These small changes would likely take it from ordinary to marvelous!

This lasagna did not knock my socks off. Probably won't be making it again.

I have made this twice now.  Both times I substituted 1lb spicy pork sausage in place of 1lb ground beef.  The spicy sausage helps provide the kick that is missing from the sauce.

This is a really good recipe. The sauce is mild, which is awesome. I followed the recipe and was very pleased. Will make again as it was a hit with others. I did add parm. cheese, because I'm addicted to it.
