Sometimes I substitute the Raw Beef for Cooked Chicken.


For this I use 1 whole Chicken Leg Quarter (Boiled for an hour & cooled for 20 minutes) for all Dogs Under 70 lbs. and 2 whole Chicken Leg Quarters (Boiled for an hour and cooled for 20 minutes) for all Dogs over 70 lbs.


I include everything but the bone, yes the skin and gristle too! I then use the boiled water to mix the dry ingredients as the broth is also good for them!
