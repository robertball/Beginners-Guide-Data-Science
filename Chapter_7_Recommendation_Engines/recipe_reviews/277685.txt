Graham crackers are not Keto. Peanut butter needs to be sugar free  for Keto. Butter used should be grass fed style such as Kerry gold. Good recipe though

It is a great tasting snack to help with the sweet craving without feeling guilty having so much sugar. I have a bar with my lunch daily at work. It actually helps with the appetite so I don't overeat.
