Very tasty! I have made this 2x. The first time I used cornflakes and the second time I used a combination of Honey Bunches of Oats and Rice Krispies. Both were very good. Kids loved them!

This recipe was very easy and very yummy!!! I actually cut all ingredients in half but still spread in 9 X 13 pan because I wanted thinner bars to use for fondue dipping. They were the perfect thickness even just for snacking so would make it this way again. I used a few different kinds of cereal on hand (Cheerios Golden Grahams and Rice Crispies.) I lined bottom of pan with was paper sprayed some pam around edges came out with ease! Yum! Thanks for an easy recipe that utilized ingredients I had on hand!

I read the reviews about this recipe and got very excited about bringing this dessert to my dinner party. However I did not care for this recipe. The hosts of the party actually laughed at the dessert. My pride was extremely hurt. I will not be cooking this again.

Tasty. Made them two times the second I substituted honey nut cheerios on a whim-- preferred that. (But that's just me.:)) Didn't set as well as the no-bake with corn oil recipes I've done.

Really rich! My husband ate these up! Didn't even wait until they were cooled. I was sweet-tooth satisfied after just one piece which is great for people who love to late-night snack. Might be too sweet for some but if you love peanut butter and melted sugar you'll enjoy. I made with rice crispies and it set nicely and came out of the glass pan nicely. I'll see if it lasts for more than one night!

These turned out great. Didn't have quite enough corn flakes so I used 2/3 corn flakes and 1/3 rice krispies. We had some warm (couldn't wait) and cooled and they were a great texture. not too sticky or crumbly. yum. a

Excellent recipe! I decided "who wants the peanut butter without the chocolate?" so I added a layer of melted chocolate chips on top and stuck it in the fridge. I snuck a bit for myself and my boyfriend and it is super delicious! I can't wait for it to cool and I can enjoy another piece:)

This was Great to make in a pinch. I melted some chocolate to layer on top It really added to it. I did not have enough honey to make a full cup but it was still too much. It also got hard really fast and was difficult to cut into so I just broke it apart with my hands. Even with the problems people seemed to LOVE them!!

I was looking for a quick snack/dessert to take to a family gathering and this was great! It's a one pot-and-pour-in-the-pan dish that's quick and easy. My two brothers and a sister-in-law remember getting these at the grade school we went to!

I was craving something sweet and nutty one night and made this recipe. It took not time at all to do and has very basic ingredients. A great fix for my late night snack-attack!

We loved them! We love peanut Butter so for us these are great treats. I had to take them to work so my wife would not eat them all.

Really good! I used various leftover flake-type cereals (Chocolate Honey Bunches of Oats Total etc...) and the combination was tasty AND a great way to use up what's left in the bottom of those cereal boxes!

YUMMY! I did crunch up the corn flakes a bit and add a bit more honey. I liked this one a lot. Who cares if anyone else in the house does!

Since I love all the ingredients in this recipe this was a no-brainer for me to try! I made only a fourth of a batch just in case but I know I'll have to make more for sweet treats for the little ones in my life (and me too)! I had no problem removing these from a glass baking dish that I used. I ran out of creamy peanut butter and so there's a mixture of crunchy and creamy in my photo but I don't think it matters which you use. I also pressed the pieces together upon removing to make them stick together better. You'll notice that many reviewers used different cereals and I can't think of a sweeter way to use up the last of any box of cereal! Thanks Cathie!

I cooked the sugar and corn syrup together until it boiled, then melted the peanut butter in the pan off heat. I remembered that from my childhood recipe. Be sure to have your cereal all measures out because the mixture starts to harden as soon as you try mixing it with the cereal. Cleanup is my favorite as you have both the pan with the syrup and the bowl with the cereal mixture to lick!
