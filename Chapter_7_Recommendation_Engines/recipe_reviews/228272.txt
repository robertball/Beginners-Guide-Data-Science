Great recipe for a classic burger that just happens to be shaped like a hot dog! I couldn't figure out what to make for dinner tonight (didn't thaw anything) so we went out and got a pound of hamburger and fired up the grill. I used hoagie style rolls as I wasn't able to find extra-long hot dog buns. These were great and really hit the spot. We poured a little beer over these while they were cooking (an old trick from my Dad) added some pickles and a side of kettle cooked chips as well as  a couple of beers which were a lot easier to drink with the "free hand" - Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!

These were fun and delicious! I started out making 8oz. dogs, but they were waaaaay too big for us, so I made 6oz. dogs and that was perfect. Also, I couldn't find extra-long hot dog buns, only regular and foot-long, so I bought brat/sausage buns and they worked out great. Essentially, these are just burger shaped dogs, lol, but they were yummy and I would def make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

What is not to like? A true burger shaped to fit a hot dog bun.  I used a hoagie bun - which is a bit bigger - keep in mind these are 1/2 lb burgers - easier to eat?  Maybe! Hubby liked them and that is what counts.

These are great, Another great alternative is to make a slit along the length of the burger and stuff lightly with chunky bleu cheese and press shut. Use Swiss cheese in place of cheddar and grill as stated above.  These will melt in your mouth. I used a few slices of sauteed mushrooms that i cooked in butter and used as a extra topping.........yum yum!!!   Thanks Chef!!!

Chef John's shares history for the burger dog. HISTORY OF BURGER: This “burger dog” is far more than a hot dog shaped cheeseburger. It’s a testament to American ingenuity and being close to the right place at the right time. While I’m posting this as a fun, 4th of July grilling idea, my real motivation is to tell this “only in America” story of food stand stardom.  As the story goes, Bill “Burger Bill” Parrish didn’t want to buy two different kinds of buns for his tiny snack stand, which he operated on Lake Merced, near the Olympic Club in San Francisco. Since there’s no such thing as flat, round hot dogs, Bill decided to shape his burgers to fit the hot dog bun, and The City’s most storied cheeseburger was born. The course is only open to members, so the only way to taste one of these rare beauties is if you’re invited to play as a guest. I’ve had the pleasure twice, and both times the burger experience was just as memorable as the golf. They really are brilliant. Above and beyond fitting the uni-bun, Burger Bill’s rectangular meat ended up being culinary superior for all the reasons I brag about in the video. The shape insures a great crust of grill marks, and a perfect meat-to-bun ratio as you eat your way down the length.

I did this for the first time over 40 years ago as a 13 year old. Grandma had purchased hot dog buns by mistake so I suggested "hamdogs". It worked and everyone was pleased, I helped save Grandma's cookout and no one was the wiser!

Just a hamburger in the shape of a hot dog. Use bigger buns than the regular hot dog buns. Hard to put any of the fixings on, but a decent solution if you don't have hamburger buns.

This is a good recipe and lets the flavor of the burger out.  I agree completely with Chef John. The secret is the hot dog bun creates less bun vs. meat. I am not sure why there are so many negative comments on here for this.  Yes its a hamburger on a hot dog bun but unless you actually try it with minimal fixings,  you miss it. The other point is yes cook until well done.

I have been making these for years.  I had leftover hot dog buns, so this was how I used them up.  I gave the burgers a flat shape and could fit the goodies on top without dropping everything.  I also flattened the bun a little.

At first the wife was a bit taken back by the shape but once she bit into one she loved it. And the recipe can be added to very easily for personal tastes.

This was a fun way to grill some burgers. Quite decent. We did put some mustard in the mayonnaise along with the ketchup.
