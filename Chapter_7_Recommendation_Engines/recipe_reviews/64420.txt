I made this without the oranges and pineapples and used low fat peach yogurt and it was really good. I wasn't too crazy about the marshmallows though and picked most of them out. I loved the toasted coconut, it tasted great and made it look really good.

I made this ambrosia as part of my Easter Dinner.  I used pastel colored marshmallows to make it more festive.  It looked great and everyone loved it.  My only complaint would be that it doesn't keep well to eat as left-overs.
