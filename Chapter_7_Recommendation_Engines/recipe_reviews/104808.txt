It is easy to make :)  sometimes I have difficulty with Indian cookery as I'm a spin and toss cook and so getting careful with measurements (since I am not sure what I am doing) makes it complicated for me.  with this one I decided to pay attention to the recipe, no additions or omitions, but I did add more cashews (love 'em) and a few less curry leaves (had to go to a specialty shop for those) and a couple less peppers as I am not fond of TOO much heat.  the result was sour and tangy as you said, which I am glad you did otherwise I wouldn't have been able to describe the tast combination.  and I always love cooking cumin seeds the way they pop around the pan.  thanks so much!  hope to see more of your recipes.

I make a version of this called Pulihora which is great for leftover rice. I mix the turmeric, salt, oil and curry leaves with the rice and let it stand for 15 minutes. Then I fry ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, urad dal, red chilies, sugar and tamarind and then add this to the rice. I wait for at least an hour before eating and it's superb.

Overall, this was good, and I'll probably make it again but w/o curry leaves (or maybe just one).  This was my first time cooking with curry leaves, and, boy, are they powerful and very unusual tasting. I can't quite pinpoint it, but the taste/smell sort of reminds me of car exhaust or something toxic. On the other hand, I enjoyed the tamarind paste and used the full amount.

Taste is pretty good. The tamarind paste turned it a gross brown color, nothing like the picture.  I'm really new to cooking Indian food and am still learning all the different spices. It has a very clean taste. Quick and sharp sourish taste that cleans your pallet. Nothing lingers. Overall pretty good but will try to tweak one day.

A quick tip, if you don't have curry leaf, just skip it.. don't use anything else as it will change the flavor

I am a beginner cook (aka I follow recipes to a "T"), and the non-typical ingredients in this dish gave me a challenge.  Whole Foods didn't have curry leaves, so I tried using kaffir lime leaves (dried).  I also had ground mustard seed and ground cumin, as well as cayenne pepper instead of chilies.  All this in mind, I'm sure the dish didn't turn out as well as if I had been able to use the right ingredients, but it turned out well-enough.  Next time, I'd try to make it the right way.... :-D
