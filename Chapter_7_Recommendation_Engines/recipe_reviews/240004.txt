My kids LOVED this!! I used sweet Baby Ray's hickory and brown sugar BBQ sauce. This makes a TON. In fact, I have enough for their lunches for tomorrow. It was super easy to make. I didn't deviate from the recipe. I felt like there was a bit too much corn though- but that is easy to fix.

We thought this was really good....definitely a different take on chicken soup.  I will make this again, though next time I will add more chicken and thicken the broth just a bit.

This was good and super easy. I did reduce the bbq sauce by 1/4 C and added a can of baked beans for more  bulk. Husband loved it!

This was definitely NOT a good recipe. I think it's mainly Bc BBQ sauce doesn't belong in a soup. I will not make this again
