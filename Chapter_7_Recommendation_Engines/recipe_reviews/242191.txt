I made this exactly as written, but instead used Splenda products for the sugars listed. Enjoyed it. The cooked sweetened mixture was much like making a lemon pie. I squeezed half of a lemon's juice over the rhubarb before putting the topping on.  It is a reliable recipe.

Tasted stupendous, BUT i recommend making more crumble so it is more crunchy and not just goo. Here is how i cut it in halves :D
1/2C flour
3/8 oats
3/8 brown sugar OR 1/2 sugar if you didn't cut
1/4C melted butter
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Because we have an older type of rhubarb that is very sour this recipe works perfectly for it. I had some trouble with my first batch of cornstarch syrup not thickening--I must have done something wrong because I made a second batch and it thickened just fine. Added a pint of canned sour cherries because I prefer more filling but otherwise made it as described. Very good!

I love all things rhubarb and this was pretty tasty.  My main complaint is that there wasn't enough "crisp" on it.  I even doubled the crisp when I made it and still felt like it needed more.  I prepared it at home and cooked it at my mom's house while we were BBQing. Once it came out of the oven we topped it off with some vanilla bean ice cream.  YUM-O

Don't recommend this recipe.  Mixture super sticky hard to work with. Cooked sugar mixture more than 5 minutes never thickened or got clear.

One of the best rhubarb crisp recipes! Sweet (but not too sweet), and the crisp is actually crispy and not gooey! Love it, and it will become my 'go to' recipe again!!

Bottom stuck so next time I will not put in the bottom layer; otherwise it was easy to put together & good flavor.  I doubled the rhubarb amount too since I find all recipes for crisp short on it & it makes it a little more tart.

I used frozen fresh rhubarb, utilizing the juice strained off as the water.  I also made 1/2 again as much “crust” as we like more available to sprinkle on top ??

Don’t repeat. Too heavy w streusel on bottom and top. Corn starch makes fruit too gummy. Try Emily Luchetti’s crisp from her cookbook, Stars Desserts...excellent, light and fruit flavors shine through.

Could not get it out of the pan. The syrup that you coat over the crumbs just all stuck together.  Will not make it again. So disappointed.

My 10 yr old made this while using rhubarb for the first time. We were impressed. I thought it was a little too sweet, so I would consider cutting down on the sugar. She served it with whipped topping. The creamy topping was a great combination with the sweet and tart.

This was my first time cooking with rhubarb. I wasn't sure how many stalks to equal the correct amount so I ended up having to cut the recipe in half. It was one of the best desserts I've ever tasted! I will attempt the full recipe very soon. I bought 9 stalks of rhubarb this time instead of 4.
