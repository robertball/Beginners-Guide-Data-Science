I enjoyed this, but did some tweaking:  using recs below, I used half mayo/half cream cheese, fat-free.  I used minced garlic rather than garlic powder.  Don't use more sun-dried tomatoes than the recipe states b/c the taste will overwhelm the artichokes, keep it in balance.  And finally, I prefer cooking dips like this in a small crockpot because it keeps it warm during the party rather than allowing to cool.  I served with garlic crostini (good basic recipe is on this site).

Awesome!!! A few suggestions though for it to be perfect.  Instead of 1 cup of mayonaise I used 3/4 cup of mayonaise and 1/4 cup of cream chesse.  Also you must use fresh parmesan cheese. I also sprinkled a little bit of extra parmesan on top. This is so yummy that I have to fix it for every family get together.

The taste of this dip is absolutely delicious!  I only gave it four stars, though, because it was really greasy.  I kept it warm in a mini crockpot, and grease was just floating on top.  But it tasted so good, no one really seemed to mind!

This tasted really good but was a little greasy.  Next time I make it I will substitute cream cheese or sour cream for some of the mayo to cut down on that.  I think I would like more sundried tomatoes in it as well.  I did add some minced garlic and that worked well.  I used the marinated artichoke hearts and liked the extra flavor.

I must get asked for this recipe at least a few times everywhere I bring it. I usually use more sun dried tomatoes and slice them up a bit. I've also done the recipe with bacon and green onions - exceptional. In any case, cook until the center bubbles and let sit.

I have been making this for years.  Here is a tip for the people who say it is too greasy.  Make sure you bake it in the oven.  If you Put it in the microwave or in a crock pot the grease does float on top.  Bake in a pie plate at 350 until lightly browned and serve warm.  It does make a big difference.

Everyone loved this recipe even the non artichoke eaters liked it.  I used 1/2 cream cheese 1/2 mayo.  Turned out great.  This is a super easy recipe.

I made this dish and served it with pita breads squares at my family's house warming party. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand (didn't use the green onions or parmesean). Instead, I used a bit of left over mozarella from a pizza night and it came out great. I cup the mayo in half and made up for it with low fat cream cheese which worked really well. Our guests requested the recipe.

This was very easy to make. I needed a quick recipe for a weekend with the girls and this fit the bill. It was completely gone! I made it ahead of time and just stuck it in the oven when I got there. Delicious!

This was great.  I only made one change, which was to use one medium fresh roma tomato instead of sun-dried tomatoes.  Turned out great.  Everything else I did exactly according to the recipe.  I would make it exactly the same way next time - turned out perfect!  Delicious!  Great with Ritz crackers or tortilla chips.

I made this at home for dinner for around 25 people and it was a huge hit!  I brought the tiny bit remaining to work the next day and they loved it too!  The one change I did make was instead of sun dried tomatoes, I used banana peppers for a little spice. Very good!

Enjoyed this very much!  Also agree that it is best served with sourdough bread chunks.  I cut down the mayo to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup cream cheese.  Very good!

Although I thought this was quite tasty, I didn't hear any rave reviews at the potluck I took it to.  I did make modifications based on other reviews & I used 3 oz of cream cheese and a little over 1/2 C of mayo and felt these changes made it creamy and not greasy.  I also doubled the artichokes and added a pinch of salt and pepper.  Served with triscit thin crackers, but would be good with a good french baguette.  Overall, I liked it and will probably make it again.

Excellent twist on the traditional dip. I used pita triangles and the small pumpernickel bread as the base. Everyone loved it.

It did not turn out very good. It may have been the parmasean cheese. I used a blend because I picked up the wrong container at the store.

I listened to most of the reviews and used half a cup of mayo and half a cup of cream cheese, and it was still VERY greasy. I also added onion, chopped fresh spinach, and fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. This was just an ok recipe for me. I probably won't be making it again.

I'm giving it a 4 for the recipe as it is, but to make it a 5, do as another reviewer suggested & substitute 1/2 cup cream cheese (I used the reduced fat kind) for 1/2 cup of the mayo. This makes it WAY less greasy. I made it as written the first time, but it was way too greasy. This method makes a huge difference, & in my opinion, makes it more flavorful as well. The last 2 times I made it I used Roma tomatoes, seeded & choppped, instead of sundried. I've made this dip at least 5 times now & everyone always loves it. I serve it with the artisanal bread that has cloves of garlic baked into it.

I followed suggestions of half mayo half cream cheese. This dish was just okay . . . as good as most artichoke dips. Definitely serve with a hearty cracker or crostini.
