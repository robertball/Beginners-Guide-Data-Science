Alot of you are complaining about the fact that the noodles seem dry after it's been baked. Just make extra sauce and toss it with the noodles before you put them in the baking dish,then do your layering. When you layer it and add the rest of the sauce,all of it will be moist and delish. Problem solved. This recipe is just a blue print. You can do anything with it. Add fresh garlic,thyme,rosemary, or use a shallot instead of just onion. The skies the limits ladies just take it and run with it.

I've been looking for a chicken casserole recipe that doesn't use canned soup, and this sure did the trick. My husband and I thought this was great! Like others, I tweaked a few things. I baked 4 chicken breasts that were sprinkled with garlic powder, lemon pepper and dill, cooked the pasta in the broth that went into the sauce, chopped and steamed a head of fresh broccoli and mixed everything together (including all of the cheese) rather than layering. The sauce melted the cheese and created this wonderfully cheesy gooeyness all through the dish :)! I didn't bother doubling the sauce, and didn't think it was dry at all. Last, I cooked it for 35 minutes to get everything bubbling nicely. Yum!

The best casserole that I have made from this site. I was afaid we wouldn't like it, since we like very spicy foods with lots of flavor, but this was great & very simple. After reading the reviews I made a few changes. I used fesh broccoli, we don't like frozen (to many stems) & used swiss & cheddar. Instead of layering the ingred., I mixed them all together w/ 8oz grated swiss cheese. Then I doubled the sauce & poured it over the top, finishing w/ the grated cheddar. Wow.  I love to cook & try different things so we rarely eat the same thing twice even when its really good, but this is definetly something I will make regularly.

I made this for a family before a funeral and they said they loved it! But, I changed a few things based on what others have said: Instead of chicken broth, I added cream of chicken soup to the onion mixture and made double of what it called for. Also, I put about 1/4 of the mixture right on top of the noodles before the chicken so that the noodles wouldn't be dry.  I also added some garlic powder and onion powder in with the soup/onion mixture.  Last, I layered about 1/3 of the cheese right on top of the chicken to get that flavor throughout, and used swiss in addition to the provolone and chedder. Although I didn't have any, they said they really enjoyed it!

I really enjoyed this recipe and it was easy to make.  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to try & spice it up a bit and avoid using as many pans.  After cooking & removing the chicken from the pan, I sauteed the onions in the same skillet and also added a couple of cloves of chopped garlic.  When I added the chicken broth, I scraped up the brown bits left from the chicken in the bottom of the pan.  I also added a few hearty dashes of cayenne & cumin to the sauce.  I didn't have any provolone cheese on hand, so I substituted some mozzarella & swiss to go along with the cheddar.  I also used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  I ended up with a great dish that I'll most likely try again.  I think that there is an endless possibility of variations that can be made to this dish, depending on what you have on hand. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this tonight, but with penne instead of egg noodles and fresh broccoli that I blanched for 3 minutes in the microwave first. For the sauce, I doubled it and added a generous dash of cayenne and curry. Then I added shredded cheddar directly to the sauce until melted. Next, I layered the ingredients as recommended but sprinkled parmesan (instead of provolone) on top of everything before pouring on the sauce. I then put a bit more shredded cheddar & parmesan over the top prior to baking. It was very tasty, and had just the right "zip", without being too spicy. I would definitely make it again.

This is a good basic recipe but needs some oomph.  I used roasted chicken from a deli that has more flavour than home cooked. I also made extra sauce and added some to the noodles before layering them into the casserole.  I cooked the noodles in chicken broth and used the broth in the sauce.  In addition I added dried garlic to the sauce as it was being prepared, white  pepper (it has a different taste).  I added canned sliced mushrooms and sliced almonds browned in marg.  I omitted the half the broccoli.

Be aware it will take longer than 20 min. to assemble the ingredients for this recipe. It took me 45 min. to make this from scratch.  If you are making from scratch and don't have ingredients precooked and precut, it may take that long. This could use a larger amount of the white sauce portion and less cheese.  It is not a favorite with our family.

As the recipe stands, I give it three stars. With alterations, I am sure I shall make this again and again. Next time I am planning to double the sauce as well as increasing the cheese and adding some of it to the sauce to melt before I pour it over the chicken and noodles. Also, I increased the noodles from 6 oz to 4 cups. And I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and could see no difference.

My whole family loves this recipe!  It is the best chicken casserole I have ever had.  I have made it as written and it is very good, but with the following changes we have found we like it even better:  adding 1 chopped clove of garlic to the onion and adding 4 oz of cream cheese to the sauce after it starts to thicken. We also add less grated cheese because we eat all organic and that much organic cheese would cost a lot!  Great recipe!!

WAY Too much onion!!  I would use only half of one next time. Otherwise, fairly easy to make and tastes alright.

I really enjoyed this one. I used mini bowtie noodles and fresh steamed broccoli. The secret for adding flavor to my chicken is you season and flour boneless skinless pieces, and then brown them in a little olive oil and butter. Cube or leave whole. The sauce for this casserole is like making gravy, and you can add whatever seasonings (like poultry seasoning) to make it more flavorful. This made a large quantity. Leftovers were great. I prefer mixing it all together as opposed to layering. It did not turn out dry at all. Thanks for the awesome recipe for a casserole that does not require a can of soup!

This was very good.  It had a mild flavor which was fine with me.  I'm just glad I found a good casserole recipe that doesn't call for any canned condensed soups!  I did add about 1/3 cup mayo, as suggested by another reviewer, and decreased the milk a little.  I also added some chopped bacon, shredded cheddar, and chicken bouillon to the sauce mix.  I par-steamed fresh broccoli and I'm glad I did.  The addition of slivered almonds on top was wonderful.  If anything, I would add a few shakes of garlic salt next time to the sauce.

This is a tasty recipe, however, I suggest doubling the sauce recipe.  There was not enough sauce for the casserole.  I also suggest instead of putting all the cheese just on the top, layer it throughout.  I followed the other suggestions about using Swiss instead of the Provolone.  I am glad I did.  Made it even better.  Very Filling.

Wonderful!!! Believe it or not I cooked this and took it to friends who had a death in the family without ever trying it myself!  I did double the recipe and kept some at home for my family. I was a little nervous since I had not tried it, everyone raved!

A delicious recipe with a few modifications. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. I also sauteed one minced garlic clove with the onion. I used heavy cream instead of milk, and I added 1/4 cup of sourcream to sauce. I saved this recipe, and will definitley make it again!

Made it the same as the recipe said, except I had to use chicken bullion (no chicken broth in the house!).  It turned out great and my husband, anti-broccoli, even had seconds!

This is a simple and great recipe that I have gave my own little spin on.. I substituted provolone for swiss cheese and used an extra sharp cheddar as well. I aslo added some garlic powder in the sauce and bread crumbs on the top while baking.  Very good and very creamy!  YUM!

This was much more flavorful than I expected.  I didn't even need to add salt or pepper.  I did make slightly more sauce than the recipe called for.  I used two cups of chicken broth and 1 cup milk.  I didn't think the sauce looked good at all when I poured it on top of the noodles/chicken/broccoli.    But after tasting this dish I think the sauce really synthesized the flavors together well.

Very easy.  Very good.  I made this with turkey and my kids loved it!  I did add a fair amount of salt and pepper to the sauce - so we did not find it bland.  The next time I make this, I will try adding green chilies for a twist.

My family loved this!  My 5-year-old said it was "yummy."  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  It has a nice, solid flavor.  Overall it's very light tasting.  My only substitution was cheddar jack cheese instead of cheddar and provolone.  It turned out great.  Also, I'd put most of the cheese on top next time rather than adding more to put on top outside of the oven.  My family likes the browned cheese.  My sauce was thin, but baked well, flavoring the dish nicely, and moistening the noodles very well.  

The quantity was enormous.  A family of four could get by easily cutting the recipe in half.  I'll definitely make this again!

I think the sauce should be doubled because my casserole was very dry.  My family found the flavor to be bland.  Some extra spices might help.  I probably won't make this again.  There are too many chicken casseroles far better than this one.

This was okay...an easy middle of the week dish.  I thought the roux on its own was kind of bland so I added a few squirts of spicy brown mustard and that made a big difference - made it a four star instead of a three star dish.  Good comfort food.

I thought this recipe was great.  I listened to the other reviews and used swiss and cheddar. I took swiss slices and spread them on top of the brocolli, poured the sauce over and then topped it with shredded cheddar/jack.  I thought the swiss added great flavor within the dish and made it not so bland (as others said).  It made a great dish with all ingredients I had on hand! I also didn't have egg noodles so I used macaroni and it was awesome.  Almost like a glorified mac and cheese!

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make!  My whole family liked it.  It was even easy to accommodate my husband who doesn't like broccoli.  I simply left the broccoli off half the casserole and he enjoyed it as much as the rest of the family!

Too bland even with adding swiss cheese, italian seasoning, and red peppers.

I also didn't like the fact that I had to pre-cook the chicken and veggies and make the sauce in a separate pan.  When I'm looking for a casserole recipe, I want to throw everything in the casserole dish, put it in the oven and forget about this.  This was too much work for a casserole.

I liked this a lot.  My family thought it was something they would eat again also.  I would, however, make more of the sauce...we thought it would be a little bit more moist that way.  It also needs to be seasoned a little more.  Salt it for sure.  And the suggestions that some canned soups be used is something I will try next time I make it as I surely will.  It seems like a fairly healthy meal with all balanced needs in one meal.

This was absolutely delicious! I fried 2 chicken breasts (between 6-8 oz) lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, in butter over medium heat, for about 4 minutes on each side (or till the pink was gone but not dried), and then I shredded them with two forks. I also added a couple of potatoes, in which I had cubed, boiled, and then lightly sauteed in the pan that I had cooked the chicken in with a little extra fat. When I made the sauce, I accidently browned the onion (tending to little ones and the phone rang), but I found that it added a LOT OF FLAVOR to the sauce. I initially made the quantity stated in the recipe, but after assembling the casserole, the sauce didn't look like it would be enough. I ended up stirring the same quantities of broth, milk and flour into the previous sauce I made, and reheated till thickened. My picky family aren't huge fans of chicken but they gobbled up this dish. When my husband helped himself to 3 servings, then I knew I have found a winner. I will definitely make this over and over again! Thanks for the recipe and the flexibility you allow us to have, Silver Shadowwolf.

Wow! This dish is absolutely delicious. Bravo! I think if you add cream of chicken soup on top of the noodles before pouring the yummy sauce, it might moisten those noodles enough to prevent them from drying out while baking. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Very good!  I melted 1/2 lb Velvetta in the broth/milk (skipped provolone cheese and only put chedder on the top before baking)  and we ALL loved it.  So versatile!  Also, added about 1/2 cup peas to broccoli.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt and that added a variety of flavors.

This was pretty good, a little bland but worth working with.  I followed the recipe really closely but I used only 3c cooked chicken which was plenty with everything else. I never added provolone cheese to a casserole before, it was stringy and not as flavorful as I thought but not sure what I'd use instead unless I used all cheddar - but we'll have it again with some seasoning, it was nice & quick and ss liked it, he prefers blander foods anyway

Delish!!  I haven't made a casserole in a long time, but am so happy I chose to make this one!  Whole family enjoyed it!!!  I nearly doubled the sauce components - used 5 tablespoons butter, almost 1/2 cup flour and the full 1.5 c milk and alomst 3 c broth.   Since I had to cook my breasts( used 4) , I chose to sauté them in a pan with canola oil spray and about a TB butter and seasoned them with garlic salt, onion powder, Adobo and black pepper.  Once they were almost done, I threw in a big handful of green onions ~ probably about 5-6.

Don't change a thing!  
We loved this.  I used cheddar and mozzarella instead of provolone because that's what I had.  Baked at 400 for 20 min. and then another 10 min. at 350.  Mixed milk with flour first and then added to cooked onions. No lumps. Then added chicken broth.

My family and I loved this casserole!  I added a few things....I made a bit more sauce and added some garlic and about 3 or 4 ounces of Velveta cheese.  I think I will try some bread crumbs on top next time.  Instead of layering everything, I mixed the pasta, sauce and broccoli together and then topped with cheese.  Very good!!

YUM-O I HAD MADE A BIG POT OF CHICKEN & RICE A FEW NIGHTS AGO, SO I USED THAT INSTEAD OF THE NOODLES. this stuff was amazing, my family loved it. I could eat the white sauce by itself. No more cream can soup, i'm going to make this homemade. Try mixing some dried breadcrums with the shredded cheese on top for a crispy crust on top, yummy~

Just looking at the sauce contents I thought "There's no flavor in here".
And, after everyone ate the top layer of cheese, there was no more flavor. A very bland recipe. We looked at each other after starting to eat this and ended up going to McDonald's. Don't wste your money on the ingredients, it's just plain bad, sorry. WE won't be making this again.

I tweaked this a bit by adding two cloves of garlic with the onion, substituted peas for the broccoli and Italian blend cheese for the Swiss.  Next time I will add fresh grated Parmigan at the end.  It was very good.

Thanks to all the other reviewers I was able to turn this 3 star dish into a real tasty meal. I was happy to find a recipe that didn't call for condensed canned soup but many of the reviews said it was too bland. I made the following changes; I used 4 tablespoons of butter and a 1/2 cup of flour to make the roux before adding double the amount of chicken broth and milk. That is essencial if you want enough sauce to cover the rest of the ingredients. I also added a few dashes of hot sauce and Old Bay seasoning to give more flavor. I replaced the provolone chesse with parmesan and put the cheeses on before pouring the sauce over everything as the last step. Overall it turned out well but like another reviewer mentioned there were way too many dishes and pans to wash.

This is more than just ediable but its not too fantastic either...just "good."  My less-than-great review may stem from the fact that my tastebuds are almost usless while I have this HORRIBLE cold but I didn't hear my family members rave about it either. In fact, I'm so miserable my roommate made this for dinner (under my weary direction).  Therefore, this is a really easy recipe. He made a few changes, used rotini noodles instead of egg noodles, added a dash of onion/garlic powder to the sauce, and added a little more cheese and mixed it throughout...but all else was left the same. The result was like I said "good" but I'm not sure if I'd make this again...even when I feel better. Thanks anyways.

I used a little bit of Swiss Cheese with the cheddar, which was really good.  I thought that the Cheddar/Provelone mix sounded like it would be a little too bland. The Swiss gave it a really nice 'kick'.  My family and I really enjoyed it!

This was great! Even my kids loved it. Instead of egg noodles I used sliced potatoes, and Velveeta cheese instead of provolone. It turned out awesome. I will definitely be making this again, probably very soon.

I was extremely pleased with this casserole.  I have to eat gluten-free, so I am always on the lookout for casseroles that don't use condensed soup.  I easily substituted tapioca flour and gluten free pasta.  It is more flavorable than you would think.  I am glad I resisted the urge to add garlic as DH and I loved it as.  (and he usually loves lots of spice.)

My family loved it.  Very glad to find a recipe that doesn't use cream of something soup.  We try to eat foods with short ingredient lists, mostly homemade.

I thought it was good, but way better with some adjustments.  I only used two chicken breasts because that's all I had on hand and it was plenty.  It completely filled a 9x13 casserole dish.  I had to cook the breasts before shredding, so I coated them in a spice rub mix from the farmer's market.  I also used fresh steamed broccoli.  I sauteed the onions in the same pan and added a splash of white wine before doing the sauce part.  (I let it evaporate first.)  Next time, I won't add the flour first, as it made the onions clump together.  Instead, I'll shake it up with the milk and add it to the chicken broth when it's simmering.  I increased the broth to two cups and the milk to one cup and, while the noodles soaked up the sauce, they weren't dry.  I would increase the sauce even more.  I also didn't bother with the layering.  I mixed it all up and then put the cheese on top.  I think this is a great base recipe, though, and I will make it again with the adjustments.

Good sauce (seemed just the right amount) but needs more seasoning.  Maybe season each item separately: the noodles after boiling, the chicken while cooking, the veggies (i used a frozen mix and it turned out great).  Followed advice of other reviewers and mixed all ingredients with sauce instead of layering.  Will definitely make again!

As others suggested, used Penne and mix everything instead of layering.  Also added cayanne and curry to taste and topped with grated parmesan.  My guys had seconds.

This was tasty. I used whole wheat pasta, and just two large chicken breasts, fresh broccoli instead of frozen, added fresh mushrooms, and made about 1.5 times the called for sauce. When I make it again, I think I will steam the broccoli for a minute or two because the broccoli was just a little too crisp. But overall, it was good.

I liked this recipe, but I made a few changes to it.  First, I boiled the pasta in the chicken broth that I would use for the sauce. I added garlic with the onion. I added nutmeg to the sauce. I also doubled the sauce and I added italian bread crumbs to the top of the casserole. It was pretty good.  I think next time I make it, I will buy the pre-cooked Louis Rich shredded chicken, to make things a little quicker.

My husband absolutely loved the recipe.  I did change it a bit after reading the other reviews.  I made more of the sauce and when I put the noodles in I put sauce over them along with mozzarella cheese (I had it in the house and wanted to get rid of it).  I cooked my chicken in the crockpot and shredded it in the chicken broth then scooped it into the casserole.  I used broccoli and mixed veggies along with swiss cheese, mexican cheese, and bread crumbs on top.  It was outstanding!!!

My husband and I loved this dish.  I used what I had...chicken boullion to make broth and cheddar cheese.  I was leary to double the sauce, but I did make extra.  I cooked it down until it was thick and creamy.  It was great, but I will double it next time.  I was hoping to see if my 3 year old would eat it, but I don't know.  Like so many other things it didn't get close enough to her mouth to find out.

We made this and the boys (6 and 2 1/2 yr old twins) LOVED it!  I used a small onion, boullion, sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  Otherwise, I followed the directions!  We will definitely make this again!  Thanks

I thought this was very bland.  There wasn't enough sauce so the noodles really had no flavor.  I wish I would have read all the reviews and changes people made before making it as is.  I wouldn't make this again.

I really liked this recipe! I chose not to double the sauce as many people did & I really didn't have a problem with the taste. I added 1 tsp onion powder & garlic salt to the white sauce but will up it by 1/2 tsp next time for more flavor. My husband also suggested adding some pepper for some zip. I used fresh broccoli, mozz & red fat swiss cheese. It tasted really good & am looking forward to experimenting with it some more-thanks so much! So glad this casserole didn't ask for cream soups, which I'm staying away from :-).

Nice mellow flavor!  I used cheddar and swiss, and added a can of drained mushrooms.  Not a highly spiced dish, but the flavor was excellent.

VERY blan. It definitely sounds better than it turns out. If I decide to make this again, it needs something, maybe bread crumbs and/or sour cream, and like tons of others have said, more sauce.

I made a few changes -- but it turned out pretty good! I used Reams Egg noodles - partially cooked version - they cook much faster in boiling water. These are thicker noodles, so made it more like a chicken and dumplings taste. I was also low on broccoli (I used fresh)  - so I sprinkled frozen mixed veeggies on top of the noodles before adding chicken mixture and sauce.  I didn't have provolone cheese - so just used cheddar - and sprinkled some toasted, sliced almonds on top with the cheese- was a nice addition!

I was out of a few things that this recipe called for, so I used twisty pasta and sprinkled parmasan cheese instead of the provolone.  My sauce never got thick so I added some fat-free sour cream, and it was really good.  I will add more sauce and definately more spices next time.  Will for sure make again!

Very bland. I have read the other reviews and thought I would give it another try. Still just as easy to put together, however, still very bland and uneventful. Sorry - don't think I'll try again.

I made this recipe with rice instead of the egg noodles because that is all I had, and it was great.  I used a sharp and mild cheddar cheese instead of the provolone, it was very rich and creamy!

I needed to prepare a dish that could be prepared one day and then simply reheated the next.  I was not available to put everything together on the day I was to serve it to a group of 65.  After running all the ratios and conversions everything came off smoothly.  I followed the advice of many other  reviewers and 1.5x the recipe for the liquid and I understand it was great.  I filled 4 full size 2.1 gal chafing dishes.  I did not layer as called for in the original recipe but had refrigerated everything except for the pasta and broccoli the night before.  Then simply mixed everything together on refrigerated overnight.  The whole process for me took 3 days do to time commitments.  The serving day I just sprinkled some Italian bread crumbs over 1/3 of the cheese I had reserved, baked for 25 minutes and it was done.  It is important to remove from the fridge at least a couple of hours to bring to room temperature before cooking to minimize reheating time.  I cooked it in a convection oven that provided uniform heating.  The first day I baked the boned/skinless chicken breasts, which to me, is better than boiling them and easier for a serving this size than doing them on the stove.

Seems a pity to start with whole chicken breasts.  This recipe s/REALLY/b all about using leftover roast chicken, leftover gravy and leftover cooked broccoli.  That is what I used and it is a fine dish.  I added 2/3 of the cheese to the leftover gravy wi/ enough fat free 1/2 & 1/2 to make a couple of cups of cheese sauce, to which I then added about a teaspoon of Franks hotsauce.  Tasty.  And economic, and a nice change from leftover roast chicken in soup, pot pie, or al la king.

I made this recipe exactly as printed. It was very boring and rather tasteless! Don't know why it has so many good reviews. The next night I reheated and reworked it with CANNED cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  What an improvement! Nothing wrong with canned soup when you need to add quick flavor.

I thought this was great.  A great weeknight dish.  Homestyle but fairly simple.  I simplified by adding a can of chicken broth, fresh Broccoli chopped fine, a garlic and herb rotissere(sp) chicken... was great and made even better leftovers.  Thanks Silver!

Like a previous reviewer I too was looking for something that didn't call for canned cream soup...as most broccoli casserole recipes seem to...so I thought I would give this a try.  I changed it up a some by using 1/2c mayo & 1/4c sour cream in place of the milk, which gave it a great flavor.  Then I just mixed all ingredients together, except for the flour, and topped it with bread crumbs before baking. Also I omitted the noodles and served it over rice.  With these changes it was a 5 star recipe...a delicous, easy & fast meal!

This was fantastic! My husband actually took the leftovers to work, and he NEVER takes leftovers. I made quite a few of the suggested changes, like doubling the sauce and mixing everythign together.

Sorry folks but I have to give a thumbs down to this one.

I just didn't think it was anything special - even with lots of tweaking and doubling the sauce.

Prep time took forever, and the outcome was mediocre.  Eeek, this is the first low grade I've ever given a recipe on this site.

Great recipe and my family ate it all up. I did take some of the suggestions and use them though. I probably doubled the cheese (didn't measure, just sprinkled til it looked good) and sprinkled bread crumbs on top. I also substituted the flour and chicken broth for a family size can of Cream of Chicken soup and used about 1/2 can of milk. It too juicy either. In fact, after the leftover sit overnight in the fridge, it will probably be dry and I'll need to add some chicken broth to it when heating it up.

Very good flavor.  I'd suggest not substituting the provolone.  It really gives it a good flavor.  I used a white cheddar.  My sauce turned out a bit thin, but that could very possibly by cook error!  It did take a little time, but it would be worth cooking again.

This was a huge hit with my teenage kids.  Previous reviewers mentioned that it came out dry, so I doubled the sauce and cheese.  I also melted the cheese directly into the sauce, creating a cheese sauce, rather than layering the ingredients.  The flavor was wonderful. This will be a regular meal in our house.

I found it quite tasty. I was out of milk so I used chicken broth, and I mixed up a little buttermilk. I hope to make it again with all the right stuff.

The recipe looked excellent and smelled even better but as another user suggested, once the cheese was gone, the mother sauce with onions, pepper and salt was not enough to hold this together. 

I felt like I was eating tuna noodle casserole and I HATE THAT STUFF. My wife ate it and was ok with it but my son and I did not like it. I won't be making this again!

Fairly easy to make and the whole family loved it, even my picky 4 year old.  I, myself, found the sauce a little bland.  I will definitely make it again, but with maybe some added spices.

The casserole tasted great and was easy to make.  Maybe instead of the chicken broth sauce you make, I was thinking of using cheesy broccoli soup, just a thought!

I made this casserole and a sweet dinner roll from this site for a friend who just had a baby. I wanted something that they could use now or freeze for later. They thought it was very good, so I can't wait to make it for our family. My daughter who especially loves chicken and broccoli will really love this. Would also be good with California blend vegetables. Thanks!

This is a very good recipe.  I had rotisserie chicken in the refrigerator so that's what I used.  I also had green beans cooked so I substituted them for the broccoli.  I made 1/2 of the recipe and that was four good-sized servings.  This is good, comfort food.  I would make it again.

I have never been a casserole person but liked all the ingredients in this recipe so decided to give it a try. I have made this several times and everyone loves it. I do make double the sauce plus use a pre-cooked whole chicken from the store to add more flavor. I also use red pepper flakes while cooking the onion, just to give it a little kick.

Easy chicken casserole with no condensed soup! Used garlic and fresh broccoli. Mixed the cheese in with the sauce to melt and cut down on oven time. Cooked cubed chicken tenderloins instead of shredded chicken. Came out great!

We LOVED this!  Albeit, I put my own twist to it. I boiled 2 chicken legs and 2 chicken thighs, seasoned the broth, measured out the correct amount for the recipe, then used more of it to boil my noodles, and to steam my broccoli. (I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.) I doubled the sauce as recommended by several.  I also used some Red Hot pepper seasoning in it to give it a bit of bite, a little garlic and Herbs de Provence!  I didn't have Provolone OR Swiss... but I did have Cheddar and Mozzarella, so I shredded and blended those.  MMMMMM Dinner last night was FANTASTIC!!
I will make this again with dark meat chicken, home made broth, doubled, spiced and herb'ed sauce... the cheese... it was amazing and gooey... Yeah, I'll do that again too!

This was an amazing recipe, and it was simple to make.  I followed the recipe, except I used Mexican shredded cheese (to save time).  This meal was so tasty!  My husband and I both had 2 helpings.  I will make this again, soon.  The only thing I would change is, I will add a light layer of cheese on top of the noodles.  I also added garlic powder and parsley to season.  I seasoned the noodles, and the meat was seasoned during cooking, seasoned the broccoli, and seasoned the sauce while cooking.  Absolutely LOVED IT!

I had some organic canned white meat chicken that I needed to use up and decided to make this casserole.  I especially liked that it did not involve any canned cream soup.  I used fresh broccoli and a gluten free egg noodle instead of frozen broccoli and regular egg noodles.  The fresh broccoli was blanched during in the same pot that I cooked the noodles in for the last 3 minutes of cooking time  for the noodles.  After draining the broccoli and noodles, I used the same pot to make the sauce.  I decided to add some additional flavor so I added fresh garlic while the onions were cooking and some fresh thyme and rosemary when adding the salt and pepper.  I added a combination of Parmesan, mozzarella and white cheddar cheese to the sauce then mixed everything together in a lightly greased casserole dish.  I topped the whole thing with a little additional grated cheddar.   The end result was a very flavorful and delicious chicken casserole!

Doubled this recipe for our large family..none left..they all loved it! After reading the previous reviews, I also "tweaked" it a little. I used a whole rotisserie chicken(deboned and chopped), fresh broccoli(steamed before adding), doubled the sauce and added about 2 tsp Dijon mustard to the sauce. I also mixed all of the ingredients, except the cheese before pouring it in the baking dish. This will be a repeat many times! Creamy, flavorful, and easy!

This is the BEST chicken and broccoli casserole I have ever made, HANDS DOWN!   The secret is in how the sauce is made.  I used pappardelle pasta (wonderful wide noodles) and they were not dry at all like many have complained of here.  In fact, my entire casserole was very moist and "saucy."  I used rotisserie chicken (from Costco in the package of torn up chicken) and fresh broccoli (which I slightly steamed first).  I probably used more than one cup of cheese and sprinkled some on top of the broccoli BEFORE I poured the sauce in, then put the rest on top of the sauce.  It was so good, it was hard not to go back for seconds.  I'm definitely making this for company and will take it to any potluck I go to!

Starter, it needs some seasoning help or it just tastes like chicken noodle soup with cheese.

Really, really liked this. Steamed the broccoli for 2 minutes In the microwave  so it wouldn't be too crispy. Skipped the onion( for the kids) but seasoned  the chicken with garlic salt and pepper for flavor. Used 2 cups chicken stock  and 3/4 cup milk with about 3 tbsp butter and flour. Then seasoned the sauce with salt and pepper and stirred everything together. Topped with extra cheese and panko breadcrumbs. Delish.

I made it as written and it was a huge hit at our house! That being said, it seems like it might be one of those casseroles where you could throw  just about anything in it and it would still be great. I am thinking about throwing some bacon in it next time around.

Ok, I did alter this the tiniest bit with additional seasoning, but other than that I stayed pretty true to the original recipe. I treated the sauce as a béchamel base for a Mac & Cheese and added some dried  mustard,

Family loved this recipe. I am however going to up the cheeses to 2 cups per flavor, and mix 1 cup of each with noodles next time. Has great flavor. We used 4 fresh broccoli crowns chopped and blanched, and Rotini pasta. Love this Casserole!! No problem with being dry at all. Probably because we used fresh broccoli I'm guessing.

Sort of bland for my family's taste, but will make again adding plenty of garlic, and perhaps some red chili pepper flakes. May also be good with Italian Sausage instead of chicken.

For a recipe that gets dissed by the wisenhimer foodies and the veggie set, I was surprised to see it pop up on so many different sites!  Anyhoo, I've made it 3 times before and it is always a hit. I made it again yesterday with what happened to be handy, which was a vacuum packed ham steak, asparagus, and a combo of Gruyere and Monterey jack. Killer!  I browned the ham in a skillet, cut it into 3/4" dice, blanched the 3/4" chunks of asparagus in the pasta cooking water, didn't have quite enough egg noodles so I augmented with some farfalle until the mess was not too over or under cooked. Mixed all the ingredients together, added all the recipe cheese to that & spread it in the 9x13. Then grated another cup of cheese on top for health's sake, and sprinkled a handful of olive oil tossed panko on the top. I think the "dry" issue that people have is over thickening the bechemel... "Slightly thickened" that's the key. Anyway, can't say enough good things. Thanx for a great foundation to build on Silver!

Really enjoyed this!!Changed it up  a little. Used whole wheat flour and whole wheat rotoni noodles. Didn't use broth  instead I just seasoned my sauce. For my son who doesn't like anything to say it was good I'm  impressed

We loved this dish! I normally don't try a recipe with less than a 4.5 star rating and there have to be several reviewers, so I was skeptical of this recipe. But after reading the recipe through I decided it was worth a try. We give it 5 stars!

5 stars for a great basic chicken casserole base to change up with what you happen to have on hand. Thanks Silver! No fresh onion so I used an envelope of Lipton onion soup instead just prior to adding the cheddar. No fresh milk, but had evaporated milk. Used parmesan since no provolone. I steamed a pound bag of fresh cauliflower/broccoli/baby carrot mix for the vegies and also used whole grain elbow macaroni. 
Not a bad way to stretch your food for a supper casserole before having to go to the grocery store.

so yeah, defiantly needed the extra sauce and also seasoned meat,and I used seasoned blend for the mixture with onions.This is a good recipe if you tweak it to your taste thought the one listed is a bit bland you have to rely on you taste and your instinct on this one, but all in all a very good recipe

The dish had great flavor, but there was just not enough sauce.  The noodles were really dry after coming out of the oven.  I would definitely double the sauce next time.

This is my go-to recipe for taking food to ailing or post surgery friends. I divide into two 8X8 aluminum pans and deliver one hot and ready to eat and one already frozen with reheating instructions for another time. I send some fresh rolls and banana pudding with it and suddenly I am everyone's best friend.

I need recipes that are easy and can be reheated the next day as a snack or as a meal.  I always read the reviews before I try a dish for the first time.  You get so many good ideas.  I loved how easy it is to personalize this recipe.  Here is what I did, thanks to suggestions from other reviewers:  1.  Added chopped garlic to onion. 2.  Poured some of the sauce on top of noodles so they were not dry. 3.  Melted 1/2 the cheese in the sauce. 3.  Used Swiss and cheddar.  4.  Added poultry seasoning to sauce. 5.  Cooked pasta in chicken broth.  6.  Added bread crumbs on top.   7.  Mixed together chicken, veggies and cheese in a bowl and then poured mixture on top of noodles (my layering was noodles, followed by 1/2 the sauce, topped with the chicken/veggie/cheese mixture, and finally topped with other 1/2 of sauce).       There are many chicken dish recipes that include broccoli.  So, to make a change, I used a frozen mix of potatoes, green beans, corn, and sugar snap peas.   I rated this recipe a 5 because it is very simple and doesn't include canned soup(!).

Trashed the kitchen making this lol, but it was worth it.This was just what I was looking for; trying not to go to the store and cook what I had on hand. I made substitutions as a result, I kicked it up a notch with cheddar cheese soup and hot spices to the sauce. I also layered the dish as called for, but mixed in some sauce with each layer, and then poured the remainder on top as well. I did make double the sauce. I used Swiss cheese mixed with Parmesan for the top. Wow, it was a hardy meal for the troops. Thanks

This was a great recipe.  I agree with others that it needs more sauce, but that's so easily fixed.  I used half the chicken, onion and cheese.  When I made the sauce, I used probably twice as much milk (and I used no-salt added veggie stock).  I then put everything (cheese included) in the sauce and dumped it over the noodles and combined them.  It made a LOT of food and was loved by my toddler and husband alike.

Fantastic! I did a few things different. I used thighs and browned them. I also added mushrooms, which I had sauted with the broccoli. I also doubled the cheese.

This was just okay, but my 2 year old liked it and so did my picky husband, who usually dislikes casseroles.  I did make some changes, but it was still rather bland.  I sauteed 1 garlic clove w/the onion and I threw in some mushrooms, which I think are a natural in this recipe.  I made 1 1/2 times the sauce, which was the perfect amount.  I added the flour to the milk and broth and whisked it together before adding it to the pan.  I used fresh broccoli, which I steamed for 3 min in the micro.  I mixed it all together and just put it in 2 baking dishes.  One is frozen for another meal.  All in all it was okay.  Probably a good one for kids.  Not sure if I'll make it again.  If I do, I'll try adding some white wine or sherry for some extra flavor.

I personally prefer more adventurous dishes but this was definitely a crowd pleaser.  The hubs went back for seconds and the picky princesses enjoyed theirs as well.  I love the versatility and adaptability of this dish.  I used penne and a mixture of the cheeses I had on hand and it came out really good.  I made a small batch tonight but next time I'll make it as written (with a little more sauce) and divide it between 2 8x8 so I can freeze one.  This was a hit.

This is good as written. I like the fact that it doesn't call for the salty canned soups. Preparation is simple. Use fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and pre-steam it a little bit.

A perfect winter meal!  I doubled the sauce, used fresh steamed broccoli, added fresh garlic, some italian spices and topped the casserole with panko.  It was even better reheated the next day.  I'll definitely be making this again!

We were pleased to discover the recipe adapts very well to leftover turkey. I used 6 oz. mini farfalle for the pasta, and the little bow ties really added to the presentation.  Also doubled the amount of sauce as suggested in several reviews, using homemade turkey broth instead of chicken broth, and fresh steamed broccoli florets.  If I were to make it again, I might add some chopped almonds for garnish, as I think they'd go well with the dish.

Not enough flavor for me.  I added garlic and I seasoned my chicken but it was a little bland.  My daughter loved it but the rest of thought it was ok.  Not something I would make again. I didn't have a problem with dry noodles like so many said but I didn't thaw my broccoli so that may have helped.

I made this tonight following the recipe for the most part with a few modifications.  I added lots of fresh garlic with the onions.  I doubled the sauce and added white wine, fresh ground pepper and salt to taste.  It was OK but still felt like it was missing something.  Not sure that we will make again.

I doubled this recipe and did not have enough sauce.  The noodles on the bottom were just plain.  The sauce really needs something more.  It is very bland.  The top part of the casserole was better than the bottom.  Kids really liked it and had seconds and thirds.

My husband and I found this recipes okay, not great but fine. I thought it was too much work for what it tasted like. Too many dishes to clean up since everything is cooked separately. But both my small kids ate it so that's a good thing. They usually won't eat casserole dishes so I would make it again for that reason (but not very often!).

I added a can chicken soup to the milk which added more flavour. And I only used Jack Cheese on top because that's all we had in the house.

I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning before cooking it and adding it to the casserole.  I also used fresh broccoli (precooked slightly - 5 min.), and about a cup of leftover cooked ham that I had in the fridge (I did not have quite 5 cups of chicken).  It was very good.

While I thought this was pretty good, my family didn't like it at all.
