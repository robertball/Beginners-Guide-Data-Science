I had leftover tofu that we didn't use for another dinner recipe.  We have decided this was the best way we've ever used tofu.  I didn't have chocolate liquor so I just melted some dark chocolate in the same amount.  Seemed great.

really good... i did add some raspberry sauce on top - i think it needs the raspberry sauce - it really compliments it. i'd probably make it again but i'd probably use maple syrup in place of the sugar.

Very good! Instead of chocolate liquor I used coffee liqueur which gave it a slight bite. I also used less oil in the cake and added chocolate chips and ground walnuts to the crust. This cake is amazing with vanilla ice cream.

i would rate this 5 stars not only for how it tasted but for how much it surprised me!  i made this for a 2 year olds birthday, and some of the adult guests are lactose intolerant and i not being one of them would choose this cake over a cheesecake for it's obvious healthy points.  i did not taste as though it is lacking anything... sooo good!  will make again and again!

This was so good.  The almond crust, the creamy chocolate cake.  Serve in little pieces.  The cocoa makes it not to sweet.  No one will know it's tofu.  It came out perfect.

This is one of my favourite cakes ever!!!  I love surprising people with the fact that it's made of tofu - and thus pretty healthy :).  If you skip the bottom, it cooks well in a microwave as well - I usually cook it for about 7 minutes.  I skip the liqueur, as I never have any, but it works out great.  You can't go wrong with this one.  Thanks Christina :)

I'm sorry, I just did not like this cake.  The inside was too soft and runny, even after it sat overnight in the refrigerator.  The taste was not palatable either (at least to us).
