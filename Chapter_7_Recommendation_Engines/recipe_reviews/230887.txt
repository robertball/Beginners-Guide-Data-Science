This was okay, but little bland.  It needed a bit more seasoning so I added some black pepper, onion and garlic powders.  I will try this again, but might tweak it more to kick it up a bit.

Good and easy to make.  I live at 7500 feet so cooked the rice on the stovetop first.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe, but I substituted the soup. I used cream of mushroom. Yummy

I chalked this one up as a learning experience, IDK if i overcooked it, but the rice and vegtables were crunchy.  I don't think cooking the chicken and rice at the same time is a good way to cook. probably should cook the chicken seperate

I cut it to 1/3 because there is only two of us. I added chicken broth, because my husband likes things with “fluid”. Very good, even in 1/3 it is enough for two meals for two.

This was a good recipe and I will make it again, but with some modifications next time.  It needs more liquid to cook the rice; it needs some more flavorings, like onions or garlic, maybe even some red peppers; and some spices, not sure what right now.  Also, maybe a little panko butter topping for the last 15 or 20 minutes!  Definitely make sure your pan gives you lots of room for liquids and expansion.
