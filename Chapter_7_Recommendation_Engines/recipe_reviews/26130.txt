I must say that I did not care much for this recipe. I found it lacked any real flavor aside from the cranberries. It was also fairly labor intensive. 
Therefore I strongly urge you to find another recipe before attempting this one.

I tested these cookies out before Thanksgiving with my cousin and my husband. We thought these cookies were great. I actually used half and half instead of milk (only because I was out of milk) and I think this made them "creamier" in texture. They are very easy to make. Just use the idea of processing the cranberries. I will definitely make these for our Thanksgiving feast!

We found this on the back of a Christmas library book called "Cranberry Christmas".  The only differences were 2 Tblsp lemon juice instead of orange juice and 1 cup brown sugar.  I also substituted half n' half for the milk and added 2Tblsp butter since there wasn't quite enough to cream the sugar.  My version was wonderful and the kids even loved them!

I thought the cookies were great and so did my family. They were soft and full of flavoring. I added a little almond flavoring and a little bit of lemon juice to bring extra flavor to the cookie. When the cookies cooled i added a orange glaze. I did this becaus ehte first time i made them they were boring.

If you just follow the recipe, I'd give this 3 stars.   I took some recommendations from other reviewers and glazed them after they came out, and that made them perfect!  I can't eat nuts, so I omitted the nuts, but I added orange zest (about the zest of 1 orange), then glazed it with OJ and powdered sugar. They are tangy, not too sweet, and the cranberries make a very colorful cookie for Christmas or valentine holidays.

These cookies are really easy to make, the flavour is quite interesting - sweet and sour. I added a pinch of cinammon, just because i love this spice, and it added a bit of Christmas flavour into it.

Actually, this recipe is from Ocean Spray's Cranberry Kitchen booklet.  There is no date on the booklet, but it's not new.  I inherited from my mother.
