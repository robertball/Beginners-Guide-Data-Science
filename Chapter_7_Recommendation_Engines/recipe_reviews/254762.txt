I’ve been making these sandwiches for many years, and they are wonderful. Very much a family favorite. To the person who said to be sure to drain the beef before adding the “sauce”, you aren’t doing it right. The wet mixture goes onto the RAW ground beef and then you cook and stir stir stir. When it is done there will be no discernible sauce. Just loose meat heaven.

Made as written except that I left out the MSG because I avoid it whenever possible. After tasting it I ended up adding more horseradish and I think it needed that. To me, these were like Sloppy Joe's without the sloppy and we liked them better.  The pickles gives the sandwich a nice crunch so don't leave them off.

I used to work prep for the restraunt that made this recipe in Lincoln Ne.  This recipie is almost exact except for the horseradish was approx 3T and the mustard was 2T per 5lb of meat.  This recipie was advertised to be low fat because we removed the extra fat from the juices...here is how we did it.  Add all meat and sauce and cook while "mashing" and stirring while it cooks so the meat texture is fine.  Strain all juice off the meat pressing it thru a colander.  Freeze juices.  The fat will rise to the top and harden, it can be cut off and removed.  The remaining juices are pored back over the meat, mixed and heated.  Serve with slotted spoon.  Mustard and pickle..enjoy!

This was INCREDIBLE!!! Definitely do NOT drain the meat before adding sauce!  This is where all the wonderful flavor comes from!  Add the sauce mixture right to the RAW meat and just keep cooking and stirring until all the juices are dissipated. Mine took about 40 min of cooking on Med/High and stirring. TASTES JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL “Tastee”!!
