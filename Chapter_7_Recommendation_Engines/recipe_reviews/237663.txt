I love this recipe! It was super easy to make and delicious. Since going vegetarian lemon rice soup has been something I have really missed now I don't have to anymore. This recipe taste exactly like I remember lemon rice soup paired with some bread and butter... Great lunch.

Original poster here: I'm realizing while reading a couple of these reviews that I was using really small lemons to make this recipe. Consider adding one lemon (or even a half a lemon if you aren't really into lemons) and then check for taste when done. I usually taste-test and then add more lemon at the very end if needed, since lemon size can vary so much!

I love the chicken lemon rice soup you find at Greek diners and I wanted to recreate at home without chicken. Unfortunately the juice from my 2 lemons was too much - it was way too lemony and sour. My lemons were med to large large in size and very juicy. Unless you have small lemons I would start with one and you can always add more. Secondly I had little egg white bits in the soup which I think was the result of adding the hot soup to the egg / lemon - it just cooked the eggs right away. It didn't bother me but I know that's not how it's supposed to come out - maybe I will ladle some soup and let it cool off next time?

this is one of my all time favorites. I kick it up a notch by adding a dash of paprika and a sprinkling of crushed red peppers.  I added chicken to my bowl but not the whole pot.

The only good thing about this one was the smell. I added only one lemon but all I could taste was that. It was way too bitter! The texture doesn't work out with every time of rise and the eggs got basically cooked from the hot liquid.

I was really sick and had not eaten in a few days and was looking for a quick easy to make light soup. I literally typed in the search box sick and this is what came up right away. I decided to give it a go and made it exactly as described. I didn t know what the 2 ounces of rice was so I used a half a cup. That seem to be the exact amount needed. The soup overall was simple & easy but was definitely lacking something for me.. I used two lemons also. It good on a weak stomach but probably not one id make any other time.

I absolutely love this recipe! The only thing I change is using lemon juice, not actual lemons. I do this, only because I always have lemon juice on hand. Thank you, so so much for sharing this!

A fast simple alternative to starting from scratch. I used store bought chicken broth and measured the ingredients since the juice in one lemon can vary a lot. 1/2 a cup of rice and 3 tablespoons of juice did the trick for me. You need to mix the hot broth and egg mixture very slowly and beat while adding.

It took a few tries to learn how slowly the hot broth needs to be added to the egg lemon mixture. Also one lemon is plenty for me & it could use a little something extra - I intend to add oregano or maybe greek seasoning next time. But overall I love the ability to eat one of my longtime favorite soups even though I'm a vegetarian & I appreciate that it doesn't take long to make!

Loved this! I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 vegetable broth and 1/2 chicken broth. I used one jumbo lemon and it turned out perfectly. I thickened with a little cornstarch. I will make this over and over!
