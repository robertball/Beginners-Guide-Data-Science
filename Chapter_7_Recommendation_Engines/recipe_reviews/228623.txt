This recipe is excellent!!  I have used it on pork, chicken and hamburgers.  My grandson is allergic to corn syrup, so I left it out and added just a bit more brown sugar and molasses.  VERY GOOD.  This is the only bbq sauce I have made that he has liked.  ENJOY

I didn't have whiskey, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Absolutely amazing!!! This will make me abandon (for a while) a Kansas City Style BBQ recipe I've used for the past 5 years!  Bravo!

Whew-Whee this is a fantastic BBQ sauce!  I made this exactly as written and will do so again when this bottle is finished.  It has a nice thickness to it and a very delicious “kick” to the sauce.  We’ve used this on burgers, pulled pork, chicken and French fries.   Of all of the barbeque sauces I have made, this version is my son’s favorite.  He now lives out on his own and asked me to make it for him so that he doesn’t have to take my bottle home with him!  Thanks TasteKing for sharing your recipe, it is almost time for me to make another batch.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!
