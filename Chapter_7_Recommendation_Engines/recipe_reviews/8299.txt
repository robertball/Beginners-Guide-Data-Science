I have made this cake several times now and each time I am flooded with requests for the recipe. I make it in a HUGE 11X11 square pan, freeze it overnight then cut it into two layers. I fill it with a fudge filling and use the cream cheese frosting. It is absolutely delicious, a tradition now for our family on special occasions. I also made it for a baby shower and the nice white cream cheese frosting made a beautiful backdrop for decorating.

This cake was super-easy, and very very good. Based on other people's suggestions, I mixed in most of the chocolate chips into the batter, then sprinkled the remaining 1/2 cup or so on top of the mixtures in the pan, and it turned out great: the cake looked very inviting :)

The cake tasted good & I think I would make it again without chocolate chips.  They dominated the cake, but overall, this is a good recipe..

Uh, I'm not sure about this recipe.... Made 12 jumbo chocolate (Betty Crocker chocolate fudge) frosted cupcakes last night. I've been eyeing this recipe for a while and am glad I finally got around to trying it, but I do wish the end product tuned out differently. Don't get me wrong... these were good, just not GREAT. For one, there are WAAAY, WAAAY too many chocolate chips in the batter. Every bite (I HAD to try one before sending my bf to work with the rest!) was overwhelmingly chocolaty - and that's not a good thing in this instance, IMHO. I also must agree with fellow reviewer Trcia Jaeger. The "extra" ingredients are a waste if for none other than contributing to the cake's incredibly moist texture (which is a plus). All in all, this is a nice, basic butter cake recipe, but I do believe it is IMPERATIVE to decrease the amount of chocolate chips by at least a cup!!! Thanks for sharing your idea Bobbie :)

I found this recipe to have a little too much of an egg bread texture to it rather than a cake like characteristic.  For the added calories I would rather just stick to a box of cake mix.

I made this cake with chocolate everything and it was a great chocolate fix. Could used to set a day before frosting although I don't think it needs it.  Anna H.

Well, after I frosted this it just tasted like a box mix cake with frosting.  It was good but I don't think it was really worth the extra ingredients.

WoW!  For YEARS I had forgotten about this cake, and it's my own.  My mom started making this when I was young(a LONG time ago) This is a cake for everything, OR if you just want to treat yourself.  I'm glad everyone that has tried it likes it. I'm a feeder (love to feed people), I inherited it from my mom.

My daughter found this recipe and everybody loves it.  I made it using suggestions she found in reviews to use mini chocolate chips, put 1/2 in the batter and sprinkle other 1/2 over top of batter.  When baked and cooled spread chocolate icing (not whipped) over the top.  This is Better than ....Cake!

Moistest cake you'll ever eat.  For those who say the chocolate chips dominate it, try this: instead of 2 cups of standard chips, I use 1.5 cups of MINI chocolate chips.  For me this works much better.  I save a little bit of the dry cake mix and toss them in it before adding to the batter to keep them from sinking to the bottom.  ALSO, I use a standard vanilla glaze (powdered sugar, vanilla, milk)  Its not has heavy as standard frosting and is a nice contrast to the chocolate.

I baked this in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes at 350. I used a funfetti cake mix because it was for my sons 2 year birthday. Everyone loved it and said it was the most moist and delicious cake theyve ever had!

The taste of this cake was wonderful - very rich.  Two complaints:  all of the chocolate chips sank to the bottom of the cake.  Would have preferred chocolate chips in the cake itself.  Also, I made four of these cakes and all four of them sank in the middle...my fault maybe?  But, definitely great tasting!  Since the cake was so rich, would suggest a less sweet frosting.

Yum, yum, and yum!  I am a chocoholic but my husband likes things without chocolate, from time to time.  This satisfied us both.  There was enough chocolate for me to get my "fix" and little enough chocolate for him to enjoy.  Incidentally, I did sprinkle chocolate chips over the icing...I couldn't resist.  :-)

This is the moistest cake I've ever had! After reading the reviews here, I added the chocolate chips to the top of the cake before putting it in the over so they wouldn't sink to the bottom, so the top of my cake was chocolately brown which was fine with me! I made a cream cheese frosting to top it with and that made it even better. Definitely a keeper!
