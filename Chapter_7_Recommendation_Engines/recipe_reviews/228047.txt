This is an outstanding recipe. I followed it exactly, and was extremely pleased with the results. The almonds provide a nice crunch to the finish, and the cherries are allowed to shine. This is a definite keeper!

I have been making fresh fruit pies and cobblers for years but was looking for somrthing a little different so I tried this recipe last night. I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed with the crumb topping.  
It was more salty and less sweet than I would have liked.  If I were to make this again, I would decrease some of the salt in the topping and add more sugar to both the pie filling and the topping as well.  I'd also give a more precise measurement for the lemon juice and only use 1 tbsp.

I changed it but I thought my changes were worth mentioning since I entered it in a cherry crisp contest and won 1st place (out of 12 or so entries). First it was a crisp contest so I omited the crust. Due to no crust I baked it for 55 min, or until the topping was golden. I added a tablespoon of dark cocoa powder to the filling, and used 1.5 teaspoons almond extract in the filling. Then I sprinkled 1 big tablespoon of mini chocolate chips on it right out of the oven. The judge said that while she prefers tart crisps without anything but cherry flavor mine was just that good to get 1st anyway. 2nd, and 3rd were both tart and were delicious. This recipe has the perfect amounts of flour, oats, almonds, and butter and if you are new to crisps or pies you should watch the video.

This was perfect exactly as written. Taste your cherries and add more/less depending on their sweetness or preference. The almond topping was key....delicious. Don't 'pack' it on the pie though, as it will turn into a 'harder' crust than desired. This recipe lets the cherries be showcased without a lot of cinnamon or almond flavoring etc. upstaging them.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe to make. Perfect during the summer when ripe cherries are on sale! The almond crumble is crunchy and is the perfect complement to the soft cherries. I learned a tip from a French baker: if you want to add less sugar to a recipe you can reduce it by 30g without drastically changing the flavor. That's what I did and it was the perfect amount of sweetness since my cherries were already naturally sweet.

I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust with this b/c I had one left over. I used 1/2 the flour and more almonds, 4T of butter and added 1/8t of clove and 1/8t of cinnamon for the crumb. I also added 1/4t of Garam Masala (an Indian spice mixture of coriander seed, black pepper, cumin, cardamom and cinnamon) to the filling for some added spice. Yummy with ice cream or milk!

I loved the almonds in the topping.  They were nice both flavor-wise and for the extra texture they brought to it. I used two bags of frozen dark sweet cherries and liked that it didn't get overly sweet. I think this is my go-to cherry pie now!

Super easy and super delicious.  A girlfriend brought this to work.  Everyone was so impressed , that I had to go home and make it that night.  Lots of flavor for a little bit of work.

I embellished mine just a little. I used pecans in my crumble topping mashed it into the bottom & sides, before adding the cherries of pie crust as well as adding to the top.  I have made this recipe before using almond which was great, the pecans added a whole new excitement to the taste...

AWESOME!!!  I made this for a family BBQ and it was a HUGE hit! I didn't change any of the ingredients but whisked the oats until they were fine, as they made a much crunchier topping and one family member does not care for oats.  She didn't even know.  This dessert is absolutely delicious. If you can get someone to pit the cherries for you, even better!  
Thank you Chef John.  You never disappoint!!!

I substituted the flour and butter with non gluten crust and non dairy for the topping.  I used coconut oil instead of butter - it was delicious!!

I made this today and everyone absolutely loved it! I used Dole frozen cherries and added a dash of cinnamon to the filling and the topping. I also cut back the salt in the topping based on other reviews and increased the brown sugar just a bit. Next time I might cut back the corn starch a little bit, but I am the only one who felt that way! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe - it's a keeper!

I thought I followed the recipe exactly but the pie was runny...what did I do wrong?  I've never made a cherry pie before.  I still tasted good, but I didn't serve it to anybody because I had to eat my piece in a bowl!

I usually do not like cherry pie, but my kids wanted me to make one with the cherries they picked.  I not only liked, but LOVED this cherry pie.  I did not change anything in the recipe.  I'll definitely make this one again!

Everyone loved this. I didn't have enough cherries, so I mixed cherries and a triple berry blend. I watched the YouTube version of Chef John's over and over to get this right. I made this last Thanksgiving.  I am going to do it again this year. Still want to use the berry blend.

Loved the recipe. This was my first pie and it came out awsome. Next time I make it might add a bit more of brown sugar to balance the saltiness of the crumb topping. Otherwhise wont change a thing for now

I made this pie for a 4th of July party. I received more compliments than any other recipe I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly, but added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the filling. It was wonderful!

Made this as a thank you for a neighbor after I found out cherry pie was his favorite.  His wife said they both loved the pie and thought that the topping was amazing and made the pie!  When I offered to make another thank you pie for him in any flavor he wanted, he asked for this one again...must be that good!

This is simply fabulous! The almonds go so well with the cherries, they're perfect together and the whole thing is just sweet enough without being too much. I followed the recipe as is and it turned out exactly as described. I'm definitely keeping this recipe and doing it again.

I made it with 2 packages of frozen/thawed berry/cherry mix and it was loved.  I skimped a  bit on the sugar and butter, but it turned out fine.

We did you-pick bing cherries.  I needed something bigger than a pie plate so I lined a casserole pan with two crusts and put the extra crust over the cherries then layered the crumble over the crust.  Absolutely love this recipe!

Chef John never disappoints. Another amazing recipe. Did it exactly as the recipe lists. I used fresh cherries I had picked that day. The sweetness is perfect. Not too tart. It’s my birthday today so even though it’s for tonights celebration I ruined the presentation and snuck a piece. Totally worth it!

Looks delicious! I had to use frozen cherries but can’t wait to taste the crumb topping!

This pie was wonderful! It was easy to assemble and delicious. I used fresh bing cherries and thanks to my trusty cherry pitter I had a pile ready to go in no time. The topping was tasty, crunchy, and aromatic. The cherries were juicy and flavorful. The pie smelled good. Looked good. Tasted good. I’ll be making it again soon.

This was an amazing pie recipe!!!! I reduced the sugar in both the pie and the crust and added almond extract as suggested by another reviewer and it was fabulous! It was the tiniest bit runny when completely cooled, so I will increase the cornstarch slightly next time so it has better gelling. Delicious!

I only made the crumb topping. It is an excellent topper to gluten-free desserts!  This is an excellent addition to pies, such as apple and cherry, and crisps.

The best cherry pie I've ever had! I love that it's full of fruit and not just sugary pie filling.

Very tasty, but next time I would cut the sugar in the filling by half. Otherwise, we liked it very much!

Delicious and full of flavor! I made the recipe using 2 tbsp less butter (because I didn't have it) and it came out perfectly! Definitely will be making this over and over!

PERFECT.   I altered this a lot so my comments are for me to reflect on another time when I go to make this., my granddaughter wanted a cherry pie,,I had to make quickly.
Sorry, I used a frozen pastry and canned cherry pie filling,
But I did make the topping and it was great. My granddaughter
loved it.

What a wonderful pie!  I haven't baked a pie in a few years but a friend asked for a cherry pie.  I'm really glad I found this recipe - we'll probably have pie more often here.  I followed the recipe except for using frozen cherries instead of fresh.  It did not occur to me until I was cutting it that I should have increased the cornstarch because of the moisture in the frozen cherries.  Therefore, our pieces were not beautiful but they were delicious!  I will make this again and again.  Thank you, Chef John!
