These were yummy and VERY chocolatey...to the person who said they came out flat...it is CRUCIAL that you thoroughly mix any cookie recipe ingredients. Can't stress that enough. You can sift the dry ingredients to be sure those get mixed well and then USE A HAND MIXER when you add in the wet ingredients prior to adding the chips. Don't use the mixer when you add the chips. The cookies should be puffy when they come out of the oven and then flatten as they cool.

After peach ice cream and peach pound cake, hubby wanted something a little more decadent, like something heavy-duty chocolate. This was it! As he was eating one of these cookies I asked him how he liked them--all he could do was nod his head up and down and say, "Mmmmmmmmm." Finally, he told me this was one of the best cookies he had ever eaten. This cookie is everything you'd want it to be--chewy, gooey, chocolatey, pretty, and sinfully good. I, too, added 1/2 tsp. salt, but not for height, as one reviewer suggested, but because salt makes flavors "come alive." This is one great cookie!

A great change from chocolate chip cookies - delicious and very rich and chocolate-y.  I agree that the recipe is a bit confusing.  I had to read it over a few times to understand what I needed to do.  It should say "Combine dry ingredients EXCEPT THE WHITE AND BROWN SUGAR; in separate bowl cream sugars, eggs, butter AND VANILLA EXTRACT."  And once the dry ingredients are sifted into the wet, fold in the chocolate chips.  But well worth the effort to figure it out - Yum!

These cookies were awesome! My husband and I loved them-some of the best I've ever had. I did use salt and a stone cookie sheet. They came out thick and fluffy, soft and chewy. I agree with an earlier review-make sure ingredients are mixed together well, wet and dry separately and when mixing together!I agree the recipe was confusing and should have said, "Mix all dry ingredients except for sugars. Cream sugars, butter, eggs and vanilla in a separate bowl." Again, these cookies were awesome-some of the best I've ever had!

This recipe was easy to put together, and
the taste of the cookies was fabulous.
The only thing I would add would be another 1/4 c. of flour, as these cookies
spread more than I would have liked. I
like a firmer cookie.

as my 19 month old son said when he tried one "MMMMMMM!!!"... these are awesome cookies, moist, chocolatey.  I am pregnant and was craving some double chocolate chip cookies like those grandma's ones you find in the store.  These definitely fit the bill!  I used regular cocoa powder, semi sweet chocolate chips and added an extra tsp of vanilla.  mmmMMM!  These are addictive!  Moist, with just the right amount of chocolate taste!

This recipe is the best one so far. Very moist and easy to make. 8 minutes is the best to be soft and moist.

I saw this recipe this morning and decided to make it as a Valentine's Day treat for my family this afternoon.  They turned out really great.  Not the best cookie I have ever had, but certainly delicious.  I followed earlier reviews and added a  1/2 tsp salt, and also I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder.  They were a hit!

I tried this recipe and got rave reviews from co-workers.friends and family.  The directions are a bit confusing and I added a half teaspoon of salt.  Additionally I used half semisweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chips and instead of drooping by teaspoon I formed the batter into a log, wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated it for an hour, I sliced about half inch slices off and it made prefect cookies.  One more thing I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening, this made a very soft and chewy cookie!

The dierctions should read:
2:  Cream together sugars, eggs, butter, and vanilla.  Gradually add sifted flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking soda.

*If using the log concept,  bake for 9-10 minutes at 350 degrees F.

These were great!  I added some crushed candy canes to the dough (for Christmas) and planned to give them away to neighbors, but my husband kept eating them.

Great cookies, but the recipe I found a little confusing.  Step one says mix together the dry ingredients then step 2 says cream the butter and sugar.  Sugar is a dry ingredient.  Sorry to be picky but if inexperienced cooks are baking, troubles may arise

Wonderful. I just added 1/2 tsp salt and only 1/3 cup cocoa powder. I was afraid it would be a little too rich with all of it. I also used 1/3 cup canola oil abd 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup of butter...like I do in all my recipes. My husband prefers the consistency that this creates better. They are a little softer and puffier.  I also only cook them for 7 minutes at 375 degrees. But over all, they were delicious!!

The most wicked cookies I have ever made.  I didn't have enought butter so I used Crisco Golden shortening.  They turned out awesome.  I did add a dash of salt because most cookie recipes do and I just plum forgot not to.  It didn't kill them.

These cookies were okay, but not great. Too cakey for my liking, and a little on the dry side. I did add some walnuts to them, so there was some interest to them. Probably won't make again.

These cookies are so yummy and chocolatey.  I misread and used baking powder instead of baking soda and they still turned out perfect.  They were done in 10 minutes and I got 48 cookies out of the batch.  I will make these again.

AWESOME!  The only change I made was to melt the butter before I beat in the sugars.  I used the large scoop and baked for 14 minutes.  My son's friend told me "your cookies are the bomb!"

Good. Followed the recipe exactly. Mine didn't spread out much though so you might want to roll the dough in nice smooth balls so the cookies look prettier when they are done.

It doesn't get better than this.  I replaced 1 1/2 cups of the chocolate chips with mint chips but kept 1/4 cup chocolate for the deep chocolate flavor.  It was outstanding.  This is such a great cookie.   I plan to try other chip flavors such as peanut butter or caramel.  Thank you Berit Locatelli for such a great recipe, even the baking time is perfect!!

This is a great cookie with lots of options like dried fruit (especially cherries!), nuts, or different flavored chips.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of almond extract and baked at 375.  Nice and chewy.

SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  These cookies are delicious!  I can't imagine why some cooks either have trouble with this recipe or do not like it.  It makes a great chocolate chocolate chip cookie.  I followed the directions, did not use a mixer as one reviewer suggested, and had no problems at all achieving great results.  This recipe is added to my extensive chocolate collection!

These were ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS cookies!!  I just made them this morning for the teachers for the last day of school and I'm sure they will be a big hit!  I made a few changes; I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of 1, I added a dash of cinnamon (I always do), and I used chocolate chunks instead of chips.  I also dropped them by tablespoons instead of teaspoons.  I do admit the recipe could be confusing if you weren't used to baking.  Mine turned out soooooo good!!  Oooey-Gooey, Chocolately - YUM!!  There were so many chocolate chip cookies recipes to choose from, I definately picked the right one!  Thanks Berit!

Very easy to make, delicious cookie. For flavor I would give it a four star only because it's not the best cookie I've ever had. However, it was still very good and very simple to make. I had no issues with them being fluffy as others stated; using fresher ingredients seems to help sometimes.

I've tried several chocolate cookie recipes, but none of them had the rich chocolate flavor I was looking for...until I tried this recipe.  It's very chocolaty and delicious.  I finally found a keeper!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These cookies are FANTASTIC! I saw comments stating salt was added to their recipes and I agree it will help. I must remember to add that to my printout of the recipe. Something I added to my recipe was 1/4 to 1/3 cup Miracle Whip. It has a slight zip added to the recipe but mostly I found it helps them stay moist longer. Try it out! You won't be disappointed at all!

Wonderful! I have the last batch in the oven right now. Husband isn't a cookie man but liked these. He said they had a bit of a dark chocolate taste to them.

Amazing amazing cookies. I followed the ingrediants to a tee but did cook them for an extra 2-3 mintues. Great crunch but still a tad chewy on the inside. Definitly in my Top 3 cookies recipies!

Definately double the recipe for these, especially if they are intended for a friend.  That way you wont feel bad when you realize you've eaten more than half of them!  They look beautiful- perfectly round and soft, and taste like a chocolate dream!

Wow! I love these cookies! I under baked them slightly so they came out gooey and stayed moist.  Also, I always add 2-3 tablespoons of molasses to my cookies for a fuller, richer taste.

I love these cookies. I doubled the batch and froze half the batter wrapped in wax paper and in a zip lock. Didn't stay frozen for long because my family ate them all up. Trying the recipe today with chocolate and butterscotch chips. YUMMY!

This is a great chocolately cookie. I've made them several times and last time used bakers chocolate to melt and mix in. It's not quite as sweet and goes excellent with coffee. I like to refrigerate the dough before baking.

These were really good; I did change the sugars a bit, using a cup of brown sugar, and half cup of white (personal preference, I find that more brown results in a softer, chewier cookie). I made with regular semi-sweet chips, but I bet they would have been to die for with a mint chip or junior mint pieces! Gonna try that next time. Thanks so much - a chocolate choc chip cookie recipe is hard to find (a good one anyways!)

Delicious for chocolate lovers! I found the reviewers' comments about the mixing steps helpful and I also added 1/2 tsp salt. I had to mix by hand (don't own a mixer), and found it to be very difficult. It was all worth it. These were very delicious. Next time I make them, I'm including macadamia nuts!

OMG! These are on my list for TOP 5 cookie recipes. I make them almost every other month.  They come out perfectly everytime I make them. Be sure to read the instructions carefully before you start, just a little confusing and could have been organized/edited better... but still a great cookie!

Loved them!  I added a little extra salt as well, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I baked them for about 8-9 minutes and then let them cool and firm up on the baking sheets.  Chewy, gooey chocolate cookies that will definately be in my regular lineup!

These have replaced my regular chocolate chip cookie... who doesn't want double chocolate?! These are a cross between a brownie & a cookie. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil, and added 1 cup whole pecans. They were wonderful!

These are delicious, I love the texture.  They're a bit too sweet for my taste, but I baked them for hubby, not for me, and he loves them. :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Cookie perfection!! Super chocolatey and great texture and they look beautiful! I don't think I'll ever make regular chocolate chip cookies again, because of this recipe. I made half the recipe as given, and exchanged the choc chips for white chocolate in the other half. Both were delicious. EDIT: I made these again, and I fancy they're not QUITE as good. I think it's because I used unsalted butter this time. So make sure you use salted butter or add a little salt to the recipe.

Adding a touch of peanut butter to these also makes them something else. Try to swirl the peanut butter and not completely incorporate it for a nice effect. I made it to taste, but if I were to follow the recipe, i'd add about 1/8 of a cup.

These cookies were nice and chewy with great flavour! I substituted half of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour and they turned out beautifully. I will definitely make these again and again and again.... Thanks for sharing!

Delicious chocolatey cookie!  It's very much like a brownie, which suited us JUST fine!  Satisfyingly rich & moist with tons of chocolate for my sweet tooth.  I used half whole wheat flour & half a-p flour & it worked out great!  I also threw in a handful of chopped pecans to use them up & we liked that addition.  We love these cookies!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  :)

My daughter (age 9) wanted to make some really good cookies and we came across this recipe.  Now, she's making cookies for everyone!  Everytime she makes these cookies people ask for more.  Very delicious and very easy.  The only thing we changed is using dark chocolate chips.

Amazing recipe!  I would give these 10 stars if I could!  Yes, the recipe is a bit confusing, but they were worth it.  I used 1 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, I will probably do half and half next time.  I also added chopped walnuts.  They were chocolate-y without being too sweet. I made them to take to a friends house and they were devoured very quickly.  These will definitely be my go-to cookies from now on!  Thanks for sharing.

Great taste for an all chocolate cookie.  I used white chocolate chips because I like the look and used an ice cream scoop to make them BIG.  I rolled them in a ball and flattened to half the height of the ball and baked them for 17 minutes.  They were a little crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  It's a keeper.

I love the end result but if someone was a novice these directions would be very confusing, not all people know that sugars are considered a wet ingredient not a dry.

I altered the recipe slightly to appeal to my father-in-laws taste by omitting the vanilla and adding 1Tbl of espresso (1 Tbsp boiling water and 3tsp of espresso instant crystals) and I found it made the flavor explode, I also decreased the chips to 1c and added 1c of toasted macadamia.  He LOVED them.

Loved this recipe!  Tried it today and it's hard to stop eating these cookies!  My husband and daughter wanted to keep eating the dough. I also added butterscotch chips along with the chocolate chips and it turned out really, really good.  Thanks for the recipe!  I have a feeling that I'll be making more batches before Christmas is done.

Delicious...and my mom the chocoholic, loved them.  She thought they might also be good with peanut butter chips.  I did take one of the other posts advise and added 1/2 tsp of salt.  I underbaked them (about 10 minutes) because I like them soft and chewy.  DELICIOUS!!!
Do make sure to mix "Dry" (flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt) and cream "Wet" (sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, butter, and eggs) Combine the dry into the wet and when well mixed then add chocolate chips.

Scrumptious...a must add to my collection of cookie recipes! I followed the recipe exactly minus that I used white chips instead of chocolate. Th cookie was crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. It wasn't cake like. They weren't super puffy or super flat. It was excellent!

Just made these and only put in 1/2 cup chocolate chips and added 3/4 cup of the Andes peppermint chips. I also pressed some of the pepermint chips on top once the cookie dough was on the sheet.  Delicious and festive looking.  Great cookies!

Yummy!  No substitutions and they were great!  I don't know how they fair the next day because I limit myself to a few cookies and freeze the rest of the dough in balls.  I pop them in the oven frozen for fresher cookies.

Wonderful recipe!I used milk chocolate chips, since that's what I had on hand. They turned out a little rich and sweet for my taste, so I'd stick to using semi-sweet chocolate chips. My family is devouring them though. I also added a half teaspoon of salt, and I didn't add any nuts, I don't care for nuts, and they worked out great. This recipe is a keeper.

Honey thinks chocolate and coffee should be a 'food group' so I halved the cocoa powder and added instant coffee granules.  Well he's on cloud 9 and also staying up rather late these days!  Thanks for a really great recipe!!!

Another 5 star review! My sisters inhaled these cookies. I made 48 and they only lasted 3 few days!
I wasn't sure how much they would spread so i left a lot of space in between my first batch. i didn't need to. Only leave an inch or a bit more in between to fit as many as you can on a cookie sheet.

omg... the cookies was delicious!! I mean it was the second time I tried to make cookies and they end up being so tastful!! My sis loved them.I must say that I've used 2-3 teaspoons of fresh milk and I mixed it with baking soda ~my mum told me that it tastes better if u put baking soda into sth liquid~. They were great especially right after I took them out of the oven they where soo shoft inside & crispy outside that I though it was the better thing I've even made myself..
thnx lots for the recipe!!!

My niece has made these several times. Last Sunday my daughter came home from her house and demanded I ring her to get the recipe. I made these during the week and wasn't disappointed. A very nice chewy cookie and my daughter said they were just as good as her cousin's. Many Thanks.

This is my new favorite cookie!  It's really basic, but perfect.  However, I have to say that I was less than exacting with the ingredient measurements, so I hope I can reproduce it.  I live at high altitude so I usually fudge ingredients like flour (I added a bit more).  Another review commented about adding salt, which I also did.  Also, I have frozen, thawed and baked the batter with perfect results.  Yum!

This is the best chocolate cookie dough recipe I've ever made. Just the right amount of cocoa powder!! I substituted Andes peppermint chips for the chocolate chips.  WOW!  I have received so many compliments!  And your house smells like a peppermint patti while they're baking ;-)
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good cookie!  I don't care for cake-like chocolate cookies, and these were soft and chewy.  I don't think it was chocolate overkill, either!

These are really good!
I did not use a full two cups of chocolate chips, just threw in handfuls until it looked right . . . also added a handful of white chocolate chips just to make things interesting!
I used stoneware to bake these- now, stoneware recommends adding five minutes to your baking time so that the pans can heat up.  I always add the time, and my cookies are NEVER soft! So with these ones I just cooked them for 11 minutes, TOTAL, and they are perfect!!! They have even stayed soft, and it's been two days! (Not that there are many left!) I highly recommend this easy recipe for anyone who needs a great, not too chocolate-ly chocolate cookie!! Just don't overbake.

VERY DISAPPOINTING.  The cookies would not rise.  When the cookies were taken out of the oven, they were completly flat.  I followed the directions to the t.  If someone has information as to what may have happened more than happy to listen.  The batter appears to be too smooth.

These are perfect. I was a little concerned when I saw that there was no salt in the recipe, but it really doesn't need it if you use salted butter. DO NOT USE UNSALTED BUTTER BY MISTAKE! They are rich and choclately and the texture is just perfect (chewy and soft yet not gooey and not flat). They freeze well too!

Yummy!  These had the perfect amount of chocolate and were the perfect "cookie" consistency--chewy and not too cakelike!  If you love chocolate you must try these!  Santa requested a chocolate chocolate chip cookie and he was a happy camper on Christmas Eve.

I made a double batch for Christmas, and they turned out great - almost like brownies.  I normally don't like cakey cookies, but these are awesome!  They are really rich though.  You could get a toothache just smelling them!

Love this recipe!  I read the comments and liked the one about adding mint extract to make it taste like a Girl Scout Thin Mint.  I added 1 tsp spearmint extract and used Nestle Dark Chocolate and Mint Morsels, for a double shot of mint flavor.  I baked some as drop cookies and some in a mini-muffin tin.  I will make this again.

These cookies are SOOOOOOO good!!!  I followed the advice of some of the reviewers who said to mix everything extremely well with a hand mixer.  They turned out so moist and chewy, and not flat at all!  This will definitely be a standard recipe for me!

I loved the chocolate flavor of these cookies, so rich and yummy! I used Penzeys Dutch Processed High Fat Cocoa and added walnut to the last 1/2 of dough.  I like them with or without the walnuts!

This recipe was simply delicious!  I took the suggestion of other reader's and added salt.  Only a 1/4 teaspoon which enhanced the flavour.  I also added white chocolate chips which gave a nice look to the cookie!  Will definitely make again!

I made these just as directed but with a pinch of salt. They were flat and a little too crumbly but tasted good. I think mine needed some more flour or something.

SUCH A GOOD COOKIE! I didn't do anything different and these cookies came out chewy and rich and oh so yummy! I will be making these again and again and am going to play around with the kinds of chips to see if I can make them even better.

Oh yeah, these will satisfy my chocolate craving.  Not only do these have that deep rich chocolate color that makes you want to dig right in (I hate it when you bake a chocolate cookie and they are a blah brown),  they also taste nice and chocolaty.   I made half the recipe which yielded 26 cookies.   So, if you are a chocoholic who loves a sweet cookie, you may want to try this recipe.

I would give this 5 stars but I made a couple of changes. This is a really good cookie.   I substituted the sugar with  1 cup of brown and 1/2 cup of white.  Doing this makes a softer cookie.  I also substituted 1 cup of wheat for 1 cup of white flour.  They turned out wonderful! Today is day two and they are as soft as they were yesterday.

I drizzled the top with a melted almond bark recipe. The almond bark recipe is where I melted the almond bark in a double boiler, then I turned it on simmer and added mind extract. I then drizzled this concoction over the cookies. Minty, chocolatey, and delicious!

I think they could do with a little more sweetness or chocolately flavour, also some salt.  Other than that they are pretty good, moist and chewy. Kids couldn't believe they were homemade--thought I bought them somewhere!

With an average size cookie this makes 1 1/2 dozen.  Delicious cookies, could be a tad sweeter, next time I'll add a bit more brown sugar.

This is by far one of the best recipes to make. It has the right ingredients and directions. I will say that you better take your time with this because there are a lot of steps here you need to take. I recommend having a partner for this one so that one of you will mix half of the ingredients to save time. Overall, the outcome is very delicious.

Amazing recipe. I don't normally make an all chocolate cookie, but my kids were saying they really wanted some....so I folded. I made this recipe to a T, the only thing that gave me irriation was my OVEN! For some reason it took longer to bake in it today then ever. So as I was making other cookies with this recipe I had to slow bake them....which really didn't hender anything at all. The cookies were super soft with a little bit of a soft crisp edges and soft moist cookies in the center. You need a good size glass of milk with these babies. Will make again. Thanks!

A tablespoon or two of ground cinnamon and a couple teaspoons of cayenne pepper powder make this a 5-star recipe.

We do not eat eggs in our family so I substituted 1 TBSP of plain / greek style yoghurt per egg and the recipe came out perfect.  The cookies are mosit, like we like them.  Good flavour. It has taken me a few months to bring myself to write this review.  I wated to ensure that the substitution was a workable one.  I highly recommend this recipe especially if you are a fan of chocolate !  Good Luck !!

these cookies were amazing! so chocolaty and awesome with a glass of milk.  i used half butter and half shortening and they turned out great!  i also mixed it with a wooden spoon instead of a mixer. A wonderful cookie i plan on making again!

My daughter made these and I thought they tasted just like  Nestle Toll House and sure enough, the recipe is about exact.  Great Recipe.  Also great with peanut butter chips.

This recipe is so awesome!!! One note for sure, CHILL YOUR DOUGH for at least half an hour before you bake!  The difference is unbelievable!!  I swapped out the chip all the time... our current fave is milk chocolate, white chocolate and replacing the vanilla with peppermint extract!  THEY ARE PERFECT EVERY TIME... the dough also freezes well if you cant bake all at once!!

AWESOME! For "Pi Day", my math class was having a little celebration. We had to bring some thing that 34 kids could have and circular. I made these and they were a hit! They turned out very fluffy but a little dry. Because our oven is about 19 years old, I reduced the temperature to about 325 degrees and baked them for 8 minutes. I had a blast making these and the results were great!

Awesome recipe...but I did tweak a little.  I only have one cup of the mini chocolate chips, so I used that.  I was worried that the chips would be noticeably short, so I added 1/2 a packet of chocolate jello instant pudding mix (the 5.9oz size) to my wet ingredients...Oh me, oh my, delish!  Moist, chewy and soft!   On a side note, I didn't have trouble with the order of the directions, as I don't even read directions on cookies anymore, it all pretty much goes the same way, wet ingredients: butter, sugars, eggs, vanilla, (and in my case, pudding mix) creamed together, then your dry ingredients(flour, leavening, chocolate powder) added in. I can see where the directions would be misleading though.

These cookies was really good! I'm only giving it 4 stars because, for some reason, I felt they were lacking something.  I'm not sure if it was sugar or what. I didn't have cocoa powder, so I substituted hot coco mix. Maybe that had something to do with it. Next time, I will follow the recipe exactly and see what happens! But pretty good overall. Thanks!!!

Delightful cookies!  I used white chocolate chips and added a 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.  They came out perfectly puffy and chewy.  It's great to join as a supporting All Recipes member because you can customize the recipes.   Since the original directions are confusing, I rearranged the ingredients in the correct order - first, cream the butter and sugars with the vanilla.  Add eggs and mix well.   Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl.  Slowly add the flour to the butter/sugar mixture while mixing.  The final step is folding in the chips.  These are delicious cookies you will be proud to serve!

Loved em! I did change a few things to try and make them a little healthier...like cookies can be healthy! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour, replaced the white sugar with Splenda, used 1 cup chocolate chips instead of 2 and replaced the butter for soft tofu. They were a little spongy, but the taste was excellent and just what I needed to fulfill my sweets obsession.

My kids loved these cookies! They thought they were the best they ever tasted.  For me, they were better the following day.  Not the best but definitely very good!  I added walnuts to half of the dough for my enjoyment.

These were EXCELLENT!!! I didn't use quite as many chocolate chips as the recipe said, I found it was a bit much - but other than that, followed the recipe to a tee and they were great, everyone loved em! Will definitely make this again! I agree with everyone who said make sure the ingredients are mixed thoroughly, that is the key. Yum yum! Thanks for sharing!

Good Cookie I just need to tweek it so that I get the proper spread I like, with the crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  It's a keeper but I will personally tweek it for my preference.

I thought these were delicious cookies!  The batter was even better though! :)  They baked up beautifully and stayed soft and chewy!  I added 1/2 tsp of salt as others recommended.  I will gladly make these again and more than likely serve them with vanilla ice cream or a big glass of milk!

When i saw the comment someone posted about using a hand mixer and making sure the ingredients were mixed very thoroughly, i cringed. Please, please don't over-mix! It's so easy in cookies especially, the glucose in the flour breaks down and the quality of the cookie goes down so much. Anyway, these cookies were great. I used wheat flour and they turned out fabulous.

ok like the other reviews, i added a quarter teaspoon of salt and they came out great.  i have to explain that i have upon me a baking jinx. whenever i bake something for the first time, they come out perfect, but subsequently rhe recipe flops.  but i've made these cookies nearly ten times and they come out perfect every single time. i've tried them with walnuts, sunflower seeds, pecans and just plain. perfect every single time.  the jar empties within a day.  *edit*  i've tried these with hazelnuts. the best so far!

Chocolate heaven!! Used 1C WW flour, and decreased sugars to 1/2 C each, just as a personal preference. Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside!!

These were incredibly soft and chewy.  All the kids loved them and my husband gobbled them up.  This recipe is a keeper!
*UPDATE:  These are my favorite cookies but I tweak them.  I omit the vanilla and use mint extract instead.  Instead of milk chocolate chips I use mint ones or a bag of Andes baking chips.  These are AMAZING!

This is a very solid recipe but a little sweet for my taste. I adjusted it to take a slightly more healthy approach but not sacrifice the cookie taste; 1C WW flour, 1C AP flour, 3/4C butter, and only 1C brown sugar (instead of 1 1/2C combine) As for cooking these cookies I refrigerated the dough for 15 min to firm it up a bit, the dough at that point was easy to scoop and didn't spread much so you can feel free to fill the pan without worry and form them as you like. Also, peanut butter chips, white chocolate, any style of nuts, and cherry chips go great with this recipe.

This recipe was wonderful!! Instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips I put 1 cup of semi-chocolate chips and 1 cup Reese's pieces. My husband loved them!

These were wonderful. I was looking for something more than the usual chocolate chip cookie and this was even better than I expected. I added 1 cup of chopped pecans and that made them perfect!

This recipe is incredibly easy to make, you just can't go wrong. And the taste is delicious also! I'm not the best at baking, so if I could ace this recipe, anyone can!

I loved these cookies! Their simple to make. I found that 9-12 Minutes wasn't enough so I baked it for 15 Minutes instead. My family enjoyed eating them.

These cookies are SOOOOO GOOD that I think I should probably never make them again for fear that I might eat the entire batch. Don't get bent out of shape over the directions...just use cookie baking common sense. The only two major changes I made would be to add 1/2 tsp salt and I used the striped white chocolate/semi-sweet chips in one batch and mint chips in another. Wow! Thanks for this amazing recipe! It even beat out my mother-in-laws choc choc chip cookie recipe that was my husbands favorite--he said to toss hers and replace it with this.

I used only a cup and half of butter and these still turned out great! Definitely not healthy cookies at all but next time I will half the flour with wheat flour as well as keep the reduced butter. They were very good, moist cookies and my boyfriend is enjoying them immensely!

Deliciously moist cookie.  I halved the butter (to make them low fat), doubled the vanilla, and they still turned out very moist.  To make them just a touch better, I made some vanilla icing to spread over the lot of them.  Very good cookie.

These cookies are the best ever.  I make them for any and all functions.  Only changes - I grease the cookie sheet - otherwise they stick.  And use heaping spoon of backing soda - otherwise they don't rise.

I thought that these cookies were delicious! I thought however, that you didn't need as much chocolate chips. I only used half a cup and it was still great. I also used half peanut butter chips and half chocolate.

This was AMAZING! Everyone was raving about them. They had a really good dark chocolate flavor.  We used white chocolate chips, milk and semi-sweet plus some walnuts which made it super yummy.  Definately a keeper! Plus we made this in mass(200 cookies) and it still turned out perfect.

I made these cookies following the recipe exactly and they were AWESOME! My husband and I both loved them. I gave some to family and friends and they all said they were so good that they should be packaged! One of my friends said they were just like the cookies in the mall...good stuff! We will make again, actually, we're making again this weekend for the Superbowl!

While these cookies taste DELICIOUS, they come out extremely flat and gooey.  I followed the recipe exactly, which the exception of using Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder and Hershey's Raspberry chocolate chips.  They bake up nice and fluffy in the oven but when cooled turn f-l-a-t.  I probably won't make these again unless they're just for myself - they certainly aren't very presentable for guests, etc.

Great cookie!  I used my mixer(a  whole way through  (a Kitchen Aid....it's a sticky dough. I don't have the arm strength to hand mix!) and added a pinch of salt.  They don't spread and so I could place them close together on the tray.

These were quite tasty and easy to make, will make again. My 10-year-old thought they were a little too chocolatey but the rest of the family approved. They stay soft and moist, I added a touch of salt when I noticed the recipe did not call for it. Baked them in a convection oven on an insulated cookie sheet… Perfect shape and texture!

These turned out amazing! I obviously creamed the butter and sugars before I added the eggs, vanilla, and flours. Plus I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt per reviews. I'm a pretty experienced cookie baker and my family raved that these are the best! Great recipe!

Oh my goodness!!This recipe is fabulous. As per advice of another review, I also added a 1/2 tsp of salt to enhance the sweetness. We always love to find a great base for cookie dough and then add our own favorites to the batter. This recipe nailed It!!! I had no problem following the instructions. Another idea for add-ons: trail mix of almost any kind. Enjoy!!

I like it better than a regular Chocolate Chip Cookie.  I only added 1/3 cup of Cocoa Powder and added 1/2 tsp. of Cinnamon.   They are really good!!

These are basically tollhouse recipe with the addition of cocoa powder, so I upped the flour a bit as I do to tollhouse to make them thicker and chewier.  They were wonderful!

Awesome cookie! I did a quadruple recipe for my sons game. Used half baking soda/half baking powder. Substatuted white chocolate chips for the regular ones and added 3 bags of toffee chips. They were loved. I even had a parent call me after the game and ask me what I would charge her for a batch of her own. :D

This recipe was amazing! I did not find the instructions too hard, and even if I misread it, the cookies turned out great! I made them for my sisters play, and I'm sure they will be gobbled up in seconds! Easy on the eyes, and even easier to eat.

Well, the first batch out of the oven is still warm, and I just finished off my 4th cookie.  I would say they're quite delicious, and I'm going to head to the fridge for some milk now. Easy to make.  Nothing went wrong.  They didn't flatten out like the picture I see there....but that's not a problem with me!  Might try adding some nuts next time.  Yummy!!!

Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Made this exactly as the recipe called for, but used half white chocolate chips, half semisweet! 
The last batch is about to come out of the oven and I already have people claiming the last cookies!
Oh, and the baking time really depends on how big your cookies are, I started off with tablespoons and they cooked for 10 minutes, then I switched to a melon baller and those cooked for 12 minutes

These seriously taste like brownies :)  They are very rich cookies.  I didn't have butter on hand so I used margarine and they turned out great!  Only issue I had was trying to figure out when they were done since they are brown.  10 minutes was just right for me.

very good cookie recipe. I have made it twice in the past week. I reduced the butter by 1/2 and used a 1/2 cup of applesauce to help reduce the fat (you won't notice the taste difference at all, but they will dry out a little quicker...not that it should be an issue since these cookies are gobbled up quickly!).

Pretty great recipe! I made them for my son to bring to school, he's in Jr hih has a long day and is leaving them in his locker to snack on. I added decaf instant coffee to help bring out chocolate flavor a bit and substituted brown sugar for white(I ran out of brown)...I'm just wondering how to make a cookie not look so flat and a bit more moist...and suggestions?!?!

The cookies definitly need time to rest. If you leave them out overnight, they have a much better taste. They are great either way though!

These cookies are delicious! I did make one small change by adding 1/2 tsp salt. They didn't end up like the picture...they look more like the Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cake Cookies recipe also on this site, and it may have been the salt that did it. The other recipe doesn't have brown sugar though, so I would imagine that mine tasted a lot closer to this recipe. I will say that mine came out more like a brownie than a cookie...crisp on the outside but moist and chewy on the inside. Fortunately, that's exactly how I like my cookies. I will definitely be making them again!

I was really hopeful that this cookie would be delicious based upon the reviews, but I didn't enjoy it at all. My kids did seem to like them, at first, but they definitely didn't gobble them all up. I've thrown a dozen in the trash just this morning.

Delish! I ended up adding a bit more cocoa powder and a pinch of salt to ours which I think was a nice addition, although I've never tasted them without, so maybe it isn't as great as I think it is :) I also added some dried cherries along with my chips - Yum!

AWESOME! These were really good. I think they also got better after I put them in the fridge and tried them the next day. I did an experiment with these and added Jello pudding cheesecake mix and they were sooo good. I'm sure any of the other flavors would be just as good. Can't wait to make again.. Thank You!!

I used this reciped and adapted it to make it gluten free... just switched out the flour, to all purpose gluten free flour. Recipe made nice thin crispy cookies, but were kind of bland. Also I wish they weren't so thin. Don't know if that is the recipe or the gf flour doing it. But still a yummy cookie. I only baked them for 10minutes :)

I used mint chips instead of chocolate since these were for a Christmas party and they were wonderful - fudgy but still with crisp edges. Definitely will be making these again!

This is one of my all time favorite cookie recipes! I have been making them for two years, and they are constantly requested. In fact, I always double the recipe, as they disappear too quickly! My favorite version (proportions are for doubled recipe) is with one bag of butterscotch, one of semi sweet and at least a cup of pecans.  In place of 2 cups of butter (again, this is doubled), I do a cup of canola oil, and 3/4 cup of applesauce. With the removal of butter, I add 1 1/2 -2 tsp of salt.  If you are careful to mix wet and dry separately, and add as instructed, they will turn out amazing! Thank you SO MUCH for submitting this recipe!

These are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, even the cooking times were accurate. I made these yesterday,  and they are such a hit that I only have a few left! The single batch made 56 cookies. Yum!

These were amazingly moist and delicious! I made them exact with one substitution. I had Mint chocolate chips and they worked out great! In the second batch I added Macadamia nuts and again... you can't wrong!! I cooked mine for 10 minutes on parchment lined baking sheets and they were the Bomb!  Moist and chewy! Will make these again and again!

Fantastic cookies! I didn't read the about how to combine the ingredients - just kind of threw it all together. And I found that I didn't have any chocolate chips in the end. It didn't matter! These are the best chocolate cookies. I will makes these again....and again.....and again

All I can say is,"Make these cookies"! I'm trying to keep from eating both the batter and the freshly baked cookies. Due to my pantry limitations I had to sub shortening for butter; improvised for a lack of vanilla by using Hiram Walker amaretto/cognac liquer; used  Ghirardelli sixty percent bittersweet chips for semisweet; and added Heath toffee bits. Baked for ten minutes and now have a nice and moist super chocolatey cookie. Now I have a "go to" recipe that will lend itself to all kinds of variations!

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I add 1/2 tsp. of salt, as suggested by others, and it really does bring out the flavors. Cooking for 10 minutes results in a more cake-like cookie, so I prefer 8 minutes to keep them a little more moist.

If what you are looking for is Chocolately goodness! You definatly will find it here! I added marshmellows in the middle of the cookies which made it a little more fun!   All you have to do it take half the dough you are doing to use for the cooking.... take 4-5 mini marshmellows put them in the middle of dough, and then add the other half and roll it into a ball!

Delicious!  I used white chocolate chips and they turned out great.  I also substituted oil for half of the butter to make it a little more healthy :) The cookies are very crispy, just the way I like them with a glass of milk.

These cookies were great! I made these multiple times over the holidays with mint chocolate chips instead of the semisweet chocolate chips and they were amazing! The dough is great to use with toffee bits, butterscotch chips or even to stick a Reese's in the middle. It has endless possibilities. Do not over cook them though!

I made them - and they were perfect.  I would suggest them cooling for a bit before you try to move them. And if you like them extra chewy - my mom taught me the "slap" method where you smack them on the cooking tray before taking them out and it helps to condense the cookies and make them nice and chewy instead of "fluffy"

First let me say that I am NOT a chocolate fan...with that being said, these are the most decadent chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted! As a personal preference I substituted milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet and added salt to the recipe. They were sweet, fudgy chocolaty goodness! These were perfect!

These cookies are spectacular. I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of butter flavored crisco as someone had previously suggested-perfect. I made extra large cookies- about a palmful of dough, 6 cookies per sheet. I flattened them slightly on parchment lined cookie sheets- baked in a 300 degree oven (yes 300 degrees) for about 15 minutes. I then let them cool on the sheets for 20 minutes- this is the key to finish cooking the middle. Absolutely fantastic.

The whole family loved these!  I had no problems with them at all.  Semisweet is the perfect chocolate chip in these.

The Cookie is 5 STARS!  The directions are NOT!  Cream your eggs and sugar first, then combine dry ingredients in a separate bowl.  AND. . . salt is needed.  It helped with flavor.  Great flavor!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

My 12 year old son made these. They were great, soft & chewy. We had mini baking peppermint paties that he used instead of choco chips.

made these yesterday and they tasted good. few problems my cookies were a bit bigger than they were supposed to be and they ended up tasting doughy/floury. although i was a bit confused on the mixing and all the ingredients mixed odd. also they are falling apart! but overall good recipe.   Questions! Is the batter supposed to be thick or gooey like brownie batter?  If you add 1 cup white chocolate and 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips would they be like triple chocolate cookies or would they taste odd?

These are certainly soft and chocolaty but even after adding 1/2 tsp of salt I still felt that there was some flavor missing. I think if I try them again I'll add almost a full tsp of salt.

These are the best! Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. I substituted margarine for butter and I thought one cup of chocolate chips was enough. Can't wait to make them again.

I made several revisions to this recipe based on what I had on hand, and they turned out great! I used a combination of white and milk chocolate (some chips, some chunks) and a little white chocolate chip/macadamia nut combo that I had left over. I think I'll continue with the white/milk chocolate theme next time. We loved these cookies.

Sorry, I didn't think these were that good, just ok.  The cookie dough was not chocolatey enough and they were missing something, salt, no salt? Mine turned out a little dry, also. The recipe was hard to follow(not in correct order, was afraid I would miss something).

very good.  For the sugar I used half brown and half white as others suggested.  I cooked for 8 minutes, which seemed a little too gooey that night - of course we couldn't wait for them to cool long.  They are soft and chewy, perfect the second day.  I had 1C mint chips so I made half with mint chips and I did a few with just chocolate chips and the rest with chocolate and buttersotch chips.  They were all really good!

Usually when I see a recipe on here that gets good reviews, I'm skeptical because sometimes I think some people are very easy to please.  However, this recipe really is fantastic.  I definitely love chocolate and pulled up the site to find a quick cookie recipe.  I made this perfectly after tossing out the first mix of ingredients because I didn't read other reviews and didn't read the recipe correctly.  It is almost impossible to cream butter, sugar, and flour at the same time.  What a waste of ingredients.  I will keep this recipe on hand from now on.  Awesome!

Double Chocolaty Goodness,  Just finished three batches and my husband said they were the best chocolate chip cookies ever. I used 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chip morsels and 2 cups of milk chocolate chip morsels...Thank you for satisfying our sweet tooth, can't wait for the kids to enjoy.

Substitutions: - I used 1/2c. margarine and 1/2c. butter-flavored Crisco instead of the 1c. butter.  - I upped the baking soda to 1 1/2t.  - I added 1/2t. salt - I also used 1 pkg of York mini peppermint patty baking pieces instead of the chocolate chips. Mixing Instructions: Cream together margarine, Crisco, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Add eggs and beat until light and fluffy. Sift together dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture and stir until well blended. Stir in York peppermint patty baking pieces. Bake at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes on a pre-heated Pampered Chef baking stone. Take baking stone out of the oven and let cookies sit for two minutes before removing them from the stone and transferring them to a cooling rack. Using a size 50 scoop yields 4 1/2 doz. cookies that are slightly crisp on the outside, chewy in the middle, and taste like Girl Scout Thin Mints. Mmmm. Delicious!

Delicious and so easy!  I loved this recipe after hearing a friend of mine mention how much she loved it.  I find that sometimes milk chocolates in chocolate is a bit much for me.  I like using different types of chocolate chips...my husband and I agree that substituting with white chocolate makes this recipe even better.

Very delicious cookie. This cookie is very cake-like but none the less fantastic. I also added 1/2 tsp salt and baked for 9 min and they came out thick and fluffy. Yes the directions are vague but read the reviews and you will figure it out

Really delicious!  I read the instructions wrong and just mixed everything together, I didn't have cocoa powder so added an extra half cup of flour and I had two 'helpers' who were eating the mix and sending dolops everywhere and they still came out great.  Thats how you know you found a good recipe, idiot proof!

mmmhhhhhhmm, very good.  The dough was very stiff, but the cookies turned out just right.  I used 1/4 cup extra cocoa and no chips.  Almond slices for garnish.

Awesome cookies... Tasted soooo good.  I spooned out about 2 tsp. and baked 12 minutes and they were perfectly done with a chewy inside!  I used 1 1/2 tsp baking soda only because mine was getting old and I didn't want them to go flat!  Thanks for this great recipe!!!

DE-licious! I used Andes Mint Chips. Mine came out flat and I love thick cake like cookies. I added some salt, maybe not enough. Does anyone have suggestions for making them thicker? More flour? Aside from that I loved them.

Very good cookies! I added walnuts the batter, gives it a nice taste to all the sweetness of the chocolate. Husband loves them. I did add the 1/2tsp of salt someone suggested.Really mixed the dry ingredients together well. The cookies came out great!! Will definitely make them again.

Regarding the quantity: I made this recipe according to the directions (except adding 1/2 t. salt) and, using a medium cookie scoop (1.5" diameter), it produced 47 cookies.  It is a chocolatey, yummy, brownie-like cookie and my new favorite!

These were really, really good!  I used Butter-Flavor Crisco (adding 6 tbsp. of milk) instead of butter.  The recipe is very similar to the chocolate chip recipe found on the inside label of the Crisco sticks.  It is my absolute favorite cookie recipe, so I had to give these a try to satisfy the chocoholic in me.  I creamed the shortening and sugars, then added the eggs and vanilla, then added the blended dry ingredients, and finally the chocolate chips.  They were yummy!  The only changes I might make the next time I make these (and there will definitely be a next time!) is to add a little more sugar and a little less baking soda.  These are both personal preferences - it's not like these aren't sweet!  My sweet tooth is an over-achiever, it's not your normal sweet tooth.  The cookies I normally make have another 3/4 cup of sugar in them, so that is what I am used to, and I would like these cookies to be a little sweeter.  I didn't even consider that adjustment until the day after I made them when I noticed they weren't as sweet as my regular recipe.  Straight out of the oven these were AWESOME!  So, next time I will try 1/8 cup more of both the brown and white sugars and decrease the baking soda a tad because I like my cookies a little more dense.  Again, these are both personal preferences, and I think this recipe is wonderful as is.  Definitely deserving of a 5 star rating!

These are soooooo yummy. At first I was skeptical of the reviewers saying things like 'best cookie I have ever eaten,' but it's REALLY TRUE! These are so soft and gooey and chocolately. :)

Awesome cookies! A great basic recipe for whatever you're in the mood for: nuts, white or milk chocolate chips, Reese's chips, etc... I doubled the recipe and didn't have a lb. of butter so used 1 c. butter & 1 c. Crisco.

these turned out wonderful and were easy to make. Altitude, weather/climate have a lot to do with how much flour is needed. I made them as described -= used mini chocolate chips - low altitude & cool and snowy day --- the dough was not firm enough to roll into balls -- I dropped by spoonfuls instead (pampered chef cookie scoop) and baked for 15 minutes on a baking stone and my boys loved them - they were soft and chewy and very chocolatety. 5 stars will make again..may try with different types of chips and may add mint extract next time for a minty chocolate cookie..

These cookies turned out decent, but I do think the recipe needs a little tweaking.  Try making them with these alterations:
1 3/4 cup flour, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2/3 cups cocoa powder, 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, 3/4 cups chopped macadamia nuts, 2/3 cups flaked coconut; all other ingredients stay the same.
1.mix the flour, baking soda, salt,cocoa powder, chopped nuts, and coconut together and set aside.
2.mix the sugars together well, then cream in the butter.  then add the eggs and vanilla and mix well.
3.gently blend the dry into the wet, about 1/3 of the mix at a time.
4.generously portion out cookies with a small scoop and bake for 10 min.  open up oven, gently flatten down tops of cookies, and bake for 3 more minutes.
These made about 34 cookies for me.

These are delicious and easy cookies! I also added a 1/2 tsp. salt and put the batter in the fridge for an hour before baking. I rolled them out in balls and baked them! They came out perfectly puffy and had a great taste. 
With all cookies, put them in a container with a piece of white bread and they will stay soft for days!!!

My family loved these.  I add 1/2 tsp. Salt to this recipe.  As for combining the ingredients.  Combine dry ingredients except the white and brown sugar.  In a separate bowl cream sugars and very soft butter until light and fluffy add one egg at a time and then add the vanilla.  Add the sifted dry ingredients a little at a time into the wet ingredients.  Fold in the chocolate chips.  These were very moist, chewy, and rich.  I will be making these again.

These were excellent. I was out of brown sugar and had to use yellow golden sugar in its place, but they still turned out. I rolled the dough into smallish balls and didn't flatten them -- so the centre stays soft. I recommend these ones for sure.

Delicious! But it's a little too sweet for my own taste, so I used bitter chocolate. Other than that, really, really good and satisfies the sweet tooth.

The best cookie recipe I've ever tried, there are a lot of bad ones out there! I followed SHEBOP's directions and sifted all dry ingredients except the sugars. The cookies are EXCELLENT! I'll be passing this one on to others! I'm sure you can make regular chocolate chip by just omitting the cocoa powder.

I made these cookies because I had those ingredients in the kitchen.  I was looking for cookies my son could leave out for Santa.  As it turns out my husband, who is normally against my baking because he's not a big fan of cookies and cake, really loved them.  I did change the recipe a little.  I added about a 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking powder.  They are beautifully fluffy and very moist.  I think the salt brings out the flavor a little better.  I actually tried one cookie before adding the salt and it was a little blande.  I would definately recommend the salt. Love the cookies though.

Easy and good. A recipe that can be tweaked. I am taking some of these to our family Christmas gathering along with a few of my other faves.  My grown up kids love to have cookies to take home so this year they each get their own tin.  Makes me feel happy to find recipes I like and this one is a keeper!

Like other reviewers, I added 1/2 tsp salt to this recipe. I also added a 6 oz bag of dried cherries. The cookies came out delicious, almost like a chocolate covered cherry. If (when) I make them again, I would probably add more cherries. Thanks for a great recipe!

Super cookie!! I must admit, I am eight and a half months pregnant, so I might be a bit biased, but I had a craving for choc. choc. chip cookies and this recipe was too simple to pass up, and used cocoa powder instead of baking chocolate, which meant no running to the store. I did have hubby stir it for me as it was a very thick dough, but it made wonderful cookies that were even better cold than fresh out of the oven. Loved them! Thanks.

The best double chocolate cookies I have ever had.  I added a pinch of salt, an extra pinch of baking soda, some extra flour to thicken a little and about 2 tablespoons extra cocoa for darker color.  All around great recipe.

These were delicious!  Instead of dropping by spoonfuls, I rolled them into balls and flattened them with a floured spoon.  I thought they looked prettier this way.

I made this exactly as written, however I wish I had used only half the amount of butter. I found these cookies to be greasy and the butter overpowered the chocolate taste. I brought them to a staff party though and everyone there seemed to love them, just not for me.

We really enjoyed these! You can use margarine instead of butter (on some recipes you can't substitute) and as some other reviewers suggested, I added 1/2 tsp.  of salt.

Unbelievably Perfect! These cookies are so tasty, they're addictive, and I will keep this recipe in my cookbook for years to come! The directions arent right though, i followed someone elses review and sifted the flour, cocoa, and baking soda together, and creams the rest of the ingredients together(besides the chips)then combined it. Ten minutes in the oven and they were PERFECTION! Next time I'll try white chocolate chips!

SOOOOO yummy. I substituted 1 cup of butterscotch chips for 1 of the cups of chocolate chips, so there was one of each. It was SO good. Rich and chocolatey with a little something extra. Perfect!

These cookies are awesome!!!  I wanted something a little different than the regular cookies and this was it.  I like soft, chewy cookies so I slightly underbaked mine and they came out great. Even my fiance couldn't stop eating them.

These cookies tasted good & were very easy to make.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt & substituted 1 cup of macadamia nuts & 1 cup chopped dark chocolate for the 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips the recipe calls for.  I made the dough the night before baking & refrigerated it.  I think it would have been difficult to work with if not chilled.  Thanks.

EXCELLENT!  My husband even said he loved them and took some to work!  (He doesn't like cookies at all except white chocolate macadamia nut cookies)  I doubled the recipe and used my pampered chef scoop to make a uniform sized cookie.  These were soft and delicious.  Thanks for a classic!!  BTW, I had the dough on the counter for the first few batches and it seemed to be getting too soft and then I threw it in the fridge when I wasn't using it and those cookies didn't spread as much when I baked them.  I cooked each sheet about 13 minutes.

really yummy! Don't forget the salt - about 1/2-1 tsp!! Also, if you're looking to make them a little healthier, use 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat or spelt flour. There's no difference in taste or texture, but lots of difference in nutrients and fiber content!

These were so yummy!  I was looking for something different than my regular choc. chip cookie recipe!  This was great.  I did 1/4 cup of white chips w/ 3/4 c. semi-sweet.  Next time, I would do 50/50!  It's very versatile.  PB chips would be good, too!

Fantastic! I made these for the first time over Christmas and everyone raved about them. I've made this recipe a few more times since then and have been adding 1/2 a teaspoon of raspberry flavored hot chocolate mix to the dough to give it a slightly different flavor sometimes, too.

this cookie is very moist and chewy.  The batter is very thick and hard to stir, but it is well worth it when you are done.  I added a helf cup of chopped walnuts and that was very good.  It added some crunch that was very satisfying, over all this cookie was a very good.

I just tried this about 2 weeks ago and I have already made it 3 times!  Once for work and twice for my family.  I love it and have tried dark chocolate chunks which makes it even better. Plus they are soft and chewy.  I love it!

Well, I thought I already had the best Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe - but decided to try a different one for a change - this one is wonderful!!  My kids absolutely love these.  Don't be afraid they will be too chocolatey they weren't.  Great recipe will make these over and over again- thanks for sharing!

Did anyone else have an extremely DRY batter? After adding the flour mixture, I couldn't even mix it. I am 99.9% sure I followed the recipe correctly. 

It was so dry I had to add another egg. Usually another egg makes cookies chewier. They just came out of the oven and I tasted one- so far so good. They are very chocolately. I did half the batch with  Reeses chips, and half with chocolate chips.

I would use this recipe again with the extra egg, but I think I'll search for another one before then.

Very delicious!  Didn’t spread out as much as I would have liked but still chewy, not cake like.  Saved as a favorite as my whole family loved them!

I love it!!! This recipe is amazing! If you don’t have any brown sugar you can replace it with white sugar and the difference is unrecognizable.

Only added a "pinch" of salt. My grown son had some chocolate chip chocolate cookies from the bakery of a store and raved about them. I said they should be simple to make. I went to my trusty reference, AllRecipes.com, and found this.  They are just what I was looking for. Perfect.

I made these according to the recipe listed and added a teaspoon of peppermint extract.  Outstanding! These turned out soft and puffy.

These were delicious. Only changes I made was using shortening instead of butter because my child is alergic to milk (made half without chocolate chips) and I rolled them into balls. They were very tasty. Will definatly be making again.

I loved these cookies. I was skeptical at first because when they were finished cooking they were very liquidy, but once the cooled, they were nice and chewy. I used almond extract instead of vanilla because I was out. They tasted exactly like marzipan, so good.

I baked this and even though mine wasn't flat, I couldn't care less. took a lot longer for mine to bake but that could be due to my oven anyway. I did reduce the sugar to half cup each but followed everything else exactly and it tasted really good. crispy and chewy. awesome recipe this one. definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I made it with Ener-G Egg replacer and Blue Bonnet Light because of food allergies. They turned out perfectly. The dough was so sticky I thought for sure they would turn out super flat, but they were seriously perfect. I didn't really pay that much attention to mixing the dry first and then the wet. I used a kitchen-aid mixer which may be why it didn't matter. I did cream the butter and sugar first, then I added the Ener-G Egg Replacer, baking soda, and vanilla. Then I added the rest of the dry ingredients. We used Enjoy Life chocolate chips. If you underbake them a bit they taste like brownies. They are really good completely baked too. ETA: In my non-convection oven if I bake for 12 mins they are still a little underbaked. I have to cook for 14-15 minutes for them to  be fully cooked.

Amazing! I loved it, my roommates loved it, everyone loved it. I did make two changes: I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar because I like sweet things, and I also added 1/2 tsp of salt for flavor. No problems with them being too thin like some people said.

Tasted good overall, but I don't think that the cookies edges were meant to be golden. I waited for an hour but the sides did not turn golden!

This recipe is good  - you can add and change a few bits to it - I have made a brownie out of the same mixture just add some milk to it -  I would suggest a hint of cinnamon and all spices to accentuate the chocolatey taste.

Yum! This was my first attempt at chocolate chocolate chip cookies. My 9 year old was eager to bake with me, so he did most of the measuring and stirring, which may have affected the outcome.  They turned out more cake-like than cookie-like, but were still really good. We'll make them again.

These are yummy and easy to make! They have that creamed butter/sugar cookie taste, but with the chocolate added on top of that. A very tasty homemade cookie. Make sure you completely mix the dry ingredients together before beginning. Could easily change these up with peanut butter chips, nuts, or whatever different mix ins you could want! Be careful to store in an airtight container as these can dry out easily!

The cookies were great!  I only added 1 1/2 cups of chips as I thought that should be enough.

Easy to make. First time made a batch and it was very good. Better than expected. One of the best cookie recipes I used. I would recommend good Belgium cocoa.

I thought these were good as written but agree with others that salt would make them even better. I didn't have enough chocolate chips for 2 cups, but they were still really chocolatey.

Oh my chocolate! Deliciously chocolately. I made these to bring to my friends house and I'm sure the'll be eaten up. Most cookies I've make dry up, but these are staying soft and chewy. They're very rich and sweet, Thank-you so much for this awesome recipe!

They taste fantastic!  I found that there were too many chocolate chips for the batter and that because of this they were too gooey to get off the pan, which was a little frustrating.

A chocolate chip cookie and brownie marriage made in heaven! Only one thing could make it better in my mind and that is the addition of peanut butter.  I used a half cup of PB chips to one and a half cups chocolate chips. The result was one happy husband and two happy grandsons!

I made these and these cookies are very delicious! But they keep breaking apart. I refrigerated them for 1 hour, also adding 1/2 tsp of salt and adding 1/2 tsp of salt more because there was no salted-butter. It turned out great but the only thing i don't like is they keep on breaking into bits and pieces. OH AND VERY CHOCOLATEY! I recommend for chocolate lovers!.

Made this cookie dozens of times now!  Made with both semi-sweet and white choco chips.  I love it because it is not oversweet and still chewy in the middle.  Total keeper.

This recipe is by far one of my favourites that I came across on this website. They are easy to make and have been a total hit between my family and friends! I have been these 3-4 times within the last week or so and defiantly plan to make them again and again and again! :D

OMG...just made these for Super Bowl Sunday (which is tomorrow).  They are DEEELISH!  I made a double batch and used DARK cocoa powder, 2 cups semisweet chips and 2 cups milk chocolate chips...sooooo good.  Now I'm going to have to hide them so they actually make it to the Super Bowl party!

It was obvious that this recipe didn't have enough flour to go with the 1 cup butter.  The cookies are very flat.  Sure, mix sugar, butter and chocolate chips together and you'll get something that tastes good.  But it's not a real cookie recipe.  I'd add an additional 1 cup flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder.

Delicious, I will be making these over and over again! Just the right amount of chocolate for me!  I added mini  Reese's Pieces instead of chocolate chips...sooo good!  I do find that they are on the sweet side of things but that's just my personal preference.  The batter looked more like cake mix which made me worry I did something wrong but it all worked out perfectly.   the cookies came out lightly crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  they are fat cookies and not flat disks.

These are delicious tasting, I love cookies that include brown sugar.  The most important thing they are a little more cake-like, if you want more chewy do not cook quite as long as others, they crisp faster.  I always lower my baking temp to.  And the bigger the better for chewy goodness.

I've made both chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipes 1 and 2. This one is better the half white half brown sugar in this recipe helps. If this recipe is flat add 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar.  They will round up and get that beautiful cracked look on top. I  added a small box of instant chocolate pudding [dry] and they where terrific, this is how I do them now. Not at all artificial tasting, but makes them moist, that lasts . If the dough is too thick add 2-3 tablespoons of hot water.

Love this easy recipe! Made it over the holidays with different add ons: dark chocolate chips, chips and nuts, mini M & M's, mint chocolate chunks. Want to try them with peanut butter chips. They are a big hit!

I made this for school and they turned out AMAZING. I put some of them into a "lolly jar" that had a gingerbread man top half as a body and it was so cute! Instead of making 12 i actually managed to make 39 lol.

I used to buy a certain fast food chain's triple chocolate cookie. I saw this and tried it. I used the dark chocolate cocoa powder as I prefer my chocolates a bit bitter in general. To balance it out, I used 1 cup of the semi sweet morsels AND 1 cup of the sweeter WHITE chocolate morsels. They turned out YUMMMMMYYY!!! I'll never buy that chain's triple chocolate cookie again!!! I'll try the 1/2 teaspoon salt with it next time. YES, there WILL BE a next time. And a next time after that. And a next time after that... ;-P

Only change I have made to this recipe was to use Mint Chocolate chips, if they are available.  It's one of my favorite Bake Sale recipes.

They have a great taste.
Mine are crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle.
I left them in longer, for about 20 mintues. They didn't look done after 12 minutes. I'm just a bit bummed about how flat they are, I hoped they would be thikker. But the tasted is amazing, which is the most important part!

My 11 year old daughter made these no problem.... yum!!! One of the best cookies I've had. We only had 1/2 cup of butter so we substituted the other 1/2 cup with margarine  (I think all butter cookies turn out flat anyways). Also had to substitute the chocolate chips with 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup mini chocolate chips (gotta go with what you have in the cupboard during a cookie emergency). Yum!!! So good! This is now our go to recipe when we need to bring cookies somewhere.

Loved this recipe.  The cookies came out very moist on the inside, which is what I like.  I cut back on the white sugar, brown sugar, and butter and it was still delicious, and a bit too sweet.  Left them out over night uncovered and the next morning they were still moist and soft.  Definitely will be making these again.

Delicious!! Followed some tips from others and added 1/2 tsp salt. Also added 1/4 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder since my oven is a little weird. Substituted 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips with toffee bits and added pecans to 1/2 the batch... Success

These cookies were very good. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because for me personally, I would have liked them just a tad bit sweeter, but overall this will be my go to recipe for double chocolate chip cookies. I noticed that other reviewers found the directions to be confusing, however, I did not. They were very simple.

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE EVER!!!!!!!!!!
when I made them I tough that they would dry out like most chocolate cookies,
but no they just got better over time.
one thing that I did different was I DIDN'T mix them a electric mixer I just mixed by hand.
thanks for posting this :)

I can't give it a 5 b/c I didn't follow exactly...but these were delicious!  I realized too late that I didn't have enough butter...so I used half butter and the other 1 part canola oil, 1 part peanut butter.  They tasted delicious, though!!!  Thanks for a good recipe!!!

Not the best I've ever had, but the best I've managed to make so far! The texture is nice, chewy without being too dense or too cakey. I would like to try this recipe again mixing in some dark chocolate cocoa and/or chips to see if I can get a richer chocolate flavor. This recipe may be a jumping off point for many future experiments!

Followed this recipe exactly, except I switched out the chocolate chips for some chopped up Andes mints.  I made some with regular Andes mints and some with Peppermint Crunch Andes mints.  Both were delicious and the red and green colors were perfect for Christmas!  Yum!

These are great cookies! I made them exactly as the recipe is written but used mint baking chips for a holiday cookie. Mine did turn out a bit flat, but the texture was fine. My husband and son are gobbling them up. This recipe did however make much more than the yield stated. It made 4 dozen for me, and I was making much larger than tsp sized drops. Something to consider before you go and double it.

These are ok.  Very flat and thin.  If I added more flour like other suggested, it would only make a cakey cookie...not what I want.  I won't be making it again.

Really good. I added 1 cup of chopped macadamias and a dash of salt.  Also an extra half tsp. Vanilla. Perfect consistency. Soft yet slightly chewy. 3" dia cookies took 10 min in my oven, on heavy duty stainless cookie sheets, one sheet at a time.

This cookie was fantastic! For me, it made about 3 1/2 dozen 2 1/2" cookies! The first batch I made didn't spread out as I'd hoped, so on the remaining batches I took the bottom of a cup, dipped it in sugar, and flatten each cookie before baking! Turned out not only looking fabulous, but tasting fabulous too!

very tasty, chocolatey goodness!  I used a medium sized scoop and left them rounded, which increased the baking time by a couple of minutes. The yeild on this recipe is about 3 dozen (made with medium scoop) My husband says "P.F.G."  for those of you who know what that means...!

These did not do it for me.  I was excited with all the great reviews. They tasted okay - nothing special. I have made so much better, but I'm always looking for easier/tastier. I'm a seasoned baker and maybe it just did not work because I doubled the recipe.  I used softened butter but still the cookies flowed too much on the ungreased cookie sheet. So, I tried parchment, still did not work. I refrigerated the dough overnight and tried the same the next day with similar results. I even tried different temps and times. I finally plopped double the amount into muffin cups baked for 20 min at 350 and it turned out like molten chocolate cakes.

Well first off, it is now called moose poop in our house because it's easier to say...and funny! I added walnuts to this, only 1/2 cup, and ran out of normal chocolate chips so I used some mini ones, but it didn't seem to make a difference. My entire family loved them and I will definitely make them again.

I've made this recipe so many times now I had to write a review to say how much everyone loves these cookies.  Quick and simple to make and turns out a big batch which is good for giving some away (if you can pry them from the kids hands!).

At the kids suggestion I also added in white chocolate chips which has become their favourite version.

My favourite is adding peppermint essence instead of the vanilla and making mint choc cookies - these are great!

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I changed it combining another recipe off this site as I wanted to get rid of some mini marshmallows;  1/2 cup margarine, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 eggs, tsp vanilla, 2 tbsp milk, beat together. Mix dry ingredients; 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup cocoa, 1 tsp baking soda, then add to 1st mixture, added 1 1/2 cups or so of mini marshmallows and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, baked for 8 minutes @ 350...brought into work and my coworkers loved them and also some for my friends little boys and they said I make the best cookies in the universe :)

Not  sure if it's the recipes or me, but I didn't find these cookies to be sweet enough!  My husband came home and tried these and said 'did you put all the sugar you were supposed to in these?'  I'll have to try these again and see if they come out differently.  Other then that, great texture and good chocolate flavor.  USE REAL BUTTER!!!

These cookies turned out fantastic!  They looked just like the picture and the added coco makes them hands down better than a regular chocolate chip cookie.  I added the salt as other reviewers suggested but still wished they were a bit thicker.

Absolute perfection!  The only changes I made were to use white chocolate chips with half the dough and semi sweet chocolate chips with the other.  I also added a quarter of an After Eight mint cookie to each cookie right after I pulled them out of the oven.  A minute later, I took a knife and swirled the melted mint on top.  DELICIOUS!

good recipe. but here are some tips to make them even better. First, the semi-sweet chocolate chips have to go. Make them milk-chocolate. Guittard or other large chocolate chips give the cookies a melt-in-the-mouth flavor. also, forget the white sugar and use all dark brown sugar. It makes it all better. Great idea with the lots of butter, it gives them a better flavor. Finally, with the eggs, take one medium sized egg and all of one other egg yoke with a pinch of the white. Happy baking! and keep it up with more good recipes for me too bake!

These are THE BEST cookies I've ever had or made. They came out extremely soft and very, very chocolatey. I was worried the batter was too dry, so I added about 1/4 cup of milk and a little extra vanilla. I used milk chocolate chips the first time, and this time I'm using peanut butter chips. EXCELLENT!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. The cookies tasted ok but they spread way too much and after cooling were flat as a pancake. Sorry but I will not be trying this one again.

These were very good and got better with age.  I used half chocolate and half butterscotch chips - very yummy.  Very moist... I cut the recipe in half and it still turned out great. And obviously don't substitute the butter, especially with Crisco.  Don't do that in any cookie... the two are simply not the same at all.

I've made these several times for my friends, family, and myself. Everyone who tries one wants another! I often use 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of either white chips, chopped andes candies, or peanut butter chips. I think they turn out best when the dough sits in the refrigerator for a little while.

The directions were fine, maybe they were updated? My husband loved these cookies (he won't eat sweets, let alone chocolate). I thought they were AMAZING! I will definitely make these again!

These cookies were fabulous. However, if someone is new to baking the instructions would be very confusing to them. There is no place in directions where one is told to put vanilla nor chocolate chips, and the dry ingredients would not include the sugars, etc. I have made chocolate chip cookies for decades so even though I have never made these, I knew in which order to put what. An inexperienced baker may not know. But it was a great cookie none-the-less!!! Can't wait to go eat more!!

I made these with my daughter and a couple of her friends, then sent a plate to the friends' homes-Both families thought they were "The best cookies ever!" I added flax to the recipe, which changed the texture a bit, but not the flavor-Froze a batch for a few weeks and just took them out. After thawing they were as amazing as they were when freshly baked. In fact they are gone so I'm off to make more!

These came out very dry. Not sure if it was due to me overcooking them, or the recipe instructions. Regardless..I will find a different recipe for these. Sorry!

I have never made cookies that were not already pre-made just stick in the oven kind. These came out prefect! I read the instructions really well before making them, so I didn't run into any issues. they were nice and fluffy when they came out and flatened out a bit as they cooled. Absolutely delish! I only had NESTLE CHOCOLATE NESQUIK POWDER it came out wonderful!

I've made these cookies about 3 times and they're great, however I'm only giving it 4 stars because the directions could be better. For example: - it doesn't say when to put in the vanilla extract.  - it doesn't say whether to put the chocolate chips in w/ the dry ingredients or wet ingredients - the ingredients should be listed in the order they're used - the butter should be softened before using.  Suggestions: Step 2 onward should read something like:  Step 2: Combine dry ingredients: flour, cocoa powder & baking soda.  Step 3: In a separate bowl mix the wet ingredients by creaming sugars, eggs & softened butter.  Step 4: Mix the vanilla extra & chocolate chips into the wet ingredients.  Step 5: Sift dry ingredients into wet ingredients and mix well. Step 6: Drop by teaspoon onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 9 to 12 minutes.

Great cookies. You have to REALLY like chocolate to love these, though. They also didn't turn out as chewy as I normally like my cookies.  However, they really are delicious. Definitely addictive. I'm not even a huge fan of chocolate, and I ate more of them than I want to admit. Everyone else loved them too, I got tons of compliments. I would probably make these again.

I followed this recipe exactly, and the consistancy and appearance are amazing. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I don't think they have that rich chocolate flavor, so next time I think I'll add in at least 3 blocks of chocolate to the mixture, or do something.. but in all it is good enough by the recipe and good enough if you need to make some yummy cookies for a meeting or occasion.

The first time, we used homemade hot chocolate mix instead of cocoa, and they were amazing. I have since run out of that mix, and have not been able to get the same results with commercial hot chocolate mix or with cocoa. Everyone loves them every time though.

Good taste but they came out, as they say, flatter than a pancake. I followed the recipe completely, with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp salt. I will not make these again.

The first time I made these cookies, they turned out beautifully. Same with the second. However, since those times, the cookies have turned flat and spread out over the pan. This happens only when I double the recipe, even though I check and double check that I'm adding the correct amount of ingredients. Does anyone know what might be causing this?

The cookies baked on an insulated baking sheet (totally flat except for a lip on one side) came out the nicest; it adds a couple of minutes to the baking time but is well worth it.  Also, switching the pans halfway through (from top to bottom rack and bottom to top) helps them come out more uniform.  As for the reviewer who said they were nothing special - you can't expect some unusual flavor without adding some unusual ingredient.  These are basic double chocolate chip cookies, that came out perfectly.  That's not an easy thing.  Incidentally, macadamia nuts would make an excellent mix-in here.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Conference attendees will thank you :)

This was a really yummy recipe. I made a double portion, and made three different versions of the cookie (as part of a present). I didn't ad the cocoa immediately, and split it in three. One third I mixed with dried cranberries, shredded coconut and white chocolate, another followed the original recipe, thou I added some lemon peel, the last third turned out far the best, I used chocolate covered caramel and walnuts (chopped rather finely). The ones who actually followed the original recipe weren't really that interesting, but soft and chocolaty. They are a little bit to sweet for my Scandinavian taste. I wonder how well they keep out side the fridge?

Great  cookies!  I doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp. salt and an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa.  I used 2 bags of mini chocolate chips.  Using a SMALL cookie scoop, this recipe yeilds 105 little cookies when doubled.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These cookies are a favorite of my coworkers.  Whenever I bring them in, they are almost always gone before lunch.  I always use Ghiradelli chocolate chips, which are nice and dark.

Very good.  Something a bit different from the run of the mill chocolate chip cookie.  I'm baking them and going to put in the freezer for some summer house guests that will be here soon.  Now, it's time to try Mrs. Siggs peanut butter cookies.

I thought the cookies came out OKAY. I had a lot of trouble mixing it and ending up throwing my hand in the mix. I had to knead to dough. I feel like it was missing a little salt and I would add a lot more sugar! It just wasn't sweet enough for me. Next time I'd just buy the dough already made from the supermarket.

BEST COOKIE EVER!
OMG!!!!!!!! I made these for our neighbor last weekend and saved 1 for each of my family - little did I know... I should have made like a billion of these! Thank you sooooohoho much for this recipe.
Here's what I did:
I used white chocolate chips with the regular chocolate chips, and I creamed the butter and sugars first to give the cookies a good texture. They were so soft some of them fell apart when I moved them! 
YUM - I will DEFINITELY make again!

I was expecting a fantastic cookie after reading all the reviews and I just wasn't all that impressed. It's a decent, very chocolaty cookie, but the flavor wasn't anything really special. The flavor was like your basic brownie. I followed the recipe exactly. The dough was also very sticky and hard to work with.

Loved theses cooies!!!  Have been looking for a good Chocolate cookie for awhile.  Did add 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  One thing to remember, be sure to flatten cookie dough with your fingers before baking.  Otherwise , they dont flatten when they bake!  GREAT COOKIE~~~

I have to start by saying, I love the batter!  It's so silky, smooth, and easy to work with.  I ended up cutting the sugars down to 1/3 each (which ended up being not sweet enough.. my fault!)..but now I eat more in one sitting. :-)  I ran a bit short on cocoa powder, so I added 1 1/2 tsp. of espresso powder.  I creamed and mixed everything by hand, and I'm so pleased with the end result.  These cookies are soft, but definitely need milk! :-)  I added 1/2 tsp. of salt, as suggested by reviewers-good idea.  It took me an hour to prepare, bake, and place these cookies on the cooling rack - huge plus. :-)  I'll be making these again.. thank you for sharing your recipe!

Mmmm....so good. I did what other reviewers suggested and added the 1/2 tsp salt and mixed the dry and moist ingredients separately before combining the two. These were amazing! Moist on the inside with a nice with a firmer, but not too firm, outside edge. Highly recommended!

These were some of the best choc.-choc. chip cookies I have ever eaten. Of course I did tweak it a bit. I added the salt like others recommended. Also I used dark choc. cocoa powder, and about a 1/3 to 1/2 cup of coffee. I also only had some partial bags of chips, so I had semi-sweet choc., white choc. , and bittersweet choc. chips. It was sooo good. However I think that if I were to make this again, I'd use a few tablespoons of choc. or coffee liqueur.

The crumbs have no calories or fat, right?  These are wonderful!  I, too, made a cookie cake out of it and then cut them into bars.  Added the 1/2 tsp salt, also.

WOW!  These cookies were fabulous...and I'm not a HUGE cookie fan unless they're really worth it.  

I made a couple of adjustments.  I added about a 1/2 tsp of kosher salt, as most baked goods need a little bit of salt to enhance flavor.  Some people also suggested that this helps the cookies rise?  I also added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. Oh MAN were they good!

These cookies are THE BEST.  The only change I made was to use only 1 cup chocolate chips, and I added 1 cup M&M's.  I used the Valentine-colored M&M's to make them festive.  After putting the dough onto the cookie sheet, I pressed a few more M&M's into the top of the dough.  They were so soft and delicious.  I took some to work, and they were gobbled up.  Everyone kept telling me how evil I was bringing these cookies in that they couldn't resist.  My husband would not stop talking about them.  I'm making some more today!

I had a great time making these. By mixing the eggs with the sugars till it is like a whipped cream makes them even more fluffy at exit from the oven. I would also recommend cooling them in the fridge for an hour prior to baking. MMMMMMMMMM

Very good. I added my white and brown sugar to the "dry ingredients" bowl per instructions then read that the sugars were to be creamed with the butter and eggs. I re-bounded with a good cookie in the end. :-) I found the dough to be very sticky and hard to work with. I could handle it much better after putting it in the frig for a few minutes.

I just followed what the other postings had to say about combining ingredients. I used almond extract, I was out of vanilla. Very very tasty.

DELICIOUS!?
I absolutely LOVE these. I added 1/2 tsp of salt and used only 1/2 cup of butter but added 3 tsp of vanilla..
Positively delectable! I will definitely keep this recipe.

I'm not a huge chocolate lover, but I decided to make some cookies to take into work with me and figured these would be a nice change from the regular old chocolate chip cookies. My mom loved that the house smelled so good when she got home, and I had to stop myself from eating more of them! My dad limited himself to 5 cookies haha. I cant wait to take them with me to work in the morning. :)

Quite good, and my husband and I didn't even add the chocolate chips - just walnuts.  For those cookie dough eaters out there, this stuff is great!

These cookies are *awesome*.  They taste very brownie like right from the oven. I also trippled the vanilla in the receipe, but these cookies turned out fantastic!  It makes very large cookies too.  I converted the reciepe to 12 and made 12 huge cookies.

The cookies kept there shape well but the texture was not to my liking.  They almost have a cake like texture.  I found that this recipe was bland. Not sure if it was because it didn't call for salt or if it was due to less sugar then most cookie recipes.  If you prefer a chewy sweeter kind of  cookie I wouldn't suggest this recipe.

These have a special spot in my holiday baking box.  I can never keep them around for very long, I tend to have to make a double batch and hide them from the hubby.

Dangerously tasty!  I thought they were pretty easy to make, too.  We used "gourmet" chocolate chips and added walnuts and they were better than any cookie I've ever bought in a mall.

Excellent according to my hubby and daughter. Co-workers loved them, too! The only change was I used 1/2c butter and 1/2c butter flavored crisco instead of the full c. of butter. Otherwise this was chocolate perfection.

This recipe is perfect; I've been searching for such recipes for a long time!
Because I wanted a crispier and crunchier cookie, I used only white sugar. And I added the salt too, to puff it up. =)

Wonderful! I am vegan, so I used egg replacer instead of eggs, and I used non-dairy chocolate chips, as well as Earth Balance whipped butter. They turned out fantastic!

I followed the recipe and made no changes.  The cookies are good, crispy on the outside, soft like a brownie on the inside. Very good. It took the 12 minutes to bake mine.

The cookies just finshed cooling and they are great!!  I did add 1/2tsp of salt and instead of chocolate chips, I used the peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips.  Really really good!

Delicious! Much better than other chocolate cookie recipe I found. I used a mixture of semi-sweet and Andes Mint chips. Definitely better to make a double batch.

I had lots of half used bags of different flavored chips and sought a recipe to use them up, this was perfect.  I doubled the recipe (glad I did) and added a combo of vanilla, semisweet and capuccino chips.  The chocolate flavor was really intense.  I will make these again & again.  Thank you.

I made a batch of these cookies and had to keep slapping my hubby's hands away to save some for the family!They're incredible! Hands-down, the best chocolate chip cookies we've ever had. We've got a new family favorite. Next time we're going to make them with butterscotch chips to add some zing. Excellent!

These cookies were awesome. At first, I was a little skeptical about how little chocolate you put in them, but in the end the final product was great and they were perfectw ith the amount of chocolate in the recipe. Thank you very much for submitting this recipe! I will definitely make them again.

These were just plain delish!! Everyone loved them.  Not cakey, kind of flat and gooey. I cooked for 8 min when I dropped them by the teaspoonful.  These will be in my recipe box for sure.

Great texture and delicious chocolatey taste! It's also very easy and quick. I substituted the semisweet choc chips with those new peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips (PB rulez!!!) and they turned out yummy! However, the recipe directions are a little sparse and might be difficult to understand for beginner bakers, otherwise this cookie recipe is a keeper!

These cookies were awesome.  My son, who is a very picky eater and does not like to try something new or a variation of something he already likes, loved them.  Very good recipe.

These cookies were yum. I halved the cocoa powder as I thought it might be too chocolately. I did manage to burn a few of the cookies but I can hardly blame the recipe for that.

Delicious, simple and extremely decadent  One of my kids didn't like them, claiming, "they're too chocolatey....not a concept I'm familiar with!
