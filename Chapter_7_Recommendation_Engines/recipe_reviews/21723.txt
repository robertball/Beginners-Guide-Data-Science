Ok I thought this stuff tasted horrible, but my 8 month old daughter LOVED it. As a matter in fact she chased me around the kitchen until I gave her more. The recipe makes alot. So I store it in the frig and each morning I put some into a bowl and add just alittle(cap full)of milk to make it smooth again.

Well, I liked it.  My 9 month old, however, gagged and did everything he could to get it out of his mouth.  My husband and I figured it must be the texture, so we put it in the food processor until very smooth, but the baby still hated it.  Husband thought perhaps cheese takes getting used to...

I'm not sure how to rate this, personally I did not care for it but my little one ate it. I'm not sure what age this recipe was intended for but my son is 8 months so I used Baby rice cereal and had to thin it out a bit. I used breast milk instead of the milk and homemade apple sauce in place of the juice. I plan to add some cinnamon next time and maybe some vanilla. This recipe makes a lot which is good for busy mornings.

I was so excited to try this recipe with my 2 year old son!  I thought for sure he would love it!  He hated it.  Spit out the first bite and refused more.  What a waste of food.
