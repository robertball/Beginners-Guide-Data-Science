Not sweet at all, and has no taste of chocolate. Tastes kind of like unsweet banana bread.

Brownies came out very good and large amount. gooy even when cooled, but firmer - the next day after sitting in fridge. I added coconut cream to make it smooth and add moisture since I used date sugar granulated (didn't have dates in the house).  Also used cooked from scratch mixed beans because I already had them. Bananas were frozen, but didn't make a difference. The beans, vanilla,  date sugar, and banana combo tasted great on it's own.  Neighbor who sampled the brownies couldn't tell the base ingredient is mixed beans.
