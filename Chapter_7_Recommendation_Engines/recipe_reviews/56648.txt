These are so easy.  They are great because the ingredients are always on hand.  I like to make a little extra because we really like meat.  I also wrapped the potatoes in foil with butter and garlic salt while I baked them.

fast and easy!  I diced and fried my potatoes in oil rather than baked them, due to time, and it was great!

This was a decent little meat and potato recipe.. It's definitely budget friendly and who doesn't like meat and potatoes?! The only thing I did different was I added 3 minced garlic with the onions ( I love garlic) and I added mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese (cause that's all I had on hand).. I think I will use cheddar next time.. I also noticed the potatoes tasted better if you let them sit for a few min. when  they come out of the oven before serving them. I also made a side salad to go along with the potatoes.

YUMMY!! These were so good! I kept to the recipe except that i only had small Yukon potatoes so i arranged 5 small potatoes together, to resemble one bigger potato and poured the mixture over. Definitely comfort food! Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I added a little more cream soup than called for since I had some extra in the fridge to use up. I cut the onion to half. This was a great easy meal that my husband raved over. Thanks for sharing this is a real keeper!

I made this with some changes. I will try it another time using the baked potaotes. I had some frozen cubed hash brown potatoes that I wanted to use up, so I used this instead of the baked potatoes. I sprayed the baking dish with Pam and spread the potatoes on the bottom. Baked this at 350 while I browned my meat and onions. I used 1 can cream of chicken soup and about 3/4 can of water. I added some Worcestershire sauce to the mixture. I also used about 1 tsp. of the garlic powder. Combined with the ground beef then poured over top of the potatoes and topped with cheese, baked for about 15 more min. It was very tasty! My kids just devoured this. This recipe is very easy to play with and add what seasonings you like!

I think I'll add 1/4 cup of milk next time because it came out a little dry and the hamburger soup mix wasn't quite enough. My 9 yr old really liked and so did we, so I'll definitely make it again.......Update: The second time I added about 1/3 cup of milk and used 6 potatoes. My husband and daughter both had seconds and said a few times each how much they liked it. I even forgot the onions, salt and pepper and only used half the cheese.

This recipe turned out very good for us. It was an easy and inexpensive dish to make, which is always great. All three of my boys ate this without complaint, and that doesn't happen real often so I am sure I will make this again. The only thing that I did different from the original recipe was add chopped green pepper to it since I had some that needed to be used up, but this would not have changed the flavor much at all and it added some nice color. Thank you for the recipe, ANDYATWOOD!
