I took the advice of other reviewers and used all whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of margerine, and Splenda brown sugar with a little honey. I also used dark chocolate chips. The cookies come out a little cakey and SO good. My whole family loved them!! Thanks for the recipe!

I have been trying to add whole wheat flour to our diet, and have learned to be careful.  All whole wheat recipees are not equal!  But this recipee is absolutely scrumptious.  I ran out of white flour and used all whole wheat flour and my kids and husband still devoured these cookies faster than I could bake them.  When using all whole wheat flour I had to add about 1 cup more flour.  Thanks Belinda for the fantastic recipee!

This recipe calls for too much sugar. I only used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar and with that, it was good. I decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon because a hate salty cookies. Other than that, this recipe is great. Its nice to have whole wheat once in a while!  BTW: Whole wheat flour is not the same as WHOLE WHEAT PASTRY FLOUR.

This is a great recipe. I did tweak it a bit for my taste since when I made it as in the recipe it was a bit dry. 
I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup
replaced the 1 cup of all-purpose flour with 1/2 cup oats (although i might try 3/4 cup next time)
I increased the baking soda to 1 tsp and reduced the choc. chips to 1 cup.
The end result is a bit more hearty because of the oats and a little less sweet. I froze a bunch of the batter and I pull them out when I want a nice warm treat!

My friends never miss an invitation to dinner at my house because they assume I'll have these cookies.  I use all whole wheat flour, butter instead of margarine, extra walnuts and fewer chocoate chips.  One time I only had one egg, so used 1/4 cup of canola oil. You just can't ruin them.  Amazing recipe!

My husband and I absolutely love these cookies. I used others advice and used only whole wheat flour and they still tasted great. I went one step further and used splenda and brown sugar splenda in place of the sugars.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  We love it for a guilt free snack.  Be sure not to overbake.

Okay, omitted half the chocolate chips and the walnuts. Egg substitute for the eggs. 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup margarine. 

Yummy!!!!! Sort of crispy and chewy at the same time. I like these a lot!

My entire family LOVES this recipe - we have thrown out all the other chocolate chip cookie recipes we used to use.  These are easy to make, and come out perfect every time!  Soft and chewy, and they keep their shape instead of flattening out into thin discs like lots of other recipes...  Be careful not to over cook these!

Oh my gosh these are good!  We are eating as I am still baking and cannot believe how unbelievable these are.  Substituted Splenda baking sugar and Splenda brown sugar for regular white sugar and brown sugar and omited the nuts (kids don't like).  Otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!

I was craving chocolate chip cookies but I realized I only had whole wheat flour on hand.  I found this recipe and gave it a try.  I am very pleased!  This recipe was very easy to make and the cookies turned out great. I would never know that it was whole wheat flour. The dough was a little more dry than I wanted, but I just added a smidge of milk to thin it out.   I'll definitely be making these again!!

My mother had requested a batch of cookies for an office party she was holding. I wanted to try a new chocolate chip cookie recipe that would appeal to more adult palates; the whole wheat rounds out the cookie, providing a more subtle but richer taste. I 1-1/2ed the recipe, and instead of using 1 cup of margerine, I used 3/4c and 1/4c applesauce. I lessened the amount of white sugar, and used some honey. The only thing I can recommend is to use more vanilla than the recipe calls for. I used approximately 3 tsp, and it still wasn't enough. Other than that, its wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and by golly they were delicious! I used butter, not margarine. I didn't have whole wheat PASTRY flour, but I had whole wheat flour and used it, and it was great. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cups each which was PLENTY. These would still be good even with less chocolate chips as well. They were very chocolaty, chewy, and decadent. YUM! **Beware of reviews saying to substitute with applesauce. I tried this and the cookies had a cakey texture. Every time I try to use applesauce in cookies, it's a disaster.

These were wonderful! I just apple sauce instead of the butter and i cut back on the sugar as well. I used egg substitute in place of one of the two eggs and used all whole wheat. I also omitted the walnuts due to personal taste. NOTE: they puff up alot so I flattened mine in to cookie like discs. They will still puff when cooked just not as high as the batch i did with out flattening; they are still fluffy. ALSO THESE FREEZE SO WELL! I make the individual discs and then froze them in between parchment paper in a large zip lock and just pull them out and bake them at the temp stated. YUM :)

These are great cookies.  I used 1/2 c margarine ad 1/4 c applesauce... great taste and texture.  Probably my new go-to choc chip cookie recipe because they are a tad healthier than white-flour only recipes.

I made a few changes and the cookies still turned out great!  I used butter instead of margarine, used all whole wheat flour, and didn't add any nuts.  Everyone loved these cookies!  I recently switched from white sugar to organic evaporated cane sugar and boy did it change the way these cookies came out.  They were more cake-like but still good.  I had to store them with some stale bread to keep them soft though.

Tonight is the second time I have made these.  The first time, I made the dough and baked all of the cookies.  Giving some away to my family.  Then I made a mix of the dry ingredients and stored in the freezer to preserve it(used fresh ground whole wheat flour).  Tonight, I took the mix out and added the wet ingredients (substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the butter/margarine).  I only baked 16 cookies.  The rest I scooped into balls and put on wax paper to freeze for later.  Over all great recipe.  Like other reviews, I find that the cookies are much richer and thicker than the ordinary choc. chip cookie.  Don't hesitate to try these.  They are excellent and the recipe is very adaptable to what you have in your pantry.

I used 3 cups of my fresh ground pastry flour, no AP flour and these turned out fabulous! The only other change I made was to sub butter for margarine because I don't touch the fake stuff. They did spread a bit due to the butter but not bad and the taste was amazing. I never expected to like WW cookies as much as regular cookies! The only change I would make for next time is to reduce the sugar a bit, I thought they were plenty sweet.

I made a variation of this recipe based on several  other recipes used before and they came out great! I used 1 cup of salted butter;1/2 cup splenda white sugar mix; 3/4 cup brown sugar; 2 tsp vanilla; 1/2 cup old fashioned oats; 3/4 cup white unbleached flour; 3/4 cup stone ground whole wheat flour; 1/2 cup milled flaxseed;1 tsp baking soda; 1/2 tsp salt; 2 cups choclate chips; they have the nice chewy texture of oatmeal cookies! next time I will use only 1/3 cup of splenda white sugar mix along with 3/4 cup regular brown sugar!

These were fabulous. I didn't use walnuts, baked bars for 12 minutes and used a mix of chocolate chunks, chocolate chips and peanut/chocolate swirl chips.

The recipe was fabulous. I made some changes per other reviewers suggestions. I used 3/4 C brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar though next time I may reduce the amount of white sugar to 1/2 C because it was still rather sweet but to each his own.   It called for 2 C of whole wheat pastry flour but I didn't have that type so I used Whole Foods whole wheat flour instead. I reduced the 1tsp of salt down to 1/2 teaspoon and used 1.5 cups of mixed chocolate chips and peanut butter chips rather than 2 C of semi-sweet choc. chips.  The dough was rather dry and again, this is probably a result of me using regular whole wheat flour rather than the pastry flour as specified. So, I added about 1/4 of vegetable oil to moisten the dough though next time, I may add apple sauce as suggested by another reviewer. The dough was crumbly so I had to form it into a tight ball about 1inch in diameter. Baked for exactly 10 minutes.   I was wary of the outcome but to my surprise, it was fantastic! So moist and chewy and the peanut butter brings out the flavor. You can't even tell this was made from wheat as I was nervous it would have that hearty taste to it but no one could tell and my roomies at them all! I'll update next time when I reduce sugar and add apple sauce! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! What a difference whole wheat flour makes!  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I used 1.5C whole wheat flour instead of 2C sifted WW pastry flour and 1/2C whole wheat instead of all-purpose. I used my kitchenaid to do all the mixing and although the dough looked dry in the beginning, I kept mixing it until the dough came together nicely. I ran out of semi-sweet choco chips, so I used a mix of mini-chips, white choco chips & ghirardelli double choco chips.  Baked for 8 minutes and cooled them on cake rack.  Excellent!

I loved this recipe. I followed it exactly except I used carob chips instead of semi-sweet. Everyone raved. It is very important to let them cool for the 5 minutes on the pan. This process sets them up nicely.

Great recipe. I have been playing around with different kinds of sweeteners and I used a little over 1/2 cup of orange juice concentrate instead of the 1 cup of white sugar. They came out great. A very soft cookie.

these cookies are very tasty and they also stay soft (i made sure to take them out of the oven after exactly 10 minutes).  i used 3c whole wheat flour since i didn't have pastry flour and i added 2 tablespoons dark cocoa powder to the mix.  i used white chocolate chips.  awesome!

Exactly as written with one exception - didn't have any white flour, so used all whole wheat.  Turned out great!  I'll be making these again very soon!

This recipe was perfect.  My husband made them and used butter instead of margarine (we don't typically have margarine around the house).  We used 3 cups of whole wheat pastry flour and no white flour.  The cookies tasted just like regular chocolate chip cookies - delicious!

This recipe was great even with all my subsitutions.  I used Smart Balance Buttery Spread instead of Margarine, 1  cups Splenda for 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup Splenda plus 1/4 cup molasses & 1/4 cup honey in place of 1 cup brown sugar, 2 teaspoons Vanilla extract in place of 1 1/2 tsp, 1 cup wheat bran instead of 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 teaspoon soda in place of 3/4 tsp and only 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Ended up with a very light, tasty cookie.  Thanks Belinda!

This cookie tastes like a gourmet, restaurant quality dessert.  I used finely chopped pecans in place of the walnuts.  I also used a mix of regular chocolate chips and mini chips, but 2 cups was too much (if that is actually possible!)  Be prepared for the dough to be very stiff, you had better have a heavy duty mixer to make this cookie.  I had to use the bread dough attachment to stir in the chocolate and nuts.  It was also difficult to form the cookies due to the excessive amount of chocolate chips.  But in the end it was totally worth the extra effort!!!!  I'm never using the boring recipe on the pack of chocolate chips again, these cookies are 10 times better and even a little healthy!

This review isn't for the original recipe; I followed some advice from previous posters (which had been rated as most helpful) and reduced the sugars down to 3/4 cup each and used applesauce instead of margarine. I also baked in a pan to make bars. They are not very sweet at all due to the decreased sugars; it's almost like a dense chocolate chip bread... the kids like them okay but I could definitely do without. Maybe they would have been better if I'd followed the original recipe?

I followed the recipe exactly, although I realized as I was making it that it said "whole wheat pastry flour" and I only had whole wheat flour.  I used my whole wheat flour and they turned out wonderful.  I have four kids who are not into health foods, and hate wheat bread so the fact that they gobbled these down surprised me!  They said, and I agreed, that they actually taste better than white flour cookies because the whole wheat gives it a little more flavor! Note:  at a later date we made these with all whole wheat flour because we were out of white flour this time, they still were great, just a little chewier.

The batter was extremely dry and crumbly.  The finished product was equally dry and excessively sweet.   I have a similar recipe which uses quite a bit more butter/margarine in ratio to the rest of the ingredients.  Sorry but this did not work for me.

Nice recipe.  I ground soft winter white wheat berries almost to pastry flour and used that only for flour, used 1/2 c less sugar and used demera instead, added some ground flax, butter instead of margarine, and only used a pinch of salt.  These were very nice - you can tell they are whole wheat but they are still nice and tender.  I am sure part of that is due to the fresh ground flour.

These were okay I guess. It seems I prefer the all purpose flour or it could have been the flour I used.   I'm not really sure.

Perfect right out of the oven--slight crunch on outside and soft inside.  Whole wheat flour gives these a delicious complexity without tasting like health food.  Substituted nuts for dried cherries.  I will definitely make these again.

Really, really outstanding cookie. I used regular whole wheat flour, sifted, instead of whole wheat pastry flour. The only other thing different I did was I used Smart Balance 50/50 butter blend instead of margarine, and I used milk chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips. This cookie is near perfection! Soft and chewy with buttery-crispy edges. Nice and fluffy but not cakey. Excellent!

These are really good and very moist.  I followed the suggestion of others and used all whole wheat flour (keep in mind this is whole wheat PASTRY flour it makes a huge difference).  I also cut the sugars to 3/4 cup of each and think that it could probably be cut even a little more.  I have made these 4 times already and next time will try the applesauce suggestion to try and cut the fat content.  Everyone I serve these to loves them.

This is my new chocolate chip cookie!  I used 2 1/2c whole wheat flour (not the pastry flour) and 1/2 cup white flour and reduced the sugar to just over one cup total.  I made 3 batches and froze lots of ready to cook balls in freezer bags.  Everyone loved these, even tried with 1/2 cup applesauce taking out half a stick of butter, that made good cookies as well- I also didn't even use all the chocolate chips (1 1/2 cups)and these were still great!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic. I love to bake with whole wheat flour, and now I have finally found my choc chip cookie recipe. I used only 1 cup Splenda brown sugar and no white sugar. Also reduced chocolate chips: 3/4 c semisweet and 3/4 c dark chocolate chunks. Yeah baby. First sheet was gone in 10 min between my kids and the neighbors' kids. Everyone loved.

These were scrumdididailicious!Store bought whole wheat flour was all I had, and they were still great!The only thing about the recipes that I changed was that I used all whole wheat flour, and all this did was that it made them a little bit of a darker color. These cookies have a very rich delicious flavor, and you can hardly tell that they're even made with whole wheat!:)

Very, very  good!  I used all whole wheat flour, and added a 3rd egg because the dough seemed dry.  I only used 3/4 of the chips as well.  These definitely taste different than the usual "tube of dough" that we buy, but sacrificing a bit of taste to be a little healthier is worth it to me!  In fact,  I'd like to try making these using evaporated cane juice instead of sugar.

Wow, these cookies are awesome! I modified the recipe only slightly, and used 1/2 cup of wheat germ in place of 1/2 cup of regular flour, cut down the chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups (which was seriously plenty) and made the cookies small so that I ended up with 88 cookies. They have a somehow bolder flavor to them, and have an awesome texture. YUMMERS!! If you're going to make chocolate chip cookies, you may as well make these so you at least get a somewhat more nutritious sugar rush:)

I never would have made this, but I read the reviews out of curiousity.  I have always wanted to find a way to make my cookies a little "bulkier" like the ones in the bakery without adding a lot of hydrogenated oils.  I substituted real butter for the margarine, and these things were so fantastic that I even gave them out to customers when I visited them today.  I really have to be proud of what I make to do that.  You won't know what you're missing until you try these!

Fantastic. My new chocolate chip cookie recipe. Used all whole wheat pastry flour (Bobs Red Mill),used all butter. 1 1/2 cups brown suger, 
1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped pecans. 4 TBS of milled flax seed (extra fiber can't hurt). Baked for 7 1/2 minutes(convection oven). Have non stick jelly roll pan so I didn't need to grease pan. Got 78 cookies,crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. Fantasic flavor,perfect size,didn't spread like some cookies do when you use all butter.

I just made these with a few substitutions.  My kids love them, and cannot even tell the difference between these and my other regular white sugar and flour recipe. 
First I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour (no white flour).  The mix seemed a bit dry, so I added about a 1/4 cup of water and that was just right.
Next, instead of brown and white sugar I substituted 1 1/4 cup of Pure Coconut Sap (natural sweetener).  
The cookies have just the right amount of sweetness and are very good.  
I only baked them for 8 minutes and they are soft and chewy.  
I'm going to keep this recipe.

This was very good.  I just used all Whole Wheat Pastry flour, 3/4 cup butter, 3/4 cup white and brown sugar and it was tasty.   I would think I could probably use less better and sugar next time and it would still be good.  I'm nervous to use applesauce...  I would definitely recommend this though.

OMG, these cookies were amazing!  Now, I did make a few changes - but stayed within the guidelines of this recipe.  I used organic, local butter in lieu of margarine, all the other ingredients were organic as well.  Although I used 1 cup of organic sugar, in place of the brown sugar I used Sucanet, and the chocolate chips I used were Sunspire Organic Grain Sweetened Dark Chocolate Chips which taste similar to semi-sweet chocolate chips, I also used all Whole Wheat Pastry Flour (no AP flour).  The Sucanet created a very dark cookie - but they were so delicious!  This is the first cookie I have ever made, that not only is decadently delicious, but I feel really good eating and serving.  A+ recipe!

YUM. Love these. I used 1/2 cup I Can't Believe It's Not Butter stick, and 1/4 cup real butter. Used about 3/4 cup of each sugar, and used about 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips. These came out the perfect shape and chewiness...they didn't flatten, thank goodness! The wheat flour adds great substance, and makes them feel healthier. :)

Finally!!! I have tried several whole wheat chocolate chip cookie recipes & am always disappointed, BUT these are awesome!!  I think sifting the flour is key. I used all whole wheat pastry flour and they turned out moist with crunchy edges. I will try less sugar next time to decrease calories as they are pretty sweet. I chopped the walnuts into tiny pieces & my kids didn't even notice them. Thanks for ending my search for a good recipe :)

yum.  This is gonna be a staple around here  I can tell ya right now!  Couple changes...used butter instead of margarine, used 1.5 cups milk chocolate chips instead of 2 cups of semi sweet, and used all whole wheat flour.  Also, I had to bake it quite a bit longer, since i used a 9 1/2 x 13 glass pan...it probably took a total of 30mins.  thanx!

Overall this is a good whole wheat cookie. Very chewy and moist. The only changes I made was using all whole wheat flour and made a smaller batch.  Will definitely make again, probably with less sugar and an even smaller batch, my cookies turned out pretty large. lol

After reading some other reviews I decided to add some milk to the dough because it was very crumbly and dry.  The end result was very good.  Even my husband liked them and he does not like anything remotely healthly :o)

This cookie recipe is fabulous!  I substituted all whole wheat pastry flour and they still turned out delicious.  You can't even tell they are whole wheat.  This will definately become a staple in our house.  Oh, and one way to keep them soft is to put an apple in the cookie jar with the cookies.

We enjoyed these - found them a bit sweet - so next time I will use dark chocolate chips.  I also added replace 25% of the whole wheat flour with with Hi-Maize 5-in-1-Fiber.  Everyone raved about them, my child even took some to school for her classmates.

I made these cookies last night using some of the suggestions here. I used applesauce instead of butter and cut each of the sugars to 3/4 cup. They were a hit! I think we had about 1/2 a dozen left by this morning and there were only 3 of us! Love the cakiness and texture. Mmmm!

I hesitated to write a review after tasting these when they first came out of the oven because, honestly, they didn't live up to my expectations, and thought I would not be making these again. I am glad I hesitated. Upon trying these the next day, I deemed them "worthy". They are thick and chewy and rich, and better the next day! Kids devoured them too.

Absolutely stupendous! Since we like our cookies a little thinner and crispier, I added extra butter.  This made these cookies so light and crispy it was wonderful!  I also added some dessicated coconut for additional crunch.  I will make these cookies again and again.  These will be the only chocolate chip cookies I make from now on.  Thank you so much for this recipe!
Hugs, Anj

These are amazing!  I replaced the white sugar with a little less than 1/2 cup of fructose and halved the brown sugar.  Lightened up on the margarine & added a 1/4 cup of applesauce.  I also used 50% coco chocolate chips.  When tasting right out of the oven they had a "cake" consistancy but when they cooled it was much more like a cookie.  These are fantastic!!

I read some of the reviews and followed some suggestions. I substituted applesauce for margarine and used all whole wheat flour as some users suggested. The cookies turned out ok, but not great, and they didn't keep well for the next day. I would suggest sticking to the original recipe and ignoring some of the suggestions.

These cookies have a great taste and a very rich texture.  I found the recipe as written to be a bit dry, so I added another egg which seemed to work out just right.  My cookies still didn't flatten out like normal, but they tasted right and felt right in my mouth, so I'm chalking that up to the WW flour.  All in all an awesome recipe for my cookie cravings while watching carbs.  Used splenda and splenda brown instead of sugar.  Will make again.

These cookies are excellent.  I substitued 1 cup Splenda for the brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups regular whole wheat flour for the pastry flour, and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for the white flour.  Next time I will substitute  "no trans fat Crisco" for the margarine and will have a VERY healthy cookie that is DELICIOUS!  Thank you!!!

What a wonderful recipe.  I made them without nuts (since my dd is highly allergic to them).  I also used sucanant instead of the brown sugar.  I did not let them cool on the sheet, just on a cooling rack.  My kids devoured them.  But, they are so filling that 3 will satisfy even the best cookie lover.  Also, I was able to make a little more than 3 1/2 dozen (44).  Thanks Belina!

Excellent reviews from Molly (10), Kate (8), Amy (old-ish), and Loren (old). The whole wheat pastry flour adds a wonderful flavor and texture; perfect balance of crispy/chewey.  I replaced the margarine with butter.

The finished dough was really dry, so I had to add another: 4 tablespoons of butter, egg, 1/8 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  I think I would experiment with adding some oatmeal next time as well.  Anyway, they were excellent with the modifications!

Wow, I am so impressed with this recipe!  Not only were they to die for, they did not flatten out like other chocolate chip recipes.  They were a little crisp (not too much) on the outside & nice and soft inside...perfect! The dough seems stiff, but not to worry, they'll turn out great!

Excellent!  Minor changes:  I used shortening instead of butter, replaced the 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup of Splenda, made sure the brown sugar was packed down (I think it can be assumed that's the thing to do w/brown sugar), decreased the all-purpose flour to 1/2 cup, and used regular 100% whole wheat flour instead of whole wheat "pastry" flour.  I made sure both kinds of flour were sifted.  I didn't grease the cookie sheet and found it wasn't necessary.  I took them out at exactly 10 minutes, which is perfect in my oven, based on how I like them.  I like to leave them slightly doughy on the inside, and allow that part of the cookie to firm up as it cools on wax paper.  Makes for a soft cookie with a slightly crisp exterior that melts in your mouth... and barely needs milk!  (But of course who would skip the milk?)  I may just make them like this all or most of the time now, since they taste just as good and are that much healthier...

These's are great! The kids (and even a few healthy food hatin' adults) loved them and had no idea they were whole wheat. I did use butter instead of margerine and white whole wheat flour in my cabinet - probably would be better with fresh but still really good!

This is my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe. I usually add half the amt of sugar, all whole wheat flour, 1tbls baking powder ( I like it softer).  Often times I replace the chocolate chips with shredded coconut!  I also make a vegan version, I replace the eggs with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and margarine instead of butter, and 1/2 to 3/4 tbls baking powder ( the applesauce makes it a bit cakey). Again, I sometimes replace the chocolate chips with coconut.

I followed the instructions, with the exception of butter instead of margarine.  inoffensive but fairly mundane and forgettable cookies.  I think with the texture of the dough, toffee bits would really perk up the recipe

Quite good and quick and easy to make. I added 4 Tbsp. of cocoa powder to make them double chocolate and it worked well, although I would add even more the next time. I actually got way more cookies than 36, I would estimate about 4.5 dozen. Will definitely make these again!

i altered the recipe, but still came out delicious. i used all whole wheat flour. used a sugar substitute and added an extra quarter cup. omitted the nuts/chocolate chips. used applesauce instead of the margarine. added 1 tablespoon whipped butter. baked for 8-9 min. they came out like little cakes :) nothing like a cookie but yummy and practically no fat.

these taste great.  i had some trouble with the dough sticking together, so i added some oil.  i still had to roll the dough into balls with my hands.  also, in the oven, they didnt melt down so i had to use a fork to smash them.  they still tasted great.

These are fantastic cookies. I love their versatility, and often add different things like cranberries, white chocolate and pumpkin seeds, or semi sweet chocolate, walnuts and flax seeds.

I followed some other reviews: Changed the 3/4 cup margarine to applesauce Changed 2 cups of sugar (white and brown) to 1 1/2 cups splenda I used all whole wheat flour (not pastry) They were yummy! And very filling. They were a bit cakey (so flatten them before cooking if you like flat cookies). I will try with the whole wheat pastry flour next time too.

These were very good. I didn't use quite as much sugar. Instead of margarine I used butter. The dough was very stiff- I figured the cookies would be hard as a rock but was pleasantly surprised they are nice and chewy in the middle. Has anyone tried adding peanut butter??

We all really enjoyed these. I tweaked the recipe a bit: I only had regular whole wheat flour, so used that in place of the whole wheat pastry flour. Instead of 3/4 cup margarine, I used a 3/4 cup measurind cup and added half melted butter and half applesauce to make 3/4 cup. I added the two cups of chocolate chips, but next time will add a little less. And lastly, I baked as cookie bars in a jelly roll pan. 375 degrees sounded too high, so I baked at 325 degress for about 20 -25 minutes (don't overbrown!) Thanks for the recipe - I feel like it was a more wholesome treat for my family.

This recipe is excellent!! I am admitably the worlds worst cookie baker, but this recipe turned out great, even for me! The only changes that I made was I substituted applesauce for the margarine, Splends for Baking for the Sugar and used ALL whole wheat flour. My family loved them! They were light and cakey! yummmmm

This recipe worked great!  The cookies came out beautifully!  I made a few adjustments to help it become a healthier snack:  I used apple sauce instead of the margarine.  Also I used 1/4 cup sucanut instead of the white sugar and substituted pecans for the walnuts.  I also added more vanilla and butter and coconut extract to help cover the wheat and sucanut flavor.  The result was delicious and even with using dark chocolate chips, (60%) I will probably cup back more of the sugar next time.  They're plenty sweet enough for my family and my tastes.   Thanks for the great recipe!

a more nutty texture- and we didn't use any nuts. I used my wheat grinder and ground some soft white wheat on the finest setting. very comparable to a regular cookie recipe!

Thank you for the idea, but it didn't really work for me.  The ones I took out after 8 minutes were ok, but the others I let cook for longer than that were rock-hard crispy.  Maybe that was my oven, but even with the cripsy factor, the first day, everything tasted fantastic.  In fact, the dough tasted great (yes, I know I shouldn't be eating the dough).  But, more than one day after cooking . . . not good. So hard and not very appetizing.  I will try to make some changes and see if I can modify it to work out for me.

WOW! this are so good, I'm amazed that they come out so soft, being that it's all whole wheat. I used applesauce instead of butter which I was really skeptical about, first time cooking with applesauce but they were just delicious.  Next time I'm going to try them with out the chocolate chips and just make them with nuts to make them more calorie friendly for me.

We loved this recipie!!  I used regular whole wheat flour, added 2 cups of oats and 4tbs of wheat germ ,just for some added fiber and 1/2 cup thinly sliced almonds. They were by far the most delicous cookies I have ever had (family and friends all agree) Give this one a try!

I have a recipe for "Neiman Marcus' oatmeal cookies" and these taste quite similar, but do not take nearly the effort.  I made them with 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup margerine, they turned out okay when they are fresh out of the oven, but became a little hard the next day and needed to be warmed up in the microwave.

These cookies were very good.  My kids really liked them.  I cut the margarine back to a 1/2 cup and substituted a 1/4 cup of applesauce.  I also used a cup of Splenda instead of the white sugar and cut the chocolate chips down to 1 cup. I made 47 cookies which lowered the calorie count down to 70!  Very yummy and half way healthy too!

Simply a fantastic cookie! I took many of the reccomendations from other viewers -I cut both sugars down to 3/4 a cup each, used all whole wheat flour, cut back on the chocolate chips, and real butter. This is now my standard chocolate chip recipe.

I made it using only wheat flour, like some reviewers recommended and will try it again  like the recipe says, because they are good but I would probably like them better if they were closer to the chocolate chip cookies I am used to.

Using whole wheat is a wonderful idea.  I used all whole wheat.  The only problem is that they are far too sweet.  Use fewer chocolate chips and less sugar and it would be so much better.

I made these as bar cookies and the dough seemed really dry. I liked the taste, but not enought to try again. Will keep looking for the perfect whole wheat chocolate chip cookie.

Yum yum yummmm.. I love this one, I tried it before with white wheat, but I found this one with whole wheat and it's even much better!! I followed the recipe as is, didn't use walnuts though, and reduced the amount of butter (or margarine) a little bit, probably by one tbsp. Next time I'll use 1 cup and a 1/2 of chocolate chips instead of two.. I strongly recommend and they came out exactly as I love them; crispy from outside and chewy from the inside..

I didn't have any margarine, so I used butter instead.  I found the dough to be too soft ( I assume this is the fault of the butter), so I ended up pressing it into a 9x9" pan and baking it at 170 degrees Celsius (350F) for 35 minutes.  My Husband quite enjoyed the resulting Chocolate-Chip Squares.  Good balance of taste(s) and texture.  I will make these again.

Great recipe! Made some modifications - used 1/2 cup wholemeal flour in place of all-purpose, 1 banana for the egg, applesauce for the margarine and only 1/2 cup of brown sugar. And 1/2 cup of choc chips and raisins each instead of 1 cup of chips (which was plenty!). Different texture from regular cookies, but loved it! Will try this with nuts and other stuff next time. :)

Very good!!  I used 1 c. of butter, 3/4c. each of brown & white sugar, and I didn't have WW pastry flour, so I used 1c. WW flour and 1c. white WW flour (omitted the AP flour).  Really doesn't taste much different than regular Choc. Chip cookies!  Don't bake them too long - mine were best when they were a bit underbaked and they stayed soft and chewy for days!

They are pretty good cookies, and I did not use any regular flour. Maybe that's why my dought was a little dry, but everything turned out just fine. I baked them for about 14 or 15 minutes because i wasn't sure if they were done. They are not flat, unlike other cookie recipes that i have tried, I like the texture. Will use it again.

I used whole-wheat pastry flour, only one egg, and for half of the sugar...I used all-natural sugar.  I also added some 1/2 c. oatmeal and a spoonful of wheat germ so I cut some of the fat out, and made it even more healthy!

These are tasty and very filling.  If you're used to eating 10 cookies, you'll only be able to eat 3 or 4 of these.  All the taste of "normal" cookies, with a little more health.

I added a half of a cup of applesauce and only used 1/2 cup of butter, but followed the rest of the recipe to a T. It  is a wonderful flavorful chocolate chip cookie. My children who are 4 and 11 absolutely think its the best cookie and I couldn't be happier with the taste and texture of a whole wheat cookie. They are addicting!

This is a great recipe!  I have used it several times.  I use a good quality whole wheat pastry flour, plus the all purpose flour.  I also measure cookies using a scoop so they are all the same size.  Dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips are a must.

Only had whole wheat flour from a small batch mill, mixed special dark chocolate with semi-sweet and added fresh local pecans. Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup each due to dark chocolate chips.  First time I've ever baked cookies and can't wait to bake more.

These turned out nice, crispy and didn't even taste like whole wheat flour! I halved the recipe and pretty much winged it because I didn't have brown sugar or enough whole wheat flour. I also used milk chocolate chips.

For half the serving:

-used all white sugar instead of any brown sugar
-1 and a 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour + a 1/4 cup bread flour
Everything else I just halved and left the same.

I cut the recipe in half as I only had one egg. I used all wheat flour, Splenda granulated, and I added some unsweetened organic coconut. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. For a whole wheat, low sugar cookie, these do the trick. I will make again. I only had to bake mine 8 minutes.

I added about four heaping tablespoons of applesauce to the original recipe to compensate for the amount of flour.  The dough was dry.   The cookies came out great!  Slight crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  The next time however I will use less sugar as they were a tad sweet for me but everyone at the BBQ loved them !

I absolutely love this recipe!  I made these twice in the last week.  The first time I used butter instead of margarine and all whole wheat pastry flour.  Today I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1 1/2 cup carob chips.  I also decreased the sugar 1/4 cups each.  They still turned out AH-MAZ-Zing!!!  You just can't go wrong with this recipe.  LOVE IT!!!

Great recipe! As recommended by other reviewers, I substituted all margarine for applesauce, reduced total sugar by 1/2c., used all whole wheat flour (from the store!), and ended up baking them for longer-about 15-18min (I'm sure it depends on your oven). The cookies turned out perfectly moist, chewy in the middle and a little crunchy at the edges. Checked the nutrition info on this recipe with my changes (this recipe made 41 cookies for me), and each cookie is only 100 calories and 3g. fat!

I have tried many whole wheat cookie recipes and this seems to taste almost exactly like the white wheat cookies! YUM! I just used 1 cup of cane sugar instead of the brown and white sugar. 2 teaspoons of vanilla makes it even yummier :)

My husband has always been a "meh" chocolate chip cookie kind of guy. But these are so loved in the house that he goes out of his way to brag about them to his co-workers and friends.  Of which now they all love them too.  We use whole grain fresh ground flour instead of the pastry flour and just add a touch more white flour to balance the lightness of the fresh ground flour.

Very good! The wheat pastry flour gives them a unique flavor. I made some with and without the walnuts and some with  both chocolate and peanut butter chips. Everyone loved them!

These cookies are delicious! My three young sons RAVED about them and want to "trade them for all the candy in the world." I used two-thirds whole wheat (not pastry) flour and one-third all purpose white flour, and I didn't sift. I also traded 1/3 of the margarine for 0%-fat Greek yogurt and used Smart Balance for the rest. Mine cooked on a lower rack for about 11 minutes. We'll definitely be making these again, and again, and again.

This is the first time I have used solely whole wheat flour for choc chip cookies. Normally mine turn out flat, but not these. They are look perfect and taste really good too. I used 3c whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 c + 1/3 c brown and white sugars. Will definately use this recipe again and next time add a little applesauce and/or pecans :)

Like the other reviewers said, cut down on the sugar.  I used my standard baking mix of roughly 2/3 whole wheat and 1/3 oat flour (both fresh ground), turbinado sugar for the sugar and it turned out great.

I'm surprised!  I didn't think I would like a cake-like cookie. I used only whole wheat flour (3 cups). I used a larger than average chocolate chip (Ghirardelli Bittersweet) and think next time I'll use mini-sized or normal sized chips. I will also only put in 1 to 1 1/4 chips. I had extra in the bottom of the mixing bowl. The dough is stiff, but the cookie is very good. Also, used Splenda. Thanks for the recipe.

For a "healthy" cookie these were great! The batter seemed a bit stiff & the cookies didn't quite flatten out on their own (I spoon-flattened the first batch halfway through cooking & pressed the 2nd batch down with my hands before baking), but other than that I was delighted. Got mixed reviews in my household; my mom & I loved them (we are health/wheat freaks) but my sister & dad  simply tolerated them. I halved the recipe & used 1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 tbsp warm water in place of the egg. Also, I used evaporated cane juice instead of white sugar, and the granules are a little bigger than white sugar. I think this might be why the batter was a bit dry; the larger granules perhaps absorb more liquid? I have this problem quite often when making cookies, maybe next time I'll increase the liquids. All in all a great starter recipe!

Very good recipe, even though I made with applesauce and whole wheat flour (non-pastry flour). They still turned out wonderful! I also used 2/3 of the sugar and 1 cup chocolate chips and they were great. And you don't feel *quite* as guilty after eating 3 of them! =)

I have been into a healthier diet during the last months. And even though a chocolate chip cookie is a chocolate chip cookie, it's much better knowing I'm getting the goodness of whole wheat. I love this recipe. I added half semi sweet and half white chocolate chips, and of course walnuts. I didn't rate 5 stars because it seemed a little dry for me. I also used butter instead of margarine. Thanks for posting this recipe! I'm definitely making it again!

I needed to use up some whole wheat pastry flour and tried these cookies.  Although tasty the dough was a bit dry and the cookies ended up rather crumbly.  I had to shape them by hand after the first two sheet-fulls cooked up in exactly the ball shape they were spooned onto the sheet in.  I used butter instead of margarine and really whipped up the eggs into the sugar and butter mixture, so I don't know why they were so heavy.

I've been making these for years now, as a cookie base for chocolate chips, M&Ms, monster cookies, etc.  I always use 3c. whole wheat white instead of 2c. ww and one cup white, and I butter, not margarine.  If the dough is a little goopy when I am putting the cookies on the sheet to bake, I add a little more WW flour to the mix.  Sometimes, I leave out 1/2c flour and use All Bran.  If I make M&M cookies, I use less sugar.  Use a mini ice cream scoop to drop them and you will get a perfect cookie every time.

AWESOME COOKIES!  I usually try to make things as healthy as possible, so I made these with Smart Balance Butter Blend (stick type spread)instead of butter, Splenda instead of white sugar, and organic brown sugar.  I used only half the amount of chocolate chips called for, and the full amount of chopped walnuts.  Next time I will cut back even more on the chocolate chips. The dough was so thick that I had difficulty stirring it with my wooden spoon.  I was tempted to add another egg, but I'm glad I didn't as the cookies turned out so great.  I flattened them just slightly before baking.  They spread out to about double their size, so don't put them too close together. One other thing is that I noticed a big difference between my two insulated cookie sheets.  One has a dark brown no-stick finish and the other has an aluminum colored finish.  This probably doesn't have anything to do with the recipe, but the dark finish produced a MUCH nicer cookie.

I would have given 5 stars if i would have followed the recipe exactly.  I know this recipe wasn't "for" me with my store bought flour but I used all whole wheat store bought flour and they were perfect and wonderful. This is my new chocolate chip cookie recipe, thank you!

I substituted 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup dry lowfat yogurt for the margerine, and these turned out so yummy.  I have added wheat germ to chocolate chip cookies before, but I like the texture and flavor of the wheat flour best.

These were suprisingly good for whole wheat.  I didn't use any white flour but I may next time.  I also accidentally left out the nuts and I definitely will next time.  These are the first chocolate chip cookies that I have ever made that didn't go flat.  This is a keeper.

Um, yummm!  These were good.  I used 1c butter instead of the marg and didn't have walnuts or the pastry flour, but was good with the ww/w flour blend.  Will definitely make again.  Thought they may be too sweet when trying the dough, but that was just crazy talk- no such thing as too sweet think it was just the texture difference sneaking through vs the traditional choc chip cookie dough.  Great recipe!

Not very good. These cookies tasted more like whole wheat bread to me. I followed everything in the recipe except the white sugar. I used white splenda instead.

I used 2.5 cups of wheat flour, and 0.5 cup of white, and they turned out fabulous.  I also only included 1.5 cups of chocolate chips and added a bit more vanilla.  I plan on giving these out as gifts to my neighbors, they were that good!

This is a great recipe, with the added feel-good element of whole-wheat flour. The texture is just perfect when the cookies are fresh. I did reduce the sugar quantities - I used 3/4 c. for each of brown and white sugar. The sweetness was perfect. I also reduced the amount of chocolate chips as suggested by someone. My husband, is not a cookie kinda guy, said that  this was the best chocolate chip cookie he had ever tasted. So this recipe is definitely a keeper in our kitchen! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this on a Sunday and they were gone before you knew it.  They had a unique nutty flavor with the whole wheat flour and my family loved them.

These cookies turned out excellent!  The flavour was wonderful!  The only thing I didn't like was that they ended up a little too hard by the next day, but they were still a big hit.  In my oven I had to bake them for a much shorter time and at a cooler temperature.

These cookies came out MUCH better than I ever expected! I've tried making cookies using whole wheat flour & they always came out like hard cardboard. This recipe is WONDERFUL!! Instead of dropping them by teaspoons on the cookie sheet, I rolled them into about 1/2 the size of a golf ball & they were perfect bite sized pieces! Thanks!

This was a great recipe.  Using the whole wheat makes you think that you are eating healthy, but its still a chocolate chip cookie.  This is a great recipe if you are tired of basic chocolate chip cookies.
