Elsewhere I've seen this trifle called "Black Forest Trifle".  This recipe is much better (IMO) if you use brownies, cut into 1" squares.  Also, mix the pie cherries with approx. 1/2 Cup berry juice (the brownies then absorb the flavor better), change out the chocolate pudding mixture with white chocolate (mix according to pkg instructions, but fold in 8 ounces of whipped topping).  

So, the layers go like this:  1/2 brownies on the bottom, 1/2 cherries next, 1/2 pudding/topping mixture next.  Repeat layers.  Top with chocolate curles or shavings.  HUGE hit with my family!

Made this for my daughter's graduation dinner (returned to college after 20 years).  Easy & fun to put together.  Assembled mine in old fashioned ice cream glasses.

Easy to make and earned "wows" for presentation.  However, flavor seems to be lacking for me.  Next time I will add few drops of vanilla to the pudding/whipped cream layer and add layer of toffee bits for some crunch.

I have made this several times for church and it is soooo good! Also easy and serves a lot while looking fancy.  I will make it again, for sure!

Made it for a dinner and got rave reviews. I think it would be tasty with other pie fillings as well (blueberry or saskatoon). Very easy and delicious!
