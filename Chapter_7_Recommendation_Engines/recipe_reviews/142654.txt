I had never cooked with figs before last week, and this was one of my first attempts. This is a good recipe, but it needs to be developed further. The sauce doesn't have much of a taste, and I would prefer the chicken to have more of a crust. Thanks for a great starting point, though!

I tried this because I thought a port wine sauce on chicken sounded good, but no one in my house liked this one.  The sauce was nearly flavorless and the chicken didn't fully cook in 15 minutes.  Next time I want port wine sauce I will make it from the beef tenderloin with roasted shallots recipe even though it takes more effort.

I would have given this recipe a five star rating but I disagreed with the dry figs. I used a pint of fresh figs from the bounty of summer. The juices from the fresh figs lent great flavor & color to the dish . I also thicken the sauce with about a tablespoon of flour for a better consistency. Raves all around.

This is such a simple recipe but so delicious and perfect for an elegant dinner. I sliced my chicken breasts so they would cook faster but that was the only change. Paired it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed Brussels sprouts for variety in textures and some color.
