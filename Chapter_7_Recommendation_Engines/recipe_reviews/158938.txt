This was lunch today. HUGE hit with the kids. I made one small change and I drizzled honey over the top of the banana. The kids went nuts for it. Great way to use overripe bananas and make a quick lunch on a busy day. I like to make these with almond butter or Nutella, too. I'll try this with cinnamon swirl bread next time.

Cute and creative! This was a really great snack for kids and kids of all ages. You can also use leftover hot dog rolls in a pinch. I love the combination of peanut butter and banana plus you can jazz this up by adding some raisins, mini marshmallows or mini chocolate chips and drizzling with honey or chocolate syrup. Definitely have a tall glass of milk close by....

These are wonderful as breakfast, snack or a light lunch. To make cinnamon-raisin peanut butter, just stir 1/2 cup raisins, 2T sugar and 3t cinnamon into a 16oz jar of peanut butter. Also, make sure the bread is soft and bendable.

I made this for the kids one hot spring afternoon. They were leary of the name...ha ha ha...but were pleasantly surprised at how good these were! It was very quick and easy to make; meanwhile fairly healthy. I used ALL organic ingredients and whole wheat gluten free bread. Delicious!

I grew up on peanut butter and banana sandwiches, but my oldest didn't like the idea of them. When I found this I thought it would be a perfect way to get him to try my favorite childhood sandwich. Needless to say he loved it! Thanks for such a cute idea.

I also do this with hot dog buns (especially if some are left over). It is very easy for a little one to hold that way.

Wow I'm not the only one.. I like mine on toasted whole wheat bread with peanut butter I get from the health food store where they have a machine that grinds the peanuts fresh then I slice up a banana to top it off. A great way to start the day!

Why I had not done this before I don't know.  This is perfect!  It made me think of Elvis and his fried peanut butter sandwiches.

I was a bit afraid when I saw the name of this recipe and was pleasantly surprised to see my good old breakfast staple. It's about the fastest on the go breakfast around. Glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks so.

Thanks so much for the idea.  So Simple, yet most people think about slicing the bananas and never think hey just leave it whole.  This is great on cinnamon raison bread.  My two year old loved it.  His three favorite things Bread, peanut butter and nanas...In a easy to carry, easy to eat bundle.

I make this all the time. It's my go-to for a quick lunch or snack. I make it with one piece of bread so the banana hangs off the ends, plus my name for it is just "Banana Dog".

My 3 year old loves peanut butter sandwiches and she loves bananas, so I thought she's love this fun twist on a hot dog. Unfortunately, she didn't like the banana in the sandwich. She was happy to eat the banana and the peanut butter sandwich once she separated them. Go figure!

Make as is. Don't take anyone's advise and pour honey or chocolate or anything that would take this healthy snack and turn it into an unhealthy one. It tastes great as is plus your not putting junk in front of your kids.

My son doesn't eat meat and this is perfect for him to join in when everyone is having hot dogs he loves it.
