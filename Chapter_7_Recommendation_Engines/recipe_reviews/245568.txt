Love the combo of the ingredients, but like others, thought it would be a bit bland - we're from South Texas and love our spice -. So topped this perfect bowl  with chile lime vinaigrette, also from this site. YUM YUM.   I used this dressing to marinate the chicken breasts as well. This is a perfect pairing. Thanks so much for this recipe

Naked Chicken Burrito Bowl Haiku: "Chicken pretty bland, but the bowl 'guts' jazzed it up. Not the quickest meal." I love Chipotle, but don't have one near me and whenever I go to one, the line's always out the door, so I was happy to try this recipe in re-creating their bowls. The chicken and the rice here really need a zip - a marinade, or additional seasoning b/c ultimately, this recipe's only as tasty as your salsa (or if the black beans you use are a pre-seasoned brand.) I did everything as directed, even using my George Foreman too, and when every single thing was scooped into my mouth, it was tasty, but all separate ingredients were kind of 'yawn.' I think I'd make this again, but possibly as a do-ahead casserole style, but definitely w/ the chicken marinated, or cilantro/lime added to rice.

This is a great idea - everyone loved it.  I'm sure it's great with chicken but we were tired of chicken so I cooked ground beef with taco seasoning as one option and then  chopped up some chicken sausage and sauteed that as the 2nd option. I laid all the ingredients out and let everyone make their own bowls to their liking. It was a big hit - will definitely do this again and will try the chicken.

Wow! Have had this recipe saved for a while now. I was looking for burrito inspirations while in the grocery store and this popped back up in my life. Problem was I was crunched for time had 1 hour to cook and feed the clan so I decided to improvise only 1 small thing.... Rotisserie chicken pre-made for me by  my grocery store and decided to warm t up in a skillet with a little taco seasoning for 10 minutes. The rest was exactly as written. This recipe allows for significant leftovers which I love!!! I first made burrito bowls then with left overs made burritos and for 2nd day I made some soft tacos adding and deleting a few condiments along the way to switch it up a bit.

We Arizonans love our spice like Texans, so here's what I did.  I used Taco Seasoning instead of garlic powder and salt on the chicken, Pepper Jack instead of Monterey Jack, sliced one green onion and added after the lettuce, and mixed Taco Sauce with the sour cream to make it more like a dressing.  A great recipe made a bit spicier, thank you for submitting it!

This was amazing!  A wonderful blend of flavors.  The only improvements I can think of would be a squeeze of lime juice and a sprinkle of cilantro.

We used pinto beans because we didn't have black beans and added sriracha mayo to add some more flavor but would've preferred southwest ranch. And cilantro is a must. Very yummy!
