I just won my office's chili cook off with this recipe.  Like others I substituted spicy Italian sausage for the ground beef and I diced the pepperoni.  We also added chopped green bell pepper as others suggested.  We also upped the chili powder a little.

This was a fantastic chili!  I make chili once a year for my job'a annual chili cook off and I tried this one and it was the only crock pot to be emptied and I won - easily.  Very easy to prepare and tasty - and I don't even like chili!  This is a repeater!

When I first looked her, two of five reviewers here won first place in their chili cook-offs. Imagine my surprise when my Italian Chili also won First Place! That was against seven other chilis with 21 tasters and mine was the first one served! By the way, I only made the chili once before to prep for the contest. I let it 'slow' cook for 12 hours till the 1 pm contest time and it was great. For the contest I added one long green pepper, one green pepper, more mushrooms, one Mild Italian sausage link. The rest was per the recipe. Comments were: nice texture, surprising to find pepperoni salami, great sauce taste, the mushrooms were a nice addition, sauce just hot enough.

This was very good and very different from the standard chili - which is what I was after!  I did change a few things and used spicy italian sausage in place of the beef, fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned, more chili powder, added about a teaspoon of cumin, a couple of tablespoons of minced garlic,  and used pepparoni sausages which were diced instead of using slices of them.  Also threw in a chopped green bell pepper and some red pepper flakes.  I cooked this in the slow cooker (cooking the meat, pepper and onion the night before) and came home to a great meal.  Even a friend, who normally hates chili, gave this one two thumbs up.  Thanks, I am sure I'll try this one again when in need of something chili - with a twist!

Delicious and different!  I made this because I didn't want to have to live up to a family member's traditional style chili that we all rave about.  I figured this would be a great compromise.  I've made this a few times now.  My husband requests it often.  I usually make a double batch, but I use half ground beef & half sweet Italian sausage.  I use fresh mushrooms, and add extra, because the mushrooms are really stand-out in this recipe. I've used 1 can kidney and 1 can cannellini beans, but I think I'm switching to all cannellini, because they really are terrific with these flavors.  Now my family thinks of this as MY chili and it's not just the other family member whose praises are sung!

I was really excited when I read this recipe. This was my first time making chili but all of the ingredients sounded great.    I made this in the crock pot, let it cook for 8 hours. I added garlic. These 2 things are the only differences, otherwise I made the recipe as instructed.  My husband and I both felt that this did not feel like chili. It felt like an awesome spaghetti sauce instead.    It is also mild (but tasty), so if you decide to make this and desire spicy you'll want to add some extra kick to this.  I am sad that we feel this way because all of the other reviews made me extra excited for this. Sorry though... next time I make it I'm gonna leave out the beans and pour it over noodles. Maybe it's just us, but that's how we felt.

I loved this recipe! It gave a nice twist on the same old chili recipe. Also, my son - who is 10 - usually doesn't want to eat the regular chili, but gobbles this up. I did enter this in a contest (there were 25 other contestants) and everyone, especially the kids, loved it. Thanks!

This was a great recipe!  I do not eat chili, but I make it for my company's annual chili cook off.  This is only the 2nd pot of chili I have ever made!  And out of 14 pots including some from local restaraunts, I won first place!  Eveyone asked for this recipe!

My mother used to make a dish very similar and it was everyone's favorite!  This was delicious.  It is definitly different than your average chili, but very good. I will definitely make this again.  Don't pass this up, you will love it, too.

I love this!  I added 3 cloves of garlic and used diced pepperoni.  It's definitely different from a typical chili which I love - it means I can make both without chili overload.

Very good. I had to leave out the pepperoni because I didn't have it. I used 2 TB taco seasoning instead of the chili powder for more flavor. I will probably try this again with italian sausage and pepperoni and the taco seasoning. Another great recipe to jazz up dollar store spaghetti sauce.

Excellent!  Easy to make and very tasty.  To suit our personal tastes, I added some green bell pepper, garlic and extra chili powder. Thanks for sharing!

I have to admit when I saw the ingredients I was a little skeptical. Boy was I wrong! I actually made this because I needed a left over ground beef recipe. This is delish! We had it for dinner, and I actually hid the leftovers in the back of the refridge so I could have it for lunch the next day. Very good recipe. Tangy and hearty.
Will not dissapoint!

I came across this recipe when I was looking for something to do with extra spaghetti sauce.  I left out the ground beef and used dehydrated minced onion, so used a lot less, but otherwise tried to keep it the same ingredients.  This is quite good, and so easy.  I sliced up the pepperoni and fried it briefly to get rid of a lot of the grease; I'd definitely recommend that!  Otherwise, it would've been too much grease in this.  Overall, a nice, different chili that's great for a winter night with sandwiches or just bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this often as it is quick and easy, healthy and tastes great.  I use a whole pkg of veggie "pepperoni" and an additional can of beans but otherwise follow the recipe.  A nice change from the usual Tex-Mex chili I make and my whole family thinks it's just great.  Thanks!

My daughter and I loved this chili.   I doubled the recipe and the only change I made was to use 1 pd ground beef and 1 pd spicy sausage.  I cooked in a crockpot for a few hours.   Definitely will make again.

It was ok for something different but I have to agree with the lady who said it was more like a spaghetti sauce not like a chili.  I will try like her and serve over noodles next time.

Really good variation of the standard chili! A couple of changes:I doubled the chili powder, used pound of fresh sliced mushrooms, added 2TBS of minced garlic and added some red pepper flakes. I simmered on the stove for 1 1/2 hours.

I was fairly disappointed in this recipe.  Like other reviewers, I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  The resulting chili was pretty standard, hence the three stars.  It wasn't bad but it was nothing special.  Certainly nothing that I would have expected to win a chili cook-off.

This seemed like a good chili for a cold, snowy day.  It was a hit with family and friends.  I used fresh mushrooms and will add chopped bell pepper next time.  My husband said, "hang on to this recipe"!  It's a keeper.

When I tasted this on the stove I wasn't sure I was even going to be able to eat it, but it does get better the longer it cooks. The cheese really helps also, even though the recipe forgets to tell you to add it. This would be a lot better without the sugar, because spaghetti sauce already has sugar in it, so this became way too sweet for our tastes.

I just finished serving it!  I never made homemade chili!  And everytime I would eat it at resaurants, I wasn't too thrilled about the taste..This was very good.  I did increase the chili powder and sugar amount..a dash here and there...I will never order chili again...I will make it at home....

Very tasty!  I served it w/Garlic Bread and sour cream, and we both had seconds - and very pleasingly stuffed!  Will definately be a repeat due to ease and flavor!

I too used this recipe for a chili cook off and I won the people's choice award!!!  I've since made it several times and enjoy it every time.  

Regarding substitutions, I think I've added spicy hot italian sausage in place of one of the beefs (I was doubling the recipe).  Also, I've added hot sauce to taste to give it a bit more zip.  

Other than that, it is a great recipe and I highly recommend it!!!

I followed the recipe and squelched my usual tendency to modify a recipe, so I could get a good sense of this recipe as-is.  The only variation was to use a slow-cooker.  The result was good, but unexceptional.  I will probably keep looking for a better recipe, but if you'd like to try this one I'd recommend using italian sausage rather than ground beef.

I made this one night when I had some ground beef and spaghetti sauce to use but didn't want to make pasta. I made a number of changes (added fresh chopped green pepper and mushrooms, omitted the pepperoni and bouillon as well as the canned mushrooms, and spiced it to taste) but the basic recipe is a very good one and my family really enjoyed it. In fact, they have asked for it again! Also, I found it really did not need the water, but perhaps we enjoy our chili thicker than others.

This has become a staple in our household.  My wife absolutely LOVES it!!  I changed it up just a bit after reading the other posts.  I added Itallian sausage rather than hamburger.  Also, since we are not a huge fan of beans in our chili, I left these out.  I have made this recipe for family gatherings and potlucks.  It's a crowd favorite!!

My 2 year old loved this -- it struck me as a nice hearty pasta sauce  -- with kidney beans.  I must be missing the point, but I won't repeat this recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because of my 2 year olds enthusiasm.

WOW - this is a DELICIOUS!  Like some of the others, I added a green pepper and some garlic.  This one's still simmering on the stove, but I can't keep my "tasting spoon" out of the pot!  Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe - we will be enjoying this again and again.
UPDATE: I microwave the sliced pepperoni between 2 paper towels for about 30 seconds to absorb some of the oil.  We heat this in the slow cooker on low for a few hours to let everything meld together.  Yum!

Keeping a Kosher kitchen, and wanting it to be a little healthier, I used 1 lb of ground turkey in place of beef, low sodium marinara sauce in place of 3 cheese sauce and 6 ounces of sliced, fresh mushrooms in place of canned mushrooms, 1 tsp beef boullion powder + 1 Tbsp worcestershire sauce in place of 1 Tbsp beef bouillion, and 3 oz sliced and chopped Kosher Kielbassa (meal mart brand) in place of pepperoni, I was also mindufl to purchase reduced sodium canned kidney beans. I omitted the cheese garnish and garnished instead with scallions and diced red and white onions. I found that these changes reduced the fat and sodium content of the dish considerably. The flavor was still amazing.

I left out the pepperoni and mushrooms.  In doubling the recipe, I added sausage with the beef and both black and red kidney beans.

I haven't written a review in a LONG time, but felt I had to with this one.  On paper it just doesn't look very good but it's awesome! Never would have made this if I didn't have some opened (but just a small amount used) spaghetti sauce in the fridge (the tomato and basil variety btw). I did substitute a can of black beans for the kidney because that's all I had. Also added a teaspoon of salt. Otherwise, I left things alone and was thoroughly impressed by how good it was. I haven't been this surprised by a recipe in quite some time. Love it!

Just cause you add beans, don't call this chili. Drop the beans and call it spaghetti sauce. I added hot italian sausage, green peppers and jalapenos. Very good sauce...but not chili. Drop the beans, add garlic and all the rest and cook noodles.

This is my very favorite chili recipe ever! Last night for the first time I made it with leftover homemade spaghetti sauce and it turned out great as well! Just an all around wonderful recipe. :)

This is FABULOUS! I made it once as no bean chili and once I served it over spaghetti noodles. Both times it was devoured by my family. I do add a little extra chili powder (and even some pureed yellow peppers when I have them), and I leave out the mushrooms as well. Easy to make and delicious. :)

I made this with Boca veggie crumbles and added a can of great northern beans too.  I used Barilla sweet pepper tomato sauce.  Topped with Parmesan & cheddar.  It was awesome!

We really loved this! Like many others who reviewed this recipe, I  won our Supper Club chili cookoff with this, as it was so different from the usual kind of chili. Doubled the recipe and moved it to a crockpot to cook for a few hours, changed the meat to 1 lb mild Italian sausage/1 lb spicy...titled it "Fix it and Fuhgedaboudit" (title of chili counted in the judging criteria ; ) - thanks for the new favorite!

This was a great recipe. I made it for a church picnic and received a many compliments. I was a bit disappointed. I expected it to be a bit more spicy when everything was cooked together. Next time I will find some ways to add some extra spice.

Thanks to this recipe and the wonderful people who reviewed it and offered suggestions, I also won my company's Chili Cook-off.  I won by a landslide and in every category.  I used both ground beef and italian susauge.  I added about a tablespoon of minced garlic and a teaspoon of cumin.
