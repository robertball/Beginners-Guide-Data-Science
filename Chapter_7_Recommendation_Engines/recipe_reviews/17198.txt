OMG!  This was the best tasting casserole EVER.  The olives is what gives it that special flavor.  I reduced the amount of sour cream for my husband and I also added mushrooms!  I steamed the broccoli and mushrooms first.  Instead of cubing or cutting the chicken, I used the Cuisinart (every chef should have one!).  It shredded the chicken and the consistency in the dish was flourished in every bite. I also used the Cuisinart for the steamed mushrooms and the olives.  I totally nixed the curry because I heard many bad things about it; the taste and smell and read one review about how they had to throw it out.  I also found a suggestion to put smashed croutons on top. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it and my daughter even had 2nds! Be careful, it's addicting! We froze the leftovers and Lisa is right, the leftovers are even better. I gave some leftovers to my Mother-in-Law and freind at work and they just couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  Make it today!
YUMMY!!!!

I liked this dish but next time I will change it a little. I thought it tasted a little too much like sourcream so I will put more cream of chicken and less sourcream for sure. I will also make sure and cook the broccoli well before putting it in the pasta. And I would put more cheddar cheese in pasta and maybe top with shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled ritz crackers. YUM

After reading others' advice, I ended up leaving out the curry and cooking the pasta separately to serve the casserole on top of. I also substituted cream of mushroom soup since others mentioned liking mushrooms in it. I wish I had used frozen broccoli - the fresh broccoli did not cook in 30 minutes. I ended up having to cook it for another 20 minutes covered. Overall, it's a really tasty recipe!

I was concerned about a dry casserole, but thought I would try it.  It was very, very good.  The combination of soups and sour cream make for a very moist and delicious casserole.  I will definately make this one again.

I used ziti instead of egg noodles & halved the sour cream, but it was still yummy. I added an extra dose of curry, since some said it was bland.... MMMmmmm

WOW, this is really good mama, said my hubby and then my 6 children all agreed!  Didn't use the curry and used garlic powder instead of clove.  Also, made it in the crock pot did the chicken for 3 hours and then added all the rest.  LOVED IT...

We really liked this recipe. I cooked the brocolli, added half the curry to the sour cream and added 1/4 cup of milk to the sour cream mixture, also used penne instead of egg noodles. Very creamy and rich and couldn't imagine this dish with egg noodles. Will make again.

This is a great recipe.  I'm not a fan of curry powder so the second time I made it I eliminated that ingredient and added 1/2 medium onion, chopped - lightly sauteed with the garlic and added to the noodles.  It was a great hit at a recent potluck I attended.

I've love cheesy, vegetabley casseroles but it always seems like it so much processed food.  Canned chicken, processed cheese.  Nothing about that is real food!  This recipe hits the spot on convenience and taste while allowing me to control what ingredients go into it!  Bravo!!  I used 2 large chicken breasts seasoned with Mrs. Dash Original and Olive Oil, sauteed until cooked through then diced.  For the broccoli, I opted for a Birds Eye steamfresh Broccoli/Carrot/Cauliflower blend which cooks perfectly in the microwave.  Combined that with all other ingredients as listed with an exception on the sour cream.  I only had about 1/2 cup (all I had) but I'm glad I didn't have more.  This was perfect!  Another 1&1/2 cup would have been entirely too much.  I also topped with more shredded cheese and light dusting of breadcrumbs.  This was superb!!  Very simple!!  Time from the very start until I set the table was roughly 1h but 30min of that is in the oven. Not too shabby!!  I will be making this one again!

My family really enjoyed this.  I did end up putting 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, and I also added sauteed mushrooms.  I think that added a lot of flavor.  Next time I'll put 2 cloves of garlic.  Thanks!

This recipe is yummy.  I read most of the reviews of others and I agree to leave the curry out.....unless you REALLY like it.  Also, I added LOTS more cheese - more parmesan and a cheese blend called "casserole cheese."  I used frozen broccoli and steamed it before placing it in the dish.  It worked fine.  I also added some cornbread stuffing bread crumbs on top.  (Pepperidge Farm)  I think I like it without the noodles and next time I will use more bread crumbs instead of noodles as the starch.  Also, the recipe was looking kinda dry to me in the dish so I mixed some milk and water together and re stirred it while in the dish.  This REALLY helped.  Great recipe overall!

Good, but I left out the olives because I don't like them. I used frozen broccoli, and since I didn't have enough egg noodles, I used fettucini instead. I went a little light on the sour cream (used about 1.5 cups of fat-free), and then I added a soup can full of skim milk. The end result was good-- my husband called it "Curry Alfredo." I'll probably make this again.

Followed recipe exactly it was great. I made sure noodles and broccoli were cooked before I mixed everything together and put in the oven. I love curry so it came out fine. If you don't like curry you shouldn't try it. Husband loved it. Maybe next time I may use less fattening ingredients.

Really good! My husband and I ate leftovers all week, so good. I used low fat sour cream and whole wheat rotini for a lighter option.

This was certainly not worth the time or calories.  I had to bake it an extra 10 minutes just to heat it through.  I won't make this again.

Pretty good!  I left out the olives, doubled the garlic, cooked the broccoli before adding it, and mixed in half the curry with the sour cream.  The curry on top gives it a yellow tinge that looks great with the broccoli.  It seemed just barely on the dry side; I might add 1/4-1/2 c milk next time.

My husband liked this better than I did. Otherwise I would've given this a two-star rating. I added MORE curry instead of leaving it out because this dish was so lacking in flavor, it was incredible. Added fresh ground black pepper, onion, more chedder and parmesan and it still was just so blah. Topped with crushed Ritz crackers and shredded parmesan cheese and that was a bad idea because it just layed there and remained dry crushed crumbs. Also, the prep time was ridiculous even though I cooked a bag of broccoli with the noodles.

I made this with a pound of egg noodles instead of half a pound (didn't read the directions carefully enough) and it was really good, obviously there was so much leftover!

I didn't add the Curry (don't like it), I added an extra cup of cheese to the top and crumbled ritz crackers and this was really good!

I also used a bag of frozen Broccoli.

Next time I will make it with the correct amount of Egg Noodles to see if there is a different flavor.

I will make this again for sure!

I like this for a change from a basic chicken casserole. You must like curry to appreciate this recipe. An interesting and pleasing combination. Easy, too!

I left out the olives on accident and it was still a great dish.  I threw the broccoli in with my pasta for about five minutes to soften it up and the texture came out nicely in the casserole.  Very versatile recipe, which is always nice.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a delicious recipe. I added a bit more cheese than the recipe called for. The black olives are a really nice addition. I would never have thought to put them in a casserole. I'll make this again for sure. I would maybe suggest baking it covered to keep it moist.

Ok, I knew when I decided to make this that I would not be adding curry. (I do not like it and neither does my family.)Honestly, do not use so many bowls. Here's what I did. I had some freshly ground chicken, so I browned it in a skillet with 1 clove minced garlic, kosher salt, pepper, and some onion powder, then put it in a big, deep bowl to cool. I then cooked the noodles and broccoli florets in the same skillet. While they were cooking, I added everything else to the chicken. I added more minced garlic, too. Then I put it all together, and put it in the pan to bake. Our youngest child is the pickiest kid on the planet and it was still gobbled right up! Thanks for this one - it's a keeper!

We liked this... I've tried similiar recipes though and felt that this was missing something!  Some recipes call for half mayo, half sour cream.  I may try that when I make it next time.  I mixed everything in one bowl not three!  I put the butter in the baking dish while the oven heated then topped it with my noodles and broccoli which I par-boiled.  Stirred together then added all the other ingredients on top, mixing in a bit of curry and also sprinkling some on top...  Like I said, it was good, but still needed something in my opinion!

Made this recipie healthy, so i left out butter noodles and olives. Basically just made the sour cream+Parm+Cheddar topping, ad layered that all over my chicken alongside broccoli. It was delicious, this recipie gave me a new twist for fat free sour cream

This was delicious! I used tri-colored rotini instead of the shells which added beautiful color.  I also got lazy and used the frozen broccoli.  But my fiancee and I loved it!  Served with garlic bread and went back for more!

Four out of our 6 really liked this.  It was a good comfort food for mid-winter.  I was afraid the combination of ingredients would be too different, but it turned out good.

Liked this one.  Although I didn't put in olives as I don't like them and didn't add curry either.  I turned up the heat for the last 10 minutes to make the top really crunchy with added to the taste.

I was very disappointed with how this recipe turned out. My husband and I both thought it was very bland. I cooked the chicken in garlic and onion and only used half the sour cream. We ate it, but no one had seconds and the leftovers were thrown out.

This was an "OK" dish.  The flavors of the chicken, broc, and noodles got lost, and was a bit on the mushy side.  No one went for seconds at our house!

This was WONDERFUL!! My boyfriend made it for us and we ate the whole thing in 2 days! He didn't use the curry powder and he cooked the chicken in garlic. And he used extra olives because I LOVE black olives!! He will definitely make this again!

This was very delicious!  I am a picky eater and it's hard to find recipes that I really like, but this one is great!  It took a little while to prepare, but it was worth it!  If you don't like your broccoli crunchy, steam it first.

I already had the chicken breast cooked so it was pretty easy to throw together.  I didn't cook the broccoli first and wished that I had.  It was a little too crunchy for me, but my husband loved it!

This is a good recipe.  Next time I might use less sour cream and maybe add a bit of mayonnaise to compensate.  It was a bit much on the sour cream otherwise - it was tasty.

Awesome! I added about 5 tablespoons of the seasoned broth from cooking the chicken when I added the soup. I also used 12oz of noodles instead of 8...so I used 1/4 lb more chicken. I layered crushed corn flakes on top and drizzled with butter for an awesome crunchy top! I think I will add some jack cheese the next time I make it! I think it would be good!

This was very tasty!  I made a few changes though, but nothing drastic.  I didn't have any curry powder, so I left that off.  Instead of one clove of garlic, I used two cloves and I also boiled my broccoli with my noodles before hand.  It needed to be cooked longer than the recipe stated, but that may be my oven or just how I felt.  Also, don't use three bowls to mix this!  Just use one.  There is no point!  I also used light sour cream and healthy request cream of chicken soup and it was still very tasty and cuts down on the fat.

Wow, this turned out even better than expected, and I only had 1/2 Cheddar on hand.  I can't wait to make it with the full cup.  I pre-cooked frozen broccoli and everything was cooked well and SO tasty!  Definitely a keeper.

My family LOVED this dish.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and in place of curry powder (which we don't like) I sprinkled thyme, marjerum, and basil.  I added a bit of milk so it wouldn't be dry.  I think it's the olives that make this broccoli/chicken casserole unique from all the rest.  It added just a dash of 'something different' and even my teenagers who don't like olives, liked this dinner! I will definitely make this again! :)

I really liked this recipe.  I forgot to buy the curry but added other spices and it was really good.  I added lots of broccoli and chicken and it was really filling.  My neighbors were over for dinner and between the 4 of us, there weren't any leftovers.  Will add to my recipes and make again.

Delicious with crushed butter crackers on top. Black olives definiatly add that little something - will add more than recipe calls for next time. Curry is not necessary, especially if it isn't one of your favorite things. Can also substitute plain yogurt for sour cream if you're looking for a healthy alternative.

Pretty good recipe but maybe a little too much sour cream- kind of overpowers the rest of the flavors.... next time I'll try cutting it down to 1 cup or so.

Creamy and good but takes a long time and a lot of ingredients.  Did not add curry.  Not my favorite chicken broccoli casserole but we ate it.

This is an easy, delicious recipe, and extremely customizable.  I was looking for a way to use some  canned chicken, but didn't have the right quantities to make 2 lbs. I used one 12.5 oz can chicken breast meat, and one 5 oz can white and dark turkey meat, which was only a little bit more than one lb.  I added a small can mushroom pieces since the reviews said they were good in it.   I used 900 grams frozen broccoli, not fresh.  I doubled the garlic, mincing two cloves.  I did used the curry powder, stirring it into the entire mix, but I felt the dish lacked some pizazz.  I added a tablespoon of homemade garlic paste, and that was just what it needed.  It turned out delicious.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except skipped the curry powder since I didn't have any and decreased the sour cream by about a 1/4 cup.  It seemed like it was missing something, but agree that the black olives are a nice addition.

Really good base recipe that you can fine tune to your own liking....like many, I cut back a bit on the sour cream, eliminated the curry powder, added sauteed mushrooms. I also topped the casserole with 3/4 cup of panko bread crumbs that I toasted in a pan with a touch of olive oil.

I cook my chicken breast in a skillet with water. During this process I used the curry and some garlic powder to season the chicken. I also used a bag of frozen broccoli florets and steamed those before adding to casserole. I love olives, but would not put them in this recipe again. I would substitute with mushrooms and/or diced sweet onion. I also used one cup sour cream, but added a second can of cream of chicken soup. Whole family liked it...except the olives. :)

This was EXACTLY what I was looking for!!! I used curry powder, probably close to 2 tsp, and it was great! I made this exactly to the recipe except I probably used 1-and-a-half cups of sour cream instead of the full 2 cups. I precooked my broccoli to make sure it was soft enough for my kids. SO GOOD. :) Thank you!

This was good. I made 1 portion thinking one portion. I feult like if you were feeding a growing boy teenager serving. The one portion was 2 nice portions could be 3. It coverd my 8by8 pan. I used mushroom soup like others sujusted and used frozen brocclie. Use rotni pasta i had it on hand . I skiped olives and curry as i am on low sodium diet dident have any olives.  When i make this agin. I will be useing more flavors needed more like some basil would be great or itlan seasioning. If not watching your figure add rits crackers on top for crunch toping. I use to make recipe  cream chesse to is good in this.

This casserole is absolutely amazing, wasn't sure because of all the reviews saying  it was bland. Didn't even use the curry powder, didn't have it. I used about 1 1/2 pkgs frozen broccoli because that's what I had. I cooked the Broccoli first I added about  3/4 cup cheddar on top of the casserole with some crushed garlic cheese croutons about halfway through cooking time it did need that extra cheese, but was wonderful the black olives and the sour cream are key ingredients. Love this!

What I did different: 1 3/4 cups sour cream, 2 cups cheddar cheese, baby bow tie pasta (mixed in), crushed croutons ontop and no olives or parmesan (didn't have either on hand) and I steamed my broccoli. I also made my own cream of chicken soup which I think makes a huge difference. All in all, it could have had some more spice to it. I didn't add the curry because of what everyone said, but I wish I did. This was my first time making a casserole and I think I was just too light on the seasonings. Everyone is right though, it is yummmy the next day!

I knew that I'd be leaving the curry out when I made it but this was still really good. I used about half the sour cream cause I was worried it was too much. And cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, just our family's preference, but it was awesome. I added crumbled Ritz crackers drizzled with butter to the top before I put it in the oven. I will make this again and use the entire amount of sour cream, a tad more cheese (we really like cheesy) and maybe one more clove of garlic. Really great recipe and even better the next day.

This was good.  I left out the olives since I didn't have any.  I liked the curry.  I don't care for the condensed soup taste, so I thought only one can was good - the sour cream balanced it out.  This was a good, easy, quick meal.  I just happened to have everything on hand!

Yummy..good comfort food. I used leftover turkey, cream of celery (cause that's what I had),only 1/2 the sour cream and omitted the curry. The fresh broccoli I put in the pan with the noodles as they were cooking. Crackers on top, a little extra cheese...and yup, good stuff.

Not so great! I steamed the broccoli like everyone else did and did use the curry. The blend of all these ingredient didn't go well together. Didn't like it.

Very good! I just made this casserole for my family and they all loved it. I added in probably 1/2 cup more cheddar for all my cheese lovers. Great way to use left over chicken or turkey.

My family loved this casserole.  I followed the recipe as written with the only exception being that I added one extra garlic clove, because we love garlic in my house.  My one year old could not get enough, and my husband and I brought the leftovers to work for lunch the next day.

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I substituted 1 cup cottage cheese for the sour cream, mozzarella cheese for the Cheddar cheese, and rotini noodles for the egg noodles. Oh, and I sprinkled it with cumin and garlic powder instead of the curry. Surprisingly still very yummy!

I had to change the recipe a bit because of what I had in the house. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, penne instead of egg noodles, added onions, didn't have olives and used cumin instead of curry. I also steamed the broccoli with the chicken before baking it.  Overall, it was very good. 3 out of the 5 of us loved it. The two youngest weren't as keen. I will definetely make this recipe again and try it with olives. I definetely liked the yogurt in it and the cumin!

This was great! I will make this again for sure. The curry adds a most perfect touch.

"Best thing since G-Ma's Shepards Pie" direct quote from the boyfriend. This is big - in 4 years I've not been able to get close to the famous shepards pie rating. We loved it, there are only 2 of us and it only lasted 2 days... Dinner, lunch next day and dinner again. I used 1 and 1/2 lbs chicken, substituted 2 can's green beans for broccoli (my bag of frozen I planned to use was bad), 1 and 1/2 cups of Cheddar and added a little milk. I also left out the curry powder since I didn't have any but will pick some up and try w/that.  Will make this again and again.

I left out the olives and curry.  It was very good and my whole family liked it.  It's hard to find something that all 3 kids will eat.  I plan to make this when we have a church dinner.  I think it will go over well.

My husband says this is a "keeper". We really enjoyed this recipe. Just a couple of little modifications--added a little bit of milk to thin out the soup and added garlic pepper to spice things up a bit.  It was very good and we enjoyed it.

Very good - I liked it better the second day. I used fat free sour cream and it actually tasted fine. I also used about 1/2 cup of freshly grated Parmesan and 1 bag of frozen broccoli (unthawed). I sprinkled the casserole with extra Parmesan cheese before I baked it - delicious! This makes a good sized casserole - I fed seven people and had about a quarter of the casserole left over.

I loved this recipe.  I hate cooking but we had company coming over and I kind of had no choice.  I couldn't believe on how simple it was.  Everyone loved it and I looked like I slaved in the kitchen all day.  Thank you.
