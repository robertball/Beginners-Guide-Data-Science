Oh, My!  I fixed this for dinner and it was a hit.  My husband said he thought this was the best I had ever made.  Next time, I think I will add more spices, we like ours a with a little more.  Kids would like this as is.  Frying is messy, but these are worth the mess.  This is a keeper for our home.

I've tried a few different crispy wing recipes, but this one was the big hit with the family. Prefect crispy, coating. The only complaint was that they weren't seasoned enough. Next time I'll double the spices.

Fantastic! 
For those of you complaining about the spices, add them AFTER you pull the wings out of the fryer, before they cool off. Good spices are expensive, and if you add them to the wing or batter before frying, you will lose them in the oil. What you end up with is well seasoned oil, which is useless. I mix the spices I like in a bowl, and as soon as the wings are pulled from the fryer, I sprinkle the spices I like on with my fingers. This also gives the oil a chance to rise back up to cooking temperature. I usually fry these for 11 minutes (4-5 large wings at a time) and I flip them after 6 minutes. I never clip off the wing tips. They are great for nibbling on. KUDOS to the author for this great recipe!

Great recipe to build off of. I usually quadruple the amount of cayenne (i like it spicy), then once they are fried I coat in buffalo sauce and throw in the oven for a few minutes to make some delightfully spicy & relatively clean to eat wings

I thought these were bland but still delicious and crispy, especially with the right dipping sauce! I read the reviews and thought I might add a little more flavor by chopping 5 habeneros and putting them in the buttermilk mixture, and substituting garlic crutons instead of saltine crackers but they still came out extremely bland. I usually think everything's spicy so thats saying something. It must have something to do with the frying process?

Very crispy and tasty.  I don't like too much spice and this was very nice.  Tasted even better with chicken and rib BBQ sauce.  Will definitely make again.

It did make the chicken crisp but it was bland. I even added extra seasoning and it still was under seasoned. Maybe next time I'll season the skin directly like i usually do. My kids enjoyed it though.

I normally don't do reviews but since I've made this recipe a few times, I thought it was about time! 
First time, I agree with most it was a little bland.  2nd time around I decided to season the buttermilk batter instead of the flour and let the seasoning sit with the chicken....It was much more flavorful!  I especially love the texture the crackers give it:)

After reading the reviews, I went heavier on some of the spices in the coating mix (I like a nice 'bite' of spice). Prepared this for lunch with my mother. She can be EXTREMELY critical. After she finished, I asked her opinion of the wingettes. Her reply was, "Rod these are some of the best wings I've had in a long time!" I shared the recipe minus the saltines and after she tried her hand at it, she called and told me her were good but something was missing! #Haha

This recipe was perfect! My chicken came out beautiful! Of course being from the Caribbean I seasoned my chicken very well prior to the buttermilk bath! Thanks so much!

They ended up crispy just like I liked them. The only ding off was that it was just bland chicken in the end, and I added way more spices then what the recipe called for. For some reason none of the spice made it to the wings, but stayed in the dry mix.

This was awesome! My twist on it was to add cayenne, johnny's seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder to the buttermilk and all of those seasonings went into the dry mix with some celery seed. and I used panko bread crumbs instead of saltines. This will be a favorite of ours from now on!

notes for myself: crunch the crackers down very fine, add frank's hot Sauce to the buttermilk mix, and a sprinkle more while frying for extra flavor. give more time on each side for the wings

I added Ritz crackers (I chose Bacon flavor, but YMMV). The crust is almost like tempura; it is SO crisp! I like my wings a bit spicier, so I  rubbed some spice to the chicken first, then added the buttermilk/egg. I prefer a bit of garlic and cayenne. Overnight for the buttermilk won't hurt either.

I used this as a base for sauced wings. Added some hot sauce to the buttermilk mixture and mixed panko crumbs in the flour mixture rather than breadcrumbs. The final result was fantastic! For saucing I mixed buffalo wing sauce,sweet chilli sauce and BBQ sauce together and tossed the wings to coat. Sooo good. This will be my base recipe for all my fried chicken ( I always use recipes as a guideline and twist them up to my taste).

Looking at the previous reviews I doubled the spice mix. I used half on the chicken before the milk bath and added the rest to the flour mix. Chicken wings came out crispy and tasty.

The buttermilk marinade makes for tasty and tender meat. The cooking instructions provided are accurate and produce a crispy coating that satisfies. I made a half-batch of this recipe. After accounting for the reduced portion I couldn't help but notice that the recipe recommends far too little of the spices that could make a flavorful standalone breading. In the future, I will use this recipe as a base for wings that are to be tossed in a sauce. --Recommended--

Super easy and so delish... Didn't have the buttermilk , so it probably would have been tastier .  Highly recommend giving this a try. The humble cracker gave it the kick it needed. And it soaks up any sauce you add

We had this for lunch, and even my super picky 5-year old enjoyed it! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the cayenne, because of the little one. Thank you for sharing the best fried chicken wings recipe on this site!

I made this recipe today and my family loved it! I made some changes - i did not have chicken wings, so i used chicken thighs. I cut each thigh in two and seasoned them with curry, thyme, salt and chicken seasoning. I let it cook (be careful not to over-cook them). I took them out of the broth and let them drain off a rack. I mixed the butter-milk mixture according to the recipe and dipped the cooked chicken in it. I did not have crackers, so i used crushed crispbread. I doubled the amount of the seasonings and mixed it with the flour. Love it!

My family really liked them- I have to balance the taste against the time spent making them and the mess from deep frying.  All in all, if you're willing to put the effort in, these are quite good.  I think I will look for an easier way to get a good taste from wings!

While I added more seasoning, because I know my taste buds, I found this recipe an EXCELLENT start.  First, it is NOT all about the breading and frying technique, it is about knowing your own taste buds. However, I followed my own advice (see below) and added garlic powder, sage, dill weed, onion powder, more thyme than called for.  I read the last ingredient:  Salt to taste after you cook them.  That ends "BLAND" and makes it delicious.

These were ok. I doubled the recommended seasoning, based on a few comments on here about it being bland. And it was still blah. The texture was right on point. Personally, I will just add more/different seasonings next time.

While I changed up the spice combination, I kept the 3 cups flour & 1 cup crushed saltines along with the egg & buttermilk soak.  Great texture.  Nice & crispy on our fresh chicken wings.  We used a generous portion of black pepper, salt & Tony Cachere's creole seasoning in ours which was just spicy enough.  Cooking time was spot on, too.  10 minutes was perfect.  Will use this in the future & am already planning on this breading for chicken livers.

Loved it!!! My five-year-old daughter is picky but she ate 4 of these wings in a row! The only thing different I did was add a few shakes of Old Bay and a bit more salt after I took them out of the fryer. We loved these so much that tonight for dinner we are making them again only this time as chicken fingers!

I gave this try and really liked it.  I applied a buffalo wing sauce after they lost a little crispiness but still had great flavors and very tender.  I will make again for sure.
