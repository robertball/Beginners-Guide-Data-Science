I used Swiss chard from my garden, which was very tender, and eliminated the lettuce mix. We’re having it again tonight. I cut ingredients down to accommodate 2 servings except for the dressing, which I made according to recipe. Very good dressing.

I made this for a New Year’s Day potluck and it was a real hit. I used less oil and threw in some pomegranate, but otherwise kept the recipe as-is.

Very good but will look at giving the salad a little more zip next time.  With just oranges, it was a little bland. Loved being able to slip in a little of the fresh Swiss chard from my garden. ( My family did not even notice and Swiss chard is not something they think that they like. )
