There seems to be a couple of issues with this one as written. 3 ounces of cream cheese is only half a block. 3 serrano peppers to a half a block of cream cheese is excessive. I used the entire 6 ounce block and still only used two peppers. The recipe doesn't say to do so but you really need to soften the butter almost to the point of melted to get it incorporated in the cream cheese. With that being said, my husband really liked these. If you want to save yourself some time use real bacon pieces. With a couple of minor changes, this would be a hit at a party or food day at work.

I agree with Soup Loving Nicole.  The measurements are off and the butter needs to be pretty soft as well.   I make the balls the size of a large marble and use as a snack.  My daughter had a look of disgust on her when I had her try it and she slowly ate it.  About 5 minutes later, she came back asking if she could have some more.

Im allergic to cilantro so I substituted parsley.  The lime zest was a nice touch.  Very good, shared recipe and will make it again.  Great to grab and go breakfast with a scrambled egg

This is mine and my husband's favorite go to for the keto diet. Curbs the craving until the next meal.
