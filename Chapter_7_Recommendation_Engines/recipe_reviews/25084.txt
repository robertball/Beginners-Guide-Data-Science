These cookies are delicious but they did spread alot. I substituted 1/2 of the butter with canola oil it was still fantastic. I will make these again, but, I will eliminate greasing the pan and maybe add an egg white to keep it from spreading. Thanks for recipe!

The cookie dough itself was absolutely delicious! But the cookies spread alot, so they have to be spaced out on a baking tray, about 5 cm, apart. The cookies were delicious and I'll definately make them again.

I made these with my kids. It is such an easy and fun recipe. I did have to adjust my cooking time a little, but that is to be expected. With different ovens the cooking time will vary. We will make these and hand them out for Christmas at my husbands office, and the kids are going to make some for their Teachers! I think I will make some extra, like one reviewer said. One bite and they will know that they are in for a real tasty treat. I think these are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made!

First time I made it did spread a lot indeed. It was delicious, but I found it a bit too sweet so the second time I put less sugar, a little bit less butter (1 cup only) and added a banana. It was wonderful! It didn't spread too much and they were less sweet. The banana gave a special taste. I'll keep on making this recipe, it's my favourite cookie!

Very good cookies, although they did spread out quite a bit and ended up kinda flat.  Still tasted great though!

I made these cookies for my friends and roommates and they have been declared the best cookie of all time. I added two things to make these cookies absolutely spectacular: I mashed a banana and mixed it in with everything and I also added a handful of flax seeds for some nice crunch. I kept the cookies on the soft side, and the banana flavor with the flax seed crunch with the oatmeal comfort made these my new favorite cookie.

I knew AR would come to my rescue!  I used this as a base for a pumpkin cheesecake streusel bar recipe that called for a packaged oatmeal cookie mix and it didn't disappoint.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I really wish I had known that I should pack each ingredient down as I put them into the jars. I used this recipe for gifts for my family and friends, and when I got to the top of the jar, I could only fit about 1/2 cup of oats. The cookies are yummy, though. They do spread out quite a bit, so be warned.

Really good. Added a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and quite a bit of chopped walnuts - at least 3/4 cup? 350 was better for my oven. Might add more spices next time.

These are terrific. I added an egg white as suggested by another reviewer and it worked so that the cookies didn't spread too thinly.

This recipe did NOT fit into a quart jar as written; however, since so many people thought they were too sweet and spread too much, I only used 2/3 c. brown sugar, and then everything fit.  I also used my food processor's pusher to pack the jar more tightly. Also, I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

Yummy!! Better recipe than other oatmeal cookies i've tried. My family couldn't get enough. And they're low in fat!!! ;D Maybe i did something wrong the first time around though because i did have tad bit of rolled oats leftover..
