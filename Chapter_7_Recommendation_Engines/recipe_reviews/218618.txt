I was so hopeful about this recipe, but the wonton wrappers are a very strange choice. I found that after boiling the "ravioli" stuck together essentially as bacon and cheese filled dumplings. The flavors of this dish are great, but I found the texture with the wrappers unpleasant. I'd love to try this recipe again with real pasta dough. As it is, I'll be attempting to deep fry the ravioli in the wonton wrappers later this week. I'm hoping that will improve the texture and keep the fantastic bacony-cheese flavor.

**With real pasta dough it tastes even better, but is much more work. The reason for having the wonton skins is to cut off a chunk of the effort. This recipe was originally intended as "Wonton Skin Optional" but it seems it was edited by submission. ** If you do use wonton skins, I would suggest using two sheets as you would with normal ravioli. Putting the filling on one sheet, shaping it either round or square flat, and sealing the second sheet over the top using water+egg. This recipe can yield around 30-40 total ravioli when made with 1/2 tbsp sized ricotta portions. For the sauce, freshly grated parmesan also melts much quicker, and gives a silkier finish.

These turned out great! I didn't mind the wrappers because it was quick, I just doubled mine up. I also fried some of them which I know wasn't healthy but it tasted great. I will make these again.

The flavour was ok. That is way to much work to make bacon bits.

these are good. I tried using a noodle recipe for the outside but then went to the wanton wrappers.  The ones i made with the homemade pasta. were good. the ones with won-ton wrapper was not as good.
The filling and sauce is awesome.

This was a great recipe, I have a large family and this made a great dish for the hungry bunch. The scratch made sauce was very ri ch and delicious. The bacon was a great mix with the cheese. I found if you plate each portion selarately and put the sauce over it ,  then it helps avoid the sticking together issue.  I like wonton soup so the wrappers didn't bother me. I think next time I might add some fresh parsley and maybe green onions to the filling.

I haven't tried the sauce yet, but am already a big fan of the filling.  I skipped the wonton wrappers and am making my pasta from scratch.  1/2 of this recipe will fill 4 doz tortelloni and 3 doz ravioli.  I'm freezing them for now (an experiment) but can't wait to try the sauce with them as well!!  I did add just a tad of garlic powder to the stuffing.

The sauce was ok, but isn't the greatest you can make from scratch, in my opinion.  It seemed like it was just a pan full of melted cheese, almost more of a fondue.

The ravioli filling was excellent, and will definitely be made again.  I don't recommend using the wonton wrappers because, as has already been said, they tend to stick together and rip apart, and if they're not sealed perfectly they'll open up and you'll end up with a packet of cheesey-bacon boiling water, so you end up with a plateful of wet filling and a few strips of wonton.  We'll definitely be using it again, but we'll be filling something else next time.

I just can't seem to get this one right everytime I've tried it I end up with a big mass of dough bacon and cheese.
