This is a very KID FRIENDLY recipe. I doubled the recipe so there would be plenty to freeze for busy nights to come with school starting back. I cooked it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high. The slow cooker seems to let the flavors incorporate better. I used fresh garlic and tomatoes. My husband likes a BBQ flavor to his sloppy joe, so he added BBQ sauce to his bun. We all loved how it tasted. So simple and easy. Give it a try! :)

These are SUPER, Sloppy Joes!  I followed others advise and used BBQ sauce (instead of ketchup)and fresh garlic.  Very tasty!

1) World's best sloppies--that's the truth. And I didn't even have any celery! 2) Tidy Joes :) When this recipe is cold, serve it in thick sandwiches on whole wheat with mayo. Much, much better than meatloaf sandwiches, and would be a hit at picnics. 3) We prefer One Cup of filling per san, rather than 1/2 Cup and would double the recipe if we were serving 8.

Yummy!  I used a whole large onion, a whole bell pepper, three stalks of celery, and a whole 15-oz. can of tomatoes.  To make up for this extra bulk, I added extra ketchup, steak sauce, and Worchestire sauce.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, dijon mustard instead of mustard powder, I eliminated the paprika, and I added salt and pepper.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Everyone in my family liked this recipe, as is.  Even though it does not have the traditional barbeque taste, the sauce is very good.  This will be one of our favorite recipes.

Outstanding.  Too bad this doesn't come in a can!  I added a quarter cup of barbecue sauce and a diced jalapeno pepper since my friends and family like a little more pizazz.  We serve this whenever we host Green Bay Packer parties at our house.  Never ever any leftovers.

I have one word for this recipe...INCREDIBLE! This is the best recipe for sloppy joes that was ever written!!! I don't even like them and I eat these. The only thing I do diffrent is I let them simmer for about 4 hours. Thanks for sharing!!

I used this recipe as a "starting point."  I doubled it using 3-lbs ground beef and 1-lb ground pork.  I used Chili Sauce instead of Ketchup, Italian-style diced tomatoes with garlic & onion, 2 yellow onions and a whole green pepper.  My kids LOVED it!  My husband and I would have liked it spicier, but that pertains to almost everything!  Go for what you have, Go for what you like!  This basic recipe is GREAT!

Like other reviewers, I found that I had to add quite a bit of tomato sauce/paste to this recipe to bind it together. Without the addition, the recipe resulted in a seasoned ground beef but without the tomato base I am used to. Once about a cup of tomato sauce and 2 tbs of tomato paste were added, this was a great dinner served on onion buns.

Two stars and I think I'm being generous.  Anyone looking for a Sloppy Joe recipe exactly like Manwich search for Sloppy Joe II on this website.  I gave that a 5 star plus rating.  My family has loved it but I saw this and decided to try something new.  I am running back quickly to Sloppy Joe II.  I can't begin to tell you how Un-Sloppy Joe this one is!!!!

My small children and so as my husband likes it. Though I made a lot of changes, I still rate this as 5* as a basic recipe. I stir fried the vegetables separate from the beef. I drained out as much as fat as I could from the meat and then put it in the slow cooker with the vegetables. Since a lot of reviewers said that the sauce is bland, I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened barbeque sauce since I already put sugar in the sauce, 2-3 tbsp of vinegar/lemon juice, 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce, 2 tbsp steak sauce, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp salt and the mustard is 1 tbsp dijon mustard; and then pour the sauce over the meat in the slow cooker. For us, it came out great, however due to my curiosity I'll try with the chili sauce next time.

Delicious!  1 exchanged 1 shredded zucchini for 1 pound of the ground beef and it tastes great.  Zingy with lots of different flavors.

This was a pretty good sloppy Joe. It is definately better than the packaged versions. It was a bit too sweet and I made the mistake of using petite diced tomatos. Next time I will look harder for the crushed. This would be a good one for a crowd by throwing into a crockpot to keep heated. I will make it again.

As far as sloppy joes go, this one's ok. It was really easy to make, but the recipe was far too sweet. Cutting back on the brown sugar would help a lot. Next time I'll try substituting tomato paste for ketchup.

These are definitely not to be confused with BBQ's.  If you are looking for bland sloppy joe, they are very good.  And the flavor improves over a day or two.  I am not a green pepper fan, so left them out.

The title of the recipe does not live up to its name, there is nothing super about it.  I followed the recipe and when I tasted it, it tasted like nothing more than the beef and ketchup.  I had to add twice the amount of brown sugar, mustard, and worcestershire sauce.  It is not the worst recipe in the world, but definatly not one to use if you are looking for packed full flavor.

EXCELLENT!!! The best sloppy joes I've ever made or eaten. This is now OUR recipe when it comes time to make these. I doubled the saucy ingredients because it seemed a little too meaty and not even saucy. Also did BBQ sauce instead of steak sauce but I'm sure steak sauce would be great too. I think letting it simmer like the recipe says is the key. WONDERFUL!!!!!!

Definitely a keeper recipe!  I'll be making it again, and usually I could take or leave sloppy joes.  I added BBQ in place of ketchup, added 2 jalapena peppers and 2 tsp chili powder.  It was delish...my husband ate half of it himself!  Thanks for all the tips!

As far as sloppy joes go, these are good - no need to buy the canned mix again. I only gave it 3 *** because I'm not much of a sloppy joe fan, but will make them on those nights where cooking is the last thing I want to do. 
The only changes I made were scaling it down in half and there was plenty for my family of 3 to have seconds and still have leftovers for lunch. I also omitted the celery because I didn't have any - and don't think I'd add it the next time I make this. I also subbed the crushed tomatoes for 1 (8 oz) can of tomato sauce and added about 1 T. of chili sauce. (Keep in mind that I halved this recipe.) 
I would definitely make this again!

Very very good sloppy joes.  I left out the green pepper since my husband doesn't like it and used barbeque sauce instead of steak sauce since that's what I had in the kitchen.  I will be making these again.

Really good recipe! Like another reviewer, I added bar-b-que sauce to give it some spice and thickness. (Kathy's Award Winning Bar-b-que Sauce) from this site. Because of the sauce I left out the sugar. I didn't have any ground beef on hand, so I thinly sliced london broil, sauteed the meat and then put everything into my slow cooker. My gang loved this recipe and decided that they no longer want Sloppy Joe's made with ground beef again!

Excellent recipe for sloppy joes.  The only change I would make is use real garlic(minced)instead of garlic salt.

Yummy Sloppy Joes!  I did double the recipe so there would be plenty to freeze. I used BBQ sauce instead of the steak sauce. I also added 1/2 tsp. chili powder and 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I placed it in my slow cooker for 4 hours on low. Dinner was waiting when we got home from errands. Very good!

This is DELICIOUS!  I've made a single recipe and I've quadrupled it for a family party and it has been very well liked.  For the large batch, I put it into a 6 quart slow cooker to simmer and that worked great.  The only changes I've made are to use BBQ sauce instead of steak sauce and garlic instead of garlic salt.

I loved these. There's another recipe I like just a little bit better, but I will have to rotate this one in. I halved the recipe, and since I didn't have any celery, I used some celery flakes and upped the amount of green pepper a bit. I used a touch more ketchup than was called for (since my tomatoes were diced and not crushed), and used spicy brown mustard (around a tsp) instead of ground. For the steak sauce, I used 57 sauce. I served these on whole wheat buns and with BBQ chips. Very tasty. I have also made this using red wine vinegar instead of regular and with BBQ sauce instead of 57, eaten in Italian bread bowls with cheddar on top.

I thought these were fantastic.  The key is to let it simmer for the 40 minutes, that's when the flavors come together.

I loved this recipe. My daughter did not. I do not like the overbearing flavor of manwich sloppy joes. This was milder yet excellent. I used diced tomatoes. Next time I will try barbeque sauce for a little more zip.

i halved the recipe for only 4 servings, ommitted the celery (none in the fridge!), and used jalepeno peppers instead of green peppers (my husband likes a kick).  these turned out really good!  i used the ketchup, but next time i may use the bbq sauce as others have recommended.

all in all, a great sloppy joe recipe that i will make again and again!

This recipe was fantastic!  I grew up on the favorite canned version but this wins hands down.  Not too tangy, not too sweet.  All of the ingredients seemed to compliment eachother quite well.

I liked this quite a lot - not too ketchup-y or sweet.  I substituted barbeque sauce for the steak sauce and used ground turkey, but the taste was a big hit. I had tried the other sloppy joe recipe (sloppy joes II) & found that one lacking.
This recipe's a keeper.

This recipe had excellent flavor.  I made mine the night before so that all the flavors could meld together.  Several people who had never tried sloppy joes before really loved it.  And I tripled the recipe and everything still turned out fine.  I did add a small can of tomato sauce along with the crushed tomatoes.

A # 1, gourmet loose meat sandwiches.  Made them for a party. People liked them so much they were eating them without the buns; right off the plate with fork and spoon!!!

Not my favorite sloppy joe. I had to use diced tomatoes, because I couldn't find the right size can of crushed tomatoes, but that alone could not have accounted for my disatisfaction with this recipe. Too sweet for my taste, but even if I left out the brown sugar I don't think I would want to repeat it. 
I have another recipe that I'll stick to.

These were very tasty.  We hadn't has sloppy joes in so long!  I made a few minor changes: I used ground turkey instead of beef. I didn't have celery, so I left it out and I also left out the worcestershire sauce, steak sauce & ground mustard.  I substituted 1/2 cup chili sauce for the ketchup, I also added 1 tsp oregano and I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed.  We really enjoyed these and I'll be making these again!

Fabulous! It made enough for two meals for a family of 5. I froze half and it was actually better the second time as the celery and other flavors had a chance to work their way through a little more.

I really enjoyed this sloppy joe recipe. I added a can of "Rotel" just because I didn't have the crushed tomatoes on hand; it gave the sandwich some zip.

I will definitely try this recipe again.

This is an all time family favorite. I sometimes use ground turkey instead of beef and use onions or mushrooms or whatever veg I have on hand. Very forgiving recipe if you don't have exact ingredients. Always a winner!

This is a great recipe.  Everyone I have ever made these for loves them.  I do make a few changes to the recipe.  I use barbecue sauce instead of brown sugar, prepared mustard instead of dry, fresh chopped garlic, a few dashes of hot sauce and omit the Worcestershire.  I also mess around a little with the amount of each ingredient, adding a little more of this or that until it tastes just right.

A very good sloppy joe recipe. I added a 1T of BBQ sauce to the mix as well and put relish on the buns when I served this. I would add another 1/4 c of ketchup next time but that is just my preference.

If you are a big fan of the ketchupy canned sauces this may not be for you, unless you add more ketchup but for me this has got a terrific blend of flavors and is going to be one of our favorites just as it is.

This is a delicious Sloppy Joe recipe! Just sweet enough, and just juicy enough. I didn't have ketchup, but I did have Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce. Very nice! Toast the buns a little so they don't get too soggy.

My family loves this one. I leave off the green pepper since we just don't like them in sloppy joes, chili, etc.
If you make this a day ahead it really thickens up. So it is also great leftover.

I LOVED these sloppy joes! I thought these were some of the best, most flavorful I have ever made. I did not have celery or crushed tomatoes so instead I used celery salt and diced tomatoes with mild green chilies, respectively. I will make again!!

I cranked this up to 24 servings for a Red Hat Society dinner.  Everyone enjoyed it and since I made extra, I froze the leftovers.  That came in very handy when I had a lousy cold last week.  Nice recipe for a crowd and stays nicely warm in a big crock pot.  I served it over "French Bread" hamburger buns...nice texture.  Served it with chips and a jello salad.  Homey and good.

I don't recommend.  I made it with omitting the ketchupfor bbq sauce.  still bland.  i had to add tomatos sauce, more brown sugar, more worcestershire, and then adding a bit of ketchup,  and more seasonings.  so basicaaly i had to make everything my own.

Except for being way too sweet and having not much color to it, there was, by far, nothing "super" about this sloppy joe recipe.  I had to doctor it up with tomato paste and BBQ sauce to even come close.  My gang was very disappointed!

I found this recipe after I had already browned ground beef & realized that I was out of manwich. No time for the veggies...I improvized using tomato sauce (12oz) instead of crushed tomatoes. I just added the remaining ingredients and simmered covered for 15 minutes. Really good!!! Next time I'll add the veggies, but wil stick to the tomato sauce...we don't like ours too sloppy.

I scaled this for 50 and made it for a luncheon at our church.  Some people had 3 or 4 of them, they were that good.  I read all of the reviews first then decided to make it according to the original recipe, but ended up adding BBQ sauce as others had suggested. This is definitely a keeper and one that will be made again and again.

I don't know if it is just me, but I thought I paid attention when adding ingredients - it just tastes like really tomato-y meat.  I cant taste all the rest of the ingredients.  On second thought I may have doubled the meat and forgot to double some of the spices.  Used turkey instead of beef which is really good, eat it on toasted buns with mayo.  Very good, very sloppy, very stain-y (watch out for those pants and white t-shirts!!!)

Best sloppy joes I've ever had!  Only thing I changed was scale the recipe down to 4 servings.

I have always followed the standard recipe of ketchup, onions and green peppers. After making this I will never go back to that boring recipe.
This has so much flavor and most of the ingredients are in the fridge. These are really Super sloppy joes.

I used low fat ground turkey which cuts out some flavor, so I added a couple of cloves of garlic, onion powder and jalapenos...very good!!  Will keep and make again!!

This was ok.  I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted the ketchup with BBQ sauce.  I still found it a little on the bland side, but my kids liked it, but that's only after they added some shredded cheddar to their sandwiches.

These sloppies joes are much better than the Mcormic or other brand's quick mix.

I didn't cook the celery very much because I like it crunchy.

For so long, my mother has always made sloppy joes with Manwhich. However, one night we decided we wanted some for dinner. We had the meat defrosted, only to find that we didn't have any Manwhich! I searched allrecipes for a recipe and stumbled on this one. It was great! Umpteen times better than the out-of-the-can concoction. I now snuff anything other than this recipe! It isn't that hard to make, either, if you have all the chopped ingredients. I recommend it to anyone!

This dip is great. I serve it to my husband who is on the Atkins diet. He eats it with prok rinds but I love it on green pepper strips.

I have made these a couple of times and my family loves these. My four year old asked for more and shes picky.  They are so much better than the canned. I added extra ketchup just because we really like ketchup.

These sloppy joes were very good!  I made too much though, so I made goulash with the leftovers.  I got a lot of compliments on the "joes."

I made this entirely in the microwave. It was good but not that great. I don't think the microwave was the problem though. I made 1/2 a recipe with 1lb. of ground beef. I used seafood cocktail sauce instead of the ketchup (that's mostly made with chili sauce as others recommended). I do like my sloppy joe made with chili sauce-- I think that is a key ingredient. I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. Other than that I followed the recipe almost to a tee. I added some salt and pepper as others mentioned. I have to say I was somewhat tempted to throw in a can of Manwhich that I had to lessen the wateriness of the sauce. I made this before and didn't write a review and I don't remember it was great then either. I would be a good way to doctor up a cheap generic sloppy joe sauce in a can, but then you do lose some of the reason you bought the cheap stuff. It's something to start with toward making a great homemade sloppy joe but I'll keep trying to perfect it to my taste.

This recipe is fast and easy to prepare and taste's delicious.  I loved it and my fiancee told me again and again this was the best sloppy joes she'd ever eaten.

Instead of the 2 lbs of ground beef called for, I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground turkey because that's all I had on hand.  It's probably even better as written!

My husband said this was a great recipe.
He's picky so I will stick with this one.
I made half the amount and substituted the crushed tomatoes with fresh tomato. I also used the whole amount of tomato sauce.  Just right!
