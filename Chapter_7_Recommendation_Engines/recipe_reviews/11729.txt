Ok here's the scoop on any revision you might want to make!  I've been making this lasagna for over a year and it is excellent... 
 
**You do need more sauce!  Just add an extra 14 oz can of crushed or diced tomatoes and increase garlic, onions and other spices by a small amount as well.

**2 Tbs of brown sugar is just right.  

**1&1/2 pound of hamburger is an awful lot, I've decreased it to 1/2 pound and that was plenty for this non-meat loving family!

**I use 9x13 cake pan, and 12 lasagna noodles would fill it to overflowing!  I've found 9 noodles (3 layers of 3 noodles each) to be enough.

**30 minutes is no where near long enough to cook this thing!  20 minutes uncovered just to get it started, then 1 hour loosely covered with foil, then remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes is more like it!

This recipe is very forgiving, and judging by all the comments, very flexible as well.  Hope my comments help someone one else...

I have found my staple lasagna recipe! I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, but I only used a pound, next time I will double it because I like lots of meat. I took the advice of another reviewer, and used 1/3 of the ricotta mixture on the top layer to keep the noodles from drying out, it worked beautifully. I used two 15 oz. containers of ricotta, and doubled the sauce as suggested by others. I doubled the garlic and added fresh ground pepper to the sauce, used a mixture of shredded mozzarella and shredded parmesan, and I only needed to use 9 lasagna noodles. I put it together the night before, baked it covered for 1 hour and uncovered for 20 minutes. If you do cover it during baking, make sure to use nonstick cooking spray on the foil, or the cheese will stick. It sliced perfectly, too. My husband said it was just as good as the lasagna his Italian stepfather makes, and he's been cooking for more than 50 years with recipes older than that! That was the best compliment I could have ever gotten! The next time we have people over, this is the dish I'm going to make. I served it with cheesy garlic bread, I only wish I'd had caesar salad to go along with it. I will make this again and again. Thank you, Rosemary!

PS: A disposable pan will be your best friend in this recipe.

WARNING... I made the receipe a day ahead as suggested.  Although I thought it was odd, I saw the cook time was 30 min and followed directions without looking back at the cook and prep times listed at the top of the web page (when I hit PRINT, those didn't print out, just the actual receipe!).  I should have known better.  There must be a typeo at the bottom of the receipe, it does NOT cook in 30 min, but an hour and 30 like it says at the top!  It was easy to figure out my mistake, and I should have prob known better, but in a rush I followed the receipe and planned for 30 min.  Now we'll have to wait another 60 to eat.  Oops.  I hope it's as wonderful as everyone says, it smells fabulous!  And DO add some extra tomato sauce and water to the sauce.

I believe this is a great basic recipe. I made several modifications to fit my tastes (adding mushooms, increasing spices, using turkey instead of beef), but that versitility only increases the value of the recipe in my mind.

Others have commented on the dryness and that concerned me a bit. I didn't find it dry at all and have a couple of observations that I didn't see in other reviews.

First, the recipe isn't clear whether the tomatoes should be drained or not. Do NOT drain them, use the juice in the sauce.

Second, use cooked noodles. Uncooked dry or fresh noodles (I used fresh) will absorb water from the sauce and make the finished product drier. I suspect the same is true of the oven ready product I have never used.

Third, I did end up adding a half-cup of water to be sure, but this will depend on how you simmer and personal tastes. I think adding about this much red wine as some others suggest could add flavor and the needed moisture.

I gave it only four stars because of the discrepancy on cooking times (it needs 1 1/2 hours, not 30 min) and not being clear on retaining the juice in the diced tomatoes. Otherwise, I think it's a great and very adaptable recipe.

Thanks, Rosemary.

This is now going to be the lasagna recipe I use from now on.  The only change I made was I used a mixture of half ricotta cheese and half cottage cheese instead of all ricotta.  I refrigerated it overnight before baking it as the recipe author suggests and added 15 minutes to the baking time indicated in the recipe however I found that the edges were starting to burn before the center was done.  If you're refrigerating the lasagna overnight before baking it I suggest covering it with aluminum foil for the first 20 minutes of baking and baking it at 350 rather than 375.  That way the center can heat up without the edges burning first.

Wow!!  Wonderful flavor!  Be sure and simmer the sauce the maximum amount of time.  Making the lasagna a day ahead and refrigerating is definitely key to having outstanding flavor!  I made this a second time, and used Italian-seasoned turkey sausage, ground in my food processor.  What a difference it made - will definitely do that again!!  Also note that 1 tsp. dried basil works if you don't have fresh basil on hand, and lowfat ricotta is just fine as well.  I bake mine covered with aluminum foil for 20 minutes (then 10 minutes without) to prevent it from drying out.  I have made this lasagna several times, and like others, I thought it could use more sauce.  I now add an extra 14.5 oz. can of Italian-style diced tomatoes, and increase the spices a bit. PERFECT!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great recipe, but better with some modifications.  I followed several suggestions from other reviews.  Mainly, this lasagna would be way too dry and bland without more sauce and spices.  I added the equivalent of 1 1/2 28 oz cans of pre-seasoned sauce.  To the sauce I also added lots of xtra garlic and fresh oregano plus I used half ground beef and half hot italian sausage instead of all beef (next time I might even go with all sausage because that added a lot of good flavor).  I was going to add some crushed red pepper flakes but forgot, so I will add a little next time. To the filling I added a few xtra ounces of ricotta, a few xtra ounces of mozzarella (I used part skim), and 4 ounces of cream cheese.  I also used xtra parmesan on the top.  I cut the brown sugar in half and also used a little less salt.

I don't know if I needed to, but I sprayed the pan with Pam and also spread a little sauce on top of that and clean up was a snap.  I had modified the recipe for 12 servings and used a bigger pan and I cooked it for about 1 hr 40 minutes.  Clearly the 30 minute cook time at the bottom of the recipe is a misprint and should read the 1 1/2 hrs that it states at the top.  Also, I covered with foil for half of the cooking time which helped keep it moist on top.

I served this to 10 girlfriends and they all thought it was terrific!

My family of 6, consisting of 5 finicky men all loved this lasagna, just when they thought I couldn't improve on my own I try this and they were flabergasted! Only two things I changed. One was I subed italian sausage for 1/2 the hamburger and second WAY TOO MUCH SALT! I cut the salt out completely and nobody noticed! There is plenty of salt in the cheeses and the diced tomatoes to suit our tastes. Stopped by to correct my spelling...and to tell you all we still love this and I make only this recipe now.

Yummy!! Like other posts, I realized I was going to need more sauce halfway through the recipe. Luckily I had another can of diced tomatoes in the pantry.  So I added more to my sauce.  Plus, I cooked mine 20 minutes uncovered and an hour covered and it turned out perfectly.:-)  The best lasgna I've ever had! Who needs the Olive Garden?:-)
Notice the cook time at the top of the recipe...1.5 hours. THIS is the correct time, not the specifed 30 minutes! Allrecipes really should change this.

DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE! How can anyone give this more than one star, let alone 5! Such a dry recipe, tasted burned because they had you simmer tomato paste which is already dry! Not even water helped this recipe. If you want a kick butt lasagna, search for WHITE CHEESE CHICKEN LASAGNA.... Wow, what a good meal that was, everyone raved over it! It's not your red, dried out lasagna, it's a moist, cheesy white chicken lasagna. Please mark this review as helpful, so others may see it too!

Very good.  I cut the recipe in half and used no-boil noodles.  Lasagna sliced nicely and had good flavor but this is just your standard lasagna recipe.  I will make this again though since it's good AND easy.

Positively incredible!  Edit: I think I've perfected it.  I use 2lbs ground beef with 4 cloves of garlic.  Then I add an additional 15oz can of sauce to the tomato sauce.  (Add more of the other spices, but keep the brown sugar at 2Tbsp.)  I use 1.5lb mozz and .5lb of italian cheese mix for the cheese part.  I also put a light layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan to help noodles from drying out.  Then I put enough sauce to cover the top layer of noodles and then top with sliced mozzarella from a block (not the shredded type.)  This keeps the moisture in.  1 hour covered and then 20 min uncovered (kept in fridge overnight) and I had a bubbly, moist, delicious lasagna.  If you are skeptical, you MUST TRY!  Edit 2 - I "stole" some ideas from "World's Best Lasagna"..  use 1 lb. beef, 1 lb. sweet italian sausage, add a little nutmeg to the ricotta.  Ahhhhhh.

This was sooo good that I wanted to have some for breakfast this morning(but I did maintain self control).  I added a half pound italian sausage to the ground beef and an extra can of italian style diced tomatoes with a splash of red wine.  I also made 3 layers using 3 noodles per layer.  And we love cheese so there was lots of it.  I refrigerated it for 2 days before cooking.  OH SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! Tip:  instead of cooking the noodles, soak them in hot faucet water for a while and then layer.  They absorb the water and then cook in the oven.  Also, put a little sauce on the bottom of the pan, it helps with moisture.

I have been using this recipe since 2005.  The changes I have made are to add 1 can of tom sauce, use half ground beef/half Italian sausage, parsley in place of the basil, crushed instead of diced toms, only 1 Tb Brown sugar, and omit the last teaspoon of salt.  Sometimes I let it set overnight in frig; sometimes not.  Either way this is a great recipe that everyone always raves about.  I have even made the sauce by itself to serve with pasta.  Love it.

***This review is for my VEGETARIAN version***

I made this vegetarian by subbing one 8oz package of Smart Ground protein crumbles for the 1.5 pounds of ground beef.  It turned out to be just the right amount of "meat" in my opinion.  I used 1.5 onions rather than 1 and doubled the basil, oregano, and garlic.  I also added one teaspoon of cayenne pepper which added just the perfect amount of spice.  I did NOT think this needed more sauce.  This could be because I simmered my sauce at a low temperature and added about a half a cup of water half way through.  As others have stated, 9 lasagna noodles was perfect.  I covered with foil and baked for an hour, then removed foil and baked for another 20 min.

Summary:  As lasagnas go, this turned out to be very good!  I will make this again.

Very good and easy to make.  I added a 2/3 box of frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) to the ricotta cheese mixture.

DELISH!!! I just made this and will be coming back to it again for sure! My husband loves lasagna however I have never made it. He said it was the best lasagna he has ever had and couldn't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow. I only made a few changes. I added a 15oz. can of tomato sauce to stretch the meat sauce a bit more. My husband said that he always wishes that the lasagna he has had in the past had more ricotta cheese so I doubled the ricotta, parmesan, parsley and eggs. It was AWESOME! next time I think I am going to cut the recipe in half except for the ricotta portion and do that as the recipe calls. It made enough lasagna to last us weeks!

The first time I made this recipe I was pretty disappointed.  I think I listened too carefully to the reviews and didn't give the recipe a chance.  I made it again somewhat reluctantly, having forgotten all the discussion of what it needed, what it lacked, etc. and just followed the recipe - the only exception was that I added an additional 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and four tablespoons of the left-over pasta water to the sauce (I learned the pasta water is an Italian trick).  It turned out so much better than the first time!  I learned my lesson -- this is fantastic if you just trust the recipe!

I did not make this the night before. I didn't have time for that. I did make the sauce this afternoon and let it simmer for a few hours and I added a few small personal touches. I have to make my meat stretch the next couple weeks, so I only used about a half pound or so of ground beef and made up the rest in chopped vegetables; shredded zucchini, chopped peppers, mushrooms, onion and a mess of fresh minced garlic. Right after everything was combined, I added in a slosh of red wine. I doubled the oregano, only used only a pinch of salt AND I used organic diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Because I'm on a budget and we're watching our salt intake, (and we don't really care for ricotta), I used "Trim" cottage cheese and I did not add extra salt to the cheese mix. This really was quick to assemble, made a HUGE panful and was quite enjoyed by us and our dinner guests. I think I avoided the "dry lasagna" issue because I did not let mine set overnight but I think the sauce was better after I simmered it for a bit. With homemade whole wheat rolls, this was a filling, economical and enjoyable meal.

This Lasagna recipe is great. I made two pans of it for a party and everyone loved it. The first time I made it I did what others had suggested about substituting some of the ground beef with sausage, and adding another can of tomatoes. I also did that the second time I made it but I only put in half of the sugar. So many people loved the lasagna it was amazing. This one is definately a keeper.

Absolutely the best lasagna! I have not come across anyone that I served this to that didn't love it. The only change I made was adding more garlic. I also used a larger pan because this didn't fit into my 9X13.

Great recipe although I made several changes to cut the calories from 642/8 or 428/12 down to 325 per 1/12 slice. Cut back the meat to 1 lb and drained fat after saute. Used reduced fat mozzarella and ricotta and used 9 lasagna strips of Dreamfield's lower glycemic index pasta. Flavor from seasonings is great although I also reduced the salt. My entire family raved over this without them ever knowing about the substitutions. I have found that I can still enjoy my favorites without all the fat and calories. I agree about refrigeration one night prior for flavor and keep boiling of noodles to 5-7 min and pat dry. Keeps the lasagna from being runny. Will definitely make again!

Made this for the 2nd time recently.  The name is perfect - my husband is Italian, and this is completely different from my mother in law's lasagna, but heartier and every bit as good in it own respect.  It froze well, too. I just omitted the top layer of cheese and cooked the one for the freezer 1/2 the recomended time. (A trick from the mother in law which keeps it from being watery upon 2nd baking).  I then cooked it from frozen, adding that top layer of cheese for the last 1/2 hr.

This is my basic recipe for lasagna.  I do use sweet Italian sausage and ground beef for a richer flavor.  If you want stringy, gooey unburnt cheese on top then don't add the top layer of cheese until foil is off and lasagna is cooling in the oven.

This is the best lasagna! My husband recommends this for dinner whenever lasagna is mentioned. Will probably never make different lasagna. (Don't tell the hubby, but I do cut down on the meat and substitute chopped up zucchini, mushrooms and other veggies...he doesn't even notice!!) I also like to sub Italian sausage sometimes for some more zippyness!

I get nothing but compliments on this one.  I double the sauce and use extra mozzarella.  I also substitute cottage cheese for the ricotta.

I looked for and tried many different lasagna recipes over the years but after tasting this one, I won't be looking any more. I took the advice of others and change a few things. My family and relatives thought that it was the best lasagna ever. I used hot Italian turkey sausage in lieu of ground beef, 3 cloves of garlic not 2, 1 1/4 tablespoons brown sugar in lieu of 2 tablespoons, 1 additional can of diced tomatoes and added 1 small can of tomato sauce. I put a layer of sauce at the bottom of dish before the first layer of noodles. I used freshly grated Asiago cheese instead of parmesan, fresh parsley in lieu of dried and a dash of red pepper flakes. Last but not least I made it the day before and let it sit in the refrigerator so all of the spices settle in. Because it is cold when you put it in the oven you need to add 15 minutes to the baking time. This all sounds like a lot of work but it is actually pretty easy.

This lasagna looked and cut great but the flavor was only average.  Does everyone who gave this 5 stars must normally make lasagna from bottled sauce?  I followed suggestions and substituted 1/2 lb. hamburger for italian sausage.  I also added 8 oz. tomato sauce since there wasn't quite enough sauce.  I only used 1 tbs. brown sugar and did double all the herbs.  The flavor was flat! I think I'll go back to my old recipe which uses all italian sausage, no hamburger!  Also, thyme adds a kick.  Make sure you use a good brand of italian plum tomatoes and fresh herbs (even if you used dried, make sure they aren't old).  Fresh garlic only, and lots of it.  Also, I like to put an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the meat sauce on the bottom of the pan before layering the noodles.  That way you don't get lumps from the meat under the very first layer.  Just my pet peeve.  Really, there are better meat sauce recipes out there.  I will say, this recipe did cut quite nicely so I will follow the directions for the ricotta and assembling next time I make a different lasagna.

Just made this wonderful dish, with 5 alterations, and it was moderately easy and delicious! I used fresh oregano vs dried as I love the taste of fresh herbs to dishes. Added 2 tsp of fennel seeds, as this was a secret that an old Sicilian grandmother taught me for her meat sauce. I than added 8oz canned tomato sauce with 1 c of water to the sauce as the meat sauce simmered because my sauce seemed very thick in consistency. Finally, I tried the pasta that did not need any boiling, just to experiment with it. The end product was, as I wrote, delicious! My family had second helpings..and so will you (:

This truly is a great lasagna dish.  Thanks to everyone who previously submitted their suggestions.  I noticed with mine that the sauce was a little scarce on the very top layer, so I opened a 6 oz. can of tomato sauce and poured it on top and blended it with the cooked sauce before adding the mozzarella.  I was a little confused on timing and ended up cooking the lasagna for about an hour COVERED with foil and then about 10 minutes UNCOVERED.  This seemed to work well!  Great recipe!!

I've made this a few times now, and my fiance and friends absolutely love it. Like others have stated, I always end up needing more sauce then I've made. So i use, Newman's Organic sauce on the top layer. Very delicious.

I am going to offer a couple of suggestions with this lasagna.  I also added 1/8 c olive oil, 1/8 c red wine, 2 small bay leaves, and a little chopped green pepper to the sauce.  I had it simmer for a couple of hrs to let the flavors 'mesh'.  *Just be sure to pull the bay leaves out of the sauce before layering in the pan! I also used grated a block of fresh parmesan cheese to the top of the lasagna and applied a liberally.  Good starter recipe!

I love this recipe! It was actually the first lasagna recipe I'be ever tried, and I don't want to try another one! I've made it twice- once with ricotta cheese and another time with cottage cheese instead. Both ones were fantastic. I did add more sauce as people have suggested. I also only put in 1 lb of meat. I only had to cook the lasagna for 30 minutes as the recipe says. Then again, I cooked everything before so it was really just in the oven to melt the cheese. I would reccomend this recipe to anyone!

Oh, yeah, Baby! This is a keeper! Great recipe! I doubled the tomato sauce as others had suggested and didn't have fresh herbs so I used Italian seasoning (2 big teaspoons) and the family fell in love! Thank you!

I read the reviews AFTER I assembled the lasagna (I know, I know!) and I was pretty worried that it would come out dry. I didn't need to worry because the sauce was perfect! It was thick and delicious! Maybe some people like a thinner sauce, but I really liked the way this turned out!I followed the directions pretty closely. The only changes were that I used half a pound of ground beef and half a pound of sweet Italian sausage. Instead of using a can of diced tomatoes, I used the same size can of tomato sauce. (I don't like chunky sauce.) I made this the day before and popped it in the oven for dinner tonight. I cooked for 45 minutes and it was perfect. I think an hour and a half is too long. My husband always has something to say about what could be improved in a dish that I make (I know, annoyinh!!!) and this time he said it was perfect! Yay! I'm definitely making this again!

Amazing! I made mine half-meat, half-veggie. Just replaced the meat with spinach for the veggie half and it turned out great. I recommend using all 12 noodles.

This is an easy recipe that also tastes great. I add a can of tomato sauce and that seems to make enough sauce for a 9x13 pan, without it is not. I only use 1 tbsp of brown sugar, 2 is too sweet for my taste. I also substitute the ground beef with ground turkey.

This is my favorite lasagna recipe.  I have been making it for about a year now.  I do change a few things....I use crushed tomatoes instead of diced; substitute cottage cheese (8 oz) for the Ricotta; use  1 Tbsp onion powder instead of an onion (personal preference...a texture thing); and MOST IMPORTANTLY... add 6 oz cream cheese to the egg/cheese mixture.  The cream cheese is key.  It adds such a great depth and flavor.  I have received many comliments on this including one friend who said it was better than "----"  (A very popular Italian restaurant known for their salad and breadsticks).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Love this recipe!  I substitute one large can of diced tomatoes for one small can diced, one can tomato sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, but there wasn't enough sauce- the substitution solves the problem.  Yes, the cook time is incorrect as others have pointed out.  However, we hardly ever let it cook the full 1.5 hours, as my husband and I never seem to be able to wait that long!  Simply delicious recipe.

I used the "meatloaf" mixture of ground pork, beef and veal and it made an even tastier version.  I recommend draining the diced tomatoes so you have a thick sauce mixture--that way the lasagna isn't watery when baked.

Only 2nd time I've made lasagna. (First was from back of Barilla box using bottled sauce.) This one is worth the extra work. Absolutely delicious! Served 7 for New Year's with left-overs. I assembled it day before. BTW - I had enough to make a test 5x7 casserole to enjoy the night before the party.

This is a great recipe. I didn't measure ANYTHING and I changed it up, although I know it would be excellent, as written. I used a LOT of good quality burger and Jimmy Dean HOT sausage as well as sweet italian sausage. I used my cuisinart to blend the curds out of cottage cheese (cool consistency.. very creamy) used ricotta, too. I used maybe half cup of FRESH grated parmesan cheese.  I blended the bell pepper and onion in my cuisinart, so my son and hubby wouldn't know it was in there. HA!   I added some red pepper, more of all the spices, including 4x's the fresh garlic. I used half the salt.  Everything was perfect! It took a LONG time, but was worth it!

The most amazing lasagna I have ever had.  Everyone raves when I make it. A few changes I have made have made it even better. I use 1/2 lb. ground beef. And 2 (29 oz) cans tomatos. I blend mine in the blender because hubby doesn't like chunks. And I use 9 noodles instead of 12. I also line the bottom of the pan with tons of sauce. I use all of the sauce I make so it is not dry.  I don't think you can ever have too much sauce! And I put my baking dish on a cookie sheet to catch spill over.

Wow! This was a great recipe. I appreciate previous posters' comments: I added more Tom Sauce to make the meat thinner. I didn't have fresh basil so I subbed 1tsp of dried.  Here's a neat thing... instead of making traditional lasagne, I made roll-ups!  Cook the noodles, pat them dry, then one at a time spread cheese mix, then meat, then top w/mozz and roll on up. These can be frozen individually for a quickie individual meal, or placed in a pan w/more sauce and cheese on top. This is a bit laborious, but I love how easy it is to serve.  The individual rolls are mighty convenient, too!

This recipe is very similar to my mothers.  I substitute the tomatoes with tomato puree & added a 29 ounce can of tomato sauce & a bay leaf.  A bay leaf is important, as it reduces some of the sweetness from the tomatoes/paste.   As with all sauces be sure to adjust the spices in the sauce before assembling the lasagna.  I like more sauce, so I double it add more to the lasagna & leave a container of it out so that others can add as they please.  Just remember as with any other sauce...it's always better the next day!  AWESOME!!  I also use this sauce for other pastas.  Thank you Rosemary!

GREAT lasagna! I am Jamaican and know nothing about making lasagna!! I made this for my American boyfriend who loves his mom's lasagna and he LOVED it!! Very simple to make. I used 2lbs. of beef because I like mine to be meaty and I still think I could used some more meet.. also I only need 9 lasagna noodles in a 9x13 dish. There is soooo much leftover... definitely one recipe to keep for reference!

Best lasagna I've ever made period!!!! I made it in the afternoon & refrigerated till dinner. The only thing I did different was using jarred Barilla Italian sausage sauce. I grated some zucchini & squash & added chopped mushrooms to the meat. Also used Italian seasoning instead of oregano (didn't have it) & added 2 good splashes of red wine before simmering. Next time I'll use less brown sugar it was a tad sweet, but not bad.
Also didn't use parm cheese in the ricotta mixture cause I had none but did add some garlic to it. Absolutely delish & will be my go to lasagna recipe from now on!

This is replacing my other lasagna.  We all loved it.  Took 1 1/2 hours to cook.  Used 9noodles and added mushrooms.  Put foil on top for almost the whole cook time.

I thought this recipe was great. Being that i have only ever "helped" make lasagna, this was the first time i decided to make it on my own. I did read a lot of reviews before attempting it, so i knew i should throw an extra can of diced tomatoes into the sauce. My prep time was way longer than 30 minutes (probably because I kept reading the recipe) other than that it turned out delicious! I did only use 9 lasagna noodles, as many of the other reviewers suggested.

Best easy lasagna recipe yet! I usually substitute cottage cheese for ricotta and it would still end up tasting great. I would go easy on the parsley as well since I am not much of a fan. Thanks for sharing!

This lasagna is the best I've ever eaten.  My family LOVES it. I've made it several times for friends who have new babies or just because and everyone always raves about it.  I've been told this is the best lasagna ever so many times that I feel like a chef.  :) 

I'd suggest adding one 15 oz can of tomato sauce to make the meat mixture less dry.  Also, I use one 14 1/2 oz can of diced tomatoes with the basil, oregano mixture already added and one plain.  I then add the spices the recipe asks for as well.  It's not too much spice.  It's just right.  Also, like others have said, it requires more cooking time in my opinion.  I use an aluminum pan to bake it in, cover the lasagna with non-stick aluminum foil (non-stick side down) and bake at 350 for an hour.  Then, I remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes. 

This recipe is best when you make it and refridgerate it overnight to bake the next day.  Yummy!

I never boil my lasagna noodles. I don't care for 'oven ready' lasagna.  I use regular lasagna noodles, placing them unboiled in the lasagna pan. Then do the layers. The trick is to place it covered with plastic wrap and aluminum foil in the frig and let it sit at least 24 hours.  This lets the sauce get into the noodles and soften them.  Sometimes I'll leave it in the frig for 2 days.  When cooking in oven I leave the plastic wrap on (keeps it more moist), and the foil on--make sure the foil completely covers the plastic wrap.  If I have the time I will put it in the oven at 250 degrees and let it heat up for hours.

I made this the other night for my VERY picky family. I followed the recipe exactly, except the store didn't have fresh basil, so I had to use dried basil. Other than that, it turned out GREAT! Will definately make this a weeknight staple!

Loved this recipe. The reviews are right in that the half hour bake time is a typo--although we found that it didn't need the full 90 minutes either; it's usually done around 70-75. 
The mixtures are a smaller amount than I would prefer to work with, so I like to use a little more ricotta and tomato than recommended to make spreading easier. Some reviewers commented that there is too much meat, but we're huge meat-lovers so the amount works fine for us. Any more than 9 lasagna noodles is excessive.

I have been eating and making lasagne for many years and I have to say this is one of the best recipes I have ever tasted!The consistency was perfect for us. I don't care for "sloppy lasagne", meaning way too much sauce so the noodles float and the whole casserole falls apart when you cut into it. The only change I made was adding some red wine to the sauce, not much, maybe 1/2 cup and adding some basil and increasing the oregano. Reheats well and almost tastes better the next day or even the day after that. EXCELLENT>

My family loved this recipe. I've made it twice and it only gets better each time. The only thing I would add  to this is extra tomato sauce. It's good if you follow the instructions but the extra didn't hurt.

This is a fantastic recipe to crate your own Lasagna, or probably would be great as is. I only made some adjustments because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand, but it came out great! I substituted the fresh basil with some dried Italian seasoning, and the tomatos and tomato paste with a ready made tomato sauce. My family truly loved this lasagna. I'm so glad I found it!

This is great when you add an extra 14,5 oz can of diced tomatoes. I use canned tomatoes/past that all have basil garlic and oregano so I dont have to add that stuff. I also recommend using a 16 oz container of ricotta cheese and a 16 oz container of small curd cottage cheese instead of what the recipe calls for. I also use a lot less onion(personal preferance). I cook it on 375-400 covered w/foil for over 40 minutes, and I use no boil lasagna noodles too.

Made this for a dinner party with RAVE reviews!! I made this 2 days ahead of time, that's what my schedule allowed. I took some advice from others and doubled both the diced canned tomatoes and tomato paste. You only need 9 noodles and it was FULL to the top! Only used one pound of ground beef, 3 cloves of garlic and 2 Tbsp of fresh basil. I also added a tsp of italian seasoning and topped it with more cheese. Bake 1 1/2 hours and it was the BEST lasagna i have ever had!! My guests took home leftovers, they loved it so much!

All I can say is YUM-YUM-YUM!  I have made this at least 10 times, it is my go to crowd pleaser.  My husband is from Italy and gives it a two thumbs up!  The only thing I do differently is that I add a large grated carrot and a grated zucchini to the meat when simmering to add some veggies to it. It will please the pickiest of eaters and it is super easy to make!

This is the worst lasagna I have ever made or eaten, including frozen lasagna.  My husband, who is not a picky eater and loves my cooking (and brags to everyone that he is married to a great cook), told me to throw it out! It was way too dry even after adding the 8 oz can of tomato sauce as most suggested, the cook time is wrong (at the top is said cook for 90 minutes and at the bottom it said to cook for 30 minutes???)and the sauce was bland (maybe that's why it's called American instead of Italian). Not sure how it got a 5 star rating from so many others when the recipe had to be altered by most that liked it. If it's really a 5 star recipe you shouldn't have to change a thing! What a waste of time and money. YUCK :-(

A little on the sweet side.  Definitely use a deep pan or you will have trouble fitting it in.  I would decrease the amount of meat or use a 15 x 11 pan next time.  I took others advice and added tomato sauce and I am glad I did.  I actually added more than one can because it was not "saucy" enough for me.  I also added some wine and I was glad I did that too.  It helped counter some of the sweetness.  I also did as many others did and used partial italian sausage instead of all ground beef.

I have been making Lasagna for 35 years.  I am of Italian descent. NEVER have I baked it for 1 1/2 hrs!  I assemble my lasagna like it says in this recipe & leave out the last topping of mozzarella for later.  I then cover it loosely with foil for 35-40 min, then uncover it and add mozzarella to the top, bake another 10 minutes till the cheese is melted and bubbly.  If you bake this for 1 & 1/2 hrs, you are definitely overbaking it!!!! Let it rest for at least 1 hour to let it set into layers before slicing & serving it.

I have been making this recipe for several years and everyone loves it.  The only changes I made were a little more garlic and about a half a cup of red wine.  It does need a little more sauce so I add an extra can.

I love this recipe! Like others have noted it doesn't make quite enough sauce so I added two cans of tomato sauce. And I added a dash of red pepper flakes for an added kick. It's a new family favorite.

This recipes is the best I have found yet!! I was a little short on time, so I altered it a little. I cooked mine in a glass 9x14 pan and used hot Italian Chicken Sausage and just cut it out of the casing. I browned it with the garlic and onion, but then instead of adding paste and diced tomatoes, sugar, etc, I just added my favorite jarred sauce (2 jars needed) and let the sausage finish in the sauce. 

I also used fresh parsley and the no boil noodles. Added fresh ground pepper and a little bit of garlic powder to my ricotta cheese as well.  I cooked mine covered for 60 minutes in a 375 oven, then 5 uncovered, let it stand for 15 minutes and enjoyed! It was amazing!

This was very good, the best I've ever made.  9 noodles filled my 9x13 cake pan.  I didn't have fresh basil, but it was fine with dried basil.  I substituted 1 lb ground turkey breast for the ground beef, 4 egg whites for the 2 eggs, and cut the shredded mozerella chees to about 3/4 lb.  As for the sauce, I added maybe 1/2 cup of water while it was simmering as it seemed a bit thick.  I also used dried minced garlic instead of fresh.  This recipe is a keeper!

My daughter started using this recipe and her family loves it. I decided to try it and found out how good it really is. It definitely needs more sauce than the original recipe uses. We also use extra mozzarella. We lay our noodles out on waxed paper so they don't stick and then blot them with paper towel. Enjoy!

I like the recipe as written, but to customize it to make it more tasty and easier, this is what I did: 1 lb ground beef, 5 cloves garlic, no basil, oregano or brown sugar, 1 1/2-2 (eyeball it) jars chunky pasta sauce instead of the diced tomatoes and paste, no eggs, 24 oz container cottage cheese, no salt to go with the cottage cheese, and I just used one 8 oz package Italian blend shredded cheese instead of using parmesan and mozzarella. I followed the layering order except instead of the ricotta mix I just spread the cottage cheese w/parsley on the noodles, then followed by the Italian blend cheese. It's much easier this way and still really good. I sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with nonstick spray and baked uncovered 20 min and uncovered 25 more min.

YUMMY!!!! I served this to my family and they all raved over how delicious it was.  I too added a 1-8 oz. can of tomato sauce, and used 3/4 lb.  ground sirloin and 3/4 lb. mild Italian sausage.  It was the BEST Lasagna I've ever made!!!!!

This is really good.  Because of other reviewers comments I added my spices a little at a time until I felt the taste was correct for us.  I also added the extra tomatoes for more sauce.  Didn't have parsley so added italian seasoning to the cheese mix. I won't need a recipe next time.

This is one of the best lasagnas I've had!  We made this the day before and served it for a super bowl party.  Everyone raved about it, and wanted the recipe.  We used half ground turkey and italian sausage and half ricotta cheese & cottage cheese.  I also used Barilla no-boil noodles, which saves some time!  Next time, I'm going to also add fresh sliced mushrooms.  This one is definitely a keeper!

I made this the other day for friends. They didn't eat much of it. I think it was too saucy (my fault for adding more based on reviews) however, it seemed to be missing something.  I believe it needs more cheeses (ricotta & mozz). I will revise next time by using less sauce and more cheeses. The sauce is very good. Like I said, I made the mistake of adding too much of it. Will try again soon.

Absolutely unbelievable!!!!! It turned out excellent! I add 1 pound of Italian sausage and used half of the beef called for. Instead of ricotta cheese I used cottage cheese. I also rubbed each noodle with olive oil after I cooked them.

Really tasty.  The brown sugar adds a new dimension.  I  substituted 1 lb of Italian sausage for part of the ground beef which gave it an added zip.

My family loved this recipe.  The first time I made it, I had to use a bit more ricotta cheese and a little bit more sauce.  Also, it came out just a tad dry but I think if you used some cottage cheese along with the ricotta it would juice it us just enough.  Long story short, I finally found a lasagna that tastes like I think it should.  I love lasagna but there is a particular combination of flavors I was looking for and this one has it!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it was EXCELLENT! My only suggestion is that you make this the day before and refridgerate it overnight and then serve. IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER THE DAY AFTER!

Increased the diced tomatoes to 2 cans and finished layers with more mozza cheese instead of parm.  Very much a crowd pleaser for even my pickiest eaters!  A great dish for special occasions!

YUMMY!!!!  This was my first time making lasagna so I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter.  I did forget to purchase Parmesan cheese when I went shopping for the ingredients so I just left it out but it still turned out terrific!  I'm sure with the Parmesan added it would have been even better.  This one is a keeper ******************************************************************************************************

Edited Dec 2015-this is still my go to recipe for lasagna.  I've started mixing some Italian sausage to the ground beef because we love the extra layer of flavor it gives.  Parmesan cheese does change the flavor as well but it's delish either way.  I have a child with a dairy allergy so I often double the meat sauce and use the extra to pour over spaghetti noodles.

I really loved both making and eating the lasagna. However, I'd recommend using more ground beef.

Update on this lasagna. Made this time with pastured ground lamb using crushed tomatoes and an extra can of diced tomatoes. Lots of garlic and basil. Cooked in convection oven for too long so the edges burned but it was still a big hit at party. Recommend one hour in this type of oven.
-----------
Made with sauteed ground goat meat with about 6 cloves of garlic and added a 2nd bottle of TJ's spaghetti sauce. It was a huge hit at my holiday party!

I used 1/2 lb. sausage and 1 lb. ground beef. I added 1/4 cup cream cheese to the ricotta mixture and 1/2 cup leftover spaghetti sauce to the sauce mixture. A lot of reviewers suggested 1.5 hours cooking time; however, I made the mistake of setting it at this time and not checking it. This cooking time was too long in my oven and the result was burnt edges and slightly burnt top. I will check around 1 hour next time and maybe throw in some pepperoni. Yummy recipe!

I made this recipe tonight and it was a huge success. I had to use two pans because I didn't have the correct size pan available but the lasagna still came out amazing. I followed the exact recipe and didn't make any changes. Highly Recommended!

Made this lasagna for a dinner party yesterday.  Rave reviews from all. I did alter recipe slightly..used 1 lb ground beef/veal in place of ground beef and added 1/2 lb of ground sweet italian sausage.  Browned the sausage separately from the ground beef mix that makes the excellent homemade meat sauce for this lasagna.  Also cooked the lasagna with oven ready noodles according to package directions which was 30 min covered in foil and 15 additional min uncovered.  The fresh basil really adds a nice flavor.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!!

Delicious! As a basic recipe, I give this 5 stars. Of course we modify a recipe to what we have in our kitchen. I followed this exactly plus or minus a few things and I also added extra sauce. I will always use this recipe when I make lasagna if that says anything to you. Very good! Enjoy!

Delicious! My husband and I make this for our friends all the time! It definitely makes enough to share! The only thing I do different is add a (14oz) can of diced tomatoes (get the flavored kind if they have it so it will add more spices). We also add 3-4 cloves of garlic...this dish is huge so you need a little more. Also, I usually get 2 lbs of ground beef (the more meat the better for us). This will definitely fill up a 9 x 13 and sit on top...but I have never had any problems with it running over. I cook mine for 20 minutes uncovered and then 60 minutes cover with foil (make sure you spray the foil so it doesn't stick). It always comes out PERFECT!

I had to make some substitutions to this recipe, but it turned out great!  I had to add a large can of sauce to the recipe, as well as the diced tomatoes and paste, or there would not have been nearly enough sauce!  I removed the casings from some italian sausage and ground up the meat and added it to the beef.  I used dry oven ready noodles, and that did soak up some sauce, so next time I will use the boiled kind.  I baked it for half an hour uncovered, and then covered the pan with foil and cooked it for another hour.  It is a very forgiving recipe, so it is easy to change things around.  I will make this again!

This stuff was incredible!  I made this for my husband's birthday- my first time making lasagna- and it was a HUGE hit.  It cuts beautifully- the first piece came out like a picture.

I did a couple of things differently- I added the extra can of tomato sauce as per suggestions and subbed crushed tomatoes for the diced ones.  I also added 1/2 cup of red wine, used italian sausage along with the beef.  And although I'm sure it's not necessary, I combined cottage cheese with the ricotta because I prefer the texture of cottage cheese.

Although it sounds like I made a lot of changes, I believe that doing this shows how versatile this recipe is, and that is what good cooking is all about! 

Also- definitely refrigerate this overnight before baking!  It makes it taste even better!

Must be American, no vegetables!  I sauteed 8oz of mushrooms, a zucchini (sliced), and a whole green pepper (diced), then added it to the middle layer to give it more taste and nutritional quality.

Good recipe!  It's the only thing American that doesn't suck!

Outstanding!!I made 2 (9x13)sheets of lasagna, so I double the recipe. I used 2 lbs of ground beef and 1 lb of italian sausage.  I also added (2) 8 oz cans of tomatoe sauce (*since i double the recipe) as others suggested.  Didn't need to put any sauce on the bottom, just sprayed pan with Pam. I also added a little mozzarella cheese on the top with the parmesan and topped with some  pepperoni slices for visual appeal and to kind of outline suggested serving pieces.  In a standard 9x13 pan I could only fit 3 strips of noodles side by side on each layer, then 4 on the top kind of over lapping.  But it's OK to have the few extra, especially if some rip apart beyond being salvaged while cooking. It didn't fall apart while cutting or serving! Salad & french loaf garlic bread accompanied this to make a wonderful& filling Mother's day dinner.

VERY VERY yummy!!  As other reviewers suggested, I used half ground beef and half ground sausage...I thought about doubling the sauce but decided not too.  It was great without the extra sauce...not too dry at all.  I will DEFINITLEY make this recipe over and over and over again...I loved the Ricotta cheese mixture, which is surprising because I've always hated lasagna because of the Ricotta.  Big hit at my house with all the friends.

Very good but I also found the sauce to be a tad sweet.  I would cut the brown sugar down to 1 Tbsp. or out altogether.  I added 1/2 Parmesan and 1/2 Pecorino Romano for a stronger taste.  I cut out the salt because there is plenty in the tomatoes and cheeses.  I have a similar recipe that calls for 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage, which is fabulous!

Wonderful, traditional Lasagna.  I was looking for a better lasagna recipe for Christmas and this one sounded just perfect.
  Made this up two days ahead, placed in freezer. Took out of freezer Christmas morn, and into a 250 degree oven about 3 hours prior to dinner, as it had not thawed thoroughly. Turned up the heat to 375 one hour prior and in less than 30 mins, lasagna was ready, complete with oohs and aahs from entire family.

My family liked this recipe, which makes a good, basic lasagna.  I substituted a pound of Italian sausage for a pound of the ground beef and doubled the amount of basil and oregano in this recipe.  I reduced the salt by one teaspoon and reduced the sugar to 1/2 tablespoon or the sauce would have been too sweet.  I also added 6 oz. of water to the sauce to thin it out a bit.

I come from a family of very picky Italian eaters and this rich, hearty lasagna had them talking for days.  I added some spicy and sweet sausage that I purchased from my local butcher.  I took the sausage meat out of the casings and browned it along with the beef.  It adds an extra kick and a little more depth of taste. I also used the lasagna noodles that you don't have to cook before you use them.  You just use them dry as you would regular noodles and they soften while the lasagna bakes. It's a time saver and does not take away from the taste or texture of the lasagna. I don't think 5 stars are enough for this recipe. Definitely better the next day. This recipe inspires taste buds. An exhilarating experience!!!

Awesome! I used to make lasagna with Prego sauce... the way my mother used to. I think this is much better because it isn't runny! It didn't last very long between 5 people.

I have to say that I am so glad to finally find a lasagna recipe that isn't like eating spaghetti.  It can hold its shape and looks beautiful when you cut into.  I can use a spatula to get it out of the pan instead of a ladle. There isn't so much sauce that its over powering all that cheese flavor. 
I make the entire recipe but then cut it in half.  I make it in an 11 x 7 baking dish and freeze the remaining.  It's done in 30 minutes and tastes excellent left over.

A lot of the reviews on here said it needed 1.5 hours to cook, so I followed the recipe to a T and let it cook for about an hour at 375 (the suggested time). The edges were positively burnt and inedible. How disappointing. Next time I won't question the original recipe.

A family favorite.  I use 2 pounds of hamburger because we're a meat lovin family.  I also add 12 ounces of water to the sauce and let it simmer for about an hour.

Absolutely Delicious! My husband and I made this dish together and we used dried basil instead of fresh. We used more ricotta and parmesan because we love the extra cheese. The left overs were just as yummy the next day AND the day after.

I had never in my life made lasagna before this. I wanted to make it for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. I doubled the amount of sauce, and used 9 noodles. There was quite a bit of extra sauce, but the sauce is amazing, and we used it later in the week on top of some spaghetti. With that sauce I used 1.5 lbs of hamberger and it was just right. Everyone in his family loved it. Lasgna is his mom's favorite and she adored it. His dad said it was th best Lasgna he's ever had, and he wasn't just being nice. I made the suace and layered it in a pan the night before, and cooked it the next day. I cooked it for 20 minutes uncovered, 1 hr covered. It was amazing, and if it didn't take so long, I'd make it all the time.

Adding chicken sausage and using ground turkey makes this even better.  I take pride in making this using as many types of cheese as possible.  I also use garlic powder, Italian seasonings, spinach, mushrooms, green bell, lots of fresh cracked pepper, tomato sauce, red bell, celery, onion powder, and celery seed.  As far as amounts go, it's really up to you.  Cooking the garlic, onion, celery, bell peppers, and spices in a bit of olive oil to start the sauce is money!!  It always tastes better a few days later!  Everyone always wants seconds; this recipe with some tweaking can't be beat.

Loved it! Refrigerated overnight and cooked 1hr covered, and then 20-25 min uncovered. I definitely like this recipe much better than the "World's Best Lasagna" recipe found on this site. This one is also cheaper and easier to make.

I found this lasagna not very good...based on reviews, made it for a dinner group and was very dissapointed.  Dry, and the noodles on the bottom overcooked (I always put sauce on the bottom)Although the flavor was good, it was too dry and "cakey"...there just was not enough sauce.  The recipes I've tried before are much better.

It turned out pretty well, except I added an extra can of diced tomatoes, and had to season the sauce a little more to give it more taste.
It's not the best I've had, but still a very hearty satisfying meal.

The basics on this recipe are good, but if you want a truly authentic taste, substitute parsley for the tablespoon of fresh basil, and rosemary for the teaspoon of oregano. Oregano is the 'taste' of pizza...rosemary is the 'taste' of lasagne! It's best to break up the dried rosemary with your fingers. I haven't read all the reviews on this recipe, so maybe someone else has mentioned this...lasagne isn't lasagne without rosemary!

I made this with half ground beef and half italian sausage.  It was very good.  Just a note - you don't need to precook your lasagne noodles (I never do, and you can do this with ANY lasagna noodles, not just the special ones that say "no boil").  Just layer them right out of the box and the liquid from your sauce and cheese mixture is enough to soften and cook the noodles.  Easy.  :)

Awesome! Everyone thinks I make a good lasagna, but this beat mine hands down. I accidently added a 29 ounce can of tomato sauce along with the diced tomatoes (not paying attention), but it still came out perfect.

This is the BEST! Made with oven ready noodles and turned out good. I used crushed tomatoes instead of the diced and added an extra 8 ounces.  Husband agrees that it is Olive Garden quality! Be sure to cook it for 1 - 1.5 hours.

I made this for my sister's birthday party and it is FABULOUS!  I was pleasantly pleased and everyone really loved it!  The only change I made was I used half ground beef and half seasoned sausage.  It looks great, smells great, cuts great and tastes great! It is delicious and I will definately make this again!

I'm doing the ultimate NO NO.  I'm using this recipe for the first time for a dinner party for 10.  It's in the refrigerator waiting to be cooked.  Right now, it look beautiful and smells delicious, can't wait to get it into the oven.  I cut it before cooking.  Makes it easier at serving time.

I'm 24 and I have never cooked anything. This was super easy and tasted amazinnnnng!! These are my deviations from the recipe 1. I used oven ready lasagna 2. Added 1tsp of pepper in step 1 3. Added some tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan to prevent burning 4. I used only egg white because my sister is allergic to egg yolk 5. I used ground chicken because I didn't have ground beef.

Why would anybody bother boiling noodles anymore when you can buy the oven ready and just layer them with the rest of the ingredients....omit the eggs and the sugar also that's not necessary either, your recipe is extra work for nothing. Strangest recipe I've seen for lasagna.  Omit this stuff and it's as Italian as it can get except diced tomatoes should be replaced by sauce.  Sorry didn't like it at all.

I'm not sure if the lasagna I ended up making my lasagna more like this one or the World's Best Lasagna on this site - it was of a combination of the two I guess. There were a lot of good and reviews for both. If I ended up making this one, I did use some italian sausage (I used 1 pound of ground beef and a 1/2 pound of HOT italian sausage since that is what I had). The sauce was really thick so I added an 28oz. can of tomato sauce. Other than that, everything else was pretty much the same.  

I tried to use the slow cooker instead of the oven, mostly to see what the texture would be like, and I think it turned out pretty good. I layered some sauce on the bottom, put a layer of dry (no need to cook ahead) lasagna noodles down, breaking the ones up for the corners so that it was a solid layer. I followed it with the ricotta mixture (I added some thawed chopped spinach to it for the color - about 1/2 the little package, wringing the water out of it first) then the mozarella cheese. I repeated the layer again. Since there was enough sauce leftover, I topped it with the remaining sauce. Cooked on low for about 2-3 hours (lasagna noodles were fully cooked) and then added the remaining mozarella cheese right before turning off the appliance so it would melt but not get rubbery.

we haven't eaten it yet, we're preparing it now..for the sauce, i see a lot of ppl complaining they needed to add more of something to make more sauce..all i did was kept the juice from the tomato can, i didn't drain it. and there's more than enough sauce in the pot right now. other than that, we followed the recipe to the T. hoping it comes out as great as it smells! and yes, watch out for the baking time..let it bake an hour and a half..

Really liked it, But when it came out of the oven I smelled the cheese and diary ingredients more than the sauce.  So, I'll try adjusting it next time.  Tasted wonderful though.

I gave this recipe a four only because it's a little on the dry side as is, otherwise it's an excellent recipe!  My family is small so I make the full recipe and divide it between two 9X9 pans so I can cook one and freeze the other for later.

Made this using veal and slightly less brown sugar and salt. Very "standard" tasting as far as lasagnas go. Would be better with more sauce or less pasta.

This was the best lasagna I ever made. I made the following changes: I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. sweet italian sausage, I used 1/2 whole milk ricotta and 1/2 2percent cottage cheese, I increased the diced tomatoes by one 14.5 oz can, used 3 cloves garlic, increased the spices a little but not the sugar or salt, I didn't have quite enough noodles so I omitted the middle layer and just put all of the ricotta mixture and all of the mozzerella on at once then topped it with the rest of the noodles and the sauce and about a 1/2 cup Parmesan on top. NOTE: I used convection bake for 1/2 hour with it covered and then 1/2 hour uncovered and that worked out beautifully.

I followed Katie's mom's advice (added an extra can of tomatoes) and the sauce was STILL way way way too dry.  The entire sauce recipe needs to double or even triple.  It made it so the noodles were tough (and nearly burned in some spots on the bottom), and the cheese did that stick-to-the-noodle-like-caulking sort of thing.  Everything about this recipe is delicious (the sauce seasoning is perfect) except for that.  Unfortunately, it's a big problem.

Just made it tonight and it was absolutely delicious.  This recipe is far superior and tastier than the top rated World's Best Lasagna on this site.  I followed the recipe exactly but added an extra 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes so it wouldn't be dry and just increased the spices a bit to compensate for the extra can. I also only used 9 noodles. I baked it uncovered for 20 minutes than covered it with foil for another hour. My husband said this one is so flavorful and definitely a keeper.

I made this last night and it is awesome!!! I took the advice of others and added an extra can of diced tomatoes (make sure you don't drain them). I used regular sugar instead of brown sugar only because I didn't have brown sugar, it still taste great. Definitely only use 9 noodles. I made 12 and couldn't fit the last 3. Lastly, you must bake 1 1/2 hours. Take the foil off for the last 20-25 minutes. Make sure to spray Pam or some form of non-stick cooking spray on the foil before you loosely cover the lasagna. Hope this helps!!!!

I've been so cold lately, so I've been craving dishes like this. It was exactly what I needed! The flavor is incredible. I don't make my own sauce, so I was used to store-bought jars in my lasagna and got used to hating lasagna. If nothing else, KEEP this sauce recipe. It's simple and therefore less intimidating.  I cooked my lasagna noodles way early (while initially browning the beef) and they started to get really sticky sitting out. I brushed each noodle, front and back, with some EVOO and I'm holding onto that trick FOREVER. It gave the noodles a little extra flavor and helped them retain moisture while baking. NO DRIED OUT NOODLES! That may not hold up for the leftovers I now have, but it won't break the bank if you have some olive oil sitting around. I also added 1/3 cup cooking wine, as some mentioned, to my sauce. Whatever reaction that had with the tomatoes was spot on. The sauce tasted smoother, not quite as tart. Of course, I only had white cooking wine, so I will probably aim to use a red next time. I'm sure that would match better, but I know at least that I'm keeping that trick too!  Anyway, I served this to my roommates and friends and they were so complimentary. Thank you for a GREAT staple recipe!

We love it.  I add another can of diced or crushed toms, some more spices, and only 1 lb. beef like another reviewer suggested.  ***BUT*** I don't understand why some people are cooking this for 90 minutes.  I tried doing that but it was getting really burned at about the 40 minute mark so I pulled it out and it was great although rather well done.  Almost all the ingredients are already cooked, why are some people needing to cook this for so long?...can anyone explain the mystery?

One of my all time favorite recipes, I've won three pot lucks with this lasagna. Perfect the way it is, although I always top with mozzarella since the sauce does dry out on top. And if I'm feeling really creative I will use half ground beef and half italian sausage which adds terrific flavor. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

This was excellent! I loved the fact that I could make this and put it in the fridge and cook at a later time. Great for working families. I also added one extra can of diced tomatoes and didn't drain it..also added red wine. When I took out of the fridge to cook, I also cooked for about 45 mins covered w/ tin foil, then uncovered for about another 20 mins and it was perfect.

I enjoy making this recipe although it is a bit time consuming. Instead of baking one huge lasagna, I usually split this up into 2 or 3 smaller dishes. My husband always complains that there are not enough noodles in the dish so I tend to layer the cheeses and then a noodle and the meat sauce mixture and another noodle. I also freeze the lasagna before the last baking step altogether and have never had any regrets about this. Also use lasagna noodles which don't need to be pre-cooked, add a bay leaf to the sauce, some pepper and often double up the oregano because I like a bit more flavor to come through. Absolutely better the second day if you let the unfinished dish sit in your fridge overnight as the flavor comes out a lot stronger in everything. I will be looking for a better recipe though, because despite my recent mods, it still tastes too bland.

This was really good however I think the sauce could have been a little thinner.  When I sunk my fork in it you you see the cheese come out, but not the sauce.  Next time I will add a can of tomato sauce.  Great recipe though, very tasty.

This is the first lasagna I have ever made, and I bravely dared to invite my husband's parents over for dinner that night. I was extremely relieved at how well this recipe turned out.  I really have no complaints at all!  Many reviewers thought it was too dry, but I thought the moisture consistency was perfect - I really do not care for a goopy, sloppy lasagna.  Some slight alterations I made based on recommendations were adding about a half cup of wine to the sauce, cut sugar in half, cut salt (to taste), assembling it a day in advance and refrigerate, and covering with foil for the first half hour while baking and then removing it for the final 15-30 mins until it was nice and bubbly.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe, Rosemary Stoker!

I am throwing out my old lasagna recipe! This was delicious and easy to assemble. I have never made lasagna sauce with brown sugar in it so I was a little hesitant, used only 1 tbs. as some had suggested. Next time I will follow the recipe faithfully because I can't see how another tbs. could make it taste other than delicious!! Thanks for such a great posting. Worked very well using regular style noodles uncooked, I just added 30 minutes to cooking time.

This was my first attempt at making lasagna, and I was very successful according to my husband.  The only thing I noticed was that the sauce was a little dry after baking.  Otherwise, I will definitely make this again!

I made this for palm sunday dinner and it was awesome. I even got rave reviews from all the crabs in my family! The only changes I made were the parsley (only had dried) and i used a airbake pan to prevent burning, I also did a thin layer of the sauce mixture on the pan so the noodles wouldnt stick.

It's just a basic lasagna recipe.  Nothing really special here.  And like other reviewers have written, you have to prepare more sauce because there isn't enough.

I found this to be a great recipe, however, I did make several changes.  Using other tips I substituted 1/2 lb. italian sausage for 1/2 lb. of ground meat.  Added 4-5 cloves of garlic to the meat & onions.  I like a lot of seasoning and used 1 teas. oregano, 1 teas. basil and 3 teas.
italian seasoning.  Adding the Italian seasoning in increments until I reached taste I liked.  Also added maybe 1/2 teas. garlic salt.  I used 2 cans 14.5 ounce cans Delmonte Petite Cut Tomatoes, 2 8 oounce cans of Tomato Sauce, 2 8 ounce cans of water and simmered for about two hours - taking lid on and off during simmering.  I used cottage cheese, as I prefer taste and used my Braun mixer to cream it.  I also used 8 ounces Romano cheese and 8 ounces of Mozarella.  It came out wonderful, sliced beautifully and was not dry.
Thank you Rosemary for sharing.  I now have a perfect recipe fitting my taste and my familys. I cooked for 20 minutes covered and 1 hour covered as another reviewer suggested.

The amount of sauce is seriously lacking.  I ended up coating the bottom of the pan with bottled sauce, used the sauce I made on the layers, then topped it with the rest of the bottle and it still was not saucy enough.  Also substituted two Italian Sausages (skinned and crumbled) for half a pound of beef.  Even with the extra flavor from the sausages, it was blah.

I found this recipe to be fantastic!  I doubled the ricotta mixture (just personal taste preference) and covered it with tin foil for the first half hour of cooking and had no problem with anything drying out.  I did find it took a bit over an hour to bake.  But this is the only recipe I'll use now - really impressive lasagna!

I'm always intrigued when I see tons of reviews and the vast majority give a high rating.  So I tried the lasagne last night and it is very good, but I like the veggie one my brother made up much better!  Traditional lasagne recipes that I've been familiar with use sausage, so I did use 1/2 pound of sausage with 1 pound of hamburger; also used fresh oregano since I could go out on my deck and snip some; added a touch of tomato sauce to the diced tomatoes and tomato paste; and added a bit more parmesan just because I like it.  Thanks, Rosemary!

Almost as good as mom's.  I used a 3 lb jar of sauce and didn't simmer as long as recommended. I baked uncovered for 30 min and it was thoroughly heated.

Pretty Darn Good,Rosemary. As other reviewers suggested, I added one 8 ounce can of tomato sauce to the 29ounces of crushed toms and 2 cans tomato paste. I wanted a little more sauce,but not a soupy mess. For the meat in the meat sauce I used 2/3 ground beef and 1/3 pork sausage. We love cheese, so I used 1 1/2 cups Parmesan in with the Mozzarella. Great dish. Everyone loved it. Thanks! OH YES, I, too, reduced the brown sugar to 1T. I liked the taste it added to the sauce.

Fantastic...excellent recipe! Although, there doesn't seem to be enough sauce. I got to the second layer and realized that I wasn't going to have enough to finish layering. To compensate I added a bit of jarred spaghetti sauce to the sauce I had already made. It turned out great! Also, I only needed 9 noodles, not the twelve that the receipe calls for. We are savoring the left overs.

I used sweet Italian turkey sausage, and added more t. sauce.  Maybe I expect
more from lasagna. Wasen't the worst I've made, nor was it the "ultimate" that
everyone else said it was. Sorry to be a downer, but there has to be better out there.

I made this for my birthday . . it was a hit.
Our little town didn't have fresh basil, so I used
a tsp of dried.  Added a bit more garlic and
followed the recipe the rest of the way.  It
was great.  I did prepare it the day before and
it baked up great and was super easy to cut!
What a winner!

This is a very good recipe.  I added about a cup of tomato juice because the sauce was very thick and I was using fresh lasagne noodles which I did not boil first.  I baked it at 350°, covered with foil for an hour, then uncovered it and baked it for an additional 20 minutes.

This was the best lasagna I have ever made.  It was excellent. I added a few modifications, like 1/2lb Italian sausage.  2 cans tomato sauce and a little water (The sauce wasn't quite saucy enough).  Will make over-and-over.

Every bite had a different blend of flavor. This recipe was outstanding. I used 1lb lean ground beef and 1/2lb of italian sausage -- which I removed from the casing and browned with the ground beef. It was fabulous.

I cooked this for my boyfriend and he loved it!  He usually doesn't eat leftovers, which worried me because it was a lot of lasagne for two people to eat in one night.  He ate it for the next three days though, so I knew it was truly delicious.

This is a great base recipe for lasagna when made as written.  I prefer a less dry lasagna so I added an additional can of tomatoes to the sauce, you can add water if it cooks down too thick.  I also prefer to use a mix of mozzarella and provolone cheeses and I use fresh shredded parmasan.   I used to boil the noodles, but now my go-to brand is Barilla and their very thin flat no-cook lasagna noodles are so easy, if you make your sauce in advance you can put this together in 10 minutes and bake in 60-75 minutes, which makes this something I can make on a weeknight.  And yes, occasionally I used jarred sauce for this very reason.

I've been making this lasagna recipe for 30 years now; sometimes I use ricotta layer, sometimes not depending on who its being served to. Agreed there needs to be more sauce for a 9x13 pan but I just multiply the ingredients to accomodate. As well I add about 1/2 cup pasta water to the sauce; it thickens as it cooks when paste is used. I too put a small amount of sauce on the bottom of the pan to prevent the noodles from drying out. Now, for those of you having trouble with the cook time, it shouldn't take more than 45min tops to bake this unless of course you've refrigerated it the night before. I never cover mine with foil, it will obviously take longer to cook when you do that. The cheese on top gets nice dark golden brown and its bubbling over at 30min at 375 degrees. The times at the side of the recipe refer to TOTAL cook time; sauce + noodles + bake time. Try baking first without foil then cover if its getting too brown for your liking. Great recipe, don't mess with it

Overall, pretty easy.  Sauce was great, but simmmering for 30 minutes was too long, it ended up burning a little bit.  Also I would only cook in oven for 20-25 minutes next time.  OR at 350 instead of 375?  I eliminated the salt, doesn't need it, and also would add mozzerella cheese to the top layer next time.  And I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, only because that is what I had, worked fine.  Next time I will try mixing in some sausage too.

Delicious. Best homemade lasagna i've tasted! I only used 1 pound of hamburger and added some red peppers. Instead of ricotta i replaced with cottage cheese. I cooked uncovered for 20 minutes and partially for 60, turned out perfectly cooked.

Used 2lbs of beef, but otherwise adhered to the recipe.  It's good, but the sauce lacked enough flavor.  Future batches will include doubled oregano, minced garlic, possible Italian sausage, red pepper flakes...Sauce needs more zing...

I've been making this lasagna for ten years. I started out making the sauce, but eventually switched to using 4 cups of my own meat sauce, which I usually have in the freezer. I follow the recipe for the rest, sometimes adding a few layers of fresh spinach when I assemble it. My husband and I have a special fondness for this lasagna - I first made it to impress him while we were in college, and now our three young sons gobble it up, too. Thank you, Ethelmertz!

Thought I had a head of garlic...not.  Used garlic powder. Had to add 2 cans of tomato sauce, and still could have used more. The sauce was good, but a little too sweet. Won't use as much brown sugar next time and no more than 1 lb of meat (mixed ground beef and sweet italian sausage). Not sure why, but it tasted salty when all was said and done. I don't make lasagna very often, but I want to give this recipe a try again.

great flavour, a little dry. has a sweet basil taste that is not to over powereing. i used oven ready noddles so i added 1 cup of water to sauce once the sauce had finished simmering and brought the sauce to a quick boil before i began layering. will make again, but i think i'll add another can of paste and maybe a small can of tomatoe sauce. oh and i did not drain the tomatoes.

I cooked the noodles first to ensure there was enough sauce. Also I added a jar of spaghetti sauce to the diced tomatoes and it didn't have near enough sauce. It actually looked like there was only meat on the noodles.

I'm making this for dinner tonight....just wanted to say I did use 12 lasagna noodles as original recipe called for...someone said it only needed 9 with 3 layers of 3 noodles.  When you use a 9X13 in pan you do need 4 noodles per layer...3 side by side and one across the bottom of the pan....so you do use 12 noodles total with this method...I don't have a special deep lasagna pan...maybe that would only need 3 noodles per layer??

First time making sauce and lasagna and it came out awesome! The only thing I think that was missing was lack of seasoning so I added more while I was cooking. Total time cooking was about 1hr and 10 minutes and then a reheat of about 30 minutes. I followed the advice of first cooking it with no cover and then loosely covering it. I used fresh mozzarella that I just cut into small pieces and can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I had no left overs! Really a great success thank you so much for this recipe it gives me confidence to try other Italian dishes. Happy Holidays!

I really liked the flavor of this lasagna but I thought the sauce was a bit dry. Next time I will add a 14 oz. can of tomato sauce. I made the mistake of using San Giorgio's no bake lasagna. This is a terrible brand for no bake lasagna.  It is VERY THIN. Because the pasta was not detectable, the sauce overpowered the whole dish. If you must use no bake lasagna, go with Barilla. I've used it before, but the store didn't sell any.  Next time I will put in more effort and cook my own lasagana.

I followed the recipe to the T and it was delicious.  I will use the sauce recipe again for just spaghetti and meatballs.

I've been making this lasagna for years.  Everyone loves it!  The only change I made was decreasing the salt because we have to lower our sodium.

Just finished making this for a movie night with a guy I just started seeing.  Of course, I tasted it first and it is SOO GOOOODDDD!  I used 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes.  One of them was pre-flavored with basil, oregano and garlic.  I only used 9 lasagna noodles and I used the no-boil kind.  He's on his way over, and I know he'll be impressed.  Lasagna is his favorite food.  *bonus points*!!  LOL

Good recipe.  I like how the author uses dry ingredients instead of fresh due to the small amount of oregano and basil.  My preference is to have more sauce, so I added an additional 15 oz can of tomato sauce to the meat mix.

This turned out great and so very tasty.  Every one came back for seconds.  We did add some additional spaghetti sauce (we did not have extra diced tomatoes around). We did not think the ricotta mixture was enough, so we will make more next time. We did cook it longer.  We covered it with aluminum foil for 30 mins and then cook uncovered for 30 mins and it was perfect on 350 degrees.  It was simple but very tasty.  We will definitely make it again!

We love lasagna, but I hate how long it takes. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except that I didn't have any paste or diced tomatoes. Instead I used a 15 oz can of stewed tomatoes and a 16-ounce jar of tomato sauce. I would've preferred the paste, I think. I also would've saved more mozzarella cheese for the top. Overall, it's delicious.

I bought a 32 oz of ricotta cheese and used about ¾ of it.  I also used ground turkey.  Turned out great!!!  Will definitely make it again.

I personally don't like lasagna but my boyfriend/family/friend love it and I have been making this for years. The only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is because I think it should call for more ricotta to give it a nicer layered look.

My husband and I LOVED this lasagna.  This is our lasagna recipe from now on.  I didn't even have any parmesan cheese--which could only make it better--and it was still wonderful!  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was the first lasagna I've made in 10 years. I don't like sausage so I never attempted it till I found this recipe which uses ground beef instead. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great. The only thing I would change for next time, is to use less meat other than that i wouldn't change a thing.

THE best lasagna I've ever tasted!  And, it fits in a regular 9x13 pan, so you don't have to buy a new pan or plan for your meal flowing over the sides and ending up burnt at the bottom of your oven.  Everyone I've given this recipe to thinks it's the best they've ever had.  I do only make two layers, rather than three, because it's a lot easier to divide up evenly and get into the pan.  I've even made this is a giant crock pot (without first cooking the noodles) and it worked beautifully there, too.  Try this recipe!  You can't go wrong!

This is the best lasagna ever! I have made this recipe for a little over 5 years and it is always a winner!
Last night I made the "World's Best Lasagna" from this site and the whole family was disappointed. Everyone agreed that this will be the only recipe I make for lasagna. I do cheat by using 1 jar of Ragu (traditional), 1 can of tomato paiste and a small can of tomato sauce along with the basil, oregano and b. sugar that the recipe calls for. I also double the ricotta and the mozzarella. Yum---it's the best.

This was very good.  But for anyone who is planning on making it - please (as others here have suggested) make a little extra sauce.  And DO NOT USE the oven ready noodles.  I did it to save a little time.  Mistake.  Unless you have enough sauce to cover all of the noodle the ends stick out and are as hard and brittle as can be.  Oh well.  I would like to make this again.  I will not use 12 noodles if I do.  Another reviewer suggested 9.  That would be perfect.  Also, if you like ricotta cheese (I love it) you may want to buy the 2lb. container instead of just a pint.  Maybe use half of that.  The sauce was yummy.  I think it needs to be a little spicier.  Of course that's a personal preference.  I will definitely try to make this again.

I doubled the sauce and added italian sausage with the pound of ground beef.  I also cooked it for 40 minutes covered, then 20 minutes uncovered.  I thought this was perfect, exactly the way I wanted it.  I'm giving it a four star rating because of my variations.

Absolutely delicious!! Family loved it, and it was even better the next day! Only changes I made were more meat than called for (2 lb.), and I used the oven-ready noodles (PARTIALLY cooked in salted water), which helped to absorb some of the liquid when baking. This was the first time my lasagna stayed together and actually looked like lasagna when I served it.  :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made a few changes & this is a VERY good lasagna, made it with 1 lb of ground beef & 1 lb of mild sausage, only used 1/2 an onion & 1/2 the salt it called for, increased the garlic to 4 cloves and increased the diced tomatoes to 48 ounces of crushed tomatoes (only because my kids won't eat chunks of tomatoes) they were seasoned crushed tomatoes with garlic & basil. Also increased the cheese to 1 1/2 pounds of mozarella, 1 lb just didn't seem like enough. Added about a 1/4 cup of red wine to the sauce because I was afraid of it being dry from the other reviews. By adding the extra tomato sauce & the wine it was plenty & turned out terrific, I did add some mushrooms to 1/2 of it (for the adults) and everyone loved it. I did make it the night before in a disposable pan & put in the fridge till the next day & then baked it for 1 hour the next day. I would definately make this again.

Delicious! My husband said that this is something you would find at a restaurant. I added some crushed red pepper flakes and red wine to the meat sauce. I also used some plain tomato sauce to spread over the bottom of the pan to keep the noodles from drying out and doubled up the number of noodles per layer. This will be a favorite!

This was the best lasagna I have ever made.  The sauce is awesome.  The only problem was I read a review saying it should cook for 1 1/2 hours instead of 1/2 hour.  We went to a movie and came back to burnt lasagna.  I'm thinking an hour is sufficient.

YumYumYum!  I had an EXCELLENT lasagna dinner tonight!  This is the best lasagna I've ever had, but I gave it only 4/5 stars because I made a few changes:

*Instead of ground beef, I used half ground turkey, half spicy italian turkey sausage.

*Instead of fresh basil, I used dried because this is all I had on hand.

*I nixed the diced tomatoes because I don't prefer them, and I thought it would make for too thick of a sauce.  I substituted 1/2 can of *crushed* tomatoes.

*As the sauce was a little too thick with all of that meat, I thinned it out using Ragu Robusto Roasted Garlic Spaghetti Sauce.  Ended up using about 1/3 of a jar.

*I did not use all of the mozzerella, as it seemed like too much, and I used light ricotta to save a few unnoticed calories.

Also wanted to note that I halved this recipe, and it is still plenty for dinner and 2 days of lunch for my husband and I. With these few changes, this was excellent!  The spiciness of the sausage balanced out the *slight* sweetness of the sauce perfectly.  Definitely a keeper.

If you love meat lasagna-you'll love this recipe.  Very delicious.  In reading other reviews I didn't want it to come out dry so I added an extra can of diced tomatoes. Not dry at all!  I used the diced tomatoes flavored with onion/garlic and the tomatoe paste flavored with herbs to give it an extra good taste.  I used the lasagna noodles that you don't have to boil which cut back on the prep time.  Def worth making!

I was so excited to try this recipe because of the great reviews; however, I was disappointed. There is way too much meat for our taste and not enough sauce like many of the reviewers said, and that was even after adding an extra can of tomato sauce. No one in the family even wanted to eat the leftovers (and there were a lot). I will not make this again.

I took some other reviewers advise and added more garlic, 1/4 cup red wine, a dash of hot pepper flakes, and 1/2 the ground beef plus an equal amount of turkey sausage. (I don't eat pork, or would use real sausage.)  And not only have I been told this is the best lasagna that my friends have had, I've now been commisioned by the neighbors to  make this for them!  Just a side note: The hot pepper flakes were a brillant idea!  It added just a tiny bit of kick (not to much to over power) but enough to make you sit up a little straighter. Thank you for the receipe!

I made this for a "birthday dinner" and it turned out fantastic.  My mom even admitted that it was better than her lasagna (which everyone loves).  Although this takes some time (like most lasagnas) it was very easy, and this was the first time I have made lasagna.  I did, however, substitute 1 lb ground turkey + 1/2 lb ground italian sausage for the ground beef.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

Add 14oz can tomato sauce and this recipe is perfect.  Single serve portions freeze and reheat well.

I wasn't that impressed with this lasagne.  It seemed like alot of preparation & time for just ok results.  The sauce needs some more zing it is bland.  I did add red pepper but that didn't seem to be enough.  If you make this I would add more spices & maybe even some veggies to add more flavor.

I have to add my 5 stars to the long list of others.  By way of background, I was taught how to cook Italian by a former boyfriend's 1st generation Italian mother.  If I was going to cook for her son, I'd better do it right!  So I'm no stranger to really good lasagna.  This, however, is a fabulous version that doesn't take as much time as my "authentic" method.  An added bonus:  I used no boil lasagna noodles and you can't tell that I did.  The only adjustment I made was to use 3 cans of petite cut basil/garlic tomatoes so there would be enough liquid and I baked the lasagna for 50 minutes covered, then another 15 minutes without the foil.  As far as meat, I used 1lb ground beef and about 1/2 lb of Italian sausage.  Also, I ALWAYS use Lawry's seasoning salt instead of regular table salt in all my recipes with good success.  You must try this lasagna.  It's my husband's favorite (even over the authentic version!) and lasagna is his favorite food, so he's somewhat of an expert.  Try this recipe-- you won't be disappointed!

This was ok. I have tried many different recipes on this web site that have been far superior to this. It tasted like a regular lasagna. Nothing that spectacular to rave about, & a bit of work too boot. Try the chicken cajun pasta or the spaghtetti carbonara for great recipes.

I found this to be just OK. Will not be making again though. It wasn't bad, I ate it but nothing that made me say 'Mmmm..' Still looking for that great lasagna recipe. My husband liked it this better than I did. But still it wasn't a favorite for either of us. I also had to add more sauce.

I thought that this was okay.  I was disappointed with the homemade tomato sauce.  I could have saved a lot of time by just using Ragu.  I think that I will try this again using the marinara sauce on the website and see if that's any better.

I made this for dinner tonight for my in-laws.  They both said it was the best lasagna they've ever had.  I used fresh herbs (basil, oregano parsley) and freshly grated parmesan and prepared it 2 days in advance.  Its also nice that way because there's no big mess to clean up if you're having company.  

The recipe doesn't specify whether to cook covered or uncovered. (Maybe implied uncovered). I put a loose piece of foil over the top.  I think that cooking it covered would help to retain the moisture.

I've made this lasagna numerous times, and it always goes over extremely well with my guests. My extremely picky boyfriend always comes back for seconds and thirds, and makes an exception to his "no reheated pasta leftovers" rule for this recipe. I did find that it needs more sauce, and I personally enjoy more tomatoes as well, so I always add an extra can of tomatoes and an extra can of paste (both small cans) and then add some red wine, and allow to simmer. I've found the red wine adds a nice touch to the flavour of the lasagna. Thanks Rosemary, for a delicious recipe!

Made this last night for my new boyfriend so really wanted to impress him. Used all fresh herbs, 1/2 cup red wine, pork and beef, more garlic, 1/2 jar sauce, extra tin of tomatoes. If he liked me before he really likes me now, he even asked if he could bring some home to his mother, so this recipe is a double winner in my books. My cousin always says that this is the kind of lasagne you get in good restaurant. Everyone should make this, it is the very very best ever. Thank you!!

This was one of the best lasagnas I have ever made, and my family loved it.  I added an extra 15 oz can of diced tomatoes (I used the roasted garlic kind for both cans), and used 1/2 pound of sliced hot sausage and reduced the hamburg to a pound.  I will definitely make this again!

Good but not great.  The sauce is more sweet than I like.  I think the sugar overpowered the other flavors.  You really couldn't taste the basil or garlic.  And the leftovers were really sweet!  I cut the assembly time by using those new no-boil lasagna noodles.

Excellent recipe! i'm a beginner at cooking.. and my husband said it's the best lasagna he ever had! However, it's a little bit on the sweet side.. use 1 tbsp instead of 2 tbsp of brown sugar.

The sauce recipe for this lasagna was great. The way the recipe was broken down and explained made this the easiest lasagna I have ever made.  I made it the day before we ate it to let the flavors mix and it took 2 hours to bake.

I search for recipes that are acclaimed by "picky eaters".  My boyfriend is the pickiest eater I know who will never clean his plate.

I made this recipe with a few modifications, I used sausage with the beef, reduced the sugar and salt a bit and added a cup of shredded cheese on the top, in addition to the parmesan.

I must say, this is the best lasagne BOTH of us have ever had.  And those words aren't to be taken lightly, coming from my boyfriend!  In his own words, it was a "tastebud explosion" and a half hour after eating, he said his "mouth is still singing".  

This was the first time I'd made lasagne, and I will be e-mailing this recipe to my entire family!.  

Definitely reccomended for those who have picky eaters to cook for!

We loved this recipe.  I took the advice of others here and used half italian sausage and the other half hamburger and this was just delicious.  It was not runny as my lasagna usually is.  I would make this again and again.  Surprisingly, it was less expensive than my normal recipe and we liked this one much better.

My husband told me to stop looking.  This is going to be "my" lasagna recipe.  This makes a very full pan of really great lasagna.  I doubled the sauce and was liberal with it, but I froze a little to make spaghetti with later.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks a lot!

First lasagna I ever made that didn't run.  It was superb! I crumbled a bit of hot italian sausage in with the ground beef and on the top, and also omitted the brown sugar.  I cook for the most honest of critics...he looked me straight in the eye and said, "this is the best lasagna I have ever had"...after that he just kept eating and eating....

I cut out the salt and sauteed the onion, garlic and beef in olive oil.  I also used diced tomatoes already seasoned with basil, oregano and garlic.  I refrigerated it overnight and baked for 40 minutes the next day.  I was afraid that the lasagna would turn out dry (hate that!), but it was very moist and saucy without falling apart.  The sauce is very sweet and has a nice flavor.  I already had a very good, but time-consuming, lasagna recipe which I usually made, but I think I will use this recipe from now on.  It's a good, basic recipe that you can add to and doesn't take long to assemble.

Pet peeve:  runny, sloppy lasagne! Problem solved.  This came out just perfect.  It cuts like a cake and tastes awesome.  Also, you can do a lot with this basic recipe, add veggies, sausage, extra cheese, etc.

This was the best!!  If  you don't like the top layer of noodles to dry out, top it with sliced pepperoni!!  It's great, adds flavor AND keeps the noodles moist, while adding a little more Italian!!  Joni

This recipie is very good.  I also thought that I would not have enough sauce but it was perfect.  I thinks this helps the lasagna to be firm and not drippy.  Excellent firmness!!!  However, I will lessen or take the sugar out all together.  Besides that the family loved it.

This lasagna was delicious and my picky husband loved it.  The only problem is that we don't usually like large chunks of tomato.  I broke them up a bit while simmering.

As a young cook, I had been searching for the perfect recipe to cook for when my friends came over.  I was able to cook this a day ahead and popped it in the oven when they arrived.  I can't explain how many Oooh's and Aaah's I got from this recipe.  It might take a while to prepare, but believe me, it's worth it in the end!

This recipe is really easy to make and tastes great. My mother has me make it for her every time I visit. She freezes pieces and takes them to lunch. :)

So delicious! I traded in the ground beef for ground turkey. The brown sugar really pulled the dish together. Definitely a new recipe for this family.

The only change I made, was I used 1 lb of hamburger and 1/2 lb of ground Italian sausage.  Absolutely amazing!  Family favorite!  Everyone had seconds and even better leftovers the next day!

I really loved this recipe the way the cheese complimented the beef was spectacular. The main piece of advice I would give is to make sure the dish you use isn't too big because mine was and I so I only had enough lasagne noodles and sauce for two layers.

My husband makes this lasagna exactly as the recipe instructs and it's the best lasagna ever. We will never use another lasagna recipe again because I know we'll just be comparing everything to how good this one is. Seriously, no modifications needed. It's fantastic!

Wonderful recipe! I just gotta comment about the cheese sauce because that's what made this dish a little rich! I suggest that you use a normal cheese sauce like with milk, flour as this one just too rich! Other than the cheese sauce, this is one fab recipe!

For my first try at lasagna this turned out pretty good. I took a lot of different suggestions from the reviews. I used cooked noodles instead of uncooked, I doubled on the spices a bit, and I used three 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes to keep from having a dry sauce. I didn't have any basil on hand so I substituted that for Italian Seasonings. I also left it in the fridge overnight covered before baking. It turned out really tasty.

Lots of dirty dishes making this dish, but it was good.  I added mushrooms to the sauce, added and extra 15oz of diced italien tomatos, and used ready to bake noodles.  Served with a green salad and garlic bread. I'm not crazy about lasagna to begin with, but my husband is and he devoured this.

made some changes: used 1 lb. ground turkey and added olive oil when browning since turkey doesn't have much fat to it, used 2 bottles ragu vegetable primavera sauce and seasoned to taste (added red pepper flakes, parsley, oregano), used 1lb shredded smoked gouda instead of mozzarella, used ricotta 1/2 amt of ricotta, omitted brown sugar and basil. Put sauce as bottom layer and covered with pam covered aluminum foil so it won't stick. Verrry Tasty!! Will make again!

Great flavor, needed improvements for perfection: 1) I used 1lb spicy sausage, 1/2lb beef.  2) Alter recipe to triple sauce: triple tomatoes, paste, oregano, salt and basil. 3) Use no boil pasta.

Darn. I followed the recipe exactly, and this was so very dry. Really disappointing. Unless you make a LOT of modifications (like doubling or tripling the sauce) - I'd steer clear.

This was a very good lasagna.  While preparing thou, it was too dry for my personal taste so I added a 15oz can of tomato sauce.  Other than that, I followed exactly.  Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made this it was good but didn't have enough sauce. 

This time I made the following modifications and it was GREAT:
- Add 1 can of tomato sauce for moisture
- Don't drain diced tomatoes
- Don't pre-cook noodles (but cook covered with aluminum foil)
- 1/2 lb ground beef
- layer order: sauce, noodles, ricotta, mozzarella (repeat once) (sauce first to prevent noodles from sticking to pan)
- cook for 1 hour instead of 30 minutes
- brown top for an extra 5 minutes without aluminum foil

With these modifications it tasted great! I don't think I'd change much of anything else, except MAYBE adding two cans of tomato sauce instead of just one so it will have a little more sauce. But I don't know, it does taste great as is.

This lasagna was simple and very good. I would make a couple of changes next time I try it.  I would add sweet italian sausage and less sugar. All in all it was a good recipe as is.

I have made lasagnas in the past and I think I kind of winged it. I was looking for a great recipe and by these reviews I thought I can't go wrong. WOW was I right! This is my new lasagna recipe! It had just the right flavor (I did take other reviewers advice and added more diced tomatoes and spices) I am so glad I found this recipe. I never review anything on this web site and I use it often, but this had to be reviewed! Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this lasagna!  I'm not a big fan of sausage or fennel so this recipe gives me just the flavor I'm looking for.  I usually leave the onions out (there are a couple of picky eaters in my family) and the flavor is still excellent.

30 minutes would have been plenty of time. I made the mistake of taking the advice of other reviewers and cooked it way too long. I got really crusty noodles. One piece of advice I should have taken was to make more sauce. Mine turned out crusty and a little dry. Really delicious taste though, based on that, 4 stars.

WOW!! This recipe is amazing. Trust me, I'm seventeen and I made this recipe with ease! If i can do it, anybody can! (:  I took the advice of adding extra tomatoes/spices and only using 9 noodles rather than 12. It turned out absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and my dad both had three servings and gave it five stars! My boyfriend says he will get fat if i keep cooking such delicious food!   Also, I didn't bake for an hour. Mine turned out fine after 30 minutes!

Wow!  This was really fantastic. Full of flavor, a hearty meal!  Doubled onion, garlic, seasonings (except the brown sugar) & tomato paste and had just the right amount of sauce. I also doubled the Ricotta mix and added a lil 1% cottage cheese. I let this sit in the fridge overnight before baking the following evening. I was really impressed. This recipe's a keeper for sure!  Thanks!

This was wonderful! I will definitely make this again. Here are my changes: I used 1 lb italian sausage and 1/2 lb of ground sirloin. I also added a couple handfuls of pepperoni. When browning the meat, I seasoned with garlic powder, salt, pepper and all-purpose greek seasoning. Instead of fresh basil, I used dried. I added one extra can of diced tomatoes. Cooking time was 45 minutes covered. I took it out and then added the parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese and cooked for 20 more min.

Pretty good basic recipe.  I like it because you make your own sauce.  There is something in prepared pasta sauce that upsets my stepdad's stomach so he could eat this. I added an extra 14 oz can of diced tomatoes to the sauce and some extra herbs and spices to compensate.  I also added 2 bay leaves to the sauce while it simmered, then removed them.  I baked it uncovered for about 25 minutes, then topped it with mozzerella cheese and baked for another 20 minutes.  It was a big hit in my family.

This was my first attempt at homemade lasagna. It turned out perfectly, and my 20+ guests all raved about it. I did add the extra can of diced tomatoes, and a little extra garlic. I used half Italian sausage, and half ground beef. 9 lasagna noodles were plenty. I personally loved the sweetness that the brown sugar added to the sauce. Topped with mozzarella, and baked covered for one hour, then uncovered for half an hour. Oh! Add a little sauce to the bottom of the pan, before your first layer of noodles, to keep them from drying out! Scrumptious, and will definitely be making again. I'm already getting requests from my hubby for more!

This recipe is absolutely heavenly!  My friends and family members always beg me to make it more often.  I also find it convenient that I can make it ahead and freeze it for when I need a meal that feeds a crowd in a pinch.

I've been making this lasagna recipe for a couple of years now and it always comes out great. It feeds a lot of people and is definitely a crowd pleaser. The only change I make is to add less brown sugar than 2 tablespoons. I don't like the sauce to be so sweet. Other than that, this is a great recipe to keep going back to.

I don't actually want to rate the recipe as posted because I didn't stick exactly to it; i followed the other reviewers' suggestions and I think there should be an additional rating for "how it turned out". And I did have high expectations.  Yes, I know; "it isn't fair to dock points if you change something" but I felt like I had to comment and say what my experience was.  I cut back on the noodles and cheese, added more tomatoes for sauce, and baked the lasagne for 1.5 hours.  This was WAY too long. The whole lasagne was dry and gummy. I also felt like it was really bland, like leftover potluck lasagne ot something.  This needs some sort of kick, but I don't know if I'll use it again; might try for something lighter.  My boyfriend really enjoyed it, though - thank you for the recipe! :)

A perfect lasagna with a few alterations. I am not a fan of dry lasagna, so I doubled the sauce and used about 2/3 of it to make the dish. I also added grated carrot to the sauce and decreased the amount of sugar. I used a combination of ground beef (1/3 lb) and spicy italian sausage (1/3 lb). I'm allergic to wheat so I used Tinkyada rice lasagna noodles (available at Whole Foods) in place of traditional lasagna noodles. They tend to absorb a lot of liquid and become mushy so I boiled them for less time and relied on the extra sauce to cook them through. Great lasagna can still be enjoyed by those of us who are gluten-intolerant. Everyone loved it!

This is the first time I have ever made lasagna from scratch and it turned out wonderful! Although, you do need to add an extra can of tomato paste or diced tomatoes if you want sauce on your top layer. I also added a little more garlic. I baked it for 30 minutes and it was warm but not hot, so i put it in the oven for 30 more minutes and it was perfect!

A definite "go to" recipie for a crowd! I make the following minor modifications: 1.) Use l lb. of ground beef, and 1/2 lb. of ground italian sausage. 2.) Use cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I think the ricotta can be a little too dry at times. 3.) You can use no-boil lasagna noodles and save some time. 4.) Do not forget the brown sugar. It cuts the acidity of the tomatoes and is critical. 5.) Use extra mozzarella cheese whenever it is called for! I get rave reviews for this every time I make it!

The meat sauce can run a little short so I do usually have to add an extra can of diced tomatoes and tomato paste and even it out with some extra spices(it doesn't need extra brown sugar). Takes a little more time than some other lasagna recipes but is well worth it. Love this recipe and my boyfriend gets very excited when I make it. He likes it when I mix half ricotta, half cottage cheese.

I rated this 5 stars only if you make double sauce.  Otherwise it would be a 4.  I've made it both ways and it is a little too dry without the extra sauce.  When I doubled the sauce it was perfect.  One of the best lasagnas I've ever had.

YUM! This is what lasagna is supposed to look and taste like! I loved the thick and meaty sauce. As another reviewer mentioned, this actually holds its shape when you cut it - unlike many lasagnas that leave you with a watery puddle of sauce in the middle of the pan! I made only very minor tweaks to the recipe - added a drizzle of olive oil to the meat sauce while it was simmering, used a parm/romano/asiago blend instead of regular parmesan, and I also saved some of the mozzarella cheese to add over the top layer of noodles/sauce. Made the night before, then baked it covered for 40 minutes, uncovered for 10. Perfect!

I made this for company, and it was well received. The only thing I would suggest is don't forget the salt!  I cut it back to 1/2 tsp because of the high sodium content of the recipe, but it just wasn't enough. It still turned out pretty good, though. Thanks!

This recipe is great! I made a few changes: replaced the ground beef with ground turkey, used dried oregano, basil, bay leaves, parsley and thyme instead of fresh herbs, no brown sugar, prepared tomato sauce, and I added the parmesan to the ricotta and egg mixture, plus used it like another layer in the dish. This is great with garlic bread and a salad. Yum yum!!

I just give it 4* 'cause i made lots of changes. I did make it yesterday (didn't bake it till today) and put in the fridge overnight to let the flavors combine all together. Added 1 cup chopped "jamón serrano" (cured ham??) to the ground meat, 2 extra minced garlic cloves, cayenne pepper and canned mushrooms. Since i couldn't find tomato paste here in my city, i used 1 can (for about 20 ounces) pureed tomato. Also covered the noodles with cooked ham and used light cottage cheese instead of ricotta, which i mixed with spinach (omitted the eggs). And the best of all, topped with garlic bechamel sauce (2 tablespoons flour, 2 cloves of garlic minced, 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt and white pepper to taste, and milk) and sprinkled cheese over it.....voilá!! even my mom raved about it (she's not a big lasagna fan)!!!! AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! of course, i will be making this again.

Good! I bought 3 disposable loaf pans for the lasagna, cooked one and froze two of them for a later day, since it was only my husband and I eating. I used 1 lb Italian Sausage and 1/2 lb of beef, and, as I don't really like the texture of stewed tomatoes, I bought 2 15 oz cans of pureed tomatoes instead. Had way too much sauce and froze the rest for spaghetti. 
I'm just learning to cook but it was easy and my husband could actually eat it, which is a step up from my last attempts at cooking.

This is a wonderful lasanga recipe!! Every time I make it I get rave reviews.  One little addition we make is adding thin slices of cream cheese to one of the layers.  This adds a nice creamy texture to the lasagna.  I like the idea of adding more sauce to the recipe (as some previous reviews noted)... I do seem to run a little low by the time I'm ready to assemble the entire dish.  But it's ABSOLUTELY wonderful!  Thank-you!

I was NOT a fan.  I figured since this was a hall of famer - I would put it up against my tried and true recipe and it paled in comparison.  The recipe I normally cook uses a half and half mixture of Italian sausage and Hamburger and has more cheeses and spices.  This was bland and boring to me...Sorry - I know I am in the minority - but what is all the hubbub here?

Really Yummy Lasagna! I made several changes and some based on other reviews. Used 1 pound hot italian sausage and 1 pound regular italian sausage. I omitted the parsley since we both didn't really care for it. Used two 15 ounce low fat ricotta cheese and reduced the amount of salt for the cheese mixture to 1/2 tsp only. Put more garlic and dried oregano, and the sauce got a little too thick so I added around 1/2 C of traditional spaghetti sauce into the sauce mixture. You just add it until it gets to the thickness you prefer. Also, I used the Barilla no boil lasagna. I noticed some people used this and turned out bad. Mine turned out perfectly the same as the regular boil lasagna. The only difference is that the no boil one saves so much time!.  Since I used the no boil lasagna, it took 50 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered. ( I chilled my lasagna overnight before baking). Don't forget to use the non stick coating spray onto the foil so the cheese don't stick. Next time, I might add some pepperoni and try to use 9 noodles instead of 12. Mine turned out soooooo good already though. Thanks a lot for the recipE!

I was very hesitant to try this as the sauce seemed too simple to be very good.  I am very glad that I did however, because my family and I like this one as much as my own and this one is much easier to prepare.  The only adjustment I made was to substitute tomato sauce for the diced tomatoes because even though my kids love marinara, ketchup, etc.  Heaven forbid they should see an acutal tomato because then its "gross".  The sauce has a very nice but not overpowering flavor.  I highly recommend leaving in the fridge overnight because the flavors are stronger.  This recipe is proof that good does not = difficult.  Thank you for a simple and tasty dish.

A very good lasagna recipe.  I made a few minor changes to the recipe, but overall I was very pleased with the result.  I cooked the sauce in the slow cooker for about 6 hours.  I used no-boiling required noodles from Barilla and WILL NOT be using them again. (I thought they were too thin and had no "substance" to them.)  I used 1 lb. of ground beef and 0.5 lb. Italian Sausage.  I probably threw in a little extra garlic because my husband LOVES it.  I had no problems with dryness as other reviewers have mentioned.  Overall, this is a definite keeper, and I will be making it again and again.

SOOO good! I added a little hot sauce to the meat sauce, and I'm pretty sure I used more garlic then called for. I used half ricotta and half cottage cheese, and I added some nutmeg. Really good!

I made this recipe (minus the salt) for a luncheon. It was delicious. Based on others reviews, I left out the salt, and used white sugar instead of brown sugar (didn't have any in the house), and it was super! They all asked for the recipe! Well Done!

I made this for a dinner party & it went over very well.  I did take the advice of the reviews & doubled the tomatoes needed and it turned out well & not dried out.  Definitely need a bigger pan than a 9x13 though because I used a 9x13 & could only do 3 layers (probably because I doubled the tomatoes though also).  I also used italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Can definitely be made ahead of time & even frozen if you wanted to.  I may suggest maybe making the sauce ahead of time, refrigerating or freezing that separately and then assembling it maybe a day or two before hand.  I don't know if I'd freeze it all made up.

This lasagna was absolutely delicious.  I was not a lasagna fan until I made this recipe.  Since I had spaghetti meat sauce made with Ragu and other spices in the freezer, I used that and added Italian sausage.  I used the Sargento 6 cheese packs, that included smoked Asiago.  My husband who doesn't eat pasta, ate the sauce but left the pasta.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it.  The presentation was also beautiful.

Tremendously good!  My husband and I loved it.  Kids ate it, too.  I used no boil lasagne noodles, which, as usual, gave me some headaches because I had trouble covering everything before running out of sauce.  Also, I refrigerated it overnight before baking, and by the time I baked it the no-boil noodles had curled up a bit.  I ended up with a few crunchy edges.  Next time I'll probably boil the noodles first. I noticed other reviewers said they added extra tomatoes to the sauce to make it saucier.  I will say that this recipe is not "saucy," but having said that, it is still very moist and delicious, and I've never had a lasagne slice and serve so easily.  The lack of runny sauce allows it to set up very well so the slices hold together when serving.  I will probably stick with the recipe as-is if I boil the noodles first, but maybe add extra tomatoes if I use no-boil noodles to make sure I have enough sauce to cover.  Either way, this recipe is a winner!  Leftovers freeze well, too.

We REALLY enjoyed this! I used a little over a pound of beef, plus one pack of mild Italian sausage, all browned together; ended up splitting this into an 11x7 for us and a large pie pan for someone else. Curious to know how this would turn out the "no boil" lasagna noodle way, to save time. Thanks for sharing - a definite keeper!

This is one of the best lasagna recipes that I have ever tried! Even my picky 6 year old tried it and loved every bite! The only thing that I changed was that I used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta mixture as my husband prefers the taste of cottage cheese. Looking forward to making this again, and again, and again!

Excellent Lasagna recipe.  My daughter said it was the best lasagna yet.  It does make a lot so have a number of people ready to eat.  Make a quick Greek Salad and garlic bread - and your meal is made!  Took this to Whistler and everyone loved it.

This is the best lasagna I have ever made, but I changed a few things based on other reviews.  Used half beef half italian sausage, parsley instead of basil, brown sugar reduced to 1/2 tablespoon, used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, added one 8oz can of tomatoe sauce (a must!) only 1 egg and omitted the last teaspoon of salt.  Used a disposable lasagna pan and let set overnight in frige.  This is a lot to change but it came out perfect.  Made this for Christmas lunch with Caesar Salad Supreme and everyone loved it.  It was great to be able to just pop it in the oven Christmas morning and actually enjoy time with the family.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Oh my goodness!  The BEST lasagna I have ever made.  I don't think I will ever go back to slapping it together with a jar sauce again.  This was just too easy.  I used chopped Italian Style tomatoes, so there was a little extra garlic, pepper and onion flavor, but it only enhanced it, if that's possible.  I put it together one evening while kids were at wrestling practice.  Covered it with aluminum foil and put it away for the next night.  Left note for hubby to put in oven with foil for most of the cooking, as suggested, and then remove for last 15 minutes or so.  Letting it sit overnight is essential, and the sauce itself is to die for.  Its got to be the brown sugar!  When I make my own sauce I usually put in white sugar, but no more.  This is definitely a keeper. Thanks, Rosemary.

I made this recipe for my daughter's 2nd birthday party last weekend and everybody loved it(about 50 servings). This is a really good recipe and easy to make, just follow the instructions. I admit it, I'm not a good cooker, but with this recipe no one noticed. Don't be afraid to try!!!

This lasagna was absolutely excellent!  Sampled by both my friends and my husband, they said it was the best lasagna they had ever had!  It took about 1 and 1/2 hours in the oven, last 20 minutes or so was uncovered.  Really great lasagna, thanks for sharing!

As a non-Italian, this was my first attempt at lasagna.  Amazingly, it turned out great!  The receipe was simple and easy to follow.  The lasagna was moist and flavorful, but too goopy.  Best of all, my boyfriend loved it!  He said it was the best lasagna a Polish girl ever made!  (We're supposed to have the leftovers tonight, but I have a feeling there won't be any left when I get home!)

Great recipe.  I changed the ground meat to spicy Italian sausage to give it a kick.

Wonderful recipe!!!  It had a very nice presentation.....The best lasagna I have ever had....the only changes I made to it was...I add half a can of pasta sauce...since I like mine really saucey....and used all the meat sauce in the two layers and topped the last of the noodles with remaining sauce from the can....and then topped that with mozzarella cheese slices....bakes up bubbly and the cheese gets a little brown...YUM!

This recipe was a lot of work, but the end result was wonderful! My husband loved it. The only thing I would change for next time would be to use less brown sugar (it was too sweet for my taste) and add some red pepper flakes for some extra spice. :)

We LOVED this.  I used just 1T of the brown sugar, and it was just the right sweetness for me.  I used the no bake lasagna noodles, which were super easy.  My husband said it was the best lasagna he had ever eaten.

I came upon this recipe looking for basic lasagna that my picky 12yo would eat (no peppers, mushrooms, etc.)  This recipe was perfect not just for him, but my husband and father-in-law loved it.  I have never put sugar in my sauce for this dish, however I do believe the brown sugar adds a wonderful taste and perk for the tastebuds.  There is flexiblity with this recipe in the amount of spices one can add or omit.  For me and my crew - garlic, lots of garlic.  I did add a small can of tomato sauce to make it a little to stretch the sauce a bit.  I will reduce the sugar to 1 tbs. next time.  An easy, basic recipe - a nice change from my traditional recipe.  Thanks!  :)

Fantastic recipe!  I also made some modfications: half ground beef, half italian sausage.  Added one additional can diced tomatoes and one can tomato sauce and red pepper flakes.  Was delicious, especially the second day!  Makes a full 9 x 13 pan so next time will probably split and freeze one pan. Extra yummy!

Definitely add another can of tomato paste, or even just tomatoe sauce! This was my first foray and my boyfriend honestly said he couldn't imagine a better-tasting lasagna. We also made a vegetarian lasagna with this recipe, just without the meat!

This is one of the best lasagnas I ever tried! Very rich, tasty, great consistence. Incredible recipe!  Make sure to cook a lot, because it become much better the next day, thus you will have a lot of great leftovers! 
We love spicy food, so we added a little red hot pepper to ground beef.

I made this for my birthday dinner, and everyone loved it.  I used half beef and half Italian sausage, 4 cloves of garlic, and a little bit more fresh basil.  The lasagna is very solid and easy to cut.  My best friend gave me an AWESOME tip for making lasagna:  Instead of using shredded mozzarella, buy it sliced.  It was so easy to assemble!

Delicious lasagna, just like everyone says. Now, for my changes - the only two things I did differently was not refrigerate it overnight before baking and I added one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce to the simmering meat sauce to make it a little saucy. It seemed a little meaty and not very tomatoey to me so I added the extra tomato sauce and it made it perfect.

I made this recipe exactly as specified.  It was fabulous!  This recipe is a keeper, no modifications needed unless you have special diet needs.  Personally, I say don't eat this if you can't eat it the way it is.  When I had all the ingredients laid out seperately to assemble the lasagna, I thought there was not enough meat and too much ricotta, because I am not necessarily a fan of ricotta, but I soon became one after eating this lasagna.  This is one of those recipes you will have to keep handy because people will remember you for it.

LOVED this recipe! Of course, I changed it a little.  Instead of diced tomatoes, I used 2 large cans of whole tomatoes (with their juice), 4 large garlic cloves and dried basil.  I added extra parmesan and mozzarella.  Use fresh mozzarella and slice it - way better.  I also added 1/2 lb of sweet Italian sausage as my husband loves meat.  This wasn't dry at all and is wonderful reheated.

After reading the other reviews, I added 1/2 pound Italian sausage to 1 pound of ground beef.  I also used Kraft Shredded Parmesean, Asiago & Romano cheese in place of plain parmesean.  The house smelled wonderful. My husband took a bite and after swallowing, he said "Do NOT lose this recipe."  He went on to say that it was better than his father's lasagna that no one has ever beaten before.  The kids loved it as well.  Loved the fresh basil.  Thanks for sharing!!

A friend and I wanted to bake something hearty for a 10 people supper. We came across this recipe, did the shopping (much cheaper than we had thought) and prepared it together. It was very easy and didn't create too much of a fuss in the kitchen. We ended up only 6 people around the table, and there was no leftovers! I give it only 4 stars, because I do think it lacks a bit vegetables. Other than that, it was really great.

To prevent this from becoming too watery, I layered ot with the dry lasanga noodles right out of the box. I have always made my lasagnas this way. Less work too.

Delicious!  The whole family enjoyed.  I divided the mozzarella into 3 parts so there would be some left for the topping.  The lasagna was just a little dry.  I must have simmered my sauce too long and lost the moisture it needed.  I should have replaced the liquid that evaporated or added extra to it.  This was a sweet sauce, but for those who like a more robust flavor, try stirring in about 1/4 teaspoon (or just a small squirt) prepared mustard to your sauce at the end.  It will blend with the brown sugar and give the sauce a tangy kick.  I will make this again.  It was very good.

I used 1 lb. each of ground beef and italian sausage.  I left out any salt and thought if it needed it I could add salt later.  It ended up not needing it...maybe because of the spices in the sausage.  I used 12 noodles and added a can of tomato sauce as other reviewers recommended.  I made it the night before refrigerated it...I would recommend letting it sit on the counter an hour or so before putting it in the oven since it took almost an hour to heat through.  This tasted even better as reheated leftovers.  This recipe is a winner!

This is a great basic lasagna recipe. For once my lasagna doesn't come out too soupy. I do modify it a bit. I add lots of garlic, lots of onions, and I also add sliced muchrooms. Too the sauce I also add a can of tomato sauce, just to make more sauce. It's a wonderful recipe, but be sure to bake it in the oven for at least 15 minutes. It takes longer than half an hour, but just keep an eye on it as it's baking.

I tried this and it turned out pretty bad. You should not dry the noodles, because than they dry out fast and get hard. And if you try this recipe, use extra cheese. But i suggest you don't try this one!

I followed this recipe exactly.  Unfortunately, I have one major complaint that affected the tastiness of the dish.  OMIT THE EGGS when you do this recipe, otherwise your ricotta mixture will have a hard texture after you bake it...kinda like the consistancy of well-done scrambled eggs.  Yes, yes, I know it was supposed to help the cheese mixture from running all over the place, but I'd rather suffer the consequences of a runny lasagna than to have it taste the way it did.  I like my ricotta to taste creamy and rich.  Instead, the two eggs made it hard and lumpy.  Otherwise, the rest of the recipe is right on.  So omit the eggs and it would be a 5-star recipe.

Wonderful!!!!!  The first time I made it exactly like the recipe stated, and it was great!  Now I make it a bit healthier. I used ground turkey for the beef, fat free cottage cheese instead of riccota, whole wheat lasagna noodles, and reduced fat mozzarella, and it still tasted sinful!!!  I've made it for company,my family, you name it it's a winner every time.  This has replaced my old and become my new staple lasagna.  Thanks Rosemary!!!!!!

Very good, but it needed extra tomato sauce and it is so much better with some italian sausage added.  I made it the the night before and then baked it the next day.

The recipe is good, but not as good as others I have tried. I found that it turned out a bit dry and the taste was too sweet for our liking.

Made this last night for dinner.  Wonderful recipe.  I changed the tomato part like this: 1 Large can diced tomatoes with Garlic & Basil, 1- medium can tomato puree, 1 small can tomato paste.  I just realized this morning I only used 1 pound of hamburger, I forgot to use the 1/2 pound italian sausage (WHOOPS)...Oh well - it was still awesome!  It cut the best of any lasagna I have ever made.

I have used this recipe now for over a year, and it is SO wonderful. Everyone who has tried my lasagna LOVED IT! Thanks to the person who created this!

I noticed that some of you said the sauce was to chunky.  Try this.. USE CRUSHED TOMATOES vs Diced. That way its more of a puree! I did this from the get go, as I dont care for chunky!

I also add more cheese on top (a mixture of parmesan and mozzarrella)

I noticed many of you said it lacked flavor. I add crushed red pepper (the kind you put on pizza) and a little cayenne and season to taste. This gives it an extra ZING!

Well, I think it all has been said, but this dish definitely deserves five stars. As everyone has said, the ricotta mixture is not quite enough, so make sure to at least make 50% more. This was definitely the best lasagna I have ever had, and even though my boyfriend wont admit that its better than his mother's, I think he agrees with me.

I have made this dish for the last 2 years on Christmas Eve, and every year I get rave reviews!  This year some very close family friends, who happen to hail from Italy, were over for the dinner and they said it was marvelous!  I make the sauce 2 days in advance, and it is so yummy!  I do drain the tomatoes, and I actually use the no-boil noodles and cook for 50-60 minutes.  This dish is so versatile, it can be customized to any taste!  There were only 3 pieces left, out of 18 slices, and that was with 8 people for dinner, along with other main dishes.  It was definitely the main attraction!  YUM!

This is one of the good lasagna I've ever tried... however, I would suggested that adding 1/2 cup red wine when cooking the beef. It gives a rich taste of the meat mixture! Also, put some cubed butter on top before baking gives a better appearence and smell...

I love Lasagna, and this was the best I've had. I did leave out the salt though, Parmesan cheese is salty enough. I increased the garlic, and added 1 t. of Worcestershire to the sauce. And mushrooms. This is the first Lasagna I ever made that actually held while I took it out of the pan. So glad I tried it. Although next time I think I will go with the suggestions, and add 1 can tomato sauce. It was just a tad dry.

This recipe was EXCEPTIONAL! I made it for my mother for mother's day quite a few months ago, and it's her favorite food, saying it was just as good as any lasagna she gets in a resturant(which she loves!) definitly 5 stars :-)

I made this last night, and for the first time i ever made lasagna, i feel it came out really good. I would definitely make this again.  I added an extra can of tomato sauce as some other readers used and that was perfect, i was glad that i did.  Also as some other readers, i divided up the meat and used half ground beef and half hot italian sausage.  It gave it an extra flavor.  I also added a  few extra cloves of garlic and diced up some jalapeno peppers in with the meat because we like those flavors.  If you like a lot of cheese in your lasagna, you might want to increase that a little.  All in all, I was very pleased with the recipe.  Thanks Rosemary!

Lasagne had good texture but lacked flavor in my opinion.  I think next time I would add an additional 28 oz can of tomatoes as well as 1 or 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes to the red sauce to make it more interesting.

I made this for a dinner party and it was superb!  Everyone loved the taste and it was very easy to prepare.  I used the no bake noodles to cut back on my time.  You have to put sauce on the bottom of the pan for it to work properly.  This recipe is a keeper!

I thought this lasagna was very average. I have made much better. It had a very strong meat taste and was really dry, especially on the top layer. I also thought it could have used less ricotta cheese and more mozzarella. It also seemed like it took a very long time to prepare and was expensive to make. But it did do the trick, and was served at a family gathering with compliments, it was just was not great to me.

YUMMY! This is a very good lasagne dish. Easy to make and the flavors are just right. I used the Barilla oven-ready noodles so I had to adjust the amount of sauce needed. Instead of "1 (29oz) can of diced tomatoes, I used 2 (28oz) cans of crushed tomatoes without altering any other ingredients. Did I mention we like our lasagne saucy? Thanks Rosemary, this has become a regular.

This is the best lasagna ever. I've made this recipe twice now and everytime we eat it my boyfriend gets so excited. Probably because he gets leftovers for a few days. I do cut the sugar to 2t, add a can of tomato sauce, and the salt down to 1/2t. Fresh basil is a must guys. I now use this for spagetti sauce as well. Great recipe, thanks.

Very yummy.  I'd make this again in a hearbeat.  Took an hour start to finish to get it in the oven.  I used 1/2 lb hot Italian sausage with the burger and used no-boil noodles.  I also added 1/2 cup (more or less) of dry red wine to the sauce.

I made this for my guest for the Sunday football game and every one said it was delicious.  Although, I thought it was good, nothing spectacular.  I would make it again, only I would add a little more spices to it to liven it up.  Also, I would recommend having some extra sauce on the side since it seams to be a tad on the dry side.

I normally make pretty tasteless lasagna, and decided to try this recipe out.  I pre-made it the night before, using no-boil noodles (my first time using them).  My in-laws dropped by for dinner unexpectedly, and I had a beautiful, delicious lasagna that my mother-in-law told me was better than hers! Success! Many thanks Rosemary!!

I have never made Lasagna.  I don't cook much at all.  I was having my parents over for dinner and my husband always cooks.  So I decided I wanted to get brave and said I was making Lasagna.  This was awesome.  My mom makes good Lasagna but she even said this was better.  The sweetness from the brown sugar takes away the acid taste of all the tomatoes.  We will be having this again.  It was perfect, everyone loved it.  Thanks for making my dinner a success.  My mom took a copy of the recipe and my husband made me print it out so it could not get lost:)

Wow!  This was good.  It is a lot of work to put together, but it is worth it.  In fact, I make two when I make this and freeze one.  That way, I can have lasagna later on in the month by just popping it in the oven!

Outstanding and delicious! I've made it half a dozen times and each time it tastes better and better - I find using the "garlic and basil" diced tomatoes gives this recipe an extra added flavor...my husband swears I have outdone myself using the extra "zing" in these cans of tomatoes.

Like everyone else, I made some changes to this recipe. I Used a 29 oz. can of chopped tomatoes to avoid the chunks. I used 1 lb. of hamburg and 3 sweet italian sausages, casings removed and crumbled. I added some black pepper and chili powder to offset the sweetness. I also used regular curly noodles, but didn't cook them; it worked fine. I was amazed at how neat this lasagna was. It stayed together perfectly and cut like a cake! I would definitely make this again.

This is a delicious lasagna...even better than mom's!  I've added 3/4lb of chopped mushrooms to the sauce, and switched one of the cans of plain tomato paste for one with Italian seasonings, and it makes it even better!  This is definitely a keeper!

This was a great tasting lasagna.  My only complaint was that it didn't seem cheesy enough -- some lasagna's are just dripping with cheese.  Other than that, YUM!

Delicious it was completely gone in two days! Instead of adding basil and diced tomatoes I used the lasagna ready sauce at the store and still added brown sugar but only cooked the sauce with the beef for ten minutes! It was perfect! Thanks

Love this recipe... 1 thing I added 1 lb. of sweet Italian sausage and I added 1 Jar of Classico fire roasted tomato & basil pasta sauce. Came out delicious. Cooked it for a hour and 15. And 5 min. Uncovered.

I have been making this almost identical recipe for the past 45 years - came to by in-laws and called "buffet lasagnia"  the only difference in this recipe and mine is the ricotta vs mine of cottage cheese 1% I skip the eggs as see no reason for them in this recipe - Still a great recipe - perhaps I will try mine with the Ricotta instead of the cottage cheese - just to see if it changes it or not.  I have prepared this recipe in triple batches when holding my annual re-unions.  Do everything but the baking in the oven.  I wrap the dishes in several layers of aluminum foil and freeze.  On re-union day - I put them in the oven to bake staggered by 20 minutes each which gives a continuing fresh - hot from the oven lasagnia for all 3 - my family loves it and never seems to leave left-overs - served with several large salads - fresh cut sliced beefstake tomatoes - lots of garlic bread and Bob's your uncle.

Made this three separate times. It was amazing each time and my friends have enjoyed it.  I could see this recipe being dry only if you drain the diced tomatoes before simmering the meat and spice mixture.  No complaints.

This is a keeper! I cheated though and used 2 jars of Ragu Spaghetti Sauce rather than using the 8 ingredients listed in the recipe, and simmered that with 3 bay leaves and garlic powder with the drained, cooked ground beef for about 40 minutes. 9 lasagna noodles worked out great, and we baked it for 40 minutes covered (put parchment paper between the aluminum foil and the lasagne to protect the top of the lasagne from strange black foil stuff) and then uncovered for 40 minutes longer, and it was perfect.  I also added frozen shredded spinach to the Ricotta. Its a great meal to have and to share!

I love trying new recipes, and my husband has a 5 star rating system to let me know which recipes to make again since I hardly make the same recipes twice.  He said this is a 5 star recipe! we all loved it. we used tortillas instead of noodles.

I've made this both with the sauce as directed (omitting the brown sugar), which turned out great and my own sauce (which I like better).  For those who commented on the cook time at the top, it includes the time needed to make the sauce.  I usually cook it covered for 35-40 min, add mozzarella and Parmesan and cook uncovered for an additional 10 or so min.

I would increase the proportions of the cheese filling by about 50% for the ricotta mix. The amount of sauce and mozzarella is fine.

Sauce could have had a little more zing, and the recipe didn't call for pepper. Otherwise, it was quite enjoyable. 3 1/2 out of 5.

I also added mushrooms & a cup of water to the sauce ~ I really loved the fresh basil opposed to the dried.  I also used the Italian seasoned turkey ~ delicious!  Maybe more cheese next time (Parmesan & mozz)  I also used the skim & lowfat options and it still tasted better then any other lasagna I have had =)

This is a pretty good recipe to follow and guide yourself by, but I always end up adding a bit more or less of some of the ingredients. Once you've made this recipe, you can try to add more spices to your liking.

I have made way too many salty lasagnas so decided to tweak this recipe quite a bit.  Only 1t salt in the sauce, only 1/2t salt in the cheese mix.  Was perfect.  Also detest ricotta cheese so for the first time, substituted cottage for the ricotta.  Hit the spot.  Also, did not need 1.5 lbs beef.  Used just a pound, and it was great.  Lastly, substituted Beecher's Flagship cheese for the parmesan.  Was so happy with how this turned out that I am giving it 5 stars, with my modifications!

This is a fantastic lasagne, I have made it many times and I don't ever want to make another recipe! I put more vegetables in the sauce to make it stretch it little further (extra bell pepper, grated carrot) and whatever herbs and spices I have around. Last time it was fresh Italian parsley which was great. I find the mozzarella on top a little plastic-y (maybe it's the brand I buy!) so I tend to use cheddar or a mix.

This lasagna was easy and amazing! Love the ricotta cheese. And I like more sauce, so adding an extra can of diced tomatoes was perfect. This is the only lasagna recipe I'll make from now on. My family loved it!!!

amazing! add 1/2 c of red and include half sweet sausage half lean beef. let set over night. Also, if you love garlic like myself, get the canned items that include garlic. If yours comes out bad....bad cook, not bad recipe...

I cannot believe I hadn't reviewed this recipe before.  It is truly delicious and freezes so well in individual servings for those nights you don't want to cook.  It may even be better after freezing!  Anyway.. I do it exactly like this except I use fat-free cottage cheese whirred in the food processor for the ricotta, otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly.  It's really very very good.

YUM!  I did like others and added some of my own components- like spinach mixed with the ricotta, and extra garlic and more sauce.  Overall this recipe is delicious and my family and friends always enjoy it.  Well worth all the work

Great lasagna! I read everyone's reviews, so I used half spicy italian sausage, made more sauce than it calls for, and covered it for the first half of cook time. turned out great! the only problem I ran into was the extra sauce made me run out out of room in my 13x9 pan! the lasagna was heaping out of the pan, but it was good none the less. I kept it in the fridge overnight, and then actually baked it in the morning for an hour, so that the bake time wouldn't be as long when I got home from work. Just had to make sure it was heated through the middle!

Great recipe.  Easy directions and wonderful to freeze and eat later if you arent cooking for an entire family.  Substituted ground beef for ground turkey for a healthy alternative and you couldnt tell the difference.  Would make it again in a heartbeat.

The sauce was great.  I made two lasagnas and froze one.  This is very time-consuming, but it is worth it.  I only used 2 pounds of ground beef and it was more than enough to make two pans worth.  I also only used 1 1/4 pounds of mozzarella for both pans.

WOW, WOW, WOW! I made this with my friends (we made a night out of making lasagna) and it was FANTASTIC! The flavors are just... GAH~ delicious! We couldn't even eat it fast enough! Only changes I made were the following:  --instead of diced tomatoes, i used tomato sauce and i thought it was better  --used less that 1lb of ground beef and then added 5 sweet italian sausages (best decision of my life)  --Used a little more ricotta cheese than recommended.  Besides that, just follow the recipe down to the letter and you have a FANTASTIC meal. PLEASE TRY, ITS WORTH IT!

Since we didn't have any ricotta cheese on hand we substituted it with cottage cheese and it was absolutely delicious!  My fiance couldn't get enough of it.  Let's just say there was no leftovers!

Awesome basic lasagna recipe--very easy to customize. I often add fresh mushrooms (8 oz.) to the beef while browning. This adds some extra moisture which is the only problem with the recipe. I always add an extra can (15 oz.) of tomato sauce which helps make it juicier, especially the leftovers which are awesome!

Sounds good, but I really was expecting some new kind of Lasagna.  The only thing American about this was perhaps the ground beef?

This is a great base recipe, I did change some things around regarding to the suggestions from other reviewers, but otherwise it rocked. I added 3 cups spinach leaves to the sauce, and only simmered for 10min.  to the Ricotta mixture I only added one egg. I also made this gluten-free, by using non-bake rice lasagna, and cooked it for 1 hour, and it turned out great.

Wow! What a great recipe! I took the advice of another reviewer and added another 14oz can of diced tomatoes and upped the other ingredients as well. It came out very tasty and not dry at all (which was always a problem). Will definitly keep in the recipe box!

I have made this lasagna 3 times and love it.  I had to make a few changes...I did half beef and half italian sausage.  I also added cottage cheese to my lasagna and removed from the other cheeses.  I added a little more sauce than what it calls for.  Excellent Recipe

This was my first time making a Lasagna:) I sortof messed up on the noodles but It was a good mistake. I boiled some water than put the noodles in the 13by9 dish and poured the water over it and let it sit for 25 mins. Well The curly part on the edges fell off and the pasta was most of the way done but I liked it this way bec that's usually what I dont like about lasagna. The hard Crispy edges. The meat mixture I used real tomatoes instead of canned, added parm and sadly didnt have tomato paste which would of made sauce alot better:( but added 16oz can of Hunts garlic and herb sauce. The ricotta mix, just added one more egg. Also Keep some sauce aside without meat for the bottom and top. I layered mine noodles, meat sauce, ricotta, mozz cheese. Really fantastic recipe!!

I'm kind of a failure when it comes to making lasagna, but even I couldn't mess this up!  I followed the recipe verbatim except I doubled the oregano, basil, and garlic.  Next time, I will double the ricotta cheese mixture because we didn't feel like it was enough.  Served with garlic cheese breadsticks from this website.

I'm not sure that it's fair of me to rate this, since I ended up changing it so much, but I will, and then say what I changed.  First of all, I doubled the recipe to make 2 lasagnas.  I also used a combination of ground beef and plain sausage.  When I went to put in the diced tomatoes, I realized that the one large can that I had was actually crushed tomatoes with italian seasonings so I just threw it in...then I added a small can of diced tomatoes with italian seasonings.  And I did add one large can of plain diced tomatoes and the 2 cans per lasagna of paste.  I used fresh parsley instead of dried and just soaked the noodles in water for a while.  I topped it with both mozzarella and parmesan cheese and I cooked it for about an hour.

It was really really good!

A good lasagna (by my standards) can be hard to find.  This one worked for me better than any I have tried, which is why it gets the five stars.  I didn't really change anything - made more sauce, used more garlic and oregano, dried basil instead of fresh, but that's about it.  (I froze the leftover sauce for a smaller lasagna in the future.)  I made the same cheese mix quantity - though I sprinkled the top with mozzarella instead of parm (I think too much parm makes lasagna a bit bitter - and I love parm!).  I liked this mix, because ricotta alone can be a pain to spread - the eggs made it much more creamy/spreadable.  Some folks recommend using less beef.  I think it depends upon how meaty you like your lasagna.  I used a whole pound because I wanted to get rid of it before it went bad, then I added approx. a half pound of mild Italian sausage.  I don't remember thinking this was too much meat when I ate it.  Next time, I'll try only sausage, and probably use hot rather than mild Italian.

I have made this many times in the past year.... I love it! Actually I made 2 extra and put them in the deep freezer... It is really good the next day.. Took another reviewers advise and did not cook the noodles, just soaked them in hot water for 15 minutes and let them finish cooking in the oven!!! My favorite Lasagna... ***I have cheated a few times and just "doctored" up some store bought Kroger brand traditional canned sauce... It was good, but if time permits I prefer to follow this recipe from start to finish!!!

This is my go-to recipe whenever anyone is coming over because it always tastes FABULOUS and can feed the tribe. I usually make it with turkey to make it a little healthier, and use cottage cheese instead of Ricotta. Make sure to get stewed tomates that are marinating in basil and oregano for an extra kick of flavor.

This was awesome!  I can't believe I made it!  The only changes I made was doubling the garlic and adding more sauce.  Based on previous reviews, I also added sauce to the bottom of the pan which I think helped.  My husband scarfed it down and was asking for seconds before I could even ask if he liked it.  I can't wait to have the leftovers!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I made it the night before and I wanted to eat the sauce with a spoon, it smelled and tasted so good!  I used lean ground turkey and some cheese and garlic flavored Italian sausage for the meat.  I think next time I will make more sauce, or use only two layers of noodles instead of three.  We like our lasagna saucy.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I have been making this recipe for about 6 years now.  I always double the diced tomatoes, & add a full 2 pounds of ground beef b/c we like our lasagna nice & meaty.  Wonderful recipe, and a favorite in our home.

The best lasagna recipe! Layer sauce on the bottom of the baking dish first and use oven ready noodles if your in a time crunch. Next time, I will try this with whole wheat noodles for extra nutrition. I also used one full container of cottage cheese in place of the ricotta.

This is an excellent recipe. All of my family liked it. It is a "make again" recipe. I used fresh garden tomatoes instead of canned ones. Great as is!

I used this recipe as a guideline. I used 1 1/2 cups of parmesan cheese. I like a cheesy lasagna. It turned out great and even held together a lot better than some lasagnas I've had. I also added frozen spinach to the cheese mixture and it was delicious. A very versatile recipe that can accommodate most vegetables you might want to add.

Very good recipe! I did alter it just a little bit. I used Italian sausage because my family likes it better than ground beef in their lasagna. I added lots more garlic, and some Italian seasoning to the meat. I also added some sphagetti sauce to the mix because I did not think the tomato and paste mix was creamy enough. I also took the advice of some other reviewers and covered the bottom of my pan with a thin layer of spaghetti sauce so the noodles would not get hard. I also baked covered for about 45 minutes and uncovered for 25 minutes. This was a simple and delicious recipe! Thanks so much!!!

This was my first time making lasagna, and this is a great starter recipe.  I did add an extra 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, as my boyfriend likes his lasagna on the "saucy" side.  I also doubled the garlic and used a huge onion. Next time I will add even more garlic and experiment a little with different spices to get exactly the flavor I am looking for.  All in all, very easy and and an easy recipe to modify to suit your tastes.

This recipe was just wow. I did change it up a bit by adding some spices like nutmeg (1/4 tsp), cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp) and italian seasoning (1 tsp). Before browning the beef, I seasoned it with salt, pepper and a little bit of sugar. Also instead of diced tomatoes, I just added tomate sauce and 1/2 cup of pasta water into the sauce. For the cheese, just to make it healthier, I used cottage cheese to reduce the fat content.  This will now be my lasagna recipe from now on! Just delicious.

This recipe is very good, ofcourse I add my own touches here and there, I always add fresh mushrooms to my sauce that I cook in a white wine, I roasted roma tomatoes and garlic with a drizzle of evoo for my sauce (much better than can tomatoes, I used fresh basil from my garden I am proud to say (cheaper than buying and easy to grow). I used a sweet italian sausage and ground beef, I never add a egg to my ricotta mixture just a italian cheese blend and fresh parsley. I layer mine this recipes way and sometimes I change it up by putting my sauce down first then my no boil noodles my ricotta cheese mixture, another layer of noodles, then the meat mixture thats the sausage and beef browned with basil, italian seasonings, on top of that I laddle my red sauce and provolone and mozz cheese, another layer of noodles then then I top with a six cheese italian blend a laddle of red sauce and also a couple of laddles of a white sauce, that consist of butter, flour, chicken bullion and half and half wiith a 1/4 cup of parma cheese. WOW !!!, a little work but well worth it This is the bomb!! doing it the recipes way or with little changes.

Excellent! The best I've ever made.  Of course being from Louisiana, I added a little more of each seasoning along with a little cayenne and Tony's seasoning to the meat mixture and some Tony's and cayanne to the cheese mixture.  I drained the can of diced tomatoes but shouldn't have done that.  I will use this recipe again and again!  Thank you.

I used this recipe to make lasagna for the first time and it turned out GREAT!! I adjusted the cooking time according to what I read in other reviews (20 minutes uncovered then 1 hour covered) I used 1 pound of ground beef instead of the 1 1/2 lbs it calls for and added an extra 2 cups of shredded cheese (Kraft 5 Cheese Italian Blend) to make it extra cheesy. I also added two layers of fresh spinach for extra color and flavor. I followed two suggestions from other reviewers- putting pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan to keep the noodles from drying out and spraying the foil with cooking spray to prevent the cheese on top from sticking- which worked out well. I will definitely be using this recipe again! Next time I make it I may try hot ground sausage instead of beef or a mixure of the two!

The top dried out cause the sausce was exposed, so I would suggest you save enough mozzarella for the very top layer.

My family devoured this lasagna.  I did add a 15 oz can of tomato sauce to make sure I had plenty of sauce, increasing the spices to 2 tsp each dried basil and oregano.  Also, I was running low on parmesan, I only had enough for the top, so I used about a cup of shredded colby/jack in the ricotta filling.

This recipe is great. I often make this lasagna and every time is so delicious. I follow the recipe exactly except that I use ham instead of ground beef. I also add some black olives and pickles to the tomato sauce 5 minutes before it is ready.

This was SO good!!!  With the exception of adding a bit more garlic and fresh basil due to using 2lbs of ground beef, I followed the recipe.  It turned out perfectly!

Sauce on this is really delicious.  I am making the sauce alone tonight to serve over rotini.  When making the lasagna, I would double (or triple) the sauce.  I ran a little short between the layers, and any leftover sauce can be frozen.  The ricotta was also very good with all the parmesan cheese blended in.  Thanks!

I think that it's hard to find a lasagna recipe everyone loves . . . because everyone seems to like different ratios of meat, cheese and sauce.  This recipe seems to be the answer!  It has the perfect amount of cheese, meat and sauce.  I think that next time I'll do half lean meat and half italian sausage, but it was fantastic as is.

This is an excellent lasagna recipe. I used 1 pound of gound beef and 1 pound of Bob Evan Zesty Sausage. Also added some chopped black olives and crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce. My husband loves it! Thanks for the recipe.

FANTASTIC! I made this a few nights ago and just finished the left overs today-- and my husband doesn't normally eat left overs! He said it was even better this time and all I did was heat it in the microwave! I had planned to make the meat sauce the night before and let it sit in the fridge until the next day like other reviewer's had suggested, but it smelled & tasted so good (had to taste test the sauce of course!) I decided to make it that night-- SO FLAVORFUL! A few changes I made: I halfed the recipe (since it's just the two of us) and made the lasagna in my 2.5 qt. corningware dish; I added half a jar of Rinaldi's "Olive Oil & Garlic" spaghetti sauce since we like our lasagna saucier (the original recipe is very meaty)-- it looked like SO much meat mixture, especially after I added more sauce, but I actually ran out before the final layer so I spread some more spaghetti sauce on the top layer plus the mozarella and parmesan cheeses. I even accidentally used too much salt (forgot to 1/2 it) and it still turned out fantastic! I think the added spaghetti sauce contributed to how flavorful ours turned out (other reviewers have commented that this is a bland recipe) but it's also important to use FRESH basil. This is a keeper!

OH MY GOODNESS, THIS IS WONDERFUL!!!! Me and My husband just live it. It was my first time I made lasagna and it was wonderful. I had put in an extra clove of garlic in and also about half a cup more of tomato sauce.Also when doing the layer of the lasagna I had put some mozzarella cheese on top with the parmesan. I had made the meat sauce the day before. So all the flavors could combine together and it would save me time the next day. Since it was only me and my husband eating the lasagna so I had the ingredients adjusted to 4 servings. I cooked the lasagna covered for 55 min. and 15 min. uncovered. Turned out beautiful.

I made this for the first time and although it was very tasty, I think it could definitely have been a bit 'saucier' even though I did add a bit of water during simmering. However, my husband and his friend enjoyed it so at the end of the day that's what counts!

Honestly, I didn't think it had the greatest flavor.  Maybe if i let it sit for 24 hours like some other reviewers suggested.
My husband absolutely loved it though.  I'm sure I'll make it again.

OUTSTANDING! While I'm not one to measure specific ingredients, I don't change a thing in this recipe. Make it the night before for even better results. The flavors blend together beautifully! This is the one and only lasagna recipe I'll ever use. Thanks so much for sharing this!

The flavor of this recipe was fantastic, however it was a little drier than I like my lasagna.  Next time I will only use 9 lasagna noodles and some of the water from the pasta in the sauce as recommended by others.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be trying this again.

I made this for my mother's birthday. This lasagna was very, very good. I used 3/4 turkey meat and 3/4 italian sausage. The sauce was very good, didn't change a thing. I made the sauce early in the day and let it slow cook on the stove for about 3 1/2 hours. I also mixed up the ricotta mixture early, so the flavors would infuse and set in. My father could not stay out of the sauce, so I was a bit short when it came time to put it together. It is not my Aunt Patsy's recipe, but it was awfully tasty. Definetley use the fresh basil, it makes the sauce wonderful! I would definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as written, as I usually do when trying a recipe for the first time.  It was fair at best.  The sauce is skimpy, too sweet and, in general, just not flavorful enough.  If you do make this, definitely take the other reviewers' advice to add more sauce and spices.  Better yet, look for a better recipe.  I felt I wasted good groceries.

Looking at the number of reviews, I was very excited to make this recipe.  I was a little disappointed because the Lasagna came out very dry.  I had to use a jar of spaghetti sauce to top on each piece.  I'm very surprised most reviews gave this recipe 5 stars when they actually made changes to this recipe by adding or deleting ingredients.

This recipe is what one of my girlfriends would call a "Mary Poppins": Practically perfect in every way! 


I make this in a slightly smaller pan (11x7") to make a slightly taller lasagna (use only 9 cooked noodles if you do the same), but beyond that, my advice is this: Don't make any changes to the ingredients themselves -- they make one heck of a lasagna!

This was a really good one. I added an extra can of diced tomatos with green chilies. It was enough to feed a small army. Will be having this again tomorrow night, with my mother. Served with rosemary bread. Hubby said he gave it a 4 because italian is not his favorite, but he really enjoyed it. Would be good to make a day ahead. This one took me a while after work. I started at 5:45 and we ate at 7:30(had to cook bread also), but that is OK because we do not have children. I will be making this again.

This was delicious!  To make it vegetarian, I substituted Morningstar Farms veggie ground beef for the real thing and it came out great.

Yum! I was apprehensive about using so much tomato paste in the sauce, since I never used it, but it turned out really well! I also used a big can of sauce. My market didn't have fresh basil so I just used dry italian seasoning and it worked out just fine. I split this into two pans and used more noodles to compensate. This froze beautifully, it was a hit at our rose bowl party!

Very good; too sweet for my tastes, but this is a personal preference that is easily adjusted.  Next time, would probably cut sugar in half.

This is the best lasagna recipe we've ever had. My husband loves taking charge on this one, and we usually double the recipe to make two: one for now and one for the freezer. We've made it for friends, taken it on sailing trips, and served it to family. Even my father-in-law raved this recipe and he usually finds something wrong with every restaurant he goes to!

I made this a day ahead and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  I was cooking for a large family Christmas Eve gathering, so I doubled the recipe, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was such a hit, I had to give the recipe to several family members!  Served with a salad and garlic bread, nothing else was needed to be the perfect dinner.  This is so easy to make, and the results are fantastic!  Thanks for a great addition to my cooking lineup!

The best Lasagna Recipe!
 I did blend the tomatoes lightly to reduce in size. I recommend cutting the salt ingredients by ½ to 1/3.

I used 1 lb of ground sausage instead of beef and upped the diced tomatos to 40 oz.  I also added cream cheese to the rigotta mix.
I baked for 1 1/2 hour.  

It is so much better as left overs! I will prepare this one day in advance next time.
Great recipe!

4 out of 5 stars. Good thing I read the reviews for important advice before cooking it!

After reading all of the reviews, I thought for sure this would be an outstanding recipe.  It was a great deal of work for just an okay lasagna.  I made this for a big family party and I was very disappointed.  Very over rated.

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made it a dozen times.  I make it everytime someone has a baby and take it to them uncooked so they can eat it fresh from the oven.  I added a grated carrot, grated zucchini and finely diced mushrooms to get a few more veggies.  It is the best ane easiest lasagna I have ever made.  Any my 100% Italian husband loves it!!

Thanks Rosemary and reviewers, my church family loved this recipe.  Made some modifications, however.  I seasoned the bland hamburger.  Decreased the brown sugar and complimented it with a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Because all I had was oven ready lasagna noodles, had to add half a jar of spaghetti sauce.  My parmesan was salty so I didn't add salt to the cheese mixture.  And I covered the lasagna with foil till the noodles were soft, then uncovered it and added the parmesan on top.

I thought this was the most delicious lasagna I've ever had.  I think the brown sugar makes all the difference in the world.  The only change I made to the recipe was using ground turkey instead of beef.  Next time I may use Italian sausage.

I really liked the way the sauce tasted with the brown sugar. I had always put white sugar in my lasagna but the brown sugar tastes much richer. I will never go back to the white.

Really good stuff! I used 1 lb. beef and a half lb. of hot italian sausage which gave it a nice kick. I cheated and used no boil noodles...and 2 big jars of good quality marinara sauce, the fresh herbs and left out the sugar. Plenty of sauce, makes a HUGE pan of lasagne...thanks Rosemary!

This recipe was okay.  We have a ton of leftovers and unfortunately, I'm not sure if they'll all be eaten.  This seemed to take a long time to make, and I don't really like to take a lot of time on a dish unless I know its going to be good.

Wow, this was good. It really made a huge 9x13 pan, had to place a cookie sheet under it as it would drip over. I added the extra 12oz of diced tomatoes and think it is a definate must. I think I would also like to add mushrooms next time. This is a keeper.

If you don't eat red meat, try this with ground turkey.  Fantastic!

I thought this was excellent.  I made this for the family and will definately make it again.  I like dry lasagna better than lasagna that's too watery.  So this recipe was perfect for me.  I made some extra sauce to be served on teh side so that people who like more sauce can pour on more as needed.  Great recipe!

I love this recipe!!  I added the 12 oz. of jar sphagetti sauce like other mentioned and left out the salt.  It was awesome.  The best I have ever made.  I was actually looking forward to leftovers!  Thank you so much.

I don't mean to be the odd vote here, but I just thought this recipe was okay.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception that I added an extra 14 oz. can of tomatoes that several people suggested, but it still came out pretty dry.  I've been cooking many years and was just trying something new, but I think I will stick with my old recipe.  Thanks anyways

I found this recipe 5 years ago and been making it ever since.  I LOVE THIS....I did modify this by adding some hot sausage as well as ground beef and I use just a little more ricotta to make this cheesier.  Oh and I almost forgot I use Taco cheese instead of mozzarella..ETHELMERTZ you are the man...

i substituted some of the mozzarella with cheddar as my local supermarket had run out of all but one little pack. it was really nice. not too cheesy but a great flavour and when cold it holds together perfectly for those of us who love cold lasagne!! (probably only me but it reminds me of those hungover days back in university!)

I have tried several, and this is the best for me.  I'm not one to put a lot of time into my meals, so I usually use sauce out of a jar, but this had so much more flavor.  Unbeatable!!

This is a great recipe - the only lasagna recipe I will be using from now on. I took the suggestions of some other rewiewers: used 3/4 lb. ground beef, 1/4 lb. sweet Italian sausage, increased the amount of garlic, added a dash of crushed red pepper flakes, cut brown sugar in half, added a 14 oz. can of tomato sauce and 1/4 c. red wine. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Based on other reviews I was worried that I wouldn’t have enough sauce so I made a double recipe and ended up with a ton left over (will be great for pasta though) and the lasagna wasn’t dry at all. I sprayed my baking dish with Pam and added a thin layer of sauce to the bottom before layering the noodles. This was plenty to feed 7 people, with some leftovers.

The sweet and the savory didn't really mix together.  It was good but not great.  I would take out to brown sugar next time.

I personally did not care for this, mostly because I am used to my mother's recipe.  However, everyone else loved it, so I'm going to be fair.  I personally thought it needed more sauce, so I doubled everything but the meat because it was very meaty.  I also sprinkled more parmesean on top, because 2 tbs didn't cut it.  Contrary to what others said, it did not come out dry, the ricotta mix was good and really makes it original, and it looked very appealing!

This was very good. I used no-boil lasagna pasta (they have it in the cheese section at Trader Joes) so I saved some time there. Also make sure to save enough of the sauce mixture for the very top, otherwise the pasta will dry out when you bake. This is a very good recipe!

Very good lasagna.  I also might stick with my other recipe for lasagna which has homemade red sauce.  (That sauce is hard to beat.)  
What I would do different would be to layer the bottom of the pan with some sauce first before laying the first layer of noodes in the pan.  Also sprayed bottom of pan with Pam.  I think that I laid the ricotta on too heavy is spots. Would do that different to make the "right mix" of layering the ricotta with sauce.  Would use petite diced tomatoes next time.  
This recipe stood up very well when cut, which allowed you to see the layers.  I may have laid the ricotta too heavy, but am still rating four stars - because of the taste was a little bit different than what I am used to on homemade secret family recipe sauce.  I still believe in searching for something better!!

Delicious!  I only used half of the mozzarella (a pound of cheese??) and 9 noodles, and substituted ground turkey for beef.  I cooked it too long and burned it slightly, but I can tell that a properly baked version of this recipe would be outstanding.

This is really good.  I've made it several times; sometimes with spinach & mushrooms (without meat), sometimes with different cheeses.  It always turns out great.  Oh, and I always put shredded mozzerella on top.  I didn't give it five stars only because I think its a tad too salty as per recipe.  Otherwise wonderful.

I am usually a very good cook, and i followed this recipe to the letter and went to quite alot of expense buying all the ingredients. I was extremely dissapointed with the result - the lasanga did not resemble any of its kind i have ever eaten. It was dry, with no sauciness, and bland. The noodles were hard, and it just didn't meld together like a lasanga should. It sounds like it should work, from the list of ingredients, but It was alot of effort and an embarrasment to me infront of my guests.

This was my first time making lasagna, and although it was very time consuming, it was very easy. The recipe was great, although I tweeked it just a bit. I used 2 lbs of ground turkey (instead of ground beef), a 26 oz jar of marinara (instead of the tomato sauce)and 4 fresh chopped tomatos (instead of the canned tomatos). I also used the oven ready noodles and added some spinach to the cheese. It turned out great and very filling. Next time I think I'll add some mushrooms, green peppers, more spinach, and more meat sauce. I'll also use more noodles than I did this time. Overall we were very pleased. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first lasagna I have made and I think it is the only one I will make in the future.  It had really good flavor, since I made it Saturday morning and didn't cook it till Sunday night.  I used one lb of hamburg, 3 (6 oz.) cans of tomato paste and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I had just enough sauce for the top.  It took a while to cook, but it is well worth it.

I was expecting this to be out of this world from all the rave reviews, which it wasn't, but still good enough.  I did follow others past reviews and added an extra can of diced tomatoes and doubled up on the seasonings.  However, DO NOT add the sugar.  I think that's why it tasted "funky".  Even people who ate it could taste it. With all the prep and wait, I was expecting something more.  I actually prefer Bob's Awesome Lasagna on this site to this one, which is far easier and much tastier. Won't be making again.

I make this recipe once or twice a month (my only alteration is to halve the brown sugar), and I've never had anyone not like it. I love it for guests because I can make a tray (or two) the day before -- it's a fantastic time saver.

Great recipe, although I did make some changes based on previous reviews.  

I used only 1 lb of beef (and it was still plenty meaty), 4 cloves of garlic, 1 Tbl brown sugar, and cut the salt in the sauce in half because I added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  Used only one egg in the cheese mixture and it still held together well.  I used Barilla "no boil" lasagna noodles and they turned out soft, but their flavor was a little funny so that I think I will just use regular noodles in the future.  

This recipe is a keeper, thanks for sharing!

It's the first time I tried my hand at baking pasta and I took this recipe coz it was well rated. True enough, the result was both delicious and encouraging. I will surely go on baking this recipe. My husband loved it too. Next time, i'll try to lessen the egg to just one so the ricotta will feel a bit soft and also as others suggested i'll add more tomato sauce. It's a great recipe, thank you for sharing.

Simply the BEST!  I agree that it takes some time to assemble but is nice to be able to create such a filling and delightful meal and pop it in the oven the next night for supper.  I had to bake this for 1.5 hours for it to get thoroughly hot.  Make sure to add a very light layer of meatsauce on the bottom of the pan then follow the recipe as listed.  If you don't do this, you'll have some really burned crispy noodles on the bottom.  Thankfully, my family enjoyed the burned noodles...strange.  Awesome recipe!

Very good recipe. I tried it with ground beef, then with italian sausage, and highly recommend using sausage. The brown sugar adds a little 'something' to the sauce. This is a keeper.

family loved this lasagna.  Kids even ate it and they are picky.  I used oven ready noodles and won't do that again as the bottom layer turned out hard, other than that great recipe.

This lasagna is very traditional, but the addition of the brown sugar, has your guests wondering, "Hmm what makes this so good?"  It is very easy and very satisfying.  The best lasagna recipe that I have found.

This is the best lasagna I have ever eaten.  And if you just make the sauce, its really good for spaghetti and other noodles.  I will probably never buy spaghetti sauce again.

I made this recipe the other night and am pretty happy with the results.  However, I believe the writer of the recipe confused the FLUID ounces in a pint with the amounth of ricotta you need for this recipe.  I'm sure she meant 16 ounces, which would be a large container, not the smaller one that many people seem to be making it with.  Also, I made a couple of alterations.  I, too, used white sugar instead of brown, added course ground pepper to the sauce, and the next time I make it, I will add an additional can of chopped tomatoes or reduce the meat--it was a bit too thick for a lasagna the way it was.  Overall, though, I was very happy with the outcome and my boyfriend loved it!  Will definitely make again!

My husband said this is absolutely the best lasagna he's ever had.  I made a few changes - I substituted 1/2 lb. Italian sausage for some of the ground beef.  I also added extra spice and garlic as some of the previous reviewers had suggested.  We're trying to cut down on sodium when we can so we started w/ 2 26-oz. bottles of Healthy Choice sauce and then just added the meats and spices.
PS - I wrote the above review about a year ago, and since then we've attempted to make a healthier lasagna.  I've used whole wheat lasagna noodles, fat free cottage cheese (instead of ricotta) and ground turkey.  It's still wonderful.

Wow, this was absolutely excellent!! It was so easy, and yet it tasted like something from a fancy restaurant. Actually, our neighbor said it was better than the lasagna he had at an italian restaurant. I had never made lasagna before, and this was extremely easy, although it's quite a bit of work. It helps to make it a day in advance, that way you can take your time fixing it.
I think the sauce would be really good with spaghetti too, will try that next time.
This recipe is a definite keeper.

SO DELICIOUS! I made this once and then made 2 alterations:  I swapped the ricotta for cottage cheese as I found it was less dry and much tastier.  I also added a pack of thawed frozen chopped spinach to the cottage cheese mixture.  I made 2 of these for a big family get-together over the holidays and everyone loved it!  They even ended up fighting over the leftovers the next day! Definitely a favorite!

This was a wonderful recipe.  The brown sugar created an amazing taste (careful not to put too much or the sweet undertone will overwhelm).  I will definately make this recipe over and over.  My husband loved it.  Leftovers were eaten the next day and it was just as delicious!

Well, what can I say here that the other reviews have not??  It's great...seriously fantastic.  BUT... I personally would like it a little more saucy, so next time I will add a can of tomatoes and some spices to adjust the addition.  I also use a lb of Italian sausage, because I love it.  This is a really yummy, yummy dish!

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I just started learning how to cook and this recipe was one of my first. I made this dish for a lasagna lover and it turned out perfect! A pound and a half is alot of meat, so that could be cut down and more sauce is key. Thanks for a great recipe that will be used many more times!

This recipe is awesome!! My boyfriend said he wished I would make this every week for him. I defintly agree on the extra can of tomato sauce.
I made this with lean ground turkey and low fat cheeses to curb calories and no one had a clue!

I agree with everyone else that this is a wonderful recipe.  I'm wondering if people who said that it was "too dry" missed the directions to cook your noodles first.  This is a very versatile recipe and it's easy to add veggies (I added spinach and zuc) and meat (I used both ground turkey and ground turkey sausage), or whatever else you might like in your Lasagna.  It made so much that we still have some in the freezer (which is great for us to have for lunches or quick dinners--and as our family grows will be great too, so that everyone will be full!).  I think I used less mozzarella in order to save some money, but I love cheese, so I will add the suggested amount next time.

I don't think I have ever heard anybody complained about this one, every time i serve it people just go nuts over this. I usually add mushrooms, and green peppers depending on my mood.

I also used half HOT Italian Sausage and Ground Beef and my boyfriend raved about it!  The hot sausage gave it a spiciness.  He said it was better than his mom's.  It does take a while, but it is worth it.  It made me go from a beginner cook to an excellent cook in everyone's eyes!

Very good, but too salty as is. I would eliminate the table salt altogether. The other ingredients add enough salt!

Yuck! This recipe didn't have enough sauce. It was dry and there was entirely too much ricotta cheese. I might be the only one who didnt' like this.

This produces a delicious lasagna!  Very nice... thank you, Rosemary.  The ONLY reason I gave it only 4 stars is what I perceived as a need to alter the recipe by giving it half-and-half Italian sausage and lean hamburger, adding a bit more sauce to the lasagna prior to baking, cutting back on the salt, and throwing in some mushrooms and pimentoes to suit taste.  Overall, this is a really, really good lasagna as is... don't mistake that.

This was really great lasagna. Like other reviewers, I had to add extra sauce, and I used a half ground beef, half italian sausage mixture instead of all beef. I also threw in some crushed red pepper flakes and went with the 9-noodle configuration instead of 12...other than that, this recipe produced an almost perfect lasagna for me!

This was a great lasagna. Not as time consuming as others and worth the time you do spend. I added an extra can of paste and then added a 'can' of burgundy wine to the sauce before it simmered. Added a delighful yet complex flavor. 
This one is a keeper, for sure!

This recipe definitely taught me how to make no fail lasagna!  Was delicious. I always had a hard time getting it to stay together, this recipe each slice came out whole, i was impressed. Very tastey, i did add a little extra sauce.

This was my first attempt at lasagna, and this recipe produced the absolute best lasagna I've had in my entire life. The meat had an excellent flavor, and since my pan was overflowing, I saved the extra meat and my boyfriend used it for spaghetti later and said it was great. It was nice and thick and also the cheese didn't clump together in gross curds like it does when my mom makes it. I'd definantly recommend this recipe to anybody who wants to impress somebody else. My only suggestion would be to be careful with the noodles on the very top of the lasagna. Mine dried out and became kind of crunchy, but I think if you put another thin layer over them, they'll be fine.

Good, but not much better than the version I usually make.  I substituted crushed tomatoes and small curd cottage cheese in the recipe.  Having it sit overnight did not improve the flavor that much.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! This was then most amazing lasagna I have ever had! I've made this lots of times now and I have never cooked the lasagna noodles. It saves time and the noodles soak up all the extra flavor of the sauce.  It turns our so flavorful every time! This is perfect with some garlic bread and a salad.

This could be the best lasagna I have ever had!  However, I substituted just a few items.  One tablespoon of brown sugar instead of two, one can of tomato paste instead of two and since I do not eat red meat, I used ground turkey – this was just fantastic!

Nice taste but the recipe didn't fit in my 9X13 pan!!  There was too much so I ended up adding extra sauce and making a second smaller pan.  This shouldn't be a problem in my opinion so next time I will search for a recipe that fits in one pan.

Good lasagna recipe, however, as written, I felt it was a little dry. I added quite a bit more sauce until I was happy with the consistency. Thanks Rosemary!

This was a great, classic lasagna that will suit all tastes.  I used crushed (instead of whole) tomatoes since my family doesn't like chunks. Make sure your top noodle layer is well covered with sauce and cheese, otherwise the noodle will get crunchy (which ruined it for me - but that was all my fault).  This could easily have used another TBSP parsley and another 1/4 cup of fresh basil.  If you are making for a crowd, it will definitely be a hit.

I thought this was good but not anything special.  I did double the sauce and ended up using most of it.  I did not double the meat though and still had PLENTY to go with the sauce.  It was tasty but seemed to be missing that special little something.

the lasagna was very tasty, but there wasn't enough sauce.  next time, i would add a bit of tomato sauce at the end of simmering so it would spread a bit easier (this would be particularly helpful with the no-boil noodles).  but the ricotta mixture is great, and the brown sugar was the perfect addition!

Great recipe!  I think it must be the brown sugar in the sauce that makes it taste a little different than other lasagna recipes.  I used no-boil noodles, 1/2 sausage/ 1/2 ground beef, added extra spices to season to taste, and took Rosemary's advise and made a day ahead. Superb!

This is my first attempt at making lasagna and it was a total hit!!  The meat sauce was wonderful and wasn't watery at all!  I made the sauce the night before, warmed it up and prepared the lasagna and hr before dinner.  I took the advice and doubled up on the basil and oregano.  I also added more garlic and less salt.  I'm definitely going to use it with pasta next time.  Thanks!

Very good basic recipe.  But Where's The Herbs.  I doubled this recipe and got one to freeze.  I added 3/4 cup fresh basil, 1/4 cup fresh oregano and 1/2 cup fresh italian parsley.  I grow my own herbs and love to use large quantities and that is where the flavor comes from. Everything else was great I didn't need to use the tomato paste. I just cooked the sauce a little longer.  I also added some vegetables.

Delicious - In addition to mozzarella, I added cheddar cheese as well. I also used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese. The blending of all the cheeses was delightfully rich! You definitely need to cook it longer than 39 minutes. I recommend at least an hour. Also, you MUST double the sauce. I like to double the cheese as well.

I just want to say THANK YOU ROSEMARY! My husband has always asked me to make lasagna. I refused thinking it was too hard and I would find a way to mess it up. With this recipe it was a piece of cake and oh so good. I used Skinners already cooked lasagna noodles to cut some time. We finished it all that night and my husband asked me to make more the NEXT DAY! He never does this. Thanks again Rosemary. I am forever grateful for this recipe, there are not enough stars to do this recipe justice!

This is a very good, easy, lasagne recipe.  I like a little more sauce to my lasagne than it makes, but otherwise, it was perfect.  My family *loved* it.

This was pretty good.  It was my first time making lasagna since Jr High School in Home Ec class.  The blend of spices was really good but the sauce ran thin on top and made my noodles on top a little crispy.  I would prefer more cheese.  Next time I will add italian sausage and a bigger blend of cheeses but overall this is great to have as a basic recipe.  Everyone who tried it really liked it.  Thank you.

this is a very good basic lasagna recipe.  fresh basil is a must!  i used more because i love basil and have an overgrowth of it.  if you have the time, allow it to sit overnight so it can "marinate."

After trying this recipe, I will never ever again buy store bought sauce.  It was so good that I had to get my fiancee to stir it for me because I was afraid I would eat the whole thing before I got a chance to add the other lasagna fixings to it.  There were only a couple of things I did diffrently.  First, instead of the oregano and basil, I added a couple of teaspoons of italian seasoning that I had in my spice rack.  Also, I added some crushed red pepper flakes for a little zing.  Finally, instead of cooked noodles, I used the no-boil kind that Barilla makes and then assembled everything according to the directions on the package.  Turned out fantastic!  Thanks for posting this Rosemary!!

FAB-U-LOUS!  I will add this to my regulars!  My husband ate it for three straight meals and he hates leftovers.  
I refrigerated the unbaked casserole overnight and the flavor was delicious.

This is the best and easiest lasagna I have ever made.  It only took me 40 mins to make from start to finish including cooking the sauce and noodles and assembling the layers (not including the oven baking time).  Great recipe, this is a keeper!

This was an AWESOME recipe!!!!! I made it scaled to 12 servings I fed 8 people and there were NO left overs. My brother in law even took his garlic bread and soaked up the left over sauce in the pan. My husband doesn't even like lasagna but said he wouldn't mind having this lasagna on a regular basis.

Great recipe.  I read other reviews and added 1/2 cup red wine.  My husband loved the meat version.  Next I made a vegetarian version:  I mixed shredded carrots into the sauce and I layered eggplant and squash between the cheese and sauce.  My husband never knew and absolutely raved over it.  Great recipe.  I use a large roaster pan when making lasagna, and found I need to double the recipe to make all the layers.

Hey guys, this is a very nice recipe.. If you want to kick it up a notch, just add some of that smoke a roma pepperoni( you know the little stuff).  Also add some chili powder to the meat sauce.  This is a great addition.. You'll love it..

I cooked this for the first time at my father-in-law's house, and it was wonderful!! I always thought that it was impossible to have a measured recipe for spaghetti sauce, but if you follow this, you'll be alright. I am going to use this sauce all the time, simply because I know it will always turn out good! After reading other reviews, I decided to double all of the ingredients for the sauce and it was the perfect amount. Instead of doubling the beef, I just added the same amount of sausage. MUST TRY THIS! Thanks so much for sharing this with us:)

Good recipe. Sweet sauce and lots of cheese kids liked it but they picked out the onions and tomatoes It was good. I would make again with a few changes to make it more to our tastes.

This is the first lasagna I have ever made, and by the FAR the best I had ever eaten. Even my lasagna hating hubby asked for it again!
Here is what I did differently...
Thanks to all the other reveiwers, I knew to make extra sauce.. I ended up layering one cup, 2 cups 2 cups, then using the extra on top.
Despite making extra sauce and having to adjust the herbs and spices accordingly, I didnt add any extra brown sugar. I did add 3 TBSPs of red wine.
Also, I drained a 12 oz container of cottage cheese (instead of ricotta) and probably tripled the parmesan cheese amount for the cheese mixture. (Hubby hates ricotta cheese)
I ended up with a very tasty, saucy , and most of all NEAT (not sloppy at all) lasagna. I highly recommend at least doubling the parmesan cheese recommendations for the cheese mixture, as it adds a very distinctive flavor.
The next day, I baked it covered for 45 minutes, tehn uncovered for about 15 minutes longer with extra mozzarella cheese on top.
YOU MUST LET THIS SIT OVERNIGHT BEFORE BAKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was very good but not fantastic as I thought it might be. The Lasagna noodles need to cook longer than it suggests. I am trying it again today to see if I can tweak it a bit.

This is a good recipe and I will make again! I used a lasagna pan (10x14) and increased meat to 2 lbs (lean ground pork), increased eggs to 3, used a 28oz can spaghetti sauce and 3 cans diced tomatoes and also increased cheeses and spices upward accordingly; I did only use 12 noodles though. My family loved this and any leftovers were quickly consumed the next day.

***Use less meat, add more sauce, and add extra seasoning! My suggestion is to use only 1/2 lb. of ground beef and add at least one jar (approx. 24 oz.) of your favorite tomato based pasta sauce (I added a half jar of Ragu Parmesan & Romano sauce and a half jar of Romano's All Natural Homemade Marinara pasta sauce). Without the added sauce even a 1/2 lb. of ground beef will still leave you a fairly meaty lasagna, as the sauce seems to lose some of its weight through the baking process. And without adding at least an extra half of the given amount of seasoning for each listed, in my opinion, this lasagna would taste too bland. I would also be generous with the minced garlic, any less and you probably wouldn't know it was there. This dish would probably be quicker to make given a second chance now having gone through it once and figuring out all the quirks, but both my fiancé and I were actually pretty disappointed in such an ordinary taste after all the work. We have made a couple other lasagna dinners that tasted better in less time. This recipe is by no means bad, but I definitely expected more after reading so many great reviews. I recall reading other reviews that suggest letting the mix refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to blend a little more, so doing that may help combat the "ordinary" taste we observed, but it also takes longer.

Absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it. The only changes I made were that I used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced and paste and I used noodles that didn't have to be pre-cooked.

2nd time I have made this. 1st time I over cooked it a little long but this time it turned out perfect. I added some olives to the top for a little extra color and a little bit of a pop. My wife and kids love it.

I made this a long time ago, but I remember that everyone I made it for LOVED it! I made it twice. Once for my boyfriend, and once for a Christmas party at work. I did fudge the recipe a bit, subbing pureed garlic, onion poweder, and tomator *sauce*, since I don't like my sauce too chunky.

I also eyeballed the herbs, and I tend to do. If you do this, know that it may turn out a little different every time. I know that shouldn't be a surprise, but mine did turn out a little sweeter the second time, so don't let it throw you through a loop!

Speaking of being Captain Obvious, be careful of the type of lasagna noodles you get. I tried to boil mine in water only to realize that the type I got were "oven ready", meaning that you layer the dry noodles as they are, and they use the moister in the sauces to cook. Be careful that you know exatly what kind of noodles you're getting before you cook!

Turned out perfect. Sauce seemed to be a little on the dry and thick side so we added water to thin it up a bit. Great flavor in the sauce and cheese. Excellent recipe.

I've been making this lasagna for a long time now and it is PHENOMENAL. Over the many times I've made it however I have made a few alterations. First off I use a rather large pan and only 12 noodles leaves a lot of empty places, so I used 15-18 noodles. I don't use onion, instead I use onion powder, and I sometimes switch out the fresh garlic for powdered if I don't have it on hand. I use dried basil as well. For the parmesan I use shredded, and the mozzarella I double! When I layer everything together I put an extra layer of mozzarella and then sprinkle it with grated parmesan and then some Italian seasoning on top. It's quickly become my family's favorite meal. So good!

I loved this! My first lasagna without sauce from a jar. I followed a couple of the tips others posted...Used half the amount of ground beef, added an extra 14oz can of diced tomatoes, divided the ricotta mixture into thirds, and baked 1.5 hours. It was amazing!!! My husband loved it too! This will be my new go to lasagna recipe!!!

This turned out incredibly well! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except for simmering an extra 8 oz of tomato sauce with some oregano, salt, pepper, and a fresh diced tomato from our garden to put on top of everything before baking. It made it extra juicy and added a delicious garden fresh flavour to the dish. Also regarding the cooking time: I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked 20 minutes uncovered initially. However, when I covered with foil and set the timer for another 30 minutes, I also accidentally turned the temp up to 425 degrees F (I was distracted at the moment) but it ended up working out just fine and cooking completely in 50 minutes, so a happy accident? In any case, thank you for a fabulous recipe! Everyone went for very large second portions as well as calling dibs on leftovers, so I guess that's testament enough haha. This went really well with garlic bread and a romaine salad. Thanks again!

This has to be the best lasagna I have ever had. Only thing we changed was added a pound of mild Italian sausage(can't eat the spicy) and some extra garlic.

This was the best lasagna I have made in a long time.  I've tried a lot of different recipes but this is the best.  It's not at all runny or soupy, it's thick and meaty and yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

This one was easy and delicious. We're not a big family, so I cooked this size and froze most of it. Of course when I froze it, cut it up to one serving size, so that I can defrost easily. Even 1 month in freezer, it tasted very fresh when I microwaved it.

As I am away from home, I needed a lasagne recipe similar to mine and found this online.  It was a big hit with my family; my son-in-law and husband ate two helpings!!  I tweeked it a bit by adding 1 1/2 tsp oregano, about 3 T. brown sugar, and using a 12 oz. tomato paste can as a measuring device a can of water to the meat sauce and simmered 40 minutes.  The fresh basil is a must!  I also substituted low fat cottage cheese for the ricotta.  Another hint I found and used was to cover the dish withfoil  for for the first 40 minutes of baking, and remove for the last 10-15 minutes.  I let set for at least 30 minutes.  Thumbs up from this family!!

I'm giving this 5 stars with the following changes:

- multiply all spices and the sugar by about 1.5X
- added a lot more garlic (I love garlic)
- add about 250-400ml tomato sauce or red pasta sauce
- *** cook about 20-30 min uncovered then another 1 hour lightly covered with foil

I AGREE YOU NEED MORE SAUCE . TRY WHAT YOU WANT UNTIL YOU ET ENOUGH. I PUT IN 1 LARGE TOMATO BITS OR STEWED, 1 TOMATO PASTE AND 2 CRUSHED TOMATO CANS. ALSO INCREASED ONION AND GARLIC. ALSO INCREASE COOKING TIME. LIKE ALL RECIPES I'VE FOUND YOU HAVE TO TWEEK. LOOK AT A RECIPE AND SEE IF IT MAKES SENSE FOR WHAT YOU ARE CREATING. IT IS A GREAT STARTER.THIS REQUIRED MORE SAUCE DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT.

I've tried several recipes, this one is the best.  My only suggestion is to double the sauce.  I've done that every time since the first time I have made it.  And get one of those deep foil lasagna pans that you can throw away.  You'll need the space.

Very good with some minor adjustments. I only used 1 pound of lean ground beef and that was plenty. I also substituted 1/4 tsp garlic powder for the garlic cloves and used 1 tsp dried basil instead of fresh. I cut down on the salt to 1 1/4 tsp in the meat mixture and may cut it down a little more next time. I didn't simmer the meat and tomato mixture at all (just warmed it all through) since I was going to refrigerate it overnight. I took it straight out of the fridge and  baked it at 375 for 1 hour and 10 minutes covered with aluminum foil and then 20 minutes uncovered. My friends raved!

Yummy! made it exactly as recipe states.  Only change I would make would be to double the ricotta cheese mixture, but I love cheesy lasagna.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Good starter recipe. This was good when first cooked, but much better the next day as leftovers.  I used turkey Italian sauaage instead of ground beef, had to add a bottle of spagetti sauce, added a layer of fresh spinach, grated carrots, mushrooms, diced green peppers, more spices and used fresh parsley instead of dried.  Would make again.

I make this recipe exactly as directed, except I do half ricotta and half cottage cheese.  I found it on this site several years ago and have been making it ever since -- my family, including 3 picky kids, loves it!  I don't understand everyone saying it has to cook for an hour and a half -- everything is already cooked.  30 minutes in the preheated oven to melt the cheese and bring everything together has worked wonderfully for us!

This dish was very good. I followed the advice of other viewers and added more sauce but for our taste it still was not  enough but will make this again, next time though i will use ground beef and sausage. as i was making the sauce though i thought it might be good for spaghetti as well so i may try it with that.

I have made this lasagna time after time over the years.  Family asks me to make it on Christmas Eve and I've shared pans of it with other families.  Honestly, the only change I've consistently made is that I add one large can of crushed tomatoes to the sauce.  I never boil my lasagna noodles.  Just place them in raw and assemble everything the night before serving.  I find I need the extra juice from the tomatoes to make sure the lasagna does not dry out.  Otherwise, it's great just the way it is!

Good lasagna. I used cottage cheese in place of the ricotta, and used spinach lasagna noodles. The top layer was pretty dry, but that's probably my fault. I did feel like the lasagna was missing something, overall, but it went very well with some steamed zucchini and a glass of red wine.

It taste like a "fresh" staufer's lasagna. I thought the sauce was lacking some, so i threw in half a fresh tomato, chopped. It's not as tasty, though. I would add more spices. simmering is a definate must to get the flavors to meld. Good and easy recipe though.

I added another can of diced tomatoes and increased the onions and garlic as suggested but I left out the brown sugar since I didn't want any hint of sweetness.  I also used the oven ready lasagna noodles and didn't have any issues with the dish being too dry.  Definitely need to cook it for about 1.5 hrs.  Wonderful recipe, everyone loved it!

This is a wonderful recipe. I use ground turkey instead of Ground beef. The Brown Sugar in the sauce give the lasagna a sweet taste, that isn't over the top sweet. Every one in my family loves this, even my dad who is a steak and potato guy(normally he hates Italan).

I wish I would have read the reviews but I was in a hurry so I followed the recipe exactly...definately not enough sauce.  Still very good and will be making again using other suggestions to add more paste/sauce.

Made with 'Katie's Mom's' modifications in another review.  Came out looking and tasting like a lasagna. Used ground venison, fresh herbs and sea salt, cause it's what we have on hand.  Stayed together when cut and not greasy like my own mother's. Sorry mom.

Excellent recipe. I give it four stars because I think I need to tweak it just a little. I followed the recipe but left out the sugar as per other suggestions, doubled the diced tomatoes and put in more garlic. The problem I had was I divided it in two pans, so there didn't seem to be enough meat or ricotta mixture. I have family coming soon and I'll make the 9 x 13 pan and I'm sure it'll be perfect. I'm so excited about this recipe, I've been looking for years for a "perfect" lasagna and I think this is it. THank you.

This lasagna was the best I have ever had. I added a little more mozzarella cheese and ground beef just because I like it really meaty and cheesey.

Had an exceptional taste, but was a little dry. Needed a little more "sauce". I recommend adding an extra can of tomato paste to the sauce.

I have been using this recipe since 2004. It is the best. Changes: I omit the meat and instead use chopped mushrooms and zucchini in the sauce. I use 9 noodles not 12. I have substituted both cottage cheese and tofu for the ricotta.  They both came out amazing. I add more mozzarella to the top and sprinkle grated parm to finish it off. No matter what you do to this recipe it will come out delicious. Kudos!!!

An excellent base recipe that is nice on its own, and easy to modify!

I've tried a lot of lasagna's over the years, and although there are better recipes out there, I give this one five stars because: 1) It works perfectly every time (as long as you boil your noodles instead of using ready-bake), 2) I don't have to go shopping for ingredients I don't normally keep in my pantry, and 3) It holds its shape very well.

This is definitely our favorite.  I make a few of them at once and freeze them with cooking directions on the tin foil. Then I always have something on hand for some one in need, or a new neighbor or if I'm running late.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Found it to be too soggy - lasagna tasted much better the next day when reheated in the oven.  Will try looking for a better recipe.

I love spending a whole day making this recipe, but what takes me long is making homemade lasagna noodles.  It is so worth it to have fresh pasta.  Sometimes I will invite my guests to come over early to help me make the pasta and then let them relax while I finish the lasagna.  In the end it is ALWAYS worth the wait.

Yum! I'm not a huge fan of lasagna, but this was so good.  Had to sub a couple of ingredients because I didn't have them all. I used 1 can of tomatoe paste and 1 14 oz. can tomato sauce.  Then I added about half a jar of prepared spaghetti sauce just on the top layer because it looked a little dry.

This was ok.  I followed the directions exactly for the sauce (ok, so I added crushed tomatoes instead of diced), but the flavor was too sweet.  I added garlic salt to even it out.  I added about 6 oz of additional water based on other reviews stating the lasagna was too dry, and it still ended up dry for me.  I precooked the noodles to be sure they weren't going to soak up any extra moisture.  I may try this again, but adding another container of crushed tomatoes and with some revisions to the spices.  I cooked mine for a little less than an hour, next time I think I'll cut that back to between 30-40 minutes.  I'd say you definitely don't need to cook more than that unless you're preparing this ahead of time and will be storing it in the fridge.

This recipe is one of the best I have made for Lasagna.  I added another small can of petite diced tomatoes and one small can of hunts tomato sauce, two more cloves of garlic and more oregano.  It turned out great!  I also baked it at 380 for 30 minutes, then covered it for an additional 20 minutes at the same temp.  I would recommend this to everyone!!!

Used already made sauce, But all my friends loved it. Too bad I didn't make enough for them to have seconds. Will be making this over and over again. My first attempt at cooking and it was wonderful. Thanks so much.

This is so yummy! My family is not big on Lasagna but they all went crazy for it! I've already been asked to make it again. I did the suggested changes of adding more diced tomatoes, increasing the spices, and putting some of the ricotta cheese on top. It was perfect! I served it with Roasted Italian Squash and Zuchini.

This has become a household recipe. I make one recipe exactly as listed and another half recipe using only veggies.  For a half recipe, I saute 1/2 lb mixture of sliced mushrooms and peppers.  Add 3 cups fresh spinach and the rest of the sauce ingrediants, everything else as listed. We love it.

OMG!!! I am still licking my lips from this INCREDIBLE lasagna!  I had never made lasagna before and I was nervous about how it would turn out.  Follow this recipe and you should have no problems!  I didn't have ricotta cheese, so I used cottage cheese instead and it turned out great!

This is a wonderful sweet sauce that you can adjust according to your personal tastes. I make this with ground turkey instead of beef. I've also used mushrooms and veggies instead of the meat to make a vegetarian version. I love the sauce so much I use it separately when making spaghetti.

Easy to make and really delicious!  I prepared it on a Sunday afternoon, refridgerated it overnight, then popped it in the oven when I got home from work on Monday.   Even my fiance (who has the taste buds of a five year old) loved it.

I have just moved out on my own with my new husband and am learning how to cook. This recipes was very easy to follow and it tasted great! My mother-in-law is a wonderful cook so my husband appreciates good food. He was very happy with it. I used the oven ready lasagna noodles and it turned out great and I didn't have to boil them. It made the recipe even easier!

This is an awesome recipe--I followed it exactly as written.  I made the day before and cooked at 375 for 45 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered.  A great meal to make on the weekends and enjoy during the busy week!  Thanks so much for sharing it!

This is now my absolute go-to recipe... I make it all the time for my family and friends.  I make several revisions and have perfected it to our taste.  I add more garlic, basil and brown sugar and I add an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  I usually use a lean ground beef, but have used turkey and a beef/turkey combo.  You will NOT be disappointed!

Great recipe.  Had a Superbowl party last night for my husband and 13 of his friends.  Made a double recipe and not a bite remained.  Even after 4 pizzas, 2 veggie trays and other assorted food.  Definitely make more sauce or add a jar of prepared sauce or it will be too dry.  I plan to try it with different amounts of suace to get the perfect amount.  Easy to put together too.

I've made this a few times and found the ricotta a little dry. I changed to 1 1/2 pints of cottage cheese and found the change to make it the perfect lasagna for our family.

I made this vegetarian by using Morning Star's meatless crumblers instead of the meat.  I left out the parsley because I didn't have any in the house, and I used 1 Tbs. of white sugar instead of brown sugar since I had run out.  I also added a second can of diced tomatos as other reviewers recommended.  Even with this, I was still short on sauce for the top and had to open a bottom of tomato sauce to mix in so the top layer was covered.  

The flavor was great, but the consistency was totally messed up.  I sprayed by 9x12 dish with Pam and put the first three of the nine lasagna noodles on the bottom.  I baked it covered with foil at 375 for 1 hour and 15 minutes, and this bottem layer was so tough that I could barely cut through it and it was totally inedible.  Next time I think I may cook it for only 45 minutes and possibly add some sauce to the bottom to help this layer from not overcooking.

I love this recipe but change it slightly according to household taste. I use turkey meat instead of beef, double the garlic, double the basil, half the brown sugar and add sliced mushrooms. There are NEVER any leftovers.

I made a few changes, so that is why I can't give it 5 stars.  My husband loved this so much I will make it again with the same changes.  What I did was added about 5 cloves of garlic, added about a tablespoon of oregano (maybe more) added a part of a jar of Healthy Choice Garden Veggie sauce to the bottom of the pan so the noodles wouldn't burn, then did the layers and in the next layer added some more of the veggie sauce and again at the top.  I also used no boil noodles which made this recipe super easy, but so yummy.  I also added more cheese to the top.

Just made this tonight for dinner and it was a hit!!..and so easy.  I modified it for virtue of time and lack of ingredients.  Instead of the oregano, basil, tomato paste and sliced tomatoes, i used a jar of prego basil pasta sauce.  It ensured that the lasagna had enough sauce and that it didn't dry out.  I also added a can of mushrooms and substituted a tablespoon of white sugar for the brown.

This was yummy!  We used "oven ready" lasangna noodles which dont have to be boiled which saved some time.  We made the sauce and cheese mixtures seperately and kept them in the fridge over night and just put it all together for dinner the next day.  It turned out wonderful.

This lasagna is excellent.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Next time I will make two changes. . . reduce the lasagna noodles to 9 and double the sauce, freezing what sauce is left over.  The original recipe didn't seem to have quite enough sauce to cover all the noodles.  I served it to my ladies lunch group with caesar salad, anitpasto platter and garlic bread sticks.  Everyone totally enjoyed the meal.  Top off with Tiramisu cake.

Three phrases--Love it, love it, love it!
Recipe is fantastic the way it is, fool proof everytime. Just replace beef with carrots, zucchini and mushrooms if vegetarian, otherwise works well will any sort of meat--chicken or lamb mince.

This recipe was perfect!! I was so nervous making this for my boyfriend's Italian family, but they loved it! Could have used more sauce like people said, but I don't like really runny lasagna. I didn't use the meat, but I don't think I would use the amount listed - prob just 1/2 a pound. Finally, 30 mins was the perfect cooking time! I cooked it uncovered for 30 mins and even though the top got a little brown, it was definitely cooked all the way through. I will cook covered for 25 mins and then uncovered for 10 next time. Perfection!!

Amazing, made some changes used half ground pork and the other half ground meat.  Also could not get any ricotta, so I used a bechamel sauce instead.  Came out delicious, no leftovers.

This was hands-down the best pan of lasagna I've made.  I credit the sauce recipe!  I too think it could be used for spaghetti.  To me, this seemed heavy on the meat sauce, lighter on cheese.  But that was fine.  I got confused at the end of the layering, because it seemed as though it went "meat, noodles, meat" as the last three layers. SO, that's what I did. Assuming I didn't misunderstand that, it still turned out fine!

This is a very hearty lasagna, and I think the meat sauce could be used as an equally hearty spaghetti sauce.  My husband was skeptical because I already had a lasagna recipe that he loved, but this one is going into the regular rotation, and that makes it 5 stars!  I added mushrooms while browning the hamburger and onions because we love mushrooms, and I omitted the parsley -  we don't like the flavor.  Really good!  It takes a long time to prepare, but it is worth it.

Unfortunatley I haven't had a slice of this lasagna as of yet being I made it twice for my parents, and my hubby doesn't like lasagna. (I know, he's an odd one! lol) But I was told it was just as good as my mom's recipe and that's a ringing endorsement!! My husband did try some of the sauce while it was simmering and he LOVED that! So I may have to try it for a thick spaghetti sauce.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

I have made this lasagna several times and it is the best I have ever had.  It makes a very big portion so you will have lots of left overs.  It also freezes well.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I made it as a treat for someone special, and he ate almost the whole pan over the course of two days.  It was my first time ever making lasagna, and I was surprised by how easy it was; even easier if you use the kind of noodles that don't need to be boiled first.  Yummy!

Pretty good, but not the greatest I've ever had.  But all in all, not bad at all.  I used the ready to bake noodles & I wouldn't recommend using those... the bottom layer did not get cooked all the way through.

Good.  Would def. cut back on brown sugar next time.  Warning - this recipe takes a while to make - although it is good you need to have the extra time to prepare.  Good recipe though for those who are not time restrained.

This one takes time, but it is sooooo worth it! I did add some asiago cheese to the mix because I like it so much. Also cut it into strips and criss-crossed it over the top layer before baking. Looked pretty and tasted devine!

FAB-U-LOUS!  I've made lasagna for years, but I was most proud of this one.  I believe the brown sugar is the trick.  I also liked using the diced tomatoes, and paste, and adding the seasonings, rather than buying jar sauce.  Absolutely scrumptuous!

Not as good as Italian Lasagna but overall a good recipe. Next time I will add more sauce, there just wasn't enough. Very easy to make. I made a day ahead of time and it was ready to pop in the oven the next day for a very quick and delious meal.

I love this recipe and so did my family when I made it.  I use two cans of  tomato sauce and add all the ingredients to it and let it simmer on the back of the stove while I boil my noodles for about five minutes.  I don't like layering at all, so I usually just throw everything in the pan and top it all with cheese!  The recipe is so good that it doesn't matter how it looks as long as it gets to the table.

Great recipe! Delicious! I halved the recipe and used 17 ounce of canned diced tomatoes, slightly more the recipe asked for. I did not drain the tomatoes and the sauce came out a little watery. I did use dried basil and added more seasoning than stated. I also used more onions and garlic and added some baby carrots. Although I baked the lasagna immediately after making it, it turned out wonderful. I used oven-ready lasagna noodles from Barilla and it only took 20 mins in the oven. I would definitely recommend adding shredded cheese on top of the lasagna, in addition to the 2 Tbsp of parmesan.

Made this recipe for my family last night.  Very Good.  I liked this lasagna because it just had the right amount of ricotta cheese.  It wasn't too much.  The only complaint was the sauce was a little skimpy and I had to add more from a jar.

I made this last night and normally my lasagna tasted like dry wood, but this was sooooo gooooood!  I took other reviewer's advice and added 2 cans of tomato sauce.  It was moist without being too runny. Awesome!

I had my parents over for dinner and attempted lasagna for the first time tonight.  I am so happy I read the reviews before I started.  First thing this morning I had to send my husband out for a can of sauce and it was definitely needed!!  Everyone thought it was delicious, however it definitely needed more sauce and cheese.  I also added a lot of spices because the sauce was too bland without.  But as noted in many reviews this is definitely not a runny lasagna.  It stayed perfectly and was delicious!!  I am only giving it 4 stars because if I didn't take suggestions from other reviewers it would have been extremely dry, I don't even think I added enough sauce this time.  Thank you for a very good recipe, that will be added to my recipe box (with my additives).

Good lasagna, a little more time consuming then my usual recipe.  Husband and I do not care too much for ground beef (or turkey) and there is alot in this.  Definitely cook for more then the time allowed.  I cooked 20 min uncovered, then 1 hour loosley covered.  Edges were a little dry. I also read the reviews and used only 9 noodles.  Good to accompany this dish is the Asiago cheese puffs on this site!  Will probably still make again.

I used oven-ready lasagna noodles, which I highly recommend.  I used italian sausage rather than the ground beef.  This recipe was very good but a little sweet for my taste, hence the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.

I was so excited to make this recipe because of the great reviews and ratings.  I'm bummed though, because I was disappointed in the taste.  It did  taste good, but I expected more like a 5-star recipe.  I did love the way the meat came out when it was simmering...very thick and tangy.  However, when it was all said and done, it tasted like normal lasagna.  Don't get me wrong, this recipe wasn't bad, I didn't get the usual  mmm's and yummy's from the family, or myself.  Thanks though, I enjoyed cooking it!

I was a bit disappointed with this lasagna.  It seemed dry and after sitting for 10 minutes, it cooled too much.    I didn't get many compliments for this one, even though the flavor was good.

I LOVE this recipe. It is my favorite  lasagna recipe and now the only one I will ever use. I made it per the recipe the first time but now omit the brown sugar because I found it to be too sweet (for me). Other than that it is perfect the way it is. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I doubled the diced tomatoes, brown sugar, spices, and tomato paste to give the lasagna more sauce.  I could hardly keep my husband out of the sauce as it was simmering.

I do not make lasagna very often, maybe 2-3 times/year and have never used any of the  cheese mixes mentioned in many recipes, but make béchamel sauce from scratch and sprinkle cheese over (I haven't seen béchamel used in many recipes but I always use it). I make it with butter, flour, milk, nutmeg – recipes are easy to find. When I layer ingredients, use pasta first, meat, béchamel and cheese – use mozzarella it is great. Everyone loves it hope you’ll take my advice.

I lost my lasagna recipe so I tried this. It blows mine out of the water. It made enough to serve a small army, but was gone before the weekend was over. Thank you -- very delicious.

We loved this lasagna. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  My son gave me a big hug when he saw I was making lasagna with cottage cheese in it, because my original recipe doesn’t have cottage cheese.  In my original recipe I use a pepperoni stick and cut it up in little pieces and it gives it a spicy taste, next time I make this lasagna I’m putting pepperoni in it. I think it’s going to give it just what it needs, a little bit of spice flavor. Thank you.

This lasagna tastes great.  My mother made it first and didn't drain the juices enough, and it was mushy on the bottom.  When I made it, I drained the sauce a bit more and it came out perfect.  My husband loved it!

This was the first time I made lasagna and it turned out great. Following the tips in the previous ratings I reduced the brown sugar and salt and it tasted wonderful. I will definitely keep this recipe for the future.

I made this for my future mother-in-law who is one of the best cooks around.  She loved it so much, she's passed the lasanga crown to me so now I have to make it for our holiday dinners.  It was excellent and the leftovers were even better!!

First time making lasagna, and this has to be the best lasagna I have ever had. The recipe was great, but next time I might use a little more ricotta. Still was very delicous.

Excellent flavor! I did change it to suit my kids. I used layers of sliced swiss cheese (I know, sounds strange) in place of the ricotta. It's worth a try. We always freeze some and it's even better the second time around!

I get rave reviews for this.  I use half ground round and half italian sausage, and sometimes I substitute dried basil although it is better with the fresh.

This was some of the best lasagna I've ever eaten. I definatly reccomend letting it sit overnight before baking, and I used fresh mozzarella, which definatly improved the taste (not that it was bad before). Definatly reccomend this recipe to anyone.

This Tasted Great! A Hit! I used the no-boil noodles and I do not suggest it! They had a hard time cooking. But the taste was so wonderful I didn't even care! I'm not a big fan of basil So I used fresh Italian parsley instead. Will make often, next time with the normal noodles.

This lasagna was incredible!  The only changes I made were to use hot ground italian sausage (pork) and then I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  This was the best lasagna I've ever had!

I had never made homemade lasagna and wanted a recipe that would be easy, but taste authentic also.  This recipe definitely did the trick!  The meat sauce was fabulous with a little bit of a sweet taste.  It gave my boyfriend indigestion, but he enjoyed it going down!  Great recipe!

I was looking for a quick, simple lasagna dish that my family would love.  Well I found it.  I got great reviews from all. Next time I would probably cut back on the brown sugar a bit, but overall it was a delicious success.

My sister made this for family night and it was great! The only change she made was to put in fresh parsley instead of dried.

This recipe was awesome.  The whole family loved it.  To make it easier I used thin lasagne noodles that you do not have to boil and it turned out great.  Thanks!

This was really good.  I didn't have all the ingredients to make the sauce from scratch so I just used a nice store bought sauce instead.

This is a good lasanga.  It was my first attempt at making it, and I was pretty impressed.  My boyfriend really liked it as well.  I do agree that it is slightly dry, but I don't like a sloppy lasanga, so I would only add slightly more sauce.  My boyfriend said it was perfect, though. I used ground turkey, but followed everything else exact, except I used dried basil and fresh parsley because that is what I had on hand.  I will make this again.

I was pretty disappointed with this. I made some of the recommended changes such as cutting back a bit on the brown sugar and adding the can of tomato sauce but it was WAY too thick and tasted too tomato-e (don't know how else to describe it). Wasn't dry but the flavor wasn't anything special. Instead of a 24oz can of sauce I would suggest 8 oz of tomato sauce and 8-16 oz of water. Definately bummed after the two hrs of work.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. And the ingredients do allow for some personalization. Like others, I added an extra can of tomatoes. I found that it overflowed my regular 9x13, I would recommend a deep dish 9x13 if you have one. The way the flavors came together was great. I used turkey instead of beef and it was perfect! My husband raved about this, saying it was the best meal I had ever made!

This is the BEST Lasangna recipe EVER! My Husband and I both loved it! It is a bit of work, but well worth the leftovers! I did do as others suggested and added another can (12oz) of tomato paste, so it was nice and saucy. Not dried out like my Mom's recipe. I will have to send her this one! Thanks Rosemary!

We really liked this recipe but it was a little dry.  The second time I made it I added tomato sauce.  I also added a little extra of the herbs so the sauce would not mask the original flavor.  It tasted exactly like the first time and was not as dry.

This recipe is great!  It tastes just like my grandma used to make it.  It is a little time consuming, but well worth it at the end! The only thing I noticed was if you increase the servings, it takes longer to cook and you are going to want to use a bigger dish.  Otherwise, the recipe was very outstanding!

So very delicious.  This is the best lasagna I have ever had.  It tastes like something you would find at restraunts.  I used the pepper flakes too and it added that extra zip to the lasagna.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Great recipe!  My first attempt at making lasagna.  My boyfriend thinks I'm a great cook...thanks to this recipe I can really play it off like I am!!  I took the suggestion to add extra diced tomatoes (I used another 14.5 ounces)  Other than that, I like the recipe as is!  Thank you:)

I've made this recipe over a half dozen times.  It comes out incredible.  It is time consuming though.  More than the 30 minutes prep time, but well, well worth it.  Just give yourself some extra time.  Or as Wanda states, make it a day or two ahead.  It also freezes very well.  I split the recipe in half and freeze a half and it's all ready to go for a second meal.  It's amazing with a ceasar salad and some garlic cheese bread.  I love it, I love it, I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I really like the flavor of this lasagna.  I may have done something wrong, but it was really dry.  I had a hard time spreading the three layers of sauce over three layers of noodles in a 9x13 inch dish.  I think I will use two cans of tomatoes next time.  Will definately make this again.

Outstanding!  Cooking time was more like 2 hours because we let it marinate overnight.  Next time I might cook it the day I make it and then just reheat it when it's time to eat.

This lasagna was delicious.  This was the first lasagna i'd ever made and my entire family was pleased.  Will make again, next time with a little more sauce and mozzarella (where cheese lovers)

Great recipe...Being that my family is right of the boat from Italy, I decided to try a different recipe for Lasagna than our own, it was very good, but it was missing something...maybe adding some breadcrumbs to the meat? Not quite sure, but it was good overall. Defiently better the next day

Very good recipe. I used veggie beef crumbles instead of beef, and I added about a half cup of shiraz, but I imagine any red wine would compliment the sauce beautifully. Will make again. Thanks!

My first homemade lasagna! It received great reviews...yeah! I did tweek it a little like others suggested by using less meat and less salt, and a smidge more spices. I also added a splash of red wine,next time I will probably do more. I added another 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, but that wasn't enough, it was still a little dry

The best Lasagna ever! I had to make a few changes because I’m living in Kenya and the products very. I used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and about 8 fresh tomatoes chopped. Because my tomato paste is so strong I added more brown sugar and some white sugar to taste. I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese. I didn’t cook the noodles before I baked it and it turned out wonderful. I’ve made it three times this past month. The family can’t get enough of it! Thanks Rosemary, it’s now a family favorite!

We love this lasagna. It's worth the time it takes to make it. As Rosemary suggests, this is much better when prepared a day or two before baking/serving.  I've altered the redipe slightly after making it several times. I use less meat, fresh oregano (double the amount to equate to the dried), half the brown sugar, less salt (usually I leave out the salt in the ricotta mixture), and add 29 oz can of tomato sauce. Also, no boil noodles work fine, esp if you make it ahead of time. I've also tried the fat-free ricotta and didn't notice a difference. 
Yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe and it was easy to make and tasted great. I only altered a few things and that was the garlic, I added alot more because I love garlic, some garlic powder, and I threw some cheddar cheese in the mix also because I love cheesy lasagna. It was great. Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper.

I made this tonight and it was one of the best recipes I ever made!! I added 1 lb. hamburger and 1 lb. sausage instead of the 1-1/2 lbs. hamburger and I added sea salt & fresh cracked pepper to the meat mixture while cooking. I used 1 can Italian tomatoes and a can of regular diced tomatoes and also added a 12 oz. can tomato sauce. I do agree it would have been a little dry without it.

Fabulous! I thought when I was reading the recipe that it might be bland or dry since it's quite easy to make, but it really had lots of flavor. It isn't a sloppy sort of lasagna where you need lots of bread sticks to make up for all the extra sauce, Even after I Added an extra 12 oz. of tomato sauce (which I recomend doing, becuase without it, it may have been too dry). I will definitelly be using the recipe again.

This was absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!  The only change I made was to up the amount of minced garlic from 2 to 4 (I like a slightly more garlic taste).  I also doubled the amount of oregano.

This was alright.  Didn't know my boyfriend hated ricotta cheese (thought he just hated cottage cheese), so he didn't like it at all.  I thought it was good; dry, like some other reviews said, but still alright.

I vowed that I wouldn't give this recipe 5 stars just because everyone else did, but I have to agree it is scrumptious!  It cost less than $20 to buy all of the noodles, fresh basil, tomatoes and paste, and all of the cheeses (and I even grated a big hunk of parmigiano reggiano, instead of using the kind in the can)!  Be careful with the salt, especially with the saltiness of the parm.  I cut it by 1/2 tsp.  I also added half of a 28 oz. jar of spaghetti sauce.  It was just perfect.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks Rosemary!

I've tried a few lasagna recipes over the years, and this was the best I've tried! My guy and dad both said it tasted like something they'd get in a restaurant. 
The only changes i made were a half cup jar sauce and jack cheese instead of mozzarella (I didn't have any on hand and it tasted good anyway!). I probably had a half cup of jack cheese at most, so you could probably reduce the amount of cheese and not even notice. 

Anyway, great recipe! Thanks.

This was easy and delicious. Tasted like the lasagna's you'd get from the store in a box - but I agree that the sauce comes out a little dry.

This was absolutely delicious but I won't prepare it the day before again.  It was a little dry after being reheated.  Instead I will make the meat mixture the day before and then assemble and bake the day it is to be eaten.

If you're looking for a fantastic, meaty lasagna, look no further!  This is really, really good.

I substituted 1/2 lb italian sausage for 1/2 lb of beef.

So many reviews said that this was a dry lasagna, so I made a second batch of sauce except I only used 1/2 pound of sausage in it.  I only needed a very small amount of the extra sauce.  Oh well, I'll just freeze it for later.  

If you don't like salty food, you may want to cut out the second addition of salt.  It's definitely salty.

This lasagna was very good. I did make a few changes though. I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 sausage. Also, it didnt make a lot of sauce so I added 1/2 a jar of pre-made spaghetti sauce. I also didn't add any salt to the ricotta cheese mixture after reading previous reviews. Will make again.

Turned our really really good, one of the best lasagna recipes I have tried. I added a little red wine to the tomato sauce mix, and instead of using ground beef I used spicy italian pork sasusage. I also added a layer of chopped spinach between the mozzarella and the tomato/meat layer. Will definitely make this again.

Great, but a little dry. I added 1 1/2 cups of water to the sauce in order to use the no-cook noodles (to save time). the entire dish was delicious and loved by my family (who said to double oregano and garlic next time) and I will also add another cup of water or tomato juice for using this kind of noodle.

This lasagna is delicious.   I have been making it  regularly for over two years. Since lasagna is so tedious to prepare, I make 6 at a time and freeze 5 of them for other meals (one will be served on Christmas Day this year!).  I use two of the six pound cans of crushed tomatoes from Costco (costs a little over $2 per can), 6 twelve-ounce cans of tomato paste (also from Costco), 2 pounds of Italian sausage with 4 pounds of ground beef, and oven-ready lasagna because I prefer the texture of the noodles.  Baking time for me has been one hour covered, 15 minutes uncovered.  Absolutely wonderful recipe!

This was the best lasagna I ever had!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written.   There are only two of us so I froze more than half of it for later.  Great recipe.

Really, really good.  I used half ground beef, half Italian sausauge and used an Italian shredded cheese blend in place of the mozza.  Served it to guests and everyone raved.  This will be my new lasagna recipe.  Other than the changes I made, the only other thing I'd change is to drop the salt from 1 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp.

This recipe is really great.  I didn't follow the directions to a T...I only put in 1/2 of the brown sugar.  I also added about 1 cup of canned spagetti sauce, and doubled the garlic.  I put in a few shakes of hot chili peppers as well.  All in all, this is a really tasty and easy to make lasagna!!

Made this after trying many other lasagna recipes.  Did take some advice from others' reviews.  Need only 9 noodles. Used one pound beef. Added one cup chopped fresh basil near the last 5 minutes of cooking time in the sauce. Added extra garlic. Layered spinach leaves. Turned out excellent!  Be sure to remember the brown sugar. It added an extra "something" to it.

YUMMY.  I made this for a dinner party (along with my french bread recipe that I submitted) and it was gobbled up.  I also used 1 jar and 1/2 of spagetti sauce instead of messing with making homemade.  I did doctor up the sauce with brown sugar, garlic salt, paprika, red pepper and Italian seasonings.

Wonderful recipe, got rave reviews from my mom and boyfriend!  I made a few adjustments though.  First of all I made my own lasagna noodles from scratch.  I used 2 scant cups of allpurpose flour, 3 eggs, a pinch of salt and about a tablespoon of olive oil, but it depends on the humidity where you live.  I brought it together in the food processor until it formed a ball, kneaded it for 2 mins and put it in the fridge to rest for a half hour before rolling it in my pasta machine to about a 7 thickness.  In the recipe, I omitted the sugar and used a combination of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, as well as the tomato paste.  You should always put a little sauce on the bottom before placing your first noodle layer so it doesn't dry out too much.  Also, like other reviewers suggested I did the last layer noodle-ricotta-sauce-cheese and it was just right.  I baked it for about 35 mins and it came out perfectly!

I decided to try this one instead of my usual basil lasagna and it was a huge hit. I used 1 1/2 Tb of brown sugar and I think 1 Tb would have been just a little better. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I asked my family before rating how many stars out of five. They said five because it was great and they could find a single thing they would change. Thank you for this one!

This was good.  I doubled the sauce and cheese mixture and used 2lbs of ground beef.  I only needed 9 noodles.  I don't think there is any need to lay noodles on the very bottom, and don't lay them on very top, they will be hard.  Start and end with beef mixture.  Then cover with a light layer of mozerella.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and gives you alot of leftovers for a reasonable price.  Since ricotta and freshly grated parmessan cheese are a little pricey, I used powdered parmessan cheese and cottage cheese and it was still awesome.  Definitely recommended for anyone who likes Italian food!

It was delicious.  I added a bit more cheese since that is my favorite part of lasgna.  I also used the no bake noodles and I loved it.  Can't wait to eat more leftovers!

I don't eat meat, so I made this without tasting it.  I added some extra sauce and left out the sugar as others suggested. Everyone loved it, so this recipe is a keeper.

This is a good recipe.  It seems to be missing something.  I added spinach to my cheese mix.  The basil can a little strong at times.

Awesome! I had to try this one when I saw over 1000 reviews and it still had a 5 star rating.  Now I know why.  This has to be the best lasagna recipe I have found (not runny like other recipes).  Also, this is one of the few recipes I followed without making my own change with one minor exception.  The only change I made is that I added an extra noodle at each layer (cooked extra because of breakage and I wanted to use them up).  My kids asked for seconds!!!  This will be the only lasagna recipe I use.  Thanks and I will look for other recipes by Rosemary Stoker!

Excellent! I added a small (8 or 9 oz, I forget) can of tomato sauce because I thought the sauce looked too thick, but otherwise followed the exact recipe, refrigerated overnight and it turned out delicious!!

This is my first time making Lasagna.  I put all the noodles in and they kind of stuck together.  

Other than that the recipe was great.  Very easy and the sauce can be used as pasta sauce!  Delicious.

I would definitely make more sauce cause I did run out on the top layer.

Awesome recipe!  I make it a little easier and healthier by using an 8-oz package of pre-shredded cheese, rather than using the 16-oz "brick".  It is time consuming, but everyone I've served it to loves it!

Great Recipe!! My husband and I thouroughly enjoyed this recipe and for an extra health kick, I added chopped frozen spinach and replaced the ground beef with ground turkey!  The author's hint to keep it refrigerated overnight before baking made the dish very flavorful.

Wonderful flavor and easy to make!! Just takes some time. I might recommend using a 4 quart dish as the sauce overflowed in the oven when I made it. I will always use this recipe when I make lasagna!!

This was my first time making lasagna and it turned out terrific!  Not too runny, not too dry and the ricotta/parmesan mixture is absolutely delicious.  I used 2 tsp. mixed Italian herbs instead of the basil and oregano, because it was all I had, but it still turned out wonderful. I will definitely make this again and again.

This was the best lasagna I've ever made! Try it you won't regret it. I added a layer of mushrooms on the first layer and a layer of pepperoni on the sencond layer. I might try sausage next time. I also followed the previously mentioned suggestions and added a cup of tomatoe sauce. For the top I added meat sauce and mozzarella, cheddar and parmesian cheeses.

I changed it a little bit and will change it a little more next time.  I used 1lb. ground beef and 1/2lb. Itallian sausage for a little richness.  Next time I will halve the parmesan in the cheese sauce.  Great recipe, though.  The second day it is really good.

This is the easiest lasagna I've ever made. I thought it was just right. I don't really like my lasagna to be too saucy. So I didn't change anything. It tasted very good. And all ingredients were either on hand or easy to find. And where I live I only have one store to shop from. I make this recipe often.

Very good.  I would recommend increasing the amount of sauce that you make (by adding more crushed tomatoes.)  Once I started making the lasagna I saw that I was going to run out of sauce so 1/2 thru, I had to make more sauce.  Other reviewers suggested to make more sauce (so I should have listened.) Once I increased the amount of sauce, my lasagna was perfect - not too dry.

This was GREAT and Everyone loved it. The only problem I had was that I used the no boil noodles. DON'T use them. The noodles were not as soft as the should be ( not crunchy though) because the sauce isn't juicy the noodles don't get wet enough while baking. but other than that little problem it turned out fantastic.

This recipe turned out really well.  I did not use the beef (as my boyfriend is vegetarian) and I added a bit more garlic than called for and used less sugar.  It turned out to be very tasty and I would recommend this recipe.

Great basic recipe! I changed a few things.  I cut the sugar in half, used cottage cheese instead if ricotta (it's a texture thing, ricotta is a little grainy for my taste),turkey instead of ground beef. I added anise seed and 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar (can use red wine). I used cheddar for 1/2 the cheese. Even better the next day.

Yummy Yummy!  A hit at our Christmas eve party.  Will definitly make again.  I did make extra sauce as some of the other reviews suggested.  I agree that it would have been a little dry without it.

This is probably the 5th or 6th time we have used this recipe and our group of friends say it is awesome.  Some say it is the best they have had but I think it is some of the red wine speaking.  The only minor adjustment I made tonight was to add another can of diced tomatoes for the double recipe.  Keeps well and I made it over a two night span. The kids seem to like it too.

A bit time comsuming, but perfect... wouldn't change a thing. I usually make two or three pans at a time to satisfy the masses that come over looking for a piece. ;) Simply wonderful.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but it was only okay. It was my first real homemade lasagna, but I followed the directions to a T. The only change I made was add more tomato sauce because it was too dry, then it was STILL too dry. It also took a great deal of preparation time. After spending almost 3 hours in the kitchen, I was not happy with the results. It also was a little too sweet as others have mentioned. I don't think I'll be making this one again. For the amount of time, it's not worth it.

The flavor in the lasagna was excellent! The only thing that was over kill was the amount of mozarella cheese! Wayyyy too much! I would recommend half the amount and a little more veggies. Maybe some zucchini or spinach? Just to make it a little healthy :)

This is good. I used italian sausage as a matter of preference. I also tossed in some cottage cheese to the ricotta mixture because I needed to use it. The "sauce" was my favorite part.

This was a good basic recipe, but I only gave it 3 stars because it needed a lot of modifications.  Just to recap: a lot more sauce is needed.  I pureed the tomatos and I think that helped, but next time I'd buy more tomatos and reduce half the meat.  I added a cup of red wine to make the flavor richer, and baked covered for about 45 minutes.  Could probably do with less cheese as well.

Five stars with the following modifications.  I used ground turkey & turkey sausage, 5 cloves garlic, and omitted the brown sugar.  I added a splash of white wine to the sauce.  Lessen the salt in meat to 3/4 tsp. because 1-1/2 tsp is too salty.  Used fresh parsley & freshly grated parmesan, and 1/2 tsp salt in ricotta mixture instead of 1 tsp.  Also I lessened the mozzarella cheese to 8oz & it was very good. It's not necessary to fully cover every noodle with sauce -- it will come out too runny if you do that. I had enough sauce without needing to add any extra and it came out perfect.

I don't know about 'American Lasagna' - my English mum's been making this for 20 years! I sautee a finely chopped onion, a stick of finely chopped celery and some diced mushrooms with the ground beef and garlic (mum adds a handful of thick-sliced back bacon too, but I don't bother as you can't get decent bacon in the US) plus a VERY generous shake of dried Italian seasoning as opposed to fresh herbs. I don't bother with the sugar either. This is a really great recipe! We have it with a green leafy salad, really good bread, and a bottle of chianti. Fabulous!

This is a great recipe, but next time I will make a few adjustments. For one, I will only use 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar, more cheese (both mozza and ricotta), use 1lb ground beef and 1/2 lb Italian sausage and use diced tomatoes with basil and garlic. The basic recipe is very, very good and I had no complaints from my boyfriend, I just want to make it a bit more my own. Thanks!!!

This was a delightful lasagna.  I have been searching for a recipe for lasagna for a long time, and I had come across several, but this looked the best out of all of them, and it was very simple.  I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta, and I added a red bell pepper and sun dried tomatoes to the sauce mixture.  I also added about 2 more cups of mozzarella cheese to the layers.  I made it the night before, and let it refridgerate overnight as per suggestion of Rosemary, and letting all the flavors mingle overnight made this recipe truly delicious.  I'll definately make this one again!

This lasagna is quite good.  My only complaint is that there is too much cheese for my taste. It makes it a bit heavy but I am sure there are people who love lots of cheese.

This was great.  Had everything on hand except the onion, so substitued onion powder, and instead of ground beef, took hot sausage out of casing, crumbled, and sauteed that, and it gave it more of a kick...will definitely make this again.

Have to agree with all the other reviewers. Excellent lasagna recipe.  Ranks up there with one of the best. The sauce is REALLY good, I'm really picky.  I like the addition of the brown sugar to this recipe. I've been cooking for awhile, and know that using a touch of sugar in tomato-based sauces helps to bring out all the flavor of the tomatoes. A little time-consuming, but this lasagna is worth it. Did make use half ground beef/half Italian sausage though, like others suggested.  And, if you can, seriously try using the fresh herbs, it does make a difference.

It was a very good lasagna, I substituted 1/2 lb of italian pork for the 1/2 of extra beef. Added quite a bit of extra seasonings and a lot of extra cheese, cheddar and parmesean mixed about 1 cup to top it off.. yummy:)

A keeper for sure. Do use the advice of others on doubling the cheese mixture for I did and it was just enough. Be careful not to make your layers to thick or you will run out of sauce. We like alot of meat-sauce so I will double the sauce the next time. If you don't have any basil at home then just buy can diced tomatoes with basil.

I had this on the weekend with my neighbors.  She raved about this lasagna saying that she hadn't tasted one as good as hers until she had this one.  And, I might add, she loves her lasagna!  I used the oven ready lasagna so I used a little more sauce.

My girlfriend was absolutely bowled over when I made this for her. She also loves the sauce so much that I make it at least once a month and always make a triple batch so that we can freeze some of it for easy meals. I use a combination of ground beef and hot turkey sausage and bump up the amount of fresh garlic and oregano. I just started adding some crushed red pepper and it's even better with the lasagna!

Doubled the cheese portion for an even creamier dish.  I overheard my neighbor kid proclaiming to his friend, "Dawg, that lasagna was the Ba-ZOMB.  I tore the plate UP!"  In adult-speak that means "It's good and I ate until the plate was clean!"

This was a pretty good recipe - except my husband thought the brown sugar gave it a strange taste and would've liked it better without.  I liked the flavor, but am giving it four stars since I made some adjustments and thought it was more complicated than it needed to be.  I added an additional jar of sauce and the consistency was about perfect, but overall I thought the recipe was too much work for flavor that was pretty basic.  I don't think I will make this again - my usual recipe is much easier with just as good of results.

This is truly the best lasagna.  I leave the meat and garlic/onion mix separate from the sauce and only reunite them upon assembly.  This makes for a more dramatic meat flavor.  If you boil the meat with the sauce it makes the meat bland and does not add to the flavor of the sauce. I also added extra cheese and sauce to allow for more layers.  And I used no boil noodles!  Thank you for sharing Rosemary.

Good lasagna, but it actually took me about 2.5 to 3 hours to make it.  Don't know that the end result is worth that much time.  I liked the recipe for Baked Ziti I just as much and that only took about an hour to make.

Great recipe.  Used venison rather than beef.  And kind of ad-libbed on the amounts, but absolutely loved the results as did my very Italian in-laws.

I liked this but my husband didn't.  I don't know what, but he kept saying it "needed something".  I wish I knew what!  I thought it was quite good.  My 5 yr. old son said he felt he should pay me money for making this!  No complaints from him!

Very yummy but time consuming.  I made two so it took that much longer.  I used half low fat sausage and 1/2 ground beef.  I also used the diced tomatoes and past with the oregeno, garlic and basil flavor (most brands sell that now, I used dole).  I did not drain the diced tomatoes.  I had plenty of sauce and the flavor was great!  I made it the night before and cooked for about 1 and 1/2 hours.

I printed this recipe off one night for my husband to make the next day while I was at work and when I came home it was done and delicious.  My hubby is not much of a cook but he did a great job on this, I told him to omit the brown sugar and add a pkg of frozen chopped spinach to the cheese mixture and it turned out great.  If he can do it anyone can.

This lasagna was by far the best that I've ever eaten! I served it to my family and they all loved it. Even my three year old neice liked it! I will absolutely make this dish again and again. It took awhile to make but it was well worth it. Thanks so much for this recipe, Rosemary!

I made this recipe last Christmas Eve and everyone without exception raved about it. When I
mentioned to several family members I was planning to make it again this year, each one of
them were excited about it. We have a big family, so I make two, and use aluminum foil disposable pans to make clean up easy. This is one of my
favorite recipes. No changes necessary.

Excellent :)
I made this Friday night and baked it Saturday night.  The only thing I did differently was I used 3 cups mozarella, 1 cup pizza cheese and added 1/2 tsp italian seasoning to the meat/oregano/basil mixture.  
One word of warning:  If you're somewhat liberal with the sauce like I was you may want to have some squeeze pizza sauce on hand to make sure you can cover the top layer.  That way it won't get dried out. :)  I had to do that but it still tasted excellent :)

I loved this recipe! My whole family ate it up. I didn't add as much ricotta as the recipe called for, but we're not big fans of that cheese. It was sooo good and the leftovers were just right the next day!!

This was the best lasagna I have ever made. My in-laws came for dinner and they raved, which was a surprise because the mother in law has NEVER complimented me on ANYTHING!!! She even asked for the recipe. My husband requests this dinner all the time and this is one left-over dish he will eat for 2 or 3 nights in a row! Because there are just the 2 of us in the house, I freeze half of it and we eat them as "tv dinners" when I don't feel like cooking. Wonderful recipe - I am hooked.

Really tasty lasagna!  
 It worked. I follow recipes but prefer to add my touch of creativity; I used fresh herbs where the recipe called for dry. I added 1 brick of softened cream cheese and mixed this with the ricotta et al. I browned 12 sweet italian sausages. I decided to use 1.5 cans of Hunt's Tomato Sauce to guarantee moist lasagna.
One comment to the prep time is that it took me longer than 30 minutes to prepare. Well worth the effort!

I personally liked this lasagna, but the preparation was a little more involved than my current recipe.  So that was a negative.  Also, my husband didn't care for it.

However, *I* liked it and may make it time to time just for variety!

This was very tasty.  The adjustments I made were adding only 1 tablespoon brown sugar instead of the 2, adding a 1/2 cup of water to the sauce and mixing cheddar with the mozzerella. I also had to cook if for about 45 minutes to an hour in a preheated oven.

This was really good. I am not a big tomato fan, so I added 1/2 the tomatoes. I added 1/2 can of water and 1/2 can of red wine. The red wine gave it a really good taste. My husband who is very picky when it comes to lasanya really liked it. I will make this again.

This was SO tasty. I made a couple of substitutions - used Morning Star ground beef subsitute and cottage cheese rather than ricotta. It only needed to bake for 30 minutes and it turned out just right. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is excellent!  I have tried many Lasagnas and this homemade sauce is the ticket!  I made two and froze the other.  I then defrausted the frozen batch over night and cooked as directed .... still WONDERFUL!

Very good lasagna. It was my first time making it and it was a success. I would recommend making a little more sauce because I did not have much for the top layer. I used tomato puree instead of diced tomatoes. Will definitely make again.

This is probably the BEST lasagna I've ever eaten, or made!

I tend to make it with the oven ready noodles instead though.

Thank you for this recipe! I wish I had read some of the reader suggestions before making it. Next time, I will definitely reduce the salt and increase sauce. I will also make it a bit Un-American by reducing the cheese. It is a sea of cheese. I am grateful I added an enormous salad on the side. We all had to lie immobile on the floor for a while after this one.

This was a good lasagna recipe, however I definately plan on making a few revisions the next time I make it. Definately add more of all the seasonings(esp. garlic) to the sauce, and omit the salt in the cheese mixture---the cheeses are salty enough on their own. Overall very good. I had no problem with the sauce, didn't add any extra sauces to it, and had plenty for the whole lasagna. The trick is to spread it out thinly over each layer, instead of just spooning it on. Also, add some sauce to the bottom of the dish before adding your noodles. This lasagna cut so easily.

A very easy lasagne to make.  My whole family loves this, especially by two year old.  It is great to freeze the leftovers for another meal.  I've added this to my regularly used recipes.

This is an excellent recipe.  This was the first time I had ever made lasagne.  My husband loved it.  He wants it all the time now.  I added Italian sausage to the recipe along with the ground beef.

This is great!  I always get compliments when I make it and everyone asks for the recipe.  Where I am I sometimes have a hard time finding rocota cheese so I tried it with cottage cheese instead and it still turned out ok but using rocota is definetly better

This recipe is a good go-by, but there was not nearly enough sauce, so the lasagna was pretty dry. I had to use some jar sauce in my fridge to "juice" it up a bit.

Oh my! Tasty lasagna. I was a little heavier on the basil because I love it. I found the brown sugar a marvlous addition! I mixed in some red chili flakes in the ricotta. I used ground sirloin for it's superior flavor since meat is  predominant in the sauce. I did have to add a can of tomato sauce for the same reason others did.  I did a little heavier on the cheese(except the ricotta) because I love cheese! It was very "YUM"...and yes, I'll try it with Italian sausage next time..the hot ones!! I'll make this again and again!!

This is the first lasagna I've ever made, and it was great!  For the sake of laziness: I used 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh, and 1 tsp dried basil instead of 1 tbsp fresh chopped.  I also left out the parsley because I didn't have it and didn't want to spend money on it.  This is a nice, straightforward, easy recipe that anyone can follow, and it's less expensive than many lasagna recipes.  My husband LOVED it.

This was really excellent.  I was reading the reviews as I was making it, so I added 2 more cans of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce.  I used the oven ready noodles, but as I laid them down, they curled up and it was difficult to spread the cheese mixture onto them.  So, it wasn't very cheesey, but it sliced like cake!  Made it for a crowd and everybody loved it!  Go for it...you won't be disappointed!

I made this lasagna for my family last night and everyone loved it.  I served it with garlic bread and salad.  There wasn't enough meat sauce for the last layer, so I added a little sauce I already had.  Other than that - this recipe was great!  I will definately make it again.

Excellent recipe!  I am not a good lasagna maker and this came out looking great and tasting great.  I used no boil lasagna noodles, and baked it in a stone dish.  The sauce was easy and great.  It definately tastes better as it sits.  I will make this again.  The sauce part of the recipe can be used as a meat sauce over pasta.  Thanks

This is the best tasting lasagna i ever tasted. My son says it tastes like Olive Gardens lasagna. The sauce is so good that I make it for all my pasta dishes.

I cook and deliver lunch or dinner to 25 to 60 people every weekday.  This was my first try at lasagna, and what a hit it was! Most said they would like more cheese, but the sauce is awesome.  I will use it for my spaghetti sauce too.
Thank you Rosemary!!!

What a great recipe!  This was my first attempt at Lasagna. I read several reviews and incorporated many of the ideas.  Most importantly, I thinking adding liquid helped a lot.  I added some tomato sauce, a little bit of water, and a half cup of red wine.  I agree wholeheartedly with those who recommended cutting back on salt. In fact, in the future, I will not add salt at all. The no-bake Barilla noodles are the best! I also used half Italian sausage and half ground beef and all fresh spices (doubling the spices).  I increased the recipe to 12 servings.  Baked for 90 minutes at 375.  Came out perfect!!  I had 10 people at the table, four of whom are very accomplished cooks.  They loved it!!  Rave reviews.

Unfortunately I made entirely too much of this lasagna so my husband and I will still be eating this a week from now. This lasagna was VERY GOOD! I about fell on the floor when my uncle came up and told me he could do without all the other things I've made and just eat the lasagna. I actually received rave reviews from other family members and friends as well. AND I was the one in the family that no one thought I could cook. Thanks to your recipe Rosemary I've proved differently.

We all loved this recipe, including my teenager son! Next time, I'm going to cover it before cooking so the top layer is not as dry. But the taste was fantastic - well worth the effort.

Pretty good but it did come out a bit dry - I prefer my lasagna a little "saucier" on the inside, and sort of cripy on the top...if it's your first time making lasagna, it's a great basic recipe that you can improvise on - I would add a couple of cans of tomato sauce and some italian seasoning going forward.  Enjoy!

Maybe I was supposed to put it all together and not bake it until the next night. I did bake it, then reheated it the next night in the oven. I had guests over and they said it was very good. It was really way too dry and the top came out hard even though I had it covered with foil. I will try this again to try to get it right. The sauce is delicious!

This was awesome.  Double the sauce and freeze what you don't use for later.  It tastes even better the second time.  Definitely make the night before.  It sliced beautifully.

This is the best lasagna I have ever had! I did increase the sauce portion of the recipe as others have mentioned. I would recommend doing that for anyone who doesn't like dry lasagna.

Excellent lasagna!   I usually make two pans and freeze one for later...it freezes well, and if you slice it before freezing you can take out and re-heat individual servings.   Great recipe.

I was about to embark on my second lasgna from a not so great recipe when I stumbled upon this recipe!  It sounded so good I decided that I would try it.  I am glad I did.  Everything came out great and it was easy to make.  The only thing I had trouble with was pulling the noodles out of the water to dry them!!(i had only used the ready for oven ones before)  I was so impressed!  Everyone loved it and I have no leftovers at all.

Yummy and easy to make.  I made it several hours before a dinner and let it sit in the fridge until it was time to bake.  Turned out great, and I didn't have to stress out too much with preparation right before the dinner.

This was delicious my husband loved it. I actually was in a hurry when I started to make it and put raw hamburger in with the tomatoes and everything and let the entire thing cook on medium for 45 minutes. I was very nervous I had ruined it but it was delicious! My husband gave it two thumbs ups. Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent!  I used sausage and burger together for the meat as someone already suggested.  I also had to replace the ricatta cheese with cottage cheese as I forgot to pick it up.  I added spinich to the cottage cheese mixture and it was really great.    The neighbor boy, who hates EVERYTHING food wise showed up to return my sons coat and said something smells so good... he ended up staying for dinner and he loved it too!  That is a big recommendation as he is the pickiest eater around!

Awesome lasagna.  Instead of sprinkling the parmesan on top, I put extra mozarella and let it brown a bit (the kids prefer the mozarella to parmesan).  It's even better the day after!

This recipe was a big hit at my house. Even at my friends house who got the left overs! I enjoyed it but not sure if it's "the one". I used fresh noodles, which saved time plus I hate dealing with dry ones!(who wants to wait for water to boil???)

I'm always looking for a good lasagna. This was REALLY good, although I think I will add a can of tomato paste next time, the meat sauce was a little thicker than we like.

This was the best lasagna recipie i've ever made.  I took the suggestion of others and did 1/2 lb of italian sausage.  I did not have fresh basil so used 1 tsp of dried.  I also only had one can of diced tomatos and the second can was italian stewed tomatos.  It tasted great!  My husband even said it was the best lasagna he has ever had.  Thanks!

I prepared this the night b4 and let it hang out in my fridge until the next day.  My husband loved it (i used 1 lb of sausage and 1/2 lb of ground turkey) so it came out a bit sweet.  i also used the no-boil noodles, but i think they were kind of dry.  my hubby said they were dry because i used a huge roasting pan instead of a 9x13 dish so all the ingredents were spread thin.  but it's a terrific recipe and i will make it again!  tastes great as a left-over too!

I made this for a dinner party we had for my daughter's birthday.  We had 12 guests and they all raved about this lasagna.  Most were saying it was the best they had ever eaten.  It's very easy also, so don't let the homemade sauce scare you away.  I made mine the morning of the party to let the flavors set in.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a very hearty and substantial meal. I added green peppers along with the onion and garlic.  It tasted very good, but lacked fire and depth.  Perhaps needed some spicy sausage or seasoning such as dry red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper.  I would make this again with modifications to create a deeper level of flavour.  Perhaps with more interesting vegetables such as zuchinni, mushrooms, spinach or whatever else tickkles your fancy.  Great, basic recipe.

Excellent!!  I've made this several times now & it always comes out perfect.  I doubled it for my boyfriend to take to a potluck at work & both pans were gone before he got any!

Awesome!  I took the suggestions of others and used half sausage and half beef.  I also doubled the sauce.  We had sauce leftover which was great another day over pasta.

This is great Lasagne.  I made it and took it to work the next day.  My whole staff gobbled it up (some asking for recipe).  I did not double up on the sauce & it worked out just fine.  I used a couple tips from others & brushed olive oil on noodles & did a 1/3 Italian sausage 2/3 ground beef mixture.  Oh yeah, also threw in an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Very tasty!  Will definatley make again!!

This is the best lasagna I've ever made.  I will be throwing out my old recipe which used jar sauce.  I believe now that a homemade sauce makes all the difference!!!  I made the lasagna the night before and the flavors were great.  A bit time consuming, but worth it in the end.

Superb!  My past attempts at making Lasagna were horrible!  I'd always pick up the frozen kind from the grocery "just in case."  We almost always end up using the "just in case" kind.  My kids loved this!  I have discovered, however, when you reheat it the next day in the microwave to lay a damp papertowel overtop.  This will help keep it moist.  OR heat about 3 inches of water in your dutch oven and put the pieces of lasagna in a round cake pan and steam it.  EXTREMELY MOIST!!!

VERY EASY AND TASTY. MY FAMILY DID NOT LIKE THE ONIONS SO I USED LARGE SLICES INSTEAD OF CHOPPED TO MAKE THEM EASIER TO TAKE OUT.

Go on, girl!   This was a fantastic dish.  I hosted a dinner party for 12 of my co-workers (crazy, I know) and made two pans of this lasagna.  I read some of the reviews and doubled the sauce on both pans and it came out perfect.  I added red wine to the sauce and combined ricotta cheese and cottage cheese for the cheese mixture.  I actually had a little bit left over for some pasta sauce later in the week.

Anyway, my guests raved about it and was a complete success!  As a single man, it was a conquest to prove that I COULD make something that good.  The few left overs were my favorite!!!

All I can say is WOW about this recipe! I've made this several times and it is just fantastic! Best lasagna we've ever had and will never use another recipe again. I don't know what it is about this recipe- maybe the brown sugar? the fresh basil?- but whatever it is it's the best lasagna we've ever had. I like to add a 1/2 cup of red wine to the sauce while it's simmering, by the way.

This is the BEST lasagna I have ever made!  I used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta and I didn't have tomato paste, so I used some homemade canned tomatoe sauce.  The brown sugar really made a difference too.  Definitely a keeper.

After reading other reviews, I doubled the sauce (it makes a ton - I froze what I didn't use on the lasagne).  Ingredient adjustments follow.  I also assembled and refrigerated it overnight before baking.  It was sooooooooo good!  My fiance has been raving to everyone he knows about it!

Overall I was dissatisfied with this recipe.  It really left something to be desired.  It didn't taste very good and I followed the directions exactly.  I guess my tastes differ from others.  I will keep trying to find a good recipe for lasagna.

I made this recipe last night for my family for the first time.  We loved it. Instead of using the Basil, Oregano and Garlic, I cheated and used the canned diced tomatoes with all of that already in there; much quicker than messing with the garlic. I also served garlic bread with the spread recipe I found on this site also, great dinner.

Thought it was tremendously time consuming (next time I will get no boil noodles) but oh my god it was lovely. I doubled the tomato sauce, since that stuff tends to cook down a lot, and refrigerated it overnight, and I ended up being very proud of my first attempt at lasagna ever! Great recipe!!

A delicious, simple recipe similar to the one I use. For a leaner dinner, I recommend subsituting turkey for beef (it's just as good! Even my red-meat-loving man admits it). Also I substitute 1 cup cottage cheese and for the ricotta (mixing together the cottage cheese w. 15 oz. ricotta - adds interesting texture and flavor!)

Very good, but next time I won't sprinkle parmesean over the top until after it comes out of the oven.  It made the top of the lasagna very greasy.

This was my maiden voyage making lasagna.  I used 1/2 lb Italian Sausage for part of the gd. beef.  I also used Italian Spices along with the spices in the recipe.  I substituted one of the cans of diced tomatos for 16 oz jar Prego sauce and used three times the garlic recipe called for.  Next time I will double sauce as it was a little dry.  It went over very well.  Everyone called for seconds.  My picky granddaughters even like it.

I have been trying to duplicate my mother-in-laws' lasagna recipe for years.  I made this last night and my husband declared it a success!  This was really easy to make - just took a little time.  I used half the ground beef and added italian sausage for the rest of the meat and I served extra sauce on the side.  Next time, I would add more ricotta and mozzerella since I like it cheesy!  Overall, delicious!  I will definitely make it again!

This was pretty good.  The original recipe sounded a little too sweet for my liking so I subsituted 1/2 of the beef with italian sausages.  Even though I added more sauce than the recipe called for I would double it next time.  Oh, and I think I'll cut back on the ricotta cheese.  Overall it was pretty good...

Having never made lasagna before, I found this to be pretty easy.  Time-consuming, of course, but fairly easy.  Tasted like a lasagna should, but I would recommend covering with foil when baking.  I put half the recipe in an 8x8 dish to freeze, and baked up the other half last night.  Delicious!

Very nice dish.  I added one 8 oz can of Spaghetti Sauce (after reading the reviews of others).  Also bought the no-boil lasagna noodles which saved time.  Cooked covered (with aluminum foil) for 30 minutes and then uncovered for 10 minutes.  Very nice taste and appearance.  I highly recommend this dish.

I just made this for my boyfriend tonight. I was skeptical because he loves lasagna.  He loved it!  Thanks!!  Made me look good.  However, I did change it a bit.  I made it with 2 lbs of hamburger, added one can of tomatoe sauce, 4 bags of cheeses 2 monzerlla and 2 parmesean (approx. 2 lbs of cheese), and I used Momoulloa advice (05/14/01) , excluding the sausage.  I made this a day in advance and covered it with plastic wrap.  When baking it, I baked it for 30 mins with butter on the foil and baked it uncovered for an additional 20 mins.  Very meaty (what he likes).  This recipe will replace my current recipe!  I'll use this one always!!   Thanks!

Very good but a bit dry. I'll adjust the sauce ingredients next time to make it more moist. My family thought it was great.

Just made this tonight and it was very good.  A lot of work but well worth the effort.  I did make the following variations however which I believe added to the tastiness:  used 3-1 ratio bulk Italian sausage to ground beef, Italian recipe diced tomatoes (with garlic, basil and oregano), added 1/2 cup burgundy wine and 1 small can of mushrooms stems & pieces to sauce and 1 - 10 oz. package thawed & drained frozen chopped spinach (mixed in with cheese/egg mixture). Turned out wonderfully hearty.

I liked this recipe a lot, but I agree it was just a little too dry.  I didn't end up with enough sauce to adequately cover the top, so I may increase the sauce recipe next time, and freeze any that I have left over. It's very similar to a recipe I've been using, but the addition of the brown sugar made a difference that I liked.

Wonderful!!! Everyone said it was the BEST lasagna they had every had. The left-overs are still a hit for hubby. I did add an extra 1/2 can tomato paste & 1/2 cup water - turns out PERFECT this way - Not Dry at ALL. Recommend to Everyone!

Great Recipe!  Served this to my Italian friends and they said it was the best Lasagna they ever ate.  Even e-mailed me after dinner to tell me again.  That is quite a complement since she makes wonderful Italian dishes.  The only change I made was to add part hot Italian sausage as some others suggested.  Also, I made it ahead to let the flavors blend.  I made extra sauce to serve on the side and when it was time to bake it I didn't add the cheese on top.  I did put the tomato sauce on top, covered it with foil and baked it for 60 minutes (since it was cold).  I took off the foil and put on the rest of the cheese.  Put it back in the oven to melt the cheese.  It was wonderful ! No hard noodles! Served it with Antipasto Pasta Salad recipe on this site, but left out the pasta part and added mixed lettuce.  It was a great meal.  Thanks Rosemary

I am 36 and have never made a lasagna because of all the trouble I remember my mom having with the noodles growing up.  This recipe was excellent!  It was a little time consuming but my four yr old enjoyed layering with me.  Family members thought is was delicous.... I agree extra cheese is needed on top to keep noodles moist.

Added majoriam, pasley, and union powder.  Replaced ricotti cheese with organic cottage cheese and 2lbs fresh organic tomatoes instead of canned diced one.  Use only one can of tomato paste.  It's a hit!

I have been disappointed with lasagna recipes, too plain and not satisfying.  This will be my new recipe because it was amazing! The perfect lasagna in my opinion.  The only thing I did extra was put mozerella on top because I love cheese, lol.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I made this for company. Since I don’t eat meat or dairy, I had to rely on others to tell me if it was good. Based on the fact that I didn’t have much left I would say it was a success. I made the following changes. I used another 14 oz can of diced tomatoes as others did. It needed it. I also cut out a TBSP of sugar and left salt out of the cheese mixture. I also doubled the ricotta cheese because it just made sense. I used only 16oz bag of mozzarella cheese which made two perfect layers. I prepared this a day ahead and baked for an hour covered and then uncovered for 30 minutes. Came out great not watery or runny at all.

I added a layer of Zucchini noodles o top of baby spinach leaves in the middle of this recipe. I then topped it all off with plenty mozzarella cheese and a sprinkling of  Italian spices before putting it in the oven. Relatives from all over came as soon as I said "ready." 
Sorry, the only picture I can show is before the oven. Its all gobbled up already and it's not the Thanksgiving day yet.

This is a family staple now. For some time I doubled the ricotta thinking the recipe called for too little, but that now seems too much so back to following this 100% and it's perfection.

My whole family loved it! The only tweaks I made were 1.5 lbs ground beef & 1/2 lbs Italian sausage because that’s what I had in my freezer. I didn’t drain the fat, and I added more basil. I also used a block of Parmesan cheese instead of the bottle grated kind, and whole milk ricotta. And I topped it with mozzarella & fresh Parmesan cheese. I think the sauce needs a bit more flavor, so I’ll probably further tweak it if I make it again!

Rave reviews from my family!  I will definitely be making this one again.  The only thing I changed was to add an additional 15-oz can of tomato sauce, and as a result, an extra 1/2 teaspoon each of dried basil & oregano.  I used dried basil instead of fresh, it's what I had on hand.  I didn't find this dish too salty at all, all of the flavors blended together perfectly, especially since I made it the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight before baking for supper the next day.  From the fridge, I baked it (covered) for 1 hour and then baked it (uncovered) for another 20 minutes.  Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes before serving.  Everyone loved it, even the ones who typically don't like lasagna.  Such a wonderful recipe - next time I would love to double it and store one in the freezer for another day.  Delicious!!

My first attempt at lasagna and it came out so good! I followed the recipe apart from using oven ready noodles. Next time I would add more garlic and a little less brown sugar. I did it covered with foil for 50 minutes then uncovered for 10 more minutes.

Love it! Good taste, good texture, and good appearance. I modified the recipe by mixing half-pint ricotta cheese with half-pint cottage cheese. I will make this recipe again in the future!

I've made this several times now and we've all loved it! After multiple takes, I've figured out what works best for our taste buds.....As a few reviews have mentioned, you really do need more sauce. So I used an extra 14oz can of diced tomatoes (I've been using no salt added-I prefer to control my own salt use). I also have used ground turkey rather than ground beef, but only because it's what we prefer. However I have found that one pound is plenty (and we love a good meaty lasagna)! Last time I made it I even had some extra sauce leftover to use for pasta. I've tried both the recipe stated boil noodles and no boil noodles, and personally I've liked the way it's turned out better with the boil ones. It's a little more work, but it's worth it. Also, I found nine noodles (three layers of three) to be the magic number, as another review said as well. I used fresh basil instead of parsley (we have a parsley allergy in the family). Lastly, I threw in some salt, pepper, dried rosemary, and garlic powder into the sauce before letting it simmer just to give it some extra kick. It's one I'm excited to make now, knowing it's a hit and it's even better as a leftover is always really comforting when you've got picky mouths!

I did make a change, in that I did substituted the canned tomatoes and paste for a spaghetti sauce. (I used Prego traditional) and added fresh mushrooms, sliced and added to the meat mixture. Everything else was the same and prepared the same. I think in the past I must  have cooked my noddles too long. This method was perfect in that they were easy to cut through after cooking in the oven. Be sure to follow advise of letting it set for at least 10 minutes after taking out of the oven. This is a keeper. Thanks so much!

This was the best lasagna I’ve ever had. My heritage is from Trinidad and Tobago I like my food savory with spices so I added to the recipe. I added a whole diced and chopped green bell pepper, 1.5 tablespoons  of Italian seasoning/black pepper/parsley and 2 tablespoons of ketchup and reduced the light brown sugar to 1.5 tablespoons, I increased all the spices to 1.5 tablespoons, 1 whole sweet vidalia onion, 1 can of low sodium diced tomatoes, 2 teaspoons iodized table salt, and 2 jars of pasta sauce (ragu sauté onion/garlic and 4 cheese tomato sauce). You need more sauce for this most definitely. I didn’t think I’d need the 32 oz ricotta so I bought the 15 oz but that was a mistake. You definitely need the 32 oz ricotta cheese. Cover and cooked for 1 hour and left open for 20 mins to finish cooking. I only needed 9 noodles but the middle part tasted so much better than the outer edges because that where it had less of the beef mixture so next time I know not to reduce the sauce so much.

Making it twice now 1st with Italian sausage and 2nd time with ground beef, I really prefer the taste of the Italian sausage. Although the ground beef is still good, the Italian sausage blends with the other flavors so much better. I also tried making fresh and making it ahead of time, with a preference for making it the day of. When I assembled the lasagna the night before, I thought the noodles absorbed way too much of the sauce and ended up drying out the lasagna. I also added a smaller can of the diced tomatoes.

This was delicious! Some things I learned

1) do NOT use oven-ready lasagna noodles! I used it the first time and it sucked up all of my sauce and made it super dry.

2) I would double the recipe for just 1 lasagna. I like my lasagna nice and thick.

Other than that, I just added some mushrooms and used prego sauce instead of the tomato sauce and bits. Delicious!

Made for a large group and everyone loved it. I doubled it and followed other reviewer suggestions to add an extra can of diced tomatoes and tomato paste for more sauce. I also used fewer noodles than it called for.

I have never had homemade lasagna before. Boxed and restaurant only. But this is the best lasagna I have had in my life and will only ever make my own for now on. I did refrigerate overnight and did not pre-cook pasta. It was fabulous!

Easy recipe that was well received by my family (they like simple food). Instead of 1.5 lbs of ground beef, I used 1 lb and added .5 lbs of Italian sausage. I only used 9 lasagna noodles. For me, I prefer more flavor and in the future will tweak to add additional spices.

So, I did not have to make the sauce because I already had my own homemade sauce leftover, (which I took out of the freezer from the week before)!!
Used the rest of the recipe, to the T and this was marvelous, and only took a half hour to put together!!!
Try it, you'll like it!!! simple and easy!!

First time for making home made Lasagna. Usually boxed Lasagna was the norm. My family loved this. I made it alongside our traditional Thanksgiving dinner to add something new to the table. My family truly loved it. This is definitely becoming moms Lasagna recipe. Thank you

This lasagna is excellent! I tweaked the recipe slightly by adding more veggies to the sauce, and instead of just canned tomatoes, I also used Paul Newman's 'Newman's Own' Marinara sauce. I did allow it to sit in fridge for 1 day after I built it, to allow flavors to meld as suggested. This dish is definitely fit to serve to  company or the family.

We liked it but it had a but too much meat for us. And too much ricotta. Did only use 9 lasagne sheets, maybe that contributed to the ratios being off. Also used extra can of tomatoes per other reviews as I did not want dry lasagne.  Very rich meal. One serving and you can't take another bite.

I used sweet italian sausage and ground beef. I should have skipped the brown sugar because of the sweet sausage. Still had a good flavor and pretty easy to make.

My first time making lasagna ever & my picky eater and family loved it! The only modification I made was to use 2lbs of ground meat instead of 1 1/2 and 1 1/2 cans of crushed tomatoes instead of 1 diced can.

The taste was delicious but the texture was runny.  I don't know if it's because I only had 10 noodles (not 12) or if I didn't let it set up long enough.  I did make it the day of and refrigerated it for several hours, and cooked it 1 hour covered and 20 minutes uncovered and then let it set up 10 minutes before serving. I'll make it again, but will have to try other approaches to make it look more appealing.

You will need more than 12 noodles because the noodles are not to size. I cut the noddles after they were par boiled to extend the length.  Also it will require 1 and 1/2 pints of regatta cheese and a pound and half of mozzarella cheese .  I also added a cup of malbec wine 15 minutes while the sauce was simmering uncovered.

I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes. My family loved it! It was the best lasagna I have ever made. It was time consuming but luckily I did make it the night before so all I had to do was pop it in the oven! 

As a side note, I increased the amount by one half and cooked it almost 2 hours.

Makes lasagna that my family loves.
Can be modified by adding sliced black olives and or diced green pepper to the sauce. Also no harm to taste leaving out brown sugar if you want to cut down on sugar.

I do not give a 5 star easily.  This lasagna was amazing. My modifications were just increasing the diced tomatoes because I like a bit more sauce.  Increasing the sauce require that I also increase the basil, salt, oregano and parsley.  All else remained the same.  My family and friends rave about this lasagna.  I have now made it 3 times and it will be my only lasagna recipe.  I also make and put in the fridge.  Bake it the next day and the flavors are even better!

I added an extra can of diced tomatoes, omitted the salt (other than a pinch) and changed the baking time to an hour and a half (especially because I had refrigerated it first and it needed to warm all the way through), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious!  Loved it and will make it again!
Edit-Have made this over and over again, for many guests, too.  Always a hit!  My favorite recipe from All Recipes!

I gave this recipe a shot tonight for my little sister’s birthday party, it was served to my family of 6 + 5 teenage girls, and everyone LOVED it!! This will be my new lasagna recipe from now on. I wanted an outstanding meat sauce so I prepared the sauce early this morning and allowed it to simmer all day long, stirring every half hour. The only changes I made to the sauce were to use ground turkey instead of beef, 2-tsp of dried basil instead of fresh, and I also added 1/4 cup of water as needed so the sauce didn’t get too dry (I probably added close to 2-cups of water throughout the day). I used oven-ready noodles so I skipped the noodle preparation step, but next time I may try regular noodles. In the ricotta mixture, I used dry parmesan and 1/4-cup of fresh parsley instead of dry as I had some on hand. For the mozzarella, I used slices instead of grated for a thicker cheesy layer. For layering: begin with meat sauce on the bottom, then noodles, ricotta mix, mozza slices, meat sauce, repeat. Topped with fresh shaved Grand Padano and dry parmesan. Next time, I will make sure to cover the top layer of noodles with more sauce as some areas were dry/crunchy. Baked in 11x15 pan *this would NOT have fit in a 9x13, in convection oven at 350 for 40-minutes (covered with foil); 20-min uncovered. Amazing.

I would list this recipe as just alright. The sauce was a little sweeter than I would have liked. I recommend if your making it to make extra meat sauce I ran out towards the end.

I'm writing this so I don't forget - soak noodles in hot tap water for a while. (gonna sit in fridge over night anyway). Put non stick spray on bottom of pan, spread cream cheese on noodles, increase spices and lots more garlic. no salt., another can of tomatoes (you can always freeze any left over).  Mushrooms and a good parm cheese.  Use hot Italian sausage instead of hamburger.  Cook an hour, turn off stove and remove foil.  Let sit between 10 minutes to 1/2 hour or so in oven.    Dash of nutmeg & cayanne in ricotta with lots of pepper.    Let's face it ... better quality and fresh herbs make a better lasagna.

So glad I watched the video as I also thought 30 minutes was not time .... this calls for an hour and 20 minutes .... but everything else is spot on , great recipe .... I added organic spinach and mushrooms in the last 15 minutes of simmering stage

I can't believe this recipe hasn't gotten 5 stars from everyone! I have been making this recipe for at least 10 years and it's always a winner. I usually follow the recipe really close except omit the sugar. I have made so many variations like sausage, sausage + ground beef, or vegan crumbles. I have added zucchini, mushrooms, shredded carrots, etc. It always comes out yummy. I have substituted cottage cheese for ricotta. Added more ricotta layer, or more sauce... it really doesn't matter. This is always a winner. It is my go-to when someone is sick and needs a meal delivered to their door. Outstanding recipe.

I've made this recipe OVER five years! It's a family favorite and probably the best dish I make. I make it in large quantities, at least one or two baking dishes at a time. The herbs and spices are spot on in regard to flavor. I recommend a few things:
1. Begin sautéing the onion by itself. Give it a few minutes to soften, then add the hamburger meat. My family has commented in the past that they wished the onion wasn't crunchy, and since I've sautéed the onion first, that eliminates the crunch.

2. I do recommend buying a couple extra cans of petite diced tomatoes. I will typically buy a 50 ounce can plus another 20 ounce can. Two or three cans of tomato paste will do. 

3. I ALWAYS have extra lasagna noodles that I don't need for the 9X12 dish, so if you are smart, conserve some to make a smaller baking dish. Freeze it uncooked, write directions on the dish, and then when you don't feel like cooking one day, pull it out a day early and put in the fridge to thaw, OR put it in the oven at 300 degrees F for about 45 minutes to thaw, then cook it at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, uncovered.

I didn't have any oregano, so I added a little more parsley and it turned out good! I'm inclined to try adding cumin to the ground beef next time.

This Lasagna was delicious, I did make it a day ahead and did not modify the recipe at all other than adding some pasta water to the sauce as it was simmering, it was getting a little too thick.  Since I made it the day before the cooking time needs to be adjusted because is was refrigerated, we baked it for 45 min and then let stand for the 10 minutes, perfect!

My lasagna was on the dry side. The sauce is definitely not enough, tasty but not enough. I don't think I will attempt this recipe again. At least not the way it is written.

I just made this, and it is in the oven as I type.  The preparation was easy enough to me.  The sauce tasted good before layering, and I followed the recipe as written, but added a little bit of spinach that I needed to use up.  Thank you for sharing this!  I will being making again.

I have made this recipe many times, it can use more sauce so adding a 14 oz can of tomatoes or I have used rotel  just to add some heat. It's my go to lasagna recipe.

Made it with my husband (his first lasagna - if your first always have the pan sprayed and saucy so it doesn't burn and stick), used oven ready lasagna noodles, and tomato sauce instead of diced or crushed tomatoes for our daughter.  Was great!  Extras to freeze for fast meals later.

I made the recipe just as written for my grown children. They liked it but commented that the sauce was too sweet. I had debated adding the brown sugar, but wanted to try it just as written. So if you like sweet spaghetti sauces, you may like this. I don't care for the sweetness so I will omit brown sugar next time.

I have made this recipe so many times within the last four years and just finally now getting around to write a review. I follow the recipe exactly for seasoning, however, I only use one can of tomato paste and one can (15oz) of tomato sauce. In addition, I add 1/2 cup of water in the lasagna (I use oven-ready noodles) and cooked for an hour in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees. It comes out perfect every time...

Delicious!!! My husband's response , "I believe that was the best past dish I've ever had!" Then he went back for seconds!! My only  modification was that I used ground venison instead of beef (couldn't tell the difference). And I saved a little bit of the mozzarella for the top!

Added mushrooms. Was going to cook it for 1:30 like comments advise, but after 40 minutes in the oven, it was a little more than perfect! Threw a few shreds of mozzarella on top.

Love this recipe! It calls for beef but I usually use ground turkey and it's just as delicious. The 30 minute baking time is right on, IF you are NOT refrigerating it overnight. I didn't see that comment at the top so I never had that problem. It's one of my family's favorites and I always get asked for the recipe.

This was a hit with my family !

I made a few changes though. I sautéed bacon and garlic in butter first then added the onions and diced seasoning pepper before adding the ground beef. I used Prego Marinara Sauce and tomato paste as I did not have any other sauce. I added some Chilli flakes and canned mushrooms as well to the sauce. This lasagna came out full of flavor. Thank you.

Turned out beautiful. One problem was that I used those lasagna pasta that doesn't need to be pre-cooked. The top came out half done under the cheese, so ill cook the pasta for the top of the lasagna before next time so that it comes out better.

To the sauce I added #2 4oz cans of mushrooms, 1/4 julienne carrot, #1 9oz package of frozen spinach & 1 cup of marinara sauce. BEST lasagna I ever made. Had the combo of veggies I want & meat that my husband insists on.

I used Italian Sausage in favor of ground beef. GB is fine, bit the sausage ramps up the flavor!

This is the second time I've ever made lasagna and it came out Great!! I used Real Ricotta cheese not the Lite. With the real ricotta its some what sweet, so I didn't add the brown sugar figuring what's what it needs to sweeten up the lite ricotta cheese, it is kind of sour I think. That's what I used in my first lasagna a few months ago and it was kind of sour. For the third time I think I'll add a small can of tomato sauce, I like lasagna just a tiny bit juicer! It's Good And Easy!!! Can't wait for left overs tomorrow! ( I'm a retired mechanic, I can fix anything except dinner, I'm working on it.)

It is a good base recipe. The typo for 30 minutes cooking time needs to be fixed as it was raw when removed the first time. Also should be covered by foil during a portion of the baking time as cheese burnt after I stuck it back in to rectify the raw ricotta situation. A bit bland but easy enough to modify. Used only 9 noodles and 2 two layers of cheese mixture as that is all that would fit in my lasagna pan.

A good classic lasagna. Only change was I cooked it for about 45 minutes, not 30 like the recipe says. As well, added about a tsp of red chili flakes to the tomato mixture just for  a bit of extra spice

This was my first attempt at a lasagna and it went well.  I agree that it definitely needs more tomato sauce though.  Mine cooked just fine in 30 minutes, but I made one critical change because of my post-bariatric surgery diet  - I used won ton wrappers instead of lasagna noodles (more tolerable for someone in my situation). I think because of this, the cook time worked out fine for me.

I loved making this lasagna, and following along with the video made this a breeze. I was a little lazy and didn't get all of the greens listed, but the end result was still fantastic. I will be making this again!!

Delicious!!  After reading the reviews I added a can of tomato sauce, doubled the ricotta, used half Italian sausage and half ground beef (I added a little extra meat) and followed the recipe as it was. It was perfect and wouldn't change anything else. Thank you!!

Yum yum yum yum!! I made a mistake however. I read reviews which said "more sauce", I thought they meant more meat sauce, and perhaps they did, I'm not sure, but if you are using oven ready lasagna noodles,  you should also use an extra 14.5 ounce can of sauce on the top of the lasagna too, just the sauce, not the meat sauce, because that top layer really needs more moisture. I did also add an extra 14.5 oz to the meat sauce. Reheating leftovers the top wasn't as undercooked as when it was served fresh, but fresh it was a little undercooked due to lack of moisture. Also I could not cook all of the meat sauce in a large pan, it was overflowing. I ended up transferring it to a pot to finish cooking, and in the future will just brown the meat, onions, and garlic then transfer to a pot with the rest of the ingredients and finish cooking. I also used disposable tin cookware that was nonstick, but if you are going to do this, either use two pans or put a baking sheet under the one and only pick it up by the sheet, as when I removed it from the oven the weight of the lasagna made the pan collapse and I almost lost the whole thing (ended up only losing a noodle but I thought I had honestly lost it all). Aside from all of this, was absolutely delicious. We inhaled it.

This is a wonderful recipe full of flavor and layers of texture!  The only change that I made was using small curd cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese, as my family doesn't care for ricotta. I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was absolutely delicious. It did make a large panful so the one time that I made it I actually cut it in half and froze the one half and used it several weeks later and it tasted just as good as when it was first made. I usually make it when company is coming as it makes plenty with everyone getting a nice sized piece. Oh, I did use whole wheat lasagna only because I have to watch my carbs and sugar. Still delicious!!!

Ricotta makes all the difference! I used to make it with cottage cheese. Never again! This is my go to recipe now and it works well with Gluten free oven ready lasagna Or thin slices of zucchini if you want to reduce the "bad" carbs.  I have also used up my frozen tomatoes from the garden when I've been out of canned diced tomatoes. It's a winner in my books!

First off this recipe is spot on! With the changes the other members advised it came out  near excellent. 

First off you will need an extra 6-12 oz of tomato sauce. If not THE SAUCE WILL DRY OUT as it simmers. Make sure to add it incrementally. I used 6 oz it was fine and not too dry.  Also add an extra 1/2 of every spice except the sugar (the salt, basil, oregano, parsley, onion). I used mined garlic instead of cloves and it came out fine just ration the mined garlic to cloves properly. I forgot to buy onion and substitued with onion powder and it came out fine (i used about 1-3 tablespoons i didnt ration i just poured it in until i got the desired taste i wanted). I found that one ounce of meat and 8oz of mozzarella was sufficient (unless you really like cheese). I used only 8 noodles not 12 so maybe make 10 just in case. The meat was more on the sweet side so maybe add 1 or 1.5 tablespoons of sugar if you want more of a saltier taste .

With the added revisions from other members and tips and hints this recipe is a definite A+ !

Very tasty. I prefer a more saucy Lasagna, so I just added another can of tomatoes. You can easily customize this to your liking when it comes to extras, like peppers, mushrooms, and I use ground turkey. Wonderful flavor!

I  was going to make this recipe verbatim so I got only what it asked of me so I wouldn't end up with ingredients I won't use again, but then I read the reviews stating that it was dry. I didn't feel like going to the store so I just took the 6 oz can of tomato paste that I had used, shook some water around in it, and put it in the meat mixture. It came out moist - not runny or stiff, just in between. I read another review that said the salt was unnecessary because of the cheeses, so I didn't put it in the meat. When it came out, I noticed the lack of salt, and my mother tasted it and could tell immediately that there was no salt in it. Maybe they used a lot more cheese than what was asked for, but my sauce was too sweet for my liking and what I am used to, so I recommend putting in the salt. Other than that it came out pretty good, but I like my lasagna very cheesy and I should have been able to tell from the picture that this is not one of those, so if you like cheese that dangles from a piece you cut, I would get more cheese (maybe one more package). I cut out the parsley and the basil, simply because I forgot the parsley and I wasn't going to pay for the basil if I was only going to use a tablespoon. Did it make a difference? Not that I know of, I mean... It tasted like lasagna with not enough salt. It was still good. I see myself as more of a beginner cook who prides herself whenever she doesn't set off the smoke alarm (which I didn't while cooking this) so I would like

I used this recipe to attempt my very first lasagna and I was happy to have found this AND have read the reviews.  You definitely need more sauce.  I added about 6 oz of leftover prego sauce I had from earlier in the week and the meat/sauce mixture just barely filled the top layer.  Keep in mind you also need about 1 1/2 cook time.  I cooked uncovered for about 30 minutes then covered for the last hour. 

Things I did differently:  I seasoned the ground beef as I cooked it with season salt, black pepper, paprika and a little chili powder; used only three noodles per layer and added about a 1/4 cup more mozzarella.  I imagine the lasagna will be very bland without extra seasonings but this was a good basic recipe and I will keep it for reference.

I used Prego pausta sauce in place of making it from scratch also added extra Meat and used oven ready noodles that required no precooking. This not only made it easy, it also made my taste buds leap for joy

great basic recipe. I used no boil noodles, increased sauce and used 1/2 ground sweet Italian Sausage and 1/2  Lean ground beef. Lots of garlic, fresh Basil.
Cooked one hour 350 covered, 20 minutes uncovered
Delicious.

I added more herbs that we like and an extra can of tomatoes since the sauce looked a little too thick. This is really quite good.

AMAZING restaurant quality flavor!  I made this again a week after the first because it was that good!  My tweaks: Used 1lb Jenni-O Italian seasoned ground turkey and 1/2 lb of Jenni-O Italian sausages chopped, for the meat!  I added the extra 15 oz of diced tomatoes as someone suggested (and got the garlic/onion flavored, but only for the 15 oz can).  I added 12 oz sliced mushrooms directly on top of the noodles (the two layers that then have ricotta on top).  The moisture that cooks out of them also helps keep this moist.  I actually only ended up using about 1/4 C of Parmesan cheese (because I ran out) and none on top.  I use a bit less than the full pound of cheese and buy the 4-Italian variety for one 8 oz pkg, and Mozzarella for the other.  I also used 1/2 an onion (one with about a 3 inch diameter).  As far as baking, I do 1 hour with foil on top, then take it off and add the cheese that belongs on top (so that it doesn't stick to the foil) and bake another 30 minutes.   Because we all raved about this the 1st time, I made it the exact same way the second time and that's my permanent version!

I've never liked lasagna, until I tried this recipe.  Now I have a bunch of them in the freezer, ready to go for an easy, delicious meal.

As per other suggestions, I added extra liquid (homemade tomato juice).  It was needed, and turned out perfect.

Other small changes:
-added extra garlic (personal preference)
-used dried basil (didn't have fresh on hand)
-blended the onion (kids don't like onion pieces)

This is excellent!  I've been making this for over 10 years. I also use the sauce for spaghetti. I make it exactly like the recipe except I always double it and I add a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce. I also add water and cook it on low for 4 to 6 hours. I always make this and put it all together  the day before. It's so much better after it sits in the refrigerator over night and the favors meld together. I even make the sauce the day before and refrigerate overnight if I'm using it for spaghetti.

I used one jar of traditional Prego sauce + one small can of diced petite tomatoes instead of the paste  & 29 oz tomatoes, and cooked the dish covered in foil  for 50 minutes rather than 30....... Delicious!!  Thumbs up from my mom for her birthday dinner!  Even my Italian husband approved!

This also makes a great meat sauce to serve over your favorite pasta! That's how I use the leftover sauce because I do double it for the lasagna. So double the sauce!

Delicious lasagna, my family loved it!!  This recipe has the noodles on the bottom, following these directions caused those noodles to become hard and tough.  When I make this again I will make this with more sauce, really needed more, and layer sauce in the bottom of the pan.

It was amazing! I never liked anyone else's Lasagna at all! But when I made this, everything was Delicious. I will most likely increase spices for the sauce. The Ricotta cheese mixture is the best out there. Will make again!

Fresh basil makes all the difference!! Up the garlic according to taste and this recipe is great!! We use our homemade pasta sauce for this and use as much as we need which is usually more than what's listed. It's excellent without the beef and bushels of spinach and other favourite veggies, zucchini, mushrooms, peppers, Brussels sprouts, layered in place of it!

This was easy and delicious. Next time I will cut back on the sugar and add a little heat, either with a spicy sausage or red pepper flakes.

I doubled this recipe with no problem. Oops; just realized that, in doubling my recipe, the website had me adding a full 1/4 cup brown sugar. I think that's rounding up from 4 T, so I will just measure out 3 out 4 scant T next time if I double.

This is recipe is quite simply delicious and fool proof. I use about a pound of meat ( ground beef or sometimes ground chicken ) delicious either way, I usually bake it in a 10 X 14 X 2" casserole dish using 2 layers of "oven ready noodles" to save time ( 4 noodles per layer ). Lastly I use extra shredded cheese on top. Comes out perfect every time! I bake it covered with foil for 40 mins. then uncovered for another 20 mins.

I love this Lasagna! I've cooked this so many times and my husband and friends love it! The only thing I change is the amount of brown sugar just 1 tablespoon, and add a little of cayenne pepper like 1 1/2 tablespoon to the meat mix that embraces the flavor a lot. Sometimes I add fresh chopped carrots, fresh tomatoes and red bell pepper. I use this same recipe to cook bolognesa too ;)

The meat sauce in this recipe is absolutely delicious. It has the perfect amount of sweetness, with the perfect amount of tomato and meat flavor. I actually make the amount of sauce the recipe calls for and lower the actual lasagna components down to 6 instead of 8 for my smaller family. I still end up with leftovers, and the sauce ratio is perfect, and I actually had some leftover which I saved for another day to put over spaghetti noodles:D Try this recipe, it is amazing!!

This lasagna is the tits!!  3rd time  makings this meal. Over the time have altered it to my gf liking and me. Things I would suggest to change; less beef, then I added jalapeño, nothing wrong with some portablo mushrooms, and spinach. Added cucumbers one time, no so bad. Enjoy!!

Even though the prep was a necessary step, it made the meal even more scrumptious. My wife hates leftovers but had two huge servings the following day! I, however, cut down on the salt and cut back the cheese...not because I don't love these two, (my nickname is Salty and who doesn't like cheese? ) just that too much of anything isn't good. I will definitely make this recipe again. All the best to anyone that attempts this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome lasagna!!! Best I've ever had! Always try to increase sauce recipe! You can never have to much sauce. Always use a whole package of noodles. 6 per layer.

This is a great recipe! I did tweak it to make it different. Instead of a layer of 4 noodles, I used three layered three times. I also mixed in shredded sharp cheese with the mozz. Next time I will use marinara sauce instead of the tomato paste, the sauce came out very thick and I hate to keep using the water from the noodles to make it thinner. Turned out great though :) I also only baked for 45 minutes then 20 minutes without foil. (Place a baking sheet underneath dish, tends to leak!)

I made the lasagna last night. It was just perfect for a lazy Sunday night dinner. I did change the mix of eggs and ricotta with beschamel which basically is mixed of milk, flour and butter. It was delicious and defenitely worth the second round ??

I made it the way it told me too, and it was a little dry so I added a little more ricotta so that it could stay moist.

I used sauce from a jar x 2 - basil and tomato, took out: 
2 tablespoons brown sugar 
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
1 (29 ounce) can diced tomatoes 
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
used 2 15 oz containers of ricotta but it was way too much, 1 15 oz container is plenty.
I used 1/2 lb sausage & 1/2 lb ground beef
with all my changes it was great but way too salty. next time I will not add the 1 tsp salt to cheese

Next time I will add more sauce. It could have used more as I made it exactly as stated.  Even needing more sauce it was the best Lasagna I've ever made.

I've made a few different lasagna recipes and this is the one I'll stick with. The ingredients are simple and it's the BEST sauce I've ever made, and I've made homemade sauce many times but never with brown sugar. I had a feeling the sauce would be dry with so much paste and no water, so I added a half a can of tomato sauce and three ladles full of the starch water from noodles and 1 pound of lean burger. It wasn't dry, but it wasn't enough. Next time I will double sauce ingredients like most other reviewers suggested (I should have read them before I made it). Overall this is an excellent recipe.

Great recipe. Will use it again. Lasagna came out great. Everybody raved about it. Looked like it was drying out after the first 15 minutes in the oven so I covered the pan with aluminum foil, and I think the foil saved it.

This was first time making lasagna for my husband and he loved it! The only changes I made were I added a pound of sausage (my husband likes his food meaty) and I added some sharp cheddar cheese for color and kick to the top layer. I'll definitely make this again.

The sauce was great, but I didn't have enough to cover my noodles well. Also starting with noodles on the bottom of the pan made it stick slightly even in my nonstick pan.

Takes a little bit more time to make than I'd like, but very good.  My kids love Stouffer's lasagna, but it's so salty and full of preservatives.  This lasagna tasted similar, so they loved it, but I could tell it was definitely better for everyone.    I'd love to make more to freeze and pull when needed.  Yum!!

Very good! I did add shredded zucchini to the sauce for a little boost of nutrition (plus my garden is spitting them out like crazy!). I did find it a little heavy on the ricotta/egg mixture, so I would probably use less next time. Thanks! :)

EDIT: This was our second time making this recipe and were eager to try some of our previous suggestions. We used around 1 pound of beef and found that to be a good amount. We added the cup of mushrooms to the onion/garlic mix again as well as 2 large shredded carrots and 1 cup chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture. We left out the salt and found it to be perfect. We put a thin layer of beef mixture on the bottom of the dish before the pasta as it wouldn't cook (oven-ready) without it, and used 3 lengthwise and another broken into 3 small pieces to extend to the end of the dish. It worked out really well! It worked out so well I will make it the same way next time, too! 

This recipe is very good, it was our first time making lasagna and we were very happy with the results!   We used just over a pound of beef and we both agreed it was a little too much. We also added just over a cup of chopped mushrooms (to the onions, garlic and beef), and a cup of spinach to the ricotta mixture. We used approx. 2 cups of shredded mozzarella (to cut costs and our waistlines) and oven-ready lasagna noodles. We found it too salty, and will omit the additional salt as the cheese and tomato paste is salty on its own. We baked the dish for 45 minutes, but could have used 50 minutes. The flavours really meld well together and it is even better the following day! Next time I would like to add some more veggies - perhaps peppers and shredded carrots.

I have never made lasagna before but this turned out GREAT. I used more tomatoes so it wouldn't be dry. I also suggest to boil the lasagna noodles just enough to soften. If you boil them too long they will tear. It was really, really good.

wonderful, easy, turns out great.  I added mild italian sausage with the ground beef and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, just for moisture.  It was a hit.  Thank you.

This lasagna was a huge hit at my husband's birthday party. Previous reviewers are right about cook time; mine took an hour covered plus 15 minutes uncovered. I thought the sauce quantity was just right, but next time I'd make a little extra just in case. I added red pepper flakes for kick. The one thing I didn't like was the brown sugar, which made the sauce sweet (obviously). If you like sweet sauce, it's fine, but I don't. If you don't like sweet, eliminate the sugar. Otherwise, recipe turned out AMAZING!

Made this for our neighbor's family & it got rave reviews.    Here are our changes:  - Dried Italian Herbs (Penzey's) instead of Fresh Basil - One Small Can Diced Tomatoes AND Fresh Diced Tomatoes to equal equivalent canned - Pasta Sauce instead of Tomato Paste - No Boil Lasagna Noodles with Extra Water to compensate - Half Low-Fat Cottage Cheese and Half Ricotta Cheese to equal equivalent Ricotta  - Cook 20 minutes uncovered then...- Cook one hour covered with foil to prevent edges from burning Cook AT LEAST 90 minutes

I've tried lots and lots of lasagnas, but my husband has NEVER went on and on and on about how deliciouse this one was.  I used Aylmers roasted garlic diced tomatoes and fresh whole wheat pasta noodles to make it easier.  I doubled the recipe and I'm so happy I got to freeze one.  This is the only lasagna recipe I will use from now on! Thanks, Ethelmertz!

Great classic recipe for lasagna. I added just a bit less brown sugar as I don't really like sweet sauces. Used italian seasoning rather than dried basil, tasted great. I added about 2 cups of water to the tomato paste and diced tomato.

This is one of our family's all time favorite meals.  This was our 4th year serving it to our son's soccer team and the boys always rave about it.  The only changes I make: 1 pound ground chuck and a half pound of pork sausage, and always use no-bake noodles.

No matter who I make it for, they all scarf it right down.  I add additional herbs to my liking, but otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly.  A quote from a friend who ate a piece of the lasagna:

"i went to get another bite and realized i had finished it. and it literally felt like the saddest moment of my life"

I've made the recipe serveral times now with the addition of fresh mushrooms.  I also added spinach to the ricotta.  Just make sure you squeeze out the excess water before mixing it with the ricotta.  This is a keeper.

This is a fantastic recipe!  My husband even said that it was BETTER than his mom's (which is a huge compliment, she's a great cook).  I do add a little more cheese than it calls for though.

My friend brought me this after I had a baby and my family had to have the recipe.  This is very good and I can be picky with lasagna.  I like a lot of sauce and cheese and this recipe has it.  I used 2 lbs of hamburger so I used about a cup of jarred sauce to make up for it.  I also used the no-boil lasagna noodles because I hate to boil the regular kind.  It is a little time consuming to make but well worth it.  Next time I might use sausage instead to give it a different twist.

very good basic recipe!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and also added cream cheese, about 3 ounces.  I do think this added a nice touch, but I think it would've been just as good without.  It definitely added some calories and fat, but this recipe may be modified to become at least lower-calorie if not low calorie.

I have never made lasagna before and my first attempt with this recipe turned out great! I have 3 roomates who devoured it all by lunch the next day. The sauce was thick and delicious.. I really hate runny lasagna.  I think next time Im going to double the sauce (as I didnt have enough for the top) & play around with the ricotta mixture.

I thought this was good and very easy. My family loved it. I thought it would have had a bit better taste with 1/2 hamburger 1/2 italian sausage. I also did used crushed tomatoes instead of canned but did everything else exactly. Next time I will also try cottage cheese instead of Ricotta cheese.

This came out very dry, and I don't believe there is enough meat, or cheese filling to actually cover the dish. I would increase the liquid, and up the amount of beef, and cheese mixture.

I made it as-is and loved it. Hubby did not.  We figured out it was the ricotta cheese, so I halved the amount and replaced it with mozzerella. Plus I have to puree the tomatoes so there are no chunks, but he loved it the second time!

Wonderful recipe.  My husband loved it, he even had his picky bandmates over and they finished off an entire pan.  I'm keeping this one for regular use.

A very good, basic sauce.  As others suggested, I only used 1/2 lbs. hamburger, and I added a splash of red wine.  Used 1 tbls. dried basil as I did not have fresh.  Also added a 14 oz can of tomatoes, and only used one can of tomato paste.  Made no changes to sugar/salt amounts.  It turned out great!

I make this at least once a month. My family absolutely loves it. I use canned spaghetti sauce though to save time. The recipe in itself takes a while to make, but it is well worth it. I can honestly say that the leftovers are the best part!!

This lasagna recipe isn't an instant pre-made sauce lasagna, but the taste and health benefits are WELL WORTH IT! I have subsituted the brown sugar for 2 tablespoons all natural honey and gotten the same effect. For my husband and I, this recipe makes a huge amount, so I like to put it into two smaller baking dishes. I bake one to eat then and freeze one for later use. This method also makes a good "homemade yet quick lasagna" gift for a friend who has just had a baby or otherwise can't cook. They'll love you for it!

Made this over the weekend for a group of friends.  They LOVED it.  I was a little skeptical when I was putting it together, since the ricotta mixture was a little runny, but it baked perfectly!  I added alot more garlic and herbs to the sauce.  Next time, I'll make more sauce for preference.  Yummy flavors!

This was the best lasagna I ever made! After letting the sauce simmer for 45 mins. I "pureed" it in my food processor, because my family doesn't like the sauce too chunky. I plan on using this sauce for all my pasta dishes from now on!

What can I say that everyone else has not already said...this is a wonderful Lasagna!!  It does take some time to make, but way worth it! The only change I make is using 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage.

The sauce is excellent.  I am now using it in all my pasta dishes.  The lasagna was not good.  It was turned out dry and something horrible happened to the noodles.  They were very chewy.  I guess I did something wrong, I just don't know what!

Great lasagna!  I wanted a lasagna where I didn't use bottled tomato sauce and this was it!  I DID double the sauce because I like my lasagna "saucy!"  Tasted even better over the next two days!

What I like about this recipe is that it is almost impossible to mess up.  I used 9 noodles and an extra 6 oz can of tomato paste like others recommended.  I cooked it 20 minutes uncovered and 1 hour covered like one person mentioned, but I think it was a little overcooked.  Next time I may cook it covered about 50 minutes.  Even though it looked a little overcooked, it still tasted great!

This recipe is GREAT!!! Made a giant batch of it for large group (30+) people. It was a great success. Next time I think I'll use a little less brown sugar. It was a bit sweet.

Best lasagna ever!  Only thing I changed was I added extra garlic... add salad and bread and you have one terrific meal!

not nice! in was looking for a simpler version of the traditional lasagne but this was way too salty, i could smell the salt when i served it up, i couldnt even persuade my daughters to eat it!!will stick to good old delia smiths!!! and no more cutting corners on the classic bechamel!

Really good lasagna. I used the 1/2 lb as spicy sausage (had some I needed to use up) and added a 6 oz can tomato sauce as others had commented this recipe was a little dry. It turned out perfect! It was not too runny and definitely not dry either. You could really taste the cheeses in this recipe as well.

I've tried this recipe twice and it was excellent both times.  I did come up short on sauce the first time but the second time (having learned from the first time) I was able to divide the sauce up perfectly.  I also cooked the sauce a little longer.  And as for flavor it was delicious!!!

This is great!  I usually add some canned tomato sauce to the sauce, and I leave the salt out of the cheese mixture.  My family loves this sauce recipe so much that I will make a great big batch for spaghetti sauce, and then I freeze the leftovers in small containers for future use.

I loved this recipe, but made some of my own modifications.  I used 4 cloves of garlic, part skim ricotta cheese and provolone cheese instead of mozzarella for more flavor.  For being my first time in making lasagna, it turned out excellent!!!!  Happy cooking!!

This was very good to me. My kids did not like all the tomatoes. So next time I'll use less. There was not enough cheese for us. So I'll use more cheese next time.  I used hot Italian sausage and ground beef which was a good combination. I also used just a little cayenne pepper to give it an extra kick.

This is the absolute best lasagna I have ever had. That's the same response I've gotten from every person that I've made it for so far. It isn't hard or painstaking to make either, which is always a good thing! Thanks so much for this recipe!

A great meaty lasagna just the way it is.  I like a little more sauce and have mixed it up as follows:  3/4 lb lean beef, 3/4 lb italian sausage, 2 cans of diced tomatoes (at least one with added garlic, oregano and basil to adjust for extra tomatoes) one small can of tomato sauce, one can of tomato paste.

I made this lasagna for my daughter’s birthday party and received the best compliments!  I make lasagna quite a bit but this was a great recipe!  I did add some tomato sauce to the meat sauce and I doubled the cheese (we are from Wisconsin).  I will use this recipe again.  Thank you.

This was the best lasagna recipe we have ever tried so far.  Even my hubby who dislikes lasagna enjoyed it.  It had a great flavor and a good balance of sauce, cheese and noodles.  Will definitely make again.

Tastes like homemade lasagna is supposed to.  I substituted 1/2 pound of hot italian sausage for part of the ground beef.  It was still a little mellow for my tastes, so next time I'll substitute more.  Made it for family dinner night, and everyone loved it and ate all leftovers.

An EXCELLENT lasagna recipe. I made a few minor changes to the recipe, but overall I was very pleased with the result. I used extra lean ground turkey and I added chopped spinage to one of the layers. There was sufficient sauce for the lasagna and my boyfriend loved the recipe. This recipe is a definite keeper and I will be adding this recipe to my dinner schedule every month or so.

This was just OK. I thought the meat mixture could have done with some more flavour (like red wine & a little chilli) and I much prefer lasagne with a béchamel sauce rather than the ricotta mixture.

This was easy, good and we had leftovers to freeze.  I made the sauce in the slow cooker and let it go for a few hours.

This is an excellent dish. I did add one small can of tomato sauce with the diced tomatoes and tomato paste.  I also made the lasagna in advance as was suggested.

I really loved the taste of this lasagna.  I mistakenly bought crushed tomatoes to use though.  I also put 3 pounds of mixed lean hamburger, and ground sausage in it.  I put a can of tomato sauce it it too.  I always use cheddar cheese because I love it so much.  It turned out great, but it probably would have if I used the exact recipe too.

Delicious lasagna with great potential - I only gave it four stars because there are a few things that need fixing.  I made this w/o meat, and thought that would maybe solve the dryness problem that other reviewers mentioned, but it didn't.  Next time I'll add more tomato.  Also, I cooked it for only 50 minutes at 375, but the edges and bottom still got burnt.  I added more oregano, basil, and garlic than called for, and only used 1 Tbsp brown sugar, and everyone agreed the sauce was perfect. Will definitely be trying this again.

This recipe is the best I have ever found and super easy.  My husband (self-proclaimed lasgna expert) loves it.  I do omit the sugar (I rarely add sugar to tomato recipes) and I use Barilla oven ready noodles.  Perfect!

Tasty. I followed recipe exactly except I used little more beef and sprinkled mozzarella also on top of dish. I agree with others that it is kind of sweeter. Next time I will still use brown sugar but put more spices in as hot sauce and black pepper to make nice spicy and sweet flavor combination. My hubby wants also jalapenos peppers.

This is the BEST lasagne recipe.  The only substitutions I make are 1/2 lb. of ground sausage in place of 1/2 lb. of the ground beef and I use the "no boil" lasagne noodles so as to cut down on the prep time.  This comes out so delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is our favorite lasagna recipe.  We make it exactly as the recipe states with no changes.  It does taste better if you reheat & eat it the day after you make it.

Delicious, made it for the first time with company over it was great.  I followed the other suggestions by using cottage cheese instead of the ricotta cheese mixture and opted out on the last 1/2 tsp of salt.  Tasted perfect.
But be sure to cook immediately or freeze afterwards.  The cottage cheese softens up the pasta and makes it turn mushy, but tastes great.
Highly recommend.  YUMMY!!

Very good.  I always use the no-boil lasagna noodles that are available which makes lasagna assembly so quick and easy. My favorite lasagna tip is to use some of the ricotta mixture as your top layer instead of noodles on top.  That way you avoid having any dry edges on the pasta. Then you can top that with a little additional sauce and parmesan.  Try adding a half cup of red wine to the sauce too.

Wonderful lasagna.  I usually make one which takes more time, using a cheese sauce, but this one was easier and equally good!  I also added more sauce, a marinara sauce, the refrigerated kind.  My husband is Italian and raved about it!

I gave this recipe 5 stars, but did make slight changes to it.  I doubled the sauce recipe (2 lbs of beef was plenty) and added a half can of medium tomatoe sauce.  I only used 1 egg insted of 2, and used 1 1/2 pints of ricotta cheese insted of 1 pint.  Oh, and i topped it all off with 1 cup of shredded mild chedder cheese.  It was sooooooo good.

Bland.  Even when following directions to the letter...the pan boiled over.  Poor cooking time directions, took over 1hr 1/2 to heat the center.  The idea is good it just needs more ingredients to spice it up and a bigger pan.

Everything I make seems to be 5 stars!  I used Muellers reduced carb lasagna noodles, it only took 9, not 12. I also doubled the sauce and the cheese as previously recommended.  I put a liitle wine in my sauce and left out the sugar.  Yum!

My whole family liked this recipe but it was a little dry.  I prefer a little but more sauce but all in all it was good.  It was even better the next day however.

very good sauce, however not enough
cheese, it was a little dry, next time
I will add more ricotta cheese. I also
spiced it up a bit by adding a few
pepper flakes.

The sauce was too sweet for us.  Next time I would reduce or completely cut out the brown sugar.

I liked this recipe, but I have to agree with a couple of the previous reviewers.  It was a little dry.  So, the second time I made it, I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce.  I also doubled the ricotta cheese mixture.  Yum!!

This was my first time making lasagna and though it was very time consuming, it was well worth it! The sauce definitely needs more tomato sauce. I added one small can but it still came out a bit dry. One large can of sauce along with the diced tomatoes and paste should make for a perfect lasagna! Also, uhh....make sure the lasagna noodles are well done when you boil them! Some of my noodles weren't and wound up being a little crunchy/chewy in the lasagna. :( My mistake though! Great recipe...a keeper.

Excellent, simple lasagna. We found it to be a little sweet and next time will probably double the garlic and cut out the brown sugar.

Very good but with changes. I thought that the original recipe was a bit dry. Reduced the brown sugar to 1 TBS, used petite diced tomatoes, added a can of tomato sauce and another can of tomato paste. Also added parmesan cheese. We can't ever have enough cheese!

This was so yummy!  I did make it the night before so the flavors could meld.  I also used ground white turkey breast in place of the ground beef and it turned out great.

Yummy! If you like cheese, you'll love this recipe.  This was my first lasagna and I had to double it because I was cooking for 7.  I still have an entire tray left.  This lasagna is piled so high and is filled so much that a piece is a meal in itself.  I used 2 lbs ground beef and 1 pound Italian sausage (b/c it was doubled, the sausage added amazing flavor. It took a while to put together and finally have it ready to put into the oven but it was so worth it when it was done.  Everyone loved it and my husband is excited because he gets all the left overs.

A good basic recipe, but just basic.  Needs to be tweaked, imho, quite a bit. It does freeze well, and might be great for those who are not fond of lots of garlic and other spices/herbs.

This is a great recipe but I switched things up a bit. I made my own sauce with tomato paste, diced tomato, onion and garlic. I substituted fresh mushrooms and spinach for the 2 boxes of frozen spinach. Also, I used sliced asiago for the last cheese layer because I'd run out of the mix that the recipe calls for. It was seriously good stuff.

I fixed this for a dinner party last night and everyone raved about it! I had to pass out the recipe. The only thing I did differently was add a can of tomato sauce to the ingredients to make it saucier. Great recipe!

Great recipe!  I will definitely be making this again.  I did, however, make the following modifications:  Used only 1lb ground beef, 1 tbsp brown sugar, and less salt in the sauce.  Next time I would also use a jar of tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes to make it a little saucier.  Might try cottage cheese instead of ricotta next time also, just for a change.  Otherwise, this recipe was a hit!

Lots of work, but worth it.  Good with spinach added to the sauce.

EXCELLENT!  My husband made it w/o my help too!  He used no boil noodles, an extra 12oz can of tomato sauce, ground turkey, 1/2 the brown sugar, and 1/2 the salt.  Delicious!  We'll be making 4 trays of it for my daughter's 1st birthday party!

This was very yummy! And really pretty easy to prepare. I used no boil lasagna noodles so I did cover the casserole with foil to bake for an hour. The family loved it!

This was the easiest lasagna I have ever made and it was delicious!  I added a couple extra cans of 45 oz. tomato sauce instead of the dices tomaotoes since I had those on hand.  I used this new recipe on guests and everyone loved it.  I will use this recipe again.

This lasagna was extremely good, but me and my guests found it a little too meaty.  Not enough pasta to taste. 
The next time I made this, I added a layer of lasagna noodle in between the ricotta mixture and the sauce.  You may need a bigger pan.

Great recipe, super rich but that may be the way I made it.  I used sausage instead of beef, added red chili peppers, olives, a can of tomato sauce and provolone cheese to the layers as well as doubling up on the mozz and parm.  If you like cheese and spice, try this!!!

This was the best!!! Changes I made is used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, layered the bottom with meat sauce, and topped it off with lots of mozza and fresh parmesan,(using fresh parmesan was worth it)..I even had to share with the neighbors and surprised them with a warm dish..Very simple to prepare, and tastes even better the next day! Thanks Rosemary!

I love this recipe.  It has all the hearty ingredients may family loves - lots of meat and chunky tomatoes.  I often use this sauce recipe for my spaghetti.  We will sometimes add sauteed green peppers and mushrooms to give the lasagna a little added texture.  Great recipe - can't go wrong!

My step-daughter asked for lasagna for her special meal before returning to college.  It was very satisfying to have her, my husband and a guest ask for seconds of this dish since it was my first attempt at making lasagna from scratch.  In fact, our guest asked if we were going to start serving dinner at our bed and breakfast.  If I can develop a menu with more recipes like this I will definitely consider it!

Yummy! Hehe, I cheated - I found I didn't have the tomato paste, or a large can of diced tomatoes. So, I tossed in the small can of diced tomatoes and a jar of Ragu. Still turned out very good. :)

Sauce had good flavor.  I'm glad I reviewed other ratings which suggested doubling the cans of tomatoes, cheese mixture, and cheese.  It made it just right! I also covered the dish for 50 minutes and uncovered for 10 minutes.  Will keep this receipe and make again.  Thanks Rosemary

I can't give this 5 stars because I changed the recipe, but the sauce was very good.  I could tell by the amounts that it would be too dry, so I added more tomatoes to the sauce (crushed...40 approx. 40oz), and I added another pint of ricotta to the mixture.  I also used much more mozzarella.  The lasagna came out beautifully and the taste is definately a keeper.  I think the brown sugar to the sauce is a nice addition.

This is an excellent traditional lasagna recipe. I did have to add a little tomato sauce to the meat sauce because it seemed a little dry.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes as well.  I agree that more ricotta is needed, but my husband LOVED this, I will be making it again!

Good basic recipe - nothing really to rave about, but can be dressed up with improvements.  I added an extra container of ricotta and chopped spinach.  I really think the extra ricotta cheese is needed in this recipe.

Over all it was good, it turned out too dry through.  I suggest covering during the simmering part.  I added extra tomato sauce and cheese at the end to put on top.  I suggest adding a bit of mozerella on the top.  It needs to be baked for about an hour and covered the entire time or else it would get too dry!

This recipe turned out great even though I had never made lasagna before.  I added a little extra cheese to the top and it worked out great.  (I really liked it and I don't like Italian food)

This was a nice dish, but I would have liked a little more zing and flavor.  But then, I guess that is why it's called American lasagna:-)

I think it could use a bit more flavor..maybe more garlic and oregano but otherwise, everyone loved it! (Not for the 'quick and easy meal' crowd!)

Great tasting Lasagna! 
I love the sauce and thought the brown sugar gave it a nice flavor.
I used no boil noodles and it was fine, plus it helped cut some time down.

My husband said it needed more liquid so I plan to add more canned tomatoes next time. I used two, but I think I may need to use 3-4.

Overall, a fantastic recipe.

Thank you!

This was a good lasagna recipe.  I followed some of the online recommendations by adding italian sausage in the place of some of the ground beef for added flavor and added an additional can of chopped tomatoes to make more sauce.  I also used chopped fresh parsley in place of the dried.  Here's my feeling on the sauce issue...I don't think that there is as much of an issue with there not being enough sauce but the sauce being too "chunky" (dry) verses more of a "puree".  I plan on making this again but I'm going to adjust the quantity of the chopped tomatoes to the tomato sauce and paste.

Soft and creamy. I added more garlic and spices, and added some mushrooms, too. Very basic, but will definitly become one of my favourite lasagna recipes!

I enjoy making this regularly for all of my single buddies. I like to make it with half beef and half pork sausage, but my wife just likes it with beef. Either way, the recipe is pretty straight-forward, and my buddies think I'm one of the best cooks around.

This was pretty good. I omitted the brown sugar, I don't know, it kind of scared me, made me think the sauce might be sweet (especially after looking at the reviews of others). Other than that, this was great! A keeper! Thanks, Rosemary!

VERY delicious.  I usually use groud turkey and I add about a 1/2 of garam masala to the meat mixture.  Making it the day before really does intensify the flavors.  I also buy the no boil lasagna noodles, which makes for even more efficient meal preparation.

I made this receipe yesterday and it was a hit.  Just revised some things (i.e. lessen the salt in the sauce mixture to a tsp. instead of 1 1/2 tsp.) and added a few ingredients in it (i.e. 2 cups of chopped spinach in the ricotta mixture).

Great recipe.  I have made this twice and it has been a hit both times.  Altough it is a little time consuming, it is well worth it.  I make it the night before and then cook it the next day.  The only thing I would change is to make more of the ricotta/parmeson/egg mixture, it didn't make enough to cover the lasanga twice.  Thanks Rosemary!

This is excellent!  I have finally found THE lasagna recipe.  I have tried many before but this is the best.  I did make a few minor changes.  Instead of brown sugar, I used white sugar and I doubled the sauce recipe.  Also, I used 1 lb. of grd. beef and 1 lb. of italian sausage.  I also added about 3/4 t. of crushed red pepper to the sauce and used 24 oz. of ricotta with 1 extra egg.  This is a fabulous recipe!  Thanks so much!

Very good!  I will add my voice to all the other cooks who loved this recipe.  3 words, no boil noodles!!! Double the sauce and add more cheese as well.

I used italian sausage instead of ground beef and added some mushrooms.  It has gotten rave reviews!  I will certainly make it again.

Let me say that I have never been a big fan of those frozen lasagnas. My husband always picks them up from time to time & I haven't found 1 yet that I wanted to pick up again. Anyway, I will be adding this recipe to my permanent rotation. It was delicious, my husband & 21 month old son loved it, & I have the satisfaction of saying, "It's homemade!" The 1st time I make something I try not to stray to far from the recipe but I did add some mushrooms, other than that I followed it to a tee. It also made a lot, the next time we have our parents over I will consider making this. Yum, Yum!! Thanks Rosemary!!

Wonderful. My husband loved this. He said my usual lasagna is good but this was better. He asked that next time I make lasagna, to make it this way. Absolutely easy and wonderful. I too used the no boil noodles but other than that, did everything the same. It was great!

YUMMY!!  I'm a vegetarian and left out the meat. This was not lacking anything!  Sooo good.  Mine did overflow a bit so I'd probably reduce all the ingredients just a tad.  GREAT RECIPE!

What an amazing lasagna!! Cooked it for new year's eve, and it was amazing! I managed to change the recipe a bit: more meaty (2lbs instead of 1-12) and added 2 diced peppers (red and green) to the sauce. YUMMMM!!!!

Excellent lasagna!  I combined sausage with the ground beef for an extra flavor zing and used no-boil noodles.  As always with lasagna, it was even better the second day.

Followed this recipe to a 'T' but hubby still found it mediocre.  4 year old wouldn't touch it.  I think it was kinda' dry, but even making extra sauce to pour on top didn't help.

This is an excellent recipe. Because my baking dish was a different size, I eyeballed the amount of lasagne noodles I would need and made that amount. I also had Klopse, a german hamburger patty with onion and bread cooked in already left-over in the fridge, so I was able to skip a major step! This would be a great way to use up leftover hamburgers. The ingredients were in just the right proportions for me. A little hot sauce could be served on the side for those who prefer some more zing; I like Frank's Red Hot, but go with your imagination. An excellent and not-too-ardurous recipe.

Great Recipe! The only thing I would do differently would be to add more tomato paste. The current recipe is great for meat lovers but the sauce is just a little to dry.

Oh wow! Taking the time to make the sauce and letting it sit overnight is well worth it. I loved this so much. I used half sausage and half ground beef, and added a small can of tomato sauce. I used the amount of sugar it called for because I love sweet sauce. I will definitely make this again!

I really liked it, my husband thought it was ok.  I used flavored stewed tomatoes (huntz garlic) and added a can of water to the sauce.  There wasn't enough without the water.

Very good, proportions are right, and there are no surprises - tastes just as a lasagna should.  You should note, however, that the prep time can be a bit longer than 30 mins...

The lasagna was pretty good, but somehow, I felt that it was a bit blander than the reviews said it would be, in spite of my having prepared it the night before.  That said, it was still very good and certainly is a great all-American lasagna recipe.

Really tasty but a little too thick and cheesy for me, if that's possible. More vegetables would by nice but otherwise great.

i think for me, it was a bit too meaty.  also i use ground turkey instead of beef.  lightens up the whole dish!  but i do like this recipe a lot.

I used cajun seasoning here and there thanks to my taste buds and the other reviews.  I added some red wine to the sauce.  I put some kraft mexican cheese on top, and added a little italian seasoning to the sauce.

It was great guide recipe.

This was definitely very good (with the recipe changes as noted throughout the reviews), but didn't have as much flavor as we like.  It cut easily and received many compliments, though!  I will definitely make again, but it wasn't a  stand-out.

This was a fine recipe for Lasagna but my family didn't care for the chunks of tomatoes provided by using diced tomatoes.  Seasonings were good.  With so many good lasagna recipes that do not require boiling the noodles (no boil-style noodles or not) it seemed like more work than my schedule allows.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I thought this was very good, except that it was a little bland for my taste.  I suggest adding a little more onion and spice for more flavor.

I had never made Lasagna before and decided to try this one since it had such rave reviews. I put my own spin on ingredients such as the diced tomatoes and mozzarella cheese by using seasoned diced tomatoes and a cheese mixture that included but was not limited to mozzarella. I had to pat my own self on the back considering this was my first time making lasagna. Thank you for a great recipe.

I thought this recipe was very good.  It was not very difficult but was time consuming as Lasagna always is.  Although I thought this Lasagna was very good, I didhn't think it seperated itself from the same ol same ol.  If you want to make a good lasagna, this recipe will do.

Very rarely does my husband request a specific recipe.  I made this recipe once a few weeks ago and my husband requested it again for his FATHER'S DAY MEAL.  The sauce was so easy to make.  I added a bit more brown sugar and pepper to fit my family's tastes. As noted in the previous reviews, I made extra sauce and just doubled all of the spices.  The lasagna has a great taste.  I would truly recommend it to anyone!

This is a great lasagna that my family loves.  Lasagna always seems to be a big job so I have to admit I sometimes save time and use Prego sauce but the cheese mixture and directions are right-on!  I always cook one and freeze one.  Freezes well.

This is a great recipe that produces the perfect consistency.  When you slice this lasagna there is no run off of juices, just perfect layers.  For a nice variation I add sweet italian sausage.  Try using no-cook lasagna noodles.  They are perfect for this dish and really save on the prep time!

The meat sauce was good but the recipe has too much cheese. Next time I'll use milk sauce instead of ricotta cheese. Using less salt won't harm either.

Great recipe. Loved the texture because it was not runny it was perfect, think the 'homemade' sauce was the key to that. My guests loved it and it was gone fast. I Thought the sauce was not going to be enough because it was so thick but it was enough. It's in my box.

What a great recipe, I started the meat mixture in the morning and put it in the slow cooker. When I got home I put the noodles on and mixed the rest of the ingredients. This was very tasty and while the dish was cooling I put the garlic bread in. Oooh its so good!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very Tasty. I omitted the Basil, Diced Tomato and Tomato paste. Instead used 29 oz. jar of Spagetti Sauce and I wished a used a larger jar, cause it could of used a little more sauce.  Instead of Dryed Parsley I used fresh Parsley(much better).
Overall it was Great and Everyone loved it.

This lasagna is certainly worth the time and effort.  I have made it for guests a number of times and it always impresses.  Recently, I added 1 lb mushrooms sliced to the onions and meat mixture and it was superb.  This recipe has always gotten me many compliments from company!

This was outstanding lasagna!!  It was more involved than my usual lasagna (I cheat and use canned sauce), but I'm glad I took the extra effort.  It was still very easy.  I made it the night before to let the flavors mix before baking.  Yum, yum!

A friend and I made two deep dish versions of this for a party and it went over great.  We didn't pre-cook the noodles ahead of time and it still came out just fine.  The brown sugar in the sauce really gives it a homestyle taste.  Refrigerated it for two days before serving it at the party and it performed perfectly!

The best lasagna I have ever made!  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and added extra tomato sauce.  I didn't have basil or oregano so used the dry Italian Seasoning mix.  OUTSTANDING!  Our dinner guest liked it so much he asked to take some home!  That's the best compliment a cook can get! Thanks Rosemary for sharing a GREAT recipe!

Well, overall, this recipe is great! The end result is delicious. But, it requires a lot of effort and time. I usually make an easy version, with noodles that don't need to be boiled, and I use sauce from a jar when I don't have time to make the sauce from scratch. My husband tried this dish and commented that he couldn't tell the difference between the "scratch" and the "jar" recipes. They're good, either way!

The first time I tried this recipe my husband liked the flavor, but thought that it was a bit dry.  The second time I tried the recipe, I combined the tomatoes,paste and spices in a blender.  Blending the ingredients together, made the sauce go further.  My husband liked the lasagna much better the second time.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I actually have not even tasted the lasagne yet, but the sauce was great!  I am doing a test run before I make it for my boyfriend for his birthday.  I used 1/2 pd. turkey and 1/2 pd. turkey sausage and it tasted wonderful.  I cut the recipe down to 4 servings so I could just do a sampler before I do the real deal.  My first time cooking lasagne and my only question is how do you keep it from being so messy?  Maybe I used too much sauce?  It was spilling out the sides.  Overall, I think this recipe is great and easy to follow.  Very easy to add your own spin on the recipe!

I took the advice of the other reviews and added  a small can of tomato sauce to the recipe.  I would still prefer it to be a little saucier so I would recommend at least a large (14oz?) can of tomato sauce.  It was incredible lasagna still!!!

I mixed some fresh basil into the ricotta mixture for some added flavor. This recipe tastes better with each day that passes... leftovers are fantastic!

I thought that this recipe was the best.  My husband is picky about his Italian food, although this recipe was a huge hit for his favorite meal.  Thanks

I added tomato sauce to the recipe to avoid a dry meal (on the suggestion of others) and added Italian sausage.  I also made this a day in advance and baked it with foil covering.  It was delicious! I made it for a lunch party of 15 people and everyone wanted the recipe.  I thought the sauce wasn't overly sweet. I'll definitely make this again.  Some of the guests even called me the next day to see if they could join me for leftovers!

I was not really impressed with this recipe.  It was pretty dry, and there was not much taste to it, even though I made it in the morning and let it sit until the evening.  It was pretty bland. This is just a very basic lasagna recipe.

Really easy recipe.  Tastes great and the pieces stay firm.  The sauce and cheese do not spill out after you cut the pieces.

mmmmmm! This recipe is great and popular among friends/family.  It is very heavy so I use it as a reward at the end of an active day.  So many calories/fat I might as well be eating cheesecake! I also cut back on the sugar a little.

I loved this. And a variation I tried for vegatarians worked brilliantly - just replace the beef with 1/2 lb of puy lentils and add 1/2 lb of very finely chopped mushrooms. You will need to add about 1/2 pint of liquid also, I used red wine. It was yummy.

This lasagna turned out very well...at least in the eyes of my guests. However, I choose to add a little bit of canned sauce to each layer. The recipe as stated leaves the lasagna a little dry for my taste.

I used canned tomato products with the italian spices already in them.  It made the ingredient list a bit shorter and easier.  I left out the onion becuase of my children and cut the sugar down by 1/2.  I also made a 2nd batch of sauce to serve over the top.  Over all it was a hit.

Well, I added an extra jar of sauce and cut the brown sugar in half as suggested.  I also added some crushed red pepper and mushrooms to the sauce, and used half italian sausage instead of all ground beef.  I like spice more than sweet, so I thought making these adjustments made it turn out pretty good!

This was an excellent recipe.  It was also the first time I have ever made lasagna and my husband loved it.  I used all fresh ingredients and it turned out great.  I even used eggbeaters instead of real eggs and it didn't make a difference.  Fantastic!

This was great lasagna!  I invited the inlaws over and they were impressed and just loved it!  Even my picky teenager loved it!  The only thing I did different was to chop the diced tomatoes because nobody likes chunks in their sauce and I used a 32 oz container of ricotta cheese.  This turned out perfect and I will be making this again.

I was expecting a lot more from this recipe.  It was just your average lasagna though.  I used no-boil lasagna and more sauce like everyone suggested.  It is good but not spectacular.

Was much too dry.  If you add more sauce, it might be alright.

Good recipe...I did double the sauce like others said and used half italian sausage with the ground beef.  Definitely needs more garlic and BAY LEAVES.  Next time I will run the meat thru my food processor so its not so chuncky and will layer better.

Super! If a sweet tomatoe sauce is what you are looking for this is it. My boyfriend and I loved it. It was several meals for us. This is great for busy people. Just pop it in the freezer and you have a great meal in an instant.

An average lasagna, not bad, but way overrated.  Cut down on the brown sugar, it's much too sweet, and you will need more sauce than that; maybe add 1.5 cups regular spaghetti sauce.

My husband loved this recipe!  He said it was the best lasagne he ever tasted.  It took a bit of time, work and several pots and pans, but was worth the effort. I would definitely make this again, maybe for company the next time.

Excellent lasagna! Made it for my mother's birthday and everyone raved about it. I did double the sauce and used tons of good quality parmesan cheese. Will be making it again for my son's birthday this months.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  My brother-in-law ate at least three platefuls by himself. This lasagna never lasts long in my house.  I find that adding mushrooms and black olives gives it some extra flavor, also substituting the ground beef with ground turkey, lamb, or sausage gives it a little spin.

It's pretty good, eh. My wife is throwing out her old lasagna recipe. It's so good.. I think I'll rename it "Canadian Lasagna". After all, we gave you Wayne Gretzky and William Shatner. It was a tad on the dry side. Next time, I'll melt some snow and add it to the sauce eh.

I'm always telling people I can't cook, so when I had to cook for my boyfriend's dinner party I was a nervous wreck.  Well after tasting the lasagna I'm now known as a liar....Someone who can make lasagna that tastes this good certainly can cook, I got told over and over.  Great recipe, thank you.

Very simple recipe to make vegetarian by replacing tofu or tempeh for the meat. Also, I always add a bit extra of fresh basil. (Don't ever substitute dried basil in any recipe;- there is just no comparison.) Good "make ahead" dish for busy weeknights... Thank you for sharing!

I made three pans of this for forty of my college friends, and they all loved it.  It's better than the lasagna my mom makes, so when I'm on break next, I'll have to make it for her!  It took a lot more time than I had anticipated, but I suppose that's to be expected when you triple the recipe...

This lasagna was great!  I too made plenty of exta sauce and added sausage.  One more change for next time... I felt that there was too much ricotta cheese, my lasagna was almost white instead of red...but i really don't care for ricotta cheese that much, so it may just be my opinion.

This lasagna was awesome - very tasty.  As suggested, it sat overnight, doubled the sauce, added hot italian sausage, and doubled the ricotta.  I was told - not bad for an Irish chick!  YUM!

I hate to go along with the crowd, but this is really good. I used cottage cheese in place of the ricotta because thats what I had on hand, it turned out really well. Made it for a family get together and everyone really liked it. I now have a new lasagna recipe and I thought my old one was pretty good. If you like lasagna you should try this recipe, it's a keeper.

This was my first attempt at making a lasagna also.  To extend the sauce and add more flavor I changed the recipe as follows:
3/4 LB ground beef
3/4 LB Italian sausage
1 CUP fresh mushrooms, chopped
1 TBSP dried basil 
1.5 TSP dried oregano
2.5 TBSP brown sugar
2 TSP salt
3 (14.5 oz.) cans Italian recipe stewed 
  tomatoes, lightly pureed
3 (6 oz.) tomato paste
1 CUP parmesan cheese

All other ingredients remained the same. It was very tasty! Thanks for the great recipe :o)

I made this for mother's day, for 10 people. It was a hit.  I'm glad I read everyone's suggestions about adding ingredients to the sauce to yield more.  I added 1/2 cup water, 3 tbs. of red wine, and an extra can of diced tomatoes.  This was the perfect amount!  I also sliced my mozzarella and shredded, to make the lasagna the cheesiest it could be.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was my first attempt at a home-made lasagna.  The preperation was the most time consuming, however it was worth it.  I took the option of preparing it a day in advance and letting it sit in the refrigorator over night.  That was perfect, because the next day all I had to do was pop it in the oven for 30 minutes.

Great Recipe!  My 14 year old son made this for dinner last night.  I have to admit though that he used 1/2 pound of hot italian sausage and 1 pound of ground beef.  turned out fantastic.

I've traveled around the world, and by far this is the best I've had! I've made this with and w/o the ricotta cheese mixture and it was still fantastic. I'll probably add little more sugar next time or try sweet italian sausage.

I made this for company, and everyone loved it.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes that had italian seasonings instead of the tomatoes it called for.  I made it the night before and had to bake it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  It is a bit dry and could use more sauce.  Next time I will bake it covered with foil.  My 2 year old loved it.

Another satisfied customer here.  My husband and I liked it very much.  My 2 year-old loved it and eat a huge piece.  He actually sat at the table throughout the entire meal.  This is rare.  I did puree and add a 14oz. can of tomatoes to extend the sauce and used a quart of ricotta rather than a pint.  Can't wait to have some for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe

This is a great recipe although I wanted to make extra sauce and ended up with too much.  It would be great if someone got it just right and told some of us exactly what to add for more sauce.  Thanks for any help!

Great recipe!! Made it a day ahead and added a little bit more diced tomates and tomato paste and it tasted excellent. I personally didn't think it was too cheesy.  It is however a little time consuming but well worth the effort. Definately a keeper!!!

I tried this recipe and loved it so much that I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks for various events.  It is very tasty--I think the brown sugar is a great touch, but I agree with the others that there isn't enough sauce.  I also use crushed tomatoes instead of diced because I like that texture better.  YUMMY!

This is a VERY good recipe!  I made extra sauce based on the reviews of the others and I am glad that I did, you defintely need it. I also refrigerated it overnight.  My 4 year old wanted it again for dinner the next day which is very unusual for him.  This is a keeper!!

Fabulous lasagna recipe! I used 2 lbs of beef, and 1 1/2 lbs of mozza, making it extra meaty and cheesy. Everyone I've made it for loves it!

The best lasagna recipe that I've ever tried and the tastiest!  My husband, sister
and brother-in-law thought it was fantastic too.

I made this for my husband, who rarely comments on anything that I make.  Well, he had a lot to say this time.  He absolutely loved it and so did I.  I thought it was a little dry but the taste was fantastic.  I will be making in the future again.  It was very easy to make, with little time.

Great recipe! I used cottage cheese in addition to the ricotta (doubled the amount, actually, after reading reviews that it was dry) and it came out a little runny/sloppy (my fault...I played around with the recipe!!) but it had the best taste of any lasagna I've ever made or tasted. Next time I'll add half as much cottage cheese to the ricotta, bet it'll be perfect!

My son didn't like the amount of cheese in the lasagna, but loved the taste.  The rest of my family raved about the taste, textile and appearance.  This was my very first attempt at making lasagna and believe me it won't be my last.  Because of my husbands diabetes I omitted the brown sugar and found the test delectable.  The extra cheese on top really kept the noodles on top more moist.  Thank you for this great recipe.

This is the first time I've ever attempted lasagna and this recipe was delicious!  As per others' suggestions I used extra mozzarella and it turned out perfectly.  I think using half hamburger and half sausage would make it out of this world!  Do try this lasagna, it's a bit time consuming, but worth it!

This is an excellent lasagna recipe!  I agree that it needs a little more sauce and cheese on top to keep the top noodles from drying out on the edges. I will definitely use it again!!

I loved this recipe! Used half Italian Sausage & half lean ground beef.  I also put the tomatos in the food processor for a spin because the hubby doesn't like chunks of tomatos in anything.  This is very tasty, and well worth the effort.  It will get rave reviews at any dinner party!

Excellent recipe! I made this for friends last night and everyone loved it. Moist, delicious. I mixed half hot italian sausage and half ground round, also made extra sauce to serve on the side. Will make again!

I prepared the recipe the night before as others suggested.  The sauce alone as cooking was fantastic.  I suggest being sure you have enough cheese on top to keep the lasagna noodles moist. It was a really great recipe.  My guests all really enjoyed it!!

Had left-overs to use up: spaghetti sauce and lasagna noodles.  Only thing I had to buy was ricotta cheese.  Easy, fast, and kids loved it.

Everyone loved it for New Years Eve dinner.  This is definitely not a low sodium or calorie recipe, but can be adjusted with substitutes (which is my next attempt).

This was GREAT!!  Making the sauce from scratch makes all the difference!  I really
liked this, and I am not a big lasagna fan.  My husband is, and he loved it... even
my 6 yr old daughter liked it, and she's pretty picky right now.  One of my coworkers
tasted some I brought for lunch today and immediately asked for the recipe.  This
is definitely a keeper!

Wonderful, homemade flavor. Well worth the time. The simmering sauce smells delicious.
