With the exception of it being too salty, we really liked this. I made two large thin crust pizza's instead of one. I loved the Italian seasoning in the crust but I will add a tad more next time. I made no changes other than adding the sugar to the yeast/water mixture. I baked this on a pizza pan covered with parchment paper and dusted with corn meal. Thanks for sharing.
