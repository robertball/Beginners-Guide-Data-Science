I used this recipe to create thank you gifts for a holiday party.  We also used them for holiday gifts for teachers, neighbors and friends.  We're planning to use this recipe for our Scout troop fundraiser this summer.

This cookie tastes great and looks good in a jar, but they are difficult to bake and store.  The cookies turned out too thin and broke easily when cooling.  There isn't enough dough to hold all of the extras together.

I made this recipe for a take home gift at my daughters birthday party and all the parents came back to us just to ask us for the recipe, it was a huge help. I've recommended this website to all my friend and they just love it.

WE MADE THESE FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS, LEFT OUT THE NUTS. THEY WERE AWESOME!  WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS BAKING THEM OR THEM FALLING APART.
OF COURSE WE HAD TO SAMPLE A BATCH.  LOL

Cookies fell apart.  Cookies were also VERY sweet - too many chocolate candies.
