Okay, sorry, this is not good. I love chicken, I love asparagus, almonds, tarragon, everything in the ingredients... but it had no flavor. I might has well have just boiled up some chicken and asparagus. If you like bland food (like something from a cafeteria or buffet) then go for it. I hate to be a meanie, but it just wasn't that yummy! How did it get these reviews? I put two cans of soup, added some milk- the consistency was nice. I added mushrooms as well and served it over rice. It needs something else though. Perhaps sour cream or melted cream cheese? Maybe some lemon juice? Something that compliments the tarragon, I don't know what. Maybe just needs more tarragon. Definitely needs salt and pepper.

We enjoyed this recipe, but I would make a few changes if I were to make it again. The condnsed chicken soup really stayed quite lumpy. I think I would add some milk to the condensed soup and mix really well before pouring it over the dish. Also, I added some red peppers to the dish for some color and because I had them! It wasn't too kid friendly in our house because of the asparagus, but I made it because of the asparagus!

This was so delicious!  I also added about 1/2 soup can of milk, a can of sliced mushrooms and parmesan cheese.  It was excellent!

I did as the other person suggested and added some milk to the cream of chicken soup before pouring over the top.  It turned out great. I think it would have been too thick without it.  Other than that, I think the recipe is very good...especially over rice.

I love this recipe.  It is quick and easy.  My 6 year old loves asparagus so it has proven to be very kid-friendly around my house.  I always get clean plate results.

I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts.  We love asparagus, so I used 1-1/2 lbs. instead of 1 lb.  It was good, but I think next time I'll use 2 cans of cream of chicken to have more sauce.

Let me say right away that tarragon is probably my least favorite seasoning, but I used it in this dish and it turned out pretty good.

I didn't have the almonds and it really cried out for them.

Overall, this was very good and I would definitely make it again.  

The rice is its perfect mate!

This recipe was great!  I didn't have any almonds on hand, but it still turned out super.  My family loved it.  It definitely had flavor.  I am even thinking of adding some fresh mushrooms to the mix.  To boot it was very easy and quick - my favorite kind of dinner.

I love it!  It's a nice change from the "same old chicken" we usually have.  My husband's favorite vegetable is asparagus so this recipe was well received.

This was a winner.  A few modifications.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the onions, and I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so used cream of celery instead.  I read the reviews about adding a little milk or water and used half a can of milk with the condensed soup.  Also after cooking the rice about half way, I mixed it in with the rest before baking.  There were no leftovers.  My husband gave it a 4 star rating.

I have to say I'm a little surprised by the 1-stars after this dish. I did make some changes, (seasoned chicken w/ garlic powder and Pappy's seasoning salt prior to browning, added sour cream to the soup mix along with water to thin it a little.) and did top w/almonds. My husband said it was awesome. Actually his exact words were, "This is delicious. Worthy of (insert local 5-star restaurant)."  I thought the asparagus was overdone too, probably wouldn't allow it to cook as long with the onions next time...or not at all? Even so, I'm filing it in the 'favorites!'

Tasty,easy recipe.  I always add white wine to any recipe calling for cream of chix soup and also added some parmesan cheese (or swiss) and some of the tarragon to the soup before spreading on chicken.

This turned out great for my dinner party last night, though I did customize it. Instead of cans of soup or water, I used some vegetable stock combined with milk and yogurt. I pre-sauteed mushrooms with asparagus,  and used pine nuts instead of almonds. The chicken and asparagus turned out so moist and delicious! I will definitely cook again.

This recipe was great because it was easily adaptable to the ingredients that I had laying around- cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken (I did add milk), green beans in addition to the asparagus and Mrs. Dash in place of tarragon. Great recipe for an adaptable casserole.

It was okay, but needs something to jazz it up a little bit.  I added a little chicken broth as it was too thick.  Also, if I make it again, I won't put the asparagus in until about 5 min before it is through baking. I prefer my asparagus a littlecrunchy. I didnt cook it at all until it went in the oven and it was still  slightly overcooked.  How about a little curry and fresh mushrooms?

Maybe the person who rated this as bland didn't put something in or something.  I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I made a few variations though. First I like casserole's ready to eat, so I diced all of the chicken breasts.  I also prefer using a casserole dish, so I opted to transfer the ingredients to a casserole dish before baking it.  I layered the asparagus and onion on the bottom, layered the chicken all the way across and smoothed the chicken broth on the top of it with a cake frosting spatula.  It cooked a little slower than the recipe stated, but it was fantastic, had a great flavor and we are eating the leftovers!

I took some of the comments and added garlic, mushrooms, seasoned the chicken and mixed the soup separately with the taragon & 1/2 cup chicken stock to thin. It turned out really well. We are fat and happy on the couch after a great dinner and looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

I have asparagus in the garden and I'm always looking for recipes.  This was great. I spinkled the tarragon with garlic salt on the chicken prior to browning.  I also topped it again before baking.  Gave it plenty of flavor. I've already printed the recipe and filed it.

A quick easy tatsy meal for the whole family. My kids usually complain about asparagus, but definitely enjoyed it in this dish. I made it exactly as written except for the almonds - didn't have any on hand. I will make this one again and again.

I also added whole milk and a jar of mushrooms. Since I don't do nuts, I put cheddar cheese on top and lacking tarragon I used thyme, and all together it was very wonderful :)

My asparagus hating husband loved this. He cleared his plate. The only alteration i made was leaving out the tarragon. I am unsure about this ingredient and haven't had any other recipes with it so it wasn't worth buying.

This is a regular in our house.   To bump up the flavor, I crush up about 1/4 cup of smoked almonds instead of the sliced almonds and add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.  I also add about 1/2 cup of milk.   It also goes great with biscuits instead of rice.

I took many of the tips from previous reviewers and added fresh mushrooms, garlic salt & season salt to the chicken while browning and milk to the cream of chicken soup. All of these additions worked very well. I didn't want to buy tarragon as I have never used it or seen it before so I consulted one of my cookbooks for a substitution. They recommended crushed fennel seed which I used, but I think I might just omit it all together next time as I wasn't a huge fan of that flavor. My husband and I liked this dish, but both agreed that it could use even more flavor...perhaps some additional spice, cheese or even sour cream?? I can definitely see how those who made this exactly as written felt it was too bland.

This was simple, and a good use for all the asparagus that is fresh in the markets right now!  I completely spaced on the tarragon - so I don't know what all that would have brought to the dish - but I'll have to try it next time I make this.  I would just suggest that the chicken be well seasoned before it's cooked, because I can see how without that step, the dish could end up on the bland side.  I'm also thinking about sauteing some fresh sliced mushrooms next time, and adding them in with the asparagus and onion.

This recipe was ok.  I wouldn't make it again, though.  It was pretty bland.

Nothing special.  I wanted to try this recipe because me and my fiance AND kids love asparagus.  But I'm sorry to say that this was just not good.  After eating it I had a very 'heavy' feeling in my stomach, almost like eating a big spoonful of straight sour cream.  It just didn't sit well with me.  My fiance only liked the 'aspargus part', while my kids loved it.  Go figure! LOL.  So I will give this just 2 stars 'cause at least my kids liked it -)

The asparagus seemed to be covered up with this recipe, I didn't much care for the tarragon flavoring either, but hey it's a personal preference!  Thanks for the recipe anyway!

The tarragon seasoning worked well with the chicken but I also added some sage. I didn't care for the use of straight cream of chicken soup. It didn't permeate the casserole during baking and even after stirring the completed dish together, the texture was strange and unappetizing.  I would also increase the amount of asparagus relative to the chicken.

Just made this for lunch & it was just ok.  Taking into consideration that a cpl of the prev comments mentioned that this dish was bland, I added diced red pepper, chix broth in plc of the water, some cream & sour cream. I also seasoned the chicken as I was cooking it.  Again, it was so-so.  Wd I make it again?  No, as there are too many other delicious recipes on this site.

We thought this recipe was so-so.  A little bland for our tastes - probably won't make it again.
