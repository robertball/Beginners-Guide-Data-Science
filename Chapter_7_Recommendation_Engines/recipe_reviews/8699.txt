This turned out REALLY good. I altered it slightly, but only for my own convenience. Instead of browning the chicken, I pre-baked it for an hour at 350, covered. So, I sauteed the leeks alone until soft, then added the soup and 1 cup of chicken broth (because I didn't want to buy wine), then added the cornstarch and let thicken. Once the chicken was finished, I shredded it, transferred to a square 8 X 8 pyrex baking dish, mixed with the leek/soup mixture, then covered with a single sheet of puff pastry. It turned out very good, just like chicken pot pie. Excellent comfort food.

this was super tasty, and I don't even usually like things like chicken pot pie... i used a can of condensed cream of asparagus instead of vegetable soup, and added some broccoli florets... turned out delicious and actually i thought it looked pretty good as well.

This was really tasty, I also put in some fresh chopped asparagus which added to the flavour (you could also try broccoli).  I put puff pasty on top of the casserole dish sprinkled with poppy seeds which really worked well.

I was looking to use the leeks I got from the farmer's market  This is like a super fast chicken pot pie! My family loved it! I did use chicken broth instead of wine because my kids don't like the taste of it.

My family really enjoyed this. Like another reviewer suggested, I sauteed the leeks in olive oil with some minced garlic. I did add in some steamed broccoli, shredded carrots, and I ended up using cream of chicken soup as I didn't have condensed vegetable soup. I suspect this would work well with many condensed soups, based on your tastes. (I'm considering trying a different one next time, just to see the variation in taste.) But we will definitely be making this again, as my family really enjoyed it.

Nummy! I just got done with dinner and had 2 helpings! Never have had leeks before and got some from a friend and came across this.  Changes- Light cream of chicken soup, sparkling wine( what I had) and some mixed veggies and sauted the leeks in olive oil with fresh garlic. Will definately make again!!!

This is more like a chicken pot pie than a chicken casserole.  My boyfried really enjoyed it.  I added the garlic as suggested and sauteed the leeks first.  Used cream of chicken soup and Riesling as the white wine.  The slight sweetness of the Riesling really makes a difference in leek dishes.

Everyone who liked it modified it into an entirely different recipe; very disappointing.  I love leeks and find that they were wasted in the vegetable soup.  If you want to enjoy it, you'll have to modify it like the rest.

Excellent casserole, thanks for this - I did make some changes though, I used chicken soup, threw in some green beans and carrots and added garlic - and as the reviews suggested sauted the leeks first in olive oil, this is a real winner.

Good comfort food recipe! The only change I made was to use puff pastry for the topping instead of pie dough. Turned out very good!

My family really enjoyed this.   Next time I will probably add some herbs ( rosemary and thyme).  I swapped chicken broth for the wine, as I had no wine ( a first in my family).  Used cream of chicken soup, instead of veggie soup.  Again, what was on hand.  I will make again for sure as it was so easy.

I'm always trying to make dishes more nutritional, and leeks have a lot of food value. I added 2 minced garlic cloves and a small chopped sweet onion with the chicken. Since I love red bell peppers, I also added a whole chopped pepper with the soup and wine.  OMG! This was sooo good.

Very easy and tasty for a midweek dinner.  I used mushroom soup and topped with Pillsbury Grands instead of pie crust.
