I really liked the idea of this recipe and we love all the ingredients, but we found the end result unbalanced.  The briny olives competed with the acidic and bright lemon juice which was outdone by the sriracha until the poor Brussels sprout was lost.  Although it was the perfect side to balance my sweet rich turkey and gravy.
