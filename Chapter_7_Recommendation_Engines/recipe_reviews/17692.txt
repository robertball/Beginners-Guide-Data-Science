This is a great recipe, but after making it twice, have found it either has a typo or needs a slight modification.  Both times I have made this jelly as the recipe states, it has not set up properly, as others have noted as well.  The first time I put it all back into a pan, added 1 more box of powdered pectin, cooked and processed again as stated.  After that it set up fine and was absolutely delicious.  I just made it again (as written) and am again having the problem with it not setting up.  I will add more pectin and re-process as I did before and hope for the same results.  For all first time users of this recipe...this is a fantastic flavored jelly...if you want it sauce consistancy follow the recipe as written.  If you want jelly consistancy use 2 packets of pectin.  And one word of warning...this stuff is addicting!!!  I have also played with the type of peppers...substituting hotter peppers for or adding to the jalepenos.  My latest batch is actually a 4 pepper jelly...Red, Green, Jalepeno and a touch of hablano...mmmmmm!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I read all of the reviews and used 3 of the suggestions:  1. I drained the peppers after chopping  2. I boiled 2 minutes instead of 1 and   3. I used the inversion method and it worked great but I had to run the jars under hot water to loosen them so they would settle into the bottom of the jar.  I also used 2 cups of red bell peppers, 1 cup of green bell peppers and 1 cup of jalepenos.  The jelly turned out GREAT (but could still be hotter for my taste) and it is the first jelly I have ever made.  I used Sure-Jell fruit pectin if it helps.

I made 3 batches of this recipe and found that I had 21 jars of jelly that did not set.  Very runny and a little disappointing.  Tastes good, but a bit vinegary.  Is there a way to re-cook it with more pectin to make it more jelly-like?  I'd appreciate some feedback to save these batches!

THIS TASTED GREAT BUT JUST WILL NOT SET.  I DRAINED THE PEPPERS AFTER I CHOPPED THEM.  I'VE EVEN ADD MORE PECTIN,SUGAR, LEMON JUICE AND WATER AND BOILED IT FOR A SECOND TIME AND RESEALED.  AND THEY WONT SET.  ANY TIPS ON HOW TO FIX?

This was the best pepper jelly--I made it in 1 evening with great success.  I took half of the peppers & half of the vinegar and put the mix into my blender, repeat with the remaining half.  After the jars were filled I used the inversion method instead of the hot bath (just turn the jars upside down after filling with hot mixture for 3 hours)

Divine! I used only green bell, yellow hungarian and jalapeno peppers (no red bells), since that is what we grew in our garden.  Following other's suggestions, I drained the excess water from the peppers with cheesecloth before processing.  I only used one packet of pectin and boiled for two minutes.  These modifications created the perfect jelled consistency.  I'm making my second batch right now!  Thanks for the super recipe and great tips!

I have probably made over 20 batches of this recipe and these are my recommendations.  Use Sure-Jell pectin if you can, it keeps the peppers suspended throughout the jelly and sets very well.  Also, cut the peppers by hand, not in a food process or chopper.  Those methods create more liquid and the jelly may not set.  Do not turn the jars as that may disrupt the jelling process.  If you want it hotter, cut back on the red peppers (1/2 cup) and add more hot peppers-habenero, chili, serano, etc.  Just make sure you have a total of 4 cups of chopped peppers.

I made 4 batches of this jelly today, each varying the types of peppers and the degree of chopping (some processed in the food processor, some hand chopped).  All four batches set up perfectly. I do love the flavor of the recipe's exact mixture of peppers, but it is not spicy.  I made a recipe using 4 cups of jalepenos and it is spicier.  I will use both!!  One thing I wanted to note for those who are having difficulties with their jelly setting properly-- make sure to bring your mixture of peppers, vinegar and pectin to a good rolling boil (it still boils while stirred) before adding the sugar.  After adding the sugar, return to a full rolling boil (this takes several minutes) and will be really frothy, bubbly as you stir it for exactly one minute longer.  Then, remove from the heat immediately and fill your jars.  I made over 100 jars of jam this week and this method did not fail!!  Good luck-- enjoy your jelly!!!

The taste is wonderful but my jelly wouldn't jell, I followed the instructions carefully but alas it's more like syrup than jelly. If anyone knows how to "fix" this I would appreciate it as I have 6 more pints of it and I hesitate to throw it out. I will check here weekly. Thanks

I read the other reveiwsabout it not setting up, and I should have listened.  I have making jelly forever, this recipe is running, not even close to setting up. Very disapointed.

I love the recipe.  With the red peppers included, the jelly is a pretty color for the upcoming holdidays.  The taste is perfect for me.  It is hot, but not "killer hot."  The one problem I had was that the jelly did not set up well and was runny.  After a few days it is still not firm but it is more solid than it was.  I actually don't mind the fact that it is not solid as I will be using it on cream cheese as an appetizer.  I tried the recipe with dry pectin and liquid pectin and had the same results.  The jelly may firm up as time goes on.  However, I will use the recipe again, because the taste is perfect.

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  I added a little green food coloring.  Would add more jalapenos next time, I like it "hot"!  Delicious over a brick of cream cheese with crackers.

OK, here's the deal. I looked at all of the recipes but I'm commenting on this one because it's the only one I found that uses the 1.75oz box of pectin rather than the liquid pectin. My jelly turned out perfectly and has a kick. This is what I used: 1 cup finely chopped jalapenos. (I left seeds & membranes in about half of them and my jelly has a decent kick.) 2 cups finely chopped green bell peppers, drained the best you can - I used a colander and let them sit for about 5 minutes. (I caution against using red bell peppers because they can add an off-putting flowery flavor.) 1 cup of cider vinegar (yes, use cider, not white.) 5 cups of sugar and 1 box of pectin. The trick to perfect jelly is to follow the directions exactly. Bring it to a ROLLING (foamy, bubbling) boil and cook for exactly one minute. Do this and your jam will set up perfectly. Good luck!

The setting issue may be in the sequence of events.  I boil the vinegar, peppers and sugar first, then add the pectin at the end. Boil 1 additional minute, stirring continuously, then fill jars. It set just fine for me doing it this way.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used two boxes of pectin.  It set up beautifully. UPDATE - After noticing that the ratios are exactly what Ball recommends I made the recipe again with one box of pectin.  I measured very carefully and I hand cut all of the peppers.  It turned out to be the best ever.  I will continue to make this with one box of pectin.

After reading all the reviews I was reluctant to make this jelly by the recipe but decided to try it and tweak it later as necessary. The only change to the original is that I used 2 1/2 cups jalapenos and 1 1/4 red/green bell.  The jelly cooled to a soupy texture and I put the jars in my cabinet.  5 days later I took the jars out to see if I could "fix" the jelly and they were firmed perfectly.  This jelly has a perfect combination of sweet and hot. Everyone who's tried it wants to take a jar home with them.  Patience appears to be the key here but it's well worth the wait.

This is a great recipe!    However, it should be known that this particular recipe may take up to 3 weeks to set up!  If I had not read that in pectin recipe guide, I would have thrown the jelly away.    Be patient, turn the jars over now and again so the peppers don't settle at the top of the jar and you will not be disappointed!  Honest : )   This jelly served with cream cheese on Townhouse crackers is a hit at any gathering.  Enjoy!

Awesome pepper jelly!  I do a lot of canning and this is an absolute winner. I used a combination of 3 1/4 cups red and green bell peppers and then 3/4 cup of yellow wax peppers (a bit hotter than jalapenos)--had the perfect amount of kick and looked gorgeous! I like my pepper jelly to be sweet at first and then for a little bit of heat to come on.  

My jelly set perfectly (I use Sure-Jell pectin)--a few tips: 1) bring to a HARD ROLLING boil (i.e., one that continues to boil hard even while stirring) before you dump in your sugar, 2) bring to a HARD ROLLING boil again after adding the sugar and let it boil for exactly 2 minutes after that, 3) doubling the recipe is okay, but don't do more than that at once--takes too long to bring that much food product to a hard rolling boil in the ideal time-frame for setting jelly.  If you keep those three pointers in mind, it's a pretty fool-proof recipe and tastes AMAZING!!!  This is my go-to midnight snack or party favor--people love this with Wheat-Thin or Ritz crackers and cream cheese.

This is a great, simple jelly recipe. I used 2 pkg pectin based on reviews, but think 1 is likely fine assuming you cook the jelly long enough at each stage. To prevent fruit from floating in any jam/jelly, let it sit about 5-7 minutes after removing from heat. Stir regularly. This gives extra time to remove all foam as well. You will find you have evenly distribution. If your jars, lids, and rings are piping hot, as they should be, you'll have no problems with jars sealing.

Just made this jelly today and it is fantastic.  First let me say this is my second attempt to make jelly. The first was a strawberry last month and it also turned out great. Second I am 42 year old male. So if I can do it, anybody can its that easy. After reading the reviews I did make a couple changes. first I used the jalapeno peppers with the seeds and all as I tend to like things with a little more heat. Next I used 1.5 packs of Sure-Jell pectin per some of the reviews. I also boiled the liquid 2 minutes instead of 1 per the reviews and pressed as much liquid out of the chopped peppers as I could(I used a food processor). There was a lot of liquid and as I didnt have any type of cloth I put the peppers into a coffee filter and squeezed it out. Now for other newbies, I thought I missed something and went back to check recipe.4 cps peppers/ pectin and 1cp vinegar didnt look right in pan but it will come to a boil. Then adding 5 cups of sugar I never thought it would be any where near a liquid state much less come to another boil but it did I also added 15 drops of green food coloring for appearance. I followed the rest of the directions to the letter and it set and looks great and the taste is outstanding.  The kids were a bit optimistic to try a jelly made with PEPPERS! after watching me make it but after I got them to try it they love it too. I WILL be making more very soon. I got the (6) 8oz jars and about 1/4 of another I put in the fridge. IT DIDNT LAST THE NIGHT!

Best pepper jelly recipe I've tried--everyone who gets this as a gift begs for more.  I don't use any green peppers, except the jalapeno, and the mix of yellow, orange and red gives it a fabulous color.  I invariably have to use two packages of pectin for it to set at the consistency I like.

My rating is based upon the potential, not the original recipe. As written, it is VERY mild. Good, but mild. I had to change the amounts of hot peppers to get it to be hot. I kept the base 5 cups the same. With that being said, once I figured out how much hot peppers I needed to make it as hot as I wanted it, it turned out DELICIOUS! My husband, my brother, and myself are addicted to it! We have been putting it on pork chops, ribs, chicken wings (we are from buffalo...lol), sandwiches, etc. As far as setting, I doubled the amount of pectin and got a hard set. I prefer a more thick sauce set, so the next batch will only have about 4 tbsp of pectin.

I cut back the sugar to 4 cups and it was still sweet enough. In fact, when I make it again I'm gonna cut back another 1/2 cup of sugar and hope it doesn't affect the consistency. Also, after reading the reviews I squeezed the bell peppers to remove excess liquid. One box of pectin worked fine. Consistency was perfect and the taste rivaled that of the store bought product. Very, very happy w/the results. Am planning to make it again soon with different colored bell peppers.

Like many suggested: Boil 2 minutes, use inversion, and drain the peppers and you shouldn't have problems with it setting.  It set overnight for us.  It's awesome.  We used those fancy new jars from Ball and it'll be a perfect gift.  Our variation: 2C Red (3 peppers), 1C Green (2 peppers), 2 hot red peppers, and 4 jalepenos.  Made 7 8oz jars.

I LOVE this recipe - I have been using it for years now - so many people want it - I can't keep up with the demand!  I have tweeked it for myself - love using more red peppers in the miix - makes for a really pretty jelly color - also use orange Habenero peppers and and orange banana peppers - have changed the ratio so that it is more spicy - also have drained the chopped peppers before cooking - too much liquid otherwise.  You really can't go wrong with the flavor  mix in this recipe - it is a winner!

YUM!  This turned out beautiful AND delicious.  I chopped my red and green peppers in the food processor then pushed all of the liquid out of them in a strainer.  I boiled for two minutes instead of one and used no suger pectin.  It set up beautifully!  I'll be giving it as Christmas presents.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used two pectin packages as suggested and it set up beautifully.  Also I doubled the hot peppers and used cayenne and super hot chilies instead of jalapeños. I added some red onion and a little garlic.  Wow it's delicious and extremely hot!  This was my first pepper jelly and I cant wait to try some different variations on my next batches...

Enjoyed this recipe...had no problems with it jelling, but did have a problem with the majority of the peppers "floating" toward the surface, rather than being evenly dispersed throughout the jelly.  anyone know why or any suggestions to correct this problem in future batches?

Awesome!  After reading reviews, I used 4 tbsp of pectin instead of three (3 tbsp=1 box)... the scrapings are already set in the bottom of the pan.  I used a different pepper combo, since I had habaneros in the garden.  Added 1/2 tsp of allspice and a pinch of cloves and nutmeg to give it a caribbean flavor.  SO good, this batch isn't going to last long!

As suggested by  many reviewers, I drained the peppers after chopping finely in the food processor; however, I couldn't bring myself to discard all that flavorful, peppery yumminess, so I put the pepper juice in my empty cooking pot and reduced it until it was thick and syrupy (watching carefully to not let it burn) then added in the vinegar (Bragg's), pectin (6 Tbl Ball brand), and chopped peppers (I used a total of 4 cups mixed red/orange/yellow/green sweet and chili peppers from my garden, with a greater proportion of hot chilies than specified) and proceeded with the recipe. I simmered it for 5 minutes before adding the sugar and bringing it to FULL rolling boil for a generous minute.  Set up great and tastes awesome! Oh, I also added 1 tsp salt to the recipe, which combined with the existing sweet/hot/sour composition gave it a welcome added dimension. One more thing:  I tried leaving some seeds in; they look interesting suspended in the jelly, but are tough to the tooth when eating it, so when I make this again I will minimize or leave out the seeds.

I no longer do any canning so I cool the jelly, then spoon into baggies and freeze.  I keep a clean jelly jar for refills.  This works just fine and no harm to the jelly!

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and my friends have come to expect their jar come harvest time.  I have had the same problems with the gel setting and will try the suggestions provided.  

As for the peppers floating to the top:  I had read that you can tilt the jars while the jelly is setting (do not turn upside down). I simply tilt it on its base and roll around a little.  This is only suggested after a 10 minute boil and with 4 or 8 oz jars.  The method works fine.

I'm not an expert on cooking, so I want to give this as a warning to other inexperienced like me:  Wear rubber gloves when cutting and seeding the jalapeno peppers!!  Trust me from experience!!!  A very good recipe though.

This was delicious.  We used it as a topping for Chicken Flautas (also from this website).  I modified the pepper ratios to suit our spicier taste.  I used about 3 cups of jalapenos and 1 each of red & green bell peppers.  Even after this modification, it was still sweet, I think I could have upped the jalapenos even further.  I used 4 tbs pectin, and that was a very thick jelly.  I think next time I will reduce to 3 tbs.  I also used the inversion method to set.

Delicious recipe!  I only wanted to make a little bit since it was my first time making it so I cut the recipe in half except for the pectin and it turned out excellent.  I also used 4 Habanaro peppers instead of jalapeno's.  I will definately make this again!

This is a fabulous recipe, it just needs one modification. Drain whatever combo of peppers you use, in a colander with a coffee filter overnite. This takes the excess moisture out and your jelly will jell!
Whatever combo of peppers you choose the measurement must equal 4 cups of peppers, chopped, with or without seeds. So easy, it really is the best!

This jam turned out good for a first timer, but I thought it was way too sweet. Reading the other reviews, I doubled the amount of pectin (turned out a bit too much, next time I will use only a box and a half) and I tripled the Jalapeno's but still found it too mild. Next time I will for sure leave some pepper seeds in to liven it up!

Sweet AND hot. Delicious on cream cheese crackers and warm on egg rolls or pork. I have made this several times when the garden is overflowing.
I have used various types of peppers depending on what I happen to have on hand, keeping close to the original 4 c. amount of peppers stated. Usually I end up with a bit more hot peppers (1/2 c. to 3/4 c.)  because I like it that way.

* I see many have complained about the set. I don't recall having any problems.

THE best tasting pepper jelly!  It is a little runny as written, but it is easy to pour over cream cheese.  Might add an additional 1/2 box of pectin next time.  But the taste is PERFECT!!

Tasted really good. I was able to make 6 jelly jars. 3 were red and 3 were green. I accidently added too much green food coloring so it turned out very dark. Next time, I would like to add some red food coloring also because the recipe as is is light brown/green than red.

This is the best!  I've tried quite a few and Wendy's is by far my favorite.  It is so very easy.  I make a couple of batches at Christmas, its a nice gift in a basket of goodies.  I've even colored one batch red and one green and layered or just had different colored jars, fun!  If you've never worked with fresh jalapenos before be sure and where gloves!  Thanks, Wendy!

This turned out great.  I couldn't figure out what color it would be, so I made two different batches - one using all red peppers and another using all green peppers.  The red was perfectly red, and I added about 15 drops of green food coloring to get the green pepper the color I liked.  Also, doubled the jalapenos.  Used Ball no sugar pectin, and set within an hour or so.  I plan to make another couple of batches to give as Christmas favors...

Turned out great. I highly recommend rinsing the peppers before chopping and I used a food processor for a really fine chop (ok, I turned them to mush!). Also I varied the recipe by using a low-sugar pectin, so it set up better.

Ok... I'm going to see if I can help some of you out that are having issues with your jelly setting up properly. (watery jelly issue)
Using Pectin 101... Pectin requires 3 things. Water, sugar and acid. (Many jam makers swear the order that they are combined makes a difference. (water and sugar first, then Pectin, then acid) Making JJ's (jams and jellies) requires heat to cause the pectin to create a thick consistency. IT MUST BOIL! I think the actual temp is about 215 Deg F/101 Deg C for pectin to activate properly. Like using corn starch, if you don't hit the right temp, your molecular reaction will be weak and/or fail.
Because JJ's are usually made with fruit that contain natural sugar, acid and pectin (yes, most fruits naturally have pectin in them) making a pepper jelly is slightly different than making a fruit concoction. It is very important you do not lower or omit sugar, acid or water. There are no substitutes (Sweet n Low, etc) 
Peppers do contain water so the type, production method and time of year they are harvested will dictate how much water is in the peppers and thus how much water will be released when they are cooked. (This affects cooking time) 
Chilled spoons: Keep 1/2 a dozen tasting spoons in the freezer while you are boiling down your pepper JJ. When you think it might be ready, grab a chilled spoon, dip it in your mix and then pop it back in the freezer on a small plate for a few mins. Too watery? Keep boiling! Keep testing until the taste is balanced

Wow awesome recipe!! It jelled up super nice!    I was worried about it setting nice because of all the reviews. So when i boiled it i brought it to a full rolling boil that couldn't be stirred down then started timing.  Make sure you are stirring the whole time! ( and I added 1/2 Tbsp of cherry jello powder to it when it started boiling) thanks for the recipe!:)

Making Pepper Jelly is extremely easy. If you look at this recipe it is basically 4 cups of finely chooped peppers. Any variety, your choice, combination of. I believe after reading other reviews the reason people are having difficulty with it setting up is that they are BLENDING the peppers in a blender instead of CHOPPING them FINELY. YOu do not have to strain the peppers if you follow the instructions and FINELY CHOP 4 cups of assorted peppers. RED/YELLOW/Green combinations make it really pretty. When using pour 1/2 pint jar of jelly over a softened brick of cream cheese that is on a pretty plate, serve with assorted crackers that do not have added flavors. ENJOY  just DON'T blend the peppers!

First of all, let me say that I really like this recipe and will be using it regularly during canning season.  But now for the tweeking. After making several batches of this recipe, I've determined that for my tastes, 1/3 cup jalapenos and 1/3 cup banana peppers and the remainder an equal mix of red, green, and yellow bells is about right; and I'm a mild salsa kinda gal. I also added 1/2 tsp salt.  As for the set/not set question, my experience is that using SureJell the recipe is perfect. Using a cheaper brand that I got on sale (Mrs. Wages.  Yeah, I'd never heard of it either, but it was half the price.) I needed one box plus half an ounce to get a good set.  Who knew there would be such a difference from one brand to another?  I plan on giving some of mine as Christmas gifts.

Once combined with all the suggestions, this was outstanding! 
1) Boiled for two minutes instead of the suggested one.
2) Kept the 5 cup limit of peppers, but used a mix of red and green bell, banana, jalapeno, and for a kick, one nalaga jokia!
Had it on a bagel with cream cheese this morning and it was OUTSTANDING! The jelly was perfectly set, not too firm, not runny or "weeping." Will definitely be using this recipe again!

This is so good. I gave some to a friend. She gave her son a jar. He has asked for a dozen more jars. I used 2 1/2 cups of peppers total. 1/2 cup jalapenos is mild but with good flavor. 1 cup jalapenos is about medium. I like the medium best.

Excellent recipe.  This is my first time making it and it turned out perfectly!  Instead of using green bell peppers, I used 4 cups of red peppers.  No problem with the jelly setting.  I used 1 - 57g package of certo if that helps.  I also pulsed the red peppers in a food processor and drained slightly prior to cooking.  I will definately make this again.

I loved this jelly!  I hate runny jelly and after reading other reviews about adding an additional pack of Pectin, or not... I opted to make this recipe with 1 and a half packs.  I also let it boil for about 10 minutes.  Consistancy was excellent, just they way I like it! It was delicious... will definately make again!

I always double the pectin and let it boil a bit longer to be on the safe side.  This recipe is AWESOME!!!! Also, I use all kinds of peppers-whatever I pick from the garden-hot and spicey every time!

Have not made this recipe yet, but in past I've found that if you make sure it comes to a rolling boil (will not stir down) then start your timing of 2 minutes cooking, it will set for you. On subbing stuff, I had some Raspberry-Jalapeno Jam at some show that was great.

I halved this recipe but still used a full pack of pectin.  The jelly set up nicely.  It wasn't spicy enough for my taste so next time I will add more jalapenos.  Other than that, it's a great recipe. Even my husband who had claimed he didn't like pepper jelly liked it.

Excellent base recipe.  I used 2 green bell peppers, 2 red bell peppers  to make 4 cups total.  I used 6 serrano and 3 jalapeno peppers  to make 1 1/2 cups total.  Also, it needs to have a box and 1/2 of Sure jell or 1 1/2 pks of liquid pectin   

We could not wait very long and my husband and I ate 1 jar in about 3 hours.  Just yummy with cream cheese, chips or crackers.  Such a quick appetizer for company too.  It truly is addicting!

This was a really nice jelly. I read other reviews that said it did't jell, but mine did. I was soupy at first, but once it sits in the jar for 24 hours it has the perfect consistency. It wasn't as hot as I expected, next time I will add more jalapenos.

I used 3oz. Liquid pectin and patted dry all peppers.  I also used 1/2 C white vinegar and 1/2 C fresh lemon juice.  As I wanted a spicier jelly I used 4 large jalapeño peppers, 2 Serrano peppers, and 1/2 sweet green pepper to measure 1 and 1/2 C green pepper mixture. I seeded only half the hot peppers and it was perfect for my family. I used the same amount of sugar and followed instructions for liquid pectin. Twice a success!!  Made 6 half pints.

This is addicting on cream cheese with crackers! The recipe worked perfectly for me, yielding a jelly that is slightly softer than common jelly recipes, but to put over the cheese, you won't want it any more jelled. Try it, it's fantastic!

Just made this yesterday, and it was my first ever attempt at canning or making jelly and it turned out great. I used a variety of hot peppers from my garden, anchos, anaheims, jalapenos and 4 habeneros. I even added 2t of ceyenne pepper flakes for some added spice. I didn't add any sweet peppers at all. I used pomonas pectin, and it jelled up perfectly, it's actually a little too firm once it's been in the fridge. Of course I had to figure out how my pectin to add since it doesn't work exactly the same as other pectins. I also probably should have reduced the amount of sugar since not as much is needed with pomonas, and I would have liked the jelly to be spicier. I'll try it again with more habeneros and less sugar.

I've made this recipe three times now due to an overabundance of cowhorn and cayenne peppers in the garden, and its been great each time.  I have had absolutely no issue with it no setting up...though the second batch did take almost 2 days to set. (I drained this batch so as to have a more clear jelly, though, so I figure this might have affected the set).

I have cut the sugar by a bit over half each time, as I like my jelly hotter - and less sweet.  TIP - if you want it to be hotter - leave in more seeds.

Made this recipe with my mom and sister this summer. It has become a huge hit with my family and anytime we go to a party we are asked to bring our hot pepper jelly! We've also given this jelly as gifts to friends and family. This will be something we do together for years to come. We were very happy with the consistency and flavor of the jelly.

Used a very similar recipe but had 6 1/2 cups sugar. Set up perfectly but the peppers did float to the top. When I opened them to serve I mixed the peppers and they stayed mixed.

This is great tasting pepper jelly and I get raves with it. The only problem is it did not set up. Next time I will do as others have mentioned and use 2 packages of powdered pectin.

Although spicy is not my taste I have friends here at work that love it, so I attempted this recipe as secret santa gifts.
I used 3 jalapeno's and 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper and although it has a bit of a bite, it wasn't too hot, even for me. For the spicy palate I would add more heat!
I did strain the peppers in cheesecloth because of some of the reviews mentioning gel problems, but a bit too much! I ended up having to add some water. I also used 2 pkg. of pectin. Mine gelled very well, actually I'd like it less gelled.
Overall, not a bad recipe.
Thanks!

The pepper jelly is excellent. I decreased the  jalapeno to 1 pepper and increased the red/green peppers to compensate.  I also drained the peppers after chopping in the food processer. I had no trouble with it jelling.  It turned out perfect!

Just made this, I didn't read the reviews or I might have added more sure-jell but the jars have already sealed so I will check one in the morning but I think they will be ok. I used fresh peppers. I used what was left in the pot after filling 8 8oz jars on cornbread tonight and it was amazing!

I added 1 1/2 pkg of sure-jel and more jalapeño than recommended, plus I did strain with cheesecloth as many had suggested. Very pleased with the results!!now don't have to pay $10 per jar for this yummy stuff!

anyone who has this not set should simply switch to Pomona brand pectin and use about 3 tsp calcium water and 2 1/2 tsp pectin. 
Pomona gives you much better instructions and I have not ever had a jelly or jam not set. You can thank me later ;-)

Great recipe. I used 2-1.75 oz packs of jell and a full cup of jalapeños.  Everything jelled and I almost got the heat I wanted

Yup, I too loved this recipe, as did many of my coworkers. I followed the other suggestions and used two packages of the 1.75oz powdered pectin and got a great gel consistency. Also, I drained the bell peppers after chopping them. My final adjustment was using super chills instead of jalapeños but really any hot pepper would probably be fantastic. Great recipe for a first time jelly-maker and canner like myself.

This is a favourite of everyone who tries it and I grow a variety of peppers so I can put aside lots for gifts.  I process it a little differently and get a perfect set every time and minimal floating of the peppers. I use a food processor to chop the peppers fine, let it sit for 5 minutes and then drain any liquid. I put the sugar, peppers and apple cider vinegar in a heavy pot at maximum heat and stir until it is to a full, foamy boil. I stir for an additional minute, remove from heat and then stir in the liquid pectin. I stir and skim foam for 5 or 6 minutes and then pour it into the jars.  I use Certo liquid pectin. It has never failed me!

This is delicious!  As suggested by others I increased the jalapenos to 1c leaving the ribs and seeds for some warmth.  I had no setting problem with the 3 batches I've made so far over the past 2 weeks using the same ingredient measurements as stated -measuring 4c total of peppers and hand-fine-cut the peppers. The jelly looks beautiful with the peppers suspended throughout. I would suggest NOT to add food coloring.  The natural colors look very festive and I would imagine more appetizing.  I have served this with cream cheese and also with extra sharp cheddar & buttery type crackers (ritz, townhouse).  I am happy to have found a new tasty homemade Christmas gift for friends. I am sure it will be well received. :) Thank you!

Wonderful stuff.  I had no problem with it setting up.  Make sure you bring it to a FULL ROLLING BOIL before starting to count time.  If you have never done jelly before, you may not know that isn't just when it starts bubbling, but when it is white and foamy on top.  I also chopped my peppers by hand.  I used mostly Hungarian wax peppers, and then used regular bell peppers to bring my total amount of peppers to 4 cups.  Can't wait to get some bagels and cream cheese to eat with this.

I listened to the other reviewers.  I used my food processor (which made it really easy), but then put in a mess drainer and pushed a lot of the liquid out. Then I took a handful and gave it another squeeze. 
Instead of vinegar, I used Riesling wine.  I processed half and then trying in inverting method.

Also, I'm wondering if people realize that a rolling boil, is not just a boil, but when you stir it, the liquid continues to boil.  My consistency is great!

This recipe is Awesome. I've been using it for 3 years now and selling them at local farmer's markets. I do use 2 packs of pectin and use half a cup of jalapeno's instead of a fourth cup. I've made an all green and an red pepper version.  The all red peppers makes a very pleasing looking jelly. People think I am using food coloring but I don't. At a half cup of jalapeno's per batch it's a medium-hot flavor.

I only gave it 4 stars because, as others noted, it did not set. Well when given lemons make lemonade came to mind. As a thick syrup it mixes easily with soft cream cheese for a great dip. I used it the other night on a pork loin. When it was a few minutes from being done I glazed it with the syrup and have received great feedback. I used serrano peppers due to the abundant production of my single plant. ready to put some more up as a syrup and then maybe add pectin and make some jelly.

This made a very pretty batch of pepper jelly. I made with two boxes which made this too thick for my liking so I will make again with one box only. I chopped the peppers with a pampered chef chopper - it does it quickly without causing too much juice. I also will use more hot peppers and less bell to create a little more heat. Thanks for the recipe.

Made again 9-24-10 and only used one box as recipe indicated. By next day it had jelled very nicely. Chopped again with hand chopper which caused very little juice. This is a keeper.

I have found that no matter what recipe you use for pepper jelly, you need to boil it down to make it set. I also would fill my jars & check them everyday to see if they were set....no such luck! Now I add 2 boxes of powdered pectin AND boil it down for about 45 minutes. It seems to be the only way to get it to set! Great taste, though!

Fantastic Taste!  This was my first jelly-making experience.  Since a lot of reviewers said the jelly did not set up properly, I decided that instead of doubling the pectin I would use less of the other ingredients.  I ended up with about 2.5-3 cups of finely chopped peppers, and used the whole 1 c cider vinegar and 5 c white sugar.  This caused my jelly to be a little over-jelled for my preference.  Next time I'll actually try the recipe the way it is written.  Very great taste though!

I made this with red bell peppers and hot carribean red peppers (seeded). I added an extra cup of sugar and 2 pkgs of sure gel and it turned out fabulous. Very hot, but wonderful and a beautiful bright red.

I just made two batches.  Each time I had some mild and some hotter peppers but I did increase the amount of total hot peppers to 3/4 cup and subtracted the amount from the total bell peppers.  I added a half clove of minced garlic to each and to one batch I added about a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger.  Both batches turned out great.  I really like the ginger flavor as a change of pace. The loose gel is nice for using with soft cheeses as you don't have to spread it.

Fabulous taste but glad I read the reviews!  I used 3 cups red peppers & 1 cup cayenne plus 2 packages of the sure-jell pectin right away.  Came out perfect!  Although my next batch I may use even a little more cayenne.  Even using a whole cup it had just a little bite but not what I'd call hot.

I was emboldened to add 2 cups fresh chopped jalapenos after reading another reviewer's comment.  It was not too hot - I loved it.  It set up a little softer than other jellies, but I like the consistency.  11/19/11:  With new crop of peppers, this time I made all red hot pepper jelly.  Used 2 medium sized bell peppers and about 20 hot red Thai peppers with seeds, all adding up to a generous 2 cups of peppers.  I added a couple drops of red food coloring. This time, I strained the jelly, and it is absolutely beautiful and amazing.  I can't wait to bring out jars of green and red jellies for Christmas!  Incidentally, it is already setting up great.  I think people are not waiting for the "rolling boil", and that is causing their problems.

Very good and pretty. I too strained the peppers after they'd been chopped up (I food processed them) and used 2 pkg pectin (liquid).  it's very pretty and has set up nicely. Good flavour.

very good.. but I call this HOT PEPPER SPREAD..It seems to be a little thin but still works well on cream cheese.. I do cook for 2 min and do use MCP brand pectin if I want it thicker.. MCP has never failed me... but still takes this recipe a few days to set firm.. also add more hot pepper to make a little hotter.. thanks for sharing this recipe..

Like this recipe, but need to boil 2 minutes instead of 1 minute to keep from being so runny and have found MCP Pectin to work the best..also added more jalapano peppers with a few seeds...  also added an additional 1/2 cup sugar.. this recipe is great on cream cheese.

I used fewer jalapenos because we like a little nip but not real hot.  This is great.  I have it on toast almost every morning.  I am already on my second recipe.  Great on Cream Cheese and crackers as an hor doerve.

Excellent, excellent taste - and it is not hot at all. I made a second batch and added 2 more jalepenos - and left the seds in those - still not very hot. Very pretty and very good - just not hot!

This jelly is amazing!  I doubled the recipe since I was making enough to give away for gifts and here are the amounts that I used:
-6 cups green bell pepper, chopped fine
-2 cups jalapenos, chopped fine
-2 cups apple cider vinegar
-2 packages (1.75 oz) powdered pectin (I used Sure Jell)
-10 cups white sugar

1 - Mix chopped bell peppers, jalapenos, apple cider vinegar and sure jell in large pot over HIGH heat.
2 - When it reaches a boil, BOIL for 3 minutes.
3 - Mix in sugar and continue to stir until sugar is melted.
4 - Bring to a rolling boil and continue stirring for 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.
5 - Ladle jelly into jars. leaving 1/4 inch head space.
6 - Process jars for 10 minutes in hot boiling water bath.
7 - Cool jars overnight on counter and label.
8-Store in cool, dry place for up to 1 year.

Makes approximately 12 (1/2 pint) jars.

If following this recipe. . .make sure you use Sure Jell. . .because despite what the other reviews say. . .MY jelly turned out BEAUTIFULLY!

This sweet heat pepper jelly is fantastic! I followed the others' suggestions and used two boxes of pectin. I used a mandoline to slice the peppers small. After cooking for about 10 minutes in the cider vinegar, I pureed the peppers, but left some of the sliced (white) hot peppers aside and added towards the end of cooking to give the jelly a little texture. CAME OUT ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! THANKS ALLRECIPIES and REVIEWERS!!!!

I just made this recipe today. Peper Jelly is the only thing I can every year. With that said, I used this recipe because it called for powdered pectin and I normally use liquid pectin. I have never used powdered pectin until today. 
Of course I changed a few things...First of all, I used only jalapeno pepper, 2lbs. I removed most of the seeds but left some for a little heat. Next, put all the peppers in my food processor with half the vinegar. Then I added the pepper mixture to my large stock pot with the remaining vinegar and added one box, 1.75 oz, of the powder pectin. The rest of the recipe I followed to the "T" with the exception of doubling the other ingredients...WITH THE EXPECTATION IF THE PECTIN...I only used the 1.75 oz box. I have read that some other users cant get their jelly to set. Mine worked perfect! I think the key that might be getting missed is that when you add the sugar, make sure it returns to a full boil. It takes a little while for the mixture to return to a boil. DO NOT add the sugar and let it sit for one minute...get it back to boiling.  Considering that I doubled the recipe but used a single recipe amount of pectin and it worked...I think this recipe is great! I think I actually like the powder form better then the liquid. This jelly is delicious with some cream cheese and crackers. It's a great appetizer to have for the holidays when you have guests over.

This is a very good recipe. I loved it. The first time I made it I added 1 1/2 boxes of pectin after reading the reviews. But that was too much. It was too stiff  but had an excellent flavor.  So the second time I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I don't believe the people whose jelly didn't set let it boil for the minute. It has to be at a hard boil while you are stirring for a solid minute. Thanks for sharing.

Made two batches of this jelly, using chili peppers instead of jalapeno peppers.  First batch was runny, so added more pectin to the second batch along with more chili peppers.  Taste is awesome.

This recipe was amazing!!!!!! Love the flavor! I did take others suggestions as stated. 1.) I drained the peppers as I was cutting. I put them in a strainer until I had them all cut and were ready to go in the pan. 2.) I used 2 packets of pectin instead of just one. Adding it right at the beginning was crucial. Turned out great. Looking forward to using these as Christmas gifts, also!

I have made this jelly at least 8 times. Everyone at home and work seems to love it. I have not had any problems with it setting. I think the problem might be the misconception of a rolling boil. A rolling boil is a boil that is so aggressive that it cannot be disrupted by stirring. I think if you make sure it continues to boil even after stirring you may be successful at making this jelly.

I followed some of the suggestions given here and used 4 tablespoons of pectin instead of 3 1/2. It still came out slightly runny. I opened one and put it in the fridge and it firmed up quite nice. I'm going to try it with the other jars.

YUM! I followed the recipe as written with the only changes being:
1. Used 1 package of pectin and boiled for 2 minutes.
2. After cutting all the peppers, I put them on paper towels to drain for almost 2 hours..changing the paper towels as needed. This really helped the jelly get the right consistancy. I'm already anticipating making another batch....THIS WONT LAST LONG!

I have NEVER made jelly in my life and no one has ever told me how to make it. I am happy with the way this came out.  I reviewed all the comments made about this recipe. I made two batches of this.

First time I followed the recipe as is. It was a bit running and didn't set as well as I had hoped. The taste was a bit bitter and very sweet for me. 

The second batch I made the following changes.  I added a total of 3 onunces of the liquid pectin. I also got rid of the access water after chopping by placing into paper towels and aqueezing. The second boil with all ingredients I did 2 minutes. I decreased the amount of sugar to 4 1/2 cups. The vinegar I did 1/2 distilled vinegar and 1/2 cup lemon juice! I let set overnight and it turned out awesome.

This is great! I have never made pepper jelly and I searched and searched. I decided on this one and I am so glad I did. My family likes things very hot, so I made a couple of changes. I used 1 cup of jalapenos, 1 cup of green pepper and 2 cups of red peppers. This way the total amount of peppers is the same. I didn't have any problems with it setting and it is beautiful in the jars. I used powdered pectin and I didn't have any setting up problems.

I followed others recommendation to increase pectin and it turned out too thick...next time I will use the recommended 1 box or maybe 1 1/2. Also, it was super sweet with very little heat.

Made this jelly today. Only used 3/4 cup each of red and green bell pepper, then used only one average sized habanero pepper and then about 1/8 of a second one, so not much.  Everything else I followed the recipe for.  I also hand cut all of the peppers fine, but the habanero I very, very thinly sliced it and then cut it fine.  Mine set up quickly and easily, no problems at all.  It made four 8oz jars with a couple of tablespoons left over. The flavor is awesome, I promise!!!!  I did not use and don't recommend putting any food coloring in it like some people may do, the red and green colors from the peppers with the almost apple jelly background color is beautiful just like it is.  I give this recipe with my minor adjustments, a 5 star rating!! Thanks!

This recipe was great.  I am just a beginner at this and I added the sugar in the beginning instead of waiting for the vinegar, pectin and peppers to boil.  The first batch is runny and I'm praying that it hardens as it cools.  However, the 2nd batch I made I followed directions and it was much thicker.  I DID add the 2 boxes of pectin as people suggested I agree that it needs it!  Farmer's Market here I come!  :)

This is a great recipe indeed, I used all sweet red peppers instead of a mix since that is what my family asked for. Like the other reviewers suggested, I used two boxes of pectin instead of one. Also, after boiling the jelly hard for one min (while stirring) I always remove it from the heat and then stir constantly for 3-5 mins. I can't remember where I read this tip, but it cuts down on the "scum" and helps the jelly set up. I haven't had a problem yet, unless I make a rookie mistake and don't add enough sugar!

I paid attention to the previous reviewers' suggestions to drain the peppers & increase the boiling time, and it turned out great!  I just used a combination of sweet red peppers and green & red jalapenos from our garden, and the result is delicious and very pretty, too!

I loved this recipe but I am rating it only 4 stars. 1. I thought the taste was really good but there was no heat at all. Maybe it was my jalapenos but I  would have liked some heat to it. 2. While it was not the fault of the recipe submitter I am afraid I listened to all the reviews that said to use 2 pkg of pectin instead of 1. I think it was to thick for my taste. Overall though really good.

Okay, after much research around the web, it seems that everyone has trouble with this setting, including me.  I suspect that some peppers have an enzyme that keeps this from setting properly some of the time.  Some peppers seem to be fine and it sets well, others won't set no matter how much pectin you use.  So it's like roulette.  But darn this is good!  My son gobbled jar after jar of this stuff.  If I could figure out what makes this NOT set, I'd have quarts full of it.

With the doubled pectin, this was exactly what I was hoping for.  Although next time I'll add a bit more jalapenos to give it a bit more of a kick!

I always use liquid pectin and when the recipe calls for one package, I use l-l/2.  I have never had a problem with setting jelly.  If the jelly is too firm, then before I put on the cream cheese, I microwave it for 25 seconds.

I gave it four stars based on flavor.  I could not get this to set up properly.  The flavor is good.  I increased the jalapenos to 1/2 cup and it was still not hot enough.  Pretty color and my peppers are floating throughout the mixture, not just on top.  Overall a good recipe will try again another time to get it to set.

I have made this recipe 4 times, the 1st time it did not set up well, you need to drain the peppers well after they are chopped.  Tastes great, I have been trying to get it hotter since I'm using peppers from the garden and my hot peppers are only mildly hot.

This is quite tasty.  All it needs is a little more jalapeno for me, but perfect for my friends who like it less hot.  A keeper!

This turned out wonderfully!  I was very nervous after reading the reviews that people were having problems with it being runny, mine was set up after about 5 hours and just perfect!  Thanks for such a great recipe, everyone loves it and I'm going to make more this weekend! Thanks again.

I think I will strain out the peppers before putting in the jars.  The peppers got small and whimpy after cooking anyways and they all floated to the top.  Overall, the jelly was not very hot.  I am gonna play with the recipe a bit.

Didnt really change it much - tried adding more jalapenos to second batch to make it have more heat, flavor is wonderful, but getting heat amount right might take more practice!

A word of advise. When chopping hot peppers wear plastic/rubber gloves! AND don’t touch lips, eyes or scratch your nose or any other body part. I made this mistake and paid the price. Use 2 pectins and verify “use by” date.

Made this twice. The both times I followed the instructions as written. 

The first time, I canned in 4 ounce jars and it turned out perfect. Was very happy since it was my first time making pepper jelly. 

The second time, inhad a hard time with it forming up so I reheated (before processing it) and added a 2nd box of pectin and it formed right up. 

Very happy and can't wait to make it again.

I saw all the reviews about not setting up so I used a thermometer and made sure it got to 220 degrees Fahrenheit and kept it there for a minute before pulling to fill jars.  I did use Hoosier Hill Farm fruit pectin and it set perfectly. I used 2 cups red bell peppers, 2 cups jalapeno peppers, the taste was perfect for me, but my DH could have used more heat.

Made two batches of this jelly today. I had no problem with it  setting properly.  I diced my peppers small. And used sure jel powdered pectin.    There is a little bit of a kick from the vinegar but that just adds to the flavor and gives it a bit of a bite which is delicious with the warmth of the peppers.     You can use this to make an awesome cream cheese dip.  Also love it as a ham glaze.

So, this was my first attempt at any sort of jelly, jam, etc.  I was expecting the jelly, once cooled, to be a bit firmer in the jar.  For my recipe I used homegrown Poblanos, Jalapenos, Italian Hot, and Cubanelles.  It was just at 5 cups largely chopped, but reduced to about 3 cups once finely chopped.  That's where this recipe needs clarification.

I put a mix of peppers from my garden and added 3 green peppers to get to 4 cups.  Seeded too many peppers so heat was not there like I would have  wanted.   Put them in a Ninja and pulsed until all was well ground to about 1/4 or less inch pieces.   Put it in cheese cloth and squeezed out all the liquid, left in a colander overnight.  Followed these directions , did the Sure-Jell, to a boil,  added 4 1/2 cups of the sugar and let it boil for 2 minutes then off the heat, canned and water bath.  Turned out excellent and jelled.      I had added 4 cloves of garlic and a teaspoon of all spice but did not notice it.   Will do this again..

Not sure if I will do this one again, flavor good but not great. Did not st up, had to re boil and add another box and a half of pecton . That did make it set. Its not hard to make but I think if I did it again I may try 1/2 vinegar  and 1\2 lemon instead of  1 cup vinegar.

After reviewing some of the comments, I was worried it would not set up. As I fine-chopped the peppers by hand I put them in a colander to drain off excess juice. Once I added the sugar and brought it to a boil, I let it boil hard on high heat while stirring constantly for two minutes. Steamy! Once in the jars with lids tight, I boiled submerged for ten minutes. Let set up overnight. Turned out great!

I read the other reviews and stuck with the recipe as called for.   After chopping the peppers I did squeeze all the moisture out  that I was able too.   I also let it boil  rapidly after adding the sugar for several minutes.   I’m not a fan of spicy so I enjoyed the lack of heat but would add more heat the next time.   Will try again with differing combination of peppers

requested by friends and family all year.  I've also changed the recipe occasionally to include whatever fruit is in season - peaches, apricots, berries, etc.  DELICIOUS!

I used only green bell peppers and jalapeños. Followed rest of recipe and jelly  set up while still warm! The next time I food-processed 12 jalapeños (seeds and veins), one large yellow bell pepper (no seeds) in 1 1/2 cups of apple cider vinegar for 5 minutes then strained in a pot. I boiled the liquid for about 10 minutes until I got down to 2 cups of liquid. I then dissolved the pectin powder and used only  4 cups of sugar to get 7 X 4-ounce jars of jelly. Got a nice pale-green jelly that starts out tasting sweet then got a surprising  after burn!

Because of all the sugar I should have realized it would be mostly sweet using sweet peppers. It was very good but next time I will use all hot peppers as my family likes a kick. The review said "spicy treat" so I expected some spice & there was none following the recipe but it was good.

I made this this afternoon - still waiting for it to set. It seemed a bit thin, but after reading other reviews,  I will be patient and wait. I have a half a jar in the fridge (now) that set up on the counter just fine.  Also should note, I filled 4 jars worth, then had to wait to fill 2 more. The four I filled right away have the pepper pieces floating near the top, but the two jars that sat in the pot a bit until I had room, those have the pepper pieces evenly dispersed.

Why is the rating on this recipe so high?  Just like most of the rest of the reviewers, there is not enough pectin and there is very little hot pepper flavor.  I had to open up all of those jars and make over.  That's what i get for looking at ratings and not reading the reviews.  Please fix this recipe!

Delicious, but did not set up to a jelly consistency. I have been using as a sauce ...for everything!  Used it over baked chicken legs and even marinated sliced strawberries in it and spooned them over slices of cheesecake. Will double up on the pectin for  the rest of the batches I make.

Didn’t set properly. 

I make a TON of jam/jelly and never have this problem. Next time I’ll increase pectin quantity.

Quick Tips/Notes:

• Utilize whatever mix/match of peppers you have. 
• Cut off tops of peppers, basic deseeding and rough chop before food processor
• Utilize food processor - measure peppers after chopping
• Can be doubled for 12-jar batch

Quite good - forgiving.  Don't be afraid to use whatever garden peppers you have on hand.  YO

Perfect. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and chopped the peppers by hand instead of in a food processor and it jelled perfectly. This is a very sweet jelly

Had to make a few tweaks with bell pepper vs jalapeño pepper ratio but all came out well. Did not put any seeds in for the faint of heart so is mild.

I probably should have seeded the jalapenos-it's a bit spicy but I can serve it w/ice cream or over brie/goat cheese/cream cheese. Recipe was very easy.

This is a terrible recipe. Way too much red and green peppers. That is all you can taste. The only change I made I increased the  jalapeños from 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup.  All I taste is the red & green bell peppers. No heat at all. I will look for another recipe.

I have made this a couple of times this winter -- my husband keeps asking for cornbread and then wiping out my stock of pepper jelly.  I did have to make some changes... I increase the volume of bell peppers and cider a little , strain the solids through cheesecloth after they have simmered for about 20 minutes and use 6 oz. of liquid pectin.  I also add  1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes to each jar before I fill them.  It sets beautifully and boy, is it good!

I tried this recipe and it worked great for me!  It’s not as spicy as I’d like it to be so I’m making another batch this weekend and adding more jalopeno.  I didn’t have any issues with consistency as others have mentioned.  I boiled it longer than the suggested time frame in the recipe so maybe that made the difference.

Definitely a keeper recipe!

I used a package of powdered pectin to a doubled recipe. Turned out great, I had help with the chopping of the vegetables, so that helped. The only thing I’d change is to cook the vegetables a bit longer.

I used the amount of peppers called for. I doubled the pectin amount. I used Ball brand pectin on the first batch and it set well, but the peppers stayed more to the top of my jars. On the second batch, I used Sure Jell Premium pectin (yellow box) and the peppers distributed evenly in the jars. Again, I doubled the pectin amount and it set well. I am a beginner to canning and it was my first try at pepper jelly! Very pleased and got great reviews!

works perfect! the key is to know and understand that you must come to a rolling boil!! twice! rolling means when you go to stir it ,  it doesnt stop bubbling at all.  after the sugar is added you must bring it back up to boiling.  And be sure to measure well. 
the beauty of this simply recipe is that you can go with different peppers, as i did.  I can make it super hot or incredibly mild to basically no heat at all.  As long as you keep the correct measurment. Happy cooking!

I made it with a variety of peppers. Syrian black finger peppers, Trinidad scorpions, habanero, corno de Toro, and Jimmy nardelo . Very nice. It isn't as hot as the peppers you add. It captures the flavor of them yet not all of the heat . I ate a half jar of it when it was cooled. I'm making more for Xmas presents.

If you have one, use a candy thermometer. If you like it firm, then boil until the temp reaches 220 degrees (jelly stage). If you like  more of a sauce, then don't let the temp get that high in the final boil. I chop with a food processor and squeeze out all the excess juice first, and let the rolling boil go for at least 2 minutes in any event.  I like it both ways.

I had a lot of roasted Hatch peppers that a friend gave to us. I substituted the Hatch peppers in place of the red peppers as this was the closest recipe I could find for hot pepper jelly. It's a great recipe and it worked perfectly! I am very thankful for this recipe and printed several out for future use.

Perfect! Set beautifully using sure-jel.  I know most people eat it w/ cream cheese and crackers, but we love it on a peanut butter sandwich. If it sounds weird, think of Thai food with peanuts and hot peppers. Really yummy!

I'm only giving this a three because the flavour is there. I've tried this twice now and both times the jelly did not set. Very disappointing. The first time I followed almost exactly using liquid pectin instead of dry. Today I increased the pectin to two pouches and squeezed out about half the liquid from the peppers and again it didn't set. I will try and salvage the new batch but will look for a different recipe.

The secret to this recipe is cheesecloth. You MUST drain the excess liquid from your peppers (most easily done by wrapping it in cheesecloth and squeezing the heck out of it) if you want this recipe to set up.  It simply has too much water otherwise.

I Agree with Bambi...I used 2 boxes of pectin and 4 cups sugar and it was perfect!!! I used 1/2 cup of jalapeno with mixed red and orange peppers,  jelly was not overly sweet and had a nice  warmth from the jalapeno...loved it......

This was amazing. My son-in-law said it is the best he has eaten, including at trendy restaurants!  The only thing I added was about 5 small Serrano peppers (at my mother-in-law's request). I puréed the peppers and vinegar, and boiled everything except the pectin for 10 min., then added the pectin and boiled exactly 5 minutes, all suggestions from other reviewers. It set up PERFECTLY! I gave my daughter and son-in-law small jars to give away if they thought it was good. They QUICKLY passed them on to friends and asked for the recipe. Winner!

I think this is a great recipe! I did not drain my peppers at all. There was a little bit of juice due to dicing the peppers but it didn't seem to be a problem. I suspect that the problem people are having with it setting could be a couple of different things. One – possibly using the wrong type of pectin. There is a pectin that is intended for freezer jam and it will not work with this recipe. Two - make sure that you are bringing it to a full rolling boil that doesn't stop boiling when you stir it. Because of that you want to be sure that you are using a pot that is big enough to handle the boiling. I'll make this again!!

I love the flavor of this pepper jelly! I like it hot, so I left the seeds in the jalapenos.  I also prefer to use my kitchen scale to weigh the peppers before putting them in the food processor to mince, so I don't have any waste.  The quantities were: 
Red bell (seeded and quartered) 500 grams; 
Green bell (seeded and quartered) 250 grams;   
Jalapeno (halved, seeds not removed)  50 grams.   
I chose to not give all five stars only because I would have liked the jelly less runny.  I wonder if I had not simply allowed the mixture to come to a rolling boil for one minute and instead had let it boil until it reached 218-220 degrees F, would I have had better results.  I guess I'll try that method next time.  It is quite delicious and will be my go to Pepper Jelly recipe, but I will tinker with the jellying.

This recipe is perfect as is. Do NOT change anything unless you want more heat. Hand chopping is a huge mistake. If you watch the video you will see how finely they chop the peppers. This is how they should be chopped for a perfect texture. If you hand chop, they will be too large and float to the top of the jar.  I used a food processor but didn't chop as fine because of suggestions on here. I couldn't stand the separation that happened because of not chopping them fine enough, so i did turn the jars upside down and shake after they sealed so the peppers mixed. It will appear very liquid when pouring in jars but will set up. Wait til they cool completely. Will definitely make again when this is gone and will chop FINELY.

I have made this receipe often, but with the following modifications: 
1. I add one cup of apple juice
2. I put all the pepper, vinegar and juice in the food processor to mash it up; I prefer that sort of texture and it serves beter
3. I use 4 cups of sugar
4. I use 2 to 3 tbsp of pepper flakes if I cannot find hot peppers
5. I put a whole envelop of pectin - about 2.34 oz
6. I boil longer than one minute - more like 3 being careful it does not boil over
7. I continue cooking at low temperature a good 5 minutes

My friends and family love it.  We use it as apero on cracker and a sharp cheese like cheddar, or soft one like cream cheese.  I have also served it with a brie en brioche.  I have also served it with meat and fish, if the receipe allows.

I'm not good at following directions. I used a mixture of colored peppers, more than recipe called for. 1/2 c. of jalapenos. Super easy , the only time consumer was dicing peppers. I think the problem with not setting is using regular sure jell, I used the less or no sugar version and it's perfect. The mixed colors make it so pretty. I don't know why I bothered putting it in jars because it's going to be used so quickly. My batch made 7 1/2 cups. Delicious!!! Addictive!!

Used mainly jalapeño peppers with one green bell pepper and pureed then in a food processor before cooking.  There was quite a bit of foam to skim before lading into jars.  Will be gifting some of these for the holiday.

I cooked down the mix more than what this recipe calls for. I also did a variety of peppers. It's a great place to start... however, cooking time is not correct , and for high altitude, the water bath should be 20 mins.

This is a great recipe.  It set perfectly.  For those whose jelly did not set up I'm guessing you didn't bring it to a full rolling boil (one that cannot be stirred down).  This is a most important step in making jams and jellies.  Also DO NOT reduce the amount of sugar - that will also cause the jelly not to set.

My husband loves this.  First time I made it he said it was great; I just made it again and he says this time it's excellent.  Changes I made were 2 red peppers, 1 green pepper, 8 jalapeno peppers and 2 cayenne peppers totally 4 cups.  I also changed the pectin amount to 9 T and final boiled for 3 or 4 minutes.

I will save this one.  I made a couple of changes.  I added more jalapenos (about 9) 3 lg mild peppers (1 green, 2 purple) and
8 long sweet reds.  Also 2 peaches, a bit of lemon juice.  I also used Dutch Gel pectin 1/c cup.  It made 9 8oz jars and it is delicious!  I will probably have to make another batch once my family discovers it.  I made these changes based on the experiences of others.  Good job!

We've made it four times, and followed changes in the comments - boiling for 2 minutes and increasing the amount of pectin to 9 T.  The last batch we used 8 T and it has come out great.  Our peppers were not very hot so we changed pepper ratio to 2 cups red/yellow, 1 cup green, and 1 cup hot.  In the hotter batches we added red food coloring.  It set up in no time, I had to open a jar the next day because we ran out of the extra and it was lovely.  It's a gorgeous jelly and tastes great!

I made this but went by some other suggestions. Cooked about 5 minutes at a furious boil after the sugar went in instead of the 1 minute the recipe states. Dropped a bit into a bowl and  tipped it and it had started to gel so was pretty sure it would set. Added more hot peppers  this time because the last time it was not as peppy as I would have liked it.  I also used a good 1/2 cup of powered pectin ( I buy mine in bulk) instead of the packet from the store that has 1/3 of a cup.

Recipe was easy to do and it helped to read the other reviews first. Used two boxes of pectin and boiled for a solid two minutes once it was all in and rolling. It set just fine and consistency was perfect. Flavor is very good. If you're looking for a kick you'll have to increase the amount of jalapeños. Keep the total at 4 cups though. Will definitely make it again and will spice it up too.

This wonderful jelly became a battle of the wills....( as in I WILL make this set  and it WILL be delicious)  The 3rd time it set.  I did reheat and add more pectin and water bath the jars each time the last time I put in two pkgs of liquid pectin....by that time I was so frustrated that I was either gonna have jelly or jalapeno gummis....Now I have a bunch of jelly that was supposed to be gifts now I wanna keep em! ;)

Verrrrry tasty. I varied the amounts/kinds of peppers, keeping the total quantity the same, and it was very good. FYI, I was only able to get 5 full jars to can, the 6th was a little over half, but we kept it in the fridge, and it disappeared. Serving suggestions: on buttered toast, especially good with sourdough or English muffins. Also great for dipping crackers when layered over sour cream.

I did double the pectin and it set up better, but even if this recipe doesn't set up, it tastes great and everyone loves it!!! I have used the runny batch as marinade for chicken with a little soy sauce, OMG!!!

Made this with 2 cups of jalapeno peppers and 2 cups of green peppers from my garden. Pulsed them a few times in the food processor and then strained them for a few minutes. I also used 2 boxes of pectin to be sure that the jelly would set. Came out beautifully. Best hot pepper jelly that I've made yet.

I used all red pepper and chopped everything by hand followed directions to the T and it turned out great, set up just fine and tastes wonderful with just enough heat. Will definitely be making this again.

I used the Sure-Jell recipe which is very similar to this one.  I used 2 large red peppers, 2 large green peppers, and 10 large jalapeno peppers.  I have made this many times and find that the jam does not set like other kinds of jelly or jam sets.  It tastes very good over cream cheese as an appetizer.   My kids love it and they get a couple of jars a year at least for Christmas.   I have been told that it is very tasty when poured over a pork roast as well during the roasting process.  I have not tried that yet, but I plan to.

I've made three different versions of this recipe by changing the types of peppers, and have had it set perfectly every time. The only change I would recommend is when it returns to a full rolling boil, boil it for two minutes, not one as stated.

I've made this several times, but today I made it out of necessity. Mangoes and peppers were both on special this week, and I had a couple of wrinkly mangoes and some over-the-hill peppers that needed to be used up. I just substituted mango for part of the chopped peppers and added some frozen Habanero peppers from our last summer's garden. This recipe always sets perfectly - I think you have to be very precise with the measurements and use a processor for chopping.

This is really good red pepper jelly, and this was my first time making red pepper jelly.  I followed the recipe but I ran out of apple cider vinegar so I had to use about 1/8 cup of rice wine vinegar for a substitute.  No difference in flavour that I can tell.  As others had done, I also added 1 1/2 packages of powdered pectin, but it is set up really firm.  I also used the food chopper/processor for about 3/4 of the peppers and hand chopped the rest really fine.  Next time, I will probably make the ratio with a bit more jalapeño for a bit more kick.  All and all this is a really good recipe.

I just made this jelly. Turned out beautiful. It was really easy. I chopped it all by hand, I prefer it over food processing.  I did add the equivalent of 2 packs of pectin and added some hot sauce and 2 Thai Chilies, which I took out before I filled the jars.

I made mine with red peppers and red jalapeños and a few red pepper flakes.  I mixed the sure jel with 1 cup sugar and added it to the red pepper mix and let it sit for 15 minutes.  Then i Followed the instructions, except I let it boil for 2 min.  No problem with setting.

Flavor is 5 star but needs adjustments. Use Low Sugar pectic and it will set perfectly, just follow directions and let pectin set in pepper/vinegar mixture 5-10 minutes before cooking. I also adjusted pepper to be one cup green and 3 cups red/yellow/orange and have added more jalapenos in some batches to make it hotter.

Made this and turned out great. I used 2 packages of pectin after reading others comments and it made a nice jelly consistency. I also added in some red chili flakes. Loved it, will be making this again :)

I made this a week or two ago, and I have gotten great reviews from everyone I gave a jar to.  The flavor was wonderful.  I used low sugar pectin with this recipe, and it set beautifully within a few hours.  Thanks!

This is my go-to pepper jelly recipe.  I use 4 cups of peppers, but vary the peppers depending on how many jalapeno peppers I get from the garden.  I've done as much as 3 cups of jalapenos and 1 cup of bell peppers (usually red for color).  And I leave in a lot of seeds because we like the heat.  I always can them in 4 oz jelly jars because a little goes a long way!  This year I'm giving them out to neighbors with a box of crackers and block of cream cheese.  Love this recipe!

this is the 3rd year I have made this recipe. Thought it was just me who couldn't get it to set. I think the hot peppers react to the pectin differently. I just call it "runny jelly", and everybody loves it. I go half and half on the hot peppers vs bell. Only use red hot peppers (Cherry ) with red bells, and Jalapeños with green bells, and I give out a Christmas as the jars look festive. Mind you with going half and half, the jelly is very hot, we serve with cream cheese on a cracker, perfect appetizer.

This is a very good jelly recipe! I would recommend  it to anyone that likes a bit of KICK with their sweet! It is just a shade runnier than I anticipated, so may add more pectin next time. Doubled the batch and it worked just great! Job well done!!!!

I have made this recipe 3 times now. My first time it didnt gel the way I had hoped. But in retrospect I may have not used enough pectin. I have used ball's no/low sugar pectin all three times. The last two times it jelled perfectly. The last two batches I used about 2-2 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 5. I have both used a food processor to chop the peppers and not, and prefer the food processor. You do need to make sure to drain the peppers. I am a big fan of chopping them up and freezing them, and taking them out when I have gotten enough to get the 4 cups needed for this receipe. The only thing I have noticed is that it is very pepper dense and not a lot of empty jelly (which is just fine for my consumers!). I also used the inversion method of canning this last recent time, and it worked great! I have found though that it does not make 6 jars though (but that may be do to my lack of sugar? Im not sure). I am also one to use whatever peppers I have lying around to get up to the 4 cups.

I didn't have trouble with it setting up .i had an one box of sure jell that was way out of date so I used that and one new one , it made a very thick jell .i did this because a lot of people said that it didn't set up. It could use more jalapeño then 1/4 cup so I put a heaping tea spoon full of red pepper  flakes and it could still used more . All in all I am happy with the way it came out. And will make it again but with more jalapeño and maybe some yellow peppers . I also didn't process it just sealed the jars and cooled . The tops are down so I guess it will be ok. Usually I use wax but decided not to this time.

This jelly is so delicious. I had no issues with peppers moving to the top, or with it not setting up. I see in one of the photos the peppers have floated, and those chunks are really large compared to what I used. So maybe people aren't chopping fine enough. I didn't even drain my peppers, just threw everything in the pot. Beware, the vinegar/pepper/pectin will boil very quickly! My jelly is a wee bit liquid after 24 hours (not much though), but another commenter said to wait 5 days or so for it to fully set. You have to use the larger package of pectin, I used the Bernardin one rather than the smaller Certo I had on hand.

I loved this recipe, but I made a few modifications: 
I used three large bell peppers (red, yellow, and orange) and juiced two jalapenos and one habanero for the spice. I will play with the type and amount of peppers in the future to get different flavors and colors. The recipe didn't have the right amount of pectin, so I doubled it like a few others commentators suggested and it was perfect.

Used 2 cups red peppers 1 cup green peppers and 1 cup mix of jalapeno and cayenne peppers drained. Left all the seeds from the hot peppers in and used 1 1/2 boxes pectin. For my 1st time I think it came out great not to hot it's sweet with a nice heat. This would go great with chineese food especially egg rolls. Can't wait to bring out a jar for the holidays. Thanks for an easy great recipe.

Tried it and all went well, it jelled using 3 tbls of low/no sugar powdered pectin and taste was as I thought it might be.  Only problem was the yield was only 3 pints.  I followed the recipe, used habanero and cayenne so it has a nice "kick" but only 1/2 the yield.  Any ideas what I did wrong?

This was my first time making jelly so the suggestions in the reviews really helped.  I seeded the peppers and cut into strips and used the food processor to finely chop peppers.  I used 2 cups jalapeno peppers and 2 cups assorted peppers (yellow, orange and red banana peppers, red bell pepper and green pepper (not bell).  I did drain chopped peppers before cooking them. I also boiled mixture for 2 minutes after adding vinegar, pectin and sugar.   I used the inversion method to seal the jars so I will find out in the morning if they sealed properly.  I hope the jelly sets up but even if it does not it tastes fabulous.  I can't wait to share my hot pepper jelly with friends and family.  They love my pepper relish.  My recipe actually made nine 8 oz jelly jars.

This was my first time canning hot pepper jelly and I LOVED the consistency of this recipe. It is more of a syrup than a jelly, which is what I grew up on. Definitely add more pectin if you want an actual "jelly" consistency. I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because it is very mild and I prefer hot pepper jelly to have more heat, but overall a very solid recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! Taught my mom how to can using this recipe. Some have said the had trouble getting this recipe to set. We used "low/no sugar needed" pectin. Maybe that's what did the trick, because ours set up beautifully. It did come out with tiny air bubbles. I've read that I may have let it cool too much before pouring into jars, or that adding butter may help prevent bubbles. Going to try that with my next batch, which will be soon, because this stuff is disappearing fast!

Recipe was great.  I had no problem with the recipe as written in regards to it setting up.  I as many others did played with the pepper varieties and just made sure it added up to 4 cups of peppers. I have received many compliments about this jelly and would make it again...if I can figure out my pepper mixture again.

This Jelly is delicious! I used Surejell.  The modifications were from other reviews.  I drained the peppers after chopping and boiled the mixture for 2 minutes.  It is a soft set jelly.

I made this recipe and it tastes just like I remember from the farmer's market in Birmingham as a kid.  I think many are confused by the name because it's called jelly.  The hot pepper jelly we had as kids was never set up.  It's just a syrup like consistency you pour over cream cheese and eat until you're sick with crackers.  The sweet and hot at the same time is so addictive.

I did have to add extra pectin but WOW it was worth making.  Even my picky husband scraped the bottom of the jar.  I will need to make extra for christmas time.

Oh my goodness. This recipe is sooo good! It is wonderful with cream cheese on crackers. It's hard to tell if it's sweet or spicy. But the combination is awesome!

I made three batches of this jelly and had no problems with it setting up.  I did make sure the peppers were well drained. I used sure-jell fruit pectin.  I was looking for a recipe for my serrano peppers and chose this one.  I used 1/4 cup serrano and 1/4 cup jalapeno and then adjusted the bell peppers to equal out.  For me I could make it hotter, but it was a great blend of flavors.  I took a jar to work with cream cheese.  Within minutes it was devoured.  My husband is taking a jar with cream cheese and crackers tomorrow.

This is an awlsome flavored jelly,I added a half teaspoon of ground smoked jolokia pepper and achieved the heat factor I wanted. I just wish I'd read more reviews on the jelling before I made this batch oh well it's still gooooood

I tried this recipe and many others for hot pepper jelly. I too have trouble getting it to set even when doubling the pectin, I think it's a chemical thing going on between the pectin and the amount of "HOT". doesn't matter though........it's a hit even when runny, will triple the pectin next time and see if that helps.

This is a great recipe.  Not as hot as I think a pepper jelly should be or that I have had before.  I gave these out to family and friends and they all enjoyed it. I'll be making it again.

I wish this had turned out!  I read the other reviews and took the advice of adding 2 boxes of pectin but it still did not set.  The peppers all floated to the top and it stayed runny.  I had hoped that it would have turned out as it smelled delicious.  Too bad :(

This stuff taste really good, but I have tried it twice and its to runny.  The last time I tried two packets of the sure-jell and it was still runny.  But it taste so good, so when I run out, I may try it again and use three, who knows.

I served this as an appetizer at Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it.  One person said that it was very addicting.
