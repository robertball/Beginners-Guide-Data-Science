Never have I ever put a cupcake in an ice cream cone. What a cute fun idea! My son rated them awesome! We just used regular frosting from the store to top these very yummy cupcakes. Would be great for a party! They may not all turn out "perfect", but they taste wonderful. My cones made less than the 24 listed in the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly. The batter leaked through the cones of most of them and the other ones overflowed and didnâ€™t cook through. In fact, some burned around the edges. Are some cones more superior than others? Was it the high altitude of the California mountains?
