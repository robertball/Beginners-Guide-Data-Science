It only took 30 minutes to cook (luckily I was watching since it came close to overcooking)and was easy to put together.  When I tasted it, I was disappointed.  The topping seemed to be lacking in tastiness in spite of having great ingredients.

It was very, very easy to make. The cake was very moist. I had some leftover crushed pineapple which I added to the frosting. It ended up a little lumpy but nice and pineappley!
