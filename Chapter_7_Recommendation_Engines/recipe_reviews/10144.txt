Directions for this recipe are incomplete!  Cooking time is NOT given and is a very
important function of the recipe.  As written this recipe will NOT turn out, it is
impossible to roll these into balls.  Butter, sugar, etc. must be cooked to a firm
ball stage.

There was no cooking time for the prune mixture so was unsure how long to have in double boiler.  The whole thing ended up being delicious but impossible to hold together.  I'm sure it had to do with how long it should have been on the stove.  Plus, it was incredibly messy to make!  Delicious, but not worth the hassle of figuring out how to do cleanly or how to long to cook.

This is a very easy recipe....I made a few changes because I like rum balls and my husband likes date ball I decided to make these as date/rum balls.  I added 1 teaspoon of rum extract and since my family does not like coconut I rolled mine in confectioners' sugar.  Yummy yummy!

I made these for my family at Christmas and they asked me to make them every year as a special treat. Delicious and freeze well too.

this was a nice recipe, i used orange zest instead of vanilla since i had none. could not make it into balls so i sprinkled coconut and walnust at bottom and top and cut into diamonds then placed them in muffin paper cups. looked very pretty with out the mess ! cut it when warm as it solidifies when cooled.

I was looking for a no bake recipe to make a quick dessert from all the dates I had just bought and this was perfect. These date balls remind me of Mary Jane candies.  Next time I will try this with cashews rather than walnuts!  I used pulverize graham crackers because I had no puffed rice, and because I think that vanilla dominates the subtle flavor of the dates I used 2 tbs of Marsala wine (which by the way tastes great just eating dates and sipping the wine). I also left off the coconut and rolled in powdered sugar.   I took the advice of another reviewer and used an ice water test to verify what "very thick" was. This stage in cooking just happened to be when my least dominant hand couldn't stir the pot any longer.  Great recipe!

These are great !  I double the recipe.   I cook in a normal pot not a double boiler.  I stir constantly and consider the mixture cooked when all is well combined and the mix no longer has distinct date pieces (the pencil shapes they were in from the store).   I form them in little logs rather than balls.  They look much hairier than the photo, maybe those were rolled in powdered sugar?

These have been in my family for years and we all (11 of us) love it.  Easy to make and always a favourite at Christmas.

Very good.  I make them every Christmas.  I use a little butter on my hands when I roll.  It help to keep the mixture from sticking to your hands, plus it keeps your hands from getting to hot when rolling.  You do not need a double boiler, but, it will not take 20 minutes if cooked on stove top.  As another reviewer said, when thick and the dates are melted.

This is a replacement for an "old faithful" recipe that went missing...it is easy, yummy & tastes just like "ol faithful!" Wet hands before rolling so the dates don't stick to your hands & roll easily :) I used vanilla & almond extract in 2 different batches, both yumm!

I have made this recipe again in 2019 for Christmas gifts. ( if I donâ€™t eat them first) I forgot the vanilla ( oops) and added 3 Tablespoons water, 1 more cup of the powdered sugar and then the coconut into the mix. Scooped out tablespoon  portions and put in freezer to harden slightly and then I will roll them in powdered sugar. YUMMY!
