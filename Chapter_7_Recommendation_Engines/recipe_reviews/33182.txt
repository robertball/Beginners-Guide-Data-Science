This recipe is just about perfect!  The parmesean dusting in the dish and the mustard give the souffle an extra kick, so my husband and in-laws really loved this souffle.  I've made this recipe numerous times and will definitely make it again!

We love this recipe, but it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to prepare.  Or I may be turtle woman.  So plan for more prep time, I'd say about 30 minutes.

This was my first attempt at a  souffle and it turned out perfect.  I omitted the ham and added sauteed fresh spinach and finely chopped onion plus a couple of dashes of worcestershire.

Delicious but didn't rise for me...not sure why. But I'll keep trying because we all enjoyed the taste.

My first Souffle -- and it was great!  We made with 4 eggs (6 servings I believe) and we didn't have ham -- it was easy and delicious.  The kids asked me to "please make it again!"  It's a winner!

I didn't really like it. I didn't have the ham, but it probably wouldn't have made a difference anyway.

I like the zing that the mustard and cayenne give to the souffle but mine did not rise properly.  Ive made souffle recipes for years and never had that happen before so Im not sure if it is the recipe or just a coincidence.  I have a few tried and true recipes that I prefer over this one so I do not plan on making it again.

The recipe was super easy!  I left out the ham, added salt and pepper, and substituted super sharp cheddar and twice as much, and it came out heavenly!  So light and airy!

Mine didn't rise either. I'm not sure what I did wrong. It was still delicious! I added spinach and used Cajun seasoning instead of cayenne. I will definitely make this again.

I have a ka-zillion cheese souffle recipes and this is by far the easiest and most popular with family!
I omitted the ham (although if I had some it's a great use for leftovers:) and probably doubled the cheese (cheddar/Swiss mix). Oh, I think I used Dijon and Tabasco Sauce rather than  French's and cayenne...
The grated Parmesan may have made the exquisite difference.
I used a 1 qt souffle dish, still it fit and rose and was enough for three of us.

Most successful soufflé I've made.  I doubled the recipe.  Raves from the family.  I'll use this recipe in the future.

I didn't cook the ham into the souffle on my first attempt. I didn't add any spices either but I would suggest white pepper and a bit more cayenne. Onions and spinach would be a great variation.

I didn't add the ham, I substituted more cheese instead.  Also added 3/4 tsp to the egg whites so they would stand up better.  Didn't line the pot with parmesan, I forgot all about that.  Turned out pretty good.

While I don't think I'd classify any recipe that calls for separating eggs and beating egg whites "easy" I followed this recipe step by step, only leaving out the ham to make it vegetarian friendly. It was lovely. The cayenne and mustard gives it just a little heat for pizzazz.

I've never made a souffle before and I had ham leftover from Christmas...All I can say is  Yummy.  Very easy to make but remember to temper your egg yolks or you'll just get scrambled eggs.  Not sure if everyone knows that and the recipe doesn't specify.  Also, I didn't let my roux get light brown but that didn't make a difference and it rose beautifully as my picture shows...
