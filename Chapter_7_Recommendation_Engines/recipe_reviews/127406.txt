I have only eaten this on cruises before and of course thought it was way too difficult to make. SO NOT TRUE. This was so easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except greased, buttered and dusted ramekins with a cocoa/sugar mix.  Baked for 12 minutes. The cakes slid right out. The next time I will skip the whipped cream and just sprinkle wiht powedered sugar.  I impressed myself. My husband is thrilled with the money he will save taking us on cruises to have this dessert.LOL.  Thanks so much.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I always order this dessert if I see it on a restaurant menu.  I made 12 cupcake sized cakes instead of 4 since they are so rich.  Satisfies the chocolate craving!

I think the bake time is way too long and the temp is too high. I made these twice, the first time I baked them 2 mins less than suggested and the middles didn't ooze and the edges were almost burnt. I did it again with the oven decreased to 350 and for 9mins. Better but still not quite. I am looking for something like Morton's Godiva chocolate cake. Maybe I will try again with some liqour added.

I love it! I've had a hard time finding a good molten cake recipe and this one is delicious and easy. I add a dash of salt to it (to enhance the chocolate) and serve with ice cream instead of Cool Whip.

I tried this recipe using semi sweet chocolate chips in place of the semi sweet baker's chocolate; it doesn't work.  The chocolate chips bake into the mix and the volcano doesn't erupt.  However, my Aunt said that they were the best brownies ever.

Tried this for the first time tonight and used the recipe as stated with the exception of the Cool Whip.  (I topped ours with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce drizzles.) 13 minutes at 425 worked exactly right for me, but I did follow suggestions and first checked at 9 minutes. Thanks for such a great and easy recipe.  My daughter said it was even better than Chili's! (Now THAT'S a compliment!)

Terrific taste, but I had to cook it only 10 minutes in order to still have a molten center.  Easier than some other recipes I've tried (and chocolatier).

Okay, I had to give this 5 stars because I made so many mistakes with the recipe and it stilled turned out delicious!  I am looking forward to making it again and actually following the recipe, I can't even imagine how good it will taste.  So my mistakes -- I used unsweetened chocolate instead of semi-sweet (not bad if you don't like overly sweet desserts, I think I might try 2 oz. of each next time) and I completely left out the flour!  The cakes came out as flat as can be but the taste was still yummy!  I recommend following the recipe exactly.

Brilliant recipe. It turned out awesome...ofcorse I also realised that for me...13 minutes is a bit much and 11 should do the trick, to keep the centre all flowy! I served this hot with a scoop of ice cream on top. It's to die for!! Will try this with dark chocolate the next time!! Thanks for the recipe!! :D

Too sweet and not chocolatey enough. I lowered the temperature since it just seemed to high. 350 seemed good.

These cakes are really easy to make and always turn out perfectly!  The powered sugar is a must (granulated sugar doesn't dissolve into the batter properly).   I usually make them ahead and cover them with plastic wrap, I let them come to about room temperature before baking.  Delicious!

I made this twice. Because I don't like the taste of too rich chocolate I only used 3 ounces of chocolate. And I just used 3 eggs and was skeptical at first but it turned out fine and delicious! This is the same recipe from kraft.

I made this for Valentine's Day dessert for my husband and myself. Since there are only two of us I halved the recipe, and made it in a Wilton valentine pan for small cakes that was pretty much the right size.  When halved, the recipe made two. It was a dark pan and when I used it before I had trouble with it burning so I actually baked these around 325, not 425. I think I ended up baking them around 10 minutes. They were PERFECT, just like something you would get at a restaurant.

I JUST made these and I used chocolate chips - store brand ones at that!  I really don't think it matters if you use chips, what I think matters is that you cook them according to the directions.  I made mine in a muffin pan and decided to try cooking at 375 b/c of the smaller size - that was a mistake.  When I took them out the first time the centers were molten but the cake was jiggly and stuck to the wrapper.  I think the higher temp is to get teh cake to cook quickly before the chocolate has a chance to bake into it.  I'll give this 5 stars if I make it again and cook as directed and it comes out perfect! Taste is awesome!

Perfect amounts for my four custard cups [that I'm finally using for the first time!] and super easy. I followed the recipe exact, including time an they turned out a bit dark.They were pretty good, but sadly the flavor was as intensely flavored as I was hoping.. The time as I see has been noted upon was indeed too long..It didn't 'flow' =( I think next time I'd try a different recipe. Thanks though!! Note- used Baker's chocolate

Make sure not to overcook these!  When cooked right, they're excellent - just like what you'd find in a restaurant.  Perfect with some raspberries or strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream.

We love this recipe, so simple and quick. And we don't have half a cake sitting around the counter for days begging us to eat it. We've got a couple different sets of custard cups and that seems to be a bigger effect on how long to cook these. One set we need to cook for 11 min the other set with thicker wall needs to cook for 13 min. Never tried cool whip as its just not allow in our kitchen ;) Ice cream and chocolate or raspberry sauce for us.

This is a super easy recipe.  I divided into 12 muffins and cooked for only 9 minutes.  That was too long.  The centers were a little gooey, but didn't ooze out like the picture.  I will try again.

So delicious, fast, and super-easy!! Added 2 tbls of vanilla extract . I also dusted the ramekins with cocoa as suggested by another reviewer.  Came out perfect and substituted cool whip for vanilla ice cream.  Faster to make and more delicious than cut/bake chocolate chip cookies. this is definitely a keeper!

WOW...WOW...WOW... this is amazing and so easy.  We too eat these on cruises and I never thought I would make it and it would turn out just as good but it does!  My super picky Dad was so impressed he had to tell everyone his daughter makes the molten cakes just like the cruise lines! Thanks for the recipe.

I used 5 oz. of chocolate and they are wonderful each time I make them.  13 min. @425* is about perfect for my oven.  They're now my go-to recipe when I need something that wows.

This cake was FANTASTIC! This was my first shot at it and it was phenomenal. I made 3 in a cupcake pan and 1 in a custard cup just to see the difference. The cupcakes came out excellent but the one in the custard cup I should have cooked for a few extra minutes longer. I wanted to give this a test run before I made them for my wifes baby shower that she will be having. She and my friend said that these were "delicious" and "addicting". I will definitely be making these for the baby shower and hope they all turn out to be as a big success as they were tonight. Thanks for the great recipe!

I fixed these cakes for my family on Valentine's Day and they loved it. I served it with vanilla ice cream instead of whipped cream. I followed the recipe exactly and they were so easy!

So good! I added a pinch of salt to balance out the sweetness. Perfect with a glass of milk. The only problem is that I always have the ingredients for these and will not be able to resist making them!

i followed the recipe and the flavor is terrific but for me the cooking time is either too long or the temp. too high. I used ramikins and cooked for 13 minutes and did not get a lava center. I will make again however will cook for less time

These bake up perfectly every time.  You may think the middle is too runny, but once you finish eating, you realize it was perfect.

Love this recipe - it looks fancy but is super easy. Tip - skip or minimize amount of flour if you like it more gooey (sounds strange - but is delish).  Sprinke with powdered sugar and fresh raspberries for an impressive finale to your dinner party!

Made this for a dinner party and it was gone within minutes.  I doubled the recipe to serve 8 and used fresh whipped cream.  So easy to make!

Yummy!  So good as is, no need for cool whip I sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Baked for 12 minutes in slightly greased muffin pan.

Wow.  this has got to be my favorite dessert ever.  and i can't believe i can make it anytime I want.  it tastes exactly like it does in the restaurants.  i also made it ahead of time, and then baked it later in the day.  this is definitely a keeper!

First of all, it looked absolutely delectable! The molten chocolate in the middle practically oozed out of the cake. I'm not a very experienced backer because I'm pretty young, but I was able to make this recipe and that's saying something. Thank you very much!

Easy, fun and delicious!  I made them exactly as the recipe states and everyone loved them!  My hubby asked how I got the fudge in the middle.  It is a lot like hot fudge in the middle and it goes great with ice cream!  I've also used the processed egg in a carton and they still turned out good (used half of an egg serving for the "whites"), but a bit different.

Oh my goodness! Know how quick and easy and good this was? I made mixed it up as an afterthought while my oven fried chicken was heating and my casserole microwaving. We had it in and out of the oven, served up and eaten before I remembered to take an AR photo! Now that just NEVER happens since digital, but it did tonight. Zowie! It's THAT good!

This is the best recipe have have made for Molten Cakes.  It is perfect for a nice romantic evening at home, and sooo easy and quick to put together, so you aren't kept away from your "date" too long.

This star rating is purely due to taste preferences, I'm sure, but we just didn't care for these at all.  Very chocolate-y and rich, not really sweet at all.

I made this as a suprise for my girlfriend and her daughter for dessert. I halfed the recipe and it turned out perfectly! I made it ahead of time and stuck in the fridge for a few hours..and took it out to set for an hour before baking. Mine took exactly 13 minutes. I also greased the pans with crisco and didn't have any problem with them popping out. Dusted with powdered sugar and it was a winner!

This is excellent and somewhat easy.  I melted the chocolate squares on the stovetop. Silly me! I also made them in smaller custard cups than recommended. I will make it again and again and again.

It is interesting that this recipe lists the serving size as 1/2 a cake.  Good luck with that!  I doubled the recipe so each person could have their own and we cleaned our plates!  Served with fresh berries and cool whip it makes an impressive dessert.
