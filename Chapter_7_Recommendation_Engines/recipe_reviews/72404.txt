I found this casserole unique and my family really enjoyed it. Like other reviewers, I increased the hashbrowns to 2 pounds and I used both full cans of soup. For newer cooks, it might be helpful to recommend county style hash browns (shredded) rather than southern style (cubed). There's also a brand of 'fresh' hash browns on the market (Simply Potatoes, I think) and they work really well. At least you won't have to deal with defrosting the potatoes. 

Also like others, it took much longer to prepare than suggested. For me personally, I'm sure its due to the amount of time I spent browning 2 pounds of potatoes. So here's my final recommendation: Don't spend an excessive amount of time trying to get that perfect shade of golden brown taters! They're still going to cook/crisp in the oven. My 'crust' was a little on the well-done side; any longer and it would have burned. Hope this is useful.

This was a good casserole, but it took about twice as long to make.  Also, if I had it to do over again, I would have added more hash browns (between 1/4 and 1/2 more).  But, I would make it again.

My husband shot a turkey yesterday morning and I was looking for a recipe to use the meat. I just cut the meat into strips and fried it with the onion instead of using ground turkey. I also used two lbs. of hash browns.  I didn't cook the hash browns ahead, I just pressed them into the bottom of a 9X13 pan. I also increased the milk to 1/2 cup. This recipe turned out so creamy and delicious. I will definately make it again.

So easy and so good - I was really surprised!  Took about 20-25 minutes to prepare and more like 30-35 to cook.  I did use regular "cream of" and cheese, but did use non-fat sour cream and skim milk.  I also sauted a bit of cornflakes and sprinkled them on top for some crunch.  Next time I might add some seasonings or fresh garlic in when browning the turkey, and I'll finely chop the onions to spread out the flavor a bit more.  And it made a ton, enough for 3 large guys and lunch leftovers for the next day.

Like the other reviewers mentioned, this took longer to make and required the measurements to be adjusted.  I used more than double the amount of hashbrowns, and could have used another 1/2 pound or so of ground turkey.  I also thought the onion was overpowering...maybe 1/2 of a large onion would have been better.  When it came out of the oven and we served ourselves in our plates, it did not look all that appetizing (kind of like a "mush") but the taste was actually quite good.

This dish was pretty good. I followed suggestions and used 2 lbs of hashbrowns and a 9x13 pan. I also used two entire cans of the cream soups. I think green beans would be a good substitution if you aren't a broccoli fan.

I took A LOT of shortcuts with this recipe.  I browned the turkey without the oil and while that was cooking, I microwaved the broccoli according to the directions.  I mixed 2 whole cans of cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of milk and doubled the garlic powder and pepper. I omitted the onion-not a fan.  Once the turkey and broccoli was done, I combined it with the soup mixture and dumped in 2 drained cans of diced potatoes.  Once this all of this was mixed, I put it in the oven for 25 minutes and it was delicious.  Will definitely make again.  Next time I may add a little sourcream for some zip!

I was looking for a recipe to use things I had on hand without rushing out to the store. As such, I had to make a couple of alterations to the recipe. I used fresh potatoes, that I shredded myself - 4 large russets to make about 2 pounds of hash browns. I cut down on the cook time by using my double-patented "dirty the whole kitchen" method (tm). I cooked all of the hash browns in one batch on my griddle while I browned the ground turkey and onions on the stove. I only microwaved my broccoli until it was not frozen solid, as I wanted it to be crisp and not mushy in the casserole. I used 1 can cream of mushroom, one half can milk, and half a cup of sour cream for the sauce because I'm not really a fan of heavy "cream-of" flavor. I actually found that this was PLENTY of sauce for us. Using the full amount of soup would probably have ended up with mush. What we had was a surprisingly delicious casserole. I might add a bit more cheese if I made it again, but otherwise it's a good go-to for a pantry-ready dish.

I loved how tasty plus healthy this recipe is!  I also used 2 lbs of hashbrowns and can't imagine using less... I used cream of chicken instead of cream of celery soup and I loved the add flavor...  Plus I had to cook it for about 45 minutes to get the soup thick and bottom golden.  Will make this again for sure!

I'll give it 3 because I think this would have been better with tater tots in the bottom of the pan & I'll be trying that next time. It'd also cut down on the prep time as well...

This was great but I did make a couple of changes.  I made homemade hash browns instead of store bought and I used the full can of cream of celery soup with less milk.  Worked well and I was not left with 2 oz of soup.

So easy and delicious! Found this with the ingredients finder (looking for ground turkey and broccoli) and luckily had everything else on hand, because it was awesome. Will definitely be making it again!

i loved all the advice by the other people that reviewed this recipe but i am surprised no one mentioned the "blandness" of the hashbrowns.
everything was full off flavor as for the top layer of the casserole, but the potatoes could have used something. salt,cheese, something?? almost like i could have mixed the potatoes in with the mix and use it as the bottom and top layer of the casserole. 
things i did change in the recipe:
used half can of cream of chicken and a cup of sour cream instead of the cream of celery, loved it and added more cheese to the mixture. also used others advice and used 2 lbs of the hash browns.
cooked the casserole for 45 min instead of 30 because it seemed cold after 30 still. 
i would give this recipe a 3 1/2 star but i cant. so three will do. easy to make, may make again if i figure out how to make the hash browns less bland.

This was kind of bland.
I am not familiar with a frozen hash brown producet in a 1lb size, so I used "Simply Potatoes" hash browns.  The 1 cup cream of celery soup was odd too -- is that 1 cup of undiluted soup (which would leave some leftover) or 1 cup of canned cream of celery soup, prepared??

I followed this recipe perfectly, and it is NOT good.  The flavor is okay, but it looks like mush and my husband (who usually eats everything) asked me to never make it again.  I use a LOT of recipes off this website and unfortunately have to give my first '2' on this one.

This was great! I did have to make a few changes SORRY! I had to omit cream of celery, onion and garlic powder. I then added broccoli cheese soup fresh garlic, two ribs of celery, minced and 1/2 package onion soup mix. Mix everything together, put a lid on it turn to low and simmer for 20 minutes. My oven broke so I have to improvise. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was so different that I had to try it. I used fresh potatoes and browned them first, then I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and microwaved it. I didn't use any cheese, and used the entire cans of soup. It was good - we liked it - and I'll probably make it again sometime.

This was a fabulous recipe. I loved all the different textures going on in one biteful.  I doubled the hashbrowns and the ground turkey.  I used fresh broccoli that was steamed in place of frozen.  It was delicious.  Everyone loved it from a 2 year old grandbaby to a lovable husband!!!  Will cook again definately.

This has become a regular recipe in our home.  It is great when I need a ground turkey recipe & I usually have these ingredients (or similiar) on hand. I substitute cream of asparagus or cream of broccoli for the cream of mushroom, since my husband doesn't eat mushrooms. Thank you for the recipe!

Good easy one-dish recipe.  I skipped browning the hash browns, just spreading them in the sprayed pan, which cut down on prep time. I also used fresh steamed broccoli, zucchini, and mushrooms instead of just frozen broccoli. The family liked it, but didn't love it.  I really liked it.

This is delicious the only thing I do different is I do not ad the broccoli as I find it gets to mushy. Instead near the end of cooking I add frozen peas.

This recipe is great!  I used turkey breast that I cubed and cooked prior to adding it and also used 2 pounds of hash browns.  Added seasoning salt and pepper to the hash browns and the turkey as well.  I also added additional cheddar to the top after it was done cooking and then just put it back in the oven (with the oven off) for another 10 minutes.  On my plate, I added a little bit more salt and pepper and a bit of cayenne pepper.  When I make this next time I am going to use minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I'm going to add cayenne pepper to the soup mix.  I'm also going to add some bacon next time as I think that would be excellent!  Thank you for the recipe.  :)

I made this one with reduced fat cheese instead of fat free because I couldn't find fat free cheddar at the store.  It was good, but I would mix everything together next time rather that have the hash brown crust and use fat free ricotta cheese instead of the cheddar and milk.  Toasted bread crumb topping would be nice to add too.

The recipe was easy to make but just took longer then the recipe states. I thought the turkey was a bit bland even with the onion and there was too much of the mixture on top. I may try this again and adjust it to something I think could be better. I definitely like the hash brown on the bottom.

I replaced the hash browns for diced, baked sweet potatoes; then added green beans in place of broccoli. 
Very tasty stuff.

My family loved it and ate the whole plate. I didnt have cream of celery, but it was still good
