Good basic recipe, not quite the same, but good.  I prefer to use dried new mexico chiles, soak in boiling water to rehydrdate and then puree in blender, and add pureed chile to soup.  The cabbage on top is a must!

This is a really good recipe! I would prefer no cabbage,  add some camino,  garnish with raw onions and fresh cilantro, serve with corn tortillas. Yum! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good.  I used chicken instead of pork and added chicken bouillon and chili powder while cooking the chicken.

Very good!  A few minor alterations...I boiled the pork in the water w/ the chili powder (maybe a little more than what was called for) as well as a couple of spoonfuls of granulated chicken bouilon.  A lot of great flavor!  I'm already craving more!!

Yum. My husband is a big Posole fan, and kids ate well. I offered more types of veggies to add when served. Mexican style cheese is also good with it.

A very easy version of a traditional Mexican soup.  I made this to satisfy my son's craving for menudo, which I refuse to cook.  (The smell of tripe is overwhelming!)  My sixteen year old ate 4 bowls for dinner!  I used very lean pork.  It was really good, and it was even better the next day! (as most soups are!)

needs more flavor. Not very authentic. Add lime wedges on the side with cilantro, chopped cactus, cotija cheese, pureed chili sauce and onion for more flavor. We simmer whole garlic heads in our base.

I did not try this recipe either...but i have a variation of it that I use...Instead of Chilie powder, I use California chilis and rehydrate them, then puree them and after i boil the pork I add in the pureed chilis by straining them through a fine strainer....until it is a nice dark red. Then I add in the hominy and let it boil for awhile...my fiance LOVES this recipe...and even my 3 year old son asks for more. Is my personal favorite.

Great Recipe! Just needed a little more spice to it. But then, not all of us like it spicy. ;)

I adjusted this recipe. I cooked it in my big crock pot. I used  4lbs of pork shoulder. I cut up the meat into squares but still added the fat and the bone for flavor. Cooked for 2 hours on low. I then used the new mexico chilis (rehydrated and then blended). I used 6 of them and put all of them in my crockpot. Even then the broth tasted really bland. So I added chicken bouillion (the mexican and american kind - not sure if this makes a difference - about 4 cubes worth). I then added red pepper flakes (don't add too much or this becomes spicy really really quickly). I also added garlic powder (about 2 tbls).

Thank you so much for this recipe!  So easy & tasted just like my mother-in -law's posole (who is from Mexico). The part of Mexico where she's from only uses pork, not chicken like someone else said.  I served it with tortillas.

try cooking cooking outside on your grill side burner. LP cooks hotter and quicker. Let the neighbors smell the flavor

Authentic, but this recipe varies from family to family as every recipe does... obviously. I love this version. My Mexican family makes it this way exactly.

Make it more authentic with a teaspoon of Cayenne pepper powder, tablespoon of ground Comino and one tablespoon of crushed Mexican Oregano. Then it’s crockpot time for 6 hours

I used pork shoulder, but same results just a price difference to me, even though a gourmet chef I'm severely handicapped (broken back) so the income isn't great right now so sometimes you've got to try to create that silk purse from the sow's ear as it were, I but I enjoyed it I may have used a little more than the prescribed amount of seasonings, but that's who I am, I love scorpion Chili Peppers, but there not everyone's cup of tea, but after the way I grew up in various neighborhoods, I I learned more about seasoning than they taught me in chef schooling, I thank you, and Shalom.
