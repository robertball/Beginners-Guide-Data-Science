Almost perfect! I worked in a restaurant known for their beef on weck and the trick is to dip the cut rolls in the au jus just a bit before serving so its not so messy.

Great recipe, and a great way to make kimmelweck rolls for people who may not be able to find them where they live!

Absolutely what i've been looking for. I grew up in Buffalo, this being one of my FAVORITE sandwiches. I didn't realize it was only local until I moved to the west coast. Now I'm dating an Oregonian and he had never heard of beef on weck. Outrageous! So, since there are no Kimmelweck rolls to be found out here, this recipe was perfect. Thank you!

This takes a French Dip to an entirely new level.   I love caraway seeds, so this just hit the spot.  The coarse salt adds a texture reminiscent of a giant soft pretzel, although I must admit it was too salty for me using the recommended ratio.  The caraway seeds and salt will stick to the bun using plain water, but I found that you get a crustier top if you brush the buns with an egg wash consisting of egg whites and water.

Between the salt in the au jus and the bun, it was just too salty. I'm sticking with Italian beefs.

Closest thing to Kimmelweck rolls without going through the hassle of making them yourself.  Try brushing the rolls with melted butter instead of water (I also leave off the caraway seeds).  The "Easy Slow Cooker French Dip" recipe is delicious for cooking your meat and au jus sauce.  These two recipes make for a mouth watering sandwich!

We dip the bottom side of the top roll in au jus and just serve with horseradish.  This recipe was just what I needed.  My Buffalonian boyfriend was overjoyed :)  Thank you.

These is a simply but tasty and hearty recipe! We really enjoyed this dish. My husband is a huge fan of French dips and I loved making it with the deli roast beef.

I made this in November for a tailgaiting party. My family from Buffalo absolutely loved the Weck rolls.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks so much for the method of making "weck" from "no weck!" I surely miss those Weck rolls from Buffalo! Now I don't have to feel deprived!

This is a good recipe. I brushed the rolls with a water-cornstarch mixture, about the consistency of Elmer's glue, then put salt and caraway on, then baked them.

I am from Western NY and this sandwich is one of the things I fondly remember and really miss eating! There is nothing like the true Kimmelweck roll but once you are outside of Western NY you won't find them.  This method of transforming the Kaiser roll really does work though! Thanks for the recipe!

Looks pretty Good. My favorite restaurant in Western NY makes it with thinly sliced Prime rib and German potato salad on the side and I have substituted both here.

I used cornstarch and water to  brush on the hard roll and then sprinkle with Pretzel salt and caraway seeds. Then bake in the oven at 275 degrees F for maybe 10 minutes just until the egg white is dried and shiny or the cornstarch is dried. I dip the cut side of the top roll very slightly into the au jus and I am thinking that you want the beef pink so you do not want to cook it all in the au jus. I love that I can make this sandwich in my PA kitchen, even if the restaurants only offer Cheesesteaks. I takes me home with every bite. Thanks for posting!

I didn't do the salt and caraway seeds on the rolls, but these were delicious and very easy.

I moved to Maine several years ago and Kimmelweck is unknown here. Besides chicken wings this is my most missed food. This is the closest I've came to having the real thing.Just make sure that the beef is rare. I recently returned from a trip to Buffalo and after having one there I was craving more here. Thank you for giving me some memories back.

The biggest flaw in this recipe is you need to use pretzel salt not kosher or course ground sea salt. Its just not the same. Good in a pinch though.
