Why have boring old turkey salad when you can have this?!?!  What a great twist on the usual turkey salad. Your family will thank you and your guests will be impressed!  I made the recipe exactly as written. The only change I might suggest is to use more chutney in the dressing for added flavor. Next time instead of oranges, I might try diced mango.  TIP: If you're not going to be eating this soon after making, do NOT use fresh pineapple. Use canned instead. The bromelain enzyme in fresh pineapple (which is destroyed in canning process and not an issue with canned pineapple) will give the chicken an unpleasant texture. The meat breaks down and gets a mushy/gritty texture.  Just a heads up for people who aren't aware of this!  I served this on it's own over lettuce leaves, and also inside a low-carb wrap. Fabulous both ways!

I liked this recipe very much. I made some changes based on what I had at home. I used regular sour cream instead of low fat. I used red onion instead of green onion. I added toasted almond slivers and some dried cranberries. I served it over lettuce and put some avacado on the side.  I think it is probably very low fat but tastes very satisfying. I am taking it to a ladies luncheon potluck. I think it will be well received.

A good way to use up leftover turkey.  It was pretty good but could have used more dressing I think.
