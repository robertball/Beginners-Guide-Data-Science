This is a great recipe, but next time I would use whole milk or even half n half, instead of the skim milk I used.  It was quite watery w/skim and I had to bake the quiche for much longer than the recipe stated.

So easy to make, and very delicious! I am a cheese lover, so I doubled the Feta. I would NOT reccomend doubling the Feta - it did not incorporate well. Next time I will add a cheddar/mexican blend instead. I also added in extra squash and zucchini, and will definitly be making this again.

With myself not being the greatest of cooks, my husband a vegetarian, and me a meat eater, we have a difficult time finding recipes that are easy to make and that both of us will actually like.  This recipe was both.  I followed the directions to the tee -  the only exception was that I used frozen spinach instead of fresh - and it turned out fantastic!  This is definitely one we will make again.  The only slight thing I would change is that for inexperienced cooks like myself, I was a little confused on the pie crust.  Was I suppose to follow the directions for the pie crust on the package, THEN follow the one in the recipe?  I ended up ignoring the package instructions and just followed the recipe and it turned out fine.  Thanks again for posting this!  We were getting sick of bean tacos and spaghetti!

Great recipe and very easy to make! The only thing I changed was I used roasted red peppers instead of broccoli.  If you use the regular pie crust instead of deep dish, you will have some extra filling.  I used 2% milk and it was just right.

Super delicious!  Used Manchego and Mozzarella cheese since that's what I had in the fridge, but feta would be delicious too!  I also used garlic salt for about half the salt because I love garlic in my food, but didn't want to mince any up.  Good flavor, everything blends well together.  Might add bacon in the future just because I love bacon.  Thanks!!

Tasty.  I precooked the veggies and added more, but then I had more than the pie crust could fit.  I oooked the extra filling on the stove, but it doesn't taste as good as in the quiche.

Followed others' recommendation to season and saute veggies  first.  I let them cool a bit before stirring into the egg mixture.  I also doubled the amount of feta. I had heavy cream leftover from another recipe, so added 3/4 c. of that to 3/4 c. of 1% milk.  My oven is not level, so I turned the pie plate 1/4 turn after 15 minutes and again after another 15 to keep the quiche even.  It was done in 50 minutes & smelled wonderful.  I let it sit 5 minutes, before serving.  It received good comments from everyone, but my son found it to be bland.  I gave him the hot sauce bottle (?!) and he was happy.  There were NO leftovers.

I read the reviews and I sauteed the onion and mushrooms, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  After one serving it went in the garbage.  No taste.  Couldn't tell it had feta cheese and there seemed to be too much milk--I had to bake it much longer.  It was a waste of effort and ingredients.  There are much better recipes out there.

This was delicious! Based on other reviews, I cooked the veggies on the stove first (let them cool before adding to eggs). It took 55 minutes for it to cook in a deep pan. I had to lower the temperature to 325 for the last 20 minutes of cooking (probably because of my oven, which tends to cook too quickly) because the top of the quiche was already very brown. I used asparagus in place of the broccoli, and salted the veggies with garlic salt while they cooked. Also, I used herb feta cheese and for the milk 1 cup half and half and 1/2 cup 1% milk. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was just ok for my family, I used turkey bacon for a little more taste. Used a 9" pie plate cooking time was just a little longer.

With my changes this was 5 star. Had lots of requests for the recipe..basically used half/half in place of the milk and used 4 oz of sundried tomato feta.  I also sauteed all of the veggies before putting in the crust, dumped the cheese on, and then poured the egg mixture.  Instead of brocoli which I don't care for I added some squash and tomatoes from my garden.  YUM!

I thought this was just fantastic. Very light and tasty, even without the heavy cream and cheese in a "traditional" quiche. I stayed with the recipe without tweaks, except for being a little liberal with my measurements of the veggies - I just eyeballed and went with a little extra spinach, mushrooms and broccoli. 

I made this for my mom and I, who both are very careful about caloric intake. My wife ate a piece and smiled all the way through and she doesn't eat  quiche. 

The only thing I will do differently next time is cover the crust the entire time, it was a little more brown than I particularly care for, but no one else seemed to mind. Thanks for a great recipe. Gonzo

Nothing bad, nothing out of this world.  I cooked the veggies first, which I think was needed.  I added mozzerella and cheddar mix to the feta cheese.  The feta was barely noticeable (I used a pretty mild feta, maybe it would be more noticeable with a stronger one).  I liked that it was packed with veggies and it came out really fluffy.  I probably wouldn't make it again.

My ingredient measurements were different: 1/4 less milk, added another egg, I omitted the cheese and added bacon and tomatoes on top. Started baking with foil on top and took off after 1/2 hour. We really like this recipe.

This was a pretty good quiche. My family seemed to like it, however I didn't taste the Feta cheese, so next time I will add more. It was a little bit watery, so I will also reduce the milk to 1 cup. Thanks for the recipe, I look forward to making it again with these changes!

Very, very tasty. Next time will saute the mushrooms and spinach to get the liquid out. The quiche was a little watery. Had to cook longer than expected. After taking it out of the oven I let it set up before cutting even though it smelled so good we wanted to cut it right away. Will definitely make again with some minor changes.

Awesome! I added a little bacon and swapped out half & half for the milk but this recipe was great right out of the box. I also added a sprinkle of cheese on top 10 minutes before done.

I tried this recipe and I am not fond of it. Not enough egg means longer cooking time to get the consistency needed. I am at 1hr and 15min now and it is still to loose. Not a easy recipe for beginners at all. I love quiche but will find a way to make it the night before or use one that takes less time.

This is a really great recipe to use as a base for any quiche. The feta really adds a lot of flavor to any quiche, and I just throw in whatever vegetables I need to use up. The recipe makes a bit too much for just two normal pie shells, so I usually make quite a bit less filling. I also make my own pie crust instead of using the frozen ones. Quiche is always a good, easy option.

This was yum! I subbed minced dried onion for chopped onion, and added extra mushrooms, spinach and broccoli. Definitely needed the extra veggies. Topped with some shredded mozzarella/cheddar mix. Next time I will leave out the salt, the feta was salty enough.

I combined this with one of my mom's recipes. It actually works very well with no crust--just grease the pan! I used frozen spinach and it worked out great.

I didn't make this with a crust and used part evaporated milk. Also, I cut down on the amount of liquid some... we liked the flavor. The feta cheese makes the difference. Still having a hard time convincing my husband of no meat. So I'm sure I will be adding some next time. Very versatile, I really like that part.

This was a delicious recipe! I added a little cheddar cheese on top, but it didn't even need it. I made it with farm fresh eggs and that does enhance the richness, but I am sure it is good otherwise.

Made this the day before, and it was gone by yesterday (and only hubby and I ate it).  We thought it was delicious.  Because I didn't have fresh spinach or broccoli, I used frozen and sauteed them both in olive oil and garlic.   
This will be a weekly staple in my house.

It's a good recipe indeed,but not for beginners. I suggest that puff pastry should be cooked after having cooked the vegetables: otherwise the vegetables are too watery.So roll the pastry on a suitable pan, practice some holes with a little fork on it and paint it with a yolk, then cook the vegetables with the spices you prefer,put them on the pastry,prepare another rolled pastry and seal with your hands all around,paint again the pastry and put in the oven preheated at 350° F (170°C) for at least 30 minutes. Control with a skewer if the Quiche is cooked, if it remains clean the quiche is ready.

Easy & yummy!  I used red bell pepper instead of mushrooms, and I used half&half instead of milk.

Very tasty, but I took it one step further,  I used a mediteranean feta olive mix chopping it up and any extra veggies I had leftover, I added into the egg mixture some parmesan and herbs and then I sprinkled some mozzarella cheese on top.

Took it to a party to watch the final in the World Cup. It did not last long! Will definitely make it again, I added many different vegetables that I had in the fridge also.
