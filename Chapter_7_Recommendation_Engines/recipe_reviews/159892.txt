I'll even give my OWN recipe 4/5 stars! I think I should have put "pepper to taste".  And keep in mind...the 2 tbs of pepper is fresh ground pepper from a pepper grinder, so there's a bit less spice than buying it already ground from the store.  However, the salt is absorbed by the sausage pretty well and only adding a little usually wasn't enough for my wife and I.  So I guess "salt and pepper to taste."  Still love making this dish! Thanks for the comments.

wow...the spices are overwhelming.  If I make this again, I'll cut all the spice amts. in 1/2, especially the salt and pepper.  Way too much salt and pepper.

I was looking for a new idea for dinner, and my husband wanted to use the Italian sausage he bought. Voila! Found this recipe. It was quite tasty. I love to cook, so I tend to use recipes as a guide.  (I would like to use the exact recipe if I'm going to post a review, but I'm Cajun so I like to do the season/sniff/taste method of cooking.)  Only adjustments I suggest are grilling the sausage to compliment the cremini mushrooms and using a more flavourful cheese, like an Italian blend.  Family has already asked me to make it again :)

This is a good recipe to use for inspiration. I used it as a base, but reduced most of the spices to a teaspoon (instead of a tablespoon), and it was still deliciously strong. I also used twice the mushrooms and a whole (small) red onions. I also used a little roux to thicken up the sauce after reducing it to a good amount. It came out really delicious. I will definitely make it again. Would be good with other shapes of pasta too, like farfalle.

I really liked the taste of this recipe! The only thing I regretted was adding the salt. Probably personal taste.

This was delicious! I didn't have rosemary but used everything else without measuring. I also added more sausage then what was called for and I added onion powder, garlic powder and a dash of red pepper flakes. I also used a pint of cherry tomatoes halfed and a can of diced tomatos. Next time I am going to add an extra red onion and more mushrooms. My entire family loved this including my 5 children ages 1-16. Thanks for this recipe!!!!
