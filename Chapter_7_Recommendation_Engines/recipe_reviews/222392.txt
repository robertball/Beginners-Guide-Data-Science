Okay at best. Grilling is an unnecessary step and softens the cukes. No crunch. My fridge pickle recipe is where I think this recipe would like to be. Also, Kosher salt in canning results in cloudy brine which is unappealing.

I can't believe more folks haven't tried this recipe!  It's amazing!  Who would've thought to grill the vegetables prior to pickling?  It adds a wonderful slightly smoky flavor to the pickles, and I plan on trying this with other vegetables--carrots & cauliflower to make a grilled giardiniera.  You can definitely control the heat in this recipe.  If you want less, use less red pepper flakes, more, go all out.  THANKS, as always, Chef John!

Wonderful.   My dear old friend, Mrs. Leahman, who has a big garden, and always makes pickles, said to soak the pickles in salty water, overnight, in a cool spot.  Then they pack fine.  They are crunchy.  I grill onion slices, asparagus, and add them.   I also put in McCormick's pickling spice.  Add some mustard seed.  Turmeric, too.

Pretty in the jar, fun to make but not as tasty as some others available.
