This looks better than it tastes, but it was pretty good. Next time I would use a little less dressing, and make sure you get artichoke bottoms, not hearts.

I little on the bland side but overall good. Very pretty.  I followed the previous reviewers advice and cut back on the dressing and it worked out well. It's a great way to use up leftover shrimp from a party or recipe.

I served this salad to seven guests, and everyone raved about it. One person even commented (without knowing the.name of the recipe) that "it seems so French." I cooked the asparagus and shrimp the night before and chilled them, then chilled the whole salad a few hours before serving. With the mayonnaise base that's the safest way to serve and it tastes great chilled. I made another 5-star Allrecipe dish as the main course, but the salad was the dark horse winner.

This was soooo good.  I made it to use as sides for my lunches last week, but instead I ate it all at one time.  Make sure you let it sit in the fridge for a bit before you eat it though - tastes so much better!

We really liked this! I thought it was going to be bland, but it ended up being a nice, light flavor that was very much enjoyed. Was even great the next day! 
The directions made for a beautiful presentation. I'll be making this again! Thank you.
