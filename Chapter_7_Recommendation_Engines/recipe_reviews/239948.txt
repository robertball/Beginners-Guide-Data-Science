I used a panko bread crumb for the extra crisp it tends to give. I flavored the panko with onion powder, white pepper, garlic powder, red chili flakes and seasoned salt. I used 3/4 inch boneless pork chops and they were more than done after 30 minutes in the oven. The soy sauce added a slight hint of flavor underneath the bread crumbs that worked well with the chops. I served them with sauteed swiss chard and sliced potatoes baked in the oven. This recipe is a keeper.

Wonderful recipe for pork chops! The egg mixture for the breading had such a great flavor.  I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs which worked well too. The only thing I need to mention is based on reviews, I only cooked mine for 30 minutes (instead of 50-55 recipe recommends), and even at 30 mins that turned out dry (hence the 4 stars), and were at 180 degree temp. So 20 mins would be more than enough I would say. Will def make these again!

I used boneless pork chops. I let the pork chops soak in the egg and soy sauce liquid for about 10 minutes. I added onion and garlic powder as recommended by another reviewer. I also added Parmesan cheese before putting the chops in the oven. I left them in for 30 minutes. They had a lot of flavor and were juicy. I definitely will make this again.

These were fabulous and incredibly easy. My chops were very thick and they were still done at 30 mins . I left out the ginger and added some parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs. Served with a mashed potato casserole, marsala and mushroom gravy, and a green bean and corn medley. I will make these again, for sure! Just watch out for the time.

These were great!  I didn't have any soy sauce on hand but found a substitution recipe with beef broth, balsamic and molasses.  I baked on a foil lined pan and sprayed the top side of the chops with cooking spray which made them crispy and golden.   Served with potatoes au gratin, steamed asparagus and chilled fruit cocktail.

This is the easiest and delicious baked pork chop recipe.  My only change was using planko  bread crumbs.  I might marinate a couple of hours to enhance flavor next time.

Added a little onion powder and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Cooking time to get correct temp was about 40 minutes.  Very tasty and easy to make, and the chops weren't dried out at all.  Will definitely make again.

I fixed this tonight for dinner and my family loved it. It was more crunchy around the edges than in the center. I did add more salt, pepper, to the bread crumbs which I mixed Italian with regular .  I added season salt, Italian seasoning, and cpl dashes of ginger.  I will definitely fix again.

The breading combination was great, very flavorful. The only adjustment I made was to coat the baking pan in olive oil instead of spraying it. I also turned the chops half way through the cooking process.  I baked them for 35 minutes at 350°. The pork chops were boneless and 2” thick.

Very good recipe. It’s very easy. Moist & tender. The crust didn’t get very crisp though. It took about 40 min to bake.

Really easy and flavorful.  Chops were over 145 after 35 minutes but the breading was still soggy.  After putting in for another 10 minutes with a few on broil, the tops were nice and crispy - but the bottom was still a bit wet and stuck to the foil.   At little dry to get them crispy - all and all we liked it and will try again with some new timings next time.

Yummy. I attempted to follow someone’s else’s advice and soak pork chops in egg for 10min. Well got busy with something else and end up speaking for about 30 min. Pork chops end up being juicy and moist. Definitely a keeper. 
I didn’t add ginger since didn’t have it and used low sodium soy sauce.

This is an absolute family favourite.  I even make it with Corn Flake crumbs to make it Gluten Free and it is DELICIOUS!!! I only need to bake them for 30 minutes and they are perfect.

No ginger. Milk instead of soy sauce. I seasoned the bread crumbs. Also I doubled up on the coating, so egg mixture coat, egg mixture coat. It was DELICIOUS! I would make it again.

This was very easy and delicious. I did use panko that I spiked with garlic powder, parm cheese and some Italian seasoning.
