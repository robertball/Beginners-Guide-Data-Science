Yum! This smoothie is so easy & delicious! I used frozen strawberries so I didn't use any ice at all & it was perfect!

Instead of ice, I used frozen strawberries and one whole frozen banana. The boys and I thought this was very tasty. Not too sweet and just the right combination of flavors. Great way to use up last summer's berries from the deep freeze!

I had a recipe like this years ago and had lost/forgotten it.  When I made it I used frozen strawberries thereby reducing the need for the ice.  Will be making this in the morning!

This shake is definitely worth trying since there are only basic ingredients needed. I used organic frozen strawberrys which limited the amount of ice to two cups. The texture was more like an icee than a shake though.

I wouldn't call this a smoothie, but a slush. It was very refreshing, though!

Really good. I was looking for a smoothie that didn't require either milk or yogurt. I subbed the orange juice for pineapple juice, which added a nice twist.

At the submitter's suggestion, I did use milk instead of the orange juice, mainly because I don't care for the strawberry-orange combination.  We liked this, and I especially appreciated it for its departure from the typical yogurt-based smoothie with its characteristic slightly sour tang.

Ive been on a smoothie kick the last few days, I have been trying out different smoothies, and this is absolutely my favorite! I used frozen strawberries and kept every thing else the same! The flavors complement each other beautifully! No one flavor over powers the others! so good!

I made this recipe before work because it was so easy and I only had that 5 minutes left. I added a few changed since I made it for just myself. 
I added 5 large strawberries, half a banana, and 1/4th cup blueberries for the fruit. Then since I didn't have any orange juice on hand, I substituted with Mango Lemonade, and Grapefruit juice. Added 1/2  a cup blender sized ice cubes, and blended. Very fruity, and the mix of sweet and sour compliments each other nicely.

This is a very refreshing smoothie which I made exactly by the recipe. However, even my high-powered Vitamix could not totally blend this into a drink. I had to add a little more orange juice, which was an easy enough fix.

Whenever I buy bananas and can't use them up in time, I freeze them at the perfect ripeness.  I use them in this and also to make banana ice cream. (Just take frozen bananas, vanilla extract, and a splash of milk and put in the food processor)
