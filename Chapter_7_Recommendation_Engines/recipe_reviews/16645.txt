Great salad! It's crunchy, refreshing, and pretty too. Following other reviewers, I substituted mandarin oranges instead of the peaches. I also cut the mayo to 1/4 c. and used some juice from the pineapple and oranges to keep the salad moist.

Love, love, love it.  Easy to make and my kids love it.  I did, as one person before me suggested, use manderines instead of peaches.  So good.  I ran out of apples the day before so I used an Asian Pear because it is what I had.

I decreased the crushed pineapple from 3 to 1 cups.  Increased the amount of shredded apple to approx. 1 1/2 cups.  Did not add the peaches.  Added some shredded carrot.  Tastes delicious.

Is very good but I left out peaches, celery and marshmallows.  I added 1//8 cup sugar, marchino cherries, chopped walnuts and chopped dated. I served at Christmas and it looks as good as it taste.

This recipe was just 'ok' to my family, though I thought it was good.  I added an extra 1/2 c. marshmallows and the coconut to add more flavor. I would make this for a carry-in, as it would be a nice change of pace. Thank you for sharing!

We didn't really like it... just an odd combination of ingredients. Right off the bat it wasn't very tasty, but it got better after chilling for a couple hours. Ended up adding a little sugar too.

Turned out great! I did get lazy and just used the bag coleslaw, but it didn’t detract from the recipe.

We made this for guests, and it turned out one of them was allergic to pineapple, so she and her husband didn't eat it!  MY husband, however loved all the leftovers.  It actually tastes better the next day.  I think the addition of coconut would be great.  The dressing really needs some kind of a push and the coconut would likely do it.

The longer this sits the better the taste.    Took this to a family christmas and enjoyed it.
