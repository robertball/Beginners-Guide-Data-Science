Reduced calories by using skim milk; equal parts fat-free half-and-half and skim evaporated milk instead of heavy cream; low-fat unsweetened organic coconut; and sugar-free almond syrup instead of sugar (didn't have vanilla). Delicious!

so good. i am however a coconut lover. the only thing i didn't like about it was that the raspberry sauce has seeds. if you don't chew it (which is hard for me not to do) it's wonderful. i want to try it again with cherry sauce. can you get frozen raspberrys without seeds?
