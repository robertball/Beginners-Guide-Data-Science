This was so good!  I used a can of pumpkin puree instead of a whole pumpkin and reduced the amount of sugar a bit.  The cardamon gives it a nice "chai" flavor.  I keep telling myself it's low-fat, but I'm not really sure!

This was delicious!  Everyone enjoyed it, including my kids.  Following the advice of the other reviews I used less sugar (only half the amount called for). I also added 1/2 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut to it to thicken it up a bit and then toasted some coconut with a little sugar to put on top.  Fantastic!

Let me start by saying that I am a sugar addict (and not looking to go into rehab for it).  Rarely do I find things that are 'too sweet' for me, but even when I only used 1 cup of sugar in this recipe (as opposed to using the 2 cups that it called for), it was still overwhelmingly sweet (thank you previous reviewers for suggesting to cut the sugar).  The only way for me to fix it was to add more pumpkin.  I enjoyed the cardamom, but also added cinnamon and nutmeg.  After a few days in the fridge, I then returned the mixture to a pan and on medium heat added chopped chicken breasts, cilantro and curry.  Served over basmati rice with some store bought garlic naan and made a great dinner out of it.

I used this as a base for a chilled dessert.  I dissolved one packet of unflavored gelatin in just enough boiling water to cover.  Once dissolved I added this to one can lite coconut oil, one can pumpkin puree, 2/3 C Splenda, and 1t Cardamom.  Cook on low until creamy, pudding-like consistancy.  I then brushed egg white on a graham cracker pie crust and baked for 5 minutes until stiff.  Pour pumpkin mixture into pie shell, cover and chill.  When ready to serve top with whipped cream, and allow people to add their own amount of toasted sweetened coconut.  The more they add, the sweeter the dessert.

I made this with 1 cup of sugar and canned pumpkin. It turned out great, except that I had a hard time knowing when to stop boiling the pudding. It didnt seem to be getting any thicker with more boil time, so I chilled it before serving and then it set to be a bit firmer.

I felt that this recipe needed a lot of spicing up, so I added 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, and 1/4 tsp. allspice. I used a stick blender to give it a smoother consistancy.  The flavor was out of this world, but I think it was just a little too sweet. The next time I will use 1 1/4 cups of sugar.

too much sugar! I used 2/3cup and it tasted good, then I added another1/3 and it was so sweet it overpowered the flavors, I did not have cardamom so I used a little allspice. My 3 year old didn't like it, so I creamed a cup of margerine and a cup of sugar together then mixed 4 cups flour, 2 tsp of baking soda and cinnamon, into the mombasa and made yummy little mini muffins. She loved them, this could easily be cookies, I will throw some chocolate chips in next time.

I've been making the 4-serving version of this recipe for YEARS and it's now THIS all-American's holiday staple!  I have cut the sugar in half, as the amount called for in the original recipe made my teeth hurt. (And I've used white sugar, brown sugar and Florida sugar aka Sucanat with equal success.) I've used canned pumpkin, but I prefer to use fresh: 1 cup pumpkin "pulp" for the 4-serving recipe, so 3 cups for this recipe as written.  I buy pumpkin or winter squash when they're cheap (this year, I used a MASSIVE calabaza squash), cut in half and bake at 400F, cut side down, in 1" of water in whatever pot or casserole dish I can find that the squash will fit in, 'til fork-tender (about an hour depending upon the size of the gourd).  Let cool til you can handle it, then scoop out the flesh and DRAIN WELL in a cheesecloth-lined collander (and squeeze it well!).  Pack in old yogurt or butter tubs, label and freeze.  Keep canned coconut milk (you can freeze any leftovers as well) and ground cardamom in the pantry and you'll be ready to make this LUCIOUS dessert any time of year! And for the record, I'm going to try it with palm / coconut sugar so it'll be Paleo / Primal!

Maybe we're too all-American, but we thought this was one step short of putrid.  It seemed more like the base for pumpkin bread or something. Then again, maybe I did something wrong. Although it's more likely that you had to grow up with something like this to really appreciate it.

I substituted lowfat plain yogurt for the coconut milk.  I didn't have cardamom, so I used a combination of cinnamon, cloves, pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg.  I used less than half of the sugar and added in a quarter of a cup of unsweetened applesauce for texture.  It's delicious!

This dessert was a hit.  We tried it hot, warm, and cold.  All ways were successful, but the warm was our personal favorite.  The flavors of the dessert were delicate and unique and paired quite well with an African ginger cake I made.  As far as the spices go, I would encourage people to use their personal tastes as a guide.  I think I might add a few more spices next time to give it a more traditional sort of American pumpkin pie flavor.  The recipe is very forgiving in the sense that it can accommodate your preferred flavor profile.

This dessert is a little different, but its nice to change things up a bit. Really good, a little sweet. House smelled amazing after I made it. It was also very easy to make, can't wait to serve it at dinner tomorrow. I to cooled overnight.

Excellent for a chilly day, love the pumpkin with the cardamom, but could do with a lot less sugar - I have a serious sweet tooth and it was still too much for me. You could probably substitute mostly splenda & use less real sugar and not hurt the taste much. I added more pumpkin & coconut milk while cooking to try & offset the sugar a bit, and it was still overwhelming.

This was excellent!!  My son chose an African theme for his first meal to cook (he's 11)almost unaided.  I got 3 pumpkins free as fall leftovers and so he trippled the recipe.  He served this with "African Curry" and "Spicy African Yam Soup".

It is delicious as a pudding which is what it is meant to be.  Since we had so much we put the leftovers warmed over vanilla ice cream and it was amazingly good.  It was also very good with whipped cream and with just unwhipped cream drizzled over it.  All and all it was so good and only lasted 2 days in the house.

Was trying to satisfy my husband's desire for pumpkin pie in a short amount of time.  Came across this recipe and followed some of the advice...less sugar, adding cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.  Also used light coconut milk, added a couple of tablespoons of butter, some vanilla, and a little shake of salt.  All in all it was quite tasty! Probably would be good on ice cream - or let it cook some more and have pumpkin butter!

My vegan girlfriend loved it.  I also used canned pumpkin and decreased the amount of sugar and upped the amount of cardamom I used and added nutmeg, to taste.

Very good. This recipe did need a little spicing up. I went ahead and added in  tsp of ginger, a tsp of cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg and allspice. I also did 1/2 cups of sugar instead of the 2, I didn't want the sweet to overpower the other spices. Turned out great. Quick and easy to make and requires little clean up. Wonderful fall dessert. Thanks for sharing with us.

Measurements of how much pumpkin would be helpful, one cup of sugar was almost too much!
