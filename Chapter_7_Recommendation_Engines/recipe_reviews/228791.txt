This was also my mother's recipe passed down from her grandmother. She always rolled out her dough between waxed paper to prevent cracking. It's a tried and true recipe.

The crust was very difficult to keep together so I ended up having to form it in the pie plate.  I also added an extra tablespoon of water.  Over all it was very good and worked very well for my pumpkin pie!

An easy to make, unobtrusive pie crust, and one of the few ones that calls for vegetable oil instead of shortening - the substitution made no noticeable difference to me. 
Rolling out the dough between sheets of wax paper will make the process much easier. I used this with a berry pie, and added a few tablespoons of sugar to the dough recipe, which worked just fine.

This a light, flaky pie crust.  It is now my favorite!  I have never been able to make a decent oil pie crust, and I'm 57 and pies are one of the of my favorite dishes.  This is now Number 1!

the only thing I would add is to roll it out between wax paper. Makes it so much easyer to work with.

It absolutely will not stick together which makes rolling it out and getting it into the pie pan impossible.   I bake a lot and since I have a better recipe I will not be using this one.  The proportions of ingredients seem to be wrong here.

This is good!  It worked great on top of a veggie pot pie, just a top crust.  I left it a little thick since I only rolled out one crust.  Used half whole wheat flour/half white, and olive oil...always trying to find healthier ways of making things that come out good!

Was barely enough for 1 glass pie plate.  And extremely hard to work with.  I guess we will see how it tastes.

First time for this 73 yr old cook to fix crust without shortening (I didn't have any on hand so went to All Recipes).  I did 1/4 C Oil and 1/4 C melted butter instead of 1/2 C Oil.  Rolled out as normal with rolling pin, no problem.  Just enough for 1 crust.  Made chocolate filling.  Wow!!!  Really liked how crust tasted, seemed to be crunchy (? don't know why). Never use shortening again.  THANKS LaDonna for recipe.

I doubled this recipe for two pies for Thanksgiving. A lemon meringue and a chocolate pie. When done, the pies looked so great that I thought they would really impress and maybe even be my best pies ever! They were terrible! The crust literally crumbled in the pan when I tried to cut a piece out. I thought  it would still taste great no matter what it looked like. Wrong! It tasted bad and even had a horrible aftertaste that I could not get rid of all night. Iâ€™ll go back to my old recipe. The few extra steps are so worth it!

A tried and true recipe. I made 4 of these crusts. If you don't like oil pies consider your filling (meat pie use left over drippings), apple custard pie (made one today used a bit of left over bacon fat to give the oil a slight bacon flavor bacon goes good with Apple's) made 2 other pies a cheese pie with beef tallow, and a straight "pus pie" (vanilla cheese cake pudding tinted to be reminiscent of pus with straight up melted coconut oil. I made a banana pudding pie as well with coconut oil. I like the results. I went to get the ice cream for the pies and they were gone before I made it to the freezer.

This looked unappealing when I first made it - oily and and lumpy - and I was worried about how it would turn out, but once baked it provided a pleasant, somewhat flaky crust. If you're making a sweet pie, add a little sugar to the crust for flavor.

Ok I have to say this is certainly not the Best pie crust iv ever had but it certainly is not the worst i was out of butter and needed a pie crust for a chocolate cream pie i made i did find it a bit crumbly but taste wise it was good!! I am definitely going to try this recipe again possibly melting butter instead of oil lets dace it everything is better with Butter LoL I feel this recipes comes down to personal preference how people like there pie crust im no crust expert so i thought it was good i loke the fact that i could use this recipe in a pinch! Hey try it Im glad i did!!

I followed the ingredients and instructions to the letter with the exception of rolling it out between sheets of waxed paper. Worked beautifully!  The dough was extremely thin but stayed together and didn't tear like so many crusts I've made in the past. Flavor and texture were wonderful!

It's easy to mix, rolls out really well between wax paper BUT is VERY fragile. Started to fall apart as I was getting it into the pan. I made this only because I was out of butter and shortening that I usually use. I think I will stick with them.

This was my first attempt at making my own pie crust, and I am very happy with myself and this recipe. I followed the recipe except for subbing 1 tablespoon of water for lemonaide.  *USE WAX PAPER TO MAKE INTO BALL AND ROLL OUT*

This is the best pie crust EVER.. I am so glad I saw to put between wax paper to roll out!!!!  I detest rolling out anything because of the big mess that is made.... I have not made a pie crust in over 38 yrs.. Saw this recipe yesterday and now have made it twice in less than 24 hours.. One for a Gooseberry Pie for Labor Day Family get together, tonight a Chicken Pot Pie...  Only change I made was I used Olive Oil since I didn't have any vegetable oil or Canola Oil. I did use a little more water than called for, so the dough would stick together better.. My NEW go to crust!!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

Thank you for this recipe. I in the past made whole wheat pie crusts for quiche and I couldn't find one that; didn't use shortening, didn't use margarine and didn't use additional gluten. So I just changed the flour and wallah. Most pie crust recipes don't go well with quiche, IMO. For those that state it isn't easy to roll out, I always roll it into a ball, press and shape it right in the pie pan.

I followed the recommendation to roll this out between waxed paper. I usually have a hard time rolling out piecrust but this worked perfectly. This crust was crunchy and flaky and just so delicious my husband and I both loved it.  It was the best part of the pie.

I've made this 6 or 7 times for various types of pie, it flakes really well and has a great density - but it won't stick together... ever. I've tried chilling it before use, adding water, even varying the amount of flour on my work space, this recipe just isn't made to be cohesive. This might be good in a pinch if one runs out of butter and shortening.

This crust was great for chicken pot pie. I doubled the recipe, and it made enough for a top and bottom crust for 6 miniature pies (in oval-shaped ramekins). Dough was very oily, but I kept dusting everything with flour and managed to roll them out pretty well. Next time I will try rolling it out between sheets of wax paper. Overall, this was a great crust. Would use this recipe again, especially for savory pies. Not sure if it would taste as good with sweet pies.

I love this pie crust! It was so simple. It was golden an so flaky. I too added a little bit more water about 1 1/2 tbsp. I can't wait to make this for my mom.
