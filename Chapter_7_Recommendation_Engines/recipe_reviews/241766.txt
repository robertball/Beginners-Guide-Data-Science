We have an allium allergy in our house (garlic/onion) so have to avoid store-bought spice mixes. Learned the hard way with Old Bay in particular! I was smart and saved the container...keep refilling it with this and we are very happy with it! I love mixing it with mayo/sour cream and lemon juice for a dip. Also delicious sprinkled on fries. Thanks for the copy!

My family and I found this recipe to be salty as is.  We preferred it using only 1-3/4 tsp. of celery salt and about 1/8 tsp. for all the spices for which were instructed a "pinch."

This was way too salty. Too much celery salt compared to the other ingredients. Won't make it again.

I think the other ingredients besides the celery salt could be upped a little, but otherwise worked out well for a recipe.

I really liked the mix of flavor in this recipe. I used one tbsp of celery salt and one tbsp of celery seed then passed it through my mortar. Thank you for the recipe.

I have never had Old Bay Seasoning before so cannot vouch for its authenticity, however, it worked well in the chili recipe I was making. I did only use just under 2 tsp. of celery salt due to the reviews.  I also subbed in a pinch of ground coriander for the cardamom, just because I didn't feel like grinding it up just for the sake of such a small amount. Thanks for posting!

Great substitute and worked well instead of spending money on actual "Old Bay" seasoning. Used to make Connie's Zucchini Crab Cakes (from this site) and reduced the amount of celery salt to 2 tsp. I think 2 tbsp. would be too much...and too salty. Left the other seasoning amounts the same and this spice blend was perfect for what I was making...with 1 tsp left to use. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I'll be using it again!

This is a great mixture.  I used it in a seafood chowder.  It was fantastic.

I have made this before just guessing at it, but didn’t use some of the ingredients.  I am allergic to mustard so just eliminate that, didn’t use cardamom because I didn’t have any, way less celery salt.  All these people that complain about the salty taste should just use their heads and use less instead of complaining about it. I think it is a very good recipe. Thank you!

I'm not sure what Old Bay is supposed to taste like, but I enjoyed this in Connie's Zuchini "Crab" Cakes recipe on this site.  I've made this spice substitute twice now.  Added a bay leaf and crushed the spices in my pestle and mortar.

I don't know real Old Bay seasoning to compare this to, BUT my recipe called  for it and I used this as a sub.  My recipe turned out great, so much so I will keep making scratch old bay seasoning. Its nice knowing exactly whats in my seasoning too.

I've never tried real Old Bay, but I thought this was good on shrimp. I liked it and will try it on fish next time. Instead of all celery salt, I used half celery seed that I put through a grinder.

I loved this! I substituted celery seed for celery salt. It was perfect and no salty taste.

You might say I grew up with Old Bay Seasoning, being born and raised in Baltimore since 1940. I gotta say this recipe ain't even close. Not for steaming crabs, or shrimp, or as a spice used in crab cakes and other sea foods. I stick with the original.
