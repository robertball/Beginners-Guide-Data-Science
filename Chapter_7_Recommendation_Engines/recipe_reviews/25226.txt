My wafflles turned out GREAT!  I was in a bit of a hurry so didin't separate the eggs and just put them in whole.  The waffles still turned out very fluffy.  I also used buttermilk powder and water instead of fresh buttermilk.  You put the buttermilk powder in with the dry ingredients and then put the water in with the wet.  You don't make up the buttermilk first.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

These waffles were worth the extra work of beating the egg whites.  I loved the flavor and texture.  My husband and kids love them too.  I have to invest in a bigger waffle maker now!  Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe......we liked them.  Will make again.  The malt gives them a unique flavor.  Not the same O, same O.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It's a 5 star.

Not the best, but definitely worth trying.  These came out a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My DH loves 'em that way.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I made my own w/ vinegar.  Also, didn't have the buttermilk baking mix...just the reg. Bisquick and it was just fine.  Will try again.

These were good...but not great. I was hoping for more of a sugar cone type taste. I actually doubled the malt powder, doubled the sugar, and did not separate the eggs. I also did not beat the eggs at all. The consistency was thick and creamy, which I like.  I would make this again though....but I will likely continue to tweek it.

Not crazy about these waffles.   I followed the recipe to the letter, but they did not turn out light and crispy, and the malted milk flavor was nonexistent.  I served them with Pete's Chocolate Malted Milk Syrup for Waffles (by the the same recipe submitter), and although I will make the syrup again, doubtful I'll make the waffles again.

Didn't like the fact that this recipe called for pancake mix. I'm not interested in instant food. I was hoping they would taste and look like the golden waffle.com brand but it wasn't even close. I also had a very hard time finding the malted milk powder.
