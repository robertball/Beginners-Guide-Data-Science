I can't stand pumpkin pie.  Ok, with this pie, I was sneaking back to the fridge for more.  I used a baked pie shell, rather than the cookie crust called for.  The pie is wonderfully light and fluffy.  Makes other pumpkin pies truly taste like... someone said mud

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was SO yummy.  My family loved it.  It makes ordinary pumpkin pie look like mud.  The gingersnap crust adds such a great flavor.  THANKS!  Will prepare this again!!

This is a very different but delicious pumpkin pie.  Since I tend to like my pies lighter, I thought it was very good.  The ginersnaps really added flavor.  The way the pumpkin mixture oozes into the ginger snaps, it reminds me of a very fluffy banana pudding, except that it tastes like pumpkin pie instead of banana.  This recipe seems to be especially popular with children.  I wound up having to use 2 pie pans for it though.  It makes 2 pies or 1 very deep dish pie.

I used this pumpkin pie recipe last year, so I'm making it again this year!
It was absolutely superb! I crushed ginger-snaps and added butter for the crust, and it tasted so much better than plain ordinary crust!

This one's a keeper!
This recipe does wonders to thick, heavy pumpkin.  I made it for a family dinner and coaxed everyone to try it - even the "non-pumpkin-pie-eaters" loved it!  The filling fluffs up almost like mousse but is more substantial, and has a marvelous lightly spiced pumpkiny taste.  I would say the gingersnap crust MUST be used - for me, it made the pie.  I suggest buying quality cookies, with lots of ginger (I used brand-name Mr. Christie Midget Snaps, thin wafers)  And next time I think I will even layer them a bit more to make a thicker crust.  HOWEVER, I am now signed up to make the pumpkin pie for my family dinners for the next 25 years...

This is the best pumpkin pie recipe I have ever
tried but  I use canned pumpkin and would rather have
a recipe that calls for a "can of pumpkin" instead
of one cup. I put walnuts in the oven for awhile
before using.I have had to give recipe to others
after using and serving.  Delicious !

Gingersnap cookies did not soften as I would have liked them to.  Too hard to cut.  When they say the first piece is the hardest to come out, they should have said all pieces are hard to come out with this pie.  PLEASE NOTE: Flavor and texture were WONDERFUL, that's why 4 stars- I will just be a little more creative with the crust.

This is very close to my Mom's recipe, except she:
1. did a graham cracker crust
2. used 2 1/2 cups Pumpkin
3. used 1/2 cup light brown sugar - 1 cup white sugar
4. 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
5. 3/4 cup evaporated milk 
6. no butter- it's in the graham cracker crust

This was a huge hit! The pie was intense with flavor and it was as smooth as silk. I found it to be a bit more elegant than standard pumpkin pie, but with none of the work. Not that it needs any help in the flavor department, but some of family members like to drizzzle maple syrup over it. This recipe will be the only one I'll use. Well worth a try!

This is a great pie. I made the crust with ground gingersnaps and butter, but other than that I followed the recipe. Light and fluffy with a nice spicy pumpkin taste. I think I like this better than tradiional pumpkin pie! Seems to me that it tastes better a day or two out as well, as the flavors have melded together. Only thing is the crust did get soggy after a couple days. This one is a keeper for sure!

This pie is fabulous! the only thing I will do differently next time is to make it the day I intend to eat it because my (Mi-Del) gingersnaps went a bit soggy. It was still a huge hit at Thanksgiving

Everyone loved this light and tasty dessert. Made the crust with gingersnap crumbs and butter.  Place it in springform pan, then topped with whipped cream and fresh ground nutmeg.  A real winner!!

I crushed my cookies and added butter to make the crust.  The pie was great but next time I think I will pass on the crust and serve the filling in dessert cups instead.

This is usually the only type of pumpkin pie my family liked.  So light and not heavy after a big meal. I use a gingersnap pie crust. This type of crust does not go as soggy as the whole gingersnaps. Also I try to use imported (if possible) gingersnaps and English ones are usually the best.

My twelve year old and I made this pie for Thanksgiving. I was wonderful! We did however have a problem getting our egg whites right, but we were persistant and this pie came out amazing. I did double the recipe and made homemade whipped cream to top it off. This pie is our new Thanksgiving tradition. Thanks for sharing.

I did this as an experiment in making a pumpkin chiffon pie, and it was pretty tasty: much lighter and creamier than a traditional pumpkin pie.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had never made chiffon before, but I didn't have much difficulty with that part of this.  The next time that I make this, I will probably do a more traditional crust: either a traditional pie crust or a gingersnap crumb crust.  But even as is, this was a pretty good pie.

Didn't make the actual pie.  Use the pumpkin chiffon mixture as a filling to make cream puffs.  The filling was light and had a nice pumpkin flavor.

I followed directions with the only change was a substitution of  half and half instead of whole milk.
It never congealed, even after being in the refrigerator for 5 hours. Tasted fine but was essentially soup. 
I have no idea what I could have done wrong.

I have been making  Pumpkin Chiffon pie for about 30 years.  This is the closest recipe to what I have. One difference is that I crush the gingersnaps and add butter to make a better pie crust then bake the crust for 8-10 minutes. My recipe is more labor intensive and is chilled overnight to set properly. I am not giving up the rest of my own recipe, but I highly recommend this one with a little tweaking on the crust. Also, you do not need to dissolve the gelatin in water, just stir 1 envelope into the pumpkin mixture while stirring on the stove. :D

This was a huge hit for my traditionalist family. Rather than use whole cookies I added a little melted butter and 2 tbsp. of sugar to crushed gingersnaps, pressed them into a spring form pan and baked it in a 325 degree oven for 7 minutes to make this light and fluffy version of pumpkin pie. The spring form pan makes the pie look elegant for our Thanksgiving dinner. It's a little more trouble than the typical pumpkin pie but well worth it! Everyone loved it and I'll make it every Thanksgiving from now on!
