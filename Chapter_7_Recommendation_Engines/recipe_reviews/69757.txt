Very good recipe but an excellent variation on this is:
1.  Always precook the brats in straight beer with onions chopped up into large pieces in beer.  Boil the onions in beer until soft prior to boiling brats.  Only boil brats for 5 minutes then take off heat and let it soak in all the beer and onion flavor for a while.
2.  Take several jalapenos and center celery stalks and chop to small 1/4" pieces and sautee them in butter over a low heat until very soft.  Keep pan covered.  I use 50/50 mixture but if you like it hotter go 66/33 or if not so hot go 25/75(first number is percentage of jalapeno in mix)
3.  Take a flavor injector syringe and inject the jalapeno and celery into the brat.  Be sure to only inject the mixture into the ends of the brat, not through the sides because the the juice will leak out during the cooking with the sauerkraut.
4.  Put brats in the sauerkraut and cook til done.
5.  Use the onions in the beer on your sandwich.
6.  Enjoy

I liked the sweet/sour concept so the next time I made this I doubled the brown sugar and sprinked 1 tbsp. over the saurkraut and 1 over the beans.  This was good on a bun with some ketchup (honest!) but it's also good without the bun.  Want it extra quick and easy?  Use a bag of Johnsonville pre-cooked brats, thawed, but throw them in still cold.  Works wonderfully.  My whole family liked this, even my 18-month old.  This deserves 5 stars simply because it tastes good but it's so fast and easy.  After making this a few times, I realized a regular size can of saurkraut is plenty, at least for our tastes.

A huge hit with my hubby Debbie! Altered the recipe a bit by lightly browning some onion in a pan, while several strips of bacon were cooking in the microwave. I added the sauerkraut to the onion, then the bacon, plus caraway seeds. (German people need these seeds in their kraut) After simmering for about fifteen minutes, I then proceeded with the recipe. I used Johnsonville Brats even though my Dad, Otto, would probably laugh at me. Sorry Dad, but they're good. Anyway, this is a good and comforting dish and I thank you for submitting it.

Very tasty !! I LOVE sauerkraut but my husband detests the stuff and gets mad at me whenever I try to feed it to him!! He actually ate it and commented that it 'tasted pretty good' HA! I could  not bring myself to buy the pale, anemic uncooked bratwurst so I started with the precooked kind and skipped step 1. I did rinse and then simmer my kraut in a pan with a bit of water and beer for about 15 min. and then put a generous amount of brown sugar on top after putting it in the baking dish (my attempt at disguising it for hubby dear). There were no leftovers, my 7yo ate up  the extra brats, hubby claimed the beans and I got the kraut...everyone was happy!

My guys were really disappointed with this recipe...it's basically pretty ugly, and we couldn't figure out what to do with everything...  way too mushy to put in a bun..do you put the beans in or have them on the side?  They henceforth have demanded I not adulterate their beloved brats and kraut.  I love this site for printing recipes just before I go home, and have a huge stack of recipes that stepson wants to take to college. Unfortunately, this one went in the trash... sorry!

This WAS the best.....I didn't have any celery salt, so I omitted that. Didn't even miss it. But everything else added, made this a wonderful meal. I used the brat buns, and everyone loved them. Very juicy and tender. The beans themselves were delicious added to the brats along with the tasty sauerkraut. With a little sweetness from the brown sugar....It made this a perfect meal.

I made this dish but substituted a can of drained black beans for the baked beans. I like this dish. It was quick and easy and the sour/sugar combo was a hit. Next time though I will add a little more than the called for tablespoon of sugar.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it is so quick, easy, inexpensive, and uses things that I always have on hand. It really isn't anything spectacular, but it did the job. Thanks!

Great recipe and was SO delicious. I used Bush's Home Style beans that has extra brown sugar and a bit of bacon in it. I did not add any extra brown sugar. Did boil one coarsely chopped up white onion in some Dundee Honey Lager beer until tender then added the brat and two stalks celery cut up and steamed covered for an additional 5 minutes. Then after draining browned the brat a bit. Added all the onion, celery and brat to the top of the baked beans and sauerkraut. I was so hungry, I only baked 30 minutes at 350. This recipe is a a keeper!

Oh, I used a 16 oz. can of sauerkraut as well as a 14-16 oz. can of baked beans with 6 Johnsonville Stadium (cooked)brats. Enough to feed 3 hungry folks or 4 not so hungry.

I forgot to drain the sour kraut, so mine was runny.  I'm anxious to try it again correctly.  I think we'll really enjoy it and will be able to taste the flavors

I just wanted to say that I was totally skeptical about making this dish because I am not a fan of sauerkraut but it was absolutely delicious!!  My husband loved it too!!  Definitely boil the brats in beer and onions first and I also added bacon to the kraut.  I will definitely make this again.  Other people mentioned that it was runny and I think that is because they didn't drain the kraut.  Anyway delicious dinner, thanks!!

This sure is a quick and easy recipe! I really liked the sauerkraut with that little bit of brown sugar. It takes the tartness away. This was/is a really busy Saturday and this was the perfect meal for today! For as simple as it is it is very tasty.

Delicious. I also made it again and added 1/4 cup whole cranberry sause, 1/4 cup dried cranberries, 1 small can green chili's, 1 tsp cumin, and a dash of hot pepper sauce. Sweet tabetsy, the best!!! Depending on your tastes, you may omit the extra brown sugar, I loved it though!

I kind of reversed the proportions here and used a 28 ounce can of baked beans and a 16 ounce can of sauerkraut.  I think this ratio is a bit better.  I also used kielbasa instead of bratwurst because I don't like bratwurst and because kielbasa doesn't have to be cooked first.  Next time I will probably use a bit more brown sugar, and caraway would be a great addition if you like caraway.  All in all, this is a really good meal served with salad and mashed potatoes, and it is really easy, too!

Very good and yet a real no-brainer. I used the pre-cooked bratwurst.  The most difficult part of the recipe is getting the ingredients together!

This was a great recipe; the only change I would make is to double the beans.  I also used sliced turkey sausage rather than bratwurst.

This was great, it just wasn't "oh man, this is SOOO good!!!" great.   I added more brown sugar and put it on top of rinsed and drained black beans (instead of baked beans), and I also tore up a soft tortilla and put it on the bottom of the dish. I didn't squeeze out any of the sauerkraut, and that way the tortilla stayed soft, and we all really liked it in there.  I also cut up the brats (I used beer brats) into bite size chunks.

If you haven't tried this you are truly missing out on one of the best quick fix meals ever. I suggest that you drain and rinse you kraut first. This is a family favorite and all of my neighbors have asked for the recipe. I live in a small town in the middle of Iowa and this is a big hit around town. Oh yeh, I also use Bushes home stile beans they work the best, but any canned baked bean will work.

This was super easy and quick. I followed the directions but did not add the celery salt (I was out)> It's pretty good! I only wish I had used more beans or could come up with a sauce to use on the side.

We thought it was an ok recipe. Turned out a little too runny and I had drained the saurkraut and beans thoroughly. Definately needs to be eaten on a bun as suggested in some of the other reviews.

My husband and I didn't much care for it.  We would of rather made the bratwursts on the grill and made the beans and kraut separate.  Wont be making again.

I am all about healthy alternatives and I used just regular turkey sausage, fat free beans, and regular kraut.  I eliminated the brown sugar but drained the kraut and used the juice from the beans in compensation for the sweet.  It gave it just enough.  It turned out great!!  Great recipe!!

I made this grilling the sausage for 2 minutes then baked as instructed.  It was fabulous.  The touch of brown sugar made all the difference.  This will be the only way I eat sausage and kraut in the future!

This is now one of our family favorites.  Even good as leftovers.  A great way to sweeten up sauerkraut without loosing the flavor.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Most baked bean recipes or canned baked beans have brown sugar or molasses in them, so additional is not necessary. Good recipe.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. As suggested I simmered the brats in beer with some onions before baking it. I accidentally bought too much baked beans and too little sauerkraut but it actually turned out pretty good. Especially fresh and hot right out of the oven.

I made this because I had all the ingredients on hand and it wasn't bad. I did boil the brats in beer for about 5 minutes and only cooked it in the oven for about 25 minutes. Very filling and an interesting combination of flavors. Probably won't make again, but it was worth trying. Thanks.

I am giving this 3 stars because I love all the ingredients involved so it couldn't go horribly wrong for me. But it does need quite a bit of tweeking. First of all, the cabbage needs to be more exciting. I can see how adding onions and cooking in beer would help it, so I may try that next time. This time I added a lot of sour cream to it on the plates, which is always a nice combination, so it wasn't so plain cabbage-y. My other major problem occured with the beans - they completely dried out and stuck to the tray by the end (even though I greased the tray at the start and cooked on low heat). Next time I'll add them only towards the end or simply warm them up on the stove top. The sausages were nice, I used a mixture of German and Hungarian (paprika) sausages and that jazzed it up quite nicely and saved the meal. So again, not bad, just a little dry and lacking exciting flavours.

I didn't like the baked beans with the sauerkraut.  Outside of that it was good.

Wow was I shocked at just how good this is !  We love just sauekraut and brats but this is now our new favorite !  I doubled the amount of baked beans but otherwise made it as written.  Oh, so good !  Just me and my husband so there will be left overs for tomorrow....and I'll bet it's even better then !

This dish was not "bad" but I definitely wouldn't qualify it as "good" either.  It was kind of just...there.  If I'm going to cook bratwurst, I would have much preferred them grilled, on a bun with some mustard.

I personally loved this recipe but added a little more brown sugar.  My husband even had seconds.
