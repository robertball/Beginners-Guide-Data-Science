We really enjoyed this recipe!  I also used fresh asparagus and based on another review, tenderized the chicken with a mallet before dredging and breading.  I did make one other sub, which was to use 1/2 the broth and about 1/2 cup of white wine.  YUMMY.

I needed a recipe quickly b/c I had asparagus that had been in the fridge too long. So I stumbled upon this recipe. Lemme tell you, my wife and I loved it. The asparagus was still crisp and not soggy. The provolone added that nice touch of flavor to the chicken. Took me less time then the recipe called for. Only complaint was that I like my cheese only partially melted, and this recipe has the provolone completely melting, to the point it almost disappears. Next time, I'll add the provolone just removing from the heat, or right before serving. Wonderful recipe nonetheless.

I have been making a version of this recipe for years. I cook the breasts in the oven first with no breading, just seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder). Then after 30 minutes, I put on sliced tomatoes, then provolone cheese. Back in the oven until cheese melts.  The tomato gives it a great taste. My boyfriend still loves the asparagus better, but the rest of family likes the tomato version best. No sauce but it doesn't need it. Very moist.

Fantastic! I went out on a limb and made this for company without ever trying it first.  It was easy, delicious and looks impressive on the plate.  I needed only one egg to dredge the breasts in. And, like the other reviewers, I used much less broth, probably only 1/2 cup.  I also used fresh asparagus. No need to saute or steam beforehand, it steamed perfectly in the 15 min. stated in the recipe. Also I waited till the very end and then laid the cheese on top.  It melted quickly in a minute or two. I can't wait to make this again! It is so good and super fast!

This was outstanding and very quick and easy to prepare.  Made it for the first time last night and everyone loved it!  I only varied from the recipe on two items.  I pounded the chicken breasts and I placed the cheese on top at the very end of cooking.  Both ideas came from previous comments.  After eating it, although delicious as it was, next time I make this I will use less broth and put a layer of cheese on the breasts before putting the asparagus on top.  Then I will add another layer of cheese on top of the asparagus at the end of the cooking time to just barely melt.  The only comment from my family was that they would have liked cheese melted on the chicken. The way I did it, all the cheese ended up over the asparagus with none on the chicken.

I'm giving this five stars because of the ease of making it AND the way it turned out.  I had 1 1/2 pounds of chicken and one bunch of fresh asparagus that I used along with fat-free, reduced sodium chicken broth and the cheese.  My family liked it and commented on how tender it was.  I've had a dish similar to this at a restaurant where they also had portabello mushroom on top of the chicken and it was very close in taste and quality!

I added a bit of parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs - yum! Seems like 1/2 can of chix broth would be plenty for next time.  Very easy and elegant - will be a great company dish.

If we could rate in halves I'd rate it a 4 1/2. It was our first time eating asparagus so we have to get used to it. I think that was the only thing keeping it from being rated a 5. I did add some sour cream to the sauce just to thicken it up a little. I loved the layer of bread crumbs! Next time I make this I think I'm going to try using green beans instead because it has a little less flavor than asparagus. I was also really suprised at how quick and easy it was. All in all, great recipe.

This really is a quick and tasty meal. One thing I would say is when buying the provolone cheese always ask for the Piccante (sharp)type as the Dolce (mild)doesn't really have the flavour or the kick to add to this very tasty meal.

Great recipe! I pounded out chicken breast as others suggested to approx. 1/2" thick then dregged in egg and italian breadcrumbs with added garlic powder and a little garlic salt.  I also used fresh asparagus and only 1/2 can chicken broth...very good!  After asparagus and chicken was cooked I removed to a plate then added the provolone and placed in the oven at 185 degrees to keep warm.  I then deglazed the pan with a little half and half and extra chicken broth. Added approx 1 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning, 2 tsp. italian seasonings (basil, orregeno) 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp. salt and cornstarch mixed with a little chicken broth to thicken. Platted chicken over a bed of wild rice. Topped with a little sauce and a sprinkle of parmesan. YUM!!! Will keep this one for guest. Thanks

My husband and I loved this recipe. I did make a few adjustments though. I added grated parmesan cheese to my bread crumbs and coated the chicken in both. Instead of pan frying in oil, I just used a light cooking spray and cooked about 3 minutes per side; it really helped to keep the crust crunchy. I topped the chicken with fresh asparagus (it stayed crunchy) and fresh portobello mushrooms. I baked it in the oven at 420, covered, for about 40 minutes; I also put a little chicken stock in the bottom of the pan so the chicken would stay moist. I added my cheese at the last 5 minutes. It came out perfect!

This was an easy and delicious meal.  I used a can of cream of asparagus soup and added a can of milk, used Panko breadcrumbs with about 1/2 cup of parm cheese.  This was so good, I will make it again for sure.  I also used fresh asparagus.

Pretty good for a quick and easy meal.  I subbed in dry white wine for the broth to add more flavor.

This was awesome!! I pounded the chicken thin and used only a half a can of broth (based on other reviews), and used Ian's bread crumbs -- it was superb! My boyfriend loved it too! Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This was excellent and couldn't have been easier! We used sauteed mushrooms on top of the asparagus as well as the cheese which made it more delicious. Thank you for sharing the recipe, my family enjoyed it! I don't recommend swiss cheese in place of the provolone as the flavor is a bit overwhelming.

Absolutely Delish! I've made it 4-5 times following the exact recipe & it has come out so juicy, tasty & yummy. Sometimes I've tried using Swiss, but  I still prefer the Provolone.

Was pretty good. I also used fresh asparagus, the canned stuff I cannot stand! I agree with other reviews about the cheese being melted too much, almost to the point it was gone so I waited until about 2 minutes to being done before I put the cheese on. I will keep it in my recipes, very easy.

This was the best chicken recipe I've tried in along time.  I marinated the chicken first in olive oil and garlic.  Instead of italian bread crumbs, I used half plain bread crumbs and half parmesan cheese.  Unbelievably delicious, tender, and juicy!  Will become a regular in my household!

We really enjoyed this recipe! The only changes I made were to add about 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion, and 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce. I sauted the onion and garlic, removed from pan, then browned the chicken. I used 1 cup of liquid, 1.3 of it being white wine. I used fresh asparagus, and when I added the liquid to the pan with the chicken, I put the asparagus in at the same time, covered the pan, and let it steam along with the chicken. I added the cheese about 3 mintues before serving. It was perfectly melted. 

I will be serving this recipe often, until the end of the asparagus season. I don't think I would enjoy this as much, if at all, with canned asparagus.

I think this was a very good dish. My boyfriend loved it. I did a few things different though. I made the chicken as the original recipe described, but I sliced the breasts in halfs. browned them in the skillet... steamed the asparagus... I added a slice of cheese after the chicken was done before the asaparagus, on top of the asparagus and then I took the other sliced breast and placed it on top of it. I sprinkled the left-over broth, which I added about 5 oz of white wine, and drizzled balsamic vinegar as well. I added minced garlic to the breadcumbs along with FRESH BASIL. Also Parm cheese. It was very very good.

Easy and delicious. Next time, I will decrease the time asparagus cooks, 10 minutes or less, and place cheese on top at last minute or two of cooking. Also, would suggest low-sodium broth, as it seemed really salty.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I used fresh asparagus, as I do not like canned at all, and I put the cheese on at the end. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. My husband & I both agreed this would be added to our meals that we make on a regular basis. A very quick, easy & delicious recipe. The only thing I may try different next time is sprinkle some more Italian seasonings on top of the aspargus while it's cooking.

If you are not into pounding chicken...try slicing it in half lenthwise with a sharp knife. I have quit pounding! JUST BE VERY CAREFUL... This is a great basic recipe that has lots of possibilities for changing it into something new every night. Try topping it with salsa & pepperjack, OR fresh bruschetta & mozzarella, OR broccoli & cheddar cheese, OR fresh spinach & goat/feta cheese, OR fresh mushrooms & onions & provolone OR spaghetti sauce & parm cheese served over pasta. Lots of ways to change it up.

I made this last night because I had chicken and I had asparagus and needed some inspiration. I love it. It gets 5 stars because it lived up to its name, it was quick and I love that you can have all the ingredients on hand and come up with an impressive dish. I only altered it slightly and added 1 tsp of dijon mustard to the egg mixture (only used 1 egg) and that's just a chicken cutlet preference of mine. Also added some more cheese. One slice on the chicken then asparagus then another slice on top. And used fresh asparagus because I didnt even know it came in a can. Next time I am going to put some sliced tomato on the chicken, then cheese, the asparagus, then cheese again. YUM! Thanks for this recipe that easily fits into my rotation

I made this dish for my husband and me for dinner this evening; we both really enjoyed it.  I had a few modifications, which are:  I used fresh asparagus, which I quickly sauteed in a little garlic and olive oil; after browning the chicken, I deglazed the pan with a little white wine, and like others, used only half a can of broth.  I also took the recommendation of another reviewer and placed a slice of cheese on the chicken, then the asparagus, and then topped with another slice of cheese (I waited until almost the last minute, so as not to completely melt the top piece of cheese).  This meal will definitely become part of my dinner rotation.

Yes! Outstanding! I love one pan stove top dishes. Do not usually keep provolone, but bought it for this recipe. Used the 1/2 chichen, 1/2 white wine broth. Also, out of bread crums, used seasoned croutons ground in the processor. Have made several variations using swiss, mushrooms. First time using Asparagus.

Made this for dinner and my husband raved over it and wants to serve it when his parents visit!  My two picky boys even ate it sans asparagus.  I pounded the chicken first, and used a cup of broth and 1/2 cup white wine, fresh asparagus and given amounts of egg and bread crumbs to make six chicken breasts.  Delicious with a great presentation.  The extra sauce was poured on the egg noodles I served as a side.  Yum!

I love elaborate tasting meals that are quick...this qualifies! I accidentally dredged chicken in a bowl of shredded parmesan/romano cheese as I was not paying attention to this recipe and apparently thought I was making eggplant parmesan,lol. Cheese was from the Orzo Alfredo recipe that accompanied this meal. Anyway, I just dipped in the bread crumbs next and it turned out fabulous.  I also added about half the chicken broth to simmer, used a slice of provolone cheese on top of chicken when almost done, added fresh aparagus (steamed in microwave first)and then topped with another slice of provolone.  I placed lid on skillet until cheese started to melt nicely then served with pasta mentioned above, crusty bread and a nice chardonnay Estancia that paired well with both chicken and cream sauce pasta and runs about $12 or so. Fab quick meal and husband raved. Definitely try.

Easy... my kind of a recipe! I incorporated some of the other reviewers' suggestions:  cutting back the chicken broth and adding some wine.  I used 3/4 c. chicken broth and 1/2 cup wine.  I added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/8 tsp. pepper to the bread crumbs. I used thawed frozen asparagus spears rather than canned and I added the cheese a couple of minutes before serving... even that was too long.  Next time I will add it JUST before serving (just until melted).  Very, very good!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

i really wanted to make this recipe with fresh asparagus but the ones at my grocer's were too thick & woody looking (hello canned variety). regardless, my chicken looked beautiful & tasted delicious! we also thought this dish was very good as a leftover. thank you rosanna!

I love this recipe!  It has become a household favorite because it is so tasty and one of my favorites because it is so easy to make.  I prefer to use fresh or frozen asparagus rather than canned.  I have used many different cheeses, whatever I have on hand, but provolone is the best so far.

Very easy to make and love the one skillet to clean up. I suggest you NOT add the provolone cheese until the very end or your cheese will slide/melt off the chicken. Great taste!

I just finished eating way too much of this. It's definately not the healthiest way to eat chicken and asparagus but it's delicious. I only made a few small changes. I used 1 cup chicken broth, fresh asparagus, and I added the provolone just a couple of minutes before it was done. I also used Panko instead of bread crumbs. I added 1/2 tsp Oregano, 1/2 tsp Basil, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to season the panko but next time I think I will just season the chicken directly. Great recipe. Thanks.

I only had 2 ingredients that needed to be used, fresh asparagus and chicken and this recipe came through for a quick easy dinner.  The fresh asparagus is a must in my opinion and I also added some julienne cut sun-dried tomatoes (in oil) to each breast before layering asparagus and cheese and it was a great addition!  Hubby really liked this and I just kept the chicken plain for the kiddos!  Thanks for posting.

I thought this was good and extremely easy. I didn't have provolone so I used 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 Parmesan cheese for the breading and shredded mozzarella instead of the provolone. I also used fresh asparagus and it turned out perfect. The chicken turned out very moist and flavorful. I think I may use low sodium chicken broth next time, though.

I really liked the idea of this recipe but because I was a little concerned about how much flavor it would have, I sprinkled the chicken with lemon pepper and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. Apart from using fresh asparagus instead of canned, I made this as written, and it came out really well. Very easy, and tasty too. Thanks!

Took suggestions from previous reviewers - pounded chix thin, added cheese under and over *fresh* steamed asparagus, and used half the amount of stock. Next time I will use white wine instead of stock but this is a wonderfully tasty recipe!

I made this last nite and it was very good, everyone liked it!  I used fresh asparagus, I prefer fresh to canned.  I wish I had read the reviews prior to making as I would have decreased the liquid.  Half the amount would be plenty.  Next time I will add the cheese closer to the end of the cooking time.  It melted into the liquid a little too much but it's still a quick, easy and tasty recipe!

This was good, but not spectacular. I used fresh asparagus, which I steamed in the microwave first because I like it really soft. My provolone didn't melt totally away as other reviewers noted -- but maybe that's because I used reduced fat cheese, or maybe because I only used 8 oz of chicken stock? I think this would be better if you pounded the chicken thin and baked it after browning.

This is delicious! I did change a few things based on previous reviews and personal preference. I seasoned the chicken with Montreal Chicken seasoning, didn't use the full amount of chicken broth, put cheese directly on the chicken before topping with asparagus and then topped with another slice of cheese just before serving. I will be making this often, so yummy and so easy!

Awesome dish!!!  Loved the flavor.  I did beat the chicken out and put garlic powder and pepper before I put in the egg wash.   I added a 1/2 slice of provalone onto chicken then I added sliced roma tomatoos, the asparagus and sprinkled with parmesan cheese and the other 1/2  slice of provalone.  My husband loved it!!!

Very easy and simple recipe.  It's great for a quick and tasty dinner.  I sauteed garlic in olive oil with mushrooms before adding the chicken, which I seasoned with garlic salt, pepper and cayenne pepper.  Then, I added the chicken, a bit of white wine, and the broth.  I also used fresh asparagus, as suggested.  I agree that the cheese should be added at the very end when the meat is removed.  I also served this chicken with slices of fresh tomato.

This is definitely a keeper!  My husband and I both had seconds, which is rare.  I didn't have bread crumbs on hand, so I seasoned some crumbled Ritz crackers with basil, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper for the breading.  I also just pan-fried the chicken with cooking spray instead of oil.  I added half a slice of cheese between the chicken and the asparagus during the cooking and then added the other half on top just before serving, thanks to some of the other reviews.  This is my new favorite way to cook chicken breasts!

I made this recipe pretty much as directed and it was absolutely delicious, and very quick and easy to make.  I did add some parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs and salt and pepper.  I was surprised how juicy the chicken turns out and how quickly it cooks!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is so good and so easy.  We put a piece of provolone between the asparagus and chicken as well and let it melt.  Once the asparagus has cooked we take it off heat and add another piece of cheese.

Well, my family just loved this..the only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because i needed to follow the reviewers modifications.  Since we are a family of 5 i needed to double the recipe.  I used mozzerella cheese and only put asparagus on the adults servings (my kids wouldnt eat the yukkie green trees) and i used yellow rice...the chicken was just tender as can be!

To give this recipe a little more flavor, I add the remaining asparagus to the skillet around the chicken and poured approx 1/4 cup of balsamic dressing over everything. Mmmm - it is one of my families favorite

Excellent dish! I used panko bread crumbs seasoned with parmesan cheese and McCormick chicken seasoning. Next time I will season the chicken directly with the chicken seasoning before breading. I too used fresh asparagus. Browned the chicken a few minutes each side, topped with fresh asparagus and about half a can chicken broth and cover to let the steam cook the veggies about five minutes. I removed the chicken from the pan to a platter, topped  with provolone cheese and shaved asiago and placed in a convection oven at 170 degrees till cheese is melted and browning. I served mine over uncle bens wild rice. Not only did it look excellent on the plate it was outstanding!!     Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Fairly easy to make, and the s.o. loved it.   Only change was what was suggested by other reviewers.  Add the provolone right at the end.

The flavor combination is terrific. But like others, I filet the breasts to absorb the chicken broth and added some white wine for even more flavor. Don't skimp by using canned asparagus, use fresh. A can cannot give you the same flavor, texture or appearance. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe with fresh asparagus spears and cubes of gouda cheese. The gouda cheese doesn't dissapear or even melt too much in the cook time. It was delicious!

Found this through ingredient search for chicken and asparagus.  Used fresh asparagus, added 1/4 C of sliced baby portobello mushrooms with the chicken which I rolled in Panko breadcrumbs, and garnished at the end with chopped green onion.  15 minutes simmer left both the asparagus and the chicken perfect.  It was quick and easy, and--best of all-everybody loved it!

Use fresh asparagus and steam it for 1/2 the time and then place on top of chicken prior to baking.  The canned kind gets too soggy.

Very good.  The chicken turned out incredibly moist.  Followed other reviewers advice and waited to put the cheese on at the end and used fresh asparagus, however, no need to steam it beforehand, it was plenty tender following the recipe.  Did use chicken broth and white wine mixed for liquid and don't recommend cutting down on it.  I served this with white rice and drizzled left-over juice on the rice.  (Oh, also used a little extra cheese and some of it melted into the juice, which was really good!)

This is a tatsy recipe. I did pound the chicken breasts thin and reduce the chicken broth by half as suggested by other reviewers. The canned asparagus was a little mushy for our tastes and next time I will try it with fresh. Definitely a keeper though!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I only changed a couple of things.  1) I used fresh asparagus instead of canned and steamed the asparagus prior to adding it to the chicken. 2) I did not add the cheese until the very end. 3) I made gravy with the remaining chicken broth to put over mashed potatoes.  This is a great meal!

Made this when we had friends over at a moment's notice. The chicken is soooo juicy and the provolone is a great topper. I waited until there were 5 minutes left to put the asparagus on and then placed the cheese on once it was done cooking. I found that when I put the asparagus in at the suggested time it turned out way too mushy for my taste. But overall this was a HUGE hit and it was a snap to make!

This was so delicious, and very easy. I used fresh asparagus, but kept everything else as is.    The bread crumbs and quality of olive oil count here.  I have used several brands of bread crumbs and have found the Kroger store brand to be the best.  it has the perfect spice blend, and isn't too salty.  The only change I might make next time is to poach the asparagus separately in the broth, as the bottom "crust" on the chicken gets really soggy after it is cooked in the liquid.

Great meal! I used all the ingredients but in smaller amounts. 1 egg instead of 2 (I had 3 chicken breasts) and should've listened to others bc I thought 1/2 cup of chicken broth was too little, so I used 1 cup. Definitely use 1/2 cup, you don't need 1 cup. I waited until everything was cooked and placed the provolone cheese on and let it melt on it's own and it was fantastic. I used fresh asparagus vs the canned as well. I can't wait to make this again. Thanks for a great dinner!!

Great recipe.  First of all let me just say I rarely cook.  And when I do it's the same old things over and over again.  So I wanted to try something new.  When I presented this meal to him, he first said "Wow that smells great"!!  Then he tasted it....it was all over then!  He LOVED it!!  Thank you so so much for sharing this recipe.

This was fantastic.  Followed the recipe to the "t" and it was superb.  Next time I'll probably use fresh asparagus and a touch less broth.  This would also be great over a bed of pasta with marinara sauce. Yum!

This just wasn't what I expected.  I used fresh asparagus instead of canned but we just didn't like it and I love all of the ingredients.  I think I might try it adding a little salt and pepper before breading.  Also, I would like to put it in the oven to keep the breading crisp and just leave out the broth.  Maybe the soft breading was what was bad. Sorry.

This recipe is fantastic!!! I read all reviews before trying and did a little of my own tweaking.  I too used fresh asparagus and also topped with diced tomatoes and fresh mozzerella and parmesean, but did not put the cheeses on until done, covered to melt. I did not have bread crumbs on hand, so my husband and I crushed up Wheat Thins and Ritz crackers, dipped in egg and sprinkled salt, pepper and a little garlic salt on top of chicken. The only change I will make next time is eliminate the garlic salt and sautee fresh garlic before placing chicken in olive oil. I also did not have broth so I used boullion cube instead.  Thanks for a simple great recipe!

This was wonderful! So easy and so pretty on the plate! I used swiss cheese and fresh asp. that was the only changes I made. I served it over a bed of angel hair pasta with a little alfredo sauce(from this site) and sauted fresh mushrooms. My boyfriend was impressed and thanked me for making him such a nice supper! WOW! Thanks! I will be making this again and this is company worthy! I just ate leftovers that I nuked at work and its real good warmed up too!

The chicken was very moist.  I usually shy away from breasts since they are often dry.  I used less oil, next time may not even bread it.  Added morel mushrooms (had them on hand) with the fresh asparagus. per other reviews, used less broth and swiss cheese. Could use a little more spice. But overall, will make this again, maybe with thighs instead.

Following the reviews I used fresh asparagus, I boiled them in a wok and used that water instead of the chicken broth. I also added some fresh sliced mushrooms.

I made various modifications to this recipe and came out delicious! Instead of using egg beat...I marinated for an hour in Mrs. Dash Garlic and Lime marinade. I then coated in Parmesean bread crumbs...sauteed with a little olive oil and canola oil cooking spray. Instead of canned chicken broth, I use Herb~Ox sodium free brand of chicken broth...one packet mixed with hot water = cup of broth but only used 1/2 c and white wine to taste. Used fresh asparagus added Oscar Meyer bacon bits and only used 1/2 slice of Provolone cheese for each. I found Frigio Provolone has least amount of fat and saturated fat than other brands. Added McMormick Garlic Sea Salt at the end.

This is an awesome recipe. So quick and easy. We loved it. I did wait til everything was done and then put the Provolone on, just long enough to start it melting.

At first I thought "Yuk canned asparagus" but, it sounded intriguing so I tried it.  My first thouht was correct - YUK canned asparagus.  Do yourself a favor use fresh asparagus I gave it a 2nd try with fresh and it made ALL the difference; it went from yuk to great).

This probably would have gotten a 5 had I not goofed on the recipe!  I decided not to bread it to cut down on carbs and deep frying, so instead I just browned it on both sides with some olive oil.  And then I goofed and forgot to add in the broth which I think affected the way the cheese melted.  I also used frozen aparagus as opposed to canned.  The flavor was awesome, but the cheese didn't stick to the chicken quite right, so I had to kind of pick up the melted cheese with a spoon and drizzle it back over the chicken.  We all enjoyed it though, and I will be making it again.

Very good!  I took other reviewer's suggestions and added only 1 cup of broth and a splash of wine.  Also added cheese over asparagus at the end of cooking.  Chicken was not at all soggy but very, very tender.

This was fantastic!!! I did only use about 1/2 of the chicken broth as other suggested.  I put freash asparagus and portabella mushrooms on the chichen and used garlic bread crumbs instead of Italian crumbs.  Thank you for the great recipe!!!!

We loved this recipe.  Made a few changes.  Did not bread just sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic powder before browning.  Reduced broth to 1/2, used fresh asparagus and baked.  Will make this often.

This recipe was good but I had to change a few things.  My grocery store doesn't sell chicken broth (that's Belgium for ya) and I didn't feel like making it myself so I used white wine for the sauce.  I also added chopped fresh mushrooms, 1 tomato sliced and 1 small chopped onion.  I don't care much for asparagus so I put string beans on my piece, as previously suggested.  So I put all the veggies over and around the chicken as it simmered.  I also got a couple extra cheese slices and put on another layer right before serving (otherwise the cheese kinda disappears).  But I love this recipe, it is definitely QUICK and also very TASTY.  Thanks Rosanna!

My husband liked this, but did not love it. I didn't like it very much at all.  I must have done something wrong.  I did brown the chickin with the crumbs and it looked good, but once stock went in the pan, it got mushy.  Didn't much like the texture, the look or combo of flavours.

Absolutely delicious... used fresh asparagus and put it beside chicken to cook. Put grated cheese with bread crumbs to dip, and added chicken broth and white wine to simmer after browning. Also used fresh mozzarella and put on dish towards end of cooking to melt..even put in oven at very end to finish melting. Really tasty- will definitely make again!

Really good, and easy. The beauty of this site is you can look at the recipes and comments and make it how it works for you, using what you have. I had tenders and fresh asparagus and a provolone/mozzarella blend. Used a Jaccard on the tenders, one egg, and coated in a bag with Italian bread crumbs and grated Parmesan. Added the shredded cheese near the end. And reduced the broth.

Absolutely delicious! I used fresh asparagus, which I put into the pan raw not steamed. They steamed wonderfully!!! I also used shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese because I didn’t have provolone slices. I waited until 2 minutes before serving to place the cheese on so it was nicely melted. Definitely will make again!

This was fantabulous! I made a few changes based on what I had in the house. I used tenderloins instead of breasts, fresh asparagus, parmesan herb panko crumbs, half the broth and added precooked bacon. Served it over angel hair pasta. This was a definite hit at my house. Will be adding this to my rotation.

Very good- family loved it. Did follow other suggestions and used 1/2c chicken broth and 1/4c white wine. Pounded chicken breast to about 1/2 inch  before dipping. Used fresh asparagus and it steamed well in the 15 min. Also added thin sliced tomatoes towards the end of cooking time for those of us who like tomatoes. Substituted shredded pizza cheese as I was out of provolone, and added at the end also to just melt it.

A quick and easy recipe I've been making for some time now.  Very good as written.  I follow PeggyinOhio's suggestions with a twist of my own.  Fresh asparagus, pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness, and use 1/2 cup of wine.  For a more brown and crispy breading, I prefer to half the Italian bread crumbs with a 1/2 cup of Panko bread crumbs and I also mix in about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan.  Following Steph's review I've always found one egg sufficient for this recipe.  Lastly, as another reviewer mentioned, I find it best to add the Provolone towards the last minute or so.  Awesome recipe.  Thanks for sharing!  .

This is my wife's favorite. I made this for our 10th wedding anniversary dinner at home. We usually go out for sushi on our special day but we decided to stay home instead. Was better than sushi could ever be. Defiantly will make it again.

Due to the size of the chicken breasts, I had to make this in the oven.  Next time I'll try it in the skillet and it'll surely be juicier.  Looks impressive when serving.

As is this recipe is a bit bland in flavor.  I added a little garlic salt, pepper and onion powder to my bread crumbs and was still not quite enough.  The breading will get soggy after cooking in the broth, but the meat came out  very tender.  It was nice presentation wise with the asparagus and cheese.  I used fresh asparagus and let it cook for a few minutes before topping it with chopped ham and cheese.   I would try this again, but would add some additional seasonings.

Absolutely delicious! I loved this meal. All in one, fast, and easy. You can't go wrong. I used parmesan bread crumbs and monterey jack cheese cause those are what I had. It turned out fantastic. Thanks for the quick dinner!

My husband and I love this recipe.  I've made it several times - it's so quick and easy.  I didn't have provolone the last time I made it and used mozerella and it still turned out great.

We really enjoyed this. I loved using the chicken broth because it helped cook the chicken properly and ensured that the breadcrumbs wouldn't burn. I recommend using only 1 egg, and only 1/2 the amount of broth, if you don't want as much. There was definitely a large amount of broth left over, which I drizzled over the chicken. Very good!

AWESOME HEALTHY recipe!  After reading reveiws, I used Panko instead (Japanese version of bread crumbs, less sodium and preserves) and added spices to it (Cayenne, Paprika, Garlic powder, Onion powder, and Italian seasoning).  I also used Green Beans because I don't really like asparagus.  Used half can of broth as others stated and it worked out perfect.  I did not pound out the chicken, wasn't necessary.  I also felt 5 TBS of olive oil was too much so the second time I made it I used only 3 TBS and it was enough.  I added Provolone cheese to it 2 min before done, and put the lid back on during that time to get the cheese all melty on top of it.  I read others preferred it more on the chicken but I thought that would be too much with the breading and stuff and it was. I tried both ways and my bf and I preferred cheese on top of beans, brings it all together best that way.

This was a great recipe, so quick and easy. However, if I had it to do over again I would have gotten FRESH asparagus and just let it cook longer in the broth. Soggy asparagus is nasty. Also maybe I would have gotten better provolone. I just used some regular packaged sliced kind. I will definitely make again though. The chicken was so tender I didn't need a knife to cut.

Very yummy! I flattened the breasts and marinated each with 1 tbsp of Dale's Reduced Sodium Marinade, garlic powder, onion powder and Lite Tony Cachere's. I used liquid egg whites, panko and grated parmesan cheese for the chicken coating to cut some calories.  I browned in a skillet for about 3 minutes on both sides. I used about a cup of reduced sodium chicken broth and 1/2 cup white cooking wine to deglaze the pan. (Next time I will use a little less liquid.) Then I  finished it in the oven on 425 degrees for 30 minutes while putting the cheese on for the last 3 minutes.  Definitely a keeper!

I have tried this recipe twice now once with provolone cheese and once with muenster.  The chicken is juicy and tender.  My husband really likes this recipe will make it a regular.  Also just the two of us so I half the recipe.

Steamed my asparagus separately and then added just a bit before the chicken was done. Thanks to all the reviewers who suggested adding the provolone about 1 minute before taking out, it sure melts quickly.

Delicious! Very easy to make and yet the presentation and taste will make your family doubt that. :) I followed the advice from a previous reviewer to put cheese under the asparagus and then add some on top at the very end. It helped keep the asparagus in place when serving. People in the lunchroom at work saw my leftovers and wanted the recipe. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks!

The sauce tasted bland to me so I made a few changes.  I doubled the sauce so that I could stir half of it into the pasta that I served with the chicken.  To the sauce I added salt, pepper, 2 Tbl. butter and 1/2 cup wine and thickened the broth with a little cornstarch.  I also added grated Romano cheese in the breadcrumbs, I sprinkled some on top of the chicken and also stirred some in the pasta.  I am feeding a family of six and I had a lot of chicken to brown and not enough room in the skillet to let all of the chicken simmer in the sauce.  After browning the chicken, I placed it in a baking pan.  After I prepared the sauce, I poured some over the chicken, asparagus (parboiled fresh) and cheese and baked it in the oven for about five minutes just until the cheese melted.  Very good.

OMG this is good! I had on hand chicken breast with ribs attached so I had to adjust the cooking time. When the chicken was at 165 degrees I added the fresh asparagas to steam. While the chicken was resting I added the cheese to melt. I scraped the pan and placed the remaining sauce on top of it all, yum. My husband also says 5 stars.

This was excellent. The only thing i did different was to use just a half a can of chicken broth and add the asparagas towards the very end not to overcook it, then add the cheese after you turn off the heat. I also added a slice of ham over the chicken since i had some leftover from Easter. De-lish!

This was delicious, truly easy and tasty.  Only needed one egg for dip, used fresh asparagus, and 1 cup of chicken broth.  I can not wait to make this again and may add mushrooms.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe

We found this to be just "ok."  The chicken was tender, but there was no flavor. I even salt & peppered the chicken before prepping. Maybe it would be better with some herbs mixed in with the bread crumbs.

This recipe is a keeper!  Even my very picky 8 year old ate everything on his plate.  I did make some personal modifications:  To make it healthier, I used only 3 T of olive oil and could have gone down to 2 T.  I also only used 1 egg and unseasoned bread crumbs, adding herbs de provence, salt and pepper for flavor.  I chose chicken breast strips and broccoli (kids won't eat asparagus) and served the plate with homemade, whole wheat mac and cheese.  Very healthy, very yummy dinner.

I made this for my husband and me last night. It was really good. I used fresh asparagus and Swiss cheese. Also only used 1 egg and 1/2 can chicken broth. The cheese still melted so much and practically disappeared, even tho I added it about 3 min. before the end. The asparagus was also a little too soft/cooked for my preference, but still really good. Easy recipe. Will definitely make this again. I served with scalloped potatoes. Yum!

This was good - but I didn't like the picture - call me crazy but I like to have the meat, veggies and pasta separated on the plate, not stacked in one pile.  I'd definitely make this again, though.

Didn't know asparagus came in a can until I read this recipe...who would have thought?  Obviously used fresh and followed directions as written.  Always looking for different chicken recipes and this one is a keeper.

I just served the asparagus on the side and I used fresh.  I'm not so fond of canned asparagus since it's texture is just mush.  Great recipe!!

This recipe is great! It is so easy to prepare and everyone in the family likes it. I always struggle with making sure chicken is cooked, but not dry. This is moist & flavorful. Only change I made was to use fresh asparagus. I definitely recommend this one!

This was very good. The chicken was very tender. I did follow the recipe exactly. The chicken did turn out a little bland. Next time I will season the chicken more, or marinade it first.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes, but my husband is the ONLY one who likes asparagus.  So I make one chicken breast with asparagus, and the rest with freshly steamed broccoli.  Works for us! :)

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 white wine and 1/2 chicken broth...that made all the difference!  I also used fresh asparagus, which cooked perfectly on top of the chicken!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used Bakin Miracle. I also butterflied the chicken breasts after browning and added garlic to the chicken broth. Chicken was VERY flavorful! Definately a keeper.

Decent recipe and easy to make. Used fresh asparagus instead. My husband liked it and wants it again in the future. I thought it was okay but will make again. Kind of blah for my liking so will add other spices in the future.

This is a fantastic, restaurant quality, easy and fast dish!  It is wonderful with fresh asparagus and of course, a little extra cheese.  I place a little cheese down before I place asparagus on top to stabilize.  I top with remaining cheese right before serving.  Yummy!!

I was in a pinch and needed a quick yummy dinner and this hit the spot.  I followed directions exactly, but used fresh asparagus and only added mozarella (that's all I had) about 2-3 minutes before chicken was done.  I will most definately make again!  Thanks

This was a great recipe. Made it for dinner last night and it was very yummy. My husband also loved it. I would suggest like other reviewers to add the cheese to almost the end of cooking time, I did that and it turned out perfectly. Other than that cooked the recipe as is. Next time I think I will try fresh asparagus to make it even better. Will be a regular in my house. Great recipe Thanks

This was a pretty simple, straightforward recipe that could use some tweaking to make it fantastic. I should have used fresh asparagus, don't know why I didn't since I really don't like asparagus from a can. Also, it seemed like kind of a waste of chicken broth. You really don't need all that much, or you're just pouring it down the drain. It's got great simple flavors though, and it WAS quick and easy, so I'll try it again and play with it a little bit, which I'm sure will improve my opinion some.

Awesome.if you are just starting out to cook, this will impress. my minor changes: i used 1/2 cup broth, 1/2 cup white wine. soo moist. also i took pork chops out instead of the chicken before i left for work, so i used the pork chops. still great. I also waited till the end to add the cheese.  I unfortunalty reduced the sauce, which was a mistake as there was no sauce to add to plates. but it was still moist.

It was okay to eat once but not a recipe I would repeat. I used fresh asparagus (which I normally adore) but it acquired a funny taste after it was cooked with the chicken. I gave it 3 stars since it was easy to make and not horrible tasting. (but I would not call it good tasting either)

Absolutely delicious!  Fast & easy.  Like someone suggested before me, though, I would wait until the last minute to add the provolone.  I'll also substitute fresh asparagus instead of canned next time.

Absolutely delicious!  I took other reviewer's advice and only added half the broth and I also added white wine.  I used chicken breast cutlets and cooked them in half the time.  I added freshly grated romano cheese to the breadcrumbs and put the provolone on 2 minutes before they were done.  Everyone raved!  Thank you!

The chicken was very moist.  However, if I make this again, I will not add the Provolone cheese until the end...maybe last minute, because it melted into a big, rubbery glob.  Also...I think a whole can of chicken broth is way too much.

This was very delicious, husband felt some salt/pepper could have been added, but enjoyed this quick dinner!
I used the white asparagus (in a jar) and it worked great!

Reduced liquid by half and baked after browning for about 40 mins at 425. Added cheese for last 5 mins. Turned out perfect, very juicy. Family raved!

This was pretty good although next time I will use only half a can of chicken broth.  I used stewed tomato in place of the asparagus because its what I had on hand.
