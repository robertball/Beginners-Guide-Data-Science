Fantastic cake! I didn't tell anyone that it was vegan so they wouldn't prejudge the cake. They loved it and were shocked to know it was vegan!  Simple recipe to make, relatively cheap ingredients...this one is a keeper.  
I used a 1/2 cup of cocoa instead of the listed 1/4 cup and baked it in a 9" circle cake pan that I lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  It took about 35 minutes to fully cook.
For a vegan 'buttercream' frosting I mixed together 1/4 cup softened margerine, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, and about half a tablespoon soymilk or enough to make the consistensy spreadable.  Hope this helps someone! Happy Baking!

I made this cake last night and it was wonderful.  I replaced the white sugar for 3/4 cup of honey, used WW flour and used applesause for the oil.

Try using Balsamic Vinegar instead when you are doing something with chocolate. I would even use a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon. Not many people know that Chocolate and Balsamic were meant to go to gather. 
If you really want to ramp it up put in a pinch of cayenne pepper. Chocolate, Balsamic, and Cayenne are one of the best dessert trios that you have never heard of; or even thought about using together.

This cake was deeee-licious.  I've found that if you make it the day before you want to eat it, it is even better.  (it actually seems a little more moist when it is not REALLY fresh).  I have also taken the advice of another reviewer and made this cake without the cocoa, adding 2 mashed bananas and replacing the vanilla with banana extract.  It turned out like banana bread and was fantastic frosted with banana frosting(1 cup powdered beet sugar, 1 tsp banana extract, 1/4 cup margerine and 1 tbsp. soy milk beaten until smooth and fluffy)

This cake is wonderfull!  Moist and delicious! I doubled this recipe and made two 9" square layers for a two layer cake. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I noticed the batter seemed kind of thin, but the cakes baked up fluffy and moist.  I might add a little more cocoa powder next time but this was delicious!  I put seedless raspberry preserves in between the layers, then frosted with Vegan Vanilla frosting, then bordered the top and bottom edges with fresh raspberries.  Made a great birthday cake!

This cake turns out very well--not too dry, not too dense, and with enough chocolate taste.  I make it often for my coworkers and they keep requesting it again and again.  They are always surprised to hear that it is vegan.  I just tried making it as a cupcake, as well, and I love it even more.  It has a great texture and plenty of flavor.  I got 15 cupcakes out of the recipe and baked them for 20-30 minutes.  I topped them with a veganized buttercream recipe.

I make a recipe similar to this very often.  It makes a very moist and delicious cake or cupcakes, and is easily doubled for a 13X9 pan.  In my recipe, I use 3/8 C oil and substitute 1 1/2 TBS lemon juice for the vinegar, (it does the same thing)  There is no flavor of vinegar or lemon.  I've used both.
It's also great served with mint frosting.
Mint Frosting:
3 TBS margerine 
1 1/2 - 2 C powdered sugar 
1 TBS soy milk or water 
1/2 tsp peppermint extract
green food coloring optional

My daughter is allergic to milk, so I made this for her birthday. I made it into cupcakes and threw in some dairy free chocolate chips and they were awesome.

um, this is the best cake I've ever made! I doubled the recipes, added a lil' extra baking soda and vinegar and presto! DON'T overcook this! I don't know why someone said this was dry. cake's are often dry cause' you leave it in the oven too long. For a great vegan icing, make a whipped frosting such as http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/WhippedFrosting.asp but substitute w/soy milk n' olive oil spread. add some cocoa. its great! The paste in the frosting recipes WILL look gross but don't worry it turns out just like Ann says!

Overall, this recipe isn't bad.  A few issues:  -I made sure to use UNBLEACHED all-purpose flour.  -White sugar is NOT VEGAN! It's often white due to the "bone-char" method.  I used raw cane sugar.  -I used apple cider vinegar rather than white, sea salt, olive oil instead of vegetable/canola oil, and all ingredients were organic.  With a few mods, this cake is FINALLY vegan, and quite delicious!

I am absolutely stunned.  This has got to be one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever tasted and I am not exagerating.  I am not vegan but work in an environment where there are mostly vegans.  We had a potluck and I found this recipe on NPR.  I looked at the ingredients and thought that this cake was going to be absolutely nasty... OMG was I wrong!  This is the moistest, most dense and chocolatey chocolate cake ever.  I have tasted a many chocolate cakes in my life and there are bakeries that don't come close to how good this is.  You can either use water or soy milk.  I made this cake twice and used water for 1 and soy milk for the other and they were both delicious.  Make this.  You will not be disappointed and if you don't tell anyone it is vegan, believe me... they will not know!

I've been using this recipe ever since I found it in the Betty Crocker Cookbook years ago under the heading "Chocolate Snack Cake". The cake is moist and perfect, even with applesauce instead of oil, and even better the next day. It does smell a tiny bit vinegary while it's baking (not like fish, as another reviewer stated) but there is no vinegar flavor once the cake cools. If you taste it while it's still warm, it will seem like it's not sweet enough. Give it a little while. No frosting required, either. And it really is as dark as the photo, though it's not quite as dark before baking. Skip the sifting and put all dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Whisk together, then add all wet ingredients and whisk until smooth- this part only takes 10 seconds or so. Brewed coffee can be substituted for the water for an even richer flavor, but the original recipe calls for cold water so I use cold coffee if substituting. Also, I use a rounded 1/3 C. of cocoa powder. It only takes about 20 minutes to cook in my very old electric oven, and I use either a standard round cake pan or an 8"x8" square pan. I am not vegan, but it's nice to be able to have chocolate cake even when I'm out of eggs, or want to save them for another recipe. Since finding this, I truly have no need for another chocolate cake recipe. Easy and delicious. Thank you, Sue, for sharing this.

I made this cake in a bundt pan and served it for dessert at a dinner with 1 vegan, 1 vegetarian and my very carnivorous boyfriend.  I also drizzled the following glaze over it: 2T. cocoa, 1T+2t. hot water, 1T. oil and 1 c. powdered sugar.  It was incredible!  Everyone loved it!!

Very nice! I replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil and used slightly more than 1/3 of the cup. I also used 1 and 1/2 cups of soy milk instead of 1 cup--I found that it really needed the liquid. And I added a pinch of cinnamon and a teaspoon of french vanilla flavoured coffee.

Finally, I made the vegan buttercream icing using 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 teaspoons cocoa and a few splashes of soymilk. Beat it with an electric mixer.

Baking for 35 min instead of the recommended 45 also helped moistness, which ended up being just right.

This cake was excellent, but remember to use your own judgement for moistness adding ingredients or making changes as necessary.

a super wonderful cake. I had a vegan guest for Easter dinner today and this cake went down a storm for all of us - vegan and not. I could not believe there was not an egg in there! perfect texture  - very moist with a nice crumb. I nearly doubled the cocoa powder and I subbed the water with cooled decaf coffee to intensify the flavour

This is a fabulous recipe! I made it first for a picnic with friends and we all loved it. Two days later I made four more to give to friends. It is a sure hit! I even adapted it by leaving out the cocoa, using orange juice for the water and orange extract and grated orange zest. It was just as fabulous. To help ease it out of the pan, spay the pan with Pam, loosen with a butter knife. I used a souffle pan and it worked perfectly. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Very Good! I have used so many recipes from this site for our coffee shop and this one was a hit. I like to fool people who dislike vegan food. I only changed a few things: Silk soy milk instead of water with a 1 tsp instant coffee, pure maple syrup instead of sugar(sometimes ground on animal bone char to make it white), 1/2 cup coca powder. We didn't need to add frosting; goes great with coffee

This is a totally awsome cake. You can also forget the chocolate, use banana extract instead of the vanilla and add two very ripe mashed bananas. Everything else is the same.(Grease and flour the pan} Bake in a standard loaf pan until a poker comes out clean, you can't taste the vinegar at all.

This cake was amazing. Honestly, I've never had a better chocolate cake. Very rich, very spongy, and it baked so well. I put it in a 9" Pyrex circular glass cake pan, and it rose like a dome in the middle, did not sink, and didn't even get a single crack in the middle. It looked beautiful and tasted even better. I used another reviewer's suggestion for a vegan buttercream frosting: mixed together 1/4 cup softened margerine (mine was hard from the fridge, so I grated it with a cheese grater then added it), 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, and a couple dashes of rice milk -- enough to make the consistency spreadable. My frosting turned out a bit watery and lumpy, so maybe sifting the powdered sugar first would have helped? It hardened a bit, but I couldn't really pile the frosting on the cake. Everyone loved the frosting/cake combination, and it was all very easy to put together. My minor changes: added an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and used 1 tsp lemon juice instead of white vinegar. Delicious! This will be my go-to recipe for chocolate cake from now on! I also made this recipe into cupcakes and baked them for exactly 20 minutes at 350, and they came out perfect once again!

This cake was dense, but very good and pretty moist too. I wasn't sure how a vegan cake would taste, but it was excellent. I found a vegan german chocolate frosting recipe and topped the cake with that. It was a hit at work.

Although I increased the cocoa powder to ½ cup as others suggested, I definitely believe this is a 5 star recipe. The cake wasn’t dry at all! On the contrary it was soft and moist both the first and the second day. Unfortunately, there wasn’t any left the third day.

This is a great recipe not only for a vegan, but it uses ingriedients you already have on hand. If you are out of eggs. No problem with this recipe and it tastes great!

I modified this recipe somewhat.  I used 3 T. cocoa increased the vinegar to 1 T. and omitted the oil.  I made mini-cupcakes and baked them for 10 min.  I also used one of those cans of oil/flour spray and sprayed the paper cupcake holdes before I put the batter in.  They came out very moist despite the fact that I actually forgot to put in the oil.  They stayed lovely and moist till 4 days later, when they were finally consumed. I didn't frost them either, b/c they were perfect without.

My good friend is a vegan and complained to me that there are no good cake recipes. I made this recipe and not only did he love it, but even non-vegans ate it. It came out great. The only thing is, I lined the pan with parchment paper before baking and made a vegan chocolate frosting. I filled the cake with sliced strawberries and strawberry gel. Very good! Can't even tell it's vegan!

These were excellent and I used a cup of rice flour with a 1/2 cup of almond flour. Almond flour gives a really good taste- but not an overwhelming one. and there are PLENTY of vegan sugar brands.

I love this cake. I sometimes make cupcakes by putting a tablespoon or so of batter in the cups, then a dollop of Polaner's red raspberry all-fruit (pick your favorite), then cover it with more batter - YUM! The berry deliciousness tastes great with the chocolate-y flavor of the cake. Double the cocoa! I also used apple cider vinegar, since that's what I had on hand. Dusted the tops with powdered sugar and I had a serious hit on my hands!

Easy and pretty tasty, considering I typically like my baked goods with butter and eggs.  I took some suggestions posted in previous reviews: 1/2 cup cocoa, switched water for black coffee, and baked 20 minutes as cupcakes.  I frosted them with melted chocolate chips plus a little canola oil and a splash of coffee.

Loved it! Very similar to the cake I order at our local vegetarian restaurant. I used a 9" round silicone cake pan and cooked for 30 min. @ 350. It was very moist and I didn't have any problems with it sticking to the pan as other reviewers have noted.

This is the first vegan cake I have ever baked and I chose it based on its positive reviews. Having never baked vegan before, I never knew what to expect; what differentiates a bad vegan cake from a good one. I baked the recipe as suggested but used 1/2 cup cocoa instead of 1/4. I also baked them in cupcake form, so I reduced the baking time to 22 minutes. They rose beautifully and are definitely the most perfect looking cupcakes I have ever baked, however, next time I bake them I will reduce the cooking time to about 17 minutes because the tops of the cupcakes, though perfectly domed, are a bit crunchy. I am about to ice them with a vegan buttercream, so I am sure that by tomorrow they will have lost their crunchy tops and will perhaps be a bit more moist. Next time I think I will use more cocoa and perhaps add chocolate chips. I think I will try another vegan chocolate cake recipe just to check the differences, but all in all I am very impressed with this recipe, many thanks for posting it!

It is so funny to me that this cake is such a popular vegan choice, because I have been eating this cake since I was a child.  This was the exact recipe my grandmother used to make everyone's birthday cake, for years.  I believe its origins have something to do with WWII and the scarcity of butter and eggs - they had to find some other way to make cakes, and so came along this recipe.  It is definitely better the next day, moister and denser.  I tried making it recently with more cocoa and less sugar, and it was delicious.

Wow. I'll make a long story short - our 2nd daughter is allergic to practically everything under the sun, so making baked goods for her can be difficult. This recipe is what I've been looking for! No eggs, no dairy, no worries, just good cake. I did use rice milk in place of water and it turned out GREAT! Once I've made a layer cake (double recipe) and once I've made cupcakes (single recipe = 12 cupcakes). Others can't even tell that it's "allergen-free" for our daughter. THANK YOU, SUE!
**update** We now have to avoid gluten, but I've used Bob's Red Mill gluten free all purpose flour in this recipe and it's fantastic. Still can't tell it's not "normal" cake!

I made this for my son's 1st birthday and it was great.  I also made vegan cream cheese frosting.  We told no one at the party and everyone loved it.  This is a great dense cake and really good.  I did double the cocoa and it was nice and chocolatey.  This is a great cake if you are vegan or not and perfect for my little one with a dairy allergy.  Thanks!

I only have one complaint, the cake sticks to the pan.  I'm not sure what to do to make it more cakelike in texture.  It comes out like a supermoist brownie.  It is tasty though!

Tried this out and loved it.  The first batch I made I took some suggestions from other reviews I:
- Replaced the oil with applesauce
- used 1/2 cup of cocoa powder
- used balsamic vinegar instead of white.
I did NOT like it, first I do think I over baked it slightly so they were kind of dry but also, I found it had a weird taste and to me I thought it was the balsamic vinegar.... So I did another batch, this time with ALL the same changes except using:
- Apple cider vinegar in place of white or balsamic
This batch turned out fantastic, I paid more attention to my baking time and they came out super moist, with no weird taste.  Best of all, no one who tried it believed they were vegan (some I didn't tell until after they tried it and told me what they thought).  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I used equivalent applesauce to oil and they turned out amazing! I added ghiradelli 60% chocolate chips for an extra chocolately muffin. Oh yeah, I made muffins instead of a cake. I baked them for about 35 minutes and filled the cups with batter about 3/4 of the way. Awesome! Thanks for sharing :)

This cake is perfect with modifacations. Without it is so-so. Substitute the white sugar with vegan sugar to keep it real. I put 1/2 C. cocoa powder instead of 1/4 C. for MUCH better flavor. Also I add a pinch of cinnamon and smaller pinch of nutmeg. I added a bit more oil (50/50 light oilve oil and Earth Balance butter to keep it vegan) and coffee liqueur with slightly less water to the cake recipe. I skip the vinagar for flavor and texture as it makes the cake more flakey. I like it more moist and dense. (just my taste). For frosting I added coffee liqueur to 3 oz. unsweetened chocolate, powdered sugar, vanilla, a little water and earth balance butter. Melt butter/choc. add other liquids and pour into 1.5 cups powdered sugar. Cake was moist and frosting was perfect. I split the cake recipe into 2 batches and made it a layer cake. I bake it at 350 for 20 minutes. I have a picky vegan in the house and she loved it. I made it a few times for guests and they were shocked that it was vegan. The cake wants to stick so let it cool well before removing from cake pans and gently flip it. I patched it with frosting the first time and no one knew any better. I am making it again today. We freeze it and it is great weeks later. We keep it in tupper ware for days in the fridge and it stays moist.

Wonderful, wonderful recipe. I would definitely up the cocoa powder next time, but they are yummy as is. I frosted them with nutella, which effectively deveganizes them, but we must all make sacrifices for THE GREATER GOOD.  Alternatively, I used whole wheat flour and added about half a cup of rolled oats to the batter and then used strawberry jam as my frosting. Made a wonderful breakfast.

I had my mom make this cake for my vegan brother's birthday, and I must say I was really impressed! I am not a vegan and I was a little afraid to try it out, but it is wonderful! My mom added a bag of non-dairy chocolate chips and that made it gooey chocolatey in the center which was nice. It went really well with a tall glass of ice cold milk lol!

This cake kicked serious . It was moist, dense and everything I wanted in a cake. I made it for my co-workers and they finished it  in less than 30 minutes. I added a teaspoon of almond extract as well and a little more oil. By accident, by turning off the heat after around 30-35 minutes and leaving the cake to cool in the oven made it extra moist and better.

This is a very good, very chocolate, very moist cake.  You'd never guess it's vegan, I actually like it better than "normal" chocolate cake recipes.

Thank you for this recipe – it worked out perfectly and all the “non-vegan’s” where happy! I made them into cupcakes for my little one’s B-Day party.   I used whole wheat pastry flour, substituted the oil for apple sauce, and used raw sugar and it worked great.  For frosting I used 1 cup powdered sugar (the good stuff – as good as you can get for a refined product), 2 tsp. vanilla, ¼ cup Vegan Margarine (which I melted), and added cocoa until it was the color I wanted.   Everyone went crazy for the frosting and it complemented the cupcakes well!

My girlfriend and I loved these but she LOVED them. Kind of to an extreme. I added a vegan peanut butter icing by mixing 1 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/2 cup vegan margarine, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 3 tbsp soy milk.

This was fantastic.  The best cake ever.  I made it for my SIL birthday as he has a dairy allergy.  I doubled the cocoa, used almond extract instead of vanilla, and used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup almond milk.  It baked in 35 minutes in a 9 inch round pan lined with parchment and the sides greased and floured.  It came out perfectly.  I left it covered in the fridge over night and frosted it in the morning with Pillsbury's chocolate frosting as that is dairy free then topped it with raspberries.  It was loved by all and already has become a request for other birthdays.  Thank you for such a lucious recipe.

Sue thank you for posting this.  I printed this recipe back in January 2006, and use it to this day.  IT'S ALWAYS A BIGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG HIT! 

I make it exactly as mentioned in the recipe, but I cut back on the sugar.

YUMMMMM!

Really really good!! Instead of using the full 1/3 cup oil I used one small mashed banana and 1 tbsp oil. I also made it into cupcakes (made ten and baked them for 20 minutes). They turned out sooo good, really moist and super chocolatey! Marvelous!

This was pretty good.  I upped the cocoa to 1/2 C. and used soymilk instead of water.  3 out of my 4 children liked them.  Not bad considering they never have had vegan cupcakes.  A good base choc. recipe for adding/changing things around with.  This does have the perfect crumb and texture though which is a huge plus since I'm picky about that.

It tastes funny...   I halved the recipe and only kept in in the oven for 29 minutes, I also replaced oil for applesauce. I'm definately going to add maybe 1/2-1/4 a cup extra of cocoa or something that will improve taste.   I put in a chocolate vegan frosting filler and it looks pretty nice, maybe I'll make this again.

I made this cake into cupcakes and they came out amazing. Some of my hubby's co-workers are vegan and it's hard to send goodies to work and excluding people. Per other reviewers I used 1/2 cup of chocolate powder instead of the 1/4 cup.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to give it a kick.  Overall my hubby couldn't tell they were vegan and trust me he's not the vegan type.   I thought they were pretty tasty. :D

Update:
I'm addicted to this recipe.  I have made it for several people now.  This past week I made it for friend that is allergic to a lot of things.  This recipe taste better the second day.  It's super moist and very tasty.  The changes I've made are 1 cup + 2 tbsp of cake flour 1/2 cup of ap flour. 1/2 tsp of vanilla for added flavor. 3/4 cups of cocoa. Even if you don't change a thing this recipe is pretty tasty. :D Enjoy.

For me, 5 stars for the texture of the cake, but 3 stars for the taste. The texture was great, moist, unbelieveable for vegan cake. Exactly the same with One Bowl Chocolate Cake III (from this website-non vegan). But it was tasteless. Agreed with other reviewer to increase the cocoa to 1/3-1/2 cup. Not chocolate-y enough for me. And better add more sugar next time. If you frosted it, I think the taste will not so bland. Will do adjustment for next baking.

Great Recipe! I've made tonnes of these vegan kinds and they never turn out good. This is by far the best vegan chocolate cupcake I've ever had. I did up the cocoa powder to give the cake a more chocolaty taste to it. And I sub the water with milk (cause I'm not a vegan :))  A great qucik fix for anyone craving for chocolate. Will make these again! Thanks for the recipe.

I made cupcakes with this recipe for my daughter's first birthday and they were great. The vegans loved them but any non-vegan would not know there are animal products missing. Save a cow - try these!

I can't emphasize how good this is.  The only change I made was that I used coffee instead of water.  I bake a lot and was scared when I was told I needed to bring something vegan to a party.  I would make this cake for anyone.  I looked online for a vegan buttercream frosting.  Essentially, it used vegan margarine (I used GoodEarth), chocolate, soy milk and sugar, and again, it was so good.  This was probably more impressive given the tofu products--there was no tofu taste at all--just an excellent chocolate buttercream.  I'll search for it again to share....

As far as the recipe itself goes, I tried it and it turned out nicely, though I replaced 1/2 C. water with 1/2 C. Vanilla Soymilk.  :)

I double this recipe to use in a bundt pan and then make a simple glaze from powdered sugar and orange juice.  It's become my favorite cake to take to big family get-togethers.

Thank you so much for posting this receipe! It is really difficult to find great vegan receipes that are as delicious as the "real" thing. This one is even better! My husband is allergic to dairy products and hasn't had a chocolate cake for years. He was so excited when I surprised him with this cake. It was absolutely delicious!! Thank you!

Delicious, moist, and so quick and easy to make! I doubled the amount of cocoa for a rich, dark chocolate flavor and it turned out perfect. My husband had no idea it was vegan and loved every bite. I did top it with a simple chocolate glaze I made from sugar, soy milk, margarine, cocoa, and vanilla, but next time for a lighter-tasting option I want to try topping it with fresh berries and whipped cream. My mom has made this cake and topped it with a fruit glaze made by reducing raspberry preserves with fruit juice and it's delicious that way as well. Lots of possibilities! Also, I live at high altitude (6000+ ft) and didn't have to adjust the recipe at all.

Tasty and moist.  I reduced the sugar by 25 percent, added instant coffee granules and chocolate extract, and used boiling water.  They came out great.

Deliciousssssss. Did not give it less than 5 stars, even with the few little changes.  Used canola instead of vegetable oil (healthier) and added a dash of cayenne. I think next time, I will add a banana or possibly another sweet fruit. Cooked for 35 min only. Was well cooked
Thanks for the wonderful recipe expecially since I am so restricted as far as ingrediences are concerned.

This recipe is so great that I made it twice in a 3-day period after finding it. The first time, I substituted coffee for the water and followed the rest of the recipe. The second time, I used half brown sugar, added an extra tsp vanilla, and substituted vanilla soy for the water. I added the vinegar to the soy milk first to make a sort of soy-buttermilk. I also added 2 tsp powdered espresso. Finally, I used olive oil because it was all I had on hand. I preferred the recipe with alterations better, but the basic recipe was still 5-stars. I think it would be even better using vegan margarine in place of the oil!

Loved it!  I was looking for a low-cholesterol dessert recipe and this was perfect.  I turned it into cupcakes and baked them for about 15 minutes.  Add some vanilla cream cheese frosting, and they're good to go!

This came out fantastic!  I used it for my son's first birthday, and my chocolate-cake loving husband said it was the best cake he's had.  I've made cupcakes, too, and everyone raves about them, vegans & non-vegans alike.  I used Hershey's special dark cocoa for the cake & the frosting and it makes it come out so rich and yummy (used the Hershey's recipe for frosting, with vegan margarine).

Very nice - light for a cake, but definitely moist.  There's a nice cruncy outside to it. I would make it again, but as a low fat cake alternative  (great recipe for non-vegan's if you don't have any eggs or butter).

I have made this cake for 2 or three years now for my sons birthday.  He has a lot of friends that are vegatarian or vegan, plus my little brother is vegan.. This will be made every year as long as he lets me.:)  He's only 5 now!  So many more years:)  I also used the vegan buttercream, and ordered a edible icing for ebay with the satr wars theme, it was a big hit!

excellent recipe. My 11 year old said he prefers this cake to regular cake. I made this recipe for a work event as well as a regular chocolate cake, and the vegan cake was gone first! One recommendation I would make is to use agave syrup instead of sugar in both the cake and any frosting. Substitute 3/4 cup agave syrup = 1 cup sugar. Reduce other liquid by 1/4 cup.

My son has a dairy and egg allergy and this is the first cake I have found that doesn't use egg replacers. ( I don't like the after taste of it!) I added a tsp of baking powder the 2nd batch I made and they came out a bit fluffier. I also substituted 1/2 the white sugar for 1/2 brown sugar and the taste of my second batch was much better.

What a great recipe! Beats all cakes in my opinion, vegan or non-vegan. I doubled the recipe to make two 8x8 cakes. I also used applesauce instead of oil, added a smidge more cocoa powder and cut down on the sugar a bit. The result is a wonderfully tasty, slightly dense, very moist chocolate cake that is sure to impress!  I will definitely make this recipe again. Yum!

EXCELLENT! I made this twice before reviewing and the second time was better than the first because I did 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of oil and one cup of soy milk. Otherwise the vinegar is pointless.

Fantastic recipe!  Moist and rich, it rose really well.  I could'nt taste the vinegar at all(unlike some other vegan recipes).  I don't recommend using a bundt or tube pan like i did, though.  It just wouldn't come out in one peice.  Next time i'll use a regular cake pan.  Thanks for this recipe! *Update*  I've made this many times now for vegans and non-vegans alike, it is by far the best chocolate cake recipe i've found yet, vegan or not!

This is the first vegan cake I've made, and I couldn't even tell that it lacked milk or eggs! My roommates couldn't believe a vegan cake could taste so good and commented that it had a distinct (but not bad) taste. Perhaps it was because I used half whole wheat flour. I will definietly make this again except that next time I will grease and flour the pan instead of using nonstick cooking spray as the cake stuck to the pan a little bit.

I baked this as cupcakes for the people I work with.  One of my coworkers has just become vegan and he appreciated the sentiment.  They were a hit with most, others were a little less enthusiastic.  They weren't sweet enough for my tastes and they had an odd smell to them that no one but me seemed to notice (I think it was the vingear.)  But as opposed to other reviews, mine came out light and fluffy, though the tops of the cupcakes had a bit of a crispy crunch to them.  All in all, I'll stick to my regular chocolate cake for those who are non-vegan.  But for my few vegan friends this is a deffinite keeper.

This cake is great! I am vegetarian and my boyfriend's sis is vegan. I made this cake for a gathering of mostly non veg people and they all loved it. I added seedless raspberry jam though (about 1/3 cup) and it gave it amazing flavor and made it VERY moist. I have also taken out the cocoa and subbed pumpkin pie spices (I didn't measure, I just kept tasting until it seemed right - maybe a couple/few tablespoons) and then added about 1/2 cup of pureed pumpkin. With vegan cream cheese frosting - this was a hit and was requested for Thanksgiving!

I thought this was a delicious cake and worth making again. I'm 16 years old, cooking for myself (a vegetarian), a vegan brother, and other meat-eaters in the house. Everyone thought the cake was great. The only change I used was substituting Cake Flour for regular, all-purpose flour.  I also put on a little vegan chocolate icing and that made a sweet addition.  The cake was very moist, though I agree with other commentary that the chocolate flavor wasn't strong.  This is (as others have said) a GREAT base and can be used creatively for whatever concoctions one might bake!

The cake itself is great and very tasty but...it sticks to the pan.  I baked it twice in different baking pans with the same results.  I added chocolate chips.  Could that have been the cause?

Wonderful fabulous recipe! I made it to the letter, and it turned out wonderfully. I made a glaze with icing sugar, almond extract and water, and it was delicious! I had 2 people ask me for the recipe! Not too heavy, not too light, I made it it a ribbed tube pan, and we each had 2 pieces! I'm trying the recipe again right now and leaving out the cocoa, and adding some lemon extract. We'll see how it turns out!

Quick, easy and really good!  I still can't believe this is vegan - I'm rating it on a bell curve against other vegan cakes I've tried... otherwise it might have gotten a 4.  My brother and his girlfriend are both vegan and they both get this cake (iced with a veganized version of this fluffy, bakery-like icing: http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/WhippedFrosting.asp) on their birthdays - they love it!  Even more extraordinarily everyone else loves it too.  Thanks Sue for the very good recipe!

Not half bad!  It smelled a little weird while it was baking, but it didn't taste at all strange or vegan when it was done.  In fact, it was a very plain, regular chocolate cake.  Maybe next time I'll add vanilla to it and some chocolate chips.  :)

Stellar cake! Had to use raw, organic sugar to make sure it hadn't undergone the bone char method to ensure it remained vegan-friendly and used organic balsamic vinegar in place of the distilled white.  Added double the cocoa as I'm a chocolate fiend and just a touch of cayenne.  Baked in a 9 inch round for 35 minutes.  Perfect and lovely.  All the omnivores thoroughly enjoyed it even after it was revealed to be a vegan recipe.  Very easy and quick to make which puts this recipe on the top list of baking recipes when I'm in a pinch.  Made the vegan "butter cream" for this but icing/frosting of any type really isn't necessary at all.  Wonderful flavor on its own. Thank you so much for sharing this!

This is A 0 Cholesterol dessert! I used coconut oil for the oil and made a frosting with coconut oil and almond milk and Powdered sugar. I love this cake more than most choc cakes. I did up the cocoa to a half cup and added an extra tablespoon water. Yum it is soo good.

This is indeed a great recipe.  I am not sure if I left a review previously or not, but here it is again.  One thing to note (other reviewers also made similar comments), to be truly vegan, the sugar used should not be white/refined.  For those that may not be aware, the bright white in commercial sugar is achieved by filtering granules through animal bones (at many factories); for 'ethical' vegans, this would be unacceptable.  For those who just want a dairy-less/egg-less cake, then white sugar is fine.  
I have made this cake numerous times now, and use raw cane sugar (which is slightly brown as it is unrefined) or similar sugar.  It imparts great flavor, trace minerals, etc.  I have added instant or liquid coffee to the cake and/or the icing, for an extra twist!
I use Earth Balance vegan spread (whipped or cubed form) for the icing (separate recipe).  
The cake is a little denser than what comes from a boxed cake batter, but not quite as dense as a brownie.  I use a wire whisk to blend the ingredients and I also sift (after measuring) to remove lumps.  Before pouring the batter into the baking dish, you will see bubbles forming - the reaction of the vinegar and baking soda - what makes the cake rise!   Great recipe, enjoy!

p.s. I am curious how this recipe would come out using Stevia as a sweetener!

I am a professional, old school butter baker and I certainly could not imagine baking cake without eggs.  But I needed a vegan recipe for cupcakes.  This recipe stunned me!  It was easy, inexpensive, they raised beautifully.  They tasted identical to the deliciously dark recipe on the Hershey's cocoa box.  I think I may just make this my official chocolate cake for my shop.  I did use Hershey's dark cocoa (I doubled the amount though ).  I used hot coffee instead of water. This worked.  I made a simple peanut butter icing with shortening and margarine and powdered sugar.  I drizzled them with dark chocolate and sprinkled with crushed peanuts.

Extremely easy to make and extremely tasty. I put all the dry ingredients in a bowl, made a well in the centre and poured the wet ingredients in. Was mixed in a jiff without using too many implements. I used Hershey's dark choc powder and though only a quarter of cup was used, the cake was dark and beautifully moist. It made 6 reg cupcakes and 12 mini cupcakes. Will definitely make again, especially for people with milk/egg allergies.
I also made it to fit my swear tin. For a glaze I used 1tsp coffee, 1 heaped tsp cocoa, 1 tsp and couple of drops oil, a little less than 2 tsp hot water and 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Had a slightly bitter, not overpoweringly sweet taste. Went very well.

I tried this cake because I didn't have any eggs and wanted something chocolaty and sweet.  I substituted the vegetable oil with mashed banana to make the recipe healthier and baked it as described in a loaf pan.  This turned out great!  A nice chocolaty banana bread.  Adding chocolate or peanut butter chips or nuts would make it even better.  I definitely recommend trying this recipe for a simple healthy treat.

We have several food sensitivities in our family so we have to stay away from conveniently packaged processed sweets. This cake is my family's number #1 requested treat. It works well with gluten-free flour. I add 1 tsp. of xanthum gum when working with gluten-free flour. I also add 1-2 tbsp. almond butter to make this cake more moist. Our favorite!

This cake is so amazing: light, fluffy and moist. I made it as cupcakes thinking, "I'll just make mini cakes so I'll have little bite-size servings." Well, I guess that only works if you don't pop three in your mouth in a row :) Oh well. If you do opt for cupcakes, I'd recommend greasing well and flouring, or using cupcake wrappers. Mine did stick to the pan and were difficult to get out, but they still baked well and didn't burn.

Will definitely make this again. I'd like to find a way to make it more chocolaty for when I really need a "fix."

I adore this recipe!!! 
I have made it scads of time as is in cup cake or layer cake formats.
with raspberry vinegar in place of white...and recently started playing with it by removing the cocoa and adding more flour for a vanilla cake (which worked) so will try a spice cake, or maybe even a carrot cake next...
but this December I tried two different uses for the chocolate cake, i made a yule log by making a very thin cake in a sheet pan lined with parchment (worked well) 
AND I made RUM BALLS!!!!!!!!! worked better than i expected...mashed up a baked cake in my mixer added just enough rum to form into balls and rolled in sugar crystals...so folks if you love run balls but have dietary restrictions, this works!

i made 12 cupcakes that turned out perfect! at the suggestion of others i did make i few changes. changes: i sifted the flour first (something my mother taught me when baking from scratch) before combining the other ingredients and it turned out GREAT not dense at all; nice fluffy and moist, 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder, used 1c of dark chocolate cocoa powder and apple cider vinegar instead of white. i forgot to add the cayenne pepper, but next time cause there will be a next time i won't forget. also think next time i'm going to use brown rice flour and olive oil. i didn't want to use the good stuff and end up not liking the cake. this cake gets five stars and two thumbs up from me. i didn't have time but i'm also going to try my hand at the icing recipes a few people posted tonight. this cake does not need the icing but if you like icing why not.

Made this as a dessert for a vegan friend I was hosting.  This cake was delicious.  I used a reviewer's suggestion of replacing applesauce (cinnamon flavored) for oil, adding cayenne pepper, part whole wheat flour and balsamic vinegar.  The cake was not as moist (will play with portions for applesauce, water, etc.)  and had more of a bread consistency.  Served with fresh fruit (for the vegan) and whip cream.  Next day had a slice as a snack with peanut butter and Nutella.  Very good.  Will make again and play more with the cayenne pepper.

These cupcakes are amazing! extremely moist and light. Adding a bit of coffee makes a WORLD of difference and enhances the chocolate flavor to perfection! I'm making these for my sister's wedding and I'm sure they'll be a hit!

This was so simple to make and very delicious! I'll make it again, even for my non-vegan friends. I used the Vegan Friendly Caramel Buttercream icing recipe, which was fantastic. Chopped pecans on top made it pretty, too!

Followed the recipe exactly, very easy to make. The cake got rave reviews from family and friends! Light and moist. I've made it a few times. Once topped with a chocolate-orange glaze and other times I've simply dusted it with confectioners sugar.

I have to admit I didn't have high hopes for this recipe. I followed but per other reviewers I doubled the cocoa powder and used 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar and I accidentally left out the salt. The recipe made 15 very pretty cupcakes. The tops are very smooth and round. I planning on just scooping out a tiny bit out of the middle and putting in some homemade raspberry jam instead of frosting to save time. I probably will make this again.

I just made 1 serving of this to test it. I recently started eating vegan and my mom was disappointed that I wouldn't be eating a nasty artificial boxed cake mix at Mother's Day, so I wanted to find a recipe so good that she would have to overlook its vegan-ness. Found it right here; deliciously moist and incredibly flavorful. Would never know it was vegan if I hadn't made it myself. I used whole wheat flour to make it healthier and brown sugar because I had no white, and I doubled the cocoa powder because I like my chocolate really intense. The results were nothing short of perfection. All I need to do now is find the right icing recipe. Can't wait to make this cake for my family on Mother's Day!

WOW! I have never baked anything vegan before. I am a new vegetarian and have been dabbling in vegan options. I love to bake with "traditional" ingredients and was not sure how this recipe would turn out. I was pleasantly surprised. I did add about 1/3 cup of miniature chocolate chips (not vegan, but I'm trying to work through what I've left in my cabinet). These were good right out of the oven, but as previous reviewers stated they really were better the next day! I can't wait to make these again. Delicious!

Took another person's advise and used balsamic vinegar.  Baked in extra-large muffin tin for 25 minutes.  It looks great (perfect cake fluff), but it's really super bland.  Peanut butter icing helps the blandness somewhat, but it needs a lot more help than just icing.  I like the attempt (yay vegan!), but I won't make this recipe again.  Sorry.

Easy and delicious!  Recipe needs to be doubled to make 12 cupcakes.  I will try to make it with raw sugar or honey rather than white sugar next time to make it "truly vegan".  Replaced white flour with whole wheat flour and white vinegar with balsamic vinegar.

I needed to make a cake for a small gathering, but I wanted to use ingredients I already had.  Plus, I didn't want a large cake because I didn't want leftovers.  This was the PERFECT cake for what I was looking for.  The ingredients are staples, it's simple to make and I baked it in an 8x8 pan.  I added chocolate chips, but you really don't need to.  The cake (which I  made the night before I served it) was very moist.  I frosted it with 1/2 frosting recipe from the Hershey's Cocoa box.  Everyone loved it!  No leftovers at all.  I'll make this anytime I need a small cake.

I have always had trouble with simple vegan cupcakes. I used this recipe and they are so delicious!! I added 1/4t more baking soda and vinegar after reading other reviews and they rose wonderfully. I also used 3/4c of agave nectar instead of sugar. This will be my go to recipe for chocolate cake or cupcakes. I made 15 smaller sized cupcakes. I could have made 12 big ones. I baked for 21 minutes.

Not a bad cupcake, but was not my or my husband's favorite. I will admit that we are very picky about sweets. We felt the oil gave it a funny aftertaste. It  was a little crumbly and my husband thought it lacked chocolate/sweetness. If you use a good frosting, it makes it much better.

I was really skeptical about this cake, because even pre-vegan, I had difficulty finding decent homemade cake recipes.  They would always be dense or flat or something taste funky in some way.  When I was "testing" this recipe, I told _everyone_ it was vegan (assuming there would be some bias against it) and thus getting more "honest" feedback.  Even so, everyone thought it was delicious (of course, who can say no to a cupcake?).  I even got some secret delight in seeing some non-vegan friends who honestly expected to taste cardboard (at best) actually light up with the pleasant surprise at its numminess factor.  This is a truly wonderful recipe that makes me feel like I'm not missing out on my fav pre-vegan foods and also serves as a terrific ambassador and advocate for veganism at non-vegan celebrations. Hooray for delicious and cruelty-free chocolate cupcakes!!!

-great recipe for cocoa! I doubled it, used coffee for half the water req., and used light brown sugar for half the sugar req.  Cooked in 2 bundts, one for a neighbor.  Very easy and chocolatey.

From all of the rave reviews I expected some darned good chocolate cake.  What I got was a chocolatey-cake like thing. I'm wondering if revamping it a bit - adding chocolate soy milk instead of water, a very dark cocoa powder, and some vegan chocolate chips might add some depth.  So far, not overly impressed.

Makes a great cupcake, although I made a lot of mods before ever trying the original recipe.
Used all Spelt Flour, Brown Sugar, Balsamic vinegar, half coconut oil/half applesauce instead of veg oil and Coconut milk instead of water. Really good with cream cheese frosting! (Although not so vegan anymore!)

We loved this cake!! I made the suggestions that other reviewers suggested- 9" Cake Pan - 35 minutes and 1/2 Cup Cocoa Powder. I also made a few other adjustments. I added semi-sweet chocolate chips (mini) - I only had a handful in my pantry, but they really added to the texture and flavor. I also made another nonvegan addtion - I frosted the cake with the sprinkles frosting recipe (you could use a vegan butter)- It was awesome!

These cupcakes turned out perfectly. They are moist and delicious and turned out better than any non-vegan cupcakes I've ever made. The only issue is you have to wait for these to cool completely before tasting them. While they are still warm they are rather dense and gummy. Shame on me for not being able to wait!

I made this recipe last year for my son's birthday because he's allergic to milk and eggs and it was a hit! It's extremely moist and yummy! I will be making again tonight for his 2nd birthday and I'm sure many more birthdays to come!

I made this cake using 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, and I also added about a cup of melted unsweetened chocolate with a few TBS of sugar, which made my batter really thick. I cooked the cake in a 9" round pan, and it came out moist with excellent chocolate flavor. I dusted it with powdered sugar instead of frosting. I would never guess this is a vegan cake!

This cake was really delicious. I couldn't even tell it was vegan (I made it as a birthday cake for a vegan coworker) and I think this is one recipe that I will be making as it's just as good, if not better, than a "regular" chocolate cake.

Wonderful cake! I made two of these in a 9 inch circular pan and reduced the baking time due to the different size and shape pan. Used mostly apple sauce in place of oil with just a small splash of olive oil (didn't have vegetable oil on hand). Tastes wonderful and holds together beautifully. Not crumbly, wonderful flavor, and moist. I followed the advise of someone here, making the complete cake a day before serving and refrigerating it overnight to let the flavors settle. Highly recommended cake, thank you for the recipe! PS: For those worried that white sugar is not vegan, there are white sugars made specifically for vegans. More expensive but animal friendly! :)

This is so good!   I altered it a bit and added 1/4 cup extra cocoa powder and vegan, soy-free chocolate chips by Enjoy Life.  They were really chocolately and perfectly sweet and did not break apart. I dont usually use white sugar, but for a special occasion, I wouldnt swap it with agave or brown rice syrup as it was just too perfect w/the reg. sugar!~

this was awesome.  i made these as cupcakes for a vegan friend of mine and he loved them (and so did my non-vegan roommate!).  i baked these as 12 large cupcakes at 350 for 20 minutes but i think i could have even baked them for a couple minutes less.  i iced them with vegan buttercream and they were very tasty!

Perfect! I am not a vegan and these do not taste vegan. I added a little extra: cocoa, baking soda and vinegar (as suggested as others) also added chocolate chips for an extra yum factor. I made vegan because I was worried because my daughter loves the batter and it's not safe to eat raw eggs. This recipe was perfect in all it's forms, I even ate the batter.

This is the most moist vegan chocolate cake I have ever had.  I loved it.  However, the next time, I will add some chocolate chips or a little extra sugar to make it a bit sweeter.  I am not a fan of icing so I like my cake a bit sweeter.  But as a whole this is a wonderful, healthy cake and I cannot believe it isn't made with eggs and butter.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you so much.

This cake is delicious, especially for a vegan recipe.  It gets five stars because it is very good and vegan.  There are other cake recipes I like better, but they are not vegan. The second time I made this recipe I added an extra 1/4 cup cocoa, about 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  We like this much better.

Wow what a good cake! I made it into cupcakes, and it gave me 12 medium sized cupcakes. Frosted with caramel frosting from this site that I had leftover from another recipe. They were sooo easy to make. I wanted to make a dessert without using up my eggs, I needed them for tomorrow hehe. The kids and I loved them! Delicious. You could never tell that they were vegan! Thanks a lot for this awesome recipe, I love it!

Better than expected.  I was really stuck for a recipe, since I was out of eggs, but I thought I'd give this a try and it's much better than I'd dare hope.  And that should mean something, since I don't even like cake...

I was looking for a recipe for my daughter who is allergic to eggs and dairy.  She never had cake at family gatherings, and I felt horrible!  This cake fits the bill for those in need of a cake with out allergens.  To those who are gluten sesitive, I'm sure you could try the gluten -free cake flour.  Over all this is a  keeper!  I also agree with those that posted the cake really is better the second day. Also I made this a lemon Cake by omitting the cocoa powder, and using vanilla, and lemon zest and the juice of one lemon, I used a powder sugar and lemon juice glaze for the frosting, it was yummy !

Followed the recipe except increased cocoa to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup seedless raspberry preserves.  Baked for 45 min in a Bundt pan.  Cake may have overbaked as it was somewhat dry.  You would never guess it was vegan---actually tastes like it came from a box.  Made this for my son who's allergic to eggs/dairy/wheat for his 1st Bday cake---will try again with some other users tips (applesauce, add soy milk, etc to get more moist).  Frosted w/ Funfetti vanilla icing (Pillsbury) b/c no vegan icings at my store--best they had w/o dairy.

WOW!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I added some vegan chocolate chips to the mix and it was wonderful.  I have used almond milk and cold coffee in place of the water and loved it both ways.  I live at 7000 feet elevation and this cake did not even fall in the middle (as many do), partly because I used my "NO FALL" trick: turn off the oven a few minutes before the cake is done baking, then leave the cake inside with the oven door cracked for 30 minutes or so.  This helps ease the cake into the world without getting a shock from the room temperature air and collapsing. 
Also, in response to the comment that using white sugar is not vegan...I always use turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw) instead of white sugar, and I find that it turns out great.  Turbinado is never filtered through bone meal, so it is always vegan.

Divine. The only thing I changed was to use a 1/2 cup of the cocoa powder, and I also dissolved a teaspoon of instant coffee into the water (to intensify the chocolate flavor). Wonderful cake recipe, will be making this again!

Gluten-free variation!

I substituted ALL of the flour for (1.5 cups) brown rice flour, and the water for (1 cup) rice milk. I also added a half a bag of chocolate chips.

I didn't use any frosting, but sprinkled the tops with powdered sugar.

I make 12 cupcakes and a tiny cornbread pan. The cupcakes took 25 minutes at 300 degrees, and the small pan took about 10 more minutes. 

This recipe is amazing! I have to eat virtually dairy free, and I was recently told by my doctor to start cutting wheat. I had written off chocolate cake altogether, but this is fantastic! 

The brown rice flour adds a hint of grittiness and nuttiness, but it's not overwhelming or bad at all. I chose that flour for it's dry and crumbly properties since I heard the cake was so moist. It worked perfect!

I am not vegan, but had a craving for chocolate and no dairy products in my fridge. I will not make a different chocolate cake again. Loved it!

Delicious! We aren't actually vegan but looking for a baby friendly (egg and dairy free) cake for my daughter's first birthday. This is definitely the one. It's perfect! I used 1/2 cup cocoa instead of 1/4 cup and added a splash more water as it got a little stiff. I also used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of Vegetable because that is all we keep in our house. Once again, delicious! Thanks!! Now I need a Vegan White Cake Recipe ... hmmm ...

It was very dry. If I were to make this again, I'll either add more water or add a little applesauce to make it more moist.

This cake is incredibly tasty and moist. I love to bake and try to find heart healthy dessert options that aren't full of butter and eggs. The recipe can be mixed entirely in the pan if you aren't concerned about it sticking. Lovely as cupcakes as well. I'm excited about trying the banana version mentioned in the reviews. My friends compared it to volcano cake and raved about the flavor. No one cared  that it's vegan.

this recipe worked fantastically.  I even misread the temperature for the first forty minutes as being 125 and then boosted up the heat for another 15-20 min.  the cake was moist and quite chocolatey.  in fairness, i did add some cinamon, was scant with the oil and only roughly measured the rest.  Also used self-rising flour and unrefined sugar.  VERY rich though; best with some fresh strawberries to cut it.

Leave this to sit overnight and it tastes even better the next day!! An addition of 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon makes this especially delicious.

After reading the comments, I bumped the cocoa to 1/2 cup and I used soy milk instead of water. I also used some splenda in place of sugar. More like brownies than cake, but I love it!

Neither my fiance nor I are vegan, but I made this cake as cupcakes (it made an even dozen for me) for a friend's vegan sister. My fiance looooved this cake! The texture was dense, moist and chewy. Everyone that tried it, liked it. My only suggestion would be to increase the amount of cocoa powder, because I thought it wasn't quite chocolatey enough for me. Other than that, it was a very good recipe for vegans and non-vegans alike!

Awesome recipe and great tasting cake. Cake requested by a co-worker's son allergic to eggs. I tripled  the recipe twice and baked it in a 2- 3" 9 X 3 sheet pan for 55 minutes. Like what other testers claimed, "It is a lot better than ordinary chocolate cakes."  Used Trader's Joes organic cocoa powder and  Nothing else was changed, substituted or added. Cake is moist ,  quite addicting. This is a keeper.Thanks for this worderful great tasting recipe!!!!!

Although quite dense, this is a very good - eggless/dariyless - recipe for chocolate cake. I added 3 tbsp. + 1 tsp. of dark, brewed espresso coffee and reduced water content by 3 tbsp. (still equals 1 c. of total liquid). I also added about 3 tbsp. of course chopped almonds. I recommend this recipe and will certainly make it again. Enjoy with a big glass of soy milk!

Yum!!! I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce, the sugar with splenda and white flour with whole-wheat. Soooooooo good! Even my brother liked it, and he runs away from any of my "yukky vegan food".

This recipe is a good vegan alternative, and a good base for other cakes. I found it quite dry, and have since formulated my own recipe for a moister, more chocolatey vegan chocolate cake, but my vegan friend loves this recipe all the same. I think it might work better if an egg subsitute was added, or real chocolate was used instead of cocoa powder.

This cake was Amazing, I made it for my son 7 yrs old birthday with a chocolate Vegan icing. It was so good and it was gone so fast. Note: I added Balsamic vinegar and it did makes a difference in flavor, much better than the regular one, rich in flavor. I also added 1/2 cup of flour additional to the recipe and a bit more coconut oil 1/4 cup, and half tbsp of baking soda. It came super moisture. I added dark chocolate chips as well.

I've made this recipe literally hundreds of times in the years since I've found it. If you make it as is with fresh ingredients, then you end up with a light, fluffy chocolately cake/cupcake that people truly won't tell if it's vegan or not.  I do reduce the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup, just as a personal preference. I also decrease the water a bit and add an equal amount of strong coffee to bring out the chocolate flavor. I bake it as cupcakes for ~18-20mins, 6" cakes or 8" cakes. NEVER in a loaf pan.

Such a delicious outcome for such a quick and easy  recipe! I added an extra quarter cup of cocoa powder, and used 2tsp of some raspberry balsamic vinegar I had in the cabinet instead of the white vinegar. It came out amazing and my vegan sister was so happy!! You can frost this with anything and it’ll be great.

I've made this recipe about 6 times now, both for vegans and non-vegans and everyone has loved it! (Of course the non-vegans couldn't believe it was vegan!) It's a total cinch to bake and the ingredients are all things you've already got. As someone who hardly ever cooks and prefers easy baking recipes, this recipe is perfect for me!

One essential change is to add two "eggs" for moistness: 2/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce. (The cake is just a tad dry without it.)

One non-essential change is to add 1/3 cup of chocolate chips (vegan-safe ones, of course). Adds a nice little something extra to the whole thing!

My best friend is vegan and I made this for her son's birthday. 
 This cake is absolutely  D-VINE!!!  I paired this with the  "Strawberry Cake Filling" by Lisa on the Allrecipes site and I made the Hershey's chocolate frosting recipe on the back of the container.  To make the frosting vegan, I used Earth Balance original  spread instead of butter and almond milk instead of regular milk.  This recipe is a keeper, and I'm not even vegan!

This turned out super delicious and moist, perfect recipe! I did double the amount of cocoa powder called for because I wanted a really chocolatey taste. Otherwise I made it as written, and made it in the loaf pan, then sliced it like a quick-bread. I will definitely make this recipe again!

I have used this recipe for years- it is an old depression era recipe and everyone loves it. I have even used it to make a 3-d pirate ship for my dairy allergic son. So quick and edgy to whip up a batch as cupcakes too!

This cake is absolutely delicious! I made cupcakes and simply dusted them with powdered sugar - no frosting needed. I am not vegan, but was looking for a recipe without eggs or milk (I typically only use them for baking and end up wasting what I don't use). I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I'm excited to make them for the girls at work who actually are vegan!

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe ever! I almost always make these to take to birthday parties. I always make them the night before I plan to eat them. They are good on the day you bake them, but they are perfect the day after. They get so moist and delicious!

Found receipe for forks over knives diet. Replaced oil with FF yogurt, used  WW flour, cut sugar to 3/4 c. ( raw instead of white), increased cocoa to 1/2 c. and added about 1/4 c almond milk. Great sweet taste, could try even more almond milk and less sugar. Topped with sliced strawberries.

I love this recipe. My sister made it for a potluck and I snuck a few. Delish! Now I made my own and turned it into cupcakes. I made a sweet vegan icing with powdered sugar, orange juice, and cocoa powder. To. Die. For. Not too dense or sweet either like a lot of vegan cakes.

This vegan cake was very good. Although it was slightly on the fudge-y side, everyone enjoyed it. We cut the sugar in half, it was fine. The only problem was that the cake was not very chocolate-y. We would've added at least another tbs. of coco powder.

Good old 'Wacky Cake'! This is the recipe my mom used all through my childhood, and now I make it for every birthday. Fool-proof recipe, and no worries about letting little monkeys lick the bowl and spoon. I generally cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup.

YUMMY! This cake came out tasty and moist. I am new to this vegan way of eating. I decided to take the plunge and bake this cake for my sons First Birthday Party. I was nervous how it would turn out without a trial run but I followed the reviews and changed a few things and came out wonderfully! Everyone loved it!

Here's what I did differently;

- I doubled the recipe to make 2 9" rounds for a two layer cake. 
- I used organic cane sugar instead of white sugar
- I added a few pinches of brown sugar
- I used Balsamic Vinegar instead of white vinegar
- I used half veg. oil & half Olive oil
- I added a teaspoon of cinnamon
- I doubled the amount of cocoa powder
- I added a small handful of vegan chocolate chips
- Lastly, I only cooked for about 30 minutes (35 minutes the second time)
I, originally, was going to use vegan chocolate frosting. But it came out pretty chocolaty and sweet. I thought that it would be 'too much' chocolate.  So I decided on a vegan buttercream frosting. I topped with raspberries and it came out perfectly! This time I just baked another one and experimented with a little less sugar, a little less cocoa and a 1.5 cups of water and a half a cup of brewed coffee to make up for the liquid (again this is all doubled for two cakes). We will see how it turns out..I might even do raspberry preserves in the middle.

I made an ORANGE CAKE instead of chocolate and it was wonderful.  I substituted half the water for orange juice.  I took out the cocoa powder and added orange rind.  The result was a delicious!  Moist, not to sweet and perfectly dense.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Also just tried making the chocolate version.  Used coconut oil and balsamic as suggested by someone else.  Delicious!

Fantastic!
I made this recipe as cupcakes for my sister's birthday party for her vegan husband.  I had baked a regular birthday cake for my sister but I wanted my brother in law to have something sweet to finish off the meal, too.
Well, they were a huge hit!  I did change the recipe a bit:
I increased it to 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, added 2 teaspoons of vanilla not just 1 and substituted balsamic vinegar for the white vinegar and it was delicious!  After they cooled, I just dusted the top with a bit of powdered sugar and my brother in law loved it.
He said that usually vegan baked goods leave a lot to be desired but he said these were "fantastic."  Even the meat- and dairy-eaters among loved them.
I made them again for a dinner party we're having tonight and they are just as tasty as they were the first time.  thanks for the great recipe!

Tough and dry. I followed the recipe to the letter.... no substitutions or free-spirit alterations. Saved only by the frosting.

This one is an old favorite of mine. Mom's recipe is about 65 years old. Had to rewrite it several times to preserve her book. She made it in a square pan shifted dry ingredients into pan dug 3 wells one for vanilla, one for vinegar and one for oil. Poured water over it and mixed well. Mom has her own butter cream frosting made with stale coffee as its liquid. If we were exceptionally good she would use the leftover icing for gram crackers and freezes them for a treat. No store bought cookies for us. Glad to see the"old favorites" are around for the younger generation to enjoy.

My son is Vegan and we bake this cake frequently. I use cold coffee instead of water. Really brings out the chocolate flavor, but not enough to create a mocha flavor.

This recipe is called crazy cake. It's been around since the depression. You can also omit the cocoa add orange zest and replace the water with orange juice to make an orange flavored cake.

I used spelt instead of cake flour. It was the only one i had in the cupboard. It took a little less to bake, but very moist and fluffy. We'll try it again with buckwheat and let you know!

I made this cake for a group of people at work that all have different dietary issues.  I figured this cake would fit everyone, and it did!  It turned out moist and delish!  I used Canola oil because that is all I ever use, and I used apple cider vinegar because that's what I had.  I was so nervous because the batter did not taste well at all, but after it baked it was super!  :)

This cake was fantastic!  I made several substitutions due to my naked pantry and it still turned out great and was even better the next day.  I used the following alternatives wholewheat flour, brown sugar, olive oil, red wine vinegar.  I did sift out the larger wheat hulls in the flour.  I also increased the cocoa to 1/2 c. as per another review.  I like to use parchment paper on the bottom of my baking dishes instead of greasing them to reduce clean-up.  Baking only took me 35min. in a glass dish.  I didn't hold out much hope for it turning out but it was chocolatey and moist just as described. No icing necessary.  I was tempted to concoct an avocado chocolate icing but my husband did not support my innovative spirit.  Next time!

Good, but I felt it was lacking something. Just didn't have that intense chocolate flavor I was looking for. My kids liked it, but did say it didn't taste like chocolate cake. Maybe more cocoa or some melted butter instead of oil?

Very delicious, easy recipe. I came across this recipe when I was looking for a recipe without baking powder (since I was out). I made it into cupcakes and cooked for 20 minutes; they came out perfectly! I topped with peanut butter frosting.

I made this recipe and it was enjoyed by vegans and non-vegans alike!  I doubled the cocoa powder as suggested in the other reviews.  I also noticed it rose very unevenly so next time I'll remember to turn it part way through baking.

This is the easiest and the most tasty chocolate cake I have ever made! Try it with lemon frosting. It balances each other out.

i made this also gluten free.  replaced the sugar with agave nectar, the flour for gluten free flours, and added apple sauce and very little oil.  also doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13" pan.  Greased and floured the pan (gluten free flour of course!) and it came out of the pan beautifully and was easy to decorate and everyone LOVED it more then other cakes i've made! fantastic cake! will be making a lot more! also did a vegan frosting :)

I think this recipe is an excellent basis for a modified recipe, but alone, I didn't like this at all. I'm a baker, recently vegan, and this cake was not sweet enough. Also, it smelled like fish. I went in with an open mind, but non-vegans won't like this at all. I'm planning on doubling the sugar next go around to see if it improves, but if not, I'll be looking for another cake recipe.

These were great and really easy. 
I did substitute carob because my mother is not supposed to have chocolate (I just melted the chips in the liquid, cooled it add added it in the end.) 
My family raved over them. It makes exactly 8 cupcakes

Wonderful recipe! The ingredients are so simple but it tastes so good! I found everything in my pantry already, instead of having to buy almond milk and other vegan ingredients.

Today is the first time I made a vegan cake. This recipe came out absolutely delicious. Very moist and great texture. 

I followed the advice of another poster who suggested using balsamic vinegar. I only had raspberry balsamic around so I used a tablespoon of that. While the cake was baking, my home had a slight, but wonderful smell of raspberry mixed with the chocolate. Wonderful advice to use balsamic. I also added chocolate chips and just under 1/2 cup of honey because I don't like my cakes very sweet. Thanks for the great recipe.

I was so skeptical in baking because I know I really don't have such a talent. I finally got some confidence and baked this for new year. The sample was a hit and no doubt the final cupcake was gone in a minute. Best recipe ever!

I've tried several highly rated chocolate cake recipes before, and with varying success. Most were too dense or not chocolatey enough. This recipe is so simple, and tastes amazing! The first batch I made was cupcakes which I mistakenly took out out of the oven too soon and so they caved in when removed. No problem though, they were gooey, chocolate goodness and could be eaten since there were no eggs! The second batch was for a birthday cake and was perfect! This is my go to recipe for chocolate cake now, and I am so happy it is Vegan for all my health conscious friends!

Ecxellent recipe. I made a birthday cake for my brother's vegan feast, and it was almost unfair to receive so much praise from the guests, when the recipe is right there online for anyone to use. A very easy recipe, too! The only changes were apple cider vinegar instead of white and I doubled the amount of cocoa (which may have been even too much.) It was a layer cake with berry syrup--the dough was light and fluffy and delicious. Thank you so much!

This was really good.  I doubled the cocoa powder though.  I split the batter into two 8-inch round pans and baked it for 30 minutes.  It was perfect!  Not dry at all.

I was so pleased with this recipe! I am new to the vegan world and wanted to enjoy a cake, so I made this for my daughter's second birthday. I used basalmic vinegar cause I had it on hand. My non-vegan family couldn't even tell the difference. I also made a mint vegan icing... It was cool to see everyone's reaction

This was a delicious no egg try, but I found it to be a little dry.  I found a chocolate glaze recipe elsewhere that I added to this, which made it not so dry.  I would try this recipe again, but maybe change up the ingredients.  Make sure to thoroughly grease the pan because my first batch broke in two trying to get it out.  We ended up eating it from the pan, but perhaps I did not take it out of the pan to cool fast enough.

As others suggested, I doubled the unsweetened cocoa and I used whole wheat pastry flour.  The frosting was suggested by one of the raters; I used Earth Balance and Almond Breeze for the moist ingredients.
I took them to a dinner party and EVERYBODY raved.  Thanks for making the vegan chef a star!!

FANTASTIC and qucik!!! I used Carob Powder as I have problems with caffeine. I added 1/3 cup carob chips to batter, replaced oil with unsweetened apple sauce and 1 Tbs of canola oil, wheat flour instead of AP, 1/2 cup brown instead of white sugar as Carob is naturally sweet,  topped batter with walnuts before I put it in the oven. Baked for 33 minutes. Tasted rich, decadent and moist, the BEST carob cake I have ever tasted. Will be making this again and again..... I no longer feel deprived when I want chocolate cake. Thank you SO MUCH for posting this recipe!

I just made these and they are super easy to make.  The only change I made was to  replace the oil with applesauce.  The cupcakes also baked up with a great consistency.  However, they didn't have much flavor and they stuck to the cupcake wrappers.  I will make them again and maybe add a bit more cocoa powder and salt.  If I use the applesauce, I'll probably lightly spray the cupcake wrappers with cooking spray to prevent sticking.  I give these 5 stars for ease and how they bake up, but only a three overall.

This cake tasted good, but the texture was not good. It was crumbly and quite dry. I will not be making it again, but it was easy and quick, which was nice! But unfortunately it's not a keeper.

I made them into cupcakes and reduced the baking time. I upped the cocoa powder to 1/3 cup, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, and used half rice milk/half water. Very good! I will definitely make them again. :)

This cake is so GOOD! I made it for my father's birthday because my daughter and I are both vegan and we wanted to have cake too. Everyone else who ate it had no idea it was vegan - it was just plain delicious. I made two batches to make a 2 layer 9" cake and threw a handful of mini chocolate chips into each batch to make it extra chocolatey. I will make this one again for sure!! Oh - I also subbed applesauce for the oil and it was perfect :)

This cake is VERY moist and delicious. I ran out of eggs today so I figured I'd try baking a vegan chocolate cake since I was really craving it. I love it! I added about a 2 tablespoons more of flour because the mix looked a little watery to me, and it turned out wonderful. 5 stars!

Yummy! I made it for my mom who's vegan. Everyone raved about them! 45 minutes is too long to bake though - more like 20-30 minutes.

I'm a new vegan (was a vegetarian for years & finally took the plunge!) and had lost hope in finding a perfect substitution for my cupcake craving. THIS...did it. These cupcakes came out perfectly!!! I was a little hesitant after tasting the batter- but magic happens in the oven. Moist, chocolatey, and perfectly fluffy....I will be making these again and again! (though the originally recipe is delicious- for an extra kick, we made some with shredded unsweetened coconut and then others with a 1/4tsp of cayanne in the batter...all came out amazing!)

This is a great recipe~~I have made it several times and they turn out so tasty! Easy to make! I sometimes replace cocoa powder with green tea powder. I would add about 1 t of green tea (if you like more, add more~) and less water (about 1/2 or 1/3 of water) Yummy!!!

IMPORTANT: Let this cake sit for at least 24 hours... the venegar smell/taste fades with time, and after a day or two you're left with the most moist, melt-in-your-mouth, BEST cake you have ever had!  Don't know if this has anything to do with it, but I added a two cubes of melted unsweeted baker's chocolate to the batter because I wanted it to be more chocolaty. This cake tops all vegan and non-vegan cakes!

Great! Made w/ milk instead of water so not vegan, but could go either way.  Added ~1 tsp cinnamon and dash of cayenne for a little extra kick.  Made with simple buttercream frosting (1/2 cup butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, & 1-2 Tbsp cocoa powder).  Was just looking for an egg-free recipe and not completely vegan.

This cake was all right.  I made it into cupcakes, as pictured.  They were not as good as the reviews made them out to be, although they were not bad.  I stored them in a container, but the next day they were dry.  I would not make this recipe again because there are much better ones out there.

My family loves this cake. We are not vegan, just didnt have any eggs on hand to make a regular cake and tried this recipe instead. This is now our new favorite cake. I've make it 5 times and it always turns out perfect. Also, I would say its just as easy to make as a packaged cake mix and better for you.

We're not vegan by any means, not even vegetarian. But I am always looking for healthier alternatives to sweets for my junk food loving husband & son. I made these into cupcakes and used half WW flour. Other than that didn't change a thing. Came out delicious! A keeper for our family. Thank you!!!

I first made this about two years ago, and am not sure if I rated it then. I've used the recipe several times since then, but just made it again in cupcakes, and just HAD to sit down and review it. FABULOUS!!! Thanks, Sue, for sharing. And thanks to all the reviewers who offered tips on what brands of vegan chocolate chips are available, as well as ideas for making (or buying) vegan frosting. It's very helpful to a non-vegan like me who is just trying to accomodate the tastes of vegan friends and family.

A super quick EASY one bowl cupcake! I cut back on the sugar and use about 3/4 cup instead, but I make up for it by adding chocolate chips to the batter!

This recipe was perfect.  However, as I had only a 9 x 13 pan, I had to triple the ingredients and bake for slightly longer, but it turned out amazing.  I've got so much cake now I don't know what to do with it other than pass it around the office - it is so rich and moist and goes brilliantly with KADart05's recipe for vegan buttercream frosting!

I made this recipe for a 4th of July party. It was a big hit. I doubled the recipe and baked it in 2 round cake pans. I used someone's suggestion of putting seedless raspberry jam in between the two layers, icing, and then adding fresh raspberries to the top. The cake was not only delicious but also a great centerpiece.

I made this recipe for a vegan friend's bridal shower.  Before the shower, I did a test run and took the cake to my church youth group kids to try.  They loved it!  For the shower, I made cupcakes with  icing made from powdered sugar, margarine, and vanilla soy milk.  They were a hit.  Vegan or not, this recipe is a keeper--makes a very moist cake with a nice, chocolate flavor.

These are great! I wanted an eggless recipe I could turn into a single or double serving as a little treat for myself. I made 4 cupcakes from this recipe and they turned out perfectly. They tasted like any other chocolate cupcake. Top with rich buttercream icing and they're amazing!

awesome!!! i doubled this recipe exactly for 2 greased and floured round cake pans. then i baked at 350 for 35 mins. i froze the 2 cakes in their pans on baking sheets(uncovered) for 30 mins. then w/ a butter knife i gently cut around the edges and dumped the cakes upside down on 2 plates. i made a dairy free frosting for my version and it worked perfectly...1/2 c margarine + 2 C powdered sugar + 1 TB vanilla + 2 TB water + 1/4 C cocoa powder + dash salt.  all whipped up in my K/A . no one knew it was dairy free. much better than other ones i have used in the past

I wasn't all that impressed with this recipe.  I used a bit more cocoa than called for but otherwise followed the recipe.  It just didn't seem all that sweet or have as much of a chocolate taste as I would have liked.  I made the recipe into six giant cupcakes and frosted them.  Frosting is a must!

Fantastic. First time, I followed the recipe exactly. Second time, I used espresso instead of water, and added 1/2 cup more cocoa, and it turned into vegan mocha brownies. Again, fantastic.   I also used the vegan 'buttercream' frosting from one of the earlier reviews and it was extremely wonderful.

I was skeptical, but made these for my vegan nanny when she came over for dinner.  I was blown away by how easy this was to make and how tasty the cupcakes were. I made 12 cupcakes with this recipe and did adjust the cocoa to nearly a 1/2 cup.  I topped them with vegan orange frosting (1/2 cup all vegetable shortening, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp orange zest, 2 tsp orange flavoring, and 4 T orange juice, adjust flavoring to taste).  This is a recipe I will be using alot and experimenting with different frostings.

I chose this because of its high rating, and that it could be made gluten free. I've been cooking gluten free for awhile, but am just beginning to try my hand at gluten free baking.  : )  It went together quickly and was the first time I'd used vinegar in a cake before. It went in a 9x5 pan - so it makes like a snack cake.   The cake was great with powdered sugar on top. Yum-yum!

You should always use raw cane sugar. White sugar is stripped of everything and then processed with chemicals...Yuck!! Other than that rock on :)

Absolutely a perfect chocolate cake recipe - no changes necessary!  I generally make this into cupcakes (I take all my baking into work, cupcakes are easier!).  This is my standby chocolate cake and it's great since I always have all these ingredients on hand.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very easy to make, and delicious. It doesn't taste at all like a vegan cake, everyone loved it. Surprisingly moist, and chocolate-full, i did take the suggestion of adding 1/2 of cocoa powder rather than 1/4 of a cup to give it an extra strong chocolate taste.

I was looking for a dairy free chocolate cake since my daughter has a dairy allergy and I've had to cut out all dairy until I'm done breastfeeding her.  It's lighter than the dense chocolate cake that I'm used to, but it's a good substitute.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I made cupcakes and the recipe was able to yeild 12 with the cups being filled about 3/4 of the way.  I did as another suggested and added 1/2 cup cocoa instead of 1/4.  Besides that, the only other adjustment I made was that I mixed the dry and wet ingredients in separate bowls, then added the dry in with the wet.  Just foud it easier to mix that way.  These cupcakes came out with a perfect texture and taste.  Good for a chocolate craving!  I made them for a Vegan couple that was coming for dinner and this was a perfect dessert to serve, they loved them!  I will keep this as my chocolate cake recipe I use from now on!

I usually make this cake vanilla instead of chocolate by adding extra vanilla and cinnamon and omitting cocoa. Ripe bananas can also be added to both chocolate and vanilla versions of this cake. This is the same recipe used by 'food not bombs' in my home town, they call it anar-cake!

Fantastic ! I made a few changes according to what i had in stock : apple cider vinegar, cane sugar (3/4 cup), i used 1 cup of regular wheat flour and 1/2 of corn flour, i doubled the amount of cocoa powder and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. 40 minutes later it was cooked and turned out delicious. To decorate it i opted for a light sprinkle of icing sugar. It was also very easy to bake, so that's definitely a keeper !

This is a great recipe!  The cake turns out moist and delicious!  I made only two changes:  (1) increased the cocoa powder to 1/2 C and (2) made it in a 9" round cake pan.  It was done in 30 minutes.  I didn't have to make any adjustments for the high altitude.  One friend says this is her new favorite chocolate cake recipe....it's a keeper!

Gave this five stars for its simplicity and downright goodness! I followed the recipe exactly, but with a smidgen more cocoa, and used the excellent icing provided in KAD's review. Was eaten the next day to rave reviews, most couldn't believe it was vegan! The only thing I'll do different next time is make 2!

Just as Sue said, a simple, yet very tasty cake. I love it! I made it exactly as directed and it worked out beautifully. I frosted it with a chocolate frosting (a bit of margarine, vanilla extract, corn syrup, some cocoa, and added icing sugar till the right consistency). This will be my go-to recipe for a simple quick chocolate cake (and we're not vegan either)!

this recipe turned out great! I only gave this recipe four stars because I had to up the cocoa powder to 1/3 of a cup. I'm not vegan, so I drizzled buttercream frosting on it which made it look really nice. I baked this in a loaf pan and it only took about 40 minutes. I made this for friends when I had no eggs on hand. This is a keeper.

Made these in cupcake form. Really good, but they definitely won't trick anyone looking for a real chocolate cake fix. All my vegan and vegetarian friends loved them at a party. I'll make these again for sure.

Very nice, moist and almost melt-in-your-mouth! Right out from the oven, it was crunchy outside but soft inside (I'm not very patient, i have to sample my cake ^^), but let it cool completely and everything was even more delicious...

It definitely hits the spot when you're craving chocolate.  I made this last night...my hubby didn't care for it much, but my son and I liked it.  I didn't use wheat flour because I didn't know it called for that ?  Anyway, it was pretty good.

wow!  I am not vegan but made it for a party where only 2 people were vegan... and EVERYONE LOVED IT!    SO amazing.  They took it home and ate the rest of it throughout the next day!  (and they aren't even really "cake" people usually!)

sometimes I drip a little Amarretto onto it before I put the frosting on... MMMMM

THANKS!   I have made it 4 times... and I am going to make it today for a friend with dairy allergies.

This was really good!  Got lots of compliments from non-vegans.  The best part is that I didn't feel guilty licking the spoon since there were no raw eggs!  I made this as both cupcakes and a cake and it was delicious either way!

What an easy and wonderful cake! I have made it twice, the first time I followed the directions to a tee, except I made cupcakes (baked them for 25 mins as suggested by other members) but the second time I replaced the water with a cup of strong chai tea! Chocolate chai muffins with chocolate frosting and a dash of nutmeg on teh top. DELICIOUS!

Excellent recipe, and quite moist! I made a two-layer cake out of a double recipe and it held up nicely. The only problem I had was that it was a little underdone in the center, but maybe that's because I'm new to high-altitude baking, or I might have made each layer too thick. Still an excellent recipe...not too sweet and not too heavy.

I`m not vegeterian but I was searching for a chocolate cake without butter or much oil and I found this amazing recipe.
the most things that I lik about this recipe that it has a very affordable Ingredients, the second thing is the preparing method is very simple all u need is a spoon and a bowl...very easy, and the third thing the texture ..sooooooo moist and not oily at all.
I did`t like it when it first came out 
of the oven it had a wierd taste and smell I was very disappointed, but I waited 6 hours to try it again and it was so different so moist and tastes very well and the best thing that it`s not too sweet the sugar amount with perfect. 

thank you for this great recipe

Had to feed a huge crew, so made four double-batches in succession, which resulted in 130 cupcakes (22 minutes at 350 degrees). I added a filling of homemade vegan chocolate, hoping it be a nice surprise... but it disappeared into the cake; I have to play with that recipe. Anyway, this is a delicious, moist, very yummy cake. A big room full of long-time vegetarians - many of whom are vegan and some of whom don't even like cupcakes - raved, saying they were the best they'd ever had. Great job, Sue! :)

This recipe was fantastic.  I heeded the suggestions of others by adding 1/2c of cocoa powder, raspberry preserves mixed in and about 1/3c of natural apple sauce for added moisture.  

Baked at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes was perfect for the 9X13 pan that I used.

My husband only wants cream cheese icing so in this respect the cake was no longer VEGAN once served but it was still delicious nevertheless.

Thanks for sharing this great recipe.  

I look forward to trying the banana version mentioned by another reviewer.

This cake was simply the best!
Everyone loved this cake, and were so surprised to hear it was vegan. It is so easy to make. i liked the fact that it didn't have any fake ingredients as egg/dairy substitutions.

I was skeptical, but it tastes like great chocolate cake!  I upped the cocoa to 1/3 cup.  I don't have a good recipe for vegan frosting, though-- frosting made with margarine is pretty lumpy and gross.  Still tasted good.

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did make cupcakes instead of one cake. The cupcakes only needed to bake for about 30 minutes. They came out very light, and they rose more than I expected.  No vinegar taste at all. Another skeptic won over.

I made this cake more as a experiment than anything else because I was curious how a vegan cake would end up. Interestingly, it's also the first chocolate ckae I've ever made. I usually make fruitcakes because they're my favorite but I made this for my brother, more of a chocolate person. Problems: didn't rise enough and was so dense that it seemed like a brownie. I really wanted a fluffier, moister cake so I was disappointed. Flavor was awesome though(really chocolatey with 1/2 a cup of cocoa and 1 tsp of instant coffee dissolved in the water) and with a chocolate frosting(unfortunately not vegan because my family only like cream cheese frostings) its definitely a 5 star cake. Plus, the flavor definitely improved the next day. The best part about it being vegan is that its so much lighter than every single other chocolate cake recipe on this site so I don't feel too bad about eating a big slice:) 1/3 a cup of oil is pretty awesome too. I want try it with applesauce and see if maybe the reason it didn't rise enough was because I used baking powder instead of baking soda. Plus, it might end up better as cupcakes so I'll try it that way too. My brother did like it though:)

I wasn't sure whether to give this three or four stars, but decided on the 4 since it is so simple to make and the ingredients are things you always have on hand.
However, when I made this yesterday I was a bit disappointed. Because some people said the cake was a little dry I added applesauce to it to moisten it and what came out of the oven was a really moist cake. I probably put a bit too much applesauce in as it was burnt on the outside and still a bit soggy on the inside. 
The biggest problem with this cake is that it breaks in pieces when you cut it! It's hard to slice it and we gave up in the end and just eat spoonfuls in a bowl. Also, the flavour was a bit strange right after it came out of the oven. Today it's delicious! Definitely wonderful when you make it ahead. Not sure what to do about the falling apart thing though...

Overall, this cake is 10x better than any vegan cake I've ever cooked out of a box. I've baked it several times, slightly varying the recipe each time. The biggest problems are lack of chocolately flavor and dryness. I double the amount of cocoa powder and use a dark-chocolate powder (definitely helps). I haven't tried it with applesauce yet, but maybe that will help moisten it up.

Wow!!! At first, I seriously thought that this was going to be the smallest, nastiest cake in the world. But, it is one of the moistest of all cakes I have ever tried. Some people were creeped out when I told them that it had no milk or eggs, but for those who held nothing against it (or were not told about the vegan part of the cake), all that tried it liked it, including me. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! I loved it and I hope to make another soon.

Excellent Cake and although I am not vegan I wanted to try it. I added 1/4 cup seedless rasberry jam and extra cocoa powder and it was amazing. It will be a hit whether you serve it at a birthday, as a dessert at a dinner party or just have on hand when guests come over!!

Great chocolate taste.  It was a bit dense for me, though.  But, I'm sure it was something that I did wrong.  I made it for my co-worker, who is allergic to eggs, and he enjoyed it quite a bit.

The cocoa doesn't add too much chocolate flavor. I agree with skipping it and going for other flavors. Very moist though. A great recipe to use as a cake base and experiment with.

Made for my vegan friend's birthday.  She RAVED that it was the best vegan cake she'd ever had.  Even non-vegans loved it!  Doubled the recipe (bake longer!!!) and made a simple icing w/ veg. shortening, veg. margarine, confectioners sugar and almond extract.  BIG HIT!

This cake was A+!!  Used 1/2C Nespresso espresso and 1/2C water instead of 1C water. Took it over the edge! I’m going to use balsamic instead of distilled vinegar like another reviewer suggested. Thanks for the recipe!!

AMAZING Recipe!!! Was looking for a quick and simple chocolate cake recipe for an evening sweet tooth. Already had all of the ingredients, and threw it together, came out perfect! This only made one round cake pan worth, so definitely double the recipe for a 2 layered cake.

Great recipe!  I doubled it, added a smidge more cocoa powder and subbed 1 cup of the water for fresh brewed coffee.  Baked in two heart shaped pans for about 40 mins.  It came out perfect!  Frosted with store bought vegan-friendly marshmallow icing and garnished with strawberries.  One of the best cakes I've ever made, vegan or not!

This recipe was perfect. This was only the 3rd time I've baked a cake from scratch and the 1st time it was successful. My mom, who baked professionally, loved it. I couldn't believe it! I used a little more cocoa and cooked it in an 8inch pan for 25 minutes. Light and fluffy. Sprinkled it with powdered sugar. Thank you!

Very moist & delicious! Reading through the comments, someone suggested balsamic vinegar, I followed that suggestion and it turned out great! I doubled the batter and before I had read that this required a loaf pan, I had already poured it into a large sheet cake pan. It made no difference, still came out perfectly moist and fluffy! I’d make it again! (I found a vegan chocolate frosting recipe online.)

Made this cake exactly as it read and I have to say -meh.  It's easy, simple ingredients  and the consistency is good. But the flavor is just so-so. Glad I tried this before taking it anywhere to share.

I made this cake as the recipe called for except I used apple cider vinegar instead of white and I substituted almond butter for oil. Also I ran out of regular flour and had to use some bread flour.
This is the first vegan cake that stayed raised. I am so pleased with this cake it is my new go recipe for cake. I have made so many cakes that came out of the oven looking good and dropped as soon as they cooled and were gooey.
So glad to have a recipe that works, even with substitutions.

I never rate anything, but I had to create an account just to rave about this recipe!  The only thing I changed was to use decaf coffee in place of the water and added dark chocolate chips.  I also used my own peanut butter icing.  I was swooning, it was so good!

This cake is delicious.  the recipe looked familiar because it was known as depression cake as in made during the depression when ingredients were scarce.

Had niece who is vegan over for her bday and the cake was a success. Piped some floretes using vegan raspberry buttercream and drizzled some almond milk/vegan dark chocolate ganache. I wanted to use Bundt cake so changed servings to 15 and turned out great. Took others advice and used balsamic vinegar. Also added espresso powder to water to bump up chocolate taste without coffee taste. May use this in place of regular chocolate cake in future. Thanks.

I used half the sugar, replaced the water with orange juice, and the white vinegar with apple cider vinegar, added the zest of 1 clementine and pulverized the fruit. Baked in a bunny pan and glazed with a ganache made of chopped dark chocolate with orange and coconut milk. It was excellent: not too sweet, but the orange and chocolate are a delicious combination..

I am not vegan, but I don't usually have eggs and milk on hand, so it's nice that I don't have to run to the store if I decide to make a cake last-minute... plus it turns out so moist and fluffy, and no one would guess it's vegan if you didn't tell them!

If your cake has come out dry and/or crunchy on the outside, you may be using a pan that is too dark (that was my problem the first time making this recipe). Try lowering your oven to 325 F and checking for doneness after 40 minutes instead of 45.

All in one bowl easy to make easy to clean after .  I’ve made this cake twice now both times using balsamic vinegar and adding chocolate chips.  I made it in a small Williams Sonoma bundt pan and both times turned out great!

Excellent cake- moist and chocolaty. Made it for my son’s birthday. Everyone loved it. Was great to have an excellent cake that everyone could eat. Pleased the vegan and non-vegans alike. Recipe is a classic snack cake recipe. A real keeper.

Big hit with me (when I made if for testing) and big hit with my vegan family members who were here for the holidays.  One weird thing - I didn't think it had much taste warm/ day I made - but the chocolate flavor intensified by the next day.  I'm actually going to look for some mini cake pan, to make it look like a regular cake instead of a loaf cake.  Definite keeper!

So delicious! Even for non-vegans. I have made this several times and when I give options of this vegan cake/cupcakes  and regular cake/cupcakes, always these are gone first. It has become my go-to for birthday parties.

I searched for a vegan choc cake recipe and found several but after seeing that I had all ingredients went with this one. Boy did I made the right decision!  This cake was simple to make in one bowl and came out DELICIOUS. Huge hit with vegan and non-vegan alike. Followed recipe as written but increased cocoa powder to 1/2 cup per other reviewer tips. Being a dark chocolate fan I used Hershey’s special dark cocoa in the mix and also made the dark choc frosting recipe that was listed on back of cocoa being sure to use vegan butter and almond milk.  Baked cake 30 minutes in 8 inch round cake pan, cooled in pan, removed cake, frosted and viola! Perfectly moist,excellent flavor, resturant quality and Everyone loved it!  This will not last long in my house!  Just added to my favorites!

I made this for my husband's birthday. I followed another reviewer's note about using cold coffee instead of water.  I also stirred mini chocolate chips into the batter and doubled it for two 9-inch round pans, to make a 2-layer cake. Those are the only variations, and it's the original "Betty Crocker Snack Cake" recipe.  It was excellent.  I frosted it with vegan cream cheese frosting (sub Tofutti cream cheese and Soy-Free Earth Balance for cream cheese and butter).  Big hit, even with the anti-vegan omnis in the fam.

My best friend LOVES cake but unfortunately she has numerous food allergies....eggs, soy, peanuts and almonds. I found this recipe and decided to try it for her 60th birthday. I made 12 cupcakes and frosted them and she absolutely LOVED them. I read a review that mentioned baking the cupcakes for 25 minutes, which I did, but next time I will start checking them at 20 minutes as they were a tad over baked.

Subbed the water for coffee. I made cupcakes! Baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they turned out perfect!

I usually want to change recipes up a bit, but this one is delicious as is! I made one in a loaf pan which was light and moist. I made another in a round pan which was a little more dense but still terrific.

Soooo good! Tastes more like dark chocolate cake. It’s on the rich side. At first I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar and found it to be a little bitter in combination with using apple cider vinegar, so I sprinkled in just enough white sugar to balance the flavor and it was PERFECT! Very moist, not too sweet (so it’s excellent with frosting & sprinkles), and very quick and easy! Took twenty-twenty five minutes for cupcakes!

It was very easy cake to make with a simple list of ingredients. I made it just as written.  I ended up baking it for about 52 minutes. I served it to my family and guests who demolished it.

This turned out great.  It was so satisfying to make a dessert that my vegan friend could enjoy with the rest of us.   I doubled the recipe, used a springform pan and increased the baking time to 65 minutes.  Served  dusted with icing sugar and plated with raspberries.

Have made this cake a few times, it turns out great every time ??.  I tried substituting water with coconut milk. The color of the cake turned out lighter & richer in flavour. Added some unsweetened chocolate chips too.

I just discovered this when I was thumbing through an issue from a few years ago.  The ingredients listed on the website are the same, but the instructions vary from the magazine.  I used a gluten free flour blend in place of the all-purpose flour, and added a cup of mini vegan chocolate chips to the batter.  I oiled an 8" round cake pan, put a circle of parchment paper on the bottom of the pan, and poured the batter in, per the magazine recipe's instructions.  I baked 27 minutes (the range was 25-35 minutes), and it came out perfectly.  I dusted it with additional cocoa powder and a little powdered sugar when cool, and it is the BEST cake I've ever had, gluten-free and vegan, or not.  Mine did not get as tall as pictured (maybe the gluten-free flour), but it kind of resembles the texture of brownies.  My whole family raved about it.  It is very chocolatey, extremely moist,  and perfectly sweet.  I will definitely make this again (very, very soon)!

Tastes fine made as-is, but needs to be made in a small pan - it doesn’t have enough structure to be suitable for large cakes and definitely nothing tiered. It came out a bit on the dry side and fell apart when turned out when I made this in a hal-sheet pan. Probably will not make again.

I made it just as written except used 2t of balsamic vinegar in place of the white. I doubled the recipe and made a 2 layer cake (~30min bake time). It was delicious and moist and perfect to me, but add more cocoa powder if you want a rich, chocolatey cake.

I've been looking for a vegan mugcake that doesn't taste awful and this recipe is fantastic! A thousand times better than the first runner up. I just set the serving size to 1, put everything in a cup, and microwaved for 1 minute 10 seconds. :D Thank you!

The texture turned out great. Very light and fluffy! The only downfall is that they are not sweet. I would definitely use 1.5 cups of sugar instead of one! I made cupcakes and cooked for about 20 minutes, and then put vanilla icing!

Huge hit with vegans and non-vegans alike! Super easy, something I'll always have the ingredients for in my house, and so moist!

I used avocado oil and balsamic vinegar - worked so well.

Thanks for the recipe!!!

I used 1/2 cup Agave nectar and 1/2 cup white sugar for the sweetening, to add to the moisture of the cake. I used 1/2 cup cocoa powder, instead of 1/4 cup, as others recommended. My cooking time was 35 minutes in a metal, 9 inch, round cake pan. I made it this way at least 4 times and I added chocolate chips to the recipe 3 times, instead of making a frosting. It was really good.

Awesome and SUPER EASY! All my ingredients are organic, I used a 9" round, and baked for 35 minutes.  I followed some suggestions: doubled the cocoa and used balsalmic vinegar instead of white, added some mini chocolate chips, reduced the sugar, and substituted a little agave syrup, and OMG, it's wonderful!

I substituted balsamic for white vinegar and added vegan chocolate chips. Turned out amazing! Moist but not too heavy.  I made cupcakes and a cake, filled them with vegan peanut butter fluff.  The cake took about 30 minutes longer to bake through than the cupcakes.

Super Tasty! I have made it at least 10 times! Definitely double the chocolate because it has more of a red velvet cake taste if you don't.

Just made this cake, used canola oil, had no vegetable oil, covered it with icing sugar after it cooled, and it’s delicious!

This recipe was pretty good. After I baked it I noticed it was a bit dry, however I used an old trick my grandma taught me where I sealed the cake with a couple pieces of bread for a few hours. That helped moisten them! I used another recipe here for vegan peanut butter frosting and it was a huge hit!

If you make this recipe as written it does not have much of a chocolate taste to it and has a very strong vinegar taste. I'm not sure why is has baking soda and vinegar. I will try to adjust it to taste better next time.  After a few minutes of searching for a different recipe to try next time I just found this is almost identical to the King Arthur Flour's original cake pan cake.

Great recipe, and well loved by my vegan friends. One exception is that white sugar is not vegan (animal product used in the bleaching process) so I substituted turbino sugar.

Excellent recipe.  I sprinkled powered sugar on top.  Easy, not too sweet.  Will definitely make this again, and add nuts, maybe coconut.

Not sure why a combo of baking soda and vinegar is used.  Why not just use baking powder? As I thought, this recipe is just flat dense cakes. They weren't very good. Modify them with baking powder and more cocoa and they were better.  I get so fed up with vegan recipes using all these weird ingredients that could be replaced with easier to get or use ones.

I would like to revise my earlier review of 4 stars. The longer you have this cake, the better it gets. I must add that I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup. So good!

We make these as cupcakes and bake around 25 minutes. We love these better than regular cupcakes and get a lot of compliments on them when we take them other places. No one ever thinks they are vegan.

Excellent! -- I took the advice of a previous poster & doubled the chocolate.. don't forget to add extra milk as well. Perfect. I made cupcakes so cooked for only about 30 minutes. Love it. Easy & delicious.

Turned out great! You would never know they were vegan. I find that they taste even better a day or two after they’ve been baked. Definitely a keeper!

I made a mistake but they came out great! I used 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 2 teaspoons baking soda and they rose almost immediately after going in. I also sifted dry ingredients first and added all the wet ingredients and added the vinegar very last. As I finished beating I saw the chemical reaction adding air to the batter. I made a basic vanilla frosting for this.

This cake is delicious and anytime I make it . So easy. 
I bake it in a bunt pan then cut the cake in half, make a coconut whipped cream and then roll strawberries blueberries or whatever is handy, into the coconut cream and put it between the two halves. Vegan icing to die for. 4 ingredients. Trust me, make this for the frosting and your chocolate cravings will be satisfied!

Rich, decedent,  delicious. Quick and easy.  I made this cake for my daughter's 31st birthday.  She and the other guests raved about it, not even knowing it is vegan.  I doubled the recipe to fill a 13th cake pan.

This was a really good cake!  My daughter is a strict vegan, so I used Turbinado sugar instead of white, which I had to mix a little longer.  The crystals dissolved fine when it baked.  I was worried it would be a crunchy cake.  This doesn't need a sweet icing.  A simple glaze would be fine....if I make or buy vegan powdered sugar =)  This is good with coconut cream whipped topping or  coconut milk ice-cream on top!

This is  a wonderful vegan cake that anyone will love. I made it for a party and everyone enjoyed it and had no idea it was vegan. The cake is nice an moist, rises well, and has great texture.  I gave it 4 stars because it needs extra chocolate and  vanilla to boost the flavor but with that added it would be a 5 star recipe.

Made this for Father's Day.  I was very pleased.   I made two adjustments:   Substituted applesauce for vegetable oil and balsamic vinegar for the white distilled vinegar - everything else was as directed by the recipe.  I think I over baked the cake, so although flavorful it seemed a little dry.  That being said, this is definitely a keeper and I will continue to tweak until I get it just right.  Don't be afraid to try this recipe.  It's simple, fast and delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

My sister and I have been making this cake for the last several years. We are not vegan. The cake is moist and we switch out the oil for applesauce, use whole wheat or half whole wheat and half all purpose (depending on pantry stock), and add a bit more cocoa. We have made cupcakes out the batter, never a cake, sooo good! Especially with a cream cheese (or fake cream cheese type) frosting!

My daughter wanted to make a cake so we made this one. This is basically Crazy Cake or Mud Cake. I learned to make it in 8th grade home ec class. We made it as written using gluten free flour. We did not bake in a loaf pan, she used a bundt and adjusted the time. The only change I would make would be to add a bit more cocoa powder maybe. We topped with powdered sugar and strawberries and it was devoured in no time at all.

This cake was moiiiiiiiist. I mean it made me the moistest I've ever been. I did make some modifications though - I replaced the flour with 1 cup of honey, and the water with 4 eggs. I know it's not vegan anymore after that but if you wanna be moist you gotta do what you gotta do. This cake too thick.

I made this cake last week,  and we loved it! I didn't have any white vinegar,  so I used apple cider vinegar,  which worked out fine. This is a very delicious,  moist cake! My 'go-to' cake uses freshly brewed coffee instead of water to deepen the chocolate flavor. I didn't do this when I made this recipe,  but probably will next time.  A simple, moist cake that was great on its own. I planned on making a frosting,  but it was delicious without it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 13 x 9" pan.  It only took 40 minutes to cook and turned out fantastic.  Non-vegans had no idea it was vegan.  Delish!

Loved this!   I doubled the recipe, and baked it in a dark bundt pan, and it came out terrific.   I saw one person's suggestion to switch to balsamic vinegar but I was a little leery of that, so I went with 1 tsp white vinegar and 1 tsp balsamic (total of 2 tsp since I doubled the recipe).
I also added 5 minutes to the cooking time since it seemed pretty muddy at 45min.   50 min for the doubled recipe in the bundt pan was perfect and the cake got rave reviews both from the birthday guy and the in-laws.

This cake turned out excellent.  Moist and chocolaty.  I made sure all of my dry ingredients were fresh (not expired).   It is important to adjust the cooking time - the recipe as written is for a loaf pan, so I adjusted the cooking time to about 20 minutes because I made two 9" round layers.   I missed this detail the first time I made it and it came out flavorful, but dense.  Will definitely be making this again and again.  Can't even tell it's vegan.

This recipe was very easy to follow with simple ingredients that I already had in my cabinets.  As others mentioned, I doubled the cocoa. I was surprised how fluffy, moist and delicious it was. I'll make this one again.

It was a simple and delicious cake, but it needs a little more flavor. I substituted milk for the water and I added a couple of eggs to make the cake fluffier.

Used 1/2 cup cocoa powder as others had recommended.  It was a little dry but I didn't check it until exactly 45 mins.  Next time I would check it earlier.  Was tasty.

Followed the most of the recipe. The only substitution I made was organic cane sugar instead of white sugar. The cupcakes came out perfect, and I like that this was a small amount of cake batter. I made eight cupcakes, and with other recipes I typically make fourteen. If I'm in the mood for chocolate cake, I'll use this recipe again.

Surprisingly yummy! And it's safe to eat the batter which is both a very good and a bad thing...
I made the recipe for a dozen cupcakes so they cooked in a little less than half the time. I used balsamic vinegar instead of white and added more cocoa powder. Next time I'll add chocolate chips to make them even more decadent.

I made it exactly as described and initially I thought the ends and edges were a bit overdone, however, I put it in an airtight container overnight and it was perfectly moist!  I love how easy this was to make and love that my son who has allergies can enjoy a delicious cake on his first birthday!!

good recipe, made it for vegan friend's birthday. I used cream of tartar instead of vinegar and topped it with vegan whipped cream mixed with cinnamon. Made 14 cupcakes and backed for 15 mins.

I made it both ways. Cake and cupcakes!!!  It was really good both ways, but definitely better as cupcakes! Thank you for this recipe I have four-year-old twins with very severe dairy, egg, and nut allergies and now they are able to have treats for parties at preschool.

I have made this cake countless times now, and it is so simple and cool proof I recommend it to people all the time. It's actually a great cake to bake with little kids because the batter can be eaten raw without having to worry about salmonella. It's also a good cake to prepare for people with egg and or dairy allergies. I usually make it as cupcakes (I throw in a half cup of semi sweet chocolate chips) and frost the finished cupcakes with a simple buttercream. But I have also doubled the recipe to make 2 9-inch round cakes for a layer cake. 
I highly recommend this to anyone who isn't an experienced baker, but would like a delicious scratch chocolate cake recipe that's easy to throw together anytime.

As recommended by another review, I upped the cocoa powder to a 1/2 cup, portioned them as 1/8 cup per cupcake and cooked 14 minutes and they came out perfectly moist and delicious! Served them at my brother and his wife's baby shower.... total hit!

Thank you Sue!!

I am not Vegan but am allergic to dairy. There is so much hidden dairy in sweets that I have really missed out so have been dying for a recipe like this. Especially love it because it is so simple. I dont even use a mixer, just a whisk to blend. 

I have made it twice now. Both were great. The first time I made it exactly accordingly to the recipe but made two very slight changes this time.  One intentionally and one by accident.  When I measured the oil I let the cup overflow a bit to add a little more oil for moistness. The other change was I accidentally used my 1/3 cup measure instead of the 1/4 for the cocoa. No big deal. They were a little moister and a tiny bit more chocolatey.  

Both times I made cupcakes and got 12 out of each batch. I baked at 350 for 18 minutes and they were perfect. Used cupcake liners both times. 

I frosted them with " Duncan Hines Creamy
Home-Style Frosting-Classic Chocolate" which is dairy free. Yummy!

A note to the person using margarine in their frosting. Margarine does have dairy so your frosting would not be truly Vegan. 

Thank you again. They are truly a restricted chocolate lovers treat. 
Janis

Love love love this recipe. I was looking for an eggless and butterless recipe when I stumbled on this one. My family loved it they couldn't tell it was vegan and they most definitely prefer this over my regular chocolate cake recipe so I'm definitely keeping this and use it as my go to chocolate cake recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe.

This is my first Vegan cake.  Making it for my grown children who are vegan.  I substituted the vegetable oil for coconut oil.  The recipe was very liquidy using 1 cup of water (almost the consistency of hot chocolate) so I increased the flour to 3 cups.  It rose nicely and was very moist.

I made the recipe almost exactly the way it is written. The only thing I did differently was add an extra tablespoon or so of the cocoa powder. The batter was a little runnier than normal cake mix, so I was a little worried but it turned out great! So fluffy and moist. And I am not a vegan at all but my daughter has been thinking about going vegetarian/vegan. So she convinced me to try it. My meat loving husband even liked it!

I decided to try this recipe just to give a vegan cake a shot. Baked in two 8" pans for 18 minutes for a birthday cake. It was impossible to handle because it was the CRUMBLIEST cake ever (from the lack of eggs). It is moist and chocolatey but I would not make it again. I would suggest making it as cupcakes if you need a vegan recipe but otherwise make the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III or Extreme Chocolate Cake.

This is the recipe I have been looking for! I am not a vegan but I never have dairy products on-hand. Plus, this can be switched to vanilla by switching the cocoa powder with instant vanilla pudding mix (also vegan). Best of all, this recipe can be adjusted to one serving to make a single cupcake =)

Delicious! My 8 yr old son is allergic to wheat, dairy & eggs, so I used rice flour & cornstarch. Other recipes have been very dry & bland. This was moist & tasty!  He was happy to know he can now enjoy chocolate cake with the rest of the family. So glad I found this recipe!
I made them as cupcakes for him, too!

This didn't work out perfect for me the first time but I like the balance of ingredients (mostly) so I will try again. The 45 minutes of baking time it calls for really overcooked my cake so it was dry and wouldn't come out of the pan. If I made it again, I would grease AND flour my pan, and I would cook it for a shorter amount of time. I made one change to the recipe which I think was for the better--I doubled the cocoa which turned it into a dark chocolate cake and went divine with my cherry-strawberry "buttercream" frosting (vegan recipe).
I'm giving it four stars because I think the instructions have it baking too long, but I'm hopeful it can be a great cake next time by making the changes I noted.

I have made this recipe twice (both for parties) and I love how moist and delicious it is! I also used apple cider vinegar instead of the distilled white vinegar and it worked wonderfully.

This cake is AMAZING!!! I'm not vegan, but I love recipes that can come entirely from the pantry - no running to the market for milk or eggs - you already have all the ingredients! It's cheap, easy, and delicious!! I also included 1/2 tbsp nutmeg of a little spice, and used sunflower oil (instead of vegetable oil) for an earthier flavour. LOVE IT and will make it again!!!

I doubled this recipe for a 9 x 13 cake pan. Takes 45 minutes to cook, at 350. I added all ingredients into one big bowl, and beat for 2 minutes. An easy cake to make, and very delicious too. I love it, and I'm not vegan. Great recipe for anyone who has egg allergies. Enjoy!

Note: unless you are using beet sugar or organic sugars, regular white sugar is NOT vegan.  Mass produced white sugar is processed through cow bone char, not exactly vegan.

I made this for my son's 1st birthday party as cupcakes!! He is allergic to milk and eggs. I figured a vegan cake would be best and IT WAS!! This recipe is so yummy and moist and rich. We had nearly 100 guests and all of them LOVED it! We didn't tell them until afterwords that the cupcakes were Vegan... they were all shocked!!

As a non-vegan, this cake is delicious and so simple. Yep, they won't believe that it's vegan. Thank you Sue, and thank you reviewers for the great tips. My changes: 1) increased cocoa to 1/2 c, 2) switched to apple cider vinegar, 3) switched to cold espresso for the water, or added 2 packets of espresso powder to the water, and 4) decreased baking time to 35 minutes. Make this a day ahead for best results.

Made 30 servings and didn't have cocoa powder, so I used two tablespoons of vanilla extract and they were great. Love how it didn't require soy or coconut milk.

I added chocolate chips and made these into cupcakes.  They were okay.  Not very sweet, not much flavor, and the cupcakes stuck the to the papers. I won't be making this one again.

I made a few changes to the recipe and ultimately it came out like a really dense, moist, slightly spongey chocolate cake. My family couldn't tell it was vegan, and my mom said it tastes just like the good luck cake she had as a kid.
I substituted 1/3 cup melted coconut oil for the vegetable oil, used 2 tsp. balsamic vinegar instead of  1 tsp. white vinegar, and doubled the cocoa powder. 
The only thing that bugged me about this cake is the outside kind of became this really glossy shell but tastes just fine and isn't burnt? That could totally have been the coconut oil, but I'd definitely make this again. I might add a little more sugar and vanilla next time and try a convection oven vs. my traditional one.

Wow! Amazing recipe! I goofed and added 1 tsp of powder along with the soda, which I think was an great error, and used 1 T vinegar (I think because another recipe called for those ingredients and measurements). The cake was sooooo spongey and delicious. I didn't think 1/4 cocoa was enough so I doubled it and changed the water to dark chocolate almond milk (Silk).  Amazing!

Nice & easy to make. Also made it with Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 Gluten Free Flour & it turned out fine. This last time that I made it the middle sank and was pudding like even though I baked it the recommended time. I just piled a bunch of fresh raspberries in the sunken center & dusted some powdered sugar...it was still tasty!

Delicious!!! After receiving the AR and a phone call from my husband saying his mother was coming for dinner that night I quickly started searching for a dessert. I was a little hesitant about this dessert because it was vegan, however, I had all of the ingredients on hand. A quick and easy recipe which came together in minutes. I followed the recipe exactly as written in the magazine, using a 9" cake pan and dusting the top with powder sugar and cocoa powder. My in laws and husband said it was the best chocolate cake they've eaten and my MIL asked for the recipe. Definitely a gem of a recipe!

This cake is great! It's so hard to find recipes my dad and I can both eat, since he's allergic to milk and I'm allergic to nuts. I made the cake exactly as written, except substituting the white vinegar with balsamic vinegar, partly because of the suggestions in the reviews, and partly because the white vinegar we had expired two years ago... But I digress. This cake is moist, fudgy,  and delicious!

A bit bland. not high chocolate flavor. Next time I will add 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips and 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper to the batter. I also will thin out my homemade  peanut butter icing and do a drizzle on top.

I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and replaced the oil with 1/2 smashed ripe banana and 1/4 cup applesauce. The cake was DELICIOUS, very moist (but not goopy in the middle), and just sweet enough to make it feel like a treat. If you're trying to cut sugar and oil, this is a fantastic recipe to tweak!

This is a gorgeous cake! I doubled the ingredients and cooking time but other than that stuck to the recipe. Its moist and light, and not too sweet. My non vegan family loved it and I am making it again today on the request of my dairy and egg loving boyfriend! Leave it to settle all day or overnight in the fridge for an even better taste, it needs to sit awhile for the flavour and moistness to really come out. Thank you for this recipe!

Ok so my first attempt was awful. I modified the recipe according to others reviews. I used apple sauce instead of oil. Used half soy milk half water. And doubled to cocoa I also used less sugar as I was using brown sugar so thought it would be too sweet ...it turned out like rubber and dry and an awful taste. It looked awful too. 
Second attempt I used coconut oil.... water as per recipe. I also used self raising flour here in Australia and I left out the vinegar. I still used bicarbonate.  I also left out the salt. I used brown CSR sugar which is vegan but because I prefer brown over white too. I also used a hand mixer and the batter turned out smooth like a packet mix cake also tasted like it too! So I had high hopes. I baked it but after baking and cooling the middle sunk :( So it's either too moist or soft or I over mixed which I didn't mix for long. Anyway we will see how it tastes today. It seemed too hard to make a coconut oil frosting for it with the heat here, it would melt. So I'm just dusting it with icing sugar and raspberries in the middle. It's a bday cake for a friend so I hope it tastes good! It smelt 'normal' cooking so it should be fine.  But might be crumbly.

Sooooo yummy, really moist and decandent - and super chocolatey despite only using cocoa powder. I made it for my mother-in-law who is dairy and soy intolerant and the whole family loved it. Will definitely make again

This recipe was super easy and really delicious. I used it to make cupcakes which took 20 mins to bake. I used wholemeal self raising flour instead of white & had to increase the water to approximately 1 1/2 cups to get the right consistency. If you use SR flour, you can leave out the salt and baking soda. I also followed the review by Abztrakt and used 1 tablespoon of Balsamic vinegar instead of 1 teaspoon of white distilled vinegar. And I also used raw sugar instead of white. Thanks for the recipe... I will definitely use this one again!

I made this just yesterday and it was delicious and I am a HUGE chocolate lover and cake lover so since I barely became vegan 5 days ago, its hard for me to find Vegan chocolate cake. But this was the best! It was bad that I even made more today and made it with homemade dark chocolate fudge frosting (I used the rest to make fudge ice cream) ^-^ I used some alternatives making it though... I used fruit puree (I used frozen mixed berries with a little water, not too much; I froze the fruits myself) instead of vegetable oil. I also used coconut sugar instead of reg. sugar. I also used apple cider vinegar and did not taste it at all. I was going to use coconut flour but I wanted to taste more of the chocolate. I also used Himalayan Pink Salt instead of reg. Salt. The first day I made it, I microwaved my frozen mixed berries for like 2 mins. just to make some juice from it and I poured or dipped the cake into it and it was delicious! The 2nd one I made (today), I made Chocolate Fudge Frosting, I used unsweetened cocoa powder, some coconut sugar, coconut milk, some Himalayan Pink Salt, and some warm fruit juice (couldnt taste it though, the chocolate was still too strong, but when I added it to the cake, the cake and fudge mixed together well, the chocolate wasnt that strong. But my brothed loved it and he is a meat/dairy lover.. he said the cake made him full.. haha But I loved this cake ingredient! Thank you so much! ????

This recipe was amazing, however; I did tweak it a little bit. I changed the vegetable oil to coconut oil and swapped to apple cider vinegar instead of white. It made a fantastic difference!

Absolutely delicious! My dairy-allergy son (3yr) was asking for chocolate cake after watching a cartoon episode where they made some.  I used all the ingredients except I did not have vanilla, and I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  I also added vegan chocolate chips!  This is my new favorite recipe for birthday cakes!

I made a gluten free version by mixing rice flour with a gluten free pre made mix (1/2 and 1/2). I also substituted half sugar with molasses and took a teaspoon of liquid from each liquid ingredient to even it out. Also put balsamic vinegar in it :) my partner said it was the best muffin/cupcakes he's ever had! Also, very important to only mix until all dry ingredients become wet (lumps are fine!) . Good  luck !

I made this for my son's first birthday since my family is vegan, and it was a hit!  It tastes like a brownie cake! I followed the recipe pretty much to a tee, only I used just a *little* more oil and instead of white sugar I used cane sugar. My son said "Yum!" for the first time while eating this cake! :)

Really good! Didn't even add frosting. Nice crisp top with spongy inside. For cupcakes bake for about 18 minutes. Original recipe makes 12 cupcakes. Definitely making these again.

I have a new baby grandson!!! that has a milk protein allergy and so his mother isn't taking in any dairy.  This recipe was surprisingly  easy and delicious.  The cake was very moist and flavorful.  I put fresh strawberries between the layers and on top of the cake and sprinkled powered sugar on the top.  My family loved this recipe.

I absolutely loved this chocolate cake recipe. We have family that are vegans and don't even like sweets... but they ate three each. Every single person that tried these were dumbfounded when they heard they were vegan. However, I have found that if you use apple cider vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar it seems to have a lighter, sweeter taste

Every time I offer to bake for my sister, she requests the "vinegar brownies"! This cake is so rich that we call it brownies, but not so rich that you can't stomach it. The balance of sweetness is perfect and no one every believes me when I tell them it's vegan. I like to make it in my mini cupcake tin, and they come out just right for a bite size dessert.

I almost didn't believe all the rave reviews but this cake is phenomenal! I'm not vegan just fresh out of eggs and an incredible craving for chocolate cake. Problem solved and I'll never make chocolate cake with eggs again. I used balsamic like someone else had suggested, well because I love chocolate gelato drizzled with balsamic. Don't hesitate to try this recipe!!

I made two cakes in loaf pans and took them to work. Everyone loved it. They were shocked it was vegan.  I am lactose intolerant, but not vegan, and this recipe gave me a chance to have some WONDERFUL cake without illness resulting.  The cake was dense, rich, chocolatey.  I added a sprinkle of chili powder to the batter for a little kick. It really added depth of flavor.

I decided to try this cake using rice flour as suggested in the original post. Even my family that specifically asked for a gluten free vegan cake did not like it.  Perhaps it would be better with regular flour but....

This cake was really good!  We followed the recipe as written.  I just doubled it to make a big batch of cupcakes (27 cupcakes from the double batch).  I made a cookie crust, topped it with chocolate chips.  Baked the crust for 8 minutes, let cool.  Then add the cupcake batter on top and bake.  Then, topped with a marshmallow (vegan ones are great!) and "roasted" it in the oven for a short bit.  It's like a cupcake s'more.  Yummy!

This is the first cake I've ever baked and it turned out awesome. So easy to make. I doubled the recipe to make two 9 inch round cakes with dark choc chips and a peanut butter filling, only subs were - cider vinegar and soft light brown sugar. Thanks for the recipe :)

This recipe was amazing! I didnt add as much oil as it said, partly because i didnt have enough. It came out very moist. I made them as cupcakes and baked them for 25 minutes at the same temperature. Great Job!

I just put the cake into the oven, so I haven't even tasted the finished product yet!  But the batter is delicious!  I almost think it's better than a regular recipe.  I followed the instructions basically, though I doubled the recipe as someone else said, to make a full-sized 13" x 9" cake.  I also used Balsamic vinegar, as another person suggested.  OMG!  This is so good, and so easy.  I'm sure I'll be using this recipe again and again, whether vegan is needed or not!  I'll frost the cake with Pillsbury's Vegan/Gluten-Free Vanilla Frosting.

Hands down the best chocolate cake recipe I have made or had. Subs I made: whole wheat pastry flour for the flour, coconut sugar for the sugar, olive oil for the oil. I baked it in a glass loaf pan for 35 minutes at 325 degrees and it came out perfectly. Eating it warm with whipped coconut cream right now! :)

I took it out of the oven and it looked amazing. However, while it was cooling, it collapsed and looked and tasted like a brownie. It was still delicious. I tested the baking soda that I used, and it was still good. I'm thinking that maybe I mixed it too long ??

Good cupcakes. I used balsamic vinegar and added some cayenne to half the batch. It was great. 

I made a vegan ganache with semi-sweet chocolate and coconut milk to frost them.

Following the recipe for the cake batter, I tried making cupcakes instead of just one cake and even baking for 25 min was just a bit too much. I'd recommend closer to 20min.

This cake is off the hook...the very best chocolate cake EVER!! Chocolatey & fudgy... Delicious whether you are vegan or not. I top mine with vegan chocolate ganache or if no vegan guests, regular chocolate ganache... Awesome! I double the recipe and do three 8" layers.... It also tastes better and better as time goes by....if it lasts that long! ;)

My first attempt at a vegan cake. This was so easy to make and extremely delicious.  I doubled the recipe and used boiling water instead of room temperature water. I also used two teaspoons of instant coffee. I used two 9 inch round cake pans to make a double layer cake. It took approximately 35 mins to bake. Try it, you will not be disappointed!!!

I do love a recipe that can act as a base for embellishment - and this is one of them.  I really like dark chocolate and Mexican chocolate flavorings, so I used 2/3c chocolate, about 1.5 tps of cinnamon and a generous couple of shakes of a low-heat cayenne, doubled the vanilla & added a dash of almond extract.  

Also, I find applesauce to be a really important binder in vegan baked goods, so I cut the water in half and added a cup of applesauce.  Came out divine :)

Delish! I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar instead of white and they were still heavenly - with a dab of vegan buttercream frosting they are irresistible.

Completely delicious!!! Did everything according to recipe except I made a dozen rather large cupakes baking for 20min @ 350. Used a vegan friendly caramel buttercream to finish them off. I'm so happy with the result. These will be made time and time again!

Loved the recipe. I did as others did and substituted a couple of ingredients. I used 1 cup of coconut sugar instead of 1 cup of cane sugar as it does not raise your blood sugar according to the Dr. Oz show. Also used 1/2 cup of dark unsweetened cocoa powder instead of 1/3 cup. Used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar as someone else suggested. Instead of 1 cup of water, I used 1 cup of canned coconut milk. Also substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour. They came out dense and quite chocolatey. If you want more chocolate richness, try adding vegan chocolate chips. 
For frosting I used Earth Balance buttery vegan spread, real vanilla, cocoa powder and vegan icing sugar. Makes an unbelievably awesome and creamy icing. Even my friends who love to eat dairy cannot believe this cupcake and icing are egg and dairy free. My next experiment will be to substitute the whole wheat flour with 1 cup of brown rice flour and 1/2 cup of almond flour as someone in these reviews suggested.

It bakes up really well. For some reason I needed about a tablespoon more liquid, so I just added more oil, but it was great and rose up well. Tastes great. :)

I made these last minute for one of my vegan friend's birthday and she LOVED them. These are fantastic. This was my first time baking vegan and I must admit that I was quite nervous. I double the recipe because there would be a lot of kids to feed and they all loved them. Super moist and perfect. I used one batch of this vegan frosting recipe for my two batches of cupcakes: http://dairyfreecooking.about.com/od/sweetsaucesfrostings/r/chocfrost.htm

This is a great chocolatey cake "loaf"! I baked as instructions said, in a 9x5 loaf pan, which makes for perfect snacks by the slice.  I substituted the oil with 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed and 1 T butter, and this turned out just as I had hoped.  It's perfectly chocolatey but not overly sweet, with a nice cakey but not too crumbly consistency. Mine was done in about 30 minutes.

This cake recipe is very versatile. I baked this in a swiss roll pan, for 12-15 minutes and then turned it out onto parchment paper dusted with cocoa powder and rolled it up while it was hot and let it cool completely. I used a simple vegan vanilla frosting as the filling. It was a hit!

I made this recipe and changed 1/4 cup cocoa to 1/2 cup cocoa. I used a whole teaspoon of salt instead of 1/2 tsp. And I made cupcakes and baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees F. 

I made a frosting of 1/4 cup vegan margarine, 1/4 cup vegan shortening, 1 and 3/4 cups powdered sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1/8 cup soy milk.  Whip the fats until fluffy, add the sugar and beat for 2 minutes.  Add the vanilla and soy milk and whip for 5-6 minutes. 

I added some cherry pie filling in the middle of each cupcake after I frosted them and passed the rest in a bowl.  These have to be kept chilled or the frosting turns too soft.

You would not know they were vegan!

This is a great recipe. I am not a vegan but my other family members are so I made this cake to please everyone. It was a big hit. Although I did tweek it a bit. I used coconut milk in place of the water. Plus poked holes in the baked cake and pored more coconut milk over it to add moisture. I also doubled the recipe and made it a layer cake with a vegan coconut frosting.

These made amazing cupcakes. My daughter is allergic to dairy, nuts & eggs & is going to a birthday party tomorrow. I made these so she will have be able to eat cake too :)

I did the following mod's: 
3/4 cup sugar rather than 1 cup
1/3 cup apple sauce instead of vegetable oil
1 cup sunflower milk instead of water

I just made this for my daughter and it is delicious!  I had my doubts, but I was wrong.  I used 3/4 cup of organic sugar instead of white sugar and it turned out great.  Used vegetable shortening, water, icing sugar and almond flavoring for frosting - very good.

Very delicious! I've made them several times and people were shocked they were vegan. For frosting I melt vegan chocolate chips with a little coconut oil, add a little rice milk and beat in powder sugar and together they are my favorite chocolate cupcakes.

I give it a 5, rarely do I do this, because it's just excellent for the chocolate lovers in my house who are under a certain diet. I did follow the advice of Abztrakt, except I used a Pomegranate Balsamic Vinegar instead. The result was pure chocolate delight paired with fat free chocolate pudding. Thanks to this recipe I can satisfy the chocolate cravings in my house! in other words, a total sweet-tooth lifesaver. The smell that took over my house had neighbors knocking :D

I make this recipe regularly as cupcakes, with variations. I have experimented with adding chopped chocolate (which does very nicely, because the crumbs melt), defrosted frozen berries, cinnamon and nutmeg, and finely chopped glacé ginger (this is a particular hit in combination with the chocolate).

I have also replaced the cocoa and half the flour with almond meal and added lemon juice/rind and raspberries. Sweet and sticky, but very tasty.

This was a very yummy cake; i made it for my family and they all loved it!! My only change was using balsamic vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar as it compliments the chocolate better.

Excellent vegan recipe for chocolate cake, although I substituted the oil for sesame oil and strong coffee for the water which really enhances the chocolate flavour.  Great recipe for cupcakes as well

I decided to make this vegan recipe, since I didn't have a few ingredients on hand for regular chocolate cupcakes. I made the recipe into cupcakes instead of a cake. I didn't know how I would like it, since I haven't had a vegan cupcake before, but it was delicious! I could hardly tell that it was a vegan recipe. My family sure enjoyed it! I made a chocolate chip buttercream frosting, which added the perfect touch! :)

The cake turned out very well, everyone loved it. I baked for 35 mins. The first time around, 45 mins, as mentioned turned out to be too hard for our liking.35 mins did the trick, its nice and moist, can't believe its vegan! thanks for the great recipe!

Trying it for first time and we'll see. Used white whole wheat flour , Hershey cocoa special dark edition (about 3/4 cup since im doubling the recipe for a 9 x 11 pan lined with parchment  paper)  and raspberry balsamic vinegar we bought at Figones in Napa Valley. Also used coffee instead of water and the Mediterranean blend oil from Costco.

I am not a baker, but found this recipe easy to make. Always use king Arthur flour for best results- I use organic unbleached all purpose. Made glaze w 1 tbs. almond  vanilla  milk and 1/2 c confectioner sugar stirred together. Drizzle on cake and top w chopped walnuts sprinkled on top. Still vegan ( For my guest)  but also delicious topping.

I made this last night as cuppcakes. May I just say this recipe was awful! They wouldn't come out of the parer, I had to use a knife. The insides were raw and the outsides were burnt. I will not be making this recipe again!!!!!

This recipe has the potential to be a great recipe with a few minor alterations. I think this cake lacks a chocolate flavor. It would be better if you add another 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. The texture is great, just a little crumbly. I think it's because of the lack of eggs. Overall it's a pretty good recipe.

This cake is perfect: you would never know it's vegan. I made it with KADart05's suggested vegan frosting and it was awesome. I later baked this batter as cupcakes, which only took about 20 minutes.

A friend is allergic to eggs, and I wanted him to be able to have some cake with us. He said not to bother because he'd had vegan cakes before, and they were yucky. I made it anyway, and he LOVED it. We kept going back to get more slices - it was gone within a few hours. Best vegan cake I have ever tasted!

This is a delicious cake and so easy to make.  I did increase cocoa to 1/2 cup and decreased flour to 1 1/4 cups. Since it was in a loaf pan I did not add frosting.

I very much enjoyed this cake. The only problem I had was its lack of fluffiness that non-vegan cakes have. But thats what you get for being healthier(: It was very delicious nonetheless and the crust of the cake was much like that of a brownie. I'd make this again.

I find it has better texture as a cake than as a cupcake. I have made both ways. I sometimes add a handful of chocolate chips. Kids love it. Always get asked for the recipe. Never have to worry about allergies when sending it to school.

I own a whole foods store and we bake and sell muffins and cakes for our customers. I had a special request for a vegan cake, so I decided to try this recipe out in the form of cupcakes before I made the whole cake. I made it exactly as written- with a little extra cocoa (1/3 cup) and apple cider vinegar instead of white- baked it into cupcakes (made 9 filled 3/4 full). I drizzled them with thick icing made of cocoa powder, powdered sugar, hot water, pinch of salt and vanilla (didn't measure anything- sorry) and the end result was amazing! These are nice and dark and will appeal to the real chocolate lovers out there. This recipe could almost pass for a caky brownie. My customers will be happy.

My new fav to whip up when most sleep! so easy, moist and satisfying. I like to sprinkle with powder sugar after it comes out. I use coconut oil and 3/4 c. org. sugar and also a touch or cinnamon and a pinch of fresh ground coffee!

Awesome cake!
Perfect and I must use it at least twice a month now as it's just scrummy!

I followed this recipe to a T and made moist & delicious cupcakes (baked at 350degrees for 22 minutes).  Then i made them again using all whole wheat flour for a healthier version.  They came out a little dry, but nothing that a little icing wouldn't fix.  =)

The best chocolate cake I have ever made....maybe even eaten! I used half white sugar and half brown sugar (as that is what I had on hand), and whole wheat flour. Absolutely amazing- moist and people couldn't believe that it was vegan! I used another reviewer's vegan frosting recipe and it was divine. I might go make this again right now....

Delicious cake! I'm not a frequent cake baker but this recipe was fool-proof! (with the exception of the cooking-time) I doubled the recipe, baked in a 13x9 pan, cut in half and made into a layer cake with homemade strawberry jam in the middle. Topped it with chocolate frosting and decorated with strawberries. The slight changes I made were, per other reviewers, increased the amount of cocoa a little, used apple cider vinegar instead of white, and almond milk instead of water and baked at 350'F for only 35 minutes. Even still, it probably should have come out at 30 minutes, it would have definitely been burned by 45.

Quick, simple, and tasted delicious. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and replaced half of the vanilla extract with almond extract. It tasted great even without any frosting, nuts, or sprinkles added.

I'll definitely be using this recipe again in the future.

My son has a dairy and egg allergy. I made these for his birthday and frosted with Duncan Hines whipped chocolate frosting which didn't have milk. I made cupcakes and the only changes I made was doubling the cocoa and adding 1/2 cup of vegan chocolate chips. My 4 yr old loved them as did I! It was really like the real thing, no joke!

Delicious...Delicious...Delicious...no one ever believes me when I say it is vegan.  The recipe is perfect as written, but I do tend to use about 1/2 cup more of cocoa powder, a little over 1/3 cup of oil and 1 tbs. vanilla...don't hesitate to make this it is scrumptious!!!

I made this for my 2 y.o niece as a trial birthday cake since she is allergic to egg. I followed the recipe, substituting white sugar for cane sugar, APF for unbleached white flour, and vegetable oil for olive oil. 

Everyone loved the flavor, but thought it was a little dry (hence 4 stars instead of 5). I only cooked in the oven for 40 minutes and if I had gone the full 45 this would have been burned. Perhaps the author of the recipe is in a higher elevation and 45 minutes was appropriate for them. My elevation only being, 1,243 I will try this again and start testing doneness at 30 minutes. I may even add a TBS or two of applesauce for added moisture. 

I served this frosted with a chocolate glaze recipe found on a different site, raspberry sauce found here on Allrecipes, and homemade whipped cream sweetened with agave. My husband isn't really a chocolate on chocolate guy and really appreciated the raspberry sauce to break things up. 

My niece had never had cake before, due to her allergy, and kept asking for "more pancake please" while she was grasping toward the bowl that was out of her reach with her cake in it. It was really cute!

It tastes really good, don't get me wrong but even with very well greased muffin cups and waiting for them too cool completely they were next to impossible to get out without ruining. Too bad because they are tasty.

I doubled the recipe and used two 9 inch round bans.  I baked for 35 minutes and it was a little dry/over baked.  Still awesome and my grandma liked it (who I made it for!)

These are very yummy.  1 recipe makes 12 cupcakes.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and subbed balsamic vinegar for white vinegar and this came out beautifully.  Baked in cupcake tins for 23-25 minutes.

Very easy to make,  a nice texture similar to pound cake.  No frosting needed.  If nuts were added ( I would use walnuts) - it would be like a brownie.

I switched the flour to coconut flour, the oil to coconut oil, the vinegar to 1 TBS Balsamic Vinegar and the sugar to sugar in the raw.  Made cupcakes and frosted with a vegan mocha frosting.  YUM!

i absolutely LOVED this recipe!! i used it to make cupcakes for a friend's birthday and everyone complimented them. i ended up using 1/2 cup of cocoa instead of the 1/4 it called for and substituted the white vinegar for apple cider, since i'd run out. in the end, i only had 15 cupcakes, but the recipe could easily be doubled. and, like i've told all my friends, it's easy being vegan when you have amazing recipes like this one :)

Made this cake for a party. One of the girls was vegan for years and hasn't had cake in a long time. Everyone (especially her) loved it! Going to experiment using coffee instead of water...

Highly recommend this cake!

These were not good. I made them exactly according to the recipe, in muffin format however. They just didn't taste chocolatey enough or sweet enough. I'm very disappointed as I was excited to try a vegan recipe for the first time, but it definitely didn't work out.

This was great!  My skeptical husband was amazed that it could be so good.  It's slightly less moist than traditional cake but a little fluffier and not as sweet.  It really lets your frosting stand out so pick a good one.

EXCELLENT! So easy and so yummy!! I made it for a dinner party, specifically, for one guest who is vegan. I told her and no one else, and the only way the others believed me when I told them it was vegan, was when they saw her eating it!

This is the BEST cake or cupcakes I have ever eaten/made! This is a MUST have recipe! Ditch all of your other recipes and use this one. Worked perfect the first time making it, and not to mention it is easy!

So good! I wanted a three-layer round cake, so I made a double batch and then another single batch (because a triple-batch wouldn't have fit in my mixer). I used three 9" round cake pans, and the cake came out beautiful and so delicious! I made the (accidental) mistake of putting super-sweet frosting on it, though; the cake is decently sweet by itself, so your frosting doesn't need to go overboard.

Oh, my. This recipe and I do not get along. I loved that this recipe was vegan, but it's just not happening. I've made this cake in cupcake form three different times, and each time they flop. I tried them back in February, and they were just for myself and my husband so it wasn't a big deal that they didn't come out perfect. However, trying to make them for a dinner party, it'd be nice if they wouldn't stick. I baked them in liners, and they just stuck to the liner. Totally inedible. Third time, I used my commercial baking pan, greased the individual cups, and they still stuck. I adjusted temperature, baking time, everything. Not sure if it has to do with the fact that I'm up 6,000 ft, but I don't have time to mess with it anymore. Tastes great, so maybe better for an actual cake. But cupcakes were a dud :-/

I made this for a dinner party.  One friend vegan, others were non-vegan.  Everyone really liked it.  I made in in the loaf pan.  Served it with Vegan "ice cream" for some and Vanilla ice cream for others.   I also used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup coffee to bring out the chocolate flavor.   The cake is very moist, and very tasty.  You would never know it's made without eggs or milk.

I don't like chocolate cake, but this was great!  I used whole wheat flour, replaced the sugar with 3/4 C agave nectar (this gives it a slightly weird aftertaste, but good for people concerned about spikes in blood sugar), and added a teaspoon instant coffee to the 1 C of water.  Next time I will replace the oil with applesauce to make it even more healthy.  I love eating cake without feeling guilty!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe makes the most perfect cupcakes!!! I made this recipe as listed with the exception of twice the amount of cocoa, and used the "buttercream" frosting one reviewer suggested. I made the recipe and I can still hardly believe they're vegan!! An absolute must for any vegan's recipe book!

This cake is awesome and much better than any of the store bought vegan cakes I've purchased.  It's light and moist and not dense the way so many vegan cakes turn out.  No one will even suspect it's vegan.  Look no further for a vegan chocolate cake recipe.  I even tried the variation one of the reviewers mentioned and made this into a banana bread.  Yum!  I've made it three times and my two year old keeps asking me to make it again.

Okay, my husband has been looking for the "perfect" chocolate cake since he had a vegan chocolate cake in Ashville, NC at the Chocolate Lounge. I have tried many different recipes but to no avail. Then I found this one. Voila!! I hit the jackpot. I did increase the cocoa to 1/2 cup and used balsamic vinegar instead of white. Delicious and soooo easy. He gave the last piece to a client today and I am making another one tonight for a lunch he is attending tomorrow. It's a hit! Thanks!!

I used this recipe to make German chocolate cupcakes for my mom's birthday (she has dairy and egg allergies).  I used coffee instead of water and everyone approved- even though it was all vegan.

I make this for a friend who is allergic to eggs, it's perfect! I have substitued agave nectar for the sugar once and I like it better with the agave, seems more moist to me. I also like it substitued with brewed coffee for the water - results in deeper flavor, but you can't taste the coffee.  Yummy chocolate cake!

AMAZING!!!!!! By far, the best recipe i have ever made in my entire life. I brought this into my class and everybody devoured them! I took some vegan frosting i found at the grocery store, mixed in some cayenne pepper and banana, and OH MY GOD!!! It sounds crazy, but trust me. I got a bunch of high school jocks to eat them and they went nuts. Of course, i didnt mention the fact that they were vegan til after they ate it:)

As is, this is pretty good, not excellent but good. I'd also recommend adding more chocolate, maybe 1/2 cup instead of 1/4. It wasn't as chocolate-y as I'd like it to be.

I had no eggs in the house and was dying for some chocolate cake.  When I read the reviews I was skeptical that this cake would actually be any good.  I cannot believe how fantastic it is!  So simple and so good.  This is my new go to chocolate cake recipe.

I made these into cupcakes for my (vegan) sister's bridal shower.  I topped these with a chocolate vegan frosting.  This was a winning combo...tasty, I couldn't tell they were vegan (a big plus for me).  The frosting was glossy and I had been hoping to pipe it, but ended up spreading it with a spoon since it was a little too runny to pipe.  Very tasty for both recipes.

This cake was really good! I made it for a visiting vegan family member and we all loved it. I took the suggestion of doubling the cocoa powder plus I added 3/4 of a cup of vegan chocolate chips. I topped it with the vegan frosting another rater gave the recipe for and it was a big hit. I would make this again.

I just finished baking this as cup cakes, and I gotta say it's pretty good! I however didn't have any vinegar...so I used an egg replacer.  I used two "eggs" though I think it would have been better to use one.  Using two left a weird after taste and coating in my mouth.  It is however my first time with egg replacer so maybe that's normal.   It was a bit dry.  I put it in for just 25 minutes on the cupcakes, so if you're planning to make cupcakes I'd check it after 15 - 20 minutes.    To make it more moist I'm going to whip up a quick dairy-free margarine vanilla icing :)   Been craving chocolate, thanks for the great recipe!!

Amazing! I've been testing cakes for a year now and this one is unbelievable.  I did add some chocolate chips but since they melt and are gooey it makes the bottom of the cake where they navigate to a bit hard to transfer out of the pan even after cooling.  I will make this cake many more times! Bravo!

These are awesome. I was craving cupcakes but had no milk or eggs on hand.  I was skeptical about these, but they turned out great. I would make these over the non vegan ones any day.

Loved it! We followed the recipe exactly (not vegans, just looking for lower fat) and it was great. We made muffins out of them following another reviewer's suggestion, and the only problem was they stuck a bit, even though we greased the tins well. Next time we will use muffin liners...and there WILL be a next time!

Very tasty. Very simple. I made ten cupcakes out of this, but they were a little over-filled, so it probably would have been better to make 12. About 20-25 minutes for cupcakes.

First, it is quite easy to get 'vegan' white sugar from a natural foods store or a place like Whole Foods/Wild Oats. It is even labeled vegan, so no worries about that.  Second, this is great with chocolate chips as the author suggests. It is ALWAYS best to work with a recipe that is originally rather than adapting a recipe to begin vegan . . . this is a great, simple base recipe!

Absolutely AMAZING!!! I made these cupcakes for an art project protesting animal abuse and everyone in the class LOVED them!  I cannot say enough good things about it!  Everyone, vegan or not, needs to give this recipe a try because it's a guaranteed winner!!!

I love this recipe. I use it for my kids' birthday parties because it allows all the kids to partake in the festivities (we have a lot of friends with dairy and egg allergies). It's so light tasting too so I don't feel guilty eating 3 cupcakes in one sitting...

Great, easy recipe that yields a moist, delicious cake every time.  I choose this recipe sometimes even when I'm not cooking for vegans, and then I sprinkle the top with butterscotch chips before putting it in the oven.  Not a thick layer of chips, by the way, just a nice, even sprinkle.

This recipe is good for single-layer cakes, but not as much for layer cakes and cupcakes. For layer cakes or cupcakes, I recommend this Vegan Chocolate Cake. It's really easy and low in fat!

I needed a vegan chocolate cake recipe because my DIL has become vegan and they were visiting over Christmas. I tried this recipe on my family they loved it. So I made it for my husband's family at Christmas without telling them that it was vegan, because they would have complained, and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. This one is definetly a keeper.

This cake is really good. And the ingredients are very flexible as well. I used agave syrup instead of sugar and regular white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar and it still turned out great. Very fluffy and moist.

This is a dessert that takes a getting used to.  I really like it but my husband doesn't.  It definitely tastes better the next day.  It's very simple to make and satisfies a sweet, chocolate craving.  I will make it again and make a frosting to go with it and them my hubby should like it.

This recipe worked out great! In my oven it only took 35 min, so you may want to watch the time. For an icing I tried two different methods - 1. boil 6 tablespoons soy milk (i found a french vanilla flavor), then add 6 ox of semisweet chocolate chips... 2. do the same thing with coconut cream (i found it in the store by the pina colada mix) instead of soy milk. The coconut cream version came out richer and thicker, without tasting like coconut (but it will definitely clog your arteries!)

I really liked this recipe as is but think it could be even better. It's really moist and stayed that way for a few days. I think I will add strong coffee for the water next time. Great cake fix when you have no butter and eggs in the house!!

This worked out great. I think next time I'll double the recipe for a layer cake, and add a bit more vinegar and baking soda to get it to leaven a bit more. Was dense and chewy, but rich and tasy.Very easy to make, though!

Great! I baked this in a 10" glass pie round and sprinkled chocolate chips and (non-vegan) m&m's on top.  Also, didn't have vanilla, so substituted 1/8 tsp. almond extract. Would've been good if I'd left out the cocoa as well and treated it as a vanilla cake.

I loved it: I used the rice flour method and applesauce instead of oil and got something that stuck a lot to the cupcake liners in the muffin pan. I will use the oil next time to make it more moist.  I also used a basic frosting with my mint leaves from my garden to create mint extract and a garnish. The chocolate cake and mint frosting made my boyfriend gobble this up!   thanks for a lactose free cake!

I loved this recipe and have made it several times. I took it to a baby shower and it was gone in no time!! I made only one change and that was adding 1/3 cup cocoa powder.  I tried my hand at vegan frosting. I mixed raspberry (seedless) jam, soy (stick) margarine & powdered sugar frosting.  I thought it complemented it well. I decorated with some berries.

Was thrilled to find this cake!  I have a vegan daughter and her birthday is TODAY I found this last night and made it for her birthday today.  WONDERFUL cake - moist and delicious.  As good or better than non vegan cakes, I think.  Next time I may just add chocolate chips too.  Ghirardelli semi sweet chips are vegan.  I used a heaping 1/3 cup of cocoa cause I wanted it chocolate-y.  I cut the baking soda to 3/4 tsp and used 1/2 c water and 1/2 c soy milk.  I frosted it with storebought white icing - many brands are vegan, just read the labels to be sure.  GREAT and I will be making this again, soon.

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe.  It's light and chocolately without being overly sweet.  Great with or without frosting.

Delicious! I used apple cider vinegar just for that little extra tang, and it was absolutely fantastic! Moist, dense, with a good crunch to the edges (I made cupcakes) and a nice soft middle. Try it with vegan peanutbutter and honey icing - it's great!

This was not good. At all. I don't know if it is supposed to be flat, rubbery and tasteless, but mine was. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a disaster. Sorry, Mom, for your birthday cake :(

I loved this recipe.  Moist and delicious.  I find too many vegan recipes involve a ton of obscure ingredients- this is nice and simple.    I did make a few changes to make it a little healthier.  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce, and added 1/2 tsp ginger to give it a little kick.    Also, in my oven at least, it was finished in under 40 minutes, so watch out that it isn't overcooked.

I'm not a huge chocolate fan but this is the most awesome cake I have ever made.  When I bring it to work or to friends, they always want the recipe.  And' it's super easy and always turns out.  I always make it in an 8x8 inch pan....except when I make cupcakes.  ;-)

This was AWESOME. I made the recipe as cupcakes for a friend's party (he can't eat dairy), and it turned out so good, I made some for my boyfriend a few nights later. I don't think anyone could tell they were vegan.  Since the guy who can't eat dairy doesn't like icing, I made buttercream frosting (from the Carrot Cake III recipe on this site, without the pecans), and the cupcakes were a definite hit and some of the best I've ever had. Thank you!

I made this recipe as cupcakes (drizzled with chocolate rum sauce) for an office birthday party, as I didn't want a vegan colleague to be left out. Everyone loved them! Even my husband (one of the biggest carnivores on the planet) enjoyed these. Highly recommend - moist & tasty! Will definitely bake these again.

YUMMY! These were so amazingly good! I made caramel frosting that didn't turn out too well, but the cake definately saved it! It held onto the paper cupcake liners a little too well, but it was so good! It reminded me of a sponge when I looked at it, but the taste and consistency don't lie! This is a keeper!

made this in cupcake form! i put dark chocolate squares in the centre and it was sooo good!  the batter seemed too heavy and sticky, though, like bread dough. perhaps too much baking soda?  will make again, but modified with less b soda and more chocolate.

Holy bananas, batman. This recipe is EXCELLENT. I made cupcakes, the batter made 12 nice sized cupcakes. I baked them for 25 minutes and they came out soft and delicious. I added vegan chocolate chips and they were to die for. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these into cupcakes for a picnic we had with my vegan aunt, and everyone loved them! I baked them at the same temperature for 30 minutes. Cupcake liners are necessary-they stick otherwise, even with greasing the cups.

Delicious cake! Better than store-bought ones! My cake got burnt so I think I would bake it at 150 deg C in my convection oven the next time in my grease paper-lined non-stick cast iron loaf pan.

I am not vegan but have a niece and nephew who are lactose intolerant.  These were surprisingly good.  Everyone liked them, even my kids who don't have this problem.  I didn't change the recipe at all.

Best vegan chocolate cake I have tried yet!

Sooo yummy with the vegan vanilla butter icing. All of my non vege, and non vegan friends love these (I make them into a batch of 6 large muffins). I'm always getting requests from friends to make more.

The Egg-Free, Dairy-Free, Nut-Free Cake on this site is almost identical (using 1 Tbsp vinegar instead of 1 tsp).  I often make half a recipe for a batch of 8 cupcakes (bake for 20-25 min and use 2 1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil).  I've also made 2 batches of the recipe to make a two-layer 9" round cake.

This recipe is fantastic, especially for cupcakes as suggested.  I baked the cupcakes for 20-22 minutes at 350 and they came out perfect.  They cooled in no time so that they could be frosted before bedtime!  I added 1 tsp of instant espresso (or strong coffe as suggested)for added depth of flavor.  Make these!  Vegans be mindful: it's true that most processed sugars aren't truly vegan, but vegan sugars are available-try Whole Foods!

This is the same recipe that my mom has been using since the 60's.  My nephew is allergic to eggs and just loves this cake.  Sometimes we frost it with powdered sugar sprinkled on top othertimes we just use a simple icing recipe to frost.  We all enjoy this cake.

This cake was outstanding!!!!  Our son wanted cupcakes intead of a cake for his birthday, so we adjusted the cooking time to 22 minutes as another viewer posted, and they came out perfect!  We used store-bought frosting that was accidently vegan, and one adult at the birthday party asked if we'd used a devil food's cake mix and my husband just smiled and said, "Nope, they're homemade" :)  We won't be using boxed mixes ever again!

So easy with the simplest of ingredients.  I've made this 3 times and it has come out so consistently moist and not too sweet each time.  I like to add chocolate chips for little bursts of deeper chocolate flavor.   I can start and get it in the oven while my baby takes her nap!

I bake this in a pretty bundt/tube pan so it bakes more evenly and I ice it with confectioner's sugar dissolved in a little water and almond extract and drizled over the top. I make it for both my Mom (vegan) and Mother-in law (celiac) on special occasions by using a mixture of tapioca flour, rice flour and potato flour, and it tastes great! Thanks so much for the recipe, it's become a standard on special occasions!

Great cake w/ nice texture. I'm not vegan and I really enjoyed it. I baked 12 cupcakes for 28 minutes at 350 degrees. I think I over baked them b/c the tops were kind of hard, however, they became soft again after sitting overnight and you would never have known. The liner pulled cleanly off the moist cake. I used slightly less than 1 cup of sugar and substituted almond extract for vanilla extract which I didn't have. Next time I'm going to try cutting the sugar a bit more and substituting applesauce for some of the oil. I would also want to try adding banana, zucchini or grated coconut and coconut extract to the recipe.

I recently had to bring dessert to a party, and I found out as I was getting reasy to bake that I didn't have any eggs or any money to buy them, so I found this recipe.  Aside from getting me out of a tight spot, it was delicious!  I also added a chocolate frosting in which I substituted the milk it usually calls for with water.  When I told everyone at the party that it was vegan, they didn't believe me, but they all loved it!

My family liked the cake, but i found it too brownie like, dense and weird... hard to explain. Im still in search for the perfect vegan cake. Thanks for the recipe though!

Wow. I thought I'd give this recipe a try because it's lower in fat than some of the higher-rated chocolate cake recipes. As many others have said, the flavor and texture completely defy the "vegan" stereotype.

This cupcake was not what I expected.  It didn't taste very chocolatey at all.  I made cupcakes, baking them for 20 minutes.  The texture and appearance are great!  Taste...Oh well.  Someone suggested putting on some frosting to sweeten them.

I made cupcakes and topped them off with cream cheese frosting and drizzled chocolate syrup over the frosting.  Amazing!!!

I don't know what went wrong but, this cake was so dry.....I was making it for a large group of kids so I doubled the recipe and put it in a jelly roll pan.
I am disappointed because it looks delicious but lacks flavour.
I also added soymilk in place of water and increased the cocoa so maybe my portions got a bit out.  

Maybe I will try it again in the original version.

I was surprised at how good this cake tasted without any eggs or dairy in it.  The texture was distinctly vegan, but it tasted fine.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe. At my small child's b-day party I baked this cake for myself and my sister who is also vegan and had a store bought cake, more people ate the vegan cake!

What a fab recipe! Sooo easy to make! All you need is one bowl and one fork. My vegan sister was in town so I decided to look up vegan recipes. This was so easy and yummy that I will definitely do again for myself. I made 12 muffins and cooked them for 22minutes (as another reader suggested) and they turned out perfect!

This was a great recipe.  I made it for my daughter's first birthday, who is allergic to milk.  It was great to find a tasty alternative.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, and it turned out wonderfully!  The only thing that I changed was that I made it into a dozen cupcakes instead.  I cooked them for 20 min at the stated temperature, and they were perfectly done.  What is great about this recipe is that it is comprised of staple ingredients that I almost always have on hand.  Also, it's not overly sweet, which is nice if you planning on icing the cake (which I did with an icing made of mostly powdered sugar, some cocoa powder, a little margarine, and enough soymilk to give the right consistency).  Definitely give these a try--they  're quick, easy, and tasty!

MOIST!!!  Mine fell apart, but that certainly didn't deter us from eating every bite.  Bubba licked the plate.

This was my first vegan experience, and it is a fabulous cake recipe for either a vegan or for someone who, like myself, finds themselves with no eggs in the house!  Now I always know I can make a great-tasting, rich chocolate cake with only pantry items.  We all loved it.

This was okay but not better than ok .I added walnuts and halved the cocoa .I put the cocoa in half the mixture and  make a kind of marble cake.I prefer a marble cake that has eggs in it though .

This cake totally rocks. It's nice and moist and goes well with a cherry compote I made (cook dried cherries with cherry cider, brandy, and sugar). MMM!

it had more of a bread-like consistency than a cake.  Not too good with chocolate.
