This recipe does not work.  Apparently 1 or more ingredients has been omitted.  There is insufficient liquid in the recipe to make a pie filling.  We you complete step 1, you have cookie dough, not pie filling.

This is a very very poor recipe! There is little to no liquid in here to make a pie, it turns into dough. Broke 2 spoons trying to fold in the flour. Stay away, you have been warned.

I should have listened to the other raters, but I thought I could save it. I melted the PB to be more of a liquid but the recipe is obviously faulted. There's just not enough liquid to make a pie and theres way too much sweeteners going in. I even tried adding milk and melted chocolate but it was still a big glob of dough.
