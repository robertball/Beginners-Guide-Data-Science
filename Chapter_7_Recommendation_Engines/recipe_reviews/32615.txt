Absolutely, positively what I was looking for!  I've been house bound by illness for more than 2 months and I miss my flavoured drinks!  The strong brewed coffee is mandatory for the complete taste! Will be making all the time! Thanx for sharing!

I used a stick blender to mix thoroughly and "froth it up." It turned out quite well. The recipe proportions result in a pretty sweet drink; that's great for my tastes, but I have reduced the condensed milk a little bit to satisfy my spouse. I see myself making these on a regular basis.

Wow! This is great. I saw the recipe and thought, ok so few ingredients. I made half the recipe and barely got any because my husband and son gulped it right down! I did not use the vanilla as we dont like flavored coffee. Dont let the simplicity of the recipe keep you from trying it. I'm brewing a pot of coffee right now so I can make this again.ie

You must try this recipe.  I made it without the vanilla and it was great.  It tasted exactly like the coffee one would get in a vietnamese restaurant.  I used Cafe Du Monde's Coffee and Chicory Blend.  This recipe beats Starbuck's anyday.  I gave it a 5 star in the kid department because all my friends are like kids and they all loved it.

Delicious!  I used fat free half and half and low fat sweetened cond. milk and it was great!  I used coffee that had already cooled so the sweetened milk didn't dissolve well (my fault) so next time I will use hot coffee to help it dissolve.  GREAT recipe!

Really enjoyed this drink Kate.  I usually order this in Vietnamese restaurants and now I know the secret....condensed milk.  I didn't use the vanilla and it tasted just fine.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  It tastes exactly like a cold, canned coffee drink I tried in Europe.  Coffee must be very strong though...otherwise it will be overpowered by the other flavors.

This stuff is amazing.....I forgot to add the vanilla the first time and it really didn't need it.  The second time I remembered and it was even better...I didn't think that was possible.  Thanks so much for posting.  Great on summer days when it is just too hot for a cup of coffee.

OOOOHHHHH MAN! This was great! Yes, like others I used fat free sweetened condensed milk, but come on now, lets all read the back of the can with the calories and the serving amount, you know what,  WHO CARES, go an extra mile tomorrow! It is so worth it.  I was so full just after a half a glass. My husband was very happy to finish it off for me.

Oh goodness is this recipe wonderful!  I'm not a huge coffee fan but made this four times the first three days after I found the recipe.  I've made it with whole milk, too, with good results but the half and half is really, really good.  I made some for myself and my sister-in-law and we had some left over so we just refrigerated it and had it with breakfast the next morning.

I liked this drink. I didn`t use vanilla extract and reduced sweetened condensed milk and the drink was perfect. Something similar you can get in South European restaurants.

Delicious! This was my first time brewing coffee at all, let alone making an iced cappuccino. It's sooooo yummy! The only change I made besides using hazelnut coffee was to use almond milk instead of half-and-half since I didn't have the latter. The condensed milk really makes it wonderful, though! Sorta reminds me of the cappuccino frio I would get in Rome a few summers back...though they brewed their coffee/espresso just right and it was creamier^_^

Very good! It's sweet, but it stillhas some coffee flavor in it. It has the same effects as coffee, though. You can still get jittery and sick, but it tastes way better than plain coffee. I love it anyways! You can add different coffee creamer flavors like hazelnut or butter cream to give it a different taste. Amazing recipie!

This was incredible! Much cheaper than Starbucks... I did not have half and half so I just used regular old milk. I also added some ice cubes.

Really Good! I used strong coffee but I bet making espresso for it would be way worth it. I felt it was just slightly too sweet, so I added a little extra coffee. I still gave it 5 stars because my first thought was "I have to make this for guests!" and also because I would not have thought of the sweetened condensed milk, which is key. I liked it hot too, before I poured it over crushed ice. Second time I made it with cold coffee (regular strength, just leftovers), used a stick blender to blend chopped ice, put the cold s.c.milk in and blended, then just winged it with fat free 1/2 & 1/2, vanilla, splenda and cold coffee until I felt like it tasted like a frappucino. Delicious and easy!!!

I LOVE this recipe!!  Now I don't have to pay $4 for one anymore.  I use fat free everything but no one can tell.  I drizzle caramel inside my glass add ice and pour.  I top with whipped cream and drizzle more caramel on top.  Everyone loves this drink!!  Thanks for the recipe!

It was good, just the right amount of Sweetened condensed milk.  I think I'll have to try it with even stronger coffee next time.

DELISH!!  Even with fat-free sweetened condensed milk, it tasted great.  I can't wait to try it using low fat milk.  For those wondering, I brewed 1 1/2 cups water in my coffee maker with almost 1/4 cup ground coffee.  Tastes just like the bottled Frappucino's!

I doubled the recipe, because I made it for more than just myself.  By doubling it, I was able to get about three glasses of the drink.  I did not change anything else and we all loved it.  If anything, you will just want to make a bigger batch in case anyone wants more!  I brewed the coffee strong, just like suggested by another review, and I really think that is what made it so good.  But like I mentioned, the only thing I would change is to make more of it...

I do not like coffee, unless it has lots of sugar and cream or creamer.  I like Starbuck's Frappuccino's, as well as Starbuck's in store creations (the sweet ones, anyway).  That said, to me, this recipe was too sweet.  I suggest anyone making this the first time cut back on the SCM and gradually add more to their taste.

Wow, this is sweet! I had a little sweetened condensed milk I found in the freezer and found this recipe to use it in. I scaled the recipe to one serving. I mixed the ingredients in the cup with an aerolatte and then poured them over the ice. I filled the glass all the way with ice using about 8 ice cubes. It tasted better as the ice started to melt and it was less sweet. My self personally, I would probably still share a serving because of the amount of sugar. This does taste like the kind of ice cold coffee drink that one might get at a donut shop sweet and creamy.

Truly the perfect summer treat! You must use hot coffee so the sweetened condensed milk will blend in with the coffee.  :)

Great taste! Some may find it too sweet, I doubled the amount of coffee I used and drank it warm. I would just suggest tasting and seeing how much coffee is right for you. The recipe is simple and easy enough to do so.

..this was good.  I ended up using the last of my regular coffee so don't think it was quite strong enough.  By the time I finished it was really watered down..might throw it in the blender next time.

This was pretty good...but not worth the effort in my opinion.  I have an espresso/cappucino maker and making a shot of espresso and mixing it with milk, sugar, and ice gives you nearly the same flavor (frozen coffee cubes are great to use in these frozen drinks, too!  And mixing in chocolate or caramel syrup is superb.)  And I don't think this made 3 servings, either, maybe 1 1/2.

This is delicious. I was looking for a recipe that didn’t require a blender. I only use half the amount of condensed milk it calls for and it’s plenty sweet

Oh my goodness! I forgot the vanilla but didn't even notice it.  I did sprinkle some Hersheys syrup on top.  I think I will cut the condensed milk in half next time as it is very sweet but it was pretty awesome as is!

I love trying new ways of making coffee drink this had good flavor.

Freezing coffee in ice cube trays, the coffee cubes keeps the coffee drink from watering down. Happy Cooking!

I didn't want to go to the store before I had my coffee, so instead of half and half I used French Vanilla coffee creamer (the same amount) and threw out the vanilla. It was great :)

This recipe is great! It taste just like the expensive Starbucks Frappuccino. I did make a couple changes, I doubled the recipe and then doubled the coffee. It gave it the stronger coffee taste that I like. I didn't have any 1/2 & 1/2 cream so I used 2% milk and added some flavored instant creamer. It worked out great!
