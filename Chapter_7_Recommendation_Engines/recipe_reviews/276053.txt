I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey for this and it was delicious! There was a recipe problem though. I made the sauce according to this recipe with 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup of mayo. Those measurements are WAY off. It should probably use only a few tablespoons of milk, as the picture looks like it should be a dressing consistency. By the time I added enough mayo, ranch dressing mix, and salsa to get the right consistency and flavor, I had over 2 cups of sauce. I recommend mixing the mayo, salsa and ranch dressing mix first, then add a little milk at a time until you get the desired consistency. Other than that, the kids and I loved it.
