Recipe was okay but would DEFINITELY omit the cloves.  They were WAY TOO overpowering and ruined it.  Sorry I rated it so low but like I said the cloves ruined the whole recipe.

Added onion, garlic from a jar, pepper and water. Very good and great use of leftover chicken. Added sour cream to it right before serving. Served with tortilla chips. Thank you.

Very yummy and easy! I added corn so I could sneak in more veggies for my husband. These servings are pretty large, I made half a batch and that fed 2 people for 2 meals. Only 4 stars because the hubby said it could use a little more spice. I added 1/2 t of garlic salt as well. Even better the second day! Have fun with the toppings!

Everyone liked this recipe! It was great and tasted like chili! I probably will add a little more spiciness to it but it tasted good just the way it was. Thanks.

Very simple and easy to prepare. I added some minced fresh garlic, black pepper and a little seasoning salt. Also, added more broth.

The cloves were a little overwhelming.  I think I'll either use less or substitute chili powder instead.
