I made this with a pork roast that was a little less than 2lbs. and used a recipe from this sight for the Greek seasoning.  The flavors were delicious. I didn’t cook it quite long enough in the instant pot so had to finish it off in the oven, which I think was the reason the pork wasn’t as tender as I had hoped. I am still getting use to my instant pot. I will definitely try this again.

I did make this again and have increased my rating to 5 stars.  I used apple juice because I had it and we love the flavors. This time I trusted my Instant Pot and followed the directions and it was tender and delicious.

I was lucky and it  cooked to 140 degrees and came up to 145 after resting. As suggested I used chicken stock which made for a great gravy. A good sear is important for flavor.

Making this now for a friend, in a slow cooker. Used extra seasoning. Used regular cider, not hard.Added onion, a bag of carrots and 1/2 cup brown sugar, to enhance the cider taste.

This was okay, the sauce was delicious! I used chicken stock as recommended in the notes. Check the temperature of the pork after removing it from the instant pot. The temperature should be 145F and might need additional cooking time like mine did. If you need to cook the pork linger add it back to the instant pot for 5-8 minutes of pressure cooking then release the pressure quickly, check temperature & repeat if necessary.

This was fantastic! I used a wild boar tenderloin and followed all the steps. The Greek seasoning I used, I made following a recipe from this site. The flavors were amazing and the instant pot made it all so easy!
