This is the best hummus ever---actually I have never liked traditional hummus before.  This version is very healthy/low-fat with no olive oil.   I often use a fresh roasted red pepper instead of those in a jar.   I first grill the red pepper and blacken the skin (you can also do that under the broiler) then peel off all the blackened skin and remove seed then throw the pepper in the food processor with the rest of the ingredients. 

UPDATE - Made this even better...delete the parsley and the salt and add a large clove of garlic and about a dozen kalamata olives (pitted of course!) and about a tbsp. of the brine that the olives come in!  EVEN MORE FABULOUS and a good way to get healthy red peppers, beans and olives all in one dish!

I was super surprised by this! Beautiful flavor combo with the perfect amount of heat. I added 1 clove of garlic, because I adore garlic. I also made mine in the blender and needed to add a little liquid to get it moving. I added 3 TBS of water and 2 TBS of olive oil. It was beautiful and smooth and made a very generous amount of hummus. Thanks for a fantastic 5 star recipe!  I also tossed with hot pasta for a delicious entree!

Very tasty; thank you for posting. The only tweaking was to add a tablespoon of tahini (from grounds sesame seeds), garlic to taste and to reduce the lemon to two tablespoons. The result, simply DELICIOUS!

Wow! I love hummus and have eaten a lot of it...but this has to be one of the best that I have not only eaten, but made as well.  And I must admit, it was my first attempt at making hummus. I decided to try three varieties and this would be my favorite.  Highly recommend.

Delicious and so simple to make! To decrease the amount of fat, I used reduced fat feta cheese and halved the amount. I also omitted the fresh parsley because I didn't have any. With all these changes it was still very tasty. Thanks Valerie, this is a keeper!

I don't know what I did wrong, but this definitely needed olive oil and tahini. Mine was way too thick & hot. I'll stick to buying my hummus from now on.

Made just the way the ingredients are listed, the feta flavor was really overwhelming.  I had toa dd more roasted red peppers to balance it out and I think next time I will start with about half the feta and taste and add from there.  Once I balanced out the feta though it was great!

This is the first hummus recipe that I have made myself...and I loved it!  Very flavorful.  Next time I would probably use a little less lemon juice than the recipe recommends.

YUM!!! Didn't have roasted red peppers in a jar so grilled a large red pepper and used that, I think the consequence was that it is a bit soupy,,, but very delicious.  Thank you!  I have to say, it really really bugs me when people change a recipe then rate it less than 5 stars.....

This is really good! I was a little worried at first, but when I got it out the next day to snack on, the flavors had married nicely with just enough heat to make it really interesting! Yum! It was a hit with everyone who tried it!

YUM!  Made it just as written, except used dried parsley (I don't ever buy fresh because we don't like it) and added a clove of garlic.  I also saved the bean juice, and ended up adding a few tablespoons to get the consistency I wanted.  First time I made it, we were blown away!  The second time, I forgot to add garlic... and we were sorely disappointed.  It is not NEARLY as good without it... so make sure to add garlic and you will have a 10-star recipe! :o)

I was inspired by this recipe - made it w/ container of feta, can of beans, 1 jar of peppers, squeezed 1/2 lemon, handful of parsley and about 4 cloves of garlic. Put in the Cuisinart with some olive oil drizzled... took it to a party and they couldn't get enough. These were garlic loving people and this really turned out like a spruced up version of aioli. Fabulous! Thanks for the inspiration!

This was a little too sweet for our tastes and the red pepper was a little too overpowering.  Not bad though overall.

Not bad base...but I agree with some other ratings I read about this recipe.  Needs olive oil, tahini, & a bit of fresh garlic .  I only used 1 tbls. lemon.  And I would keep the feta on the side to eat with the pita chips!  I didn't even attempt to add the feta to the mix.  I used a jar of roasted red pepers in olive oil and used the oil from the jar.  These additions will give this recipe a smoother texture and a better red pepper flavor.

This was very good with the following changes.  I used only half the cayenne pepper, added some olive oil and garlic powder.  I served this with some homemade pita chips.

I cut this hummus in half and roasted the rest of the can of chickpeas. I used 1/2 a fresh red bell pepper because thats what I had. I added a little water because I don't like my hummus thick. This was so good, I will never buy the red pepper hummus in stores again. That feta just makes it to die for.

I added 3/4 tbl of tahini and 1/2 tsp of cummin - makes all the difference.  Tastes more authentic.

I've never found a hummus recipe that I liked, so mine is always store bought. Not any more! Based on other reviews, I added fresh chopped garlic, black olives, a touch of olive oil, and just because it was on hand, fat free feta with tomato and basil. Put it all in the food processor and voila! Very tasty! Will be saving a ton of $ by making my own from now on! Thanks, Valerie!

Yum! I made it according to the recipe minus the parsley (didn't have any!) but this was so good.  I never would have thought to make my own hummus but I will make my own from now on, it was so good!  I got an immersable blender for Christmas which made making this so easy.  Even my DH shared some with me, and he has texture issues and refuses anything with a bean texture but he really enjoyed this too.

I did not even know what hummus was until my grown daughter let us try a store bought version.  It was ok, grainy but ok.  I recently bought a new blender and wanted to make my own version.  I started with this recipe, I did not have tahini or a jar of roasted peppers, so I microwaved two small red peppers, added basil tomato feta, sun dried tomatoes, dried basil and hot sauce (instead of cayenne pepper).  It was so creamy and delicious!  My 5 yr old mowed it down, thank you for sharing!

Yummy & Easy...oh, and very healthy too considering the protein of the garbanzos, the unique vitamins in red peppers and the lowfat dose of dairy in the feta - CHEERS!

I have been making hummus for many years.  This was a nice change.  I'm not sure which is better, as they both have such different flavors.  I did have to add a bit of water so that it was a smooth consistency.  I served with warmed pitas and fresh veges. Will be making again.

Very good! Easy to tweak as you're whirling it in a blender---adding a little of this and that as you go along. I did end up adding olive oil and garlic.

Big hit, guests that never had hummus all raved about it.  My mods were to add 2 tbsp. of EVO, 3 cloves of garlic, 4 scallions and cut back the feta to 1/3 cup.  I'm getting requests to make more already!!!

Feta adds unnecessary amounts of sodium and fat.  Hummus is usually a healthy dip.

Delicious and easy!!! I didn't have any cayenne so I substituted red pepper flakes instead also used low sodium beans to try and make it healthier.

I made the recipe as is and it was delicious and so colorful!  Just spicy enough for me.  Depending on the event, I may reduce the cayenne a tad.

This recipe is so quick and easy to make! Healthy too!!! We added a bit more cayenne because I like spicy. I was out of lemon juice so we used the juice from the pepper jar for liquid. It came out great!

This was probably the best homemade hummus I have tasted (and made!)  Nice consistency.  I followed the suggestion of one of the reviews and also added a clove or two of garlic.  Will definitely make again!

I love hummus and have been to many countries in the middle east that have amazing hummus.  Jordan being my favorite so far.  This was a great non-traditional recipe.  Only thing to odd might be some tahini.  Did not do much measuring besides the can of beans and cheese.  Just threw it in and used way more red pepper than called for as I like it spicy.  Very easy to make!

This was very good, however it was very salty! I would not add the salt next time because the feta cheese gives it enough flavor. I didn't put as much cayenne pepper in it as well. The people raved over it at the party I took it too.

I love this hummus and make it all of the time.  The things that I do different are that I add some of the garbanzo bean juice to it to help smooth it out and I added garlic and green olives.  I also use the reduced fat feta and can't tell a difference.  I keep it in the fridge for a snack with vegetables or pita chips.  Delicious!

I was super excited to try this recipe but was disappointed. Way to much Feta flavor - and I am a huge fan of Feta. I had to add garlic, more peppers, and EVOO to balance the flavors. I will try refrigerating overnight to see if that makes it taste any better.

This was good, but not my favorite dip. I actually baked this in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes and served it with tortilla chips and wheat thins. People thought it was good but unusual...I'll keep the recipe around for the next time I want something different.

This is the best hummus I have ever tried. This is the first time I prepare hummus. I tried it before in restaurants, but this one is way better. I always read the reviews, so I added 2 garlic cloves (we love garlic) and 1 tb olive oil, and used home-roasted red bell peppers. We (hubby and I) LOVED it. I will def make it again, and again, and again... And it's pretty easy to make. It only took me about 15 minutes (including roasting the red bell pepper).

a little too much feta for me.
roasted the red peper myself and i whole pepper almost seemed too much.  
it's really good, i think with a little tweaking to the right combination it will be great

I made this for a party and non hummous eaters LOVED IT! I will say that next time, I'll omit the additional salt because the feta adds what's needed. I also infused a couple of TBLSP of olive oil when processing it for added body and flavor. Great recipe!

Hummus should be made with olive oil for a smooth silky consistency.  Also try sesame seeds and a little garlic- this will really authenticate your hummus with more Mediterranean flavors. The cheese is a great addition

I would reduce the amount of feta cheese for my liking and watch the cayenne - overdoing it takes away from the taste of the hummus.

This is a wonderful hummus.  I did have to add the liquid from the garbanzos to get it to smooth out.  I used it to fill some wonton wrappers to use as a side dish for Chef John's Hawaiian-Style Ahi Poke recipe from this site.  It worked very well.

Doubled the amount of chickpeas, used 100g of feta, roasted peppers in oven. Probably would use more paprika next time. Also added few cloves of roasted garlic. It was good but not amazing.Possibly would add more lemon juice next time as well to give it more zing.

This will become a regular item in my fridge.  I have been buying Sabra Roasted Red Pepper Hummus for years & I finally decided to try making it myself.  Super easy but next time I will roast my own peppers & will probably try a variety of spices.  Excellent base recipe — perfect as is & I will try a variety of tweaks for something different.  Love this.

This is a tasty humus and a welcome change to the standard style of humus.  I omitted the salt due to the saltiness of the feta and it was still quite salty. It has a definite kick, so if you do not like spicy (hot) I would suggest you reduce the cayenne. Like others, I had to add tahini (1 1/2 T) and olive oil (3 T) to make a smoother constancy.

This was way too dry and impossible to blend.  I had to add olive oil and extra lemon juice just to get it to blend in the blender.  Hummus without olive oil is weird anyway . . .

Did not care for...to me there was a competition between the garbanzos and feta. I guess you could add lots more feta...but I did not bother.

This is excellent!  A word of caution, however, that there's a strong lemony taste to it which I happen to love.  Will add some garlic next time.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!  Edited addition - Made with 2 large garlic cloves, minced and 8 black olives i/o parsley and salt.  Very good!

Delicious.  Nice to have a recipe that doesn't need tahini. I used reduced fat feta, and had to add a little olive oil to get it to mix.  Will make again!

I didn't have the roasted red peppers, so I used 6 Hatch Green Chilies.  I also used one tsp of the Lighthouse Freeze-Dried Garlic, 1 T Tahini and added 2 chopped green onions at the end.  Delicious!

For breakfast I scrambled 2 eggs, put this Hummus on a FlatOut flatbread (Milti-grain w/Flax) and made a wrap.  Very good, low calorie and lots of fiber.  Give it a try!  Thank you for the recipe.  I will make it often.

This recipe is a fresh take on traditional hummus.  I made this hummus for some friends and they thought it was the best hummus they have ever had.  In the future I think I would maybe add some garlic.  Some advice...let the flavors set for a few hours (preferably overnight) before serving.

This recipe has great potential. I think there is too much feta.  It had an overwhelming feta taste! Next time I make this recipe I will add the feta by taste. I also added EVOO.

Great! I had neighbors over and they loved it!  The flavors really come out once the dip sets over night.

Definitely a very good recipe, I would only replace the bell peppers with red sweet peppers (florina peppers) and maybe add some sesame seed oil.
