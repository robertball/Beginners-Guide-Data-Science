I have made this recipe several times now, and has been a hit each time! It is easy to throw together, so anytime I need to bring a desert this is my first choice.

This recipe was so easy.  I enjoyed making as well.  The only thing I didn't really like is the fruit cocktail, so next time I'll replace it with Mandarin Oranges or more Cherry Pie filling.  Everyone at my party loved it too!

This was a good recipe to take with you o the go. It feeds a ton of people and it is great! I didn't use the fruit cocktail but it was still good. I will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't care for this nor did my 15 year old son.  I have had punch bowl cake before and loved it.  Not sure why this recipie didn't work for me.
