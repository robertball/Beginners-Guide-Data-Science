This has been my recipe for decades , minus the shallots and cilantro, I usually top them with cocktail shrimp, and make regular eggs for the ones that don't like horseradish, substituting it with sweet relish and top with a piece of bacon (the toppings are so everyone knows which is which ;) )

I had to leave out the cilantro-sorry.  I have someone in the family who won't touch anything with cilantro in it, but they were sure better than the regular deviled eggs we make-had some taste to them!

We thought this had way too much salt and mayonnaise in it. I made the mistake of not tasting the filling before putting them back into the egg whites or else I would have realized that these weren't going to be that great. I had one at dinner, my husband had two, and each of my boys had one, but we didn't really like the taste - too tangy and salty. So after dinner since we still had a lot left I took out the filling, added more mustard and horseradish to combat the mayonnaise taste, and added just a pinch or two of sugar to neutalize the saltiness. After all of that it tasted pretty good.

Just made this recipe for a baby shower, the filling is delicious. I will decrease the mayonnaise next time maybe to 1/2 cup. I thought it was a little too runny! The horseradish is so good in these!

This is a great recipe!  I decreased the mayonnaise, Dijon, horseradish, and shallots by half as per other reviews claiming this was I runny and they came out perfect!

I LOVED this!!
I didn't bother with cilantro, salt or shallots.
I didn't have dijon, used spicy brown mustard. 
EXCELLENT!

Great way to use up Easter eggs. Had to leave out the salt and cilantro but used some smoked paprika for flavour and color. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, but like many others have mentioned, too much mayonnaise, which made the filling too runny. Had a lot left over.

This isn't really a review of the recipe as written. Y'know, basically I don't measure the ingredients; I do it by guess and by golly, and a little tasting.  I don't think that I come anywhere close to 2 tbsp of horseradish, nor his/her quantity of mayo and mustard. HOWEVER, I do like the basic concept.
