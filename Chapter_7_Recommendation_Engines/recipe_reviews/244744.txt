This is a great dip - I always make the chicken buffalo dip and this is a nice refreshing variation with the taste of parmesan and garlic. I could not find Parmesan dressing, so I got Garlic Ranch and it was perfect. I serve this with Fritos and it is a big hit. Great for football Sundays!

I've now made this 2xs; first time I didn't have Parmesan dressing on hand so I used Light Ranch. Got rave reviews and recipe requests. Second time I used Parmesan ranch and it wasn't nearly as good- the flavor was kinda blah. If I had made it the first time as the recipe is written (with Parmesan dressing) I wouldn't give this a second chance. Now I know it needs to be made with straight Ranch dressing.

I followed the recipe as best I could with the exception of the salad dressing. I used Garlic Ranch because I couldn't find Parmesan. The dip was pretty good but too creamy IMO. Next time I'll cut back to 1 cream cheese. I'm going to use the leftovers for chicken enchiladas and I think they'll be amazing!

Everyone loved this! But I made it a bit different.
I used mozzarella and sharp white cheddar, omitted the vinegar, used Burmans parmesan wing sauce and parmesan peppercorn salad dressing, and used 2 cans of cooked chicken breast instead that I shredded so I could just throw it all in the mini crock pot and let it do the job. So good with pita chips

Pretty bland flavor, it needed something else.  I don't think I will make this again.

Recipe turns out GREAT!  Everyone always loves it and requests it again.  I added jalapenos without the seeds to give it a little extra flavor.  I couldn't find Parmesan salad dressing, but I got Sam's Choice Creamy Garlic Parmesan dressing at Walmart and it was amazing.

I would've given it 5 stars but I modified it. I used one 8oz cream cheese and half ranch half blue cheese dressing. I also baked it instead of using the slow cooker. Sooooooo good!

This was gone in two hours when I took it to work.   It is amazing!!   May try this with some seafood instead of the chicken.
