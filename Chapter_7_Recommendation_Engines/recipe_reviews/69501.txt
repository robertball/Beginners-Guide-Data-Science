I was a little intimidated by this recipe, but with one change, this recipe is not hard. The only change - I purchased blanched almonds. This reduced the time to prepare and bake them to under two hours. The dough is easy to work with, and did not stick at all to the metal tart molds. The orange blossom water makes this recipe, and it is important to add it to the dough and the syrup as well as the filling. I was really happy with the way these turned out, and wished I had made a double batch.

Even though preparation is lengthy by most standards, it is the best oriental sweet recipe that made it across the pond.  Thank you Hanaa.
