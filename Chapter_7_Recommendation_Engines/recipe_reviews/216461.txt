I used ground beef because I did not have sausage.  The flavor was good, but just as I suspected it was on the dry side.  It needs some sort of sauce or gravy to hold everything together.  I would like to try again using the sausage like the recipe states, but maybe use a little beef broth and flour or cornstarch to make a gravy.

I was really excited to try these so I guess I set myself high up for disappointment. They came out a little dry. They could definately benefit from some kind of sauce, maybe even just some diced tomatoes to add at least a little wetness.

This is a tasty way to make frozen pierogies a bit more fancy but I didn't follow this recipe too tightly. (hence the 3 stars)
I changed out mozzarella for gouda because I don't like mozzarella and only use about 5oz. Also took out mushrooms and sausage because people on my house don't eat either and subbed in onions and another seasonal veggie (have used carrots, green beans and corn all were good). Season mix is perfect!

I was looking for a way to use periogies differently then just frying them in butter. When I found this I knew it would be a hit with the family. With cheese and bell peppers, what could go wrong? I added extra bell peppers and we all decided that more cheese was need but that may just be my family. The spices were perfectly blended and it tasted very good. The sausage was different for us but when eaten with a bite of periogie it tasted much better!

I made this last night and I didn't think my kids could eat so much.  My 10 year old son had two huge portions and so did my daughter.  I had made a little more than was called for and there was not one bite left after dinner.  This will be a meal I will be making over and over again.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I made this recipe without the sausage and it was still delicious. It's very pleasing to the eye as well. Some reviewers on here say they boiled the piergoies instead of sauteing them but I don't recommend that. Boiling them makes them dough-y.

This is such a yummy, easy, relatively inexpensive recipe.  The recipe was wonderful as is, but I did make a few changes just based on personal taste and preference.  I made the sausage into meatballs because the hubby like a bigger bite.  I left out the mushrooms just because I'm not terribly fond of them.  And then I added a can of tomato sauce for no other reason then because I though it sounded good.  The finally result was so yummy!

Thought I would change up my usual recipe. This was a lot more work. I slice partially frozen kielbasa in a pan with a slivered onion and some butter. By then, the pierogies are partially thawed, throw those in, and course chop a tomato and add to pan (seeds, juice, n all).Bring to a slow simmer for about 15 minutes till pierogies are done. Serve with a dollop of sour cream.

I thought this was amazing. The kids not so much and ate the plain pierogies. (Keep in mind they eat them plain even when I make a red sauce to go on top) I used a packet of McCormick's pork gravy and a little water to add that gravy texture everyone else said it needed. Maybe next time I'll try beef gravy as it was a bit too much pork. I will definitely be making this the next time I make pierogies if only for myself, let the kids eat it plain...

definitively boil or microwave the perogies first; otherwise they take forever and may even burn the outside before the inside even thaws

Pierogies is one of our favorite dishes.  There are so many ways to use them and this was a good one.  I browned the sausage, peppers and onions but did skip the mushrooms.  The one change I make with pierogies, in all recipes, is to put them in a bowl of hot tap water to thaw.  After draining them, I browned them in the skillet without the olive oil.  I plated the pierogies first, topped with sausage mixture and added fresh diced tomatoes.  I then topped mine with a small amount of sour cream.  Served with homemade applesauce and 'Uncle White's Bread Machine Rolls' from AR.  We enjoyed a wonderful meal.  Thanks, ANGCHICK for sharing your version of pierogies.

This sounds great if you eat meat. When I make this, I will skip step one and boil instead of frying. 
I've always wondered what I could top my pierogies with and now I know! GREAT IDEA.

Great simple home cooked meal. I used all the ingredients (plus 2 chopped tomatoes) and sautéed the sausage 1st..then just added the veggies into pan once sausage was almost cooked through. Once veggies were softened I added maybe 1/2 cup or so of jarred pasta sauce. Poured that all into a bowl and sautéed the pierogie in 2 batches. Once they were semi done, put  them into a 9x13 glass pan and poured everything else on top. Added the cheeses and heated in over for like 10 minutes. Delicious! Same ingredients and basically same steps...but just couldn't fit it all in large cast iron pan. My belly is nice and full and the kids ate all their pierogie and sausage...and picked through the peppers and onions, since they are still very finicky with certain foods. We can call it polish ravioli!

This recipe has a homestyle throw together feel and taste. Its delightfully comforting and the seasoning blend is great! Its great that its a one pan meal and overall doesnt require much effort or attention. I used spinach feta stuffed which seemed appropriate. Wife was quite happy with the dinner which earned it an extra point. Thanks for offering some new ideas for pierogies!

not impressed, made it with spicy sausage and fresh sautéed mushrooms along with the peppers and suggestion spices.  Thawed the pierogies  by running hot water over them before frying.  Just didn't think it was that good.  Needed sour cream.

Comments mentioned that this meal was a bit on the dry side - so decided to add Just a little favorite sauce from a jar. It was delicious - loved the sausage, peppers, mushrooms, onions and of course the pierogies. My husband has said this is a definite make again recipe.

A favourite recipe of mine! 
I make it slightly differently every time, depending on what ingredients I have (or how badly I burn the sausages). Every time, it's great.

Maybe some sauce would make this a four or five for me. Was more than edible and I may try again, but not rotation worthy as is IMO.

Loved this and so did the family. Used hamburger instead and to stop it from being dry I put a can of diced tomatoes in. YUMMMY. I also used cheddar cheese instead. It all went... No leftovers!

It was nice to have a new way to make pierogies.  I did boil them as many others suggested. I used a little of red, orange and yellow peppers instead of the green(not a fan of green peppers). It was a good meal, but it was a bit dry.....it definitely needs a sauce.

This is a easy simple dinner, You change this dish easily with what you  have on hand. I the seasoning mix is very good. Either boiled or pan fryed pierogies are good. I sauteed onions and zucchini then added the pierogies then topped with mozz. cheese until melted.

I made this the other night for my husband, my sister, and her boyfriend.  The flavor of the spice combination is wonderful and I got nothing by rave reviews on this dish!  The only thing I changed was that I used turkey sausage (that's what I had on hand) and to omit the mushrooms (I didn't have any at home).
