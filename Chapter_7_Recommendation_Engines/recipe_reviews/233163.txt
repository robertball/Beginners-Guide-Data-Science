I've made this recipe ever since I've been married - 53 years!.  I like to sauté the chopped onions (time allowing) to just past being soft and I prefer the bacon just short of crispy.  I usually use Campbell's Pork & Beans.  Many years ago I made pork & beans from scratch.  Let me tell you, they weren't any better and not
worth the effort.  I'll have to try the the liquid smoke addition.  Lillian

Made this for a pot luck at work and everyone loved them. I used Heinz pork and beans with molasses. I quadrupled it to feed about 30 people. I baked tham the night before them let them sit overnight in the fridge then reheated in the slow cooker. Very easy to make and delicious!

these were amazing! they were so easy to make. I mixed them up the day before I  baked them. I used a cheap store brand of pork & beans and followed the directions exactly. I baked mine for 1 hr (everything else was done & had to take them out). they still had a little soup but were so good! i'll be using this recipe again & again!

Since there are only 2 of us, I used an 11oz can of baked beans and halved all the other ingredients.  I didn't do my bacon to a "crisp" cook, as we like our bacon in beans to be meaty & chewy.  I also took "Oldhippe's" advice and added a squirt of ketchup and some liquid smoke. I baked them covered for 1 hour, and then uncovered for the last half hour.  They were awesome!  Thanks for sharing!

I didn’t use pork and beans just because I didn’t have them on hand. I used Zarqa beans. The best baked beans we’ve ever had.

Did sauté the onions, added a squirt of Sweet Baby Rays, and used slow cooker instead of oven because of the heat...fantastic!

Better than Bush's, according to my roomie! I didn't measure very carefully but I used a generic can of pork n beans, 3 strips of bacon, 2 T brown sugar, a shake of Liquid Smoke, about 1T each of ketchup and mustard, the stated Worcestershire sauce, and minced dried onions. It was a bit tangy and not too sweet! We loved it, with my changes!

This recipe is the closest I've seen to my mom's recipe that she had made my whole life! (And I'm 38!) Only she used BBQ sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce, and added she didn't precook the bacon, but laid the raw  bacon strips on top the beans and let them cook in the oven. The trouble with that, obviously, is everyone would fight over who got the bacon! :P After while, she would cut the bacon into pieces so everyone got a bit of bacon. Then one time, she was making her baked beans and realized she had no bacon, so she tried substituting the bacon with slices of Hillshire Farm Polska Kielbasa... everyone loved it more than the bacon! So that became her new recipe, and every function she made it at, church potlucks, family get-togethers with her side of the family, dad's side of the family or with my sisters... there was never any leftovers!!!
