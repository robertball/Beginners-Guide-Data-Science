This is such a light and refreshing dressing.  It was perfect over spinach with strawberries.  I made this for an office luncheon and everyone loved it.

06-12-16 ~ I had a lot of fresh organic raspberries to use up. This recipe was a delicious place to use some of them. I didn't whisk the ingredients, I put all the ingredients in my MagicBullet and whirled away. It was delicious on a fruited / vegetable salad that I took to our Pastor's going away luncheon. I would definitely make this recipe again.

Quite tasty. I substituted olive oil for the avocado oil, and used garlic-infused rice vinegar in addition to the one fresh clove. Thanks for this recipe!

It was time consuming to get the raspberry seeds out of the fruit but worth it!

This was really good, I was looking for a whole30 compliant dressing so I left out the sugar and increases the raspberries to 1 cup. We loved it

I didn't have avocado oil or raspberries so I substituted olive oil and Alaskan blueberries. As Our Alaskan blueberries tend to be quite tart, I also added an extra teaspoon of sugar and just blended it all together. Very yummy- I can't wait to try it with the proper ingredients!!
