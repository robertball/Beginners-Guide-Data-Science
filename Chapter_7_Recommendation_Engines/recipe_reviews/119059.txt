Great receipe!  I did some adjusting.  I used 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of 1% milk, 1 cup of 2% cheddar and 1 cup of mozzerella, and no onion.  I also sprinkled a little extra cheddar cheese on top before I put it into the oven.  There!  Perfect! 1 pie for the family and 1 for the couple two doors down (she had knee surgery last Thursday!)  Easy, quick, great comfort food!  Thank you for the receipe!!!

I love this recipe and they really freeze well.  I recently changed it around a little to make it a little healthier.  I used egg beaters that are ham and cheese flavored in place of the eggs and I used skim milk in place of the half and half, was very tasty.

My husband requested quiche for dinner, so I went in search of a recipe. I found this one, and it's a keeper! I added more onion, basil, garlic powder and crushed red pepper. I baked in a quiche dish, and used Crisco's double crust recipe. Thanks for sharing!
I made this again, and changed it up a bit. I added sauteed green & red bell pepper, along with onion and garlic. I also added fresh roasted green chiles. This was over the top. My kids even loved it...and that's saying alot! I'm looking forward to making this again.

We enjoyed this recipe as is, but, will probably tweak it a little to our taste.  I will probably add some green onions and swiss cheese next time.  I did follow other reviewers tips and cooked at 375 instead of 400.  I had no problems with my crust burning at that temperature.  10/13/08 Just a note - I made this again with a few changes.  I sauteed some green pepper and onion and added it on top of the ham layer (I used leftover pinic ham I cut up in chunks).  I also used swiss cheese this time.  It was really good and still great the next day.

Again, like others have said, this is a wonderful basic recipe to change with personal preferences. I sauteed two onions then added 1 tsp of sugar and 1 T of balsamic vinegar and put the mixture in the bottom of the pie shell with the cubed ham.  Also added 2 tsp. dillweed and a dash of half sharp paprika to the egg/milk mixture. After the initial 400 degree shell baking, I reduced the oven to 375, so crust didn't burn.  Delicious! I did bake both, and put one in the freezer already baked.  Hope that turns out!  Thanks, Christena.

Tasty recipe, added 1T fresh minced onion, used 1.5 cups milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2, added bacon to one quiche and ham to the other. Came out really nice.

Very good,would make again. I tried to stay true to the exact recipe,but I sauted the onions instead dry or raw.    ( my young nephew was eating it and I thought raw might be to much and I am not crazy about dry onions.

this was an amazing quiche. it also happened to be the first time i've ever tried a quiche. it was nice and easy. i will say that i accidentally used a pie crust, but it still turned out fine. the ham made it slightly salty, so this isn't for a low-salt dieter. but otherwise, it was amazing and i can't wait to make it again!

Followed the recipe exactly and this made a beautiful quiche.  We really enjoyed it -- especially my husband and son.  Both ate 2 pieces!  Very easy to make.

this has become a biweekly staple in our house! very easy recipe and great flavor. i do substitute 1/2C per quiche diced fresh onion for the dried, just my preference. also, i use 75% lowfat milk/ 25% light cream to cut the fat. i tried 100% lowfat milk and it was definitely a bit runny. i use 2% cheddar as well. i haven't yet tried freezing this recipe... but we eat it for dinner, and snack, or breakfast, or lunch... so it goes pretty quickly!

This was okay.  Nothing special, but perhaps a good base and very simple to do.  My only issue was that it was too salty.  I think the ham had enough, so if I make it again, I won't add extra salt.  It could also use some veggies IMHO...but again...this can be something to build on.

This was my second try at a quiche and it turned out fantastic. I used leftover ham from thanksgiving (honeybaked ham! soo yummy) and a combination of cheeses including mozzerella and quesdilla cheeses. Subbed out the cream for non-fat milk and it still worked out perfectly! Even had it for lunch the next day, and I rarely eat leftovers (which is sad I know)

Super easy! and Good!  I adjusted as follows... 2 deep dish pie shells, added 1/4 cup of egg whites, substituted on cup of cream with 1 cup of 1 percent milk, used a mixture of swiss, colby jack and cheddar cheese and used onion powder instead just a few shakes.  Yummy!  oh and baked it a 375 instead.

I halfed the recipe because I only had 1 crust. I sauted some shallots and mushrooms (instead of dried onions) and used ham and cheddar cheese. It turned out beautifully! The inside part is delicious, I have just realized I don't really like it with a crust. But I had never had quiche before so I didn't know. The recipe is still great though, and I will make again in a regular pan without the crust lol. Thanks!

This was delicious! I had some leftover Christmas ham that I wanted to use, and this dish was perfect. I did not have half and half, so I used milk instead. The egg was light and fluffy, and the flavor was delicious. Will definitely make again!

Loved this quick and easy quiche.  Definitely can be changed up with different meats, cheeses or added veggies.  I omitted the salt and added about 1/2-1 tsp garlic powder.  The dried mined onion was a good alternative to chopping an onion, although I prefer fresh it wasn't noticeable as a dried onion and added a hint of onion flavor.  (Kids will never know!)  I baked about an hour at 350 as I was baking other things and it came out perfect.  Definitely use the sharp cheddar or a stronger cheese if you prefer, it adds great flavor. It's wonderful that you can make ahead, freeze and have on hand for busy company weekends!

This quiche was so simple to make and very delicious.  I did saute onions as other suggested as my family loves cooked onions in dishes.  We ate one last night and froze one for later.  I wish that the recipe included suggestions for defrosting/baking the frozen quiches.

I have this recipe in my box @ home now. It always comes out perfectly! You can use any fillings you want. After looking at other quiche recipes on this site that call for 2 cups of milk or cream PER quiche I can see why they get reviewed as too soft. This one with 1 cup is perfect! Thanks for a great basic recipe!

This was really tasty.  I'm not a huge fan of quiche so for that reason I would have given it four stars.  The simplicity of this recipe earned it the fifth star.   The basis of the recipe allows for changes without complicating the recipe. I opted to create two different quiches from this recipe - a Ham & Swiss and a Ham, Broccoli & Cheddar. I intended to lower the temp to 375 as "happyschmoopies" had recommended but accidentally put it to 350 so the quiche had to cook a little longer than suggested but the crust wasn't too brown and the quiche itself was golden. Thanks for sharing this easy dish.

Family loved it.  Added additional cheese and onion.  Used cream.  Big hit!  One 1/2 of recipe was enough for our family.

I was making a crab quiche also so I halved this recipe and only made one.  I used leftover honey baked ham and had a bit of leftover half and half which I added to the milk.  I had a bit of an issue with the filling pouring out of the crust (even using the deep dish crusts!) but it turned out really tasty!

Really easy and everyone loved Christmas morning!! Will make again! I added one diced green bell paper and half a yellow sweet onion that I sauteed while cooking the shells. I skipped the dry onion since I already added onions :) Came out awesome!

This is an easy recipe to prepare and is a wonderful light meal served with fresh fruit. The only change I made was leaving out any additional salt.  My son loved it and so did I.

This was my first attempt at making quiche, I was always a little intimidated!  This recipe was super easy to follow!  I made the one quiche exactly like the recipe called.  Turned out perfect!  I made the next one using 1% milk instead of half and half and it came out more watery.  The first one with the half and half set up perfectly.  I will bite the calorie bullet next time and make this with the half and half!  Definately a keeper recipe!!

Basic, simple and no mess. Quiches can be tailored however you like it, but this is a classic version of a traditional ham and cheese quiche. I altered the ingredients as it suited my needs (ie. diced green onions and apple smoked ham) but thats just me! Thanks for a great recipe to throw in my recipe box.

I cut the milk in half and use one deep dish pie shell for a thick quiche.  Rather than freeze the baked quiche, I save and freeze leftover cubes of ham so I can make this recipe fresh once a month.  Easy and delicious.

This is a good basic recipe.  I followed some of the suggestions from other raters: Sauteed the onions with the ham in butter, used 1 cup half and half - 1 cup 2% milk, and baked at 375.  Good recipe!

Easy and fabulous.  I used half of a fresh, chopped onion instead of the powder, and I sauteed it along with the ham so there was some carmelization adding flavor and color.  Also added 1 c flour to give it extra substance (added to eggs before adding milk), and liberally added garlic powder and smoked paprika for increased depth of flavor.  yum!

LOVE this recipe.  I have 2 in my freezer right now.  Nice for one of those extra busy days when I just can't get supper going fast enough!  Very yummy!  I want to try it with other meats as well...  bulk sausage, summer veggies such as zucchini I think would be excellent as well.

Loved this recipe ... so easy and delicious. My eight-year-old son gobbles this up every time I make it. The only thing I did differently is use a bit of onion powder instead of the dried minced. Thank you!

My mother and my husband liked this. I didn't try this myself, although this is rated based on how fast people ate this, compared to another quiche someone brought to the Easter gathering.

Absolute perfection. Unbelievably yummy. My two year old twins LOVE this "Eggie pizza." I added diced tomatoes but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I just made this and it turned out great and tastes delicious. Was easy and I didn't have to hunt for a hundred ingredients. I stuck to the actual recipe.  Liked that it didn't take many eggs compared to some quiche. Will make again.

Great starter recipe and add what you want from there.  When I make this again I will bake it the suggested time and the reheat it and eat the next day.  The first day it stuck to the plate but after it cooled and was heated again it was perfect.

I cut the salt in half and thought it was still very salty.  Be cautious on how much salt to add considering that ham is already a salty food.  I added sauteed fresh onion and mushrooms.  I used deli ham.   Very easy so I would make again just watching how much salt.

I doubled this recipe with the intention of freezing one quiche to use as a last minute dinner.  Before they were cool, the first quiche was gone and everyone wanted to know if they could cut into the second.  Very delicious and filling.

Very good basic recipe for picky eaters. I did tweak mine a little. I sauted finely chopped onions and added a can of green chilies to the onions. I used whole milk in place of half/half. I also added a 1/4 tsp. of chili powder to my egg mixture. I only had a pkg of regular pie crust on hand so used that. The end result?? Great!! Will do again and again.

My family LOVED this recipe, we ate one quiche for dinner and the second for breakfast the next day! I did not put in any onion and I used a mix of medium cheddar and jack cheese. The flavor was very mild but I have small children and a picky husband so it went over REALLY well. I also used 2% milk instead of half and half, it still turned out GREAT!!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I have used it for so long but hadn't rated it.  Since, I am making it tonight, I thought I'd finally give it the 5 stars it deserves.  I stick close to the recipe, but I add an extra egg, as well as some real bacon bits and use the deep dish crust.  Yum! Great fall meal!

Very good recipe!  Only changes were that I used 3 eggs for each crust and I also left out the dried onions and instead sauteed a little onion and bell pepper.

This is great for a light supper, and can even be reheated for a snack. I've used this recipe as a base, and have added spinach, bacon, whatever I have on hand. Definitely one of our favorites!

I love this recipe! I made it for family at Christmas and made one with ham. My sister doesn't like ham so I made the other one with sausage.  They both turned out amazing!  Rave reviews from all and my husband now prefers the sausage so I have made it a couple times since then too!

Easy, tasty recipe.  I had to make lunch for 20 teenagers, some of whom said they didn't like quiche, but miraculously, there were few leftovers!  I had comments like "that was the best quiche I ever ate!"  It took about 10 minutes longer to cook than the recipe indicated, but I think that may have been the oven I was using.

I didn't really like this recipe.  I have never had quiche as a pie vs. the individual servings, though.  It seemed greasy.  If I were to try this again for some reason, perhaps I will use less half and half and reduced fat cheese to see if it turns out more to my liking.  I was really confused because I love all the ingredients so I thought I would like this for sure!  To each his own.

This is a great recipe for quiche, but I modified it a bit.  I also added 4 slices chopped bacon, 1 pkg frozen spinach which had been cooked and drained, plus 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.  I think these modifications added more flavor to the quiche.  My kids loved it!

I made this recipe and it was great,even my kids ate it.

I used about 3 or 4 tablespoons or fresh minced onions because that is what I had.

Great recipe to use when you have left over baked ham from the night before.

I omitted the onion and used the full recipe in one pie shell.  I also chose Gruyere instead of cheddar cheese.  C'est magnifique :)

Very nice flavor. I made a crust out of hash brown potatoes with a little melted butter to bind. Pre-baked crust at 400F for around 10 minutes, then added filling and cooked as in recipe.

Excellent recipe.   It was easy.  I made an alteration of adding 1/2 cup cheddar and 1/2 cup swiss only because I didn't have enough cheddar. The men even ate this quiche.  Thanks for sharing Christena.

Pretty good - but it took an extra 10-15 mintues to bake up.  i like mine a little more egg a little less solids.  Will likely make again, but will keep looking for "the one."  My light eating three year old grubbed on htis and my 17 year old sister dug it, too.

Simple and delicious recipe.  I used turkey instead of ham and added about 1/2 c. drained green chile. I also used about 1/4 c. shaved parmesan.  Thanks Christena!

Very good basic recipe.  I add sauteed onion and 1/2 t. of ground mustard, I usually just use milk and it works out fine.

This is a very good quiche recipe.  The only problem I had was I tried to cut it almost immediately and it was a little soft in the middle.  Next time I will let it sit for a little while before slicing.  Overall the taste was excellent.  Family loved it.

Sorry but this recipe is only OK.  First of all, I am curious as to why Christena suggested NOT pricking the pie crusts - what I ended up with was deformed pie crusts!!!  (They bubble up if you don't prick them)  Also, despite using REAL onions, instead of diced, the flavor was only OK.  Finally, cooking time and temperature was WAY off.  400 degrees burnt my crust despite covering them with foil!!!  Needless to say, presentation was awful.  Next time, I will add some of my own seasonings (i.e. fresh green onions, a dash of hot sauce, etc) to the egg mixture and bake for 45 minutes at 375.
