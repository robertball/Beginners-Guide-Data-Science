These cookies were fantastic! I just used 1 cup raisins and 1 cup chocolate chips (All I had). Also used 200 grams cherry fat free yogurt (2 single serving size containers).The cherry flavour went very well with  the chocolate :).

Great recipe.  I reduced the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup, increased the cranberries to a full cup and left out the blueberries.
