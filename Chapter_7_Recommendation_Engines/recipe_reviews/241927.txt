Waffled Falafel Haiku: "An awful waffle. Well, I guess the taste was good, but a MESS to make." Even with a liberal, heavy squirting hand of non-stick spray, this was disastrously stuck to the waffle maker. I pulled it out in clumps with a butter knife, re-forming it into the semblance of a waffle-shape and finishing them off in the oven. The falafel taste (and I followed the recipe exactly as written) was terrific, but the execution was just a fail.

These were fun and delicious! The only thing I will do differently next time is to cut back on the salt (maybe by 1/2), because these came out super salty, and I even drained and rinsed the beans very well. Other than that, these had great flavor. Be careful b/c getting these off of the waffle iron can be tricky. I served these w/ a Syrian-type salad, 'Roasted Garlic Tzatziki' from this site and whole grain pita. This was great for a change...I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This turned out very well. I puréed the batter until it was smooth and used less salt. To stretch the recipe to serve 8, I added extra garbanzos and spices, but still just used the 2 egg whites and kept the amount of olive oil the same. I made it a day ahead and then added water to the batter so it was easier to spread on the waffle iron, which I brushed oil onto just for the first waffle. They did not stick. We had them with homemade tsaziki and sliced cherry tomatoes. Putting them on a rack in a low oven while cooking kept them slightly crisp. I would make this again. Also, I used whole wheat flour but I don't know if that made any difference.

This recipe is full of flavor and fun!  I usually pan fry my falafel which is a pain.  I turned my waffle maker on to the highest setting and sprayed generously with EVOO in between each waffle.

This recipe was a big hit with my wife.  I really liked it too.  I left out the parsley (not a fan) and added a couple tablespoons of olive oil, hoping to prevent sticking.  It got better if we cooked it longer and made it a little crisper.  Can out of waffle iron easily.  Topped with homemade tzatziki, cucumber, onion, cilantro, grape tomatoes, and chicken.

I followed the directions exactly and sprayed the heck out of my waffle iron with Pam, but the waffles were a crumbled, stuck-on mess. I ended up making patties and frying them in a skillet. The mixture itself tastes great, but making falafel in a waffle iron is a risky endeavor.

I took this to a pot luck and it was a big success. I also made the roasted garlic taztziki found on this site. I will never buy falafel mix again.

I made no changes to this recipe but did cook it on an ancient waffle maker that may have not been as thick as today’s models
. The taste was good but the texture was terribly dry.

I mean it was okay but there really is a reason you fry falafel. Maybe if I were on a super restrictive diet and I really needed to cut down on fat I might do this. But until a doctor orders me, in my house, it’s worth the mess of pan frying.

I used less cilantro.  Served with chopped cucumber, tomato, and cucumber-yogurt sauce.  
Next time I would add a blend of tahini and hummus.

I love this idea, especially since I got a waffle maker for Christmas. I used an immersion blender to combine everything. These are definitely delicate, so I had to be extra careful getting them out of the waffle maker. Most of the falafel I've had has been very dense, but these weren't. They were a great addition to some oregano chicken and cucumber salad. My only complaint is they were a little bland. Next time I will double the spices, except for the salt.

I love the idea of using a waffle iron for falafel.  Unfortunately, I did not have success with the waffle iron, as others have mentioned.  The recipe itself was also not really to my taste, especially the salt.  The texture was too dry and crumbly.

I used less than 1/2 the amount of salt & then add zest of 1 lemon.  Great recipe. Served with homemade Tzatziki.

I made this with my 9 year old daughter.  We followed the directions and ended up with an extremely brittle and flakey falafel.  The flavor was too bland for mexample but my daughter loved it.  If I made it again I would play around with some more seasonings. We had fun making it though.

This recipe was quick and delicious!  I liked the twist over the regular fried falafel, as this waffled version has just a fraction of the fat!!!
Yum!!!
