This was fabulous! I used bottled key lime juice and regular lime zest. I also always put cheesecake in a water bath with the spring form pan wrapped tightly in several layers of foil. This was gone in seconds at a family gathering. People who love key lime loved it, and people who hate key lime loved it. Can't go wrong with this recipe. If you want more lime flavor you can add a bit more juice. It will be fine.

This was delish! Added more lime juice and zest than called for (I zested and juiced about 8 key limes, though I'm patient with zesting or juicing, so it was probably like fully zesting and juicing four little key limes) and added in about two drops of green food coloring to make the color pop a bit. Had it on Thanksgiving after dinner and the whole family gobbled it up!  A nice tip is to throw it in the freezer for 45 to an hour before cutting it. You get perfect slices and the cake is nice and firm, tasking almost like lime sherbet ice cream!!

I followed the recipe to the letter, thinking that maybe the lack of lime taste had to do with people using regular limes instead of key limes...but I have to agree, the lime taste is very subtle and could be upped by a lime or maybe two if you want a stronger key lime taste.  I am getting ready for a grad party and made these up as mini cheesecakes, so if anyone is interested, it makes about 55 mini cheesecakes, and they need to be baked for 20 minutes.  They also freeze nicely, just thaw in the refrigerator.  I will be making about 300 of these as mini cheesecakes and will up the lime juice and rind by one, and I will also add a few drops of green food coloring   to make it look like a lime cheesecake.  A pretty decent recipe as written, but with a little more lime juice, I think it will be very good.

Quite delicious!!!  Though there wasn't quite enough lime flavor (I like it really strong) so I just zested some extra limes and that did the trick.  I also combined the juice from those extra zested limes and equal parts of sugar and heated it on the stove to make a syrup which I drizzled on the cheesecake, as I have people in the house who don't like whipped cream or Cool Whip on cheesecake, and that was fan-freakin'-tastic!!

I am not a huge CC fan but I have to say this was good! Nicely flavored and not too heavy. For the crust, I used cookies I had leftover from Baking Nana's cookie decorating party in early December. We were done eating them and I didn't have the heart to throw them away. I processed them up for crumbs and added melted butter, perfect fix! Some of the cookies were red velvet cake cookies, hence the red color crust. I used key lime juice from a bottle and used no zest. I always bake my CC's in a 9 inch cake pan, for water bath purposes. I never get cracks either. Sray bottom with Pam and fit a piece of parchment paper circle on the bottom, spray again and add your crust and filling. Run a knife around the finished cake and a little heat from the stove and it comes right out! Life is Too Short to mess with springform pans and foil! I made a vanilla whipped cream for it and it was delish! Thank you Philie!

I used 1/2 cup key lime juice and three drops of green coloring; also used nilla wafers for the crust. Taste was great, but with these baking directions the edges were over cooked before the center set. Next time I will bake a few minutes at 350, turn the temp down for a while, and cool in the oven as I do my other recipes.

First attempt at making a cheesecake & I was VERY pleased with the results! Easy to make & got rave reviews from friends & family (even those who dont normally like lime flavour!). I used Granita biscuits for the base & as an extra also added 1/4cup almond meal & 1/4cup dessicated coconut. And I took others advice & used 4 limes instead of 2 and was happy with the tangy-but not overwhelming-taste this had! will definetly be going in my cookbook to make again sometime.

USE 4 LIMES NOT 2!!!  Awesome w/ raspberry puree drizzle.   I have never made cheesecake before - it turned out perfect!  I did use water bath & also added 1 tbls cornstarch (read it would help prevent cracking).

I think I would have liked this recipe more if I followed the recipe exactly and not taken the advice of the other reviews to add more lime. I put the juice of 4 limes in mine and thought it was painfully tart. I can't imagine what it would have been like with any more limes than that. Everyone who ate it liked it, but I still would have preferred it to be more subtle.

Very good, simple recipe. I used 6 key limes and I increased the mixture for the crust since I like it to come up the sides. Everyone really enjoyed this!

As far as cheesecake recipes go, this one was mediocre.  I followed it to the letter and ended up with a cheesecake that was the consistency of melty ice cream.  I am not at all impressed with Philadelphia recipes, and probably won't use them again.  The flavor was good though, and it was a decent recipe to learn on my way to cheesecake perfection.

This is the best Cheesecake, so light and freezes well for leftovers.  No heavy condensed milk and so easy to make.

This cheesecake is creamy and delicious. It isn't overpoweringly "limey", but my family really enjoyed it. My son requests it for his birthday treat now. Inadvertently used a 10" pan this year, so it was only a couple of inches thick, but it didn't hurt a thing. It was finished about 7 minutes earlier than the recipe states.
