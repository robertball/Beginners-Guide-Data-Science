Okay this is similar to the BEST cut-out cookie recipe ever invented. I don't doubt that these are great cookies! To make them into cut-outs I use 1 C butter (no shortening) and I use 1/2 tsp almond flavoring. I'll try your version soon as I love pecans and it's much easier not having to cut out cookies. Thank you:)

This is a shortbread-type cookie instead of a soft cookie which I expected.But its is an excellent shortbread cookie when made with all butter!.
