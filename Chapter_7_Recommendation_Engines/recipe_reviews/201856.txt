Hubs particularly liked this but I thought it was a little flat, one dimensional in flavor.  I think it would benefit from some cumin and Mexican oregano. Hubs found the cooking process on the grill fun and relaxing -  a great "unwinder" after the workday grind.  We served this with soft chicken tacos.

Fabulous. I added fresh squeezed lime juice.  To linda2d, not sure what you added to your recipe photo that is red???? Also, it is hard to comprehend that 1 1/2 inch slice of an onion would end up overpowering.......Maybe you used more? Just a thought......



May 3, 2010 ---- Made this again last night, this time using anaheim and jalapeno chiles, no tomatoes. Added some lemon juice and jalapeno juice from a jar of jalapenos. Went well over baked chicken breast.

We found the onion and garlic to be overpowering and did not enjoy this as a dip but we did like the flavor it added to our burritos. My poblanos were on the small side but are usually pretty hot so I didn't want to add another.  The tomatillos were also small so I added a couple extras.  I will try this again because I like the roasted flavor but I will probably reduce the onion or add it at the end rather than first so they don't get as pulverized. I tried to make it smoother so they may have released too much juices.    SAFETY NOTE:  One of my tomatillos burst on the grill and squirted hot juice at me.EDIT2/17/10 made again but minced onion & garlic by hand and added at end with much better results.  BTW the red is an extra ripe pepper, nothing mysterious.

This was very good. I used jalapeno peppers instead of serranos. I kept the charred peels on the vegetables for flavor. We roasted the onion and the garlic on the grill too. This was indeed spicy and had quite a kick to it, but isn't super hot. Thanks! We had a great time making this salsa and are going to enjoy eating it even more.

I love verde salsas but have never made one myself. This recipe caught my eye with the roasting method. I used two small jalape√±os in lieu of serranos peppers since my garden is full of them.  The first couple bites lacked flavor for us but certainly not heat. So we added more cilantro, a good squeeze of fresh lime and couple dashes of cumin, and some fresh oregano from the garden...much better flavor. I did enjoy the roasted flavor and if I make again I'll roast the onion and garlic also. So with a little bit of tweaking this is a pretty good salsa.

Very good, but I needed more oomph. I added cumin & lime juice. I also love onion, garlic and cilantro so I used more of all 3. But, that's what is great about recipes, you get to personalize. Thanks for sharing!

I added some jalapenos and about a tablespoon of lime juice to this recipe. I roasted the jalapenos like i did the other peppers and it was a big hit at the playoff party i went to. Great Recipe!!!

Delicious!  I served this as the dipping sauce for a carne asada burrito.  Not having access to a grill, I blackened the peppers in the oven (with the rack in the second highest slot) which worked fine.  Next time I'll cut the garlic in half and add lime juice as it was a bit thick and garlicky.

This recipe is a good base. Like most of the reviewers, I tweaked the recipe a bit to make it more dimensional. I added an avocado for richness and some lime juice. Yum!

This is so fresh and flavorful and serranos pack some heat! I added a little lime juice. So good!

I just had to update to mention that my husband, whom initially spit out the salsa when he tried it as dip, ate my tamales that I made using this green salsa recipe.  They were so good.  Thanks again for this recipe.  I no longer buy canned.

I thought it was a good recipe.  The only thing I did different was roast everything in the oven instead of on the grill.

grilled it many times.  I love it.  I add more garlic because I hate vampires.  I decided to smoke the peppers and tomatillos instead of grill them.  Wow!  I smoked the halved peppers and tomatillos for a half hour instead of grilling them.  Outstanding!  If you liked smoke flavored foods.

I thought this might be too spicy, so I tried using jalapenos instead of serranos. I really think the recipe needs the spice, otherwise it will be too bland.
