Good, but I think it would be even better with rum. I made no changes.

This is a nice "frou frou" drink.  I'm a beer girl, myself, but decided to step outside the box (and give this recipe a "face"!).  I did not have grenadine or cherries, but followed everything else to a "T".  It was super sweet and didn't fill my glass, so, after tasting, I added more pineapple, Sprite Zero, and both liquors to make a full glass.  It's not my style, but I'll def keep it in mind to offer guests who prefer a sweet fruity drink as the ingredients are always things we have in stock at the LTH house.  To further up the "sugar shock", I rimmed my glass in raw sugar ;) Thanks for a nice recipe!

I like this a bunch! I used a little more Sprite because I'm  'light weight' but the taste is so terrific. Like a candy instead of the swill my husband likes in a traditional martini, hahah!
