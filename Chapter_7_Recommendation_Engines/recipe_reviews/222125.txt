I decreased sugar to 3/4 c and decreased butter to 1/4 c (I will try substituting coconut oil next time) and increased the peanut butter to 1 c. I also added flax meal (approx 1/4 c) and was generous with the coconut. Fairly "healthy" by the time I was through and they turned out delicious but soft. Will be making again.

These were really sweet! I am not sure these can really be called healthy with all of the sugar. I remember the regular version from when I was a kid, but didn't compare. These haven't set up yet, but they did seem a tad oily and softer than I remember. I made 1/2 recipe which yielded 20 cookies with a cookie scoop. I followed the recipe except, when I cut it in half, I subbed 2 of the tablespoons of sugar with maple syrup for a little added flavor. I used Jiff creamy natural instead of chunky. I didn't think coconut would be good in these, nor remember it, so I left it out. The filling still seemed plenty thick. I also added a small pinch of salt. 20 cookies, made as written above, came to 89.2 calories each.

It flies in the face of the recipe name...but we added mini marshmallows before rolling.  The kids loved them!

I have made these twice now. The first time they didn't set up like I had hoped for.  This time, I boiled the sugar, milk, butter and cocoa for about 2 minutes.  When I added the oatmeal, I used rounded cups vs leveled cups (to make sure they set up this time). I also used coconut extract instead of vanilla.  They turned out wonderful!

Delicious!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and I didn't put as much butter - only about 1.5 tbsp. I added honey to help it stay together and let them sit overnight. Only yields about 15 cookies though.

Having a problem getting them to harden properly... even stuck them in the fridge hoping to give them a hand. I was thinking maybe I used the wrong peanut butter? Ive heard that the natural peanut butter is no good for some recipes, so could this be one of them? The mixture tastes great. Just more like sticky goo than actual cookies. -_-

Tasty and turned out great. Only thing I would change is the name. These little ditties are high in sugar and fat.

I liked that these said healthier version so I tried them.  Was disappointed that they didn't set, they were sticky and could not bring them to my party!  Very disappointed in these!

I made these cookies last week and they didn't last but a couple days! Everyone loved them. They reminded me of the ones my mom would make me as a kid, but with less sugar (which I have been trying to cut back on).  I didn't have crunchy peanut butter, so I used creamy and added a 1/4 cup of chopped pecans. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee.  I will definitely make these again!! Thank you for sharing it with us!

Used 1 cup of honey instead of sugar and coconut oil instead of butter. These set up well and were chewy and a delicious alternative to the other, unhealthier versions of recipe for this cookie.
