I am not a slow cooker fan but this was a winner with a few tweaks. I did have to make a few adjustments to get it to our tastes but this is a definite repeat with a few minor changes. First problem I had was the thickening (Wondra/water) did not thicken it nearly enough. I corrected that with 4 more tablespoons of wondra to some cream and let it cook the last hour. It did taste a bit underseasoned for our taste so I added about 1 teaspoon of thyme and a pinch of sage. I did not have brocolli so I had to forgo that. Next time I would add more carrots than potatoes but that is my personal taste. I have a newer crock pot that cooks pretty hot so this could have been done in three hours so adjust recipe to the newer & hotter slow cooker standards. I forgot to turn the dumplings but it came out great in spite of me :)  Thanks so much for sharing a delicious and simple recipe jterrij. This recipe is a wonderful tribute to your mama. UPDATE:I made this again today using leftover rotisserie chicken & my homemade chicken stock. I made the biscuit mix from AR ( http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Homemade-Biscuit-Mix/?prop31=9) and reduced it to 12 servings to make the dumplings making this even more budget friendly. I threw in some mushrooms and a glug of white wine. This recipe is so easy and versatile and I will use it for years to come.

This was very good. I did add some addition seasoning and used about 4 tbls more wondra to thicken more. I also used frozen chicken breast and shred it before adding the dumplings. Great recipe thank you.

I made this tonight and it was SOOO easy, delicious and inexpensive. I followed the recipe but used vegetables I already had. My husband requested that we have this often and we discussed some fun add-ins for variety, but really it's perfect as it is.

Recipe was average. Not much flavor and the base seemed too watery even after adding a decent amount of flour.

I followed most of the directions to a T however I did end up adding more quick mixing flour to make it thicker because it wasn't turning into a paste as well as adding garlic to the mix an some Italian seasoning mix... Overall it was a major hit in my home

Yummy!  Cut up raw chicken breast and cooked with the potatoes & veggies instead of using canned chicken.  Did add seasonings because we like seasonings.  Mashed up some of the potatoes to use as an extra thickener and it was perfect.  Donâ€™t worry about measuring, just toss it in.

The dumplings did not work remotely. But what really made this inedible was the broccoli. The taste was terrible.  If I were ever going to try this again, I would leave the broccoli out for sure (maybe substitute celery and or more carrots. And then I would look for a separate recipe for crock pot dumplings to cross reference.

It tasted terrific... until we added the dumplings. Followed the instructions exactly yet they were a mess. Didn't cook, couldn't turn them over. Ruined the entire batch. What is the correct way to add dumplings?

Cooked it on low and the veggies weren't even remotely done.
