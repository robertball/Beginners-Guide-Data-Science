Ok so I don't know if I can really review this recipe because I TOTALLY changed it! LOL! But it still turned out really good because I used the recipe as a base. I skipped the crust to start. I used fresh green beans (steamed them for 5-7 minutes then threw them in the skillet with everything else), celery, carrots and towards the end of the skilleting, added most of a can of corn (so no zucchini or mushrooms - we don't like them). Otherwise, I did everything the same - I just added a little more thyme and also some Italian seasoning. I'd say the cheese layer is a must - it was so yummy. Oh and be careful not to make the potato topping too thick. Overall, fantastic meal that we both loved!!!!!!!

This recipe has become a staple at my house- and my family typically doesn't care for Shepherds Pie!  It goes together easily and is just as good reheated.  Thanks, Rebecca!

This was delicious! And a great way to incorporate lots of garden veggies. I didn't bother with the pie crust, and I did mix in a teaspoon of chicken boullion into the meat mixture for extra flavor. I mixed all the veggies in with the meat - diced carrots, green beans (steamed for a bit first), diced zucchini. I sprinkled the top with paprika for a decorative touch. I will definitely make this again.

Good pie and it held together nicely. I added dried apricots, almonds and broccoli to the filling and kept the skins on the potatoes. I also just made a white pie crust instead of whole wheat crusts. One tip though is to make sure you drain your meat well because any extra oil will make your pie crust a little soggy. I got ratings from 4 to a five from my family except my younger sisters who aren't big veggie fans gave it a 2 and 3. Everyone agreed that the pie was better than the chicken pot  pie we all ate this weekend at my aunt's house. Good, hearty recipe just not the best.

Yum!!  A cross between a pot pie and shepherd pie.  With ground turkey, this is awesome.  Didn't have Zucchini, and added a little more spice.. but it turned out perfect.

Last year, I prepared this for "Deer Camp" and thought 2 pies would be enough...silly me.  It was such a hit that I'm making 6 pies this year for the same number of men (and woman - me)!!!  Tasty AND healthy - can't beat that!!!

This recipe is awesome!  I made it as a make-ahead for a busy day and my family was delighted with it (of course those picky kids with vegetable issues were standoffish!)I am sharing it with all my friends!  Thanks Becca!

The only thing I really changed is that I added a couple TBSP of flour instead of only one and then added about a cup of chicken broth to make some gravy with the meat and vegetables.  That made it really amazing as I looked like it was going to be a little dry.   I changed the veggies a bit and used carrots, onions, celery, green beans and peas.

My husband and 3yr old loved it. I did not. He rated it. I would have gave it a 2. I love Mexican and Indian food! A lot of spice, so this was very plain to me. But..if Hubby is happy I am happy!!  Thank you..

DELICIOUS - a great departure from the standard beef shepherd's pie.  Vary the veggies for different flavors.

Everyone liked this.  I used prepared crust and cooked diced turkey breast instead of the ground turkey.  The only thing I omitted was the zucchini because I didn't have any.  It was good in a pinch, and nice that I had all the ingredients on hand.  I think I would use more potatoes next time.

WasnÂ´t very creamy but I liked it a lot and thought it was great for a healthier recipe.  I made the whole wheat pie crust from another recipe on this site, lined a 9by13" pan and this recipe just filled that.  I used corn instead of the green beans and mozarrela instead of Cheddar (no Cheddar cheese in Chile :()  Enjoyed the recipe and will make again.

This was okay, but just barely.  The only change I made was that I skipped the pie crust.  It was SO dry.  It may be better with a little turkey gravy thrown over the top or maybe creamed soup like others suggested.  It had a very earthy flavor.  My non-picky 4 year old didn't like it.  My husband thought it was 'edible', but was in no hurry to take leftovers for lunch the next day.  I froze one of the pies for later use and will definitely make gravy when I use it to 'save' it, but will not make this again.  In a nut shell, for us it was dry and bland.

I used refrigerated pie crusts and instant mashed potatoes as time savers. Flavor is really good, my husband and I liked it but the kids were so-so on it. Froze the second pie to have on hand for an easy dinner - tasted fine reheated!

I love this recipe. I do not eat white potatoes as a rule, so I use sweet potatoes and what ever veggies I have on hand. Its easy and it freezes well. Thank you!

Don't hate me because I did change the recipe a bit based on what I had at my house but it turned out really good. I used idaho potatoes and left out the pie crust. I used carrots, fresh green beans, corn, onion, mushrooms and used the same spices. It turned out delicious and the leftovers heated up great.

I used leftover turkey and mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving for this recipe. I omitted mushrooms and green beans since I didn't have any on hand, so I just added extra zucchini. I think it worked out great!

I love this recipe. I didn't have any Zucchini so I used asparagus which was also delicious. I've also thrown a yam in there which I boiled with the potatoes and diced up after it was cooked.

This was good, but I wouldn't say it was great. We cut the pies into 6 slices each, and my husband only ate one slice and he didn't comment on it at all. I ate two pieces, I liked it, but had a hard time getting my 10 year old to eat his.

I did this recipe without making it a pie, i.e., no crust, for it to be a bit healthier. I also added green and red peppers. I only used 1/2 tbsp of butter total. I used 3/4 cup green beans and would probably use more the next time. I will definitely be making this again. Perhaps with a little less potatoes and more meat and veggies. Thanks for the idea for me to branch off on!

It was good. Not great. I made as directed but nixed the green beans and left skins on my potatoes. I think my main complaint would be that it was really dry. I think I will make this again but I will actually add a little broth or something (I didn't have anything to drain since my ground turkey was almost fat free) to make it a bit saucy. And cook the zucchini a bit because I didn't really like crunching them. It's a really good start but for us- needs a few tweaks. I did use a whole wheat pie crust but I made it myself. I actually think I'd prefer a white one here.

I substituted green beans and mushroom with corn and cauliflower.  The left over Thanksgiving turkey was used so a little extra butter was needed to keep it moist.  A very good recipe.  Thanks Becca

The flavor was great. I did not use the pie crust and instead put it in a 9x13 casserole dish.  I changed up the veggies too.  added some red cabbage, yellow pepper, another carrot.  Took out the green beans but topped with a can of corn.

This is a decent recipe that's healthy and easy to prepare.  The filling was a bit too dry and crumbly - next time, I might try adding just a few spoons of cream soup.  I used canned corn, and did not add the carrot, zucchini, and green beans.  2 red potatoes would have been more than sufficient for one pie... I ended up with too thick a potato layer.

I was determined to make dinner tonight without having to run to store for ingredients.  Found this and hit paydirt.  I susbstitued corn for zucchini, and omitted the piecrust, and put it in oven for my husband and children while I went to church.  I returned home later to "mom, I LOVED the Shepherd's Pie" and "Honey, that was the best Shepherd's Pie you've ever made!"  (I had to remind my husband that this was my first Shepherd's Pie, but you get the point.)  
Thanks, Becca.  This one's a keeper.

This was delicious!  I only had one pie crust in the freezer, so I halved the recipe and it turned out great.  I didn't use green beans or mushrooms, but substituted green peas and chopped pickles and I used yellow zucchini.  I also used cream, not milk for the mashed potatoes, yum! The spices were lovely and the overall flavour is wonderful.  The "filling" is so good, you could eat it alone.  I found that this recipe is a bit time consuming, but the taste is worth the work.  Thanks for the recipe!

Came out great and I'm a terrible cook!  I used the second crust to put on top of the pie  and added broccoli and corn. Came out awesome!

I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used cooked leftover thanksgiving turkey breast. Yum! This is comfort food at its best.

I left out the flour, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It turned out great.

I have made this so many times! It is a great recipe for having one pie to eat immediately, and one to freeze, or in the case of my family, eat the next night because they love it so much. Who ever heard of people wanting to eat the same dinner two nights in a row?!? Awesome! This recipe is great because it substitutes turkey for the traditional beef recipe, and this is better for people like me with arthritis (less saturated fat; less red meat). The few small things I change when I make this recipe: I use more potatoes (i.e. 10 large red potatoes, or 8 golden potatoes) and more butter to make the mash to top the pies. I use fresh green beans instead of canned, which can be added to the turkey mixture with the mushrooms. I do not like the zucchini in this because I make it too soggy, but it makes a tasty addition if under-cooked properly. I add 1 can of fresh kernel sweet corn; use at least double the mushrooms; add 2-3 stalks chopped celery; and split one regular sized shredded Cheddar bag between the two pies. Good hearty comfort food, thanks so much for the recipe!!

This is a great "What do I do with all this left over turkey" recipe!! When I make a turkey breast in the crockpot I make extra mashed potatoes.  If there are any left over veggies I use those too!!  From now on turkey shepherds pie follows the turkey breast in the crockpot!  Thanks for the idea!

I was shocked at how good this recipe is. I did make a few changes which include sauteing sweet onions, garlic and pepper and added this mixture to the ingredient list.   I will say it again, I was shocked at how good this recipe is. I had to freeze the second pie to save my husband from a food induced coma.  Definitely a permanent part of the rotation.

it was great!  I made no variations but next time I will use peas instead of green beans.  I did use deep pie crust and froze the 2nd pie.  Key is to use fresh parsley.  It had great flavor.  My only complaint is that this is NOT a 15 min recipe (which is were I found but a great make ahead meal) - more like 60 min plus 30 min bake time.  Despite that, I will made again.

Absolutely delicious! Instead of red potatoes, I used a regular baking potato as well as half of a sweet potato. I used fresh green beans instead of canned, frozen green peas in place of the zucchini, and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. I eliminated the butter and flour altogether, and I didn't use a crust, but this recipe still turned out to be a success! My friends and I finished all of it in one evening!

Great for make ahead dinners.  Very nutrious and delicious!  :-)
I modified it for husband/child taste -- eliminated yellow squash, added corn.  Fun to try different veggies.  I find I must cook much longer for the pie crust to cook all the way.  Otherwise, crust tends to be quite 'doughy.'

When putting this together it looked a little dry to my so I added a can of cream of chicken. I also used velvetta cheese cuz that is what I had on hand and the family all loved it. Great way to use up leftover turkey. Thanks, Sonya
