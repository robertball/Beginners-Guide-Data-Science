They are great with vanilla ice cream.  A bit too crumbly to eat on their own. And a bit dry without ice cream.  The apricots are good in them though.

These were tasty, though I agree they were a little dry.  I also sprinkled cinnamon on top of the second layer of dough.  I brought them to work and the guys ate 'em up!
