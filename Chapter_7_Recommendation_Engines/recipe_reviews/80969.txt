This recipe was fantastic, though I added my own touches...  Used a can of mild chili beans besides the kidneys, and mashed half of each can.  Added a 4 oz. can of mild green chilies.  Also diced half a green pepper and did not cook it or the onion until all the ingredients were mixed.  Cut the water in half to make it thicker and heartier, and added a dash of cinnamon.  We are definitely saving this recipe - it is the best we've tried so far!
Edit: I've made this a second time now, this time in the slow-cooker.  We did not change anything except to add a little more water.  We left it on low for the day (8 hrs).

This chili is a great version of it on the healthier side! I add some assorted veggies like carrots and peppers and onions to it- 1 cup of each to make it heartier and meet my daily veggie requirements

Great recipes with these adjustments.
Sauteeed chopped onion and minced garlic in olive oil.  Then added ground turkey.  Cooked with a montreal dry steak seasoning I use with turkey.
Added in a little extra tomatoes, left out water & chili powder, added double the cumim, and two tablespoons of brown sugar.  Simmered for 2 hrs (checking taste and adjusting seasonings slightly if needed) and served with shreded cheese and crackers for friends and my son.  Was *gone* and had recipe requests afterwards.  I so adore this site!

This chili was perfect for a cold night.  While I cooked the turkey meat, I added the onions and garlic.  I didn't mash the kidney beans and added a can of black beans and corn.  Instead of water, I used chicken broth.  You have to tweak this recipe to your liking with the spices.

I REALLY liked this! It's a great recipe for ground turkey if you don't want it to taste like turkey--it tastes just like chili. My only suggestion would be to be wary of how much cayenne pepper you put in. I used the called for amount and it was too 'hot' for my son. I'll definatly make this again.

My wife just loved it...  To avoid it being too soupy I added a can of chili beans in addition to the kidney beans. 

To give it a more unique flavor I added:

1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon cinammon
2 seeded and chopped jalapenos
1 seeded and chopped green bell pepper.

I also suggest using red onion instead of a white onion.  Enjoy!!!

Thanks for all the great reviews! The published recipe isn't exactly what I submitted, but close enough. :) It's the seasonings that matter! I also use it as a base recipe and adjust to my whims. 

Lately it's been a few ribs of celery, a bell pepper, the onion & garlic - saute all that together in olive oil. Once softened, add the turkey and brown. Add spices and cook together for a minute or two. Add 1 can diced tomatoes, beans (I use a can of whole kidney beans, no mashing), and chicken broth to cover. Let it simmer for as long as you can for delicious chili! 

There are so many ways to make this basic chili exactly as you like it!

Yummy.  I substituted half of the ground turkey with Asian firm tofu (which I left under a weight to drain extra water and then crumbled).  I like my chili to be thick so I reduced the water to 1 cup.  I didn't think it was very spicy so I added another 1/2 Tablespoon of chili powder.

Absolutely delicious! I only made a few changes (due to what I had in the kitchen). No kidney beans - so I used garbanzo beans. Also, I used frozen, pre-chopped onion (saves time and tears!) and omitted the paprika (was out)...delicious, will make again. :)

I've got a double batch of this in my crockpot now. Instead of water, I used organic chicken broth and I also used black beans instead of kidney only because that was what I had on hand. The chili powder I used was california ground chili powder which has all the flavor of chili powder with half the heat. (You can find it in the "mexican" aisle of your supermarket hanging from a j-hook in a cellophane package.) I'll update my review once we've had this for supper. EDITED: I had a bowl of this for lunch. For me, this wasn't chili, more like taco soup. It didn't really have much to it. This was okay, I think it needs a little more of something. Not sure what, though.

I made a couple modifications based on the previous reviews.  First, I sauteed the onion and garlic until tender.  Then I cooked the ground turkey.  I would suggest not cooking the meat with the onion/garlic.  Instead, cook the onions/garlic first, then remove them from the pan, add a little oil, and cook the turkey until done, and then add the onion back in.  That way, the turkey can get golden brown and you'll get those little bits at the bottom of the pan, and deglaze it when you add the liquid.  I mashed up only half a can of the kidney beans and left the remaining ones whole.  Only added one cup of water with the crushed tomatoes, however, I like my soups really thick so I might consider adding even less than that next time, or just using some chicken stock in place of the water.  Didn't have any paprika or oregano at home so I omitted that, but I would probably leave the oregano in for extra flavor.  Then at the end, I added 2 ears of frozen corn towards the end of cooking.  I would really suggest adding corn; it gives the chili an extra punch of flavor.  Not a bad chili considering how easy and fast it is.

They can't all be winners.  This was ok.  I used this recipe in a chili cook-off based on the rave reviews.  I thought it was "good" but not fantastic and I came in second from last place.  :(

This is a good BASIC recipe. Seasonings are on target except for Cayenne pepper! Use 1/8th IF you like LESS HEAT! It's definitely got some BITE to it. The sour cream can also help with that though as well. I added red, green & yellow peppers, an extra 1/2 onion, as well as another can of dark red kidney beans... I mashed 1 can and left the other can of kidney beans whole for some texture in the chili and instead of water I used beef broth and left the salt out all together that the recipe called for. It turned out to be absolutley delish! =0)

I made this tonight with a few modifications and loved it.  I added fresh garlic with the onions. Diced 1/2 of a large green pepper, 2 carrots cut up. Used chicken stock instead of the water. Added 1 can of Pinto beans, drained and rinsed. Added 1/2 can of Tomato paste and 1 small can of MILD Green Chilies.  Reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp, but that is my taste. Added 1 tsp sugar and about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  I mixed all the spices together and then added them to the onion/turkey mixture after that had cooked.  Mixed thoroughly then added the rest of the ingredients.  I left the lid partially off so that the chili would reduce and get thicker. I left it cook for 1 hour.  IT WAS EXCELLENT

Check nutrition information on ground turkey, make sure it's low fat. Usually they grind the skin in too which means it isn't always as low fat as you might think. Read the label and compare.

Delicious and healthy.  When you read reviews that say too spicy and others that say too bland, it's hard to know what to do - so I cut the chili powder and cayenne in half, and figured I could add some hot sauce or more spice later, if needed (which I didn't need).  I added a can of black beans to stretch it out, and  used only 1 cup of water (with some powdered chicken bouillon), as suggested by others who like their chili thicker.  Also I didn't bother mashing the beans, and I added a fresh tomato  for more tomato texture.  It was wonderful.  I garnished it with fresh cilantro from my garden.  One more note, I don't believe that this yields 8 servings - more like 4, even with cornbread on the side.

This was a good base recipe to start from, but with modifications, it's a 5 star chili!  As others stated, it's too watery as written, so I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce to help thicken & will reduce the amount of water/broth next time to 1 1/2 cups.  Didn't have crushed tomoatoes, so used diced tomatoes instead and really liked having the tomato bits.  I used chicken broth instead of water and added a can of black beans (we like black & kidney beans in our chili), which made the proportion of meat to beans perfect for us.  I also added more chili powder (1 T), cumin (1/2 t), & cayenne pepper (1/4 t) per our preference for spicy!  And to top it off, I added a couple dashes of cinnamon & threw in a jalapeno.  Cooked it for 8 hours in the slow cooker & the result was a delicious & hearty turkey chili!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe tastes so good for being so lean and healthy!  Which of course makes me love it even more. The only thing I'd recommend is adding more beans, it didn't seem like enough so  I added a can of black beans in addition to the kidney and I did not mash them, just added whole which is the only thing I changed.  Just a word of caution though, if you have little ones you may want to cut back on the cayenne just a bit.  My 3 year old couldn't eat it due to it being too spicy but it's perfect for us adults.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly except I had late guests coming in so it simmered on very low for over an hour--I tasted it at the 30 minute mark and it was so so, but after 75 minites or so on low it was SO GOOD! Topped it with cheddar and scallions. Oh, and I used half white and half dark turkey.

This is really good. I followed the recipe for the most part. I did do 1 cup of water instead of 2 because I like it to be thick. I think next time I wont add any water and it would be perfect! We put it on baked potatoes and topped with cheese and sour cream.

This is one of my favorite turkey chili recipes.  I added chopped zucchini, celery and carrots to the onions and garlic so it would be a healthy one pot meal.  I also added cinnamon, one cup of water and left out the cayenne pepper.  All in all, a delicious meal! My husband loved it served with corn muffins.

I love this basic recipe because I can constantly change it by switching beans and vegetables around. My family favorite is not crushing the kidney beans and using a vidalia onion, green pepper, and a red pepper. I add the onions and peppers to saute with the meat along with the minced garlic! My kids LOVE this recipe.

This is the best Chili I have ever tasted and its even better the next day... I found this looking for a healthier version of the foods I love and I am glad I did. I changed very few things such as: I did not cook the ground turkey in Oil I cooked it seperatly then added it to a cooking pot with everything. I also added Carrots, Bell Peppers (Green & Red)... So Yummy....

**New edit: I haven’t been on this website in years and years but today I logged back in to edit this review because after all these years, it’s still my favorite recipe of all-time from AllRecipes. I’m making it tonight and my husband is just as thrilled as always. **

Simple, delicious....absolutely wonderful. I usually make a Texas-style chili because that's what I ate growing up, but I wanted to use turkey and found this recipe. Beans in chili are *wonderful* and I wish I'd tried it before I was so old! made exactly as per the recipe...but I might add some jalapenos next time to give it a bit more of a kick. Thanks for a fabulous recipe...this is going into my favorites. EDIT: I make this recipe so often I don't even need the recipe anymore. I add double cumin and if it's just for us at home, more cayenne. I've taken it to parties, potlucks and made it for my parents and father-in-law, all to rave reviews. It freezes like a dream and makes enough for 7-8 meals for my husband and me. My husband loves it over Fritos with cheddar cheese on top. We *never* get tired of this chili.

This chilli is heavenly! It was perfect; I did leave out the water because I like my chilli a little thick. There were juices from the cooked turkey already so it really doesn't need those 2 cups of water.
This really hit the spot and my "Buttery Corn Bread" (another great recipe on here) went perfect with this!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it is delicious.  It does get better with time, so I was glad I made it five hours ahead of time to let the flavors meld.  Delicious and easy!

This is a GREAT recipe -- so easy!  I just made a few little changes:  I thought it was a little spicy for guests, so I cut both the chili powder and cayenne pepper in half; I doubled the salt (and I'm not a salt fanatic -- this recipe really needs more); also, I thought it could use more beans, so I added 1 (16oz) can of chick peas, you could add another can of kidney beans instead; finally, I served it with shredded cheese and sour cream on top.  Truly, such an EASY recipe, with a great taste -- THANKS!

Excellent recipe! I made only a couple of slight changes but basically the same. I used 2 cans diced toms(15 oz. each) instead of crushed toms - I like tomato pieces in my chili. Also, instead of 2 cups water I used 1 can vegetable broth and 1 can chicken broth. The diced onion (must be a SWEET onion!) I softened in the pot before adding turkey meat, and then added the minced garlic (5 large cloves) right after the turkey had cooked to prevent garlic from burning. I then de-glazed the pot with the vegetable stock before adding all the other ingredients. Better than any packaged chili mix by far! Thank you!

Yum!  One of the best Chili recipes I've tried.  You can't tell its made with turkey.  Do add extra beans and bell pepper.  Since there are only two of us I froze the leftovers and it still tasted great when thawed and reheated.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I loved this recipe. A little spicy, but we love a little kick. I think it would have been just that much better to add a little sour cream. other than that, great recipe. def recommend it :)

Great recipe! Only a few changes - I used chicken broth instead of water for some extra flavor and I added a tablespoon of sugar to counteract the tomatoes' acidity. Serve it up with some shredded cheddar cheese - yum!

I thought this was fantastic!! Although I also made a few changes.  First I sauteed onion and then put in ground turkey. Wait for it to brown a bit, then added garlic and cut up red pepper.  I then added all the spices except Cayenne pepper. I used more chili powder (about 3 tablespoons) and cumin (2 tablespoons) and half a tablespoon for each of the other spices.  I then added 1 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of tomato paste. Then I added a half a can of mashed kidney beans and a half can of mashed black beans and put the rest of the beans I didn't mash in also. I also used 2 cans (14 oz each) of Diced Tomatoes with mild green chilies.  30 minutes later, wow delicious! I topped with 2% Mexican style cheese and light sour cream and paired with Baked Tostitos Scoops. Yummy, and Healthy!

I cooked your chili tonight and cooked it exactly by the recipe, I resisted adding my own touches and I have to say it was VERY good.  I will definitely cook it again and I won't have any problems cooking it by the recipe without any tampering by me.  This is very good Chili and its not many calories at all.  Thank you for sharing with us. It's approximately 150 cals which is roughly 3 points for any of you weight watchers out there.  Good Stuff.

This chili is amazing. I have never made chili before so I was afraid I'd mess up, but this was so simple. And it is delicious! I added a can of pinto beans and some jalapenos. And I used extra lean white turkey. Other than that I followed everything exactly as said. Thanks so much for this recipe. I will definitely make this again.

My family keeps asking for this. Tasty and quick. You can experiment with the spices, vegetables and beans. I find peppers are a great addition. I sometimes eat mine with tortilla chips - I love the crunch.

This chili exceeded my expectations. I doubled the recipe to have leftovers.  I used a bit less cayenne pepper, omitted the salt, added a large chopped green bell pepper when the onion went in the pan, and used one can of rinsed & drained black beans and one can of rinsed & drained pinto beans (don't care for kidney beans).  Really enjoyed the ground turkey in this.  Didn't expect to like it as well as ground beef, but I sure did.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is fantastic chili.  My granddaughter will not eat red meat and this recipe allows her to enjoy chili and still remain true to her diet preferences.  Husband says this is the best ever chili, too.  Wonderful taste and so easy to make.  Five stars is not enough for this recipe.  I did reduce the chili powder by half as we do not like it quite that hot, but that is just our personal preferences and doesn't change the overall quality of the chili.

This was much better than other turkey chilis that I have made.  Only used 1 cup of water and 1 T chili powder-- thanks for posting.  Next time I would use less cayenne, because family doesn't like things spicy.

Incredible! Great taste, simple to make. It's a little meat heavy, so I have made it will less turkey in subsequent times I have prepared this (I'm not a big meat eater) and added more kidney beans. I like to serve this with corn bread casserole.

I liked this chili because it didn't have big hunks of tomatoes, the crushed tomatoes were perfect. I also added some ground Italian sausage and think that the addition of a bell pepper would be nice. I'll add an extra can of beans next time and a little extra chili powder.

My husband and I eat the entire batch each time I make this--and we are not big eaters!!  I've tried this recipesseveral ways. We love it with fresh minced jalepeno peppers, whole kidney beans, crushed tomatoes and beef.  With those modifications, my husband gets excited when I make this dish and tells everybody that I make awesome chili.

I have made this so many times that I have it memorized!  The only things that I changed was that I replaced the water with chicken broth and I leave the salt out all together.  With all the spices and the sodium in the canned beans and tomatoes, it was not necessary.

My husband doesn't like it when I substitute turkey for beef in recipes so I was worried about this recipe but I took some advise from other reviewers plus added a few things of my own and it turned out fantastic.  First I tripled the recipe because I was making it for a Super Bowl party.  I added 1 1/2 T. Texas Steak Seasoning (Montreal would be good too) while cooking the turkey. I also added 1 T. of the minced garlic, 1 green pepper and one red pepper chopped, to add some layers of flavor, along with the onion and cooked with the turkey until the onions were translucent. I added 1 and 1/2 bottle of beer instead of the water (I used Corona) and I substitued 1 can of tomatoes (remember I tripled the recipe) for a can or Rotel tomatoes and a can of Rotel sauce. I substituted one can of the mashed dark red kideny beans with 1 can of chili beans in chili sauce.  I simmered for about an hour and then cooked on low all day. The result.... WOW. Delicious. It has a slight kick but not too spicy for those who don't like that. This will be my chili recipe from now on. No more ground beef. I just won't tell my husband that he's eating turkey chili and he'll be healtheir for it. Note: Tripling this recipe filled a 5 qt. dutch oven. :)

This chili is good but the recipe calls for too much water.  I used 1 ½ cups of water but next time may use a little less than a cup.  I didn’t mash the beans but otherwise followed the recipe as written and the dish was enjoyed by all.

Keep hoping to find a turkey chili recipe that I like. I think the problem is that I simply do not like ground turkey.

I've been using this recipe for quite a while now and I make it at least once every couple of months.      My changes:  Saute your onion and garlic before adding to mixture.  I doubled garlic and oregeno and also dumped in a can of Haganero Rotel.  Ommited Cayenne Pepper (would have been way too spicy)with the Rotel AND I also always use fresh pinto and kidney beans.  NO can's!  Canned beans taste like canned beans.  Makes such a difference.  Just soak your beans in water overnight.  Simmer on low for about 4-6 hours the next day and this recipe is to die for.  Have it simmering on the stove as I type this.  Serve with jalepeno corn bread found on this site.  Amazing!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe and it was easy to make. The second time I added sliced carrots for some extra color. It seems like this recipe could support a lot of extra vegetables if you wanted (although it wouldn't be chili anymore :) ).

I did not care for this recipe.  It's soup, not chili.  I had to put it through a strainer twice to remove all the excess liquid.  Also, it's way too spicy...even for someone who likes spice. Also had to add some chopped green pepper to smooth out the spicy taste and some rice (which I wasn't planning on making) to absorb what was still way too much liquid.  If I make this again, I won't add water (or just a little if needed) and would cut back on the hottest ingredients.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner.  It was easy to put together and required little attention once it was cooking.  I omitted the Cayenne to accommodate one dinner guest that is not fond of "spicy" dishes.  Everyone was pleased with this dish.  I will be putting this on our dinner rotation.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious. After browning the turkey I added the chopped onion and about a cup of chopped celery to the turkey and cooked them until they were soft, then added a can of chicken broth instead of the water. I also added extra a can of chile beans, a can of corn and a can of mushrooms, all drained. Instead of the cayenne pepper I put in several shakes of tabasco sauce. I simmered it for a couple of hours but it still wasn't as thick as we are used to. Next time I would cut back on the water or chicken broth, unless you like it on the runny side.  Good served open pita bread and with a side salad.

Just made this. Used beer & tomatoe sauce instead of water. Used fire roasted diced tomatoes, instead of plain ones,  and added 1 ounce of semi sweet chocolate. It was good.

This recipe was great, the only thing I did differently was add mushrooms the same time I added the onion and added a can of corn near the end. Nice blend of spices.

This is a good starting point for some low carb, healthy chili, but it definitely needs some additions.  I added a can of garbanzos, but next time I will add some celery and maybe some other bean varieties, as well.  This was toward the spicy side, but I wish it had had more flavor. You can't compensate for lack of flavor by adding extra chili powder!  That being said, with a little experimentation this could be a five star dish.

This is a great bowl of chili! I made it for 1&1/2 lbs of turkey & I browned the turkey and got rid of the extra fat.I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and also added a little cinnamon & nutmeg plus a little smoked chipoltle powder & a jalopeno pepper,and a can of black beans. But even if I didn't make any changes this would be a great recipe

I make a similar version of this chili but I add hot turkey sausage (Gianelli's) to the dish.  It really adds more flavor.  I don't like mashed beans in my chili so I wouldn't do that.

The receipe alone is a work of art, but being the person I am I had to make some minor changes. I added 1 btl of sweet red wine, 1 glass while cooking and the rest while eating this most wonderful chili. Thank you AMFISCHER for sharing this with us.

I make this chili ALL THE TIME.  Over the winter I made it at least once a week.  The family loves it!  Though I will admit I use diced tomatoes instead of the crushed,  I just don't like crushed as much as the diced, but the rest of the ingredients are untouched.  Healthy and delicious.

This is a very good recipe.  I prefer ground turkey over ground beef anytime so this was perfect. I substituted vegetable broth for the water.

This is the best chili I've ever made. The seasoning was just right. I added 2 cups extra water since I was using the crock pot and wanted to fill it. Cooked on high for 5 hours. I also added garbanzo beans. Great recipe!

Great recipe.  I used the leanest ground turkey, added some chopped red bell pepper, fresh cilantro, and garnished with shredded lowfat cheeses, fresh chopped jalapeno pepper, green onion, lowfat sour cream and few tortilla strips.  Better on second day.  Next time I will use less water my family likes our chili thicker.  Great recipe though.  So much better than buying the packet of seasoning.  Will make this again!

A good recipe!  One note that I have is that it's important to season the turkey meat in the pot as well, though this recipe does not explicitly call for it.  It's especially good on the day AFTER cooking!  

I actually revised my review today because I use this same recipe (with half water and a few other hot spices) in the crock pot.  I cook it on low for 8 hours, and it is 100%  better that way!  

Slow cooking = one extra star of delicious!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  WE RAISE OUR OWN BEEF SO OFTEN USE % LEAN GROUND BEEF.  TIP: FOR AN ADDED RICHNESS AND MORE HOMECOOKED FLAVOR, I SUBSTITUTE A 14 OZ. CAN OF CHICKEN BROTH FOR THE WATER.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

This chili is so delicious.   I followed one posters advice and cooked it on low in a crock pot for 8 hours.   Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as stated and there were no leftovers.  Will make this one again and again.

Really a stellar, easy chili to make. I used this as a base in a chili-dog casserole and it really was delicious. I highly recommend a spoon of sour cream or plain yogurt to top your bowl of chili off. Yum!!!

Great recipe! I've never made chili before... and it turned out PERFECTLY! I made a few changes to the original recipe..... I left out the olive oil, used canned fire roasted tomatoes, used 2 cans kidney beans, added additional cayenne pepper, added a small can of diced green chilis and topped each bowl off with grated pepper jack cheese. This was so simple and tasty! Serve with corn bread. YUM!Thank you!!!

April 2016- 
This has become my go-to chili recipe! This time I used equal parts ground beef, ground pork and 2 slices pork belly (cut into bite sized pieces). I also used chicken stock instead of water and fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Oh, and smoked paprika.

Top with avocado and crushed tortilla chips.

Made this for Super Bowl this past weekend and it was a hit! Love how easy it was, and the kick of spice! I served it with cheddar cheese and freshly chopped onions rather than the sour cream and it was perfect. Easy to keep warm also in the slow cooker and was perfect for serving.

Not too excited by this. I made it as stated and it was kind of bland. I used leftover cooked turkey breast which may have made a difference and I added some corn and some pinto beans. The sauce was too thin for my liking. I might try it again with some of the adjustments that other reviewers suggested.

This chili was perfect on a cold winter evening.  All I had was a 1 lb bag of dried beans, so I cooked about 1/2 the bag, then mashed about half of that.  I did add some flour by mixing it with the meat and onions just before adding the other ingredients.  I actually ended up needing more water (probably because of the extra beans and the flour).  I used 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and 1 14.5 oz can of diced "chili ready" tomatoes.  I added 1 green pepper and a little more cumin and oregano (I really like those seasonings).  I also used just a dash of cayenne pepper instead of the amount called for, and it was plenty hot enough for us.  My 1 yr old couldn't get enough!  This is definitely a keeper!

This is the best Recipe by far! I have been making changes in my eating habits and was not sure I would like it but this is a winner! I have since made it twice! I am not one who comes on All Recipes and changes everyone's recipes but I don't like spicy hot food so I omitted the cayenne pepper. I followed everything else and it is a perfect recipe that should not be messed with. Otherwise post your own. Thank you for sharing with us.

Really good! It doesn't taste healthy, but it is :) It's very flavorful and substantial.

The taste was good for the recipe but two tablespoons of chili powder made this dish almost inedible!  My husband and I found the dish so incredible hot. Would recommend two teaspoons not tablespoons of chili powder. Very easy recipe otherwise.

Yum! I prepared this meal for my family while following the recipe as is. I thought it was absolutely delicious, and I don't have any complaints. However, I do caution those who are sensitive spicy foods. It has a bit of a kick to it, and my family didn't enjoy that part of it. I prefer spicy foods, so it didn't bother me one bit. Just a heads up.

This chili was delicious!!  Everyone in my family loved it and gobbled it up.  I doubled the recipe and it was gone in two days.  I didn't have cumin so I substituted 4 bay leaves and also added garlic powder.  Like other reviewers, I added 2 yellow peppers and substituted chicken broth for the water.  Although it was on the spicy side, just a spoonful of the sour cream on top of each serving tempered it very nicely. Will definitely make this again and again.

I use turkey instead of beef every time I make chili and no has ever noticed that it wasn't made with beef.  As for the list of ingredients, I just make it easier by using Wick Fowlers Chili Mix.  No need to add oil since the turkey has enough on it own. The mashed beans are a good filler.

I really enjoyed this chili.  The changes I made were: 1 cup of water, added 1 can of chili beans, 1 red bell pepper (diced), 1 tsp cumin and dialed the chili powder down to 1 tsp because we added 2 bird's eye chili peppers from our garden for some heat.  Everything turned out well spiced and well flavored.

Absolutely the best tasting chili. Added uncrushed dark red kidney beans and pinto beans as well. In addition to the tomatoes I put in some FRESH salsa and some nutmeg . Served with guacamole , cheese and lite sour cream.  And only 1 cup of water. A repeat for sure.

This is a really good recipe - tasty but not too spicy.  My 3 year old ate it!  Having read a previous review I only added 1 cup of water and it was perfect, saucy not watery!

awesome this is one of my favorite go to recipes. i would imagine it would be just as good with ground beef for the real meat eaters :) i prefer mine a bit less chunky so i use a hand blender and blend the diced tomatoes first, thats just my preference though. thanks

Very good for a "light" chili! I'm from Texas so I took a star off for the beans. I like beans but chili does not have beans in it. Sorry. The ground turkey went unknown when I served this to my husband, who is a ground beef eater. He had two servings before I told him it wasn't beef! He shrugged his shoulders and kept right on eating...that's the ultimate compliment from him! I used jarred tomatoes from my summer garden and everything turned out wonderful! I omitted the cumin due to an allergy in the household and it was still great! Will definetly make again...without the beans. :)

This is a great chili recipe! DO NOT add two cups of water or it will be a soup. Instead use 2 cans of beans (I use kidney and chickpeas) and do not drain them. This is a restaurant secret.  I also added some diced veggies. Enjoy:)

A great simple and healthy chili recipe.  Used low fat cheddar and low fat sour cream as toppings.  Family didn't realize they were eating turkey instead of beef.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks

This was a really good chili recipe.  I made this without the beans as I am on a diet where I cannot have beans.  In lieu of the beans, I used green and red peppers.  It came out really well and was flavorful.  It would have been better with the beans for sure, but I would also add some peppers just for a little extra taste.  My kids did think it was a little too spicy, so I am going half the cayenne pepper next time.  Otherwise a great quick and easy recipe.

This chili is very good.  I ground up the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I fried it in the frying pan till it started to brown and than added the onions and garlic. It probably had more than a one pound of turke. I left the beans whole only because that is my preference. As far as the flavor goes, if all the ingredients were added in the correct amount, it is perfect.  I totally disagree with those who said it was bland...no way.  It is perfectly seasoned. 
I read some of the negative responses and had to laugh because one person gave it a one star but she said she omitted the chili powder. You can't make chili without chili powder.  This is a 5 star keeper.

What a classic, homemade dish! I doubled the recipe to serve a larger group which made the turkey/onions difficult to cook; they were cooked in batches. The exact measurements of spices still made the chili taste a little bland so I added crushed red peppers, garlic salt and a little more of each spice to taste. I suggest getting sliced sourdough at the market and toast it right before serving ($5 for a loaf). Or if you really want to get fancy, Boudin bakery has their famous sourdough bread loaves you can scoop out and serve your chili in for about $20 for 6 loaves.
The cost of this meal was about $20 (non-fancy night) and it served 5 people (each with seconds) and about 4 servings of leftovers for lunch.

great low fat recipe. I also made some changes, i added a littl bit of chili seasoning because i made the mistake of adding the 2 cups of water so t maintain full flavor i added a quarter packet of low sodium chili seasoning and some tomato paste to thicken it up. I also added extra garlic and used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. Great recipe!

This was great, and super easy to make late night and freeze for tomorrow with lots of room for improv! Instead of water, I added a can of chili beans in sauce and a can of diced tomatoes with green pepper/onion. I also added some stuff I had lying around: fresh red bell pepper, a fresh jalapeno, a can of corn, and instead of kidney beans I used black beans. Dosed it with a good squirt of Sriracha Chili Sauce and it is GOOD!

Perfect red chili recipe.  Only adjustments I made were to omit water, it made the chili very soupy -without water was perfectly thick, and used double the amount of beans, black instead of kidney.  I also added two TBS of brown sugar as suggested by another review, gives it a subtle depth of flavor.  I make this not only with ground turkey but also with meatless veggie crumbles and there is no difference in flavor.  Is amazing the next day.  I serve it with my homemade cornbread, it's a wonderful comforting dinner

My go to recipe for turkey chili!  We'll be having this yet again tomorrow night.  I chop up carrots really fine and add it to the mix.  I also leave out the oil.  I use no salt tomato sauce in place of canned crushed tomatoes.  Ive tried it before without adding the salt and it doesn't work.  I have high bp so try to keep everything low to no sodium but this def needs the 1/2 tsp.  So grateful for this healthy recipe!

I love this fast, easy and affordable recipe!  Great way to "clean out" the pantry and fridge.  It only gets better w/ age too after you make it.

Yum! Added some chopped yellow peppers, used black beans and added 1 can of tomato soup. Then I seasoned it with Penzy's chili seasoning.  I love to toy with the recipes. I omitted the water, used veggie broth because I had some left over. Husband never knew it wasn't ground beef. I won't tell if you won't tell!

Made this last night and it turned out pretty good. I added chicken hot dogs (cut into pieces), you can fry them with the hamburger meat. I also added half a can of stewed tomatoes (my hubby loves them). By the end of the night the chili was all gone!

use ground turkey BREAST for a much leaner meal. Regular ground turkey has just as much fat, and sometimes more, than ground beef.

Pretty good. I added a can of corn, a can of black beans, a bell pepper, and a squash, because I prefer super-chunky chili. I found the two tablespoons of chili powder a touch too spicy, hence the four stars, but that may just be a matter of personal preference.

This was a very easy recipe. I did make a few adjustments. My husband and I like thick chilli so I used 2 lbs of turkey, and 3 cans of diced tomatoes (1 Del Monte chilli style, 1 Del Monte with zetsy mild chilies and 1 Del Monte traditional diced tomatoes), didn't mash kidney beans, added a can of black beans, 2 cans of corn and kept all spices as recipe calls for with the exception of using a red onion. This made a perfect thicker version with just the right amount of spice.

Used beef instead of turkey.  Also used fresh garlic.  A little watery and a tad spicy, but all in all very good!

This was a very nice basic recipe for chili. I can see myself adding to it and making it a little more spicy. It was just right for my two year old, but hubby and myself added hot sauce. I also thought it was a little but runny as written. I might use a bit less water next time.

Awesome chili recipe.  Not too spicy, which was very popular at my house.  I added a can of black beans and also a 4 oz. can of diced green chilis.  In place of the cayenne and cumin, I used Emeril's Southwest Seasoning.  I cooked in the crockpot for 6 hours, and served with shredded cheddar cheese.  Everyone loved it.  I fed 7 people and ther wasn't a drop left.

Delicious!  I added 1 red and 1 green jalapeño (seeded) for heat and a 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes (we like heat at our house).  I sautéed the onion, jalapeños, and garlic and then added the turkey.  I also dropped in 2 or 3 Hershey kisses to balance out the heat.  We loved it... and awesome the next day!

I LOVE this recipe, and so does my family. I've brought it into work and my coworkers really like it. Though I should say that real lightweights can't handle the spice--which to anyone who doens't mind spicey food you wouldn't even know there was anything spicey about it. It's a great recipe and easy to boot!

Love this chili.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time but since then double or triple the amount of seasoning as we like it extra spicy.  Tried it with beef, was ok, but prefer it with turkey.

Made this recipe for the first time last night and it was great! Very simple to put together, didn't take long at all. Everyone enjoyed it! Didn't use chili powder though because I didn't want it to be spicy. It was excellent and I'll definitely be making it more this winter! :)

I made this for the first time in 2010 and I'm still making this! I love this chili! Has the perfect amount of flavor and spice. I puree the kidney beans, if I dont my daughter will eat around them. (typical 2 year old) I also add a can of black beans (pureed) for extra nutrition. By preparing the beans this way, it makes for a thicker chili. My family absolutely loves this recipe and I will continue to make this years to come.

This really is delicious with ground turkey. I always use a large can of tomato sauce and a small can of paste instead of the crushed and a sprinkle of dehyds instead of the chopped onion. I also leave my beans whole and I usually use one can of red kidney and one can of chili beans. Yum!

This was very tasty and very easy to make!  I gave 4 stars only because I took some other reviewers advice and added a can of black beans and usded chicken broth instead of water.  I also added some frozen chopped green & red peppers that I had on hand, just to add a few more veggies.  Hubby and kids all loved it!  I left out the cayenne pepper in the kids' dishes, but definitely had it in mine ;)  Served with shredded colby/sharp cheddar cheese and chips and crackers.  It was a big hit!

i love this recipe!  it's simple and delicious and my husband can't even tell it's turkey and not beef!   couple of small changes: i put the onions in first and cooked them a little w/2 cloves of freshly ground garlic, and then added the turkey meat and browned it. i added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, like some of the reviews suggested. i added a little extra water and a little chicken broth and cooked it on a medium heat for about an hour, stirring frequently.  i also didn't mash all the beans, because i like some of the beans whole. oh, and i definitely used A LOT more chili powder - my husband likes chili powder!

I hate to be the Debbie Downer but this just wasn't what I was expecting.  It's far too spicey for me and the kids to eat.  It's also quite soupy as many mention.  My husband will love this as he loves all things spicey, though, so stars for that!

Not bad, but you can get the same taste using a pre-packaged chili mix with reduced sodium and spend a lot less money on spices.

I've been wanting to make this chili for a while, and today I finally did! Delicious and hearty, with just the right spices. I also made some changes: cut the water in half and used 3/4 of the tomato. I used beef instead of turkey, added an extra can of pinto beans, and mashed about half of all the beans. I Topped it with jack cheese, and munched away with some tortilla chips, guacamole, and salsa on the side.

We just tried this tonight.  Loved it!  We did make a few adjustments by doubling the beans, and adding more paprika and chili pepper.  (Almost doubled)  We added a little cheese on top and served in sourdough bread bowls.   Oh and when we use turkey in places that would benefit from a more "beefy" flavor, we cook the turkey first in Organic Beef Broth.    I will definitely keep this recipe on file.

This is a great base for a chili! I combined the garlic, onions and then I used one green bell pepper and let it cook a bit before adding the turkey.   I also added a can of diced tomatoes (no salt added) because i like my chili chunky. I also used black beans instead of kidney beans and I used corn in  my chili as well. YUM! I went a step further after draining the beans and rinsed them as well just so I could control the salt content even better. To cut the acid of the tomatoes I used a touch of brown sugar.   I will be making this again! :)

I have made this recipe so many times and really love it. I usually use low sodium beef broth instead of water, omit the oil and add 1/2 a medium onion(diced) and 1/2 a bell pepper (red or green, diced). Sometimes for variety, I like to add some corn and substitute black for the kidney beans. I love this recipe!

My kids hate anything with beans in it, so when I saw that the beans in this recipe were mashed, I had to give it a try. I did add 1 chopped red pepper and 1 chopped green pepper, and cut back slightly on the cayenne. I substituted chicken broth for the water. The kids never suspected any beans and they loved it. I will definitly make this again.

I really want to give this a 5, because it was soo delicious with the changes I made. As is, it's absolutely too watery. I used beef broth instead of water--I can't imagine how bland it would be with just plain water. Also, I added another can of kidney beans, crushed the first one, kept the second one whole (without liquid). I put in less chili & cayenne at first as the other reviewers had suggested, but ended up putting in just about the full amount (i just kept on adding another 1/2 tsp. of chili powder until it tasted just right for our tastes) plus another 1/2 tsp. of cumin. I used 1.3 lb. of turkey b/c that's what the package contained. In the end, I was ladling out the excess liquid (tedious!) because the consistency was more like soup, not stew. The end product with all the changes was sooo good, I brought it to a party with cornbread and it was DEVOURED! Nobody could believe it was healthy! Great blend/proportion of spices and I will make this again and again. Thank you!

Made a double batch.  Turned out pretty spicy for us.  Was able to tame it with extra beans and tomato sauce.  Probably should have cut the cyanne after  using chipotle chili powder.

I like thick chili, so I added double undrained tomatoes and beans and didn't add hardly any water. I also dumped in the spices and my family didn't even realize it was turkey! Good healthier option that also was a good trick.

Awesome chili and so good for you!  I only added  1 cup of water because I like my chili on the thick side.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe exactly.  My 4 year old daughter helped me cook the chili and loved the results (especially because she added a little sour cream)!

This is a really good recipe but I felt like it needed a bit more flavor after I tasted the end product.  I added 1/2c ketchup and a package of onion soup mix because that was all I had available, and it was just right. I also left the beans whole and cooked it in a slow cooker for 4 hours on high.  I didn't think it packed  as much heat as the other reviews say it does, but then again, I'm from Texas.  It you like spicy at all, don't back off the pepper.

excellent mix of spices.  I used one can of black and one can of kidney beans and didn't mash either.  I cooked it in the crock pot for about 4 hours, and it was great with some cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.

Good taste when you want a classic, meaty chili.  I added a can of pinto beans and used 1 TB chipolte chili powder and 1 TB regular chili powder.  Spicy and rich for a turkey chili.

The chili turned out really good!  My picky husband told me several times during dinner how much he liked it. I liked the addition of mashing the beans.  It adds another layer of texture to the meal.  The only additional item I added was fennel.  Delicious!

Changes: black beans, garlic powder - all I had.  Added carrots, used red onion instead of white and doubled the cumin (preference)   I started simmering the tomatoes and beans while I sauteed the onion in the Olive oil then added the ground Turkey.  I seasoned the turkey with the spices and then transferred to   tomato and bean summer.  Absolutely delicious.  Will make often.

Great gluten-free basic recipe to put in the crock pot after browning meat; I used an extra can of tomato in place of water and it just fits in the pot, which I love. Had a few "leftover" fresh mini sweet peppers so I threw those in too along with canned Chipotle peppers (chopped) which adds a smoky flavor, but is super spicy so start with one, then wait 1/2 hr before adding more. I served with shredded sow mozzarella cheese(Trader Joes) chopped onion, cilantro, tomato, olive & black corn chips. Huge hit, low fat, gluten-free! Also, Made same recipe vegan with Trader Joe's Vegan ground beef; you need 2 paks, follow same directions, comes out great, and use the soy cheese to serve, vegan heaven!

This was great!! I skipped the oil, and added the garlic when I added the onions. I also replaced the water with chicken broth--one can plus water to make a full 2 cups. I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so used a can of diced tomatoes with chili seasoning. Fabulous served with sour cream and grated cheese. Yum! Thank you for the quick, easy, inexpensive and delicious recipe!

Healthy Chili success! with a few adjustments... First off I doubled the recipe to 16 servings - used red onion instead of regular (sauteed the onion in olive oil first with the garlic & tossed in a chopped green pepper), I browned the ground turkey by itself then combined all once the onions & meat were ready, added a 4oz can of chopped green chiles, a 16oz can of refried beans with green chiles, cut the cayenne in half & used cinnamon for the other half, used one can of black beans & one can of cannellini (did not mash the beans), instead of water, I used one cup of beer & the rest chicken broth.  Followed the rest of the recipe but simmered for three hours, then chilled overnight.  Fantastic!!! It looked like it would be soupy, but after sitting overnight it turned out to be perfect! Will DEFINITELY use this again & thanks to those that suggested some of the adjustments I made.

This is a great quick and easy recipe. I did reduce the water to 1 cup and added an additional can of kidney beans - drained and rinsed but not mashed. It came out the perfect consistency. Perfect recipe for those fall days.

I made some alterations and it turned out great!  I used a 1.25 lbs of turkey, substituted the water for chicken broth (1-1.5 cups would have been plenty), added a can of corn and black beans (both drained and rinsed), and a can of diced green chilis.  I also added a little more chili powder and cumin then didn't add the paprika or cayenne.

This was a pretty ok recipe, but I've made much better on my own.  I didn't mash the beans, added a can of pintos, and omitted the cayenne (we have a family of weenies who don't love the heat, lol). Good standby recipe.  :)

Simple yet very good. I made mine in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours and an extra big can of Bush's chili beans.

I tweaked this recipe a bit, but absolutely loved this! I started by sauteing leftover bacon pieces, (I added a little bit of EVOO too) then threw in the ground turkey, a softball sized red onion (chopped) and one chopped green bell pepper. I cooked it until veggies were tender and turkey was browned. I threw in all of the spices and cooked the mixture for a few minutes (to set in the flavor) Then I added the tomatoes, one can of kidney beans, one can of chili beans, and (instead of water) one can of low sodium chicken broth. I brought it up to a boil and simmered for at least 30 minutes. I turned off the burner and let it thicken as it cooled a bit. Excellent! I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! made some changes... marinated the turkey with some worcestershire sauce then followed as directed, but added some chicken stock instead of water and also used lentils instead of beans (don't like  beans) and It came out so good!!!! will def make this over and over again.

This was a HIT!  I slightly modified it based on prior reviews and also to accommodate preparing it in the crock pot.  I omitted the olive oil since I wasn't going to be sauteing it.  I doubled the recipe but used only one onion and only 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the recommended amount of water.  I used smoked paprika instead of regular.  Omitted the cayenne and black pepper because I have sissy's in the household lol.  And I added 1 can of diced green chilis without the juice and one diced red bell pepper.  Put it in the crock pot on high for 4 hrs.  It was sooooo good everyone was asking for the recipe!!  The only thing I'll do different next time (and there WILL be a next time) is to add another can of beans, a little more salt and consider omitting the broth altogether because I like it a little thicker yet!

Loved this...very easy.  I modified it just a bit.  I used only 1 cup of water, 1 can red kidney beans and 1 can of black beans.  I also added a package of cubed firm tofu (in addition to the turkey).  The chili turned out great and is a hearty meal all by itself.

I think it is simply the best!I usually make chili with beef but turkey is the key and I really liked it. Try it and you'll like it! My favorite part of this recipe is topping it with sour cream and cheese with tostitos. Mashing up the kidney beans is a good thing to do, it makes the chili nice and thick like a dip.

I LOVE this chili! First time making chili and needed to use up some ground turkey in the fridge, what a pleasant surprise! I've made it 5 or so times and it always turns out better when I follow the recipe (I'm prone to tweaking recipes) for the spices but I cut back on the cayenne and use mild chili powder, add corn and small diced carrots (the sweetness is a nice change) and celery to add a veggie punch. Freezes well too! :)

I was excited to try out this recipe based on all the positive reviews. However, I have to agree with the other one star reviewers.  Watery, bland but too hot - way too much chili powder, and I even cut the cayenne in half - but no other flavor than that. I also should have used dark ground turkey rather than ground turkey breast.  Too bad, as I usually love chili...

Loved this! The only things I did differently were to brown the onion/garlic before I browned the meat. I also doubled the amount of spices, except for the cayenne pepper and chili powder. Used red beans instead and left them whole. Added some fresh cilantro, too. Very, very good!

I thought I'd give this a try because of the rating but must admit it looked rather "simple" to be much of anything.  Surprise!  This is really good and very flavorful.  I cut back a tad on the chili powder because I use Penzey spices - still has a nice kick to it.  I'll be keeping this recipe close by for future use.

Just like the name suggested it is simple and easy to make and very delicious. The recipe was very good just as written but only change I made was adding one more of chopped onion to suite my taste. I garnished mine with dollop of sour cream, thinly sliced hot chili peppers and served with potato wedges that's sprinkled with sea salt and and dried oregano.I'll definately come back to recipe again and again.

After surfing the web and reviewing other chili recipes, I used the spices here as written and think it worked very well.  Otherwise, I did make some substitutions:  1/2 lb ground turkey + 1/2 lb of ground pork sauteed in little olive oil, minced garlic onion and S&P to taste; sauteed one small green and red pepper with [a tad more] onion and one celery stalk until fragrant and softened, combined meat and veggie mixtures -- added one can each of drained pinto and black beans; also added only (1)  ~ 15 oz can of tomato sauce and (1) ~ 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes -- added the spices and simmered as written.  Really good, not too soupy (don't like soupy chili), just "enough" liquid for us -- topped off with freshly shredded mild cheddar, fresh cilantro [this makes the dish come alive], and sour cream.   Really good, even on a warm summer's day.

I would definitely use this spice mixture again.

I've tried a dozen chili recipes this year in search of the one that tastes delicious, doesn't weigh me down with carbs, and has a good protein content. THIS IS IT!! I've tried a couple of variations, but the original recipe is really the one that rocks! Thanks!

I really liked this recipe and it was perfect for a weeknight meal. I did make a few changes: I used 1 3/4 cups of water and a little over 1/4 cup of red wine. I mashed one can of kidney beans and then added another can of beans w/o mashing. I also only used 1 T. of chili powder and I didn't have any cumin, so that didn't go it. I did give it a sprinkle of cinnamon (sounds weird, I know). Turned out great.

Awesome!  I added a 4 oz can of mild green chilies, one additional 16 oz can of kidney beans and I used diced tomatoes as opposed to crushed tomatoes.  No need to search for any other turkey chili...it doesn't get any better than this.

Delicious! I only used 1 cup of water and followed the rest of recipe as is.  I served it topped with shredded cheddar, chopped fresh chives, and a dollop of sour cream. YUM!

I love this recipe because it's so simple to make and has become one of our family's favorite healthy dishes! We finally decided to double up & keep some in the freezer which is great to have on hand for those nights you don't feel like making anything or don't have time. It's a little on the spicy side for me (my husband & daughter think I'm a wimp & they're probably right). But they love it. A couple minor changes I made was instead of mashing the kidney beans, I added another can, and also reduced the water by about 1/2 cup.  Other than that it's perfect, and I have to add that I'm not super handy in the kitchen, so if I can make this good, anyone can!

Excellent and healthy too! Used diced tomatoes since I had those and one can had diced green chiles which added a bit of zing.

I've made this twice and been very pleased with the results.  You can add ground coriander (1/2 teaspoon) to the list of spices to add yet another subtle element.  The local groceries here sell ground chipotle pepper and I recommend adding that as well.  Mashing the kidney beans?  Not really important.  This chili is simply delicious, and I always make enough to ensure some is left over.  After an overnight in the fridge, it's even better.  My signif other, who grew up in Mexico City, heartily approves.

Great recipe for a basic chili!  I only eat turkey & chicken, so I need a good, easy chili recipe -- this is it!  I do add a tablespoon of Tastefully Simple's Seasoned Salt, and also a tablespoon of Tastefully Simple's Wahoo Chilli :)  It kicks it up a notch!!!  Thanks for this great recipe!!

I give five stars not because its the best thing I've ever eaten, but because for Turkey Chili, this is amazon.  Very very yummy and super easy - not a ton of ingredients.  And a very healthy recipe I might add!

So good and tasty.  I just add 1/2 cup of less water to make it more hearty and a little less of the cayenne pepper.  Instead of rice, I pour it over baked butternut squash bowl.  Yummy!

I'm not usually a big chili fan because I don't like the texture of beans.  This was a hit with the entire family.  I liked that there were not any chunks of beans, they were mashed.   My picky son even requested it for dinner not even a week after I made it.  I will definately be making this again!

i tried this recipe and it was good except it was way to spicy for me so this is what i changed the second time i made it:

instead of a full can of crushed tomatoes, i used 14 oz crushed tomatoes and 14 oz mild chunky salsa.  
i omitted the chopped onion (since there is onion in the salsa) and omitted the cayenne pepper because it was way too spicy the first time i made it.

i also used mexican oregano and added 2 heaping tablespoons of flour to thicken it up.  

i also used low sodium beef broth instead of water.

loved this chili, super easy and delicious. I used a half red onion and added that and minced garlic while browning the turkey. Instead of water, added 1 cup chicken broth, didn't mash the kidney beans and added a dash of cinnamon along with the other spices! YUMMMMMYYYYY!

This is a delicious hearty healty chili recipe that is as good and any unhealthy version I have had.  There is no flavor difference with the ground turkey.  I used a can of undrained black beans, 1/2 tsp of beef broth and then a little corn starch to thicken.  It was especially good the next day.  I did not use cayenne.

This was the first chili recipe I ever made and EVERYONE loved it! What a huge hit!

I would, however, not add in water so that the chili is thicker.

Simple to put together. Turkey definitely does not add as much flavour than ground beef, and I had to omit the beans as we are on a special diet. I like how spicy this dish is with the 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper! Great healthy dish to have!

this is a great starting point.  I altered quite a bit.  I have never made chili before but love it.  I omitted the olive oil and water because I like a thicker chili.  I did add 1 cup of chicken broth because of everything else i added it got a little bit too thick.  I used all of the spices and then added 4 stalks of celery, a can of corn, parsley, 5 jalapenos, 1 green pepper, can of green chilis garbanzo beans, 4 roma tomatoes and used 4 garlic cloves.  It is in the crock pot right now and smells amazing and my little sample tastes have been great!  I am excited to scoop up a bowl and top with cheese and a small spoonful or sour cream.

I have finally found a great recipe for chili!  THANKS!

Love this recipe!! I am not a huge chili fan but this recipe is perfect for my family and just right on the spice if you only like a "little heat". Topped it with cheese and served it with cornbread for a great meal I make several times a year.

Delicious! I did add the following thou:  1 red and 1 green pepper, 1/2 cup chopped celery, 1/2 cup green onions and some parsley. I fried it all up with the onions, garlic and turkey.  I also added mushrooms in the end and did NOT add water and it came out great.!   I guess this is a whole new recipe with my additions, but its a great starting point!

Easy to make and delicious.  Made a few minor tweaks based on what I read in some of the reviews.  Included 2 green peppers, 2 jalapenoes (seeded), 4 cloves of garlic, 1 can of pinto beans (drained and rinsed), 1 can of chicken broth rather than 2 cups of water.  I also doubled up on all the spices except salt.  Didn't mash the beans.  Will make this again real soon.

I have been using this recipe over and over again. It is super easy and the results are fantastic. Over time I have altered it a bit to include carrots and chicken as well as not mashing the beans and not adding the water. It also seems to be better the next day after it all thickens up. I also get tons of compliments on it saying it's the best chili they've had.

This recipe was easy to prepare.  I only used 1 cup of water to prevent it from being to watery.  I only used 1/2 of the suggested amount of cayenne pepper to prevent it from being too spicy.  My special touches were to add a pinch of cinnamon and a spoonful of brown sugar.  The sweet and spicey mix came out amazing.

Made this for dinner for My husband, 5 and 6 year olds, and myself. It was delicious!! Previous reviews mentioned little flavor, and too much water. After browning the meat and onion, i added all ingredients to my slow cooker, on high, for 2 hours. I doubled the seasonings and garlic, and added 1/2 C. Chicken Broth instead of 2 cups water. Served with homemade cornbread. Absolutely wonderful! Great leftovers as well.

Very simple and Tasty. Browned my turkey and veggies in a pan then threw everything into a crockpot to cook while I was at work. - Did take the suggestions from others and omitted the water for a thicker chili. Added extra beans and some red and green peppers. :)

my kids liked it but I really didn't. Maybe  it was the paprika, but something didn't taste right.

I followed the recipe to the "T" and thought it had no flavor other than just being too spicy. I ended up adding tomato paste, beef broth and a little bit of sugar and it was still so-so. Will not use this recipe again.

This was fantastic. The second day, the chili was even better. Incredibly simple to make. Would also make a great dip. Throw in some tortilla chips!

I decided I wanted to make chili despite the fact that my husband hates all types of beans, because I'm trying to introduce as many foods as possible to my 2 year old daughter.  I found this recipe and decided to try it because it suggests mashing the beans.  My husband and I both thought it was delicious, and my toddler ate it as a "dip" with bread and pita chips.  I substituted tabasco sauce for cayenne pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It wasn't at all bland as I feared it might be, and the turkey was a nice healthy alternative.  There will be more than enough left over for dinner tomorrow night, and I'll definitely be making this again.

Thanks for a great turkey recipe.  My sons are allergic to beef and pork.  I use a lot of turkey products.  This recipe would even be a good base for Chile tacos.  Thanks again.

Enjoyed this recipe.  Made it with ingredients I already in the pantry:  chopped celerty and canned green beans instead of kidney beans, tomato juice instead of water, heaping T of Penzey's Chili 3000 spice mix, 2 T dried chopped onions (I was out of fresh onions), garlic powder (fresh minced is always better).  Served with sour cream, mexican cheese, corn tortilla chips and green onions.

I made this without beans since I'm on a no carb eating plan, and it was great. I think there might have been a little too much cayenne and since there was no beans I should have used less water. Regardless, it was delicious.

This was outstanding.  I added 1/2 lbs. more ground turkey because I like a lot of meat and also chopped up two ripe plum tomatoes after removing the meat of the tomatoes.

Hubby and I put enjoyed, I took a few recommendations on change, but not much. I used about 1.25lb turkey, that was size of container, reduced water to 1 cup (this was perfect) and added a can of pinto beans as well.  I mashed half the pinto and half the kidney beans, and put the rest in whole. Doubled my garlic, all other spices remained the same.  I did end up simmering it for about 90 mins, waiting for hubby to get home. Looking forward to leftovers since everyone says this is so much better the next day! Topped with shredded cheddar and reduced fat sour cream.

Wow!  Wonderful!  My husband just went back for thirds!  I used lean ground turkey, doubled the cumin, only 1/4 tsp of cayenne and only 1 cup of water.  It packed a good punch and was just the right consistency.  I added a can of drained corn and so glad I did.  I served with shredded cheese and low fat sour cream.  Sooo yummy!  Thank you for the recipe, I'll be making this frequently.

Fairly good stuff but I think it could use more flavor.  Except for liquifying tomato and onion (personal preference of not liking these chunks), I made this as is.  Turkey is very bland and needs extra flavor beyond the normal - I could have about doubled the spices.  From the reviews, using chicken broth sounds like a good idea, and cooking the spices with the turkey.  I also wonder if using cut-up turkey would be better than ground?  (A side note from something I read: you can get ground white meat which is not as fattening, but it is expensive.)  So a good starting point, but just needs "something" else done to make it really good - I've had many turkey/chicken chili's so I have a lot to compare .  Cheese and sour cream on top were good additions.

The title of the review says it all.  It truly is very simple turkey chili, but very delicious too!  I modified it depending on what I ran out of.  :)  For example, sometimes I didn't have paprika so I just used extra cayenne.  I also put half a can of kidney beans (low sodium) and half a can of black beans (also low sodium).  Tasted yummy!

Excellent!  I have never tried turkey chili, so was a little hesitant.  Only changes I made was not mashing the kidney beans, adding black beans, and used vegetable stock instead of water (and used less because I like it thick).  I topped it with sour cream and fresh cilantro - definately a keeper.

Added green and yellow bell pepper and squash 20 minutes before eating and it was delish!  This is a fool proof recipe.

Great recipe if you use 1 cup of water.  The other modifications I made were as follows: 1) used 1 1/2 onion, 2) used 1/4 t cayenne pepper, 3) used 2 cloves of garlic, 4) mashed half of the kidney beans, and 5) added one big green pepper.

I also sauteed the garlic and onions.

I really liked this recipe.  Despite adding less water than called for I found it runnier than I prefer.  Here is what I added for thick rich chili...1 6oz can tomato paste, green pepper, a tomato, a jalapeño (I omitted the cayenne) and lastly a square of dark chocolate...it was awesome.

I've been making a very similar recipe for years but really like the addition of paprka and oregano in this recipe! Like others mentioned, I use chicken broth instead of water & add a little tomato paste. This may sound WEIRD but a little dab of peanut butter adds a great flavor to the chili.

Yummy! Chili success. :) I have made chili several times but this was the best and much healthier. As some other reviewers say I also used half the water. In addition, I added a can of chili beans and cut the tomatoes in half and added a 6oz can of tomato paste. I also sauteed the onions and garlic first then added the turkey.

I love this recipe b/c it is a great base to make a healthy, delicious meal from. With original additions and slights changes you can make this chili your own. I myself did not have a can of crushed tomatoes in the pantry so I substituted a can of basil & oregano tomato paste, and a can of stewed okra, corn, & tomatoes, in it's place. It came out amazing...though next time I might go a bit easier on the chili powder.

Great recipe - I use it all the time.  It can be a little watery (depending on what type of crushed tomoatoes I use) - but I added in some elbow macaroni which made it even hardier.

Wonderful!!!  I used black beans instead of pinto and cooked this in my slow cooker for about 8 hours on low.  It was so flavorful and the perfect dinner on a super cold night.

This is recipe is phenomenal and very easy to make. After reading other reviews, the only thing I tweaked was using less water as I don't like my chili to be too soupy. I served the chili with lowfat sour cream and lowfat shredded cheese and everyone in my house loved it. I will definitely make this again.

This was my first time making chili and it turned out really good.  As others have posted I also made some changes as follows:  mashed only half of the beans, added additional Tblsp of chili powder, and a big splash of hot sauce.  I also found it to be a little watery so I added about 5 saltine crackers for a thicker consistency. I topped it with sour cream, green onions, and shredded cheddar cheese. Yum.

I also added red pepper flakes and fresh jalapenos for that extra kick and it was delicious. I used my croc pot and had it on high for 3 hours and then let it simmer on low for another 1 hour. I added an extra can of kidney beans which I didn't mash. I'm adding this dish to my recipe book.

Great Recipe! I didn't crush the Kidney beans, and I added sliced onions because in my opinion the chunkier the better! All the spice measurings worked perfectly!

The Chili was okay, a little spicy for my tastes, I really like spicy mexican food and the hottest salsa, but it comes to chili, I like it a little more milder. My mom seemed to enjoy it because she likes hotter chili and milder mexican food lol. I did add some of my own ingredients such as a zucchini and a half, about a cup and a half of butternut squash, a can of black beans, and a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon. I really liked my additions because I love a lot of vegetables and beans in my chili. However, the cinnamon could have been left out but that was my fault. Also despite the additions I still felt the chili was a bit too soupy and could have been a tad thicker, so I would suggest cutting down on the water.

This is a good recipe to start with if you are trying to figure out what kind of chili fits your family... make your tweaks based on this recipe.  My husband wants to double the beans (and don't mash them) and reduce the tomatoes in half.  There are not a lot of other "flavors" going on in this chili... other than chili.  Check out the "Bilermaker Tailgate Chili" for other things you can add for a more well-rounded flavor.

Made this tonight for Halloween dinner and it was delicous! After carving our pumpkins I used some of the fresh pumpkin meat in this dish... just diced it up and added into the skillet at the fist stage of cooking (with the onions, peppers an garlic). I made several changes that redesigned the dish, but loved it afterwards... still, I couldnt taste the pumpkin - but as  diced veggie it was a nice textural addition. I only used half the recommended turkey and added beans and corn for extra veggies, even so, I still felt there was more than enough turkey for the dish. The addition of cumin and nutmeg as recommened by other reviews was a great idea and gave this some much needed flavor.  All told, I changed this so much it isnt fair to rate the original - so I'll go halfway at 3 stars for being a good starting base.  Ultimately this is what went in my version:  about 2 cups fresh diced pumpkin as noted above; 1/2 white onion;  1 each red and green bellpepper (finely diced);  1 clove minced garlic;  1/2 lb ground turkey;  1 can diced tomatoes;  1 can low-sodium chicken stock;  1/2 small can of tomato paste;  1/2 tsp each: salt, pepper, nutmeg, cumin 4 tablespoons chili powder;  1 can each: corn, kidney beans and pinto beans (drained)

The best chili recipe I've found by far.  I even add extra veggies in it to make it more complex (bell peppers, carrots, & jalapenos).

Not my favorite chili.  I found it to be a little watery and a touch bland.

This was delicious.  The only thing I changed was I added an additional can of Kidney Beans.  Thanks for an awesome, healthy recipe!

I loved but did change some things around.  I should have added all the cayenne pepper but I don't like things to spicy. Next time I will add more onions, garlic and salt to spice it up some more.

I love the spice in this recipe. Tweaked it a bit: added 1 yellow onion and a few cloves a of garlic to the turkey while browning. Threw in more tomatoes from the garden, a few small green peppers, used garbanzo & black beans instead, splashed with organic chix broth & added 1/2 bag of frozen corn. Threw in my crock pot for 4 hours on high. Topped with non-fat fage Greek yogurt. yum! Perfect fall dish.

This is a good starter chili.  I like chili with a lot of veggies so I added jalapenos, green pepper, can of corn, and a can of diced tomatoes.  Yum!

Delicious, and I love using ground turkey breast instead of ground beef.  I used a clove of elephant garlic, and it worked great without making it too garlicky.  I also added an extra can of beans.  I would not add so much water, next time since quite a bit of liquid can come out of the can of tomatoes, the turkey and the onion during cooking (maybe more like half a cup of water if any).

Made as directed but did not mash the beans. It was great!   The secret is in the spices.  If your's are old they won't have the flavor.  I used Penzey's Chili 3000..it was almost too hot!   Will add veggies next time and might try the slow cooker.  Definitely a keeper.

Really enjoyed this hearty meal! I followed helpful reviews to brown the turkey and remove from pan; cooked onions and garlic in oil until tender and then combined everything. I didn't have kidney beans so I used pink and mashed only half. Added black beans and corn and only used one cup of water. I might cut back on the cayenne and chili powder next time. And a warning: as a leftover, it gets spicier with time!!!

This was delicious!  I only added half the water and included an extra can of beans that I didn't mash.  I only gave this four stars because no one thought it had any heat... not even a hint.  I'll definitely use this recipe again, but it definitely needs some tweaking.

This was okay...very watery like many people have mentioned, and I only added one cup of water.  I felt like it was missing something, but it was definitely spicy.  I will probably try a different recipe next time.

I didn't like this at all. Too watery, and way too bland! The meat is too tender for a pleasant texture in such a soupy mix. Chili should be much thicker, heartier, and spicier than this recipe.

This was SO good! Like others, I made a few small adjustments - used half the amount of water, doubled the kidney beans and didn't mash them, and was heavy handed with the spices because we like it spicy. We topped it with a dollop of sour cream and some cheese and served with cornbread. This will definitely be added into the rotation!

Quick and easy. I followed the directions exactly as written, but when I found it to be an average tasting chili recipe, I decided to throw in some Mexican cheese for additional flavor.

I made this for my boyfriend for dinner one night and we both loved it! I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I just added some red pepper flakes and it was just the right amount of spice for us, other than that it was great just how it says!

Very good recipe.  I make this alot with a few changes: As another reviewer suggested, I only mash half the can of beans and leave the rest whole...also I add about a cup of frozen corn and  an ounce of unsweetened chopped chocolate in right near the end for a nice mole' flavor.  I serve this over spaghetti or rice and top each serving with some shredded low fat cheddar.  Easy, quick, healthy, and tasty.  What more can you ask for?!

I make this every week, my husband loves it!  I like to chop up some red or green peppers to add to the heartiness.  I also use 2 cans of kidney beans rather than one.  I like a lot of filling/less juice.  Perfect for parties!

this was a great recipe for someone like me who has never made chili before.  It turned out so good.  I did make a few changes per some the the reviews of other people before me. I added 1 cup chopped of each veggie, celery, rutabaga, and half of a red bell pepper.  I also used less water, instead of 2 cups I only used one cup and than for some extra taste I added one cup of "Yellow Tail Merlot".  Also added to the species I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon than let it simmer for 2 hours so the veggies had time to cook.  It worked out great and my roommate loved it.  It was just enough spices and a little extra with the additions.

This was my first time using turkey in chili and I wasn't disappointed!  I didn't have crushed tomatoes but I used a whole box of tomato puree and it was fine, just not as chunky as I usually like.  I also added a bit of cinnamon.  Thanks!

This was great and easy dish to make, my boyfriend and I like it very much!! I'll keep making it, but..... use less water (maybe 1 cup, but look at other reviews, I'm a rookie in the kitchen). I'm also adding more veggies next time! Bon appétit!

Snaps for AMFISCHER! A really good and simple receipe. I made it even easier, used a store bought rotiss chicken. I sauteed the onion for a few minutes, added the cooked chicken and covered it with all the spices. I added the garlic and beans and used chicken broth not water and let it simmer about an hour with chopped carrots and celery. Very nice dinner, thanks.

This is a great chili recipe--plus it's pretty healthy!  It was spicy, but not too spicy (for me).  I followed some of the other suggestions to make it thicker (1 C. water), added a can of black beans, plus a small can of tomato paste.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

very good and healthy!  The only thing I didn't do is mash the beans.  I like mine whole.  So to thicken it up I mixed a little flour and water and added it in at the end.  Topped with cheese, sour cream, green onions and cilantro.

Yum! Yum!  I did some variations...I used the crock pot.  I used left over New Years turkey, didn't mash the kidney beans and through in a can of black beans.  I also added 2 extra cloves of garlic.  Mine turned out more a stew than chili, but was excellent.  GREAT flavor!  I cooked it 3 hours on high and 3 hours on low.

Great starter chili.  Iadded carrots, zucchini, squash, green and yellow peppers, black beans and a can of diced tomatoes.  I like my chili chunky, not soupy, so I didn't include any water.

A first rate recipe.I added chick peas (personal preference) and didn't mash the kidney beans. It stretched a pound of turkey a long way.

Good flavor, but tooooo watery....two cups of water was way too much...I guess I just like my chili a bit thicker.  I added cornstarch and condensed tomato soup, but it was still not thick enough. it was just so-so.

Really good stuff! I made this on a whim I had a lb. of turkey I needed to use. I used one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans. I seasoned the turkey with Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and a dash of my favorite hot sauce. Also, added a good bit of italian seasoning, extra cumin and a touch of cinnamon. This was different from your everyday chili, richer not as tomato based. I loved it!!

I loved this!  I changed a few things up a bit to fit my own tastes, but the basic recipe is a winner.  I used one can kidney beans and one can chili beans (we love lots of beans in our chili).  I didn't add any water, and I used one can diced tomatoes, and one can tomato sauce.  Served with jalapeno cheddar corn bread, and it was delicious!!

A great, easy recipe!!! The only changes I made were to add a whole onion and two green peppers. I also used an organic tomato sauce that had onions and green peppers already in it. I put the chili in a slow cooker for several hours and it was wonderful! Even better the next day!

I followed the recipe just like it said to do and was disappointed.  All I could taste was spice.  This might be ok w/ some alterations, like less chili powder.

So when we made this recipe we didn't have the 28 oz can of crushed tomato. Instead I used a 14 oz can of diced tomato, 8 oz can of tomato paste,  chopped fresh green bell pepper, and 3 small mediumish tomatos. This gave the Chilli a fresh taste. It was sooo delicious! When we made this chilli the way the recipe states, we liked our way better! Goes great with honey cornbread :)

This was very good.  I added some more spices like cinnamon and cocoa.  It turned out hot spicy so I may use less cayenne pepper next time.

I reduced the water by one cup, otherwise I felt it would have been too soupy.  Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe without any changes.  A little too spicy for me; next time I will cut back on the chili powder. My hubby liked it and went back for seconds.  We topped it with a little light sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.

This is great! I gave it four because I changed a couple things to fit my taste, but kept the same idea of the recipe. Firstly I scaled the recipe in half but still used a full can of crushed tomatoes and beans. Also I used pinto instead of kidney beans since I don't really like kidney beans. Once I seasoned as directed I found it to be a little bland, so I doubled the salt and the cumin. Also added about 1 tablespoon of sugar cause I like a little sweeter sauce. Top it off with cheese and sour cream and it was delicious!

We have made a similar recipe with Girl Scouts on campouts and it is a big hit.  The Colemans talked about making it not so soupy, so add a tablespoon or two of masa close to the end and it thickens it up.  Don't let it cook too long afterwards as it continues to thicken.  We use tomato sauce as a lot of the girls don't like tomatoes and used a combination of kidney beans and black beans.  I like the idea of using some tofu which one reader suggested, will try that next time.

This was a flavorful tasting basic chili recipe.  We didn't drain the beans nor crushed them, and for additional liquid we added a can of chili tomato sauce (vs. water).  It was a big hit.

This was my first time making chili and I can't believe how easy this was.  I used a red onion, if it makes any difference, added a bit of bbq spice, and a bay leave while simmering.  I love how hearty and filling it is for the fact that its turkey.  Will definitely make again and again

the recipe produces a watery chili.  try adding some corn starch to thicken it up.  also top it with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.   serve with corn bread muffins.

OK- now that I've made this more than once, I've upped my rating.  It will be my standard chili.  I cut back like other reviewers to 1 1/2 c water; added more diced tomatoes.  It's a pretty flexible chili but very tasty.  Healthy too.

This is a really good simple and CHEAP chili to make.  I took some to a pot luck last week and everyone ate it up.  Tastes extra good with some sharp cheddar, red onion and a dallop of sour cream on top with corn bread on the side.

This is really good chili!  I omitted the olive oil because ground turkey has so much moisture, it doesn't really need it.  I also doubled the beans and used several different kinds of beans; kidney, chili and pinto.  You could put almost anything in this recipe; veggies, a small amount of pasta, etc. It is not heavy or "greasy" in any way. This recipe has a little more liquid than typical chili, but that makes it great for cornbread (see Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread on this website). This will become a regular for my household.

This was very good chili.  Mine did not turn out too spicy, but I didn't have cayenne pepper. I added extra chili powder to give it a bit more flavor.  I think I will invest in some cayenne pepper and try this recipe again.  I will definitely be making again.  Very good flavor and so simple to make.

This is one recipe where you have to use turkey meat- it doesn't cover up the flavors like hamburger meat does. I'm not a huge fan of turkey meat but this was incredible. This is our staple chili recipe now. It is spicy so make something else for the kiddos.

Really good & healthy too! Not to mention easy. I added tomato paste as someone else did & did not mash the beans. I used the 2 c. water, but added 1 more as it was a little TOO thick. Omitted cayenne & added extra 1/2 t. cumin. I think next time I will add another can of beans. Thanks!

Great recipe! My husband and I enjoyed it and got a lot of leftovers out of it. I added a teaspoon of sugar to balance the flavors. Next time, I'll add some corn.

This recipe is fantastic!

Following previous reviewers suggestions, I use only 1/2 cup of water, which made the chili turn out really thick! I was out of fresh garlic so I substitued 1/4 tsp of garlic powder. I also added a few shakes of cinnamon to this recipe as well. 

Highly recommended!

Double the cayenne pepper, I love spicy.    Used buy premixed chili packets.  Never again.  So easy a caveman can do it!

Due to the great ratings, I had high hopes for this recipe but was very disappointed. It was too soupy, even with 2 cans of beans. HOT was the only seasoning I could even taste. I'll stick to my usual off-the-seasoning-packet chili.

This was awesome! The only thing I did different was use dried onion and added some red pepper flakes.  The texture was perfect-on the thicker side.  This will definitely be a recipe I use over and over.  I think some of the thickness came from mashing the kidney beans-NEVER would have thought of that!  Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe! You could not even tell that it was a healthy version with turkey! The only thing that I did differently was to add an extra can of kidney beans and I also did not mash them.  The recipe was a little too spicy for my husband but I enjoy a spicy chili.

This recipe was super easy to make and it was 'delicious'.  I've used extra lean ground beef to add more heartiness to this chili and it tasted excellent.  I also added my own special twist - I serve this chili over angel hair pasta and top with a shredded mexican cheese blend.  I made it at a dinner party and my guests were VERY impressed - I was getting compliments all evening!!!

Thank you for the great jumping board for making my own turkey chili.  I add a few different seasonings, beans and such, but this was my foundation.  It's getting entered into a laid back contest at a charity disc golf tourney this weekend--so wish me luck!

This was very good and easy to make. It was a little spicy, which was actually a good thing because ground turkey can tend to be so bland. I enjoyed this and will make again.

The recipe as written is 3/5 stars. It’s a great base recipe. I made it exactly as written first, found it to be kinda bland, so I tweaked from there. It definitely needs personal touches. Any type of canned tomatoes take a long time to cook down, so I mashed them too to help break up the fibers. Also, mashing the beans is part of the secret to getting that thick chili soup consistency. Like most soups and stews, the longer you simmer, the better the flavors develop. I’d be hard pressed to find a recipe that calls for 30 min or less simmer time that actually turns out really good lol. For me, the longer it simmers, the better it tastes. If you’re short on time, don’t expect miracles.

I've made this twice and it's a hit at my house! I disagree with those who say it's bland - I think the flavor is just right as written. As a number of others have recommended, I do leave out the water, and replace it with a second can of diced/crushed tomatoes, and add a can of tomato paste - excellent consistency this way! Thanks for the great recipe!?

I have been making this for years. Everyone I have served it to gobbles it up. As written is good, but over the years, I have perfected my version.  1st thing in my pot is a tablespoon of olive oil and a 1/2 pkg of cut up turkey bacon til crisp. Then I brown the turkey meat.  To that goes the onion & garlic. I adjust the cayenne based on who's eating it. I also use smoked paprika when I have it. I do use the 2 cups of water, but add seasoned tomato paste to thicken. At the end of simmering time, I add about 3/4 of a diced orange bell pepper & a 14oz can (drained) sweet corn. It cuts through the heat so well. My toppings are either melted shredded cheese, sour cream or sliced cold avacado (or all of the above!). All served over white rice. YUM! And even better the next day. Going to go have some of the batch I made last night right now!

I sautéed the onion and garlic until the onion was translucent. Then I added the ground turkey with a little bit of the spice mixture and cooked the turkey until brown.  I think that gives the turkey chunks a little bit more flavor.  But overall really good and easy to make.

It's a very good recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of water, added some red and green bell peppers and let it simmer longer than 30 mins in order to concentrate the flavors even more. Topped it with the cheese, sour cream and tortillas and it was a hit. I even tried this with Italian turkey sausage instead of ground turkey and it was very good!

This recipe is awesome for its simplicity and taste. It's a solid base chili recipe that's easy to remember (I've memorized it!) and can be enhanced by adding extra ingredients of choice. I use 99% fat free ground turkey for a guilt-free meal that isn't lacking in flavor :). I think some people complained that it's a little watery but I will take that over adding additional processed ingredients. I love that this recipe only uses crushed tomatoes and not any additional sauce or paste!

Simple, versatile recipe. I especially like not needing a pre-mixed packet of flavorings that may contain ingredients you would rather avoid.

I love this easy and yummy recipe, but I modify it by adding green peppers and using veggie broth instead of water.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family. It was a perfect quick Tuesday meal and I loved the fact that I had everything needed in the pantry!  The onion I did substitute for frozen ones, which I always have on hand! I will definitely make this "my" chili recipe!

Just made this tonight. Yum!! After reading previous reviews, I used 1 cup chicken broth instead of water, left beans whole, and added corn. Hubby had 2 bowls and he's a picky eater. Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe!! Easy to follow!! The only changes I made were to steam and crush the tomatoes from scratch and using reduced salt kidney beans due to all the seasonings already containing salt.

I am impressed at how simple yet flavorful this recipe is.  It's the perfect chili for my tastes.  It has just enough heat, the consistency is great, and the ratio of ingredients is well-balanced.  It is also quite healthy, no unnecessary carbs or fat--and customizable if there's something you just must have in your chili (such as extra spice, or corn, or other veggies).  Finally, if I hadn't cooked it myself, I wouldn't have been able to tell it was turkey and not beef.    I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.

Good basic recipe, I think next time I'll spice it up a bit. A little too much tomato taste. Overall good, and very easy to make.

I make this recipe so often. I definitely consider myself a beginner when it comes to things in the kitchen, but I still manage to make this a winner every time that I cook it. I usually double the beans (one can dark red kidney and one can white kidney) and ALWAYS mix in cooked quinoa about ten minutes before serving.

I made this tonight and it was SIMPLE and YUMMY! I did modify a bit by sautéing the onions and (3 large cloves) garlic prior to adding the turkey, adding an extra can of beans, subbing diced tomatoes for crushed, doubling the cumin, and omitting the water and cayenne pepper. It had a good amount of spice without it:)

I like this recipe, simple to do and pretty quick too. I adjusted the ingredients and changed up the recipe a bit. I added an extra pound of ground turkey and sautéed the onions and garlic with the meat. I also added carrots, celery, an extra can of light kidney beans and barley. I used a tablespoon and a half of chili powder instead of two. I also left out the cumin (I didn't have any) then I added chopped tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. It was a little runny for my taste so I added some all purpose flour till I was happy with the consistency. It came out pretty good and my husband loved it so its a victory in my book!

Great recipe.  This is an easy one to use if you want to play with ingredients also.  Like another reviewer, I used black beans (put half in whole and mashed the other half).  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and added one diced and roasted sweet potato.  The sweet potato cooked while I got the other ingredients going.  Really  good and simple..

Despite it's simplicity, this is by far the best Turkey chili recipe I've tried.  I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed (I like the lighter tomato flavor and the large tomato chunks) and I left the beans in tact (I did not mash them).  My husband asks me to make this every week.  It's just spicy enough to make it perfect for everyone in our family.  I love to serve it with a dollop of fat free greek yogurt on top and a sprinkling of chopped cilantro.

Loved it.  Made it as written for the first time and it was great although a little soupy.  I did make it using organic fire roasted tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes, which really added to the flavor.  Next couple of times cut the water down to 1/4 cup (combined with a little chicken bullion) and added a can of pinto beans.  Also tossed in a green pepper and a little bit of fresh jalapeno.  Is absolutely wonderful and can't tell the difference from regular chili.  Will be my new go-to recipe for chili.  My husband, who is a rather discerning chili fan, loves it as well.

I really enjoyed this recipe, pretty simple. I did have to add more of the chili powder, cumin, and spice to get it to taste more like chili than tomatoes.  I also added an extra can of beans and a can of corn. My fiance really liked it as well.

I was leery of this soup as I'm not a huge fan of ground turkey.  So, I was pleasantly surprised at how very good this soup is.  I made this for a birthday carry-in at school, and everyone loved it.  The one change I made was with the beans.  I used chili beans instead of the kidney beans.  I made on the stovetop, cooled and refrigerated it over night.  The next morning, I warmed it up and put it in a crockpot.  We had toppings (cheese, green onions & sour cream) available for everyone to customize their own bowl.  Great soup, that I would make again.  Thanks, AMFISCHER for sharing.

I tried this recepie to feed family that congregated at my house one night. I doctored it up with some leftovers I had in the fridge from the night before. It was a hit! Now everyone asks me to make my famous pot of chili beans. The ingredients I had from the leftovers were: Italian squash sauteed with onions and tomatoes. Then steamed for final cooking with a can of corn. I also added a can of drained garbanzo beans, I let it simmer on low to medium heat for 30 to 45 minutes,  as I mentioned before it was a total hit. Even among the younger ones in the family.

This has a great hit of spice to it that I loved. I added a chopped carrot and celery just to give it some crunch. I also ended up letting it simmer for an extra 15 mins bc it was too watery and I like chili to be a bit thicker. I've made this recipe 3x now and its always great!

This chili was fantastic. I made a few minor changes: used dehydrated soy instead of ground turkey, used beef broth instead of water (due to the soy acting like a sponge I had to use a whole can), used a can of mild diced tomatoes and green chilies, and finally used a mild mexican chili powder instead of just normal chili powder. With these changes my wife and I enjoyed it.

this chili is very delicious and very easy to make. one thing i would mention is to know how much cayenne pepper is right for you. between the cayenne and blk. pepper it was too much for me. i should have compensated for that knowing that the cayenne is very spicy for me.  my bad!

I liked this and was very pleasantly surprised that the ground turkey didn't stand out, probably due to all the spices. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and I didn't mash the beans or add the black pepper. I did add more salt. My husband liked the fact that this chili was soupy. Definitely a good choice for dinner tonight!

We really liked it. My changes: 1 can of red beans, 1 can of pinto beans and 1 can of black beans ( would skip the black beans next time), no chili powder only a touch of cayenne pepper to make it kid-friendly, additional 1 small can of chopped tomatoes and 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes with chili, no water added, dash of cinnamon and sugar ( i add these two to all of my tomato based sauces), more garlic. Cooked on low for 2.5 hrs. Definitely a keeper.

I screwed up this recipe and threw it into a slow cooker on high for 4 hours and added rice to it. It looked like a stew, but the flavors were still there. You know its good when you try your best to mess it up and you still fail.

Used this for leftover turkey from Christmas and I used black beans and corn cause that's what I had in the cupboard.  I did not use any water at all.  There was enough liquid from the canned tomatoes.  Worked for me!

"Awesome" per my family.  I added one diced Poblano pepper and sautéed with the onion. I substituted 2 cups chicken broth for water and pureed one 28 oz can of pinto beans in place of kidney beans. Added one 15 oz can of drained black beans but didn't puree as my family likes some texture.  Family said "Most awesome chili ever and has a lot of kick".  Not for those who can't handle some heat though. :)

I am going to rate this recipe as is. I always follow the recipe exactly. I have made it many times and it is always great. I love that it's easy to make. I love that I don't have to drain the fat from the turkey. Mashing the beans slightly is a great idea! It really thinkens up the soup.  All of the ingredients are almost always on hand so you can make it last minute. It's become a staple dinner in our house and provides great left overs!

I really enjoy this recipe - it's relatively simple and easy to tweak.  I add a chopped green pepper along with the onion.  I cut way back on the water.  (I use a half a cup to start and if it ends up needing more later I can always add it).  I mash 3/4 of the kidney beans but leave the rest whole.  I also add a few tablespoons of Tabasco or whatever other hot sauce we have on hand.  Lastly, I let this simmer on low heat for at least 3 hours to let the flavor really soak through.   I don't think cooking it for 30-45 minutes really does it justice.  All in all it's one of my family's favorite recipes.

Good recipe though I did a few things different.  I added the spices and garlic with the onions, before the water.  

I also did not cover it but let it boil down some and added enough flour (not sure, 2 maybe 3 tbsp) to thicken it up.

I only changed a few things for lack of ingredients
1.  Diced tomatoes instead
2.  Black beans instead
3.  Basil instead of Oregano 

It gets four stars because the flavor was great but I'll subtract a star because it was quite soupy.  I simmered it for hours and it was still soupy.  Too soupy so next time I'll add a bit less water.  It was really good though and the soupy part could just be a preference.  Maybe chili is supposed to be soupy?  I'm still a beginner cook and chili has never been something I enjoyed before (because of the beans which I hate)

I love this recipe...it is just so versatile!  I have made this 4-5 times now, sticking with the spices as written (I personally think they are perfect!), but each time I add a little something extra....this time it was chopped zucchini and yellow pepper, a TBSP of brown sugar, and some sweet Italian TURKEY sausage...and I used a 16 oz can each of kidney beans, black beans, navy beans and petite cut tomatoes.  After reading some of the other reviewers ideas, I think I will try adding some chopped green chilies and maybe some corn the next time.  It makes a colorful meal and the veggies are included, which I like.  I usually make a double batch and it freeze most of it.  It comes out even more delicious the second time around!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I tried this recipe, you need to cook at a low heat much longer it order for you to the get the consistency you need for a chilli.  Not sure why it says  30 min only.  if you use 2 cup water or reduce sodium chicken broth like I did, definitely ,more time is required.  I like spicy but if you are making for the whole family (kids) then you might need to reduce the cayenne and black pepper.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flake as well for extra kick.  I also added some onion salt.  I also added an extra can of beans.  I did  black bean and red kidney beans.  Overall I like, was fast and easy to follow for the most part.

YUM!!!  I used this recipe as a base.  I added a small can of diced tomatoes, fresh corn and a half a can of black beans, simmering for the 30 minutes called for in the recipe.  Checked the seasoning along the way and adjusted it as needed.  It came out delish!

This is a great base recipe.  I added a can of refried beans to thicken the recipe, less water, another can of tomatoes, and some more spices.  Made with my usual Homesteader Cornbread from this site.  Tastes great.  So excited to eat tonight. Perfect rainy day food.

This recipe is amazing. I have made it twice already, but the second time was way better. I used black beans and chopped up some canned whole tomatoes. I didn't have to add the water because of the juices from the tomatoes. Seriously, made a difference and my boyfriend loves when i make this. Thank you!

I really like this recipe! It's easy to make & most ingredients on hand.  I sauteed the onions in a separate pan then added to the mix. I also doubled the amount of crushed tomatoes.  My family loved it the 1st time I made it, but preferred less Cayenne & Chili Pepper.  This time it was perfect & everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!

I loved the canned chili my mom would buy in California, but when I moved to Florida, they didn't sell it here and none of the other chilis compared to it! I absolutely love to have chili so I was pretty bummed. (My mom actually mailed me cans of chili from home hahaha) I decided I would make my own batch. It would be delicious, much healthier, and I could freeze it and have it whenever I wanted! I decided to go with this recipe. The only thing I changed is that I used 1 cup of water instead of 2 because I like my chili not as soupy. I made the full batch and froze most of it, ate a bowl full, and refridgerated a couple servings to have over the next few days. It was awesome! It's definitely better than the canned chili (what fresh food isn't better than canned?) I am eating it right now as left-overs because it was so delicious. I eat it with cheese, sour cream and fritos. Yum!!! My boyfriend even had a bite and said it was good and he hates chili. :)

Pretty good and that's a tall order to fill with me since I grew up in New Mexico, land of the awesome New Mexican and Mexican food!  I would give it about a low to almost medium rating on the spice scale so I'd add more or less cayenne pepper to accommodate (or do the typical add salsa of whatever heat you prefer).  I also used a 10oz Ro*Tel can of diced tomatoes+green chilies for half of the crushed tomatoes because I'm a green chili fanatic.  For the remaining 18oz I crushed my own tomatoes.  It's easy and can save you some money -- Just concassé some tomatoes if you like a slightly smoother texture to your chili (cut an X in the core and take a knife or spoon to make a circle around the X so you can connect it all and pull the core out, blanch the tomatoes in hot water into cold, and then cut in half and squeeze out seeds with your hand) or chop them into chunks with the skin still on if you prefer more chunky.  Gradually heat the tomato gently to no higher than about medium heat in a pot and mash them with a wooden spoon or spatula until they're crushed (but not too mushy or else you'll get a paste).  Finally I added a dash of Jack Daniel's Honey Smokehouse barbeque sauce to give it a smoky chipotle flavor and if I'm being gracious on my calorie count that day, a dallop of fat-free sour cream on top for garnish :) Could also easily add shredded cheese/green onion too.  Chili is one of those things that just gets better with age as the spices continue to blend, mmmmm!

I made this without the onion and it was delicious.  It was exactly what I had been looking for - a simple, tomato based turkey chili.  I had 6 picky eaters over for dinner and they all loved it!  I served it with sour cream, shredded cheddar, crackers, and Goldfish (the crackers, not the pets...).  It was easy and quick to make.

Best chili I've ever made! I did double the amount of beans to two no-salt cans, one kidney and one black. The mashing idea was fantastic and I will use it in other soup/casserole recipes. Great blend of spices for my taste as well as my husbands. If you try it with beef, choose as lean as you can (93%+) and then there is no need for the olive oil.

I'm SO glad I didn't add the two cups of water required, it would've been too soupy. At least for my taste. As for the taste, it was pretty good. All I added that was extra was a can of corn and 1 1/2 Tb of red pepper flakes for a kick! Oh, and I didn't use ground turkey. I had some leftover turkey breast from last night's dinner and I used that instead. I prefer a chunkier, meatier, chili!

Really like this recipe,  I doubled it, used half tomato soup instead of water or broth.  Two cans of kidney beans only mashed one can and black beans and added some sweet peppers.  It packed just enough heat for me, but my husband thought it was a little too much - sour cream evened it out for him.  Will definitely fix again

I followed the recipe that the author posted. Review jan 2012 They reported that the printed recipe was changed. They sautéed the onion first with peppers and celery so I did this to get more vegetables in. I used all the spices but increased them slightly except the chilli as I had added more vegetables and a can of black beans and red kidney beans. I didn't mash my beans. I cooked the spices with the mince and vegetables before adding the stock and tomatoes to intensify their flavours. I cooked it on a slow heat for a couple hours and added half the water with some powdered stock. I also added in tomato paste. I then put in corn kernels for the last 10 mins. It was really delicious and I'm sure will just taste better tomorrow. I didn't feel it made 8 serves even with my additions. Will definitely make again!

Loved this recipe. This was the first chili that I ever made myself, and it was great.  I added tomato paste to thicken and some red pepper, but it was fabulous.  Big hit with my wife!

The recipe leaves much to be desired in taste and consistency.  Knowing that turkey can be quite bland I added additional seasonings and still found it to be tasteless.  The recipe could have benefited from a can of tomato paste to give it more flavor and a thicker, more hearty consistency.  The only way was to add an extreme amount of salt.  Won't be making this again.

Definitely a great "starting point" for a turkey chili recipe. I would have given it 4.5 stars since I had to make some adjustments based on other reviews, but I rounded up to 5 since overall I'll certainly make this again. I sauteed the onion with diced green pepper until the onion was translucent in canola oil, then added 2 (you could add more!) cloves of minced garlic until it turned golden and THEN added the turkey. Once it was browned I added one can of black beans along with one can of kidney, did not mash either of them, one small can of mild green chilies, the crushed tomatoes, ONE cup instead of two cups of water, and all the remaining spices minus the cayenne pepper because my toddler was going to have some. So good, and I think it was even better the next day.

Really good. I was surprised as I hate anything with ground turkey (the mister loves it!). I made it exactly as written but didn't mash the beans. After I put the water in I realized it was way to much water. I put the lid on for about 20 minutes then took it off to let it reduce to the consistency that we liked (about 15 minutes). I thought it was seasoned perfectly but I think that was because I let it reduce and it concentrated the flavor. I will make this again.

This is delicious. I have to be careful of spicy foods so I cut way back on the spices: 1 tsp of chili powder and 1/8 tsp of all the others, and it was still spicy enough to be acceptable to family members.

Tastes absolutely great! Couldn't find the cayenne pepper so I used Chipotle chilli pepper instead. Yum! Also added 1 cup elbow macaroni to beef up the carbs. Next time I'm adding green peppers as well. Oh, also added a dollop of low fat sour cream.

Very nice, I might add something to thicken it up a bit, but that is a personal preference. Overall, this chili had great flavor! Thanks for another tasty meal to add to my recipes! Looking forward to more of this over the winter.

Simple Turkey Chili Haiku: "I used the crockpot. Smelled divine when I got home. And tasted great too!" So oops I didn't have a 28 oz. can crushed tomato, and used diced instead, so my chili was a little on the thick side, which is fine w/ me b/c I love Frito Scoops in a goopy chili. This was the perfect heat - not scorching, but still flavorful. Glad that I tried this chili out!

Overall very tasty. I did a few things different:
1 chopped red bell pepper
Instead of 1 Tb garlic, I used 5 cloves using my garlic press
1 can refried black beans
I didn't mash the kidney beans
I added extra oregano and cumin to taste
For the chili powder I used a spicy, authentic red chili powder.

I did as others stated below - I sauteed the onions and garlic and then added in the beef. I used the water and let it simmer for more like an hour to an  hour and a half.

Fantastic chili. Had a pound of ground turkey i didnt know what to do with so i saw this recipe and i thought i would try it even though it was the middle of a hot summer. I had never had turkey chili before but it was delicious kids and adults loved it. Served it with cheddar cheese and fresh homemade garlic bread.

Great for kids! My changes: 5 mini sweet red peppers, mashed up pinto beans, and added 1 cup of beef broth to create a soupier end.  Served with corn bread muffins.  1 year old and 4 year old both gobbled it down!

Great recipe.  I browned onion and garlic in garlic olive oil. Omitted the cayenne pepper, did not rinse the beans, added brown sugar to taste, a can of black beans.  Also, did not have crushed tomatoes, so I added can of Rotel Tomatoes and Fire roasted tomatoes.  Served with mexican cheese blend and sour cream.  Can't wait to make this again!

Turned out great! Added green pepper and only used one cup of water. Also added half a can of navy beans.

What a great beginner recipe. This was my first time ever cooking chili and it came out great! I followed advice on here and added half a can of medium chili beans and 1/2 green pepper. I only mashed 1/2 of the beans but next time I will reduce the water and not mash any. This recipe can handle more veggies, so celery, corn even carrots will be great. I was cooking for toddlers so I omitted the chili powder and cayenne, but the heat from the chili beans was enough actually. Definitely a keeper.

I added my own flare to the recipe. I  reduced the chili powder to 1 3/4 tsp and added 2 tsps of baking chocolate. Ummmm....The perfect balance! I am very pleased with the recipe as it was.

Perfect, adding it to my "twenty minute to make dinner" recipes, my little boys request this and eat it up with a little cheddar on top and crusty bread on the side. I don't mash or drain the beans (try it), add green pepper and am heavy handed with the cumin. Winner!

This was amazing and super easy. It was a hit with EVERY person in my family which never happens. My hubby even said to put it in the rotation of meals. I followed the recipe exactly and served with cornbread. I used red fat cheese and fat free sour cream as well. So excited to find a yummy yet healthy meal.

loved it, added two cans of chili beans and 1 can of corn (instead of the kidney beans), 4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, omitted some of the water, and it was great..not to hot as I served it to a 91 year old woman that had 2 bowls...better the next day

Made this recently, and had to add a lot more seasoning. It had a rather bland taste, so I spiced it up a bit more. But with a few additional seasonings, it was a great quick meal that I can eat off of for a few days.

This was my first time making chili, and I'm glad I picked this recipe!!!  So good...I also made a few changes, as suggested by other users...added one chopped green pepper and one chopped red onion, used 1 cup chicken broth instead of water, used only 1/4 of the chili powder, and substituted Frank's hot sauce for cayenne pepper because that's all I had.  It turned out delicious, and I can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow!

This my first review but I had to review as I have made this so many times I have lost count. This is GREAT when your on a diet and everyone loves it. I have made this in a crockpot and on the stove. I did however quarter the chili powder as I am not a hot spicy person and I use pam instead of the olive oil. I also love how versicle this recipe is. I have added tofu like sour cream, swapped kidney beans for black beans, and added lime. This is a staple meal for us.

I have made this several times and I agree with the recommendations about the water.  I also add a touch of cocoa powder to it.  I know, but it just rounds everything out!  Happy Cooking!

Excellent and easy chili recipe!  I'll definitely make it again. I added a can of chili beans and only mashed half of all the beans. I also added a can of green chilies. Yummy!

I really like this recipe for a healthy, hearty winter lunch or dinner.  Just a note, 2 Tbsp of chili powder gave it nearly unbearable heat.  I've adjusted to more like 2 tsp and it's great!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent! I did make some modifications--I used a slow cooker for approximately 6 hrs. I added a can of pinto beans with the kidney beans, but I used only about 1/2 of each can initially. I put in the other two half cans at about 5 hrs of slow cooking. I did this to ensure not all of the beans would fall apart. This seemed to work well. I also added some red pepper flakes initially (approximately 1/4 teaspoon) along with all of the other spices. I do like my food spicy and this ended up perfect.

I thought that it was fantastic!

A couple things that I did that weren't what was listed/told in recipe:

-I didn't mash the kidney beans. I just dumped them in whole (I still rinsed them).
-I often add more garlic than what's called for in recipes. Therefor, I put more garlic than what was called for.
-I was out of cayenne pepper, so I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce. Frank's uses cayenne chilis, so it was a perfect subsitute.

Like the recipe says, it's excellent the next day! It was very easy to me, too. I would strongly reccomend this recipe.

Excellent. Agree with others even better next day.  I eliminated cumin increased garlic and maybe the best twist of all was using fire roasted canned tomatoes that gives bite and texture

This is absolutely an amazing recipe, I like the simplicity of the recipe but the quality of taste. I couldn't believe it tasted so good the first time I made it. Now every time I make it I have it with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and fry bread. YUM! Everyone in my family loves this chili.

I LOVED this recipe!!! I joined this site because I am not a good cook but I have learned so much by trying recipes like this one out. I used all of the ingredients listed except for the Cayene Pepper due to a stomach issue and the end result was mouth-watering. Thanx a million for sharing this with the world!

Overall it's good, not great, and is a little lacking in flavor. It worked better when I augmented it with cheese and some other sides.

Amazing and not too spicy. I used 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth in place of the 2 cups of water. I also added a can of pinto beans in addition to the kidney beans. Mashed half of each kind and left the rest whole. I also added the garlic and onion to the meat while cooking with a little seasoning and green bell pepper. Came out fabulous. Thank you so much!!

I thought this recipe was a little boring.  Nothing stood out.  I think some fresh veggies like carrots, green and red pepper, and celery would help this chili feel more Hearty.

We just made this for dinner. Ingredients are really easy and probably in your pantry already and its tastes great. A friend suggested that we try a Samuel Smith oatmeal stout instead of water so we'll try that next time but as is this is a very good recipe.

I have been making this dish for a long time now, only I sautee my garlic and onions and then add the turkey (I use ground breast meat). I add chipotle taco seasoning to my mine, and it gives it such a wonderful, smokey, spicey flavor. I also prefer black beans, since they are smaller, but I've also mixed black and kidney, or cannellini beans as well. This is a wonderful crowd pleaser... you can break up some taco chips for color and put the shredded cheese on top! Yummy!!!

This is excellent for what it is... a simple turkey chili. I think of this recipe as a solid starter recipe. It's great on its own, but part of its charm is that it welcomes alterations and extras. I added a chopped bell pepper and a can of corn (drained.) It was wonderful. :)

This was excellent, but I made a couple of changes.  I used 2 cans of kidney beans and reduced the water to 1 cup.  I also sauteed the onions and garlic in the oil and then added the turkey.  After bringing to a boil, I cooked it on low for about 3 hours.  When I make it again, I will only use 1.5 cans of kidney beans and maybe 1.5 pounds of turkey.  Everybody loved it and I didn't have any left overs!  This is a great starter recipe for chili.  I didn't think it was too spicy, but I like heat so I may not have noticed it.

Really great Chili!  I think it tasted great and was really nice as a 'throw whatever is in the pantry' type of recipe.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a hot meal.

This was a great recipe. My daughter and I tried it. We omitted the olive oil and just browned the turkney in a nonstick pot. We add a twist. Instead of using 1 can on crusted tomatoes, we used 1(10 oz )canned of tomatoes with green chili, 1 (10 oz) can of tomatoes with onion, and the last remaining 8 oz was crushed tomatoes.  We cut the water by half and doubled the salt.  We slao cooked it for 15-20 minuted longer.

I thought the recipe was great. My version was very mild, because I didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand. Also, I didn't mash the kidney beans. Still very tasty :)

My husband and I LOVED it! I have never had chili before because of a pepper allergy, so I loved and appreciated that peppers are not the highlight of this dish. I also can't eat spicy, so I toned down the cayenne pepper, but the rest was delightful! It is now a mainstay in our kitchen

This was excellent!!! I had never had turkey chili before and I am so glad I went with this recipe. I cooked this for myself and 3 other guys.  I had to double the recipe and we still ran out! The guys loved it! I made one adjustment, I did use chili beans instead of kidney beans, I did drain off most of the liquid, but I didn't rinse them.  Also, I couldn't find cayenne pepper, so I substituted hot chili seasoning instead.  I served this with fritos with cheese and it was a hit!

I made this exactly as the recipe is written and it's awesome.   It's a little soupy, which I like, but if you like your chili thick, add a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch at the end.

I followed the reciped to the letter and I don't know what I did wrong because it didn't taste good. There wasn't much of a "chili" flavor to it. Maybe I"ll try it again.

Great basic recipe.  Needs a little zinging up with extra spices.  I added 1.5 cups sliced mushrooms and about 3/4 cup of leftover frozen mixed vegetables to bump up the veggie content.  As for the water content, I just filled the empty bean can and used that.  Ended up not too watery, and just thick enough to be chili.

It was a little spicy but I went a little over kill on the chili powder (2.5 TBS) and 3/4 TSP cayenne pepper and Hungarian Paprika.  But it came out delicious even if it is a little spicy :)  I like spicy.  My family on the other hand doesn't.

I make a very similiar recipe that is delish. I add peppers, more beans (3 or 4 cans) on top of the crushed tomatoes, add 2 cans of fire roasted tom. I use a lot more garlic and onion depending on how much you like. And for the spices I use everything listed plus a little cinnamon, it gives it something special. Also in place of water I use chicken broth. YOu have to adjust the spices to your liking, I would double the spice amount to make it taste better.

Super tasty! I followed the instructions but my local grocery store didn't have exactly 1lb ground turkey and I used petite diced tomatoes (14oz can). I added more chili powder and slightly more cumin. I decreased the salt, and probably could've never used it because I added a little cheese on top. For some color and a little taste, I added about 1/4 tsp tumeric too and double the cumin.   Delicious! I'll definitely be making this again!

like some other reviewers, i switched up the cooking method a bit - started by simmering the garlic in oil, added the onion and a chopped jalapeno (for kick), then the turkey and peppers. i also added some diced butternut squash to add a little volume. i used 1/2 can of kidney beans and 1/2 can of black beans, and added the crushed tomatoes and no water. my dinner guest - who is from texas - loved it, and i consider that some solid validation. so overall - 4 stars for a good baseline recipe; a little boring but i have a feeling i could make all kinds of nice variations off this foundation.

This recipe is fantastic! I don't know if I added the exact amounts of the seasonings because I didn't measure. But as long as you are like most people and season to taste this turns out great. Even my husband liked it and he doesn't care for turkey chili!

THis is an easy chili recipe with a very mild taste.  If you are looking for a chili recipe with a "kick", this one is not for you.

This chili was great.  Super easy & simple.  I omitted the jalapenos and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Delish!  I will double the recipe next time.

This was a really really nice recipe.  I only voted 4 stars because it seemed to be lacking some flavor.  I added a bit extra paprika/chili powder.  Great based and will use again!  Thanks!

This chili is delicious! I've avoiding eating chili in the past due to the sodium and preservatives found in canned versions or seasoning packets and the amount of time required for other recipes has been a deterrent.    This was quick, very simple, and very tasty. I also reduced the amount of water to 1 cup for a thicker consistency and omitted the cayenne due to my 7 yo who is very sensitive and picky. He LOVES it topped with grated cheddar cheese. My husband and I end up adding the cayenne back in because it's crazy delicious spicy. It's even better the day after the flavors have had time to meld. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I have never in my life had better chili!!  Being a huge turkey fan it made it even better!!  The thing that topped it all off was the fact that it was extremely easy to make.  I have made it 4 or 5 times in the first month of trying it .

Made changes based on earlier reviews; Sauteed onion & garlic a little before adding turkey. Added in some Mtl steak spice. No water added later, just used all contents of crushed tomatoes can. No hot spices except for a little mexican hot sauce. Added 2 tbsp of brown sugar to other spices.

This recipe was good, and spicy.  My husband said it was a keeper, and he doesn't like turkey much.  I made a few changes but nothing that drastic.  I wanted to do this in a crock pot so I browned the turkey and onions as directed then added that and all other ingredients into the slow cooker and set on low for 8 hours.  I used a can of beef broth instead of the water and added a can of white kidney beans and a can of corn along with the red kidney beans, which I didn't mash because I like the look of the beans in the chili.

I made some simple changes to this recipe and greatly improved the overall flavor of it. Try adding taco seasoning and onion and green pepper to the meat while cooking it.

Disappointed.  Maybe it was because I chose to substitute fresh tomatoes instead of canned and I didn't have chili powder, so I just added more cayenne and paprika, but this recipe was really a disappointment.

I used this recipe for my first time making chili from scratch. It was delicious. I read previous reviews and cut the water by half and added some veggies of my families liking to the mix. I will continue to use this recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I  did a couple of things already mentioned such as using chicken broth.  I used both kidney and black beans.  Since I used 2 cans of beans, I added about another 1/4 lb turkey. Adjust spices accordingly. I added 2 tablespoons of jalepeno juice when I added the onions, then added 2 tablespoons of chopped jalepenos with the rest of ingredients.

Made a few changes. I used about 1 1/4 C of liquid, 1/2 can of beans (hubby isn't a big fan), added frozen corn, used about 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, and salted to taste only. Hubby loved it even though he says he hates beans and chili! Thanks for the quick, yummy recipe.

This was a good chili! I'll definitely make it again. But I felt it was missing something (And i still don't know what it is yet). I added about 1/2 tsp of black pepper to help fill the missing taste. I also used a little less water to make it thicker.

This is incredibly good, and surprisingly low in calories.  Everyone I know who's tried it has loved it (and that's about 10 people so far!).  The recipe is delicious as is, but I usually add chopped jalapenos for extra heat and texture, and substitute black beans for the kidney beans.

Very good and easy to make. It seemed to be missing something though... so I added in a little extra cumin for some heat, and that seemed to help. I think I read a review where someone added in a green chili, I may do that next time. All in all, it was delicious and I devoured it!

Delicious!  A good meal on a cold night to warm the belly :).  I added another can of light red kidney beans and didn't mash them.  Then again, I really like beans :).  I added a handful of reduced fat mexican cheese on top and it was amazing.

Decent, but wasn't really thick enough.  We added more kidney beans and a can of Hormel's chili, which totally took away from the homemade aspect.  It just felt like it was missing something before.

Overall, it turned out pretty well although I did change some things. I prepared the turkey and onions as directed but then everything combine in a slow cooker for a few hours. It came together well but was a little bland. I'll probably add fresh peppers for a better heat next time. All in all it's a good starting place.

I just made this and its fantastic. Here are my changes: I added a small diced zucchini, half a yellow bell pepper diced, half a can of tomato sauce, and half a can of black beans. I omitted the water, and only used 1 small can of chopped tomatoes. I didn't drain the kidney beans, just mashed them a bit, but I did drain and rinse the black beans. I know I made a lot of changes, but the recipe gets 5 stars because the spices are perfect. I always buy the seasoning packet for chili, but decided to give this a try. Its exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!

Loved the recipe.Cut out the cayenne pepper and added sliced raw jalepenos. WOW! The top of my head almost flew off tasting it. Keep this version for the guy's poker game. Not for the faint of heart!

A good recipe for chili seasoning ideas. If you make it as directed, it will be really watery. It definitely needs more than one can of beans, and it doesn't need any more water than what the tomatoes provide.

Very easy to make, especially since it was my first time making chili. The end result was a little bland so I upped the garlic, paprika, salt, and chili powder.

I made this I last week and it was fabulous!  I only made a few changes.  I added a few cloveds of minced garlic with the onion.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a small can of diced tomatoes with chilies!  I omitted the cayenne pepper as I didn't have any.  It still came out great! Will definitely make again!

Good basic recipe to build upon. Also added Worcestershire, dried basil, frozen corn kernels and a can of tomato paste. Used frozen white beans instead of red and canned chipotle instead of cayenne/chili powder. Left out the water just for preference to chunkier style.

This is a great!  I followed the recipe, but aded a can of chili beans since I had those on hand and added a few healthy shakes of crushed red pepper since I like things spicy.  I also let this simmer for several hours before serving.  It was amazing, there was plenty leftover for lunches, and it reheated in the microwave very well.  The boyfriend voted it into regular rotation.  Next time I might try this in a slow cooker like some of the other reviewers and double it to freeze for quick dinners later.  Thanks!

This was so simple, and so tasty! I only made a few changes not so much to the ingredients, but to the method. I'm feeding this to my 3 year old so I cut the cayanne in half, salted only to taste (low sodium diet), and used just 1 cup of water with the rest on reserve, just in case. I think the most inportant thing is to leave the lid off, this just makes it more soupy and by mashing all or at least most of the beans, which help thicken it. We sprinkled on some cheese and served with crackers...YUM!! and even better the next day. Thanks for the great recipe!

I accidently bought ground chicken but it ended up tasting great.  Also added 1/2 green bell pepper, 1 jalapeno pepper seeded and deveined and a handfull of mushrooms. I substituted the 2 cups of water for 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup of tomato sauce and as such, had to increase the chili powder.  Tossed everything into the slow cooker and it turned out amazing!

This was really good.  I borrowed ideas from other reviewers and additionally added a can of chili beans (mashed half the can), green chilis, and a half teaspoon of cinnamon.  I think you could get away with the same nutritional properties by using sirloin or venison.

Great base for the chili!  Like some of the other users, I only added 1 cup of water, giving it a good hearty consistancy.  I also used both a can of kidney beans plus a can of black beans. My other addition was adding paper thin slices of serano, jalapeno, and pepperchini peppers.  I didn't add a lot of the peppers, but enough to give it a nice green flavor and add to the hotness some. I added them to the meat and onions at the start of this recipe.  Everything else I kept the same and was really happy with it! I had 3 bowls and had to resist a 4th!!

Excellent! I only put in 1 cup of water to make it thicker and halved the cayenne and black pepper so it was a little less "hot". Still had plenty of great flavor and a fantastic winter dish!

FABULOUS!  i'm never making beef chili again.  i don't feel bad for going back for seconds!  instead of crushed tomatoes (couldn't find any), i used 2 smaller cans of no salt added petite diced tomatoes. i also added a little more chili powder and cumin (personal preference), used dark red kidney beans, and served it with cornbread casserole from this site.  topped with light sour cream and a tiny sprinkle of mexican style shredded cheese.  even my beef-loving husband loved it.  next time, we're doubling the recipe.  thanks so much!

Wonderful!  I added celery & carrots.  I omitted the cayenne pepper because I was giving this to toddlers.  I didnt crush the kidney beans & used only 1/2 tsp minced garlic.  I also added 1-2 Tbsp brown sugar just to sweeten it a bit... So yummy!

great healthy chili, my husband and I even liked this better than beef chili, I did half the chili powder though so my son could eat it and it was still spicy. I love spicy food and I can't imagine this at full strength. I recommend adding the chili powder to personal taste.

This turned out great! I had to make a few changes based on what I had in the cupboard. I only had a 15 ounce can of crushed tomatoes so I added 1 can of Campbells tomato soup. I doubled the cumin to 1 tsp and used about half the amount of chili powder (sprinkled it to taste). I used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the 2 cups of water. My mistake was adding salt when there is enough salt in the broth. I also added chopped green peppers when I was browning the ground turkey and onion. Oh and I added a can of pinto beans drained. Omitted the oregano, cayenne and black pepper and sprinkled red pepper flakes to taste.  I didnt mash the kidney beans. By only adding 1 cup of liquid you have a good chili consistency. Kinda tastes like Wendys chili! Yum!

Made this last night and the taste was great (used 1/4 tsp cayenne instead of 1/2 tsp). It ended up much more liquidy than expected though. Going to try to cut the water to 1 or 1 1/2 cups next time..

I thought this was pretty good. It had a little too much tomato taste for me (I think I would add more spices next time). Overall though it's a great easy recipe.

Absolutely delicious!!  I followed some of the recommendations from others by adding 1 can black beans, 1 can corn, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, only used a dash of cayenne pepper, and served it with shredded Cheddar cheese.  This is the best chili I've had in a long time - thanks!

My family ranted and raved about how good this chili was.  I served it with sharp cheddar and light sour cream and made some cornbread to go along with it.

My 8-year-old son and I loved this--and he doesn't even like spicy foods!  He said he would give it infinity stars.  The only change I made was unmashed pintos instead of kidney beans because they were already in my pantry.  YUM!!!

Needs more spices because I thought it wasn't very spicy.  I thought it was very tasty though - just needs something more.  I plan to add more chili powder and playing around with the spices.  I made a double batch so I have leftovers to play with.  
I add a can of Chili Beans instead of Kidney Beans and this gives it all the heat I need for my chili.

I made this recipe with dried kidney beans instead of canned (they're a lot cheaper) Just cook according to directions ahead of time.    Added 1/2 cup chopped peppers 1/2 cup chopped zuchinni 1/2 cup chopped yellow squash and only 1/2 lb of ground turkey and no chilli powder  It came out plenty hot and with a little bit more veggies.  Served with corn bread muffins, it was amazing

I wanted to try turkey chili as a healthier alternative for the traditional version.  I will probably never make beef chili again, however this was not, on the whole, the most flavorful chili recipe I've ever made.  I will probably try using turkey in one of the other turkey recipes from this site in the future -- though this really was very good. UPDATE:  I changed my rating to 5 stars after eating this on the second day...definitely more flavorful!

I used a package of taco seasoning instead of all the separate seasonings since I didn't have all of them on hand. Also, it came out a bit soupy, so next time I might use only 1 and a half cups of water. But overall it was very yummy! Hubby liked it!

Great! It was incredibly easy to make and had a lot of flavor. The only thing I changed was, I chopped a 1/2 of onion instead of a full onion.   Would absolutely make again! Maybe next time I'll serve or noodles. :)

I very much enjoyed this, despite not being a huge fan of chili! This was a surprisingly quick and easy meal! I had to use ground chicken as the store didn't have any ground turkey. I took the advice of a reviewer and added a green pepper (great addition!) and used half the salt called for. The chili was too thin for my tastes after 30 minutes of simmering so after eating some (yum!), I left it on for another hour and it was much thicker. I served over tortilla chips.

Turkey was too expensive... so I bought super lean beef. I also added an extra can of kidney beans (white ones!). Left out the paprika, and also the garlic (I'm allergic)... still came out AWESOME! Finally, a chili that doesn't looked like canned barf and won't blow my knickers off. I made it super mild. Flavor SO GOOD.

I have been making this for years, except using regular ground beef.  I simmer it longer.    I also triple the recipe as it freezes well.  I love it so much I don't even look at other chil recipes.  My husband likes it over rice.

Used Frozen chopped Onion, 1 can tomato sauce and 2 1/2 chopped fresh tomatoes and a bit of extra water, didn't mash the kidney beans... like them whole, added a can of pinto beans, couldn't find my cayenne pepper so I left it out and added a bit of extra chili powder instead. I'm thinking maybe the cayenne pepper is what is making the chili too spicy for some because ours wasn't too spicy at all. :/ Great Chili Recipe! Finally found something that my husband will eat Ground Turkey in vs Beef! YUM! Thanks! :)

This is delicious chili! A few changes I made: I browned the turkey, onions and garlic together in a pan. I used 4 cloves of garlic. I then combined all ingredients in a crockpot and put on low for 6 hrs. I totally left out the water and it was still bordering on stew consistency. I used diced instead of crushed tomatoes. I used one can of kidney beans and one can of chili beans. I only mashed the kidney beans. I left the spice combo alone, I mixed all the spices together before adding it to the crock pot. This spice combo, in my opinion, is close to PERFECT. Do not mess with the spices, if you do not have some--go buy them!

This was my first attempt at chili and it turned out great! We aren't big chili eaters, but I will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the cayenne pepper. My kids all enjoyed it and leftovers were great too. I served it with corn bread and salad.

I have been looking for a great chili recipe.  This is it!  The only changes I made were adding a can of chili hot beans, cutting back on the water and omitting the cayenne as my husband doesn't like things too spicy.  I thought this was definitely the best chili I have ever had!!!  Thanks for sharing!

This chili was truly delicious.  We followed the recipe pretty closely, though for posterity's sake, note that we did make the following changes:   1) cooked onion and garlic along with turkey and oil,  2) used a can of whole tomatoes, using food processor to break it up,  3) "mashed" kidney beans with food processor for smoother texture, and 4) added 1/2 teaspoon rosemary

I love this recipe, it's guick easy and cost effective!  I now make a couple of changes for my personal taste:  Two cans of black beans instead of kidney beans, two cups chicken broth instead of water and two pounds of ground turkey to make more for my large family.  It's perfect, thanks for sharing!

It's good and really easy. I omitted the cayenne pepper since I have a 2 year old. Served with homemade corn bread.

This recipe is amazing. The turkey is more flavorful than the beef which you normally use in regular chili, and much healthier. Though i did add a few ingredients to the recipe- First add about half a teaspoon of regular Vanilla. Second add a couple shakes of Cinnamon. I know it doesn't seem like a lot to add to this amazing dish but the amount gives the perfect flavor. Its also very good if you serve is over White Rice.

My boyfriend LOVED it! I made a few changes: I used a can of whole black beans, instead of water I used 1 cup beer and a 1/2 cup water, and I also added another can of crushed tomatoes. It was just too spicy for me. Next time, I will use less chili powder. ***Update*** The next day, it was amazing! The over spiciness was gone and it was perfect! 5 stars for the second day

Ha! This was crazy-easy and perfect on a cold night.  I was starving, and started making this before I took off my coat! I used frozen, diced veg (onion, celery, green pepper, and carrot) and the canned tomato products I had on hand (one small can of sauce, one reg. can of diced and one reg. can of diced tomatoes/sauce for chili which I think I bought on accident, but happy to have it). So tasty and satisfying. I served mine with a sprinkling of shredded cheddar/jack cheese. Yay!

Let me preface this review by saying "I don't like chili"  Dh loves it he'd give it 5 stars.  As per other reviews I added peppers (one red and one green), as well as another can of beans.  I mash one can because it gives the chili the thickness it needs, and leave another can with intact beans.

Very good! I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey for more flavor, and I substituted beef broth for the water. I also added a little habanero. Very good, but a little soupy- I will cook longer or use less broth next time.

This is my sons favorite because it's turkey. Not much of the beef eater. This chili isn't to spicy and very lean no grease.

I incorporated a lot of the suggestions from people's reviews to combine this dish.  I used extra beans: 1 can black beans, 1 can red kidney beans, 1 can white kidney beans, 1 can chilli beans.  Also added corn, carrots, and green peeper as others suggested and it turned out very colorful and delicious.

This chili was delicious!  I gave it a three because of a few revisions.  I added an extra can of beans (using chili beans because that is what I had) and smashed one can and drained the other and put the beans in whole.  Also, I cut the amount of water in half to make the chili a little thicker.  Finally, I added corn, which added a little sweetness to the spiciness of the chili!

This was very good.  I added a can of navy beans and some chopped green peppers. I also made it in the crock pot, though I don't think it made a big difference. I'd make it again, but next time I will scale back the water to 1 cup to make it thicker.

Delicious! I omitted the cayenne pepper for fear it'd be too spicy and it was great. Next time I'll add cayenne pepper. I served with cornbread and topped chili with cheese and sour cream. My husband turned up his nose at this when I told him it was made with ground turkey but after he tasted it he loved it and went back for seconds. Will make again and again!

I tried this recipe and was very pleased with the results.  I read the reviews and followed some of the suggestions and added some of my own, like using chicken broth, diced & stewed tomatoes, using  a small jar of southwestern style salsa, chopped fresh jalapeno pepper, drained corn, and cinnamon.  One downfall of my own doing was using dried kidney beans instead of canned which needed to be soaked overnight and added to the total cooking time.  However, I will make this a regular menu item in my home.

This chili recipe is very good. I upscaled it to 24 servings because I like to freeze half for another meal. The blend of spices was extremely good, however, the chili definitely has a bite, which my kids did not like too well. Additionally, the chili was more soupy than hearty. I like a spoon to be able to stand up on its own in my chili.   Some planned modifications to the recipe next time I make it: 1. Decrease cayenne pepper to 1/2 to 2/3 of what is indicated on the original recipe. 2. Decrease water to 2/3 of what is indicated on the current recipe. 3. I also increased the beans to twice as much. I like a good ratio of meat to beans. 4. I added a 15 ounce can of tomato paste. I hoped this addition would thicken the chili base, but I think the water really needs to be decreased also.  Overall, give this recipe a try. Tweak the recipe to meet your needs. Enjoy!

I liked this easy to make chili.  My son was ho-hum about it but my daughter ate it all up.  My family doesn't like spicy so I too, used the fire-roasted tomatoes and I used a red pepper instead of a hot pepper.  Served it with low fat cheddar, sour cream, and rice.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  My family does not like ground turkey, but since we are trying to eat healthier I thought I'd try this recipe since the reviews said it doesn't even taste like turkey.  It's true!  I did make some modifications: used diced instead of crushed tomatoes, added 2 generous tbsp of tomato paste and cut the cayenne pepper in half.  I didn't smash the kidney beans either.    I don't like spicy foods, so even though I halved the cayenne it was still a bit too spicy for me.  Next time I will try halving the chili powder and see if that helps.    Overall, it is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again!

I can't rate it officially because I made a few changes.  Instead of water I used about a cup and a half of chicken stock.  Used about a teaspoon of cumin instead of 1/2 (my personal taste), a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, and cut down on the cayenne for my kids' sake.  Great recipe that can be played with for your personal tastes and one that is still healthy!

I made this dish with a few changes. I sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil, then added ground turkey. I used both kidney and black beans. I doubled the spice measurements suggested, plus added about 3 tablespoons brown sugar and a 7oz can of diced green chilis. I used one cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup red wine in place of water. I put the ingredients in the crock pot for a few hours on low to give the ingredients time to meld. All three people over for dinner raved about the recipe. Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I made a few of the suggested substitutions made by others: added a can of chili beans and a can of mild green chilis. Also added 1 red pepper and some mushrooms. And I would recommend only 1 cup of water to start with and add more if you feel it necessary - especially with the mushrooms it was a bit too watery. I will definately make this again! Deliceous and healthy!

This was a very delicious healthy version of chili!  I didn't find the spices to be just right though.  I had to add quite a bit more chili powder and a pinch more cumin. It has a very nice kick to it.  Thanks for the recipe

This was just fab!  Spices are just right.  Not that anything needed adding, I just had around the house so I also added some black beans, red/green pepper and corn.  Really great, as suggested, with cornbread.  Nothing left for 2nd day, next time I'll have to double the recipe, but really what a great tasting dish!

Excellent! I made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it:) I like tomatoes, so I put diced tomatoes in to make it a little thicker. I also mixed the kidney beans with chili beans as well. Turned out great.....definitely prefer turkey chili over beef.

Wow!  This was very, very good and everyone loved it.  For the most part, I followed the directions exactly; however, since my family likes mild chili, I did not add the cayenne.  Also, I omitted the salt because I used 6 slices of cooked Virginia bacon (very salty!).  I served the chili with diced sweet onions, grated cheddar cheese and corn chips.  This recipe will definitely go into my "make again" file!  P.S. I read some reviews that complained of watery chili.  It is important to note that the recipe says to MASH THE KIDNEY BEANS.  The reason for this is to thicken the chili!  I mashed half of the beans but left the other half whole.  Terrific recipe, easy to make and quick!

This was pretty good chili. I did saute the onions and garlic before adding the turkey and added 1 can of black beans. Served it with Homesteader cornbread from this site. Made a great winter meal.

This was a very simple recipe. I did add 2 cans of diced tomatos and blended them with a handblender. I also used the handblender to blend the Kidney beans. I did add a can of corn. I added only half the amount of cayenne pepper . My whole family loved it. They didn't even have to pick out the beans because they couldn't see them. We will be making this chilli again for sure.

Had some ground chicken to use up so decided to try this recipe.  Instead of canned tomatoes I used frozen tomatoes that my mother-in-law put up this summer from the garden.  Also used 2 cans of kidney beans, did not mash either.  Used all of the spices listed, but in much greater quantities.  Very tasty!

I've made this recipe MANY times since I first found it. This is the recipe we use any time we make chili (and that's quite a bit). I usually add a can of corn and a can of black beans and serve with crumbled fritos, shredded cheese and low fat sour cream...Oh SO Delish!

I made a few changes and have lost track of how many times I've made this recipe - it's the only chili recipe I use anymore.  I use one can vegetarian refried beans instead of mashed beans and add a can each of kidney and pinto beans.  One cup of water is plenty and I use smoked paprika and petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed.  This is really good stuff.  Great with cornbread.

This was a very easy recipe, but came out a little bland.  I followed the recipe exactly, so next time I will add some extra spices to add some zing.  

I served it over Fritos with a little sharp cheddar on top.

Thanks for the easy recipe!

YUM!  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and sauteed the onions and garlic before adding the turkey.  I also added a chopped green pepper.  This was delicious.  UPDATE: I used a half lb turkey, half lb italian sausage and added a 4 oz can of fire roasted green chilis too.  WOW.

Great recipe! Here are the changes I made. I added about a cup of diced red and yellow bell peppers and a jalapeno when I was cooking the onion. I also omitted the cumin and oregano. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce because that is what I had on hand. I only used half a can of beans, based on personal taste, and left them whole. Lastly I used beer instead of the water. I started with a cup, but the chili got very thick while simmering, and I added the rest of the bottle.

Great tasting! I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned crushed, added 1 green pepper, and didn't mash the kidney beans. Next time I'll try to mash the beans and see if it's a little thicker. I also only added one cup of water.

This recipe was great!  I made a few changes due to some of the comments posted.  I omitted the water, added whole kidney beans, whole black beans, 1 can green chili's, and added 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of crushed.  I only added 1 tablespoon of the chili powder and added a dash of seasoned salt and cinnemon and dash of chipotle seasoning(Mrs. Dash).  I topped it off at the table with sour cream and the Mexican blend cheeses.  My whole family loved this, it was still a little spicy but not enough to burn for to long.  Will definitely use this again. And its true, it was even better the next day.

I added only one cup of water and was glad I did.  One cup with 10-15 minute reduction before simmering makes a chili.  Two cups is a soup!!  Aside from that, I enjoyed this, it was simple to make but the flavors weren't dynamic or anything that wowed me.

This was the best chili I've ever made!  And it was so easy!  I only added 1 cup of water because we like our chili on the thicker side.  I also added a can of mild chili beans.  I only put in a little bit of chili powder since my kids don't like spicy food but it was still really yummy! I served it on top of penne pasta with a huge heap of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the chili. My husband, who is very picky, LOVED it...he wants to eat the left-overs tomorrow night for dinner!  My 3 yr old twins liked it and even my 13-month old twins loved it and kept wanting more!

I like the idea of mashing the kidney beans.  It thickens the chili and accentuates the taste.

I have repeated this recipe dozens of times; it is well loved and appreciated by our friends and family.  I make this all-organic and it is excellent! I usually add frozen corn (that has been cooked and drained) and I also use vegetable broth instead of water, which I highly recommend.  We tend to like it less soupy, so I add an extra can of beans and an extra 1/2 can of crushed tomatoes.  I back off on the chili powder a touch, so people can spice it up to their liking.

Pretty savory chili. Missing a bit of a kick, though. I'll make it again, and when I do I'll add something to give it that kick.

Fabulous!  Very simple to make.  I added black beans and garbanzo beans as well.  Instead of the two cups of water, I used 1 cup of chicken stock.  I also used two 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with Jalapenos instead of the crushed tomatoes... This gave it a nice bite!  I served it with shredded cheddar cheese... YUM!

My husband is on a low fat diet and this chili fit right in!  I read many reviews and took the advice to add frozen corn, salsa, can of chili beans, and changed to 1c of water.  It was delicious, he loves it.

I used chicken stock in place of water and added tomato paste to thicken.  Also added a little cinnamon.  I used the crushed kidney beans but also added whole black beans for color and texture.  After those modifications it was the best chili I've ever made.

So easy and fast and delicious. I used 1 cup of homemade chicken stock in place of the 2 cups of water, which made the chili thicker and really yummy. I didn't add any cayenne (my BF's son is too young and tender for spicy food), and it was still delicious. But best of all, it was EASY.

I made this for my husband's birthday dinner last night along with warm cornbread and the whole family loved it! Even my first grader asked for seconds!I took the suggestions of adding cinnamon and instead added a generous pinch of chinese 5 spice. I will be making this again and again.

This is a great, easy to make chili. My husband loves when I make this in the fall. Pair it with a piece of cornbread, sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top and its a great meal!

Wasn't the greatest chili I've ever had.  It was a bit spicier than my family cares for.  My toddlers (who actually do like spicy food) wouldn't touch it.  Despite the spiciness, it just seemed as though it was missing something.  That said, it may have been much better had I followed the recommendations of some of the other reviewers.

This is a good recipe. I followed others advice and added a little ketchup, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, extra cumin and because I have a 3 year old I didn't add any cayenne. I think the black pepper and chili poder will be enough. I did put the full 2 cups water though...I don't mind my chili a little 'loose'. My husband doesn't know that I'm venturing out with our dinner tonight but after my taste test just now, I think he'll be just fine! I'm going to serve mine with some Mexican yellow corn chips. I might dig in early! :)

Delicious and super easy!!!  I added two cans of beans.  I mashed half of one of the cans and kept the other non-mashed. I used fresh oregano for an added touch of freshness. It's extra yummy with a garnish a white cheddar cheese!

I have made this recipe several times and love it!  It's really easy and fast--I tend to make it for a weeknight dinner for me and my boyfriend, then bring it to work for lunches over the next several days.  It's great with cheese, corn chips, and sour cream on top.  Last time I made it I used only one tablespoon of chili powder because I ran out and it still turned out really well.

My husband is not a chili fan, but he does like spicy things. I added green pepper and 6 oz tomato paste, and I also doubled all the spices except the chili powder, salt and pepper. I served it over white rice. I thought it was delicious, and my husband enjoyed it as well! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Good chili, but I would follow the previous reviwers' advice next time & cut the water by at least half. You can always add more, but you can't take any away!

This recipe was delish!  I had mine with lowfat sour cream and shredded cheese as suggested, and a whole wheat tortilla.  In the end, I only wished that it had more veggies, but I also used proportionately more beans and turkey and ended up adding salsa to supplement the crushed tomatoes.

This was a good recipe!  Even before tinkering with it a little, it was really good.  I made a few little changes to better suit my family's likes, but I really didn't need to do it.  Personally, I found the chili a little too spicey, so I would back off on the cayenne pepper by half next time, but that's just my taste.  :)  At the suggestion of others, I added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and love the addition.  Also, my husband likes more of a tomato-based broth, so I added a 4 oz. can of tomato paste to suit his taste.  I used the full 2 cups of water as called for and after simmering for 30 minutes, found that it was fine as written.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband really enjoyed this chili.  I took the advice of others and reduced the water to 1 1/2 cups, increased the cumin to 1 tsp. and added another can of partially mashed beans (pinto beans).  I also added a half teaspoon of cinnamon, although next time I think I would only add a quarter teaspoon.

Excellent chili. Being from Texas, I have high expectations of chili. This one met the bill.  I made some alterantations I used ground beef, increased all the spices by 1/4 to a teaspoon, and added cinnamon like one reviewer suggested and I also cut back on the water as noted in many of the reviews.  This is a keeper.

This chili was fantastic! I added a diced green bell pepper and a jalopeno pepper and substituted a bottle of a good pale ale for the water. Great with some cheddar or jack cheese grated on top.

YUM!! This won't replace my traditional chili, but it was really good. The fiancee isn't a big kidney bean fan so next time I might use only 3/4 of a can. Ran out chili power so I used some leftover taco seasoning powder. Served with shredded cheddar cheese and a glop of sour cream - awesome!

Wow! My husband asked if we could put this into our regular meal rotation- high praise indeed! I added a diced jalapeno in place of the cayenne pepper and also added a 16 oz can of black beans, along with the kidneys (not mashed).  Didn't have the cumin or paprika, so added a dash of cinnamon. Wonderful!

This chili was very flavorful and easy to make I added sauteed 3/4 lb mushrooms, 1 tbsp of scallions,  and 1 shallot that I had left over from a different meal. Just trying to get rid of some ingredients. I have never made this chili before so i am not sure how much of a difference the added ingredients but it was very delicious and earned a spot in my cookbook.

A nice combo of spices but I don't understand why the kidney beans had to be mashed.  I also would have added more kidney beans, we thought this was just okay and will carry on with my standard turkey chili recipe.

Really excellent!  One of our favorites.  If you aren't a spicy person, this isn't for you.  At our house we top it with grated cheddar and corn chips.  Sooo yummy.

This chili is SO good and the recipe is so easy!  You would never know there's turkey in it (I'm not a big turkey fan).  It was pretty spicy though, so if you don't like HOT food then I'd suggest lowering the amount of cayenne.  If you use the full amount of liquid (broth is far better than water, BTW) then it is more of a taco soup type of dish. So use less liquid if you want it to be more chili-like. 

We alter the recipe every time... sometimes adding other veggies, always an extra can of drained (and NOT mashed) black or pinto beans, sometimes adding chili peppers when they are in season,  sometimes adding tomato paste... whatever we have in the house. 

We always use this recipe for meal trains (like for new parents, or neighbors who are ill), because it freezes and reheats so well. That way if they can't eat it all that day, it's still amazing. Plus we can double the recipe and have enough to serve our family as well.  This has become a staple in our house!

The recipe definitely calls for too much water, I would use 1 cup instead of 2 next time. I had to let it reduce for 30 min and add flour to thicken it to my liking. Also had to add a lot more seasoning than what it called for.  But overall it's a decent base for a chili.

I give it 5 stars for being a tasty quick basic chili with ingredients that I always have on hand.  I made it exactly by the recipe this time and will alter it in the future depending if I am feeding picky grandchildren or a more sophisticated palate.

This recipe is missing flavor.  I think it needs more meat and another bean.  My family said it was "ok".  I usually have success with Allrecipes, but this one was not a winner.  We put it on hot dogs the next day.  Much better as a hot dog chili.

This recipe was good but lacked a bit of flavor for me.  My first instinct was to add some vinegar and sugar.  I actually ended up adding some organic ketchup and it gave it that sweet/acidic flavor I felt like it was lacking.

Very good.  Used 1 can of mild chili beans and maybe equivalent of 1 can of kidney beans.  Cut the water in 1/2 and used chix broth.  Put in 1 T. chili powder.  I cooked turkey and onions together, added 1 clove ch. garlic, and then added  1 stalk of ch. celery. Also added spices and sauteed them a minute or two before adding other ingredients.

I love this and mix it up with ground beef sometimes. I use less water tho so it’s not so “soupy”. I use about 1-1.25 cups of water. My husband loves it and so do it! I add a little sour cream and cheddar on top and serve it with a slice of cornbread! Mmmmm!

Loved this flavorful alternative to ground-beef chili. Served with cornbread, it made a warming and delicious meal for a cold night. I gave it 4 stars because it needed a little tweaking. I used diced tomatoes, since that's what I had in my pantry, and like others, used chicken broth in place of the water. I upped the cumin and salt to 1 1/4 tsps. each, mashed half the kidney beans (leaving the rest whole), and added a 15-oz. can of rinsed/drained black beans during the last 10 minutes of simmering. We like our chili thick, so I stirred in 2 teaspoons cornmeal toward the end (try 1 tsp. first). The recipe made a generous pot of chili for the two of us with plenty of leftovers!

This chili is delicious! I tripled the recipe to make a huge pot for my family , left out the beans because I didn’t have any, and halved the amount of cayenne pepper. Even my picky son loved it. We ate it with yellow cornbread muffins.

Everyone loves this chili, and its title is correct - it's easy to make. I use two cans of beans: black beans and white beans (cannelloni) which give a variety of color and texture., and add 1/2 cup chopped cilantro 10 minutes before the end of cooking.

Halfway through making this, while it was starting to simmer, I realized that it was bland and uninteresting.  I doubled up on the cumin, added some chipotle and Ancho chile powders, lots more black pepper, and a bit of the hottest pepper I had in the house, chopped finely.  I layered in heat until the spice level was right for us. On serving I added lime juice and some chopped coriander and served it with plain Greek yogurt.

Too spicy! I found it uneatable. I thought 2 tablespoons of chili powder was too much so I only used one and was still too spicy.  I wounder if they meant 2 teaspoons.

Such an easy way to have a wholesome family dinner! I would reduce the amount of pepper next time, but it's just due to my personal tolerance for spices.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! Added corn to it for a bit of a tex-mex kind of texture/flavor to it! For a stew-like rendition of it I've tried mixed veggies with it and with both ways it's come out incredible! Especially on the 2nd day!

Loved this recipe!! It was delicious, well seasoned and easy to make. I added about a half cup of rice to thicken it a little. This recipe will be added to my fall and winter menu rotation.

This was easy to make.  Tasted very good.  I only added more chili powder and salt. My family enjoyed it. Especially my son. He doesn't like beans.  By mashing them made it easier for him to eat.  Will make again.

We loved this chili. It is perfectly spicy. Hearty, comfort food. I did put a little celery in and 3 types of beans for variety: 1 can each of kidney, pinto, & the large cannelli or butter beans.  As a side to enhance the meal, I made cornbread muffins and added one large scoop of either sour cream or plain Greek yogurt, a can of green chilles, and some fine shredded cheddar   cheese. Ground turkey was perfect in it! Healthier and you don’t miss the ground beef because this chili is so tasty!

Excellent recipe. I made it my own by adding leftover shredded turkey meat (today I'm using chicken) instead of ground turkey to use up leftovers. I leave everything else the same thank you for a great base recipe it's a hit in a house full of teenagers that are not fond of turkey or chicken leftovers.

Followed this one to the letter.. It was more about the chili powder and nothing else. My husband said it was bland. My daughter thought it was too spicy. I thought it was too spicy, but not in the good way. Just over done on the chili powder and paprika.

I've made this chili several times.  Like most of the other reviews, it's a fantastic base recipe that you can add to and augment.  I like adding an extra can of kidney beans and I chop up a zucchini to add more veggies, last time I used fire-roasted crushed tomatoes and it was a nice touch.  I top it with plain greek yogurt and some avocado slices and it's a simple, hearty lunch!

Used beef broth instead of water and loaded up veggies. We mixed in sour cream/plain yogurt and cheddar cheese and topped with drenched fried onions. Sooo good! Better than beef chili!

I ran out of cumin so I used curry powder instead.  It was still delicious.  I also added one small grated zucchini when cooking the turkey meat (water absorbed with paper towels first).

I've made this multiple time, it's delicious! Couple adjustments I've made. I don't add any water, I like my chili thick and I only add 1/8 cyanine pepper. I find the original recipe too hot for my taste.

Easy to make and I had high hopes after reading all the great reviews, but unfortunately my family thought it had no flavor.

Easy, very easy. One pot, brown the meat, stir in the tomatoe base and spices, let cook. I added some diced carrots and sweet pepper. Could have used some corn or scallions as well. Served it with cheese on top and sour cream.

I used 1 can of chicken broth and 3/4 can water. I used white Northern Beans in mild Chile sauce.  It was a little thin but I didn’t mash up the beans. Next time , no water and 1 can beans mashed and one can unmashed. I also added 1 yellow pepper and 1 red pepper for color and sweetness. I served it with crackers and cheese. It was tasty and spicy .

Good chili- I used 1/2 can tomato paste with I can diced tomatoes. Went heavy on the chili powder, a few squirts of ketchup, and 1 can rinsed black beans. 
Does it mater what kind of turkey to use? I used ground 80/20 turkey and taste was so-so.

I don’t want to make anything else, ever again. This is so simple, quick, delicious, and healthy. It’s my second time making it. I think the only thing I changed was added corn and bell peppers. I like to change up the type of beans, the amount of water, and the veggies for variety so I get something slightly different each time.

I loved it.  So easy and so good.  I used chili ready tomatoes and added diced fire roasted green chilies.  While it simmered I tasted and added a pinch more black pepper and salt...

I've never made chili before, so I was a little nervous about the recipe. I followed it exactly except I left the kidney beans whole, and it is super yummy! My 5 year old son is pretty picky, especially when it comes to anything even remotely spicy, and he loved it!

I honestly appreciate that  Amanda shared this recipe - thanks so much, Since this is my ‘go to’ chili recipe because the combination of spices is so good.  I do make a change and use 2 cans of the diced tomatoes with green chilies (Rotel brand) instead of the crushed tomatoes, and use Bush’s white chili beans in place of the kidney beans, and I don’t rinse them or mash them, but put them right into the pot.   Also, I don’t add any water.  I also add 1/2 cup shredded cheese (cheddar jack  or 4 cheese Mexican is our preference) right before I’m ready to serve it.

This chili is so easy to make and tastes good. I altered the recipe using black beans and pinto beans instead of kidney beans. Also, I replaced half the water with vegetable broth. Got good compliments on how amazing it smelled! Bon appetite!

This is the 3rd time I made this recipe. Super easy and family loves it on a cold Sunday winter afternoon. I've become more adventurous with each round; now adding canned corn, sauted carrotts and celery with the onion (red instead of white), two cans of beans (1 mashed and 1 whole), chicken broth instead of water, extra chili powder, cayenne and cumin. This time I also added nutmeg and cinnamon. Really boosts the flavor quota!

1/19/19:  I skipped the oil to brown the turkey.  I also only used 1/4 of the water (to use the full amount of water would have made this way too soupy!).  I would also add some bell peppers and mushrooms.  Definitely yummy!

Love this recipe for chili! A couple changes I made was the substitution of crushed tomatoes for diced and the addition of a can of corn. My family goes nuts for the dish! Highly recommend!

Great simple recipe.  I added corn to mine since we love corn and wanted extra heartyness. A dollop of sour cream to serve and a corn muffin on the side. Thanks!

Super easy! Made it for a crowd (dialed the servings up to 48!) to great reviews and no leftovers! Only change I made was to add yellow and red bell peppers. Simmered an extra hour.

This was so easy and it was amazing! I will never make ground beef chili again.  Couldn't tell the difference  The only thing I did different was I did add some tomato paste, because I felt like it was too thin and not thick like chili!!  Going in my cookbook!

Very delicious!   I added some veggies (carrots, zucchini) to get my fix with this yummy meal.

PRO - this was FAST and I had almost everything I needed on hand.  Served it to in-laws and they loved it.
CON - tasted more like spaghetti sauce than chili.  Needed a lot more cumin, I think.

Delicious!! For mine I like a little extra heat so I diced up a jalapeño. It’s perfect with a 1/3 of brown rice too!

I really liked this chili recipe. I made it right after Thanksgiving, so I used my leftover turkey breast instead of ground turkey. I also followed some of the advice in other reviews and used chicken broth instead of water. For this reason, I did not add any salt (because there is plenty of salt in the chicken broth). My husband thought it could still have used a little more salt, but I prefer light on the salt. I used black beans in place of kidney beans because we liken them better and I added half a bag of frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's (yum!). I think the corn was an excellent addition. I did not change the spices and all and thought it was just the perfect level of zing. I will definitely make this one again!

Very tasty. The spices mixed well and gave the dish nice flavor with a slight bite. Definitely will make again and the only change I will make is to reduce the water by 1/2 cup.

This is a great, easy recipe. I added corn and replaced the water with chicken broth for what I think is a richer flavor and a little more texture.

I make as is and really enjoy this simple dish.  The only thing I add is sautéing half of a chopped red and green pepper with the onions and garlic.  I serve over rice with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  So good!

Love this chili! I have made it about a dozen times now and literally try to find different people to invite over to try it!
I add a can of garbanzo beans and use the “hot” chili powder to spice it up more - I even add some crushed red pepper too!
What I have noticed, if you are a family of four— you definitely need to double it!
The first time I made this, four of us adults finished it completely and some didn’t even get to have seconds. It was that good.

This is the perfect helping for me and my husband though! I like to make it and I always have some left over for a lunch one day!

This was a great and simple recipe that my family really enjoyed! The only thing I added was Italian seasoning, little bit of accent, and garlic powder. That garlic powder made all the difference--and don't be scared to add it on there! lol
All in all, very delicious :9 Oh and cheese!

Instead of adding garlic and spices to liquid mix, for added flavor I added garlic to browning turkey.  Then after about 5 minutes I added chili powder and cumin to turkey and continued browning for 5 minutes.  Then added liquid ingredients.
Added 1/2 jar of chili sauce also.  Tasted great!

I love this recipe. Tweaked a bit by using a can of tomato juice in place of water (I like it soupier) and cooking the seasonings & onions with the Turkey. Having acid reflux, it’s a bit too spicy for me. So I cut back slightly on the cayenne pepper.

Subbed Beef Broth for water, a red onion for the sweet onion, went a small bit heavier on the spices,  added corn, a red pepper, black beans and a jalapeno to the existing recipe and it was delicious! Better the next day when the flavors have a chance to meld

Made with black beans and half a large sweet onion because that's what I had. Good consistency but something with the flavor is off. I think there are too many spices going on in this one, next time I'd try with JUST chili powder and a little cayenne or hot sauce.

Maybe a little soupy. I'll let it simmer uncovered, or use less water next time. Other than that, great flavor.

I’ve made this chili for years now. I increased the cumin to 1 tsp to give it a smokier taste and use chicken stock instead of water. I also add a tablespoon of cornstarch with the stock to thicken it up a bit.

I was looking for a simple, tasty recipe and this one pulled through! Very easy to make and few ingredients to buy. I didn't have the cayenne spice so I emitted that and I also did not have garlic so I substituted with a tsp of garlic powder. Will make again!

Simple enough but too spicy for my taste.  Next time I’ll use  half the amount and then adjust accordingly.  I also thickened a bit with flour.

Not clear how much is a serving....

This was easy to make and very tasty. It’s one of the best Turkey Chili’s that I made and my husband who normally does not like chili liked this! 
This recipe is a keeper for sure.

Super easy and quick, I used the recipe as a basic foundation and then made it my own. Chopped fresh jalapeños and other fresh peppers. Sautéed them with the onions and fresh garlic.  I added Costco roasted peppers when I was done just to add another dimension of flavor.   Let the flavors marry over night and brought it to work for potluck.  100% raves across the board.

Love this dish....you can ramp up the hot-factor depending on your audience.  I would consider it on the spicy side which my family really loves.  I mix in a tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt in my bowl to cool it down. (You could also add sour cream.)  I have also swapped in roasted tomatoes, seasoned ground turkey and different bean combinations for fun.

This is our favorite turkey chili recipe, although I use far less cayenne pepper, roughly 1/8 teaspoon.  I give my husband the hot chili flakes and he can make it hotter if he likes.

I did not mash the beans and doubled the recipe, one of my favorite things about it was the amount of spices. I love lots of flavor, and this was delicious! I put pickled jalapenos on top and sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. A squeeze of lime and some added hot sauce is yummy too :)

Really easy and really good.  I sautéed garlic and onion in olive oil, then browned the turkey in the same pot.  I used only a cup of water instead of two, and added three small ripe vine tomatoes chopped finely.  The Cento brand of crushed tomatoes makes it delicious and I used Bush’s chilli kidney beans and only smashed half of them.  The seasoning is excellent as prescribed in the recipe.  The house smells great cooking this chilli.  Do it.

So easy and so delicious. The whole family enjoyed.  It was the perfect meal for a "tropical storm rainy night." I used white beans instead of kidney beans and took the heat down a little since my kids don't do too much spice...

This was an awesome recipe. I made this last night, May 01, 2018. 

‘Used small white beans, 10.5 oz, instead of kidney or black beans. They’re lighter and plentiful. 

I used  a 8 oz can of tomato sauce plus a 10.75 oz of tomato soup- I just happened to have it in my cupboard. Tip- to herb wll of the sauce add a little water in the can and swirl. 

I used vegetable seasoning which went well with the ground turkey  and its natural stock it made. 

The cayenne pepper gives it a nice hint of heat but not overly so. I also like dill seeds which awaken flavors in soups and stews. 

Garnishes: feta crumbles, one table spoon of sour cream, broccoli slaw (discovered at Trader Joe’s)   which added great texture. I did not reach for any crackers but will use garlic breadsticks  tonight. 

A dash of nutmeg and sage give it a nice earthy favor.  I also love rosemary and tyme. With earthy spices it’s a matter of knowing how to use them enough to balance out flavors versus overpowering them. 

It was so good, I went back for seconds.

Way too spicy and too liquid for chili.  I took the lid off to simmer, unlike the directions, to try to thicken it up.  2 cups of liquid is too much.

I followed the recipe fairly close at the start.

The only difference I made from the original was that I didn't crush my beans because not everyone in my house likes them so I wanted them to be able to pick them out.

I let it simmer for several hours so that all the flavours could blend properly.  When I gave it a taste test, I didn't feel there was enough flavour with the original spice amounts used so I added a bunch of chili powder to give it more of a chili flavour.

However, I topped it with cheddar cheese and the kids loved it.  I loved it.  I'd make it again but I'd just add a lot more chili powder at the start.

I had never made chilli ever. I read the reviews to see what others were saying so I followed some of their suggestions. I cooked the onions and garlic first. Set them aside. Then, I cooked the turkey until light brown. I added only 1.5 cups of water, mashed only half the can of beans and left the others whole. We like things a little spicier. So, we added 3 tablespoons of chilli powder and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper. a dash extra cumin. We didn't have oregano, so I used a mixed dry leave spice. (containing oregano). I also sauteed half a package of sliced fresh mushrooms chopped and added those as well. 
This, for me, was a keeper! Thanks for posting!

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be delicious. My children thought it was a little to spicy I might omit the cayenne pepper next time. I sprinkled cheddar cheese, cilantro and scoop of sour cream on top of my bowl of chili! Definitely will be making this again!

I used ground turkey, added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chili, some cilantro, about 1/3 cup sour cream and a little flour to thicken.  Instead of using just water, I used chicken bullion.  It turned out pretty darned good.  Topped with dollop of sour cream, chopped red onion, chopped cilantro and Mexican blend shredded cheese.

I absolutely love this recipe! However, I have added a couple of things to make it more of my own, with the guidance of some of the other views.  I add a can of corn, a can of carrots, a red pepper, about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  It makes just the right amount of sweet and spicy all together.  My husband, who's not a huge chili fan in the first place loved this! I highly recommend it!

I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I crushed a can of the whole tomatoes. I also used half as much cumin as the recipe calls for only because I'm not a fan. I added a can of whole kernel corn (trying to get rid of it, frozen would work even better I'm sure!). 
Instead of following these directions exactly, I browned the ground turkey then just threw it all in the slow cooker for 7-8 hours on low. We're usually fans of the thicker chili and this one was a little more liquidy, but I will definitely make again (and maybe add a can of tomato paste) and it tasted great!

Like others, I used this recipe as a "rough guide".  My fridge was housing two pounds of ground turkey and a ton of veggies that needed to be cooked up. I doubled the recipe, left out the chili powder and only used 1/8th tsp of cayenne powder since I have a two year old (he loved this dish by the way).  Onions, carrots, and garlic were sauteed in olive oil and butter first, then removed to make way for the two pounds of ground turkey (season with your favorite stuff). The beans were not mashed and I used what I had on hand (red kidney and canneli). For veggies, I literally dumped in everything that needed to go: chopped broccoli and cauliflower, chopped bell pepper, cubed butternut squash, diced potatoes, a can of corn, and baby oyster mushrooms. Along with the diced tomatoes, a can of tomato paste was added. Chicken stock was used in place of water. This beastly concoction simmered for roughly 1.5-2 hours,  and was served with chopped green onion, a bit of shredded cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. Tortilla chips were served on the side. My husband, 2 sons, brother-in-law, and good friend all raved about it. What started out as a simple chili became a hearty, "clean-out-the-fridge", healthy and chunky meal.

I needed something to make for the club where I DJ at. I always cook on Friday or Saturday nights, so I decided to use this chili turkey recipe. it turned out wonderful the whole club loved it..  I had to make a batch equivalent to 16 qrts. I was ask again to make another batch for the following night. The only changes I made was instead of crushed tomatoes I use diced tomatoes with basil or oregano and onion, and I added unsweetened corn to each batch(4 -quadrupling the recipe) it was definitely a hit and I will keep this recipe.  Others changes I also use 1/4 tps.  of cayenne and a tps. of slap your mama to the recipe it added a great flavor and 1 cup Mexican cheese p/b( p/batch) as well as 1/4 c sour cream p/b total cost to feed $35-$50 bucks feeding over 20 ppl with 2to 3 helping.
Also, me no crushy beans. PRESENTATION IS 30%.
 SIGHT IS THE BEGINNING OF "LET ME ?? WHAT I WANT TO EAT"

My chili tastes perfect, although I used my slow cooker for about 4 hours and I used extra virgin olive oil as well

At first, it was too soupy. I added cans of corn and black beans. I also added  kidney beans I had cooked on hand. Also added some leftover rice I had in fridge.
My husband just loved it served over one/half of a baked russet potato. Served with sour cream. Wished I could have added some chopped scallions.

Very easy to make. Very tasty (even my 1 1/2 year grandchild ate it...spices and all. Personally I prefer a more "robust" chili...less soup like. I repeated the process today and added a can of Cannellini beans for extra robust-ness. I think even a can of canned corn would even help...just have to cut back on the water.

This is a good basic chili recipe. I prefer my chili thicker, so next time I’d omit the water. And kick up the chili powder for more flavor. I  also added black beans as well as the kidney beans and didn’t crush any of them. I’d make it again, and might use ground bison instead of turkey.

It was just OK. I used less cayenne pepper. I would use half the water. I think the water killed the taste. Too bland for me. I will try it again with half the water.

This is a good basic recipe. I doubled the spices and added two diced de-seeded Fresno chillies. It probably could have used more heat but next time...

Changes to recipe:
• doubled spices
• added two diced de-seeded Fresno chillies
• added more salt to taste. (actually added salt and pepper to ground turkey during browning)
• I like corn in my chili so, added 1-can of drained corn.

Almost the best turkey chili ever! I double the beans - mash one can and put the others in whole  - otherwise it's too soupy for my taste. I also substitute chicken stock for water. To make it perfect I add some corn, and the garnish with old cheddar cheese and blue corn chips. Amazing!

This was excellent and full of flavor.  Probably my favorite chili recipe I've used thus far.   I added frozen corn and black beans as I like them in my chili and it's an inexpensive way to increase the servings.  I may add a bit less chili powder next time (maybe 1.5 TBP) to tone down the heat a bit.  I also reduced to one cup of water (instead of two) as I like my chili heartier and less "soupy."

Yes, I made changes but these were minimal.  I use extra lean ground turkey, black beans (in place of kidney beans), and I add two diced jalapeno peppers and a half of a red bell pepper, also diced.  I cook the turkey first, then do the onions separately before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also shorten the simmering time at the end.  This chili has absolutely the best mix of spices for excellent flavor with the right amount of heat.  Great with shredded cheese on top and accompanied by corn chips.  Thank you, Allrecipes!

I'm on Weight Watchers and when I added a can of black beans (smashed half of the kidney and half of the black) and only used 1 cup water, it was 2 points per cup. YAY! Nutritious, filling and perfectly spiced. I have now pre-measured all spices in 2 small prep bows with covers so I can quickly make again and again.  Never buying .99 cent packets from the store again!

This may have been my fault, but the chili was somewhat flavorless. Not enough spice. Next time I will be adding a tad more of each spice.

I cooked the onions until transluscent and then added garlic and two lbs of turkey. I then added the spices and cooked until the turkey was no longer too moist. I only added two cups of broth for the two lbs of turkey. Anymore and it would’ve been too soupy. I also added more salt since I was making a larger portion. I suggest adding what the instructions say and then tweeting it to taste

Added a yellow pepper and only used 1/4 tsp cayenne. If you smash the beans as called for the chili is super thick.  Used black beans as the smashed ones and white whole.  Very good.

Would add more meat and cook it down a little more to make it thicker next time. Good flavour with a little bit of heat.

This was the best chili recipe I have ran into so for. I've tried unhealthier recipes with bacon and beef and this one tastes better than those. The only thing I add in our green and red bell peppers and to the health.

Using the OP's additional suggestions I cooked the onion and garlic in olive oil until tender, then put in the ground turkey and added the spices (omitting the cayenne pepper) once it was browned. I let that cook for a few minutes then added 2 cans of kidney beans, 1 can of black beans, the tomatoes and 1 cup of chicken broth. I let that all simmer for 2 hrs and served with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips and bread and margarine.  It was amazing! 4 stars because I did change a few things to suit our preferences. Hubby said it needs to go into our regular meal rotation!!

I cooked it down because I found that 30 minutes wasn't long enough (like it thicker). Also, I forgot to mash the beans so at the end of the cooking time (an hour)  I used my immersion blender to puree it. I served it with chopped avocado and a dollop of plain yogurt. Cilantro on top would be a good touch, too. This was very flavorful. I will make it again.

Pretty good chili recipe for turkey meat. I used chicken broth vs water, added frozen sweet corn, and topped with cheese. Really finished the recipe. Careful with the cayenne pepper if you aren't a spicy fan.

This is my second time trying this recipe, this time with a few adjustments. I substituted chicken stock for water, and halved the quantity of the same. Added a full teaspoon of cumin, and added extra chilli powder. Th e outcome was flavorful and hearty.

I wanted to like this but it was way to spicy for me. I followed the recipe exactly and I’m wondering if it should be 2 tsp of chili powder instead of 2 tbsp?? I ended up serving it as a topping on rice and sweet potatoes, since it was as too hot for me to eat on its own.

Used smoked paprika, sooooo good. I also mashed some of the beans before adding to make a thick gravy for the chili.

I've made this recipe a number of times. The first time I made it as is, it is rated for the recipe that it is. Next time I used  ground beef  instead of the turkey mentioned. I use stuff up that I may have left over, this time it was some corn, I also like chick peas and added them I like this one cause it is easy, not so much cutting and chopping and just a few cans. I personally cut back on the cayenne due to our taste. I change it up almost every time but keep the crushed tomatoes the kidney beans and the same amount of spices (except the cayenne) and the same amount of water. Love it still. Once in a while I do go all out and try another recipe with tons of ingredients, but for the basic family week night  Chili dinner this is usually it.

Sooooo good, I used just pinto beans cause I did not have kidney on hand and I added chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for more spice. This is a really good recipe. I've had chili beans for 3 days lol

I followed the recipe except for the following. Used 1 cup of water instead of 2, which Im glad I did. Added 2 tbsps. of brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon. This gave it a delicious sweet flavor. I forgot to add cayenne pepper. This was good. Just not great. Ive had better chili.

Ok, this chili was really good, but i'm not gonna rate it 5 stars since I added my own touches.
I made a double batch, so that changed a bit. 
1) I used chicken broth instead of water. 
2) I added the whole can of crushed tomatoes (in other words, I included the tomato juice.) 
3)I also added a can of corn. 
Tbh,  I would have added more garlic. But heyyyyy, my fam loved it and it was gone the next day.  
I recommend this for those who are a bit on edge with their cooking, cuz you can actually be rather loose with it, and still get good results. Have fun, all you who scroll down to read random comments!

This is an awesome recipe! I have never made chili before but with this recipe and some added suggestions it was perfect!! I made the chili with ground hamburger and a can of black beans with the kidney beans. I also added a diced small green bell pepper and a small can of green chiles. I agree with the suggestion of cooking it an hour instead of a half hour. Oh and I didn't smash the beans.. I can't wait to taste it tomorrow, I bet it will be even better!

My boyfriend and I tried this chili and enjoyed it! Was it the most amazing chili ever? No, but it was still tasty and simple. I'm definitely going to check out people's recommendations to improve it. 

Quick side note. We read a few of reviews that said that this recipe was too spicy or not not spicy enough. If you can't handle something like hot cheetos or medium salsa the this will be too spicy. If you can easily handle those things you might need to add more spice while cooking.

I modified this recipe by adding one extra white onion (small), one extra can of kidney beans, a can of diced roasted tomato, a can  of garbanzo beans, 1 green bell peppers, a can of whole Corn kernels and I  replace the turkey with a mourning dove. All in all it turned out well!

This is my go to recipe and I love it! I feel it's more of a turkey chili soup then actual chili...  I add a few extra indgredients: celery, green pepper and cilantro along with some extra salt to taste and use any kind of beans at hand! Garnish with some sour cream or cheddar cheese and scallions and bam!

It doesn't need all that water. I had to use a spoon with holes to strain the chili when putting it in the bowl. It was super runny. Tasted great though.

This chili was a hit! I followed the previous reviews and omitted the water and hot stuff but doubled the cumin and added Montreal steak powder in lieu of the paprika I didn't have.  I shouldn't have added the brown sugar though.  And next time I'm going to rinse out the canned kidney beans before adding.  I started by sautéing the turkey, onion and garlic, and then only added one can of tomato instead of two. I also added fresh diced tomatoes and a celery stalk.  The best reco was to simmer the whole thing in low heat for hours.  You really get the flavor penetrating the turkey.  Will definitely keep this one to use and reuse!!

Great recipe! I added half of a red bell pepper and a whole jalepeno (seeds stripped), it was quite spicy but really good. Next time I'll cut down on the cayenne if I am adding jalepeno!

Es muy buena receta, principalmente porque es sencilla. Solo dos sugerencias: reduce el chile powder a una teaspoon y el comino o cumin a mucho menos de lo que se indica. El comino es una especia muy fuerte que suele super ponerse al resto de las especias y dejar un fuerte sabor que provocará que los más chicos de la casa no quieran comer el chilli y que seguramente te provocará agruras

This is my favorite chili recipe. The ingredients are simple and the instructions are super easy. I generally use one can of cannellini beans and one can of kidney. I've never mushed them. I also substitute one teaspoon of chipotle chili powder for one teaspoon of regular chili powder, but like I said above the recipe is perfect as is!

First time making chili, and I thought this recipe was great! I followed it exactly as the recipe called for minus onions (not a fan). I recommend this recipe!

This is my go-to chili recipe.  I love it.  Followed the recipe to the T the first time around.  And, although I adored its spiciness and flavor, it was too much for the others in my family.  Here are the changes I made to make it more "spice-challenged" friendly while keeping that authentic chili flavor: 1 t. Chili powder (or chipotle powder for more of a smoky chili flavor) down from 2T.  I omit the cayenne pepper completely.  Even a small amount of this is an assault to one with a sensitive palate. 1t of other spices, to make up for the lack of extra chili powder.  I also add extra beans.  On top of the kidney beans, I add a can of black beans and a can of cannellini beans.  (Don't try garbanzo beans in this chili-the texture is all wrong!). And I use low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  I realize this seems like a lot of changes.  But they're more "adjustments" than changes.  On the whole, you can't go wrong with this recipe.  Just be aware of the amount of spice in it.  There's a lot there.

Copying n pasting from another reviewer.  Wish I had read reviews before.  Watery, bland but too hot - way too much chili powder, and I even cut the cayenne in half - but no other flavor than that.  If you are a chili expert feel free to doctor it up as most of the positive reviews seem to have done.  Sorry.

This was great for someone who can't really handle spicy things but doesn't mind a kick.  Mine turned out a little thinner liquid wise than I expected.  I don’t know if that's my fault or the recipe, but I will definitely be trying this recipe again.

I made this recipe for 32 people -- every single person raved over how delicious it was.  I substituted grated Manchego cheese for cheddar and added chopped fresh Cilantro -- super yummy.

This was great -  I was shocked how fast it was!  I left out the cayenne pepper.  Way too hot!  Next time, I'll probably only use one cup of water – 2 cups was pretty soupy. To take up the water, I added,  in addition to the red kidney beans, black beans, mild  chili beans, and also green beans! And  some frozen corn, as somebody else suggested.   Turkey and veggie chili.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I followed the exact recipe but just added some chopped up celery stalks and mixed them in with the onions. It was really good but it was still missing a little something, and I couldn't put my finger on it so I added in a splash of lemon juice. Seemed to work pretty well! I've made it twice and it's been great each time. A definite keeper :) Thank you for sharing!!

This wasn't terrible, but it was incredibly bland. I had to add more - more spices, more beans (I added a can of pintos as well), more everything except water and tomatoes. That being said, I'm from Texas so maybe I've just been skewed by eating the best chili on the planet my whole life. :3

Very good! I used a 1.5 tbs of chili powder instead of 2 tbs and added chopped pickled jalapenos! I also substituted black beans for kidney beans. Mom loved it and I didn't tell her it was Turkey!

Ok I didn't have all ingredients but it came our great. No beans and substituted 1 cup marinara in place of the tomatoes and about a cup of water instead of 2. The turkey was simply chopped up leftovers and I added a yellow pepper. What makes this great a and adaptable are the spices, very yummy!

Very good and good for you if you use lean turkey and crushed tomatoes with no salt added. I added white wine and chicken stock to boost the flavor. Tasty and simple!

This was a great recipe although I made a few changes to make it better for my taste. Instead of water, I put organic chicken broth (only used 1 cup) and I added 3/4 green pepper. I also added kidney beans and doubled the crushed tomatoes and put 2 tbsp. of cumin. The cayenne pepper is optional for me...my hubby and I both like it but if I have to serve this to my very close friends and/or family, I would put very little of it or nothing at all.

This is my go to chili recipe.  I usually double it so I have plenty to last all week.  I don't bother mashing the beans.  Yesterday I added a bag of riced broccoli to it for extra nutrition.  The kids didn't notice!

This is a great base recipe!  Because I was in a hurry, I grabbed one 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes and one tomato sauce. Iinstead of two diced tomatoes. I didn't add as much water because I like it thicker, but it  really turned out well and I will make it again.

Very, very good. I used 1.5 pounds of turkey, as that was the size of the package.  I cooked it along with 3/4 onion.  I used 2 15oz cans of diced tomatoes, 3 cans of beans (black, northern and garbanzo--just what happened to be in the pantry). I added 2 tsp of "better than bullion" with the 2 cups of water. I doubled the cumin to a full tsp and used 1/2 tsp garlic powder in lieu of fresh, as I was out.  Otherwise followed the recipe.   Served with sour cream and shredded cheddar jack. Delicious!

My go to recipe for chili – it's simple easy healthy and really delicious. We have a toddler at home so I cut down some of that hotter spices.  We also like a lot of vegetables so I add corn, more beans and tomatoes!

Deliciousness! !  I greatly enjoyed this recipe- but I will say that for anyone who cannot tolerate spice, cut down on the cayenne pepper or add 1-2 tsps. of Ketchup to help offset the spice. I also added a half of bell pepper and cooked it with the onion and turkey and felt the recipe needed another can of chili beans and a tad bit more of garlic. But I will DEFINITELY make it again!

It is delicious and very easy to make.  Unfortunately, I didn't have all of the ingredients and had to improvise.  I used black beans instead of kidney beans which still worked out good. The kids tried it and loved it.  It was a bit spicy for them but nevertheless they still ate it. Its good with some tortilla chips too.

A very good tasting chili, I substituted chicken broth for the water. For my preference, it was a bit too runny though. Next time I'll cut the liquid, broth in my case by a third or half or add more beans.

I made by the recipe except I added one can each of black beans and pinto beans (drained) instead of kidney beans. I also added a diced red bell pepper to the mix (sautéed along with the onions and garlic) and a cup of white corn just before the chili was finished cooking.  My family loved it. Omitting extra salt and using salt free chicken broth instead of water made this chili heart healthy and delicious!

I doubled the spices and added a dash of cinnamon (as someone recommended). Reduced the water to 1.5 cups.  I mixed it all up and put it in the pressure cooker on the chilli setting for 30 minutes. I grated cheddar cheese on top and served it! Rave reviews from everyone!!

I was impressed with the result and the simplicity compared with other chili's I've made.  My version added half a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder and a dash of liquid smoke.  Did it over elbow macaroni with shredded Mexican cheese for a delicious chili-mac.  My 9 year old loved it!

Wow! Honestly the best chili I ever made! Followed all spices to the exact except that I was out of chili powder...it didn't need it! Plenty spices here! Sautéed onion and garlic in oil and then added ground turkey. Added 1 cup of chicken broth, two cans of kidney beans, one can black beans. All recipes are made for tweaking here and there but this sauce is perfection! I could eat the entire pot!

I made this exactly as written. Unfortunately, it was a little bland for our family and I couldn't quite doctor it up to make it work after the fact. I'll be sticking to our "usual" chili recipe, but glad many folks seem to enjoy it.

This recipe is a staple in my house. I've made it many times and have tried various tweaks. I add one chopped, seeded jalapeño when the kiddo is having some. For just the adults I double the jalapeños or use a serrano pepper.  I prefer all black beans or half kidney half black and only mash half the beans. I like to add a teaspoon of cinnamon and tablespoon of brown sugar.   I cut way back on the water, only add what is needed.  I usually serve with some crusty corn bread baked in a cast iron skillet.

It is so easy and simple. I accidentally doubled the amount of cumin, cayenne, paprika and oregano (1 tsp each) and it still turned out really delicious. The spiciness was just right for me and my fiancé. I sautéed the onions, garlic and spices before adding the turkey. So yummy! Can't wait to make it again! :)

Great recipe!  Very flavorful and easy to do. I modified it just a little by mixing turkey breast and turkey thigh, adding a bell pepper,  reducing the amount of water and crushed tomatoes used and added a little tomato paste to thicken it. Yummy!!!!! :)

I'm not a big chili person, but my husband is.  I have made chicken chili for some time that we like, but he really missed the more traditional kind.  (He hasn't had it in a while because he is allergic to beef and pork).  I made this tonight with a few variations.  We like things quite pica so I used a heaping 1/2 tsp of the cayenne as well as 3 diced Serrano peppers.  I also toasted the seasonings shortly after adding the peppers, onions, and garlic.  Used smoked paprika instead of regular and chicken broth instead of water.  Fresh, homemade beans instead of canned.  (They happened to be pinto because it was in the cupboard but I like kidney better).  This gave it a much different flavor.  Sprinkle some homemade honey cornbread on that - yum!

I have been making this for the past few years and absolutely love it.  My family and friends love it to.  I followed the recipe the first time but the only changes I made is to reduce the water and add a can of diced tomatoes, drained black beans and red pepper flakes.

This is an awesomely simple recipe, and it's delicious! I did make a couple of changes. Instead of 1 can of beans, I did 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans. I also added a can of corn. There is just too much water for just 1 can of beans. Otherwise, the spices are perfectly proportioned, and it's a nice smoky, slightly spicy chili. I have made it probably a dozen times now, and it's perfect!

This recipes is fantastic and so versatile. 

A few tips:

- I  doubled the amount of kidney beans added for a thicker chili.
- The spices are definitely  flexible (I forgot chili powder this week and just played around with the other recommended spices)
- you really need to give your onions a few minutes before you throw in the beef, they don't cook through enough if you add them at the end to brown and then simmer for 30 mins.

What I love about this chili is that it is so easy!  I did add 1/2 diced red bell pepper and 1/2 minced jalapeno because they were in my frig and I wanted to use them up.  Also on a whim I added 1/2 tsp of turmeric in with the other seasonings, and it gave it a nice earthy flavor and pretty golden color. 

I will make this one of my go-to recipes for sure!

Made it for the first time, definitely a 5 star recipe. Incredibly easy, very quick, hearty yet requiring few ingredients. Will make it again for sure.
I did use vegetable broth in lieu of water and sautéed the onion and a bit more veg prior to adding the turkey.

This was so simple and so good. I used what I had - so used a chili beans and didn't have chili powder but looked up recipe for that and just winged it with the spices I had. Added some cheddar and onion in each bowl - delish and inexpensive!

I made it as described and it was superb (5 stars).  I did make it again and tweaked it slightly to suit my tastes and it was also great. I only put 1 cup of water, and added a can of kidney beans, can of corn and doubled the cumin and paprika. Wrapped it in a tortilla and served it with sour cream and cheddar cheese.

This gets 5 Stars with a few revisions. 
I added Rotel instead of crushed tomatoes. 
I added half a can of gold/white corn.
I added Cinnamon.
I used chicken broth instead of water
I used white beans and didn't mash.

Try It! Enjoy!

A wee bit spicy but it is full of flavor and very easy to make. It's difficult to screw up this recipe. You add whatever extras you like and this chili will still be great! Thanks for posting.

This is a great base recipe.  The first time I made it just like it said and I didn't think it was that great.  The second time I tweaked it to make it my own and I will make it like this from now on.  I increased the salt to 2.5 tsp, decreased the chili powder to 1.5 tbsp, added a 4 ounce can of fire roasted mild green chiles, added 1 tsp of unsweetened baking cocoa and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I did not mash the kidney beans.  Delicious!

LOVED IT!  Due to medical reasons I have to be on a low fat and no dairy product diet.  I have been trying to get into eating more beans because they are healthy. I hate chili but this recipie was great!  Instead of 2 cans of kidney beans I used 1 kidney 1 black,  both with no sodium.  I also used organic low sodium chicken broth.  My husband loved it too and he loves full fat chili so this is going to be a great recipie to keep around!

Loved it. We modified to make it more smokey and substituted the cayanne powder w/ 2chipotle peppers in adobe sauce.

To make it more naughty, we added 4 slices of chopped smoked bacon with fat juice and simmered for 60 minutes before serving. 

Delicious!! Next time we make it, we will cut back the chili power to 3/4 of what the recipe calls for.

I didn't like it at all after making it, but then I added chopped green peppers, crushed red pepper flakes and several big slashes of Cholula hot sauce and left it in the crock pot on high for about an hour and then low for about 3 hours and then on the "serve" setting for 8 more hours...and it became DELICIOUS!! I'll definitely make it that way again.

Followed some changes and added 1 green pepper; used low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  Added 1 can Rotell Original and petite diced tomatoes with no salt added (equaling 28 oz).  Used Great Northern beans and did not mash up!  Husband gave it 5 stars.  Colorful presentation and served with Fritoes!  This is a keeper.  The second time I added 1 cup black refried beans as it was too soupy.

Made as recipe states: 5 stars very flavorful somewhat spicy
To all the haters that made changes to the recipe and then didn't like it...what is your problem???!!!  Rate the recipe as is.  It probably sucks because you changed it!  
Changes I've adopted  that kick it up a notch:
Sub ground beef for turkey 
Sautee 1 chopped red bell pepper with the beef and onion mixture 
Add a can of rinsed black beans in addition to the can of kidney beans (I don't even bother to mash)
Add 2 beef bouillon cubes with the 2 C water

I've even used fresh tomatoes from my garden in place of canned.  Just boil for 60 seconds to remove skins and chop.

I like to let it simmer with the lid off for about 15 minutes extra to let it thicken

Great served over a baked potato or as a topping on hot dogs

I make this chili all the time. It's absolutely delicious. I don't mash the kidneys and I usually add a pepper to it. Other than that I make it as directed. So good!

Suggestions- if you like your chili a little spicier add a lot more cayenne red pepper and chili powder to the mix. I used a little more garlic and cumin as well. Use dark red kidney beans and mash half for a better texture.

A great basic recipe you can add things to it you like best in a chilli or make it as is. The spice combo was really tasty but hot ! So adjust accordingly if you prefer a milder chilli. I added a tin of sweetcorn & a tin of black beans because I love them & a chicken stock cube for an extra seasoning punch. I mashed the kidney beans as per recipe  & this made for a lovely thick sauce. This is now my go to turkey chilli.

This recipe is phenomenal. I have made this 5 times now and make the following changes: I do not add ANY water! With the recommended amount, I find it is too watered down for my liking. On the contrary, I think many would find the way I do it too thick (consider adding only half the water!). I do not mash the beans as I like the texture of full beans. Also, if you take out some water, you might want to go easier on the spices because it can be a bit spicy, which I love! The best part of this, of course, is it's healthy! The fiance requests I make this every single week. Will continue to make!

Liked it. Didn't have tomatoes, but added a little bit more red onion and garlic. Used leftover black beans and a bit of homemade barbecue sauce to liven up little bit. Also simmered a bit longer to get a thicker, which I like.

Incredibly good and easy recipe ! One should know that turkey, while a lot healthier than beef, can be replaced by tofu. I would also add a bit of corn and red hot chili peppers, just to enhance the recipe a bit.

A good, simple recipe. A few changes based on what I had in the kitchen. I started with a mire poix of chopped carrots, onions and garlic, then cooked turkey. I  added a can of Mexican seasoned tomatoes, tomato paste, black beans,  corn and 1/2 C. red wine. Yummy.

Amazing! This tastes so rich and creamy I couldn't believe it wasn't insanely fattening. I tried a few of the tips in other reviews but it's really just up to your tastes- the recipe as written is excellent as is. I added some corn and extra beans to make it last longer and it lasted us a few days. So affordable, easy to keep the ingredients on hand , and I felt very accomplished - this will certainly be a frequent go-to!

This was good. Used no chili pepper and only dash of cayenne pepper so the little guys would be okay. I also added a can of black beans and did not mash the kidney. I also threw in a can of creamed corn to add a bit of sweetness and to help thicken the chili up. I also used chicken broth instead of water. Served with sour cream and cheese on top. I let this summer for a few hours before serving.

I love this recipe! For the crushed tomatoes I use Hunts Seasoned Tomato Sauce for Chili and I also add green pepper. Other than that I follow the recipe as directed. I like to serve it with the options of sour cream and or shredded cheese (for those who can't handle the spiciness), along with HEB brand Vegetable bite size crackers. I have made it 3 time in the last two weeks upon request. It has been a hit!

I love this as is, or as I make it. :) I add one, extra, can of beans; I use larger tomatoes, and I cook it in the Crock Pot, on low, for about four hours. It turns out perfect, every time.

As always made small changes due to taste preferences, but this is a really simple and great base recipe for chili to make in the crock pot.  The seasonings cook together so well...it's delicious!

Great recipe!  I made a few changes.  Reduced the garlic amount to Only one teaspoon;  used chicken broth instead of water; used two cans of kidneys; and then i used diced tomatoes with zesty green chilis.  Yummy!!

We made it with elk and used a pound and a half of meat instead of one pound so it needed about 1/2 to 3/4 tsp. more salt.  I added a bit of sugar since my normal recipe calls for sugar. I didn't mash the beans and used pinto instead because that's what my family prefers. We served it with Fritos, chopped onion, grated cheddar and sour cream. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is very good, light and easy! I made a few changes... used about 1.5 lbs of ground turkey, a can of diced tomatoes with chiles instead of the crushed tomatoes,  1.5 cups of chicken stock instead of water,  a can of black beans instead of kidney beans and 1 green pepper. I used more spices/herbs since I used more ground turkey but less chili powder since the tomatoes had chiles, and I didn't want it to be very spicy.

I made this recipe and it's a keeper. Ofcourse like most cooks we add additional items (i.e extra spices per ones preference), I also added corn. These things do not take away from the integrity of the recipe.

This turned out really well, especially for my first-ever attempt at chili! I made a few modifications: instead of water, I used garlic-infused chicken stock to allow even more flavor, and instead of simmering the chili on the stove, I browned the turkey and onions together and threw it all in the Crock-Pot for four hours to really allow the flavors to combine.

So the recipe was quite bland for my taste as is....We made a couple additions that I feel made it  5 star worthy. This is a good start though and you can tweek it as you please to suit your individual tastes. 

As suggested we used the diced tomatoes with chillis, also added about 1/2 can tomato paste, 1 packet of sazon goya, about 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 3 stalks celery chopped, 3 carrots chopped, and 1 can of garbanzo beans. 

We upped the kidney beans to almost 2 cans, and increased cumin to 1 1/2 tsp, chili powder to 2 1/2 tbsp. We brought to a boil and let simmer for ~ 2 hours.  It was delicious !

I don't drain the kidney beans, nor do I add any water. We like to eat with pieces of baked potato, sprinkled with cheese, adding a spoon of sour cream.

Excellent  & easy recipe. You really can tweak it to your liking!  I added diced mini bell peppers and corn I  had on hand for extra veggies. I also added a dash of cinnamon as recommended. I used non-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to top as well as low fat cheddar. I also made a brown rice & quinoa  side dish. Yum!

I'm usually a 5 alarm chili all day in the slow cooker kind of guy but my wife doesn't like anything above a 2 alarm. We had left over turkey burger and my wife came across this recipe for a quick dinner. My changes....used 1 cup of broth instead of 2 (helps with the soupiness some are complaining about) Also used diced tomatoes instead of crushes and added a small can of tomato paste, again to make it more hearty and less soupy. I uped the chili powder a bit and let it simmer for 45 mins. Delicious served over simple white rice. Highly suggest trying with or without my changes.

Love this.  I add Rotelle tomatoes, but cut down on the red & black pepper and cumin.  My husband likes it over Fritos but I eat it over a 1/2 baked potato to have lower calories.

This is the 2nd time I've made this. I read other reviews which I've appreciated for some of their tips & tricks. I like cooking the onions 1st & then pulling out & setting aside to add back after the meat has been browned.

Great recipe! I sautéed  onion and garlic for about 5 mins. Drained it then added the turkey.   Only had diced tomatoes but they worked perfectly. Will add a can of black beans next time..just because:)

Made this chili for the first time tonight. I added a can of mild chili beans because I like more beans. I also added 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the water. Other than that I left it alone and simmered it for an hour. After tasting it the seasonings needed tweaking. I wound up doubling the chili powder and cumin and simmered for another hour. This was hands down some of the best chili I've ever had, great with some cornbread. Wife loved it. Thank you so much, this will be a repeat all winter long.

Fabulous! I added green peppers and celery with the onions, and a dill pickle after it finished cooking for a different flavor and texture. I would have added frozen corn if I had any, but other than those additions, this recipe is great!

Make this turkey chilli at least once a month when the weather turns cooler. I add a diced red and a diced green pepper to bulk it up and add flavor. I also add a can of diced green chillis. Only use one cup of water. Seasonings as directed. Family loves it!

I added black beans and more chili powder since I don't eat hot food. This chili was so wonderful that I could eat it everyday. And that's saying something since I like variety in my diet.

This is a great recipe.  I added an extra can of beans, just because.  Otherwise, the spices are right on!  I make this often.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good my first try. Not quite hearty enough. I used 1 cup of broth and added chili beans (forgot to drain the kidney beans) I will make again; remembering to drain the beans

This is a good simple recipe, easy to make. I cut the water used in half, so it's not so soupy. I also added another can of beans, to thicken it up.

This recipe was great, but it needed a little more flavor and texture adjustment. In my batch, I used chicken broth (1/2 of the amount of liquid called for), added about 2 more tbsp of chili powder, 1 tbsp of cumin extra, and I added about 2 tbsp of brown sugar. Additionally, I let the chili simmer for 15 mins coverer but then removed the lid for the other 15 so that the chili would be thicker and more hearty.  Garnishing with cheddar cheese at the end is a must as it makes the chili more velvety.

Like others, used mixed beans and added carrots and red peppers.  Also added a scotch bonnet pepper and substituted a cup of chicken broth and a cup of dark ale for the water.

This was amazing and easy to make. I did add black beans instead of kidney beans because I like the way the black beans look and taste. I also added baby bell peppers to the onion when I sauté them. I added a half cup of corn and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. Everyone in the family loved it and it smelled amazing as it cooked.

I  only used 1 1/2 cup of water I do think it could be cut down to 1 cup. I used 16oz of black beans, 4oz of green chilies. I made with with some fresh cornbread it was super delicious and very hearty.

I omitted the oil and did not mash the beans, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The whole family loved it, it was the right amount of spicy and hearty. I served with a baked potato, cheddar cheese and sour cream. Great recipe!

I changed a few things and it turned fantastic! I didn't mash the kidney beans, left them whole. Added a can of sweet corn, fire roasted diced green chilis and awhile chopped green bell pepper. I also took another reviewers recommendation and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.

Excellent recipe. Very simple to make during the week. Unfortunately I thought I had chili powder, when in fact I didn't. Googled a substitute and voila! (FYI - chili powder is made from: cumin, cayenne pepper, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder. Roughly equal amounts of all, and adjust until you get the flavor you're looking for. If you don't have all of those ingredients, you can get by with just cumin, cayenne and paprika.) I also followed other reviewers' addition of cinnamon, nutmeg, a handful or so of chopped peppers, and an extra can of beans (I used cannellini). Well liked by all!

So good! So easy! I added way more of all seasonings (particularly cumin, salt and chili powder). Added garlic powder and red pepper flakes, and a touch of dried basil. I also used black beans instead of kidney beans. 

I only put about 1 cup of water and sauteed the onions separately before putting them in the pot to avoid crowding. 

My boyfriend and roommates loved it!! It's a new staple.

This is my go-to turkey chili recipe. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I added 2 tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder (the secret weapon for any chili - I swear!!!), 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp Splenda (would use brown sugar, but my glucose is on the higher side), and chicken broth instead of water. Aside from that, follow the directions. However, if you have the time, let it simmer as long as possible, allowing the flavors to marry. Yummy!!!

This is bubbling on the stove now. I made only a few changes. I doubled kidney beans, because I love beans in chili. Added a tsp. Of sugar and tomato paste. I don't like spicy and I'm feeding a toddler so no cayenne . I Love simple one pot meals , when it's finished will top with reduced fat sour and shredded cheddar cheese! Yummo!!

So simple and so delicious! I substituted chicken broth for the water.  Just givesuper it more flavor!  Perhaps next time a bit less on the chili powder... but that's just my personal preference.

Really nice recipe. I especially like the mashed beans. Flavor are nice but not spicy enough for my taste - suggest you add more pepper or even add jalapeño if you like a spicy chili. Overall really great!

I love, love, love this chili. My daughter found it for me and we've made it ever since.  We pre-make the seasoning ahead of time so that we don't have to measure it out every time.

I make this all the time...I always make sure to have the ingredients on hand because it's such an easy and super healthy, quick dinner! I just made it tonight with fresh tomatoes instead of canned and it tastes probably the same...maybe a little "fresher." Whenever I make it, I don't bother mashing the beans and its totally fine. I serve it with avocado sliced on top instead of sour cream and I sprinkle crushed tortilla chips on top for some extra crunch! Honestly, this recipe needs no adjustments in my opinion! It's always a crowd pleaser and I love that it is SOOOO low cal and healthy!

This is the best chili I've ever made or eaten.

 I made quite a few changes.  I added:
1 can of corn; 1 can of black beans; 1 small jalapeño; 1 red bell pepper;  3 small carrots; 1 zucchini. 


I only used 1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder and I didn't mash the kidney beans.

Easy and delicious. After reading the reviews, I decided to tweak the recipe. I used 1 cup of water and added chicken bullion to it, instead of using 2 cups of plain water. I served over rice with shredded cheddar cheese on top.

This recipe is great and so hearty. The only thing I did differently was add a 16oz can of pinto beans and a 16oz can of black beans. Just to stretc portions and make more filling. Served over white rice with shredded cheese and crushed saltine crackers. YUM! Thanks for a great recipe

First time I've ever made chili - not bad but I felt like it was missing something.  Was super easy though so I will definitely make it again and try some additional things. Changed a few things based on other reviewers - used 1 c chic stock instead of 2 c water, added an extra can of black beans and didn't mash them.  Will see if it tastes better the next day, as is usually the case.  But definitely a good, easy starting point.
Update: definitely better the next day! Will make again!Update: Next time will cut chili powder in half, too spicy for my 2yo

It was good but a little too spicy for the kids. Will tone that down next time. Also, I felt like it was a little too runny and tomatoey. I added sugar to correct the tomatoey and will add less water next time. I felt like it was missing 1 spice but can't put my finger on it. Will have to experiment.

I thought it was too spicy.  I added extra 2 cups of chicken stock and wish I had put 1/2 the black pepper in.  Sour cream helps to cool it down.

A great recipe, but like others I find it more thin than what I like in a chilli. To fix this, follow the steps above but add twice as much turkey (I use extra lean beef, but I used turkey the first time and there's no taste difference, beef is just cheaper), and a can or two of drained diced tomatoes. I usually put this on the slow cooker on low for 8 hours, I also add a bell pepper, sliced mushrooms, a can of corn, a few carrots and some celery (about the same amount as what the onion/bell pepper is), a tsp of liquid smoke, and I double the spices, save paprika. With the paprika, add the normal amount and another 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika. The best part to this is then you add beer (a Stout is a great choice) instead of water until the slow cooker is full. Sit back and let the whole house smell delicious.
Oh, if you go the slow cooker route, cook off the meat before adding it (for beginners).

The recipe is yummy ,delicious ,deep and not too spicy. At the end of following all the directions I ended up adding a little over a tablespoon of cocoa and A dash of cinnamon.  Wow it is good.  It's too bad that I live in Miami or else I would make this in the winters a lot.

This was indeed quite simple and really pretty good. I'll make it again. Changes: Only added about 1/2 cup of water, which made it very thick (as we like it). I added a can of mild chili beans. I think that's it!

Such a delicious chili, and healthier! I made this as is and is probably one of my favorite chili recipes. Good choice if you are watching what you eat, but want a filling delicious meal.

I followed the advice of another and added cinnamon and green chilies.  I serve chili in an acorn squash cut like a bowl.  So delicious.

Very disappointing!  I've never had an issue with a recipe rated so highly but I wasn't a fan of this one.  I doubled it which possibly affected the final product.  Didn't care for the smokey flavor. I added tomato paste which helped a little bit.

Great base recipe - and given how quickly it can be tossed together, this has made turkey chili a staple in my fall/winter rotation because it's just so good. As other reviewers said, best with broth instead of water, and careful with the cayenne if you don't want it too hot.

This is a recipe that I discovered a few years ago and keep coming back to it.  The recipe as is, is very good but is definitely more soupy than what I like for chili.  Here are a few small changes that I typically make: add another can of beans (typically black beans), a small can of green chiles, add one cup of chicken broth (omitting the 2 cups of water), reduce the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon.

Was delicious! I added a squirt of ketchup, 3 quarters of a  jalapeño and some chilli powder. I only put half the amount of water and cooked it uncovered so the excess water would evaporate and the chilli would thicken.

Was easy to make &  came out fantastic!  Only change I made was instead of 2Tb chili powder,  I used 1Tb chili powder,  and 1Tb hot "Mexican style"  for a little heat.  Glad I doubled the batch,  or I wouldn't have had any left to reheat for lunch.  And it truly does taste better the second day.  Will definitely make again

I write this review in the middle of summer as I sit here missing this chili but knowing the heat from the pot would overwhelm the A/C in my tiny apartment. I used beer instead of water, drained diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and didnt mash the beans, as I prefer a thinner chili. It's perfect! Sometimes I add corn, sometimes I add black beans, sometimes I use beef. I always serve it with cheddar cheese and usually corn bread. I'm making my mouth water so I better stop! Try it!!!

Going to try and make this recipe tonight i might have to leave out the cayenne pepper so its not too spicy for the kids. But i was wondering i bought two pounds of ground turkey so does that mean i have to double all the ingredients like 4 cups of water and 2 28oz cans of crushed tomotoes.

Great, easy recipe!  I changed it, however, but only for ingredients I had in my kitchen:  instead of the canned tomatoes I used a white corn and black bean salsa, instead of the kidney beans I used more black beans. I added a large chopped carrot, more garlic, and a bit of cinnamon. Oh, I also added a couple of small (like large cherry tomatoes in size) heirloom tomatoes, chopped. I'm serving it with jasmine rice, and avocado on the side.

Great recipe!  With just a few minor changes.  I didn't have a can of tomatoes, so I substituted tomato sauce.  Chili powder, paprika, cumin and cayenne are too spicy!  I like basil though so I added that.  Beans give me "digestion issues", so I left those out.  I decided the chili needed more body to make up for the lack of beans, so I layered it in a baking dish with cooked lasagna noodles.  Didn't have cheddar so I substituted mozzarella and Parmesan.  Baked it for 30 minutes to get a warm and bubbly topping!!  This is my new favorite chili recipe!!

I've made this over and over.  It's really good and very easy.  It can be a little watery so I add some corn starch to give it the thicker consistency that we like.  Love it!

This is a great chilI receipe. I added some of my own flavors to it. I added bay leaves, creole seasoning, basil, and yellow pepper to this recipe and it turned out delicious.  I also used an additional can of beans. I used one can of kidney beans and one can of pinto beans.

First time I made this and it came out really well. The only change was to add a can of corn.

Love this recipe! I've made it several times now with cheesy garlic biscuits.; however, I do add/change a few things. I added 1 heaping tsp of cumin instead of 1/2 tsp. Also, I soften the onions and minced garlic BEFORE I add the turkey to brown. Lastly, I added 2 tbs of Texas Pete hot sauce.

I have made this recipe before and it came out very good.  This time I made a double batch and it came out very soupy.  I had to remove some liquid and thicken the remainder with corn starch.

All four of us love this recipe, but my kids really crave it.  I add a can of black beans, a can of corn and several cloves of chopped garlic.  I also only add 1 cup of water -- we like it thick.  The leftovers freeze well.

This is a nice, simple chili recipe.  Even tastier the next day!  My husband really enjoyed this and said, "I could eat a lot of this."  I followed the recipe closely but substituted a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes for the crushed (it's what I had in the pantry) and added a can of undrained chili beans (can't skimp in the "magical fruit!").

I found it to be really bland and that's after I doubled the cumin, and added some coriander, onion powder, garlic powder, red chili flakes, a bay leaf, AND left out the water. The amount of spicy-ness was good and texture was good.

This is a good, easy, quick and healthy chili. Will definitely make again. Only things I did different: sauteed the garlic and onions first, then added the turkey meat. I didn't mash the beans. I also added frozen corn. It was delish and makes a nice big batch.

Great recipe.  Made this and it was huge hit!  However, next time I will only add 1/2 cup water, since it came out real watery.  Also since did not have red kidney beans on hand, used 1 can of fat free refried beans & added 2 chopped green peppers!

Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

This was my first time making chili, and it was a success! I ended up using whole kidney beans and cooking it down a bit longer because I found it to be a touch watery, but my whole family loved it. Super easy to make and had enough for leftovers for lunch the next few days.

Followed the recipe, but it came out very bland and watery. Maybe it would be better to use tomato sauce instead of water.

This was great, but I did make some changes, to tailor it to our taste.  I added a tble of coco powder and sugar, also a splash of Worcestershire, I left out the water and used 3 cans of tomato sauce/diced tomatoes.  I did not add onion or cayenne.  I also used 2 cans of beans, did not smash any.  I will use a little less chili powder next time as it was still a little spicy for the kids.

Best turkey chili simple ever!  But do NOT add water to the recipe and use diced tomatoes not crushed!  The water  just decreases the wonderful flavor.  You can always add a bit of water at the end if you like.

I don't add the cayenne pepper.  My kids don't like the chili if it is too spicy.  Do add one chopped onion to the recipe but make it a large sized onion.

Got a few extra minutes?  Include half a diced pepper and one grated carrot in the ingredients.  The chili will be even better!

I've never signed in as a member to any recipe site before, but I just had to tell you to try this chili.  You won't be disappointed.  Just don't add the water!

This recipe was great. I used all the required ingredients, and some of my own without following the exact measurements. All seasoning should be done to your taste, i also added a LITTLE SUGAR  for some sweetness and all the spices came together. Chile is a dish that should come together according to your taste buds, don't you agree?
Excellent response from my family, they ate the whole pot. Don't forget the Cheese and sour cream on top enjoy.

Surprisingly delicious!!  Even though I am definitely NOT a turkey fan, I enjoyed this dish..

Only used approximately half of the can of the crushed tomatoes; substituted pinto beans for kidney beans (don't like kidney beans), used only one cup of water - add more if needed.. added four large cloves of garlic along the other spices in the recipe, along with a bit of onion powder.. didn't measure just added what I thought would be appropriate..  served over elbow pasta with shredded cheddar cheese and onions.. Yummy on this cold snowy day... :)

Added can of kidney beans, can of corn.  Also sauteed chopped red pepper with onions at the beginning.  Pretty good taste.  I like that I'm getting less fat and calories with ground turkey.

Fantastic and actually simple. I only made minor changes to suit my taste: half as much liquid, chicken broth (Better Than Bouillon) instead of water, more garlic, and no cayenne in hopes that my 5-year-old would eat it (he didn't). I'm hanging on to this recipe and will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe for the first time a few days ago.  The chili came out delicious!! I am definitely not a chef by any means and this recipe was very easy to follow.  My wife instantly asked for more as soon as she tried it and we ate it for the next few days.  The first night it was a little soupy but overnight in the fridge gave it the perfect texture.  Will definitely recommend and cook again soon!

This recipe was fantastic!  My husband is picky when it comes to chili and he went back for seconds.  I am so happy that I finally found a recipe for ground turkey that wasn't dry or tasteless.

I have been making this for a few years.  Everyone raves about it from kids to elders. Only thing I do differently is add extra can of tomato and cut water in half and add chopped veggies to make it thicker and heartier. I also mash half the beans and leave half whole. Serve with Coen bread. Yum

I love this recipe, as does my family. However, it definitely needs to be salted-to-taste, because it's slightly under-seasoned. I also added about a tablespoon of sugar to the sauce to give it a hint of sweet and  substituted black beans for the kidney beans (I hate them!).

Easy to make, very good recipe. We don't like it spicy so we skip cayenne peppers, also use 1 cup water and 1 cup red wine. Thanks Amanda for this easy recipe

This is really good! I also add some ketchup and a can of chili to it. I skip the water all together. I don't like runny chili. I also don't really measure the spices. Just sort of guess ;) It always turns out amazing!! My husband also likes to add Frito's to it.

This tastes so much better than me and my boyfriend thought it would be! It's so good! We are so pleasantly surprised. Team healthy chili! We added a few more vegetables for heartiness and only used a little over a cup of water but overall stuck to the original recipe! So good and light, yet hearty!

Was a great, easy recipe. I added 28 oz of crushed tomato with Basil and then a 16oz can of diced tomatoes with chili flavors added. I omitted the water. Also added a can of black beans and a handful of diced carrots.  Then put it in the crock pot on high for a few hours (mainly to cook the carrots).  Came out great, making again today so I can freeze for my dad to thaw and use as needed.

I made a vegetarian version. No turkey. Added 2 sweet potatoes, and a bell pepper. Replaced 1 cup of water with 1 cup of beer for more flavor. Was a major hit with even the meat eaters :) so good 2 days in a row!

I tried this chili last night in the crockpot. I did tweak it as well; I sautéed the onions and garlic in the olive oil, then added the ground turkey. I cut out the water, and used 1 cup of chicken stock and two tins of kidney beans, red and white for color. I added cinnamon, Montreal Chicken Seasoning, hot sauce, lemon juice and chopped red peppers. This chili was delicious, and had some spicy kick to it! I will definitely be making this again and it is very versatile.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, would be five stars but I felt it was necessary to add a few extra ingredients. I added black beans in addition to the kidney beans. I also felt it was unnecessary to mash the beans, but to each their own. I also added corn (if you are a true chili fan this is probably a sin but I really like corn). It is very spicy so if you don't like spicy food or find them hard to handle I would suggest cutting down on some of the spices. Although I did add one Jalapeno to the recipe before I knew how spicy it would be because I like extra heat. Even with the extra heat my father and I enjoyed it, fortunately my mother was out of town because she cannot handle spicy food and this would have been too much. Serve with cheese, sour cream, onions, jalapenos, etc. Tastes good the next day as well.

This was absolutely delicious.  I made 2 very minor changes to the recipe, I used dried minced onion instead of fresh (food allergy) and, being from Kentucky, it's not chili without spaghetti, so I threw a small handfull in right at the end.

A couple of notes.  This was a touch on the spicy side for us, when I make this again, I will make a double batch, and double everything EXCEPT the spices.  Also, I was on the fence about adding the spaghetti at the end, but my chili was still very runny and hadn't thickened up much.  That small amount of pasta did the trick and it was a much thicker consistancy after.

Nothing brings the family outside to our remote camp like this chili in the dead of winter. We have spent many a night huddled together in the cold enjoying bowl after bowl after bowl of this intoxicating meal. All we can talk about for hours at a time is the rich flavor of this life tasting extraordinary meal, each bite with subtle hints of hope. Before we found solace in the bold original taste of this chili, we would fear for ourselves in the dark. Add 7 bulbs of garlic.

I used this recipe as a base recipe for my own Turkey Chili. Thank you so much for the simple recipe that i could easily doctor up! The rating is for how easy the recipe was and how easily it could be modified. Here are the things i added: 1/4 pnd more ground turkey i had, 1 can drained and rinsed white kidney beans, (i mashed half of each can), 1 can seasoned beans for chili (not mashed at all), 1 can Hunts Dinner Starters for Chili, 1 green bell pepper chopped fine, 2 cups low sodium chicken broth instead of water. i did add the smallest splash of soy sauce, less than a teaspoon. (adds so much depth and complexity) tasted, then adjusted seasoning to taste (more chili powder, 1/4th teaspoon more salt, dash more red pepper, 2 teaspoon onion powder.) Simmered for a 30-40 min uncovered to thicken, and then 30-45 min more covered to let the flavors blend. TURNED OUT AMAZING! my fitness pal converting for 8 portions is 328 calories each. thanks again!!

Came out wonderfully.  I followed the recipe to the letter only to find out I only had a 14oz can of crushed tomatoes and no Cayenne pepper.  So I added a little water to make up for the lack of canned tomatoes and grabbed a few of my heirloom plum tomatoes from the garden, diced them and threw them in the pot.  Made some cornbread and YUM!  This one is a keeper!

After 30 minutes the chili was still rather soupy. I left it on for an additional 30 minutes and it was super thick. Just the way the family likes it. We are trying ground turkey for the first time, and this recipe is a must try.I did minus half the onion and added half a green pepper.

I love tis recipe. It's the one and only chili recipe I will ever use. But i do not like spicy food so I cut the chili powder down to 2 teaspoons only, I skip the black pepper entirely and I add just a couple shakes of chipotle pepper. I do make a couple modifications. I add trader joes fire roasted pepper and onion mix (frozen section) and a 4 oz can of mild fire roared diced chilis. Him!

Great basic chili recipe! First time trying turkey chili and I may never go back. Did have a few of my own changes...  86'd the water bc I like my chili more hearty (Although if you like it more soupy Id recommend using chicken broth instead of water). Seasoned the ground turkey w/ Italian seasoning and added onion and minced garlic to it when meat was about 3/4 cooked. I also added a small can of tomato sauce (8oz) and a large fresh tomato (diced) bc I wanted chunks of tomato. Changed the chili powder to 2teaspoons not tablespoons- I felt like two tablespoons would've overpowered the other spices. Simmered for 1 hr instead of 30 minutes, served with cornbread and we loved it!! Excited for leftovers.

I loved it! But you need to add more vegetables to make it more hearty/ meal like... we added green bell pepper, can of chilies, zucchini, and jalapeno pepper to kick up the spice and make it more lean

Healthy and tasty.  2 things I add to the original recipe:
1. the liquid from the beans.  Helps to thicken and add taste.
2. small/medium can of chopped or diced green chiles.

unfortunately, I also leave out the cayenne due to my wife's low heat tolerance--though I put it in if she's not having any :P

This is my go-to turkey chili recipe, and it is FANTASTIC. I do follow the advice of some other users, but even so, it's a great recipe from the start.

I followed the recipe almost to a T (I added 1.5 tbs of regular chili powder and .5 tbs of spicy chili powder) and it turned out wonderfully; however, the next time around I think I will cut back slightly on the oregano (it's just my own personal preference) and add some celery and carrots (again, my own preference).

This was delicious. It is a great basic recipe that anyone can jazz up. I added 3 chipotle peppers with 1 T sauce from the can, 1 1/2 C chicken broth instead of water, 1 can of corn, 1 green pepper, 2 jalapenos, 1 handful of crimini mushrooms (husband's request), 2 T brown sugar, omitted cayenne pepper and oregano, and adjusted cumin, chili powder, and paprika to taste. I also seasoned the ground turkey with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. I simmered the whole pot for 1 hour. Will definitely make this again! Easy, hearty, and tons of flavor and textures!

Just made this and it was GREAT! I mean my very picky 5 and 4 year olds ate it up. My 2 year is going through this phase of not wanting to eat, just have milk, well she actually ate this chili and a good amount of it!  Followed the recipe I just added extra beans because I double the batch. Great great recipe! It's a new fav. In our household! Thank you for sharing:)

Really good and simple recipe! I added diced bacon in with the turkey and onions and it came out very good! I also added garbanzo beans.

A good basic recipe that you can add to!

Really great turkey chili recipe, with tons of flavor.  I added my own modifications and it turned out great!
Used lean lean turkey meat, I added 1 can of mild chili beans and 1 can kidney beans and only 1 cup of water because I love thick hearty chili!! If you want toppings I think avocado and cheese are classics that can't be beat. Also, if you're thinking of a light side dish  I went with a coleslaw with homemade red wine vinaigrette ( Rachel Ray).

Everyone raved about this recipe! I followed it almost exactly, but added some canned corn and took down the spices a notch. I was serving it to spice-sensitive guests, so when I make it for just my family I'll heat it back up! I served mine over brown rice with shredded Cheddar. Making it again tonight with left over turkey breast, and I think it'll be even better!

We made this recipe like it was states excect that we left out some of the spicy-ness.  We served it over rice with cheddar cheese.  Easy to add hot sauce if you like it spicier.  Nice easy recipe my 10 year old was able to make and it tasted wonderful!

As a new mechanical heart valve recipient, I had to come up with new ways of eating.  Since chili is one of my favorites, and I am not suppose to eat red meat anymore (whimper), I was reluctant to try this but was brave enough to do it.  It actually was pretty good.  I did reduce the salt tho, as I am not suppose to have much of it.  I definitely will make this again.

Absolutely loved this recipe. I did make a few minor adjustments. First I doubled the crushed garlic. And I usually use crushed tomatoes, but I happened to grab the wrong can at the grocery store and bought tomato sause by mistake. But I feel that the sause worked better because it is not as watery as crushed tomatoes. Also, I omitted the water completely and it was the perfect consistency. Not too thick but not too thin. If I had added any of the water it would have turned it into soup. I may use crushed tomatoes in the future, but I recommend draining the meat after browning it, and definitely leave the water out no matter what. I did also add more salt and cayenne to taste. And I also was missing the chili powder when I made this, so I substituted with McCormick taco seasoning which has chili powder in it. I was nervous about it giving too much of a "taco" taste, so I used only 1 tablespoon, but it turned out wonderful. We topped with shredded cheddar and a spoonful of sour cream and chopped scallions. Served it with crackers and cornbread. DELICIOUS!!! Highly recommend. But again, don't add water!

We took this recipe and put it in the slow cooker... it made our home smell delicious all day. The recipe needed a bit more substance though, I would have preferred (and will use next time!) more beans for a heartier dish overall. The spices were spot on, my husband and I enjoyed it!

Fabulous, my friend, fabulous.  This is an excellent turkey chili, the spices are definitely on the mark.  I doubled everything because of guests and lots of children, lol.  I am eating it as I type and I must say it's hard to put down the bowl.

This is the second time I've made this and it is delicious! I only mash half of the beans and make it in a Dutch oven stovetop. Perfect. Excellent flavor with just the right amount of heat. This will probably be the only chili I will make from now on. Thank you for an easy recipe!

This recipes was very easy and made enough for my family of five with lots of leftovers too!  The only change I made was added some flour to thicken it up a bit.  Otherwise, it was awesome!

The easiest chili recipe I've ever tried. I followed the instructions exact to the video, except I added 1/4 cup of ground beef to stretch the meat blend. It was delicious, can't wait to make this for the next family get together. Loved it!

This chili was so easy to make, and the amount of spices was perfect.  My husband usually add hot sauce to any chili I make because I don't like it too spicy; however, he didn't add any.  It was the right kind of spicy for the both of us. I will definitely be making this again.

Everyone loves this chili!!! I took other reviewers advice and instead of water, I add another can of chili beans. I mash the beans well. My daughter asks for this dish weekly and she never liked chili before! It's the perfect winter dish.

Great Recipe!  My family loved it.  Easy and affordable for a large family.  I would recommend a little less cayenne pepper if your sensitive to spicy dishes.

I've made this 4 times since discovering the recipe. I use pinto beans instead of kidney beans. The turkey is a little chunky so I purée with the hand blender. This recipe freezes well.

I thought this was delicious!  I didn't add as much water because I like it thicker.  Gave it to my dad who loves chili and he didn't even know it was ground turkey until I told him after he practically licked the bowl clean!  :)  LOVE LOVE LOVE!

I doubled this, added two cans of chili beans, reduced the cayenne by half, ended up adding salt (to taste), used half the amount of water since we like our chili thicker, and I didn't use all of the tomatoes as it would've been too liquidy for us.

This is a good base. I added diced red pepper and diced jalapeno. Instead of water I used up some chicken broth I had left over. Instead of mashing beans I used a few spoon fulls of re-fried beans and pumpkin puree. Even though I did use fat free cheddar and fat free sour cream, I made cornbread to go with it and used real butter. So I hope it was a little balanced. LOL I'm sure this is a lovely dish without any changes. Simple. But I used up some odds and ends I had in the freezer,fridge and pantry. That's why I liked it.

Very good. I left out the cayenne pepper just because I didn't want to too spicy for my kids. Also left out the beans because my husband is not a fan. Only added one cup of water. Didn't taste like turkey at all which is a good thing!

I followed this recipe almost exactly swapping only the cayenne for just a pinch of red pepper flakes. After 30 minutes of simmering it was way too watery and kind of bland. I added a tiny can of tomato paste to thicken. I was skeptical but decided to try the cinnamon and brown sugar suggested in other reviews. I only added about a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1 TBSP brown sugar. It really changed the flavor but in a good way. 4 stars because even without my last minute additions its a pretty good recipe considering the calorie count.

I'm torn on how to rate a recipe when you make changes to it. However in this case I wouldn't have made the best  pot of chili without this recipe so it needs 5 stars. I added more veggies, more beans, and didn't have paprika. The base is a really good chili recipe, but like some other people I found it was lacking a certain flavor (couldn't put my finger on it). I fixed that up with a tablespoon of brown sugar and maybe a 1/4 cup or so of masa. I found it really brought all the flavors together. I hate spicy foods and I didn't find this recipe spicy at all. I followed all the spices per recipe (minus paprika). Thank you so much for your recipe!

I tried this after reading all of the positive reviews, so perhaps my expectations were a bit too high from the start, but I wasn't exactly blown away by this recipe. Sure, it tasted fine and was quite enjoyable on a chilly January evening, but it reminded me more of a turkey soup than chili.

This was amazing. I made it mostly as listed, except I did not have an onion, used garlic powder because I was being lazy, and added a 4-ounce can of diced jalapenos to kick up the heat. I only used 1 cup of water because I wanted it to be thicker. The consistency was really thick the second day, so I would probably increase to 1 1/2 cups of water next time. This was just a great, simple recipe, very adapatable to add what you want/have. Served with sliced green onions, shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream on top. I will definitely make this again and again!

Delicious! I made slight adjustments though, which I would recommend for a more even balance of ingredients. I added an extra can of beans and didn't mash the second can. Also, I added an extra can of diced tomatoes. Then I only added 1 cup of water instead of 2. I cooked mine in the slow cooker for about 4 hours. It turned out perfect! Will make this again.

This is a good base to start wirh, but it tastes too much like an Italian meat sauce.  To get more of a chili flavor, I leave out the garlic and oregano, use diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes, and only 1 cup of water.I also add at least one extra can of  beans (unmashed) and some more chili powder.

This has become my go to dinner since it is quick and easy and great left overs! I add two cans of kidney beans instead of the one. Make sure you rinse them well because it does make a difference. I mash them just a little bit because I prefer them whole. It is easier for me to buy cans of the diced tomatoes and then crush them in the blender. The spices are perfect the way they are.  -Nel

Nothing exciting.  More tomato based than anything.  Turkey gives it texture and no flavor.

I made this recipe exactly per the instructions. It was pretty good. If I make it again I'll probably make a few changes. I think adding a packet of taco seasoning might add to the spiciness, which we like. And I think I'll add a can of corn for texture and color. Overall, this was well received by my household, served with cornbread on a cool, fall evening.

I enjoyed it a lot, but made some adjustments. Cut water in half, added two cans tomato paste, and used ground chicken. Excellent, but too spicy. I would cut cayenne amount next time.

This recipe was great and easy to make! I'm a guy who doesn't really cook and wanted to learn to make some basic chili. This chili was hearty and flavorful. Best of all, it is just as good as leftovers over the next few days! I added a cup of chopped carrots and red peppers to get some more veggies into the meal. I may try the recipe with less water next time since it was a bit more watery than I was used to, but the water definitely did not take away from the flavor. This would go great with some rice.

Whole family loved it! Even my very picky 6 year old ate the whole thing up. I didn't add any chili powder as I didn't want to make it too spicy because of the kids, but still thought it was great!

I think this is a good starting recipe but could be improved upon with more beans and a little water. 
It would be perfect for someone who didn't want a lot of spice or depth of flavors but if you want heat, you'll have to add additional spices.

I added some of my own touches.  First no oregano.  That is for Italian & Greek food not chili.  First I sauteed red pepper & onion.  I omitted the water completely.  Chili should not be soupy.  I added extra chili powder & cumin, and I do not mash the beans.  Add some chopped cilantro right before serving.

I gave this a four only because it needed some tweaks. I halved the water, but it was still too much. I added some cornstarch and it was fine. I also used two cans of beans, one kidney and one pinto. I also added more cajun spice, and next time, I will use 2 pounds of turkey. I've never made or ate chili before this and it was a huge hit with the chili lovers in my house..and none had ever had turkey chili!

This was fantastic. I made it according to the recipe, except for a few minor changes based on what I had in stock. I used fresh instead of canned tomatoes and also added 3 Tablespoons of tomato paste for extra flavor. I also added about 1/4 cup of salsa verde because I needed to use it up. I did not have any chili powder, so I used taco seasoning instead. I used two cans of beans-one mashed and one kept whole, but drained and rinsed. I wanted to add more veggies, so I chopped some carrot, celery and bell pepper. In spite of the modifications, this recipe is a five star as written. However, it is also very easily adaptable to whatever ingredients you have. My husband and I each ate a huge bowl topped with cheese, lowfat sour cream, and cilantro. You won't be disappointed.

Yummy! I cooked in the slow cooked on low for 8 hours. Only thing is I took the advice of another reviewer and used extra water (2.5 cupes) for the slow cooker. MISTAKE! I will probably only use 1.5 cups next time for a thicker chili.

Ok, I have never made good chili before, I had bought some ground turkey on sale, and hubby said, "just don't make burgers out of it!"  I used this recipe plus added a jar of PACE Salsa, it was yummmmmmmmm!!!  I must confess I didn't measure, but used my preference of amounts of the spices listed.  Not as much Oregano but probably close to what the other measurements were for the rest of the spices. Cooked it on the stove top for about 2 hours.  It's ready to go, but it's only 1:30, thought I would have to cook it all day!

Love this recipe, I put it over brown rice, and my entire family loves it. I do cut back on the spice, due to having a little one. I make this once a week, and it lasts. I used to freeze it, but it never lasts long enough in my house to even get it in the freezer. Nice, simple, and easy :)

I follow this recipe, except I don't mash the beans, and it is delicious. I've also tried it with beef and it's slammin'. My 2 year old enthusiastically eats it. We like to put cheddar cheese and sour cream on top. We also dip tortilla chips in it & eat it that way. This is a regular recipe in our rotation. :) Yummy & simple!

It was a good recipe.  I did NOT smash my beans as we like them whole and I added chopped diced tomatoes instead of crushed. I also omitted the water as we like our chili thicker and not soupy.  The spice level is a little high.  I will tone it down next time as not everyone I cook for appreciates that amount of heat.  A good base recipe.

Pretty good taste-wise, but even better on the healthier side. To spice it up,  I add some hot peppers (1 whole jalapeño, 1/2 Scotch Bonnet) bit more chilli powder and at the end of cooking time throw in a heaping portion of finely chopped Kale (2-4 cups). Yum, plus the green bits look good too.

Very Good ! Its awesome and easy to make ! Its a perfect base with flavor, then you can add slight touches to make it your own like different beans, little bit of this and that but it really does not need any changes at all. My change was to add a can of tomato paste for added thickness WOW was it good !

Left out the beans, paprika, and salt. Instead of 2 cups of water I used 1/2 cup of turkey stock. Added one package of frozen kale, 2 teaspoons of minced garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I sauteed the onions, garlic and kale in olive oil. In a separate pan I browned the turkey. When the turkey was ready I combined the turkey with the kale and added the spices. I used this as a filling for flour tortillas.

This was a delicious simple recipe. I used less water since I like my chili a bit thicker. Also added a 1/3 cup of beer (I used a pale ale, but a lager works just as well.) Cheers.

Nice flavor.  Not very spicy, despite all the spices added.
I was worried about the 2 cups of water, but it needed it.

This was VERY good...quick and easy! I used Chicken broth as someone suggested which gave it a delicious flavor. I also used Cannellini Beans and I did NOT mash them! I topped it off with Monteray Jack cheese...I will definitely make this again...it's a keeper!!

We had this meal for dinner tonight and it was a bit plain. Needs a few things, imo. First off, it was way too watery. Need to replace at least one of the cups of water with tomato paste. Chili needs to be meaty, not a soup. 
Next, I plan on adding in some sweet peppers, a bit more garlic, a bit of hot sauce and, maybe a bit of pork and diced carrots. 
Not a recipe to dismiss, but one to enhance.

Another wonderful recipe. I picked up the ground turkey, on sale for $1.27 a pound. Grabbed 5 pounds! Looked up this recipe. Made one batch in the morning. Tried it, loved it! Made the 2nd batch this afternoon. Simple, basic and the right spices.

This chili was great! I didn't mash the kidney beans because I didn't think I needed to and it turned out just like regular chili. Little spicy for me, but still fantastic. :)

My son loves this.  I use black beans, and a little less garlic, and add about a cup of pureed vegies for added nutrients (cauliflour and carrots) and to thicken it up a little.  We like it thicker so I also don't add as much water.  Throw it all in the crock pot and let it stew - easy, yummy winter meal.

Very easy.  A nice spicy, but could have used a more complex flavor.

Great recipe and would make it again. However, recipe said it made 8 servings so doubled recipe to serve 8 adults. 8 adults barely got 1 cup of chili with no room for seconds for everyone. Good thing we had two batches of cornbread and toppings! Was disappointed that 1/2 cup was considered a serving size for a chili recipe.

Delicious chili!
I made a few changes; substituted paprika with turmeric, switched out 2 cups of water with 1 cup of chicken broth, added 1-1/2 lbs of chopped turkey breast, and put a bit more cayenne in since I love a little heat.

It didn't taste right after I added the seasonings, mostly like it was only chili powder. So I added a can of tomato paste to tone down the seasoning flavor and it was great! There were no left overs. Also, I only had black beans on hand and only mashed up about half of them since we like the full texture of the beans.

This is an excellent turkey chili recipe! I had an old standby turkey chili recipe that I've used for years, but in a quest to make turkey chili more palatable for my red meat eating friends, I decided to mix it up and try this one out. It was a big hit! The only thing I changed was using black beans instead of kidney, as that's all I had on-hand. I let it simmer until it got nice and thick. It made for excellent frito pies! I'll be making it again soon for our superbowl party.

I thought this was great!  I am only giving it five stars because I felt it was a bit too much water.  My chili never really thickened as much as I'd like it to.  It was a bit too watery, but overall the flavor was great.  I used black beans and omitted a couple spices, simply because I didn't have them.  I would definitely make this again.  It was quick and hit the spot!  Even my 6 year old liked it and he doesn't often try new things.

This recipe has potential, but as shown, was entirely too spicy for us. I only used 1 tablespoon of chili powder because that was all I had left in the jar, and followed the recipe exactly otherwise (with the exception of only 1 cup of water) I will try this recipe again, but with a few changes. I really liked the use of ground meat,and may even try it with ground beef as well. I've been looking for a homemade replacement for Hormel's chili and this is the closest I've come, so I will keep working on it!

Delicious! I just added more spice, sauteed the onion and garlic (and green bell pepper) Also, I used dry beans instead of canned. I think it will taste even better tomorrow.

I love making this recipe!  It's quick and easy to prepare ... but I have to confess that I bump up the veggies a little.  I chop two or three carrots and a few sticks of celery when I am making this, then go in the following order:  1)  get onion about half clear, then 2) add chopped carrots and celery and soften (this also releases the sugar from the carrots and gives some more depth of flavor to the dish).  THEN 3)  brown the turkey in with the vegetables ... then follow along with the recipe and you are good to go.  This is always a hit, it's an easy thing to throw together, and it's perfect for fall and the cold weather.  We will continue to make this in my house, and my oldest daughter wants the recipe to make in her new apartment at college next  year!

Yummy!  I usually make a vegetarian chili, but this was very delicious.  I added a bit of cinnamon as suggested by another reviewer and wouldn't mash all the beans. Add any veggies you like, carrots, peppers mushrooms...Enjoy!

Awesome turkey chili recipe...super flavorful, delicious, and fast! I bought a 3# pkg of ground turkey (!) as it was on sale.  I pretty much just doubled the recipe except for the crushed tomatoes.  I took other people's advice and softened the onion and garlic. Then cooked turkey.  I also minced 1 jalapeno pepper for little heat.  My 11 year-old is a picky eater and she ate two bowl-fuls. My family loved it!

This was my first time making chili using turkey and I've got to say it was actually pretty good WITH some tweaking. I doubled ALL of the seasoning and added a bay leaf. I also added a green bell pepper and 1/2 cup of mushrooms.

Fabulous! As suggested by other reviewers, I used less cayenne (1/8 tsp). You only need to adjust it to your preference for heat! This is the best chili I've had! The whole family loved it! I can see how it would be easy to add veggies or sausage or whatever you like to change it up but it is wonderful as is! I cannot reccommend it enough!

I am used to having a bit more flavour to my chili. I found it a bit mild.  Will try to add a bit more spice to get it going.  However, it was still very delicious, and easy to prepare.

I've tried a number of turkey chili recipies...I didn't find anything special about this recipe and neither did my family. I did saute the onion and garlic as suggested, and I still felt like this was just a basic chili recipe.

I make this about 2-3 times per month..and every time I am amazed at how good this is. The only tweak I do is adding only one cup of water and throwing in some frozen corn.  You can't even tell this is turkey.  Can't wait till next fall when I get to use home grown crushed tomatoes...YUM

My family loves the leftover dinners I make with the turkey and ham from the holidays. I used leftover turkey (mostly the white meat) instead of ground turkey, and pinto beans instead of kidney beans.  I also added some canned corn. The seasonings were great, adding just enough zing to be a spicy but not so hot as to make it inedible. It was a bit soupy at first, but thickened up as I put it in the crockpot on low after throwing it together. Thanks for a great meal!

I have made this 2 times and we loved it both times.  The only changes I made were to add a can of black beans. I also did not mash the beans.  The first time I tried this I used the crockpot and it was excellent. The second time I prepared as directed and it was just as good! Thanks for the easy, yummy recipe.

Good flavor. Omitted cayenne pepper. Too watery, will try with 1 to 1 1/2 cups water next time. Added 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed in a bit of cold water to help thicken. Would be nice with mushrooms. Topped with sour cream and shredded cheddar.

This recipe is fantastic. It has become a family favorite. Being a mom of three, I am always on the go and being able to whip up a hearty, flavorful meal that ALL enjoy in one hour is key! I dial down the chili and cayenne powder by about half so the kids are able to tolerate it.

The BEST chili recipe (although I definitely put a lot more of the spices it calls for.)  I make 2 batches and have on-hand in the fridge the whole week for me and my husband.  Simple and healthy!

I made this with half regular chili powder and half Ancho chili powder (I found this at Kroger, their brand too). I did not mash my beans, and used kidney, pinto and black beans (one can each drained). I also used two onions. I think that I would add one green bell pepper, chopped along with the onions and a can of diced green chilies to the next batch. Good stuff and it would be just as good meatless.

This is so good!  I used leftover turkey from a "trial run" early bird!  Just chopped it up and added in place of ground turkey.  Chili seasoning mix is excellent for all-round use!  Now I can look forward to Thanksgiving turkey leftovers!

If you like your chili thicker add only one cup of water and don't forget to rinse and drain your beans.

This was SO good! It definitely packs a punch, so if you like your chili with some spice, character, and a serious deliciousness factor this is the perfect recipe!

If you're not a huge fan of spice, making small adjustments in the quantities of all the delicious spices in this recipe would probably be a good solution. If all else fails, there is always sour cream and cheese to use as toppers and take some of that heat down.

All in all, most definitely a keeper!

I found this recipe to be very bland.  It needed more chili powder, salt, and whatever you could add to punch it up...and I don't even like very hot spices but this really needed some work.

I made this on september 5th.  It was delicious, except there was a little too much water and I would have preferred it thicker.  I went into labor right after that and had a baby four hours later, eight weeks premature!  Funnily enough, my midwife asked me what I had eaten for dinner.  So I don't think I'll eat it while pregnant again, but I'm making it tonight since the baby and I are safe at home now :0)

It was a great recipe. Definitely needed more. I added some Worcestershire sauce, crushed red pepper, and some Lawry's seasoning. I'm making it again tonight but with some mild chili beans this time. Its a great recipe to play with

Easy and flavorful, my first time making or eating turkey chili. Since turkey falls a little flat on flavor compared to beef I added 2 beef bullion cubes and used chicken broth instead of water. Since I was making this for a crowd I added an extra can of beans and a cup of frozen corn to help it stretch a little further. This one is a keeper for a fast soup on a chilly night.

We loved it after making a few adjustments to use what I had on hand. First adjustment was to use the recipe ajdustment to make 16 servings since I had 2 pounds of ground turkey to use up. I browned onions, peppers (use red, green, & banana which I had on hand), and garlic in the oil. Then I browned the ground turkey. I did not added the water. I only had 32 ounce cans of crushed tomatoes, so I did not feel I needed extra water.  I used extra cumin and added brown sugar. I did let is simmer longer as we were not ready to eat after 30 mins. 

I served in bowls top with shredded Mexican Blend Cheese (what I had on hand) and cornbread on the side.

Love it!  I make this almost weekly with fresh diced tomatoes and add black beans and reduce the amount of water. Eat it with corn bread, biscuits, tortilla chips, and add lots of shredded cheddar.  It's the ultimate comfort food!

Truly wonderful basic chili. Excellent for families with small children because it's not spicy, but still nutritious and flavorful. I use one can each of black beans and kidney beans (don't bother mashing anything), use chicken stock instead of the water, and skip the cayenne. I'll also sometimes puree a cooked sweet potato and throw it in, too. 

I serve it with either Homesteader's cornbread (from this site) or Ninety Minute Cinnamon Rolls (also from this site). Is it a regional thing to have chili with cinnamon rolls? If so, and you're not from the midwest, try it! :)

I did everything the recipe asked for, it was very bland, didnt taste like chili at all. I improvised of course, and added an extra can of beans with chili and added a small can of tomato sauce, also added more salt, pepper, cumin and chili powder.

We did not have cayenne so instead added hot sauce (similar to Franks Hot Sauce); 2 tsp.  We also added a can of rinsed black beans.  There is no way this chili would have been ready in 30 minutes - too runny for our taste.   We simmered the chili for about three hours on low (3) and it was perfect.  Add some sour cream, cheese, and frito chips.  Enjoy a beer with it!  My husband LOVED it!!!  I know this will be better tomorrow...

I LOVE this recipe. It is a bit spicy though as is. The only thing I change is use only about 1 1/2 C water instead of the recommended 2. Very good on a cold day!

Loved this simple recipe! I did change a few things and it was simply DELICIOUS! I cooked the turkey along with the onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms in a seperate pan before putting in the pot. I didn't have chili powder SO I added a little extra cayenne pepper along with crushed red pepper (YUM!). The only thing I would absolutely change next time is to season the meat beforehand.

Amazing! The first time I made it, we had 6 people coming over, including a couple on a diet, two foodies, and a couple big eaters, so I doubled the recipe to ensure we didn't run out. We didn't, but not for lack of eating! Everyone gave it rave reviews, even my foodie friends. It's not too spicy (which my husband is thankful for) and is bursting with flavor. The beans keep it both filling and healthy. I paired it with cornbread and put sour cream and cheese on the side and everyone declared it a total success. I've made it since then and it's always fantastic.

The recipe is excellent and worthy of five stars as it is but I'm genetically incapable of not messing with chili recipes so I do add my own touches when I make it. I generally toss in some bell peppers and any other peppers I might have at the time, vary the beans (pinto and black are great), and always throw in some cocoa powder (I like Cincinnati style chili.) I don't know that I improve it, but it's always fantastic!

I took the advice of other reviewers and added only 1 cup of water. I'm glad I did because we don't like our chili to be too soupy. I also added one can of northern beans. I mashed half the can of northern and half the can of kidney beans. It came out great!

This was very good.  I used 3lbs of ground turkey and doubled the other ingredients.  I browned the turkey and put all the ingredients in the slow cooker for like 5 hours on high. It was pretty spicy so I added brown sugar to tame it down a little.  My son LOVED the sweet twist it had =)  I will be making it again.

Without much added seasoning, this chili would have been bland.  I upped the amount of cumin, salt, pepper and oregano.  I also added another can of kidney beans.  If you like your chili spicy, try another recipe or prepare to add AT LEAST 1 T. of cumin and whatever you like to make it warm- cayenne or liquid hot sauce.

This was delicious, healthy and super easy!  I made it for a girls' dinner party, it was such a hit AND I made it while the girls were over already and I barely had to pay attention to it.  I didn't mash up the beans, added cinnamon and garlic salt and only added 1/4 cup of water and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

Best turkey chili I've made. I added a couple of roasted, peeled, chopped poblano chilies. I also threw in the garlic and spices for the end of the sauté.

Very good.  I had to cook it for a lot longer than recommended to bring it to a thicker consistency so keep that in mind if you like your chili thick and less soup like.  Everyone enjoyed this on chili dogs.

I love the idea of mashing up the beans.  My husband is not a big fan of beans but I try to put them in to get the extra protein and fiber.  In this chile you didn't know they were there and it was very tasty.  Mine came out a little bland so I added a little garlic salt, a little brown sugar and a little cocoa powder which is in another chile recipe I like.  My husband really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing.

Really yummy, my whole family enjoyed it! I made a few changes to bulk it out a bit. Added 3 large carrots, chopped, 1 can of black beans (I only mashed half of these and the kidney beans), and a red bell and green bell, both chopped. I added the bells and 1/2 the onion near the end so that they didn't cook too far down. Really yummy, we'll make this again for sure!

This is a wonderful start to chili and does do well just as listed. I however, like my chili with more beans so i usually add a can of black beans, white kidney beans for color and chili beans in hot chili sauce. I also add a can of diced tomatos and about half a cup original V8, it really gives it a nice flavor. So yummy!!!

Fantastic. I doubled the beans and mashed half of them, and used 1.5 cups of chicken broth rather than water. Delicious.

Not bad for turkey chili!

Made it several times.  The first time, I made it
exactly as written.  Found it a little soupy and
bland, but thought I may be able to modify it to 
suit my personal taste preferences.

Second time, left out paprika, used a little less liquid, and added jalapenos.  Closer, but still not there...

Subsequent times, tried adding corn and also varying beans.

Finally decided that I prefer ground beef chili over turkey chili.  Besides the ground beef flavor, I also like the aroma in my kitchen cooking with ground beef instead of turkey.

Still though, this recipe has a number of pluses.  Leftovers taste as good or better than when first cooked.  Recipe is also healthy and freezes well.

This was pretty good. I didn't have beans or onions so i used minced onions and a can of barbeque grillin beans. And it was delicious! The barbeque gave it a different taste. I had used babeque sauce in another recipe that I got from a cooking network. And it worked wonderfully! Added cheese and sour creaam on top. Will use this again.

I used 2 cans of kidney beans instead of just one.  I mashed the 1st can and put the 2nd can in whole.  This was very good.  I served this over waikiki cornbread and topped with shredded cheddar and a few splashes of Franks.  The best turkey chili recipe I have tried so far.

Oh my god, this was perfect. I made some changes but everything turned out so well. I ended up using beef because the store didn't have ground turkey, and instead of water I used one cup of tomato juice. I added chunks of tomato also because chili just isn't the same without and and added a couple spoons of sugar- besides that everything was the same. In the future though I'll probably add more beans because it felt like there wasn't enough. When it was done we grated some cheese on top and ate it. The recipe turned out great and my guy loved it.

Excellent chili recipe.  For those of us who don't like things too hot, 1/4 tsp. instead of 1/2 tsp of the peppers worked just fine.  One can always add more if one is so inclined.  You can also add pretty much anything you have on hand.  I added 2 finely chopped ribs of celery and some finely mushrooms I had to use up.  Some canned Corn would have been good too. I also omitted the water but added 1 cup of broth to the kidney bean and used my hand blender to mash then up before adding to the pot.  My guys didn't even know they were eating healthy.  It's my little secret plus it helps thicken up the Chili. So yummy with Corn Bread on the side. Thanks for a quick and good tasting dinner.

Excellent combination of spices....not too hot, just right.  I left the kidney beans whole to save time & used beef instead of turkey.  We also added elbow macoroni & cheddar cheese.  You won't be dissapointed.

AMAZING!  Of course, like many of these reviews, I too made some slight modifications...I used 2 (16 oz) cans of kidney beans (rinsed & mashed) instead of the suggested one....I also used 1 finely chopped Red bell pepper, 1 finely chopped pablano pepper and a couple more freshly minced garlic cloves...I added all veggies (starting with the onion and pepper 1st, garlic in last) while the turkey was browning (to enhance the blending of flavors).  When onions were translucent & peppers had softened some I then added the crushed tomatoes...I only added in a 1 1/2 cups of water (making this recipe on the thicker side).  It came out FANTASTIC!  I highly recommend this recipe!  Good luck!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe, and it's so much healthier than a lot of other chili recipes I've seen. It's especially delicious when you sprinkle cheese on top, and you can't even tell that it's turkey instead of beef (unless of course you're the one who made it!). I always make this recipe exactly as is, although recently I've had to cut the cumin because I'm pregnant.

I LOVE turkey chili, and this recipe is definitely simple! Turkey is such a great alternative to beef in recipes. This recipe is good, but I add no salt, I don't mash the beans, and I usually sprinkle a little more chili powder on my serving (personal preference -- I like chili flavor)

My family LOVES this recipe! I use only extra lean ground turkey because it seems to have the best flavor for the recipe. I've tried it with the preseasoned and higher fat content turkey- those just aren't as good. Otherwise I use onion powder instead of actual onion then do the rest as written. We top with sharp cheddar. YUM!

This chili was simple and tasted great!! you couldn't even tell that it was ground turkey. Also my family is not a fan of spicy (which i thought this would be) and it really wasn't it had a tang to it but didn't leave your tongue on fire. I also switched out the beans with pinto beans (mother doesn't like kidney). 2 thumbs up!

Excellent!  No need to ever use beef again for chili, since turkey is healthier.  I couldn't tell the difference - it just tasted like a hearty, delicious chili!

This is a good weeknight dish. I added a chopped green pepper with the onion and substituted beef broth for the water. I also threw the minced garlic in after the onion and pepper had cooked for just 30 seconds before adding the remaining ingredients. (I have found with all recipes this is the best way to get full flavor from your fresh garlic without burning it.) To serve, I topped with shredded Mexican cheese and some chopped cilantro. Very good and my family enjoyed it!

a good simple recipe. punch it up with as much seasoning as you think you'd like. definitely go easy on the 2d cup of water - its definitely watery with that second cup. I froze 2-3 servings of leftovers in little Ziploc bags and have been enjoying this over the last few weeks.

Good, simply recipe. Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used canned tomatoes with diced green chile, added 1 can of chili beans and a can or corn. Substituted chopped celery for the onion (upsets my husband's stomach). We really enjoyed it and will definitely use this one again.

This was delicious! Cut the water in half, added some frozen corn, green chilis, green peppers and canned mushrooms. Used black beans and kidney beans (one can of each) and did not mash any. It was better after it sat over night in the fridge!

This recipe was easy and amazing!!  My boyfriend usually doesn't like chili and he loved it!  Very healthy and full of flavor too.  I always have all of the ingredients on hand so this will be my new chili recipe.  I did make some changes, added only 1 cup of water, more crushed red pepper and corn starch at the end to make it thicker.  So good!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was good.  Next time I will use chicken broth instead of water and reduce to 1 cup, and put a few additional veggies and seasonings to add more depth.  I also served this with the Jiffy box corn bread and it was a dynamite combo!

This recipe is fantastic and so simple. However, I did make a few changes that I wanted to share. First, I love super spicy food so I added 1/4 tsp. of XXX hot sauce. Also, I added to tablespoons of ground flaxseeds to help thicken the chili. I usually serve this over brown rice. It's really yummy.

Rave reviews from the family.  Like many others I "made it my own" by adding some chili beans, diced green pepper, tomato sauce and a couple of pinches of cinnamon.

Quick and easy, just the way I like it!  I added a can of spicy chili beans and used ~3tbsp of Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning (from this site) along with some cayenne pepper.  Next time I will use less water (it was a little soupy for my tastes).

This chili was ok. I ended up adding quite a bit more seasoning, due to it being bland. I cooked my turkey in a bit of water(keeps the meat from clumping and seperates any fats there may be), rather than in oil. I added black beans and pinto beans to the mix. I do think chili beans would've added needed flavor. I lowered the amount of water, as we like our chili thicker. We served over frito's, and topped with cheese.

This is how I've made chili for years. I always like to try new recipes but keep going back to this one.  Over time, I found I liked other beans better than kidney and I've added a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa as well which gives it a lovely flavour and colour. I tend to use hamburger but it's a very versatile recipe. Ancho Chili powder is great in this. So is Chipolte chili powder - but it's much more hot than normal chili powder so you need to be careful. This is also even better the next day.

I don't get how this chili could look like the photo if you follow the directions exactly.  I did and the beans were mashed and the chili was watery.  I'll look for a better recipe.

Super easy and quick to make. Great flavor too. I highly recommend it. You won't even notice its turkey instead of ground beef.

Terrific recipe!  Our friends couldn't tell it was turkey chili:)  Instead of 2 cups water I did beer.  Otherwise, spices are perfect!  Will do again for sure.

This chili was very good.  I followed everything except the amount of the chili powder.  I only added 1 tablespoon of the chili powder and it still had a kick to it!  It was very tasty though.  I would make this again in a heartbeat!!  Very quick and easy.

This is a good one! It tastes almost as good as Mom's. I took the suggestion of one reviewed and added the chili beans, good call. Next time I would add some diced potatoes.

Since I used canned beans and didn't drain them, I didn't add as much water. I also added some chopped green peppers.  I don't measure out the spices, but instead add until I like the flavor and it's hot enough for us. Everyone loved this chili.

I just made this tonight and it's excellent! I added the onion and some garlic while I was cooking the turkey, then threw in some carrots and celery. I decreased the cayenne pepper just a bit but added a little more chili powder. I simmered it with the lid off (oops didn't read it right) and let it simmer an extra 10 minutes so it was a little thicker. Turned out great, I'll definitely make it again!

This is one of my favorite winter comfort food recipes.  I have modified it to use chunks of turkey breast, rather than ground; I saute the onions, remove them and then brown the turkey.  I use only about 1/2 cup of water and add 1/4 cup of red wine and I cut the chili powder and tomatoes in half.  I also cook it for about 2 hours, to really blend the flavors.

Didn't love this. This chili has so much liquid that it turned out more like a soup. I cooked it for 8 hours in the slow cooker so I thought some of the liquid would've evaporated.  There's also way too much tomato in this for me and it turned out rather bland.

This was really good.  I added green pepper with the onion.  Also added corn at the end.  Left out the beans because no one likes them.  Added 1 cup of cooked elbow macaroni instead.  The spices needed some serious adjusting for our tastes. Read the reviews about being too watery.  Just let the chili simmer awhile uncovered until it is to your preferred thickness.  Definitely a keeper!  Served with Grandmother's Buttermilk Corn Bread.

I have never made chili before and I have to admit this was GREAT and super easy. I took advise from other posters and added a can of chili beans. I also added a can of crushed ortega chili's along with half a green pepper. My husband and kids loved it. I added some low fat cheese on it which made it even better. I will use this receipt over and over.

This was so good!  I made it for my boyfriend and me last night, and it was incredibly easy and tasty.  I just used a packet ot taco mix instead of trying to find the right spices individually, and it was to die for.  I also used the kidney beans whole, but i mashed up some butter beans to add thickness.  I also added corn, and it was awsome.  Great recipe!

This was wonderful on a day like today just got 2 feet of snow.  The store didnt have grounded beef so i was forced to by turkey for chili.  I might never use ground beef again for chilli. I sauteed my oinon with garlic 3 cloves. Then added it to turkey. When browning trukey i used steak seasoning like others mentioned. Used only one cup of water.  I added a can of diced tomatos. mashed kidney beans lightly.  1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  No cumin in house so did use. I used ground oregano cause i didnt have dried.  I also sprinkled a little garlic powderin.   Amazing and easy.  thanks a bunch.

Thanks for a great recipe!  I made a few changes after reading other reviews and based on my personal taste, but this is an EXCELLENT base and I'm sure would be delicious as is.  I doubled the cumin and added garlic powder in addition to the garlic.  Also sauteed a green bell pepper with the onion, which made for a lovely color in the final product.  I sliced a fresh jalepeno and threw that in for more heat, I like it HOT.  Used canned diced tomatoes for chunkiness, and thickened with a bit of flower because the tomato juice in the can added water.  I topped it wish fresh cilantro and scallions.  I'm eating the leftovers now, and it's delicious!  My only warning is it's so good it might only feed four.

This chili is AMAZING!! I use to always make my mom's chili recipe, but I decided to try a different one. I love this one, plus it's really healthy and low calorie.. (That's if you don't pile on the cheese and sour cream)

A delicious hearty chili for a chilly winter night!  Changes I made: used 1.5 lbs of ground turkey, chopped up a couple strips of bacon and trimmed off the excess fat, left out the chili powder (can't take spicy heat), put in 2 tbsp of sweet Hungarian paprika (you can never add too much paprika in a chili), substituted beef broth for water, and added 5 cloves of garlic + parsley.  This was amazing!  We gobbled it up, and it looks like what was estimated at 8 servings is turning into 4-5 servings.  Great recipe.

I used our leftover turkey in this recipe & it was delicious & simple.  Very mild though, so pump up the spice if you like it that way.  No cpmplaints about turkey leftovers in this house!

Was ok - never could get it to taste just right.  Followed the recipe as written and was bland.  Added chopped red and green peppers, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Probably won't try this again.  Maybe I just don't like turkey chili...

Simple and easy!!  I use only 1 cup of water (not as soupy).  Used the ideas posted here for 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and cinni, for a unique taste. Serve with cornbread muffins, yummy!

This chili is easy and great.  Very flavorful.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 Tbsp of brown sugar.  I also browned the spices for a minute or two before adding the water to release the flavor.  I am surprised that the recipe doesn't call for that.  I used 1 cup of water and added the juice from the can of tomatoes.  This recipe is great!  (I served it with Texas Spoon Bread from this site).

Pretty good--I only changed a few things-I used pureed tomatoes since they were on sale, and from experience I can say that it made the chili nice and thick.  I also added a roasted bell peppers and that gave it a really good flavor.

OMG!  I made the Simple Turkey Chili and it was outstanding!  I was a little spicy but not too hot.  I added smoked turkey sausage in along with the ground turkey as well.  I took this chili to work and my coworkers loved it! It looks like I have earned some  cool points thanks to this meal.

this is a decent base recipe, but it really needs a lot of doctoring up.  i followed some advice below and also added a can of chili beans - i pureed about half of the chili beans and half of the kidney beans, and added the rest of the beans whole.  i also added more garlic and more of all the spices, but that's how i like my chili.  i also added some frank's red hot, brown sugar and cinnamon, which gave it a really warm, sweet taste (i know it sounds gross, but it's really not!  mix and match to your liking).  the only thing i would NOT do next time is add 2 cups of water, that seemed to be way too much.  even a cup seems like it would be almost too much....add gradually depending on how soupy you want the chili to be.  i made cornbread to go with it and it was a very nice meal on a cool fall day.

Simple & Satisfying!  I like my chili on thicker side so didn't add, or need, any water!  I think it would be more like a soup if I had.  For more flavour, I doubled the cumin and added a bit more chili powder.  Will make again!  YUM

This is a great base for good turkey chili, but I thought it was too bland.  Next time, I will follow the advice by others and add some peppers or jalapeno.  I didn't think it was too watery, though... I thought it was just right!  I will definitely use this recipe again, and hopefully it will get five stars next time!

Delicious. I was looking for a simple and quick chili and this is it. The only extra I added was a small can of green chilis.  I actually had the time to let it simmer for 2 hours which I am sure enhanced the flavors..topped with shredded mexican cheese and sour cream. A winner!

Luckily I read the reviews before I started and knew to cut down on the water and add more spice.  However, I only added one cup of water, instead of two, cooked it for over an hour and it's still too runny.  Next time I'll use 1/2 cup of chicken broth, another can of beans, and add in more spice and maybe a jalepeno.  It's on the bland side.  But, it's a good base for chili - just spice it up a bit and cut the water.

For a quick, simple turkey chili, this is it.  As a fan of turkey chili, however, this one didn't rate five stars with me.  I am praying the flavors with come together a little more in the next 4 hours.  I have it in the slow cooker (double batch) and guests arriving at 7 p.m.  I followed the recipe exactly (minus the cup of water) and just am not convinced it's the best.  I even put in a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Ooooh doggy it's got some heat!  Good thing I got the Texas Sheet Cake V for desert!!

This has become one of my fav meals of all time! It is a tad bland for me as is so I add the following: a can of corn, a can of Bush's chili beans, 2 chopped jalepenos, double the cayenne, double the cumin, add a pinch of cinnamon. I garnish with sour cream ans cheddar and serve with chips. It is SO good! Guests & husband agree.

Really good recipe! I started off making it following the recipe word for word, but It just tasted pretty bland. I'd say half the water, or use broth instead. I ended up throwing in two chicken bouillon cubes which really sweetened it up some. I used stewed tomatoes; I was out of garlic so I just used garlic powder, and I love my chili with a kick of spice so i doubled the cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper. Great overall! Definitely adding it to the recipe box.

Very good.  My husband is allergic to beans so I substituted macaroni.  Also I think I will reduce the amount of chili powder by 1/2 because it was a little too much heat for my 10 year old.  But really tasty.  Thank you

Terrific! I browned the turkey in a skillet with chopped carrots, onion, green & orange peppers. I only used 1 cup of water and added a can of tomato paste which made it a great consistency. Served over penne noodles with some shredded cheese on top. I didn't have any cumin. It made quite a lot.

Should have read all the reviews first.  This is WAY too watery.  Maybe 3/4 cup of water would have been enough. Its a little bland, too.

Another great chili recipe. I used morning star protein crumbles instead of turkey. Thank You!

Five stars from my famiily with these changes. Instead of adding the 2 cups of water (why dilute the flavour of a dish?) I added one can of beef broth. The thickness was perfect without any more liquid. I also reduced the amount of spice because my daughte doesn't like spicy food. Served with grated cheese, low fat sour cream, and baked tortilla chips. I also made a vegetarian version for myself, using mexican spiced veggie "ground round" and a veggie bouillon instead of the water. It was delicious too. Simmered both the meat and veggie versions for an hour. Thanks for the great recipe!

I gave this 4 stars because I ended up changing a little bit of the recipe.  Instead of water I did a can of crused tomatoes and a can of tomatoes with green chilis.  Also I did a can of kidney bean, a can of white beans, and a can of black beans.  I added corn in for more flavoring and to put some texture to it.  I also did the onions and garlic at the same time as the turkey.

This really was simple.  U substituted chicken for the turkey because that's what I needed to use up, and in addition to all the ingredients which I followed to the T, I added about 1/4 cup Ketchup, 1/4 cup chili sauce, and as another reviewer suggested, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  I also added about 1/4 teaspoon more salt than was originally called for.  I made half a recipe.  I'll be making this again and serving it with biscuits.

Good chili. Surprisingly flavorful for a turkey chili! I followed exactly but added chipolte chili powder, a tad of garlic powder and extra cumin, a can of kidney beans and cannelloni beans and smoked paprika. Came out really good & is very easy and healthy!

This recipe is great!  My husband dislikes anything with ground turkey in it and he ate it up!  Of course I failed to tell him that there was ground turkey in it until AFTER he gave his opinion!  He still said I could make this again, and I definitely will.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this recipe was a three star but hubby thought it was five so I compromised on four.  Could be a little thicker for my taste but the spices do compliment the ground turkey very nicely.  Thanks for sharing.

I normally make the Washabinaro Chili but I did not have the wasbai paste or the beer so I had to find a new chili recipe. Since I was starting a new healthy eating regimen and had turkey on hand, I chose this one.   I'm glad I did. It was easy to make and the flavor was great. I may have overdone it on the red cayenne, even though I thought I measured it evely. It was a little on the spicy side.   My chili-loving family approved of this recipe wholeheartedly.

This is an excellent recipe!  It is fast and easy to make.  I would give it 5 stars, but I did substitute black beans for the kidney beans.  Otherwise, this recipe has been added to my work-week line-up!

I made this last night for my bunco girls potluck, but mostly for me as I am on a protein/low carb diet. I was impressed with how much flavor this chili has, especially made with ground turkey! I have made other ground turkey chili recipes before that have been bland and not that spicy, but this one is a keeper! I will make this one again for sure, thanks!

I made this chili for my husband, an avid chili fan.  He was skeptical that a turkey chili could be any good - he was pleasantly surprised.  We'll be making this chili for a long time to come!

I've made this recipe many times and it is always SO DELICIOUS and VERY easy to make.  We love it so much.  I always leave out the cayenne pepper when I make it, and the chili still turns out great.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is a staple in our family.

This chili is phenomenal! The whole family loved it. I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 can of mashed kidney beans and 1 can of rinsed whole beans.  I also substituted green pepper tobasco for the cayenne since that's what I had on hand. Wonderful! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was my first attempt at chili, and it came out just beautifully! It was incredibly easy and SO tasty. I live in a dorm and many people came by trying to figure out what smelled so good! :) I added two chicken bouillon cubes to the water for some more flavor. I also added a can of corn and some extra-spicy chili powder. Jane's Krazy Mixed-up Salt is awesome with this recipe. I will be making this again soon!

This was really good, and so easy to change it to your prefrenences.  I loved the spice, and might add something else next time to give even more of a kick.  We ate it three nights in row for dinner, and wasn't sick of it on the third day.  Great recipe!

This is "OK". Definitely not the best I've ever had.... Made a batch for my bf and I yesterday. We needed a quick lunch before going to our friend's Super Bowl get-together. I also wanted to make something that would yield plenty of left-overs for this week's lunches. I guess turkey chili isn't my thing (or mashed kidney beans for that matter...). I prefer my chili with whole beans - and more of them. Kidney beans don't mash well (who knew?). I must say that this was easy to prepare though. I'm going to stick with Jake Jacobs slow burn chili (which is the best I've tried off this site so far). Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe.  It's simple and uses ingredients I usually have on hand.  The spices were perfect for our family--my husband and daughter add their own hot sauce to their bowl.  I used chicken broth instead of water and added a can of pintos in addition to the kidney beans and some cilantro just because we love cilantro!  Served it with grated cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips.  Perfect meal for a snowy day.

This was a very good and extremely easy receipe.  it was a bit spicy for me but my husband and daughter loved it and it was not so hot that I could not east it.  I only used a cup and a half of water and think one cup would have been enough.  I added a bit more garlic, usign three large cloves. Will definitely make it again.

This was pretty good!  Changes: I used beef broth instead of water.  I also added a can of black beans.  I didn't mash any beans and I liked the way it came out!!!  Next time I would rather use two cans of rotel instead of the crushed tomatoes.  Thanks for an easy, quick, weeknight meal!

This is a great, simple recipe!  I was looking for something quick that I could make with basic pantry ingredients and this hit the mark perfectly! The only change I made was to eliminate the salt.  I will never buy a premade spice packet again!

Excellent chili!  My whole family loved it even my 9 year old who is the pickiest eater I know.  Changed a couple things though.  I didn't have onions, but used a small can of chopped green chilies.  I also used 1/4 cup water and 2 Tbs of cornstarch mixture and poured it into the bubbling chili 2 minutes before it was done, and stirred to thicken it up a little.  Will make this again!

This recipe is an awesome starter recipe to which cooks can add their own personal touches.  The first time I made it, my chages were minor and it came out great!   This time, I followed the recipe in terms of cooking the meat first, but seasoned it with some salt and pepper prior.  Then I added the onion, let that hang for a few and added the garlic.  Instead of water, I used 1 cup beer and 1 cup chicken broth.  I let the beer hang out for a minute to let the alcohol evaporate a bit before adding the broth.  Then the crushed tomatoes and seasonings as per the recipe, minus paprika (I'm not a paprika gal in general).  With the beans, I mashed about half and left the rest whole.  I added about a tbs. of tomato paste to help thicken things.  I also added a little hint of fire roasted green chiles (maybe a tsp- 2 tsp) for a little extra flair .  Came out spicy, but with nice sweet undertones from the turkey.  Addng in some nice cheese when serving improves the flavor!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I really helps to gave a really good template to use and experiment with!

This is a good recipe but a little too hot for our family.  I will make it again and cut back on the spices a bit.  I also thought it needed more salt.  I added cheddar cheese and little sour cream to cool it down.

UPDATE:
 made this again and used chicken broth instead of water, 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes, a few squeezes of tomato paste and left out the cayenne.  Added shredded cheddar on top.  The spices were perfect and this wasn't as soupy by adding the tomato paste. This was now a 5 star in my opinion.

I'm giving three stars for the recipe as written, because I thought it good, not great, but it has potential. I found it to be a little to "hot", so next time I will cut back on cayenne and chili powder.  Afterwards I added corn, a red pepper, a square of unsweetened cocoa and a tbl of corn starch to thicken.  I mashed the beans, but I don't think it's necessary.

I used deer meat instead of turkey.  My husband thought it was really good. This is a very simple recipe and I will be using it again if it ever gets cold enough in Texas.

Made pretty much exactly according to the recipe (save using an extra 1/3 pound of turkey), and my wife just declared this her favorite chili.  Very easy, and delicious with a side of cornbread.

Took out some ground turkey this morning to make my favorite soup, but saw this instead. How easy and very tasty! I am not fond of spicy foods, but added just enough kick for DH. (He will add the rest.) I am always using basil and added a teaspoon of dried. It is a great addition. I also added some frozen corn and just let it simmer. Served with crackers as we usually do with chili. A great Saturday lunch! Thank you for the great tips.

This chili is terrific!  I did make a few changes though.  My family doesn't care for kidney beans, so I used black beans; added a can of chili beans; used beef broth instead of water; increased salt to 1 tsp.

This was pretty good and pretty quick.  I will definitely make it again.  I sauted the onions and added celery in while cooking the turkey.  Next time I will cut the turkey in half and add another can of beans (did not mash).  I also only added 1 T of mild chili powder.  We have some strong chili powder.

Awesome recipe! Cooked chili for the very first time using this recipe and it turned out great. I did make some changes to it though. Added some crushed tomatoes with jalapeno and Italian style crushed tomatoes and left out a little bit of chili powder.

5+++. LOVED this recipe. I added a can of corn, 1 can of black beans and 1 red bell pepper for veggies and color. It was spicy but not too bad. It was even better the next day. I couldn't get enough of it. The only thing I will change next time is to add less spicy pepper since my family and a 4-year-old don't care for spicy food. I made it with "grandmother's buttermilk cornbread" and it was a great, delicious dinner!!!

Great Recipe!! I made a few small changes: 1 cup water (not 2), Spicy Chili Beans (not kidney - personal preference), extra teaspoon garlic, and after bringing to a boil I added a green pepper (to avoid it getting mushy). It turned out great. The recipe is a keeper!

This was very good, full of flavor. I was out of crushed tomatoes, so I used 2 cans of Rotel. I cut the water in half and added a can of chili beans. It was a little spicy for me (after my own modifications) but my fiancee looooved it! Thanks :)

This chili was super easy to make. The only thing I did differently was I didn't mash the beans, and I cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half as suggested by others. It was delicious! Even with cutting the pepper in half it was still a little too hot for a few members of my family, and I don't think I would have been able to eat it with the full amount either. So be careful!

I'm not a big chili fan, but loved this recipe!!  Used ground chicken instead of turkey as it was what I had on hand.  Also left out the cumin.


Very easy and tastey!

Yummy. I doubled the cumin and bumped up all the rest by half.  Added more beans too.  Thick and delicious.  Great with cornbread + honey butter.

THis was sooooo yummy! The only thing I did different was used Cannelini beans in stead of kidney beans cuz that's all i had, but then I added an extra can of beans without smashing them and also added a small can of diced green chilies! YUM!!!

Very tasty - I really like the seasonings in this chili!I didn't mash the beans, that's about the only modification I made.

This came out really good and was extremely simple to make. I didn't have any kidney beans so I just used black beans only, also I like a lot of flavor so I used about 4 tablespoons of chili seasoning, I omitted the paprika, and instead of cayenne pepper I used chili pepper about 1 1/2 tablespoons. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again!

Finally, a chili recipe using turkey that I like! I substituted 2 14.5 ounce cans of Diced Tomatoes with spices (sorry, I don't remember the spices) for the crushed tomatoes. And I substituted 1 15 ounce can of black beans (rinsed, but not mashed) for the kidney beans. I used 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and used about 1 tsp of refrigerated minced garlic, which I added to the olive oil before cooking the ground turkey. I used 1 1/4 pounds of ground white meat turkey. I didn't add salt since the diced tomatoes had plenty. This will be a regular meal at our house. I'll have to figure out how to tone down the spiciness (hot) because my husband and I prefer milder. But it really looked and tasted great.

This is a great traditional chili recipe. I followed the recipes exactly aside from adding a green pepper. I would think it would be great with ground beef as well, although the turkey was delicious. Such an easy recipe!

My little family loved this Chili.  It was really tasty and I followed some suggestions of other people by adding cinnamon, nutmeg, green bell pepper, celery and  1 can of chili beans.  My extremely picky 5 year old even asked for seconds.  That says it all!  This recipe is a keeper.

Very similar to the turkey chili that my family enjoys.  I add a chopped green pepper and a 12 ounce bottle of light beer (instead of the water).It really adds to the flavor, and the alcohol burns off. I don't like my beans mushy, so I put those in about 15 minutes before the chili is done.  It's great with a can of rinsed pinto beans as well as the kidney beans. Also, I will add a handful of fresh chopped cilantro at the end for color, right before digging in!

Good basic recipe.  I added carrots, celery, and hot chili sauce to taste.  I used the suggestion of others and added some cinnamon.  I found it an interesting taste change from the beef chili I'm used to.

Great tasting chili w/ the addition of: 1 can chili beans, 1 6 oz. can tomato paste and only 1 cup of water instead of 2.  We enjoyed this w/ cornbread muffins!

I read the comments before I made this and added the can of chili beans as well as reducing the water to 1 cup. It came out awesome! I'm actually back here to re-get the recipe after I lost it in a move...it's my families favorite!

This is a great, simple recipe.  My changes: Instead of crushed tomatoes, I use two 14 1/2 oz. cans of diced tomatoes w/ green pepper and onion (Del Monte).  They are pretty watery, so I omit the water altogether.  I don't use the olive oil, but rather just brown the turkey w/ a little bit of Pam and continue to make the rest of the chili in the same skillet.  It is a perfect consistency and I also add a little shake and stir of cinnamon just before covering to simmer.  It's really good served w/ shredded cheddar and sour cream in a cut out sourdough bread bowl.  Really excellent.

This was AWESOME! I only made a few alterations. I added a small can of diced green chiles, I only used 2 teaspoons of Chili Powder, and added a few dashes of hot sauce. I also added a shake of cinnamon. The major thing I did was used black beans instead of kidney beans. I added elbow macaroni and shredded "Mexican Blend" cheese (because my mom always did that). I loved it and my husband loved it! The recipe made a ton for the two of us, so we had it for leftovers for the next two days, but that was ok by us! Will definately make again!

On its own it's good,but I like my chili with alot more "substance" so I added.....a whole can of drained corn,a small can of drained mushrooms and leftover fresh mushrooms,2 cans of stewed tomatoes that I crushed myself because I didn't have already crushed,a can of tomato paste,2 cans of black beans instead of kidney with half of one mashed,and a jar of organic salsa. I didn't have garlic,so I used dried minced garlic,and I didn't have ground cayenne so I used red pepper flakes. I only used about 1 and 1/4 cups water.Simmered it all for 45 min. Served it with fat free sour cream and low fat cheddar. Oh my! Delish!

This is a great, quick turkey chili recipe.  I have made it a few times already - now I add an extra can of beans, and only mash half of one can.  If I'm making it quick and won't have time to simmer it down to thicken, I cut back on the water.  I have also made with ground beef when I don't have turkey in the house, and it is good that way too!  Leftovers are even better the next day.

great recipe, but i made a few changes. i cooked the turkey in a skillet with the onion and garlic before adding it to the pot. i also added 1 can of black beans and 1 can of corn. if you're worried about it being too soupy, let it simmer uncovered. it will steam off and thicken up. oh and this one is spicy!

Brought this to dinner at a friend's and got good reviews. Added twice the amount of beans to help add some more substance. We like our chili hot, so will add a lot more spice next time we make this for ourselves. Great stand-by recipe, though, when ground turkey is on hand.

I thought this was excellent, but did make a few changes.  Instead of the crushed tomatoes I added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and a 14.5 oz can of whole tomatoes.  I also did not drain the kidney beans and omitted the water.  I had no problem with the chili being soupy as some of the other reviewers had said.  I also just added one T of chili powder, since I have toddlers, and a cup of cooked pasta shells.  Turned out just right.

Good but not great. It's just too watery and not missing something. Would be great with some bell peppers and more veggies. Next time I'll stick to my fav turkey chili recipe.

I recommend using beer (an amber ale is good, something flavorful) instead of water.  You will simmer it long enough to cook off the alcohol, however the flavor will be much improved!  Also, add corn to the mix, as well as make cornbread on the side!  I like to top mine with avocado.  YUM.

This was great!!  I have only made veggie chili before this and this chili turned out super yummy.  It was quite spicy even though we like spicy food (and I only used 1 1/2 tbls of the chili powder).  I took other's suggestion and added a jar of diced tomatoes with chilis.  And, I added more veggies -- green pepper and carrots.  At first I didn't add the 2nd jar of kidney beans, but about an hour before eating it looked like it needed more -- and we love beans in our chili so I used all the beans.

I followed this recipe exactly and while it was good, it was a little bit too watery for my definition of chili, missing a little something (more beans I think) and a little too spicy.  Adding more beans/other fillings would cut down on the spice and really "finish" this recipe I think.

Very good. My hubby and dad loved it. It is on the soupy side though. I added another can of beans and a can of corn and it was still watery, more like soup. If you like a thicker chili then reduce the water. Next time I will use only one cup. Even so it did taste very good.

Excellent recipe, the entire family thought it was delicious. I used a can of pinto beans in place of kidney and also added a can of chili beans. However, I did not crush them. Also following another user suggestion I added a can of chilis. I will definately be making this again.

My husband is on Weight Watchers (maintenance) and this recipe is fabulous!  I always double it (except for the cayenne pepper) and it lasts for a couple of days.  In addition to the kidney beans (sometimes I mash them and sometimes I leave them whole), I add one can (two if recipe doubled) of rinsed great northern beans.  I also add some frozen corn niblets.  Even my sons, who are truly fussy eaters, love this chili.  They add sour cream and shredded mexican cheese.

I tweaked the recipe a bit for our own taste, but this chili was fabulous! Like many other reviews, I recommend one cup of water or even less, depending on your thickness preferences. Hubby ate two bowls of this chili, and he is picky about chili.

This was SO good and SO easy to make! I made a couple very simple substitutions...A can of chicken broth to replace the water. 2 16 oz. cans White Beans instead of kidney beans. Also, I added the minced garlic with the onions. Otherwise, I followed the recipe the same and it was great. Still great 2 days later! Thanks!

Great recipe for Turkey chili. Was delicious and healthier. The only thing different was I added 2 cans of kidney beands and I did NOT mash them. And my husband loved it. I added a dollop of sour cream and a pinch of shredded cheddar cheese.

Great chili!  The best seasoning.  When I made it the first time I accidently omitted the water and it turned out nice and thick.  I added an extra can of kidney beans unmashed.  And I like celery in chili so I add that for color and crunch.

This was very good , the only changes I made was to add a can of regular beans and I left out the cayenne pepper and it still had enough heat for my husband and I, you would never think it was ground turkey without being told.

I love this recipe, as does everyone i've shared it with. I'm usually not a fan of any dish where turkey imitates beef, but this is wonderful; dare I say, better than most beef chilis I have tried! It also works nicely to sub 3 serrano peppers for the cayenne. Thanks!

Loved this recipe.  We are cutting down on ground beef and this was the perfect way.  I only used 1/2 cup of water and added a can of tomato sauce.  Also I added an extra can of kidney beans and did not mash them. I also added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon. Delicious especially on our cold Alaska winter night.

This was the first chili I've ever made and it turned out great. I would recommend reducing the amount of cayene by about half, especially if you plan on serving this to kids.

Wasn't the best chili I have made but not the worst either.  We did find it way too watery and it was missing something too, can't put my finger on what would have made it better.

Made this without adding the water - would have been too soupy. Since I was making it for our family with small children, I only used 1 tbsp chile powder, left out the cayenne, used double cumin. I also added some Chipotle Tobasco sauce to give it a more smokey flavor.

I also used diced tomatoes and mashed them when I added the beans. Very cleaver to mash the beans when I have two people in the house who think they don't like beans :)

It was still too spicy for my 5 year old. Should have skipped the Chipotle sauce.

I loved this recipe, I cooked this in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high and it was ready to eat just before Monday night football started. Instead of using cayenne pepper I used nutmeg. Instead of water, I used chicken broth. I also added a can of black beans and green chiles. I perked it up a bit with some hot sauce too! Yum, I would definitely make it again.

This recipe is just average I think. It's a little bland and lacks a "kick" but it is easy to make for those cold days when you're craving something to warm you up.

I thought this recipe was good. However, I didn't mash the beans and because of that it was awful soupy. Next time I will use less water and maybe mash some of the beans.

This was my first-ever attempt at chili, and it turned out great!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used both kidney beans and chili beans for just the right amount of spice.  This one is a keeper!

Very bland flavor.  I even doubled the spices.  I do suggest using refried beans instead of mashing kidney beans.  The recipe sounded good... I froze what I made and maybe when I reheat it the flavors will come out.

I had to add extra hot sauce to get the flavor right.  My husband like "soupy" chili, so he was pleased with this one.

I have made this recipe several times, and my husband and two small boys love it, and so do I.  I saute the onion and garlic until transclusent first before I add the ground turkey, and I don't mash the beans--I just throw them in there rinsed  and whole.  Other than that, everything else is the same.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

Good, but not as thick as the slow cooker chili.

This was my first experience making chili.  It was so easy and very good.  I didn't have cayenne pepper so I added a couple dashes of Tabasco sauce and it was great!  I would highly recommend this healthier version of chili.

Pretty good...next time I think I will try using 1/2 crushed tomato and 1/2 chopped tomato and won't mash the beans.

I used several ideas from other reviews.  1) cut cayenne in half 2) doubloe beans 3) use black beans (I used half and half).
good.  The aroma got rave reviews while cooking.  with extra beans I might try a little extra seasoning but it was good.
It was

This was really good!  I'd like to see if I could adapt it to a slow-cooker recipe to let the flavors mingle more.  It was better the second day.  Wonderful with some corn muffins!

This is the first time I made chili. I wanted a recipe that was simple and tasted good. This chili was AWESOME!! My fiance and I loved it. This will become a regular!
