Hubs gushed over this.  "One of those recipes I tell you I love that I'll never see again."  (I rarely make the same thing twice) This is moist and chocolatey, just what you want in  a chocolate cake.  I preferred it without the Butterfingers frankly, as it was a little sweet, but Hubs said without them this is just plain chocolate cake. (What's wrong with THAT?) A homemade frosting in my view,Creamy Chocolate Frosting, also from this site, made all the difference in the world.  To have used the canned frosting directed in the recipe would have been a real deal breaker.

This is absolutely the best cake I have ever eaten!  Husband is not fond of chocolate cake, but he ate two pieces saying it was the most amazing cake ever!  I did not add the candy bar layers, used only the cake recipe and then frosted it with Best Chocolate Frosting recipe.  Loved it.

This cake recipe taste almost like devil's food cake. It was chocolatey but not too much chocolate. It was very moist. I used this recipe for my mother-in-law's birthday cake, and she loved it. I was using this cake recipe for a decorating project, so I did not use any of the candy on the cake. Other than the omission of candy, I followed the recipe without changed. I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I put in a Tablespoon and a teaspoon of vinegar to regular milk. I will definitely make this again.

I made this in two 9" layers for our traditional Birthday Cake for Jesus. Instead of coffee or water, I used buttermilk for all of the liquid. It took longer to bake than the recipe said, possibly because some ingredients were cold. Instead of the candy frosting, I made a white vanilla buttercream frosting. First I applied a layer of milk and powdered sugar frosting to seal the cake and let that harden for a little while before frosting with the buttercream. This is going to be an annual addition to our family Christmas meal!

Great layer cake recipe, i only made two layers not three.
The recipe could have been better if  it had all the ingredients, like for making chocolate frosting.
The idea of putting candy in between layers is  awesome

This is a great cake. I hate to be the person reviewing a recipe after I changed it...but I had no idea what extra fine sugar was..so I did 50/50 granulated sugar and powder sugar. the texture of this cake was a little more dense than a typical box cake..the coffee gave it a rich flavor. i recommend sticking to the round cake pans. i tried using a large rectangle..had a difficult time getting the cake to cook evenly. This is my new favorite chocolate cake!

Great recipe! No kidding though, the batter was REALLY thin, but it came out great. My icing came out a little too liquidy, so I added about a 1/4 cup of Jif Natural Creamy peanut butter to help thicken it. I did not have buttermilk either, so I let the cup of milk sit out with a tablespoon of white vinegar added to it for about 5 min before adding.

The edges were a little dry at first, but just letting the cake rest for about a half hour helped make it the most moist cake I've ever had!

Everyone loved it. The butterfinger coating was an especially nice touch.

This recipe worked well in two 9" cake pans. It is tender with a nice crumb and deep chocolate flavor. I skipped the candy bars and finished it simply with chocolate frosting. Classic and delicious -- a winner!

Easy to make, very rich and a little crumbly in terms of the texture. My chocolate loving husband loved it.
