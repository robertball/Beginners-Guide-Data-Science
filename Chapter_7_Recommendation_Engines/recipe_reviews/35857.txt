Sorry.  These should be called "Yogurt-Ranch Burgers," since they have little to do with actual gyros.  If you want to make a burger that will be like a gyro, use ground lamb mixed with onion, garlic, salt, marjoram, rosemary, and pepper.

We didn't like it. It wasn't authentic enough.  Next time I'll use ground lamb and instead of yogurt & ranch dressing I'll use one of the Tzatziki sauce recipes from here.

Tasted delicious!  I think next time I will just fry the meat and use as filling rather than make into burger patties- they fell apart for me!  The taste was fabulous though!

Yum! We made this into more of a "Greek taco"-style dish, just browning the beef (added garlic and oregano), then having everyone load up their pita as desired with the cucumber sauce, feta cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce.My husband even enjoyed it leftover for lunch the next day! Easy to make, and very tasty. I'll probably experiment with seasoning the sauce next time; the ranch dressing mix was fine, but I think the end result could be better with a little tweaking.

I made these burgers with ground Chicken instead of beef...and they were fabulous!  I also added crushed garlic to the cucumber sauce before adding it to the meat. Next time, I am going to add more onion.  These really tasted like a Gyro.  I used wraps instead of pita pockets.  Delicious!

These were so good.  The burgers were very moist and had a great flavor.  I served them on hamburger buns because of all of the reviews of the pita bread falling apart and just spooned the sauce over the burgers.

this was absoultely great.  I used 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 light sour cream.  (as one reviewer suggested).  I think next time I might even try adding a tad more ranch dressing.  the flavor was good I just like ranch dressing.

These were awesome and the whole family loved them.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I was a little concerned because the meat mixture was very moist but the patties held together nicely and cooked up perfectly.  I will make these, instead of the same old hamburgers, at our next cookout.  Great recipe, Theresa!  Thanks!

What the heck is so "gyro" about this? Not even close. Basic hamburger IMHO. Don't even bother.

Pretty good.  Next time we're going to just fry meat as a filling instead of a burger, & would use lamb burger instead of hamburger.

Very similar to an old Detroit area restaurant's "Middle Eastern" that I've made for years (looked to see if anyone had an "official" recipe).  

Differences?  Brown the ground beef as filling (not burger) with your favorite seasoning and scoop into pita pocket.  Top with plain chopped/seeded cucumber, tomato, green onions and ranch dressing.  For some reason, the flavors work!

I used 1 pound beef and 1/2 pound pork because that is what I had at home.  Turned out well.  The hamburgers were good just by themselves as well.  Husband liked them and said I should make them again.

Too bland.  You can add some spices to get a little bit more out of it (we added lemon juice from 1 lemon, ground pepper, 1 clove garlic, 1 tsp garlic powder).  But it is so quick and easy and light that I will probably make again.  We did not make the meat into patties since we had snow out on our deck but rather just browned and added the dressing and onions after we drained the fat.
Adding feta to top it off really added a nice touch.

The name may be mis-leading, but this can be tasty.  It's just not really gyros.  I think people are missing the lamb taste - pretty distinctive taste, and pretty different from beef.  They used to serve something like this at a restaurant we went to, and we loved them.  The big difference:  loose hamburger meat.  The good thing about the meat being loose rather than in a burger form is that the flavors can mingle better.  Give this a try.

This was pretty good.  Next time I would just brown the meat into crumbles so that its easier to stuff in the pita without ripping it.

Sorry, I'm gonna have to stick with my neighborhood Greek restaurant if I want a good gyro. Not very authentic-tasting, and the meat got a weird consistency, so I would recommend frying. If you would even attempt this recipe, because I'm sure there are better ones out there.

Like others, I couldn't keep them from falling apart, so I just scrambled the meat mixture in a fry pan.  I also added more seasoning since they were a little bland.  The side sauce was good though.  I put the cukes through the fdood processor to make it more smooth.  Served with tator tots, so not a total loss.

The meat was super moist and a nice change to the regular hamburger. Next time I would strain the yogurt in some thick paper towels ahead of time to remove the extra water because it was kind of runny and squeeze the water out of the cucumber as well. Other than that, I would definitely make again!

I love this recipe, I have used it a few times.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 11 x 17 inch baking dish (greased), baked for 25 minutes at 400, removed it from dish, placed it on a baking sheet to cool.  Then added sauce and toppings (with fresh basil on top), baked for 15-20 minutes - voila!
My kids and husband loved it!

The burgers were O.K. The sauce was not good with the burgers- but great for a salad dressing! The sauce doesn't come close to the sauce the regular gyros have on them.

My family liked the burgers very much and, unike some other reviewers, we had no problem with them falling apart. The sauce could easily have been cut in half and still be more than enough for 6 burgers. Sauce could have used some more zing. Next time I will add garlic, pepper and lemon juice and some fresh chopped dill. Thanks!

These were OK. I was disappointed that the patties fell apart so much. The flavor was good, but not Greek at all. I bet if you added some type of Greek seasoning to the meat it would be much better. I would still probably make it again. My 4 yr old liked it.

The flavor was good, but the burgers didn't stay together. They were fine, but I don't think I'll make them again for presentation reasons.

We loved this recipe!  I used Trader Joe's Buffalo Burgers and cut down on the amount of dressing that was added to each sandwich.  I will definitely make this again!

We liked these, and will have them again, but did have a few critiques.  Hubby and I both agreed the sauce was too grainy from the dressing packet, and it didn't taste very Greek.  I added about 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and that helped a little bit, but it still needed something.  I also think the dressing would taste better with the cucumber pureed into the dressing in a blender, rather than chopped into chunks.  Also, I subbed ground turkey for ground beef (a family preference, and its healthier).  While they tasted great, the burgers fell apart, so I would suggest scaling back the dressing in it and adding an egg to help bind the burgers.  But truly, overall, these are pretty good, and a very healthy, creative meal.

These burgers were very tasty--very moist and flavorful.  The pita wasn't sturdy enough to hold all the fixins--it ended up leaking cucumber sauce, so next time I'll try a flat bread instead of the pita.  Very good.

Awesome!  We eat at a Middle Eastern restaurant and this recipe hit the mark.  The "slaw" was so similar to what we enjoy eating out.  It was not complicated to make and had a punch of flavor. I think the pita bread we used was a little stale as it was impossible to make a pocket for the meat.  We will defiantly make this one again.  Thank you!!

This is fabulous.  It is quick and easy.  The burgers are very moist and flavorful.  I also added minced garlic to the sauce and the burgers. Also, I found hamburger buns easier.  I placed the lettuce and sliced tomato on the side and used the cucumber sauce as a dressing.  Great summer meal!

These are called gyro "burgers", but if you want the meat to have that more traditional "feel", you can either massage the meat for a minute or two (stretching it out and folding it back) or simply running the whole mix through the food processor for 30 seconds or so.

These were yummy.  I did ground meat instead of making a pattie.  Also, i couldnt find pita bread so we used plain softshell taco's.  I would suggest putting a little dill in the sauce and garnish it with garlic salt.

These were better than I expected them to be.  My family loved them.  My picky 8 year old had seconds.  She said this is her new favorite meal.  I give it 5 stars for that!  She doesn't like any new recipes I try.  This was not authentic, but it's not supposed to be.  For an americanized version of a greek favorite and a nice altrnative to regular hamburgers, it was perfect!

Good flavor - I added bread crumbs to the hamburger mixure to keep it together - they didn't fall apart at all.  Next time I'll make some tzatiki to put on the cucumbers instead of the plain yogurt to add a little zip.  My family loved this recipe

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  The cucumber sauce was wonderful and the whole recipe was quick and easy to prepare.  The burgers did tend to fall apart on the grill.  The pitas we used kept falling apart so we just put it on the plate and piled everything up on top and ate it with a knife and fork.  Everyone in the family liked it and we had no leftovers.  I will definitely be making this again.

I was surprised how easy and good these turned out! My boyfried was craving a gyro and these really came in handy!  The cucumber sauce is delicious.  We folded the Pita pockets in half because other people said they fell apart. That seemed to work fine for us.  Thank you Theresa!

Really liked these!  I do need to experiment a little more with the cucumber sauce cause wasn't overly crazy about the yogurt taste.  I did add some sour cream and might use more sour cream next time. The burgers were very tender.  My husband loves gyros and thought these tasted very close to the real thing.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will make again.

Used a large container of plain yogurt, I would suggest adding the ranch dressing mix to taste, all of it was too strong had to be diluted.  I sprinkled ground turkey instead of making burgers and it was good and more healthy.

This is a great recipe and a great final product. The cucumber sauce is nice. The whole dish is a great summer time entree. I served it with a prepackaged "Mediterranean" Salad mix with Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing and feta cheese. I scaled it down to 4 servings and it was enough for my wife and I with one left over for my lunch tomorrow. Nice.

If they called this something other then Gyro Burgers, then it might have been really good. But I expected gyro, um...not so much. This might pass as a gyro burger for those that pronounces it "gyro" and not "euro" like it should be and maybe never had a REAL Gyro. If you want a Gyro tasting burger, you might want to look else where.

These actually turned out pretty good.  I didn't know what to expect after some of the previous reviews, but i can certainly see why a few small tweaks were necessary.  I used 2 pounds of beef (1 lean, 1 medium), kept the yogurt mixture the same, added some panko bread crumbs and minced garlic, and my burgers stayed together on the grill!!  No crumbling or falling apart.  My husband and I thought maybe next time we might TOAST the buns, or pita or whatever we use.  We used regular hamburger buns and the sauce made them kind of soggy by the end of the burger, but toasted might be a good thing!!!  Will try next time for sure!  Also, kids loved these burgers, even with the yogurt sauce!  A couple of 8 year olds, a 5 year old and a 3 year old.  Anyway, all in all, a pretty good recipe, most people would probably want to tweak it anyway.

These are really great!  I have made these a few times, and just made them for my extended family and they ALLLL disappeared.  Really wonderful, flavorful and easy.  I served them with the whole wheat pita recipe, and greek potatoes.  As well as an incredible baklava recipe.  All found on Allrecipes.

My husband and I loved these!  The recipe did make a LOT of the cucumber sauce.  Will try using less yogurt next time and will probably substitute some sour cream.  My husband has asked when we will be having these again.

Not exactly 'authentic', but VERY tasty! I make this alot with some fresh pita. It's also pretty good using a 50/50 of ground beef and ground lamb.

These are good! I make a whole big batch and freeze the patties individually so I can pull them out when I want them!  I really enjoy these, but instead of ground beef, I use turkey (like with all my recipes).  I also added some feta cheese to pita at the end.  Yummy!

Wonderful flavor for a unique sandwich... I tweeked the recipe by using low-fat sour cream, Italian dressing mix (usually no MSG), skipped the lettuce but added slivered red onion to the cucumber mixture.... Then garnished with fresh cilentro and lime wedges to squeeze over the fillings. I thought it was flavorful, juicy, and a refreshing change from just another burger!!

Fantastic!  I just need to find some pitas that don't disintegrate when you fill them.  Next time I might cut up the burgers and make tortilla wraps instead.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks.

This was great. There was some topping sauce left over. Next time I would probably put more in the burgers. The pita kept falling apart. But it didn't matter my family loved it. And it was fast and easy. This one is going in my recipe box!

Very yummy!  I even used plain pre-made hamburger patties and just spiced them up before grilling.  I really only used the recipe for the sauce and then used a pita pocket to put the burger in.  It was great!!

I was not overly impressed with this.  I didn't think the burgers had much flavor and they seemed a little bland.  I think I might try putting in some garlic or some other spices.  The pita was also a pain because it kept falling apart.  We ended up having to eat them with a fork and knife instead of as a sandwich.  I think this has potential and I will probably try it again with some modifications.

Ranch dressing mix was overwhelming. Made another batch of cucumber sauce and added minced garlic. Did not make the ground beef into patties. Had no pita bread. Placed the filling in bowls including the lettuce and cucumber sauce. This recipe will be deleted from my recipe box. I am happy for those who found your recipe delightful. Thank you.

I thought this was great except you have to really smother the burgers completely b/c the burgers themselves really have no flavor even with the mix added to it. But the cucumber sauce was delicious and will make again but spice up the burgers more! The burgers were moist and wanted to fall apart on the grill but it wasn't too bad like other reviewers stated. I gave 5 stars b/c it was different, easy and still very flavorful!

Second review: Made it with pitas this time and it was exceptional!  I will be making this one often, especially for the summer!  We really liked this one. I didn't expect it to taste just like a gyro, but I still thought the cucumber sauce had that kick.  We didn't have pita bread, just ate the burgers smothered in the sauce and tomatoes, and everyone loved them.  The meat does try to fall apart, I would recommend carefully forming the patties and then placing them in between wax paper.  It might even help more to throw them in the freezer for a few minutes before putting on the grill.  Mine did not fall apart, and I would say follow the grilling rule of turning them just once and yours won't either!  I am hoping to find pita pockets the next time I make them, because I definitely think that will add even more to the recipe.

I fried a tiny sample of the meat mixture and was highly disappointed with the flavor.  Using 1 tablespoon of Greek Seasoning (from this web site) mixed into the remaining meat gave it a pleasantly Greek taste.  Next time I'll use two tablespoons of the seasoning so it will taste much more like a gyro.  I shaped the patties into half circles so they fit perfectly into the pitas, pan fried and we enjoyed them.  But Greek Seasoning is an absolute MUST to make this recipe worthwhile.

YUMMY! I must say this is very good and an excellent twist to plain old hamburgers. I have made the yogurt/cucumber sauce and used it in other recipes as well, very good! A def must try for everyone!

The meat was delicious however for some reason my burgers fell apart on the grill.  I'm thinking it was too much yougurt or maybe I should have added some crackers to keep them together.  I'll make again and see what happens.

This was good. I made some changes though. It was easier for me just to brown the ground beef instead of doing patties and I put in in the pita which I cut in half.

I did not make any changes to the original recipe and my husband and I both thought it was fantastic! Pitas didn't fall apart like some other reviews said.

Made these last night and I won't make them again.  I don't like the idea of eating lamb, but love the cucumber sauce of gyro's; my boyfriend loves gyros so we thought this would be a good combination.  Burgers came out fine, not falling a part; we did not care for the creamy sauce. I will use the rest of the burgers as just regular hamburgers.

We really liked the dressing.  But next time, will use a pita pocket instead of the flatbread because of the mess.  Thanks for the recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  Everyone ate it and asked for more.  Burgers were moist and melted in your mouth.  I served it with red onion, lettuce, tomato.  Had no pita problems either.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The cucumber sauce was perfect.  The beef patties were moist and stayed together and my pita didn't fall apart.  I served this with chopped onion and tomato.  This almost satisfied my gyro craving but I think if you incorporated ground lamb, coriander, cumin, etc. it would be more authentic.  I will make again.

The beef did not fulfill the Gyro cfaving that I had... but the cucumber sauce did hit the spot. I blended my cucumbers (because my husband does not like them) and that made it a little too runny. Pita's did fall apart, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to deal with for a gyro loaded with cucumber sauce.

I'm sorry but I just didn't go for this recipe.  The cucumber dressing sounded so good but it just wasn't what I had hoped for.  Nothing special.
