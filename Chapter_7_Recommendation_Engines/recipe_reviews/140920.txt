This is the first recipe I have used from this site. I was cooking for my girlfriend who is a very fussy eater, so I decided to do her a vegiterian dish, it went down really well, she loved it and it took no time at all.
Since then I have used the recipe again but used Chicken instead of Tofu, this is equally as nice, a word of warning, if you are not keen on spicy food only use half the amount of Cayenne Pepper.

This was a nice, simple stir fry. It lacked a little in flavor of the sauce, so I added a bit of szechuan to taste. The tofu took on the flavor quite nicely. Served on top of white rice.

Prepared as directed.  Very little taste.  Tofu just dropped into a wok for one minute is not going to absorb any flavor.  Wouldn't make again.

I used this recipe to introduce my 3 and 6 year old to tofu.  The 6 year old loved it but the younger one wouldn't even try it.  I marinated the tofu in soy sauce and sherry for a few hours first and added some minced ginger in with the garlic.  I also stir fried some shiitakes into the veggies.  Overall very nice.

This recipe was excellent. I didn't have any sherry, so I used an extra dry Vermouth instead, and it worked out wonderfully. My father didn't even know it was tofu until I said something later. He was just wondering why the chicken was so squishy.

This was good. Only made a few changes that I don't think really affected the recipe. I deleted the nuts becacuse my kids don't like them. I used veggie chicken broth to make it vegetarian, and red wine for sherry since I was out. Gotta say this tastes like the restaurant version without any mystery ingredients. Gonna keep this around for the future.

Very delicious. I did add a little Maple Syrup to make the flavor sweeter.

I did 4 cups of broccoli and 2 red peppers, reduced the oil to 2 1/2 tsp (used olive oil) cooked for 10 min. upped the sherry and chicken broth a little and let the tofu saute with the sauce for at least 5 min. so the tofu can soak up more of the flavor. I use more veggies instead of serving over rice and find this meal to be extremely satisfying.Sometimes I sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. FYI my husband loves this dish!

Great flavor. I doubled the amount of sauce and still found there wasn't as much as I would have liked there to be. Next time, I'll triple it.

This was good. I doubled the recipe and found that it didn't need quite as much cornstarch.  For me, this made it too thick.  I added a little ginger to the recipe, and next time, I'll add a lot more.

As long as you don't skimp on the garlic, this stirfry tastes lovely.  I marinated the tofu for a few hrs in Soy sauce and sesame oil, but I put it in too early and it ended up getting all mushy.  I recommend frying up the tofu first so it keeps its shape better.

Great flavours!  We really enjoyed this recipe.   I added carrot and zucchini as I didn't have any bell pepper and was trying to use up the vegies in the fridge.  Also only had sweet sherry in the cupboard so used that too.  As suggested in the reviews I marinated the tofu in soy sauce for 1 hour before cooking and was happy that I had as well as it had great flavour.  Will be making this one again

We used sesame oil, a touch of honey, and white wine instead of sherry. We doubled the recipe to have leftovers ( lunch! ) and served over rice. Really great!!

We really love this recipe.  The sauce is fantastic.  I add in orange pepper, mushrooms and then use an asian stir fry mix with broccoli, carrots, and corn which I only heat about 2/3 of the way and then throw into the pan at the end.  We eat this a lot!!

Even after marinating the tofu and spicing things up a little with some ginger, this was just lacking. The flavor was bland. I added Sriracha to the finished product, but it was still lacking flavor. If I were to make this again, I would definitely marinate the tofu and add onion, although I don't know if that would help a great deal.

Really good! I added mushrooms and put in the whole package of tofu, so I made a little extra sauce to compensate for it. It still needed some soy sauce at the end. If I make this again, I would try stir-frying the tofu first to make it more crispy.

This was a great starter recipe! I used extra firm, light tofu, cut it into triangles and sauteed it first in sesame and olive oil, and set aside. I also added in some peanut sauce, and thai chili sauce and tripled the other ingredients. I didn't have cashews so I chopped up almonds and added those at the end. Its a keeper!

I loved this recipe! Delicious and beautiful! I'm a vegetarian so I used vegetable broth. I doubled the sauce because we like our food saucy, toasted the cashews, and used some leftover tofu that I had fried up.  I will make this often. Thanks!

Tweaked a few things to make it five star. I pressed the tofu under a brick for 20 minutes first, salted it, and then just fried it in some corn oil so it would get nice and crispy. Took it out, turned the heat a bit lower and proceeded with the recipe. I didn't have Sherry so I used Japanese Mirin. Also , blanched the broccoli in advance. End result was just like the Chinese restaurant. Loved it

As with other reviews, I doubled the sauce, except I kept the cornstarch as written. I marinated the tofu in the sauce without the cornstarch to infuse it with more flavour. I also added 1 Tbsp thinly sliced ginger to the garlic before frying the vegetables. I set the cooked vegetables aside, then fried the drained tofu. Afterwards, I added the vegetables back. To the marinade, I mixed the cornstarch and 2 Tbsp chunky peanut butter instead of cashews at the end. I poured the marinade into the pan and cooked until thickened. The result was amazing!

I made this dish last night and will be making again tomorrow night absolutely amazing. I did not add nuts not to nut friendly and I left the stir fry on simmer  for  about 10 minutes after it was done to add a little more flavor to the Tofu. Great dish this will become a regular in my house

To make the sauce "better" I doubled the sauce ingredients like RunsWithScissors did (but put 4 tablespoons of soy sauce!) and I added 2 teaspoons of sugar and a tablespoon of freshly ground ginger!

I stumbled upon this recipe because I was looking for another broccoli tofu stir fry that I've made 5 years ago but sadly it was no where to be found. This recipe is almost like the one I had years ago but I added ingredients of the "original" stir fry (sugar, cashews, and ginger).

I cut the tofu into cubes and deep fried until brown. Set aside in paper towel. I also toasted the cashew. Added both ingredients at the end. Since I had no sherry, I used Mirin (found in Japanese or Asian stores). I added stock as the first time I cooked the sauce was too little.

Better than a restaurant! Made a few alterations due to ingredients on hand and personal preferences but overall it was two thumbs up :) will definately be making again

We have used this recipe over and over with different proteins - chicken, tofu, beef - and changed up the veggies slightly. It is the simple sauce that makes it so delicious. I double the chicken broth to make it slightly saucier. One of my families favorites! Plus - super easy for me to make quickly.

I made this last night with a couple of tweaks (added stir fry veggies and green instead of red bell peppers because it's what was in the fridge!). Like some of the other reviewers, I found it to be lacking in flavor. The 4 minced garlic cloves in the pan were deceiving - they smelled amazing but didn't create a big enough taste for me. Overall it was decent, I'll tweak a bit more the next time!
