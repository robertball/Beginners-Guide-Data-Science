Simply delicious, and a pretty and colorful addition to the dinner plate. I left out the mushrooms and corn, but this is not a significant deviation from the intent of this recipe. Until the last minute, I was going to shy away from the jalapeno,thinking it had no place here. While it provided no heat (which comes from the seeds and membrane) it did just enough to enhance the flavor. Measuring the ingredients isn't necessary, and would take away from the simple joy of preparing this recipe if you did. I love herbs and spices, but I disagree with those who said this was bland and required the addition of herbs.  What's important is the wine, the garlic, and the wonderful combination of colorful, fresh vegetables. These are simple, fresh flavors--not bland flavors that need doctoring.  Perfect as written, this was also the perfect complement to the grilled chicken and patty pan squash we served with it.

This is incredible! If you don't like spice, leave the jalapenos out and you will not miss out on the flavor. Try using squid instead of the orzo. Sounds strange... but it's delicious.

This recipe makes a lot of food, so expect leftovers!  It's also pretty bland, but perked up after I added a bit of rosemary and thyme.

I thought this was very good.  It's a rather simple recipe in that it doesn't have many flavour add ins with herbs, etc. however, I think this recipe is a great side that will nicely complement many main attractions.  The jalapenos add a nice kick and all of the wonderful veggies in there make it colourful and delicious.  The white wine adds a subtle flavour that I definitely would not omit!  Good job, ty.

DELICIOUS!!! I was looking for a recipe similar to one I had at a restaurant and this was amazing! I added 1/2 cup of fresh cream to make it more sauce-y I also substituted chorizo sausage for the hot peppers, and I served it over raviolis. I'm definately making it again!

My sister-in-law brought this recipe as a dish to pass.  I enjoyed it very much.  I have always been a fan of orzo and this is a great way to serve it.  I shared this recipe with my friends.

This is very tasty, colorful, and simple to make. I tripled the amount mushrooms and left out some of the peppers, but this recipe is great because you can suit it to your taste.

Very good and good to look at too.  Have been trying out different orzo recipes since discovering this little pasta.  If it is too bland for some, they could add more jalapeno, but I like being able to taste the different ingredients, it's a fresh appealling summer salad.  Goes great with grilled steak or chicken or fish.

This is delicious! I made a few modifications though. Instead of white wine I used white grape juice, and instead of using a fresh tomato I used a can of diced tomatoes. I also added shrimp to make this dish a full meal.

Sorry - but this is not delicious at all. It was totally boring and unsavory. None of us could stomach more than one serving. What a waste!

This was very easy to make but a little bland, even after adding Italian seasoning, fresh basil and parmesan cheese.  I used leeks in place of the onions and omitted the corn.  Very colorful and pretty, I would just add a little more seasoning next time.

This recipe was definitely a crowd pleaser!  I originally only used one jalepeno because I was afraid it would be too spicey but later added cayenne pepper because it wasn't spicey enough.  Also, I was disapointed at first because I thought the corn overpowered the recipe but after a few hours, that issue seemed to go away.  I brought it to easter dinner and everyone loved it.

This recipe is soooo great!  Everyone was raving!!!  I made it with Chipotle Olive Oil, left out the mushrooms, Hot Jalepenos from a jar, and added a pinch of crushed red pepper.  It was a little spicy but not too much.  I am definitely  making this again!

Not bad - just lacking somewhat in flavor. I used more mushrooms, just because we love them.  I ended up adding lemon pepper seasoning and some rosemary to the pan and a just a "glug" more wine.  Next time I'm thinking maybe I'll throw some broccoli in it, too.

Very good! My husband loves his with a little extra hot sauce on it. I didn't have any jalapeno's, so I omitted those and put the hot sauce in when I put the onion & peppers in. The white wine adds just enough flavor. Overall, we really like it and think we may try it with brown rice next time.

This was really good and invites tailoring to change it up. There were a lot of leftovers which went over well mixed with condensed cream of mushroom soup. It turned it into a casserole pretty much and worked really good for lunch. I'll be making this again.

I skipped the jalapeno peppers and substituted chicken stock for the wine but otherwise left this recipe pretty much as is.  The entire family loved it and I will make it again for sure.  Easy enough to add in whatever veggies are in the house and a great addition to my side dish rotation.  Thanks for posting!

2 jalapeno's???!!!  This recipe was so hot that I couldn't even stand one bit.  We really like spicy foods and this was unbarely and a disapointment.  I have made tons of recipes from all recipes and this is the first one I reviewed because it was so bad.

This was pretty good; the guys didn't care for it as a main vegetarian course so I should have served it as a side. Use a giant skillet if you're making the whole recipe; I had to transfer it all to a pot since it ended up not fitting in my large skillet.  I think the overwhelming amount the recipe makes may have turned me off a little. I did end up salting it; I don't think calling it "bland" is fair, but it's not super flavorful.  Worth trying in a smaller batch if you don't have many mouths to feed.

Add rosemary, thyme, and parmesan cheese to really make this dish stand out!

This is a great base recipe that welcomes different additions. This time I substituted Italian Chicken Sausage for the jalapeños (2 part hot 1 part sweet) and a can of chopped tomatoes with green chiles since I didn't have any fresh tomatoes in the house. Left out the mushrooms since I don't care for them, and used whole wheat orzo. It came out great - quite spicy actually, less hot italian sausages next time! Thanks for the recipe!

Really good, nice job Molle. I too added some thyme and rosemary. This recipe does make a lot though, you'll most definately have some leftovers. It's very filling!

Sorry, but this dish is bland & unappetizing.  My husband and 2 of my teenage daughters went scrounging through the fridge to find something else to eat for dinner.

Not bad at all...thanks for sharing Molly. We all quite enjoyed this -even without the jalapenos and mushrooms which I'm not particularly crazy about-. My compliments to your boyfriend for inventing this dish; it really does taste great! Will try using the squid next time, too. Does it need to be fresh or can I buy it dried? Let me know, and keep up with the recipe submissions :)

Great recipe to use as a guide for me to tweak to our family’s liking! We didn’t have mushrooms, and I forgot to add diced tomato. I definitely added more spices, and we also put in some sliced up chicken sausage. Seems like a easy go-to for when you don’t know what to make, and you have a bunch of random veggies in the kitchen!

I didn't have any Jalepeno peppers so I used Aleppo pepper. I also added artichoke hearts and crab. Was a nice dish and I'd make it again.

sort of bland, I added an extra tbsp. of garlic, I omitted the hot peppers bc I don't like them.  on the positive side it can be eaten hot and/or cold.

This was a delicious side dish that went well with our dinner. I left out the mushrooms but otherwise followed the recipe.   It really does make a a lot,  so next time I will cut the recipe in half.

This is one of my favorite side dishes! You can make it as spicy as you'd like with the jalapeños and the wine sauce gives it great flavor!

For more flavor try sautéing the orzo in butter and salt until golden brown, then add the cooking water to the skillet (similar to instructions for boxed rice/vermicelli side dishes).  It will add a depth to the orzo that boiling will not.

I had never had orzo before, and this was the recipe I chose to try. I enjoyed it, but since my family eats rice often, the texture of the orzo pasta was noticeably different and I'm afraid my wife and two teens weren't big fans of it.  
I did find the garlic a bit overpowering, so if I made this again for myself, I would probably halve the amount. Seven minutes of boiling time is enough to cook the orzo.

The opposite of delicious. This was incredibly bland to the point where my husband and I took only a few bites each before admitting defeat and throwing out the entire pot of food.
