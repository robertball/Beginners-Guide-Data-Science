This was a very good combination if you like beets!  I didn't have any canned beets so I boiled some fresh ones and used the water I boiled them in for the sauce.  I would suggest adding the suger gradually and tasting after each addition...I think I only ended up adding about 1/4 of a cup.

This was good and easy to make.  I used fresh beets, boiled, and saved the water, just like another reviewer.  I used 1/4 cup of honey instead of any sugar, and it was great.  The family liked it.

Really yummy and easy. My little girl liked it and liked that it turned the rice pink. Watch out for drips on clothes though! I only used 1/4 cup sugar and I didn't have oyster sauce so I substituted 1/2 teaspoon of fish sauce. I'm betting it's much better with oyster sauce.

This was a quick and easy recipe... I was looking for a recipe to use my homemade pokeberry juice which is about the same color as beets and came across this recipe... I also had several ingredients in the freezer which needed to be used up like a pork tenderloin with freezer burn some prosciutto (extra bonus) and ginger. I had my usual garlic in the crisper and just happened to have oyster sauce... so... voila!... I had everything except the beets... it still tasted OK... a bit sweet to eat every day (I used a cup of sugar) but good nonetheless... I would make it again and try some variations... I suspect it is a very forgiving, versatile recipe... probably better with a veggie in it... beets or even green pepper...
