My mother worked at a Ogden, UT Blue Onion  restaurant in the early 70's, so we grew up with this.  It is a very simple and general condiment for lots of things in place of ketchup, mayo or similar condiments.  I have always known and made it as the "Secret Sauce" because that's what mom called it. None of our friends knew about it when we moved to CA or elsewhere.  We've converted a lot of people that just can't do plain ketchup any more.  You can tweak the ratio to whatever your preference is...(more mayo, more ketchup or 50/50).  You really can't mess it up.  We've never measured it.  It's great to see someone put this recipe up to share---why didn't I think of it! LOL

If you want this to taste more like Artic Circle you have to add buttermilk. Our Article circle used to use this 'white sauce' (fry sauce before the catsup) on it's hamburgers.
If you don't have buttermilk I've heard you could use a bit of dill pickle juice.

I found that if you add a couple of drops of liquid smoke it tastes just like you got some wild dipping sauce from Good Times Burger. YUMMY!

Ketchup and Mayo alone is not Utah fry sauce. 
2 parts mayo to 1 part ketchup and white vinegar.
1/8 c mayo, 1 1/2 T ketchup, 1/2t white vinegar. 
(The white vinegar makes it smooth and adds flavor)
Thats the recipe! :-)

This sauce has been a favorite in New Orleans for years.  Try adding (to taste) horseradish when eating boiled or fried seafood.  It's awesome!!!!

I've been making this sauce for years, but I wasn't aware it had a name.As a matter of fact, a Utah native gave me the tip. We love it with burgers, fries, chicken, fish and on sandwiches. For a variation try tartar sauce 2 to 1 with ketchup. Its great too. Thanks Keith.

The ingredients sound a little weird, but suprisingly enough it's deicious.  I ate this on a hamburger.  I haven't tried this with BBQ sauce because I enjoyed the ketchup so much. Don't think hubby would care for it...he's not a big fan of mayo.  Very quick and simple.  Thanks for sharing.

I added about an 1/8 cup of barbecue sauce (maybe a little more) to this recipe and it tasted just like the o-ring sauce from Red Robin.  My kids loved it!

Ive been making this sauce for years. Theres several variations you can use to suit your taste. I always add a small drop of mustard to give it a little spice. Also good with ranch, mayo, ketchup, and mustard. I always make this when i have fries. I add ranch or bbq sauce depending on my mood.

Very simple and can be adjusted to your own personal tastes. Kick it up with some tabasco or play it tame with a bit of BBQ sauce.  I've had some really great french fry sauces on this site and this is a great base - probably good for kids.

I think it's funny that a lot of people aren't familiar with fry sauce! It comes with everything here (in Oregon). I didn't know the proportions to make it, so I looked up this recipe. However, I followed the advice of other reviewers and did about 50% mayo, 40% ketchup, and 10% barbeque (Big Al's KC Barbeque from this site). Mmm, mmm, mmm! Very good.

I made this to go w/ the curly fries I made for our lunch of roast beef sandwiches. Very good - although I must admit I added each ingrediant to taste. If your fond of miracle whip like I am - that is also a nice tangy combination. Thanks for posting this Keith!

Try adding 1/2 tsp of white vinegar to it!!! I also use onion and garlic powder in mine. Those 3 things give it so much flavor! I use to not use anything for fries until I came across this recipe. I can't get enough of it!!! If you want some kick to it add some cayenne powder! Yum!!!

My Niece, who owns a couple of restaurants uses "Fry Sauce" with fresh snipped or dried Dill Weed mixed in, on her Reuben Sandwiches, in place of "regular" 1000 Island Dressing ...

Myself, I sieve a hard boiled egg and a splash of lemon juice mixed with the "Dill Fry Sauce" and use for a shrimp cocktail sauce ... 
It's pretty tasty as a bread spread for plain old cheese sandwiches also ...

I've also made Fry Sauce for years. In fact, I'm famous for my fry sauce (at least at my house...). Red Robin serves a sauce with its bottomless steak fries (!!!!!) that uses BBQ and mayo. To die for. When the waiter told us about it, I about fell off my chair in excitement. I'm a Utah native living in NC, and no one but the people I go to church with know anything about fry sauce. Back to "My Fry Sauce", I add a little BBQ as well as A-1 along with the ketchup and mayo. Kicks it up just the right number of notches.

It was the Artic Circle in Midvale, Utah that created this delicious little wonder & during my 10 year stint there, I drank this sauce like it was mothers milk. We even made salad dressing out of it. Here's my advice. Go 50/50 on the mayo to ketchup ratio. Mix & taste, then figure out which you prefer more of & go from there in a larger batch. Usually its more mayonnaise than ketchup. You CAN also add a drop of liquid smoke & have it taste exactly like major restaurant chains but that's NOT what REAL Utah Fry Sauce is about. If it ain't broke folks......Sometimes simplicity is its own perfection.

This is good.  Needed a little more zip to it for me.  I added a sprinkle of seasoned salt, 1/8 tsp ground cayenne pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon fry seasoning (from the Amish store).

I made this for a Big Love marathon party (we served funeral potatoes, frog-eye salad, carrot salad, jello...) It got mixed reviews from other guests, but I really liked it.  You can vary the ratio to your liking (more or less mayo as you please).  And some people mixed a bit of chopped pickle relish in it too.  I thought it was good for french fries and burgers. I'm from NY, so this was a bizarre looking combination for me. I'm glad I tried it!

This recipe confirms that this website is definately a great way to find out how to make even the most basic recipes!  Being from the South, we are pretty much ketchup on fries only people.  I was flying through Chicago O'Hare Airport on my way to Cali and stopped in the McDonalds in the terminal.  I heard so many people ask for fries 'w/sauce'. My turn came, and I asked for the same.  I got that ketchup/mayo concoction and had NO idea what it was.  THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW IT WAS THAT SIMPLE!!  It is really good!  This is a lesson for all, something you may take for granted may be a great mystery to others, so take the time to share what you love!  Thanks again:).

This sauce has nothing to do with Utah. Fry sauce can be found in many other places. Add a little bit of mustard for tang.

I did not know that this is something people use as a french fry dipping sauce in Utah! At most restaurants my partner and I went to in Peru this is what was served with anything that was fried. It was always served with french fries and breaded calamari in the coastal restaurants we ate at. It's also really good mixed with a little lime juice.

I can't live without this stuff! Always a must at our barbeques. I have lived in the east where people haven't heard about it and made them love it too! I put a little mustard in mine. It gives it an even better flavor in my opinion.

I am also a Utah native and love fry sauce!  When we moved out of state, I started perfecting my sauce.  I do as keith, and use more mayo than ketchup, but I add a little bit of bbq sauce to add a little zip.  My husband has me add a little bit of the chinese chili sauce to his to make it spicy!  We don't eat fries without the sauce!  I'll have to try other reviewers suggestions that sound interesting.  I have tried lowfat and olive oil mayo, but I prefer the full fat stuff.  If I'm eating fries, I may as well go all out, right?

This recipe is a pretty standard recipe. Some alternatives are: Use your favorite BBQ sauce in place of the ketchup and follow the recipe as is. OR another way to make it great is to make the recipe as is listed and add about a tablespoon of soy sauce.

I've done this for years and everyone thought I was weird. Nice to know I've got a lot of "weird" company. Best stuff for fries!!!! Even better, use a good smoky BBQ sauce.

I miss living in Utah where this comes with your fries at any fast food restraunt! I love it with ketchup but especially with BBQ sauce, I believe it is then called "the ultimate dipping sauce".

You guys need to come to Utah a little more often. Fry sauce is everywhere here, and a few places inbetween on your way to California.  I can't stand ketchup, but fry sauce is amazing!

I've been making my own "fry sauce" for years in SC, but didn't know it had a name or that anyone else knew/loved it like my kids & I.  It is soooo
good, I like 2-1 (ketchup-mayo) ratio. Never tried w/bbq sauce, but I will soon, sounds good,too.

yup...you know you're in Utah when there's fry sauce at every hamburger joint that isn't a nationwide franchise!  Gotta love fry sauce! If you don't want so much, just remember 1 part mayo to two parts ketchup...or is it the other way around...just keep adding til it's a rather pink salmon color...then enjoy!!!!Warning:  it's addicting!

This is what I have been using since I was a kid. I also use it on fish as I don't like tarter sauce. You can add just about anything to it such as hot sauce or garlic. Super yummy any way you do it!!

If you want this to taste more like Artic Circle you have to add buttermilk. Our Article circle used to use this 'white sauce' (fry sauce before the catsup)…—Eva N

I'm originally from Idaho and fry sauce is a staple condiment!  I usually put a little dill relish in it to make it more tangy and the pickle pieces add a little flare.  There's nothing better than tater tots and fry sauce.  Brings me back to my childhood every time I eat it.  It's super good with finger steaks and burgers too.  (I usually 1/2 of each though in my mix).

Fry sauce just cracks me up! When I was in high school I moved from California to Idaho for a couple years. I had never heard of fry sauce in CA, but in Idaho they have it in the grocery stores bottled like regular ketchup and everything. It is good stuff!

It makes me laugh that people are so mystified by fry sauce. When we first moved here I had no idea what it was either, but now I see it everywhere. Simple recipe, but really good. A little lemon juice is a nice addition.

I've been making this for years and had no idea it actually had a name! I took others suggestions and added a bit of liquid smoke and more catsup. I used this on my hubby's ham, cheese and coleslaw sandwich and he loved the smokey taste. Thanks Keith!

I normally eat my fries plain and do not really care for ketchup but we had this with "Spicy Potato Wedges" (also from this site) and really enjoyed it.  I think this sauce would also be good on burgers.  The only difference I would make would be to use FF mayo to cut down on fat and calories.

I love this sauce, but you can't find it in Denver. So I've been making my own. I use fat-free mayonnaise and barbeque sauce instead of ketchup. It has more flavor. Whenever we eat out and order fries, I ask for a side of mayo & barbeque sauce and mix my own! I've had lots of people ask me what I was doing and when they tried it, they were hooked! (The Good Times hamburger chain in Colorado has something very similar called "wild dippin' sauce).

Great base recipe.  I like to add a tablespoon or 2 of BBQ sauce and a dash of hot sauce to really make this an AMAZING fry sauce.

This was a great recipe.  I did change the ratio a bit. I went with 1/2 & 1/2 with the mayo and ketchup. 
My family loved it. I grilled burgers and made some fries and they were dipping the burgers as well as the fries. They want the sauce whenever I do burgers and fries.

The recipe I used is slightly different but basically the same. My recipe uses 1/4 cup barbecue sauce and 1 cup of mayonnaise. This is the very best dipping sauce  ever. I rarely use ketchup for fries but I,ll use this sauce. Even my grandchildren like this.

I always make it with vinegar to taste because we like a bit of zing to it. We have it with fries but it also goes great with chicken nuggets.

I've been making this for 40 years to dress hamburgers but didn't know I was making 'fry' sauce! I add a little bit of mustard and the kids call it 'Moms Secret Sauce'. Loved by everyone.

My mother-in-law made this all the years I knew her. We met in 1979 and she passed in 2006. We use it for fries, onion rings, potatoe chips, raw veggies and even a salad dressing in a pinch. It is so very versatile!  Absolutely LOVE this simple recipe.

I've been making this fry sauce for many years and love it! In my version I add a teaspoon or so of Worcestershire sauce as well. I just taste test and add more if it needs it. Tastes like the fry sauce we get at Burger Ranch around here in Washington State.

I love fry sauce!  Usually I just eye it but I thought I would try a real recipe this time.  We do love BBQ sauce in ours and I didn't have enough ketchup so I used 1 part chili sauce, 1 part ketchup and 1 part BBQ sauce to = 1/3 c.  Was very yummy!  I know I veered away from the recipe but just thought I would let ya know it was yummy!

Wow, this sauce is awesome!
I have had ketchup and mayo on sandwiches/burgers before but never measured it to a T or anything. I decided I would only try half this recipe which made just enough for me alone. The only thing I did differently was use equal part of mayo and ketchup, which was a good idea because the mayo I used has a really strong taste but then the lovely ketchup flavour kicks in which makes this sauce deserving of five stars! I will be making this more often, that's for sure.

I'm from Utah and have fixed this sauce for many years. I've always added a tsp or two of fresh lemon juice and some worcestershire sauce. Add a nice extra zing to it!  People in the rest of the country just don't know what they're missing!

I've been making this since middle school when we were only allowed 1 ketchup packet...my version is a little more 50/50.  I used it on fries, chicken, onion rings, burgers, and much more.  In high school I used to dip the cafeteria's flavorless cheese pizza in it...amazing!

Good fry sauce recipe.  I think it needs spiced up a little but I'm not sure what the answer is.  I added a little seasoning salt and that seemed to help. 

I added A1 to one batch.  There were mixed feelings on that.  Some liked it with the A1 added and others did not.  If you do decide to add A1, I would recommend using it sparingly.

I got a hankering for fries so I baked up a batch of frozen shoestrings & gave this fry sauce a try. Yummm! I did as suggested by JAZZYMADDY & added a little A1 sauce. Better than ketchup!

Oh my gosh! My husband and I have been *doing* this since we were teenagers!! What a hoot to see it listed as an actual recipe! Let me tell y'all ~ it just doesn't get any better than this!! Ketchup and Mayo mixed is a MUST on your french fries! Spotting this recipe just totally made my day!

This is a sauce that I've had since I was a kid. My mom always served this with fish sticks or fried shrimp.  It's still one of my comfort foods.  The only addition is that of a few splashes of Tabasco or some cayenne pepper.
