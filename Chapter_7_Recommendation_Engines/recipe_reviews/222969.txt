Excellent flavor, not very attractive. Bit of advice, I have a similar recipe that is made in a 9 X 13 pan with the additions of nuts on the bottom, if you make this, it must be made very late at night or when u get up to cook them they will have risen to much. The pudding makes these like a caramel sticky bun. Mine does not call for any milk, but the finished product is almost identical. I made mine early afternoon for a bed time snack. I should have got them in the oven about an hr earlier. Very easy to put together, thanks for sharing, it was great!

I left this recipe for by husband to make, if it was me making it I would have known from the beginning that there would be issues. As the bread rises all of the dry cinnamon, sugar, and pudding mix falls out of the pan. Then the instructions tell you to pour milk on top, which is not an easy task and only caused the dry mix to fall out again. 
Despite all of the preparation issues we proceeded to cook the bread and thank goodness we placed it on top of a cookie sheet because none of the bread stayed inside the pan. It was a mess!
I have made monkey bread before with other recipes and never had this issue. When it is edible, it is delicious!

Tasty and easy but you definitely need some additional guidance on prep - you really need to spray or oil/flour the pan before adding the frozen rolls. I like this recipe since it calls for cook and serve pudding much tastier than instant and the yeast rolls are so much better than using tube biscuits. If you use butter instead of margarine it will burn so margarine is best. Once you add the rolls put plastic wrap on top and keep the pan on top of a larger plate or pan since the rolls do rise quite a bit and have potential to overflow a bit taking some of the ingredients with it. After it has risen you'll probably have to punch it down a bit before adding the milk otherwise it will go all over the counter and then your oven.

Just as good as my step-mom makes it. I put mine in a large pan (a bit larger than a 9x13). I keep the rolls right in the center of the dish. Then I flip it onto the bottom part of a broiler pan and scrape out all the good part. I found it's best to use fresh rolls.

I give this five stars for a combination of ease, texture and taste. I kind of can't believe I slaved over scratch cinnamon rolls for so long. No more. And, this recipe is easy to adapt to family favorite preferences. Add toasted, chopped pecans to the pan before frozen rolls for a pecan sticky bun, sprinkle a few cinnamon bits among the rolls for more flavor inside. Mess with it however you like, you're still going to get a reliably good result. I'm in on this one!

the bread vs the caramel didn't even out.  too much bread. The edges were good.  I made it EXACTLY like it said. Made it in my silicon pan and all 36 frozen rolls fit...now overnight is different for everyone..i happen to sleep 6 hours..it was perfect. They were fine. I like the monkey bread recipe with the biscuits cut in fourths...rolled in cinnamon and sugar..put in pan and then butter, brown sugar and milk is boiled and poured over and baked...the cinnamon/sugar flavor is more even and the caramel flavor it that great home made taste. The problem is I don't like the taste of the canned biscuits.I think the butterscotch pudding didn't come close. I am going to try my recipe with the cut up bread dough and I am thinking it will be the perfect monkey bread. thanks for the recipe,  we ate it all....

This was yummy, but when I left it to rise, it went over the top of my bundt pan.  I turned it out onto a plate, then turned it back into a 9 x 13 pan, hoping that it would bake, even though it was now flat.  I let it set to see if it would rise again, and it did, so I went ahead and baked it.  Even though it looked a mess, it was tasty!  Oh, and I added a handful of chopped nuts before I poured the milk.  I gave it four stars because of the hassle of re-panning it.  Because I have two bundt pans, next time I will divide the rolls and make two.  Hopefully that will help.  The first time I made this recipe was a disaster, the bottom of my stove was burned with the sugary stuff that oozed out.  Maybe the third time I make it will be the charm! :-)

This is the first recipe i ever used for monkey bread several years ago.  Recently found it again. This is the best ever.
