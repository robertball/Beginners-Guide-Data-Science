7.27.19 I mix up something similar to this all year long but fresh thyme is a new addition for me and I liked it. So very quick and easy to make early in the day and then one less thing to fuss with when making for evening dinner.

Delicious and healthy dish for anytime! I did half red wine vinegar and half balsamic. I may try all balsamic another time as I like it's smoothness and it seems less pungent. I did add a few tsps of sugar to cut the acidity. I was happy to have fresh basil and parsley on hand so I used that and skipped the thyme. Extra garlic of course. A great recipe especially in the summer when the quality of the tomatoes is so much better.

Wonderful recipe!  I used the different colored grape tomatoes as seen in Lutzflcat photo and cut them in half.  Plus I added fresh basil and parsley.  Not only was this tasty, but it made a great presentation for recent guest.  Next time I might add a tad bit of sugar as one reviewer suggested.  My red wine vinegar, I thought, was a bit strong.  Thanks so much for this recipe!
