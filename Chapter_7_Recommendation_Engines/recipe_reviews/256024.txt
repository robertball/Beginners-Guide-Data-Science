Great recipe! I had a couple of chicken breasts that I needed to cook so I boiled them in the stock for 20 mins then and shredded it. I added squash, onions and cream cheese directly into my sauce pan and used an immersion blender to combine. Added the shredded chicken at the end and served with a crunchy loaf of French bread. An excellent fall meal :)

Only change I made was I used 1/4 tsp cayenne. And I just poured it all together and used my immersion blender. Absolutely delicious, creamy and velvety and mine still had quite the kick. This is definitely going in my cookbook.

Was a little thin for me - I prefer a thicker soup although the flavor was good.  Great way to use leftover buttercup squash from the garden but next time will 1/2 the amount of chicken broth.

An immersion  blender makes this recipe much easier.  The cayenne pepper addition was a bit much - not because I avoid hot/spicy food (the opposite, actually), just throws the dish out of balance.  I would add about half as much cayenne.  Everything else was great.

Made this soup from our backyard buttercup squash.  We followed the recipe and turned out marvelous.  It was off the chart good that we shared it with our neighbor.  What a great soup in the cold weather.

The only thing I changed was the addition of 1 tsp of zatar seasoning. Soup was loved by family and friends. Will definitely become one of my go to soup recipes

This smells and tastes amazing! It was my first time making squash soup, and this recipe didn't disappoint! Other reviewers have said it could be thicker, and I agree. I think it might be best to begin with 3 cups of broth and then add more if needed. I'm sure it all depends on the size of the squash you're working with, too.

Really really good.  I thought for sure this was going to be runny but my squash was massive.  I doubled the cayenne only because I can ??. I made this for fun but now it’s for dinner.  I will make this again for sure.

This soup was so rich and delicious!  I had two small squash so I used it all. I didn’t have marjoram so I used sage and basil. My teen (who doesn’t like soup or vegetables) loved it so much I made it again with butternut squash and it was really good as well.

This was good and I will make it again but,   If you have a good fresh squash you don't need the cayenne pepper.  My wife bitched me out that I added that to a dish that didn't need it.  It's about the squash.

We grow buttercup squash every year and this is a favorite we looked forward to enjoying.  Very easy to make, the only time consuming part is baking the squash and letting it cool but so worth it.  All other ingredients I bet are already in your pantry or refrigerator.

Made a few changes, added smoked salmon diced up, pinch of rosemary, pinch of sugar, pinch of salt, pinch of garlic, extra butter,  Use one less cup broth for thicker soup. Garnished with fresh green onion, fresh Parmesan. The smoked salmon knocked it out of the park. Best soup I have ever had!!!!!

I forgot to grab cream cheese for this recipe when I was buying the ingredients, so I swirled in a little heavy cream just before serving.  This soup is divine!  I'll bet it's even better with cream cheese!!

I added 1 extra onion and used oregano instead of marjoram and didn't add the cream cheese - it turned out amazing. I will make it again.

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have any cayenne on hand so I substituted red pepper flakes and added them to the blender squash mixture instead of the broth.  I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this at least 10 times &
it's perfect as written, my young daughter agrees. you can amp up the spice if you wish with more cayenne. I use homemade chicken bone broth but have also made with "better than bouillon" chicken base.  I've used pumpkin but I love it with butterCup squash.  thank you for sharing this,  it's a favorite & perfect as written!

Love love love this soup!  Perfect.  Made exactly as written, minus the cayenne the first time.  I've made it vegetarian (veggie broth, dairy butter & cream cheese) and vegan (veggie broth, vegan butter, vegan cream cheese).  Served it as part of a Thanksgiving meal that included meat eaters, vegetarians & vegans - had several ask for the recipe.  The only thing I do is make it a one pot soup.  I saute the onions & butter, then add the broth right to that & the squash.  I use my immersion blender till smooth, then add the cream cheese & blend some more.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!

So delicious.  Made with buttercup squash (yum) and used fresh thyme, as suggested as a change.  Might use a little more spices next time.

I'd make this again!

We used shallots and thyme in place of onion and marjoram, turned out great and would probably do well with crisp maple or brown sugar bacon crumbled  on top. Delicious and flexible.

Decided to try this since we had a buttercup squash we received from a food bank, and it was delicious! I didn't have chicken stock on hand, so I used the beef stock I had and it still turned out wonderful. I also used just 1/4 TSP of cayenne pepper (my children hate anything "spicy"), and it had the perfect amount of heat. This is definitely going into the recipe book for another occasion!

Super easy and flexible, I used Butternut squash. Great flavor, if you're not a veggie person (like me) this is a great way to become one.

Great soup loved the flavor. I substituted the marjoram with thyme and used half of a red onion for the whole yellow onion. It was great!

Great way to get away from cream while maximizing flavor. I used franks cayenne seasoning (it's a powder) because i had no cay.pep on hand. Turned out great
