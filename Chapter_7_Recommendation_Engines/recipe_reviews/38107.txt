Although good, I had to make some modifications to the dish (thank goodness I read the reviews first!).  First, I used only  half of the cayenne pepper called for and 1/4 tsp of salt (thought that was still almost too much considering other additions that I made).  I added 1.5 tsp of Old Bay, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp of creole seasoning, 1 dash of seasoned salt, 1/2 tsp of Blackened Seasoning, and 2 tsp onion powder.  I used olive oil to coat the fillets instead of butter and used just enough italian dressing to lightly coat the fillets (maybe a teaspoon for each fillet, it helps to keep the fish from drying out.)

Make sure that you open the windows during the blackening process, as stated in earlier reviews!  Even the dog left me in the kitchen when the smoke got thick!

I served it on top of some old-fashioned dirty rice, and my boyfriend really enjoyed it.  He had the rest for lunch and it was even hotter the next day!  He claimed that he had to sit on a wet towel to cool off!

Overall, the recipe is a great starting point for blackened catfish.

This was a fantastic recipe, but fairly spicy, and I even decreased the amount of cayenne pepper by 1/2 teaspoon. If you can't handle really spicy food, I'd suggest using about 3/4 teaspoon total cayenne pepper. After reading reviews, I also only used a dash of salt and black pepper instead of the full amount called for, and seared the fillets in olive oil instead of butter. NOTE: Make sure that when you do the blackening part, you do it in a well ventilated area. There is a lot of smoke and strong vapors from the pepper, so be careful.

I served this with corn on the cob, hush puppies, and honey roasted red potatoes (recipe found on this site). Absolutely delicious, will definitely be making this one again. Thanks!

My husband does not like fish, but he cleans his plate every time I make this!  I have tried this with several other kinds of fish (cod, tilapia), but the catfish tastes the best.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I never have lemon pepper, so I squeeze fresh lemon over the filets.  I also brush the filets with dijon mustard after I coat them with salad dressing.  It adds a delicious zing.  Also, if you don't like things really spicy, you can cut the cayenne pepper in half and just use a little more garlic powder to make up for it.  I usually serve this with a tossed salad and some Zatarin's jumbalaya rice with diced kielbasa.

This is my first try at blackened anything.  I had a bad experience years ago when it first became popular but I had a taste of my niece's at a restaurant lately and have been wanting to have more ever since.  I used Zatarins Blackened Seasoning and added the garlic powder.  I also used the fresh lemon juice.  I used a combo of olive oil and butter to sear the fillets and didn't use the salad dressing at all.  It made a delicious sauce as it baked and it only needed 15 minutes to bake.  They were almost done after the hot searing.  I served it over plain rice with steamed carrots on the side.  My husband who is picky about seafood loved it.  Thanks a lot for the recipe.

I figured this recipe could use a review that wasn't written almost 10 years ago, so here it goes.

I made minimal modifications and it turned out amazing. First, I only used 1 tsp of salt and it was plenty. Also, if you don't like spicy that much, only use 1 tsp of cayenne. I love spicy stuff, and this recipe had my ears burning and my nose sniffling.

USE THE ITALIAN DRESSING. I almost didn't, but I was glad I did. Like another user said, the dressing mellows out some of the saltiness. If you're worried your fish is going to be too salty after trying a bit after searing, chances are after using the dressing, it will be fine. Also, I only drizzled some over the fish. 1 cup is way too much.

DO NOT BAKE FOR 30 MINUTES. I only baked for 15 and it came out perfect. It was juicy, tender, and flaky but not dried out. For a side, I fried some green beans in the same skillet that I used for the fish. 

I had a lemon that I needed to use so I squeezed some juice onto both the green beans and the fish and it added a nice, fresh zing. My boyfriend and I both loved it. Make this!

Wonderful!  The only modification I would make is only to add only 1 tsp of salt.  Also, I saw one reviewer below that made a comment of this being too salty, but she used garlic salt - make sure to use garlic "powder". We like it spicy, so the spice was perfect.

I read the reviews prior to using this recipe. On previous attempts I used the spice sold by that famous New Orleans chef for blackened fish but found it blah.
I followed this recipe to the letter on Halibut (I couldn’t get catfish) and found it absolutely excellent. So simple but the combination of spices brought out the beautiful spicy flavor associated with blackened fish. Don’t change a thing. Use as directed!

This is one spicy dish, but we love spicy food, so that was fine.  Well, at least I love it, and Jeanne puts up with it.
First, I think for one pound of fish, you could cut the spices in half, one teaspoon of each should be plenty.  I use two, and had a lot left over, and I really coated the fish.  Second, as someone else mentioned, watch out for the fumes when frying.  Open the windows, and turn on the exhust fan, you are going to need it.
The secret to this recipe is of course the Italian dressing.  It seems to take away some of the heat, but still leaves a nice bite and great flavor.  I will be doing this one again, perhaps with a differant fish next time.

Simple and could be tasty - but WAY TOO MUCH SALT!
If I make again, I will eliminate the 2 teaspoons salt, since lemon pepper and the dressing is already salty.  Also, 1 cup of Italian dressing is wasteful, I believe a simple drizzle over the fillets would suffice.

This is very good but it is wowy spicy and we love spicy/hot but was almost too hot for us. When I make again I will not change the spice mixture but will instead only rub in about 1 tsp per fish fillet and that will prob be enough. Overall very good but you gotta love hot!

This recipe was really excellent but I think it was way to salty and a bit spicy for the wife.  Next time I will cut way back on the salt,  maybe just 1/2 tsp and add more at the table if needed.  I cought some river cats and filleted them, soaked them in buttermilk for 2 hours then did the recipe just as directed.  I dont think you need to go 30 minutes in the oven though, just long enought to get the dressing hot.   We served the fillets over a bed of lettuce and I am so glad to find a great way to do catfish other than frying.    Ive been snacking on the leftovers today right out of the fridge and there great.  I think next time I will make a poboy with this recip dressed with tomato and lettuce.  Way to go Barlow!

This was a great recipe. I thought it would be very salty but it wasn't. Also I didn't have any cayanne pepper so I used chili powder and this worked great. Would diffently try again.

I usually read the reviews but was in a hurry.  Wish I had! lol It was okay.  Next time I'll use less salt, two teaspoons was definitely too much.  Other than that, it turned out well.

I used 2 lbs of catfish and cut the spices in half and it turned out PERFECTLY! In other words, I used 1/4 the spices the recipe calls for and it turned out wonderfully. I did this because so many of the other reviewers said it turned out too spicy and/or salty. By doubling the fish and cutting the spices in half, that problem was eliminated. Other important changes made were: I used olive oil instead of butter to brush onto the fish, instead of lemon pepper, I used the juice of one fresh lime (I squeezed the lime juice on it AFTER I had blackened it and placed it in my pan right before pouring on the salad dressing) and finally, I used HALF the Italian dressing that the recipe called for (in other words, I used 1 cup of dressing for 2 lbs of catfish). The dressing I used was Wish Bone "Just 2 Good" Italian dressing (because it has 2 grams of fat). It was DELICIOUS. My husband made me promise to make this for him regularly. By the way, even though I doubled the recipe, my husband and I wiped our plates clean! I served it with a side of cooked veggies (used a bag of frozen veggies) and a fresh salad.

My fiance is from New Orleans so I'm constantly trying to find cajun recipes for him. His biggest complaint about most of the recipes I've tried (this 1 included) is that we all seem to assume "Cajun" means SPICY..which it does not, at least not HOT spicy..it's essentially "flavorful & blackened". I don't eat seafood & I can't tolerate anything more than mild spice so I've always stayed away from "Cajun" recipes but having been down there w/him a few times, he's right, there  IS a HUGE difference (I can actually eat many REAL Cajun recipes). If it's spicy it spicy, not Cajun. I won't use this recipe again for the reasons outlined but I imagine from his description that anyone who DOES like hot-n-spiciness would probably LOVE it, that's just not us. Enjoy if you do try it..won't know if ya don't!

I have made Blackened Catfish many times. Most recipes call for the major ingredient to be paprika. I would reduce the cayenne to at most 1/4 teaspoon and add paprika to make up the difference. See Blackened Seasoning Mix on this site.

I'll admit I haven't tried this recipe yet, but as soon as I saw that it says to pan fry the fillets for 2 minutes per side, then bake for another HALF HOUR I knew this recipe wasn't for me!

The fish would be dried out garbage after that much cooking time - I don't care how thick the fillets are.

Quite good.  I altered the recipe a bit, some from advice from other
reviewers and some from what I had on hand: I used 1.5 teaspoons of
cayenne (not 2) -- I like spicy food and this was about right for me (or
maybe slightly too much); I skipped the lemon pepper -- didn't have any; I
added some old bay seasoning because I had some on hand and it seemed
appropriate; I found that I didn't need all of the 2 tablespoons of butter
to brush the catfish well -- a nice fact that makes the recipe healthier;
I didn't have Italian dressing on hand so made some from olive oil, white
wine vinegar, and water and drizzled over the catfish -- I only poured a
quarter of a cup (not 1 cup) as that seemed to make make the catfish very
wet.  In retrospect, I should've used even less; the catfish turned out a
bit oily from the dressing.  Finally, I found I needed to bake the catfish
for 40 minutes to be done (not 30-35 minutes).

I tweaked the recipe by adding onion powder and reducing the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp. but it turned out delicious - a real winner at my house.

Delicious, but the cayenne pepper may be too much. Cut back a bit, and it'd be perfection.

This recipe is great! I gave it 4 stars because if made as is would be too salty and too spicy (unedible).  Luckily I had read the reviews and made alterations before preparing.  I did only a light sprinkle of salt on top of the fish (did not add it to the mixture) but next time I will leave it out all together.  The salt in the lemon pepper seasoning is plenty.  I used a tad more than half of the cayenne and it was perfect for us (we like spicy).  I also only did just drizzle of italian dessing and it came out great.  Another tip: Sear on a cast iron skillet so you can just put the whole thing in the oven afterwards. No extra dish to wash!

Too hot!!!! I give it 5 stars though because blackened Cajun fish is supposed to be hot. The fish was tender and I think people that like it very hot would enjoy this. I will have to try using maybe a quarter or less of the spice next time.

CAUTION-HEED VENTILATION WARNINGS!! Open windows and turn on vent hood before cooking to circulate air. The searing process releases strong pepper fumes that will overwhelm you if you are not careful. I crave super-spicy food but this recipe was too much heat for me. I love the blend of spices, just needed to tone it way down so I cut everything in half. Also added paprika, equal inmeasurement to the other spices. Seared in olive oil, without brushing with butter first, for healthier alternative. I strongly recommend using "Good Seasons" dry italian salad dressing packet following thir directions but using extra virgin olive oil for the veggie oil. This dressing is great on fish even without the blackening seasons. YUMMY!! Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out fantastic!  For 2 lbs of fish I took the other reviewers advice and cut down the spices to 1-1/2 t of each and it turned out restaurant quality!!  Yum.  Also took their advise on the smoke issue and used the outdoor grill to sear so that all the smoke stayed outside.  Will definitely be making this again soon.

Very good recipe! I can't even imagine 2tsp of cayenne, I did 1tsp and that was plenty spicy and I am not a light weight. I added some onion powder for a little boost. Served it with the Dill Sauce recipe here on AR.

I usually do not add salt, because my husband is not a big salt eater. I also cook this on my George Forman grill because I like it crispy on both sides.

I made it exactly as stated in the recipe and I have to give it 3 stars because of the salt.  2 tsp was a lot, and then to bake it in the italian dressing just made for a really salty meal!!  Next time I make it, I will omit the salt completely. EDIT- We made a second time (with half the salt!) and this time, we just left it on the pan and blackened it for about 10 min.  Did not do the oven with the dressing.  I thought it tasted even better this way!!  Warning - it is very spicy, but I love it this way!

Very tasty, the cayenne and pepper really penetrate the fish. I agree with most other people, use a lot less salt,  and half the cayenne pepper  Another suggestion.  I had a 1/2 pound catfish, and cooked it on 350 for 20 min, and it came out a little dry so I would check it after 15 to see how it is making out. I made this over brown rice, the italian dressing sauce that's left over flavored the rice beautifully.

This was excellent!  I only made a few slight changes, per the other reviews.  I used half the amount of cayenne (1 teaspoon instead of 2), omitted the salt (it definitely didn't need salt), and used olive oil instead of the Italian dressing.  The fish was really flavorful and moist and super easy to cook.  Mine only took 15 min in the oven though, on 350.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  I'll definitely be making it again.

I also halved the amount of pepper for this dish based on others' reviews, but my mouth was still burning!  I might reduce it just a little bit more next time.  I also did not have lemon pepper and instead dribbled some lemon juice on the fish before they went into the oven.  Based on another person's review, I also just dribbled the italian dressing on the fish right before putting them in the oven and left out the salt altogether.  It was quite tasty and relatively nutritious as compared to frying the fish.  I also might try olive oil instead of butter next time.

Omitted salt entirely and just drizzled with italian dressing (health/sodium reasons)...  Delicious!!  Will definitely make again!!

Update:  Have made this at least 15 times.  Soooooo good.  My 20 yr old son's favorite meal.  Always serve with buttered noodles with parm and garlic green beans.  This IS my cajun seasoning for everything!

Really tasty! I omitted the salt and cayenne (my husband doesn't tolerate spicy) and added 1 teaspoon of paprika. Also, I drizzled the italian dressing (as per other reviewers).  My 10 and 11 year olds thought it was "AMAZING"! I thought it was really moist and tasty and I'm so glad that I didn't add that salt.

TOO SALTY! This dish tasted good and was easy, but man was it salty. We actually already halved the salt and used 2 tsp for 2 lbs of catfish, and it still tasted extremely salty. I would either cut out salt next time since the other spices already give it plenty of flavor, or use 1/4 tsp per pound of catfish.

I was at the new Sprouts Market in my neighborhood and they had some fresh catfish. I am trying to eat more fish, so thought I would try it. They guy at the meat counter said it was good. I thought I would try this one as I was concerned that the fish might be too strong. I modified it a little bit, but it is still HOT!. I do like hot though. When I added a little lemon juice it took away some of the hot. 
I read several of the reviews and added less seasoning and no salt. I used 1/2 of the pepper, cayenne, and garlic powder. I did not have lemon pepper, so I used the zest of a lemon and mixed that in the mixture. Instead of using butter, I used a spritzer and sprayed olive oil on both sides, then put on the rub. I put a little olive oil in the pan too prior to blackening. I then put it in the pan and put Italian dressing on both sides. I had some type of light wishbone Italian I like. I did not use a whole cup, I just put some on the top and bottom and baked for 30 minutes. It was really good. I can't remember the last time I had catfish, probably a really, really long time, but it was good, easy, fast and I will make it again. I just ate it with some plan brown rice, slice of trader joes sprouted wheat bread and some frozen french green beans I got at Trader Joes cooked in the microwave. Turned out to be good. There was one filet that I cut into two sections. I ate it all, but it was a lot. Try it, you will like it even if you are a little cautious about fish.

This fish was soooooooo delicious! It was flaky and the italian dressing gave it great flavor! As with some of the other reviewers, I made some minor modifications. I cut back on the cayenne pepper (I used 1/8 tsp), the salt (I used 1/2 tsp), the black pepper(I used 1/2 tsp), and the italian dressing. I didn't quite use the full 1 cup. But, since the sauce was so good, I'll be sure to use all of it the next time I make this dish! I also used olive oil instead of butter to blacken the fillets. Overall, this recipe gets an A+ from me! I'm sharing it with all of my friends!

This was a really good catfish recipe. I thought it would be a good one to try as I have never done a blackened fish before and it looked like a simple enough recipe. I recommend opening the windows and turning on the fan during the initial blackening process, as I managed to smoke up my entire house. Oh well, I guess that comes with the territory, being my first time and all. As for the fish itself, I really liked the flavor, but next time I make this recipe, I'm going to cut the salt in half as it was just a but too salty for my taste.

Even though I had difficulty eating this dish (I cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half and everyone's mouths were still on fire), the catfish had such a wonderful flavor to it! I'll definately try making this dish again (maybe with a little less pepper)

My husband said, "you're going to make this again, aren't you?"  We both enjoyed it.  The only change I made was using olive oil instead of butter.  We like things hot, but I think 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne would be a little more palatable -it would still be hot. If you don't like your tongue to burn definitely cut it to 1 teaspoon.  I would suggest serving this fish with something cooling.  I served it with Oriental Sesame Slaw and  fresh cut up fruit and it was a great combination.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was surprisingly good. I like things spicy, and this was just about as hot as I can eat and still enjoy the flavor. Per other reviews I cut the salt down to 1/4 of the original amount listed (probably could omit it completely). Instead of salad dressing I used 1/2 tbsp canola oil mixed with 1/8 tsp Italian seasoning for each fillet. Also, 30-35 minutes would be WAY too long a cooking time, especially if you have thin fillets and/or cut down the recipe. I used a single 1/2" thick fillet and only needed to cook for 10 minutes. This went well with candied sweet potatoes, but would be wonderful served with applesauce too.

Way, way, way too salty.  At first I had to check and make sure I had garlic powder instead of garlic salt, but I had the right one.  Leave the salt out!  I can't express this enough.  I liked everything else about this dish, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of one.  The cooking time was fine and I could just taste how good the other spices would've been without all the salt.  I'll make this again, but with no salt.

I used half of cayenne paper as other reviews suggested, but it was still too spicy for me. My husband loved it. It is easy to make and fun to eat. Next time I would put half of the salt.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and I did not like it at all.  The only thing keeping me from giving it 1 star is that the hubby liked it enough to eat most of his fillet.  I'm from South Louisiana, grew up eating cajun food, and something about this just wasn't right.  I think it was the italian dressing, but if I make this again I'll use 1tsp of all the spices and possibly substitute Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning for the cayenne pepper (and of course, figure out something else to use in place of the italian dressing).

I was nervous to try this recipe as I have never done anything blackened.  It was wonderful, juicy, and flavorful.  I followed the recipe with only the following little changes.  I added onion powder to the seasoning and some EVOO to my cast iron skillet to blacken the fish.  I did not use the whole cup on italian dressing, but enough to cover the fillets.  I served it with baked potato, steamed spinach, and a salad.  My husband, who was weary of catfish, said it was great.  I think the spicy level was just right.  Taste your rub before hand so you know if it needs more or less.  And like others said, open the window and prepare for smoke.  I may try it with coconut oil next time as it can get hotter without the smoke.

This recipe was delicious, but I did make some modifications.  I had to make up 2 cayenne pepper mixtures because my cat fish were big.  Sprinkle cayenne pepper, no salt, dash of pepper, use olive oil instead of butter, sprinkle both sides of fish (after rubbing olive oil on) with Creole Seasoning, drizzle Italian Dressing & squeezed fresh lemon juice on fish when done baking.   Very moist!

I have never cooked any fish of any kind before. This was the most delicious and easiest recipe I have ever tried! Mouth watering! The local store here in Texas (Kroger) have Catfish fillets on sale this week and I went back and bought more! I will most certainly share this recipe with all my friends! Thank you Barlow who ever you are. Five stars!

Wow this recipe was fantastic!! I did i exactly as instructed (only cooked in the pan a little bit longer to blacken) and my husband was complimenting me all evening on how good it tasted! It is a bit too spicy for young children so I'd recommend setting some aside and only rubbing the seasoning on very very lightly for kids. But for anyone who enjoys a good spicy meal that makes you keep tissues near, this is the best!!!

I cut back on the cayenne and salt and still had some spice mix leftover.  Also used 1/2 cup of the dressing and no butter.  Easy weeknight recipe with a kick.  Thanks for sharing!

I love spicy food and this is wonderful. Great spicy flavor to it.  The only thing I would suggest is using 1/2 of what it calls for on the Itailan dressing or just omiting it all together.

Holy sinus clearing spices! So, I didn't read the reviews before making this. however, my husband loves spicey and it was actually really good, just a bit heavy on the cayenne. :) I will reduce the cayenne a bit next time but this is easy and delicious!

Easy recipe that gives a ton of flavor to broing fish. I only use 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper so my children can also eat this.

I cut the cayenne in 1/2 and added a cajun spice I had not used yet. I did not have the salad dressing so stirred lime juice into the spices at the bowl bottom and poured that over the fish. I also Just put some butter in the pan to sear with instead of brushing the butter on the sides. I also just heated everything back up in my electric skillet to serve instead of doing oven. Saved a pan and having to deal with oven. Very tasty.

Great recipe!  All I changed was using 1/2 of the cayenne and 1/2 the salt, olive oil instead of butter, and just poured a little bit of dressing on each fillet.  Very good and will make again!

OK, being from the great white north where we don't eat catfish on purpose, I was skeptical that I'd even like this recipe. My southern born and bred boyfriend and I rarely agree on food and the normal "fried in cornmeal" southern channel cat recipes don't appeal to me at all, but wel all like cajun type stuff, so when my son brought 15 catfish filets home from his fishing trip last weekend, I gave this a go. It was AWESOME! Spicy and tender and flaky. Fifteen filets, two teenagers, one good ol southern country boy, one displaced yankee, zero leftovers. 'Nuff said!

Barbeque version...I love catfish and i love spicy, and this recipe is extra spicy.  No salt is needed, and my experience has been to never use as much lemon pepper as any recipe states.  Cut back on the black pepper as well.  Get grill on b'bque very hot before blackening, then wrap fillets in a foil packet with dressing on top and bottom.  Grill/steam on low heat for approx 20 minutes.  This fish is so moist and so spicy, and by using the outdoor grill you keep your smoke detectors from going off.  This is a great addition to my recipe box!!!

Wow, people were not joking about the smoke. I needed a dust mask just to breathe while blackening!!! It was ridiculous. Used catfish nuggets, doubled the recipe except only used 1 tsp. of cayenne - it still had plenty of kick! Did not have lemon pepper so substituted equal parts pre-mixed Cajun spice. That might have had something to do with the super kick;next time I would use even less of the cayenne (like less than 1/2 tsp. for a double batch.) Doubling the spice mix, I did not have enough to coat 2 lbs. of nuggets. My nuggets were also slightly frozen still, so needed longer than 35 minutes for baking time. Flavor was good & they came out moist!

This was delicious. Even my 7-year old son asked for seconds. I omitted both the salt and the cayenne pepper and added a little blackened seasoning. I think the salt in the itialian dressing made up for this omission perfectly. Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely prepare catfish using this method from now on.

Everyone who tasted this HATED the blackening seasoning.  Yuck!  It was too strong, and the cayenne pepper overpowered the fish.  I'd never make this again.

I used fresh lemon juice (half a lemon) mixed with the melted butter (no lemon pepper). My kids don't like HOT so I prepared theirs without cayenne, then added it to make mine. As per other reviews I drizzled the italian dressing on-it did not take 1 whole cup. This is about a 7 out of 10 hottness if you use the recipe as is. I chose to serve this with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Kickin Collard Greens! The meal altogether is heaven, just heaven. The kids love this one! Great leftover too.

This was good! I never follow recipes exactly, though, so there were a few changes made to the original. I used a tad more garlic powder (we love garlic here), and cut down on the cayenne. I also added blackened seasoning and old bay to make up for lack of cayenne. It turned out great.

Excellent recipe, great flavor! I used olive oil spray instead of butter, and just enough light Italian dressing to cover the fish before baking, and served on a bun. Served with some dirty rice, will definitely make this again. Yum!

Tasty although a bit salty. I thought I was going to die of smoke inhalation during the blackening in the pan though. Make sure you put the stove fan on.

I have tried this twice -- the first time, I used 1 tsp of everything instead of 2 (but I also just had 2 filets, so that seemed to be about right) but it was WAY too salty and spicy for us. I tried it a second time with just a half tsp of everything, and it was much better. It's a great flavor, but very over-powering if you follow it as it is. Just beware! :)

I thought it was a pretty good recipe, but some of the salt needs to go. There's the salt, the cayenne which is salty, and the garlic salt. I'll just have to ratchet some of that down the next time I make it, but I could definitely taste the goodness in there.

I used talapia with this recipe. Was very good. I suggest if you're going to blacken anything, to have a WELL ventelated kitchen. I do not. I was coughing like crazy while frying the fish. Also, I since I used talapia, I didn't need to bake it as long. Only about 10 minutes.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe.  It was very very spicy though and I had to drink two glasses of cola for one pretty nice size filet.  I only used 1 teaspoon of salt and about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the pepper.  I will maybe cut down on the cayenne a little next time...maybe just one teaspoon and substitute a teaspoon of paprika for the second...but other than that I will leave it the same.  I served this fish with spinach cooked in bacon grease and northern beans...yum.

very good and easy. I like spicy but will probably cut back on this one next time or only season one side of the fish.  Delicious!

Good recipe for fish!!  If you're sensitive to spicy I would cut the cayenne from 2 teaspoons down to 1/4 teaspoon.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half and it was still too much for me.  Otherwise - good.

We loved this recipe.  I already had the Tony Chachere spice and herb seasoning which is great for blackening so I used that instead of the seperate seasonings.  It was very flavorful. I'll definitely prepare this again.

Wow! This recipe was so easy. This is definitely the quickest dinner prep out there. Took about 5-10 minutes to throw the ingredients together for the rub. The taste was increduble. One of my top five!!! Don't change a thing.

Wow. I actually read through all of the hints and everyone seems to have a different flavor. So we decided to try the recipe in the original form and absolutely LOVED IT!!! It had kick, it had a taste that lasted after the last piece was eaten. Very good, very simple, and will definitely make when company comes over. The dog had trouble eating it, but it sure was funny to see her try.

I made this last night and it was a huge hit with my husband who claimed he didn't like catfish when I told him that's what we were having for dinner. I did cut the cayenne, salt and pepper back to 1tsp and and used olive oil instead of butter and hubby insists that next time I make it to "not change a thing". It definitely is spicy but that's what you should expect when it is "blackened". Another recipe for the rotation!

We love this recipe.  Easy, spicy, flavorful.  I have also made it with tilapia with great results.  I usually have to make more of the spice mixture while I'm coating the fish.  I have it at least twice a month. Parents and friends have raved.  Definitely try it!

This is hot as Hades, but it's absolutely delicious!!  Even if you really enjoy spicy food, you may find it a little too much...so go lightly on the seasonings the first time until you determine just how much 'heat' you can take.  I agree with a previous reviewer about the amount of Italian dressing.  Although I always double or triple the rest of the recipe, 1 cup of dressing is more than ample.

Excellant!  It's nice to have a catfish recipe that doesn't require breading and frying. We like spicy but I only used one teaspoon of ceyanne and it was plenty.  Took longer to cook in my oven but we will definitely make again.

This recipe was excellent !!!!!  I LOVE spicy food, although my fiancee cannot always take it as spicy as me, so I decreased the cayenne pepper to only 1 teaspoon.  My fiance loved his meal, he just couldn't get enough !!!!
Thanks

This was excellent, although you must like hot food.  I did cut back on the salt. No salt when i prepared the rice, and cut back to 1 teaspoon in the recipe.  Next time I will cut the peppers back a tad.  Very easy and quick.

Very good flavor! My kids can't eat spicy, so I used Old Bay seasoning, salt, pepper and garlic powder. All other directions are the same. The whole family really enjoyed this dish. Thank you for the recipe!

Thought it was great although I changed a lot.  I didn't have the lemon pepper or cayenne pepper, so I just subbed cajun seasoning. Also, omitted the salt and it was still plenty salty. Lastly, I only used about 1/3 cup of the Italian dressing.

This was tasty, very spicy even after I cut the cayenne in half. Definitely smokes up the kitchen, next time I'll probably try putting the cast iron skillet out on the grill to cook them.

Made this a few times, the base recipe is a 5 star, but I'm lazy so suggesting some 4 star changes:  2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp lemon grass powder, 2 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp chipotle chili powder, 3 tbsp lemon juice, butter to 0 and replace with olive oil.  Definately a good catfish recipe as judged by a south-east'er on it's stock recipe, just a bit more time consuming than i prefer.

It was a little too salty, but that may be partially due to misinterpretation of the recipe. I'm not sure if the lemon pepper is supposed to be lemon pepper seasoning or dried, ground lemon pepper (there is actually a pepper called lemon pepper)
 I used the lemon pepper seasoning, which contained salt, and that might have been the problem. But the recipe isn't terribly clear. Nevertheless, it was tasty.

Very yummy. My children ask for it every week. I tweaked the recipe slightly. For one pound recipe, I halved the spices and dressing. It was just too salty.

The blackened seasoning was good,but way too much on the italian dressing, could not get past the dressing flavor a bit much overtook the fish,  this may be good on chicken breast , but wont try it on fish again.

The variety of spices gives this catfish great taste; however, I do not recommend the strong spices for young children or sensitive stomaches.

My husband and I really enjoyed this spicy catfish. I did cut the salt to 1 teaspoon and that was enough.  Lessons learned:  Make sure the pan you fry in is good and hot before searing the fish.  I think you could cut back on the italian dressing as much of it just sits in the baking dish.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks  (UPDATE: I see people rating this recipe before they even try it (that's just weird!) because of the cooking time or spices - I've used this recipe for over a year and it is GREAT!  The fish does not dry out.  I did need to practice a few times to get the searing method correct. If you like blackened catfish - just try it - nice blend of spices.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Followed the directions as written, and found it a little too salty.  Also, did not add the full amount of italian dressing - just enough to coat the fillets.  Other reviewers were right...the peppery smoke that comes off of these when blackening is enough to give you a coughing fit, so ventilate well!  Will definitely make this again.

We really like spicy and this was too spicy for us.  Other than that it was fantastic! I used the Wishbone salad spritzer Caesar Delight to make it lower calorie and it worked deliciously. Great way to do catfish

A very good start. To much salt for my taste. I think I will leave out the italian dressing next time. I also substituted Mahi Mahi instead of catfish. Thanks for the recipes.

I usually make blackened catfish in a cast iron pan heated on the grill outdoors to avoid the sensation of being pepper sprayed.  Another alternative to serving this with rice is cheese grits.  I usually make fresh pico de gallo as a condiment as well, the freshness is a nice balance to the heat and cheese.

I make a very very altered version of this recipe, but it turns out fantastic!  Basically I thaw my catfish fillets, rinse, then cover with Cajun seasoning.  I fry them up in hot olive oil for ~2 mins/side.  Then, I cover with the Italian dressing and bake at 350 for 20 mins.  It's really good and simple!  Serve with green beans and lo-sodium dirty rice mix minus the ground beef.

This recipe is very flexible.  I was out of lemon pepper so I substituted with fresh lime juice (no kidding).  I was out of cayene pepper so I sustituted with a seafood seasoning.  I didn't want to put the butter so I used olive oil.  It was fantastic!  Kids and husband loved it.

This was delicious!  I used less than 1/2 a teaspoon of seasoned salt and regular salt, and added some paprika and onion powder.  I ran out of rub after coating the first piece of fish, so next time I will be sure to use more.  Definitely have all windows open and a fan going because it creates a lot of smoke.

WOWSA!  This was GOOOD! It was a bit too spicy for some of the family so next time I might do half without the cayenne - other than that it was awsome!

The only thing I did differently was to skip the baking step - I just poured the Italian dressing into the skillet to warm it through. Husband really enjoyed it but, man, did the frying stink up the house for the rest of the evening! Worth it though. Thanks!

This is delicious...I do agree with the adjustments in the other reviews, except I would never use olive oil or butter to blacken anything. They are not stable oils when used with high tempuratures. They can be used for saute at med-low temps, but never frying anything past med-low heat.

I've used this recipe a few times now, I keep coming back to it every once in a while.

I don't mind the amount of cayenne pepper in it, but everyone else in my house does, so I usually decrease it quite a bit and add some old bay seasoning instead.  I also decrease the amount of Italian dressing being used, depending on how big my fillets are.  Too much makes them soggy and not as flaky as I like.

To make things easier during the blackening part, I put the fish in a pan and use the propane BBQ out on the patio.  Keeps the house from stinking and the kid from complaining.

Tasty and simple recipe overall.

As a very new member of the cooking community I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  It's quick and very simple.  I grew up in a household that Never, ever made any type of seafood so this recipe was a big jump for me.  I only make this recipe for 1 with a 1/4lb of fish and use a generic lemon pepper seasoning, pepper and some garlic salt instead of the spicy cayenne seasoning.  I also use olive oil instead of butter and it tastes great.  I've tried the recipe with italian dressing added prior to baking and no dressing added and both taste amazing.  (Although the fish is a bit dry without the dressing.)  I serve over a bed of brown rice.  Sometimes with a side of Broccoli, sometimes with nothing.

Every one raved about it and my brothers wife who isnt the kitchen type even asked for the recipe.  if your kind of a spice woosy like myself go easy on the cayene pepper.

This was delicious! It was my first time making catfish, so I wanted something pretty easy. I have to agree with previous posters that it's a little too spicy (and I have NO problems with spicy food). I used about 1.5 teaspoons of cayenne and at first thought it was too much, but after thinking about it, I'm still undecided. I think two teaspoons would have definitely been too much. Not because it's too spicy, but because the flavor becomes too overwhelming and prevents you from really tasting any of the fish or other dishes on the plate. Other than the Cayenne, I followed the recipes exactly, except that I didn't have lemon pepper, so I just squeezed some lemon juice over it. It came out wonderful. I will definitely be making this again! But next time I will cut the salt to 1/4 tsp.

Very spicy when made as per directions but very good! I needed good ventilation and still I sneezed my way through the cooking and found that half the cayenne and pepper(depending on your lemonpepper seasoning) would have been good. (I must have had extremely peppery lemonpepper.) I will make again but I will sprinkle seasonings over the fish to control how much goes on the fish. I served with beans and rice...very good.

This was excellent!  I cut the salt in half as some reveiwers recommended and I'm glad I did.  I also had to cut the red pepper in half since some members of the family can't take the heat!  I happen to love salmon so I had purchased a big filet for myself instead of the catfish the rest of the family wanted.  I decided to prepare my salmon filet the same way I was doing to catfish just to make life easier.  OH MY GOSH!!  It was AMAZING!  Even better than the catfish.  I shared a few bites with the rest of the family and it was a HUGE hit!!  Thanks for a terrific way to prepare fish, Jeff!!

This recipe is good not only with catfish but also pike, lake trout, walleye.  I have tried them all and they were awesome.  The only thing I recommend is cut down on the cayenne.

This is great!  This was my first attempt at making fish.  I don't like fish - but catfish is very mild (not fishy) and this recipe is very flavorful.  I sear the fish in olive oil rather than butter and I eyeball the amount of cayenne pepper adding much less than the recipe calls for, also I use a fat free Italian dressing so I don't have a problem with it being oily and to make it a little healthier.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe!  It is one of our standards and easy to adjust for friends who don't like the spicy spice.   If you have someone who thinks it is too hot, I would recommend cutting the cayenee to 1/2 tsp.

I cooked this for some friends-the first time.  I was a little nervous but it was a hit-  they were looking for more.... It cooks fast so be sure that everything else is ready--best served right out of the oven

this fish dish is super easy to make.  i give it a 5, but be warned, it is THAT spicy.  Like others, next time i will reduce the cayenne amount and the salt amount.  Great over dirty rice and a side of asparagus.

This was really good - of course you need to adjust the spice level to your taste - a little cayenne goes a long way.  When you bake it with all that dressing it turns into a nice thick sauce that we really liked over rice and peas.

Delicious!!! I cut the black pepper in half. I used garlic salt instead of powder, and didn't use any salt at all.

I've never written a negative review but I had to on this recipe.  I "LOVE" spicy foods but this was so spicy that it burned our mouth "and" I cut the cayenne in half and left out the lemon pepper and used only 1/2 tsp salt. The spices were so over powering.  Sorry Jeff, love cajun but this is not a keeper.

Pretty good. Although it was too spicey and much too salty for me. Next time I will reduce the pepper and garlic salt and italian dressing by one half. Easy to prepare.

Way too much black pepper to be edible.  I think if the black pepper was reduced to 1/2 t., it would have tasted much better.  Very spicy with cayenne pepper; even with 1 teaspoon.

Yummy!  I ran across thie recipe this afternoon and made it tonight-easy and delish.  Like the others, I cut way back on the cayenne, and it was still spicy, which was great.  I also lightly greased my pan before frying.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This was ok but certainly not the best catfish I have had. I only used 1 tsp cayenne pepper (kept other seasoning same as recipe) and still thought it was a little spicy. I am from Louisiana so the spice didn't bother me but my husband thought it was definitely too hot. The flavor was good but not great. Not sure I will make this again.

wow, is this a tasty dish! i followed the recipe as written, searing the spiced catfish on a hot griddle over the grill. one pound of catfish gave us 2 nice fillets which worked out well since there's two of us. the portions would be kinda small to serve four people. regardless, try this if you're a fan of blackened fish! thank you jeff!

There was way too much salt, i dont know if somehow the measurements got messed up when i changed the servings but i would suggest only putting half the amount of salt and it would have been good.

This recipe is very, very good. I used a little less on the cayenne pepper to neutralize the heat, and used a .5 teaspoon. Probably the best catfish I have ever tasted. A crowd favorite around the house. If you like catfish, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!!

Very easy to make and tasty.  To make healthier I just sprayed the fillets with cooking spray instead of butter.  Definitely cut back on the cayenne (I used only a pinch).

HOMEY!!!  Thank God for reviews... This was a great recipe gone good. Even with the pepper reduced it was too hot.  And the skillit needed a little oil for the 'blakening' process.  The Italian dressing idea realy set this one apart.  I will make this one again, but try not to burn down the kitchen while 'blakening.'

This was truly wonderful!  I'm on the South Beach Diet so changed the butter to olive oil and decreased the amount of dressing.  Will definitely use this one again.

I don't even know how to cook (boiling water for pasta is about the extent of my knowledge) but I wanted to cook something for my girlfriend so I decided to give this a try and it came out perfect.  I hadn't had catfish since I was little and my girlfriend had never had it at all, and we both loved this dish.  I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper based on some reviewers saying it was too spicy, but we didn't think it was spicy enough so if we do it again, I'll put in the full amount.  I served it with white rice and Green Giant Mexicorn (has bits of pepper in it).

Wow!  Spicy!  This was pretty good, but my husband and I both agree to use less of the peppers and salt.  We love hot and salty stuff too.  I really enjoyed it half way through and then it started getting overwhelming.  I think that I will keep all the ingredients but play with it until I can find the right amount of eveything to suit our tastes.

I admit to trying this recipe with a little scepticism, not being entirely sure it would replicate the meals I'd eaten at restaurants. However, I followed the recipe closely and it turned out to be wonderful. I too halved the cayenne, which was by far spicy enough. But I can see a real spice lover enjoying the full quantity. If you have a cajun hankering and have half an hour to spare, this recipe is for you!

I used low fat butter spray and non-fat Italian dressing to make it a little healthier, and it tasted great!  It wasn't heavy and had a great flavor.  I would've eaten my boyfriend's piece too if he hadn't come home to claim it!

I used only half the cayene and had a ton of seasoning left after coating two large filets.  You can place the leftover seasoning mixture in a zip lock bag to reuse next time.  Spicy, tangy, and delicious!

This was way way too hot. I normally love really hot dishes, but it definately detracted from the overall taste (in fact, I couldnt taste for half an hour following the meal!).    Definately tone down the pepper used.  Or suffer the concequences.

This is a great recipe!!  We loved it.  I think the Italian dressing was the key.  Thanks for our new found favorite.

Terrific recipe!  Catfish turned out perfect - tasty & very moist.  I suppose the Italian dressing is the key.  Thanks!

Based on other reviews, we reduced the cayenne to 1 tsp but should have used only 1/2 tsp. Reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. Used about 2 Tbl Italian dressing per filet. Omitted the butter brushing olive oil on filets.
We followed the directions to only slightly blacken and thus avoided excess smoke. Baked these to perfection for 15 minutes.
Served over small squares of reheated polenta along with a side of sautéed spinach, onion and mushrooms.
We will definitely make these again.

Better with Cod fish (I don't like Catfish) and I used Greek salad dressing because we didn't have Italian and it was fantastic.  My kids like the Catfish made this way.

This came out nicely.  I am not a fan of catfish but bought several pounds on sale.  This recipe was good and corrected my own cooking problem of not cooking it long enough.  The blackening in a frying pan and finishing in the oven was perfect.

What can I say ..... the whole family loved it, half the batch I cooked as directed the other just half the cayenne and rubbed both sides with bacon fat instead of butter! Made street tacos and the meal was wiped out ...... thanks for the recipe and a great meal!

I lowered the cayenne and black pepper to 1 tsp. each.  I also upped the butter to 4 T.  I generously sprinkled the spices on the fish and added lemon slices after I drizzled the dressing.  I only baked it for about 17 minutes.  This was awesome! Perfect spice amount for us.  Thanks for sharing.

LOVED this.  The only changes were to cut down on cayenne as I knew 2 tsp would be way too much. I used only 1/2 tsp and it was perfect for my family. This is so easy and tastes like a restaurant meal. Thanks, IndianaBarlow for a wondferful way to eat catfish.

Amazing catfish just as the recipe states!  You might consider a little less  red pepper for the family members who can't handle the spice cause it's a little on the warm side!

I followed the instructions to a tee, and almost had to call the fire department.  The seasoning was good, but it was much too difficult to make.  I'll bake or sear the fish next time.  Blackening is NOT a process for me, based on these instructions!

The first time making the recipe, I made no changes and it was VERY spicy.  I like spicy things, but it was too much cayenne for us.  The second time making the recipe, I decreased the cayenne by 1/3, decreased the salt by 1/2 and just drizzled the Italian dressing over the fish instead of the full cup.  It was still spicy, but not overwhelming.  Good recipe with modifications and will be making again.

This was really really good. I followed the recipe except I cut the cayenne in half and I’m glad I did. The recipe made enough to cover 4 catfish fillets (2lbs) so that’s what I did. If you were to coat 1lb with all the ingredients it would be way too much. I also used unsalted butter because there was no need to add more salt. I used white rice and sprinkled in a dash of lemon pepper. This is a keeper for sure!

I love spicy, but this was a tad over the top. I did scale back the cayenne, as others noted, but also added Old Bay. I still thought this was truly for the brave of palate. We did this for a dry run for our first Pacific-Northwest Southern Fish Fry coming up and wanted an alternative to all the yummy cornmeal breading. (It's really hard to get catfish up here so we have to celebrate, just saying). I think we will still make this, as hubby and I cleaned our plate, we will just dial it back a bit more and may put a warning label on it. Thanks for sharing!

I used less than half the cayenne and salt (3/4 tsp each). I used honey mustard dressing as I had no Italian. DELICIOUS! However, some in my household still found it WAY too spicy.  I would absolutely make this again. Thanks!

I thought it was very tasty. I did not add any salt at all. The other flavors work well without it. I also melted the butter in the pan, and then pan fried instead of placing the butter on the fish first. The entire family enjoyed it.

Made this for my husband who doesn't really like catfish, and he loved it. I used half the cayenne, and next time will use half the salt because it was too salty, especially with the salad dressing on top. My catfish pieces were plenty thick so it took the maximum time in a convection oven. Easy and good. Will definitely make again.

So good but much too hot for me! Make this wonderful recipe BUT I would use half or less of the cayenne pepper. I end up using some in my salad (delicious with some much flavor), and will pair the remainder with rice!  I certainly will make it again  with less cayenne pepper!

I only made half of  what was suggested so I cut the ingredients in half. and you know what I really enjoyed it. I've been to New Orleans and I welcomed the spice. But for next time, I would reduce the amount of salt.

Very good! We don't enjoy spicy food in my family so decreased the cayenne to 1/4 tsp and the pepper to about the same. This was not spicy at all for my three fillets (~1.5 lbs total) and was still super delicious.

The addition of the Italian dressing was not a good idea. Using it to keep the fish from drying out isn't needed if the fish isn't cooked so long. 20 minutes at 350 degrees is long enough to cook through, especially when you get a good sear on the stove. The spice level is intense but expected when I read how much cayenne it called for. Doubt I will make this again but if I did, I would definitely omit the dressing.

Made exactly as the recipe stated, and it was amazing.  My husband, Mr. Picky, complained that I didn't make enough.  I had never made a "blackened" recipe before, and chose this one because it looked easy.  We are definitely having it again and again!  Served with Basmati rice (seasoned with lemon and cilantro).

Open the windows, not because of smoke, but because the cooking cayenne will burn your lungs. This recipe was great! If you use the packaged Italian dressing, don't use all the oil it calls for. I think next time I will double this, definitely good enough the leftovers won't be blah.

It was very good and so easy to make!  For those of you who don't particularly like spicy, I would the recommend adjusting the pepper as needed but otherwise was extremely successful!  I will definitely make this again!

This will be the 3rd summer living on the water, and 90% of what we catch is catfish, and all we've done is fry it. I went looking for a different way to cook the fish when I came across this recipe and it was delicious!!! We will definitely be using this recipe again!

This was excellent.. I used it for a fresh rockfish fillet caught 3 hours before. Substituted onion powder for the garlic powder, salmon blackening rub for the cayenne pepper. Go light on the Italian dressing; didn't want to drown the fish in it.

Followed recipe as written and have to say even though we like spicy food this was a little too spicy-hot for us.  It was very moist and cooked evenly, but I'd cut back a little on heat.  And be careful when blackening in pan as fumes from peppers can get to you.  Made me sneeze and cough, lol.  Still, it's a good recipe and was a nice change of pace for fish.

I skipped the salt and Italian dressing but it was still amazing. I also used Salmon as my grocery store didn't have catfish in. I love spicy food so this was perfect. It was crazy smokey when blackening though and with the seasonings on there my eyes started watering and my throat burned from the smoke lol. The man loved it too, which was a relief as this was my first attempt at cooking fish (which he LOVES). Definitely would recommend.

Yes, I halved the cayenne pepper, and was glad I did. There was still plenty of heat.  My husband absolutely loved it!  Easy to make and a great recipe are my perfect go to's.  Will be making this again for sure.

Everything was great but way too salty.  Next time I'm going without the salt.  However, very flavorable and easy to prepare.  Instead of butter, I used the olive oil from a spray can before the rub.

This is my first review and I felt it was definitely necessary. The recipe as written is a 2 which may be generous. I read the reviews and saw many said it was too salty but I like to do the exact recipe and make modifications on the next round. This one I should have listened... Way too salty not even sure it needs more than a sprinkle. Also, I don't understand why you use so much Italian dressing. I think a squirt or to would be enough or omit it altogether. If you don't overcook when blackening or when you put it in the oven it won't be dry. People tend to overcook fish. I ended up scraping all of the blackened skin coating off and that way I was able to eat it, it still had a nice flavor. The heat wasn't an issue for me. I served it over cheese grits and the combination was really good. Also, my grits weren't salty and I tried the fish before putting on the grits, so I know for a fact it was the fish alone.

Leave out the salt. It was incredibly salty with the salt. Even my husband (the amazing salt eater) complained that it was too salty. It would have gotten a 5 if it hadn't been so salty.

Delicious and so simple! I made this almost exactly as prepared, except that I (1) cut about half a teaspoon of the cayenne and substituted half a teaspoon of Creole seasoning, and (2) was out of Italian dressing so used olive oil instead. (In future I will probably use olive oil instead of the butter to coat the filets as well.) Came out absolutely perfect. It's a hot and spicy recipe, but that's exactly why I love it!

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was WAY to salty. I will be making this again but reducing the salt by at least half if not more. Other than that it was really tasty and spicy.

Delish but VERY hot. I even reduced the amound of cayenne. I'd recommend only using 1/2 teaspoon if you aren't into spicy foods. VERY good though.

The rubbed on mixture was awesome.  However, I found the Italian dressing just too much for the rest of the flavors.  I would make this recipe again just using the rub and forget the dressing.

Excelent catfish!!! I tried it with catfish nuggets, and it didn't come out as good, so I always use fillets now. Also, I didn't bake it as long as it recommended, only about 15-20 minutes. However, I brought a sample to my aunt's house at thanksgiving, and now she's coming to OUR house during my school's Christmas break so I can cook it for her, I highly recommended it to everyone!

Even good without the italian dressing or lemon pepper. Melted the butter then sprinkled the cayenne, black pepper and salt on. Probably not as much as the recipe calls for. Fried on high for about 1 minute on each side the baked for 25 minutes at 375.

Very good.  I added 1/4 tsp of rosemary and 1/2 tsp of thyme (both dried) to the blackened seasoning and let them sit in the fridge for 20 minutes.  And a very very hot cast iron skillet is the way to go!

I don't normally write reviews; but, I HAVE to say something about this one.. I did not like this one!  I am a huge fish fan and fix it weekly.  Way too spicy.  Too many flavors going on with the cajun spices, butter, italian dressing.. etc.  for my palate.  So, for me, I have to just scratch this recipe altogether.  However, if you want to try this recipe, you MUST understand a few key things.  In the original instructions it says to rub the fish with the spices.  I would suggest only rubbing one side or just sprinkling it on each side.

Unbelievable!!  This is probably the best fish I have had on this website so far...  The only thing we changed was using a little oil instead of butter, and it was fantastic..   I agree with some of the other reviews,  if you dont like hot food, cut down on the cayenne pepper..   A+++ Recipe!

Very good.  Nice change from the usual fried catfish.  I made the seasoning as written but sprinkled it on some of the catfish nuggets so I had some with more spice and some with less to suit everyone's taste.  It is spicy! I usually cut salt but made this as written and it was fine.  Definitely keep the fan on!  All of us were coughing as it was blackening.  No smoke, just the smell of the spices.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very tasty and contrary to other reviews it didn't smoke up my kitchen at all. I'm thinking that since I didn't have my burner on high it didn't smoke but rather had it on medium high heat. Was very tasty even though I'm not much on fish.

Wow. A hit with the fam. Thanks for sharing! Works well with cajun seasoning too, if you don't have the other spices available.

This recipe was super easy, and even my picky eating husband loved it! Will definitely be making this again. A few suggestions though, as previous posters have recommended: cut the amount of salt and cayenne pepper. I made it with 1 1/2 tsp cayenne and 2 tsp of salt, and while it was still good, the salt and heat were a little overwhelming. Next time I'll use only 1 tsp of salt and cayenne. Excellent flavors, though!

Made several times & had to reduce amount of spices.  Not something I make often, but is easy. We've used catfish nuggets also.

Delicious!! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. The spice is amazing, and although I was a little nervous about the raw smell of catfish the end result was amazing. Just be sure to have the stovetop fan on before pan frying the fish--it gets smokey very quickly and the spices almost get stuck in your lungs!

Really like this recipe, have made it many times and it is really easy. I used less of the italian dressing, just enough to coat the fish while it's baking.

WARNING!!  No exaggeration it’s extremely spicy!!  I had to open my windows and doors just to breathe while cooking this fish, my eyes where watery, and I did a lot of coughing, I thought I did something wrong, but I followed directions.  It had a lot of flavor, but too spicy for my kids to enjoy, next time I’ll use much less cayenne…but, overall it was still very delicious!!!

This could have been 5 stars, however I changed the recipe due to other reviews. I cut the cayenne pepper to 1/4, lemon pepper to 1 teaspoon, garlic 2 teaspoon, and no salt or pepper. I added a dash of blackened seasoning and italian dressing. Very tasty.

My husband loved this! I made it pretty much to the recipe except: for cayanne amount I used 1/2 chili powder, 1/2 cayanne to lessen the bite. Also, upon another reviewer's suggestion, I used oil instead of butter and topped with dijon mustard after dressing for an extra zing. It was great!!

I've NEVER liked catfish 'till now! This was wonderful. I added a little paprika, but that's about all. Yummy, indeed. Will cook this over and over, I'm sure. I made a little bottle of the ingredients and put it aside so next time, I just pull the "catfish" mix out of the spice cupboard.

I was excited about this recipe.  Since I had my baby I have had a thing for spicy foods.  I wasn't expecting this recipe to be quite this spicy though.  I wish I had read the reviews and not wasted a half pound of perfectly good catfish.  First off cut the salt!!!  Too much salt.  I love salt I mean really love salt but this is overkill!  Also cut the cayenne...I would probably use a quarter of what the recipe calls for and it would be plenty.  The other spices are overpowered by the excessive amount of salt and cayenne pepper so I can't even begin to review them.  The presentation however was beautiful.  The fillets were perfectly blackened and looked lovely.  I just wish the taste matched the presentation.  I will not make this again unless I have a horrible cold and need to be unclogged.  Yuck!

The catfish itself turned out very well, nice and flaky. However, I would cut the spices down in half at least.  We were coughing, sneezing, and practically choking during the blackening process; WAY too much cayenne pepper.  Even though we like our food hot and spicy, this was way too much.

Good recipe, very spicy. cut salt to a pinch and italian dressing to just whatever coated the fish.  I wrapped the fish in foil in the oven and it only took 15 minutes to cook.  Would make again.

This was really good! I did change some things, though. I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used chili powder and only used 1 tsp, and I lessened the salt to 3/4 tsp. It was still very spicy, but so delicious! My boyfriend hates fish, but he's definitely a fan of catfish now! I baked the fish for 25 minutes because I was worried that it would be overcooked, but it actually could've stayed in for another 5 minutes, so for me, 30 minutes was perfect.

I myself also cut the salt all the way out and the cayenne pepper in half however I did use the butter didn't like the out come next time I will use some olive oil instead due to I don't really like blackened anything. So just to cook the seasoning and precook the fish will be fine with me. However it was good to my husband and we had a zucchini and yellow squash with clam meat salad instead of the rice.

This was fantastic!  I didn't quite use all the rub, but the fish was still completely covered.  I also fried the fish in a little canola instead of using the butter, but it was amazing.  This will definitely make it into my fish rotation.

Great recipe if you like it hot! I made this for myself because my guy hates fish. So, I cut the spices in half and the salt 1/4 tsp. Then since I can't have all the calories from the Italian dressing, I just used 2tbs. per fillet. Yummy.. I used this for my fish tacos. Which was just the blackened fish, lettuce and special tartar sauce in a semi-crunchy tortilla. Also it took 15 minutes in my oven. Thanks will be sure to use this recipe again!

I made this dish and there was nothing left.  My husband couldnt get enough of this meal.  I did use 1/2 the ceyenne pepper and regular pepper than it called for and still had a kick.  I will definately be making this meal again.  Delicious!!!

Absolutely delicious!  The only thing I did was use the Newman's Own Oil and Vinegar Dressing instead of Italian because that is all I had.  OH wow!  Absolutely yummy!  Thank you SOOOO much!!

Good recipe.  I used less cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper and it still had a huge fiery kick.  Also, I used maybe three tablespoons of fat-free Italian dressing for my three four-oz. fillets. The suggested amount would have been way too much.  Before making this dish though, I knew that I wasn’t going to get the blackened look with my non-stick skillet, but it was still good.  I served it with rice and spinach.

This was very good, but I too thought the seasoning overpowered the fish a bit (and I like spicy food!).  Perhaps I put too much on the fish.  Next time, I would "lightly" coat both side by sprinkling the mixture on the fish rather than rubbing it on.  I also didn't need to cook it as long as it said.  I think I had it in the over for only about 25 minutes and that was good enough.  It is a keeper.....just be careful not to put too much seasoning on it!

This was absolutely awesome! My husband said this was "restaurant good" and a definite recipe to repeat. That makes me happy because it was easy. I was going to serve it with rice but we were out. So I served it with garlic mashed potatoes. Great dinner! Thanks!

Hubby and I thought it was delicious, but it was a bit too spicy for our 5 year old, so I probably won't make again.

This turned out great & spicy, although I had to adapt the cooking method somewhat.  I used catfish nuggets that were previously frozen.  While cooking in the pan they didn't blacken at all I think because there was too much liquid from being frozen.  So I put them in the oven awhile and then after put them back in the pan stovetop and fried them up crispy.  Nice & Spicy!

Not bad.  I think next time I might just skip the italian dressing, it came out a little too tangy for my taste.  I think the other seasonings were great! I do love spicy food, so it hit the spot!

I found this recipe a bit too hot and spicy. I did use only half of the cayanne that it called for. It was flavorful, but next time, I believe that I will use the spices sparingly. I served it on a bed of white rice to tone it down some.

Great spice rub! Didn't change the recipe, except that I didn't have Italian dressing & made my own with Olive oil, rice vinegar mixed with dry seasonings: Italian seasoning, parsley, garlic powder, salt to taste. I didn't have lemon pepper, but used same amount of black pepper & applied drops of lemon juice from a container directly on the meat before applying the dry rub.
Next time I will need to cook my fish outside my place on a bbq grill since the cayenne pepper gave me a cough attack.

wow!  my boyfriend said this was the best he's ever had!!  i've never made catfish (or had it for that matter...) so i didn't know what to expect but it was awesome.  it had a really nice subtle (for my taste) spicey kick to it.  it was a bit hard for me to spread the called for amount of spices over my fish though, but i got the job done ;-)  thanks for this great recipe!  pic

I cannot believe that we didn't like this recipe. We had a little fish tasting night recently and we found this the the lowest pick of the night. I have since done the cat fish by just frying it and got much better results.
The other selections for the evening were
Pecan coated Roughy
Broiled Scallops
Lobster Thermador
Smothered Tilapia

I'm sorry that this recipe was the lowest rated of the night, but it was an unanimous opinion.

Very very good & tasty. I made 2 pans, one with the cayenne pepper and one w/o because I thought using all the pepper in the original recipe would make it too hot/spicy for my children. But actualy it did not. In fact the kids thought the fish that used the original recipe w/ the cayenne pepper was much more tastier!!! :-)

The taste is good but I'm not sure how to keep the catfish moist on the inside but crispy on the outside. The marinade works well keeping the fish moist but too far from crispy.

I liked this alot!  I had to leave out the "Cajun" because no one else in the family likes spicy foods, but otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. I think next time I make catfish, I am going to skip the italian dressing.

S-P-I-C-E-Y. Good but a little spicey for my taste and I like spicey food. 

Will probably make again but not often.

This recipe was great! Next time I'll eliminate the salt, as the different peppers give it enough of a wonderful flavor.  Great served with a fresh tomato, onion salsa!

I thought this was really good. Next time I will reduce the salt a little bit since I found it to be on the salty side. It was just the right amount of spice though and the fish was moist. I add sliced lemons to the dish as it was baking and garnished with fresh parsley which made for a beautiful presentation as well.

I have never prepared catfish any way except to fry with a cornmeal, flour, and seasonings and this was a nice change even though I still prefer fried but this is healthier.  We enjoyed this, was a little spicy for my son.

My husband is picky and he said this was delicious, I did change a few things. I only used 1/2 tsp cay pepper and added 1 & 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning. I also only put 1/4 cup sweet vinegar and olive oil mixture with s/p. I also sprayed the baking dish with non stich spray so the fish would not stick while baking, excellent

Excellent if you like SPICY!!! I will make this over and over again! Husband loved it-it was just WAY HOT! Will "tweek" it a little next time. I followed the recipe to a tee so I could see how to play with it. Extremely EASY!

Outstanding blacken catfish. The only change I made was to use half of the Italian dresing - next time I may even omit it completely (not sure it added anything and it may have even detracted from the recipe). I used all of the spices as recommended and it was very spicy (but I love spicy food). I'd cut the red pepper by at least half if I were making this for others.

I cooked this for my family and the flavor is excellent. However, if you have family members that have no tolerance for spicy foods, omit or cut way down on the cayenne. My 9 year old son couldn't eat it. My husband & I loved it, though. I will make it again!

Whew, strong stuff!  Used catfish nuggets and was tasty.  Just watch out for the fumes while you're frying it *hack hack*.  That cayenne'll get you.  This was not a real "wow" of a dish, flavor wise, but it got points for the sheer spicyness factor.

INCREDIBLY flavorful, even without any cayenne pepper!  I used halibut instead of catfish and it turned out great.  Definitely do not forget the italian dressing at the end, that's what really made the dish for me.  Will make this again and again!

I cut the cayenne pepper down to half and it was still way too spicy for my family.  I should have used 1/4 t like one reviewer said.  If I make it again I will do that.

If you like it really spicy, then this is your dish!  I had two pounds of catfish fillets, so I stuck with the measurements for the cayenne, lemon pepper and garlic powder.  I didn't add the black pepper because I thought it was unnecessary since it already had lemon pepper seasoning.  I also skipped the salt.  I may skip the blackening step next time and broil instead, because it really smoked up my kitchen and the spices at that temp will take your breath away.  I'm not sure what the italian dressing was for, but I only drizzled it on the top of the fillets.  All in all, it was a very good dish...so good that my husband and I finished off 8 fillets by ourselves!

This was wonderful!!  I was so proud of myself in the way it came out, it looked really professional, and tasted great.  I actually already had a cajun seasoning prepared (from the Blakened Salmon recipe on this site) which I used instead ... however the added kick of baking it in Italian dressing is what really set it off.  It was nice and moist and tangy.  I loved it.

This is a great recipe for chicken as well - I use the dry ingredients as a rub then grill the chicken (or fish) and serve on top of a green salad with the Italian dressing.  It's always a hit.

Delicious! I used 1/2 of the recommended cayenne pepper and even though I love spicy food, I thought it was a little too warm. Next time, I'll also decrease the amount of Italian dressing and used just enough to coat the fillets. Thanks for a great recipe!

I cut down the Italian dressing (one cup seemed a lot) and used olive oil instead of butter.  But this came out fantastic.  True, I smoked up my kitchen with cayenne fumes, but the product was worth it.  Husband raved and insisted this be a regular dish; said he wouldn't have been disappointed if he'd paid $15 at a restaurant for this.  As others have said, it is *hot*, but tasty!

I followed the recipe exactly, and the heat was perfect for my wife and I, but we like heat.  She wasn't wild about the italian dressing taste, so next time, I'll try baking it with a drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice.  It was slightly salty, and I like salt, so it may make sense to halve the salt.  A great fish recipe!

Very good but it was very spicy. Too spicy. When cooking, make sure you have a good ventilation system in your kitchen or you will suffer from sever smoke inhalation.

This is the best blackened catfish that I ever ate. At first I was alittle nervus about making it, but it is well worth it. My hand goes out to the chief. DON'T change anything.

I would give this more stars if I could!  My picky husband and son loved it, they thought the spices were perfect.  It was too hot for my taste but it was so good I ate it anyway, even though I was breathing flames!  The blackening process really made sinus-scorching fumes in the kitchen, but it was worth it.

Great!  It was a little bit on the spicy side for my tastes, but nonetheless delicious, easy, and quick!

found that the spices masked the flavor of the fish.
other than that, it was great.

Delicious and spicy! This was quick, simple and resulted in very tender, moist, flavourful fish. Will definitely do this again. Forgot the italian dressing by accident but it came out very moist and tender anyway, will probably try to remember the dressing next time just to see the difference.

We loved this.  I'm not even a big fish fan but I cleaned my plate.  I had about 1.5lbs of catfish total and I didn't change the amount of spices called for in the recipe.  I found there was just enough of everything.

We mixed the blackening seasonings according to the recipe, but used half.  Very easy recipe.  Tasty too.  If you have one, I'd recommend using the side burner on your grill to blacken the fish (or any meat) to keep your house smoke-free (and your fire alarm quiet!).

Easy to make and very good.  My husband enjoyed really enjoyed it.  Used half the cayenne pepper and cut back on the salt and pepper (personal choice).  If making for myself I would cut the cayenne to less than half.

I liked it overall, but I think some of the other reviewers are right in saying it's too salty. I like spicy dishes and didn't find it too hot as many others did-- but salty, definitely. Cut that back and this should work well.

Fntastic! I didn't have butter or lemon pepper so what I did was mix olive oil with lemon juice and I used that to brush on the fish. This was very good. I don't eat fih but this I did. It was spicy but it didn't overpower the fish. It was just right. Thank you

Didn't really care for this but my husband gave it 3 stars.  I used only 1/4 of the cayenne and that seemed about right.  I think if I were to try it again, I would use a different kind of fish.

Yum!  Okay, so I cooked the fish too long but let me tell you hubby and I almost ate the whole thing in one sitting!!!  

I did cut the cayenne pepper in half and it still was really hot.  And we love hot food.  Next time I'll only put 1/4 of the pepper called for.  I also omitted the salt as others had suggested.

This is a keeper.

I'm not really into baked fish, but I tried this recipe and LOVED it, so did my husband (we love spicy food). I left out the lemon pepper seasoning and used lemon juice as some others suggested and olive oil instead of butter. A keeper!

THANKS to other reviewers!! I omitted salt and cut cayenne pepper in half and still was WAY TOO HOT, even for the men! Next time I will only add 1/2 tsp.  Otherwise, great recipe..will make again with less cayenne!!!

As the others have said, I cut the cayenne, salt, and black pepper in half and STILL found it a bit hot, but I'm giving it five stars anyway because it was extremely tasty!  Definitely a winner, but most people will want to cut WAY back on the spices.

I substituted perch for catfish and olive oil for butter.  It was okay - a little too peppery - but okay to try again with modification.  Didn't seem blackened so much as spicy.

Excellent!!!  Like others, I left out the salt and cut the pepper and cayenne in half.  The fillets I used were small so full strength would have been too much.  My husband is from Louisiana and loved it.  I plan to make this recipe weekly!

Wow!  This dish was incredible!  I made it exactly as stated with the exception of drizzling on the salad dressing instead of using a whole cup.  This was extremely spicy and extremely tasty.  I had to scrape the mixture off the fish in order to eat it, but it was so good.  I will definitely make this again with half the amount of pepper and salt as others have suggested.  Thanks!

I'm glad I read the reveiws first.  I cut back on the salt & cayenne pepper & it was still too hot & salty.  I couldn't imagine this recipe with all the cayenne pepper that's called for!  I think the salad dressing adds to the saltiness.  I'll try it one more time further reducing those ingredients.  We said it'd be worth another try, when we can actually taste it.

Excellent.  I halfed the pepper and made a homemade italian dressing since I didn't have any on hand.  I also made a seperate mixture for my daugher, completely omitting the cayenne and adding more lemon pepper and garlic powder.  It was a huge hit!!!

This was absolutely yummy! I did take the advice of other reviewers and halved the peppers (and salt)but it was still a bit too hot (and I like my food spicy!). Flavor was GREAT though. Will definitely make this one again. Thanks, Jeff!

This was pretty good.  It didn't take long to prepare and came out really juicy.  It was extremely spicy though, so next time I am going to use less cayenne pepper.  My husband is from Louisiana and he loved it.

This recipe was just what our family needed for a little spice without the frying. I toned up the pepper to ease up on the spice. A dish I have found myself making over and over again, I love it, my kids love it, and the neighbors are coming over a lot more......

Very good flavor, I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper because I have children, but it was a delightful dish nonetheless.  I also used talapia instead trout.  Superb!

A little too spicy for my family's taste but otherwise, very tasty and very easy.

This was a very good dish, but beware to those who do not like spicey food because this is very spicy!  This is not a food for kids unless they can tolerate extra spicey food.  Overall we loved it and will fix it again.
