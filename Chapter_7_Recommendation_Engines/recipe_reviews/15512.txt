Good basic recipe and idea. I serve in baked 'tortilla' bowls. If you don't have a special pan, fold large tortillas over an oven proof bowl..spray both sides of the tortilla with Pam spray and bake at 325 for 10-15 minutes. Voila..edible bowl!

This recipe was delicious, but don't forget the onions! They are not listed in the ingredients section, but they are included in the recipe. We had it without, and it was still very good.  A definite repeat for us.  Hubby and I just started a diet together, so this was a yummy way to start it off!!

A very good recipe - delicious!  The only thing I did a bit different was to marinade
the chicken cubes in salsa for a few minutes before cooking - I also cooked the chicken 
with the salsa marinade in a skillet.  I will definitely make this dish again.  Serve with the
fat free refried beans and it makes for a healthy low fat meal.

Just looked for some low fat recipes and noticed this one because I love tex-mex, but I would not make this one as it is suggested.  I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  The sodium content is way too high for one serving and it has added cheese.  I guess I have to redo it to meet my needs.

This recipe is really good and quick. A nice spicey addition is to spread "black bean dip" on the tortillas before you put the lettuce/chicken mixture & garnish on. A definite repeat for our family.

My entire family, including my 3 and 6 year old kids, loved this recipe.  Even my husband who hates anything low fat loved it.  I think it will be great in summertime too -- full of flavor, light and tasty!

This was a wonderful recipe. I was afraid that the chicken would be bland because of no seasoning...so after I cooked the chicken I placed it in a bowl and added salsa....it turned out GREAT! My husband loved it!

I am 7 months pregnant and was just diagnosed as having borderline gestational diabetes, so I came here looking for more "healthy" recipes than we'd been eating here.  This one caught my husband's attention and we had it for dinner last night.  We skipped the cheese, but the tostadas were still delicious!  My husband grilled the chicken breasts on the george foreman grill and cut them into strips.  I still can't get over how great this was, and we both agree that we will be eating these often!

My husband and I had this meal last night and it was great. I shredded the chicken and mixed the salsa, sour cream and cheese in the bowl with the rest of the mixture and it was really good. I rolled it up into a tortilla and it stayed together. Delicious!

Good but nothing spectacular.  Onions were left off ingredient list.  Would like to find something to jazz this up a bit while keeping it healthy.  I'm also not sure why there is so much salsa in the ingredient listing.

This was great! Even my daughter who does not like anything liked it! Instead of flour tortillas though we used corn just to cut back on the fat a little more and it was so good! Thank you for the wonderfull dinner!

I was in a big hurry, so we wrapped the chicken, lettuce mixture, sour cream and salsa in whole wheat tortillas and ate them taco style.  A nice light meal that we enjoyed so much I am making them again right now.

Awesome! My husband and I love these!  I usually make the tortillas in the oven instead of pan.  Plus I skip the lettuce, add red bell peppers and cilantro.  Plus Jalapenos to mine...my husband cant handle spice.  So yummy!!

The chicken turned out wonderfully! Very flavorful and tasty. I really like having the lettuce mixed with the chicken, too. The tortillas didn't crisp up, though, doing it by the recipe. Next time I think I'll actually use some oil to fry them. All in all, a pretty good recipe and it goes very quickly.

I used iceberg lettuce and. No tomatoes because most of the people eating it don't like them . It mentioned onions but wasn't in the recipe as well as seeing avocado on the picture but not mentioning it in recipe.

I really liked this recipe. I was looking for something to use the cilantro lime chicken breast (from this site) in. Added black olives , cumin, garlic, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and black beans and paired it with the cucumber salad from this site. What a great lite meal for a warm evening!
