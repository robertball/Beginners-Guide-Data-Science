5.18.18  My 8” springform pan will not fit into my 6 qt. Instant Pot®,  but it will hold two of a small size I have (4”x1-1/4”) and seldom use.  This was the perfect time to pull them out of the cabinet and give this recipe a test run.  I made half a recipe using 1 pkg of reduced fat cream cheese, and the batter fit perfectly into my single pan.  Followed the directions to the letter, and this turned out surprisingly well.  The texture is spot on cheesecake, and I really didn’t even miss the crust.  My husband said he does enjoy the crust, but he enjoyed this, and it disappeared pretty quickly.  This is so darn easy to make with minimal cleanup, and has nice presentation.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Delicious! Creamiest cheesecake I’ve ever made and the Instant Pot made it so easy and worry free. I used 1/2 Just Like Sugar sugar substitute and 1/2 regular sugar (personal taste). The Just Like Sugar worked great but  since we don’t need to watch our sugars,  I will just use all regular sugar next time. I would recommend cutting parchment to fit the bottom of the pan and placing that on the greased pan being sure to grease the parchment before adding the cheese mixture. This will help the cheesecake slide off the pan. I did have to run a knife carefully  around the inside of the pan to release the sides.

I made just as the reciepe called for and it was a big hit. I might try parchment paper on the bottom next as it was hard to get off the pan.
