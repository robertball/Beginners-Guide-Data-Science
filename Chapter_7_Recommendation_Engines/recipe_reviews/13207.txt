This is the easiest egg drop soup I've made and it's good!  I used a ratio of one can of chicken broth and 2 eggs to make it a little more filling.  Green onion instead of minced was nice because it added color along with the taste.  And I shook in a few drops of hot pepper sauce at the end along with the soy sauce.  To make nicely shaped egg "shreds" in the soup, stir the broth in ONE direction.  Slowly add the egg while stirring in that same direction.

This is a great recipe!  The broth was a little salty because of the cubes, so next time I will add another cup of water.  Didn't have corn starch, so I used flour - and the chunks of flour that gathered made little yummy dumplings.  VERY VERY EASY!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I would find soya sauce too powerful for this dish...  so throwing in some green onions and ginger instead did the trick.  The second time I made it I added mushrooms, which was a good complimentary texture to the egg.

I wanted a bowl of hot soup on a really cold afternoon, and I found this recipe. It's quick, easy and very tasty. This and a grilled cheese sandwich made for a perfect supper. The only thing I did differently, was to add some green peas and soy sauce at the end. Wonderful!

Even though pretty good...I have had and made better.  I love dried onion, but I do believe it does not belong in this soup.  And to get the egg right you should let it drizzle off a fork instead of just stirring it in.  I think I'll pass on making this one again...but thanks.....

This soup tasted good but looked just a little weird.  I added some garlic powder and just a little soy sauce. I also didn't use the cornstarch but did add a little more egg.  When I added the eggs it looked good and then it looked like scrambled eggs in chicken broth. When I have it in the restaurant the eggs look more whispy.  I'll definitely be making it again but I might try to let the soup come down from a boil when I add the eggs.

Very good soup. I think if I had used fresh ingredients it would have been a five on the star rating. Very quick and easy to make. Thank you.

I used vegetable boullion instead of chicken. It was so much better that way! With the vegetable stock, it was a very good, flavorful soup. Add rice to make it a meal

This was a very good recipe. It was extremely easy and fun. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it was a little plain. To fix this I added carrots, peas and any other vegi that sounded good.

I had to cut back on the amount of bouillon to 3 cubes, plus it needed a bit of garlic powder and ground ginger, along with chopped green onions to make it taste like restaraunt soup.   The rating is based on if I made it according to the recipe- it would have been a bit too salty and plain.

EASY and taste great! I have a summer cold and this is perfect. I only added a pinch of garlic salt and a splash of soy sauce. It is better that chicken soup to me.

This very yummy. I was out of onions, so added some onion powder instead. Also, I added a tiny bit of fresh ginger, and a little bit of ginger powder. For some additional texture,and to make it more filling,  I added some thinly sliced celery, celery leaves, and some carrots. Very tasty and great for a rainy day!

This was an extremely delicious dish, I loved it and it only took about 10min to make. The only thing I would probably change is the amount of chicken bouillon cubes, it seemed a little too salty. I also added a pinch powdered garlic, and it defiantly gave it a good kick. Thanks for this great recipe! :)

It would've been better with less chicken bouillons. I think next time I'll just use one instead of four. Even after I added another 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water it was still too salty for me. I remember when I was a kid and sick, my mom would make this soup for me, but the only seasonings she used were salt, LOTS of black pepper, and some ginger. Yum!

I just finished making Shrimp Fried Rice and decided to make some Egg Drop Soup to go along with our meal.  This was my first time making this recipe and it turned out great!    Like others, I did make a few changes--a few drops of sesame seed oil and soy sauce.  I didn't have any cornstarch on hand so I did whisk a little flour into the broth instead.  Then, added the eggs. We had some egg roll wraps handy so we cut them up into thin strips, fried them, and crumbled them into the soup.  Everyone was extremely happy with this meal. Very quick and easy.  Just as good as any Chinese restaurant! Thanks Denise!

I made this by request of my sick husband.  It was quick and easy.  I'm not a huge fan of egg drop soup, but he said it was one of the best he's ever had.  I'm sure I'll make it for him again.  It's a simple one to make him happy!  I followed it exactly.

This was easy which was the redeeming factor.  Not that it tasted bad, it just had no ummpf.  Probably more like 3 1/2 stars.

Very easy fast soup. Makes a great addition to Chinese takeout or stir fry. I added frozen corn and green onions to it and it made it even better. My one suggestion to the recipe is NOT to mix the corn starch with the soup. Use cold water instead. Maybe I misunderstood the directions, but when I mixed it with soup, it made it globby. So I dumped that cornstarch mixture down the sink and uses cold water instead (which is how I usually cook with cornstarch).

I made this for my family and (even as picky as all 8 of them are) it was incredible. The house smelled amazing and this paired perfectly with "Peanut Noodles" (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Peanut-Noodles/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=cold%20spagetti&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page) Both are highly recommended and I will certainly be making them again! Thank you so much for posting!

This gets a 5 for ease of preparation! I have strep throat :(, and it only took me about 3 minutes to make this. Win! Didn't measure anything, used onion powder instead of dried minced, and added a splash of soy sauce and some sesame oil, since I love it. Comforting and easy to swallow when your throat feels like razor blades are being dragged across it. I would definitely add green onions if I had them. Thanks for the super quick recipe!

I was skeptical of trying this recipe since it did not seem super authentic, but it turned out great, and even better than a very authentic version I tried.  I would have used green onions instead of dried, but I just used 1/3 of a yellow onion, and it turned out great. I will be making this again with green onions or chives.

It was okay but not thick enough for me and not enough egg.

OMG! I have to say, I NEVER had or even tried egg drop soup, for the fact that it looks nasty, but I needed an easy recipe to make my son because he was SUPER hungry, I tried a sip and I was like "OMG!" Even when I put the cornstarch first with the other ingredients, it was perfect! I think my fiance will LOVE this! This is a keeper here! Not too salty, and very flavorful! Thanks!

Great Soup, super easy to make.  I halved it for my sick wife and it was just about a perfect amount for a lunch for her.  I used Better than Bouillon instead of the cubes (I like it a lot better, less salty and more real chicken flavor) and added just a hint of sesame oil to the recipe for a little extra flavor.  Absolutely fantastic!

Super easy, but  better by adding 1/2 an onion (roughly chopped) and letting that boil with the bouillon. Then it's like a chicken onion soup!

Salty!! I used two cubes of Knorr chicken bouillon since they are equivalent to 2 cups of chicken broth and the soup came out way too salty. I'm glad I didn't throw in 4 cubes. Next time I'll use 1 Knorr bouillon per 4 cups water and see how it comes out.

It hit the spot!  I made a few personal preference tweaks (extra bouillon cube, left out the onion, 2 shakes of reduced sodium soy sauce, few shakes of pepper) but, overall, this was exactly what I was looking for.

My daughter said to give this 5 stars, even though she thinks it should be 10! She wanted egg drop soup and this had what I had on hand almost. No cornstarch so I used flour. I did 3 cubes and 3 cups of water. I never made it before and I was happy how EASY this is to make. No left overs,  she ate the whole pan! So this is a keeper. Takes only a few minutes and doesn't mess up the kitchen. Thanks for sharing this.

I am giving this 5 stars for being super easy, cheap, fast, tasty, filling and relatively healthy. I think almost everyone has these ingredients in their house at any given time. I added 1 cup frozen corn and it was really good.

I didn't have corn starch but I'm sure if I did it would have been so much better it was still very good I didn't chop up onions like some people did I had dried onion seasoning and I have to remember when I make this again (and I will) to go a little less on that and maybe a little ginger would have been good too

Tasty and easy.  I made a few substitutions - saute shallots, a little ginger, and garlic to start.  I also added peas as someone suggested.  Thanks!

I wanted something fast and easy to make with the limited food items I have in my fridge (I need to go grocery shopping).  I pulled out my eggs, originally thinking of making an omelette, but then I got a hankering for egg drop soup, so I looked it up.  I'm impressed!  I used low sodium boullions and I didn't have any corn start, so I used a little bit of wheat flour.  I also threw some spinach in the pot. I don't know how authentic it is to add spinach to egg drop soup, but it left my tummy full and my taste buds happy.

This recipe was great! I made just a few changes being we eat mostly vegetarian. I used garbanzo bean flour to replace the cornstarch, which gave it an earthier flavor. I also used about a cup & a half of frozen peas, & a cup of chopped green scallions. My family said it was deeeeeelicious!!!! They told me to put it in the Keeper recipe box!

Very yummy, but cornstarch and I have some issues. I have a LOT of trouble getting rid of the lumps. Because of this, I sometimes leave the cornstarch out, and it's very tasty without it.

My 8 yr. old son saw something about egg drop soup on TV and asked me to make it. I used this recipe as a guideline because we are lacto-ovo vegetarian, so made it from vegetarian broth (McKay's Chicken Seasoning). I also use arrowroot powder as a thickener. I thought it was excellent, and my PICKY son gobbled it up and asked for more!!  Quick and easy to make! I may add tofu and peas in the future.

This was really good, and even my 11yo picky eater loved it.  I did make it with chicken broth, and next time I'll use fresh onion coarsely chopped rather than dried minced onion.  The dried minced onion gave the soup an slightly strange texture.  Overall though, simple is sometimes best and this is a very simple recipe.

This recipe was delicious.  I did however make a few changes.  I scaled it for 6 servings.  I used canned chicken broth (the large can) and I added 1/4 tsp ginger.  My whole family loved it.  I went with the canned broth because on our budget it is less expensive.  I will definitely be making it again.  At that time I will need to make a batch for 12 as everyone wanted seconds.  Thanks for a quick and simple recipe.

I have made this tonight with biscuits! I must say, I was quite anxious with all the parsley and garlic; but it turned out wondrous! It's definitely not too egg-y like I've heard, or the bouillon cubes overwrite the flavor. In fact, it's more of a onion taste; but really, all the ingredients together make it just splendid!  Thank you for the wonderful meal, I will definitely have more leftovers tomorrow to eat!

I loved this egg drop soup. I did use 3 cups of chicken broth and only one cup of water. I also substituted green onions for chopped onions. I beat 2 eggs, but didn't end up using all of the beaten eggs.... It depends how much egg you like in your soup.

It was OK at best.  I added 2 more cubes of chicken bouillon;  another  tablespoon of cornstarch;  1 tablespoon of onion powder and about 1 tablespoon of soy sauce.  I doubt if I ever make this particular recipe again.

So good. Hubby loves it. It's very easy to make. I find it a tad on the salty side but I still love this recipe. Very good.

The flavor was ok, but incredibly salty. I added some chopped up mushrooms to add some substance, but the salt was very overpowering.

This was such an easy soup to make, and bonus points for using staple items I always have. I used Better than Bouillon instead of the bouillon cubes because it's what I always use anyway. There was no extra saltiness issue for me, probably because of the Better than Bouillon. I must admit, though, other from scratch fussier egg drop soups taste better. Not much though.

I made this for my 10 year old daughter. She loves egg drop soup. I figured I could try at home and her get more of it.  Now at the restaurants she adds soy sauce to it. So, I made it like the recipe said and had her try it. She said it was ok, but needed soy sauce. So after adding it she LOVED it.

I made this for my son as he is sick and didn't want to wait for dinner to get done. It was super quick and easy to make. He loved it! I thought it was a bit salty and I didn't care for the spices. I was looking for something more akin to a restaurant style soup. I think I will just try it without the spices next time and maybe chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. Overall great recipe. Will make it again.

Very good and easy recipe! I added an extra egg, some ginger garlic paste, and a little green curry paste to make it more tasty. It's important to really whip up the eggs though so they're not scrambled in the end.

I made this for lunch today.  It was very good.  I can't wait to play around with this basic recipe, maybe add some veggies for color.  I also add a few drops of hot sauce for a little heat.

I really wanted to like this. I LOVE egg drop soup and I'm sick with pneumonia, so i was really looking forward to it but I honestly could have gotten some chicken broth and added tons of salt and a few eggs and gotten the same result. :-(  WAY too much bouillon in my opinion. It even left a film on the roof of my mouth! Sorry, but this one didn't do it for me. :-(

Light and delicious!  I've been looking for a simple egg drop soup recipe that I can toss together from ingredients I keep on hand.  I expected to add some soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions but it was delicious as is.  I'm the only one in my house who likes soup or eggs, so half of a recipe is a great, light, filling meal for one!

This recipe is incredibly simple to make, and comes out fantastic! The only problem I have is that it never really seems to thicken... but it's still delicious. I often add cubed tofu and it works great!

This is SO much better than "take-out"! Much less salty, depending on what you use. I used 4 cups chicken broth and added 1 chicken boullion cube with 1/2 cup extra water. I also added soy sauce (about 1/2 tsp.) to the soup while simmering.     Perfect low-cal comfort food!

This was really good. I like that there's no soy sauce. I find that to be too salty when added to store-bought broth/boullion.

I thought this was awesome.  Especially for the amt of work that goes into it.  It's a very tasty  broth.  Green onions are a great subsitute for the dried onion if you have the time.

Easy but bland. This is a great base for egg drop soup, the consistency came out great. But the first batch I made had no flavor what so ever. The second time was so much better. I replaced the minced onions with fresh green onion. Then I added chili garlic paste, mirin, rice vinegar and frozen peas. I also did 3 egg whites and one whole egg.

i doubled this recipe, and served it with chicken/vegetable stir-fry and rice.  didn't have any dried minced onion, so i used onion powder.  i'm allergic to the msg in bouillon, so i used less of that and added some soy sauce for flavor.  family loved it; altogether a very good recipe, will certainly make again.

I love this recipe because it is easy, I always have the ingredients on hand, and it tastes really good.  I have also tried it with beef cubes instead of chicken, and they are great also.

Quick and easy. I made this a meal with "Awesome Egg Rolls" and "Peach Pie Egg Rolls." My husband loved it (and he hates Chinese food).

I love eggdrop soup and this recipe hit the spot. I added cheese filled wontons to mine cuz the soup itself is kinda boring...not just this recipe, but any plain eggdrop soup recipe.

My wife and I found this to be the perfect recovery soup after a bout of food poisoning (my bad). This was a real life saver!

This soup was great.  Another viewer commented on the saltiness, so I used 3 cubes, threw in some frozen peas and it was awesome.  My husband thought it was better than the soup at the chinese restaurants.  Will definetely make this again.

This did not look like it was done correctly but it tasted really good.   I did add the ginger for a little extra flavor.

Really good soup. The only thing is that I cannot seem to get it to the same consistency (or color) as restaurant egg drop soup. I thought the cornstarch would do it in this recipe but it still wasn't quite as thick. I did not think this was too salty at all and in fact added just a splash of soy sauce at the end. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

as written, it's good.  but next time i will use 2 cups low sodium chicken broth and 2 c.water with 2 boullion cubes.  it was a little too salty for us.
