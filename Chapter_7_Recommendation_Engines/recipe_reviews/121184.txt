This fudge had very good flavor and texture.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.

I tried this recipe of Double Chocolate Fudge. After almost 24hrs of chilling, it still came out gooey.  The 1st layer of semi-sweet chocolate came out better but the top layer of milk choco is really gooey.  I melted chocolate on a double boiler for fear of burning the chocolate.  Why did it not come out right like the others who tried?

This is very chocolatey and a bit tasty, but not anything like the fudge my mom used to make when I was a kid.  It just tastes like melted chocolate chips, and I was looking for something else.

I have made this for the past three Chistmas holidays to put in gift bags for friends.  It always turns out well and keeps for a long time.

I made this fudge to bring into my work at Christmas, and it was a hit! I have never ever made fudge in my entire life and didnt know what to expect, but this was fantastic. I did however omit the chopped nuts, becuase not everyone is a fan, and it still turned out great!

Mine didn't set properly.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it came out more like a thick syrup.  I didn't care for the flavor all that much, but it made a good alternative for chocolate syrup.
