I used 2 cups of baby spinach I had frozen as well as golden flax seeds instead of the chia. I couldn't taste the spinach or the kale...mostly peanut butter and banana. I did add 2 packets of Truvia as a personal preference for more sweetness. It made a breakfast that I felt was nutritious and healthy, and it was a beautiful shade of green and tasted good!

Great idea to get some green leafy veggies in you but I think it needs a little something else. I didn't change anything for the first try but I'll experiment a little more next time

Good! I used all spinach since I didn't have kale and regular low fat milk, other than that followed the recipe exactly and we loved it! it's so creamy with the addition of milk and peanut butter. Next time we will add a few ice cubes :) Thanks for sharing your recipe Jmehney!

First off, I drink "green" smoothies all the time - im a bit of a nutribullet addict. No sweeteners, tons of greens, good, clean eating. Its a taste I've come to know and love.
I used 2 packed cups of baby kale/spinach/chard mix that I had on hand. Also I added flax & chia. And I swapped out the regular PB for powdered PB, all the taste and only 45 cal, 1.5 g fat in 2 T. It was creamy and delicious, but I think the chard added some unnecessary bite to it.

This was delicious.  I didn't have almond milk, so I just used skim milk.  And I added several ice cubes because I enjoy a more frozen smoothie.  I gave it to my picky 8 year old and he LOVED it!!  Definitely a keeper and a great way to get some healthy greens.

First time green smoothie drinker! LoL! It's really good! I can taste the spinach but it's not bad and I did add a pack of sweetener bc I was afraid the taste might make me gag but it was fine and I did add flax seed meal bc I didn't have chia seed.

I used 1 cup frozen kale and on cup frozen spinach,  I just thawed it with some warm water. I didn't have any chia seeds, but it still came out really tasty.

I only used a teaspoon of peanut butter, and it was still delicious! Mostly tasted banana and peanut butter, it did a good job of covering up the freshly cut grass taste!

I loved the idea of this smoothie but it wasn't sweet enough for me. I also used a fresh banana so not sure if that makes a difference. However, after blending the first time I added 3 cubes of ice, a tsp of honey, and 2 dates and this seemed to add the sweetness that I needed. Next time, I'll forgo the honey and just add an additional date :)

Recipe was super easy to follow! I added flax seeds as well, and it was all really good. The smoothie is a very pretty green color and tastes amazing! I don’t even taste the vegetables— just peanut butter and banana. Mine did come out a little thick, but I like my smoothies like that. Add more almond milk if you want it to be less thick.

It's delicious, was skeptical about how it would taste but it actually tasted great! I didn't have chia, so I used flax seed instead. I think it's great with it nevertheless.  I'm definitely going to make it again!

I made it with chard, kale and spinach. I used 1/2 a banana with five pieces of chopped carrots. 1-Spoonful of Almond butter (unsalted and unsweetened). Pinch of coconut (unsweetened Trader Joe’s). 1-cup of Almond milk (unsweetened Vanilla). It was delicious and low calories.

This is my go to breakfast Mon-Fri. I omit the banana and add a couple scoops of vanilla protein powder, and 1/2cup oatmeal, to use as a post workout smoothie. 
Delicious!

I changed it up a bit and made this a pre-workout protein smoothie by adding Almond/Coconut Milk, Protein Power, Almond Butter, Half of a Green Apple, Tablespoon of Greek Yogurt, and a drop of Peppermint Oil.  Super Yummy!

I used only spinach and forgot to add the Chia seeds. But it was still very good. I added a squirt of agave and a packet of Trivia. I liked that I could taste the peanut butter. I topped it off with fat free whipped cream. Will make again.

I especially liked that it was more vegetable than fruit.

Tried it with Hemp seeds since I was out of Chia seeds.  Gave it a slightly nuttier taste.

I made this but had broccoli in as well, I tried to mask the taste with mango and peach joghurt but failed. I will appreciate any ideas anyone has to offer to make it taste better.

Peanut butter really helped mask taste. I followed the recipe and found the taste okay. Then tried with kale substituting the spinach and wasn't a fan but it didn't fully taste like grass which was good. 
I'm not a fan of raw kale but this recipe makes it tolerable. 
Hopefully my tastebuds will get used to green smoothies for the sake of health.

I didn't make any changes, and absolutely loved it!!! It's so delicious! My banana wasn't frozen but it was so creamy! Banana and PB play a huge role in the taste. Absolutely incredible!

This is the first green smoothie I've made and they are yummy!  My husband and I make them a few times throughout the week for lunches or treats.  When well blended, all you can taste is the peanut butter and bananas!

This was really good! I made this for my husband and I this morning, it was super delish! I added more spinach & kale, chia & flax seeds, one packet of Stevia to your recipe.  I will be making this recipe all the time! Thanks for sharing!

I used 2c raw kale instead of spinach and 2T ground flax instead of chia and 2% regular milk instead of almond. Perfect for me.

Followed the recipe pretty exactly. Used no-sugar-added almond milk. I didn't have the "good" kale handy (Tuscan style) so I can only imagine that with quality kale it'll be even better.

I followed the recipe except I didn't have chia seeds and I had unsweetened almond coconut milk on hand. My banana wasn't frozen but I didn't add any ice and I liked the consistency. This had a great flavor and kept me full. I will definitely make again!
