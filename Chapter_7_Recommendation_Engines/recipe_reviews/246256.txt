I made these or Superbowl just as the video shows. They came out fantastic, but the mixing of the dough with the eggs got very hard. My second time around, I put the dough in my Kitchenaid and beat the eggs separately in a small bowl before incorporating. Much easier. Love this recipe, and so do my guests.

I need 10 stars for this one!  We love everything"popper" so had to try this. I did make a change by adding some chopped onion and had no white cheddar, so used mild yellow cheddar. Followed the video instructions and had no trouble incorporating the eggs. I did let the mixed ingredients sit overnight in the fridge and, after forming the balls, I put them in the freezer to set up better for deep frying. This will allow me to keep them on hand too, for those times you just have to have an emergency popper puff!

I have made numerous Chef John recipes that turned out to be fantastic. Unfortunately this was the one I was unhappy with.
The flavor of the poppers themselves were good. I made these for a work party and I received nothing but compliments.
However, I thought the dipping sauce could have been more flavorful. I added some extra seasoning of my own, but I think the poppers are fine without the effort of the dip.
I was frustrated with the number of poppers this made. The recipe states it makes 8 servings, but doesn't specify what a serving is. I ended up with 15, which isn't bad, but...
...I was further agitated because after making everything as directed, which was very labor intensive and took significantly longer than I expected, the first 4 I fried were immediately burnt, despite heating the oil to the instructed temp. I ended up letting the oil get down to about 325 for the remainder of the poppers which turned out great, but I still had 4 wasted.
So after a long time I ended up with just 11 that I could take to my coworkers. Again, the flavor was good, but for 11 it was just not worth the effort. If I make these again I'll be prepared to double the recipe, not get the oil so hot, and either leave the dip or just buy pre-made from the store.

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great!  Some were a little doughy on the inside so I will adjust the temperature next time.  I like them better with the dipping sauce (which you have to get the recipe from foodwishes.com).   I did add salt and cayenne to the sauce because I thought it was a little bland.  I actually put the dipping sauce in a sandwich bag, cut the tip off the corner and piped it over the puffs so people could just grab one and go.  Worked great.

I made these to take to a cocktail party.  I fried them right before I left and covered them with foil.  They were still a little warm when I got there and were a huge hit.  Even those that don't like spicy enjoyed them.  I didn't see the need for the lime juice in the sauce, so I left that out.

I made a big mistake which I will not repeat. I made them ahead of time and instead of warming them in one layer on a cookie sheet in the oven at high temperature, I warmed them in a covered dish. Instead of being crisp as they were originally, they came out soft and spongy. Lesson learned, but a delicious recipe.

I LOVE all of Ched John’s recipes. However, this one fell flat with the whole family. It set up and came out the way it should, thus the 3 stars. They weren’t horrible, just not what I had imagined they’d be like.

I first saw this made in Chef John's delightful video and decided to make it Christmas day. I must have been confused somewhere because I only used three strips of bacon and not 1/3 cup. They were still delicious and well-received, but I think more bacon would have put them over the top for yumminess. We enjoyed them with our favorite beer and my husband said we must have them every year. I'm considering adding a bit of chopped red pepper for a little holiday festive color.

I've been making jalapeno poppers for years (halved jalapeno, cream cheese and bacon on top, bake). This took things to a whole new level, though! I was very excited to make these on Thanksgiving. The one thing I did differently was using a food processor to mix the bacon and jalapeno chunks. I hoped it would give a better all around flavor to the dough, and avoid the "black marks", as Chef John put it. I wasn't disappointed, though it didn't really give a full flavor to the balls like I thought. Next time I would just do the standard dicing and mixing. I like mine spicy, so I'd probably double the jalapeno.

TL;DR: Delicious and worth the time to make!

I made these as directed. I had to add quite a bit of items to the "dip" to make it work. Even without the dip the poppers were not very flavorful. Again, I had to doctor them up quite a bit and they were still extremely disappointing.

I thought these were pretty easy to make, and I wasn't disappointed with the output. I guess it just depends on how big the balls you roll are.  Mine were a little smaller than a ping pong ball.  I felt they lacked that cheesy punch, and made a few with the dough wrapped around a piece of cheese. I would definitely make them again that way. I just used Tzatziki with a bit of spice added to it for kick. should've used the lime!

They were good, but you have to eat them fresh. Don't let them sit on the buffet table. Also there was way too much dip. I threw the leftovers into a spinach artichoke dip.

I made these to use up some jalapenos from the garden and to experiment and see if I want to make a large amount to put in the freezer. They got rave reviews from my family, who all said they prefer them to regular jalapeno poppers. I would have liked them a little more spicy, but my family liked them just the way they were. (Could just be the peppers, too, but there is a lot of room to make these more or less spicy to one's liking.) I didn't bother making the sauce this time, but it sounds good and I will try it in the future. The puffs were great even without the sauce. I do plan to take an afternoon to make a very large amount to store in the freezer.

AMAZING!! I love the taste of the puffs  - just perfect! My husband is not a popper fan and was worried these would be too spicy as well. He told me to make them again. Highest compliment! Chef John, another wonderful recipe. Thank you once again!

Making this is rather labor intensive.  I will probably make it again, but I will leave a little bit of seed from the jalapeños to give it a little bit of a kick.  They were rather bland, so filling them would be better..  Not really impressed.

These are fantastic. Made exactly per recipe. Froze them for about 30 minutes then fried. And contrary to Chef John video comment, they are beautiful. Based on another comment that these are similar to Brazilian Coxinha (Chicken Croquettes), now I am off on another foodie venture. Thanks Chef John.

Forgot to take the picture before we gobbled them up.  Super delicious, I highly recommend this recipe.  In the future I would like to try piping the dip into them.

Yum,yum, yum!! Made these tonight for super bowl and they were good.  Even my 8 year old liked them.

I followed the recipe as written.  The outside was crispy and light, inside was a little doughy - maybe I didn't fry them long enough.
