This definitely is "easy" and a very basic recipe for classic egg salad.  I do like the idea of using fat free plain yogurt, but make sure it's Greek or you'll end up with that horrible "fat free dairy product" aftertaste.  I did take a little liberty with this and added a splash of yellow mustard and since there's something to be said for mayo in an egg salad I opted to add a couple of Tbsp. of Hellman's light mayo. If you want a little crunch you could also add in a little chopped celery or green onion. I mix the "dressing" separately and mix it with the eggs so the flavors blend better.  I also opted to sprinkle the paprika over top vs. in the salad to avoid any discoloration.  Overall, very tasty on toasted whole grain bread.

I thought my kids would not be able to tell that I used greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise but they totally busted me. The kids still ate it as I have a strict rule "eat it or go hungry". For me, it wasn't bad though I missed the basics that are usually in egg salad, like chopped celery and chopped onion. Not a bad recipe, but it just wasn't the one for us.

This is really very good if you use a good quality Greek yogurt.

I wanted to like this recipe, but the sour yogurt taste was too much for me.

I made this recipe, but I used mayonnaise in place of the yogurt, and added some horseradish. It's not as healthy, but I really liked it, and super easy!

I added more paprika to see if would add flavor. Removed it from my favorite list.
