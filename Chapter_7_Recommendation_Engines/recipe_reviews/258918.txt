9.8.17  Cut back on the sugar (personal taste preference) and would have liked a little more of the watermelon flavor.  But that’s easy enough to fix.  Next time I’ll just add a bit more watermelon.  Very refreshing.

I also added mint and used honey as suggested instead of sugar. Very refreshing!

I made this for a birthday party everyone thought it was amazing. I did substitute 1 cup of stevia for the sugar to lower carbs
