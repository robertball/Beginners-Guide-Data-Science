Very good. I wasn't able to find undyed herring, but it didn't make any difference. I added a little buttermilk for a bit of a 'twang.' Thanks!

We made this dish identically over here in Maine, but call it haddock stew instead. This is just how it should be made - simple, and it's the best comfort food you can think of! At least for us on the North Atlantic coast!

Absolutely top class, great recipe, I must say the best I ever had was on a trip back to Scotland.
We stayed at the Cuillin Hills Hotel on Skye, the chef's Cullen Skink was to die for,,,I can still taste it.
This recipe is very close, I believe the difference could be rich cream in the chef's recipe.
How I wish I could buy smoked haddock here in central B.C. no such thing available and although I have persevered there really is no substitute at all.

Fantastic. I will add pickles next time. The fish needs less than 15 min to be done and I have added extra milk.

Had no smoked haddock, nor smoked anything. Had caught some Maryland rockfish this summer that was abiding in the freezer, and it did the job. The soup would benefit from some smoke. I usually have liquid smoke, but that was out, too. I put a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce in, and that helped.  Otherwise, a simple recipe and good for a chilly evening.  Will make it again.

This is so simple, and incredible! Simplicity is beauty. I used smoked salmon in place of the haddock, whole milk, and three cloves of garlic chopped and added raw at the blender stage. I will do this again and again. Smoked trout? Use haddock, but add leeks? Hmm...

Everyone who really tried this in my family loved it. Granted we made some modifications. We used flounder and smoke favoring. We also added about 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese. This was still amazing and fairly simple.

I added a 1/2 cup more of milk and when it was cooked after tasting it, heavily added seafood seasoning.  I didn't blend it or add basil.  It was creamy, chunky and tasty.

I couldn't find smoked so I used regular and added Worcestershire sauce and garlic. I also added a mix of muenster and asiago cheese as garnish. It was really good.
