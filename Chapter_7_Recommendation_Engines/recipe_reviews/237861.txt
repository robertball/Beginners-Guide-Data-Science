This sounds wonderful, but you forgot to mention how much tea to put into the recipe -- or is the mint used instead of traditional tea leaves? Thank you.

I made this exactly as written up to the point where I should have put it in the freezer. I made a much smaller quantity using 2 litres of water in all and 85 grams of fresh Moroccan mint leaves. It isn't a syrup, nor is it a concentrate. For the mint/water ratio it is quite light. I ended up serving it cooled to room temperature as a drink, as is. If you were to dilute it anymore, then it would simply be lightly flavoured sweet water. It tasted nice for a refreshing drink. I allowed it to steep longer than 15 minutes too. I think as an ice pop this would be nice during the summer. There is no tea but maybe it could be called a herbal infusion. Thank you octoberpumpkin00 for sharing your recipe.

Very refreshing! Had to dilute it quite a bit for my taste but I love it!
