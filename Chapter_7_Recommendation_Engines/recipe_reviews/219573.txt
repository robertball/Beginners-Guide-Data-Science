This was a great way to whip up a short-notice dinner. For the vegetables, I just threw in what I had on hand - fresh carrots, onions and bell pepper. I put the carrots in with the rice so they would cook through, and added the onion and pepper about 8 minutes before the rice was done. I also improvised with the cheese (didn't have cheddar) so I shredded some mozzarella and asiago, and also added some grated parmesan. It turned out pretty good!

This had awesome flavor & I LOVED how SIMPLE it was and that it only used ONE pan!!! My husband could not get enough, and neither could my 2 year old! I made it just as the recipe said but next time I would do a few things differently. I would cube the chicken while the rice was cooking then just mix the chicken and the cheese in. The chicken just seemed to be more of a side dish, being so big. We were cutting that way anyway. I used frozen mixed veggies and just put them in when I started the rice, they were perfectly cooked by the end. Others have suggested cayenne pepper or chiles, I think that would be awesome, will try it next time, especially the cayenne. That would really boost the flavor!!

This recipe is decent and comforting. I added smoked paprika and cayenne because I knew it would be bland. I also browned the heck out of the meat to boost flavor - used pork cutlets because I didn't have any chicken on hand. From the canned soup, I knew it would be salty, so I didn't salt the meat beforehand and was a little sad about that. The frozen vegetables made it taste a little weird - using fresh would probably be better. It's a decent recipe if you're strapped for time and want a really rib-sticking meal. I did appreciate the one-skillet approach to save on dishes.

Loved this recipe. Looking for something different for chicken. I did change a couple of things. 1) Grilled the chicken for 15 mins per side. 2) I didn't have Cream of chicken or mixed veggies. I used Cream of Mushroom and frozen broccoli, cooked these as stated. Will keep trying different soup/veggie combos

My family loved this and I loved that it was all made in one dish! 
I made a few modifications based on what I had and our tastes:
1.cut the breasts into 4oz servings and seasoned them well with McCormicks Montreal Chicken seasoning, paprika, salt & pepper before frying them
2. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil
3. Doubled the liquid (half water & half chicken broth) and used egg noodles instead of rice
4. I didn't have frozen mixed veggies so I made my own blend with what I had - peas, carrots & broccoli
Yumm! What a great recipe. Definitely going into my rotation!

I made this receipe when I needed something quick.  This was easy to make.  It wasn't outstanding however, it was good.  I gave it 3 stars for this particular receipe.  I will make it again with a few of my own additions such as garlic or maybe those green chilies.  It was easy.

It is a little bit bland, so spicing it is important! Its a go to meal when I just don't have the time to do anything big for dinner. I have made it about 7 times, this last time made me the most impressed -- my 15 month old who hates chicken and hates broccoli, had noooo problem eating either of those things in this dish.  I add garlic powder, onion powered, salt and lots of black pepper. I have tried cream of chicken soup and cream of broccoli soup -- either one works. I slice the chicken into strips before I cook it (cooks faster) then I let the rice and broccoli cook until almost done, put the strips on top of the rice and then sprinkle it with cheese, put the top on the pan and let the cheese melt.
