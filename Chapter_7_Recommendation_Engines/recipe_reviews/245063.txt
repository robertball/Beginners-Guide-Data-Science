good flavor but way too much quinoa and tofu for the amount of liquid.. either cut back on those items or double the liquid - at least. My photo was after I had doubled the liquid. otherwise it was a nice quinoa side dish but all the liquid had been absorbed. Kale has a bitter edge to it so I always add some heat.. dried red pepper flakes some cayenne.. I recommend adding that
