This was awesome!!  I've been using the store bought seasoning for as long I've been cooking and I won't be buying that anymore.  I didn't change a thing except using garlic powder as I didn't have dried "minced" on hand.  It was the perfect mix of flavors.  Not too spicy, even with the cayenne.  Thank you!!

I made this using ground turkey and I went lighter on the salt. This was okay, not our favorite taco-seasoned meat but passable for nacho meat. After tasting it, I did add more spices.

This was very good and nice to have this recipe on hand when I realized I didnt have a taco seasoning packet. For the "one star" review about the waaaaayyy too much salt.  Dont use as much. Pretty simple. Problem solved.

This tasted better than the taco package mix I usually use. I was skeptical wether my seven year old grandson would like this because of the red and cayenne peppers but he loved it. He liked that it was a bit spicy and so did I. I will definitely be making this again.

Just an added comment: after the water evaporated I added some taco sauce and let it simmer down. It was even better than before.

This was a great starting point for me when my son said, "mom, I want tacos." I chopped up shallots and garlic and cooked in a little homemade chicken stock. I added the beef and when browned I added the seasonings listed in the recipe (excluding salt, onion and garlic). Then to amp it up a bit I added fire roasted tomatoes and red kidney beans until the ratio looked good. I used chicken stock instead of water. When it cooked down I added fresh cilantro. 
I know in the end I changed the recipe a lot, but it was a much better base than the mixes.

This made great beef tostadas and burritos. As written this would have been too spicy for some of my diners so I cut the crushed red pepper and the cayenne pepper in half, skipped the salt instead using a cube of chicken boullion in with double the water, and subbed onion powder for the minced dried. I will use this easy recipe again. Thanks for posting.

Our family is kind of taco snobs and really detest packet seasonings.  Everyone raved about this one! Very, very good, a keeper my hubby said. May want to reduce the peppers if cooking for kids, but perfect medium spice for an adult.

Wow!  This is a keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly (hate those reviews when they tweak it) with the exception of the cayenne powder (optional) as I had an old bottle.  I will add it next time but liked it without it.  This is so easy to do - why buy the packaged?  Plus, don't know if anyone else has experienced this but I find no matter what brand I buy of the packaged that there is a moldy taste.  I've tried figuring out what seasoning is causing that.  I didn't detect that taste of mold with this homemade.  This is a little spicy but I like a little heat.  I use some avocado, sour cream, & mild taco sauce with my burritos, tacos, etc. so that reduces the heat. I will certainly keep a small batch made up in my pantry so it's ready to use although it only took a minute to mix it up.

I normally do not like tacos. The seasoning is always old tasting. This was awesome with the fresh spices.
The cayenne pepper gave it a little tiny kick it was perfect. My husband and his best friend ate ever last bite!

This was really yummy! I didn't have any corn starch or cayenne pepper and it still turned out good. Tasted much better than pre-packaged seasoning. My husband and 2yr. old ate it all up.

I was skeptical, but the seasoning mix in this recipe really does taste a lot like a taco seasoning packet. I didn't have cornstarch, so instead of the water I used about half a can of tomato sauce. I added a little more salt than called for to counteract the sweetness of the tomato sauce. I let it simmer until it was thickened. I think I'm going to make my taco meat like this from now on. Oh, and I used turkey, and you couldn't tell it wasn't beef!

This recipe turned out great! I planned family taco night and didn't have a taco mix packet. My kids said it was better than the packet. I didn't have dried minced garlic. Instead of using fresh, I substituted with garlic powder.

This is okay; it has some flavor, but it's just too bland for us. I ended up doubling the cumin, oregano, garlic and corn starch. And I added some paprika and a pinch of sugar. Then it was great.

This mix is great! I made it last night for my husband, brother-in-law, and I. We all loved it! I had taco seasoning packets at home but wanted to try to make my own. Tastes much better!! I added two teaspoons of fresh minced garlic because I didn't have dry. I also put in a few dashes of garlic powder. It tasted great. The crushed red peppers really bring it up a notch. Along with the cayenne pepper. Yum!!

Great beginnings with a lot of ad lib to it.  Never go back to store bought.
Used real onion and garlic.  Swapped out the chili flakes for 1/2 finely diced jalapeno.  Sauteed the onion, garlic and jalapeno with the ground beef.  Added some hot sauce to the 1/2 cup water and voila, better than restaurant quality.
The fresh ingredients made it so good!  Added  extra flavour and a heat that snuck up on you but was not overpowering.  Just flavour packed.

Love this recipe. Used flour rather than cornstarch and Italian seasoning rather than oregano (who runs out of oregano??).  We use wheat tortillas always rather than the corn. 

Love the fact the sodium is much lower than using the envelope seasoning.

I used fresh onion (1/4) and one clove of garlic. This is the recipe I’ve been searching for! Delicious! And the salt was JUST RIGHT! But a good rule of thumb is the put in less and add more as needed if you are not a saltaholic !

I have made this several times.  It is an easy alternative to store bought mix. My only changes are to use 1/4 cup fresh minced onion and 1-2 minced garlic cloves instead of dried, cooked with the meat; and to double the seasoning when using ground turkey.

I’ve made this at least 5 times. 
Everyone loves it (that includes people aged: 2, 10, 13, 38, 52, and 75- so I feel like that is a representative sample).
I typically cook low sodium meals, so I cut the salt in half, and the tacos come out great. I’ve made this with beef and with turkey and my family always loves it.

Spices are perfect!!  My hubby loved it.  It's nice having a homemade taco seasoning.  Will definitely make again.
Thank you for sharing!

I made the recipe exactly except I used fresh onions and garlic. It came out very bland for me and I ended up doubling everything and adding green chilies. If I hadn't added more I don't think my husband would've liked it. This recipe is a good starting point for ratios but it's definitely a tweak for preference type recipe.

I have made this about  a hundred times. It's spicy, quick, and so good! I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp because I thought 1 was a little much and turns out great every time.

I used Angus meat that had no grease. Hot & spicy is not something I eat often. But this I'll eat any time! Awesome recipe! Thank you.

Ground Beef w/ Homemade Taco Seasoning Haiku: "This tasted okay. It could use some jazzing up. But we love tacos!" This was a nice, lightly-seasoned taco meat that meant using alot more cheese, salsa, and mixed veggie toppings when it came to building our taco plates (I prefer tostadas or lettuce boats myself) AR's "Taco Seasoning I" still reigns supreme here, but I'm glad to have tried this out - any reason to not use the store-bought packets!

we have made this a few times, and since we love a spicier flavor, we doubled all of the spiced and used fresh onion and garlic (basically omitted the need for the water) and the taco meat is delish!!  We actually crave it and it is so fast and yummy!

Good flavor; we mixed in half a thinly sliced white onion and diced yellow, red, and green peppers while browning the meat, and used a little bit of salsa with the water.

Great spice for tacos! Hell yes!!  I will more than likely use this for other applications as well calling for a taco style seasoning mix. ** It was a bit on the spicy side, but not so hot that I didn't want more.  Ole!

Much to bland for us.  I kept adding salt, pepper, chili powder, etc. and couldn't find the right blend.  I'm going back to Penzey's taco seasoning.

I forgot to buy a taco seasoning packet at the grocery store and didn't have the means to go out and get it. This recipe made a great go to, because I had most of the ingredients in my kitchen and only substituted the dry onions and garlic for fresh onions and garlic. It was tasty and really hit the spot.

This was good. I felt like it was a little lacking in flavor. I admittedly only put in half the chili flakes as the bf doesn't like too much heat, but I still thought it needed a little more flavor. Maybe a little tomato paste? I would make this again but will play with it a little. A couple of tips: I made the meat with all the spices earlier in the day so the flavors could develop. I think this helps (just leave it in the pan and reheat later. Saves time at the end of the day too!). This especially works for the salt and hot spices. Go a little easy on both if you're worried about it, and add more later if you want to. Amazing how beautifully the flavors blend and develop. Again, this was good. Just need to tailor it to your own tastes I think. Regardless, it is A THOUSAND times better than that store bought, envelope stuff!  Not sorry I made this at all. Thank you!

Simple and tasty. I used all the ingredients except I didn't use Cumin because we're not a huge fan of it. Instead of making tacos, I made beef enchiladas. I made my own salsa (recipe from Allrecipes). I put some oil on the bottom of a 9 X 13 inch dish. After the seasoned meat was done, I mixed it with refried beans and then spooned about 3 tbl of it onto a flour tortilla. I sprinkled a nice helping of Pepper Monterey Jack Cheese on top.  Rolled up the filled tortillas and placed them in the dish. I made 8 enchiladas. I then poured some of the salsa on top of the tortillas and sprinkled Mexican Cheese Mix on top. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes and my guys couldn't stop raving about it. This is definitely a keeper!

Absolutely my go to, but way too salty.  I eliminate the salt and find it outstanding.  Make it once a week on taco night...

Everyone loved it! Much better than the store-bought packets!
It's a bit spicy with the cayenne pepper, but soooo good!!

I made these tacos exactly like the recipe minus the Cayanne pepper because I didn’t have any. They were really flavorful and easy. The cracked red pepper gave them a nice little zing.  I will make these again.

This is absolutely the best ever.  I will never use package seasoning again.  It takes so little time to put it together.  My husband loves the extra "kick" it gives.

Kids & partner approved. Only substitutions I made was to skip the cornstarch and trade 8oz can of tomato sauce for the water. We served with yellow rice and typical taco fixins (lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, shredded cheese).

I made this for lunch. It was very delicious great flavors. I had to substitute the minced onion for onion powder, I also added garlic powder, black pepper and minced jalapeños while cooking. Topped it off with mild cheddar cheese, sour cream, and salsa verde.

I'm trying to avoid seasoning packets with undesirable ingredients. This was good. I rated at a 4 star only because I needed to modify the recipe: I omitted the red pepper flakes and corn starch. I added a can of low/no sodium diced tomatoes, and 1 can of low/no sodium pinto or black beans (rinsed & mashed). Works good with ground turkey or ground beef.

Great recipe to follow...I doubled the recipe, but felt that I still needed to add more cumin. I like a lot of flavor in my food! I also sauteed green pepper and onion with cumin, salt, and pepper, and added it to the meat. It was a great addition!

I found the seasoning ratio as is to be a little too bland, so I increased the chili powder to 1 tbsp and cumin and garlic to 1 tsp. Used chicken broth in place of the water. A decent alternative to super market seasoning packets.

Very good!  Will definitely become part of our regular meals.  I halved the salt and cayenne pepper . Next time will make it 3/4 strength.  Didn't have any cumin.  Didn't use the cornstarch.  Added cooked rice to absorb some of the liquid and then used the meat/rice mixture inside burritos with added cheese, tomatoes, green onion and shredded lettuce.  YUM!

This recipe is a winner! I also used it as a rub(minus the water) on a sirloin steak to make carne asada and it was quite tasty. Recipe works for steak and ground beef. My friends were quite impressed with it, too. You can minus the cayenne pepper if sensitive to spicy things.

This was the best Tacos!  We normally use flour tortillas but I wanted to try the corn tortillas.  Instead of using the list of spices, I seasoned the ground beef with some leftover chili seasoning mix. Topped with couple of diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, and some locally-made salsa, and it was great!

My kids and I love this recipe! It's quick and easy and they 
love helping mix all the the ingredients. We substitute the ground beef for ground turkey and leave out the red pepper flakes so it's not too spicy for them. 
We've made it a few times and it's always been a hit. 
I own a spice company and love trying out all the herbs and spices in different dishes to ensure I sell great quality products to all my customers.

It was awesome the first time. I think next time, I might not level off the measuring spoons so much. I like a lil more spice. Cheers.

I made the taco seasoning but made a couple of changes. Instead of the minced dried onions I used real onions finely minced. I also added real chopped garlic instead of dried garlic. I cooked the ground beef and added onions and cooked it then added the half cup of water. I added the ground beef to fresh lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese and red taco sauce. They were delicious my husband filled three soft taco shells. Easy to make great for a week no

Really great combo of spices for Tacos. I've tried a bunch of recipes for taco seasoning and I always end up tweaking it. This one didn't need much. I did use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and I left out the corn starch. You can either drain the fat off the meat (and therefore not need the thickener), or you can just eat them the sloppy way! This would be a great recipe to use to make your own pre-made taco seasoning mix!

Love the home-made taco seasoning mix. It's great to keep on hand. I really prefer to make my own spice mixes to control the contents. Thanks for this post!

This was an excellent starting point for our taco seasoning. It was so much better than the packaged seasoning!  I used fresh garlic and onion, omitted the cayenne, substituted about 1/8 tsp ground red pepper instead of red pepper flakes and started with half of the other seasonings.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I've used this recipe several times for tacos.  I sometimes use an Italian blend instead of oregano, if only because that's what I might have on hand at the time.  I find it's quite easy to tailor this to my family's spiciness tolerance by altering and/or eliminating the cayenne, chili powder, and red pepper.  My next step is to make this in bulk so it's easy to just dump several tsps. in with the meat and not have to measure every time.

I don't make tacos too often, but my wife suggested we do just that. This seasoning is spot on. Used a little less salt and added some chipotle powder for an extra kick and flavor while  adding bold smokiness. 
I don't ever drain the fat and grease from the beef since I use grass fed beef and the flavors and nutrients are an added bonus. It absorbed the seasoning into the beef even better that way. Still added some water to keep it moister longer. 
Great recipe, paired well with a poblano lime dressing I made as well, with a strip of queso, cilantro, red onion, tomato and lettuce.

Too much chili powder.  Left out red pepper flakes & cayenne because it's too hot for us.  I eventually reduced the chili powder giving it a better flavor & smoked paprika gave it a wonderful flavor.  I didn't have dehydrated onions so 
I added fresh onion to the burger while cooking it.

I make this seasoning in large quantities because I have a son who doesn't like cumin, so I omit the cumin.  No unnecessary ingredients like in the packages.

And add cilantro :)

I prepared this spice blend but used with vegan ground "beef".  Other than cutting the salt in half (which was plenty) I didn't change much else and it was delicious!

So yummy. Way better than store bought packets. Added a can of black beans, 1/2 cup corn and 1/2 cup peas to the beef to make it stretch just a bit further.

I made it last night for taco Tuesday and I did use the cayenne pepper! Not spicy at all!!

I did substitite the minced onion and garlic for regular powdered onion and garlic because that's all I had in my spice cabinet but it worked and the husband and I absolutely loved it! 

At first I was nervous to use all of the seasoning because I used a small amount of meat being that there were just two of us eating so I gradually added the mixture it ended up using all of it anyway. Delicious recipe! Thank you!

Didn't make,any changes as I am just learning how to cook.  Best to stick to recipes for now.   We recently moved from LA so ate a lot of Mexican food over time and these tacos,were very good.  Also, leftovers heat up well.  Will be making them again

GREAT RECIPE! I'm a newlywed, and my husband is pretty underwhelmed by packaged taco seasoning, so I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. 

While mixing it up, I really felt that it smelled just like the seasoning I buy at the grocery store, and hubs agreed. However, because I mixed it up by hand, I knew exactly what to change. Turns out neither of us cares for cumin! So I replaced the cumin in this recipe for chipotle chile (same measurements), and we were both thrilled! 

Once the meat was done, we got out the tortillas and cheese and made beef quesadillas - his topped with lettuce and sour cream, and mine with lettuce and guacamole. Holy cow was that good! Delicious subtle flavor, and just a mild slow burn after swallowing.  We both agreed that this recipe will be going into our recipe rotation!

I thought the cayenne and red peooer would make it too hot but it was just right.

Didn't add the cayenne and used flour instead of cornstarch. Awesome! It is better then a recipe I have used for years (I couldn't find it). I am thankful for Allrecipes, love that I can get reviews before I try!

I made bigger than normal tacos, I barely got 7 tacos out of this recipe. I haven't used packaged taco seasoning in years since I found recipes on here. My favorite is Homemade Taco Seasoning Mix by KathyESG.

Made this for the first time, so followed the recipe exactly - this was great! Next time, I'm going to omit the salt completely-- you really don't need it with all the other seasonings. Got the big thumbs up from everyone. Will never buy pre-made again!

This was was so much better than the packaged taco mix in the stores. I served this wrapped in flour tortillas with shredded lettuce, salsa & sour cream - excellent! Thanks so much for this simple recipe that makes such a difference!

This is a great recipe to keep on hand.  It mixes up quickly, tastes good and no chemicals added like the store bought.  I will reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon next time.   If you use dry garlic and onion powders, you can mix up several batches of just the mix and store in small snack bags for future use - depends on often you eat tacos.

I like fresh ingredients in as much as possible, so, I used fresh minced garlic and chopped white onions.  I eliminated the cornstarch and replaced it with 1/4 C of catsup and 1/4 C of taco sauce.  I followed the list of dry ingredients and it all came out all right.  Used toasted corn tortillas.  Instead of lettuce, I used shredded cabbage.  It gives the dish another texture.  Try it!  Had several people requesting the recipe.

My family doesn't take the heat well, so I only used half the cayenne, no cumin and just a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. I also used fresh chopped garlic and onion. My wife and and I loved it! We'll definitely be using this again! I hate using the store bought stuff because it's so salty. This was just right!

Really good with ground beef or shredded chicken.  I omit the cumin - husband doesn't like it and it is still good.  I also omit the cornstarch and just simmer until the water evaporates.

Very tasty. Followed the recipe but used sautéed real onion instead of dried, and also added a can of diced tomatoes.  However I agree with some reviewers that it is too salty.  This is surprising because I am a salt fiend, which is why I didn't cut back on the salt initially.  Next time I will use half as much salt and take it from there.

I'd been using store bought taco mix for as long as I can remember.  I only sought this recipe to avoid going to the store JUST for taco mix - I'm glad I did!  This mix worked out perfectly with ground turkey.  My only omission was the cilantro.

I love this taco seasoning recipe. I actually make the seasoning in bulk by changing the servings to 100. It fits perfectly in a pint size mason jar.

Have used this Taco meat recipe many times.  I use every ingredient and it is perfect.  If out of dried onion or dried minced garlic  I substitute  fresh chopped onion and garlic,  adding it  to the ground beef  while it cooks.  For a bit of extra zing I often add fresh green, red or yellow bell pepper.  I much prefer this recipe to prepared store brands.  Thanks for a fun recipe.  Rico

Very good recipe though I did 1/2 teaspoon of salt, as 1 teaspoon seemed like too much. It turned out just right. I also added 1 clove of fresh minced garlic to the meat as I cooked it since I love more garlicy flavor in my tacos.
