This dish tastes awesome, but you do have to make some changes.  First of all, I cooked the rice in the rice cooker first and I decreased the amount of ground beef, and the cans of tomato soup.  Lastly, I used regular cheddar instead of velveeta.

This recipe is just not right.  Where do I start--First of all, it calls for a 1 qt baking dish.  This is impossible considering it calls for 3 cans of soup which is almost a quart in itself.  I made the recipe tonight and didn't find it anything special.  There is way too much chili powder.  Rice cannot be properly cooked using 1 cup water to 1 cup rice.  There should be 2 cups of water.  I feel I wasted food tonight.

We really enjoyed this with the personal adjustments. It's a great idea, which is why I gave it a shot. I have a rice cooker, so I cooked 2 c of rice. While the rice was cooking I sauted red onion (half salted)and garlic (3 cloves), then the lb of beef. I seasoned the beef with cajun & montreal steak seasoning. Instead of tom.soup I used 6oz Ragu and 5T of restaurant stlye salsa and eye-balled the chili powder. In place of the Velveta I used real colby/jack, american, and provolone. Then, yes and then I topped it off with French's french fried onions.

This does have a pretty nice taste to it. I made it for my husband and myself one Sunday night when we wanted something quick and tasty. We used ground turkey instead of beef and liked the way that turned out- however, I love cheese and I think next time I might ad twice as much. Just wasn't quite enough for me. Also, didn't fit in a 1 Qt casserole- I had to use my 2 Qt.

Had to adjust some of the measurements. Used Sharp chedder cheese and added garlic powder. It was easy and my whole family LOVED it. Had leftovers last night and my husband calls from work today and says"I don't care what you girls eat for dinner tonight, but the rest og the beef and rice is mine." :-)

I adapted this a little differently by substituting a cup of salsa for one can of tomato sauce, and adding peppers and onions to the hamburger while cooking. Topped with taco cheese blend and crushed tortilla chips. My very picky 5 year old loved it, so it was a success!

this was a good base but I made some changes, added a diced medium onion, used 2 lbs hamburger, 4 cups cooked rice, and shredded cheese. I added some brown sugar to the tomato and beef mixture and not as much chili as called for. Used 3 cans of tomato soup.  Kids liked it, will def make again, quick and easy!

This was very good.  I added more rice and only two cans of soup.  I also added onions and garlic and used chedder instead of velveeta.  We will definitely make this again.

This recipe is an excellent base, which is what I generally look for in a recipe anyway. I doubled the rice, which should always be cooked in a 2:1 water rice ratio. So 4 cups of water to 2 cups of white basmati rice. 

Then I sauteed some diced onions and minced garlic, added the ground beef and seasoned the whole thing. This is very important. Even when a recipe doesn't ask  tell you to season a meat ingredient DO IT ANYWAY. Seriously, you will be rewarded with a very flavorful results. 

The last changes I made were to use two cans of soup and two tbs of the chili powder. Everything else was cooked according to the recipe. Simple and delicious. Next time I'll add some red beans to the meat mixture and some sliced jalapeno peppers on top.

This was very tasty, but only because of recommended modifications. Ignore the 1:1 rice water unless you are using minuet rice. Seasoned the meat with 1/2 onion, 1/2 red bell pepper, 2 garlics and 2 celery. I added 8 oz of cream cheese and a small jar of con caso into the meat/rice/soup mix (layers did not seem practical). Added one can tomato bisque soup, one can stewed tomatoes, and a few diced jalapenos. Topped with just a bit of mild cheddar. Everyone in the family loved it!

This was terrible! My family and I were trying out new recipes this month, and I saw that this had good ratings. So it sounded good... Its not! I my have put too much cheese on it or something, i dont know. It just was really creamy and cheesy to the point that you couldnt taste anything else. Velveeta is not my idea of a good snack to only taste the velveeta! Unless you want a VERY high calorie meal with nothing but cheese...

I made this but substituted Classico Fire Roasted Tomato and Garlic pasta sauce for tomato soup...cooked the rice according to the packaging, used sharp cheddar cheese instead of velveeta and omitted the chili powder...spiced up the beef with garlic while browning it too.  Nice cheep meal  for the week as I am alone for 3 more months.

i gave this 5 stars because it was a good idea.  I cut back on the chilie powder because we don't like it that spicey.  I used my head and cooked the rice in my rice cooker using the measurements for my rice cooker.  

For those people who didn't like this because it was too spicey, you have to season to taste.  As the beef is cooking add a bit of spice, let it cook some, taste it,  if its good, then fine if not add a bit more. 

Over all it was good inexpensive idea. I made changes to the way we eat, but I did enjoy the recipe.

I used real shreded cheddar cheese and 2 cups of rice - yes definitely need a 2 qt dish.  Plus, I sauteed meat with onions and garlic for added flavor and used ground turkey.  I loved it!  It turned out really well.

Thumbs up....is what I got from my daughter and that is a good thing. :)  I did some minor adjustments.  I cut down on the chili powder and added onion powder, garlic powder, and beef seasoning.  I also used shredded cheddar cheese vs the slices.  I will definitely make it again. 4 stars due to adjustments necessary.

And used Chedder Cheese. it tastes way better the 1 qrt pan is a little small but it works. over all its a good dish. its easy to twist to your own liking but its a good basic start to some very good meal ideas thanks for posting it.

I used this recipe, as suggested by AR-Seattle, and changed out the ground beef for Johnsonville spicey Italian sausage to complete one of my AR Ambassador's monthly tasks. Since I used Italian sausage, I changed out the chili powder to 1 tbsp ground basil and the Velveeta cheese slices to 8 ozs. grated mozzarella. Based on the other reviews, I used only two cans of Campbell's tomato soup and 1/2 cup water. While I was very skeptical of this recipe, it really was tasty. It kind of "grew" on me as I ate. My husband said that he wouldn't mind having it again. We'll see. Change out the spicey to mild Italian sausage and this would be a good kid-friendly meal.

Who doesn't like cheese, rice and ground beef?! With a few adjustments as recommended by other reviewers..This dish was scrumptious!! I sautéed minced garlic and onion before adding the ground beef.I made my rice in the slow cooker. I used only 1 can of Tomato Soup(I think next time I will use 2 cans next time) and I used Sharp Cheddar Cheese..Lots of cheese! I also seasoned it with a little garlic salt and pepper! Easy peasey dish!

This is pretty good.  I have a similiar recipe that uses elbow macaroni instead of rice, which I prefer.  I used only two cans of soup and cheddar cheese.  I think I'll stick with the macaroni version - but this is good, fast & easy if you like rice.  Otherwise, try it with the macaroni.

This was a satisfying recipe.  To please my family of 6 is quite a feat, but this simple recipe fit the bill.  I made the following changes:  First, I had to double the rice and beef, but it fits well in a deep 13x9 pan.  Also, I only used 2 cans of tomato soup and added one can of Rotel Tomatoes, Mexican flavored with cilantro and lime.  I omitted the chili powder.  Also, instead of Velveeta, I used sharp cheddar.  Very easy to make.  My husband hates casseroles or anything that is a "one dish" meal, but he actually complimented this one!  So, being desperate and using what I had on hand worked into a pleasing meal for my family.  Thanks!

It was cleanout the fridge day and low and behold, I had leftover brown rice, ground bef, and tomato soup to use up.  Halved recipe (except rice - ended up using about 3 cups cooked) - I was fully prepared with standby dinner as I simply didn't think this was going to work.  But it was GREAT!  Used cheddar cheese instead of processed, 1 can of soup, and 1T of chili powder.  I truly enjoyed.  Tasted a bit like a tamale pie dish.  UPDATE:  deleting as John 'fessed he didn't like.

I used brown minute rice instead of white rice, and I double the ingredients. I also change the cheese from the velveeta to shredded cheddar cheese and used about 5cups.  WE USED ONIONS AND SOUR CREAM for toppings.

this was a good recipe to start with, but like a lot of other people i felt it needed adjustments. I sauteed green pepper and onions which i cooked with  the meat with and only a small amount of chili powder. i also used only 2 cans of tomato sauce and added one can of drained rotel. I mixed about half the velveeta with shredded cheddar. it turned out yummy but there was still too much liquid even with the reduction of soup. I suggest either adding more rice or using a lot less soup in the meat. it still got good reviews in my house though!!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I used brown rice, added sauteed onions and green peppers to the ground beef, and added grated cheddar cheese to the top.  Next time I will omit Velveeta, and just use grated cheddar instead.  I'd also add some frozen corn as well, but didn't have any on hand.  Good base recipe.  thanks!

I added jalapeno's, diced tomatoes, and used whatever cheese I had in the fridge.....  This actually turned out really good.  I was very sceptical of it, but it was the only recipe I could find that I had all the ingredients for at the time.  When I was on step #3 I tasted it and was not impressed.... but once it was all together and came out of the oven it was really good.

Good with customization!  Great way to "hide" brown rice and ground turkey for picky eaters.  I used  2 boil in bag brown rice, 1.5 lb gr. beef, 2 can cream of tomato soup, 1/3 c. cream cheese (mixed in soup/meat mixture), a little minced garlic, 1/4 c. spanish onion, some cumin and some red pepper powder (didn't have the chili powder), and Velveeta chunk sliced thinly.  Received a thumbs up from all in the family from age 12 through 47!

This is a very good base recipe that allows for endless variations . I made a variant of this for tonight's supper. I cut the soup to one can, sauteed onions and celery with the beef, then added 1/4 cup of phillie cheese. I left out the chili powder plus I replaced the velveeta with fresh grated mozza, cheddar and asiago cheeses and sprinkled the top with garlic salt and parsley before baking.   My hubby loved it and I will be making this one again.  Thanks CAMIMCC for a great recipe.

I used long grain rice and it was horrible, tough, pellets! Use minute rice. I tried to salvage the recipe by using a Progresso tomato soup which has more moisture than a condensed soup but the rice was still though after another 30 minutes. After using another can of Progresso soup, and more time on the stovetop, it was edible but not great. Perhaps it would be better with minute rice but I won't try this again.

Came out good as a middle of the week meal. Added onion & garlic to hamburger plus salt & pepper. Next time I'll use tomato sauce instead of tomato soup. Too sweet. Also used cheddar cheese & minute rice.  4 cups of rice would have worked better. Didn't have enough for last layer.

The basics of the recipe are good, but I feel it needs some zip and zing.  I used a 2 qt 8x8 dish and it was filled completely, so I think a 1 qt dish would be too small. I used shredded cheese instead of Velveeta.  Also, you could probably do with one or two cans of soup instead of three, and perhaps more rice.

I loved this because I had every ingredient already and it was super quick with very little dishes. This isn't what I'll be making the in-laws for Sunday night dinner, but this was a delicious week night quick dinner. I made the adjustments in the other reviews; two cans of tomato soup, half the chili powder, provolone cheese, and more rice. I also browned the hamburger with some garlic salt and other seasonings.

This is a good basic recipe for nights when you want to make a tasty wholesome meal but don't want to do a lot of work. To make it gluten free, I took the hints of other reviewers and subbed spaghetti sauce for the tomato soup and real cheddar for the processed cheese. Also, the rice directions were incorrect as someone else pointed out - it's always 1 part rice to 2 parts water. Don't let the servings rating fool you - as directed, this makes way more than 4 servings (and thus a lot less calories & fat per serving). Our family of four ate good sized helpings and only ate half of the casserole dish, leaving leftovers for tomorrow nite. Served sweet corn and salad sides and it was a hit with everyone, even picky son (the gluten-free one)!

I didnt follow the recipe exactly so I am not sure how this would really taste.  I used some rice I had from Saturday that also had black beans in it, and everything tastes good though.  I didnt have chili powder either so I have no clue what this really tastes like, oh and I also used and Italian blend of shredded cheese and not velveeta.  I will re-rate when I re-make with correct indg's.  But it was good and we did like it and I will try it again the proper way!

I like to read the reviews before trying a new recipe and that helped so much! I did not used tomato soup at all since I did not have any. I substituted with a can of stewed tomatoes, small can of tomato paste, and dumped the salsa in to taste. I also used a half of a package of frozen corn as well. I seasoned the meat with garlic and onion, as suggested in other reviews as well. I also used shredded cheese instead of the processed and yes; it tasted so good. Hubby doesn't like casseroles at all but he definitely enjoyed this. Saved this one in my recipe box. This recipe is great for using as a base and putting your own spin on it. Very filling!

Easy to make and easy to make healthier too. I also made a lot. I used 2 lbs of local ground beef because it's what I had defrosted. Instead of white rice, I made 2 cups of organic brown jasmine rice and 1 cup of Black Beluga lentils. I mixed them together after cooking (there was a little leftover after recipe). With the meat, I used organic roasted red pepper and tomato soup (almost a whole 32 oz box container). I added tomato paste to thicken it. I also added black beans for power protein etc. I upped the spice a bit, also adding cumin, cayenne, and Celtic sea salt. I also replaced the processed cheese with real cheddar slices. Again, this made a lot so I put it in a large, rectangular baking dish. I basically made four layers, not including the cheese layers. I'm going to add a bit more cheddar slices to the middle next time. This is fabulous and I know it's going to be great for leftovers and don't have to feel guilty eating it!

What a lot of people don't realize about this recipe is casseroles themselves have to be individually tailored to ones palate. I omitted the 2nd can of soup, subbed another can for a cup Pace salsa (as a few others have), cooked the rice halfway on the stove - PROPERLY DONE (2:1 water/rice) - and mixed it all in my crockpot instead with a packet of Enchilada sauce mix - Low for a few hours - and topped with cheese per serving, not the actual mix itself. Turned out perfectly AND was awesome in tortillas the next day!

I was not impressed by this recipe but my family of 6 loved it. Second time I made it I sautéed some garlic and onions before added some chorizo let it cook a few minutes then added the ground beef. I also sub'd the velveeta for Monterey jack. This time I liked it a bit. My family loved it even more. This is a great base to add your little twist. This one stays in my recipe box.

This was good, but I used this as a starting point to a red beans and rice recipe and added some things to it.  I wanted to add some vegetables so I sautéed mushrooms, onions, garlic and red peppers then added the beef.  Then I added 1 can of rinsed red kidney beans and some leftover corn I had in the fridge. I only used 1 can of tomato soup but I added club house roasted garlic and red pepper sauce to it along with chipotle seasoning and black pepper. Topped it with and aged Canadian cheddar.  My 7 year old wanted to bring the leftovers to school for lunch!

Loved it.  Here are the changes that I made.  Browned and onion and 2 cloves of garlic along with the beef.  used one can of the soup, one can of stewed tomatoes and 1 cup of salsa.  Change chili seasoning for Cumim. Used regular sharp cheddar cheese.  Made only 2 layers.
Served with corn chip scoops.  GREAT!

Like others, I made some modifications based on what was available in my kitchen at the time, but the hubby still raved about it!  I subbed 1 can of diced petite tomatoes, 1 cup fresh medium salsa and 1 can tomato soup instead of the 3 cans tomato soup; I added a half onion while sauteing the ground venison, and added season salt and garlic powder in addition to the chili powder.  I didn't have enough shredded cheddar, so I sliced up fresh mozz on the top until it browned. Tasty!

Very good but like others suggested, it needs some modification. I used 1 cup white rice but needed 2 cups water to boil it. I seasoned my meat with seasoning salt and garlic powder. Used 2 cans tomato sauce and half cup water (didn't have soup) and only 2 tablespoons chilli powder in the meat mixture. I used shredded cheddar instead of velveeta and only did 2 layers. My family loved this. Even my picky 7 year old ate it. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was great with a few minor changes.  First change the ratio of rice and water and double the amount of rice.  2 cups rice 4 cups water.  Then I sauteed onion and garlic before adding the ground beef.  I did 1 tbsp montreal steak spice and 2 tbsp chili powder.  I did only 2 layers instead of three as I found I didn't have enough rice to do three layers even with doubling the rice.  Overall I really liked this recipe it's quick, tasty and uses ingredients I always have on hand!!

This is very similar to a meatball recipe I have, but much easier.  I used shredded colby/jack and added garlic, onion powder and pepper.  It wasn't what I was hoping for after the first bite, but it definitely grew on me.  The kids really liked it and we'll definitely be making it again.

There was just something not right about this meal. I put 2 T of chili powder and i thought that was to much. My boyfriend who eats everything i make wouldnt even finish what was on his plate.

Did make changes but a great base!  I made rice 4 cup water, 2 cups rice.  Ground beef with onions and green peppers. I only used 2 cans tomato soup, 1 TB Chili Powder and about a TB of a season all type salt.  I mixed the ground beef and rice together to make sure I had enough soup to cover but did add cheese (Colby/Mexican) between the layers.  Would be really good to wrap in soft taco shells the next day.

This recipe was just ok.  My kids are picky eaters and they begrudgingly ate this.  I made mintue rice rather than cooking it on the stove top.  I also added french fried onions to the top and it did give the casserole a nice crunch.  Overall though, I probably won't make it again!

This is a great basic recipe that you can make with what you have on hand. I cooked my rice in the rice cooker, used a pound and a half of ground beef, and one can of tomato paste. I seasoned my ground beef while browning, with a roasted garlic and pepper mix, then after adding the tomato paste I added in about a can or so of water to make it more spreadable in the dish. Last but not least, I used a shredded tex-mex cheddar mix. These are the things I had on hand, and it worked out great!

I made this recipe and I found that it called for too much tomato soup, too little ground beef, and too little rice. I basically have a chili flavored tomato soup with bits of ground beef and rice in it.

I made this tonight for my family, i did however make a few changes, the changes i made are for a serving of 12. i used minute rice,5 cans of the tomato soup & 3 cups of salsa.  I used shredded cheese,  instead of  sliced, and lastly i mixed it altogether and layered with cheese.. it was a success, everyone loved it. 
p.s eat it with taco shells if u can, amazing

I didn’t have everything on hand, so a made substitutes as well, I also used rice cooker and would also suggest more rice, I only had one can of tomato soup so I used a can of cream of cheese and cream of mushrooms. I also didn’t have chili powder so I used a packet of taco seasoning! And I used regular sliced cheese after reading reviews. With my changes it actually turned out really yummy! After reading all reviews I’m glad I didn’t have everything on hand.

I give this a 3 because it’s sooo good.. but the sizes and such are wrong. So I did the math, and doubled it, added some roasted tomatoes, and used a larger casserole dish. My fam loves it!!

So I added onion and 3 cloves of fresh garlic to the ground beef along with some salt. I didn't add the soup or chili powder. Instead I layered the rice, ground beef, chunky spaghetti sauce, and tons of shredded mozz cheese for the first layer. I then layered more rice, ground beef, Alfredo sauce, and more shredded mozzarella cheese. The family LOVED it and I will be making this again!

I used a jar spaghetti sauce mainly because I did have the tomato soup, added a can of diced roasted tomatoes with garlic and onion, and used real shredded cheddar cheese. I upped the rice to 2 cups and used the rice cooker as suggested in another review. I also tailored the spices to my families taste- salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper plus 1 tbsp. Chili powder.  I put in a round casserole dish and baked a bit longer than directed to get all the layers cooked through. I will be adding this to our rotating menu!

We very  much  liked this.  My change ups include chopped onion. Two instead of three tablespoons of chili powder, substituted one can of diced tomatoes for one can of tomato soup and I added cheddar cheese along with the yellow American cheese.

This recipe is more like a version of sloppy Joe & thought it was better served on a hamburger bun rather than a main dish.  Flavor was just ok, a bit spicy with that much chili pepper.  Probably won't make it again.  My son who eats everything didn't like it.

Yum! I'm so glad I made this! I was a bit put off by the velveeta but having 2 toddlers I had bought some as a last resort to try and get them to eat veggies so I have a whole bunch around to use up. This recipe is so versatile, instead of the 3 cans tomato soup I used one can of tomato soup, a small can of tomato sauce, sprinkled lawry's seasoning on the beef, added some garlic, onion and black beans, topped with some aged white cheddar. I'v served it under a fried egg, as a tortilla chip dip, burrito filling and just on its own. My picky 2 year old likes it, foodie 4 year old does not. Also, I used jasmine rice for the rice. My husband also likes it. Will make again, thanks!

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe! It was very easy to prepare and most of the ingredients I had at home. I would suggest this recipe to all working mothers as the prep and cook time was less than an hour.

We liked it.  I cooked the meat with a little onion and garlic, used less soup, and added a splash of worcestershire sauce.  I also used cheddar cheese.

A good basic, simple recipe. As other members had suggested, this recipe needed some tweaking. I used 500g of ground beef, browned with onions, fresh minced garlic and seeded jalapeño. I added some chopped fried bacon and about a tbsp of chili powder. Then added 2 tins of tomato soup. (3 would have been excessive). I also added a bit of fried onions to the rice and layered in a casserole dish along with grated cheese. Cooked for about 30 minutes and served with hot fresh biscuits from this site.

This is a great simple recipe especially when you have nothing planned for dinner. I added some ingredients and the family LOVED it. I think this is a simple recipe that you can leave as is or add your own touch to it. I used brown rice and added kidney beans to my meat mixture. I spread the brown rice at the bottom of the baking dish and added the meat mixture on top (like the recipe). I put cheese and served with tortillas andsour cream with a side salad.

Must tweak!! And i doubled the recipe.  Used a 9x13 casserole. This is what i did:
 cook rice on stovetop, then add seasoning (salt and pepper and coconut oil) when cooked. Saute onion then garlic. Remove from pan then brown meat, drain.  Add onion, garlic, spaghetti sauce, cumin, chili powder,  salt and pepper to taste. Mix half the meat sauce in with rice   To construct casserole, spoon a thin layer of meat sauce on bottom, then sprinkle layer of cheese, spoon rice and meat mix on top. Add remaining meat sauce, sprinkle more cheese then add French 's  onions and then bake. 
Next time i will add try a mexican version: with Cheese, salsa, crushed  tortilla chips and serve with avocados on the side

You definitely need a 2qt casserole dish. Anything smaller is too small. I used garlic and herb spaghetti sauce and 1/3 of the chili powder because I'm not a fan of spices.

I used 2 cans of soup instead of 3.   Didn't want it to be to soupy.  I also didn't use processed cheese.  I used fresh mozzarella cheese that I slices.  

We loved this recipe and will make this again.

A hit and easy to make! A few changes I made: I used 2 small cans of tomato sauce instead of the soup because that's all I had on hand, I also added diced onions while cooking the beef and chopped zucchini after the beef was browned when I added the tomato sauce. I also used shredded cheddar cheese instead of velveeta slices. I did not use as much chili powder b/c I felt 3 tbsp was a lot but I did add a bit of red pepper for some extra spiciness. It turned out well and the husband loved it as did I. I will make this again

I enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe, but I did make modifications. I did not have 3 cans of condensed tomato soup, so I used 1 can of soup, 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes. When I made the rice, I made 1 1/2 times the recipe (w/ 3 c water) and added chili powder, cumin and cilantro to the water. I also added those spices to the meat and tomato mixture. My son is not eating onions or garlic currently or I would have added those as well. However, I will say that I did not miss them. I also used slices of medium cheddar and mozzarella instead of velveeta.

It turned out really good. I'm surprised because it's a very simple dish. I added a whole onion, an extra cup of rice, and garlic. I also did sharp cheddar instead of cheese food. I loved it. I also just cooked it in my cast iron skillet. Highly recommend this dish, just tweak it to how you like it and it'll be a great comfort food

I thought this was great! I did make some adjustments as well. Added chili beans to the mix and 1 less can of soup. Next time I will probably use less cheese as well. We then topped it off with a dollop of sour cream and ate with biscuits. Very creamy and yummy! I do agree there is no way to fit in a 1 quart dish, I used a two quart.

This is on the monthly rotation now.  Changes:  cooked brown rice in pressure cooker 1 C/1.5 C water, used turkey and highly seasoned it with one garlic clove per pound, tons of salt, and simmered it in a little marinara sauce until lightly cooked.  then put everything together in a casserole dish, sliced cheese on top, covered in foil, baked at 350 for 35 mins.

My two pickiest eaters were delighted, and that happens RARELY!  Plus, it was a 30 min meal with the pressure cooker and the oven.

I simply substituted the chili powder with onion powder and added bits of onion to my meat! Turned out soooo good! I took it out 3 minutes before it was done and added more shredded cheese on top, because I didn't put the layer of cheese on top. So good!

I made this last night for supper.  It was very good but my husband mentioned that it needed something extra as filler.
Since I had leftovers, I added a can of Heinz brown beans with tomato sauce.  I drained out most of the sauce and just put the beans into the recipe.
It was very good this way and made it a heartier meal.

Cut the soup down to 1 can. Season the ground beef with ground black pepper, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, chili powder and salt. Add some chopped mushrooms and white onions. Substitute shredded cheddar or similar cheese for the Velveeta. Put it all in a 2qt baking dish (it won't fit in anything smaller). Now you have a tasty meal. Other than that, it's great.

This turned out great family loved it. I made a few changes instead of tomato soup I used a 64oz jar of Spaghetti Sauce and instead of sliced processed cheese that does not melt to well I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

Good for kids as written with only 2T. chili powder and 2 cans of soup.  Grands liked it.  A little boring for adults so I changed a few things- 20 oz. ground turkey instead of beef, more rice (brown) a can of chopped green chiles added to meat plus onion and garlic, sharper grated real cheese, and a bit of salt. 5 stars with adjustments.  Try left overs in burritos or tacos with normal fixings.

The whole family liked the recipe with some modifications. I used 2 pounds of ground beef and only one can of soup.

Good recipe! Like other suggestions, I added onions, but also added cayenne pepper to add a little spice. Also used shredded cheddar cheese.

Tasty, however, I only used one can of soup and a teaspoon of chili powder. Also, I added minced onion to the ground beef when it was frying, as well as a variety of spices I like to use when frying ground beef. I used shredded cheeses instead of the processed cheese.

This is good if you use premium ingredients and make  substantial changes.  I used basmati rice for the rice bed.  I then sautéed 1 chopped green pepper and 1 medium chopped cooking onion in 2 tbs olive oil until the peppers were tender and the onion translucent.  I then added 4 cloves of crushed garlic, 1 tsp salt and 2 tsp of   chili powder just before adding 1 lb of 90% lean hamburger.  Instead of tomato sou0

I used a cup and a half of rice, and instead of three cans of soup, I used one can of tomato soup and one can of Manwich. I also added chopped onion and chopped garlic to the hamburger while it was browning, and topped the casserole with shredded cheese and French's french-fried onions. Super yum.

I would like to try this again but with a few tweaks.  First the baking dish needs to be larger than 1 qt.  I would switch the cheese to shredded cheddar instead, the Velveeta slices didn't melt the way I would've preferred.  Also the meat needs seasoning, add diced onion and garlic.  Goes great with sour cream and tortilla chips

I made this recipe with a few changes.  Cooked brown rice in rice cooker 1 cup rice 2 cups water. After browning beef, I added enchilada sauce (19oz can) instead of tomato soup.  Layers rice, beef, and cheddar cheese. Served with tortilla chips and sour cream.  Big hit with my family.

This recipe popped up when I did a ground beef recipe search. It looked simple enough even though I didn't have all the suggested ingredients. I did have the ground beef and rice. The rest I had to substitute. I used a a 6 oz can of tomato paste mixed well with half a cup of water, some garlic salt and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I used sharp cheddar slices on the first layer and grated cheddar on the top layer. It turned out  good and cheesy although a bit spicy. I will have to try again when I have all the suggested ingredients.

I think this recipe is great! I didn't have tomato soup, so I used 1 can of spaghetti sauce and added garlic powder to the ground beef mix. Super simple and made with things I had in the cabinet. Thanks for this yummy recipe!

I decreased the meat and tomato soup. I added condensed cheese sauce, zucchini and fresh tomatoes.  When browning meat I added minced garlic and onions.  The original recipe was a great base to work from.  As a home health caregiver being creative with limited supplies makes for a CHOPPED type of meal prepping.  I will be using this recipe again for sure.

I made this for the http://6ingredientsorless.johnsonville.com/ Johnsonville Sausage 6 Ingredients or Less challenge so replaced the beef with mild Italian sausage. I cooked 1 cup brown rice with 2 cups water, and used only 2 cans of soup and 1 TBS chili powder (since the sausage had seasoning already). This was very tasty!! We liked it a lot - quick and easy. I used a 2-qt baking dish and layered twice, putting 4 slices of cheese on each layer.

This is a winner!  I used a bag of boca meat, and I used whole grain rice.  The dish I used was approx. 8x7 so I put all the rice down first then the meat mixture. (also added chopped garlic) Then a whole bag of shredded cheddar.  The husband loved it.  His seconds were in a bowl with a bag of tortilla chips for dipping! Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome! I did add one can of dark red kidney beans (drained) and one can of great northern beans (drained) to make it taste like a chili casserole. It does make much more than to fill a 1 quart dish so I used my 2 & 1/2 quart dish. I also used boil in a bag rice and it was easier! If your husband or man loves traditional homemade meals, this is the way to his heart! Mine asks for this all the time!

This dish is tasty but with some changes.  Velvetta cheese tastes terrible.  I used cheddar cheese instead, I also added a little but more rice but I used Basmati rice as the flavor and texture is much better. Also, I left out the tomato sauce completely and created my own sauce in place of it which is a mixture of butter, milk, and garlic and a little bit of flour. I gave this a 4 only because I liked when I made these changes. I would have hated it if I had tried the original recipe.

Fantastic Quick Easy Mid-week Meal.  My 3 year old is an extremely fussy eater and had seconds of this dish. I think it will be a firm addition to our meal plans,

Edible, but the tomato soup and velveeta is a little too much, had corn on the side and it was better with it mixed in.

Wasn't our favorite.  The kids wouldn't finish and we all got heartburn.  I gave 3 stars because maybe I did something wrong?...however, this simple recipe is pretty fool proof.

This was a delicious meal. I did have to cook a little more rice to fill the size dish it says but the final result was amazing. Great recipe!!!
