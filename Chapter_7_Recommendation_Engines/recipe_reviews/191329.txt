This is one of the ultimate Mexican comfort foods and you don't have to be Mexican to enjoy it! It is food fit for royalty and the common man alike. It ranks right up there with your Mama's chicken soup. It will cure anything, even baldness.   Eat it hot, add hot sauce or hot chilies or menudo mix or chilipi√±as to spice it up if that's your style, with warm corn tortillas on the side, and you will find yourself in heaven!    My dear mother-in-law made this for me whenever we visited, and she will forever hold a special place in my heart. My wife made a special point of learning how to make this (and other great recipes, and it has contributed greatly to a happy and lasting marriage. It is true that a woman's way to winning a man is through his stomach ... and it is a man's way of gaining a woman's love is to appreciate her cooking and her efforts to please him. Which is to say that it is a two-way street.  Try this recipe, you'll enjoy it!

My mom used to make a version of this meatball soup, and it was delicious.  My father would make meatballs the size of the top of his thumb (about 3/4 - 1" diameter), then she would boil them in a little salted water, just enough to cover.  She saved the water to add to the soup (more flavor).  The meatballs never fell apart and were just the right size for your mouth.  We got about 40 - 50 meatballs out of a pound of ground beef.  (She also used a dash of worchestershire sauce to taste) and mixed beef and chicken broth together, then added a cup or so of dried vegetable soup mix, along with approx 1 c. diced fresh carrots (1/4" cubes), 1 diced celery stalk, bay leaf to taste, and rice.  Served with fresh crusty rolls - we were in heaven!

Really good. I had to add an egg & a little bit of bread crumbs to make the meat stick together. I also thought that 4 cloves of garlic was a bit much for only 1 pound of ground beef so I only put 2 cloves. I also added a package of onion soup mix to the broth for more flavor. I cooked it in my crock pot. It came out really good. Next time I want to add zucchini.

To make it more "authentic" tasting, I added additional spices, a bay leaf and...for my own tastebuds...red pepper flakes. Overall, it's a good basic meatball soup if you want to try it out and you're lacking the extra ingredients you rarely buy.

Haven't tasted the soup yet (just put it on for final simmer, with the last cilantro and the meatballs), but it smells wonderful and promises to sustain me through my lunches at the office next week.  Some minor changes/suggestions:  1)  I added an egg to the meatball mix (I doubled the recipe, by the way).  Just thought that would help keep them intact.  2)  I would suggest that you err on the side of cooking the meatballs (my doubling the recipe made 32, by the way) in the skillet before putting them into the broth.  Mine seemed to have a bit of a problem hanging together at first.  3)  Try to use the leanest ground beef you can find.  In my pre-blizzard foray to the Safeway, all I could find was some fairly high-fat stuff....  Thanks, Melissa!  Good soup for a SNOWY day!

This was a nice soup with the chunky pieces and  broth.  I used everything listed in the original recipe.  I expected more flavor though so to give a bit more I would suggest adding a touch of crushed red pepper flakes to the meatballs and/or the broth, or perhaps some chopped jalapeno to these.   Serve with crusty rolls and you have a nice cold weather meal to warm you up!

This is a good basic reciipe that anyone can make. My original recipe was half ground pork and half ground beef.  I use ground turkey. To keep it together and omit the browning of the meatballs first, I add an egg, and about 1/4 cup of uncooked white rice and yes, you can add bread crumbs too.  Some people don't like cilantro so you can use chopped mint leaves to the meatball mixture. Just drop the formed meatballs into a simmering pot of broth and add desired vegetables cut in chunks as stated. I also sometimes add a bay leaf to the broth. This is suppose to be a clear broth vegetable meatball soup so do not thicken with roux or add thick tomato sauce.  Tlhis is an excellent substitution for chicken soup as a restorative and declicious too!

I always wanted to learn to make this one. Now I can! I changed it around some by first doubling the ingredients. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes to the meat and add the same to the broth. Then, I added 1/4 cup of oatmeal flakes to the meat as to increase the number of meatballs. I also added an entire 14 oz can of drained garbanzo beans to the broth for a Menudo effect. I seasoned the broth with 2 bay leaves, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of Mexican oregano. I served it once with a scoop of rice in the bowl (which was great) and served it later with a topping of avocados, lime twists, sour cream and Monterey Jack cheese. It is great with all of these toppings. One of the best soups/stews that I have ever had. Homemade soup beats canned soup every time! This is a highly nutritious dish, looks and tastes  great. My first batch yielded 1 gallon and it lasted 3 days.  This is a wonderful recipe that I am surprised is not making the rounds in the Mexican restaurants!

Have not tried it  but my mom would add chopped mint into the meatball mixture along with some uncooked rice then added the celery, potatoes, carrots and onions..can of tomato sauce and that was it. no chicken broth or stock. Gave it a 3 star just because it sounds delish..

I admit. I was skeptical about this recipe, but it was very easy and delicious.  The only adjustment I made was to add 1 tsp cumin and 1 egg to the meatball mixture. I chose to brown the meatballs in the over at 350 for 15 mins instead of pan frying (less messy).   I served this with chopped fresh avocado and a squeeze of fresh lime.  Very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this soup many times.  When I am in a hurry, or have little time, I use FULLY  COOKED frozen Italian style meatballs and through them in with the broth and the rest of the ingredients. The frozen meatballs are great to have around and take only 15 minutes to heat up.  Also great to serve when you have unexpected company.  Quick & easy.  Very, very good.

Tasty, comfort-food soup that gets kudos for having easy ingredients you likely already have on hand. Try not to overcook the meatballs as I did. They do not soften up in liquid like chicken does...definitely undercook them.

This was very good.  I'm sure that the amount of cilantro is appropriate for the authentic recipe, my only advice if your aren't used to the amounts, like my husband and I aren't, cut back a little on the quantity of cilantro. It was a little too over-powering for us.  Overall a good change from typical chicken noodle, glad we tried it!

I added 1 zuchinni chopped and 2 Tablespoons of habenero salsa to the broth for added spicyness.  I also used an egg with the meatballs to hold these together.

Husband loved it and thought he was in Mexico when he shut his eyes.  Read review and made a few changes: added 1/4 dry rice to meat balls, 1/4 jalepeno pepper to soup, curry, worchestershire sauce (dollop), fresh lime and corn chips to top.  Very tasty.  Only 2 cloves garlic, 1 bay leaf and a bit of red pepper flakes.

This is delicious.  The only difference between my grandmothers and this one is that she would also add some raw white rice to the meatballs, it seems to make them more tender.

This is derived from a traditional Filipino Recipe.  In the Philippines though, fresh herbs and spices are used instead of powdered.  And instead of ready made broth, we use real chicken boiled in water for the broth.  Sometimes that's even omitted with just plain water (for less sodium and calories).  It's really refreshing and good.

This was AMAZING!!! I substituted turnips for the carrots, because my fiance doesn't like carrots. Truly one of the best soups we have ever had!

Loved it. Family loved it. I tweaked it a little.  I added 1/4 cup of rice to the meat balls. And a 1/2 cup of rice to the broth. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce to broth. I think it's as close as to the way my mother made it. I call it Maria 's   Albondigas.

This was delicious. After reading the reviews I decided to add 1/4 cup uncooked jasmine rice to the meatballs. I also added 1 jalapeno to the soup. I think I cut the potatoes too small because they pretty much fell apart when I stirred the soup to serve it(I cut the potato in half lengthwise, then half again lenghtwise and then in 3 cubes...they were pretty big but I guess not big enough). I would cut the potatoes larger next time and maybe boil the meatballs in a little bit of water before adding to the soup (some of them fell apart as well). The soup was delicious though! Great left over as well.

While I am of Greek and Italian Extraction I would be remiss if I did not say that the Mexican's nailed it on this one.   There's room for so many variations and each time I cook or just eat it...well...its amazing how much
I really really really enjoy this culinary delight.

Not bad! While I prefer belen's albondigas (also on this site), this was good too. The idea of adding cilantro to the MB mixture AND in the soup is genius. I really enjoy the flavor of cilantro, so the more the better lol! What I didn't care for was the texture of the meatball itself. It was dense and surprisingly dry! I think I would skip the browning step altogether next time and just let my MB's simmer until done (I think this contributed to their dry texture). In addition to my suggested change, I made a few other minor adjustments. I only had two 32 oz. cartons of chicken broth handy, so I added both of them (FYI, four cans of broth is just shy of two carton's worth). I also added 1/4 t cumin to my MB mixture and two chopped Roma tomatoes to my soup during the last half hour of cooking. My final change was to saute my carrots, celery and onion together rather than add the latter two directly to my broth. As Melissa suggested, I served my soup with prepared Mexican rice and LOVED it! Cornbread paired perfectly with this. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Melissa. This was one comforting bowl of soup! :-)

This was a very good soup!  I changed the meatballs a tad--used all ground pork, added 1/4 c. of pearl rice that I had on hand, and 1/4 tsp. of cumin.

My only complaint is that it was gone too soon.

So yummy!  Served with sliced avocado, squeeze of lime and cilantro. I love the idea of adding cilantro and onion to the meatballs - at first I thought it would be too overpowering, but it wasn't - I also added a little milk to make them more moist.  Also, recommend adding potatoes at the end so they dont get mushy.

LOVED the use of cilantro IN the meatball which I don't believe I've ever done.  This is a great hearty homey soup!  The only change I made was to saute the carrots and celery with the onion.  Also added some chopped tomatoes.  YUM!

I absolutely love this recipe because it gives you a simple albondigas base recipe to build on. I had a lot of veggies needing to be used and ones that I wanted to add (Italian squash, red and green bell pepper,burdock root,and celery). I also changed up the meatballs by adding only fresh garlic,shallots,cilantro,and parsley, finely chopped.

This soup is okay...I think I prefer Italian Wedding Soup over this one.  The meatballs were good.  I just didn't care for the potatoes and carrots in the soup, and the broth was really bland.  Needs a little something added, but not sure what, maybe some crushed red pepper.

This was a really simple and easy recipe.  We like it but thought it was kinda bland.  the next night when we re-heated we added a can of stewed tomatoes and it gave it the body it was lacking.

Super Yummy & easy to make.  I added 1 can of El Pato (hot tomato sauce) because I love spicy food!  Everyone liked it - even the picky 10 year old.  Perfect on a winter day.

This soup is delicious.  I made it with the addition of a pinch of cumin, and some crushed red pepper to the meatballs.  I also served with some fried strips of corn tortilla and shredded Monterrey Jack cheese.  My kids also liked a dollop of sour cream on their serving.

This was good, filling soup. I was looking for a change of pace and this fit the bill. Put all of the cilantro in or you won't taste it. I was worried about putting that much in so I didn't. I aslo added worchestershire sauce which I think I would have missed if I hadn't added it.

This was good comfort food. My husband raved over this and asked that I serve it a lot more often. I used dried cilantro 1T in the meatballs and 2T in the broth, and dried minced onion. This was a bit bland though and was a lot better with the rice so take the time to fix it as it makes the dish so much better. Thanks this was a nice meal.

Pretty good soup...I added some fresh bread crumbs to the meatballs, although they still almost fell apart.  I left out the celery but otherwise followed the recipe.  As others suggested, I made Mexican rice as a side dish (which I added to my own bowl of soup and liked the soup a little better).

The best!! I added 1 egg and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to the meatballs. They held together perfect. I also added zucchini and some hatch chilies to the soup. Then I put 1/2 cup of rice on the bottom of our bowls, ladeled the soup over it,  and topped it with crushed tortilla, jack cheese, avocado and cilantro! Will make this soup often!  Thanks Ms. Avila for a great recipe

I made this per the recipe but used ground turkey instead. We like the taste of cilantro, but if you've never tasted it you should try it before  using it, it's a love or hate type of food.
I will make this again.

It was a fabulous recipe. I ended up browning the meatballs before putting them in the soup base. I also added cilantro to the soup base too. I will definitely make it again.

Delicious and forgiving.  I didn‚Äôt have garlic salt and I added the chopped garlic to the broth not the meatballs. I also added fresh green beans.  The fresh cilantro on top is a must. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I doubled recipe, i didn't use the onion powder and instead of using potatoes, I made Spanish rice on the side and poured soup over the rice in individual each bowls; that keeps the rice from getting mushy if added directly to pot of soup. I also used a bag of baby carrots instead of regular carrots

I used included 1 packet of taco seasoning in the meat mixture and one packet in the soup broth. I also added 2-eggs and some breadcrumbs to the meat. I used fresh garlic and onions instead of powder, both in the meat and in the soup. I used more broth than the recipe called for because I added one small package of Fideo pasta, and mainly because our family prefers a brothy soup. I also included a can of diced tomatoes, chopped green chilis, and rinsed black beans. We served this with fresh cilantro and crema fresca on top. My family LOVED this soup and I will make it again!

Simple and delicious. I added sausage to the ground beef, dash of cumin, and a tablespoon of cayenne to spice it up. 
Also per a reviewer‚Äôs suggestion- a cup of rice to cook while simmering last 20-30 minutes. 
Yes will make this again.

Really yummy! I made a couple adjustments - used ground turkey instead of ground beef to make it healthier and added a can of tomato sauce. Served it with a side of tostada, avocado, and contija cheese and squeezed some lime on top. Reminded me of my friend‚Äôs mom‚Äôs cooking when we were kids... DELICIOSO!

I made this according to the recipe. FANTASTIC!  The meatballs were very tender and did not fall apart. They were very flavorful, too!  The broth was delicious.  While making it, I didn‚Äôt realize how much soup there would be- no problem!  DH and I enjoyed multiple lunches!

Really really good!! All you need to do is add more spices. I added a little cumin, oregano, garlic powder, tad of cayenne pepper, chili powder, onion powder, and taco seasoning mix. I added those to both the meat ball mixture and the broth. Very yummy!

Have been looking for a recipe because this was a meal that my aunt used to make. Has great flavor! I did make some changes: instead of the seasonings mentioned I just used Weber Hamburger Seasoning for the meatballs, as it provided a little kick to them. I also baked them in the oven instead of frying them.  This way they were tender and juicy all over, and I avoided the hard bits you get from frying in a pan. I baked them at 375F for about 30 min. I would probably add some Knorr Caldo de Pollo to the broth next time, just to give it a little more flavor. Since I served it with cooked white rice, I omitted the potatoes.  The family loved it! Will definitely make again!

This recipe came really close to what I was wanting to eat tonight so off to the kitchen I went. I didn't have celery or cilantro, drat!, I love cilantro, so twerked it a bit. I added part of a package of taco seasoning, but left everything about the same. It came out so delicious. We had some tortilla chips left over so we had a time. Great recipe.

Cooked together for about 20 minutes, cooled and refrigerated overnight. Finished simmering the next day. Mmmm. The kind of dish that you know benefits from the blending you get from reheating.

This is a good recipe and I followed it exactly, but I needed to add  some cumin to give it that Mexican soup flavor. Also, I cooked the carrots, onion, celery in a Dutch oven, just to soften a bit, added the chicken stock and once it got to a boil added the meatballs and potatoes.  Used dried cilantro instead of fresh too. Delicious!!!  I added some leftover white rice to the meatballs to act as a binding agent, they were excellent.

This recipe is excellent, however I do cheat in order to easily make it after a long work day as a healthy family meal.  I buy premade, low fat angus steak meatballs that are kept in the freezer.  I use a little olive oil to fry up a couple of onions, add the carrots and then the celery.  Then I add the no salt added broth, the potatoes, frozen meatballs and bring to boil and simmer.  Add pepper to taste.  Finally I add either frozen spinach and cook for a few more minutes or fresh spinach 5 minutes to serving.  Excellent!

This was delicious! It takes me back to my childhood and reminds me of the soup my grandmother makes. The only thing I changed based off the tips from other viewers is I used 1/3 cup of italian bread crumbs and 1/3 cup milk in the meatballs. I also add 1 egg white to help the meat stay together. You can use a whole egg but you really don't need to. I also added 1/2 cup of salsa into the soup in the last 30 minutes of cooking. I should mention that I doubled the recipe so you can cut these measuremeants in half if follwing exactly.  I wouldn't do anything different next time. I think this added just the right flavor.

I needed to go grocery shopping, but it was so cold out so I did an ingredients search and found this. THANK THE LORD. It is sooo good! I didn't have celery so I just threw in frozen carrots and corn. Then I made some homemade baked corn tortilla chips and put them in. So good. Please make this immediately.

It is a great recipe; I followed some of the other suggestions, such as adding worcestershire sauce, ground cumin, egg & bread crumbs to the meatballs; I served it with avocado, crushed some tortilla chips and diced red onions.  It took at least 1 hour to prepare & 30 mnutes to cook; I recommend you allow 2 hours total from start to finish

This is a darn good basic sopa de albondigas. We will probably use 50/50 ground beef/chorizo mix with bread crumbs and egg for the meatballs.  Its a family thing.

This is a delicious gluten-free meal. I used sweet potatoes instead because my husband is on a restrictive diet this month and he can't have them. I have been printing the recipe for my gluten-free friends to enjoy.

This soup was delicious! Had my place smelling soo good!
Thought it would be perfect for a cold, rainy day. 
I hadn't had Albondigas in a really long time! It sure did hit the spot! Kiddos got seconds!  Definitely keeping this recipe as a favorite!

This is a very good soup.  You do have to add additional seasoning our it's kind of bland. To make it alittle more healthy I used ground turkey.  I also used reduced sodium chicken broth and only half of the recipe I used water for the rest of the liquid.  Additional seasoning - sage/poultry seasoning/sea salt/basil. The kicker for this soup is to add the cilantro and chop red onion to the bowl.  My husband loved it and I will make this again.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to use Knorr beef homestyle stock instead of chicken stock & it added a great flavor. I served it with a dark wheat bread and everyone loved it! I will certainly make this again.

Our family really likes cilantro, so I knew this recipe would be a hit. The cilantro was not available at our local grocery store, so we bought a tube of fresh cilantro blend. It worked very well. We will make this again.
