This was really good, but I didnt use fajita seasoning when i made it, or sugar. Instead i let it cook in a bit of cola.

This is a fantastic recipe. Lots of flavor and the most tender, fall off the bone meat you'll ever cook. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of reducing the sauce. I ended up with close to 2 cups of sauce after braising which took 20 min on medium heat to thicken up. The sauce was also VERY salty from 1/2 cup of fajita seasoning and I ended up adding about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a Tbsp of dijon mustard and it was perfect. **TIP** do not forgo the broil process, this gives the meat a nice sticky, caramelized coating that is the key to finishing the flavor of these ribs. One final thing, don't omit the fajita season (I used Fiesta brand), it helps to tenderize and lends lots of flavor. I will definitely be making these again and I think I'll try some liquid smoke next time.

I used the basic outline of this recipe and it is to die for, I used McCormicks Sweet and Spicy rub  instead of fajita seasoning with the brown sugar, and bbq and mesquite grilling spices, and mojo crillo for the liquid, that was all, I used the juice at the end with 1 cup of BBQ sauce boiled and reduced before I broiled them, we werent even done with dinner before the kids asked when we were having them again.  I cant wait to try a brisket using this recipe as a guideline I finally did try it with the brisket, bake at 300 for 5 hours, it melts in your mouth, my husband and kids have asked for the brisket and ribs again and again

Oh.  My.  God.  These ribs are to die for!!  I made them for Memorial Day weekend.  My son told me he was only going to have "a couple" because he had another bbq to attend.  He ended up eating a rack and a half and called his friend to say he would be late! My husband couldn't stop eating them either.  I made them exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing!  They were the most finger lickin', fall off the bone ribs I ever had.  I loved them so much I went into my recipe box and threw out every other rib recipe I had in the house.  I cooked down the liquid as stated and it made an incredible sauce.  We were tasting it as it was cooking down and could barely leave it alone.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It is absolutely fabulous.  My only regret is I can't give it more than five stars.  I'd give it ten if I could.  Thanks so much for a fabulous recipe that my family will be enjoying for many years to come.  I can't wait to make them again....4th of July is coming up soon!  Seriously, try this recipe.  You won't be sorry.  I think the people who had problems weren't doing something right.  After they came out of the oven, I finished them off outside on the grill.  I used Sam Adams summer ale for the beer but I think any light color ale would work.  I wouldn't use Guinness or a dark beer.  I didn't find low sodium fajita mix.  I used Old el Paso regular and it was awesome!!  I didn't notice any salty taste at all.  Mmmmmmm, mmmmmm, GOOD!!

So disappointed. I followed the recipe as written. Smelled fabulous when baking (250 degrees 3 hrs. Took them out of the oven and unwrapped the foil in anticipation of tasting some fabulous ribs. Instead all I had were tough,inedible pieces of meat. Lots of time and money wasted here. I do not know what I did that made these turn out this way. I have reviewed the recipe again to see what I forgot but cannot find anything. I will have to throw these away. We were really looking forward to our rib dinner, too. Many have obviously had great success with this recipe but I am not sure that I will give it another go in the future or not. Well, that's the 'fun' of cooking and some you win and some you don't!

This recipe was pretty easy to follow, especially when it was my first time making ribs and I had only 6 hours to cook it.  So my review might help those who want to make ribs but have less than 7 hours.  I made it with three racks, and did not have time to refrigerate before cooking.  I had cut the racks to make four pans.  It did not affect the tenderness or taste.  I also did not use the garlic, honey or mustard since I was short on time and wanted to get the ribs in the oven so they could cook for the four hours.  After four hours I poured about a cup of the drippings with two cups of sweet baby rays in a sauce pan and boiled it down.  After flipping the ribs over, I brushed the ribs with the sauce and left the temp at 250 and repeated @ 3 times for @ 15 minutes.  I kept them in the oven b/c there were too many racks of ribs to move to the counter or top rack to broil or grill outside.  Also, people were hanging out in the kitchen (like they always do) and I didn't want to navigate around them to get to the grill.  I made the foil packets for the ribs, and put them in foil trays.  I think this worked better than the cookie tray since the juices from the ribs and beer sauce spilled out of the foil packets and would have have been hard to manage if they were in a shallow cookie sheet. Plus easy clean up! Hope my review helps shy rib cooks!

Wow! These were the best ribs I have ever eaten! It takes a lot for me to really want to make a recipe again and this was honestly the tenderest, tastiest wrack of ribs I've ever eaten for such little work. I will never make ribs any other way again ever. I made a few minor changes and kept the method the same. I have a lot of spice blends from Penzey's so I decided to use a heavy dose of some Northwoods Fire mixed with a handful of brown sugar instead of the seasoning mentioned. Also, It is July and I did not want to heat up my apartment with having an oven on for 3 hours so I used my cusinart convection toaster oven and baked the ribs for 3 hours at 350 on the convection setting and they were meltingly tender beyond what I can describe to you. The meat had the most wonderful flavor that completely permeated it. Oh, also, I have something called a Deni meat tenderizer which I poked throughout the ribs after I rubbed it with seasoning so the seasoning really penetrated the ribs and I didn't give them any marinating time at all, I just put them in the oven right after covering with the spice rub. To finish, I did not use the pan juices because I felt that there was a lot of fat that drained off the ribs during cooking so I brushed a tad of Bullseye BBQ sauce which was voted the top store BBQ sauce from Cooks Illustrated. I finished under the broiler for about 10 minutes and these ribs were one of the best things I've ever made and I cook all the time.Thanks for a great recipe!

Family loved them; glad I bought an extra rack of ribs while they were on sale! I forgot to save the drippings to make a sauce, but the kids and hubby loved them anyway. Thanks for posting the recipe! Please note: many reviewers have commented that the sauce didn't thicken. I've had great success using a "fat separator." It looks like a measuring cup and it has a spout that stems from the bottom of the cup. Simply pour all the gravy in and let it rest about a minute, and  the fat will float to the top. Pour the gravy into the pan, but keep an eye on the separator, and do not pour in the clear fat. Discard the fat, but don't pour it down the drain or your pipes will clog. Your sauce will thicken, I promise! Hope that helps.

Great. I didn't use pre-mixed fajita seasoning; I subbed cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and crushed coriander and crushed mustard seeds. Otherwise, followed recipe to the letter, using the 4 hour braise time. Excellent, sticky, sweet and tender.

I've only ever been able to make mediocre ribs at best, much to my dismay. So I've been searching for a long time for a good recipe to help me out. This is not only a good recipe but a GREAT one!! I made one small addition in that I added a Tbsp of liquid smoke. Thank you so much for posting this!! A definite keeper!!

My husband rated these ribs as "the best he's ever eaten"!!!  They were very tender.  Loved the cooking method.  I was a little leary of the flavor of the greasy juices but after boiling the sauce on Med-High heat until it reduced to a thick sauce it was very good.  We did the last step on the grill.  I wished the recipe stated how many lbs of ribs.  I made 4 lbs of ribs and halved the brown sugar & fajita seasoning.  (It seemed to be plenty to coat and marinated overnight.  I used the full recipe for the sauce.)

This recipe was wonderful!  I made this in my crock pot and it was fall off the bone tender and flavorful.  I only made 1 rack for my husband and myself.  I used 1/2 C brown sugar, 1/4 C cajan seasoning and 2 tbs smokehouse maple for the rub. I  Used 1 bottle honey wheat beer for a little extra flavor. Garlic, honey and mustard as directed.  I set the croc pot to low and let it cook for 3 1/2 hrs.   I was very pleased with how simple this recipe was.  I will be making this again!

I made this recipe with both spare ribs and baby backs. Surprisingly, the spare ribs were better, but both were amazing. The only change I made was adding sliced onions on top of the ribs before cooking. Thanks for the great recipe!

Easy and delicious.  I had a 1/2 pork steak that had been given to us from our friends and it was so big I found myself serving pork 2 nights in a row.  I also didn't have any fajita seasoning so I substituted burrito packet (not sure if there is a difference).  This was a very different taste for our family - and we'll incorporate it into our mix.

Hands down the best rib recipe out there!  If you have  been looking for an awesome rib recipe this is it.  This is best with a nice pale ale for the beer and throwing the ribs on the grill instead of broiling them gives it a great BBQ taste.  Really, you could use any flavoring you want.  It is the technique of cooking them in the oven, sealed in aluminum foil with the extra liquid that makes them fall off the bone.  Next time we are making teriyaki ribs.

I have been lacking a good recipe for ribs forever... I followed this straight down the line and they turned out awesome..... did 4 BIG slabs for 4th o July yesterday....I had some apple butter on hand and added it to the liquid from 2 of my packets and then covered slabs with it as I was finishing it on grill ( I grilled my racks for about 20 minutes instead of finishing in broiler)...OMG it was good I will be adding AB to my twist to this method other than that no changes...!! One small detail that is missing from directions is removing the silver skin from rib bone side of rack.

Followed the recipe exactly. Even went to the store to get honey. The fajita spice is too strong. Left a distinctive taste that was overpowering. I've noticed many who gave this 'five stars' made changes to the original recipe, leaving out the fajita in the rub. Wish I did!!
Also, I boiled the drippings for 25 minutes and they never thickened.

This is a great recipe. The only changes I make are to only bake the ribs in foil for 3 1/2 hrs then coat them in your favorite BBQ sauce and finish them on the grill for about 3 minutes a side. I found baking them in foil for 4hrs made them so tender that the meat fell off the bone handling them on the BBQ.

I agree with other reviewers who say that the method was good, but flavors were only ok. The fajita seasonings ( I used Fiesta brand, as suggested) made the ribs spicy!! fine for my husband and I...not for our kids....they were way too spicy for them. sauce never thickened as others stated.I added some bbq sauce from my fridge to make it thicker. would not use this spice combo again, but maybe the method, although par boiling and then cooking low and slow works just as effectively.

GOOD FLAVOR, HOWEVER YOU CAN GET THE SAME TENDERNESS BAKING AT 500 COVERED FOR AN HOUR, THEN CRISPING UNDER THE BROILER.

I want to try my chicken rub next time. I used Pepsi since that's what I had on hand instead of beer. It was very tender and moist and enjoyed by the whole family.

AMAZING taste and so so tender and juicy! This was my very first time attempting ribs on my own and WOW! The only thing I had a problem with was the juice never thickened...but I brushed it on and broiled anyway and still so YUMMY!

Awesome! First time making ribs, they came out amazing and  the whole family was impressed. I cut back on the fajita seasoning and the brown sugar a bit, just used enough to cover the ribs nicely. I also substituted the honey for molasses.

These are the best ribs I've ever had! I followed the recipe exactly, using Old El Paso Fiesta salt-reduced seasoning (as one of the previous reviews said it was a bit salty).  These ribs were fall off the bone tender even before I broiled them.  Thanks for sharing the only rib recipe I'll use from now on.

Started the night before knowing I would need time to do it right. All the boys loved them. I had everything in the house except used what I believe is just regular paprika. Very tender and fall of the bone and great tasting.

The proportion of sugar alone in comparison to the other ingredients is ridiculous.  The amount of Fajita seasoning - considering it can only be purchased in packets - I bought 6 and it didn't even make half a cup.  Tasted dreadful and went in the bin.  Do not use this recipe.

The best! I put the ribs on the grill to brown before I put them in the oven and  I used dry red wine instead of beer, because that's all I had, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and they where excellent. I will be using this recipe from now on.

Excellent!  I have always struggled with ribs.  My husband usually barbeques them and it is hit or miss.  I'll be making them this way from now on.   I made this as stated as much as I could - used regular paprika and St. Louis style pork ribs because that is what I had.  Next time, I would probably add bbq sauce directly on the meat for the last 5 minutes but we're a family who love bbq sauce.  So good!

this was good. I had 1 rack baby back pork ribs and rubbed with mesquite grill spice from pantry and the brown sugar. mixed liquid as called for but added 1 tsp onion powder and 1 tsp sambal oelek (could've used a TBS as there still wasn't enough heat)
The sauce never really did thicken even after 30min and additonal 1/4 c brown sugar (I thought it tasted a tiny bit bitter from the garlic?) but after basting 2x while broiling for 6 min it carmelized nicely.
hubs n I both enjoyed, he took the leftovers to work! will do again, thank you.

these were just "okay", granted i did not follow the recipe exactly.  The meat just fell off the bone and maintained it's juiciness fairly well, but considering the effort to give it flavor, that was the area it seemed to lack.  Granted, i didn't have the Fajita seasoning (or brown sugar) so had to improvise and only marinated 2hrs vs overnight.  Will try again ... the concept of the foil wrap and slow cook works well ... just need to tweak the flavoring.  Also, i'm not sure what I did wrong, but I didn't see much use in simmering the drippings.  It never thickened for me & seemed an unecessary step.

I have made these ribs twice. They are absolutely the best home made ribs...follow the instructions and they will melt in your mouth.
The second time I made them I added some chipotle powder and cumin to my fajita seasoning.These were excellent addtions.

like everyone else said.. full of flavor! so good. I tasted the rub by itself before I put it on the meat, and It was so nasty. it made my stomach hurt. I thought there was no way this is gonna be good but I went with it anyways cuz of all the reviews and im glad I did! such a unique taste for ribs. I used chicken broth instead of beer cuz somebody drank it and I made the sauce used to pour over the ribs before cooking two more times (so i tripled it and used 1/3 for the ribs before sealing it in the foil) along with some brown sugar and paprika and thickened that up and used it as my final glaze bc what was on the pan was burnt black (but it didn't affect the meat). I also baked my 5 lb slab of ribs at 350 for one and a half hours, at 250 for one hour, and 325 for 30 min. I get scared with baking meat for a long time so I play with the temps a lot, but it came out perfectly. I will definitely be making this one again!

These ribs are awesome! I used a Dakota seasoning recipe I found online and substituted moscato for the beer since I wanted to save my last gluten-free beer for dinner. I also grilled them instead of broiling. They were so tender I had trouble getting them onto the grill. Best. Ribs. Ever.

Words can barely describe these wonderful ribs! I had never attempted to make ribs before, and this was so easy! I used a dutch oven to cook them (still covered with foil). Needless to say, this is my official rib recipe now! Thanks for sharing!

It was my first time ever making spare ribs in a oven, and this was the first recipe I found. It came out really nice. It was maybe a bit too sweet for me, but that is just a matter of taste.

The meat itself was terrific and very tender with a crispy outside. The one caveat, however, I'd say is the "reduction." I had a hard time reducing my drippings, and I was in a bind for time, so I ended up just putting my very watery drippings on the meat.  If you're okay with the idea of using something in a bottle, next time, instead of trying to reduce the drippings, I'd just use some BBQ sauce on it. It'd save time.  

Note: The beer I used was a Guiness, and I 1.5x the recipe since I had three slabs, so it might have taken some real time to  have to reduce that much.

Ok folks...if u like chewier, Meaty meat...my suggestion is follow as stated BUT COOK IN A LARGE PAN AS 1 and just put foil over the top w ventilation. I cooked it at 350  for 2 1/2 hrs n followed the ingredients to a T. I must say not bad at all!!!! VERY sticky and a heads up for those that have Hi and Lo settings only on their broil, go for LO for 3 1/2 Mins. My husband was tired after a LONG day at work n these perked him right up! Tender on inside chewy on outside. I really liked them! Thanks for a great recipe!

I used the fajita seasoning and the brown sugar and it's SO MUCH better than cola or Dr.Pepper! I used boneless pork ribs and they were super tender and turned out GREAT! FANTASTIC RECIPE, Thank you!

These ribs were soooo tasty!  And so tender.  I did not have fajita seasoning or Worcestershire sauce so i just left them out, no substitutes and we still loved them! live in Costa Rica and those items not so easy to find!  But I will work on replacements:). EZ clean-up as well.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe yesterday for the football game, it came out amazing! I didn't have paprika an used regular mustard instead.i let it cook for the full 4 hours and it was falling off the bone. I didn't broil it though I actually just chopped up the meat cooked let the meat simmer on the stove in the juice and we ate it as taco's!!! great idea.

I have made this recipe a few times and each time it comes out beautifully! I changed the amount of fajita seasoning because of the other reviews saying it was too salty. I also marinated the ribs like 24 hours. When I make the sauce to broil over the ribs I add more beer, brown sugar and garlic to the mix then boil till really reduced then I broil the ribs and slather it on like 5 times to get a really nice crunchy glaze on top! My boyfriend who swears he never had ribs before loved them!! Still talking about them!

Didn't use the rub in this recipe, but did follow everything else to the letter - the beer mixture for cooking and the cooking method.  Came out super moist and fall off the bone juicy!  Will make ribs this way all the time in the future.

I'm giving 4 stars because I did like the ribs, but I doubt if I will make this one again.  I would like to try other recipes in the hopes of finding one that has a more BBQ taste.  Maybe I should have added liquid smoke to the marinade?  The meat was very tender (I did marinade for 4 hours)and the ribs fell off of the bones.  It was the flavor that didn't knock my socks off.  I think I would have enjoyed store bought BBQ sauce better!  This sauce was just okay.

I've always been afraid of ribs.  The times I have made them, they just didn't come out the way I like.  These were wonderful and easy.  My sauce from the drippings didn't thicken as much as I would have liked, but to compensate, I broiled them twice.  It gave them ribs a nice coat, and they were still fall off the bone tender.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the outstanding recipe.

After reading many of the reviews, I decided to try this last night. I am not a fan of ribs, but my family is.  Made this exactly as recipe is and OMGoodness!!!  The meat just fell off the bones. My family LOVED it, and now I believe I do like ribs.  ((:  Definitely recommend this recipe!

The results were AMAZING!!! I followed the ingredients exactly as written. The only change I made was I cooked them for 2 1/2 hours at 275* and then added a lil bit of bbq sauce and about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar with the juices that were left over. I put the ribs on the charcoal grill, poured the sauce-mix over them, and grilled them for about 15-20 minutes to get that charcoal coating on them. They were absolutely delicious!!! My family said that was the best tasting ribs they had ever had :) Will definitely be making this again!! Huge hit!

I added half a bottle of liquid smoke & a tsp of smoke salt to give it that outdoor grilled flavor. You can also finish cooking this on a grill. I also added sesame oil. I had to heat up the liquid a bit to get the honey to blend. It kept sticking to the bottom. I'm going to try this recipe with brisket. I hope its just as good.

I didn't like the fajita/paprika seasoning (4 stars), but the method was brilliant (5 stars), so I'd say it's a 4-1/2 star recipe, but I didn't get that option. I'm going to try this again with a more traditional seasoning and I'll report back if I find any good combos!

Haven't yet eaten them yet - they're in the oven, but I loved how the dry rub smelled and how the basting sauce is making our house smell as these are baking! 

Loved the video!  Glad that I took the time to watch it!

The Bomb!!!  These ribs are worth the time it takes to prepare them.  Meat fell right off the bone.  After baking, I put these on the grill for about 10 or 15 minutes and coated with kc masterpiece bbq sauce.  I also used baby backs instead of spare ribs, and let them bake for 3 hours.  Will be making these again next weekend!

The ready in time for this recipe says it’s ready in 16hr, but there’s only 4 hours cook and 20 minutes prep. Seems like a good recipe but not sure what the timing is to cook properly!

Fantastic results! I only had taco seasoning for the rub so I used that, and smoked paprika. I used Redd's Wicked Apple Ale because it seemed like a good paring for the pork vs a darker beer. I let it sit overnight with the rub, then baked in the oven for three and a half hours at 250* like the recipe calls for. The drippings were pretty fatty, so like most everyone I tried to remove the fat and keep the juices. After simmering for ten maybe fifteen minutes, eventually I just poured whatever I was left with over the ribs. Back in the oven to broil....very tender, very good. Friends have requested the method of cooking and BF has asked for more to be made. Thank you so much for sharing!

Me and my husband both really loved these ribs.  Cooked to perfection, moist and the seasonings were absolutely delicious.  He said restaurant quality.  I agree.  Much better than bbq sauce

was way too much fajita seasing, I used masterfoods spice container and will avoid that rub in the future. The braised sauce just need some corn flour to thicken up. will make again with a different rub.

First time ever!!  And my husband loved it. The house smelt amazing. I had 3 racks and marinated the rub overnight. I used drippings and baby rays sauce. It thickened after about 7 minutes. Next time not so much drippings. Lol.

Great recipe!  My only advice would be to remove the membrane on the underside before rubbing in spices.  The membrane is tough and tastes bitter.

This is a very good well planned recipe. Like myself, other reviewers have noted that the writers process is the most important part, and many of the ingredients can be substituted for what suits your taste. Although my family and I think her ingredients are great. I also made it with Korean bar b que seasoning, turned out great.

Thanks a lot: At last (due to you) I have now made fall-off-the-bone ribs - I thought people exaggerated when they say "fall off the bone"; now I know what procedure (wrapping, temperature and time) to follow. Secondly, I personally did not enjoy the beer / malt taste / smell; next time I'll use cola (and less sugar) instead - but that's a personal preference.

Followed recipe with a couple changes.  Didn't have honey, used maple syrup.  And when I cooked down the juices, ( which took a lot longer than 5 min) I added some ketchup and brown sugar,  gave it a sweeter, BBQ sauce taste. Excellent, will make again!

My family loves this recipe.  I follow the whole recipe down the end except I don't use the drippings. The drippings gave the ribs a sour taste.  So I changed it to after the ribs are done cooking, I drain the juice from the foil and baste the ribs with BBQ sauce.  Then broil the ribs 5-10 minutes to caramelize on the ribs.  Yummy!

Excellent. I just made there’s with a few modifications. I used maple sugar instead of brown sugar and Dijon mustard instead of brown. I also used Adobe spice mix cus I didn’t have the other mix. Fall off the bone tender and delicious. Will make these again for sure.

It was wonderful and fall off the bone! I used wine instead of beer, and I didn’t marinate overnight and I had to increase the cooking temp to 300 to save time, but it was still great! I also added bbq sauce at the end to broil.

I used a simple mesquite smoke sauce and covered the ribs in foil and your cooking time was perfect for fall off the bone tender... next time I will take them out of the foil sooner to get the sauce tacky !! THANKS!!!

I made this according to recipe and it turned out fantastic. Absolutely no complaints, except I wish I would have made double. Ribs were very tender, falling off of the bone. The rub and sauce that you slather on at the end  were very flavorful and very good! I’ll be saving this recipe for anytime I’m making ribs!

This recipe turned out  perfectly for me. I used taco seasoning as opposed to Fajita seasoning and the ribs tasted great. No one at dinner chose to use the barbeque sauce that was available.

These were seriously so good, they literally fell off of the bone. I impressed myself that I was able to modify the recipe with what I had #1 but that my entire family devoured them. I followed the recipe somewhat exactly. I make my own taco seasoning and didn't have quite half a cup so I used what I did have. I also used regular paprika, and 1 rack of pork ribs versus two (I ended up throwing away a lot of the seasoning). We ran out of beer--HELLO it was New Years Day, so I substituted with A&W rootbeer. Other subsititutions I made were regular mustard because I didn't have brown mustard, and I didn't have honey--well planned I know. It seriously turned out amazing. These pleased ages 2 and up to 56. You will not regret making them.

SOOOOOOOO tender and delicious!  Only recipe change, replaced beer with rootbeer, because, Celiac.  Took shortcut and did not wrap in foil, baked in roasting pan with lid on.  Doubled "sauce" to bake in and cooked 3 1/2 hours at 225 degrees, then last hour  and half raised temp to 250 degrees (Total cooking time approx 5 hours-my ribs were smaller than the ones in the video).  Followed recipe exactly other than those minor changes.  Served with asparagus and rice pilaf.  YUMMMY!!!

These turned out incredible. I didn't have fajita mix so I used taco mix. I also added garlic power and ginger to the dry rub. I used beer in the foil wraps and then broiled with Baby Rays sauce for 10 min. AMAZING!

I made this yesterday and it was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly. (Except for the shiny/dull side of the foil, which makes NO difference.) Sealing the foil packet very well IS important and poor sealing could cause dry ribs. The meat was falling off the bones of mine, and the flavor was fantastic. I did mix BBQ sauce with the thickened braising juices before caramelizing (in video, not in recipe). Glad I did.

I left out the sugar since we don’t like sweet BBQ. Grilled them over real wood coals for 4 hours. Had some rub left over so made a dipping sauce by adding vinegar and oil. These were the best ribs I’ve ever had!

INCREDIBLE!!! Don't waste your time adding BBQ sauce; the rub and glaze is all you need.

I didn't have Fiesta seasoning for the initial dry rub. Used the 1 cup brown sugar, then added 1-1/2 tsp cayenne, 1 tbsp adobo, 1 tbsp chili powder, and 2 tbsp paprika. Only four hours in the fridge. Did the next steps per recipe. I kept the ribs in the oven for 4 hours but that was too long - next time will do maximum 3-1/2 or even 3 hours. Finished them off on the grill with a little Stubbs to char. They were falling apart on the grill, and they were awesome!!! Ironically, Stubbs spicy bbq sauce was on sale at the market and I had it in my fridge -- didn't even see this video until after I made these. It was a very nice addition.

This is one of those recipes I like to make when I’m having a tough week and I need the wife and kids to chill out and be quiet.  When this is served all you hear is mmmm’s and chewing.  I follow the recipe to the T, although this last time I substituted a ginger ale instead of beer and it was just fine.  My tip: pay close attention to the meat at that 3:45-4:00 mark.  In my 250F oven I have somewhat tough spare ribs at 3:30, but by 4:00 the meat won’t even hang on the bone.  Perfect is somewhere just prior to fall-off-the-bone.  Like it wants to be on the bone and you can cut the ribs apart, but a good knock on your plate and the meat will come loose.

This is the ONLY WAY I cook ribs! It is fantastic! I’ve been doing this recipe for several years now. Fajita season is really the key, trust me! Honestly I only use fajita season, paprika and light Brown sugar and let them soak over night in the fridge. Using the foil keeps them moist and tender and allows for even cooking. Sometimes when I have more time or my husband and I can eat later in the evening I just let them cook in he oven for about 6 hours and they’re great! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolute winner!!  Made them just as directed but with loose measurements and a cook time for 4+ hours at 325 so the meat fell off the bone.  Hubby says this is the way he wants his ribs cooked from now on.  This made me look like a rib pro even though I haven't eaten meat in over 20 years.  Thanks Kerri!!

I made these for Memorial Day. They were a BIG hit with the whole family.   Moist and fall off the bone with great flavor.  I didn’t have a fajita seasoning packet so I just looked up a recipe and made my own.   I also didn’t have honey so used some apple preserves and a little syrup.  You don’t need any BBQ sauce at all!!  Cooked on a rotating grill at 200 degrees for about 4 hours and the browned under broiler in oven.  Highly recommend!!

I made it very tender...But I didn't baste with dripping I put BBQ sauce on instead I thought drippings had to much fat in it and I didn't care for taste.

I made this exact recipe 3 times.  It makes (in my opinion) PERFECT ribs!  I have a grill, smoker, etc... but these are fall off the bone perfection with just enough spice and sweetness!  Try this recipe... it won't disappoint!

Marinated the ribs overnight then put the ribs in a slow cooker for 5 hours on low.   From there followed the next step:  thickened the sauce then coated the ribs with the sauce and broiled until caramelized.   Amazing and so flavorful.  Finger licking good .  Will absolutely make these again the same way.  Thanks for the new favorite

Amazing.  I used an electric roaster on 225 for 4 hours.  (The reason I used a lower temp is because the roaster runs hot.) The ribs were so tender, when I lifted them out of the foil with the tongs, they fell apart & a rib bone came out! I tried to thicken the drippings but didn't have a way to separate the fat so it didn't work. I ended up pouring a little Tastefully Simple Bayou Bourbon Glaze on them before caramelizing in the broiler & it was perfect. Pickiest Kids ate seconds! Definitely a keeper.

These are amazing!  As one other reviewer said about making them and not ordering in a restaurant - ME TOO!  
I made one change.  I made them during the week so skipped the foil packets and put them in my Crockpot Casserole for 8 hours on low.  I love a sweet BBQ sauce with spare ribs so I added about 3/4 C brown sugar when I simmered the sauce and I strained it first.  I served with brown sugar sauerkraut that I make for smoked sausage potato dinners made in the crockpot.

Wow!  Great recipe.  Easy to make, just make sure to use heavy foil to spare yourself a messy cleanup.
My changes: I used a BBQ seasoning from my favorite Colorado spice company with the brown sugar.  I used cola instead of beer.  
Result: Honestly, these are better ribs than we have had out in a restaurant in years.  Given how cheep ribs are to buy in the store, I won't order ribs in a restaurant again.

Update! I have to admit I'm not a fan of chili powder in anything, but with this recipe, it's not all that strong. However, I still wanted to try it without so this time I substituted McCormick's  Smokey Applewood season mix for the fajita mix. I also substituted real maple syrup for the honey. Having done this enough times, I've made a couple other tweaks. I double the  dry-rub ingredients and really slather each rack with the mixture. I see a few people have made comments about reducing the juices after the 3 hr. cook time - I find that if I spend some extra time skimming off the grease/fat from the juice, it seems to go significantly faster. That said, it still takes a good 15-20 min to reduce this to a glaze at medium heat. As I said, I've made these at least 6-7 times and they are a friend/family favorite! The down side is I no longer want to order ribs when I go out to eat, because nothing compares!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
STOP THE BUS! These were fantastic! As good or (dare I say) better than any ribs I've ever had at a restaurant. Thanks so much for sharing this. Definitely will be making again (SOON!)

This is a great and simple recipe. I've made this twice and the first time was good but 2nd time was amazing. The only thing I would add is after cooking, remove the top foil, slather them in your favorite BBQ sauce and broil on low for about 7-10 min to get that extra crispiness, texture and glaze bbq sauce action. Also, I cooked them for 5 hours, they were really fall off the bone ribs!

These turned out perfectly tender and flavorful. This will be my go to rib recipe!!! The broiling at the end was too long for my electric oven, next time I’ll reduce that time from 5-7 to 2-3 minutes under the broiler

Did this way but grilled on charcoal after baking instead of using oven broiler. Also for the rub used a premixed rub from grocery store,plus the packet of fajita seasoning that worked well. Added a splash of Tabasco to juices after taking out of oven and placing in sauce pan

I'm rating the method more than the rub, really, since I had no fajita seasoning. I used five spice powder instead. I had no beer either, so I poured some pineapple juice around the ribs before sealing the packet. I sliced a large onion, put half on the bottom of the packet, then the ribs, then the rest of the onion.  After four hours the ribs were fall apart done. I didn't need to broil them they were so done. I did brush on a little teriyaki sauce.  My default rib method from now on  while I play with different spices.

We slow cooked these on the grill, so didn't add the drippings to the glaze (just simmered that on the stovetop to thicken).   To me, the paprika in the rub was a little overpowering.   I would leave it out if I make this recipe again.  The glaze was wonderful.

This recipe was very good! they came out tender and delicious. Everyone loved them. I didn't have any Worcester sauce, so I just left that out, and didn't notice anything lacking. I'll try them again with and see the difference. I did find that half the drippings were plenty to thicken up and reduce for glazing at the end. We finished them on the grill instead of using the broiler. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Didn't them under the broiler at the end...they were incredibly good; meat fell right off of the bone- husband says they were the best home-cooked pork ribs we've had!

Absolutely delicious! This is my new go to BBQ recipe. Thanks! My only recommendation is when making the sauce into a thicker BBQ sauce for basting: skim the fat, add a 1/4 cup + 1 TBSP of light brown sugar; this will help sweeten the meat and cut down that "salty" fajita taste that others have commented on.

I did adjust the recipe a bit. I followed the rub and let the ribs sit overnight in the frig in a plastic bag. Instead of spare ribs I went with Baby Backs only because they were on sale and looked great. I cut the seaoning in half since I only had one rack of ribs. When it came to cooking them I used a broiling pan and put the beer and garlic on the bottom to help steam them. Added the rack and ribs and covered with foil tightly. Cooked @ 225 for 3 1/2 hours for one 3.5 lbs rib. Removed and let set for 10 minutes, heated the oven to broil top with BBQ sauce. Broiled for 3 minutes. OMG this was the best oven ribs I ever had!

Tha bomb diggidy. End of. Make these. OMG.
I guess I should add that I haven't ever used fajita seasoning because I use Emeril's "essence" instead. Still, have made these twice and I cannot say enough about how freakin good these are. My search for the best pork rib recipe is finally over!
Now if I could just find "the one" for beef ribs...

Turned out great! Didn't have beer so I just used 12 ounces of chicken broth and didn't have the mustard either. Still was delicious! Just threw on baby rays at the end. I cooked it at 275 for two hours then ran out time and put it 300 for an hour n change! My ribs have never been more tender !

Rib perfection.  I used an alternate  spice package that I picked up somewhere that had similar ingredients as the Fajita mix.  I'll be using this method again, changing up the ingredients with different spices, sauces, and types of beer to get different flavors.

Love it! I made it for my sister and my grandparents, after dinner there was almost none left! I think my older sister loved it the most! I didn't really change the recipe except i substituted the barbecue sauce, but it was still perfect! I would like to make this again!

Made it the first time as per the recipe, very good. Second time, tonight, changed the beer and Worcestershire sauce for some soy sauce, just a couple of tablespoons. Instead of boiling the sauce at the end just took off the lid and turned the grill on, absolutely delicious. Best ribs ever my husband said!

This was my first time making ribs. I used store purchased dry rub and followed the rest of the recipe other than not marinating overnight (I only did about 30 minutes). It turned out amazing! Wow! Incredible and better than any restaurant ribs I had.

This was an awesome recipe!! I didn't have time to leave the rub on overnight so I just left it for an hour. Next time I'd try to do it right, but the way they turned out was still fantastic.

I didn't use fajita seasoning but a Memphis BBQ seasoning instead, also no beer but  pure sugar root beer.  OK so I changed the recipe but used the technique here and finished with broiling as suggested....they were the BEST, most tender ribs EVER!  Will follow this procedure every time from now on

I made no changes because I like to see how the original recipe comes out. This was phenomenal, and hubby loved it. The recipe was easy and the ribs came out tender and moist. Next time, I will use a smokey spice mix like Penzeys Chicago Steak Seasoning or Weber Grill Mesquite. The fajita spices were great, but I would add a bit of liquid smoke to give it that grilled taste.

I am not a cook but I made this following the recipe and it was great. I had no juices left over so I just put some sweet baby rays bbq sauce on before broiling and they turned out perfect. I will surely make these again following this recipe!

This is my main rib go-to....better than any ribs you can buy anywhere.  The braising is the key.  I dry rub for a day before i marinade in liquid for 12 hours or so....then bake.....delicious....also i add a beer and a shot of whiskey to the foil packet marinade ... Shiner and Jim Beam Black to be specific

I didn't have time to marinade overnight. I just marinaded  for  2-3 hours hours. My rating was based on my family, and EVERYONE LOVED IT! I also forgot to add paprika but no worries. Even my picky teenagers. I only had one packet of fajita mix and it was just fine.  I think the people who complained about the ribs being tough didn't have good meat. Yes they fell off the bone just as I wanted.  This is a keeper and also the first time I did ribs all on my own.
2nd time I made them exactly as the recipe is written. I set the timer for 3 hours 40 minutes and then they just stayed in the oven until we were ready to eat.   The BBQ ones were  more popular in my family.  We made 4 racks for 9 people and had tons of leftovers.  It was just as moist and fell off the bone tender. I was thrilled.

It was ok but I guess I didn't let the meat marinade good enough cause the flavor didn't go all the way through. The outside did taste good however but I need to figure out how to make it have flavor all the way through.

This recipe was amazing. Didn't have time to leave the rub on overnight, instead did it for only 2 hours. Followed the rest of the recipe as written and the meat was literally falling of the bones when I removed from oven. Very tasty, was a hit with the family. Will definitely make again

These were falling off the bone and delicious. I was following a recipe where I boiled in pineapple juice but it wasn't consistent. Tried this one without changing anything and it was way better than boiling

This was great!! I rubbed the ribs and then put them on a  rack in the foil and put the beer mixture on the bottom and cooked them at 325 degrees for 4 hours. they were unbelievable!! Fall off the bone tender and just the right amount of heat. Will make these all the time! I put barbecue sauce on the last 10 minutes.

I used a gravy separator as suggested to get the juices apart from the fat. Most reviewers said the juices don't thicken and they are right. I added some  more brown sugar and about two teaspoons of flour to the juices to thicken it. I did not have beer so I used cola soda. I liked the flavor using the fajita mix. It took two packages to make 1/2 cup.  I placed the foil packets into aluminum pans which made cleanup a snap. As for cooking time I found that half the rack that was thinner cooked in the 3 hours. The other end of the rack that was very thick was not done enough and needed another 40 minutes to cook. I read that some finished their ribs under the broiler with BBQ sauce they liked. I wanted to see what this flavor was, so I did not do it. Next time I will brush on some Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce. It just caramelizes better under the broiler, although it will mask the flavor of the fajita rub.

This recipe is great! Some of the best ribs I have ever tasted!  I had 4 racks so I doubled the recipe.  I used 2 packets of the fajita mix and added 2 packets of mesquite dry rub.  For the liquid I used Stout beer, and it was really delicious.  I also put foil over the top of the whole pan in addition to the foil packets, so absolutely no steam escaped the pan.  They were fall off the bone tender.  I did cook them a little longer as well, since I had such a large amount of meat.  We made pulled pork sandwiches (by adding a little bbq sauce) with the leftovers the next day.  Absolutely wonderful!

The slow braising made the ribs super tender. I used my own rib rub recipe and finished on the grill rather than under the broiler, but followed the recipe's instructions for the braising liquid and reduction into glaze. The pork was so tender the bones just slipped right out of the meat.

Delicious.  So tender.  Easy.  Crowd-pleasing.  

We left it in the oven for 4 hours, because I was worried about it not being tender enough.  I should not have worried.  Next time I'll go for 3.5

The ribs came out really tender. The sauce didn't want to thicken. I used the sauce from both packages. I used it to glaze the ribs as they were cooking and it still turned out great. It was a bit spicy for my partner (i used 1/4 package taco seasoning -and Emeril's bayou blast -it's what i had in the house).  i used Baby Rays' on one rack and the drippings on the other and we both liked the drippings glaze better.

Absolutely loved these ribs!!  This was the first time I've ever made ribs. I made them for a family birthday party and everybody loved them. Many people were asking how I cooked them.  I extended the cooking time to be sure they were "fall off the bone delicious"  and it worked.  I will definitely make them again!  Thank you

This was the first time I've made ribs. I made this recipe and one using barbecue sauce. While the barbecue ribs were good, these are delicious. Everyone picked them as their favorite of the two.  I only used about a cup of the pan juice to reduce and glaze the ribs. After I regretted I hadn't reduced all of it to save for dipping or as a sauce for other things. Ribs are something we rarely have, but I'm looking forward to making these a again soon.

The only change was using water as opposed to the beer.   Skimmed some of the fat off of the drippings before boiling in the saucepan.   Finished on the grill basting with the boiled down sauce.   Very good!   Will defiantly make again.  Does not need extra sauce, they are very flavorful on their own.

I made it mostly as suggested, except I didn't have enough fajita seasoning so added chipotle taco seasoning to the dry rub.  Also only let the dry rub stand in the refrigerator for about 6 hours but it still had big flavor and was spicy.  I finished it on the grill with hickory smoke and paired it with a huge Washington Merlot (BFM from Dusted Valley).  It was fall off the bone tender, juicy and awesome!!!!

I made no changes. I used McCormick's Fajita mix. Two packages equal 1/2 cup. It didn't say what kind of beer. I had Guinness extra stout beer on hand so I used that. Every person at dinner just couldn't stop talking about how wonderful these were. In fact some were licking up the savor from the platter. I did bake these for 4 hours at 250 degrees. If you want to be able to chew the meat off the bone these will disappoint you because the meat fell off and left bare bones. Can't figure out how anybody could mess this up unless they didn't put the rub on the night before and didn't bake it slow as described. It's a no brainer that I will be making these again.

We had these for dinner last night and they are so yummy! I didn't let them sit in the dry rub overnight because I found this recipe the morning I wanted to make them. But they did sit in it for a few hours. I also didn't have a fajita seasoning packet so I made my own.  I did reduce the sauce at the end and it was so worth it! While reducing it down I drizzled some more honey on the ribs and some BBQ sauce. Then the reduction and they came out of the broiler with the perfect amount of sweet, salty and char. Great recipe!

The recipe was good, but turned out a little to sweet to our liking, that and the sauce didn't thicken enough. I also wasn't able to let them sit overnight, only about an hour, which I feel would've helped the over all outcome. Next time I will plan ahead better and let set overnight, and also add about another hour cooking time. Also though I feel the outcome of these really rests on the meat available. My local stores ribs didnt have much meat on the bones...I would like to find a meatier rib next time as well.

This was fabulous! I did not have fajita seasoning and so I used my own rub that I love, ( I always have a some prepared and ready to go. Brown sugar, Montreal Steak Spice, Garlic powder, Chili Powder, Cayenne Pepper, Sea Salt). I used the cooking liquid as suggested in the recipe. I read a reviewer saying she used the crock pot and thought well that is very similar to closed pouches and that is what I did. I cooked them in the crock pot on low for 5 hours, put the juices in a pan and thickened them, finished the ribs by broiling as recipe suggests. Totally delicious, fall off the bone tender. My family was so impressed. I can hardly wait to make these again!

Kids even loved it!!I didn't add the beer instead I used some bbq sauce. I didn't have as much time so I didn't marinate and cooked it at 500 for 15min and then dropped it to 250 for about 1 1/2 hrs. Turned out amazing !! Definitely will make again.

great! did not do overnight marinade - followed directions w/beer, etc added little liquid smoke- put each rack in own alum foil packet - baked @250 for 3 hrs - let cool - put on grill w/BBQ sauce very tender - grill did not flare up
like baby backs better than other cuts of spare ribs
have given recipe to quite a few friends - they will never make ribs any other way!

(Tip:  I found it helpful to watch the video of her making these.)  AMAZING RECIPE!!!  We hosted a Labor Day BBQ for about 30 of our friends and family.  I had NEVER made ribs before, and I was nervous about not testing this recipe first.  All I can say is, follow the directions exactly, and your ribs will be all of the rage!
The only thing I did differently was triple the recipe for six racks of ribs, and we finished them on the bbq with bbq sauce instead of the reduced sauce like the recipe recommends. (I also had problems reducing the sauce, like a few other reviewers, so the bbq sauce was a good back-up.)
The meat fell off of the bones, and the recipe got rave reviews. (I was very skeptical about using the fajita seasoning, it seemed really... weird, but it was definitely the magic ingredient!)
I can't wait to make these again!

There're a couple things wrong with this recipe.

First, there's no easy way to check doneness.  At 3 hours and 30 minutes, the ribs were falling apart---totally overcooked.

Second, the left over drippings are, essentially, beer and fat.  You can boil them til doomsday and they will neither thicken nor taste good.  Don't know why I should have expected otherwise.  In my case, I had enough time to make up a batch of barbecue sauce---which will hopefully make this mush edible. Avoid.

Love, love, love this recipe! I made it exactly as directed and it was perfect, except that my foil broke open and spilled hot juices on my hand which blistered badly. The second time I made them I did them in my roaster, not in foil, and they were perfect again! This time no burns!

This recipe is all wrong to me. In my opinion, the use of beer as the liquid base is what sends it off in the wrong direction, ultimately giving the meat a spoiled flavor. I'm going to try it again, using water or chicken broth or beef broth instead, and see whether it improves. Also, I'll point out that this cooking method doesn't do anything to help the pork fat cook off. As a matter of fact, I threw these ribs on the grill to try to recover them. That, and a bottled sauce, and they were much better.

I made ribs for the first time using this recipe and followed the recipe as written except we grilled in the end. They turned out absolutely delicious!  My kids even came back for more. We will definitely be making these again.

Disappointing Results. I followed this recipe exactly but only flavour evident was that of boiled alcohol (Brooklyn Lager. Only difference I can think of is that I hadn't trimmed off excess fat or membrane from back of ribs.

I loved one of the reviews above that said  OH. MY. GOD.  ...  :)  This is a fantastic recipe!!  Save to your recipe box now!!  We spent have a day searching for this.. and didn't find it until now..  (after using another recipe for the rub.. and not marinating overnight..  )  So we will see how they turn out! We loved it the first time..  and have waited two months too long to have these again!!

These were soooo good. The DH said "You killed it" and thats high praise. I didnt pour all of the beer mixture into the foul packets though. I left maybe 3 tablespoons left. I mixed that with BBQ sauce and just used that to broil them at the end. Thank you!!

WOW - these ribs were the best I have ever had. This recipe was easy to follow, and there was enough flexibility that if you wanted to "tweek" it, you could. These ribs were SO tender and so tasty. After the slow baking, we did put it on the grill and they were almost falling off the bone before they got to the serving dish.

I made these for July 4th.  I found the recipe at 10am and immediately started the marinade with the rub.  Love that I had everything on hand. At 3:30 I started baking them until 7pm when I finished them on the grill.  AWESOME!!!!  Tender and Delicious.  My sauce never thicken even after half hour on the stove...it may have been because I used gluten free beer.  It really didn't matter much because they were so good and even better the next day for left overs.

Delicious!! I didn't have fajita seasoning so I used chili powder and cumin to taste instead. Also added minced, dried onion and garlic powder and onion powder to taste. I added my favorite BBQ sauce to the drippings to thicken it a bit. It was  hit!!

we did 4 slabs of ribs this way for our 4th of July BBQ. They were a hit!  I followed the directions exactly, except used a can of coke instead of the browm sugar, like others suggested.  And we baked for 2 hrs and then finished them off on the grill.  Best ribs ever!

I gave it 5 stars for the taste of the ribs, however, when they were done cooking and I went to pour the juices to thicken before broiling it was so much grease from the ribs. It could not be used. I made a homemade BBQ sauce and used that for the broiling. I also used just half beer and added half coke.

Thanks for the baking technique! I didn't use fajita seasoning as I couldn't find some where I live so I used salt and pepper instead. I skipped marinating overnight and it was a mistake as the meat came out a hit bland. It was not a problem with THIS SAUCE, though. Very yummy!

I didn't actually make the sauce, but the cooking instructions were perfect - I used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce instead.  Next time maybe I'll try to make the sauce, but I'm not all that confident I could do it right.  Anyway - the ribs were perfect - Thanks.

My family loves this recipe, Instead of the oven I use a slow cooker for the same amount of time. comes out delish every time. The fajita mix I use is tastefully simple, I  also don't use the paprika either.

This was the best ribs recipe I have ever made. I thought I had fajita seasoning but it was all taco seasoning. I used that instead and I thought it was fine. The sauce didn't end up thicken up for me as much as I wanted so I mixed it was bbq sauce I already had. You don't need extra sauce unless you really want it. Awesome recipe.

These ribs were unbelievably tender, with the meat falling off the bone. My family thought they were tasty, but a touch bland. Perhaps I should have brushed more sauce over them. Anyhow, we spiced up the leftovers with a little store-bought BBQ sauce and it was fantastic. I will be making these again!

Awesome recipe! Followed this recipe exactly and they were a huge hit.  My Texan sister and brother in law insisted on the recipe and said they are as good as any rib joint in Texas! Thank you so much for sharing!

awsome ribs! we have made these ribs three times now and they were so good. The only thing was the sauce didn't thicken like i thought.
