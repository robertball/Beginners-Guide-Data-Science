This was excellent! My husband and I had never had chicken spaghetti before, and I thought this recipe was very easy to make. I read some of the reviews saying that it was too cheesey or gooey. Instead of using an 8 oz box of spaghetti, I used a 13 oz. And I still cut down the cheese to 1/2 pound and the sauce amout was perfect. We will be making this again!!

This is awesome.  I have tried several chicken spaghetti recipes but this is by far the best.  I think most kids would like this....mine are just weird...they only like tacos.

This recipe is great with 1 onion, 1/2 of a bell pepper, and a stalk of celery.  Finely chop all of these and then saute  them in a few tablespoons of butter.  Mix all together with condensed mushroom soup instead of chicken and at least 12oz. cooked spaghetti noodles.  Cheese and rotel amounts are still the same.  The best way to cook I have found, however, is to combine all and then bake in 350 oven for 30 minutes.  Salt and pepper on top.  Delicious.  A great recipe I have always loved with these simple changes.

Very enjoyable, I doubled the recipe for a large family gathering and it was a success with all the adults.  The tomatoes and green chiles were a problem for the children, but overall everyone enjoyed the dish.  I did choose to place in a casserole and heat in the oven to melt the cheese thoroughly. I served with candied baby carrots, italian green beans, mashed potatoes, and frence bread with garlic spread.  I was very pleased with this recipe.

Very good. Has the simpicity and satisfaction of real comfort food. Even my picky husband asked me to make it again. I left out the green chile peppers (on account of the picky husband) but it was still very tasty and didn't taste like there was anything missing. To make it quicker, though, next time I will just cook the chicken in a pan or microwave while the pasta is cooking-it doesn't really have to be boiled.

This was OK, not great, not bad, just OK.  Kind of like a REALLY spicy macaronni and cheese with chicken in it.

Pretty dang good. My changes: A lot less cheese, maybe 1/4 pound or 1/3 pound. I used the 2% velvetta. I used a lot less pasta and I used rotini instead of spaghetti cause I had a box open.

I had to add a bit of water, maybe 1/4 cup, to make it possible to stir it.

I added maybe 1.5 tbs garlic powder and a little fresh ground pepper. I didn't think it needed any salt.

Used shredded cheddar cheese instead of velveta.  Added 16oz. of light sour cream.  Family loved this recipe!  Will fix again.

I have a recipe that is very similar, except only using 10 ounces of velveeta instead.  It seems like an  entire pound would be too much.  Also, to add a nice touch, crumble some cooked bacon into it or add fresh mushrooms (I do both).

I'm sorry.  Velveeta?  1200mg sodium?  I couldn't get over the fact that it felt as if I were eating liquid lead.  Disgusting.

I think it would have been great...but after I had it almost prepared I realized I didn't have velvetta cheese. So since I was starving I added shredded cheese, it was too dry and had no flavor so I added a little ranch dressing. I ended up with a cheesy chicken ranch dish!

This is an okay recipe.  It was really easy to make.  I thought that there was way too much onion in it for the amount of pasta and sauce.  The onion was all that I could taste.  Overall it made an okay meal.

This was great! We are watching our calories, so we substituted a can of cheddar cheese soup for the velveeta. Husband and kid loved it.

I absolutely LOVED this!  I even used canned chicken, and it was excellent.  My aunt has a recipe for chicken spaghetti that is just as good, but much more complicated.  This is the version I'll be making for years to come.  

PS - I used Rotel Original for the diced tomatoes, which made it spicier than it should have been.  I loved it that way, but my husband thought it was a little too spicy.  I also used more than a "pinch" of garlic powder (at least a full tsp).

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I made some changes because I had to use what I had on hand. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and I used a can of stewed tomatoes (jalapeno, cumin and garlic flavor), undrained and chopped up the tomatoes, instead of the diced tomatoes with green chile. I also cut back on the cheese to about 1/2 lb and I used about 1/3 mexican velveeta and 2/3-2% velveeta. I didn't add garlic because the tomatoes had garlic in them. This was WONDERFUL!! I had my doubts about it when I was cooking it because I've never had anything like it, but boy, was I wrong! My whole family loved it, including my picky 14 year old! I told them next time I could try it the way it was written and they told me not to change a thing because it was great the way I fixed it! This one is definately a keeper and very easy too! I also think this would be good without the chicken.

I liked this basic recipe for chicken spaghetti; real easy to make if you are in a hurry.  I ended up changing it up a bit though;  8 oz. of the processed cheese.  I also sauteed in butter chopped mushroom, celery, 2 cloves garlic, and green onion tops. I also added chicken broth, enough to make it easier to stir before I put the dutch oven in a 350 oven for about 30 minutes.

This was a great quick meal.  I made it for my parents, brother and even picky husband.  No leftovers :(  I did only use half of the processed cheese and it came out very creamy and cheesy.

I didn't care for this recipe. I thought that it sounded a bit like cheese dip, it was literally cheese dip with noodles. So all in all, mush, even though i thought it might be that beforehand and cooked the noodles al dente.

I used 16 ounces of spaghetti, and only half the cheese.  I also sauteed onions, bell peppers and garlic in butter, and added that in ... terrific !

This was pretty tasty! After reading reviews, I too cut the cheese back to 1/2 a pound (light velveeta), and I think it could still use a little less. And don't get me wrong, I LOVE cheese! Still, a very enjoyable comfort food. Next time, I think I might try it with cream of mushroom soup instead. It just felt like that mushroom flavor was missing.

I personally would give this 5 stars. My children gave it an average of 4 though. It's got a little heat to it. I love that...my children don't. That being said, I made it as written w/ the exception of using elbow macaroni instead of spaghetti because it's all I had. I used 16 oz of macaroni as well. It's the perfect combo...and I topped w/ crushed buttery garlic club crackers (mixed w/ about 3 Tbsp melted butter) and popped it in the oven at 350 for 15 min. YUMMM!

Good recipe. I fixed it according to the recipe and did not really LOVE it. So I fixed it again but made some changes. I cut the chicken into bite sized chunks, added an extra chicken breast, a can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of green chilies no tomatoe, a cup of sour cream and some sauteed onion & celery. We liked it so much that we made two more dishes the next day!

This is so yummy.  I used stewed tomatoes with garlic and onion instead of diced tomatoes.  I also used only 8 oz of processed cheese instead of 16oz.  I am so pleased with this recipe and I will be serving it again.

This Recipe was Fantastic! Great weeknight meal as it was very easy to prepare. Boiling the chicken took a little while but it was very tender and made shredding it easy. May put it in the crock pot over night next time. I only used 1 pot to cook everything so clean up was a breeze! I did add a little bit of salsa to give it more of a kick and I also used pepper jack cheese, we like extra SPICY!

This is a great family pleaser.  I've been making this for awhile and everyone always loves it.  You can adjust the heat by adding the mild or hot Rotel tomatoes.  I always serve mine with garlic bread and a salad on the side.

It was okay, good simple comfort type food. I would make this again one day probably, just b/c it was so easy. My daughter did not care for it though, I think it might have been the rotel.

My sister served this at Thanksgiving and I just had to try to make it myself.  The only thing I did differently is how I cooked it - instead of boiling it all down, after I mixed all of the ingredients together I baked it into a 9X13 pan and then topped it with more cheese.

I made just a few adjustments to the recipe and it was DELICIOUS!! I used 1 lb of boneless skinless chicken breasts and only 6 ounces of velveeta. I also used one can of Hatch's brand diced tomatoes with green chiles GARLIC flavor (medium) in place of adding garlic powder. My friends LOVED it! I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I only gave this delicious recipe four stars due to its horrible amount of sodium. I recommend using no salt added diced tomatoes and chopping your own green chile. Also use reduced sodium soup. I added a little garlic powder to this for flavor and no added salt.

I gave it a 5 for ease. But it definitely was a good quick meal. I used 1.5 pounds penne noodles instead because I had them on hand. After cooking the noodles in the chicken broth I left just enough broth in the pan to cover the noodes.Then added the cheese and soup so it wasn't a thick mess like others experienced. I also used two cans of rotel tomatoes as my family loves "spicy" Quick,very easy and the kids loved it!!

Delicious!  My family loved it.  Once I combined everything and had it mixed up really well, I put it in a casserole dish and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top and put it in the over until the cheese melted.  If you don't like a little spice, use the mild Ro-tel.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

SKIP the horrendous predigested chemical-filled overly nasty fake cheese. I used 1/2 pound of Tillamook cheddar, grated and heated with the cream of chicken soup and the Rotel tomatoes and 1 tsp onion powder. I mixed it with the chicken and 1 pound of spaghetti noodles and heated through. My guys loved it. I also put in half a pound of cooked frozen peas. Plenty for leftovers. Don't ever use the plastic cheese, guys.

Loved it! Used 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and that was enough. It'd be good with a little more but I try to keep cheese at a minimum. I add green peppers too.

This is my second time making this recipe for up to 8 people. This time around the only changes I made were: as the noodles cooked, I took the chicken broth and poured just a little over the chicken that was shredded so it would not be dry. My family and friends loved it!

This was a great meal! I added fresh colored bell peppers, onions, jalapeno & garlic & sauteed it before adding soup, rotel, noodles & chicken. I took the advice of Amanda & used 12 oz of noodles & 1/2 lb of Velveeta. Thanks for the recipe Teresa!

I felt it was to cheesy and not enough chile and tomato.  But my bf said it wasn't cheesy enough - go figure!  I would probably add some milk to make it creamy, because once it set it was sticky.  Otherwise this was good and got really good reviews from my family.

Always an easy dinner choice that your family will enjoy...  I use about 3/4 block of Velveeta instead of the entire pound and make sure to cut it up into cubes before adding to the pot to melt.  If I find it too thick for my liking, I will sporadically pour in a few ounces of milk as the cheese is melting. Makes for a tastier dish.

Of course you have to alter the recipe to fit your individual taste as fas as the amount of cheese goes.

Way too much Velveeta.  I will try to make this again but with only half as much Velveeta.  It came out tasting basically good but mostly to rich and heavy.

This is really yummy.  It's almost like eating queso for dinner, but you can rationalize eating it because it has chicken and pasta in it. My guess is that this is way too fattening to be a part of the regular meal rotation, but it makes a good treat! I did find the cheese sauce a bit thick, so I'll add some water next time.

This was great.  I didn't have any diced tomatoes, so I threw in a little mild salsa.  Whenever I made this, I felt like there was way to much sauce for the amount of noodles, so I ended up using 16 oz. of noodles.  I added a little milk to thin it down a bit, and added some sauteed mushrooms.  Very good!

This is an excellent recipe and so easy! It is actually so easy that I was skeptical but wanted something that could be made quickly after work. We all really enjoyed it, including my really picky DH. I didn't change a thing except I used Mexican Velveeta and hot Ro-tel since we like spicy foods. I highly recommend it.

This was really good, but next time I make it I would either add more pasta or cut back on the cheese.  It was too saucy for the amount of pasta and I added a little milk.

Family was skeptical at first but loved it. Just a couple of changes, added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, only 1/2 lb of velveeta and used whole wheat pasta. It's made the do it again list, high honors.

This was great.  This makes a lot of spaghetti, I used the whole pound of velveeta.  We only ate about 2/3 of the entire dish! Very rich. I also added a chicken broth cubes to the water for more flavor.

It was just ok. Not great, not bad. It definitly could use less velvita, it tasted so much like cheese and not chicken. I added rotel and it did help a little. My husband ate his plate and I did eat most. I may make again when I have all the ingredients and don't feel like cooking a major meal.

I tried this as a short cut, week night meal in place of my 3 hour prep 'Chicken Spaghetti' and it just did not flow with us.  It taste like Rotel Dip mixed with Cream of Chicken soup, add chicken and serve over spaghetti pasta---

Our Army Wife group is feeding 100 hungry soldiers tomorrow so I wanted to make something that fed a lot of people that was also economical.  I doubled the recipe, everything except for the Velveeta.  I left it at 1 lb.  The only thing I added was some fresh parsley and mixed it with the other ingredients and I added bread crumbs to the top along with parsley and paprika.  It's wonderful!!  I love this recipe and will definitely make again!!

This was so fast and easy.  The only thing I changed was sauting fresh onion and garlic (instead of garlic pwdr).  Oh! And b/c another reviewer said it was a little dry I reserved a 1/4 cup of the broth and added it in which helps a lot!!! This is a keeper!

This is a quick, use what you have in the pantry kind of rushed weeknight dinner recipe.  My husband thought it was good, but I thought the combination of creamed soup and velveeta was to thick.  I may try this again w/ less velveeta or perhaps use real cheese instead.

Delicious and easy! However, I used about double the amount of spaghetti noodles that the recipe calls for. I also used Extra Hot Rotel-- only do this if you love REALLY spicy food!

This is very good, kind of a grown-up twist on mac n' cheese, but still kid friendly. The velveeta makes it very rich & creamy. Although if anyone's sensitive to spice you'll want to taste it before adding any pepper, as the green chili tomatoes already have a slight kick. The only change I made was to use 16oz of spaghetti instead of 8, and there was still a very generous amount of sauce. This was a very easy and yummy weeknight meal, and if you have leftover chicken it can be made in just a few minutes.  My kids, hubby & I all really enjoyed it!

Soo good!  I DID NOT change a thing to this recipe!  Your husband and family will eat it up!  I have tried tons of chicken spaghetti recipes, and this is definitely my favorite!

I liked this better than some other chicken spaghetti recipes I've had. I like the idea of the velveeta and rotel combo, but it was a little spicy for my tastes. When I make it again, I just won't put as much rotel in it. I'm pretty sure I boiled the chicken too long, which made it a bit chewy, I think I might bake it next time. I still think this is a keeper!

Delicious! So cheesy too. I was hesitant to try this without any tomato products but my husband and I both loved it and will make it again.

I've never had chicken spaghetti before, so I don't really have any basis for comparison.  But my family and I really enjoyed this recipe!  Even my picky/spice-phobic 6 year old son chowed down without a word and when he was done said "Yum! This is a keeper!" The only adjustments I made were that I used a whole package of spaghetti (16 oz.), used all the spicy liquid goodness from the tomatoes/peppers and added some onion powder in addition to the garlic powder and freshly cracked pepper.

Used rotisserie chicken, left out the tomatoes and chilis, and substituted parmesan for processed cheese and cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken soup.

This was okay. I have tasted a better recipe. I suggest you cut the chicken into bite size pieces instead of grating it. Also add some fried mushrooms and onions.

This recipe was great! My husband was skeptical when I told him about it, but in the end went for seconds. I used whole wheat penne rather than spaghetti, it held the sauce nicely. I know I used less cheese than the recipe called for, but I tend to start with about 1/3 of what the recipe says and then just add more as I go along. I found it a little thick for our taste so I added a splash of beer which gave it a wonderful flavor. The tomatoes with chilis really give it a nice twist! This is definitely one of those dishes that will go on my weeknight rotation.

This is one of my favorite meals to make.  My husband and my children love it as well.  I use Cream of Mushroom soup because I prefer the flavor and I use Cheddar cheese because I don't like Velveeta.  I use plain diced tomatoes too.  I cut way down on the cheese so that it is not too much.  I use between 1/4 lb. and 1/2 lb. instead of a whole lb.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and added more pasta (the whole box), more chicken (4 breasts instead of 3), and used less cheese (only 1/2 a lb). I also added Tony Chachere's, onions, and green bell pepper. With those modifications, this recipe was extremely good. I served it at a meeting along with traditional ground beef spaghetti, and the chicken spaghetti practically flew off the plates. Nearly everyone had seconds. I will definitely make it again.

I followed other's advice and cut down the cheese. I put 8oz in and it was still TOO CHEESY. I think the recipe would have been good with very minimal cheese. I won't be making this recipe again.

This was a big hit in my family! To reduce the fat content, I used Campbell's Healthy Request cream of chicken soup (98% fat free) and used only half of the cheese and it was plenty cheesy and the flavors were delicious! I also added a little milk just to make the sauce a little more creamy. I know this is a hit when my husband wants to take left-overs to work and my 7-year-old wants to take left-overs to school the next day! :-)

Delicious, easy, fairly quick meal. I used cream of celery soup because that is what I had and cut the cheese in half.  Doesn't look the prettiest, but really flavorful and a great weeknight meal. A little spicy but not overly so.

This recipe was way too cheesy.  It was hard to finish my serving and my husband agreed.  Next time I'll try 1/2 the cheese and maybe more cream of chicken soup?

We had mixed reviews on this one in our home. Hubby loved it (had three helpings) but my six year old hated it. I followed the instructions other then I used 2 cans of chicken breast. I didn't have tomatoes with chili's so I just used a can of diced tomates. I thought it was good and very filling. Would make again.

If I had to rate this strictly on how this turned out this evening, I would have to rate this 3 stars.  This is only because, in our opinion, it was too cheesy.  We followed the directions to the letter.  It was a gooey mess.
I do not have an excuse, because I did read the other reviews where the people said that it might be a bit too cheesy.  So, the 4 star rating I gave this recipe is based on the fact that we truly loved the combination of flavors!!  The only change next time will be to decrease the cheese substantially! And yes, we love cheese too, so for us to say that it was too cheesy says a lot!  :)

This was pretty good, and I'll probably make it again sometime, with some minor tweaks.
I think the portion of spaghetti should probably be higher; there seemed to be too much sauce and chicken for my taste; it was almost too cheesy, and I love cheese.

This recipe was pretty good.  I din't have a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes w/chile on hand so I made a substitution of one can of petite diced tomatoes w/mushrooms and a 4 oz can of diced green jalapenos.  The jalapenos made it entirely too spicy for me - next time I make it I will use diced green chiles which are much milder.  Or I will use the Ro-tel tomatoes.  Also, I din't use the full pound of Velveeta - only a half pound and it was still very cheesy and creamy.  Overall, it is a good recipe and would make again.

I don't know if I did anything to mess this recipe up, but I followed the directions exactly and it was a big, goopy mess.  It tasted okay - almost like cheese/rotel dip with noodles, but it wasn't very pretty and very gooey. Maybe the noodles were overcooked.  We just ate a couple of bites.

Not bad.  I may try to substitute a higher quality cheese sauce for the Velveeta next time though.  We doubled the pasta and even with this in place the cheese nearly overwhelmed everything.  However, it was still a good weeknight dish - easy and quick to prepare, which is why I would make it again.

I cut this down to three servings because it was just for the carnivore man. I did use suggestions and sautéed onion and celery in butter. I didn't have bell but did have shrooms, so I added those. Then added the soup, tomatoes, pasta and cheese. I also put it in a casserole dish topped with spicy bread crumbs and baked till brown while I steamed some vegetables, toasted garlic bread and made a salad. He loved it. It was great comfort food. Will have to do this again.

I would make again, I took the suggestion to use only 8oz on Velveeta. Would probably use a little more next time.

It took a little while and several modifications, but I was finally able to get the recipe to a point where I felt that I really liked it.  Of course, much of that is probably on me for not following the recipe precisely, but I was trying to find an easy recipe that would allow me to use what I had on hand.  This recipe is exactly that.  It is easy to use and follow, and also easy enough to modify to taste.

Made earlier this week and my kids haven't stopped talking about It! Per other reviews, I cut the cheese down(I did the spaghetti as well though!)  And it was a HUGE hit! I made it again this evening with less impressive results.Still amazing , might I add! Iadded too much cheese and  was a little heavy handed on the garlic powder. ITS A WINNER,FOR SURE!

Great easy recipe. I modified it some for quantity and flavor enhancements: 12 oz spaghetti, 2 cans of condensed cream of chicken soup, and 1 small can of pieces and stems of mushrooms. I also ended up pouring the liquid from the can of diced tomatoes and chilies peppers in it for flavor.  Even with adding this liquid, it stayed very thick.
(I used a package of chicken halves instead of the breasts just because I already had it.)
Family loved it!!

This is the best recipe for chicken spaghetti! Hubby and I make it at least 2 times a  month. It freezes great! I cook it and freeze leftovers. Taste as good as fresh made. It's a keeper!  I Ialways add extra cheese on top.

Fast, easy, filling and cheap! the whole meal cost me $15. I used cans of precooked chicken to save time and I couldn't even tell a difference! Such a good recipe! For added goodness, we added flaky crescent rolls :)

So easy! The hardest part was boiling the chicken! And how hard is that? Not.  I did change it up, only because my son wanted me to use the Queso Blanco Velveeta. I used  1 lb of it, I figured it'd be too cheesy otherwise since I also used 8 oz of medium cheddar. Then grated some cheddar on top. I will make it with the recommended Velveeta. This was just special for my son. I couldn't have asked for an easier CP recipe!  Thank you.

I made a few tweaks to the recipe. 

Since I boiled the chicken then cooked the noodles in the chicken broth, I didn't want to add cream of chicken because the noodles had absorbed that flavor so I used cream of mushroom instead. 

My family is a bunch of picky eaters so if it's chunky, they won't eat it so I blended the rotel until it was nice and smooth. 

I also baked mine in the oven once I had everything combined because my pot wasn't big enough to try and melt the cheese on the stove. 

It's also tasty is you wanted to add crushed crackers to the top for a little crunch (Ritz crackers might be too rich so try something a little less bold).

I made this with my own few twists. Family n I absolutely loved it. I used a rotisserie chicken from the store, a can of Rotel, a can of cream of chicken soup,  a brick of Velveeta cheese,  and some shredded cheese. I shredded the chicken and mixed all of the ingredients. Then put it all into a baking dish n topped with the shredded cheese and baked til cheese was melted n it was all nice n bubbly. Amazing!!! Making it again right now as I type this lol.

Used penne since my husband doesn't like spaghetti (weird, I know), and left out the tomatoes and chilies. Very good, and next time I'll make sure to have the tomatoes and chilis, maybe some mushrooms as well.

I should of read the reviews and put less Velveeta. However since I am becoming quite the cook I knew to add some milk and it wasn't a complete fail. I will make it again because my husband is a big fan of chicken spaghetti but for me to enjoy it I will put less Velveeta and probably 2% next time..

It's definitely a great basic recipe! I added a bunch of spices and hot sauce to get that perfect kick to it.

Very good!  I used a rotisserie chicken and deboned it. I added onions, bell peppers & celery, the frozen seasoning blend.           I also added extra cheese & baked it for about 20 minutes.  It was. a hit with my husband & grandkids.  I will make this again!

Really good! I used 2 cans of chicken (one shredded one cubes) one can of diced tomatoes AND a 7 oz. can of diced green chiles...that is what I had in pantry, and 12oz. Package of spaghetti. Oh also sautéed 2 stalks celery with 1 onion and one clove garlic. The crunch of celery was complimented by my bf and I enjoyed too.

All of the ingredients are things my family loves, and I really wanted it to be a dish we could enjoy often. However, it was tro heavy. If I make it again, I will use only half the amount of velveeta the recipe calls for.

The kids really loved it.  Mine wasn't that spicy.  It depends on the amount of chills you put in it and how hot they are.  With my kids, it's better not to make it spicy.  It's definitely a nice cheesy dish.  Easy to make and I think a lot of additional ingredients are possible.

I have made this twice. The first time according to the recipe without any changes. I like to do this to see how good the original recipe is. But the second time I made it I tweaked it a little to my own taste. I added 8 oz. sliced mushrooms (2 small cans), 1/4 th cup of chopped black olives and increased the garlic powder to 1Tbsp. This came out so good I had a second helping...which I normally never do. Served it with salad, garlic toast . Wonderful.

I made this and it turned out fantastic.  I changed a couple things such as:  I cut the chicken into chunks and cooked it in a fry pan, I used Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles and I used the mexican style velveeta. This was quick, easy and delicious. I will make this many more times.

I make a similar recipe with 2 cups macaroni, soup, 2 c water.  Bring to boil, simmer with lid on 10-12, add 2 c veggies, chicken. Add only 8oz cheese.  Tried it with a can of diced tomatoes.  Sautéed some onions and bell pepper before using the pot to boil spaghetti in a bit of chicken stock.  If you like the taste of velveeta, you'll love this.  It was plenty cheesy and i saved a cup of the boiling pasta water to thin out the sauce in the end.  I added cubed chicken but not that much and it wasn't missed because this is very filling. Also, I  used 12 oz of spaghetti, and i forgot the garlic but didnt need it.  No added salt.

This is a very easy recipe and it also being a one pot dish!! Fabulous! I do add when the chicken is added to pot, a chopped onion along with 1/2 cup chopped bell pepper (various colors) and 1 cup sliced mushrooms that have been sautéed in olive oil.  Happy cooking - Nana Kat!

CHANGES: WOW.... used 1 pkg cooked Spaghetti, 1 Rotisserie chicken, Cream of Mushroom WITH roasted garlic 'in it', 1 can Diced Tomatoes WITH basil  garlic & oregano 'in it', Sharp cheddar block cheese, & topped with Mozzarella cheese. Baked 375, 20 min. FABULOUS!!!!!!!!     AND because of high fat in cheese... we drank Green Tea with our meal & sliced cucumber sticks.

My family didn't care for it all that much...they have bland taste buds but I enjoyed it. It was cheesy but a bit salty; the Velveeta contributes a lot to the saltiness.

This was just okay, made according to the recipe. I found it to be a big gooey mess, and kind of dry to my taste. I will make this again,, but instead use two cans of rotel tomatoes and possibly two cans of the cream of chicken soup, to make it creamier.

Gf loved it. Next time use heavy cream and water or milk instead of Campbell's soup and probably about 1/2 pound of cheese instead of the whole brick. I would also add some bacon, cause nothing goes with cheese like bacon.

I hate chicken spaghetti but for some odd reason I was craving it tonight! I made this and loved it... I took the advice of others and added more noodles. I cooked the chicken in water seasoned with celery salt, garlic and onion powder. I reserved some of the pasta water (about one cup) to help bind the pasta and sauce together. I also added a can of mushrooms. I do recommend melting the cheese in a separate pan then adding to the pasta. It was difficult keeping the bottom from burning with all the ingredients in one pan. But overall I loved this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Sooo good! Very easy to make  I didn't boil my chicken, I cooked it in a pan and then cut it up... but besides that  I followed the recipe just the way it told me to ... I don't understand why some don't like it, if you don't like velvetta, you will NOT like this :)

Didn't have any velveeta so I used a can of campbell's cheddar cheese condensed soup and added a cup of water. It was pretty good. My husband and kids ate it, even my 3 year old. My oldest picked out the red peppers, but everyone else liked it. It was simple and quick to make!

It was amazing, the only thing I did was add enough water to get the consistency I wanted so it wasn't so thick.  No other changes.   So much flavor.

I was very pleased with this recipe. It was tasty and simple and the sauce was very creamy and not dry. I made a few changes, I used half the amount of velveeta and used half a can of tomatoes with green chili's and half a can of regular diced tomatoes, it had the perfect amount of spicey and was not overwhelming for my kids. This recipes will be a keeper.

Very tasty. I added a few extra spices to our liking, and with some garlic bread this is very filling!   I tried threw in a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup and it loosened it up a bit as well... helps out with leftovers, which there won't be very many!!

This recipe is delicious!!  I followed the recipe except for a couple of minor changes.  I doubled the spaghetti and added a cup of milk to give it moisture due to doubling.  My family loves garlic so I added some roasted garlic also.  The second time I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was just as delicious.  My family LOVED it!  I will be making this again!

I have been saving a collection of 5 star rated Allrecipes.com recipes and this one is a keeper. I used a 16 oz box of pasta with 1 lb of Velveeta and it turned out wonderful. It's interesting how such a simple recipe could be so enjoyable. We will definitely try this again.

This was great! I loved it and my family did too. I doubled the recipe and the only thing altered was a can of cream of mushroom soup added to the cream of chicken to double it. I only altered it because there was only one can or cream of chicken in my pantry. Wonderful recipe. Thank you for sharing it.

Simple, basic comfort food-- I'm sure kids would enjoy it (though maybe not the Rotel, and by the way, I drained it before adding to the cheese/cream of chicken).  I used egg noodles.  I rubbed my chicken with olive oil, paprika, and cayenne and broiled it on a cookie sheet while boiling the noodles in one pot and mixing the sauce in a saucepan.  After draining the noodles, I added them back to the big pot and mixed the sauce and chicken in, adding some extra paprika and cayenne to the pasta itself.  You can keep the pot on simmer this way and stir once in awhile.  Thanks for the recipe! EDIT 7/10/10: Made this again, boiling chicken as directed then boiling noodles in the broth.  I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles, didn't drain the Rotel, added a little milk and light sour cream, and used 1/2 a pound of Velveeta 2%.  The only seasoning I added was garlic powder.  Made this way, it's five stars for me! I loved it so much that I ate enough to become uncomfortably full, something I rarely do with any food.  It was perfectly creamy and flavorful.  I'll only make it this way now!

Just ok as-is. I found that the processed cheese was too much for the other ingredients. The sauce was kind of sticky/gummy and did not reheat well.  I've since created a version of the recipe I like more, though it makes a good bit more! I use about 5 chicken breasts, about 12 ounces of spaghetti, a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of water, 2 10 ounce cans of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (one mild,one original), a pound of processed cheese, a handful of grated sharp cheddar. I add fresh minced garlic to the simmering tomatoes and salt and pepper to the chicken as I bake it (instead of boiling).

Made this last night for supper and everyone loved it! It did seem a little dry so I added an extra can of diced tomatoes(with garlic and basil). But that was probably because I cooked extra spaghetti since I had company. This is definitely a keeper!

This was an easy to fix recipe, with common ingredients, that everyone from 7 yrs. - 70 yrs. enjoyed and asked for more.  I added a can of mushrooms and cut back on the amount of cheese.  I also used whole wheat spaghetti for health reasons.  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I give it 5 stars.

holy mackeral!  i guess this deserves more like a 2.5 rating.  it's not that tastes bad, but the cheese should probably be taken out all together.  the cheese makes it impossibly rich, and it's difficult to eat more than a little at a time.

I don't know if my expectations were too high, but my husband and I didn't really care for this recipe. I wanted to give it 2 stars, but he said 3, so our rating is really a 2.5.  It was a one-note dish. We wont be making this recipe again.

This was delicious and soooo easy.  My husband loved it and so did I.  It taste great reheated and does make a lot.  I think you should use 16 oz. spaghetti not 8 oz. as stated.  I did and it came out perfect.

I didn't have the diced tomatoes with green chili peppers, so used medium salsa. My husband and son both commented how good it was.

My kids love this.  I only use 4oz of the Velveeta, otherwise it is too rich.

Too much Velveeta. Use a recipe that uses less processed cheese and maybe a can of cream of mushroom. Also, it's best if chicken spaghetti is baked. We dubbed this meal "queso noodles."

My family and I loved this recipe.  I was craving something cheesey and gooey and it certainly fit the bill.  Very rich and yummy.  Very much a comfort food.  Love, love, loved it.

My family loved this recipe. My picky husband, who doesn't eat anything white loved it. The first time I made it I added 8 oz of sour cream and used mozerella cheese! The second time I made it I used 2  10 oz. cans of cream of chicken soup and added a 1/2 of a 10 oz. can of cream of mushroom. The mixture tasted great. It made the Spaghetti creamier. When I combined everything I put it into a baking dish and added Italian Bread crumbs with mozz. cheese on top(season to taste). The recipe was real simple and great!

I am a horrible cook :) lol..and i tried this having never made chicken spaghetti before and it was surprisingly delicious..although instead of using cream of chicken soup i only had cream of mushroom. I would suggest for those with kids to maybe half the rotel though.

My best friend brought this to our weekly get together, we really enjoyed it! I asked for the recipe before she left lol. BUT, it is essentially the nacho dip my mom made me as a kid, but with chicken and pasta instead of chips. If you can get past the fact its queso dip on spaghetti it's really good =)

This is a very simple and filling meal. This is my second time making it and once again my clan ate it and did not complain. I used left over chicken from the night before (already shredded) and a 16oz bag of pasta instead of an 8 oz. I have 2 pluses for this recipe: #1 It gives alot of leftovers #2 It freezes so very well. Which makes dinner even faster. :)

This was my first time eating Chicken Spaghetti although I've heard others say it's a quick and delicious meal. I used leftover rotisserie chicken and shredded cheese. My husband and I thought it was delicious and will be taking leftovers for lunch.

This was delicious!  It was really easy and it was nice using just one pot for dinner so there's not a lot of clean-up.  I did just eyeball the Velveeta so there wasn't too much of it in the dish but it was still definitely cheesy.  I will definitely be making this again.

Made this as written. Good recipe that was easy to throw together, but will make a few changes next time.  I found the Velveeta cheese to be too gooey and the taste of it overwhelmed the dish. Will definitely make this again, but will do half of the Velveeta and add more if necessary. I will also probably add either a larger can or two cans of the tomatoes. The 10-oz can  got lost in all the goo.

Delicious!  My fiance loved it.  A few changes I made:  1.) 13 oz spaghetti 2.) 3/4 lb cheese 3.) add a can of milk 4.) add green chilis (we like spicey!) After warming everything in the pot, I covered the spaghetti with bread crumbs and baked at 375 for 15 minutes.  Definitely will make again!

This recipe is really outstanding. My boyfriend loves spagheti but I wanted to surprise him by making something out of the ordinary and since it was the very first time I cooked for him I wanted it to be very special. I was really so happy when he found it extremely delicious that he ate it most of the day. Even the rest of my family found the recipe really good that they all kept asking for more. Thank you!

Hey sister-in-law........your recipe is getting popular!  We love this too!  The only thing that I do differently is to saute some onions and minced garlic in a little butter before melting the soup and cheese.  Also, I add in a can of cream of mushroom soup along w/ the cream of chicken.  So good!!!!

This was a very good recipe base, and then I took some advice from other reviews and sauteed onion, green peppers, and garlic. I also added diced mushrooms and a carton of sour cream. Put it all together, put it in the oven on 350 til bubbly... delicious!! Next time I will add some milk to juicen it up a bit.

This is a great dinner and very similar to a spicy macaroni and cheese served at Applebees.  With a few modifications, this recipe is part of our regular rotation now.  Instead of spaghetti, we've found rotini seems to work out the best and we've also switched to a mild rotel so its not so spicy for the kids.  Also when we were heating up leftovers the last time we served it we added about a cup of milk to the pot and it turned out so creamy and yummy that we're going to start adding it from the get go.

This seems to be a pretty classic recipe for chicken spaghetti. I would point out that the amount of spaghetti indicated may be a typo, given the amounts of the the other ingredents. I would definitely use 16 ounces of uncooked spaghetti in this recipe. I made this recipe this evening for a crowd. I doubled all of the ingredients and used 32 ounces of uncooked spagetti, and the sauce was more than enough but yet not soupy - just right!

Very good recipe and very easy to make. I also used a little bit more spaghetti and about 1/4 less cheese and it seemed to be a good consistency. Next time I might try the hot rotel, just to add a little more spiciness to it. But overall as is a very good recipe. Makes a lot!

I'm sure others may love this, but it just wasn't our style.  If you like "cream soup" dishes, give it a try.

I used this in a restaurant buffet setting.  I must say, it was the hit of the menu.  I added creme of mushroom soup also and roasted bell pepper and roasted celery for color contrast.  It was gone as soon as it hit the bar.

will make this one again.

Way to thick. The sauce needs to be more runny. It was too cheesy for my family. They didnt like it at all.

A friend gave me this recipe to try for my VERY picky children.  They LOVED it!  I did add a few Tablespoons of milk to make it more creamy, but that's the only difference.  They were telling everybody about mom's chicken spaghetti!

Me and my sister loved this recipe. The kids loved it so we're making it again tonight. The only thing we're doing is adding a bag of frozen vegetables, because for us this is the easiest way to add veggies to our diet. Yum.

This recipe was so simple.  I have a similar recipe from a local restaurant.  It also calls for green peppers, onions and mushrooms.  They do add color and texture.  However, if you're in a hurry this is great - just add a salad and your done!

I loved this recipe! My husband and 19 month old daughter did too. I thought the diced tomatoes with chillies would be too spicy for my daughter but they weren't. I will make this one again soon!

We didn't care for this recipe at all.  :(  I had high hopes for it with all the rave reviews.  We make simple cheese dip with Velvetta and Rotel, but we'd rather of made that and poured it on top.  However, we won't do that either, because the sauce with the spaghetti simply wasn't tasty.  We'll stick with good old fashion spaghetti.  Thanks anyways!

I enjoyed this dish.  It was a little spicier than I had expected but I like spicy.  I would imagine you could sub a can of chopped tomatoes for the tomatoes and chili’s if you want a calmer dish to serve to kids.

Not very pretty but excellent flavor!  I used half the cheese and added the pasta once the cheese was melted.  Very picky husbad was skeptical, but loved it. It was even better the next day.  The rotel gives it a nice kick. Not a healthy dish but good once in a while. Thanks!

I never heard of chicken spaghetti till I moved to Texas. I have tried some variations of this recipe. If you like more of a kick you can use the hotter Rotel, or try it with velveeta pepperjack or Mexican style cheese instead. Very easy to prepare and it tastes great!

This recipe was awesome! Not to bad POINTS wise for someone on Weight Watchers. Although, next time I will cut the cheese amount in half and double the noodles. This was great! Will be making again soon.

Very good recipe! It was very quick and easy! I took some advice from some of the reviews and I didn't put in the whole pound of cheese. I only used about 3/4 of the block. I made the sauce in a seperate pot and then added the noodles to the sauce. My family really enjoyed this recipe! Thank you! I will make this again!

I like this recipe for several reasons: 1) It features ingredients that are commonly on hand, 2) It comes together quickly, 3) For the effort expended, the flavor is surprisingly good.  A couple of notes: 1) I used whole wheat pasta for a healthier spin, 13 1/2 ounces, 2) Since I increased the pasta, I did not decrease the Velveeta as some recommended, and the consistency was perfect. All ingredients were covered throughly, but the consistency wasn't mushy. For quick, family fare, with a comfort food written all over it, this recipe is a winner.

I came to the sight specifically looking for a chicken spaghetti recipe. I was so glad to find this one right at the top.  Made it for dinner tonight & it was great!  I did cut back on the amount of velveeta in the dish also.  Will definitely make this one again.  Thanks for sharing.

I scaled the Velvetta WAY back, but these are the ingredients I like in Chicken Spaghetti.  I will also put it in a casserole and brown it off in the oven for about 20 minutes at 350.

This is wonderful!!! I just cooked my chicken with some garlic and parsley and added that to the casserole. I also used cream of mushroom as some others had suggested and thought it was really good. I was worried about the tomatoes but they made this recipe different and delicious. It was even better the next day.

Wow!  I gave this four stars because I changed a couple of things.  I used about 1/3 lb velveeta and used italian diced tomatoes. But oh boy was it good!  I actually ate it on toast before I put the chicken in it.  That was great too!  I will make this again and again.

This is a surprisingly good recipe! Super quick to throw together. I wish I would've paid more attention to the other reviews - you DEFINITELY DO NOT need 1 whole pound of Velveeta....it came out pretty cheesy. I will definitely make again, but use only 1/2 pound of the Velveeta. It would be good with other veggies added as well.

I loved everything except the velveeta cheese. Its a tad bit overwhelming in my opinion. The diced tomatoes with chili peppers where excellent! I would have never thought it. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I will for sure make this again (minus the cheese)...

Awesome! Great recipe! Even my 7 year old son loves it and that's saying a lot! I would give it 10 stars if possible. I use 7 boiled chicken tenderloins (shredded), 1 pd cheese, 1 can tomatoes with green chiles, 1/2 can cream of chicken, 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup, and a little over 8 oz. spaghetti noodles. So I did change the recipe a little, but mainly just amounts not ingredients. (Just wanted to clarify because I hate it when someone gives a recipe 5 stars when they have changed just about the whole recipe!) Thanks!

Great dish! If you remember the measurments are: 1 pound of pasta to 1 pound of processed cheese with 1 can rotel and 1 can cream of mushroom soup then you can't go wrong. If you want to double the recipe then use 2 of everything. Its not rocket science! I also use a whole chicken and boil it until the meat is falling off the bone, then I drain the chicken but save the broth and use that broth water to cook the pasta in. It gives the pasta alot of flavor. You may need to add some water to the broth so you will have enough to cook the pasta in. I NEVER use bouillon cubes it makes it way too salty. Also canned broth makes it salty also. Shred the boiled chicken meat and add it to the pasta and Voila!! It's a great recipe!

This was so good.  I cooked 16oz of spaghetti to 1/2 pound of processed chesse and it was just right.  I was very filling and I could not stop eating it!

Everyone else's review states that this dish was too cheesy but for me it was entirely TOO SALTY! I broiled the chicken and noodles with chicken flavored buillon cubes.....maybe that's where I went wrong. I will be trying this recipe again simply because it was so darn easy!

This was a good recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I cooked the chicken breast in a skillet on top of the stove with olive oil.  It was cheesy as others haved said, but I figured that out by looking at the photo that was listed with recipe.....
We loved it!!!!!  Thanks

Excellent & Easy!  I doubled the recipe & added an extra can of plain diced tomatoes (total of 1 can Rotel & 2 cans plain diced), one can cream of chicken, one can cream of mushroom and 1 can of mushrooms. I only used 3/4 lb of Velveeta and 4 large chicken breasts and it was perfect.

I didn't care for this.  I took the suggestion of others and used half the cheese and it was still really cheesy.  I just didn't find it to have much flavor.  It seemed like it was just spaghetti noodles with melted cheese.  I gave it 3 stars b/c it wasn't *terrible*, I ate it, but I won't be making this again.

This was to much cheese, so the next time I cook it I will cut the cheese in half or use a whole box of spaghetti, I think it would be good also with some sliced black olives

I was very pleased from this.  I did take the advie of using half a block of cheese instead of a whole block.  It was more than enough cheese.

This is almost exactly the way I make my chicken spaghetti as well. However I use a whole pound of spaghetti(or linguine) and I cook my cheese, soup and tomatoes together in a separate pot.  That way I can refrigerate or freeze the leftover sauce.
