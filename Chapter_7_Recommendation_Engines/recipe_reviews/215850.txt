Great recipe! The only change I would make is to saute the onion and garlic in with the sausage as it is being cooked.

I really like this dish. I like the twist on classic ziti with the sausage and it's a real crowd pleaser, my family likes it!

so so, I wasn't crazy about the texture with the ricotta, sort of soupy more than cheezy

I served this last night and my husband is a picky eater he devoured his portion and asked for more :) I did make a few changes using all of the recipe ingredients I added garlic powder, onion powder and added crushed pepper for a added kick...thanks for sharing!

Flavorless with waaaay too much onion. The consistency was much too soupy for my taste, as I like a thick baked ziti that doesn't fall apart. 

If I were to make this again, I would add a lot more seasoning like italian seasoning, salt, especially sugar because it came out much more sour than I expected. I would use about 1/3 of an onion and cook the garlic and onion with the sausage. .

This is a delicious, reliable, and versatile dish that I've turned to again and again. Use the best possible ricotta you can find... it really makes a difference. Also, I remove the casings from the sausage and crumble the meat before I heat it.

Great recipe! Made some changes only in technique and type of ingredients. We used hot Italian sausage instead of mild and low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Sauteed the onion until it was soft before adding the sausage. Added the garlic in the last five minutes so as to not burn it. Then added the tomato and basil sauce. We raise our own tomatoes so we used own own tomato and bail that we put up each year. Everything else was as written in the recipe. We will be making this again and again!

Suprised at how good this was.  I tweaked it a little, when don't I.  Only because I didn't have the exact measurements, slightly less pasta and sauce added a little water, extra ricotta. I just slapped it on top.  I had no Mozzerella so I used what Farmer's cheese I had left from the Farmer's market.  I've found this to be a good substitute for Mozzerella. And sprinkled with romano. I have no idea how long I cooked it since I forgot yto set a timer! lol

This is my favorite! I add a 1/2 to 3/4 ground hamburg as well as the sausage and I also up the cheese as we like cheese =) Even my son devours this and he is the pickiest eater I know....have made this  many times.

This is delicious!  I've had several requests for the recipe after taking it to a potluck.  I did find that I had to use a larger than 9 x 13 pan, as the Ziti all didn't fit in that.  I used a deep stoneware container the next time I made it.

easy recipe came out tasty. I used chicken instead of sausage. next time I will run the ricotta mixture through the food processor so the onions are not so pungent, and I would use a higher quality sauce that has a more tomatoey taste.
