Do yourself a favor and use an immersion blender (in a safe container) after you add the milk. It will make it super smooth before you add the cheese. Also when adding the cheese, GO SLOWLY do a handful at a time and stir until that handful is gone, then do the next. Recipes amounts are perfect, although I had to use half & half instead of whole milk and did 4 oz Monterrey Jack and 4 oz sharp cheddar. That's another thing: grate your cheese yourself. Pre-shredded cheese is coated in a mixture that inhibits clumping which can make it harder to incorporate. Hope this helps!

This is a great queso! I am anti processed cheese "foods" so this is perfect. I make a batch then keep it in a small crock pot to stay warm. I added a 1/2 can of green chiles for flavor and color.

The flavor was okay, and it was a lot closer to the queso that I love than other recipes I've tried, but this was basically just cheese flavored gravy.

Loved this but changed a few things.  I used half white cheddar cheese and half Monterey Jack .  I added a can of medium green chiles and a sprinkle of cumin .  Very, very good!

Followed the directions exactly. Very bland and too thick for me. The sauce also had a weird texture. I put it on top of chicken and baked it and it was okay but no one liked the cheese by itself.

This was great! I loved that it was real cheese and not the fake cheese! The only thing I added was a can of green chilis to give it a little spice.

I really liked it but, I wanted it a bit thinner, Just add some more milk if you like it thin
