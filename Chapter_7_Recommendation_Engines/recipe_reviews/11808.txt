This is the second time I've made this recipe.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was way too oily, way too salty, and didn't have NEARLY enough basil flavor...and don't even get me started on the almost 45 grams of fat per serving!! 
So this time, I omitted all of the butter, used regular half and half instead of heavy cream, cut the parmesan to 1/2 cup, upped the pesto to 2/3 cup, and added about 2 tablespoons of dried basil (I would have loved to use fresh basil, but didn't have any :( - if using fresh, you should use 1/3 cup).  This brought the fat down to a mere 13 grams of fat per serving.  That's something I can handle!!  Others had mentioned the sauce being too thing when using half and half, but mine was REALLY thick!  The key may be to simmer it a bit longer on medium-low heat.  Still needs more basil in my opinion, but I think using fresh as opposed to dried would do the trick!!

AWESOME!  This is a keeper.  I also used half and half to reduce the fat content.  I grated fresh parmesan as well.  It makes a big difference.  One thing I will point out is to be careful when adding the parmesan.  On my first try, my cream was too hot and it curdled.  The second try, I took it off the stove and added the cheese slowly - stirring constantly.  I also sauteed some mushrooms in fresh garlic and added them to the sauce along with two scallions and a diced tomato.  I used frozen cooked shrimp with tail off.  I defrosted them in the microwave and added them to the sauce.  Cooked until warm and served over fettucine.  It was delicious.  My neighbors were over and were VERY impressed.  Easy and elegant.  A new family favorite.  Thank you.

Awwwww, this is a real heart warmer but try this twist... I've been living in Italy for the last 20 years and in a fantastic restaurant in Milan a superb version of this treat is made.... instead of drowning the poor linguine in heavy cream, use two good dollops of mascarpone.  There's less fat in the end, the linguini don't have to swim and there's no real need for butter.  As a perfectionist, I cook the shrimp (scampi are even better) aside in a little olive oil, 2 whole cloves of garlic and a fourth cup of dry white wine for those 2 or 3 minutes necessary to make them succulent... then toss them into the mascarpone and linguini.  Hey folks, the pasta must not be soupy!  I just love this plate, you will too.

FABULOUS TASTE!! A minute before adding the parmesean cheese, I also added 1/2 cup of chopped red peppers, 1/2 cup chopped green peppers, 2 chopped green onions and 1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms!  You can't get any better than that! Adds a more colorful presentation and at least you feel like your eating a little bit healthier (considering there is a 1/2 cup of butter and all that cream)!  Just the same, it's restraunt quality and will make over and over! Thank you for the GREAT receipe!!!!!

Want a lighter, more colorful version?

- Use 2 cups half-and-half
- Use 1/3 cup parmesan
- Prep a diced green pepper or red pepper, or any fave veggies (aparagus, broccoli, mushrooms) ahead of time

Throw the veggies in about three minutes before you add the parmesan (later than that, if you have already-tender veggies).

Let it cook.  If the sauce is thinnish, get a drinking glass, add 1/2 cup water and a tablespoon of corn starch (no fat!), stir, and stir into the dish once the mixture is dissolved.

OH MY GOSH I can NOT say enough about this recipe!! It was AWESOME and soo easy! This is my 1st rating and I couldnt resist rating this one...I did do a few things different - nothing drastic though....I added about 4 cloves of minces garlic to butter, used 1 c heavy cream and 1 c skim milk (for calories purposes), since I used only half of the alloted hesvy cream, I added a little corn starch to thicken just a bit though (about tbsp). I also used already cooked shrimp - the KEY to using these is to run them under water first to defrost them...THEN add then to sauce (wont make the sauce so thin) I put the whole thing over wheat pasta soo good! Hope these tips help others!

I cheat, and actually use a packaged creamy pesto sauce mix (Knorr...), but a TERRIFIC addition to this recipe is a can of diced Italian tomatoes.  Just stir them in with the shrimp, and it combines with the pesto to make a beautiful sauce.  Add some parmesan, and you've got a gourmet meal!

This was absolutely wonderful!!!!  My family gobbled it all up, 2nds and 3rds for everyone.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves shrimp and wants something really easy to make.
mmmm good!  By the way:  I changed absolutely NOTHING.  If I did- I'd be rating my own recipe, right?  (pet peave I guess)

This is definately the best alfredo sauce recipe.  I added sauteed garlic and scallops to the sauce, very good!  I made this twice, and I think the secret is to let the cream and butter mixture boil in a large pan so it gets good and thick.  Excellent!

This is a great recipe. I doubled the amount of linguini and used a pound of imitation crab and one pound of shrimp. Most delicious.

This was a great recipe after I changed it up a bit. I followed and combined the advice of other reviews.

To cut down on the very high fat content, I cut out the butter and did 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of half-and-half. The sauce was nice and thick with this combo. 
I also used 1/2 cup or so of Parmesan and 2/3 cup of a good brand of Pesto. 

I also sauteed a carton of sliced mushrooms and an 1/3 cup of chopped onion in 2 teaspoons of jarred, minced garlic and some oil and then added it into the sauce. I added onion powder, garlic powder, a little salt, and some pepper to the sauce.

At the end, I added a diced large tomato and some fresh basil (about 3 tablespoons, chopped) and chopped up the shrimp too.

This was great paired with steamed asparagus, broccoli and cauliflower.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made a few changes to cut some fat: used a Tbsp of olive oil instead of butter and used half and half instead of heavy cream. Even with these changes it was absolutely delicious.

This recipe was outstanding!!! Very easy, very quick and extremely tasty!! I didn't have to make too many changes at all. I followed "Weelassie's" advice and added fresh garlic and green onions. I also added my cheese slowly. I didn't take it off the heat, I just lowered the temp while adding it, constantly stirring. I also used an extremely tasty sun-dried tomato pesto by Classico. Oh yeah, I did marinate the shrimp for a couple of hours with a little basalmic vinegar and a few seasonings. Go with what YOU know for the marinade if you decide to marinate at all. Served with "Baked Tomatoes Oregano" from this website and a nice Italian bread, which you may want to dip in the creamy sauce (I put extra sauce on my plate just for this reason). It may seem like a lot but once you cut up your garlic and green onions, the whole process takes 20 min. Excellent recipe Loretta and thanks for the help Weelassie!! BAYOU GATOR OOOUUUTTT!!

I have noticed with this recipe that everyone seemed to change it. The added this or did that, then rated it at 5 stars. While it is a good recipe it lacks flavor which is a common compliant with most reviewers.  It is also kinda oily so I suggest cutting the butter and simmering longer. Even then it was oily. Overall it was ok I found another recipe called Pesto cream sauce which has all the ingredients already added by other reviewers from this recipe. It has the onions, garlic and spices and it a fab 5 star recipe

Ok..the recipe as stated is a fat greasy, oily mess but a great starting point. This is the way I made it: I started off cooking small container of Portabella mushrooms and garlic sauteed in Virgin Coconut oil (I replace this instead of butter in most recipes) or use olive oil. Put in same skillet and 2 TBS of Organic Butter and substituted half and half instead of cream. Let simmer for 10-12 min and I added 2 tsp of corn starch. (mixed corn starch with 3 TBS of cold water) Then I added the cooked mushrooms and simmered on med-low for 7-10 more min. Then I added 1/2 cup of homemade pesto I had in freezer which is super good by its self!  I recommended Costco brand pesto if you don"t want to make homemade, which can be frozen as well. I added a less than 1/2c of parm (could of used less)  and cooked for 5 more min. I then added all the shrimp when the last 3 min left on whole wheat pasta (as good as regular pasta) Once shrimp turn pink (don"t over cook) removed from heat. Ladled mixture over hot pasta and top with 2TBS of parm. WOW! Best pesto sauce I ever had,. Blows away any restaurant pesto I have had! Will try fat free half and half next time? Hope this helps.

This recipe is fabulous and is a great base for adding other things just to jazz it up.  When cooking, I don't really measure anything...but this recipe is great with about 1/2 an onion, a handful of sliced mushrooms, and 2 tablespoons of garlic (all sauteed first). I added about 1 cup of ricotta with the parmesan, cut the 1/2 & 1/2 to 1.5 cups instead of two, used more pesto and threw in some diced tomatoes also.  It came out REALLY good!  You may want to try some Tony's seasoning also...not sure if it's available in every state, but Tony's is a Louisiana seasoning that is great on just about everything...pretty sure you can order it online also.

Have a very similar recipe, but I melt the butter, add a couple of cloves of minced garlic and about 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg.  Cook for a couple of minutes until the garlic is fragrant, and then add the cream and continue with the recipe.  The garlic and nutmeg bring out all the flavours and blend deliciously!

THIS IS NOT THAT GOOD.  It is totally not worth how unhealthy it is. Yes, cream, butter, shrimp, pesto, pasta, and cheese are tasty. But this came out tasting like cream, butter, shrimp, pasta, and cheese with a hint of pesto. To me, a recipe that includes ingredients like that should add up to more than the sum of its parts, not add up to me being kind of grossed out with myself for eating it.  Also, the consistency of the sauce was not good. I think part of the problem is that there is too much butter. I would guess (and won't find out since I won't make this again) that about half the butter would serve just fine if you have to try it.

I just loved this.  Strange to say I know but this is the first time that I have eaten pesto.  I was afraid that the garlic would just over power the dish but it was delicious.  Thank you so much for posting.  I will definitely make this again

This recipe was great as a base. I added to it - 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 green bell pepper, one extra large fresh mushroom, a dash of cayenne pepper and some crumbled feta cheese. It was amazing!

Excellent dish. I also added sauteed scallops with shrimp and cut back on the heavy cream to 1 cup, and add 1.5 cup milk and 2 tbsp cornstarch.

Very good.  This was quick and easy and the taste eas excellent.  The only thing I added was a little crushed garlic to the butter and a small pinch of red pepper flakes.  This one is a keeper.

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN (I'M ON A MISSION TO GIVE MEDIOCRE REVIEWS A SECOND CHANCE) AND WOW! I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH MY SAUCE THICKENING AND FOUND THIS TO BE MILD, BUT NOT AT ALL BLAND. I DIDN'T ALTER ANYTHING AND AM GLAD I DIDN'T. I GUESS MY TASTE BUDS ARE MATURING AS I AGE LOL. :) I did not care for this at all. :( My bf did like this, but I do not think he'll ever request it again. Prep couldn't be easier, and that alone makes this deserving of all five stars, but my rating is solely based on taste (flavor is VERY important to me). I found the sauce to be EXTREMELY bland, even with the addition of red pepper flakes, fresh minced garlic, chopped green onions, fresh basil and a full 1/3 c. pesto (I 1/2'd the recipe, but added enough pesto for 8 servings as directed). I had no problem thickening my sauce and actually had to add a couple T of milk to thin it out a bit! Perhaps adding mushrooms, peppers and / or fresh or sun-dried tomatoes would take this dish over the top??? These suggestions didn't appeal to me (and I didn't have any of them on hand), so I didn't bother. Basil & garlic linguine, baked tomatoes oregano (Michelle O'Sullivan) and garlic bread rounded out our meal. Too bad I didn't care for the sauce - it would have been a real treat to dip my bread in it! All in all, this was OK but definitely not worth the extra calories. Thanks anyways! :-)

Yummy! I added steamed asparagus broken into about 1 1/2 inch pieces. The green added a lot to the presentation. I don't think I would have liked how it looked without it. But the sauce was awesome!I cooked the asparagus and shrimp ahead of time so it was super quick after everyone got home. I served it with a green salad and crusty  bread. Very good!

This was a great recipe.  I did saute some mushrooms, onions & garlic to the sauce.  My cream did curdle a bit because I forgot to remove it from the heat when I added the parmesan. After it was done I threw in some tomatoes that were getting a little over ripe in my fridge.  It was a nice addition with the pesto cream sauce.

I took the advice of other readers and omitted the butter completely. We used half and half instead and made sure to let it simmer longer. We also added some garlic and red pepper flakes. This was a hit and we will be making this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe although we did not follow the directions to a "t".

I made this last night for Valentine's Day dinner.  It was really terrific, but I was shocked at how oily it was.  Between the butter, the oil in the pesto, and the oil in the cheese it was just puddled with oil.  Next time I will definitely make this without the butter.  Otherwise, it was great!

Our favorite! We make this probably twice a month. If I don't make it in a while, I hear "honey......can't we have that pesto shrimp thing this week? pleaaaaase?" honestly, its so good.   I usually put extra pesto in, and I always use salted butter. Last time I used unsalted butter and the flavor just was not there. So, at least throw a pinch of salt in if you use the unsalted butter!  Our fav!

Great base recipe, but I changed it a little. I put in only 2/3 of the butter in, and used fat free half and half instead of the cream. I added sun dried tomatoes which gave it SUCH a great flavor, and added diced mushrooms and peas. I tried this all with angel hair, but will use something with a bit more size to it next time.

OMG!! This is so good it should be illegal! I did do a few things differently. 1. I melted the butter (1/3 cup) with the garlic, added 1/4 cup of white wine and cooked for 5 minutes, then added 1 1/2 cups of half and half. 2. I added 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes. 3. I used 1 cup of pesto (I had homemade leftovers that I wanted to use up). 4. I only used 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese. 5. I added one can of crab meat, just before adding 1 lbs of shrimp. Cooked for 5 minutes.  The results were fabulous!! By using the tomatoes, I was able to still get a very creamy sauce, with less fat and calories, without compromising on taste. This is absolutely restaurant quality.

Excellent!  Like many of the other reviewers, I used 2 c. half-n-half, 1/2 c. parmesan, increased the pesto to 2/3 c., and 1 red bell pepper.  I also cut the butter back a bit to 1/3 c.  and tossed 3 heads of steamed broccoli into the finished pasta, shrimp, and sauce.  Great recipe!

I scaled the recipe to 4 servings.  I often substitute sliced, grilled chicken (seasoned with dried basil and rosemary & grilled on the George Foreman grill) for the shrimp, add sliced roma tomatoes and fresh basil at the last minute, and serve the sauce over penne pasta.  My fiance loves it this way.

I just made this dish.... and its DELICIOUS!!!  Im going to upload the picture I took of my masterpiece!! I also did not use heavy cream, instead I used half and half; and did not use one cup of cheese, I used 3/4...at the end I had to add a bit of milk because it was a bit to thick, I dont know if I cook it for too long or if the cheese made it thick... ENJOY IT!!

Used half and half instead of heavy cream with the pesto which stayed in a pot while I then sauteed garlic and onions. Once onions were almost done, I threw in asparagus and mushrooms. Then 1.5lbs shrimp and .75lbs crab meat. DELICIOUS!!!   I don't cook, at all, and not only did my 12 year old nephew say I cook better than my culinary exquisite sister, but my bf no long believes I can't cook!

This was outstanding!!! My favorite thing to cook and eat is pasta, specifically with seafood, and this has topped my list! I made a half portion for just my boyfriend and I and followed the recipe exactly except for using half&half instead of heavy cream. I also sauteed 2 cloves of garlic, 1 shallot, and about a cup of sliced mushrooms which I added before the cheese along with about 1/4 cup of canned Italian-style diced tomatoes. At first I was worried about the sauce being too thin, but once the cheese and pesto was blended in, it really thickened up quickly. My boyfriend and I both thought this was my best pasta dish yet! A must have!

10 stars...if I closed my eyes I would have thought I was at an Italian Restaurant.  This is restaurant quality.  Easy to make and would SO impress dinner guests.  I used 1/4 c butter, added tsp garlic, used 3/4 package of spaghetti noodles because that was what I had on hand and I wanted a lot of sauce, used frozen, uncooked shrimp...thawed and drained.  My one son had thirds.  This was perfection.  Thanks - this goes into my repertoire of recipes.

WOW!  We all loved it.  I used 1 T flour and 1 T butter melted together and then added 2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2 since I didn't have cream on hand.  Saved a few caloried, but the taste was awesome.  My 5 yr old declared this a Keeper!

This recipe was very good but it seemed to be missing something so I made a few changes. I added about 1 cup of fresh mushrooms, 3 scallions chopped, about 1/4 cup of chopped roasted red pepper. It added the color and flavor and made it wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe

This is an excellent dish. It is pretty fatty considering the the amount of heavy cream but soooooo good. I've made it a few times and it never gets old. Sometime I use less heavy cream and butter though.

Homemade pesto sauce with this one using basil from the garden. This is super good. Cut the butter to 1/3 cup and also used 1 3/4 cup of half and half rather than heavy cream. Still amazing.

WARNING: This recipe can be a disaster if you follow the instructions as written. Take the time to read over several of the reviews before you start cooking and note the changes people have made to get this recipe to work, especially:

- reduce the heat so the sauce doesn't break into curds and liquid butter
- cook the shrimp separately so they don't overcook. Nothing like tough shrimp to take a dish from a hit to a miss

Great recipe - next time will try with some the changes others propose - might also use chicken tenderloins instead of the shrimp - will definitely make again

I too used half and half instead of cream. I sauteed onions and mushrooms in about 2 Tb butter, then added the half and half, then the cheese. I used about 6 ounces of pesto, and both cooked shrimp and crab meat. The final product was quite good, still maybe a bit oily for me. I also didn't use the whole pound of linguine, so there was a lot of sauce to noodle - that's my fault! I served it with chopped red bell pepper on top, and would next time add some crushed red pepper flakes. Overall it was a real hit, though, as both boyfriend and 5-yr-old daughter enjoyed it. Hoping the leftovers will be equally delicious.

This is a really wonderful recipe. I used the suggestion of other reviewers to cut the butter way back. Actually, I ended up using approx. 2 TB of butter to saute mushrooms, but that was all. After upping the amount of pesto (yum!) and adding a splash of sherry, the result was fantastic. One note, the yield is actually more like 12 servings, not eight. I made this for company, and even after seconds, there was enough for leftovers.

I halfed the recipe and the sauce came out very thick. I also used imitation crab instead of shrimp, which was tasty. I also used crumbled parmesan instead of shredded, so it stuck together. Next time, I will lessen the fat content and use half and half instead.  I will also use shredded parmesan too. It smells delicious and my roommate could smell it outside the house!

I followed suggestions and did this: 1/4 cup fake butter, 1 cup fat free half and half, 1 cup half and half, and the rest is the same. I also made my own pesto sauce.  Honestly, there was something really lacking.  If you want a mmm mmm good outcome to this, I suggest using real butter at least.  It was good- anything with pesto is!- but just not grrreat.

The first two times I made this recipe, I followed it exactly as written. I thought it was awesome.  The ladies present did not enjoy watching the fattening ingredients being poured in and one complained that it was too rich.  The next two times that I've made it, I substituted half and half for the cream and margin for the butter.  It still tasted great and it was hardly a noticeable difference, though not as rich as before.  I've read reviewers complaining that using the half and half makes the sauce not thick enough -- but I found that it can be just as thick if you simply simmer it longer than the directions state. Great recipe, I'd recommend these substitutions to lower the fat.

good the first time,better the second.  I had trouble with my sauce separating, I think the cream was too hot when I added the cheese and pesto.  The next time I cooked the pasta and asparagus together, drained the water and added the already cooked thawed shrimp and pesto to the pot and returned stove top to reheat.  Sprinkled with parmesan just before serving.  All agreed this was much tastier ( and easier).

This was a great, quick and easy romantic meal for a weekday Valentine's. Even on Valentine's though, I had to cut down on the fat and add some nutritional value. I cut the butter in half, used fat-free half and half, used a little more than half the parmesan, and a little extra pesto. I also added in a handful of fresh chopped basil with the pesto and threw in some chopped asparagus with the shrimp. Just before serving I stirred in a handful of baby spinach and let it cook just long enough to wilt. This was absolutely delicious, but not quite as fattening (though still not exactly a heart-healthy meal).

I started the recipe without thinking about changing it much aside from reducing the amount of butter. Then I realized I didn't have as much cream as I thought I had. I replaced it with a little amount of mascarpone. And it was really tasty! This is a really good recipe, easy, fast and delicious. Thank you for publishing.

To die for!  My family rated it "Restaurant Quality".  I used evaporated milk for the cream (because that's what I had) but otherwise followed exactly.  A new family favorite.  Thanks.

GREAT SAUCE! Creamy and rich! Added scallops and pieces of halibut and some brown mushrooms which I sauteeded with garlic first. Very tasty and flavourful! My hubby and 4 year old son are not the biggest pasta fans and they just gobbled it up!

As is it's waaaay too fatty but cut down on the all the cream/butter/cheese and it's still really good. I made a basic bashamel then added a lot less cheese and the pesto. Really good stuff.

OH! Yum! Yum!  A wonderful neighbor brought over some homemade pesto today so I tried this recipe and my family loved it!  I used Parmesan/Romano cheese and topped the dish with a spice I got at a local spice store, Penzeys Spices.  The spice called "Black and Red" is a combination of Tellicherry black pepper and Cayenne red pepper.  It gave the dish a nice kick.  If you are interested the spice can be found at www.penzeys.com.

Great starter receipe.  Save yourself time and buy a 15 oz jar Garlic alfredo Sauce ( I used Newmans) and add to it  1/3 cup of Pest  and there is your sauce!  I took another reviewers suggestion and sauted 1lb pound of asparagus, and a pack of fresh sliced mushrooms in some garlic and butter and when just about done added a can of petite diced tomatoes.  Served over 160z box of penne pasta - yum   Thanks

Excellent dish!  I followed the recipe to the letter except I used 3/4 cup of basil pesto, as I like a heavier pesto flavor. For the fullest flavor, use butter and heavy cream. Yes, the fat content is somewhat high. However, unless you gorge yourself on fat and cholesterol daily, some butter and cream as an occasional treat will do you no harm. Allow yourself to indulge now and then. Julia Child would spin in her grave at the thought of cutting out the butter and using watered down cream. Bon appetit!  :-)

I mainly just used the recipe for the sauce and wow was it phenomenal.  It turned out somewhat salty, and I'm not sure if that was from the cheese or pesto, but could have been prevented with more milk.  Also think it comes out just fine with a 2% milk rather than heavy cream.

This was very good and super easy! My husband isn't a shrimp fan so I used chicken. I'm eager to make it with shrimp, though because I LOVE shrimp! I was a little worried that my sauce wouldn't thicken but as soon as I added the cheese it thickened up right away. I used 1 1/2 cups of cheese (aka the whole bag) instead of 1 cup because, in my opinion, you can never have too much cheese! I also added garlic powder, black pepper and salt to the sauce. I followed the advice from other reviews and used half and half. I think next time I'll cut back on the butter as well. I sauteed the chicken with some EVOO, onions, fresh garlic and black pepper. I set that aside while I made the sauce and boiled the water for the pasta. Once everything was ready I mixed it all together in one big pot! A delicious meal, for sure!

WAY TOO OILY!  But, great flavor and definitely worth keeping and playing with!  Next time I’ll leave out the butter completely, though!  The pesto I use, made by Classico, contains oil, as well.  On the advice of other reviewers, I halved the recipe as there are only 2 ½ (17 month old!) of us eating.  I then halved the parmesan, doubled the pesto and added 1 T dried basil!  Otherwise, this was fabulous and even my 17 month old enjoyed it!

I receive allrecipes daily dish and this Creamy Pesto Shrimp dish was the highlight of the day so I decided to make it since I had all the ingredients on hand. Additionally over 500 members reviewed this dish  with very high ratings. Gezzzz guy's I am not with you on this one... This sauce is big on calories and little on flavor. I like a creamy pesto sauce as a departure from pure pesto which can be achieved by just adding about 1/4 a cup of heavy cream or half and half to a homemade pesto with garlic, sea salt and freshly grated parmesan cheese. You will save tons of calories and you will get the creamy taste this recipe offers. Sometimes less really is more... less cream more pure pesto taste. I do appreciate how versatile this recipe is with the shrimp, chicken, salmon or just the pesto sauce and pasta. With my modifications I would give it four stars. But as is well... you see my results!!

Fantastic ! ! ! Easy ! ! !  Now look, folks, it's got a stick of butter and 2 cups of whipping cream - it can't help but be good.  And to all of you that said it was too rich and too much fat, what did you expect - it's got a stick of butter and 2 cups of whipping cream.  Duh ! ! ! I followed the directions exactly and it was superb. My husband said this was a "keeper".

Soooooooo good! Flavor was great! I followed some other reviewers' changes and cut the butter to 5 tbsps, used half and half instead of the heavy creamer, and added a couple cloves of minced garlic. I actually hate shrimp but was looking for a creamy pesto sauce. So, I added Italian sausage and some broccoli instead. Thickness was just right. Fantastic!!!

REALLY GOOD RECIPE!!! Like every other ALLRECIPES fan I read several reviews and settled on the following changes: Subbed half & half for the heavy cream, added 2 cloves fresh crushed garlic and 1 tbsp red pepper flakes to the butter / cream mixture. Then 8 oz fresh sliced mushrooms ..... THEN pulled it from the heat and added the freshly grated Parmesan cheese to avoid curdling. Then the home made pesto and shrimp was added. Topped with a few chopped scallions and more cheese. Next time I will do it EXACTLY the same way but will add a few sliced artichoke hearts.

This was a bit of a treat, considering it's a big bowl of butter, cream, and cheese.  Very deliciously indulgent.  I added some mushrooms to the butter and bit of flour before adding the cream to thicken the sauce a bit. Next time I think I will cook the shrimp separately and then add to the sauce last to ensure they don't get overcooked buried in the dense sauce.

This was such a good dinner! It's fancy enough for dinner guests and easy enough for a weeknight meal. I made a few changes to the recipe and used the following ingredients: 1lb linguine, 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup half-and-half, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese, 7oz jar pesto sauce, 1 cup fresh mushrooms, 1 cup thinly sliced red peppers, 1.5lb bag frozen uncooked shrimp. I sauteed the peppers and mushrooms in a separate pan in a little margarine and set them aside, and then cooked the shrimp in the same pan for about 3 minutes with garlic powder and salt (do not overcook!). While I cooked the pasta I prepared the sauce and, once thickened (I used a little Wondra flour), added the cooked peppers, mushrooms, and shrimp. I then tossed the pasta in the sauce to absorb the flavor a few minutes on low heat. Once plated I topped it with little extra Parmesan cheese and served with hot garlic bread. My husband loved it!

simply great! I was actually running very behind at work and my dear Hubby actually made this for dinner! Believe me if he can make this anyone can. He said it was really easy and the only thing he changes is by using white pepper instead of black pepper.

This is delicous and easy to make :)  Sometimes i saute freshly minced garlic for a few minutes in the butter before adding the cream.  Not necessary unless you're a garlic fan like me though.  Outstanding as is!

This is a great recipe! I've used it twice in the past week once with f/f half and half and shrimp and then with regular half and half and faux lobster and a can of white crab. Both times worked out great. You can easily cut the butter in half and still get great results. White pepper and adding roasted red peppers makes for a visually stunning result. If you're looking to impress company use fresh pasta and the white pepper. Thank you for a great recipe!

Excellent recipie. The sauce turned out nearly perfect, although I might put a little bit less butter then the ingredients call for, it was still just fine as it was. I also put in some basil, which did make quite a bit of difference in a positive way. Try with a bit of basil, or use pesto with basil already in it...definately yummy.

I made this for my husband for a special holiday meal. Substituted fat free half and half, used unsalted butter and a reduced fat pre-packaged pesto to cut back on calories/fat, etc. It turned out incredibly. I also used Fusilli pasta as opposed to linguine. I would definitely make this again.

I have to agree with those who have said that this is a restaurant quality dish.  I made it for dinner tonight and not only did I think it was one of the best pasta dishes I have EVER eaten, but my husband loved it just as much.  This is a dish that is simple enough to make any night of the week but is elegant enough to serve when entertaining.

Excellent recipe and inexpensive.  I used imitation crab meat and the pre-cooked frozen shrimp, deveined and tail-off.  I only needed 1/3 of the crab meat package and 1/3 of the shrimp to feed me and my husband perfectly.  The remainder crab and shrimp can be refrigerated and frozen, respectively, to save for another night.  For variety add mushrooms or peas.  A guaranteed successful dinner.

YUM and SO EASY!  I cut the recipe in half and used low fat ingredients--low fat marg. and half & half.  My husband even liked it and he's not a big fan of seafood or creamy sauces.  I'll definitely make this again.

I substituted more pesto for the grated cheese (which I can't stand.) I ended up using a jar of store-bought pesto and added about 2 oz of olive oil. That kept from getting too creamy, and I could actually taste the basil. 

I also kept the heat low and extended the times until the sauce was finished, so it didn't curdle. 

There was a LOT of sauce; I doubled up on the shrimp and still have so much sauce left over. I might use 3/4 of the butter and cream next time. I think olives and/or sundried tomatoes would be a good addition here as well.

Excellent recipe.   I did cut the butter in half and used a full pint of half and half instead of heavy cream for the healthier aspect.  This dish would have been even more fantastic if I would have stuck to the recipe with the butter and cream. I also added in half an onion, half a red pepper and half a green pepper shortly before adding the Parmesan.  The onion I have to have, the peppers were pretty much just for looks and texture.   I also added in a couple shakes of cayenne pepper which I think really added to the flavor.   The base recipe needs none of the improvements that I made, but I did like them with it.   I will make again.

This was a really tasty pasta dish.  Since we like our pastas saucy, I only used 8 ounces of linguine.  It would have been way too dry with the full pound of pasta.  I used half and half because I didn't have cream, and I also added some garlic powder to the sauce.  My husband and I really enjoyed this and will make it again.

Add about 15 min to total time Prep time if you are prepping your shrimp, grating your cheese, adding fresh tomato, herbs etc. Very good. Used only 3 Tbs of butter (just under a 1/4 cup), half and half in place of heavy cream, chopped garlic vs garlic salt. Added a bit of fresh basil in addition to pesto and sautéd the shrimp with a pinch of basil and salt and added to sauce the end after letting the sauce thicken. Chopped about 8-10 grape tomatoes and added to the sauce just before the shrimp.

This is an awesome base for a great sauce! heres what I added and altered!
1 lb. pasta
1/2 stick butter
2 cups heavy cream
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup pesto
1 lb. shrimp
1/2 can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon cornstarch (to thicken it up)
2 cloves garlic (to Saute Shrimp)
2 tablespoon olive oil (to Saute Shrimp)

I sautéed the shrimp separately in the olive oil and garlic with a little bit of pepper then tossed it in with the pasta and the sauce later... was SO GOOD! the tomatoes add great color.

We love this recipe and use it all the time- but we always add 2-3 more tablespoons of pesto, than the recipe calls for- so that it is more flavorful.

This was fantastic! I made one change - half and half, not heavy cream. Fairly quick and easy, and both my husband and I absolutely loved it! It also reheats well.

I will cut down a bit on the butter next time as well, purely to cut fat.

This is a decent shrimp pasta dish. It seems to be lacking a little in flavor. The fat content is too high for the effects of the flavor. (better options to spend calories, in my opinion) Just about everyone will like it bc it definitely tastes good...just not great.

This was so good, but I did change some things based on other reviewers. I used 1T margarine, added garlic, diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic, used 1 1/2 c heavy cream and 1/2 c 2% milk, and added extra cheese and broccoli. My husband loved it and so did my kids who normally don't eat pasta. They even asked for seconds.

I would make this again. Easy, quick & tasty. I made this 90% as written except I used much less butter & more cheese (adore cheese). The shrimp are upstaged by the sauce, even seasoned. The sauce is the star & would be awesome with chicken ,grilled portabello mushrooms or just over pasta.

This can be made with lots less fat and calories by using fat free half & half and using olive oil for half of the butter or eliminate it all together as well as the parmesan in the 1/2& 1/2 sauce. By using Smart Taste pasta you also lower the calories and fat while increasing the fiber (downfall: adds sodium) I also think it needs more of the pesto. I ususally use the package mix (Knorrs -2 pkgs. for this amount) also. Serve the parmesan for on top of each serving as desired.

Sounds wonderful as comfort food..which of course is always delicious, but on my heart disease diet, my doctor would cringe. I'll definitely tweak it a bit to suit my diet--kudos to the recipe owner for a truly majestic dish.

P.S. This is not a dish to serve on a regular basis due to the large cholesterol and fat content.

WOW it was great personally I would have preferred to have chicken instead of shrimp!  My husband and I cannot wait to try it with chicken.  It was a little greasy but great overall!  Quick and easy too!

This dish was very tasty BUT...super rich.  Almost to the point where it gave me an upset stomach.  I will definitely attempt this recipe again but definitely cut back to half the butter and heavy cream.  Other than that the taste and texture of this dish was amazing.

Excellent!  I made with chicken and it was delish.  I added a can of diced tomatoes.  The tomatoes broke up the creaminess with a little tang.  I'll make this over and over again with fresh pesto from my freezer.

We had never had pesto before, but had quite a bit of basil in the garden so I made homemade pesto and then looked for a recipe to use it in.  As other reviewers had suggested I first sauteed garlic and mushrooms in butter and added some diced tomatoes at the end.  My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much and will use it again sometime!

This recipe was excellent.  A big hit with the fiance who was craving pesto.  I prefer to make my pesto fresh but I used jarred on hand.  I also used half n half to cut some of the fat.  I recommend using some of the spaghetti water to help thin out the sauce.  Once you add the cheese it does thicken up remarkably fast.

OMG! OMG! This is sooo good and so easy to make! The only difference I made to this recipe was substituting half n half for the heavy cream and I also didnt have any Parmesan so I just used the Mexican cheese blend. Thank you for this recipe, I will make many more times :)

This had really good flavor.  I tried to use margarine instead of butter and half and half instead of heavy cream, and the sauce didn't get as thick as it should have been.  Next time I will try corn starch, but I didn't have any on hand.

Excellent dish!  I made a few low-cal changes: Since pesto in a jar has plenty of oil in it, I only used about 2 T butter and 2 T virgin oil (in place of the 1/2 C butter), then sauteed onion, garlic & fresh sliced mushrooms; then added 2 cups low calorie 1/2 & 1/2.  My husband must have said at least 3 times while he was eating it "don't loose this recipe".  Thank you, really great dish!

After reading some of the reviews, I made a few changes:  Sauteed garlic and mushrooms in 1/4 c butter instead of 1/2 c.  Used half & half instead of cream.  Added chopped red & yellow pepper just before the cheese, and added broccoli crowns along with the shrimp.  I also had a can of lump crabmeat in the cupboard so I tossed that in, and sprinkled chopped green onion and fresh basil on top just before serving over angel hair.  The result was really good, although with all that I added I'd like to double the sauce next time.

This dish was fabulous!  I made it for dinner last night and my husbard and I devoured it.  We are both fans of pesto, so this was a no brainer.  The only change I made was to use light cream instead of heavy cream cause it was what I had on hand.  Will make again.

Good and fairly quick. the worst part was stirring the cream sauce consistantly. I used frozen/thawed, pre-cooked shrimp and it was still great. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.  As the sauce cooled it has an interesting consistancy, but i contribute that to the butter and cheese separation.  Still yummy!   My husband said, "I'm in, it's great"

This recipe got rave reviews from my boyfriend! He said this was the best shrimp dish he's ever had. I think it's a very solid dish, but I wasn't overly impressed. I tried to cut back on the fat by using half and half. I'm not sure if this is the reason, but the cheese always clumps, so the sauce isn't smooth and creamy. I find this pasta tastes best after a day of letting the flavors marinate in the fridge. Very simple to make.

Fatty...of course. Great? Yes. To add to the heart attack I added a tiny bit of bacon in the sauce once I added the shrimp...VERY good. However mine turned out very oily and ugly. I would always recommend homemade pesto rather than pre-packaged because that adds the extra oil and gooey crud.

Oh. Wow. This was so tasty. I took a reviewers advise and added sauteed mushrooms, diced tomatoes, scallions and removed the pan from the burner and slowly added the parmesan.  I also used 1/2 the butter...not oily at all. I will DEFINITELY make again.  Thank you!

This was great recipe & I will make it again with a few adjustments to help cut down the fat & calories but as is, this a great dish to have on a cold night; fills you right up.

to quote jj_howell27 "I think next time I would serve as a side dish with steak or something because it is so rich. This is a special dinner meal, not an every night meal unless you crave bigger pants!"

Good stuff!  I made my pesto from scratch (also from a recipe from this site) and the end product was creamy and yummy.  Fresh parmesan cheese makes a difference.  The dish is quite rich tho and filling, so next time i'll be making smaller portions.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I've made it several times-it's especially good with home-made pesto (simple garlic and basil pesto from this site--minus brazil nuts). I've tried the lower fat recommendations as well, and trust me--never sub margarine for the real butter, but 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream works just fine. I've also served this with silced grilled chicken (seasoned with McCormick's Montreal chicken seasoning) and it is to die for!  Definately a dish worth keeping  for a fast, elegant dinner. Thanks!

This is an excellent and easy recipe.  I like to use half the butter, as it can end out a little greasy depending on the oil content in the pesto you use.  It's also great with chicken instead of shrimp.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this with imitation crab and some homemade pesto.  Man, it's good.  The imitation crab adds quite a bit of sweetness, which is accentuated in the leftovers the next day.

This dish turned out surprisingly good despite the changes made. I used half and half and smart balance butter to cut down on the fat.  It didn't turn out as thick as I'd wanted but it was still very good! I also used sun-dried tomato pesto and added olives and artichoke hearts!

This is a wonderful recipe for company!  I made this for Mother's Day Dinner and everyone wanted the recipe.  I added onions, garlic, mushrooms
and 2 tbl. of flour to the butter(for thickness), then used the half and half as suggested to make a little healthier.  This is a make again dish!

I'm not a huge fan of pesto, but this was SO GOOD.  I am going to get very, very fat...  I made this the other night for my mother and sister and they both loved it (my friend devoured the leftovers and demanded more).  And tonight I'm making it again to use the leftover pesto.  I'm substituting chicken for the shrimp though, since I didn't feel like buying any more shrimp!

We loved this.. I am eating low carb, so I added Scallops, and Salmon along with the shrimp.  I also threw a bag of frozen cauliflower, Broccoli, and carrots in with the boiling pasta.. I didn't eat the pasta - But the kids sure did!! 3 adults and two toddlers - We ate the whole bowl!! We'll definately have this again!!!

Wow! This was really wonderful.  I would not be suprised to find a dish of this quality in a top rated restaurant.  Not only was it yummy, it was quick and easy to fix.  My husband and I loved it.  By the way, we are on a low-carb diet and if spaghetti squash is substituted for the pasta, it is a perfect low carb dish.

The sauce was a little thinner than I expected, so I think next time I will reduce the whipping cream to 1 3/4 c and 
increase the cheese to 1 1/2 cups.  Flavor is excellent though!

Very yummy recipe! It comes pretty close to what my mom makes (and she makes pesto from scratch). I used spaghetti pasta, half&half heavy cream, Barilla Traditional Basil Pesto, and added a few chops of white mushroom. I cooked the shrimps with olive oil and salt beforehand so it doesn't take forever to cook them with the pesto sauce (the salty shrimp added more to the overall flavor). The only extra tweak I would make next time is to chop up the shrimps a bit. This recipe was delicious and definitely a keeper!

This is just what I needed after a long day at work. Fresh, yet comforting. I did change some things due to health reasons and finances (love shrimp, but it's expensive here). Also, I love veggies. I did not salt the pasta water, and used whole wheat linguine. I subbed olive oil for butter, and reduced it down to not quite 3 tbsp. I sauteed 4 pressed cloves of garlic, 2 chopped scallions, a cup of sliced mushrooms, a diced green pepper, and a diced red pepper in the oil. Then diced a lb of chicken breast, seasoned with pepper and Italian seasoning, and added it to the veggies. After the chicken had browned, I added a cup of half and half, then mixed a tbsp of cornstarch to a cup of 1% milk and added that, and added the pepper. I used only 1/3 of the parmesan called for. Added 1/3 cup fresh chopped basil with the pesto. Served with green beans that I cooked with some fresh garlic. This was a very good meal. The whole family loved it. Will definitely make again, and when finances allow, will definitely try with shrimp.

I made this and it came out wonderfully. However I make my own pesto. For the pesto I fill my blender with one large bunch of fresh Basil, two cups of parmesan cheese, one cup of Romano cheese (both grated but never that bottled stuff like KRAFT, it is usually sold in bags in the exotic cheese area), 1/2 cup of Extra virgin olive oil, 1 1/2 cups of pine nuts and 8 cloves of garlic. Add salt to taste. You can add more cheese or more garlic to your preference. 

Freeze what you don't use. It's great on sandwiches, wraps, pasta, chicken and more. I sometimes place it in several small freezer bags so I don't have to defrost all of it to use only a small amount. 

Oh, a change I made, I didn't use the butter at all. Pesto tends to separate so I used some of the olive oil that settled on top of the pesto. It had a wonderful flavor!! I also used half and half instead of cream. It was delish!!!

1st time followed directions: amazing. 2nd time I was out of cream (or Greek yogurt is what I actually use). I added some red pepper flakes and extra olive oil, so it was still shrimp pesto pasta (just not creamy). I also used julienned zucchini instead of pasta. Turned out really tasty...even for the picky eaters in the family.

Mine was too runny and I should have let the milk and butter thicken up more. Added garlic and peppers. Pretty, pretty, pretty good

Family loved it. Used half the butter suggested, much more black pepper, no shrimp as none on hand. Did use half Romano, half Parmesan, again bc what was on hand. Will def make again and probably use scallops instead of shrimp.

Awesome!!  I only used 1/4 cup Butter and 1 cup + 1 splash of Heavy Cream.  I had plenty of frozen pesto that I had saved from making a big batch last summer, so I added about 1/2 cup of Pesto.  I didn't measure the Parmesan but it was probably only 1/2 cup, not a full cup.  Other than the measurements (of high fat ingredients) being lower and Pesto being higher, I made it exactly as written and everyone LOVED IT.  Definitely a keeper!

Amazing!! The only thing I did differently was sauté the shrimp separately in a little olive oil and butter then added 3 cloves diced garlic right before removing from the heat. I then added the shrimp to the sauce.

Use half and half instead of heavy cream, use 1/4 cup olive oil instead of butter, and 3/4 cup of Parmesan. Just as tasty with less fat!

This sauce is perfect.  I omitted the shrimp and put the sauce over pasta and then added a grilled chicken breast over the pasta.  SO. GOOD.  Keeping this one, for sure.

My husband has been looking for a recipe like this to make. He said, "it was exactly what he was looking for". My only suggestion would be to add a little salt and pepper. I ranked it a 4 simply because it was great, but not "oh, my....that is the best pasta I have ever tasted". However, this WILL be my pesto pasta go to recipe.

We used 2 c half-and-half, 2/3 cup pesto, 1/4 cup butter, and an extra 2 tsp of dried basil and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Next time I would try using all heavy cream or half heavy cream, half (half-and-half). Don't know that I'd add the dried basil again. Think it needs more butter too...more like the original recipe. And definitely more salt. 

Also, cooked the shrimp separately in a tiny bit of olive oil with 4 cloves of garlic and a splash of white wine. The shrimp had GREAT flavor! wouldn't change a thing there.

I guess I'll give this one of my rare 5-star reviews. Despite being quite unhealthy, the taste of this dish is awesome. I was a bit skeptical about mixing pesto in with the butter/cream/cheese sauce, but it worked out wonderfully. I made this recipe exactly as written, except that I didn't have enough shrimp. My more-than-a-pound of 16/20 count shrimp, after thawing/draining/peeling, turned out to be less than 12 ounces. If I made this again I would definitely add more shrimp. The suggested substitution of crab meat is sort of intriguing, too.

Fantastic and rich - I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe which is pretty forgiving even when I altered the ingredients and quantities by leaps and bounds! 

For starters, I left out the butter completely because the calorie count was a frightening 600+ I did however use a smidgen of olive oil. Also, I substituted heavy cream completely for milk, and while it turned out to be a very watered down, I multiplied the pesto by 3 so that thickened it up! I also substituted Parmesan cheese for Mozerella - which is not really a good idea because it clumps up instead of dissolving in the sauce, so maybe next time I will stick to Parmesan, heh. 

I also started out sautéing some garlic and onions, and later on adding some chilli flakes for some kick. To finish it off I added some cubbed tomatoes to give it some extra zing.

At the end of the day I had this delicious, rich and slightly spicy sauce. Come to think of it, I almost never used any of the ingredients and it felt like I was doing up another recipe of my own but well, I had a great outline to work around!

I made a 3-4 serving version of this dish with reviewers suggestions.  I used .32lb of shrimp.  6oz of wheat linguine pasta.  1TBS of butter.  1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  3.5 oz pesto (1/3 cup).  1 cup half and half.  Only 1 teaspoon of basil, anymore would be too much in my opinion.  The sauce needed about 3 teaspoons of flour to finally thicken.  The end result was excellent!!

Simple and delicious! I accidentally bought the tiny bay shrimp, but it was still great.  I would probably add a little salt next time (I didn't taste before I served). But all in all it was a very easy very delicious recipe the entire family enjoyed

This was delicious! Although I did have to make a few minor changes! I doubled the black pepper and pesto (only because I love pepper), only used a 1/4 of butter, and 1/2 of Parmesan cheese. I also added basil and white wine! Yummy!! The kids are asking me to fix it again tomorrow!

I was looking for a creamy pesto sauce and this was perfect!! I didn't and wouldn't change a thing!  I used an Emeril Lagasse recipe for pesto (Pesto alla Genovese).  One of my sons HATES pesto, but I had him try this and he devoured it.  My husband is kind of so-so when it comes to pesto.  He also loved it and had seconds! We will definitely be having this again!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I made it without the shrimp for a vege option and it was YUMMY. I made it with only 20 g of butter and LOTS of garlic (3 cloves!). I also made it with 250ml heavy cream and 250ml milk. If you mix the two and let it simmer for about 15-20 min it gets thick enough without adding cornstarch :). I stirred in the Parm and pesto only after taking it off the heat. I then mixed it with the hot pasta and about 1/2 c cooking water. YUM
Also - 3 Heaped Tbsp Pesto could work if you're short like I was!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  As I melted the butter, I added mushrooms.  I then added 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of half and half as per some recommendations.  I wanted to keep some of the heavy cream.  Met a nice person who makes a fabulous pesto and used his homemade pesto and this was great!!

Replaced the cream for milk and 2 Tbs. flour.  Added zucchini & pepper medley.  Decreased the Parmesan by 1/2 and increased the Pesto to about 1/2 c.  Delicious!

I made this with 1/4 cup butter and half and half instead of heavy cream.  As someone else recommended, take the butter/cream mixture off of the heat and stir in the Parmesan veryyy slowly.  I also used a "heaping" 1/3 cup of pesto and added 3 cubes of frozen basil (from Trader Joe's).  Next time I will be adding fresh garlic and some additional spices because there wasn't quite as much flavor as we usually like.

In general though, this is a great recipe!

This recipe is delicious. However, I made a few changes to decrease the fat/calories. I used fat free half and half instead of the cream and only 1 TBS of Smart Balance instead of the margaringe/butter. I used Farfalle high fiber/high protein pasta. Once the pasta and sauce/shrimp were done, I mixed it all together and let it sit in the pan for a few minutes to allow the pasta to soak up the sauce. Served this with a light salad. Divine!

Love it! super easy and super tasty! I did cut the recipe in half for 2 people. And don't add any salt, the pesto will have enough in it. We will be making this again for sure!

I used 1c. 1% milk and 1c. heavy whipping cream and then followed the recipe. It then tasted a little salty so I added a bit more cheese which seemed to help. The recipe is good, but a bit powerful. I would make it again for someone who absolutley loves recipes with shrimp, but otherwise it was a one time thing for my family.

This was great! I pretty much followed the recipe only making a few changes. I used 1 c heavy cream 1 c half and half, I used about half the amount of butter. I made a bit more pesto than called for. To make the pesto I added about 1/3 cup Basil, a handful of chopped pine nuts, 1 Roma tomato seeded and chopped, 1 sun dried tomato in oil chopped fine and about 1/2 dozen mushrooms chopped fine, along with 2 cloves minced garlic.  I sauteed it all in oil, then pureed it and added the cream and butter, cheese allowed it to become bubbly. I tossed in the noodles and put the shrimp on top of the platter for presentation. It looked very pretty and tasted amazing.

Ok, but heavy!  I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, cut the butter and cheese in half, and doubled the pesto.  It was still a little heavy for us and despite doubling the pesto, it was a little bland too.  I'm not sure I will make this again.  For only 1 lb. shrimp, you could easily get away with only making 1/2 of the sauce - we had a ton of sauce left over.

Good base recipe. However, it would have been too heavy as originally written. I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream, and cut way back on the butter. It was still pretty rich even this way, so I can't imagine making it with loads of butter and cream. I also added fresh basil, red pepper, and garlic to the pre-pesto mixture. That helped, but it still could have used a little extra something to suit our taste. I also added steamed broccoli and asparagus, which was nice. I'll make this again, but with more spices.

I love this recipe!  It is easy and delicious.  I typically follow the instructions as they are written.  Sometimes I don't have shrimp, so I either make it without or use leftover chicken.  Fantastic!!

Only gave this one 4 stars because I had to change a few things.  I was concerned about the fat content, as others were, so I used half and half cream.  Also added some garlic and sauteed it with the butter.  In the last three minutes of boiling the pasta, I added in about a cup of chopped asparagus.  There wasn't as much sauce as I would have liked so next time I will add more cream, cheese, and pesto.  The left overs sure didn't last long!

This really doesn't need more reviews, but I will say that you can kick this phenomenal recipe up even higher by making your own pesto, which is ridiculously easy, and let's face it, there's nothing better than fresh and homemade. Also, if you use a really quality parmesan, you can truly taste the difference. The only thing I did differently was to add a couple of chopped tomatoes at the end right before tossing with pasta. It doesn't get better, or easier, than this.

Just like most, I substituted with half and half and used a whole jar of pesto. Also added chopped tomatoes and mushrooms and squeezed some fresh lemon juice over the finished product...mmmm, yummy. Totally awesome recipe that is simple but restaurant quality. Friends simply loved it! Next time might add roasted peppers just for a little color and flavor.

This was very good. I think that I would increase the pesto to 2/3 cup next time. I had a hard time getting mine to thicken up so I will also add more Parmesan cheese.  Other than that it was great!!

This was a very good recipe, very tasty.  If you want to cut down on calories and fat, decrease the butter and cheese & use lite cream.  I did that, and also doubled the pesto & added some dried basil (1-2 tbsps).  YUM!  Thanks Loreta, for a new shrimp dish!

I did a few changes too using half amt. of butter, used light cream, 2 cloves of garlic which I will increase the garlic next time and add more pesto to the milk as suggested by another. Husband didn't think it was very flavorful but my son and myself really enjoyed it.

This recipe is delicious! I used half-half like previously suggested. One minor change, I didn't cook the shrimp as long as the recipe states because I tossed it and let it finish cooking in the pasta. This way the shrimp was at perfect!

This was a delicious meal. I halved the recipe and used homemade pesto (3 ice cube portions). My shrimp did take a little longer to cook, but that could be my stove. Thanks for a real keeper!

A great, simple recipe as is or add a few embellishments like minced garlic, scallions, mushrooms and diced, fresh tomatoes and/or fresh basil to really add some pizzaz according to taste.  Definitely use fresh Parmesan or Romano.  I used fat-free Half and Half because that was what I had on hand.   Contrary to what a previous review said by tamartini, this is definitely pesto.  You're just using the prepared pesto which IS basil and pine nuts.

We love this recipe!  This is the second time I made it, and it is delicious!  Last time I made it with shrimp, and it was great.  Today, I made it with chicken breast and added some mushrooms.  I also used homemade pesto, which I think makes difference.  I added touch of lemon and some garlic.  Fabulous!  Thank you Loretta for sharing this awesome recipe!

This is a great recipe, just not "The best." You don't need to have the full 1/2 cup of butter, I used 5 Tablespoons and would have been fine using 4, or 1/4 cup of butter. I also used half and half like the others said, this really helps cut out some calories. Use as much pesto as you want, there really is no definite amount. Like the others have said, I added some garlic and onion to the mix as the butter was melting and threw in some Italian spices as well as ample S&P. As the sauce was thickening I added some corn starch as well to get it to the consistency I wanted. You can really make this sauce your own, but as long as you keep the general formula, you're in for a great dinner, and one that sounds pretty impressive!

As written, this recipe must have been FANTASMIC!!! I had 2 lbs shrimp, pesto, and pasta, so I used this as my basis and used about 2-3T butter, about 1/2 c. evaporated milk, a little garlic, and the rest of the pesto (about 1/2 c.). I thickened it with about 1 T. of cornstarch and added the remaining Parmesan (almost a cup). It was great.  Thanks a lot! This was just the type of recipe I was looking for, and my adaptation was great!

Excellent!  I didn't skimp on anything..I used the good stuff heavy cream, all butter, etc.  This Italian chick is proud of her curves!  I did use Knorr's packet of pesto and it turned out fabulous...good thing about this recipe too is there is plenty of sauce.  I did add plain diced tomatoes, and scallions which gave it a little extra kick.  Definitely will be making this again, thank you!

This was ok.  I don't think the taste was worth all the calories.  I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream, and definitely cut back on the butter, and I always use whole wheat pasta.  Added fish instead of shrimp because that's what I had on hand.  Diced tomatoes and green onions would definitely taste good with it as well.  Good recipe, tastes fine, I just wouldn't make again because of all the calories.

This is a great recipe, and perfect as is.  If you use anything other than heavy cream, it will curdle and need whisking and thickening.  Not an insurmountable problem, but be prepared.  I prefer flour and water as a thickener if needed; it's harder to detect than cornstarch in this dish.

This recipe was really good and like most pasta dishes, even better the second day. The only thing I changed is that when I added the pesto, I also added sliced mushrooms.

Awesome!  You don't need to add flour, just spend the time reducing the butter cream mixture ( I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 1%).  I used my own pesto -- 2 cups basil, 1/2 cup parmesean, 1/2 pine nuts, and 1/2 cup olive oil and garlic to taste -- 2 or 3 cloves.  I did add garlic to the butter, sauteed, then added the cream/milk.

I used half & half instead of cream and added much more half and half than the recipe called for in order to have enough sauce to feed a family of six.  I also used 2#'s of shrimp and added sliced mushrooms.

I don't ordinarily write reviews for a recipes, but I just had to thank the person who submitted this for helping me serve my family a delicious, restaurant quality meal that had them raving. It was so easy, in fact I made it on the fly with things already in my pantry--I did add garlic to the butter in the beginning, and used half 'n' half as some people suggested.  This will definitely be included in the regular repertoire from now on. Thanks again!

Very good and so easy. I also used half and half and cut at least one tablespoon of butter out.  This would be very easy to make for company.

OMG This is very very good.  My thighs are still laughing as they expand from all the calories.  It was worth it to make it as it, whipping cream and all.  I did add a bit more parmesan, but otherwise followed recipe.  I might try a lower fat version next time, but not sure.  It did appear runny at first when I poured it over the noodles, but it thickened as it cooled.  My 2.5 year old LOVED this.  I think next time I would serve as a side dish with steak or something because it is so rich. This is a special dinner meal, not an every night meal unless you crave bigger pants!

My dad LOVED this, said it was one of his favorites.  I decided to make it one day when I had a can of pesto and didn't know what else to do with it.  I used half and half, and I used shredded chicken rather than shrimp, and canned pesto... delicious! :)  I'll be making it again

Being someone who is fairly new at cooking, you could say that my family was more than surprised that I actually made this myself...It is so good!  Now I have made it several times, for fam and friends, and every time it is a hit.  I do enjoy the sauce on its own, but I also like to add other veggies like mushrooms or broccoli to "beef" it up a bit more so I am not solely filling up on all pasta.  It is a really flexible recipe, and I am so glad I found it!  Thanks for the great idea!

This was so awesome. We had leftovers of this and today it is almost already gone! I used about 1 1/2 lbs of crabmeat and followed the recipe exactly except for  1 can of diced tomatoes I believe had a roasted garlic flavor, drained.Will definetly be making again soon!

Absolutely delish!  I did not use fresh parm (preshredded was fine) and I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup half and half.  Also I used an entire 7 oz. container of pesto instead of a 1/3 cup.  After melting the butter and adding the cream I was worried it would never thicken- but after I added the pesto it did.  Just be patient.  I added the shrimp and stirred until they began to pinken- then I removed from the heat and left it to cool a bit.  Thickened up beatuifully and the shrimp were PERFECT.  Very rich and sinfully fattening but worth every calorie- thanks for the new keeper!

Great recipe, like the others suggested, we minced 2 cloves of garlic and put it in with the butter as it was melting.  Also, we added a little more shrimp.  Great recipe!

My 4 year old loved the noodles (although he wouldn't touch the shrimp). I used half & half instead of heavy cream. I also sauteed some garlic in the butter before adding the cream. I think I might have used a little extra pesto, also. Another reviewer mentioned adding sundried tomatoes - I might do that next time or just use  sun-dried tomato pesto.

Yum! Fabulous and easy! Just like they all say, a restaurant quality dish.  I made a half recipe and added sauteed mushrooms and a can of drained diced tomatoes when I added the pesto.  You've got to add those!  Also, my shrimp were overcooked after 5 mins.  Definitely come down on that time, maybe even by half. And my husband and I both wished it had capers. If you like them, add those in too! I will next time. . . Also, I'm excited to try with chicken too! I could eat this every Sunday.  Yum!

Made this for dinner tonight.  Absolutely wonderful! The only change I made was to add some garlic (can never have too much) to the butter in the beginning.  This is a keeper.  I don't even want to think about the calorie content!!!

I made this without the shrimp as a side and it was wonderful.  I wanted to amplify the pesto flavor so I doubled the amount...this was tasty but it started to separate so be careful!

excellent taste! first time i followed a recipe exactly and still loved it. i've been mixing butter, pesto and a 1/2 jar of alfredo for a sauce for years and this is a very little bit more work, but much fresher than jar sauce. this one is a keeper. thanks!!

This is one of the best pasta sauces I've ever tasted. I halved the recipe but followed it exactly. Didn't have any trouble with curdling, separating, clumping, or not being thick enough. After I added the cheese, just as I do when I make alfredo sauce, I whisked the sauce. Thanks so much - can't wait to share this recipe!

Made this for dinner last night and everyone liked it.  As other reviewers suggested I added crab meat.  I also started by sauteing four cloves of garlic in the butter.  After adding the pesto I thought it was bland so I added white wine, cayenne pepper and some port wine.
Very good.  Will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Any recipe this easy and that tastes this good is a winner in my book!!! If I can make it anyone can!  It took me 15 mins to whip this fantastic dinner together and it tasted wonderful!  Love how creamy it is... I did add a creamy pesto rather then regular one to make it even thicker! For sure a keeper!

I would give this 10 stars if I could. This is the best recipe I have used off of this site.

I used 1 cup Cream/1 cup Skim Milk (didn't have enough cream)and added a little flour (about a tbsp) to thicken it up a bit. I also used Land O'Lakes Roasted Garlic butter instead of plain butter, very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

This was a very tasty dish and easy to make. I didn't want to buy a jar of pesto because I didn't know if I would use it so, I used made pesto with the package of pesto mix that you just added olive oil and water to.

This recipe was amazing! I made it for my shrimp lover and he gobbled it right up! Perfect creamy texture and the flavor is divine. This one is definitely going in the book. Wouldn't change a thing about it! Thanks, Loretta!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! Everyone really liked it! My husband said it was the best shrimp pesto he's ever had. I’m sure we’ll be eating this quite often, thanks!

Excellent base recipe, but I made some radical changes to reduce fat.  For the sauce base, I used a Pampered Chef recipe: 3/4 c. fat free sour cream and 1/2 c. fat free evaporated milk.  Heated this over low-med heat slowly, added 1/2 c. parmesan/asiago blend and heated just long enough to melt cheese.  Boiled the shrimp and pasta separately in the meantime.  Then stirred in 1/3 c. pesto and the shrimp.  Served over pasta.  Neither my husband or I thought it was too heavy, as we've had in restaurants.  Next time, I'd like to find reduced fat pesto and be able to add more to this version...as it could surely use more of the pesto flavor.  Hope this helps anyone looking for a less fat version on Loretta's fabulous recipe!!

Loretta, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this recipe!  It was exquisite.  I made it this evening for my family in honor of Mother's Day and my mom went nuts over it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfection, the type of pasta dish that you'd be served in a nice restaurant and then order again next time because it's so good!  The only thing I didn't like about it was deveining the shrimp, that's one of my all time least favorite things to do and I always seem to forget how much I hate it until I'm doing it again.  For that reason, I think I'll try it with imitation crab or chicken next time (or go vegetarian). Thanks again!

This was one of several dishes I made for a large party we had over Christmas and it is awesome.  I doubled the recipe and used half shrimp and half crab. I didn't think is was a "heavy" dish like some other reviewers think.  The only problem I had was finding the pesto.  I was able to find it on my third try at Krogers.

I loved this recipe!  My husband loves it as well and I can't wait to have company for dinner.  The only problem I had with it was that the sauce was a little too thin.  I am going to try it with flour as stated below and see if that helps.  I made this with shrimp & scallops.  Delicious!!!

I swapped out the shrimp for two cans of crab and it should get ************** stars instead of just five.  I think it was the best and easiest pasta meal I have ever tasted and prepared.

This was really good...  To make it healthier, use whole wheat pasta (extra fiber), half and half (less fat and half the calories), and sun-dried tomato pesto instead of basil pesto (also less calories - check the labels).  Adding lots of veggies helps too.

This really is restaurant quality.  I toned down the pesto though for my kids' sake.  It still was outstanding.  It's too rich for everyday, but if you need a recipe to WOW your guests this is it.

This was AMAZING.  I would not change a thing.  Thank you Loretta for such a wonderful dish.  My whole family loved it.  Next time I will try the crab but I can't imagine it being better than the shrimp.

I took the advice of other viewers and used half and half and added mushrooms.  I also added several chopped roma tomatoes, which I think this recipe really needed.

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  I used pre-cooked, deveined, frozen shrimp and just thawed the overnight in cold water in the fridge. Made the fantastic Pesto recipe from this website and tossed in thawed shrimp in the end.  Very good! I will definately make this one again and again!

My husband enjoyed this dish very much, but I did not like it at all.  I used the half and half and added mushrooms like everyone said to do, but it was not creamy at all.  I must have cooked it at too high of a temperature.

my husband made this and i wasn't watching very closely but the end result was a little odd.  It was almost like the cream soaked into the noodles.  It tasted good but not like the creamy dish i thought it would be.

Very good.  The whole family enjoyed it.  However, my cream sauce did not come out very thick.  By the way, what is "pesto sauce?"  Spaghetti sauce?

This was my first time making an Alfredo sauce.  It was wonderful.  I didn't have pesto so I used about 15 large leaves off my basil plant.  I used small shrimp that I cooked yesterday.  I'm sure that chicken would also be a good choice.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was the best recipe I have tried in a long time.  I used Half & Half instead of heavy cream.  I also steamed the shrimp in cajun spices before I added them to the creamy mixture.  Using Pesto Basil was another ingred. that really gave this dish a kick.

This was a really good recipe!  My husband loved
 it, we'll be having this dish regularly now.
 Instead of using 2 cups of whipping cream I used
 1 3/4 for a little thicker consistency.  I also
 think that adding mushroom and scallions to top 
off the recipe would make it even better.

Love the creamiest. Taste great, even my 6 year old loves it. I added a little salt since we like our food salty and fried the shrimp separately with olive oil and vinegar. Will make again.

I substituted one can of evaporated milk for the heavy cream and added sliced fresh mushrooms. I added no salt, but it evidently got plenty from the pesto. It was DELICIOUS! I will make this again.

I really enjoyed this meal and added to my Snapchat (ateyarich) story to show my followers how to make it. Now I agree the texture of this dish to be off a little but I enjoy the flavors. So next time I won’t add as much Parmesan. All in all... I loved it

I gave this 5 stars because my guest went crazy for it. I printed the recipe out for all of them. They really raved!
I made it with 1/2 and 1/2 and not  heavy cream to save the calories and added a tbls. or so of cornstarch to thicken it a bit.
I know I would have liked it even better with the heavy cream. 
Also it was so easy and quick to make that it is a wonderful meal for company.

Made as is, with the cream and all, except I use frozen, cooked, northern shrimp (the tiny kind). At first I was getting a strange texture, but then I realized I should whisk the sauce! Since then everything has been great. Surprisingly quick to make, too! Instantly became a staple in our home.

My husband said this is one of my best dinners.  After reading others' reviews I made half the amount of sauce to cut down on the fat content for both health and taste.  I used a half cup of both heavy cream and low fat milk and the sauce was still plenty rich tasting.  And like one reviewer suggested, I added some chopped red pepper which added color and a bit of crunch.

This recipe was delightful! The perfect mix of cream and pesto. My advice would be to follow the directions precisely and do not forget to stir the butter and cream mix frequently. Delicioso!

I sauteed some garlic in the butter, then the shrimp, and set aside.  This way the butter had more shrimp and garlic flavor.  Then I proceeded as directed, reserving a little pasta water in case I needed to thin it out.  I also poured the sauce all over the pasta with the shrimp and gave it a good stir, then let it sit for 15-20 minutes before serving, letting the pasta soak up that delicious sauce!  This was amazing!

This was really good and I will be making it again. I made a few changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I used less butter (1/4 cup) after reading other reviews and I also used half n half, only 1.5 cups. I had some fresh spinach left and I love onions so I sauteed half a small onion and the spinach with white pepper. I added the half n half and stirred until hot, then added some granulated garlic and  stirred in the cheese and the pesto. Then I added the shrimp when it was hot along with two small diced tomatoes. I also thickened it with about a TB of cornstarch in water. This was delicious! I will make again, using whatever veggies I have on hand. Thank you!

I made this exactly as written and it was very good.  

There are a couple of recommendations I'd make for first timers/next time.

First, an entire box of pasta was a bit much, the sauce didn't stretch that far for me.

Also, one thing that is noted in an early step, but not throughout, is that you need to stir constantly.  I found that i needed to stir constantly through every step, not just that one.  Make sure you're aware so you aren't trying to multi-task too much.  But this was quick, easy, and delicious, and it's heated up very well!

I don't like to write a review when I alter anything in the recipe, but in the ice storm, I am improvising. This recipe is quick and delicious!  I didn't have enough heavy cream, so I had to substitute about a 1/2 cup with 1/2 & 1/2 and still didn't have quite enough liquid. I ended up using about 1 1/2 c. of cream total. It turned out fantastic. I also had to add some Romano cheese because I was out of parmesan.  It all blended nicely. Even my 5 & 6 year old kids loved it!  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent. Restaurant-quality; whole family loved it. Only changes I made were that I didn't add all the parmesan as I used home-made pesto which I thought was rich enough in parmesan (I did add a little extra pesto though). I also thinned it with a little milk near the end as it was getting quite thick by the time I served it... it still thickened up nicely and I was able to stretch the sauce a little further this way. I will definitelly be making this one again... YUM!

It was good, if not a little rich. I used half heavy cream and the other half was half and half. Next time I think I will use all half and half, less butter,  & more pesto. I think fresh basil would be great if you had it. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe! We love basil and have tons growing in the garden, so always looking for different ideas. I added a couple gloves of garlic to this recipe and used half and half instead of cream, because that's what I had. It was great! I even used some of the leftover sauce on some leftover chicken and that was great, too!

This was a very good place to start but I just could not use all that butter and heavy cream, so I used 2 table spoons of butter and use half and half instead of heavy cream. I also use shallots and garlic in my sauce and up the pesto by 2 tbsp. It still came out very creamy and tasty.

followed others' suggestions: 

sauteed 4 cloves of garlic in about 1T butter.  Added half and half instead of cream.  I ended up putting in a little cold water with cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Tossed with penne and broccoli.

I'd suggest cooking the shrimp separately... it was hard to see when they turned pink, and they got overcooked.

Everyone thought it was delicious! It took a little longer to cook than the recipe said because the sauce wouldn't thicken, so I had to add a little corn starch. I also used half-and-half and fresh parmesan cheese. I added some pine nuts for garnish. Great dish!

This was yummy, but that's a lot of calories, so it won't be in our rotation, but still nice for a treat.

I used much less butter and it turned out great! Also, instead of shrimp, I used tuna for a cheaper option and it tastes amazing!

Wow.  I just make this recipe tonight.  It was delicious.  I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup, but next time I will completely eliminate it.  I upped the pesto to 2/3 cup as some other viewers suggested an used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Next time I will also add some crushed garlic.  All in all, this recipe is really good and worth a try:)

Love this dish! It was quick and easy. I did use a jarred pesto and angel hair pasta. Just a preference. Followed the rest of the recipe.  I seasoned to our taste lots of pepper, garlic and crushed red pepper. We like it spicy. Next time will add some scallops and broccoli.  I didn't skip the fat. I used the butter and heavy cream. Yummy!

I've made this recipe several times for friends and family and each time I receive nothing but resounding praise about how good it is. I usually add crushed garlic and thinly sliced bell pepper…feel free to also add cubed chicken to this recipe if you’re allergic to shellfish. This is one recipe that I've found to be universally accepted as great. If a person likes pesto they will love this dish….

Great recipe. I read through some other comments first which suggested less butter, so I halved the butter content. I also doubled the amount of shrimp suggested, but that's just due to personal preference and because when I ordered the shrimp I was misheard and was given twice what I needed. Other than possibly too much butter, the recipe is great as written.

between it was okay and i liked it... you need to add so much garlic or its just plain bland... but maybe thats the way its suppose to taste.. Its probably once a year i have a craving for pesto something but always end up disappointed... then i remember why i never like it... oh and I used half and half... just a smart way to go

Loved this. Made it by recipe the first time. Second time, I cut the butter, used 1/2 & 1/2 and added garlic. Tonight I am doing it the same way, but using some pre-baked salmon with the shrimp. Worth taking a day off my diet!!!

This is a really great recipe! The ingredients are simple, but the taste amazing. We used fully cooked and frozen shrimp. We simply defrosted it under cool water and added to the cream sauce to heat. We paired the pasta dish with a dry reisling. amazing! I will be experimenting with a lighter version as suggested by others.

I love shrimp, pesto and pasta so I had to definitely give this recipe a try. Turned out the way I expected it -- yum-o!! I did a little tweaking though: I fried the shrimps in garlic and butter first then added to the sauce. I also didnt have creme on hand so I used the closest one I found in the pantry: cream of celery. Still turned out tasty!! This is a keeper.  I will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe.  And its versatile.  We've made as written several times, thrown in chicken instead of shrimp with some garlic, as well as bacon and spinach instead of shrimp.  Soo many possibilities.  Thanks for sharing!

This was amazing! I didn't have heavy cream on hand so I made a roux using the 1/2 cup butter and about 1/4 cup flour. I then used 2 cups of 2% milk. Otherwise followed recipe and we loved it. Served over breaded chicken cutlets.Yumm...

Excellent meal! I used much more pepper -probably a tablespoon because I love pepper, and tri-colour spirals instead of linguine. As well, I sauteed some sliced chicken and added it to the sauce at the end instead of shrimp. Oh -and for pesto, I used the pesto recipe on this site by ANDERVAL. Delish!

This was very good, but I also modified it a bit, based on previous reviews.  I added a couple cloves of garlic, used half and half and when the milk mixture seemed like it thickened just a bit, I took it off the heat, let it rest for about 3-4 min, and then whisked the cheese in a bit at a time.  It was really good.

This is so good. I used half and half instead of heavy cream because I just happen to have a lot of half and half and no cream in the fridge. I am growing lots of basil in my garden so I have a freezer full of pesto.

I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and it separated, so it wasn't very eye-appealing.  The flavor was okay, with lemon.

Amazing and so easy to make! I'm not the best cook and I've always wanted to make a dish that wowed my toughest critics - my brother and boyfriend. I loved this recipe; I simmered it for about ten minutes to thicken the sauce up a bit more. This recipe had my family going back for seconds. I definitely recommend trying this out for dinner.

Yum!!  Tastes just like Red Lobster pasta.  I used salad shrimp because it was cheap, and really liked it!  I like how flexible the recipe is.  Could easily add capers or cut asparagus.

Do not substitute 1/2 and 1/2 for Heavy Cream!  Try sauteing shrimp in olive oil and garlic before adding to pesto mix.

I added Chantrelle mushrooms (saute at the start in the butter) and this was fabulous! I also substituted cream for half and half. We had this as our valentines dinner with chilled white wine. My husbandliked it so much he asked me to add it to our "tried and try" secret recipe book. Success!

This recipe is wonderful and one of the few that everyone in my family likes. Very easy to make and what my husband calls "restaurant quality". I like to cook my shrimp in a little oil and some old bay before adding them to the sauce.

Fantastic! Like other reviewers, we substituted the cream with half and half. We also tossed in sliced mushrooms and a little bit of minced garlic right before we added the shrimp. We would definitely make this again!

My family couldn't stop raving about this recipe. My 10-year-old insisted on eating dinner by candle-light, it was that special! I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, and reduced the butter to 2/3 cup. It was still very rich. Next time I'll try using 1 cup of whole milk and 1 cup of half-and-half.  Pesto, pasta, shrimp, and parmesan--what's not to love?!

very verstile recipe, can be used with shrimp, chicken or lobster. I only made one change and that was to cut back on the cheese, oh and I added about 2 tablespoons of white wine.

I just thought this recipe was OK.  I agree with the previous reviewer that there is not nearly enough pesto flavor for me and the dish is extremely rich.  I used half and half, and still found the dish too rich and lacking in a depth of flavor.

Restaurant quality.  So bad for you, but so good.  Would like to try again but reduce the amounts of some of the not-so-good-for-you ingredients.

Huge hit with my hubby! I made it with Chicken for New Year's Eve, and the family loved it! Definitely going to make more regularly! I did sub half and half for heavy cream, and it turned out just fine. I also added in baby bella shrooms and my sister thought it tasted like her fav dish at her fav restaurant.

I followed the directions exactly, and although i accidentally set a dishcloth on fire when boiling the linguine, it tasted absolutely amazing.  I used frozen shrimp; placed on microwaveable plate, microwaved for about 1 min, then peeled off the tails, microwaved 1 more min, then added to the pesto sauce.

I made this with a few substitutions: half and half and 5T of smart balance butter. I also added 2 cloves of garlic (sauteed in the melted butter until fragrant) and 3/4 cup of pesto. It was very good, but both my boyfriend and I agreed that something was missing. I think next time I would use the whole jar of pesto and some fresh lemon juice. Overall, very easy and tasty- I would definitely make again when I'm in the mood for a super-rich dish. Perfect for a chilly fall night!

I didn't read reviews before making and should have!  It definitely needed more flavor....possibly some garlic?  And next time I would add more pesto too.

Good, but I wish it was healthier. Also, our shrimp was not the best, make sure to use fresh, not frozen. **update**Lots of work, everyone who ate it had a stomach ache the next day. Maybe the cream curdled. Will not make again :/

I was not impressed by this recipe, but I must say I did try to lighten it up a bit as others suggested, and maybe that is why I didn't think it was that great.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and the dry pesto mix.  My husband and I agreed that it was OK, but bland. I would recommend following the directions a little more closely and maybe you will have better luck with this one than I did.

Followed this recipe exactly but added a little chopped scallions and red bell pepper for color.  It was heavenly!!! Everyone raved about it. What a shame it is so fattening and expensive to make.

Made this recipe for the first time, and wow, what a great entree.  The sauce was absolute wonderful.  The shrimp were very flavorful.  Extremely easy to make, and prep is a breeze. A++  Will have to try this again another day.

I took three bits and was full by the amount of fat that is in this dish.  The sauce is WAY to thick, and way to rich!  It was almost more of a paste.  After i had already had my whole stick of butter melting in the pan, i had read how to reduce the fat in this dish.  I would consider trying some of the other cooks suggestions, but by then...you're  really cooking a completely different dish.

Loved this recipe.  I made it with the easy pesto recipe and it was great! Next time I´l put some more pesto to the sauce because it gave a great flavor.

Flavor was good, but the sauce was a little runny.  May make a few alterations if I ever make it again.

I've made this recipe at least 5 times now and love it every time. So creamy and good! It would be a more frequent item in our home except that my husband doesn't like shrimp very much. BOO lol. I've made it with chicken though and the sauce and everything tastes just as great. I do add some salt to it though. Other than that.... fantastic!

Yummy recipe!  I also threw in some sauteed mushrooms and freshly chopped tomatoes on top.  My sauce wasn't quite thick enough, but it was still a delicious dish.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It's delicious.  The only change I made was to substitute half and half for the cream and to add garlic to the butter.  Also, I bought cooked shrimp and used a fresh local pesto.

This recipe was a big hit.  The taste was amazing.  One tip though-add the Parmesan slowly.  Additionally, the recipe was not as good reheated. Best served right away.

I also used 1/2 and 1/2. I used cooked shrimp and added it at the very end. I followed others' suggestions to keep the sauce from curdling, and I had no problems. This was so very delicious! I was extremely impressed.

This is basically Shrimp Alfredo with some pesto added to the sauce.  I like shrimp alfredo and I like pesto, but now I know not together. When I decide to overindulge in so much fat and calories, I'll just stick with a simple rich and  creamy Shrimp Alfredo- not this.

I really hoped this would be as good as it sounded.  I love all the ingredients, but I used a pesto sauce that I purchased at the grocery store. The color was unappetizing, a violet grey.  You could not taste the basil or parmesan.  It was flat.  I will try this again because all the other reviews were good, but next time I will make my own pesto sauce.  It didn't look anything like the picture.

Awesome! Im on a low carb diet so I don't use low fat anything. Instead of regular parmesan I did use the combination kind..parmesan, romano, and asiago cheeses. Extra flavoring! YUUUMMMY!

Mine curdled, but still tasted great. Definately turn the heat down before adding the parmesan. Will make again, hopefully prettier next time.

The pasta was just OK. Not sure if it warrants all the 5 stars. I cut back on the butter and used half and half instead and it was still very very heavy. Like some others recommended, I used red bellpeppers which did add some some color and sweetness, but all in all it was still just "ok." On the plus side it was very quick, easy and efficient in putting me in a food induced coma.

I only changed one thing - 1 cup half&half and 1 cup heavy cream (in place of 2 cups heavy cream).  I did add a bit of corn starch to thicken.  Was fabulous.  All the family loved this -- even me, and I don't generally care for shrimp!  Might experiment with a bit more pesto next time, but isn't necessary.  Served over linguine with a Caesar side.  Yum!  Edit: I made this again, and it still ranked five stars, but I've decided I need to add even more pesto than I implied above.  Either that, or it needed salt.  Not sure, but one or the other - or both - is needed.  ANOTHER EDIT: I made this again last night, but I didn't have time to go buy pesto.  Instead, I made the sauce exactly from this recipe, but when it came time to add the pesto, I used two packets of Shillings "pesto sauce mix" I had on hand.  My family loved it!! - possibly more so than with store-bought "fresh" pesto.  So, if in dire straights for pesto, packets work very well, or even better.  (I suspect this depends upon the quality of the fresh pesto.  I plan to make my own and see if it makes a difference next time.)  **Added note:  My kids droop when I tell them we're having shrimp for dinner - but totally perk up when I tell them it will be "Creamy Pesto Shrimp!"

Easy weeknight meal.  Used half and half rather than heavy cream.  Would be good with any type of pasta.

I really enjoyed this easy to make recipe. I just cut down on the butter and used half and half instead of heavy cream to make it less fatty.

I made this recipe for my 1 and 3 year old and they loved it. The one thing 
I would suggest is using home made pesto sauce...so much better than the jarred stuff.

Followed the recipe as written. Very easy and quick to make! I did add the broccoli as someone else suggested for color and texture. Even my mom in law who is not a fan of most pasta thought it was great.

This was great recipe... I put some of everyones ideas into one, some red bell peppers, green bell peppers, and mushrooms all in a pan and seasoned them with some cayenne pepper, garlic power, onion power, some Tony's and cook them till they were done and then I threw in the shrimp till they were cooked. And made my own pesto. Then followed the recipe after wards.... Great recipe I already cooked it TWICE!

This recipe was pretty good. I will make it again with a few adjustments. I will add a couple cloves of garlic; there wasn't enough for my taste, even with the pesto. Also, I added tomatoes this time and I will also throw in some mushrooms and scallions next time as well.

Super-easy recipe, didn't modify a thing, but did cut the recipe in half for just 2 people.  Very few ingredients make it something easy to make on the fly.  The dijon mustard + lemon juice are the keys to making it fantastic.  I boiled up some penne pasta while it was baking, and it made a fantastic meal!

Nice dish. Sauteed 3 garlic cloves before adding the cream. For a healthier version, used half and half, olive oil instead of butter and less cheese. The sauce was too thick, so i added a bit of skim milk. Sprinkled with parsley before serving. Thank u!

I like this recipe but I tweaked it to cut some fat.  First, I cut the butter to two tablespoons and and one tablespoon of olive oil.  I sauteed the shrimp first in the butter olive oil mixture and removed it from the pan.  Next I added only one cup of half and half because I like a stronger pesto flavor.  I added the cheese and pesto as the recipe states and reheated the shrimp in the sauce right before serving.  My 5 year old ate every bite of his dinner and he usually doesn't like sauce on his pasta.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very creamy and yummy. You can't go wrong with both pesto and parmesean cheese. When I make it again I may use half and half instead of heavy cream, but I feel the shrimp makes it a bit lighter, so it's not all bad.

This one is definitely a keeper. On my first try, this was not only too easy and quick, but also delicious! I bought extra large wild shrimp and used bottled pesto. 
I thinly sliced red peppers and scallions for color and it came out just beautiful. 
The leftovers were so good the next day.

It was tastey, but just too heavy! It doesn't need that much butter and cream, which makes it very unhealthy. I would try maybe half and half like others suggested, and some olive oil and garlic and maybe half a stick of butter. I would also add a little salt or even top it with parmesean for a little more taste.

This was SO good!!!  I did do as others had stated and tried to make it a little healthier.  I used whole wheat pasta, half and half and I also used the entire 7ozs. of the pesto for extra taste.  Everything else was exactly by the recipe, and it couldn't have been better!  I will be making this again, soon!

My entire family loved this!!  It will certainly be a regular at our home!! My husband said it was better than any restaurant shrimp dish he's ever had!  I did make the "full fat" version, however, when I make it again I'll try using some lower fat substitutions to make it a little better for us...

Love this recipe! I used half & half and a little less butter to cut down on the fat. I also added a clove or 2 of minced garlic to the butter which added a little extra flavor. This is so simple and tastes like a gourmet meal!

Restaurant quality!!  The pesto is the perfect touch.  Use fresh grated Parmesan (please) lol, not the canned  (blech).

This was a hit with my family.  I found it very easy to use.  To save time, I bought frozen cooked shrimp (thawed out) and added it to the sauce for a couple minutes to warm it up.  I prefer to mix the noodles and sauce together before serving so that the noodles soak up the flavor.  It's great to have the leftovers (if any) the next day.

YUMMY!! My husband and I loved it. Will definitely make it again. Very rich though-I think next time I'll take the advice to use half and half.

This was eye-crossing, toe-curling good! I soaked the prawns in water, 1/2 t. baking soda and 1 t. lye water for half hr., then rinsed in cold water. This makes them firm when cooking. Learned that trick making honey walnut prawns. I did use 1/2&1/2 not heavy cream and will use a tad more than 1 cup next time. Did add garlic as suggested by others, I will add green onions next time. Will add real crab and a few scallops with the prawns next time. I did make it with my own homemade pesto, which someday I will submit to Allrecipes. Lye water can be purchased at Asian markets. One of the best recipes I have tried on this site......

I just made this for the first time. I added garlic like other reviewers suggested. This dish is absolutely wonderful! It tasted just like a dish I loved when I lived in Germany. I will definitely make this again, and share the recipe with others.

I thought this recipe was just so-so..until I let it sit for a bit. I think it was actually better as leftovers. Perhaps this is a good dish to make in advance for company. It makes about a TON of food, so you may want to cut the recipe in half for a smaller family.

This was fantastic - exactly like something you'd get in a restaurant.  We followed the recipe exactly, adding pre-cooked thawed shrimp at the end.  The sauce lost some of the thickness after we added the shrimp, but it was so delicious it hardly mattered.  I've also made it with grilled chicken and the sauce came out much thicker.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Wonderful recipe. I used a quick roux instead of heavy cream, and added a little less butter and cheese. I will definitely make this again.

because this is pretty rich i dont think its necessary to add parmesan cheese to the sauce, and definately not as much as is called for in this recipe. a few shavings of real parmesan cheese on top is all it needs. whats more, the butter and heavy cream shouldnt take 6-8 minutes to thicken as suggested and if you dont use good quatily heavy cream it wont thicken whatever you do! this might have been the reason why so many cooks had a prob with currdling. lastly, i added the shrimp as soon as the pesto was incorporated with the cream (after about 5 minutes of thickening the cream) as all the additional cooking time in stages 3 and 4 will only burn the sauce and not make it any thicker. hope this helps!

This is a no-fail dish. I often make it healthier by decreasing the amount of butter to 1/4 cup, and halving the amount of whipping cream by using 1 cup milk (and a bit of flour as thickener). Every time I make this, there are no leftovers. Thanks!

Probably my fault for not draining the frozen shrimp properly before adding to sauce.  Took me a while to get right...had to add cornstarch to get thickness.  This dish is only going to be as good as your pesto, so beware.
It was well-liked though.

This was totally delicious!!! I made it with shrimp and crab meat together. I also chose to use whole wheat noodles to make it a bit more nutritious. My husband (who doesn't like creamy sauces) loved it. My 1.5 and 2.5 year olds devoured it and I didn't even think they would like seafood.

This was incredible! I took some of the previous advice and added lots of garlic to the butter in step 2, and I also used half & half cream. Everything turned out great, very rich and fulfilling. I will definitely make it as a treat every once in a while. :)

This was very good.  I added chopped garlic to the butter mixture and salt to taste.  It was extremely easy to make and the taste was excellent!  My picky 5 year old had two heaping servings!  Next time I'll add crab meat as well!

This was an awesome dish.  I used half of the black pepper and another 1/8 tsp of red pepper.  I used a red pepper pesto and added fresh garlic when melting the butter. After the shrimp cooked, I also added some sauteed mushrooms.  It was served over bow-tie pasta. This was a big hit with our company.

Excellent!  Not too overwhelming with the pesto.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it still worked well.  I also used more shrimp to get some in almost every bite.

It is wonderful and easy!  I couldn't believe how good this dish was, my husband and 3yr. old even loved it. I just wish there was a healthier way of fixing it, but I guess that is what makes it so good.  If you are a beginner cook this is a great dish to start with and everyone will think you worked hard all day to prepare it. I will be making this dish again!  Loved it!

This was SO good! My husband and I haven't eaten this well in months! I added 2 cloves of garlic and a whole package of pesto sauce(the kind you mix with oil and water), I think this made it thick enough to omit the 2 tbsp of flour that I saw someone had suggested. I then added a can of fancy white crab meat and those mini salad shrimp. I mixed it with pasta and put it in a casserole dish with garlic bread crumbs and more Parmesan cheese on top. I baked it at 350 for 15 minutes in order to keep it moist. It was awesome! Next time I am adding diced potatoes!

Very yummy, very flavorful. A great recipe. But, a little too creamy for us. It was hard to eat a complete serving, and made us very full. But, overall I was really impressed.

Unless this is a starter then this recipe is enough to serve 2-4 people not 8.
We usually have just over a pound of pasta (500g) between 2. I halved this recipe and found there to be quite alot of sauce, next time I will half it again apart from the pasta, I will leave that at a pound and it should be ok, we don't like our pasta swimming in sauce esp double cream (your heavy cream) I will also double the pesto as cream is pretty much all I could taste,I was actually starting to feel sick with all the cream on my plate, my wife loved it as she is a cream sauce fan, I am not, so after I make my couple of changes then it may suit me a little better, also some extra cheese on top would be nice as well as extra black pepper.Thanks for sharing

I love this recipe because it tastes great and it's not too much fuss. I can get home after a long day at work and not have to worry about slaving in the kitchen for a good meal.

This is really good and easy. The only thing I added was a little extra garlic in the pesto before adding to the cream sauce.

This is was one of my favorites from this site.  It's delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I did add some imitation crab as others suggested, and I think that added a lot.  I also used a Knorr's packet of pesto mix.  My husband (who is very picky) loved this dish as much as I did.  Awesome!

in one word: amazing. But if you don't like Parmesan you will not like it. There is a strong parmesan flavor to the sauce and I am sure you could alter it if you wanted to, but it would not be as great. I made it with chicken and it was still really tasty. Best part: no leftovers!!!!

Excellent!!  And not to difficult... just keep the flame low.  I agree with the earlier recommendations to make it lower fat for regular consumption - I only used a couple pats of butter, and it was still great.

Loved this!  Awesome but good thing I took the advice of other reviewers and used half & half cream and cut the butter in 1/2 'cause it was still pretty rich.  I also added sliced black olives, capers, quartered artichokes, sun dried tomatoes and a little fresh lemon juice.  My husband requested I make this one a week.  Yeah Right!

Lets just say if a 24 yr old Male who isn't much of a cook can make this while cooking garlic bread and making a salad it can't be too difficult. The only down fall was that I had garlic breath so the festivities afterward were a bit cut short (the kissing part)

Fantastic recipe! Not difficult to make.  For easier serving, I combined the sauce and pasta in one serving bowl.  I would not do this again because the pasta absorbed the sauce and got a little dry.  Fortunately, I reserved extra sauce and was able to serve it at the table.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I thought this recipe was great! It was very easy to make, I didn't change or add anything. My husband said it was a little heavy for him, but that is was still good, he just couldn't eat a big  portion because it filled him up so quickly. Definitely a keeper, I also would make it for company, I think I would get rave reviews.

Oh My!  This dish was fanstastic!!  My family LOVED it!  I will definitely make it again.  I substitued 1/2 cup of milk (in lieu of using 2 full cups of heavy cream, 1.5 cups cream, .5 of milk), and took off a tbsp of butter ....I was trying to make it less atery clogging!  I LOVED THIS Dish, can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch!

This recipe is good but far to rich.  I added about 2 TBSP flour to the butter then used half and half cream.  I made my own homemade pesto.  It had great flavor but I could only eat a small portion b/c it was to rich!!!!!!!!  It also needs salt.  Probably won't make again b/c it is so heavy, we have tonnes left over.

This recipe was just ok for me. Maybe it was because I used half and half instead of cream. It wasn't think enough and the pesto flavor seemed to get lost.

This was amazing.  My husband and I were in Heaven eating it.  
I used just a little bit more pesto, just because I wanted to use up the container.  I also did not have time to shell and devein shrimp, so I bought it already cooked and just added it in the end, just long enough to warm it.  
It was fantastic and I am ready to serve it to dinner guests one of these days soon.
I would have given it 10 stars, if I could have...

I am just now rating this recipe that I 've been using for months.  I make it often and it has never dissapointed.  Make sure you keep the heat under control or you can easily make the parmesean go lumpy...still edible, but not so appealing.  I usually use fresh mushrooms, 1/2&1/2, and even a bag of frozen mixed veg (just run under hot water or lightly steam before adding).  I have even used this recipe with cut up and sauted chicken breast...excellent.  A very good recipe to use as is and to play with.

My husband and children give this a 5 Star rating. He agrees that this is restaurant quality. I do not care for shrimp and thought it was a bit bland for my taste... I used a curly pasta since that is what I had on hand and added some garlic salt after tasting it. I also sauted the shrimp and some mushrooms in butter and garlic before adding them to the sauce. I will probably try this again with chicken and broccoli over angel hair. (Which is more my speed) Thanks Loretta!

It was good, but a little too rich for my taste.  I could only eat a little of it.  I might try it again with less cheese.

What a great dish. This is so easy and fast to make that it really makes you look like a culinary genius when you serve it. My girlfriend loves this dish and says she would order this at a restaurant.

This was OK. I don't know what I did wrong. But it was very bland.  Maybe my pesto was not strong enough.

This was very good.  I was expecting to have a think, alfredo like sauce and mine came out runny.  I used half and half like the other subscribers had noted and I didn't feel like I was missing anything on taste.  Next time I will try with crab!

I used half and half, and am glad I did!  I don't think it compromised the flavor at all.  It really is delicious, just not a weekly menu item because of the fat content.

Long day, went grocery shopping, got home late, and finally made dinner.  Ate at 9:00, whew.  Very easy to make and wonderful!  My 12 year old ate two plates of it!  Somehow, thought, I might have well just taped it to my thighs, sigh...well worth the fat content however! Definite make again - maybe even for company!  Thanks!

I used crab instead of shrimp and realized at the last moment I only had half the heavy cream needed for the recipe - added the remaining portion as milk and butter and turned out great.  I also added some frozen mixed veggies to it to bulk it up for the hungry appitites in my house.

I must say I do not enjoy cooking, but I have currently been layed off so to occupy my time I have dived into the dreaded act of cooking, much to my surprise with all the compliments I have received I will definately use this web site for much needed advice and recipes.  This dish I prepared was such a hit that I plan on making it again for my parents, which btw my mom is the best chief ever, I'm sure she will be very impressed.  I highly recommend this recipe and pass it along, even all the children enjoyed it....Highly recommended.

This recipe was very good.  I generally like to cook everything ahead of time, but having all of the ingredients measured by the stovetop made this a cinch even with company! I added some kosher salt and extra pesto for greater flavor.

This was really good, but extremely heavy.I had a whole plate full and ended up not feeling so good. Although it was fabulous I think I'll use less fattening substitutes next time.

Not for those watching your calories - but well worth every bite!  My boyfriend suprised me with this for my birthday and I was convinced he had ordered take-out from our favorite gourmet Italian restaurant.  This is simple, rich and delicious!

I made this for my boyfriend last night and it was outstanding.  I am never good at following recipes, but it was easy.  I added spinach and sundried tomatoes and it was awsome!

This was magnificent! A very tasty dish. Not for the health conscious or dieters, though (all the heavy cream, butter, and parmesan). I made this for company and there were no leftovers. Everybody raved about it. With all the fat in this dish, better take a walk after the meal.

This was delicious & I’ve made it twice because my family loved it. I found that the sauce thickened up after it sat for a few minutes. The first time I plated the dish it seemed thin & by the time we started eating it had thickened. I used langostino the first time & shrimp the second, both were excellent. I’m sure chicken would be yummy too!

A great meal that's quick once you de-vein the shrimp. I used more pesto and added some garlic salt. Definitely a meal we'll have again when it's my turn to cook!

This was an amazing dish! Like from a fine restaurant. Made it exactly as written except that I cut this recipe in half. Worked perfectly. This recipe is really easy to make and makes you look good if you want to use it for entertaining. Thank you for this amazing recipe.

What a wonderful dish!  I kept right with the recipe but cut it in half, for 3.  I wasn't sure what to expect but the pesto puts a new twist on the alfredo sauce.

This was really good and we enjoyed it.  I used half and half to cut down on fat but otherwise followed recipe. It did come out rather runny and even though I stirred constantly with a wisk it separated.  I'll make it again.

I made this exactly according to directions the first time, and it was perfect!  Super fast and easy dinner.  The pasta is the 
 The thing that takes longest to cook, lol.  Second time I made it I happened to have some red peppers, and mushrooms, that I needed to use.  That just added a different level.  Not saying better, but I have wasting food, l'm actjually a vegetarian lately so I just scoop the shrimp off my plate and the family gets to finish it.  There are  times I do eat fifsh, so I guess that makes me a pescatrian.

i made a few changes to it and it came out awesome. I added about a cup of halved cherry tomatoes and I used a lot more pesto then it said to. It says to use 1/3 cup but after tasting it, i decided it needed a lot more. i used almost a cup,  i just kept adding it until it tasted right. I also added more parmesan to it.  ALSO I cooked the shrimp in a separate pan with butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, and about a tablespoon of garlic. This added a lot more flavor to it rather than cooking it in the sauce.

Excellent!  I used my homemade pesto that was in the freezer, so I used a 1/2 cup instead of 1/3. This recipe is quick,  easy and sooooo delicious!

This was the first time I made this dish and it turned out great I have to point out that I didn’t have heavy cream and I substitute half-and-half and then add an extra half a cup of grated Parmesan and topped it off with fresh grated Parmesan and purple basil. It will become a regular in this house!

Absolutely great recipe. The only thing I changed was 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup whole milk. It sounded too heavy to me with all the cream and I'm glad I made that one change.  Very light and extremely flavorful. I'll make this over and over.

Definitely will make this again!  I have made it a few times before but this time I added baby bella mushrooms (cooked in the butter first), added shrimp, scallops and crab at the end and then stirred in diced scallions.

Everybody raved about it!

I made this recipe and was so pleasantly surprised. I actually used Vanilla Soy Milk because I didn't want to use the heavy cream and it still turned out really well. I could certainly taste the hint of vanilla but nothing but rave reviews in my household.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I think this a really delicious outline for a creamy garlic pesto pasta recipe. I only use half the butter and about a quarter of the heavy cream. I like my creamy pastas where the sauce just sticks to the pasta with a bit extra for bread; not swimming.

I made it just as it said. Came out perfectly.   I was concerned about curdling & being too oliey  but I mixed up the pesto and before hand and added the heavy cream at at low temperature.  It is a keeper.  I will do it again only cut down on the fat content. I give it 5 stars.

Very good dish!  The only criticism I have is that there was not nearly enough pesto.  It was delicious made as described but next time, I'll probably double the pesto so that flavor is more prominent.

Very tasty!! I was cooking for 3 so cut recipe in 1/2 if you do this use a smaller pan it makes it easier when adding the Parmesan cheese. I added 4 cloves of garlic to the butter and a few sun-dried tomatoes to spice it up. My picky eaters gave it a thumbs up, it’s a keeper!! Next time I’ll serve it up with a nice salad & rolls.

I have made this recipe as written dozens of times.  It’s one of my favourites that I crave for lunch and dinner (and secretly in the middle of the night).  As a personal preference, I have added a couple cloves of minced garlic at the butter/cream stage.  My company loves it and always request it.  I serve with a simple mixed salad.

Made this recipe for the whole family and we loved it! We had to double the recipe and still worked perfectly! We made the substitution with half and half instead of cream and added some garlic with the butter, and zucchini with the pesto. We all loved it!

I came across this recipe in the recent Allrecipes magazine. They also posted the suggestion about using mascarpone instead of the white sauce. I tried it using this procedure. Get everything ready because it goes fast. I sautéed the shrimp in some olive oil and butter with 1 clove of chopped garlic. I removed the shrimp and added some sliced fresh mushrooms. When the mushrooms were done, I removed them from the pan, too. Cover shrimp and mushrooms with foil to keep it all warm while you cook the linguini. Finally, add the basil pesto and mascarpone to the butter/oil mixture. Note, for a half recipe I used 4 ounces of mascarpone. Whisk until smooth then add the Parmesan. Remove from heat, add shrimp and mushrooms, and serve. We found that a half recipe made 2 1/2 servings.

I didn't have the heavy cream, so I made mine. I also added cilantro for more flavour.

Delicious! Make sure not to thaw shrimp at room temperature though; I just learned that making this recipe. Tastes like restaurant quality and very quick and easy to prepare. Don't forget to add the cream; it acts as a binder for the other sauce ingredients and the sauce will not come together without it.

Delicious and easy! I overcooked the shrimp a bit, It's hard to see the color in the green sauce. One option might be to cook them separately in butter/olive oil and then add them to the sauce so that you can see them.

I made this last night and it was really good. I am always looking to cook new things and this has topped the cake. Very easy to make and I made my own pesto to go in this dish. Will definitely be making this again .

This is fabulous!!!  I left out the pesto, but made the sauce otherwise per instructions.  Normally I cook the shrimp first then add the sauce, but this was so much better, making the sauce first and cooking the shrimp in it.  I did add a few red pepper flakes to the sauce so it was very lightly spicy, and delicious.  Enjoy, one and all.

We loved this recipe and now we love it more with the addition of 2-3 leeks.  For us, they made this recipe pop!  Thinly sliced; sauteed in a little butter with:
Nutmeg, garlic, dill, basil.  I also add fresh cilantro to garnish.
I also deleted the 1/2 cup butter.  It's really not needed.
This is so good you can't stop eating!

I use 1 cup of half and half and one cup of milk. I added a tbsp of flour to the milk before cooking. I sautéed mushrooms and shrimps  in olive oil and garlic and added them along with some broccoli at end. The pesto made this sauce go to the next level of deliciousness!

I made it as stated but added peas because it seemed like it needed "something" for color and make it more "interesting".  Don't get me wrong. I made it last week and I am making it again.  I love pesto in general.

GREAT recipe! I would recommend, though, to half the butter and cream- otherwise its too fatty and oily to really appreciate. I also tastes very good when adding vegetables like broccoli and onion into the mix!

I used my own Parmesan bechumel recipe and added the pesto...to be honest I should have made less sauce but added the spaghetti to it and the result was more "soupy" than coated.  However, will not stop me from trying it again in the future

Followed Redrobin's recommended changes using half & half, no oil, fresh parmesan and double the amount of pesto. I also added minced garlic to the sauce while cooking, and more cheese to top off the pasta. SO loved it, will be making this again.

The only changes I made were to add a little garlic powder, and slightly cut down the amount of pesto (my parents had never had it and weren't sure). The sauce didn't thicken up as well as I wanted, but the taste was absolutely delicious. I'll definitely make it again!

My whole family loved this!  I made enough for left overs and had about a half cup left.  That was at least enough to know that it reheats well!  I made it with both chicken and shrimp.  It was so good!

I'm a tough marker!  This was really delicious, but a bit on the heavy side... or else I just ate too much.  Two teenaged boys loved it, though, and said that this recipe is a keeper!  Good!  It  was super-easy to make.  Also, super-fattening!  This recipe, if for 4 servings, is around 1000 calories per serving.  Just sayin'...

I halved the recipe and also used half heavy cream and half light cream hoping to save some calories.  I may try cutting down on the butter too.  I also used homemade pesto that I had frozen in ice cube trays and Pecorino Romano cheese.  It was magnificent and my family thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will definitely make this again - it's "company" good!

I used 3 spoonfuls of marcaparone cheese as one of the other posts suggested. Added a bit of half and half to make it the right thickness. Garlic and wine with the shrimp and added a couple cloves to the sauce as well. Yummy.

It was absolutely delicious. The shrimp soaked up and took on a lot of the sauces flavor and it was just divine. I wouldn't make this often based on the fat content, but it's definitely a splurge dish or  for a special occasion. Definitely not a lowfat recipe by any means. Tons of butter, heavy cream, and pesto sauce make for a fattening dish.

Very good - but I do changes so stop reading if that offends you!   :-D  I used half and half to cut down on fat, and as per another review, added chopped red & green pepper, green onion and mushrooms about two minutes before the cheese.  I used homemade pesto, but it really could have used more than the 1/3 cup.  Also could have used more shrimp than the 1 pound bag for a whole pound of pasta.  The sauce started out creamy, but then as it cooled, it separated a bit and got sticky on the pasta.  I think I might try making this with an Alfredo mix and just adding in the pesto - probably essentially the same taste without the work (and could be less fat, as well).  The shrimp cooked nicely in the sauce in about 4 minutes, and stayed moist without getting rubbery.

This recipe was amazing!!! Like many others, I decided to cut down on the fat by using half-and-half instead of heavy cream, and I also added 2/3 cup of pesto instead of just 1/3 since the flavor was not as detectable as it should have been. Additionally, I served the fish with some baked salmon on the side. After these few modifications to the recipe, the dish turned out great, and my family devoured it in minutes!

A great recipe! I altered it by using like a cup of cream and probably 3/4 cup of pesto to make it more pesto rich. I love this over farfalle or bowtie pasta too ??

Easy to make and delicious! I cheated a little and used pre-made pesto and Alfredo instead of heavy cream ... It made the sauce cheesy and gooey and oh so good!  I also added fresh baby spinach for some veg-appeal and we loved it.

This was a tasty and fairly simple dish to make. However, lower the cooking temperature so the sauce doesn't separate, and add more pesto. Also, can easily substitute chicken for shrimp, but would precook the meat before adding it to the sauce.

Loved it with mods: 2/3 cu pesto like suggested in comments, only used half the butter with no ill effects. Also used precooked shrimp. Super easy! 100% will make again. Is not the best cold.

I just stumbled upon this recipe and I must say it was simply delish.  I will admit, however, that to really bring out the full flavor of the recipe, instead of using plain linguine, I went for a twist and used lobster stuffed ravioli. Yummy!  

The next time I make this, I will definitely use some of the suggested variations in other reviews (less fat, more veggies) to create a dish rich in flavor but thin on calories.  Definitely a keeper!

This was excellent and I'll make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using linguini noodles.  Instead I made zucchini and sweet potato noodles with my spiralizer.  The sweet potatoes gave it a yummy sweet flavor.

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was delicious.  My 9 year old son loved it without the shrimp.  It's super easy to make.  Definitely not low fat though.  Making it again tonight!

Of course making this recipe as is, with all that butter, cream and cheese would result in a super delicious pasta dish. But, I couldn't  stick to the recipe and ignore the huge fat content..
In attempt to make a lower fat version of it and turn it into a complete 1 dish meal, I made the following changes : I sautéed separately 8 oz sliced mushroom and 1 bunch chopped asparagus and set  aside. I used only 2 tbls  butter, half&half for cream and only 1/2 cup of parmesan. I doubled the pesto sauce. I added the sautéed vegetables in the sauce to warm them up before adding the shrimps. Finally I used only 12 oz of pasta ( I used Rigatoni this time). Despite all these changes, this pasta was plenty creamy with a delicious pesto flavor. Looking forward the having the leftovers tomorrow.

This was very good.  But I scaled it down to 2 persons and I found it didn't make as much sauce as I would of liked.  I also used half the butter required and half full-fat cream and half 50/50 cream.  I will definitely make again.

You do NOT need 1/2 c butter.  That's crazy talk.  I used a tablespoon of butter along with a tablespoon of olive oil and only b/c I needed something to Sautee the garlic.  Also, I used half and half and still had no issues with thin sauce.  I only simmered thee sauce for longer.  Once you add in the cheese, it really thickens it up.  I added more pesto to my taste.  My husband really like the dish.  Nice for a holiday treat.  Thank you for the recipe!

My family really loved this and the sauce w/o pesto makes for great Alfredo sauce. Glad it didn't call for too much pesto, since it has a tendency to be overpowering. Works fine to double (I buy a 2# bag of shrimp).  Leftovers were a snap, didn't need to add any cream to reconstitute it.

Taste was good, but I agree with other reviews, it needed more basil, and it was far too oily...the oil in the pesto alone would be more than enough. I didn't have any shrimp on hand so i just made the pasta with the sauce, doubled the pesto, and had to add some flour to thicken it since I used 2%, and added some mozzarella for flavor. Would make again but without the butter, and maybe add some veggies.

Cut the recipe in half because its only me (yay left overs!)
I substituted the heavy cream with half and half. I'll probably make it again, but I didn't love this recipe.. Next time I'll be upping the pesto and lowering the cheese.

I used about 2/3 cup of pesto. And 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk to cut the fat a little. Both husband and I loved the result. Served over polenta instead of pasta as that’s what I had on hand. ??

We really liked this. My husband does not like pesto, so I used less and didn't tell him it was in there. He ate way too much, telling me the entire time how much he loved it. After he was finished I told him about the pesto, he didn't care and wanted to know if there was enough for lunch tomorrow! 
Everything came together nicely, super easy

As I'm cooking it, it didn't stir smooth & creamy as I thought it was going to be. This was surprising & disappointing. Ended up being really thick and almost pasty. Next time I will either cook it less or add more liquid.  I will also cut back on the parmesan cheese since my homemade pesto has plenty in it.  Definitely worth trying again.

This recipe is absolutely FABULOUS!!!  So delicious.  I think the key is to make your own pesto using fresh basil.  Makes a world of difference in any recipe calling for pesto.    Since I live alone, I cut the recipe in half, except for keeping the one pound of shrimp.  Would highly recommend this recipe!

I made this with the following changes from comments and my own changes.. I used evaporated milk and not half and half and only used 2tbsp butter.  Then I used about 3 oz of light cream cheese. I added 1/3 cup pesto, but not tasty enough, so added another tbsp.  Used fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Oh it was good.  And used Alabama Gulf Shrimp.   The best in the world.  Please don't use frozen.  Support gulf coast shrimpers!

This is a keeper!
I made two changes:
I used half & half as I had seen suggested and I used Penne pasta instead of linguini. When everything was ready, I just added the pasta straight into the pan with the sauce/shrimp mixture and tossed til well mixed. Simple and extremely delicious!

This was great. Very little adjustment to taste. Ratios were right on and all I added was a sprinkle of crushed red pepper to mine individual plate and it was pretty perfect.

I made a few changes so it came out as kind of a new recipe, but thanks to the original recipe submitter for the good idea! We  didn't use shrimp, and I used 1 1/2 cups of 1% milk instead of cream. Then I just used corn starch/cold water to thicken it to my liking.  Still plenty creamy to us! Got good reviews from my family, and cut way back on the fat and calories.  Thanks for the inspiration! (I paired this with Kandilynn's Breadsticks recipe, which were delicious and really worked well with the meal.)

This was very tasty! I halved the recipe as there were just 2 of us and it was more than enough. I also took the advice of others and used half and half. It was so rich, I can't imagine heavy cream! I also used shaved Parmesan which melted and thickened the sauce nicely. Boyfriend was very happy and wants me to add this to my rotation of dishes. I think it would also be yummy with chicken or lobster meat.

This recipe didn't lead me astray. I used Earth Balance instead of bitter and it cam out just as delicious. It was a hot day so I replaced some of the heavy cream with milk to make it a little less heavy. Worked like a charm.

All the cream and butter and everything just didn't add very much to a normal pasta with pesto dish. (when you have a good, preferably homemade pesto). Loved the shrimp though.

Excellent. Yes, you can use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. It'll thicken because of the parmesan cheese. You can even use low fat Parm cheese. It was a concerted effort. My husband measured (2 servings) the pasta and added it to the boiling water so I didn't have stop stirring the cream and other ingredients. It did not burn the pan this time. (as in other recipes). he suggested we use scallops next time. We also have left overs. Great. Highly recommended!-Lorelei

Great base, did a few extra things.  I cooked mushrooms, 1 shallot, and 1 clove of garlic w/ olive oil. set that aside.  I skipped the butter, just warmed heavy whipping cream for about 5 minutes, and then added diced tomatoes from a can.  Continued the warming and stirring for another 5 minutes.  Added pre-cooked shrimp, pesto (classico in a jar) and the cooked veggies to the mix.  Added red pepper flakes/salt and pepper.  And I stirred that on medium for about about 10 minutes.  It was a bit watery still, but to solve that problem, I scooped my sauce and mixed it in a pot with the cooked noodles to my desired consistency. Worked perfectly, and tasted amazing.

2 cups of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of butter? I cut the butter to 1/4 cup, used 2 tablespoons of flour, simmered it for a bit while stirring, added the milk, stirring until thickened. I then continued with the recipe. 
It was absolutely delicious.

This was absolutely fantastic!!! It changed my entire view on pesto pasta! It may have been better if I had cut up the shrimp into smaller pieces because it kept getting caught at the bottom of the pot, but I still truly loved this recipe.

Love this recipe I love creamy pesto alone. I use frozen shrimp for quick weekly dinners. Small tiny ones the kids enjoy. Thaw them out a bit and just add at the end. Love simple clean up meals. One really messy pan is all.

I agree with some of the other reviews that the outcome of this recipe is delicious BUT way too oily.  Even before reading the detailed reviews and looking at the ingredients I cut the butter quantity in half and it was still too oily!  Pesto has a ton of oil already.  For the next time I am considering not using any butter at all and making my own pesto so I am more in control of the amount of oil being used.

This was OK, but the quality depends on the type of shrimp and pesto you use.  The pesto we used was oily and garlicy.  Next time, I would use better pesto.

I dunno what I did wrong, but the sauce curdled and got kind of dry. It still tasted good, just had a different texture than I think it's supposed to. Will try again.

Wow, I don't even know where to begin to describe how poor the results of this recipe were.  In summary the dish was WAY WAY too fatty, almost inedible -- and I enjoy a rich pasta now and again. I followed the recipe exactly and am not a novice cook. The dish had minimal flavor, was too soupy and very greasy! I suppose I had the temperature too high when I cooked the shrimp in the sauce because the cream broke.  We ate this as dinner but the leftovers unfortunately went to waste.  Will not make again.  If you make I would recommend reducing the butter/cream, increasing herbs/flavor, and cooking the shrimp separately, in other words -- find a new recipe.

I used romano instead of parm and 2% milk instead of cream, because that's all I had on hand.  Still came out good though.  I'm new to pesto sauces so I don't have much to compare this to but it seems good to me!

This recipe was nice and delicious, and just what we needed this evening. I changed the portions to suit two, and used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the Parmesan since we had none - still worked as it helped thicken the sauce and give it a nice cheesy flavor. Will definitely try it again as practice makes perfect!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I added a little minced garlic to the melting butter and used frozen raw shrimp, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I probably should have fully defrosted them before adding it to the sauce (it thinned it out a bit). Another tablespoon of pesto fixed that. I will definitely make this again.

I follow the recipe as written and have made this dish many times.  It's always good no matter what kind of pasta I use - I don't always use linguini.  It's especially good if you use homemade pesto and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

Wonderful recipe.  I made the following modifications:  used half and half instead of heavy cream, fresh ground black pepper, 2 pounds of shrimp, the juice of 1/2 fresh lemon, and 1/4 cup of Chardonnay.  I also added fresh vegetables that I had lying around -- asparagus, broccoli, and spinach.  Added after the shrimp so the veggies didn't overcook.  My daughter even loved it!

I just wasn't a fan. It was greasy and heavy and I even used 1/2 as much butter as it called for. All in all it was just sort of blah. We didn't even keep the leftovers.

This is fantastic!  We had something similar to this at our wedding and now I've finally been able to recreate it.  I made fresh whole wheat pasta to go with this.  I only used about 2 Tbsp. of butter and subbed half&half for the cream.  I used Ina Garten's pesto recipe and highly recommend it.  I did not add any extra Parmesan since my pesto had a lot already.  My guests were very impressed and it made our 'tuscan dinner party' perfect.

This is a meal that can be prepared in under 1/2 hour - gotta love those ones! I used light cream (5% milk fat), added sauteed mushrooms, onions and garlic as suggested by other reviewers, and used homemade pesto made from this site. I made penne pasta and mixed the cream sauce with shrimp in with the pasta before serving. Tasty! Thanks for the recipe, Loretta.

Very good recipe.  Like others, I used half and half instead of heavy cream and less butter to cut down the fat.   I also used smoked gouda cheese because it's what I had, added mushrooms (that were sauteed before), onions and garlic to sauce.  It was a huge hit with everyone.  This is a great starter recipe.  I want to try it with chicken or the crab like suggested.  Thank you!

Okay, WOW!! This is an amazing recipe, I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and added a few dashes of cayenne to the sauce...adds a nice kick!! I also added fresh mushrooms, broccoli, and asparagus...for all you veggie lovers this is a great add!!  Made this recipe for my 2 year Anniversary and he LOVED it!!! Will make again! Thanks

Loved it! Very tasty. I made a lower fat version using 1 c. 1% milk, 1 c half/half cream, margarine instead of butter and added a little cornstarch to thicken it up. I also added cremini mushrooms and used freshly grated parmesan reggiano. It was truly excellent!

This stuff was really great. I sauteed 3 small cloves of garlic and sliced mushrooms with the butter. It wouldn't have been as good without them. Also, I think one could easily cut down the amount of butter just a bit. Also, I think next time I will cook the shrimp separately instead of in the sauce and then toss them in to coat, because due to the thickness and color of the sauce it was almost hard to tell when the shrimp were cooked through. I didn't want to overcook them but certainly didn't want to undercook them either. And oh yeah, i used half and half instead of cream and multigrain penne pasta. Great flavor!

I gave this 4* as I made a change out of necessity.  I added garlic, and since I had no parmesan cheese, I substituted (look away if you are faint of heart!) cream cheese.  It was very rich (duh...), but my husband said "oh so tasty!"  I will make this again, but probably go a little lighter next time.

Please note that the only reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because I put out the vote to my four picky eaters. This recipe passed with a pretty good margin with my children. Add to the fact that I am a mediocre cook and this dish STILL came out good. Well, you just can't beat that!

I was craving a pasta dish that was creamy, but that wouldn't take a lot of work. I do not eat shrimp, but I used this recipe as a base. First off- I cut the recipe down from 8 servings to 2. I still came out with a TON of sauce. It was enough to nicely coat a whole bag of fresh pasta (4+ servings)! The original recipe must be swimming in sauce- which isn't my thing. I sauted onions and garlic first and tossed in some italian seasoning. I used fresh garlic and parsley fettuccini & I used kraft parmesan cheese. Delicious. Just make sure you cut down on the sauce.

So good, very rich and creamy. I can't wait to try this with crabmeat. I wish I could give this recipe ten stars!

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. My children aren't the biggest shrimp fans so I sauteed the shrimp seperately and added to the sauce and linguine at the end. I also sauteed some red bell pepper and added that in for added flavor. I used light margerine instead of butter and half&half instead of heavy cream to try to make it a bit lighter and it turned out great! Thanks for sharing!

I make this with crabmeat, and it is SO delicious.  I know it must a ton of calories, but for an occasional treat it's great.  It gets great reviews from others as well.  Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely AWESOME!  Double the sauce recipe and add 1 lb. scallops (cook them the same time as the shrimp, so they're not tough).......UNBELIEVABLE!!!

This has become one of my new favorite recipes of all time! Thanks!

This was okay.  The problem I think I had was I bought a shrimp tray instead of the real thing.  I cheaped out because the shrimp was real expensive.  Next Time I will make sure I get real shrimp.

Meh. Pretty bland. Maybe a different/better brand of pesto would make a difference? Had to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Won't make again.

We liked this recipe. I thought the parmesan cheese was a little too much.  I will reduce that next time I make this.

this was pretty good! i made some modifications based on other reviews and i think it made the dish much better for our palette. I halved the butter, cream( we used half & half) and the cheese because i wanted a stronger pesto flavor.If you use all of the cheese when you half any of the other stuff its too goopy and you'll have to add more cream. i sauteed up some asparagus and red bell peppers with some garlic and olive oil for about 10 minutes, tossed that mix into the sauce and used the same pan to saute the shrimp with some garlic, olive oil and threw on a handful of chopped scallions and some black pepper. once heated through, i tossed them into the sauce and let it all simmer for about 5 minutes while the pasta finished. We used linguini AND tortelini to make it fun. Overall this was a great recipe, thanks!

Very delicious!!!

I used Penne Pasta (that's all I had on hand), half the amount of Fat Free Half and Half instead of whole cream, margarine instead of butter, and crab meat instead of shrimp.

It turned out really awesome!  Super creamy  (despite my cut of cream) and delicious.

One of the best recipes that I have found on this site. Really easy to make and very tasty.  We bought fresh pink key west shrimp and I think that made all of the difference.  It did take a little more time to peel and de-vein the shrimp though.  We also used half & half instead of heavy cream it was still delicious.

Great! I omited the butter since my pesto has a lot of olive oil already in it. I also used half the parmesan for the same reason. One of the best ways to use pesto if you're tired of eating it plain!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of buying frozen (thawed) already cooked shrimp. 

This was absolutely delicious - right up there with the Carrabbas and Olive Gardens of the world. My fiance requested it be added to the "rotation" :)

This was a great meal for us and for our guests. However, I would check with your guests first to see if they like pesto, as it is sort of a strong flavor and people generally either like it or hate it. I didn't have pesto on hand because I live out of the country but someone had sent me a few pesto sauce packets and I added 2 after I cut the recipe in half. Very delicious.

I was surprised at how yummy this dish was ... the first time I tried it with no alterations from the original recipe. Next time I will try adding the fresh peppers and mushrooms as another suggested or adding more shrimp. I definitely agree it's restaurant quality and something I will make for company in the near future.

I made this recipe for my family for Valentine's day. I followed the directions to a T except for a few small changes. I used half/half instead of heavy cream because that is all I had on hand. I also used precooked shrimp and I added a can of minced clams(minus the juice-I poured the juice into the water that was boiling for the pasta). We really enjoyed this but there was way too much butter. The next time I make it I will probably reduce the amount of butter to about 2 tbsp. Other than that I will keep it exactly the same. Very good. As side dishes I made bruschetts and a green salad. For dessert we are having chocolate dipped strawberries. The family is happy. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

The recipe was very good! I used frozen shrimp and marinated them in a bit of the pesto. I chose frozen due to the ease~ they were already peeled and de-veined. I also followed another reviewer and garnished with fresh chopped roma tomato and fresh cheese. I was very impressed with the taste and the minimal amount of time it took to prepare. I will keep this one!!

This recipe was only okay to me. I halved the recipe, and used half-n-half instead of cream. I also discovered that we were out of butter, and had to use margarine. The consistency of the sauce was not very good- it looked separated. Also, it definitely needed some salt added. I probably will make this again when I have some butter, to see if that helps.

Four stars because I had to make adjustments, and then it was great!  Used fat free half & half, but it came out thinner than it probably would have had I used heavy cream or regular half & half.  Sauted shrooms, onion, and fresh garlic in some of the butter I would have put in the sauce. May try cooking shrimp with the mushrooms next time, easier to season.  Definately could have used more veggies.  So good!  Very easy to overindulge so make sure you think about portion size and wait before considering round two!

This was very easy to make and very good.  My husband and father in law where so impressed.  I think next time I will be making my own pesto.  But if you have store bought pesto this is pretty fast to make.  No need to eat in a fancy italian restaurant!!

This recipe was wonderful! I added more shrimp and 1/2 cup of pesto with one package of linguini noodles 16oz. Tasted even better the next day.

Excellent!!  I was very worried because I've never cooked anything with pesto sauce and it had a strange smell while cooking. But I recived 5 stars from the boyfriend! I thought it was great until I realized pesto contains pine nuts and I am highly allergic to nuts.  So this recipe went over so well with the fam that after a half a bottle of benadryl I will still make it again..this time using my own pesto sauce ommiting the nuts!!  Then even I will get to enjoy it as much as everyone else did!!!

Incredibly quick and easy, and SO rich - almost too rich. I wasn't a huge pesto fan, but this recipe has changed my mind; I ended up adding quite a bit more. I served it with angel hair pasta, and garlic bread. Very nice. Thanks, Loretta!

this recipe is now a favorite! I also used half and half, made my own pesto, and used fresh large gulf brown shrimp. not great for the cholesterol, but still wonderful! Tried this with chicken to reduce the cholesterol, and wasn't very good.

This was good.  But, I'm only giving 3 stars because I don't think it's good enough to out weigh all the fat and calories.  I cut the butter in half which was plenty.  I also recommend using freshly grated cheese.  I used the Kraft pre-shredded (not the processed stuff) and I think the coating they put on pre-shredded cheese prevented it from melting all the way.  I'm glad I tried the recipe, it was good.  But, I wont make again.  I'll stick with the Penne with Spicy Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce recipe when I want to splurge!

WOW! So easy, so good, and sooo rich!  I used  freshly grated Parmesan cheese--added a little more than the recipe called for; doubled the pesto; and used 1/3 lb shrimp per person.  This is a keeper!  We'll use this as a "company's coming" recipe.

WOW A-mazing.. I cooked this dish for my boyfriend and my roomates...they loved it! I used spaghetti noodles instead of linguini. Its even good as a leftover! and my boyfriend and i never eat left overs!

***Update*** ive been making this for years now an the only thing ive changed is thr type of noodles i use, depending on what i have in my cubord lol so last night I wanted to do just and Alfredo sauce..I've been on a hunt for a new one since the ones that I've been making just weren't what I wanted..then I though "why not just omit the pesto in this recipie" and it worked wounderfly.. Just needs a little bit more salt in my opinion but I would say do this to taste since some people don't like as much salt. So from now on this is my alfredo recipie.. :)

I really liked the recipe - the only problem was that our shrimp did not appear to be de-veined, and so hubbie did half by hand and then we decided to screw it and use the rest anyway.  We got pretty grossed out by the shrimp and could barely finish eating the meal.  Next time we'll make sure they are DEVEINED.

I am re-reviewing this recipe because the first time I made it was a while ago, before I paid attention to what I ate and I cannot believe I consumed so many grams of fat in this recipe!

I remade this recipe and used only about 1/3 cup of Country Crock Ligh Margarine and also substituted fat free half and half with a small amount of corn starch in place of the heavy cream.  That right there knocks out most of your fat.  I used freshly grated parmeseam cheese (not the stuff in the can).

This was absolutely wonderful and had WAY WAY less fat than the original recipe.  I highly suggest people use this alternate version.

I made this very rich dish last night for my family. My husband loved it and my 3 and 5 year old did too. I would maybe use half and half instead of the heavy cream, as it was very rich. I also put some scallops in too and served it with some fresh hot garlic bread and Caesar salad..I would absolutely make this again!

I love cheesy thick sauce but this was too thick and heavy. I would have to substitute the heavy cream for something else,and for my daughter who is to young for seafood I just substituted that for chicken instead. Very good though.

AA ++ recipe !!!  Used angel hair pasta instead of linguine ... added green (not red) pesto to the sauce and twice the amount of freshly grated parmesan cheese than suggested.  A real hit with everyone ... would be delicious with scallops,crab or lobster ...

This was such a simple yet elegant dinner.  A few words to the wise.....if you use frozen shrimp be prepared for the sauce not be to as thick.  As for the pesto you may have some left over... I put it n a bowl made garlic bread and gave it to my quests as a dipping sauce.  They loved it.  Thanks.

Very tasty & so simple.
I changed one thing after reading a few reviews saying how rich it was, I used whole milk rather than heavy cream & it worked fine.  Next time for a variation I'm going to use chicken.

Wow!  We loved this recipe.  I did add just a little flour to the sauce to thicken it up, and it worked perfectly.  This is definitely a keeper!

WOW!  Delicioso- this tasted like something you would get in a upscale Italian restaurant, and took no time at all to prepare.  Everyone I made it for agreed.  I used cocktail shrimp, removed the tails, and added them at the end to make it even easier.  This has become one of my all time favorites.

This turned out well for me. I used freshly grated parmesan, not the powdered kind, and my sauce turned out quite creamy. I would make this again for a special occasion!

There is no way 5 stars is enough for this recipe!  Ten stars wouldn't do it justice.  This is one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  I can't stop thinking about it and I made it almost a week ago.  So, so good!

Not really what I was expecting but we enjoyed it. I thought that the sauce would be creamy since the recipe is called "creamy pesto shrimp" but it was actually very clumpy. I don't know if it was because I used low fat parmesan or if that's the way it was supposed to be.

I made this for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. I used little shrimp and a can of back fin crabmeat. It was very rich and tasty. Something I would only make once in awhile because it is so rich. But we both loved it.

Whoa!  The pesto was really overwhelming in this.  I'll try it again with half the amount of pesto.  Overall, it was average for us.  I ended up adding more cheese to try and thicken it a bit, and ultimately threw it in a casserole dish and baked it for 10 additional minutes.  I must mention that I added lump crab and chunked cod to the mix, and that really helped with the seafood taste.  I'll try it again with less pesto though.

Awesome.  Can't wait to try it with crab meat.  I did add garlic to the butter and used the jarred pesto, but I think I'll pick up some of the dried pesto others used for next time.  And I used large precooked shrimp which I really was hesistant about, but they were great, just don't over heat them.

Thought this was great, reminded me of something I might get at a nice restaurant.  The only change I might make next time is to add more shrimp or use smaller ones so that there's shrimp in every bite.

This is the first pasta dish I've cooked that tasted like it came from a fine restaurant and not my usual pasty mess. I like adding a little bit of garlic.

I like this a lot...my problem was that souse was not thick enough.... When I pour souse over pasta it was hard to blend it, souse was on the bottom of the dish so I had to scoop up extra souse when served. But otherwise, definitely good one…

Turned out ok, but the parmesean didn't commbine very well with the sauce.  Flavor was a bit lacking, maybe because the parmesean clumped up or maybe it needs garlic.

I made this recipe twice and both times it curdled and seperated. The taste was very good so I will atempt it again and not cook so long as one user suggested. But the taste was amazing.I coated the shrimp and scallops with it and we just had seafood and a salad I cant wait to get it right.lol

This dish was fabulous! I made a few mods that really heightened the flavor. I added: 2 green onions, 1 T minced garlic, a small can of black olives, a pinch of garlic salt, and a dash of hot sauce (hey, we're in Texas, hot sauce goes on everything!). My husband is not fond of cream sauces, but even he liked this one! Thanks Loretta!!

This was an easy recipe, and tasted good, but I didn't find it to be as flavorful as I would have hoped.  Maybe next time I'll fry the shrimp a bit before I boil them, it might help to bring out their flavor.

Very tasty, and incredibly filling recipe. I used some of the advice in other reviews (using 1.5 cups of cream, 0.5 cup of lowfat milk, and I tossed in a teaspon of garlic and a few green onions I had around. Also I used Basil Pesto), which came out quite well. The sauce will come out thinner then you expect, but it still tastes just as good.

Also, the serving size is a bit off. The 8 serving fed 4 (with a small salad and garlic bread) with a little leftovers..

husband loved this, so it gets 5 stars. i thought it was a bit grainy, but that could just be the parmesan. added a bit of mozz cheese too. used half and half cos that's all i could find at urban fare...turned out really good. served it with chicken kabobs from urban fare...yummy. i think i'll try this recipe with sun-dried tomato pesto next time, cos i like my sauces tomato-ey. good stuff. will be on my dinner rotation.

I think I cooked the sauce too long, because it curdled.  Also, I used lump crab meat.  I believe that shrimp would have tasted better.  It was pretty good, but was lacking a little something or maybe it was just too cheesy and lumpy for me. My daughter loved it, but my husbnd did not care for it very much.

I had to substitute the shrimp for chicken due to allergies but the sauce was fabulous (it better be with all of the cream and butter). I will make again but only if I can go running the next day.

I thought this recipe was just okay but my husband really liked it.  I thought it was a bit too rich and I found the sauce a bit too chunky (I followed the recipe but it was almost like it curdled).  I also found that there was too much parmesan so I added a bit more pesto ... the taste was pretty good but just overall was too rich.

Be careful not to stir for too long, it will begin to seperate.  It was a really good, really rich recipe!  I'll be making again tonight for some friends, I'm going to try 1/2 of 1/2&1/2 and 1/2 of heavy whipping cream...maybe it won't be soo heavy.  Overall, very good!

This was very good - the pesto adds a really subtle & delicious garlic/basil flavor to the sauce. I will definitely make it again. If you like fettucine alfredo you will ove this recipe.

Flavor was pretty good, but I must have cooked it on too high or did something wrong b/c the milk/cream curdled slightly.  I did read another review that mentioned the same thing, so I'm pretty sure I messed up somewhere.  I used half and half so it wasn't as thick as I thought it should be.  I also used pre-made pesto that had quite a bit of oil.  I will try this again and pay attention to the milk/cream and oil issue.

This recipe is fast, elegant enough for company and VERY flavorful!  To cut down on the fat, however, I shaved a little off the butter and used the fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and it was still excellent!  This will be a regular entree in our repetoire!

Super yummy dish!!  Only 1 small change for me, I used fresh linguine pasta.  Once I was nearly finished with the cream sauce and added the shrimp, I started boiling the pasta.  Fresh pasta cooks very quickly and timing was important for me.  I also added a little garlic salt to the sauce.  This dish presented beautifully and we look forward to having this again!!

This recipe is so easy to make and it tastes wonderful. A pinch of salt (depending on what cheese you're adding)would make it perfect.

Very good, everyone enjoyed it. It's the kind of recipes that you've got to get the timing right on, though. Sort of a "It's ready! Come and get it! Right now!" meal. I had some people over and since I didn't want to be standing in front of the stove while everyone was talking over their salads, I made it right before the came over. So, it kind of coagulated while I sat in the kitchen. The pasta stuck together and the sauce was too thick by the time I served it. No biggie, it tasted fine. Will make a few modifications before I make again. (I added the extra flour to the butter, like some other people suggested. Maybe that's it?)

This is a great recipe, but rich. Very easy to follow. I'd would only change two things and that is instead of using all heavy cream, I used 1 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of low fat milk. I also used saffola margarine instead of butter. Thanks for sharing.

This was absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  Following a prior recommendation, I added 2 Tbsp. of flour to the butter.  This made the sauce thick and velvety.  I will definitely be making this again.

YUM!  My favorite restaurant makes this and it's one of my favorite dishes there.  This is just as good, plus I can add my favorite veggies.  The husband loved it, too.

Mine was a little thin but I let it sit on the past a few minutes, like someone recommended below, and it thickened right up.  Plus, I love pesto and used double the amount.  I used a whole tub of DiGiorno pesto which was perfect!

Very filling--will feed quite a few people.

This was very very good. The only reason it doesn't deserve 5 stars is because it is so fattening. However, I did use half and half instead of cream and cut the butter to 3/4 of a stick. Still delicious! I also added mushrooms.

This is an amazing recipe that is a definite indulgence!  I have made it a couple of different times.  I used green pesto the first time and although it was delicious, presentation wise it was lacking.  I used a roasted red pepper pesto the next time and not only was it tasty but it was also beautiful!  I used half shrimp and half scallops.  Even my in-laws loved it!  Thank you for the recipe.

This is SOOOO good.  We make this at least once a week, and often reduce the fat by using less butter and using 1C half and half & 1C lowfat milk.  Turns out a little thinner, but still very good.  We also use the prepackaged frozen shrimp w/ tails off - run it under cold water 5 mins before adding & it's so easy!  No problem even for weeknight.  We've also added scallops to this - YUM.  Very, very tasty.  Restaurant quality.

Extremely easy to make, and a little more flavorful then the typical alfredo dish.  Make sure to stir the sauce constantly while making it, can burn quickly.

I thought this recipie was okay, but my kids loved it.  My 4 year old and 15 month old both ate 3 bowls each.  The main problem I had with the recipe was that the sauce was much too thin and the pasta was just floating in it.  I definitely think you could use less butter and cream and maybe increase the amount of pesto so that you won't have so much sauce floating around.  I also added some garlic powder to give it more flavor, but if I make this again I may add fresh garlic instead.  I don't think I'll make this as a family weeknight meal, since it's so rich, but I may work with it a little if I have company over.  Thanks anyway!

I have made this recipe a staple at my house. First of all, the ingredients are few and easy to keep on hand (shrimp in freezer, and pesto keeps for a long time in the fridge.) I just have to make sure to pick up some (half & half) at the store. Half & half is less fattening and the recipe still turns out marvelous. Another tip, I always add a bunch of baby spinach at the last minute. It's a great way to get veggies in the meal and tastes great!

Fabulous.  My husband said this was restaurant quality and said it would be a good dish to make for company.  I'm not a creamy sauce fan or a pasta fan, but I did really like the shrimp!

This was flippin' fantastic. I haven't had better in a restaurant. And considering I'm a male university student, it was very easy to make.

This dish is tasty but the sauce it a lot thinner than I anticipated.  It was much better as leftovers when the sauce had been absorbed by the pasta.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and daughter loved it.  I thought it was only okay as I do not like cream sauces.  I didn't have enough shrimp so I added cut-up chicken breast. I also used half-half instead of heavy cream but I wish I could have figured out a way not to use a whole stick of butter

I must have done something wrong with this...maybe cooked the sauce too long or let it boil or something...it wasn't the least bit "creamy", lumpy and runny though.  The flavor was GREAT but the consistency of the sauce wasn't appealing.  I will try it again though.

Creamy and delicious, but the recipe needs to be lightened!  This dish was much too rich.  Even with light butter and fat free half and half, I felt full after a couple bites.
