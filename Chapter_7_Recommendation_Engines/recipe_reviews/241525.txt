Excellent, very much like a cioppino.  Shrimp needs so little time to cook to stay tender, I added the zucchini first, and shrimp just last 5 min.   All that butter at the end is deliciousness, but can be halved.   Drain your diced tomatoes to reduce the excess liquid.  Mangia!

This dish had a lot of flavour. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. It tasted like it came out of a fine Italian restaurant. I was nervous to make it as I didn't know how the zoodles would go over but truly they tasted just like pasta and amazed everyone at the table. Definitely a 5-star dish! Thank you.

My husband and I really liked this dish.   It was good and full of flavor.  I did drain my zoodles for a while in a colander before cooking them.  It went together quickly and easily.  I was afraid the lemon would be overpowering, but it was perfect.  I will make this again.

It was pretty good, and I like salt, but HOLY COW that’s salty! I did some math afterwards...1 serving size of Old Bay seasoning is 1/4 teaspoon...so the 3 Tablespoons the recipe calls for comes out to 36 servings! (totaling 5760g of sodium!) And then to add more salt after that, yowza dude! I’d make the recipe again but cut the old bay/salt wayway down. Way way way down. I may still be thirsty by then too.

I followed the recipe BUT:  even with draining and pressing the zucchini it was extremely watery, more like soup. I drained off over 4 cups of liquid and there was still plenty left.
"4 zucchini" is  too vague,  the ones I used were about  8 inches and it wasn't nearly enough zucchini for the amount of shrimp.
The taste wasn't bad but for me I would use less of the spice mix next time.

Excellent recipe!! Very delicious and healthy with zucchini as noodles!! But the second time I made it, I reduced the Old Bay a little for a less salty taste. Grated Parmesan is better too!

I made it with cut zucchini over linguine rather than zoodles.  If you do it this was add the zucchini way earlier because they do take a bit longer to become tender.

Very good! Reminds me of a cioppino I used to order at a crab house in Philly many years ago - served it over spaghetti
