This salad is amazing! It was a hit with me and my friends. I didn't have any red wine vinegar or green onions at home though. So I used 3/4 white wine vinegar and 1/4 balsamic vinegar to make up the 1/3c. vinegar, and it tasted great. I also used green beans for a bit of green. I will definitely make this again, but would probably add even more fresh basil (and save some extra as garnish with the cherry tomatoes).

great salad. I scaled it down to 4 servings. I used my fresh tomatoes from the garden, and extra basil. (It has grown well this summer.) We loved it. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

As written, we really didn't like this recipe. The vinegar overpowers everything, and the flavor was just kind of bland. I'm not sure where the pepper flakes come into play, you really couldn't taste them at all. To doctor it up, I added an extra 1/4 c. of oil to make it less vinegary, about 3/4c. shredded mozzarella and about a 1/4 c. of grated parmesean (pecorino-romano). It seemed like it would be such a good recipe, but just didn't do it for us. With the modifications it was better.

I prepared this pretty much to the letter.  It was delicious and easy to make.  My husband, who usually won't eat anything that has green stuff in it had seconds.  I would make this again.

I made some minor changes and this still turned out really well.  It was super easy also!  I used quinoa (prepare 1 cup quinoa in 2 cups broth), regular vine-ripe tomatoes (not plum or cherry as the recipe states), and maybe about 1/2 cup of green onions, and probably about 1/4 tsp or more of fresh ground black pepper.

This was so incredibly easy - even a cave man could do it!  Really, it was extremely simple, fast, and the best part - DELICIOUS!  The basil is great and don't be afraid to use a little more red pepper flakes - very yummy!

Followed this recipe exactly.  Made a great side dish to go along with this evenings dinner.  Next time I think I will try with bal. vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar.  I did not have the green onions so used chopped red onion in its place.  Thank you for sharing.

Very easy to make.  I used regular cous cous and all roma tomatoes.  Brocolli and pine nuts were a great addition. Not adding the crushed peppers and using dried basil still made this a fav of my family!

I used vegetable stock instead and cut the vinegar in half since my husband doesn't like it much. All in all it was a pretty good recipe.

YUM!  Tastes so good and is so easy!  It's great to see a non-mayo based recipe.  Followed instructions exactly but next time I will add some toasted pine nuts to make it over-the-top.

I loved this! I didn't have a few of the ingredients on hand(green onions, red pepper flakes, or cherry tomatoes) but it was still great. I used about half of the amount of red vinegar called for just so it wouldnt be over bearing (as I read in some reviews). Definitely making this again.

Wow this was good. We ate it hot when I made it and then had it cold leftover. I had bulk cous cous so I used 2 cups. I doubled the tomatoes because we really like tomatoes. Excellent and easy!

Had an outdoor dinner with neighbors and family. Served this dish as a side. It went over very well with many compliments. I would definitely serve it again, especially considering prep is quick.

This was nice but I found it just a bit vinegary and maybe a bit too moist.  Next time I will cut down on the vinegar and add a bit more couscous to broth

This is super easy and amazing flavor! I haven't had anyone dislike.  I also used quinoa instead of couscous and it was as good, if not better.  It had a slightly crunchy texture.  Also used veggie broth instead of chicken for my vegetarian friends.

I used 1/4 cup of olive oil, halved the vinegar and used balsamic, and added a 1 1/2 tsp of garlic.  YUM.  Every vegetable was fresh from the garden.

This is excellent. I made it on the weekend. Just the right amount of spiciness.  I will definitely make this again. I made this a second time and it was just as good. Be careful adding the hot pepper flakes, it is easy to go overboard.  This is one of my new favorites.

I loved this.  Very easy.  Israeli couscous works much better than regular, small grain couscous.  I added some pea and yellow tomatoes for color and flavor.  Will definitely make again.

This was easy to make ahead and serve outside despite 100 degree temps. Make sure to get Israeli or Pearled couscous. I made this the day before and used less vinegar than called for based on other reviews. I also recommend adding the basil right before serving. My basil ended up pretty ugly after 24 hours.  

I also added some seeded cucumbers to help with make is more refreshing.

This is a great, easy recipe!

I used balsamic vinegar, all cherry tomatoes, added cucumbers, and roasted garlic (because i put garlic in everything!).  I also bought a rotisserie chicken and added which made for a very satisfying meal!

If you add cucumbers - they do look little weathered the second day though still had crunch.  Luckily there wasn't much left over the second day!

Made just the way it was written and my family loved it!  Light, refreshing, full of flavor! Maybe added a little more fresh basil.  Thanks for sharing

This was delicious.  After reading the reviews, I did modify the amount of vinegar and used both red wine and balsamic.  I also shredded fresh parmesan cheese over it.  I could eat the whole bowl myself.

Really tasty! So quick and easy. I think next time I'll either add a little more couscous or a little less vinegar. Had a really nice fresh taste to it. Will makes it lots more!

Excellent! I loved it, and so did my husband. I added chicken pieces to it and made it our "main dish" for dinner. I will definitely make this again.
