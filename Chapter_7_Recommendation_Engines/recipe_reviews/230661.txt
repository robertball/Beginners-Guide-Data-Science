I liked this recipe. I used flavorful homemade shredded chicken and added canned corn and olives to the chicken-cheese-mayo mix. I also sprinkled both mozzarella and cheddar cheeses on top. The only thing I didn't like was how uncooked the bell-peppers were. If I repeated the recipe I would cook them a little before adding filling and baking. Makes a good meal if you cook some Spanish rice to go along with it.

This is excellent and fits the happy hormones diet! My husband and mom both loved it and said it could be a weekly dinner. I did paraboil the peppers (and used a variety of colors).  Very pretty presentation. I dressed it with not only the sour cream, but also a scoop of salsa. Yummy!

Good basic recipe to start with.  Five stars with my revisions. I combined the chicken with a can of corn, a can of diced greed chilies, finely diced onion, a can of sliced olives, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, the bunch of cilantro, some lemon pepper, cayenne and stuffed them into red bell peppers. No mayo. I baked them at 375 for 30 minutes covered. I removed them and topped them with some shredded pepper jack cheese and returned them to the oven to melt the cheese. Delicious. Next time I will add a can of Rotel tomatoes and a little more cheddar. UPDATE: I made these again tonight with left-over turkey. This time I added the Rotel tomatoes, 3 cloves of garlic and also 2 cups of cottage cheese as well as 2 cups of cheddar this time. After baking, I topped them with sour cream and diced avocado. Wonderful.

I would have to say that I really liked this recipe. It was different and I like different. I did add chopped fresh spinach and grated parmesan and romano cheese to mine. I am a cheese fanatic! So more cheese makes a dish sing. I was sure to parboil the peppers for about 8 minutes before stuffing them so they would be nice and tender with just a little crunch. You could also microwave the peppers for about 
3 minutes to soften them. I also baked mine covered at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and an additional 10 minutes uncovered. I am going to eat the rest with a marinara sauce and see how that taste, which shall be fabulous. I say try it and watch how much you will enjoy it.

My family liked it. I mixed the sour cream in with the mayo. May have added a bit too much dried cilantro though (store didn't have fresh). It was yummy though

All I could taste was mayonnaise! My husband liked it when he put a lot of hot sauce on top of it instead of the sour cream. For me it's just runny mayonnaise and our daughter didn't like it either.

I only gave this four stars because I would have liked the Peters to be a little softer. I will have to cook a little longer next time I make them. other than that I thought this was a great dish.

I loved the recipe!!  Itâ€™s a GREAT platform to add your own twist. I added some leftover cilantro rice, omitted the mayo in and added green enchilada sauce and sour cream, along with the shredded Mexican cheese, to make the sauce for my cubed chicken (chicken thighs and breast). I baked the peppers in the oven for 20 minutes before filling them at 375 degrees, so they would be tender. Thank you for a great recipe!!!

These were amazing!  Great flavors that combine wonderfully. The only change I made was to add corn as someone had suggested.  I forgot the sour cream altogether and didn't miss it at all.  So so so good!

This was very good!! I made it even easier by using a rotisserie chicken which adds great flavor too! I also added green onion and finished with fresh salsa. I will definitely make this again!

I added salsa, a pack of fajitas seasoning, mrs. Dash fiesta lime, onions, and cilantro to the mix and it came out great.  I would definitely boil for 8 minutes before stuffing them.

I didn't add the mayo or sour cream to the mixture.   I seasoned the chicken with goya con Culantro Y anchote.  Mixed cubed chicken with LA preffereda Spanish rich, cilantro,  and Chihuahua cheese.   If you want your peppers soft definitely pre boil them.  For crispy I'd bake 15-20 to heat thoroughly.  Topped with more cheese and cilantro before baking and a dollop of sour cream before eating.   Peppers where crisp but I think it complemented the flavors.  I liked it and will make it again.

Very tasty. I modified the recipe just a little:  I used left over rotisserie chicken, added a can of corn and black olives to the cheese-chicken-mayo mix, used cheddar to mix with mozzarella for topping and added a scoop of salsa to top when severed.  My husband and I enjoyed them, but the kids preferred the mixture without the pepper.

The kids loved the filling although they were not crazy about the peppers.  I liked the combo.  I used cubanella peppers which required a slightly longer cooking time so they weren't crunchy.  I omitted the sour cream.  There was enough flavor w/o.  I used cilantro paste because the grocery store was out of fresh.  The paste had sea salt which was necessary for flavor.

DELICIOUS! Make this recipe. You wont be disappointed. The only thing that I add was salt & pepper to the mix.(step 2).
