It is great got the make again from both kid and husband. I used canola oil, fresh garlic and Dijon mustard as my sub ingredients just didn't have the other (except I always use fresh garlic when I can even though I have garlic powder). I added salt cause the garlic salt wasn't used. Made a basic salad for it.

This is for the dressing only because we did not have spinach (only arugula) or mushrooms.  My hubby is the one I made this for, and he liked it.  I made it as written but in a smaller portion.  In the very end I added a little more sour cream and then topped his salad with parmesan.  He said he'd want this again!  Thanks, LAM!

I halved the recipe because I have not had good luck with homemade dressings before, and I didn’t want to waste ingredients—but this is a winner!! I did sub olive oil for the vegetable/canola and I used light sour cream, but otherwise followed the recipe. So good!!
