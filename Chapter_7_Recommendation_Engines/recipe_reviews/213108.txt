This was fantastic!   I used quite a bit more gouda than the recipe because I had it and a red pepper instead of green (red was curiously less expensive than the green).   And of course, it took me a bit longer than 50 minutes to get it finished.  Maybe I'm a slow veggie chopper.  Worth the work and I will definitely make this one again!

Used Mozzerella because I didn't have gouda.  Substitutted some veggies to use what I had on hand, threw in asparagus - EVERYONE loved!  Small picky children included.  Leftovers great too.

We enjoyed this... healthy and tasty.  I can't wait to try it with fresh herbs and veggies from the garden this summer. The whole wheat pasta goes very well with this dish and the smoked gouda is a must, I wouldn't replace it with anything else!  Thanks for sharing.

Loved it!  I absolutely love many varieties of cheese, so the smoked gouda caught my eye!  The wonderful assortment of fresh veggies  simmered in the chicken broth with simple, but flavourful spices makes this a winning combo, even better served over whole wheat pasta!  The smoked gouda and fresh parmesan adds a whole new dimension of flavours...excellent!  A repeat dish for sure!

Enjoyed this recipe and can see that using most any vegetables you like would be good.  I added olives and will probably not use the bell pepper next time- and there WILL be a next time.

I always substitute extra garlic for onions because I'm allergic to onions.  I also put in the broccoli slaw in a bag from the grocery to add more veggies.  The whole thing turned out wonderful, & my family asked me to be sure & make it again!!

I served this a my bff for dinner. We both had been eating a little too rich for a few days, so I was looking for a hearty but lighter meal. This was awesome I made some minor changes; added Asparagus, used fresh herbs subbed feta for the gouda and added a dash of white wine.  Great meal and tons of veggies.

Just made this dish and it turned out wonderful!  I loved the mixture of all of the veggies.  It is just my husband and I, so I cut the recipe in half.  We have enough leftover to eat this dish a couple more times. I also swapped the penne pasta for bowtie,  This was a winner, will be making this again.

LOVED IT! I added lots of gouda & parm cheeses since I like cheese so much - it really added to the flavor! I didn't add ALL the cooked vegs to the pasta, instead I froze a container full to repeat the recipe another time. I'm glad I did that!

Sooo Good! Ive always made pasta with veggies but this recipe improved it  a whole bunch by adding the smoked Gouda. Dont cheat yourself by using any other kind of cheese. The Gouda is a must.

WOW! I added broccoli and used red and yellow pepper, as well as asparagus. My 2 year old ate it with a fork and her hand at the same time she could not get enough in her mouth (normally she will NOT eat funky looking things :) We all loved it and can't wait to have our friends and family try it too!

Nice twist on primavera - i stirred in the gouda while the pasta was still warm & added the parmasean to the individual dishes.  I would count on using significantly more parmasean, otherwise the dish needs salt.

I really didn't  like this recipe and neither did my BF. I don't know what it was about it that I didn't like...but it was sort of bland and not really liking the smoked gouda flavor. It made a HUGE pot too and feel bad throwing it away, so will try to give it away to friends or family in hopes of someone liking it.

I found this recipe to be very bland. The only change I made was I used red bell pepper instead of green Pepper. Only because Green pepper does not agree with us. I gave this 2 stars because my husband thought it was "okey". I will not make this again.

I definitely deviated from the original, and consequently made it unhealthy, but it was so delicious! I added squash and zucchini, but the main difference was instead of topping with cheese, I made a sauce. I took the chicken broth and boiled it in a separate pot. I then added a slurry of 2 tbsp cornstarch and a cup and a half of milk. Once that started to thicken, I added in a cup and a half of the smoked gouda. Definitely not as healthy as the original, but I will be making this again!

Very good. Don't skip the gouda - definitely makes the dish. I only used a little to sprinkle on top, and it was fabulous (I layered some mozzarella underneath the pasta in a serving dish and let it melt from the heat of the pasta and sauce). Added some chopped broccoli because I needed to use it up, and got the Italian style stewed tomatoes. Used double the garlic and used fresh basil instead of dried. I have to say, it didn't look terribly appealing, but tasted great!

Fantastic recipe with tons of veggies.  I'm not a huge pasta fan but this was great. Next time I'd reduce the pasta by 25%, add a few more mushrooms, drain the stewed tomatoes before adding them, and reduce cooking time on the noodles by 3min to ensure their al dente once cooking is complete.  Really recommend this recipe!

I normally don't care for pasta primavera much, but this batch disappeared!  It's a healthy way to enjoy pasta, for sure!  I like larger chunks of vegetables, because when the diced ones cook down they get mushy.  So I chopped the veggies instead and added a tad more gouda.  I think parsley's worthless, so I didn't add that.  The red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick!  I'll add more next time.  Wonderful!

Made this after a family workout and everyone loved it. The smoked Gouda "makes this" dish. Makes awesome leftovers too. Will definetly continue this easy healthy recipe. I'm on Weight Watchers and I calculated it to be only 8 points. Thanks!

This was good, but considering I spent $8.00 on smoked gouda...it would have had to be extra special for me to make it again. Nothing out of this world...just...good.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was great.  I substituted with what I had on hand (veggie stock, smoked mozzarella, diced tomatoes with green chilis, bow-tie pasta).  My 8-year-old found the dish a bit spicy but still loved it.  I look forward to making this dish again with the smoked gouda.

This was delicious, we omitted the mushrooms and added some red pepper and jalapeno peppers.

WOW!  This was fantastic!  I've never had Pasta Primavera before so I can't compare this with anything else, but this will be a keeper!  I had leftover bowtie pasta that I used, and I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  I loved the kick from the red pepper spices.   My only regret was that I halved the recipe instead of making the whole thing!

This is an amazing dish that can be so adaptable! The only thing I changed was sub the zucchini for asparagus...only because I do not like zucchini...This recipe is LOW-fat and SO Yummy! (well, low-fat if you watch how much cheese you put on top!) I scaled the recipe down to 2 and used about 1/2 tsp fresh grated parmesan and about 2 tsp fresh grated smoked gouda - this is the KEY, you MUST use the smoked gouda! the flavour combination is fantastic and you get a wee bit of heat from the red pepper flakes! EXCELLENT recipe! will be making this Sunday for my Vegatarian daughter when she comes to dinner (sans mushrooms...only veggie she will not eat!) LOL! Thanks for the great recipe!

We thought this was great! I'm not a big pasta person, but the veggies really brought this dish to life as did the smoked gouda. This will be on regular rotation at our house, what a great healthy recipe. Next time I think we'll add chicken just for a different spin.

Hubby complained about no meat but still enjoyed this dish. There was just enough "heat" for our liking. The smoked gouda definetly made this dish very nice.

This recipe was AWESOME! You can basically throw any veggies you want into this, but I loved the zucchini and wouldn't do without that! My boyfriend absolutely loved the smoked gouda topping. We couldn't get enough of this!!!

I was a bit sceptical about how this would taste while it was on the stove but after my wife and I finished our second helping we were both very pleased with the oucome. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tspn salt. this will be a welcome addition to my supper recipe lineup.

Fabulous! My favorite recipe by far. I did use white pasta because I am not a fan of wheat, but the flavor was delicious! I've also made it adding diced chicken breast; very good as well! But do not change anything else in this one.

Tasty and healthy - the smoked gouda is inspired!  I never would have thought to put that on pasta.  The flavor is four-star, minus one star because I had some problems with the recipe itself; for one thing, it doesn't specify whether the tomatoes should be drained or not.  (I chose not to and would probably do so again.)  For another, three onions is a mega-huge lot of onions -- but maybe my onions were just big.  I only used two because I only had two, and it was plenty.  I also added a big pinch of salt and more parm than was called for (two tablespoons for a pound of pasta isn't much).  We'll probably make this again - thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing .. a definite keeper .. you can add any veggies you choose and it willl still be awesome.  I made the recipe as is except I added a few chicken bouillon cubes to the "sauce" for a little extra flavoring.  Thanks for a super supper recipe!!!

I am sure this wouild just as good following directions but found this and worked with what I had.  Actually made 2 pans, one for vegetarian daughter since I added bite sized chicken to ours.  Was going to make hers strictly veggies but she requested the morning star "chicken" in  hers. Used vegetable broth in place of chicken broth in both.  Used diced tomates with basil and oregano in place of stewed tomatoes and didn't have Gouda so used shredded Fiesta blend cheese and kept on low heat covered until cheese melted and served over bow tie pasta.  Enjoyed by all!

The pasta sauce tasted fresh and good but it was ruined by the cheese. Far too much cheese in this recipe made the pasta too sticky and unless you got a chunk of tomato/carrot ect in the bite all you tasted was gouda! and i like gouda. made it again with 1/3 cup gouda and 1.5 cans of tomatos and it was a lot better.

I left out the chicken broth.  There was enough water/fluid in the veggies - I as afraid it would be too soupy.  I sprinkled in a little flour to thicken the broth. Excellent and healthy, we will feast on this for days.

YUM!!  So this was absolutely simple, easy, healthy and tasty!  I was looking for a way to use up some veggies and this was perfect.  The only changes I made was I used a red and orange pepper and added broccoli because that's what I had on hand.  I also used veg broth since my hubby is a vegetarian.  I love Gouda but didn't have any on hand so used a braid of marinated mozzarella that I diced up.  Even though I made changes I don't think it changed the integrity of the dish so I still gave it 5 stars.  What's nice about this dish is that you can sub different veggies or the cheese for that matter. The mozzarella I used was from Trader Joes and being that it was marinated in olive oil, red pepper flakes, and oregano it really enhanced this pasta.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is truly a fantastic, healthy and easy dish to make!  The only things I changed were to decrease the onion and only use one, also used diced fire-roasted tomatoes undrained, and a bit extra smoked gouda.  So delicious!

this is an awesome recipe, i made it for me and my 3year old son and he ate every bit. The only revisions i made was to use Italian Seasoning instead of the parsley, basil, and oregano.  I also addedd some italian sausage i had on hand. The only thing i can think of that could make this recipes better is to add a little more garlic. oh and also i used mozzarellla instead of gouda...i'm from a small town and gouda was hard to find. but overall delicious.

The smoked Gouda cheese is the magic ingredient that makes this dish so special.  I was about to give up on wholewheat pasta, because it has never failed to disappoint me, but loved it in this combination!  I added half a tin of chick peas and a piece of butternut pumpkin that needed to be used up.  Delicious!  Thanks, SKoeneman, for a healthy, delicious recipe.

This is a very good recipe.  I made it almost exactly as stated. I needed to omit the onion and substitute petite diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes, since I can't eat onions.  I still thought it was great.  Thanks.

This is a good, healthy recipe, though I'm not a fan of carrots in pasta. I would probably double the mushrooms and cut the carrots next time. I also had to double the spices + salt and pepper for flavor.

Nope, won't do it again.  Granted I did make a couple pretty minor changes -- used Rotels instead of crushed red pepper, more seasoning, added salt, shrimp and a touch of lemon -- but nothing too drastic.  It just didn't have much flavor at all, least of all smoked gouda, and mushy veggies are NOT my thing.  Would definitely not use squash and zuke again.

Followed directions exactly.  Felt it was on the bland/boring side.  Family ate it.  I think I'll keep this recipe around and try it again with some smoked salmon.

Excellent dish!  Great way to get some vegies and the smoked Gouda really sets this dish apart.  I followed the ingredients list exactly but changed the order just a bit:  First, I sauted the garlic in the olive oil then added the zucchini, bell pepper, carrots and onion.  The stewed tomatoes and mushrooms went in at the same time. A keeper!

This was a great tasting easy meal!  Everyone loved this, me personally does not like anything hot in the least so next time I make this I will leave out the red pepper, and that is the only thing I would change. Easy to make. The Gouda cheese is just the right touch for this!

Excellent!  The only thing I changed was the amount of pasta.  I used a full box of the Barilla whole wheat penne pasta which is just over 13 oz.  It went well with a chardonnay, sour dough bread, and apple pie.

Makes A LOT!  Really, really good, just not spectacular (like it needed something else to put it over the top).  Great as a leftover, though.

Finally tried it and LOVED it, a wonderfully tasty and healthy meal. I doubled up on the zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes and used 1 red and 1 green bell pepper. With that it was just right for 6 servings. As a vegetarian I always try to get at least 2 - 3 servings of veggies per meal. Adjust the seasonings and cheeses accordingly. I used Italian seasoning mix and towards the end added fresh basil and oregano from my herb garden.
Thanks so much for this recipe, it's definitely on my favorites list.

Very great recipe overall. However the vegetable to pasta ratio was a little over powering to my guests (I, however love vegetables and thought it tasted great). Next time I will try to use just one zuccini or maybe two small ones. The Gouda cheese was a great touch and I used much more than the recipe called for. Same with the red pepper flakes. I also added a little parmesan cheese to the pot towards the end instead of just placing in on top. This recipe turned out great! I LOVED it.

I thought it was good, but nothing spectacular.  My husband, on the other hand, thinks it's really delicious.  And I love that he loves it, since it's sometimes a struggle to get him to eat healthily!  Really simple to make, just takes a long time to do all the chopping.  You could use basically any vegetables, but this is a good combination.  Although it wasn't out-of-the-park tasty for ME, I'll make it again and again because it's relatively low-calorie, healthy, but doesn't feel like it is.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.

My husband suggested I make this for my health nut mother-in-law for Mother's Day, and she was impressed.

My husband and I are NOT veggie lovers, but this recipe is so tasty!  I did add shrimp cause I didn't think my husband would eat just veggies but he said I didn't have to add them, which was a shock to my system.

I made this tonight. It's very easy if you're a fast chopper. I used the recipe as is with a little fewer veggies and it still made a huge amount. The gouda adds a great flavor to give it sort of a gourmet taste. Easy/Good/kids ate it

My husband, the meat eater, had 3rds!!! I used onions, mushrooms, zucchini, yellow squash, asparagus and fresh tomatoes. I'm not a fan of smoke gouda so I used chipotle gouda instead. It was AMAZING!!!! I actually made a 1/2 recipe as a side dish for our dinner and this primavera was the only thing we didn't have leftovers of! I'm definitely making this again.

This was spectacular!!!  For some reason, I thought it would be good but nothing special and I was pleasantly surprised.  I don't measure things but followed the recipe almost to a T.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and a little less gouda since the smoked gouda has a lot of flavor, I felt I could cut some.  We added some shrimp and scallops at the end.  SO GOOD!!!!

My  rating is based on the recipe which is very yummy as is.   I would just go a little easier on the red pepper flakes as they tend to dominate the taste.  But over all fantastic dish! Update: I have made this recipe many times now and I only use half the penne.  I like the veggie/pasta ratio better that way. I also will add a splash of white wine with the chicken broth. When I serve it, I get rave reviews. So thanks!!

Sooooooo good! With this dish, eating veggies is so much more enjoyable. I usually have to remind myself how good vegetables are for me before I choke them down, but with this recipe, I felt like I was really treating myself! I used 2 bouillon cubes instead of the chicken broth. I also added the liquid from the can of stewed tomatoes (not sure if that was part of the recipe, but I feel like it added some great flavor)! The smoked Gouda was oh so good! I did use more than the recipe called for but was happy I did! This recipe is unique and definitely worth trying!

This recipe was sooooo yummy! Easy to make so I had my 8 year old help me and he loved it! I only tweaked a couple of things. I like a thicker sauce so I added about 1/4 c. spaghetti sauce. I also changed this recipe to make 6 servings thinking we would have a small amount of leftovers, but there are TONS left over. I don't know if we will be able to finish it. I am also always looking for ways to use linguica, so I cut some of that up and added it. It was beyond good! While my 2 year old wouldn't touch it (she won't touch veggies), my 8 year old raved about it!!!

I loved the flavour from the smoked gouda. I am not sure how much red pepper flakes I used (i just pinched some and added it). I will probably watch how much I put in next time becasue it was little on the spicy side (especially for my 2yr old, but my 1 and 3yr olds loved it).

Fantastic.  I made it with red peppers subbed for the green, and half of the red pepper flakes called for (my family likes less heat.)  The only problem was that it never thickened up at all for me, but that just gave me a broth to dip the Italian bread in!  The smoked Gouda was an unexpected flavor that really brought it all together.  I will definitely make this again.  Chocked full of veggies, and my kids inhaled it!!

Awesome recipe! Used broccoli instead of bell peppers and only used one onion. We will definitely make this one again.

Made this and can't wait to make it again. The smoked Gouda is the star--it makes every bite more delicious. It made a lot, but somehow my family (4) managed to finish in two days. Did not change anything, although I might try with plain tomatoes (not stewed) next time.

Wanted to like this one, but honestly, lacked taste. First of all, way way too many onions. There were a ton of veggies which was great, but even doubling up on the garlic didn't help the taste. It was just...bland. Followed the recipe otherwise. Could have used some more tomatoes or...something. I also added more cheese than it said and topped with some fresh basil. I would def use the smoked cheese, that was just about the only detectable taste in the dish. My non-picky eaters wouldn't touch it, and good if you like the recipe, bad if you didn't, there are a ton of leftovers. Easily made 12 servings. Like I said, just way too many onions, and not enough flavor. Boo.

I do not normally review the recipes on here, but use them all the time.  I thought I would say that I loved this recipe.  very fresh and yummy.  loved the veggies, loved the gouda.  I added some fresh rosemary and used fire roasted tomatoes.  used a whole small block of gouda.  very good.  will make again.  kids ate it well.

Made as directed in recipe.   Excellent dish.   The finish with fresh grated cheeses is what gives the the full flavor and is a must.  The more the better.

Only used 1 onion and just a sprinkle of pepper flakes because of my toddler and it was still yummy. Use a very large skillet- had to dirty two pans because didn’t realize this at first.

This was good, my 23 mo old ate it up. What helped is cuttin the zucchini & mushrooms the same size, I shredded the carrots & make them the same size as the onions. I used quinoa pasta bc I had a bunch left over that needed to be used. The only thing I did differently was omit the peppers & bc I didn’t have n e. To me, it was essentially a vegged up spaghetti sauce. Had I noticed, idda used my Italian spaghetti recipe & just added the veggies the same. Thnx.

It was ok. I come from an Italian family so maybe this dish was to American for me.  It's not sauce based but rather broth based which I didn't realize it was going to be so brothy after it was said and done. With that, it made it more like a soup with noodles and veggies in it.

This was awesome!!! I will be making this again with some adjustments.
I'll double or triple the tomato, I'll reduce the pasta, I'll definitely add more crushed red pepper. I'm not a huge fan of oils, so I used half the evoo that was called for. I doubled all of the spices, and cooked the veggies with the garlic and spices about 10 minutes prior to adding the tomato and parsley mixture. 
Also for the look, I'll probably add some red bell pepper. So very good, amazing flavor. Just be aware, this makes A LOT of food!

Was very good! I did however reduce the onion and garlic by 1/3. There is no way it needs that much garlic and onion in the dish. my toddler wouldn't even eat it with the amount I put in. Other than that pretty good. You don't really need the smoked gouda in my opinion. It would have been better with just a ton of parmesean cheese.

Pretty tasty!  Mixed votes for whether this was better or worse than homemade spaghetti.  I made a few changes: omitted zucchini;  1/2 onion instead of 3;  red pepper instead of green; doubled red pepper flakes & smoked gouda; added thyme & half a can of tomato paste to thicken.

This turned out to be even better than I had hoped. I did tweak the recipe a bit though by adding diced chicken for a bit more protein. Altogether it came out great and served my family well for lunch for the week (I generally cook a big meal like this one on Sunday and we eat it for lunches through the week).

Not only does it taste great but it's packed with some many vegetables that it's certainly a huge meal all on its own. 

Thanks for the recipe and I look forward to making it again!

Good recipe as written. I'm enamored w/ my own cooking sometimes...and this is one of those times. I added chicken, using a BBQ rub from World Spice...searing it then baking for awhile. Turned out flavorful and moist. I used all the called for veggies, using a yellow pepper since it's sweeter than a green one. I added some of the chicken juices and a whole can of tomato's for half a recipe. Later added some pasta water and finished the pasta off in the simmering veggies and sauce. I added way more smoked Gouda and a generous Parm/Regg. Topped it w/ Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese and baked it at 300 degrees for 20 minutes.

It's amazing! Only thing I would do different would be to leave out the carrot, that's just personal preference though.

Recipe was not only delicious but also nutritious. Only problem we had was it needed salt. Next time I will use regular chicken broth instead of the low-sodium. Was simple didn't take a lot of time and presents very well.

I haven't made this yet but intend to, substituting red pepper for green because green does not agree with us.  It's still a pepper.  Wish people would rate it using the listed ingredients.  I'm not looking to make huge changes.  Small changes are requested.

Yummy!  I added salt and pepper to taste.  I had trouble shredding the gouda, so I cut into small chunks which was nice because it created little pockets of cheese.  I only used 1 onion which was plenty.

I don't  like smoked cheese so added more regular Gouda.  It was good but way too bland.  I will try to tweek it using some other cheese maybe.

This is a favorite at my house.  The smoked gouda makes the meal.  My daughters and son ate all the vegetables mixed in the with the pasta.  I would recommend using less pasta, otherwise an A plus recipe.

This was OK, but admittedly I tasted it as it was cooking and added the much needed salt and pepper; also had to add more tomatoes. As written, this was not a good recipe. With moderations, it's still not a keeper.

Yummy flavors with just enough smoky overtones and I usually do not care for smoky flavoring.  I have this as a good go-to recipe for a quick dinner.  Husband loves it

Delicious! Add whatever veggies you need to use from the garden. Go easy on the oregano. I only used 1 onion and 1 leek. Used fresh basil-be generous with is as it's not as strong as dried. Gouda is good but don't add too much or it will overpower your delicious concoction!

Didn't use bell pepper. Used less chicken broth.
