This was soooo good!I was hesitant to try this recipe as it had such an unusual mix of ingredients, but boy it is a keeper!  I followed the directions/ingredients exactly except for instead of 3C of m/jack, I used 2 cups of Mozzarella. It was great. I served it with fresh sweet corn and a side of cottage cheese.

This was pretty good, pretty unique, but it wasn't a new family favorite.
