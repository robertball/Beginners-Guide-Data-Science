I make this often and the only things that I do differently are that I add a tsp. of Vanilla and scrape the sides of the food processor down a few times during blending. I also refreeze after blending (otherwise it melts too fast).  I love to make it as a Banana Split version by adding any (or all :-) of the following: chopped Cherries, Strawberries, Nuts, Pineapple and mini semi-sweet Chocolate Chips. (Stirred in by hand after blending the bananas.) Yummy. Also, if you make it with more than 2 bananas it is harder to get it to blend.

I have a high powered blender and I could not get the frozen bananas to blend. I used the stick it comes with to push the bananas down into the blade--they would crush a bit then get stuck, so I had to add a little milk just to get things moving. Perhaps it would work better in a food processor? Next time I would add the bananas partially frozen (so they are not hard as a rock!) and blend that way then re-freeze. I added a spoonful of unsweetened cocoa powder and the kids said it tasted like a Frosty from Wendy's! :)

Whipped Banana Ice Cream Haiku: "Great 'dessert' for kids. I re-froze after blending, so it'd be more firm." Used 1 banana and ran thru the mini-cuisinart, scraping the edges down b/t pulses. It got to the texture of soft-serve ("Magic!" declared my eldest daughter, while the baby adored the 1st lick of the spoon) and I put it back into the air-tight container where I'd originally had the frozen bananas. Just as the cook's notes indicate, mix-ins possibilities are endless. With the simplicity of its single ingredient, it's wonderful, but I've made it again w/ a little vanilla extract, chocolate chips and Nutella. /swoon.

As mom to a toddler, this is practically a perfect recipe!  It's one ingredient, and takes just minutes!  Whipped it up with the processor attachment for my stick blender.  I almost always have bananas in the freezer anyhow because my tot eats just half with her breakfast.  She loved having "Banana Swirl" just like on her favorite show, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood!  I love that she gets 'ice cream' with only natural fruit sugars.  Win-win!

I used 4 bananas and add 2 tablespoons of yogurt to make it extra creamy. It turned out excellent.

Had some frozen banana pieces so decided to try this recipe.  Excellent results.  It took a fairly long time to break down the bananas as they were hard as rocks, but worth the time spent scraping the sides down and pulsing until light and fluffy.  I added a large spoon of peanut butter and topped with chocolate sauce.

I tried another recipe that called for milk, and it was like a smoothie. All you really need are the frozen bananas. The directions should indicate to scrape the sides down a couple times. It's a refreshing, healthy treat.

It tastes great.  We like more mushrooms so we doubled those and also added in onion which the mushrooms.  This is a definite save for later.  Also could recreate the mushroom gravy for all kinds of other meats.

Been wanting to try this out for so long! I love the creamy frozen texture the bananas give you. I did 1 1/2 bananas and it was so filling!

Definitely a winner!  Freezing whole RIPE bananas make the best popsicles, way better than anything store bought.

Wow!  I was unsure of how much this would actually taste like ice cream and I was pleasantly surprised!  My fiance even liked it.  Although we both like bananas, I added vanilla extract and some peanut butter for add oomph.  Amazing!  When its warm its like soft serve ice cream.  Next time I'm adding mini chocolate chips!!

It tasted just like bananas, so I just added almond milk, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. It made it taste much better and kind of like yogurt!

Well, over all pretty good recipe.When I was blending it I put some whole milk in and, put the frozen bananas in a little at a time. Also I suggest to freeze the Blended frozen bananas over night. If you want to make it fancier melt chocolate with some oil, than put it over The bananas and freeze for ten minutes than you will have a chocolate shell.

I added a little vanilla extract.  Orange extract is good, too!
