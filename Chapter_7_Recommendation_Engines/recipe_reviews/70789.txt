I had leftover canned baby peas and fresh mushrooms. (don't like jarred) I do eat rather unusual things for lunch, so once I combined the ingredients, which included garlic and onion powders, I spooned this over low fat cottage cheese. YUM and thanks Aroel!

This was pretty good. I don't like canned vegetables so I used frozen peas and freshly sliced mushrooms. I sauteed them in a pan with some onion and garlic, and mixed in some Tapatio hot sauce at the end.
