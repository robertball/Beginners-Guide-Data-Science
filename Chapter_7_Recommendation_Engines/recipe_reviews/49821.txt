I took this cookie one step further and made a glaze for it (2 c.powdered sugar, 1 tbls. of butter, 1 1/2 tsp. pure almond extract and 2 1/2 tbls. of low fat french vanilla coffemate) I topped with chopped almonds.  They are so good this way.  I have also included a picture of the finished cookie.  ENJOY

Should be called almond shortbread.... After baking about 22 dozen cookies in two days I ended by trying this recipe. I didn't even want to see another cookie by this point!  But the smell was lovely and the taste amazing.  This is THE shortbread.  There is none better.
I did roll the dough into a log and after refrigerating for several hours I sliced into cookies.  Much easier than rolling out and cutting with a cookie cutter. I also used about 1 1/2 tbsp of almond extract for a little bolder almond flavor. This is a super simple recipe to make.

These are a delicious cookie.  I did add a bit more almond extract.  My family loves the shortbread texture.

I did exactly as directions told me to. I put  in fridge overnight. Why is it just crumbles and no dough? What holds it together? There is no way to drop that onto cookie sheet by spoonful. Was something liquid left out of ingredient list?

I got just under 6 dozen 3 inch cookies from this recipe.  I also put in 3 tablespoons almond extract and they turned out delicious. But if you're like me and like your almond cookies strong you could easily put 5 tblspoons in no problem. Thats what Im doing next time.   A toasted almond in the center is most decadent.  I don't think it needs frosting at all as long as you really turn up the  extract.  I will make these again and Im not the biggest fan of baking.

Mmmmm delicious almond cookies. I added the extra almond extract, and then while the butter and sugar were creaming, I poured in about a cup of sliced almonds. A sliver of toasted almond topped each one. Definitely a keeper!

Very good. More an almond shortbread than a cookie. I used the glaze recipe suggested by one reviewer (Linda, I believe) and they were close to the Voortman Almonette cookies that my husband loves. In the future, I'm going to roll dough into log in wax paper and then put in fridge.  The dough is very hard when coming out of fridge, making it very difficult to 'drop by teaspoonfuls' so I'm going to treat as an icebox cookie. That way you can slice the dough into circles instead of using the bottom of a glass to squash.  It'll save time that way.

Yummy! I had a problem with the batter being crumbly, too. I just added more butter (1/2 to 3/4 cups). I added sliced almonds and probably left the mixer on too long as they turned out to more like finely chopped than bits, but I suppose that was a taste issue. I also just put them into golf-ball size and then made them flat with a cup. 16 minutes in the oven seemed to be the magic number for me. Will definately make this over and over again.

Absolutely fantastic! I doubled the almond extract because I really like almond flavour and it tasted just like marzipan! Very much a shortbread cookie. My only issue was that as the butter melted the cookies spread out and blended in to one another. Next time I might try using muffin tins to help keep their shape.

I made these for a party I threw this summer, they were a hit! The only thing I did was the skip the icing and just pushed almond slices in the top. The only thing I didn't like was how flat they got, but I live in an high altitude area so maybe that is why.

good, so so good.  These cookies are like nothing I have ever had.  Increased the almond extract to 2 tsp and accidently reduced the flour bu about 1/2 cup.  They turned out nice and crispy, also used real butter not margarine and cut the salt in half. try it, you will be amazed

I susbstituted 1 cup butter flavored Crisco for 1 cup of butter and used real butter for the other cup.  The only thing keping this cookie from a 5* rating is how easily this cookie crumbles.  Its like a pecan sandie, or shortbread cookie, only with the wonderful flavoring of almond. I am unsure if my substitution is the reason for the texture or if thats how it is.  At any rate, this cookie melts in your mouth with delicious good flavor and I highly recommend it.  It was the perfect ending to our chinese dinner.

I had high hopes for these cookies after reading all the wonderful reviews, but I was disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly but they were really bland.

Very tasty cookies!  Although the dough was very crumbly...I mixed it up ahead of time, put it in the fridge and it was still crumbles.  I had to press it into a ball shape and form into a cookie.  Other than that, very easy and good!  I also added 3 tsp of almond extract as suggested by others.

Okay but not worth making again.
