I usually use a different recipe (Spring biscotti) when making biscotti, but I was a bit low on butter. Looked up one that I could use oil. I used Sambuca for the flavoring, and substituted 1/2 c. Whole wheat in the flour mixture. (I always use King Arthur flour.) I chilled for only about an hour, then used a large spoon to put the batter on the cookie sheet and floured fingers to pat it into logs.  I’ll make this again, but really prefer the taste of a butter recipe. They have a nice shape and don’t crumble.
