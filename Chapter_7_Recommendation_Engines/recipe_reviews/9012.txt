A little too much butter as is but very good flavour. I make this every couple weeks as it quite cheap compared to a lot of other meals.

I was scared to try this but it was good. My husband thought I was crazy when he heard what was in it then that PEACHES were added! But we both really liked it. Pretty simple and very tasty. I give it a 4 instead of 5 because I think there's too much butter. Made the sauce kind of greasy and I just don't think a 1/4 pound (1 whole stick) is necessary so next time I'll try about half that.

My hubby and I both loved this one and it took much less time than I anticipated! I used a 1/2 the butter but it still turned out great. Use the sauce for gravy over mashed potatoes - yum!

This was really good! I didn't have a lemon on hand so I used lime and it was absolutely delicious. I think next time I will thicken the sauce after cooking. Also this would be great with diced chicken thickened sauce and served over white rice. I was impressed.:)

Was ok a little dry. It says to cook it too long and my husband thought the peaches superfluous - they were there but not really a part of the flavor.

I thought it was okay but my girl thought it was too lemony (sp) is lemony a word? I dont think I will put this one in the vault. Maybe the trash!

An interesting melange of flavors. Definitely don't skip the peaches.

Excellent tasting but I thought it called for too much butter as other reviewers noted. I used a little over a tablespoon and it was fine. I also used shallots instead of garlic and spicy mustard since I didn't have any Worchester sauce. I cooked it in the pressure cooker and it worked great! I'll make this again for sure.
