All you folks who ended up with a soup are 'stirring' and not 'folding' in the cool whip.  folding the ingredients in allows the cool whip to retain its fluff while stirring breaks it down and it becomes watery...

This recipe does not deserve a rating. What a waste of ingredients and time.  I also ended up with a soupy mess.  Do not try this one, you will be sorry.

Wow.  Wonderful recipe.  I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about.  I'm thinking that the reason the recipes didn't work out was because the baker used confectioners sugar instead of regular white granulated sugar.  With the right kind of sugar (the white granulated), this recipe is the bomb.

This was a most disappointing mess! I followed the
recipe directions exactly, and it was a total flop.
It was much too thin to frost my layer cake--it ran
off the cake as soon as I tried to frost it. However,
it did have one redeeming feature-- It did taste good.

This turned out to be a delicious filling.  I recommend using caster sugar though, and putting in a bit more dessicated coconut to make the filling a little thicker. If you use whipped cream from the can, then make sure you serve it immediately.  Everybody loved it, at home and in the office!  The filling made a professional finishing touch to my coconut flavoured cake and it took very little effort!

First, this frosting was FANTASTIC!! I changed it just a little. I made a wonderful Butter Cake--submitted by Carol. I put together about 2 cups of coconut, the sour cream, and used granulated sugar. I received one cup of it and mixed the one cup w/8 oz. of cool whip. The frosting w/out the coolwhip I used to frost my cake layers (I had made two, 8-inch rounds and cut those into two, so ended up w/four layers). It only took a thin layer. Then, the frosting w/the coolwhip I used for the sides and top. I only used about 1/2 of the frosting. WOW!!! Between the butter cake and this frosting, it was a 10! Thank you! My friends at work loved it and now everybody wants the recipe!

I was a little dubious about this recipe because of some of the negative reviews, but it sounded like it would taste good (and there were the equally enthusiastic reviews) so I decided to risk it. It worked quite well for me, but I think it is VERY IMPORTANT that the whipped topping is folded in carefully, not mixed in vigorously. I mixed together the sugar, sour cream and coconut, whipped it a bit with a hand mixer and then let it chill for an hour so before folding in the Cool Whip. After I frosted the cake (and I had quite a bit left over after frosting a 9 inch layer cake), I refrigerated it and half expected the icing to be falling off the cake next time I checked, but it was perfectly intact and remained so the next day as well. And it tastes delicious!

I thought this was excellent made with granulated sugar.  I loved and so did my family.  Keep it in the refrigerator.  Try it you'll like it.

I must agree with previous comments.  This didn't turn out at all.  I used granulated sugar and it was awful - I don't suspect powdered sugar would work any better (probably worse).  But I wonder if "sour cream" was supposed to be "cream cheese" - that would be good IMO.

What kind of "white sugar?"  I never heard of using white GRANULATED sugar in a recipe, so I used CONFECTIONER'S sugar.  All I got was a big soupy mess.  
   If you try this recipe, do not use confectioner's sugar!  I'm not about to waste another $5 by trying it with granulated sugar, but I'm pretty sure that won't work either.

Ho-Ly-Mo-Ly this stuff is the best coconut icing ever! I read the complaints and don't get it.  My mother in law made this cake for me and I was looking for a similar recipe when I came across this one . I made this according to these instructions but next time I think I will put two cups of Coconut instead of 1 1/2 to stiffen the icing a bit. A tip she gave me was to put the icing in the fridge and let it marinade for about 24 hours and it would make it a littler thicker to ice when ready. DE-Lish!

I tried this recipe and did not add all ingredients together after seeing what others had posted about the mess...I mixed the sour cream and sugar with about half the coconut and spooned some it on each layer(I had four) and then added the rest of the coconut and whipped topping to frost entire cake...that seemed to work!!

This frosting was WONDERFUL! I'm not sure what all the complaints are about.  I did change the recipe just a bit, I used: 8oz sourcream, 1c sugar, and 2 pkgs of frozen coconut, and the 8oz cool whip. It was absolutely delightful I and wanted to eat it straight from the bowl!!! Yum!  Certainly wasn't a watery mess or a waste of ingredients.  I will be making it again.

I noticed in another recipe very similar to this one, that the sour cream, coconut, sugar mixture was CHILLED before folding in the Cool Whip. Maybe the room temp of the mixture is what's breaking down the Cool Whip and making it soupy. Just a thought.

This was a big hit at my last cookout, if yours turned out runny it is because you over mixed it, cool whip does that, I doubled the coolwhip and it was perfect.

I love this recipe!! You just have to be careful that the ingredients aren't too warm (as well as the cake) as you frost it. I made a two layer cake and used it as frosting and filling. Then I sprinkled extra coconut on top for looks. I've made this numerous times for bridal showers-it's perfect when I decorate with real flowers around the edge. Everybody has raved about it. Thank you!

I find this to be a better filling than a frosting.  Probably because of the Cool Whip but it's great for a double or triple layer cake.  Also good for some whoopie pies.

This was fabulous!  I omitted the coconut because my significant other loathes it and used fat free sour cream and lite cool ship and it worked out wonderfully.  Everyone raved about the frosting and the lightness of it.  I put it on a classic white cake with a lemon curd filling and the flavors complemented each other beautifully.  I also had a ton of frosting leftover so I used it the next morning on waffles with some berries.

I used this for my son’s chocolate birthday cake. Everyone loved it! I had left over frosting and used it a couple days later as dip for strawberries. I am diabetic and only use 1/2 the sugar. A couple weeks after that, I made it again with Cool Whip Lite, half the sugar and sour cream, mixed raspberries into it and poured it into a chocolate cookie pie crust and froze it. Easy, Fast,YUM!

So, so good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  (I added the sour cream and sugar and waited 15 min to make sure sugar dissolved then added coconut) Then, FOLDed the whipped cream in, don't beat or use a mixer.   Frost on a COLD cake and make sure all the ingredients are cold.  Light, fluffy and not too sweet.

Granted, I didn't fold in my Cool Whip, but this was soupy and fell off my cupcakes.  Tastes great after adding about twice as much coconut (vain attempt to thicken it), and a little coconut extract.

Yum!  I can't believe how delicious this was and so easy to make.  This is a recipe I will be using in the future.  I agree with the reviewer who said the key is to keep everything cold and fold in the whipped topping.  Thank you for sharing.

I add 1 tablespoon vanilla flavoring and use fresh frozen coconut. I also cut the layers to make two layers out of one allowing the icing to really soak in and moisten the cake. I also refrigerate for 3 days. Yeild very moist and I'm always asked to make this for holidays, birthdays and family gatherings.

Ok I am not a beginner cook by any means. I love cooking and know how to read a recipe. This one was terrible! I was so bummed b/c I had everything in the house for this one and needed a quick frosting. It was very disappointing. It turned out to be a soupy mess. :( I used ff sour cream, ff cool whip and yes granulated sugar. A waste of ingredients. Although it did taste good.
