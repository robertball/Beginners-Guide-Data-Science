Very easy to make, quick and fun! Followed the recipe, except we used one extra jalapeno and a yellow onion instead of white. Not spicy at all, and the tomatillos added a nice flavor to the guacamole.

I halved the ingredients, leaving out the jalapeno completely.  Also added sour cream to match the portion of avocado. Tasted great.

Very tasty!  I didn't have a white onion on hand so I used a red onion. It worked very well.  We are cilantro lovers so I did add more.  Very easy to make and I love the taste, sorta in between a guacamole and a green salsa. Making again when I have some more tomatillos.  I had to have a small bowl of it before it cooled but I know it will taste even better when it is chilled.

This Tasty Tomatillo Guacamole is very good, I made it easy to make, I let the vegetables cool down before I put them in the blender, made tuna sandwich and dipped it and was very good. Will be making again.
