Naturally I have tried my own recipe... It is VERY close to the real thing! Always a hit at any festive gathering. I use 2% milk, and regular instant vanilla pudding mix- NOT french vanilla. The rum extract is the key ingredient. Experiment with the other spices to your own liking!

This is a GREAT recipe for eggnog.  I actually tried it because I had used all of the eggs making deviled eggs :)  It tastes VERY much like the store-bought eggnog that has gotten SO expensive.  It is EASY to make, and quite a hit.  I did trade a pint of whipping cream for part of the milk so that it would be thicker.  Thanks!!

We loved this!!!!  I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was just what I was looking for.  No eggs!  Now, I am not an eggnog expert but I do drink it every year and I was trying to find a healthier recipe and this was it.  I'll def make it again next year.  I'm going to try it next time with the super-skim fat free milk.

Fantastic!!!  I used 4 cups of 2% milk and a cup of half and half, only because that’s what I had on hand. Turned out great. Kids and adults love it! The rum extract is mandatory- it gives it the true egg nog flavor.

I made this without the sugar and it was a hit. I have been making it for 2 years now and love just as much now. As I did the first time.

I made it exactly as your recipe, minus the rum extract. Doesn't taste exactly like eggnog, but it's real close. Very tasty. I will make this again!

This was amazing! We were looking for a Ponche de Crème recipe and my Trinidadian Nanee gave this a big stamp of approval! Added 1/2 a shot of rum to each glass before we served it. Definitely will be making this again next Christmas

This nog came out great! A great alternative to store-bought nogs that have a lot of extra sugar and additives.  No, I don't think the instant pudding is a health food, but I think this is a less expensive and slightly healthier option than store-bought nog and it tastes great! Easy to make as well! Will use this often and especially when milk is on sale, this is a great value!  Will share this recipe with vegan friends as I'm sure it could be made with plant-based, milk-alternatives.
