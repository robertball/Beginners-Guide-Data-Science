This was a very tasty pancake.   I put applesauce and sour cream on it. It does take a bit of work, grating things up ~ SO WORTH IT!!!!!!!

5.26.16   I had some leftover mashed potatoes and a small zucchini in the fridge, did an Ingredient Search on this site, and this recipe popped up...perfect!  Even though these pancakes had shredded raw potatoes in addition to the mashed potatoes, they were a little soft, unlike a crispy traditional potato pancakes.  But that's OK because they tasted good!  I followed the recipe to the letter (well, I did add some pepper), and the only thing that I would do differently next time would be to cut the salt in half.

These are pretty tasty by themselves, no toppings. Hubby said they tasted fishy but that they were good. I added some garlic powder, Salt & Pepper, and some onion. It would probably be good with some crumbled bacon too!
