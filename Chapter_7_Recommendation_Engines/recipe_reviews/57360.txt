Found this recipe as I was looking for something to do with the 50lbs of onions that my husband brought home.  I was a bit skeptical at first, but it smelled terrific and the taste was amazing!  Very simple recipe, but great flavor!! Took it to a potluck dinner and the pan was scraped clean! My family begged me to make it again the next day because some of them didn't get it at the potluck. 
The only change I made was to use crushed Cool Ranch Doritos instead of the crackers, so that the recipe would be gluten-free.

I got this recipe from my Aunt recently and it really is simple and delicious. I doubled the recipe and I can't even describe what a hit this was with mine AND my hubby's family! The butter (use a real stick of butter not margarine!!) sour cream and parmesan cheese turns into the yummiest sauce you could imagine for vidalia onions! All I added was minced garlic, freshly ground sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Also, make sure to use a few extra crackers in the topping and mix the cracker crumbs with a little butter, Yum!

I have made this several times now. The only thing different I did, was I diced most of the onions up, put a layer of onion rings on top.   If you don't have Ritz crackers, you can use regular saltines crushed with a little melted butter. You can't tell the difference when it is baked.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this as a side dish last night with dinner and DH and I thought it was pretty good.  I did modify the orignal recipe slightly by using only 3 large onions (which was the perfect amount IMHO), I used about 15 Ritz crackers on the top; I also dotted the top of the casserole with about 1 T. of butter.  It was a good dish, but it's VERY rich, a little goes a long way!

Great easy recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine and used a tsp of garlic.  Family loved this.  Thanks for recipe.

Wow!  That's what everyone in my family said about this wonderful side dish.  It's simple to make, I always have the ingredients on hand and what seems like a simple combination of ingredients makes an absolutely delicious casserole.  I'm planning on making this for Thanksgiving and wowing the rest of the family.

A quick easy side that had the wife going back for seconds. I increased the cracker count to get a bit more crunch in the texture

Not exactly weight-watchers, but fabulous enough to make an exception.  It disappeared so quickly, there was none left for the next day!

This was just "average" for us.  A friend had made this dish at another gathering and hers was much better.  She mentioned using mayo, so her recipe must have been different.

Excellent - will win over those who claim not to like onions!  Like another reviewer, I increase number of crackers used for topping.

I didn't have Ritz, so I used potato chips.  I wanted to cook it in my toaster oven, so I used a 9 by 9 pan.  Still YUMMY!  It didn't look like it would taste this good, but it was fantastic!!!

This is my first onion casserole recipe. We loved it! I made it as called for except maybe a few extra crackers to top it. Wonderful flavor and my husband went back for seconds! It's a keeper and will make it for holiday meals too!

I had extra onions from the garden and I decided to make this.  My husband and I LOVED it!!! It had a very unique flavor and very different than most casseroles I have made.  I halved the recipe for us but next time will make the full recipe.

Great recipe! However the next time I make it I will not bake it for 30 minutes.  It was quite burned on the bottom.

I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting plain greek yogurt for the sour cream. I can't believe how sweet it turned out! Everyone loved this recipe! Delicious. I think I might try it with different cheese some time just to change it up a bit. I also used 5 Vidalias and it turned out to be not really enough for a 9x13 pan. Maybe use more onions next time? Or a smaller pan? Anyway, yum!

I've been wanting to try this for a while, and finally gave it a try tonight.  I loved the blend of flavors, and made no changes except to add some cut up green onions to the mix for color.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I would either cut way back or leave out the cracker topping entirely next time I make it, as it added little to the overall flavor of the casserole.  Great dish!!

This dish had a great rich flavor but you don't need much.  I chopped and mixed the leftovers into another casserole for added flavor.

I had been looking for a recipe very close to this one for quite some time. This was very good! I decreased the number of onions used by two and it still came out very flavorful and filling.

This a great, simple recipe!  I love it because it has no eggs or canned cream soups.  Served this with a thick, grilled chop and field peas.  Nice change from the same potato dishes!  A definite keeper!

Had a bunch of extra onions so I made this. But my butter crackers were kinda stale so I used croutons that I quickly sautéed in butter. Enjoyed it very much along with BBQ chicken breasts and a salad. The crunch is important for full enjoyment of this dish.

Took this to a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written except I used one sleeve of Ritz crackers as I like the extra topping.  Next time I will slice my onions as thin as possible, I was in a hurry and left some of them a little too thick.  Great recipe, the Vidalia onions get very sweet.

I made just as written (except used butter and a couple of extra crackers for crumbs) about three years ago for Thanksgiving dinner.  Since then my daughter has requested (DEMANDER) it for every holiday dinner since.  Since it is so easy to prepare have taken it to other gatherings and dish is always cleaned out fast and recipe requested.

I made this for Christmas dinner after reading all of the great reviews.  I had 25 dinner guests and served it with beef tenderloin, ceasar salad and twice baked potatoes.  It could have been creamier, and wasn't a big hit.  I will try it again for a smaller dinner and see if it turns out better.

Used cheddar instead or pamesan.  Delicious.

I didn't enjoy this recipe at all.  I followed it to the tee.

I made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner, because I'm getting tired of the same old stuff.  Well, it was different but it wasn't good.  My family likes onion, especially my mom, but I won't be making this again.
