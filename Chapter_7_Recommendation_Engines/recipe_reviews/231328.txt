Made this for Seder, and absolutely loved it. I think my husband liked it even more than I did, if that is possible. He seldom comments on my cooking, but he did say how much he liked this. I used portobello mushrooms, and tossed in a little sage as well simply because I love the taste of sage. Thank you so much for this great recipe! I'll definitely be making this again next Passover, if not before!

I also found this very bland.  :-(  I even added extra spices after I read other reviews that said it was bland, & it still turned out bland.

It was sorta crispy/chewy on top, but softer inside. I tried to add more spices, but it's still pretty bland. I think it needs more ingredients.
