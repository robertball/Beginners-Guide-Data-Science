While this was a easy recipe, there was no flavor but that in the veggies. The noodles were tender, the veggies still had a crunch to it, I did follow to a T other then the I used mix veggies (green beans, peas, carrots & corn mix) But nothing is this recipe was a wow. Sorry, wasn't a crowd pleaser.

I've never made mac and cheese before this, but we LOVE it.  We don't use the garlic or hot pepper mainly because I have been out of it every time I make it, but it is one of our go to meals.

This is simple enough to make and tastes good, although I would make a few changes.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that it CAN be bland, but that of course is where your own creativity comes in.  I mixed bread crumbs and parsley with the cheese topping, and next time I plan on adding black pepper and parsley to the cheese sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

Sorry but some recipes are a "starting point or a "base" and this is one of them.  I made this for a pot luck where I had the task of the pasta and vegetable dish.  Yes, it is what I call a base recipe and, as such, it was a perfect base.  By itself I could not have served it to my family or to my friends.  Here are my changes:
First, I sauteed chopped onions, red bell pepper and celery with the garlic.  Second, I added Fox Point seasoning (Penzey's miracle for anything vegetables!) at the same time I added the pasta.  Finally, I baked it but added the breadcrumbs and parsley as another reviewer suggested.  It was delicious.  I gave it 4 stars because as written, it would be fine for a beginner or someone who is not an experienced cook but wants to leave the mac and cheese box behind.  

Thanks for sharing.

A nice cheesy pasta. My kids liked it. You can customize veggies to your tastes. I topped with 1/2 c. cheddar and 1/2 c. parmesan cheese which added a bit more flavor.

Right off the top I did make some changes based on the comments here. I used fresh broccoli, cauliflower and carrots which I can get prepared and bagged at my local supermarket. I saut√©ed them for a few minutes in olive oil before adding to the pasta. Also used half sharp cheddar and half Monterey Jack grated as I had both on hand. Used a  teaspoon of Frank's hot sauce, the rest as per recipe. I served this as a side dish with roasted garlic/Rosemary chicken breasts. Best I got from the family was "great" and I enjoyed so will make it again for sure.

I really liked this.  It's a great base recipe. After making it the first time, I know just how I'll alter it next time.  I'll use some parmesan and more hot pepper sauce for flavor (I used sriracha). Also, I think this would be amazing with fresh veggies.

As the others have said, good base. I substituted for gluten-free options (almond flour and gluten-free pasta), used oat milk, as well as used fresh veggies (bell peppers, jalepenos, onions, peas) instead of frozen. I also doubled up on the siracha in the sauce, and added hot paprika before baking. Worked out so well, I had thirds! You can definitely add even more siracha/hot sauce, however- it flavors the food, but loses much of its bite in the cheese.
