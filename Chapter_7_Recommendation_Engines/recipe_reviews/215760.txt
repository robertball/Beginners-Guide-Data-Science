Great cross between steam brown bread and fruit cake minus the red and green candied fruit.  Moist and flavorful.  I substituted rum flavoring for brandy flavoring.  I used walnuts rather than pecans.  This makes a wonderful special gift.  It would freeze very well.  I doubled the recipe and baked in small individual foil pans.  This will be a standard holiday recipe from now on!

Too moist, add more flour.
