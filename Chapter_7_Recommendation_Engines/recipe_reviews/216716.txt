I totally had to wait 4 days to rate this recipe. So now that today's the 4th day....Yippee for me. While this recipe was delish. It smelled close to the store bought kind. But has it cooked and tasted...it was good but didn't taste like store bought. We totally liked this "Tweaked" verison and it's a sinch to make. Super Super easy. I only made half the batch because 1 pound of ground pork is what I had. And having all these ingredients on hand made it a snap to run threw my Ninja Chopper to make sure all the spices were evenly seasoned throughout the mixture. I will make again. But I will say, it did leave a slight taco seasoning aftertaste to it, which is not a bad thing. It's still a rather good recipe.

I scaled the recipe down, and converted it to metric. I chose this recipe because I did not have the redwine on hand. However, I found it contained considerable less paprika than other recipes. I added more paprika, based on other measurements. It is a good recipe! I will definitely be saving this!

Perferable to the soft chorizo I can find in stores because of the ingredients, but the seasoning is a bit off. It tasted really strongly of wine to me, too much so to use it in a breakfast dish.
