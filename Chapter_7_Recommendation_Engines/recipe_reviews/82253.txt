I made this to take on a family picnic.  Everyone loved it!  I especially enjoyed that the dish could be made days before I needed it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great tasting pasta salad. I used colored rotini instead. I think next time I make it I will add some diced up cucumber carrots and maybe some sweet corn to make it a little more than just pasta.

You don't have to use mostaccioli in paticular, a simple penne past works.  I was so excited to make this recipe and was really disappointed.  This is WAY TOO sweet for me.  I thought maybe the vinegar would cancel out some of the sugar but no way.  Sweet pasta is just really strange.

Quick and easy...everyone that has tried this  has liked it.  It is sweet but you can cut back on the sugar.  Added cukes, onion, and tomato for taste and color.

I first made this salad as written with putting the cucumber and onion in the blender along with all the spices.  I then added the dressing to the pasta and stirred for a couple of days.  When serving it the first time, my family said it was “good, but nothing special”.  I then added diced tomatoes, cucumbers and green onions to the pasta and dressing and marinated it for another day.  Wow, what a difference the added veggies made to this recipe.  It turned out very well and my family then really enjoyed it.  It does hold up really well in the fridge for a few days and worked great for packed lunches.  I will make this again, as written, but will then added the additional veggies.
