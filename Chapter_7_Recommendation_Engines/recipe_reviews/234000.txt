Very good! Quick and easy. I always sub regular milk with a splash of vinegar for buttermilk and it never fails me. Got about 30 cake pops

This made 24 cake pops.  They came out okay.  I'd probably use this recipe again, as it worked well enough in the electronic cake-pop maker.  Approximately 4 minutes baking time worked.  I did cut down on the sugar a little; I suggest not doing that and going ahead with the 1/2 cup.  I also used hot water instead of coffee so my child could eat them, which might have affected the flavor.
