I am sorry but this is not correct.  I'm Indo-fijian and we don't use soy sauce, celery or many of the ingredients mentioned in this recipe.  Actually the recipe for daal is much simpler and we don't need to use a food processor.
Here is the real recipe:
DHAL SOUP (Soup from a dhal! )
Ingredients
1 cup dahl 1 tsp. curry powder
2 cloves garlic 2 small chilies (optional)
1 small onion 2-3 curry leaves
1 tsp. curry powder 1 tsp. sarso
1 tsp. jeeri ghee or oil

Soak the dhal in water overnight. Heat approximately 2 tbsp. of ghee or oil in a pot.
Add sarso and jeeri until they pop, then add onion and curry leaves. Fry until soft. Pound garlic and chili leaves together, add. Once the onion mixture is soft and light brown, add curry powder. Add the dhal. Boil the dhal in four cups water until soft (l hour, when most of the water is gone).  Add salt to taste and voila.

Hope this helps.

My husband and I love Indian food, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  I took one bite of it and knew my husband would love it.  I handed him the bowl and as he took a bite, his eyes just rolled in the back of his head as if he were in an overwhelming state of  palatable pleasure.  If you like curry, then give this one a try.

Truly simple to make but you must be a curry lover - if you don't like curry - forget this dish.  The only problem I had was the amt. of salt-I used half the suggested amt and it was too much for us.  I find that if you are using bouillion cubes you can probably pass on the salt since bouillion cubes are very salty.  Anyway, I thought this dish was ruined with the saltiness.  I knew I could try and add some raw sliced potatoes and cook them for 15 min. to absorb some of the salt but I wanted to see if there was something quicker. I went on the web to see how to fix this.  Someone suggested adding lemon juice a bit at a time (you don't want the soup to taste like lemon now!).  Sure enough it worked - never tasted the lemon and it corrected the saltiness.  In this instance, if you had tasted some lemon in this soup it would have worked. Hope this tip helps my fellow chefs out there!

Very nice and warming on a cold winter day, but not really traditional Fijian dhal.

Good soup, especially for lentil lovers, but even if your not.  Skipped the fungreek, don't like, and the salt.

I've been looking for a recipe that was similar to a Dhal soup in a local restaurant and I think I've found it! This was delicious and loved by all.

This recipe turned out beautifully. I actually made mine in my slow cooker, so apart from sauteing the onions and garlic, I basically just dumped everything in, set it on high and about 4 hours later it was done. I like my food on the spicier side than most so I still needed to add hot sauce to my finished soup. If I make it again I will add more chili flakes or cayenne.

Great tasting soup!  I omitted the bouillon and the salt.  By pureeing only part of the soup, I was able to enjoy some chunks of vegetables.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'm glad I tried it!
