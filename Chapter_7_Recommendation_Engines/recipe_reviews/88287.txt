This was EXCELLENT!  I didn't have any cilantro, but it was still good without.  One note - I added sour cream on top, but I wouldn't again because it started to cook by the time we were getting to the bottom of our bowls...however, since the recipe does not call for sour cream, I still must give it 5 stars.  Served with mini quesadillas for dipping.

Excellent soup!!  Easy, quick and everyone loved it!  Now that's my idea of success.  I didn't use the cooking sherry in the soup.  I couldn't see the reason for it.  I'd rather drink a small glass of wine while preparing the soup. This is a definite keeper for our family.

EXCELLENT! I made the recipe as written with 2 exceptions: I thoroughly rinsed the beans in a collander or sieve prior to cooking so as to eliminate the gassy after effects that beans have on some people. Also, I find that adding a little wine or cooking sherry gives the beans a great flavor. Just before serving, I added a small dollop of sour cream with a few leaves of fresh cilantro and a tortilla chip sticking out of the sour cream. I received rave reviews and requests for 2nd and 3rd helpings.

Only wanted to make half the recipe so used a 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes and just 1 can of black beans - 2 grated carrots and 2 cups of beef broth.  Didn't have fresh cilantro so used some oregano in the soup instead.  And what's salsa without a splash of lime juice? My potato masher did the trick of making the soup slightly smooth, but still chunky.

This soup is good and we will probably make it again.  We pureed some of the beans and I added in a couple of cans of green salsa and extra garlic to ramp up the flavor a bit.  I also added in some cubed ham that we needed to use up.  The soup came out delicious.

OMG what can I say.  This was outstanding.  I made this soup for a birthday party last night and everyone went crazy over it. The only change I made was to use 2 - 10 oz cans of Rotel tomatoes instead of 1 - 14.5 can cause that is what I had on hand and I did not want to waste the leftover tomatoes.  Each person added freshly grated Parmesan cheese to their liking and I had sour cream available for those who wanted it.  My only suggestion is, if you do not like hot (spicy) soup, either decrease the amount of cayenne pepper or do not use at all.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

Excellent soup, lots of flavor, even without the cilantro and chili powder!!! Also easy and quick. I used 1 can of the beans and tomatoes with my chopper to make a chunky mix, and the other 2 cans of beans I pureed, to get a nice, thicker consistency. Served with Tortilla  chips and shredded cheddar, will definitely make again!

Easy and fantastic!  I left out the carrot and celery due to personal preference and it was still great.  I put a spoonfull of sour cream in the bowl before adding soup and topped with Mexican cheese blend. The cool and cheesy addition was a nice touch. I'll definitely make again.

We loved this recipe and were really surprised how good it was.  I added extra black beans and took about a cup and a half of them and blended them in the mini chopper to help make the soup thicker.  I also used the mini chopper on the diced tomatoes (I don't like tomato chunks) and added half a jalepeno to make it spicy.  I didn't use the carrots.   We would definitely make this again!

LOVE IT!  A local cafe makes a black bean soup that I love so I was looking for a similar recipe...this is even better!!  I love cilantro and it really makes this dish.  I have made it several times now; I usually add diced green and red peppers and omit the carrots.  I serve with a dallop of sour cream on top like the restaurant...YUM!!!  Thank you!

Easy, healthy, and good.  I didn't have celery, so substituted bell pepper instead.  Used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter, and went heavy on the garlic and cumin.  Served over rice.  Good even without cilantro, but I would add cilantro if I had it.  (Oh, and I also toss in a bit of wheat or oat bran into almost everything I cook ... you can't taste it, and it's good for you.)

This soup was very good. I left out the butter, and added the vegetables to the soup only after I had the beans (I used dried black beans) were soft and ready. I pureed the black beans lightly in the stock, and then added the remaining ingredients. I left out the celery and cayenne pepper, because I didn't have any and used paprika instead. I might have used beef bullion instead. Overall, tasty and healthy.

I puréed half of the beans, added more cumin (we love it), and squeezed a fresh lemon in with the cilantro at the end. Before adding the lemon and cilantro, my husband and I both thought it rather bland when we tasted it. After lemon addition, Delicious!!! Will make again and again with these changes for our tastes. Thank you!

Excellent recipe!  I did not like the taste of the cooking sherry in the soup, so I added a little Worcestershire sauce and it is delicious (maybe I didn't wait long enough for the sherry to meld with the other flavors before tasting).  I had some homemade salt free salsa that I needed to use up and used it in place of the canned tomatoes and I cooked dried black beans.  I did not have cilantro, but I am not a big fan of it.

We really enjoyed these black beans!  When I saw the word "Salsa" in the title I was expecting to see it have salsa in the ingredients.  There's not even tomatoes!  Regardless it taste yummy, just think the title should be changed, does not taste like any salsa I've had!  Made some pico to garnish with.

SO SIMPLE, SO BASIC! It was awesome. I didn't have black beans so I used pinto beans. I added a splash of sherry like one reviewer and that was a great addition. Also, I didn't use salsa ... Just three cans of beans, 2 cups of broth, garlic, tabasco sauce, a small dash of sugar, and cumin. FAB.

Added a bit of liquid smoke and a bit more cayenne. Blended to smooth a bit and served with rice in a bowl.  Black beans and rice. Delish!

I added my own homemade salsa - about 2 tablespoons and 1 can of spicy refried beans. I have given this receipe out so many times to friends and relatives.
