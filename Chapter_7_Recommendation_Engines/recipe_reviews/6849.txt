Perfect, perfect!  I subbed 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour and baked them on a pizza stone sprinkled with cornmeal.  I could only bake 6 at a time, so due to my fussy baby I accidentally let the second half of the batch rise for 1 hour on a floured board under a damp towel after they were formed instead of the twenty minutes the recipe called for, and the second batch was SPECTACULAR- light and fluffy on the inside, crisp on the outside.  I also only needed no bake them for half as long as the recipe called for- good thing I kept an eye on them the first time- not sure if my oven is off or what, but just watch them closely the first time to see what they do.

This was my first attempt at making homemade bagels! They came out fantastic!! It is a process... easy, but a bit time consuming, like anything baked using yeast.I didn't change anything except I used the suggestions from others, I let them rise for 30 minutes and made 8 larger bagels instead of the 12...and they are a perfect size! I also used maybe a quarter cup of whole wheat flour as well. I made them everything bagels by dipping the bagel in a bowl with poppy seeds, onion flakes, garlic flakes, some sesame seeds, and one batch had some coarse sea salt added. One bagel I coated with some honey and sprinkled some oats on it..just to see.I dipped them in it after I boiled them before baking. I also lightly oiled the baking sheet and sprinkled some corn meal. I must say, they taste wonderful, my boyfriend loved them!! Thanks for the recipe...

I make a lot of breads and this was so easy!!!  Make sure your dough rises regardless of the amount of time stated and make sure  your water is not too hot when you add it to the yeast and flour.  That may be why some of your bagels sank.  After you have shaped the bagels and they have risen, make sure you don't knock them down before you put them into the boiling water.  GREAT RECIPE!!!

This was not my first time making bagels, but this was by far this is the easiest recipe to follow. In order to form a semi-perfect bagel, after letting the dough rest for 15 minutes, I rolled them into 12 smooth balls, and then let it rise for 30 minutes. I also made an oatmeal bagel with 1 cup white flour, 2 cups wheat flour, and 1 1/2 of ground oatmeal. I added 4 tablespoons of honey, and they came out scrumptious.

My kids had a blast making these with me, and they came out like Real Bagels!

I made a couple small modifications to the recipe:
To get commercial sized bagels, we made 8 with this recipe instead of 12.
I let the yeast rest with the salt and sugar in the hot water for a few moments before adding it to the other dry ingredients - years of making dough has taught me this is the way I get them to rise better.
I let the formed bagels rise in warm oven (oven turned on for two minutes while forming bagels and then turned off) and sprayed the pan they were on with PAM so I could peel them off easier to get them a'boiling. (Used a shortening-greased pan to bake, however).

Great recipe! I worked at a bagel shop while in college and we did the traditional boiled bagel and this come pretty close. 

Some notes:
Proofing the bagels - After I shaped the bagels (forming the dough into a small ball and poking a hole in the middle is genius!), I put them on a cookie sheet, let them rise a bit (about 15mins or so) and placed them in the refrigerator for about 45mins. This allows them to proof the rest of the way and helps them retain their shape once you put the bagel into the boiling water. 

Boiling the bagels - Depending on how you like the texture will determine how long you let the bagel boil. For mine, I only let the bagel boil for about 30-45 seconds which will give it a thin crispy crust and a softer texture inside. I've never heard of letting a bagel boil in water for 7mins., from my experience (baking bagels at 3am - sometimes hungover and having this happen), boiling bagels too long causes them to become water-logged and hard to handle (but if you had success, then I've learned something new!). Also, it's important to keep the water at a very high boil. I dropped one bagel in at a time so the temp wouldn't drop. 

Seriously, not sure if I'm going to pay $10+ for a dozen bagels around here anymore especially since this recipe was so good! Thanks for posting!!

These bagels are very delicious, but this was my very first attempt at making bagels.  Anyone new to making bagels should note that the instructions should mention that the bagels must be placed in the oven immediately after boiling.  I didn't have a big enough pot to boil all the bagels at once, so I had to boil them in two separate batches.  The first batch that I boiled then left to sit and wait for the second batch came out of the oven very dense and rubbery.  However, the batch that went directly from the boiling water into the oven came out wonderfully!

Bagels came out nice. Had a nice texture but like a lot of reviewers stated; recipe makes 12 small bagels (although that size is good for breakfast egg sandwiches!) I myself make 10 med. sized bagels. I think I will let dough rise longer next time. I also am going to try out the honey-oatmeal version that Nicole submitted sounds yummy! (Thanks Nicole!) I gave this recipe a solid 4 instead of a 5 because the recipe really didn't make the amount stated and they didn't rise quite as much as I would like.

I have made this recipe 6 times in 2 weeks time, and they have been excellent every time.  Here are a few tips I've discovered through testing and experience:  I have tried substituting brown sugar for white sugar in this entire recipe, including the boil, and they taste equally good but a little different (my wife thinks they are better).  7 minutes of boiling is pointless, as I've done many experiments with these and found that 1:30 each side is the max needed -- nothing longer than that will make it any chewier.  Boil with a ROLLING boil, not a simmer as per the recipe.  The temp will drop when you add the dough anyhow, so a rolling boil keeps things boiling when the bagels go in.  Bake them at 400F for about 20-25 minutes, turning the cookie sheet around halfway through so it bakes evenly.  The chewy texture is best achieved through letting them cool and staying out all day (or overnight) before bagging.  They will taste less yeasty and more dense and chewy after sitting out.  Also, this recipe will yield very small bagels if you make 12 so I suggest doing 7-8 for a regular-sized bagel.  Brush them with egg before baking for a glossy surface and save yourself the whole broiling step.  If you prefer not to use vegetable oil you can sprinkle yellow cornmeal on the cookie sheet instead.  It won't stick and it adds a little bonus flavor underneath.  Lastly, I have gotten excellent results using 1 tsp. less yeast (so a total 3.5tsp).  Happy bagel making!

WOW! Maybe I just lucked out but my bagels came out just wonderful.  They were exactly the type of bagel that I wanted.  I used half whole wheat flour and made about 8 larger bagels.  I let them rise 30 minutes and I did the broiling technique first before boiling them.  I think I should have broiled them just a tad longer and they would have been slightly shinier.  I baked them for about 25 minutes and turned them once while baking just because I wanted both sides a tad crispy.  They were just perfect all around, and the middle was nice and fluffy.  I made a nice big veggie bagel sandwich soon after they were out of the oven and I was just in heaven.  I will be making these weekly!!!

Recipe was fairly simple to follow.  It was fun to make, and the results were tastefully satisfying to both myself and my wife.  I had made boiled bagels 30 years ago, and this recipe brought back old memories. Joe

I am not happy with the way these bagels turned out. I read all of the five-star reviews before I started and followed the directions to a T, with the exception of making 9 bagels instead of 12. The bagels looked beautiful going into the water bath and beautiful coming out. It was about 30 minutes into baking that I realized these weren't going to be the "perfect bagels" I had envisioned. The bottoms were gooey even after 45 minutes in the oven. I flipped them over and baked for another 15 minutes before pulling them out of oven, not wanting to burn them. Though this was my first attempt at homemade bagels, I consider myself an accomplished baker and have never had problems with homemade breads, rolls, pretzels (also boiled), etc. I believe the error in this recipe is in the boiling time. Most other recipes state to boil bagels under 2 minutes total, not seven. I will attempt these bagels one more time, but will decrease the boil time significantly.

These bagels are quite good.  It took a while to make them, but they are worth the effort and time.  They come out sort of flat, but are really chewy and good with a lot of seasonings on them.  I suggest using a cookie cutter or something of that nature to get a good uniform shape with the dough.  Overall they are great!

My first attempt at these was great as written.  The second time I made them pumpkin spice w/ dried cranberries.  I substituted warmed orange juice and 1/2 c. pumpkin puree for the water and used light brown sugar instead of white.  The baking time was right on the money.

A great recipe for a bagel novice like me. Subbed mostly bread flour for a chewier bagel, and was not disappointed. Rather than form balls and poke them, I squeezed dough portions into snakes, moistened each end, and pinched together to form each bagel.  Also followed other reviewers' advice and made 8 larger bagels, used molasses, not white sugar (as directed), for the boiling step.  Baked at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes or so, then lowered the heat to 350 to finish for a darker, golden exterior.  Next time (and there will be many!), will press sesame seeds -or other toppings- into dough after boiling (most fell off while slicing, as they were just sprinkled on), and try broiling option. P.S.- One bagel from this first attempt was impregnated with chocolate chips (fully sealed in dough) by the kiddo, and that was delightful!

Made these bagels yesterday and turned them into the EVERYTHING BAGEL. I followed the basic recipe but added some sunflower seeds, flax seeds, and minced onion and garlic to the wet ingredients before kneading. I made 8 large bagels and let them rise about 15 min. longer than it states. After boiling I dipped one side of each bagel in a egg white that was beaten then immediately into a bowl that I had placed mixed goodies (more fresh chopped garlic, dried onion,sea salt,sunflower seeds and poppy seeds) I baked them the required time and OH MY GOD!!!! The whole house smelled incredible and these were FANTASTIC! This is a great recipe to play with for add ins!

I am a bagel junkie, and have tried making my own before with less than perfect results. I tried this recipe today for the first time, and am very hapy with the results.  Some tips: - for the first 1.5C of flour, use 1C all purpose flour and 1/2 C wheat flour (gives the bagels a nice subtle nutty taste) - when adding the rest of the flour by hand, use a 2:1 ratio of all purpose and wheat flour - after forming the bagels, put them on parchment paper on your baking sheet, and allow to rise on top rack of the oven with a pot of boiling water on the floor of the oven - I definitely recommend the broiling option given in the original instructions--leave the risen bagels on the parchment paper while broiling, and they shouldn't stick

Great recipe! I used someone else's suggestion of putting molasses in the water instead of sugar, and the outsides came out crisp and brown. The insides are chewy and tasty. I used a heavy duty baking stone when baking mine. It took around 30-35 minutes just like the recipe said. I also separated the dough into 8 even pieces instead of 12 and the bagels came out the size you would find at a store. Keep in mind that the bagels are going to pretty much double in size both in height and diameter when put into the simmering water so don't worry if they look a little on the small side after proofing. I just may never buy bagels again! I like to get a nice piece of asiago, shred it, and put it on as a topping, The raw ingredients are so much cheaper then paying for bagels. It just takes a little bit of time, but is a very simple recipe to follow. 

Having made this recipe at least 10 times now, I must add that you will likely need to add more flour when kneading the dough. I usually knead mine in a Kitchenaide mixer and slowly sprinkle in flour till the dough comes together and is firmer because it will be wet and sticky at first which is not what you want...

The bagels came out perfect in my 2nd attempt.  I made mini bagels (24 bagels) instead of the full size bagels with raisin.  I took the extra step of broiling them for 1 min on each size, then put them in boiling water for 1 min. and finally baked them for 15 mins. The finished bagels are all glossy and no wringle this time.
My husband who usually will only eat 1 full size bagel, ate 5 mini bagels at one time.

Super delicious! I tried both boiling first and broiling first. Both were good, but different. The broiled variety looked more smooth and uniform, but seem more like regular bread than a bagel. The boiled ones got deliciously crisp on the outside and were chewy in the middle, but didn't look as nice. I'll definitely make again, but stick with the boiling first method. PS I gently kneeded cheddar cheese into mine, and sprinkled with onion flakes and more cheese before browning in the oven. Oh my gosh good.

I followed the broil first for shiny look directions. The only thing I added was during baking, I brushed the tops of each bagel with whipped eggwhites/water every 8 minutes. Not only did they turn out beautiful, they were absolutely delicious!. The big test was 2 days later when I toasted the extras I stored in a plastic bag in the icebox. They were fantastic. I will never buy bagels again. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

LOVE this bagel recipe. I ONLY use the boiling method when I make my bagels. They always come out chewier and more flavorful. I've done Rosemary bagels, cinnamon raisin, fennel sea salt bagels. I've tested dozens of variations. **For a thicker, and perhaps crisper/chewier bagels I suggest brushing them with egg wash before sticking in the oven.

Once you make these at home,  you will NEVER buy bagels again! These are the real deal - chewy inside, with the baked crust on the outside, ideal for toasting! I've made these about six times, using a stand mixer (not kneading by hand). Here are the modifications needed: 1. Once all flour has been added, you will knead it in the mixer for 5-10 minutes until elastic and shiny on the surface. 2. Cover mixing bowl with plastic wrap and rise for one hour. 3. Start water to boil in the last 10 minutes of rising, then shape each bagel as desired, resting them under a damp cloth. 4. No need to wait 20 min for a second rise, by the time the water is boiling and you've finished shaping (5-10 min), you can start boiling the bagels in batches of 3-4 per pot. 5. TIMING adjustment is critical! Only 1 minute per side - then onto a cookie rack to drain. 5. Once they are all boiled, blot them dry on bottom, transfer to greased cookie sheet. 6. Brush with an egg-white wash and add top with desired add-ons (poppy seeds, garlic powder, salt, etc.). Baking time is 20-25 min as per directions. Wonderful!

The bagels tasted fine but there is another homemade bagel recipe that is so much easier and quicker to prepare. I prefer the ingredients in this recipe as it doesn't require milk or butter but the preparation in the other.

Wonderfully easy and yummy recipe.  I ended up with 8 bagels.  I let the dough rise for an hour during the second rise and coated the bottoms with corn meal and baked the on a pizza stone.  Mine took a little less than 30 minutes to cook in the oven.

They were ok. The directions leave something to be desired. These need to go strait from the boiler to the oven. No down time or they shrink. Not what I expected.

I tried it just as the recipe said, and it was AMAZING!  Never buying store bought again!  Now I just need to figure out how to make them look more uniform.

These are Awesome!  I will be making these on a weekly basis now. my family loves bagels. I was skeptical because the dough took forever for me to work together, seemed too dry. But  they turned out just like our local bagel place's bagels.   To those who had problems with them not rising ..I placed mine on a greased cookie sheet , covered with a tea towel, and put them over the pot of boiling water. This rose them within 5-10 min. But my house was cold , not sure that would be necessary in warmer weather.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!  Wish I could give it more then 5 stars!!

This recipe goes together well.  I will definitely make these again.  The only change I'd make is letting them rise a little longer that 20 minutes.  One note, when the bagels come out of the water, they are wet and stick, put them on something they won't stick to and take the opportunity to sprinkle them with a topping.

I live in a country where I can't get bagels...so I had to try to make these!  It was much easier than I expected, although my first batch wasn't as "big" as I'd hoped.  I think it takes a few tries until you know when the dough is kneaded enough.  I don't have much experience with dough so I may have over kneaded.  But they were still great and I made 8 and put most in the freezer (before I ate them all).  Next time I'll make them smaller and add some sesame or poppy seeds and maybe a bit more salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

I stalked this recipe for quite some time before deciding to make the bagels.  The instructions were simple enough although, for a novice bread maker like myself, directing me to "add enough flour until moderately stiff" didn't aid me too well. When I went to turn the dough onto my floured surface, it was already rather stiff and quite hard to work with.  But, like I said, that could just be my inexperience with dough.  Also, my dough didn't rise very well the first time, so the finished product did turn out a little more dense than I would have liked.  As other reviews stated, I let the bagels rise (the second time) for at least 30 minutes, added brown sugar to my boiling water and only boiled my bagels for about two minutes.  Baked them on a large cookie sheet covered in PAM and cornmeal to prevent sticking.  I also elected to make eight "normal-sized" bagels and am glad I did... I think the suggested twelve would've been a little small.  Overall, good and easy recipe that easy to modify for various flavors.  Would definitely use this recipe again!

This was a great recipe to make bagels... but it took really long.  A gallon of water was a little too much for boiling the bagels, but it did taste really good afterwards.  I made 23 small bagels.  :)

This was the first time I made bagels. But instead of making them round...I made them into sticks. Roll them out like you do for a pretzel, then twist the ends together. I dusted them with a little garlic salt. (Kids complainted that they were too saltly) next time I'm trying garlic powder. (we like garlic). Kids said they came out better than the local bakery.

I've been looking for a good bagel recipe which did not include milk or butter and yours was perfect. Not enough dough for 12 bagels, more like 9, but the taste is very good. I suggest turning the bagels over halfway through the cooking process so that one side is less likely to become over-brown and perhaps use an egg-wash to give the bagels some gloss.  Highly recommended recipe which is easy to follow.

This was my first time making bagels and they were delicious.  Let them rise about 30-40 min.  They only took 15 min. in my oven.  I would advise reading the article on "Forming and Baking Bagels" first.  My water stopped boiling when I put bagels in and the article will give a better perspective if you have never made bagels before.

Great taste and texture. I didn't broil them, just boiled and baked. And like others recommended, I let them rise for 1 hour. Yummy! I don't think I'll be buying store-bought bagels anymore!

I took the suggestion and added about a tablespoon of Molasses to the boiling water along with the sugar.  Once the bagels were boiled I dipped the tops in an everything mixture (sesame seeds, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, freeze dried garlic, onion flakes and sea salt - just a tablespoon of each)  This recipe made 13 bagels for me - average size.  All I can say is that I loved this recipe and will make it over and over again - probably tweaking ingredients to get different flavors of bagels.  I am very eager to try banana nut.

These were relativity easy to make although they did take a long time. I found that they were a little too tough and chewy. Also the sugar salt perportions  were a little off and it made them taste a little funny.

Yummy!  I double the recipe and use 2 cups rice flour, 1 cup wheat germ, 1 cup steel cut oats, and the rest whole wheat flour.  I also use rice milk instead of part of the water.  Absolutely killer!!!

I never knew making bagels could be so much fun and so easy! They've always been a store-bought mystery. They're a little time consuming but worth it. My mom taught me to let the yeast sit with the warm water and sugar for a few minutes, then mix in the dry and remaining ingredients. That's the only real deviation I made from the original recipe. Also, I let the dough rise 10-15 minutes longer both times. The outcome was fabulous! I tried someone else's honey-oat suggestion, and also used a garlic bread spice mixture to coat some others. Delish! I coated them after boiling and before baking. Wonderful recipe! I'm delighted I don't need to buy bagels anymore!

These are great! I used whole wheat flour and added a bit of lemon juice to help the wheat flour rise. I let them rise for around 30 minutes and rolled the pieces out into snakes then wrapped the rolled piece around my hand to make a circle as this was less time cosuming for me. Yay! I have now made bagels. Thanks for the great recipe!

Incredible! I followed the recipe without changing a thing. This was my first attempt at homemade bagels and my family and I are thrilled with the results. It wasn't as labor intensive as I'd expected either. I broiled them after they were finished rising, then boiled them for the 7 minutes and baked them for about 20 minutes. Absolutely Glorious!

These bagels deserve 10 stars- they are every bit as good as the ones I travel over 50 miles for- this is a real Jewish bagel. After boiling I coated them in poppy seeds as these are our favorite- AWESOME!! Thank you so much for this recipe, I don't have to drive any more

I thought these were great!  I'm trying not to eat refined foods and have been missing bagels. I made them with ALL whole wheat flour and followed the rest of your recipe as is.  I sprinkled sesame seeds on after boiling.

Fabulous bagels! I dipped the bottoms in cornmeal after they boiled then baked for 35 minutes (or until golden). So yummy!

Fantastic recipe. This was my very first time making bagels, so the process did take me a long time. It, however, is so much fun! I wish I had a large Kitchenaid mixer, but had to rely on my old electric hand mixer from the '80s, and it worked out fine. The batch yielded 9 normal sized bagels. I made 3 cranberry-cinnamon, 3 chocolate chip, and 3 garlic bagels. 

Now, I know that the recipe is great, because even though I messed up certain parts, the bagels came out beautifully. 
Accident #1 -- I misread the directions and let the dough rest before I rolled them into balls. 
Accident #2 (this is a big one) -- halfway through the baking, I realized that the oven was set on BROIL and not BAKE!!! However, I have a feeling that this gave me a very crisp crust and a tender inside, which I love in bagels. 

The only reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 (and no, don't worry, I did not take off a star because of my OWN mistakes! I really dislike it when reviewers do that...) is because the flavor was not very strong. I would say it's a little on the bland side, and doesn't have a strong yeasty taste. Maybe it needs a little more sugar or a dash of salt on the outside, but the taste is a little lacking, despite the fact that I added cinnamon to the cranberry ones I made, and vanilla to the chocolate ones, and garlic powder to the garlic ones. I will try to make a few adjustments and see what I can do to up the flavor on this, and might come back to update my rating/review.

This is a pretty good recipe, however the bagels turned out very small. I was looking forward to them being smaller than normal sized bagels after reading the other reviews, as I feel normal bagels are too big of a portion, but these were too small. I'm a pretty skinny girl, but I had to eat two of these bagels as a breakfast to fill up. Other than that, it is a very good recipe. I used all whole wheat flour and they turned out great. I made some into cinnamon raison, and some into garlic sesame. If you do this, make sure to boil the sweeter bagels before the savory ones, though. I will definitely use this recipe again, but will make them into 6 normal sized bagels instead of 12 tiny ones. 

I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar... this turned out really good.

Thanks for the great recipe.

Good recipe.  My first attempt at making bagels and they turned out pretty well.  They didn't rise as much as I think they should have but I believe that was because the yeast I used was pretty old or maybe my water wasn't warm enough.  Over all though I was pretty impressed.  I haven't had much success with breads in the past but this was a snap!  Will definately be trying these again with fresh yeast.

Amazing! I am horrible at making yeast items.  But this turned out great! I used the bread dough function on my Cuisinart food processor.  Cut my kneading time down to about 2 minutes.  Did the second rise in the oven for 30 minutes.  Made the bagels a bit lighter.  Can't wait to do some variations.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at bagels, and I think I did a pretty good job for a novice! My husband thought the first batch I made were a little "yeasty", so I cut back on the amount of yeast I used, and that was much better. Thank God for my Kitchen Aid, or I don't think I would attempt making bread of ANY kind! :) Thanks for a great recipe!!! The help I got from allrecipes.com on how to form the bagels was invaluable! Check it out!

Fast, easy, great texture and flavor. My daughter and I had fun making bagels for the first time. I don't think we'll be buying bagels at the store again. It's home-made for us. 
Thanks for the recipe.

delicious! but one warning - make sure you do not OVER rise them or they will collapse into horrid, wrinkly slabs when you scoop them out of the boiling water. I made 12 the first time, one collapsed, 10 the next time and all collapsed because my oven was on auto clean and stayed locked past the rising time. Live and learn. Next batch (made with garlic and caramelized onion) was perfect.

Made this recipe as written. The bagels turned out well, however I am wondering why no one else mentioned the amount of water given in the recipe. I had to use 2 cups of water, as the dough did not come together at all with the 1 1/2 cups. It was humid and actually a rainy day when I made these, so I don't think it was the atmosphere. Anyway, they turned out fine after adding the extra water, so all is well. Will make again.

Awesome bagels, and sooo easy to make. If you want big bagels, you need to let them rise for more than 20 minutes before boiling them. I did, and they turned huge and amazing!

I really loved these bagels. This is my first attempt. They are completely vegan too! I used Coconut Sugar instead of white sugar for all of it. I also added sunflower seeds, garlic powder, dried (minced) onion, basil, and cumin. Oh, and I substituted 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat four. They are amazing!!! I didn't use any electric stuff either, I hand kneaded them, and they turned out great; just check out the photo!

I don't have anything to compare it to but being my first time making bagels, they came out awesome! The only thing I have to say is I used nearly 1 and a half cups less flour than the recipe called for and I also had substituted 1 cup of whole-wheat flour for my recipe.

Very good...although a little bland.  I replaced half of the flour with white whole wheat....I made 12 bagels - 6 plain & 6 that I kneaded in cinnamon & raisins.  Broiled and boiled in Molasses. Then topped cinnamon raisin ones with a cinnamon crunch topping (1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, & 1 Tbsp melted butter). 
To try: use honey instead of sugar & add extra honey. Try topping some with asiago cheese for bagel sandwiches.

Excellent recipe. I've been making these once a week for months now. 

-Broil your bagels before you boil them for a few minutes, or until puffed and slightly golden brown. This ensures they won't deflate and also makes baking quicker.

-I make 8 instead of 12. Larger bagels won't deflate/flatten as easily as small ones.

-Brush egg white on the top after you're done boiling them, then sprinkle on poppy seeds. Poppy seed/raisin bagels are especially good.

Great recipe! Takes a couple tries to get the hang of it, especially getting the yeast right (eventually I just mixed it in with the water/sugar/salt before I added it to the flour and got way better results).

Great recipe!
My hubby just got back from NY c-raving for the bagels he had every single morning for three weeks he spent there - and asked for more!
Couldn't find my old recipe, used this one and produced 8 oversized, chewy on the inside, golden crispy on the outside REAL bagels!
Used sesame on 3, poppy seeds on 3 and 2 plain with coarse salt on top.
- We live in Europe now, so the metric eq. for yeast to flour was: for 500 grs flour (4.5 cups) used one sachet (27 gr) dried yeast.  Worked out great. A keeper!

I've made these twice now, and they're fantastic. The first time I followed the general recipe, and the second I broiled them first. I'd definitely recommend the broil-before just for aesthetic reasons. I ran fresh basil and tomatoes through the food processer and added them when I kneaded in the rest of the flour, and they are literally one of the best things I have ever eaten. I also did an egg wash on my second batch (again, aesthetics) and they came out beautiful and professional looking.

Made everything bagels out of this recipe. I let my neighbors who were all hanging out try them, and they ALL said they were the best bagels they'd ever had! This was quite the compliment to me and the recipe, as I do NOT consider myself to be a baker- I usually stick to cooking.

this recipe seemed odd, lots of yeast. plus, NO OIL!
never heard of that. thought it was a mistake, tried it anyway. super good. i think omitting oil makes them extra chewy. makes 10.

I'm a native New Yorker living in Oregon. I can't find a good bagel. This was the very first time I've ever attempted making bagels. Amazing and so easy! These bagels are going to be a staple in this house.

I made these yesterday and ate one today,and they were waaaaaayyyy too salty. It was like swallowing ocean water! They also didn't rise and only got slightly bigger when I boiled them, but they still turned out really puny. I think I'll try a different bagel recipe next time.

My family loved these. There is something about making bagels for the first time on my own that provided me with a great sense of accomplishment! I found that you should bake these about 5 minutes before boiling. Keep an eye on them though as they will rise in the heat...you don't want the middle to close on you so be ready to pull them out if necessary.

So good. I live in Costa Rica and it is hard to find a good bagel. Now I make them and don't waste money on crummy store bought bagels.

This is a real winner!  It had been many years since I made bagels.  They are quite easy to make.  My only change was a added 1 tbs. salad oil to the dough and let them rise for 30 minutes.  More rising time=more tenderness and less 'chewiness'.  Pick your degree of tenderness!

the best bagels!  I have made this recipie lots of times now and they come out great each time!  I usually make 8 larger bagels instead of the 12.  Sometimes I add a tablespoon of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of raisins for great breakfast bagels.  YUM!!!!

These were easy to make, and quite tasty!  I felt they were too salty so I couldn't give them a full five stars, but texture and taste (other than the salt) were excellent. Next time, I'll reduce the salt to 2 teaspoons.  I found that the easiest way to make the holes was to shape the dough, poke my finger through, and then twirl the dough on my finger like a pizza maker. Don't worry, it's sturdy.  I broiled them before boiling them, but I'm not sure that it made much of a difference.  I followed someone's tip to add molasses to the boiling water and I liked the depth it added.  I ended up cooking mine for about 20 minutes before they were done.  I could have kicked myself for not noticing I was out of sesame seeds before I made these.

These bagels were absolutely delicious, although I noticed that when I boiled them in two batches, the first ones I boiled for 7 minutes turned into hard deformed hockey pucks. I let the second batch only boil for about 3 minutes and they turned out fantastic. This may have been because I let my dough rise for about 45 minutes which I always do with pizza but I've heard with bagels that the rise is not as long. I'm going to make these bagels from now on than buying them!

While I am an experienced bread baker, this morning was my first attempt at bagels.  The outcome is that I'm quite satisfied with taste and texture.  I used several reviewer tips both for the good and the bad.  I mixed the dough in my Kitchen Aid mixer and needed to add an extra tablespoon or two of warm water to get the dough to form a ball.  I should not have let the shaped bagels rise for the hour that a reviewer suggested.  I didn't realize the bagels would continue to rise in the simmering pot!  Yikes!  It was a little alarming.  I used an egg wash before my seed toppings.  And I followed the boiling and baking times precisely.  Four stars only because I feel the directions didn't have enough "if you don't do this, the bagels will __________" type of information for beginners.  They also don't tell me at which step I could add raisins etc.  It took me 2 hrs. start to finish.  Too much time to do on any but lazy holiday mornings like today.

These bagels came out great. The ultimate test was seeing if my picky five year old would eat this. He ate them and loved them. The only thing different I would change about this recipe is to let the bagel dough rise more--maybe add an additional 15 minutes to this recipe. I did not rate this recipe as a five star only cause of the amount the recipe called for. Instead of me making 12 bagels, I measured to make 8. Well, the amount of eight is only good small bagels. The amount of eight only made four bagels. I think next time I make this for my family, I will make cinnamon bagels and add raisins, cinnamon and a bit of molasses to the recipe. YUMMY!!

Perfectly delicious, but flat. The taste is right on, but the bagels are not as puffy as I would have liked. I took one of the reviewers' advice and let the bagels rise for 30 instead of 20 minutes, but they still fell a little flat.

What a great recipe! I agree, it does take a LONG time, but the results are so worth it. A few reviewers said that the amount of salt in the recipe was perfect, but I actually think my bagels came out a little salty for my taste. I'll cut it in half next time. The texture was absolutely perfect. I made a batch of plain and a batch using the honey-oat recipe submitted by another reviewer, and both are AWESOME. I highly recommend this recipe.

Ok - this turned out to be a big flat salty mess. I made 8 bagels because I wanted them to be bigger, not mini bagels. Well they were gigantic. I boiled them for the time indicated, easy enough. Cooked them for 30 minutes, they're flat, super-glued to the pan, really pale looking...and wayyyy too salty. I'll see if when they cool I can get them off the pan. I'll stick with the bakery for now :(

I've always wanted to make homemade bagels, but was hesitant because of the lengthy and "difficult" process.  However, this recipe was easy to follow and I'm happy to say that the bagels turned out beautifully!  I highly recommend this recipe.

I was not pleased with the results of this recipe.  The bagels flattened as they baked and their texture was similar to beef jerky.  The whole process took forever and hovering over a pot of boiling water for that long is not my idea of a good time.  I've been looking for a good bagel recipe for a long time and this one isn't it.

I thought they were great.  I had a little trouble forming them correctly, but I'm more concerned with the taste. My daughters and my husband all liked them.  I believe they are best eaten while they are still warm.

Meh, this recipe was ok, I guess.  I'm not sure actually whether it was the recipe or whether it was my inexperience in bagel-making that messed 'em up, or even if they WERE messed up.  But they turned out a little tough for my liking.  They looked amazing, though.  Just like perfect store-bought bagels.

These turned out really well and were much easier than I expected.  Boiling them first makes them really authentic.  I added sesame seeds to some, drizzled honey over others, and topped others with cinnamon-sugar before baking.  Delicious!

Great recipe. This makes very dense bagels, like NY bagels.

These are a little crispy on the outside! Nice

I cooked mine about 40 minutes

Used the broiled, boiled, and baked method. Absolutely perfect! Glossy and crunchy on the outside (after toasting) and chewy on the inside. Only substitute I made was using whey in place of water. Next time I would like to try a cinnamon raisen variety and blueberyy! Topped with dried minced onion, sesame seeds, and left some plain.

I made these yesterday! I can't believe how easy they were! Instead of keeping them plain I made everything bagels with this recipe.... After taking them out of the boiling water and draining I seasoned them with onion and garlic flakes, poppy seeds, and seat salt, then baked them! They came out perfectly!

Thank you!!!!! We're expecting our second baby, and the biggest craving so far came along last night. Our favorite bakery didn't open in time for us to get there, so I made these. I made them into "everything" bagels by adding the toppings before baking. Amazing! They were so good... And so easy... I may never spend $11 for a dozen bagels again! This weekend, I will probably make some cinnamon raisin bagels using this recipe, too. :)

From my experience, the pan should be greased and floured, otherwise the bagels will stick and become deformed.

I've tried this recipe twice and both times I had very flat bagels.  The first time I mixed the yeast in the sugar water before adding it to the dry.  The bagels were flat by the time they hit the water. The second I followed the recipe exactly and the bagels flattened after they came out of the water.  They tasted okay, just super flat!

These are simple and delicious! I had left over whey from making cream cheese, so I subbed it in for water in this recipe. I also proofed my yeast by mixing it with a tablespoon of sugar and the whey for 5 minutes before I added everything else.

YUM! very tasty and easy to follow. after reading reviews about the size, i decided to cut back on the amount of bagels to 8, but they were a little big for us, so next time i will try the 12 if not 10.

Easy to follow recipe and a great starting base. I ended up using about 2.5 cups flour in the dough after mixing the wetter dough.

I would probably up the salt or add other flavors in the future. I brushed mine with egg and added sesame seeds before tossing them in the oven, but I think they would have been a bit bland if I hadn't.

flat, 7 minutes seems too long to boil I think it absorbed water and ruined them.

Very authentic texture and taste, makes a smaller size bagel than you're typical baagel shop but I like the smaller portion better anyway.

Wonderful recipe, I got up early to make these for my dad and sister, I actually made them into breakfast sandwiches with egg and cheese and we all loved them. Suggestion: sprinkle some shredded hard cheese (I used a Kraft blend of asiago/romano) before popping in the oven, very yummy. Definitely be sure to spray the baking pan enough, they can be tricky to remove cleanly.

Great recipe, a tad yeasty, but i'm sure that depends on brand and such.  Next time I will tweak it.  Still a thousand times better than the cheap store bought kind.  Thanks much much

Nice bagels, but not the dense types that I like. These bagels were chewier. Another problem was that there was too much salt in it. Having said all that, this was a really good bagel recipe for newbies to bagel making, like myself. It was so easy to make and tasted so nice (even if not dense) that I made two batches in one day. But, as other reviewers have commented, they are a smallish-sized 12 bagels. Bagels I've bought from stores were double the size of my bagels.

GREAT recipe!  The recipe was very easy to follow and the bagels turned out delicious.  The next time I make them, I'll experiment and add poppy seeds, sesame seeds, cheese, etc.

These are incredible!  Before baking, I brush them with an egg wash and leave them plan or top with sea salt, asiago cheese or cheddar cheese and garlic.  Yummy!!

This was my first time making bagels, and they turned out pretty well.  I think they taste a bit salty, so I might cut back a bit next time.  I used whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose flour, and the taste and texture were just fine.

Excellent!  Delicious with a nice crust!  I opted for broiling then boiling, and they turned out beautifully!  They take a little time, but you may never buy grocery store bagels again.

Great recipe!! Finally they came out well. On my second attempt they where fine. As other reviews suggested I did; 1. First rise for 30 minutes in a warm place (inside my oven with light on. 2) rise for 35 min. 3) Broiled them for 1 min each side before putting them in water. Next time I will try to brush them with egg + watter and some seeds. As we live in Barcelona (Spain) I do not have to go out any more to look for bagels in town

I love this recipe!  Today I made my 7th batch and I must say they came out absolutely beautiful!  The only change I made was to the boil time.  When I boiled my first couple of batches for 7 min they had gooey spots that would not bake out.  All other batches I only boiled for about a min. on each side and that has corrected the problem. I have moved on to using whole wheat flour and I am now ready to add flavorings!

Delicious. Made them exactly as stated but did let them rise longer (about an hour).  I did make a couple less bagels to make them bigger. Tasted fantastic out of the oven with some butter.

The texture was great, but the flavor was very bland.  I added sesame seeds on top, but would recommend doing something much more flavorful like onion or garlic.  I also highly recommend broiling before boiling.  The browned outside was the source of most of the flavor.  Also, be sure to make the center hole really large.  My holes completely closed in once the bagels rose.

This is an excellent textbook bagel recipe. Texture is good, steps are easy to follow without any unnecessary ingredients. The flavor is a bit plain for my liking, but after adjusting and adding accordingly to get the taste you like this is a wonderful recipe to keep around.

I definitely agree with the other reviewers that this recipes is for 12 small bagels... I didn't listen to them and made 12 and hoped they would rise more but didn't... next time I will try and make bigger bagels and let them rise longer... also when I shape them I will try a technique I found one another recipe where you poke the whole threw and then twirl it... also I want to try making different varieties... the ones I made were whole wheat and tasted very delicious... I put cornmeal on my baking sheets to make them more authentic... I will definitely try again...

This was my first time making bagels. This recipe was easy to follow and they turned out well. I did broil them before I boiled as suggested. I only made a half batch of plain bagels and served them with apple butter. I'm looking forward to making these again soon and playing with the flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness!  I can't believe I am a bagel maker!  They were fun to make. It was pretty easy although took some time.  After boiling I dipped the tops in different toppings: cinnamon and sugar, parmesan and garlic, poppy seed, and I just buttered the tops of a couple and left them plain.  I followed others advise and made 8 large bagels.  They were amazing in texture and flavor.  I will definitely make these again.  I was so proud of the outcome.

I followed the directions but made 8 instead of 12 like reviewers suggested. After I shaped them into bagels, they rose beautifully! They looked great but after the water bath, they were all wrinkled and looked horrible. I was hoping after baking, they'd look like bagels again but they didn't.

I never thought I was going to be able to pull this one off! :) But we did! Very good and now we don't have to go out and buy bagels anymore. Can't wait to experience with different flavors! We also had to wait about 35-40 minutes for them to rise.

I was cautiously optimistic when I printed this recipe; it seemed straight forward and the reviews consistently commented on how easy it was.  Well, I made these last night and I can't believe I waited so long to try these out!  Nothing compares to the taste of freshly baked bagels.  I made 8 good-size, relatively uniformly shaped bagels.  My second batch was gummier than the first, but that was probably due to boil time.  I do think these taste a bit "english muffiny", but perhaps that can be fixed by working more flour into the dough?  I'll be trying these again soon to work on my technique and experiment with different toppings!

These were wonderful. I've never made bagels before, and was sure I would mess them up at least the first time, but in spite of myself they turned out just great.  I did let the dough rise for an hour after reading another review, and it was a little yeasty for me, but the end product was still just as great.  Will definitely be making this again!

I'm a NY/NJ transplant and have been looking for a good bagel shop in Atlanta for quite a while to no avail.  I thought I'd give this recipe a try and they turned out excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT authentic American bagel!! I loved it and will definitely make these regularly! Only problem was that the dough just wouldnt bake in the middle no matter what I did - but prob due to an error on my part than the actual recipe. Thanks! :)

Overall the bagels came out pretty well.  The only thing that could be better is the consistency of the bread.  It came out a bit chewy instead of soft but this was the first time I made it and it was probably because we spent too much time with the dough and killed the yeast, which probably didn't allow the bagels to rise properly.  But we enjoyed them nevertheless.  I made it with whole wheat flour.

VERY GOOD big hit w/the family! this was my first ever attempt at bagels and i was scared.  the kids helped me w/the kneading and then we rolled the dough out to about 1ish inches thick and used a large cookie cutter to make them flower shaped. i also broiled them first at 575 for 3 minutes per the author's notes.

These are WONDERFUL, and this was the first time I ever made bagels!  I replaced a little less than half the flour with whole wheat, so I needed 1/2 cup of flour less than stated in the recipe, and as other reviewers had suggested, I made 8 bagels instead of 12 and they look, smell, and taste PERFECT. I am completely happy.  I boiled them in a deep, wide skillet. This way I fit 4 big bagels at once, which was very convenient. Thanks so much for the easy and awesome recipe!

GREAT recipe! Great taste and texture like an authentic bagel. Chewy and scrumptious! you have to try this if you like chewy authentic bagels, way better than some of those bagels at stores that are just a rounded piece of bread with a hole in the middle. Now these are Bagels!

I made these bagels yesterday. They are fantastic! I made two batches, one plain and one with blueberries. The plain ones are good but seem to be missing something for me. For a plain bagel they are good though. I didn't change anything in the recipe except to let the dough rest for 30-40 min. prior to shaping and then another 30 min. rest after shaping. I had no issues with the bagels falling while or after boiling like some other reviewers said. Not sure why they had that happen. I did lightly grease my baking pan with olive oil and baked with the wettest side up. I let them drain a bit on another sheet before baking. Will definately try making onion or chocolate chip bagels next time. The blueberry are awesome as well. Get creative and try some experiments. These are worth making over and over again IMO. As for quantity, I made various sizes in the first batch and got 14. The second batch made 11. Any bigger I think would be too big. They seem small at first, but they raise and then raise more when boiled. Thanks for such an easy bagel recipe. I've wanted to make bagels for some time and now that I have, I won't be buying them again :)

These were really easy to make, and tasty!  They're a little different than store-bought bagels, but very good!  One reviewer said not to bake them as long, so I baked them for about 25 minutes, but I think the full 30 minutes would have been better.

I have made close to 30 batches using this recipe and LOVE them! I started using the broil-then-boil-then-bake technique but found that boiling-then-baking turns out much better. I make 8 extra large bagels per batch (my husband likes to use them for sandwiches), add gluten and even a little pinch extra of active yeast per batch. A bread baking tip in case you were a novice like myself, make sure you allow the bagels to rise in a VERY warm environment. I read that turning on an oven to 300 degrees for a minute or so will make a perfect environment for bread rising (80-90 degrees); it will make your bagels MUCH bigger!

These have to be the BEST bagels I have made to date.  I have tried other bagel recipes but these are just so wonderful.  It could be that I am perfecting my baking technique or it could be the recipe, to be honest I think it’s the latter!!!  The inside was soft, where the outside had a bit of a crunch.  I used the same ingredients but I do make these in a slightly different way, I always use a large round cookie cutter to shape the bagels and then a smaller size to cut out the hole.  I find this saves so much time.  As I wanted large bagels I make 10 instead of the recommended 12.  I was able to boil 3 or these at the same time, sprinkled cornmeal on the bottom of the baking tray, and topped the bagels with grated Asiago cheese.  I also made a batch containing chocolate chips for my youngest son.  Totally delicious, unfortunately we have eaten them all already!

Ummm...I'd say they're only decent. Perhaps because I'm a Montreal girl, and well, Montreal bagels are actually fabulous, I was disappointed with the outcome. Not what I was expecting. They were strangely bready in the center. Not bad, but not great. I'll stick with my local bagel shop in the future. Unfortunately.

Excellent bagels. Very simple and really tasty. We used Kernel seasons popcorn seasonings for the toppings on our bagels. I ordered a nice variety from their website. This is a keeper!

These are the best bagels we have ever had. My dough only took about 3 1/2 cups of flour and 25 min to cook. We made ours into 8 bagels because we had planned on using them to make bagel pizzas - we ate them plain instead. We dipped 4 of the bagels in sesame seed before baking and boy were they good. I plan on putting some jalapeno in the next batch. Thanks for the recipe!

These were surprisingly easy!  I followed the recipe to a "T", until it came to rising time.  I took the advice of many reviewers and allowed the bagels to rise for 30 min.  I then boiled them w/a TBSP of sugar AND one of molasses.  I only boiled for about 1 min to 1 1/2 min each side.  I then placed them directly on a cookie sheet that was sprayed w/PAM and doused w/corn meal.  I baked for about 16 min w/very minimal stickage.  TY for a great easy bagel recipe; I can't wait to try many variations!

I never knew it was this easy to make my own bagels!!!  :)  I followed the recipe exactly when assembling the ingredients and formed them into 8 bagels that I let rise for 30 minutes.  I then boiled them in water with the sugar & a tbs of molasses and baked them for 30 minutes on a cookie sheet greased with vegetable oil.  They turned out perfectly with a crunchy exterior and soft in the middle!!!  I made 2 plain ones, 2 with melted asiago cheese on top (which I guess I should have put on about 1/2way through, since it got super brown...oops), 2 with garlic salt sprinkled on them and then the rest (MY FAVE) I dipped into a mixture of dill, thyme, basil, oregano, garlic powder and grated parmesan.  Honestly, I am so proud of how these guys turned out and plan on making them again soon and playing with all of the fun possibilities.

This bagel recipe was outstanding! My husband was proclaiming his undying love for me after I fed him these! I followed the recipe very closely with only one minor change and one larger one. I added one extra tablespoon of sugar to the boiling water. I also brushed the bagels with olive oil and sprinkled them with grated Parmesan cheese before baking them. Wow! What a find!

I moved to Canada from the US a long time ago and one of the things I miss the most are REAL bagels the ones we get here and more like a bread not chewy really at all I tried this recipe and they turned out perfect and so easy to make. I have made a few flavors besides plain. I made garlic by adding a tbsp of garlic powder to the flour and then topped with garlic flakes when baking. I made cinnamon raisin adding both to flour mixture and a bit more sugar, and finally I made salt by using sea salt on top before baking. They all turned out great! This one is a keeper

This was a great recipe for Bagels.  I made it exactly as written, but split the dough before the first rise and made half into Very Berry bagels.  I added approx.  1/2 cup of mixed dried berries and kneaded it into the dough.  I then continued on as directed.  They turned out beautifully! I only made 8 because I wanted a little bigger bagel. I also heavily greased the baking sheet and sprinkled corn meal onto the pan prior to putting the bagels on the baking sheet.  I will definitely make these again.    Edited to add, 04/21/09, I froze some of the bagels to see how they would thaw.  I wrapped each bagel individually in press and seal wrap and then placed them all into a freezer bag.  I thawed them on the counter.  I toasted them up and they tasted just like when they first came out of the oven - delicious!

I took HYDROMONKEY10 advice and boiled the bagels in MOLASSES.  It worked like a charm.  I had some trouble with the second rise this was the first time I worked with yeast - live and learn.  This made 10 bagels I made 6 onion and 4 plain.  I used my stand mixer and it was very easy.

This is a great and simple recipe! Thanks Jandl. The only thing I changed was the portions. I felt this recipe was better suited for eight large bagels rather than the twelve small ones it produced the first time I tried it.
Bravo!

I'm a first time bagel maker so I don't have anything to compare these to, besides frozen bagels, or some from the bakery. The family thought these were great! Only complaint was that they were a little to hard to bite into...but that was coming from a child. I had no trouble biting into it.

I made 12 mini bagels out of this recipes. I made a mistake, by putting the fire on high and boiled the bagels, instead of simmering it. This caused the interior to be really dense. I should of also follow the other suggestion and let the bagel rise 30 minutes, instead of 20 minutes. There was way too much salt in the recipes too, maybe cut it back half of it. I had to cut the bagels up and season it with garlic powder Making it into bagel chips, hopefully someone will eat them. The only thing that i like about this was the crust on the bottom of the bagels. I probably will retry this again.... some time from now.

Maybe it's just because I'm a bad cook, but my bagels tasted kinda blah. They were a nice texture, but they didn't have much taste. Maybe I'll put some spices in the dough next time.

There was not enough dough for 12 normal sized bagels so mine turned out miniature. I greased the baking sheet and the grease burned the bottom of my bagels. They tasted okay but were a little tough and doughy.

Bagels turned out delicious.  I doubled the recipe but made the same amount of bagels for "jumbo bagels".  After the boiling process I dipped one side of the the bagels into a shallow dish of dried minced garlic, poppy seeds, onion bits & sea salt for home made "everything" bagels.  Yum!!  Thanks Jandl for the great recipe.

I thought these bagels were very good.  
My dad loved them.  I made these bagels,
and I am 13 years old, so they were 
pretty easy.

Unbelievable!
It's been quite a while since I started my search for the best home made bagels.
Looks like the search is over. My first attempt of this recipe produced excellent bagels, only too small. 
So, for my second attempt I decided to make only 8 bagels. The results were amazing:
Bagels, the way REAL bagels should taste! Watch your weight, people!

I love this recipe. It's so easy, and the bagels are great. Couple of changes that I made: I let them rise for 40 minutes before boiling, but that was in part because I used whole wheat flour which doesn't rise as much. Also, I added a tablespoon of baking soda to my water bath and boiled for three minutes instead of seven. They turned out so chewy and good. I'll definitely make these again.

These turned out wonderfully for our first time making them. My husband and I love asiago cheese bagels so we threw in garlic powder and cheese during the kneading time. Very easy, quick and delicious.

I made these last night and I have to say that these were some of the best bagels I've ever had. Such a simple recipe that took no time at all.  **ONE NOTE** I did follow the advice of one critical review from Jodi. (circa 11-26-11) that said to not boil the bagels for seven minutes. I boiled mine two mins max and baked for 25-30 mins. Again great recipe! Can't wait to make more!

I added a little baking soda to the water and didn't boil quite as long, maybe 5 minutes total. Great bagel!

I followed this recipe exactly as stated. Bagels turned out flat, kinda like they were squished flat because they just didn't want to puff up. Despite the appearance, they were very tasty! Just like store bought bagels! Tasty but very labour intensive. Worth giving it a try if you have time

This is my go to bagel recipe, they always turn out wonderful and delicious! I made them again today using half "white whole wheat" flour and they were still great. My tip is to not overcrowd the pot when boiling, if you give them room in there, they turn out bigger and better. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made these yesterday with a friend and they turned out awesome.  Gave half to another friend and she was raving about them.  They are not very hard to make.  either.  The only things we did differently were to put 1tbsp salt and 2tbsp honey in the water they were boiled in instead of sugar and we brushed the tops with egg whites before putting them in the oven to give them some shine.

Anyone who gives this less than 5 is crazy. SO easy and SO good!  The beauty of the boiled bagel is the density and chewiness, so they are naturally not going to be as puffy and large as other regular baked bagels, it's not a recipe "issue", not that I was irritated by reviewers who gave a "solid four" because of the size and lack of rising... No names mentioned....grumble.  This is da bomb recipe... Fool proof bagel perfection.

For my first time making bagels, this was a great recipe to start with. Very simple to follow. I modified the recipe slightly by adding sun dried tomatoes to the dough. Very tasty and I will be using this recipe again! :) Delicious! Especially with home made sun dried tomato butter.... mmm!

This recipe tastes amazing! A problem was getting them off of the baking sheet, but I can probably fix that. Another problem was that after boiling, they seemed to deflate and lost all of the poof. Maybe I'll try adding baking powder/baking soda next time. I also only needed 2 1/2 cups flour. All in all, a very good recipe!

I used the recipe for cooking time.  The dough was leftover from a batch of whole wheat baked donuts.  I just added more flour.  BUT... Thanks so much for telling me to boil these for 7 minutes.  They became huge and look really great.

AMAZING!!!! Who knew you could boil bagels? Tastes great toasted, buttered, and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  You could also make whole wheat boiled bagels if you substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour.  Great recipe!

Followed recipe, but they needed 39 minutes. (Oven thermometer confirmed the temp.) Even so, they were gummy inside and needed toasing.  Won't throw them out, but we were sadly disappointed.

Awesome plain bagel, I added some coarse salt on top before baking.  Divided the dough 1/2 and added 1/2 cup raisins and 1 tbsp cinnamon to dough.  They turned out great!

This was my first attempt at making bagels and they were delicious! I was a little worried about if they had risen enough, but after I broiled for five minutes before boiling, they rose a LOT. With that, (on my first time with this recipe) the shape expanded so much that I lost the whole in the middle. In the end , they still tasted good but the appearance was a bit off. The second time though, I was prepared for this and made the whole way bigger and the whole thing shorter. They look perfect! The only other issue I had was getting them off the pan. I did grease it, but it was still a little difficult. In the end, most of them came off successfully. You can really add anything to these, as I've experimented with. I've done sesame seeds on top before baking, cheese on top, dried cherrie with little cashews and cinammon sugar, cinammon raisin, etc. So don't be afraid to play around with it! I've never had a bad batch :)

They are a little bland - but this is the perfect starter recipe to make other flavored bagels. I like how it didn't use nearly as much yeast as other recipes. We made ten and thought they were the perfect size. It was definitely hard to make the holes big enough to not close - but as we used them for breakfast sandwiches, the blandness and holes were not an issue.

I'm giving this recipe 2 stars because the inside turned out soft and mushy while the outside was hard. When I removed them from rising to put them into the boiling water, they shrunk instantly, even though they had risen for 45 minutes. They stuck to the pan, and it fell apart when I used a spatula to take them off of the pan. I would not make them again.

I must have not used enough yeast, although I did as the recipe called for, the taste was excellent, but the bagels didn't raise like they should have, I checked my yeast to be sure that the date was good, and it was.  Next time I'll use more yeast. It was my first time for making bagels from scratch, and my husband and I really liked them, I'll do them again as soon as these get eaten.

I used kosher salt and didn't have a problem with the saltiness. I don't think I added enough flour to the first bagels I made, but the ones with enough cooked up beautifully. I used all-purpose flour, and had to measure out 1 tablespoon of yeast as I don't use bag packaged yeast. This was my first time making bagels and loved that I didn't need to add any fat!

I made the bagles following the recipe exactly and used the method of broiling them a bit first. They didn't really rise enough and stayed very small and dense, could've been my fault but i sually don't have problems with bread making. I will try again because the flavour was great.

I was so disappointed with this recipe, especially after the prep time.  I make bread (no bread machine) pretty much every weekend because I don't like what is on the store shelves.  Although the local grocery store bakery makes a pretty good bagel, they don't understand supply and demand and are out more times than not; so decided to try this recipe.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of sprinkling the tops with Sesame seeds after the water bath.  I baked for 40 minutes because I could see they were not done yet, but that wasn't enough there were still uncooked areas.  Even after toasting and adding some butter, they just didn't have very good flavor.  On the hunt again for a good bagel recipe.....

Baking is not really "my thing".  But these bagels are very easy to make and look like bagels from the bakery.  I did the broil method and finished them in my convection oven - mine baked up in 17 mins.  Fantastic!

I made these almost as directed... the only difference is I let them rise for an hour instead of 20 min. They were wonderful, although next time I might cut down on the salt. They were great as is though too!

I haven't made bagels in years and wanted a good recipe to impress my coworkers, these bagels came out bad!! The dough never rose and the bagels came out flat, hard and really chewy, there were even spots of gooey boiled dough that never baked properly, they were awful. I would definately NOT recommend this recipe to anyone.

I substituted the sugar for malt powder in the bagel mixture. And, instead of sugar in the boiling water, I used baking soda. I didn't have to boil them for a full 7 minutes, it was more like 2 minutes a side and I baked them in the oven at 450 degrees for 5 minutes.

I just got done making and eating one of these.  This was my first attempt at making bagels.  I am shocked at how easy and how delicious!  I did broil my bagels and used molasses instead of sugar.  After boiling my bagels, I sprinkled them with poppy seeds.  I can't wait to surprise everyone with homemade bagels tomorrow morning.  Next time I'm going to try making onion bagels and blueberry bagels!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I've really been into yeast doughs lately. This was my first time making bagels.  Loved the simplicity of this recipe!  The only change I made was to activate the yeast in sugar and warm water first.  I actually halved the recipe and made about 14 mini bagels for brunch and topped them with the following homeade cream cheese spreads:    -To 1 cup of cream cheese, add finely chopped walnuts and honey.  Spread on halved mini bagel and top with walnut half and drizzle tiny bit of honey around.    -To 1 cup cream cheese, add a couple T. each of minced carrot, celery, onion, radish, garlic, dash of hot sauce, and pinch of salt. Spread on halved bagels and top with a sliver of smoked salmon.    - To 1 cup cream cheese add some crushed pineapple and finely chopped strawberries.  Spread on halved bagels and top each with slice of strawberry, peach, and pineapple.

I wish my stomach were bigger so I could wolf more of these bad boys down!  Even when I left them under the broiler for 3 minutes (ooops) they were NOT burnt, the water must have remoisted them.  Next time I will make the holes bigger, as they swelled shut during baking.  The one deviation... I let mine rise for an hour fifteen, which made them extra puffy.  SOOOO good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh wow, this was my first attempt at bagels too. Sooo, yummy! The only thing I'm sorry about is telling my husband that I made them. I could eat them all myself. I followed the advice of others and let the dough rise for 30 minutes at the first rest. I made 8 large bagels. I also let it rest 30 minutes at the second rest. After boiling I dipped some into toasted sesame seeds, some into honey and oats and left some plain. I also baked on a greased pan with corn meal sprinkled on it. Just awesome!

Those taste more like bread than bagel. Besides, the salt NEEDS to be cut down. I only used 1 tsp and it was already salty enough; put in 1 tbsp and I bet you'll get nice soft fluffy pickles.

this recipe was excellent and very easy to make. the only adjustment was that I used 1 1/2 Tsp of Salt instead of 1 Tablespoon of Salt, and they came out perfect just the right amount of sweet and saltyness.

I like the short proof time for this recipe, and the simplicity.  I did need to tweak it a bit though.  I found the best method is to make 8-10, and definitely go with the pre-broil.  It helps to make a skin and keep the air in the bagels when you put them in the water. I prefer to only boil for 15-30 seconds on each side to prevent flattening and also to get a crispier skin.

Easy recipe. Turned out great! Cheated and used the dough cycle on my breadmaker to make the dough. Then after boiling I sprinkled with poppy seeds. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I'm not sure why people keep saying the bagels are so small.  They start out that way, when you first divide them into 12 portions, but they rise. And really, wouldn't we as fat Americans be a little better off with smaller portions? :) I divided the batter out into 4 bowls and added serrano pepper and cheese to one, cinnamon, blueberries, and then italian herbs to the others.  I put that all in before adding the last bit of flour to make the stiff dough.  They turned out great... a little different from Panera, but great, nonetheless.

I thought these bagels were VERY good! I like a little crisper outside, so I flipped them in the oven halfway through the baking process.  I also used half wheat flour, half white flour and substituted honey for the sugar in the recipe - turned out fantastic!

Delicious!  These are light, great tasting, and easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The bagels did stick to the pan badly, even though it was well greased, so the next time I will dip each bagel in cornmeal before I place them on the baking sheet.

I make this recipe regulary and love it.  However, my bagels come out slimy around the edges and the middle hole?  What am I doing wrong?  I boil them and put them right in the oven and I take them out when they are golden brown, but this still happens - any suggestions?  Less boiling time?  Longer baking time with perhaps lowering the temperature?

Excellent recipe! 
These guys expand in the simmering water so be careful just how many you put into the pot. At one poster's suggestion, I used molasses in the water and they all turned out just fine. I brushed them with an egg wash and put sesame seeds on top. Very, very good!

These were great! A good weekend project, they do take awhile. The recipe made 8 large bagels. I used bread flour for a better texture.I rolled half of them in poppy seeds before baking.

I found this recipe needed extra proofing, but they came out wonderful.  It is so easy to make alterations for different flavors.   From this basic recipe I was concocted Coriander-Guava, Parmesan-Garlic, and Cinnamon-Sugar bagels that were superb! So easy too!

This was my first attempt to make begels, and I would say it was not difficult to make. However, mines turned out very ugly. The mistake I made was re-forming bagels after they had risen. The dough had risen beautifully but was very sticky. This resulted in the dough sticking to a spatula and a pan. I couldn't transfer begels from the pan into the boiling water. That's why I re-formed begels... They also glued to greased cooking sheets when I baked. Perhaps I didn't grease enough on cooking sheets.... though I don't know why my dough became so sticky. (I followed the recipe precisely.) I will definitetely try this recipe again and see how it goes. Anyway, I give 4 stars because the taste and texture were really good. And could anyone help me how to make less sticky dough!??

I love this recipe and make it about once a month - whenever I get a craving for fresh bagels (since there aren't any good bagel shops around here).  I've always done the broil before boiling method and they come out nicely.  They've never risen a ton for me before baking, but puff up in size quite a bit during baking.  I've also made different varieties with blueberries, raisins and cinnamon, and topped with cheese.  They all come out yummy.  They're delicious fresh, but do get dry if you don't eat them all within the first day or two (which isn't often a problem).  I usually make fewer larger ones instead of a bunch of small ones, too.

I've made these bagels several times since finding this recipe. My roommates loved them! They were very easy to make! My roommates especially loved wheat bagels with cranberries and walnuts.
The only thing with this recipe is that it doesn't make enough! I tried doubling the recipe, and the dough was so hard to knead, and so they didn't rise as much. Perhaps that's just me though.

I used bread flour and couldn't use the whole 4 1/2 cups. I had about 3/4 cup left that I couldn't knead in. What is whole wheat flour that a lot of people mention using? Is it like wholemeal or what? I'm so confused!

Good recipe.  I live in a place with no bagels so it was so awesome to eat a nice chewy bagel.  Make sure not to re-form the bagel after it has risen or else you might get a clumpy bagel.  They need all the salt the recipe calls for.

Great Recipe!  The flavor was so good.  I put cinnamon and raisins in the dough.  I will probable let them rise longer next time, just to see if they are lighter.

I used half whole wheat flour and half regular.  These turned out really well.  Not too difficult and great flavor.  I did let them rise longer on the first rise and probabl will let them rise longer on the second rise next time.  I also used more sugar as recommended by some others.  Overall, a great recipe!

These were OK.  They're best eaten shortly after being baked.  The outside was nice and crispy and the inside was warm and fluffy...but the next day, they're too chewy. When I make these again, I'm going to tweak the recipe a bit to see if I can improve th flavour and texture.

This is a very simple recipe that can be made exactly according to the directions and are very good.  I also substitued 1 and half cups of flour with whole wheat flour and they were still execlent.  I did follow someone elses suggestion and used mollasses in the water.  It gives them an intresting flavor.

A great recipe if you've got some time.  I've never made bagels before this, but these came out perfectly and taste great.  I had a lot of fun with this and it's quite simple, but it does take some time to do it all.

This is my first time making any type of bread. Be warned though, make 12! They look small when you are shaping them but they boil and bake better when they are smaller. If you make them bigger be sure to boil and bake longer.

Mine were tasty, but rather ugly.  I would recommend oiling both sides of the bagels before the broiling step.  When I turned them, they stuck and looked fairly awful.  I also made 9 bagels because there just wasn't enough dough for 12 good-size bagels.

This was my second attempt at a Bagel recipe and I just loved it! I only wanted to make 6 so I halved all the ingredients and then had it converted to the Australian metric system, they were on the smaller side of bagels but Super Tasty... will definatly do them again.

DUMMY PROOF! thank you thank you thank you! I am usually bad with working with yeast! crusty out side moist inside. I did add some sugar to the water and did an egg wash to adhere the sesame seeds. thank you for making this so early and tasty! I usually have such a hard time to get any yeast to rise this was perfect. I did allow them to rise for over and hour. until they doubled in size

Thank you for the recipe . Bagels taste ok but do not look good. Therefore I think , maybe 2 packs of yeast is too much

This is a really good recipe. Very tasty and great texture. The only thing I changed was the amount of time to boil the bagels. I boiled them for 2 minutes, 1 minute on each side. That was perfect.

I loved this recipe, these bagels are by far the best bagels  I have ever eaten. although, it did make my kitchen aid mix master start to smoke. I recommend mixing with your mixers and the knead it with your hands. my friend and I had a great time making these bagels. over all I would make them again in a heart beat.

This was my first time making bagels. Will definitely be making these again. After reading several reviews I ended up boiling them for only 11/2 min per side. I only made 8 from this recipe. I also baked them for only 22 min but my oven tends to run hot. This recipe got the double thumbs up from my teenage sons and husband.

edit: my first try, 4 bagels came out good ! I looked at the other bagels and they puffed up! I used the quick acting yeast! But on the second try , I waited 4 hours because I self , pulled the dough out the fridge , brought the water to a boil! Put the bagel in for one minute each side! Transfer them to a baking pan , Sprinkled garlic salt on top ! Made sure your temp is at 425 ! And wow I made some bombbbb zzz bagels

I've made bagels before, but misplaced my recipe. I found this and gave it a try. The bagels came out nicely formed, however the flavor was very, very bland. We had to smother them in cream cheese. If I used this recipe again, I'd up the salt and sugar to enhance the flavor.

These bagels were EXCELLENT! I just had one today and it was so good! I used the advice of the reviewers and put 2 TBSP of extra water and another reviewer said to use molasses instead of sugar in the boiling water and it came out Fantastic. I'm from New York and it tastes just like a New York Bagel :)

I made these and they smelled delicious as I was baking them, however, I am afraid that I crowded them during the boiling process, which lowered the water temp, and resulted in a wet product going into the oven.
The next time I will boil them 3 or 4 at a time so that they all have room to float.
The final product was tasty, but the texture was off due to my errors in boiling.

I should have read the reviews that said to only boil for 1 minute on each side instead of 7 minutes total. They've been in the oven for 45 minutes and the center is still soggy and gooey.

I'd also recommend using parchment paper to line the pan instead of greasing it. Even greasing the pan liberally, they still stuck to pan.

I  just made this recipe. The bagels turned out very good. I  will have to make some minor tweaks. I  have  a  convection  oven so I  had to drop the temperature  to 325 and bake them for 28 minutes. I  doubt store bought bagels will remain in my future.

The Bengals didn't rise as high as I thought they would. I wish I knew what size to make the bagels when shaping them in order for them to turn out best.

Great recipe. I followed the advice of adding molasses to my boiling water and it was a great addition. I also shortened the boil time to two minutes on each side and I let mine rise for about 35 minutes with a quick rise yeast. I only needed to bake for 25 minutes but my oven runs a bit hot. Overall, great basic recipe!! Easy to follow and bagels came out nice and chewy just like I wanted. I was not even patient enough to let them cool down before I tried it. Can't wait to have one for breakfast!

This is easily the easiest bagel recipe I've ever tried and I absolutely loved the process, the reason i docked a star was my dough turned out a little bit on the salty side. Did anyone else have this problem? Easily could've been a mistake on my part as I only had a 1/2 teaspoon measure on hand and easily could've counted weird. Either way 10/10 recommend to beginners. Really enjoyed making these!

Wow.... such an easy recipe.  Absolutely love it. Made them exactly as the recipe states. Once out of the water and onto the baking sheet, I added salt to some and then salt, galic and onion powder to the others.... they came out DELICIOUS. I  will definitely be making these quite often..

These are great, and so far, have frozen well. I just thaw them in the microwave, split and toast them. I did brush some with water right before baking on a stone, and sprinkled kosher salt on them.

Great recipe.  I just inhaled one 15 mins out of the oven.  I toasted it with cream cheese and it was so delicious, a little on the salty side which I love.  I only made six and baked them for 35 mins.  They came very close to burning on the bottom,  so next time I'll leave them in for 33 mins and they should be perfect.  I did let them rise for 50 mins the first time, then 20 mins the second time.  Also activated the yeast in warm water for 10 mins before adding the dry ingredients.

Followed this recipie exactly except I boiled for less time, greased the baking sheets as well, bagels burnt to the baking sheets within 5 minutes of going in the oven.... Not sure what I did wrong. After all that work I had To throw them all away....

My end result was kind of ugly, but they have a great flavor. I will make these again and hopefully improve my technique.

For starters, thanks Jandl for posting this recipe. Like most reviewers I made a few adjustments. I'm not a big fan of adding yeast directly to the flour, so I mixed the sugar/water/yeast mixture separately. Added that to the flour after 10-12 minutes. I used a 4" cup to cut my bagels and ended up with 9. I added molasses to my water over sugar and the final product ended up glossy and tender. My wife enjoys the 'everything' type bagel so I took 1/2 tablespoon of sesame seed, dried minced onion, garlic powder and chia seed. Toppings were applied after the boil step, as they were ready for the oven. Lastly, I left mine covered with a dry kitchen towel while they were cooling down. I'm not a big fan of crispy or hard crusted bagels and the towel traps the moisture keeping the crusts though and durable with no crunch. They are as good as people say. A tad on the time consuming side, but all good things take effort. Happy baking all!

This was my first attempt at making bagels. I do not have an electric mixer, so mixing was all by hand, which I'm sure altered the result. Also, I only had a glass pan to bake them in. good bagels, will make again soon.

Best bagel I have made.  Pretty much stuck with the recipe, with 2 minor tips. Once you have made the hole in the dough with your thumb, stick both index fingers in, and make ever widening circles, stretching as you go. You are done when the hole is 2 inches wide.  the hole will tend to grow shut as the dough expands. Dip the bagel bottom in flour and place on waxed paper. The floured bottom keeps it from sticking.  You don't want to destroy your bagels shape prying it off the paper.  Let rise 15 or 20 minutes then put the tray in the frig for about an hour. They will rise there and be a lot easier to handle. I boiled mine 2 minutes on each in hard boiling water, not a simmer. I drained them on a wire rack before baking. Do not bake on waxed paper. That's just to keep them from sticking to your working surface.

After spending hours in the kitchen following instructions to the letter (digital thermometer to ensure the water was exactly the right temp, bought the yeast last night to ensure it was good, etc.) and after all that work I ended up with heavy doughy messy lumps.  Very disappointed.

I have made a lot of bread but never bagels.  Everything that went wrong was my own fault, one rolled off on its way out of the pot, my stove does not like to simmer and I moved them around on the baking sheet and wiped off some of the cooking spray and those stuck.  There was also the pressure of himself going through the fridge to pick out what he was going to put on his bagel... 

I didn't get any soggy bagels but I put them right in the oven from the pot, didn't wait until they were all done.  Will be trying this again and adding garlic and poppy seeds!

Excellent recipe!! I have never cooker bagels, this was a first timer for me, but as you can see from the picture, they turned out great! 
My husband loved them too!!!
Just a slight change:
1) I didn't broil them
2) I boiled them for 2 minutes per side
3) Need to cook less than 30-35 minutes, as you can see from pic they came a bit too dark
Other thank this, WONDERFUL!!! Thanks for this recipe :D

Very happy with the results.  I used the broiled option and boiled the bagels for only 2 minutes per side.  I made 10 larger bagels.  I've topped some with sesame seeds and made some cinnamon raisin in addition to the plain.  Very good!  I anticipate making several other variations in the future.  Thanks for a great recipe!

First time making bagels ever BUT with the new year brought us a resolution to reduce our processed food intake but we LOVE bagels. Well! Thank goodness I have a Kitchen Aid because this was some tough dough. I followed the recipe. The first 6 I made were ugly but hole crow they were delicious! Crispy on the outside. Chewey in the middle. Yum. Thr second half of the dough I made smaller and incorporated cinnamon and sugar. Those are still in the oven. I am trying to think of all the ways that I can make bagels. I can't wait to try them on a sandwich!

I MADE BAGELS!! I can't believe it, and they were perfect the first time. I think next time I will try and add some of the toppings inside the dough. They are perfect plain, just as they are but become even better when you add toppings. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This is a great basic recipe, but there is a problem with one of the ingredients and some of the technique. The "1 T" of salt in the recipe should either be reduced to 1 t or added only to the boiling solution with the sugar. Boiling 7 minutes makes the end product soggy. Only boil 1-1.5 minutes/side. A lot of reviewers have said this is "bland": it *is* a basic recipe. Jazz it up with your own flavors. I also added 2 T oil to my dough for better texture.

This was my first time trying to make bagels and this was a huge success!  I took the other raters' advice and only made 8.  They were perfect.  My oven was hot so I cooked them at 350 for 30 minutes.  Just perfect.  Loved it!  Next time I'll try toppings!

I made these twice before writing a review since the first time I had to use a majority of whole wheat flour. In my opinion they turned out better with all-purpose, but I rarely use more than a 1/2 and 1/2 ratio when subbing whole wheat. Either way, good flavor, but they turned out a little flat - not as fluffy as I hoped.

These turned out loveley-looking and were easy to make, but I wasn't impressed by the flavor.  The all-purpose flour and no oil made it taste and feel like homemade bread.  I love homemade bread, but I was expecting a slightly different flavor.

Nice recipe.  I varied it just a bit by replacing 1/2 cup of AP with Rye flour and adding caraway seeds.  I son't see the need for the sugar in the water since I thought it gave the outside an off taste.  Next time I will omit it.  Thanks for sharing.

I just love this recipe.  I made them for the first time for my sister who couldn't have soy or dairy b/c of diet issues with her new born. She has been calling me asking for more. I used Olive Oil to grease the pan instead of Crisco or Butter, both of which contain soy.  I love them, I have made them 3 times in the past few weeks and even tried making them as dinner roll size bagels and they came out perfectly.  I watched them in the oven to make sure that they didn't brown to much when making smaller bagel balls.  I cut back on the salt the first time, but was daring the second and didn't....I didn't notice a huge difference and I definitely think you could go either way.  They have a good bagel taste.  I haven't embellished them yet with seasonings, but maybe soon.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

These bagels turned out as good as the local bagel shop!  I was so happy.  The only thing I did different is I flavored mine with some dry pesto mix and topped them with provolone cheese before baking (next time I won't add the cheese until the last 15 minutes of baking).

This is a wonderful recipe. I just rediscovered it after a few years. It's easy to halve this recipe. I didn't need nearly all the flour - be careful when adding it as too much will make the dough hard to work with.  After resting this dough is an absolute dream to work with. I used my KA mixer and put the dough hook on for the kneading portion.  I did  not broil, but my bagels were done and nicely browned in 28 minutes. So much better than store bought!

These were great! My family tried was SUPER impressed - including my hard-to-please mom. Obviously season as desired...I made some asiago bagels, some everything bagels, and some chocolate chip bagels. People seem to be very impressed when you say you made them from scratch. I also appreciate that it's one of the shortest prep/wait times I've seen for a bread with yeast.

I will never buy bagels from the store again! These are wonderful. I only made 1/2 the recipe as a test run. I think I'll be making these once a week now.  I did make 6, but should have made 4 as they were a bit small. I had no problem with sticking or burning. I placed a cooling rack on the sheet pan so the heat could move around the bagels, it worked well, they were nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I also brushed a little oil on top before putting in the oven. YUMMY!

The thing I like most about these bagels is that they aren't complicated to make.  I've made a couple batches now and have been pretty pleased with the results.  I would say they don't make the best plain bagels if that is what you are looking for (too strong of a yeast/flower flavor just plain).  But if you dress it up with some cinnamon/raisins, onions, or whatever your like, I think they work well.  Next time I want to try flavoring the flower with some different seasonings (onion powder or cinnamon for example) to bring out even more flavor.

I made these tonight and they turned out pretty good.  I split the dough in half and made one batch cinnamon raisin and the other half blueberry.   They were slightly more chewy than I would have liked, but over all they were pretty good.  I ended up with 10 normal sized bagels.

easy dough to work with...took shape well, fun to make...our only complaint? the sogginess from the boil...is there a way to combat this? maybe we ate them too soon from the oven, perhaps if they set to dry? was odd...will make again though, good recipe :)

I thought these were great! We tried the broil-boil-bake method & they were delicious. I think next time we're going to make fewer bagels but make them a bit bigger. I guess we're just used to bigger bagels! They're amazing straight out of the oven but are also good after toasting or reheating in the oven. I took 10 of this batch to work & they were gone quickly! Great recipe!

This was my first time making bagels and they turned out amazing. I made half of them onion bagels by adding dried minced onion and onion powder to the dough. A little time consuming but worth it if you're a bagel lover.

These were fantastic! My 2 year old helped me make them and they still turned out great. He added a bit more sugar to the mix, maybe 1/2 T and I put 1 T molasses and 1 T sugar in the boiling water. As per other reviewers I made these bigger and cut the dough in 8 pieces instead of 12 and let the rise again for 30 minutes. Way better than store bought and much cheaper too!!

Fantastic!!!! I split the recipe in half and it made six nice sized bagels. I jazzed mine up with rosemary, oregano and cheddar cheese. I can't wait to experiment with different flavors.

I used a gluten free flour blend and sprinkled poppy seeds on top before I baked them.  I followed others advice and made larger bagels, so I ended up with six bagels.  I have had no luck with yeast doughs before today, but these turned out great! I don't have to pay $6 for 6 tiny bagels anymore! Thank you for this recipe!

Great bagels!  Very easy for someone with not much experience in breads.  Came out looking like a real bagel and tasted great. I will for sure make again.

amazing!!! this is the first time I've ever made bagels, and I was debating between trying this recipe or another one but decided to go with this one. I'm glad I did. I made half a recipe to be on the safe side. I used whole wheat and white flour. I ended up not using all of the flour, about half a cup less. As per the suggestions of other reviewers, I let it rise for 30 minutes, added brown sugar to the water (I had no molasses) and only boiled them for a minute each side. I made 7 out of the dough, so they were smaller, and it took about 15 minutes to bake. I loved them! I can't wait to make them again and try variations now that I know it works.  I should also add that cause mine were smaller, I didn't have the problem of them cooking all the way through. And cause of the difficulty of them sticking to the pan like other people, I sprayed the pan with olive oil spray and sprinkled flour on it. I had no problem with sticking at all.

pretty good, a few minor problems though:  1. they were really hard not to burn and still cook all the way through!  2.they were a little on the salty side.  3. they were not quite as puffy as I had hoped but that may be my own fault. (I had to try to figure out how much yeast to use based on measurement not weight/packets because my yeast was in bulk. this was a tricky task which in the end I used 1 heaping tablespoon of instant yeast. next time I will maybe use more?)I was glad I followed other reviewers tips and let them rise for 30 minutes otherwise they probly would have been a total flop.  but overall not Bad, and I give the recipe grace since It was my forst time with bagels.

These are good; however, as a first-time bagel artist, I could have used a bit more guidance on a couple of points, i.e. how big to make the hole.  I ended up rolling my pieces into a rope and then attaching the ends with some water and semi-pinching.  I broiled one minute each side and also, boiled one minute each side after reading a lot of other recipes that recommended this shorter boiling time.  I did use a tablespoon of molasses in with the boiling water.  I used poppy/sesame/salt for one topping, and rolled dried cherries into some of them while shaping them.  I also topped the cherry ones with sugar which I would not do again because it makes the outside too sticky. My problem with these is the browning, er, burning on the bottoms...I baked for only 15-20 minutes because the bottoms were burning...I tried with just PAM on the bake sheets and with parchment paper...same problem both times.  Anyone have tips on this or on how they freeze once baked?

I used this recipe for my first time making bagels and it worked great! I added some minced onion flakes to the batter before i put the extra flour in, and i dipped the bagels after i boiled them, in a mixture of flax seeds, poppy seeds, onion flakes, and sesame seeds, and it made an awesome batch of everything bagels.

As far as I am concerned, this is a really good (or bad!) way to waste a day!  I followed the directions exactly except I let them raise for about 40 min.  They turned out flat and gooey. This was my first try as making bagels, but I would consider myself a quite experienced cook and I make numerous kinds of bread regularly.  Maybe they need less boilig time or a lower temp in the oven to cook slower, or maybe it's because I live in the mountains!  Don't think I will try this recipe again, maybe another one at some point...

I made these a few months ago. It was my first time making homemade bagels and it was surprisingly very easy. They tasted good, however they were a little tough. Also they didn't last very long. Only a few hours later they were hard as a rock, but microwaving them helped soften it up again. I will make them again eventually.

This was my first attempt at making bagels and they turned out wonderfully well.  The only change I made was I added a packet of onion soup mix (I omitted the salt) to the water before adding it to the flour and yeast.  After boiling, I rolled the bagels in a mixer of dried onion flakes(reserved from soup packet), poppy seeds, sesame seeds, caraway seeds, kosher salt and garlic.  Although a little time consuming, they are not at all difficult to make. From now on I will make my own instead of buying them in the grocery store.

I tried this recipe today - it wasn't bad.  I doubled the recipe and divided the batch into 3 - 1/3 were cinammon, 1/3 cranberry and 1/3 strawberry.  The cinammon and cranberry turned out great but the strawberry didn't turn out well.  I used a strawberry spread (somewhat like a jam but mostly fruit) and it made the dough too moist and the bagels fell apart and didn't bake right.

Excellent bagels.  Thanks!  A little gnarly looking, but oh well.  Some of them looked great.  I added sun dried tomatoes and roasted garlic to punch up the flavor, so I added a tiny bit more flour.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks!

I've made bagels in the past with a different recipe and they've always turned out great. But when I found a bagel recipe that took half the amount of time, I decided to give it a try. Unlike many people, I had absolutely no trouble making this dough into 12 equal regular sized bagels. The reason for only a 3 star rating is the fact that they did not bake well. I found they did NOT need the seven minutes of boiling as laid out and the baking time/temperature must be off, because the bagels did not fully cook after being 'golden brown' they cooked in parts but not others. They were more doughy than I would like them to be, but nonetheless good. I'll try again later and hopefully they will work better. But in the meantime, I'm sticking to my other recipe.

Great bagel recipe!! I think letting the dough rise more would help make the bagels less dense...but overall, very good. I got 8 large bagels from the recipe. Very good topped with cinnamon. I will definitely make these again! Thanks!

What a great recipe!! 
I  just made these with my kids and they came out soo great!! 
We added 3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and kneaded in the rest with white flour.
I also let it rise for 30 min. next time I might let it rise a little longer and see what happens. 
My kids and husband loved them! they were fun to roll with the kids too. Next time I think I'll sub honey for the sugar and add in some carob chips. these are great bagels.. no more perservative filled store bought bagels for us!! 
Thank YOU!!

I've made this now several times. I use garlic salt instead of regular salt and we love the flavor.  We like these so well I've been making them about every 3 days!  I use my kitchen-aid mixer for the whole job.

Came out perfect!  I replaced 1/2 all purpose flour with whole wheat and used the bagles for steak, egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches with sauteed peppers and onions.  Very good!  Also toasted and ate with butter and jelly; I will be making these again!

This was my first crack at making bagels and they turned out great. I used all whole wheat flour and made 8 instead of 12.  I also let it rise for 1/2 hour as per the other reviews.  There was a bit of a funny taste to them which may have been caused by too much yeast or salt.  This will be a weekly recipe!!!

Turned out great!!  Easy to add to and especially easy to send to a friend who is teaching himself to cook.  I wanted to start with something simple, easy to manipulate later and that he would enjoy.  This recipe covered all bases!!  Thanks.

the only reason this gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because there is no way this makes 12 bagels :) but for me it made 11 mini delicious bagels!! I really enjoyed these. Mine also sank to the bottom, but I just scooped them up with the spatula and then they floated on their own.
so yummy!!

I formed the holes and let them rise, but when I used a spatula to put them into the boiling water, they all sunk and I got flat bagels. I suspect there was something wrong with my technique rather than with the recipe. Other than the falling, they tasted good.

These were just ok.  I used about half whole wheat flour, and I used the broiling option.  The outsides were glossy as promised, but the insides were not the consistency of bagels.  They were just heavy, dense bread.
