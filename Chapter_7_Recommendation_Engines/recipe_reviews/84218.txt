I'm sorry, but we really didn't like this one. The ginger (which I love to cook with) was too much, and it didn't go well with the stout; the flavors combined to give the dish a fairly bitter taste. The only way we were able to eat it was to mix it with soba noodles and add a dose of soy sauce. We didn't even keep the leftovers. I think this might have been better with a sweeter beer, such as a honey brew or an amber ale. Thanks, anyway.

A yummy side dish, we had the family over when I made this and was careful not to overdo it on the Guinness! However, the beer and cabbage are an odd combination, but the flavours mesh well. Thanks for sharing, Barb!

This was a good cabbage dish.  We made it with some bratwurst for a nice fall dinner.  I think if I make it again, I will leave out the ginger though.  It gave it a peculiar aftertaste.  Not bad, just not necessary.

Not bad at all for cabbage. Had to use olive oil instead of pumpkin seed oil, may have affected the taste.

Yum!  Used regular green cabbage 'cause it's what I had on hand.  Hubby loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Great quick recipe. Loved it, with substitutions using what I had on hand. Peanut oil instead of pumpkin seed oil (wish I had thought to add actual pumpkin seeds), one large vidalia onion instead of shallots, and 6 cups of napa cabbage. I grated the Ginger instead of mincing and used Corona instead of Guinness(r). This was a big hit! Look forward to trying with red cabbage and Guinness
