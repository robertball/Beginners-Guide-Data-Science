So easy & very tasty I loved this. I used sour cream & onion potato chips a blend of different cheeses. Next time I'm going to add cooked & crumbled bacon to the layers.

Very tasty and a great easy side dish. I brought this to a potluck dinner and was giving out the recipe all night!

This was an interesting change of pace but I don't know that I'd make it again ("just ok" per Mr. LTH and "Nothing I'd order if I went somewhere"). Def worth giving a try but won't become a regular side dish here. TY for an interesting side dish!

What a creative idea! Since it is just the two of us and a baby I halved the recipe. I made one change; instead of using bread crumbs or potato chips I used cubed toasted bread with 'I can't believe its not butter' spread on both sides (used a total of four slices). I also added salt pepper garlic powder and parsley. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised at the taste--especially since I'm not exactly fond of tomatoes. Hubby enjoyed it too and our two year old enjoyed the bread and melted cheese. I highly recommend this dish to anyone who likes isn't afraid to try new things.

This was great. I changed the crackers to "vegetable thins" and added a layer of thinly slice zucchini. I also sprinkled italian seasoning in the middle. Turned out fantastic.

This was pretty good and definitely different. I used 1 cup of crushed potato chips and 1 cup of Panko breadcrumbs. Panko is a Japanese breadcrumb that is really crispy. I also sprinkled the whole dish with garlic salt also used sharp cheddar.

I made this recipe to use up an abundance of home grown tomatoes. I thought it would be more like a dip but oh my gosh...it made an awesome meal! I also used vegetable crackers and garlic salt between the layers and topped it with the panco breadcrumbs (for more crunch)...good advice! I served it with a bowl of soup and corn on the cob. We LOVED it and all of it's cheezy goodness! I will definitely make it again and again!

Very good though it was even better with a bit of garlic and a sprinkle of basil.

This is a good way to use up tomatos when you have to many.

I added in garlic salt and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I enjoyed the recipe but the Tomato Pie is better. I won't make this again.

I made this recipe almost as written except the topping I used gluten free crackers. Excellent!
