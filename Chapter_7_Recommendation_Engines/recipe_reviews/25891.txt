This was to die for!  To offset the cook's comment about it separating, I added 2-3 more potatoes and had no problem.  I doubled the recipe and 6 people ate it all--and all asked for the recipe.  Very rich, not for those watching caloric/fat intake, but absolutely yummy!

Very Good!  The gouda really adds a nice creamy texture to this dish.  I halved the recipe and baked in a loaf pan.  I was able to slice the potatoes evenly using the mandolin about 1/4 inch thick.  I sprinkled the cheese evenly through 3 layers, then the cream over the top.  I baked covered with foil the first 45 minutes.  Uncovered for 15 minutes. Will make again.

The BEST we've ever had!!  BUT - I did make some changes.   I started by slowly cooking 1/2 a vidalia onion (chopped) in butter.  Once tender, I added flour to make a roux, then added milk to make a thick white (bechamel) sauce.  I added salk and pepper to taste.  I sliced my potatoes, put one layer in a 13x9" pan, topped with a little salt and pepper, then half the sauce.  I topped this with a couple ounces of gouda chopped into cubes.  Then I repeated the process: potatoes, s+p, rest of the sauce, and another couple ounces of gouda, then baked for about an hour.  I usually make this exactly the same way but without the gouda.  Never again will I do this without gouda - it was PERFECT!  SO flavorful and a great consistency (I don't like them runny).  I forgot about garlic but I don't think it was missed.  SO easy and SO yummy!

I tried another, similar recipe recently and rated it five stars and still would.  But if that recipe was five stars, I’d rate this even higher if I could.  Very similar recipes, with very similar results, yet somehow this one really left me with a remarkable impression.  First, it requires no pre-cooking of the potatoes, which actually made them turn out far superior to those in the last recipe that required the precooking.  Second, the recipe calls for Gouda, and since I used the smoked variety, we were rewarded with a lot of extra flavor. In addition, the cooking time was low and slow, not only giving me ample “hands free” time to prepare the rest of our dinner, but it almost guaranteed the potatoes would be cooked through with deliciously melded flavors.  This was truly memorable.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I envision this being a terrific addition to pot luckss and school luncheons. I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and substituted sharp cheddar for gouda. It was crispy brown on top when complete. Thanks, Lisa  for a great dish.

Made this dish with Christmas Dinner and it was a smash hit.  I made extra layers of potatoes topping each layer with garlic butter and cheese.
Lightly sprinkled top with flavored bread crumbs.

My husband and I thought this was an excellent, quick recipe for potatoes. We used smoked gouda, I added a little thinly sliced onion and a mix of heavy cream and half & half. Cooked it until it was really browned and bubbly, yum!
No problems with seperation but would add more garlic next time, we love garlic.

This was amazing.  We absolutely loved the flavor.  It was so very easy to make and I did not change one bit of this recipe and got nothing from raves.  These are absolutely THE BEST au/gratin potatoes I've ever eaten.  These will definitely be made again and again!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I was concerned about the mixed reviews, but had some gouda cheese I needed to use up so I figured I would give this a try.  I had the same issue as other reviewers, even right out of the oven it separated and looked rather unappealing.  They tasted fine, I used a smoked gouda so the taste was also a little stronger.  My husband ate too helpings, but that may have been because he skipped lunch and was hungry.  I took a star away for appearance, on taste I would give a four.

Made this a second time for Easter, and it was off the hook AGAIN!  This time I had to make it for 20 people.  For the heavy cream, I substituted a mixture of evaporated milk & fat free half & half (made everyone feel better about eating them!).  I mixed all of the ingredients (except the potatos) in a bowl and added some chopped red onion (I think this made the flavor even better).  I then distributed the mixture evenly between three layers, instead of two. I also took another poster's advice and sprinkled a bit flour on top of each layer of potatos before spooning on the mixture.  I baked them for an hour covered and 15 minutes uncovered.  Had the leftovers (that I had to secretly set aside) today and they were much tastier than they were the last time.

I would say to those who found it separated and looked chunky to use a different potato than the red.  Russets really do work well in gratin dishes. Yes it changes the very base of it, but these are too waxy to absorb the liquid. Very delish otherwise.

This was great!  My only problem was that either the cook time or the temp was too low.  I followed the recipe exactly (even slicing the potatoes very thinly) and they were still crunchy after the recommended cook time.  I ended up microwaving the whole thing for 10 minutes and it came out fine.  To keep the cheese from separating, I tossed the shredded gouda in a zipper bag with about 1T of flour.  Worked like a charm.  My family has already asked me to make this again.

This dish was wonderful. Yes, it's got tons of calories, but it's worth it. My guests also raved about it. Because of past posts, I used more Gouda (9 oz) and extra garlc (7 to 8 cloves). I also didn't brown the garlic in the butter. Instead, I melted the butter and put the garlic in at the last moment to make it easier to spread in the dish. This is definitely one of my favorites! Not an everyday dish, though.

Used slicing attachment on my KitchenAid mixer to slice potatoes.  To reduce fat/calories, I cut butter in half, substituted LF evaporated milk for cream, and used 2% mexican cheese blend.  It turned out awesome!  My husband had no idea this wasn't the usual high fat dish he knows and loves.

Hmmmmmmm-not quite sure what I think about these. Overall the taste was good and I thought the gouda cheese was nice. However, the appearance-even when pulled right out of the oven - was not pretty. Looked pretty chunky. Overall, the taste was nice but I'm not quite sure if I'd make this again. Thanks anyways Lisa!

Fantastic! 4 stars because I made changes.  I cut recipe in half to server 2. Also reduced amount of butter(used leftover garlic herb butter bought for holidays) and used half and half instead of heavy cream. I melted garlic herb butter in sauce pan, added fresh crushed garlic cloves, half and half, salt and pepper and let it simmer until it was hot. Poured the hot mixture over potatoes and cheese and baked until it was golden and smell drove DH crazy.

This was a good base recipe which I changed only slightly.  Instead of heavy cream I used a can of evaporated milk (which tasted creamy and delicious by the way) and as far as the cheese, I used 1/2 smoked gouda and 1/2 fontina.

The end result was delicious, but I have a couple of suggestions that I think I will try if I make this recipe again.

1. I would increase the amount of garlic.  I used the 5 cloves according to the directions but was expecting a more noticeable garlic flavor.  

2. I would sauté the garlic/butter mixture before layering and pour 1/2 in the middle and half on the top to more evenly distribute these flavors.

2. I used 6 oz. of cheese but felt that mine could have used a little more.  maybe just a personal preference.

Overall, a nice recipe I would use again with the changes I just mentioned.

These potatoes were awesome!  My six year old thinks this recipe should get "six hundred stars" (and she doesn't usually care for potatoes at all).  The recipe doesn't need any altering.  I did, however, use half & half instead of heavy cream and they came out just fine.

Killer taters!!!!! I cherry smoked a ribeye roast medium rare (bout the same as prime rib) and served it sliced with these potatoes and some brandied cranberries. 
Nothing but raves.
These taters are outstanding and easy to prepare. Use your mandoline to slice the taters and use fresh garlic.

Delicious! Sprinkled the layers in between with a little flour to help with the separation that other reviewers mentioned. Cooked in a slightly smaller dish, so ended up with three layers of potatoes, topped with the garlic and cheese and sprinkled with a Parmesan to top for a little kick. Baked for 1 1/2 hours with thicker potato layers. Turned out perfectly!

This recipe was a hit at my family's Christmas Eve dinner.  It disappeared faster than any of the other dishes on the buffet.  It will become a regular for family gatherings from now on.

These were great! Followed the recipe except added onions. I cooked the potatoes a tad before slicing, I didn't have any issues with seperation but think you had to cook longer then suggested. I did cover with foil for 30 minutes, but I should have done it a bit longer, maybe 45 mins as the top was very brown and the potatoes just a tad undercooked. will adjust time. This was excellant with Ham on Easter and do not skip the Gouda (I used smoked) I think that is what makes this dish! Thanx I will make again!!

I thought this was good, but was hoping for a more "cheesy" flavor as I really love Gouda. I did love the garlic, especially the smell while baking. I did use skim milk because I completely forgot to pick up heavy cream at the grocery store!

Great recipe!! I took a leap of faith and made it for the first time when I had company coming and it was delicious!! We all went back for seconds. The only change I would make next time is adding more of the Gouda. Other than that this is a wonderful recipe.

I have made this recipe several times, exactly as it is, for one of our dinner parties.  Pretty much every time, someone requests the recipe.

I loved the addition of garlic, but think I'd be more apt to make au gratin potatoes the way I'm used to, starting with a roux, etc.  Used 1 cup 1% milk and 1/2 cup cream.  Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe for method and used the ingredients I had on hand.  I had yukon gold potatoes and I used a mixture of cheddar and jack.  I think it works well with any time of milk or cream you have on hand as well.  I followed the recipe as written other than my substitutions and it was great.  A nice change from typical au gratin potatoes.  Good for a special occassion meal.  I served this with flank steak and roasted asparagus for Valentine's Day dinner.

Absolutely fabulous!  My family couldn't get enough of it....I left the peels on the potatoes, adds some color and nutrition that way.  I also added more gouda since it is my favorite cheese.  Will make again and again!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

These are essentially the same as a recipe my husband got at a short stint at chef school.  We use Parmesan, though the original calls for Gruyere.  We also do not saute the garlic in butter--just crush it or mince it and layer it with the cheese--using way more garlic and a little more cheese.  Seems like no matter how much garlic we use, it never becomes too much--the baking it makes it very mild.  I have had these separate when I've refriged and reheated them.  Doesn't happen too often because they're usually GONE.

These potatoes were a big hit at Easter dinner.  Used a Mandolin to slice the potatoes and kept the skin on.  Next time I will use less butter because it was a little greasy.  This is a new Easter dinner staple.

Delicious.  Made for my family, all of whom loved it.  I used 4 large russet potatoes, peeled and sliced.  Microwaved them covered with plastic wrap for ~4.75 minutes, and then baked them for ~ 1 hour, or until tops browned.  Also initially sprinkled salt, pepper, and paprika to potatoes to keep the dish from being too bland.  It would be perfect for dinner parties or potlucks.

This wasn't great but wasn't bad either. A lot of calories for very little flavour. I would add the garlic raw to the cream as browning it didn't enhance the flavour at all.

delicious and very filling. I used a mix of cheddar and mozza cheese instead of gouda, and it went over well at suppertime.

These looked yucky, but tasted pretty good. I'm not sure what happened, but the saucey stuff got chunky and seperated from the potatoes.. There's probably better recipes out there for au gratin potatoes.

I am a cheese cheese cheese lover and that's all I needed to add a wee bit more of to make this dish a 5* for me.  This is an excellent potatoe side dish and so very easy to make.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!  I made it exactly as described and it turned out perfectly!  I had no problems with separation, even upon reheating.  The leftovers were still very delicious!  I would highly recommend this recipe.

These were much better after they sat for 1/2 hour after baking. But still, all in all
a dissapointment. Ate them once more then threw them away. And at the price of gouda cheese, just about killed me to do so.

I have made this twice now. Both times the potatoes were undercooked. My family didn’t care for the Gouda so the second time I used a mix of pepper jack and cheddar. That was the winner. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 the second time and no one noticed. I like the suggestion to mix the garlic in with the cream and distribute it among the layers. Both attempts had more garlic on top and less on the bottom which isn’t a problem as long as you serve all the way through the layers.  I’ll try that next time.

The recipe is very good.  Like other reviews I used smoked gouda for extra flavor.  I also added 2-3 tablespoonfuls finely chopped onion between the layers since we like onion.  I thought the salt in the recipe was a little low, but  thought the cheese might compensate, but it was not enough.  Will add about 1/2 teaspoonful more salt next time I make.

Delicious and decadent!  I made a couple of changes as I wanted a smaller amount for hubby and myself, with leftovers for the next night.
Peeled and sliced three large Russett potatoes,  placed slices in two layers in a 10-in square pan and spread some of the garlic mixture between layers.  Used a bit less cheese and cream and baked for an hour covered with foil, another half hour uncovered until browned and bubbly.  So good!  The leftovers were oily but I used a paper towel to soak up the excess before serving.  Definitely special occasion fare and plan to serve at a dinner party this weekend.

So delicious. Followed recipe exactly, but used half and half, and made in a large, round soufflé dish. Prettier. Beside a superb grilled steak, perfect!

The taste gets 5 stars, but the amount of prep time takes it down one. My arm was tired after slicing and shredding! My 7 yr old even said she liked them. So good! I even used almond milk instead of heavy cream.

Very good side dish option.  I used Yukon gold (what I had) and Monterey Jack shredded cheese (on sale).  I didn't feel like dirtying another pan since in the middle of cooking Easter dinner so I just minced the garlic and sprinkled on top of each layer.  My mom has made many potato au gratin dished and said this was one of the better ones.  Using mandolin ensured even potato slices and cooking time seemed spot on.

The garlic and cheeses in this dish make it a "keeper." However, I used half and half instead of heavy cream and spread a thin layer of sour cream over the second layer for a bit of twang.  I cooked this dish according to the temperature and time given, but the potatoes, which I sliced very thin in a food processor, were not thoroughly cooked.  I covered it with heavy foil and cooked it @ 325 degrees for an additional 35 minutes and it was great!  I think it would have worked out better with frozen hash browns, or at least by boiling the potatoes for a few minutes prior to ensure they cook thoroughly.

I made these Christmas Day and my family loved them. I did make one change.  I substituted 3 lbs of frozen hashbrowns (thawed) in place of the red potatoes. This was strictly for a timesaver. I did not change anything else.  Cook time was roughly the same and very delicious!

Modifications to the recipe: I added about 2 tsp of lemon juice to the cream sauce and made 1.5 times the amount of cream sauce so it comes out moist. Tip: cover casserole with foil in the first 30 minutes and remove for the remaining 40 so top doesn't get burnt. Oh and I used smoked sea salt for added flavor.

I brought some of this for my lunch at work and ended up making another batch to bring to work the next day. Little changes I made: doubled the sauce recipe because I want my potatoes smothered. I also added some sauce per layer instead of just pouring it on top.

I expected more than I got with these potatoes. My family thought they were good but a little odd with the Gouda rather than a sharp American cheese. Also, because I made them ahead of time, a few of the potatoes blackened where they were not coated with the sauce, so I believe I would combine the potatoes in a bowl with sauce then layer if making them ahead of time again. Altogether an OK potato recipe, but not as wonderful, creamy, or flavorful as we had all hoped.

I make this so often; it's an absolutely amazing recipe.

The only changes I make (which improve it greatly) are that (1) I slice the cheese and potatoes as paper thin as possible, and then double up (or even triple) the layers. This creates a great texture and tenderness, and (2) I cover the gratin until the last 15 minutes when I uncover the dish to create a slightly more crisp layer over the otherwise very soft dish. 

It goes brilliantly with either: baked salmon (such as http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baked-salmon-ii/detail.aspx) and asparagus with melted butter OR baked honey nut chicken (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baked-honey-nut-chicken/detail.aspx.) You can even bake both at the same time, by tweaking the timing/temperature a bit.

The flavor was awesome! I think I might have done something wrong because there was a lot of fluid after it was done cooking.  I drained it and it tasted great but it wasn't creamy...it had blobs of cheese.  Like I said, I think I may have done something wrong! I did add onion, used garlic powder instead of cloves, and also used gouda, fontina, and colby cheeses.

The flavor was very good.  I used fat free half and half and it did not separate; however, I made it the night before and think they would have been better straight from the oven without refrigeration. I'm not sure it's worth the $7 worth of smoked gouda.

Very, very good!  They lost their consistancy the next day though (too buttery).

I didn't have Gouda cheese. I used a mixture of parmesan, cheddar and mexican cheese.  I also used skim milk. I would've used evaporated milk but I didn't have that either. Next time I will make it with the Gouda.

These were pretty good but not enough so to warrant the high calorie count.  Next time I might try evaporated milk as suggested by other reviews.

We love cheese, especially Gouda, so I upped it to 2 c.  I don't usually have heavy cream on hand so I used a can of Evaporated Milk instead.  This was sooo good and it looked so nice, too.  Thanks!

Really not much flavor. I couldn't even taste the garlic. It needs something else to make it great. I'll try to add things to this starter dish.

I made this with just a couple of changes...  I didn't have any Gouda, but I DID have some pepper jack.  I omitted the garlic - nothing against garlic, I just didn't think it would go well with the pepper jack. I tossed the cheese into the cream, added some smoked turkey stock, and stirred until the cheese was melted, THEN poured it onto the potatoes.  Melting the cheese into a sauce might help others who were having problems with separation.  My husband absolutely loved this, and it made excellent leftovers the next morning to go with scrambled eggs & sourdough toast.  YUM!

Very good.  I used smoked cheese (with a little leftover colby) and halved the recipe (except for the garlic -- I like garlic).  I also used soy milk instead of cream.  Worked well, and the leftovers didn't separate.

This is a great recipe! The only change I would make is to use less garlic - and I love garlic. Had no problems with sepration when re-heating. Will make these again and again! Great with pork.

This was really good!  My husband and I went on vacation and brought back a wheel of Gouda cheese.  I was searching for recipes to use with it so it wouldn't go to waste and this recipe was VERY helpful.  I have cooked this dish twice and it was great both times.
