I've tried a lot of pumpkin muffin recipes (from this site and others) and this one was definitely the best. Moist, just the right amount of spices, and very delicious.  I only made two changes. One is to add 1 cup of chocolate chips along with the cranberries (nuts would also be nice). If you don't do this, you might want to double the cranberries. The second is to only bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes. 400 is just too hot for muffins, I think. They came out perfect at 350.

I made these and they turned out horrible. It was like rubber. 
It would've been helpful you had given the exact ounces of pumpkin puree I needed, instead of just "1 can." Can sizes vary.

This recipe yielded muffins that were absolutely DEE-LISH!  They were so good (compared to another recipe that I tried from this site) that I had to write a negative review about the other.  Only changes I made were substituting one cup of whole wheat Pastry flour to mix with one cup of the all-purpose flour, adding a bit more of the cranberries, decreasing the ginger (b/c I'm not a fan of ginger), increasing the nutmeg (b/c I like nutmeg more than ginger), made my own puree, and instead of buttermilk I added 1/4 whole milk and 1/4 half & half (b/c I had it).  These will be a regular fall/winter treat in our household!!!!  Kudos Robin L.!!

Tasted great! I used a mini muffin tin instead of the standard sized one, and got 36 muffins out of the recipe. Baking time was 15 minutes.

Fantastic flavor and oh so moist! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is I changed the spice ratio and added more fruit than called for. I also made it slightly healthier by substituting whole wheat flour for white. I made these for an early morning meeting and everyone raved! Just the right combination of spice and sweet. Perfect as an early morning muffin or as a light cake!

These are great muffins.  They have a good texture and are not too sweet.  Some of the muffins I have made from this site are more like cake; light texture and very sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious but next time I'll add nuts to take them to perfection.

In my mind, this is a perfect pumpkin muffin – perfectly domed, perfectly risen, perfectly sweet and moist and perfectly spiced.  The batter was a little on the thick side but I just thinned it out with a little extra buttermilk; I’d say 1-2 T. ought to do it.  I used dried cherries rather than the cranberries (a little sweeter and not as tart) and topped the muffins with some turbinado sugar (aka raw sugar or demerera sugar) before baking.

I made a few healthy changes in this recipe. I used whole wheat white flour, halved the sugar and used white only because I didn't have enough brown, I used a full teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, I used homemade organic pumpkin mash, organic eggs, I switched the amounts of buttermilk and melted butter to cut the fat a bit and I added a half bag of white chocolate chips and 4 oz. chopped pecans. This did need an extra 1/3 cup of buttermilk but I think that might have been because of the type of flour I used. Even then, the batter was really super thick. I got 16 large muffins out of this recipe instead of 12. These turned out really well and my youngest boy and I really enjoyed making this together. EDITED: Even though I worried that these might have turned out tough because I thought I overmixed them, they still turned out moist and really flavorful. My family really liked these and the addition of white chocolate chips and pecans really took them over the edge.

This is becoming a Thanksgiving staple.  Easy (my brother makes it) and delicious.  It gets eaten quickly.  We make ours in a bread pan and it takes about 40-50 minutes.

These came out okay, but rather cake like. Next time I will add walnuts and maybe try substituting 1/4 cup whole wheat flour for some of the white flour. All in all, not bad!

LOVED these muffins.  Felt like domestic goddess after making them.  Took suggestions of others.  Nearly, but didn't quite double all spices except for cloves.  Added almost entire 10oz package of dried cranberries & soaked in hot h20 to plump them.  Added loads of chopped pecans. Baked @ 350 for 20-25 minutes, but they weren't done & took much longer.  Next time I will probably follow original baking temperature & time but watch closely.  As I made them they were lovely, flavorful (and I HATE bland food), moist & quite filling.   Next time, I am hoping to try with whole wheat flour & see if it is still as good.  THANKS for posting this!!! :)

These are lovely muffins. I soaked the cranberries (I used 1 cup) in hot water too plump them while I mixed up the batter. I also increased the spices to my liking. The batter was a little too dry, so I added an extra 1 Tbsp buttermilk. I got about 14 regular-sized muffins. They are delicious warmed up with a cup of hot tea.

These muffins were fantastic. The only downside was that I was left with a half a can of pumpkin puree and no idea what to do with it, but the muffins themselves were a real treat! Great with or without butter, especially with a glass of milk.

My 3-year-old is enjoying them, however I find them to be a bit on the bland side.  If you get a bite with cranberry in it, they  taste okay.   Not sure I'll be making these again.

Just made these muffins - a great thing to do on a rainy day! I used Pumpkin Pie Spice (1-1/2 tsp.) instead of the spices listed, and also used dried cherries instead of cranberries. I think adding pecans or walnuts would be awesome. They are moist and especially good warm. I am not a huge pumpkin fan, but these are good, not overpowering with pumpkin flavor like a pie.

Yummy muffins!  Could be a little sweeter but I am a sweet tooth!  Overall very good.  There is one error in the directions. They do not tell you to add the brown sugar to the pumpkin, butter and milk etc mixture, but any experienced baker knows when to put it in!  Mary W.

Just made these today. I adjusted the baking temp to 350 as someone else suggested (since my oven runs hot) and they turned out great as far as moistness and consistency. I had fresh cranberries, so I used those because I love their tartness. I also used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup coconut oil in place of the 1/2 cup butter. I thought these needed a tad more sweetness and flavor. They are almost bland. If you want a really light and barely sweet muffin, make these as is. I think next time I will add a little more of the spices and sugar to make them more flavorful. Or maybe a sprinkle of regular granulated sugar on top before baking. This a good base recipe that you can tweak according to your taste.

I just made these and they are excellent and exactly what I wanted.  I did soften the cranberries in hot water but drained them well.  I also used 2 cups of the cranberries (cranraisins) due to me liking a lot of them. I would make these again and again.  They were perfect.  I might put in pecans next time.

These muffins are great! I baked for 17 min and added 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the stated blend. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

I made a double batch, with changes as per others' suggestions: used 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce, almond milk,  increased spices by half (cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice) added 1 tsp orange extract, and a cup of mini chocolate chips.  Sprinkled brown sugar on top - baked at 350 - 15 minutes.  Got 24 regular and 18 mini.  Great flavor, moist, not too sweet...just delicious.  Everyone raved about them and wants the recipe!  Definitely will make again.

Absolutely perfect recipe! No changes necessarynl, but if you do not have butter, you can also use 1/2 cup of vegetable oil or even olive oil can be used as a replacement, and it's a little more heart healthy. With all the spices, you will never taste the olive oil at all!

These were so good! I decreased the butter and sugar to make a healthier breakfast option, and they still turned out delicious. I also tried a batch with chocolate chips as a dessert option. Also very delicious!

Followed with recipe with the exception of substituting pumpkin pie spice for the 4 spices.  Also added chocolate chips as others suggested.  Came out okay but taste was nothing special, seemed kind of bland, maybe increase spice next time??  I would also skip the chocolate chips and add nuts instead.

Yeah, great!  I doubled the recipe so I could use the whole can of pumpkin.  I used fresh cranberries because it was what I had - about 2.5 cups for a double recipe.  I should have added a bit more sugar since the dried cranberries have sugar added.  Nice texture!

These are just what I was looking for!  After reading g reviews, I am intrigued by Claymore's suggestion of adding 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds and 1 1/2 cups chopped honeycrisp apple.  Also by the addition of some nuts!  I have some unsweetened dried cranberries  that I may try in the future, perhaps adding a tablespoon of two lot Splenda.  I like to try the recipe as is first, though.  I always have to shake my head about people who change the spices then complain because they find it bland.  when did you buy that spice mix?  If you want good flavor, add individual amounts of either home ground or recently purchased ground spices!  Or use while wheat flour and find it a bit heavy.  Perhaps a touch more salt.  On the second try I doubled the recipe, used unsweetened dried cranberries and took my own advise about buying fresh ground spices. 11/5/19 used l/o butternut squash. 
Today I made 48 mini muffins!  I also include walnuts.

After reading the reviews, I tripled the spices.  I used fresh, chopped cranberries and I'm glad I did.  That was the only bit of flavor there was.

This is a very good muffin recipe. I was hesitant to try it because cranberries and pumpkin didn't seem to "go" But I was pleasantly surprised that they go just fine.  Lovely pumpkin to spice ratio with an occasional tang of cranberry.  Just yummy.  Give this a try.

This recipe is perfectly moist without the greasy top that seems to always result from use of oil in a recipe.  I will be making this often!  My kids (7, 5, and 2 years old) gobbled these up without hesitation.  The only change I made was using an overflowing cup of fresh cranberries instead of craisins, and I used pumpkin puree from a fresh pie pumpkin instead of buying canned.  Absolutely delectable!  I agree with the review to bake at 350 vs 400 and after 22 minutes mine were perfect (in my brand new LG oven).  I put a small amount of batter in mini muffin cups to test out the addition of mini chocolate chips, and in 12-13 minutes they were perfect (and also very yummy!).  I am having a hard time not eating the entire batch in the first day!

Fantastic recipe - great texture and flavor. My muffin tins must be small though because my batch made 12 good size muffins and a mini loaf. Made exactly as written. This is probably the best pumpkin muffin recipe on this site!

These are fantastic!!!  I made them with self-rising flour so I omitted all the baking powder and salt.  They rose up beautifully!  Not overly sweet!  Followed the recipe exactly but added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  I think I just started a new Thanksgiving tradition at our house!

I made mini muffins from this recipe and they came out pretty , with nice texture and taste.  I increased the spices because our family likes them, and included 3/4 c each, chopped walnuts and dried cranberries . 
In case it helps anyone, I made mine GLUTEN FREE by substituting 1c. GF flour mix, 1/2 c. GF oat flour, and 1/2 c. almond flour (instead of the 2 total regular flour).  I also wanted it DAIRY FREE, so I used non-dairy margarine instead of butter and non-dairy sour cream instead of buttermilk.  Using regular kitchen teaspoon, I put a rounded teaspoonful of batter into each mini tin and it made 5 1/2 dozen.

I've made 3x now and have a few tips that helped me. Mix everything by hand -- overmixing the  dry into the wet ingredients makes the muffins pretty dense. I also used 1.5x the spice (for each one!) to add a little more flavor.

Tasty moist pumpkin muffins perfect with tea or coffee. Great recipe! Agree with others who suggest increasing spices to enhance flavor. I substituted 3/4 cup whole wheat flour for one of the two cups of flour and used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice plus 1/4 tsp ground cloves, I will increase pumpkin pie spice next time I make these. Cooked at 400 for 22 minutes and turned out just right.

This is a good recipe, however I had fresh pumpkin and the batter was very thick.  The 2nd batch I made I added 1/4 cup of applesauce and they were perfect.  I'm not sure what the difference is between fresh cooked pumpkin and canned pumpkin but it made a difference.  I'm not a big fan of cloves, so I only added half of 1/8th teaspoon.  In the 2nd batch, I added 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  The 2nd batch made 18 muffins with the applesauce.  I think adding nuts would be great so I may try that on my next batch.

These muffins are not "pretty" but the flavor is top notch.  I used 1/2 self-rising flour (omitted salt, baking powder, & baking soda) and 1/2 whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup additional buttermilk due to the ww flour.  I think they would be really impressive with a light drizzle of icing.

Great recipe for me to make my custom changes to.  The muffins rose nice and high with good flavor.  I added 1/2 cup cranberries, 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/4 cup raisins.  I also changed the brown sugar to coconut sugar.  After baking I brushed the tops with melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Perfect for me.

Gourmet! NOTE!!!: Use only HALF the can of pumpkin, (one cup). Oven at 375 rather than 400. Use whole wheat flour for extra nutrition. No one will ever know, due to the strong spice flavors and the color of the pumpkin. Before starting recipe, add a tiny splash of lemon juice to regular milk and use in place of buttermilk. Chop frozen whole cranberries in blender and substitute for sweetened, dried cranberries, (craisins). Substitute 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Increase ginger, (because GINGER!) ?? Add 1 cup chocolate chips and/or 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds.

I really liked them and will do them again. I only had frozen whole cranberries available on this day so I thawed them cut them in half and used the amount mentioned. They worked great, perhaps if done with sweetened dried the muffins would have been sweeter but to me it didn't matter. I also added some chocolate chips just because I wanted them in there.

Delicious! Moist and flavorful. I don’t like nutmeg so I just increased the other spices a bit and soaked the craisins  so they were moist. I only had 3/4 of a cup of pumpkin so I made 3/4 of the batch but still got 12 medium muffins. Don’t need any other pumpkin muffin recipe.

Those are the best pumpkin muffins I’ve ever baked. The texture was so fluffy and light, but not “airy”. I did modify slightly. I used fresh pumpkin purée- 1 heaping cup, 1 extra tsp. Cinnamon, organic flour (which I believe makes them fluffier) and I had no brown sugar so I used 1 C. Organic sugar with 1 ½ Tbs. molasses. I topped with 1/2 a pecan because my hubby just brought me some back from Texas. This is now part of my permanent collection! Thank you for sharing!

I made these muffins but instead of cranberries, I used one cup of pomegranate seeds and 1 1/2 cups of chopped Honey Crisp apples. I also used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour. The muffins didn't rise a lot, so if I make them again, I will fill the muffin cups right to the top. This would yield about 12 muffins. Overall, I found the results quite delicious.

I have made this recipe several times without any changes and these are very tasty, moist muffins.  They freeze very well also.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I used 1 1/2 t. Pumpkin pie spice in place of the separate spices.  Also added more dried cranberries.  Was good; will probably add chopped pecans, cinnamon and sprinkle top with turbinado sugar next time; but will make again.

These muffins are really good and hearty; one is quite filling on its own.  My muffins turned out perfectly moist but I would add more spices next time.

I read the reviews before making this recipe.  i doubled the spices and added pecans, but still found it incredibly bland, so much so that i threw them out.  I have only tossed something I have baked a few times in my life.  Just didn't think these were worth eating.  Very sorry.

Good muffins.  A little bland.  I used chopped fresh cranberries.  Would definitely increase them next time.

Made these as is and my husband and I loved the fact that they were not too sweet. I thought they were a bit dense and may add orange zest next time  to amp up the flavor. Kept moist all week in  Tupperware.

Moist muffins would make again.
Made a few changes:
Used 1 Cup all purpose and 1 Cup whole wheat flour
Added 1/4 C oats (might up that to 1/2C next time as I used fresh cranberries instead of dried)
Cut the sugar in half and replaced the other half with chocolate chips
Used fresh ginger and doubled, next time with x4 (but I love ginger)
Didn't have milk so added yogurt and some mashed carrots
Used fresh cranberries instead of dried cranberries (gives it that sweet and sour/tart) flavour.
Also prefer to hand fold mixture versus using a mixer for muffin recipes. Was able to hand mix a double batch no problem.

I love these muffins. I make them every time I want to make pumpkin muffin stuffing and it takes all my willpower not to eat the batch before they can go into the stuffing later on. The only change I make is tossing in a handful of pecans because they enhance the stuffing later but they're delicious with or without.

I loved these!  I didn't have all the spices listed, so I used pumpkin pie spice, and added extra cinnamon.   After I mixed in the cranberries, I thought it looked like it could use a few more, so I just added a small handful.  They were moist, and wonderfully spiced.  I'm excited to try them, next time my grand daughter is here.  She will love them!  Thanks for the recipe.

The best muffins I have ever made! I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. I did add semi-sweet chocolate chips as one review suggested. I was just a little more generous with the pumpkin  puree as well but just a little. They were gone very quickly! Very delicious and moist and wonderfully pumpkin.

I make a batch of muffins for my husband's breakfast every week, so I'm always looking for a new recipe to try.  These were delicious!  I made them as the recipe was written except that I added a cup of chopped walnuts.  These will definitely be in my rotation!

I made these as written and won't make them again. They are not very sweet and too dense for my taste. If you prefer a  more 'cake like' muffin then these are not for you.

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/130700/cranberry-pumpkin-muffins/ ... 12 7 16 Sometimes you okay,me)have a baked sweet potato&not many fresh cranberries used in a gelatin from Thanksgiving. You could eat the sweet potato,sure; but the crans?Ohhhh,I'll search by ingredient & heyyyyy,cranberry pumpkin muffins! Step this way. :D I essentially followed the recipe - meaning the base - but yes,changed things,too.{Not enough to make my review invalid,if ya ask me. ;) Used half white,half brown sugar,a cup o'sweet potato on the dry side compared to canned pumpkin so increased buttermilk to 1/3c),I used my pumpkin pie spice ratio = 1t cinnamon,1/2t ginger,1/4t each cloves&nutmeg.Butter, 5T; oil, 3T. 'Halved the fresh crans&had 3/4c.Sprinkled the tops with plain((homemade, larger than usual)breadcrumbs.Baked at 375 because the batter was thick, for 20 minutes.'Guess it's the tin,but I got 18 muffins without being skimpy Nice!These are light-textured&light-tasting muffins.I thought they'd be more dense.Either would be fine,just surprised.Think this could use something,but it isn't more sugar.Maybe just more spices,but that might have to be balanced with more sugar.Hmmm.If I make again,I'll increase the spice amounts by a half more.'Sure glad I tried! A thought: Gingerbread cookie/spiced drizzle. :) Next day: Still moist.Flavor didn't increase, as I expected it to.S'okay.'Maybe it "needs" pumpkin instead of sweet potato&more spices;only brown sugar.Definitely more crans, 1 1/2c, I'm thinkin

Excellent - tried to make these healthier by switching the flour to brown flour and the sugar to Agave.  I, also, added 1/2 cup of walnuts and they were superb.  I will be making these again.

I thought these muffins were good, but a little bland. The cranberries added some zip. The muffins were moist. If I make them again I would add more spices.

As written I thought it needed more of the spices and definitely WALNUTS. I tripled the spices and  turned it into more of a  healthy breakfast starter, using 1/2 whole wheat flour and adding uncooked oatmeal, wheat germ, coconut, and soak the cranberries first.  Definitely bake at 350 degrees.

Easy and tasty - added some applesauce to offset part of the butter, and scattered a few pepitas on top for a little crunch. Baked for 22 minutes. Delish - will make again.

Great recipe, just made substitutions that i normally do in baking. I use some coconut oil and smart balance for most of the butter and replace 2tbsp with 6tbsp ground flax. I also repace 1 egg with 1tbsp flax mixed with 3tbsp  liquid.

I made these recently & we were very disappointed. The batter was extremely thick, so I added a dash more buttermilk. The muffins were very moist, but the cranberries overwhelmed the spices & pumpkin completely. I'm still looking for a really good pumpkin muffin recipe.

I changed out the buttermilk for evaporated milk, added pecans. They are very good and make a great breakfast for on the go.

Quick easy muffin,  I followed recipe, but was a bit short of cranberries so I added raisins.   Baked in large muffin tins with a bit of non-stick spray, 25 min, came out nicely.  moist.  
next time I would step up the spices.  we found it  a bit mild.   I would make this again!

These are perfect as written. I thought some orange zest would be good to add but didn't have any. I had some orange flavoring so added it to some powdered sugar and milk and made a glaze. Family loved them. Thanks for sharing.

I made these today with the following modifications: I used roasted butternut squash puree instead of the pumpkin puree, I added about 1/4 cup white chocolate chips, about a cup of chopped candied walnuts, soaked the cranberries in hot water, added a couple more teaspoons of buttermilk, used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of all the individual spices, and sprinkled the tops with raw sugar before baking. I also used smaller baking cups that I had gotten at Ikea and this yielded 18 muffins vs the 12 the recipe states.

I used canola oil and pumpkin pie spice for the spices. Reduced the oil to 1/3 plus cup. I added 1/4 cup of mini choc chips and a few tablespoons of seeds. Bake only 18 minutes or so.

Good, though the batter was a little thick.  I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg and used soured milk instead of buttermilk.  I'm not sure I'd make these again.
