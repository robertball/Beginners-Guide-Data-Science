You MUST add vanilla to this.  Also, try topped with thawed sweetened red raspberries for a Red Raspberry Russian Cream dessert.  It is FANTASTIC.  My mom used to make it for special occasions only, and now I make it for my kids.

Made this for guests.  They loved it!  It's peach season, so I topped it with peaches in a simple syrup.  I used one bigger mold and unmolded then drizzled the peaches over the top.

I made this with dinner tonight and it was awful! There were huge lumps in it because there was not enough water compared to gelatin. The only reason I am not rating this one star is because I did like the flavor, but the lumps were disgusting. Sorry!

It looked fine but the flavor left much to be desired.  I will not make it again.

Flavor was a good foil for fresh berries. I don't know what I did wrong, but it never set. It came out like a very thick sauce. Might try again, but using crime fraiche or mascarpone is just as good or better, with no wait time.
