This is a great recipe, but I'd make a few changes.  First I use half yellow squash and half zucchini.  Next cook the onions with the squash, then the onion flavor won't be overpowering.  I also use cream of chicken soup (or cheese if you want it vegetarian).  Lastly, I think I use a little more stuffing, probably 8-12 oz.  Definetly try this one!

This is a good recipe.  I reduced the fat content by using fat free sour cream, light margarine, and low fat cream of mushroom soup.  Also, I followed the suggestion of others and used only 1/2 C of onion.  Very good.

Great side dish recipe using vegetables. I reduced the amount of butter to 1/4 cup and combined all ingredients together.  After baking it for 10 minutes, I also added cheddar cheese. The dish turned out very moist and was a nice side with chicken with gravy.  Would make this again.

This was really yummy!  I made a few changes but I'm sure it would have been great as is.  First, I mixed in about 1/2 sleeve of Ritz crackers in the stuffing with the butter.  I used only 4 cups zucchini, which I pre-cooked in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I cut the sour cream in half since I had less zucchini and added some garlic POWDER (don't use garlic SALT, because it was pretty salty already with all the Ritz crackers) I wanted to make it a complete meal so I added a drained can of turkey meat to the zucchini/soup mixture.  I probably cooked it 30 minutes and it was nicely crisp-tender, but the crust was dark and yummy.  We ate 2 helpings each.  Yum!!

The onion is really overpowering in this recipe, since it doesn't really cook much in the time allotted.  I recommend chopping it very small or omitting it altogether.  

I also found the stuffing mix didn't puff up at all, I don't know if it was supposed to, or not, but mine didn't.  As a result, this didn't really satisfy as a main dish... it was just a whole lotta zucchini with some breadcrumbs on top, which seems more of a side dish.

Three adult men in our home raved and raved about this recipe begging me to keep it and make it again in the near future.  I've never seen them eat so many helpings of veggies.

I've had dishes like this before but they've tasted a lot better than mine did. The zucchini released a lot of water while cooking that formed a pond in the bottom of the dish. I also found the onion a bit overwhelming so I wish I didn't add as much.

After reading lots of reviews on several similar recipes for zucchini casserole, I modified it: I sauteed my onions and carrots until tender and seasoned them with Spice Islands 'Beau Monde' blend. I only cooked my zucchini (sliced and then halved, not chopped) for five minutes. I did not boil it for five minutes, I added it to boiling water and drained it after five minutes..the finished product was perfectly tender but NOT mushy (groty, as we say in CA). I used chicken flavored stuffing and cream of chicken soup, and added a bit (maybe 1/4 cup) of sharp cheddar cheese on the top. Finally, I used a covered casserole dish. That way the stuffing wasn't dried out as some have noted. Very good main dish with salad and white wine!

This was great! I added diced chicken breast to the zucchini mixture and substituted Greek yougurt for the sour cream. Makes a full meal.

I loved the idea, but it came out kind of bland. Adding chives and garlic over onions would have picked it up a bit. Next time I plan to grilling the zucchini first, to see if that helps with the water content and flavor.

My husband called this "onion soup": a little too onion-y, a little too soupy. I thought it was pretty good, though very rich. If I make it again, I'd omit the onion for my husband and leave out the margarine, too.

I think this is a fabulous recipe!  My husband thought so too and it has been added to our frequently used recipes.  I did add a little shredded cheese to the mixture so it added a little more flavor!  YUMMY!

This is very good! I was missing two ingredients and didn't want to make a trip to the grocery store so I used cream of celery soup and replaced the carrots with fresh tomatoes. Will definitely make again!

This is very good! I was missing two ingredients and didn't want to make a trip to the grocery store so I used cream of celery soup and replaced the carrots with fresh tomatoes. Will definitely make again!

wow, this is delicious and fast.  This is a 5 star at our table.  the left overs the next day were also fabulous and that is why i rated a 5 and not a 4.  I used a sourdough stove stop stuffing mix in place of the bread crumbs

Definite keeper ,,, Delicious and colorful.  Used about 2 generous cups of Pepperidge Farm seasoned bread crumbs in place of boxed stuffing.  Tasted a LOT like dressing.  Will be adding to Thanksgiving menu this year.  Just Wonderful!

I like zucchini, creamy sauces, and stuffing, but I was not impressed by this casserole. The sour cream taste was a little overpowering. Furthermore, I was expecting the stuffing to turn out moist, but it wasn't. Perhaps the reason why some previous reviewers have said that this dish is better the 2nd day is because the stuffing by then has had a chance to soak up some moisture. Maybe if the stuffing were mixed with a little water beforehand, it would turn out more moist. Or if the dish was covered during baking, it would keep in more moisture?

Really easy, tasty recipe.  I took this to a dinner and there wasn't any left.  Everyone there wanted the recipe.  I used chicken flavored stuffing instead of herb.

This recipe is simple to make and a good side dish.  I felt it needed a little more flavor, but its a great use for all that extra zucchini in the late summer and early fall

This was just alright for me.  As much as I enjoy onions, it was too oniony as many others said in their reviews.  I would suggest to cook them before adding.  I might try this again at some point and add some more veggies like peppers and mushrooms (also cooked).

I can't believe i would ever find a zucchine recipe that would taste so good. The only thing i would suggest is the time. I would put it at 375 degrees for about 1/2 hour to 45 min. Thank you I will make this dish the rest of the summer and give it to my friends.

A lot of chopping and dicing,  Should only use half the onion,  Maybe green onion instead. Will I make this again?  I doubt it.
