Mine didn't come out looking as nice as the picture.  They got flatter and wider, and look more like slugs!  They taste great, but I was hoping they would look rounder and more candy cane-like.

Love this recipe! This is a hit! Cookies turned out soft and very nice looking. The recipe made more than the recipe had called for and I had to make the cookies larger than the recipe called for... but still fantastic! This is a holiday favorite to be made again and again.

Very tasty, but a few notes...  

I used a total of 4 white chocolate squares to drizzle on them. Melted 2 and drizzled then did 2 more. 

My daughter wanted a candy cane, so bought a pack of 12. I used 5 for these cookies -- unwrap, put in a ziplock bag, and smash away. (The smaller the piece of peppermint, the better.)

And the mixer worked great but in the end, I had to use a big, heavy metal spoon as the dough was a bit too thick for my hand held mixer.

The video makes it look sooo easy!

My first batch was a disaster so I was glad to find out that I wasn't the only who had the unexpected results--chocolate slugs!  I, too, resorted to dropping the dough and even used a cookie press with good results.  That's when I figured out what I was doing wrong!

The recipe yields much than expected.  As a result, I was using too much dough to roll out the canes.  Just keep it small and tight and the cane will be too!  

Also, make sure your pan is completely cooled between sets to prevent spreading.

In the end, I still liked the cookie press and just kept at it.

Oh, and I doubled the chocolate!

Happy Holidays!

These were pretty easy to throw together, I did refrigerate the dough before working with it because I wanted them to hold their shape. I also used Peppermint crunch baking chips to drizzle on top, no need to crush peppermint candies :).

These did not taste good. Very dry and not at all chocolatey. But, they looked cute and were fun for the kids to decorate.

After reading reviews I made these changes which resulted in a great cookie. Neighbors raved about them.  Reduced cream cheese by half (less spreading "slugs"). As a choc-o-holic, the mild chocolate taste wouldn't do! Replaced 4 squares of chocolate with 3.5 oz. bar of good quality dark (I used Lindt 85%) chocolate. Lastly reduced baking to 8 minutes. The flavor was worthy, and they kept their form. Made some pretzel shapes for shipping (thought the delicate cane shape might break).  Next time will do 1/2 with dark chocolate drizzle for the chocolate lovers.

If you LIKE chocolate, these probably aren't rich enough for you.  Also, the dough was very hard to roll/shape.

These cookies were fine, but not memorable.  They were a bit spongy for my liking, but looked cute.  Hubby said no need to keep this recipe around.

Mine also came out like slugs...flattened out and didnt look anything like the video.  I dont know what I did different.  I followed recipe to the letter.  They also fell apart and were difficult to handle.  Wont be trying this one again!

A great Christmas classic.  I used the original 52 cookie recipe, but my mixer struggled to hold that much (It's a standard size Hamilton Beach standing mixer).  Next time I'll make two smaller batches.

Re-reviewing this after playing around with the recipe a bit. It seems that my first time around was a lucky fluke and every time since I've ended up with the telltale greasy slug shape. With this latest batch I cut the cream cheese down to 4 oz and added 1/4 cup cocoa powder (I could have done 1/8 cup, but I have a group of chocolate lovers). I still had to chill the dough before baking, but this time they came out more appealing-looking.

Awesome!! Liked the cookies better without the peppermint crushed candy, also tried some of the Andes mint chocolate chips on top but we liked them the best with just the white choc. frosting on them. Delish and so festive!!

I did not like these cookies. You could not taste the chocolate.  My husband actly thought they were gingerbread cookies!  The dough was very hard to work, very soft and sticky. They look pretty but the recipe needs work to be a good cookie.

My family loves these cookies. I refrigerated the dough after shaping it into balls but still had the slug-shape problem. Also, it drives me nuts when a recipe says to divide the dough into X number of balls. It's much easier for me if the recipe says to shape the dough into balls of a certain size. I found that balls of about 3/4 of an inch were the right size, though I had to make the cookie canes a bit larger, about 4 inches. No more slug shapes, and I had no trouble getting these off the cookie sheet.

I also used more crushed peppermint candies to ramp up the peppermint flavor. My husband doesn't like candy, so I made some of the cookies without the peppermint, and he loved them. Finally, I ran out of white chocolate, so I made some with melted semi-sweet chocolate--not as pretty, but my family raved about them.

I'll make this recipe again.

My doughter loved to make this cookies, and the dough tastes good, but the crushed peppermint candies didn't work that well. Instead we used sprinckles on top, and they looked more festive.

I chilled the dough for a few minutes and I felt that it made it easier to shape it into the canes. I also will double the chocolate next time I make the recipe. I found it difficult to crush the candy canes though so I might look for something pre-crushed next time.

Just average... It's a lot of work, and the flavor is really kind of bland.  I took these to a holiday party at work, and it was the first time I have taken something and the serving plate didn't come back empty.  People let them sit....  I won't make these again!

not my favorite- followed the directions to a "t" and although my husband liked them, they didn't have a very intense chocolate/mint flavor to me. They were cute though.

This recipe lacked flavor.  The result was a sluggish looking candy cane.  I threw out the rest of the batter.  I will not bake these cookies ever again.  The cream cheese softened the dough too much.

This recipe came out ok.  The video made it look so easy and their cookies turned out very nice looking.  Mine looked ok, but did not really taste chocolatey.  I did add an extra square of choclate and also what helped was chilling balls of dough before trying to shape them.  I may make these again when I have more time/patience to make them come out like Kraft's did.

Cookie dough too soft despite chilling it.  Turned our flat.  I only make 1 pan then quite--it wasn't worth my precious time.  I didn't even taste them because I was so disappointed in the prep.

This cookie is very tasty, but I was a little dissapointed that they didn't come out quite like the picture. They went flat like a cookie.  I did refridgerate the dough to make it more easy to handle which worked pretty well.  I will probably make these again.

These tasted good, but I had trouble making them into the canes.  They were too sticky to roll, so I just put them in rounded tablespoons just like a regular cookie.  They kind of taste like a mix between a devils food cookie and a brownie.

I don't know what the picture is made of, but it's not this recipe. The cookies flattened out - like the other reviewers said they are sort of 'sluggish' looking. I refrigerated the dough to make them easier to work with, but I ended up leaving them in round balls also. The flavor was pretty good though, which is why I gave it 3 stars.

I tried these from the Kraft Recipe in a magazine so I didn't see all these great tips-  I followed the recipe exactly for the cookies and the dough was oily and the cookies did flatten out a LOT - so there was not much candy cane shape.  I used a bag of white choc. chips in lieu of the melted white chocolate - just microwaved it and drizzled with a plastic ziploc.  We all thought the taste was really good - not too chocolatey!  I used round peppermint candy for the topping - big mistake!  They were so hard to crush.  I will make these again as follows - 1. Round cookies, drizzle the white chocolate on, and cover with crushed candy canes (which are thinner than the hard candies).

This recipe takes much longer than the ready in 42 minutes! Rolling the cookies takes a while. Directions to bake a chocolate cookie until lightly browned are pretty funny.  Do let cookies cool before moving from the pan or they will break.  Overall, this is a tasty cookie that looks cute when it's complete even if it doesn't look as good as the picture.

Very moist and delicious. After several batches I decided to forget trying to make the candy cane shape. It was hard to get them off the pan in one piece. Very attractive if you follow decoration directions on a round cookie.

Should have let the melted chocolate cool after microwave..the temperature of the dough got all messed up. Tryed to chill it..but it never worked really well. Had to make larger cookie because of the softness of the dough. Only yielded 24.  I might try them again next year.

These are yummy and cute to serve. My only wish is that the chocolate cookie had a better taste. I may try some other chocolate cookie dough recipes and then add the goodies on top.  I noticed there was no way to make a candy cane out of a 3" piece.  Ours were much larger...

The cookies tasted just ok. Even though you didn't need a cookie cutter it makes you remember why they were invented. No one at my party really ate them. I agree with other reviews they need a stronger minty flavor.

This wasn't a bad recipe. You can't really taste the chocolate in the cookie and it does tend to spread. Mine still came out looking like a candy cane. The only problems I had was that my mixer couldn't handle that much cookie dough. I, along with my family, agreed there was a bit too much flour in the recipe so next time I make this, I will definitely cut back on the flour. Otherwise, these are great cookies, long to make, but cute and edible.

The cookie tasted pretty good, though not as flavorful as I hoped. And they didn't look nearly as nice as the picture.  I tried and tried to get them to look nice  but without success.  I ended up just shaping them into little balls, and that worked well.  I also mixed crushed candy canes into some of the batter which turned out to be a nice touch and added some flavor.
