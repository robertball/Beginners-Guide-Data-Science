I'm usually kind of skeptical trying recipes on this site that haven't been rated but I'm very pleased to be the first one to rate this bread.  I didn't have italian seasoning but used 1/4 tsp of each...sage, oregano, thyme and basil.  It turned out so soft and delicious that I will certainly be making again for company.

ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!! THIS IS A KEEPER!!! A nice crust with a beautiful crumb! I recommend only making one loaf form this recipe, though...and to avoid the soggyness on the bottom of the loaf, dust bottom and sides of dough with cornmeal instead of greasing the pan. This bread was fantastic. I made it five times in a week. Gave two away and we ate the others ourselves. For the herbs I used sage, basil and oregano along with fresh rosemary (I dumped all the rosemary into the bread and did not sprinkle any on top). The salty taste of this bread makes it sooo good and we just could not get enough. When it's day old, it makes INCREDIBLE toast.

My husband LOVES rosemary so I had to give this a try. This was super easy to make, and a 5 star hit with my husband and the kids. The only problem I ran into is if you are going to do the egg wash, you should do that first and then sprinkle the extra rosemary on top right before baking, otherwise it just brushes right off.

This turned out great.  It reminded me of the bread served at my favorite Italian restaurant. Definitely use fresh rosemary if you can, it makes all the difference.

This bread is fabulous!  I used crushed rosemary and spread cornmeal on the bottom of the baking sheet. I didn't use any additional rosemary on top - it all went in the bread.  I served it warm with an herbed olive oil for dipping.

I made this with dinner last night and it was delicious!  I messed up and added the whole 2 Tbsp of rosemary to the bread mixture and it turned out beautifully regardless.  I served it alongside Rosemary Pasta in Roasted Garlic Sauce (also on this site) and it was just delicious together!

I just took my two loaves out of the oven and can honestly say that this is a fabulous recipe.  I used my bread machine set on the dough setting but didn't change anything else about the recipe.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Help!  My bread was hard as rock.  I followed the directions but noticed that the bread didn't rise after I punch the dough and left in the baking pan.  What did I do wrong?

This is the best bread I have ever made. It has become such a hit with the family and friends! And so easy to make too.

My son is such a picky eater and he loves it. Had to give it a 5 star!

This is Excellent bread and smells awesome while baking and afterwards. I doubled the recipe and made four loaves. I took it to work and heated up a few pieces in the microwave. My co-workers sniffed their way to my office within seconds and devoured all 4 loaves. Got tons of compliments and astonished looks when I told them I made it by hand. I also got flirted with when the single girls saw I took the time to bake. So double thanks for the recipe! Now Pardon me while I go find some chocolate recipes to take to work..Heck, maybe I'll get a date!

EDIT*  Its been 7 months since I first made and reviewed this bread, Im up At 3am making this bread because ive got my days and nights turned around and I had to have something to do!  This is STILL awesome bread!

I had great success mixing this in my food processor (with the dough blade).
Sprinkled the loaves with kosher salt after the egg wash.  I pulled one of the loaves out half baked and popped it in the freezer.  I finished baking it off a few days later.

I try a lot of recipes from this site, but very seldom do I feel inclined to comment. With a few minor adjustments, this recipe is definitely 5 stars! First of all, this makes 2 small loaves. I suggest doing the recipe as stated, but using the entire dough ball to make one beautiful loaf. Ok now for the recipe changes: I used fresh, minced rosemary and oregano from my garden. This makes a HUGE difference in taste. I used 2 tbsp rosemary, 1 tsp oregano, and 1 tsp garlic powder (all in the dough, none on top). I also used about 1/2 cup less flour and knead the heck out of it! I mean for 15 minutes or so. I suggest looking up videos on how to shape a bread round b/c without the proper technique and tight ball, it will be flat. Right before baking, mix 1 egg WHITE with 1 tbsp of water. Make 3 slits on top of the bread, brush with egg wash, and sprinkle with salt. Immediately when you put the bread in the oven, you need to create steam. I tossed in 1/4 cup of water on the bottom of my oven. Bake for 20 minutes and DON'T open the door! At 20 mins, open the oven, brush with egg wash again and sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Turn it around and bake for an additional 20 minutes. With these changes, you will have a bakery worthy, crusty, beautiful loaf of bread.

Awesome!  I followed the recipe pretty much as written but used the entire 2 T of rosemary in the bread (I also used fresh rosemary - wasn't specified but that was what I had).  After using egg wash on top, I sprinkled with sea salt.  Yum!

This was gone in less than 20 minutes! I made it pretty much the same as directed, using fresh rosemary from my garden, and also adding in some sage, basil, and chives from the garden as well. (The more herbs the better, right?) I also shredded a little parmigiana cheese on top. Served it with peppered olive oil and rounds of fresh mozzerella. My suggestion? Make twice to three times as much for this recipe - now that it's gone I wish I had the time to start a new batch all over again! I would have liked at least one more loaf to save for breakfast tomorrow.

This is a fantastic recipe! It won a blue ribbon at my county fair! I make it just as is, the only thing I do different is put a dusting of corn meal on the cookie sheet before I put the loaves on. They turn out great! One warning though, be sure to let them cool before you cut them! Otherwise they get very very flat.  Also, if you like a change once in a while, put all the rosemary in the bread & sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top. Turns out amazing!

I have made this bread a few times and it is excellent. My daughter is not a big fan of rosemary but likes this bread when I cut the rosemary down but up the italian seasoning. I plan on making this bread just to made bread cubes for my stuffing this year. I think it will give it a lot of flavor.

Delicious! I love this bread so much. I made a few loaves for a recent school fundraiser, and my husband was put out that I didn't make enough for the family, too. The next night, I made more to appease the masses. I'm making some tonight for another fundraiser, and making sure to make enough for the family, too, this time.

This is the first "by scratch" bread I've ever made without a bread machine.  I totally screwed up the recipe by not adding the sugar until just before the flour.  Surprisingly all three batches I made turned out perfectly anyway. I ended up sharing the extra loaves with a couple other families and they all thought it was as fantastic as my family did.  This is a fool proof recipe that even I couldn't screw up.  I will be making this one again and again.

my favorite rosemary bread recipe. i double the rosemary, though - i add three tablespoons into the mix and then another tablespoon on top of the loaves. i also add a tablespoon of garlic powder when i add the rosemary. don't leave out the butter - it really adds to the flavor!

This is DELICIOUS. I added some garlic powder cause it's delicious and goes with everything. The outside is SUPPOSED to be hard and crusty. If you don't like that, then don't brush egg on yours. The egg was helps to harden and beautify the bread. If your bread isn't rising well it's to do with your yeast or your method, not the recipe itself. This is a very nice recipe for a beginning yeast bread baker because it specifies an amount of time to knead--10 to 12 minutes--instead of a texture to stop at (smooth and elastic is usually what's written). It's a very tasty bread! I think I'm going to start using this for my pizza crust...

This bread is fool proof, I made the dough in the breadmaker. Only because when I tend to make bread from hand it never works:(  Anyhow the flavour was perfect, this bread wasn't heavy and it didn't need butter.  I pretty much ate one loaf to myself.  PERFECT BREAD YUMMY

This bread came out so light and fluffy I couldn't believe it.  The loaves are a bit on the small side, so next time I will probably double the recipe so I have two larger loaves.  I'll also add more seasoning, particularly garlic salt, as someone else mentioned.  I think it would work to make this bread even more flavorful.

I sprinkled rosemary over the loaves after I brushed them with the egg.  However the rosemary still fell off when I went to cut into the bread.  So putting all the rosemary in the dough would probably be a good solution.

Overall, this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Turned out great! Thank you!

Yum yum yum!  I couldn't stop eating this bread :)  I didn't have any bread flour so I used all purpose and added ~1.5 tablespoons wheat gluten.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh rosemary from my garden (the first opportunity I've had to use it!)  The texture was awesome and stayed soft for days  (though after the first day there wasn't much left :)).
Thank you for this recipe!

When I made this, I doubled the recipe. I cut down the fresh rosemary by a teaspoon or 2 and then added a few cloves of minced garlic and about a tablespoon each of fresh chives and basil.

After it had risen for an hour, I divided it into two and put it onto the trays as instructed. Then I brushed each loaf with some olive oil and sprinkled some grated parmesan on top. Cooked for 16 minutes, switching the position of the trays halfway through for a more even browning.

Turned out great.

This is a delicious bread.  I made half the recipe, and added a little olive oil along with the butter to the mixture.  I didn’t bother with the egg wash, but instead put a pan of water in the oven to create a thick crust.  Wonderful!

Made this dough using the exact recipe, opted to form into 15 rolls instead of one loaf, & did NOT use the optional egg wash.  Nice flavor, but they would not brown (even though I sprayed with H2O 3X while baking).  Texture was not as good as other similar recipes on this site (see Jo's Rosemary Bread, which has a much more authentic "Ciabatta-Tuscan" texture).  With egg-wash it probably would have browned nicely, but you shouldn't HAVE to do this to make it visually appealing enough to eat.  Served these with delicious Pasta Fagioli & a nice tossed salad, but no one touched them... I think it was because they did not brown.  If you want moister bread (maybe for sandwiches) this is your recipe, but the egg wash should NOT be listed as optional if you want your bread to brown normally & look good.

In order for the crust to be crunchy you must use only egg white not beaten egg as some have suggested . everything else was left the same . I truly love this bread but my husband and family will be the true test .

This bread is delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I made it exactly the way it was written, except for adding a little garlic salt on top and adding a little thyme. It came out perfect. Its great for dipping in a little olive oil and pepper.

I made this for the third time yesterday. It has a beautiful crumb and taste. The only problem I have with it is the crust is not "crusty". I used the egg wash, last time threw in ice cubes and when I take it out of the oven, the crust becomes soft. I don't know if it is supposed to be soft or if I am doing something wrong. So yesterday I made one round loaf and the rest into hamburger buns. The buns were great and I will use this recipe again for buns. The bread also toasts wonderfully. I hope someone can tell me what they think of the crust because otherwise it is a great bread.

This was the first time I ever made bread. I was shocked at how easy it was and how good this bread turned out! So much flavor. 3 cups was way too much flour, most of the third cup wouldn't stick to the dough. I also had issues with the dough rising enough, but it was really humid here so I'm not surprised it turned out dense. Overall a great recipe I plan to make again and again!

This bread is excellent!  I did have an issue- the dough was very dry and didn't absorb all the flour.  I had to add a little extra oil to get it to absorb (probably should have just decreased the flour), and then it did not rise well.  We did have some strange weather today so I'd like to blame the humidity or air pressure rather than assume the recipe is flawed.  Because the bread ended up being so dense, it did not cook all the way through so if you think your dough seems dense, definitely go the full 20 minutes in the oven or even more.  Flavor-wise, this bread is fabulous.  I am sure the herbs are more present the second day but we will not know, because there's none left after tonight's meal!

This is wonderful.
I kneaded in some chopped rasins to the dough and it was delicious.  I also doubled the ammount of fresh rosemary just because I love rosemary and I have 3 HUGE plants in my yard. I suggest running the rosemary through a food processor to release the oils a bit more and to really get that strong rosemary flavor.
Throw a little tuna salad on slices and make the BEST tuna sandwiches!
I make it all the time and my boyfriend LOVES it.

I put all the Rosemary and Italian herbs in the bread and rubbed with olive oil after it was baked.  Fragrant, delicious, with good texture and easy to make.  Better final product than the  Rosemary French Bread on this site.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  Update:  Omitted egg wash and olive oil since I made this in my bread maker this time.  Used fresh rosemary and  added 1 tbsp. fresh minced garlic, 1 tsp. fresh minced oregano and 1 tsp. fresh minced thyme.  Moist with wonderful flavor, texture and crispy crust.  Think in my next loaf I will use sundried tomato and fresh basil for seasoning.  Yum!

This is an excellent easy bread recipe!  I used a fresh herb mixture of rosemary, oregano and thyme and threw it all in to the dough.  It was probably about 1/3 cup total.  I also included a teaspoon of minced garlic and should have done more since I couldn't taste it (I love it).  I also put down wax paper and lightly sprayed it with cooking spray. At first I baked them for only 15 minutes and the first loaf was slightly doughy (I have an unreliable oven unfortunately).  So I threw the un-eaten one back in the oven for another 5 minutes and it's perfect.  Dipped it in olive oil/balsamic vinegar/fresh black pepper.  I couldn't stop eating it!

Worked great, even for a first time bread attemp! They were soft, not too dense, great flavour. Have experimented with adding 1 tablespoon of minced garlic which worked well. Rosemary didn't seem to stay on top whether put there before or after the egg wash, but wasn't really needed. Made these as bread rolls too which were a hit. Is flavourful as garlic/herb bread - spread with olive oil and garlic and grill. Great recipe, will definately make again.

I made just a few little changes to this recipe, and it was great! I brushed the egg and rosemary on after the second rise (and used only 1/2 T. rosemary for the topping). I also added one minced garlic clove to the dough when I was mixing it and sprinkled a little seasoned and garlic salt on the loaves with the rosemary. I think that the salt really enhanced the flavor, and the bread was really good dipped in olive oil with pepper.

I had a pot of rosemary growing outside, so I tried to find a way to use it up and am very delighted with this recipe! The first day it was delicious with roast chicken and then it made awesome paninis the next day with fresh tomato, ham & mozzarella! yum! Thanks! There was no better way to enjoy rosemary!

I got rave reviews for this recipe!  Even though I had run out of bread flour and was too lazy to go to the store, it still turned out fantastic even though I used plain/all-purpose flour.  The only thing is, next time I would not let it rise in the bowl covered with olive oil.  It made the bottom of my loaves slightly on the soggy side -- but only just slightly.  DELICIOUS recipe.  Will definitely bake it again and again.

I ran out of white flour and had to use 1 cup of whole wheat. It came out rather dense. But it still tasted pretty good. I'm not sure if I am going to try this one again with all white flour or just try some different recipes.

This is hands down the best bread I've made yet.  It's amazingly flavorful and screams "I'm a gourmet italian bread".  Haven't tried it yet, but I agree it would go incredibly well with garlic olive oil (or olive oil with a little black pepper added).  Warning: this bread makes your house smell incredibly good while baking - if you're hungry it could be dangerous.

This recipe adapts very well for bread machine use as well.  I just omitted the oil and egg and made it a simple one-step recipe (just put all ingredients in to the machine on its standard bread cycle - comes out perfect).  I also didn't have italian seasoning as such, so I substituted just about equal parts of oregano, basil, black pepper, and parsley.  I also ended up using slightly less yeast just because mine are in small 3g packages and I didn't want to open a third package and only use a portion of it.

I left out the Italian seasoning as I wanted only the rosemary.  Very, very delicious bread.  A big hit with our family!

This bread was AMAZING! I couldn’t stop taking slices of it once it was made. Though I’m a noob at cooking, I managed this recipe just fine. I didn’t sprinkle the top with rosemary (didn’t have enough), and FYI, it goes GREAT with chili! Hopefully I’ll double up on the quantities and make even more soon!

Great starter recipe. Made as directed. Next time I will add in more Italian seasoning and a bit more salt. Also, I needed to extend the cooking time by 7 minutes to develop the crust.

This is an easy, great recipe for a fairly novice bread maker like myself.  I used margarine instead of butter and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp.  As recommended by another reviewer, I sprinkled the rosemary on top of the egg wash; however, next time, I think I will add even more to the dough itself.  

Thanks for a delicious recipe!  I will definitely be making this again.

This bread is awesome!! I was looking for a way to use up some fresh rosemary that my mom gave me, so I decided to make this.  It is wonderful and I have to say this is my greatest success in bread making so far!  The texture and taste are great, and the dough shaped up really nicely.  I "kneaded" it in my kitchenaid for about 8 minutes, and since the weather here is humid I had to add a little additional flour.  I actually used only olive oil as I did not have any butter.  This bread was definitely a hit and I will be making it again soon!  Thanks for a great recipe :)

I have made this bread so many times and it's always gone within an hour.  Beautiful texture, just the perfect amount of herbs.  I alternate between flours -- sometimes I use all bread flour, sometimes 2 cups all purpose and 1 cup bread, sometimes wheat and bread flour.  I can't recommend this enough!

Great bread!  I used even more rosemary, and after I did the egg brush i sprinkled extra italian seasoning and some garlic powder on top.  Superb! Diped it in olive oil with fresh cracked pepper.  Went fantastic with the tomato bisque recipe from this site.

this was very easy to make and i followed the directions fairly closely.  the only modifications were that i added about 3 tablespoons of fresh basil from my garden and used fresh rosemary.  also before i put these in the oven, i sprinkled salt on top of them.    i ended up cooking the loaves for about 25 or 26 minutes and they are delicious.  the only reason why i am not giving this 5 stars is because i wish that the crust was crusty!  otherwise this is a quick and easy bread which i will be making again!

This was so addictive! It made 2 loaves and despite making this just before bed, they were both gone by the end of the 2nd day. Used dry & fresh rosemary in the dough but sprinkled fresh on top before sticking in the oven because I love the taste of crisp rosemary.

This bread turned out wonderful! I made a garlic olive oil dipping sauce to go with it.  Next time, however, I won't put the remaining rosemary on top as it just falls off when you try to eat it. It had great flavor and I will certainly make it again!

LOVED it!   I used my bread machine to make the dough, took it out, split it in two. let rise one more hour and baked it. It came out beautiful.  I couldn't believe it looked so good! I did take other's advice and used fresh rosemary, (I used dried italian seasoning) and I sprinkled the loafs liberally with kosher salt after the egg wash was applied.  Served with olive oil and balsamic vinager seasoned with salt and pepper.  Everyone loved it!

I consider myself an intermediate cook, but ameatur baker....and this bread turned out FANTASTIC!.....i followed the kneading instructions as stated...but not having keaded bread before...i first watched a video on you tube, finally...i turned my electric oven on to 150 to let it heat up while i was making the bread and then turned it off while kneading...so the bread would have a warm place to rise....i had to intermittently turn it on for about 30-45 seconds during the second rise...

This recipe makes delicious, pillowy bread.  I used one and a half tablespoons of dried rosemary and olive oil in place of butter.  I also only allowed one rise before shaping the dough into one boule.  I will definitely make this again.  Without rosemary, this dough makes very soft dinner buns.

Awesome bread! I started making this to cut down on my grocery bill - and because my sister seems to have aquired a mild wheat allergy.  I had to make a few adjustments because things weren't turning out quite the way they were supposed to. Proofed the yeast in half the sugar, then added the second half once the yeast had done its stuff. I've also found that six cups of flour is too much - I add in 5, then knead in the last cup - and it usually doesn't take a full cup.  As a variation I've been experimenting with wheat flower. It's especially yummy thus far. :)

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  We LOVE this local italian restaurant and they serve a bread like this.. so I wanted to try to make it.  I have never had much luck at making bread.. but let me tell you this was FANTASTIC!!!! Made exactly like directions except added all the rosemary in the dough- and added kosher salt to the top!! AWESOME!! My husband said it was better than the restaurant and my 13 year old son ate 1/2 a loaf.. He would have eaten all of it if i let him lol. He's already asked me to make it again next week. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a great recipe and yields a delicious loaf of "artisan" bread.  I used organic whole wheat flour, substituted olive oil in place of the butter, and kneaded in a 1/4 cup of both chopped red onion and chopped sun-dried tomato for extra flavor and texture.  We sliced and served with olive oil mixed with salt and pepper for dipping.  The bread was the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of homemade vegetable soup (Alton Brown's recipe).   Thanks!

This bread has great flavor! The only problem I had with it was that it didn't rise very well, therefore making it a little heavy in texture. My Dad made it in the bread machine once too, and that helped it to rise better. Thanks!

I don't know if this recipe was intended to be a knock-off of the bread at the Macaroni Grill restaurant chain? We thought this was just like it. It was excellent and easy to make! A perfect way to use fresh rosemary from the herb garden.

Ok, I found this recipe about a year ago and have been using it regularly since.  I have made many other breads from scratch and none have turned out with this level of perfection.  I tweaked it just a bit, substituting one of the cups of bread flour with regular flour and specifically using fresh rosemary in and dried rosemary on top of the bread.  After these changes, I kid you not...tastes just like Macaroni Grill's appetizer bread.  You must try it!!!

I would give this bread 10 stars if I could. what a gem!!! Candice, thank you for sharing.  I usually make "artisan" type breads and they take quite a while to prepare. This bread gave the taste of those artisan breads in literally half the time (and effort, phew!). This is by far my favorite bread recipe and also, I've tried it with and without rosemary, and it's great either way. LOVE it!

The name says it all--it is delicious.  My dough didn't take nearly 3 c. of flour.  I had used my last egg earlier in the day, so I had to skip the egg wash, but nevertheless it became two beautiful loaves of bread with excellent flavor.

This bread is so good!  I made it to go with the Beef and Barley Stew recipe from this website.  I set it next to the wood stove to let it rise.  Turned out wonderful, with just enough flavor.  Instead of Italian seasoning, I used about a teaspoon of thyme, but kept the rosemary amount the same.  Also, I melted the butter instead of using soft butter, it mixes better.  I will definitely make this again!

Everyone fights over the last piece! Its so good fresh out of the oven or cooled down. I added extra fresh rosemary and sprinkled extra italian seasoning on top. I didn't have parchment paper so I just buttered the baking sheet and it worked out great.

Mmmm. Smells great coming out of the oven (doesn't ned to brown very much on top). Mine took about 20 minutes. I used the whole amt. of rosemary in the bread (vs. on top) and it turned out fine. The only thing is that after one loaf, my bf and I were rosemary-ied out. I may try making this without any spices for plain loaves. Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious! This was my first attempt ever at making homemade bread and I am so pleased with how this turned out. The other reviewers had valuable tips, i.e., sprinkling the rosemary on AFTER the eggwash AND I used fresh thyme as half of the "Italian Seasoning" because I just happened to have some on hand. Definitely use fresh rosemary too. The house smelled amazing while it was cooking and it was super easy for a first timer but impressive enough flavor to serve guests!!

Yummy! So soft and fragrant... I didn't have Italian seasoning, or sage, or thyme, so I just used a heaping teaspoon each of oregano and basil. One thing I might try next time is putting all of the rosemary into the bread (instead of putting half on top) because the stuff on top just kept falling off.  This is definitely a keeper though.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for and I love how this bread turned out. I converted the flour volume to grams (360g), and the texture and density were perfect. I added a little shredded Parmesan cheese to the top before baking it in the Big Green Egg. It’s a very easy recipe and I’ll probably be making it at least once a month.

This is a great recipe. I have made the bread exactly as described and it was wonderful but for me an actual sandwich shape loaf is more user-friendly so this time I didn't do the 2 round loaves. I shaped the dough into 1 rectangle to fit my 9x5 inch loaf pan. Let it rise about an hour in that then preheated the oven to 425 but turned it down to 375 just before putting the loaf in. Baked for about 27 min. Came out beautiful. (see photo)

I made this bread two days ago and I am baking more today.....that's how fast it went!  I made exactly as the recipe stated (see no sense in rating and reviewing if changes have been made on first try).  I love the flavor and texture of the bread and it makes amazing toast!!!  The only change I am making today is that I am going to make it in one big loaf instead of two.  I am also going to place an "X" on it before the final rise in hope it will give me a little crispier crust which I do like!!  Can't lose with this one, a real keeper!!!!

10/10 amazing this bread was an instant hit. I added some thyme along with the rosemary for an added kick and it was delicious. Would recommend with the thyme as it just tastes better. Also smells amazing.

I should have stuck to the primal recipe but instead added 1 cup of whole wheat flour, the taste was good but reminded me of a danish rye bread. I also used fresh herbs from my garden including, rosemary, oregano, thyme and chives. It had a slight herb flavor, next time I wouldn’t be so shy. improved. It was more like a rye

No changes. Came out quite excellent. Made a double recipe. For the people having trouble, make sure your yeast is alive. The warm ( not over 105° F) and sugar  will make sure you know it's alive as it will turn into a foamy mixture in less than ten minutes.

Will be using this to make grilled cheese next time I make it in a loaf pan.

Tastes wonderful, and was fairly simple to make.  We dipped it in herbed garlic olive oil, and just the two of us could have polished off both loaves in one meal - it was hard to stop eating it!

This is one of my new favorites. The recipe is solid, I just like my bread softer, so I used less flour (about 2 1/2ish cups.) I also mixed the dry ingredients all together minus all the flour in order to get a good even dough. Then it's less likely that there will be clumps of salt or sugar. I did not knead for 10 mins though, so I think that would definitely mix everything thoroughly.

It was AWESOME! I made two loaves and Dad practically inhaled one of them! It was ten at night, so I didn't get any rosemary from the neighbor's garden, so I made the bread plain but oh boy, it was still good. I will DEFINITELY make this again. I. Loved. This!

I read through several of the reviews and a lot of people had great ideas...and I used several.  I subbed out the Italian seasoning and also sprayed with butter versus brushing with the egg.  I sent on to sprinkle with smoked salt flake and also tossed into the dough some munched garlic.

I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used finely diced fresh rosemary instead of dried. It turned out beautifully. It was flavorful without being overwhelmingly seasoned. It paired well with a lasagne, and we ate the second loaf with flavored olive oil to dip. In my oven, 20 minutes was a little under. 23 min was right on. A very nice recipe.

I made this with a student and it turned out great! The staff demanded seconds :)  We made both breadsticks and loaves with this recipe and both turned out great - fluffy with a nice crust. The combination of seasonings we used for the mix as well as for a dip afterwards was oregano, parsley, black pepper, red pepper, garlic, sea salt, and crushed rosemary. Also, we have a small herb garden and used fresh, dried rosemary for the bread, which made it very fragrant and tasty.

Delicious bread! I adapted it to bread machine which only changed the ingredient order. Made a HUGE loaf but still worked in my 2lb bread machine. I didn't carefully measure the rosemary and likely was over 2 tbsp but was incredible with our fresh rosemary.  My rosemary loving husband thinks it's super.
Update:  I forgot to mention that I added a tablespoon of gluten to the mix.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Whenever I crave bread,  I make this.  It has wonderful flavor, smell, and texture.

Random fact:  If you find it getting a little stale, just rap a moist paper towel around it and put it in the microwave.  In thirty seconds, it will come out fresh and warm.

I've made this bread twice now. It is tasty and smells wonderful. It went especially well with an Italian turkey sausage pasta dish I made. I plan to try it using my bread machine's dough cycle sometime.

I began making this recipe 2 years ago.  We love it!  I put all the rosemary within the dough.  I brush a small amount of olive oil on the 2 loaves and sprinkle with sea salt.  It is fun to make and give 1 loaf away as a gift.

Delicious! Only things I would do differently would be to add all of the rosemary to the bread, grease the paper and add cornmeal to it, and the next time i make this I think I will try just a tad more salt.

Delicious! Best bread ever! I followed the recipe but added a few  cloves of fresh chopped garlic to the mixture. I also made only one loaf from the listed ingredients. It came out of the oven smelling so good!  We ate it while it was still warm dipped in a mixture of  olive oil, balsamic vinegar & black pepper.

Yum! This came out incredibly good for my first attempt at making bread. My husband was super impressed. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour. My dough was very tacky so I needed the full 3 cups. I read the reviews and did an egg white wash, sprinkled remaining rosemary and some garlic powder on top and bake for 20 minutes. The crust was lightly browned and had a nice texture. The bread was a little dense but it was still really delicious. I made this because I had extra rosemary that I didn't know what to do with but I'll definitely be making this again.

Simply delicious.  I used fresh rosemary and put it all in the bread.  Used the dough cycle of my bread machine, and it was a cinch to make.  So easy and so good.  I also sprinkled kosher salt on top after brushing with egg wash, and the little surprises of salt were delicious.  The bread is nice and chewy, and my crust turned out the same.  Not crispy hard, but nice and chewy.  Thanks for this great recipe that I'll definitely use again....even with different herbs depending on what's for dinner.  A real winner here!

This is hands down the best bread recipe I've ever tried. It was so delicious, and my husband couldn't stop talking about how much he loved it (and he takes his job as the food critic in the house very seriously). I made a chicken and white cheese lasagna with it and whipped up a little dipping sauce of olive oil, butter, minced garlic and oregano, and it went perfectly with both. I didn't have yeast so I used a combo of lemon juice and baking soda, so they didn't get as big as I was expecting, but it was kind of nice because they turned out more like two large rolls which meant both he and I got our own little personal loaf.

Excellent recipe. Half the recipe is just right for 2-3 people 's dinner. The bread gets soggy at the bottom if you leave it in the tray so make sure you move it to a cooling rack or put it on top of a cotton towel. 
Also I made it in a small convection over at the recommended temperature and it took 40 minutes to bake but turned out just perfect. I love it so much I will make it again tomorrow this time adding olives to it.

My husband and I baked this bread to go with some homemade vegetable soup.  It was EASY -- and DELICIOUS!  We followed the recipe but used Olivio instead of butter and olive oil cooking spray instead of the olive oil.  The directions were excellent and easy to follow -- the soup and the bread were ready at the same time! --Since the two of us at one loaf with our soup!  -- we would probably double the recipe if we were having company

Really good bread.  Definitely worth having fresh rosemary though.  It makes the kitchen smell wonderful!

Oh my goodness!!! better double the recipe.  first time i ever tried to make bread. i got lucky and kneaded it just right. this is the best bread ive ever eaten. didnt use the oil though. used jiffy cornbread mix in place of corn meal on bottom of pan, and it gave it a sweet flavor. man oh man. it was good. should have told the neighbor it came out like a brick and we would have had 2 loaves all to ourselves. we have already eaten it within 30 minutes. best bread ever and very easy. i will make more tomorrow and double it. kat

WOW!!!  Who knew making bread was this simple!!  I just finished making mine and had to rate it right away.  It was so good!  I added all the rosemary into the bread giving it a chop.  Then I added full sprigs to the top.  I would recommend placing the loaves on seperate baking sheets while on the second rise.  I covered mine with a large bowl, allowing it plenty of room to rise.  Even my 2 y/o is munching away!

Delicious is the word!  I think I ate more than half of this bread all by myself.  It was fantastic!  I mixed all of the rosemary in.  I used unsalted butter and saw another review about it not being salty enough w/ unsalted, so I sprinkled a little table salt on top before baking and it was wonderful!  I just made one loaf with all of it.  This bread made me happy.

Delicious and a great bread for a first time bread maker.  I found the instructions about the third cup of flour a little confusing.  You don't need to work in the entire cup if your dough is in good shape - I tried to do it just wouldn't accept any more after 2.5 cups.  Anyway, I'm not that crazy about rosemary but this bread is delicious!

Threw everything in the bread machine and came out great. Even after I misread and threw in that beaten egg! Didn't have any italian seasoning so I added some basil, sage, etc. Thanks, really great.

I am not an experienced bread baker and this recipe became an instant favorite. Turned out perfectly! My husband loved and it is so easy.  The loaves are beautiful with fresh rosemary on top. I didn't brush mine with egg. I did drizzle about 1/2 tsp of olive oil on the finished loaf hot from the oven.
Easy great recipe!

I use about double the rosemary that this recipe calls for, but that's just a matter of personal preference. This bread is savory and delicious for sandwiches, snacking, or to serve with dinner and is absolutely unbelievable made into bread bowls with Chicken Portugese from "Cooking at the Academy: California Cooking Academy" (out of print, but available cheaply through online used book sellers, I would highly recommend it).

This was delicious. The olive oil lets the rosemary stick to the bread so the egg is probably not even necessary though I did use the egg this time around.

This is very tasty-even though I accidently used unsalted butter and it needs a more little salt due to that mistake. Very tasty dipped in balsalmic vinegar. Thanks!

I used this bread as my excuse to finally get to use my rosemary from my garden! I usually use my bread machine for any breads, but since I had a lot of family over last night for manicotti, I decided to go all out and make this by hand.  Though I couldn't get my yeast to bubble nor my rosemary to be chopped finely, the bread didn't last.  Next time I'll have to make twice as much.  It was easy and fun to make.  I smeared the top of mine with olive oil, garlic salt and garnished with rosemary.  We used wine and olive oil for dipping sauce.  It was the best bread I've ever made!!  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh, I should also mention that I didn't have Italian seasoning...but it still came out fantastic!

Very easy to make, and wow, what a wonderful flavor! The only change I made was making the dough the day before baking. I left it in the refrigerator overnight, covered in the bowl. Then, on the day I baked it followed the instructions per the recipe, let it stand at room temperature for 1 hour to rise and then baked according to the original recipe. The bread was a huge success. It tastes just like the bread you get at Macaroni Grill.

This bread was incredible! I made two loaves, as the recipe indicated, and the first one was gone within ten minutes of coming out of the oven. This was the first bread I've ever made (besides the ones I helped my mom with when I was a kid) and it turned out beautifully. 

I used a pinch of oregano and a pinch of parsley in place of Italian seasoning. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and even though I overkneaded by about ten minutes (lots of distractions!) the bread turned out great and was a huge hit. Perfect for gifting because of the size and shape. Definitely something I'll make again.

i rate this about a 4 and a half. the texture is really good, but the flavor is just a teensy tiny bit bland. maybe i should have dusted the top with a little garlic. but still very good, will definitely make again.

This was my first attempt to make bread without a bread machine.  It was perfect!  I love rosemary, so I put at least 2 tablespoons of rosemary in the dough and sprinkled more on top, and I left out the Italian seasoning completely.  This bread is fantastic.  It had such a lovely texture that I cannot seem to capture by making the dough in a bread machine.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I'm not sure if it was how I baked it or what, but it was very dense and didn't rise as I would have liked it. Also, the consistency of the bread seemed stale. Again, it may have been me, but overall I wasn't totally impressed. The rosemary taste was delicious though.

As far as bread goes, this was so easy.  I used all Italian seasoning.  It is very good bread.

Very good.  I made the dough in my machine on dough cycle.  I then punched down and let rise for about a half hour and baked.  At first I thought the rosemary taste was overwhelming, but when I added butter on the bread, it complimented it nicely.  Whole family liked.  Thanks

It's hard to go wrong with this recipe.  I've made it exactly as is and I've also altered the quantity and variety of herbs and it always turns out.  This was the first bread recipe I've ever tried and my whole family loves it.  You've made me look really good!  Thanks!

Very delicious - always comes out with great texture and never dry.

I didn't have rosemary so I used basil and Italian Seasoning.  Have made at least six loaves of this and it is delicious every time.

THANKS for posting this recipe.

Even though I added all the rosemary to the dough and didn't save any for the garnishing, the bread was very good. It makes two small loaves--just right for two dinners for two.
