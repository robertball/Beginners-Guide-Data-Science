OH YEAH!!! My family absolutely love this pie. The only thing I will do differently the next time I make it is double the filling recipe to better fill my deep dish pie pans. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!

Good as is, but adding finely grated lemon zest and lemon juice (instead of vinegar) makes for more depth of flavor. Once I did this, my mother-in-law (whose family was Pennsylvania Dutch) thought the taste was "just right."

This is a wonderful pie!  My dad has been requesting a raisin pie for weeks.  My mother (now deceased) used to make Dad raisin pies, but I never got her recipe, and I have not been able to find the one she used.  I printed this receipe off and made it without making any changes.  It was delicious!  My dad loved it and said it was the best raisin pie he has ever had, and he has had many raisin pies over the years!  I think this had to be my mom's recipe.  It is very easy to make, and it tastes great!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

I made this for my husband's birthday, because he loves raisin pie, and he really loves this one! I made a few changes---I substituted 1/4 cup of spiced rum for an equal amount of the water, I used lemon juice in place of the vinegar, and I used a mix of golden raisins with regular raisins, because I have found golden raisins to plump more and be sweeter/tastier. Love this pie!

This pie was exceptional.  I did use lemon juice in place of the vinegar and doubled the filling.  There would definitely not been enough filling had you followed the recipe.  I used a 9 inch pie pan.  Will definitely make again.

I made this pie as a special favor for a friend of mine (even though I'd never heard of such a thing)and he said this was the best raisin pie he'd ever eaten. I have a feeling I will get additional requests for it in the future. My only comment is that I would make 1 1/2 to 2 times the filling because I like my fruit pies to be HIGH.  I also like to brush the crust with milk and sprinkle with granulated sugar before I bake it. This makes for a very pretty presentation and a tastier "bone".

I found this identical recipe in a McCall's magazine around 1980 and have made it several times over the years.  Fortunately I have three grandchildren (two are twins just two and a half years old) and they're crazy about raisins in any form so they love this.  I've always liked the flavors of orange and raisins together so I make a little orange glaze and drizzle it over the top of this and everybody likes that too.  Just combine a little powdered sugar and some frozen concentrate for orange juice, or else some grated orange rind and water with the powdered sugar.  I've used lemon juice in place of the vinegar once or twice but never noticed any taste difference.

A word of caution:  when you bake most fruit pies such as apple, blueberry etc. you don't remove the pie from the oven until the filling starts bubbling out of the slits in the top crust.  That ensures that your filling is "cooked."  But with this pie the filling is already cooked before you pour it into the shell, so all you're doing is baking the crust.  Cornstarch reacts negatively to being "cooked twice."  In fact it "breaks down" if cooked a second time.  So with this pie, follow the timing suggested and take the pie out of the oven as soon as you're satisfied that the crust is browned to your liking and don't wait for the filling to "bubble up" through the slits.  The second cooking may cause the cornstarch to break down and you'll have a runny filling.

I found this recipe by accident, and remembered I've had a raisin pie as a kid, tho I don't remember where. Easy to make, using a ready made pie crust, and it was a hit. My wife, who doesn't even CARE for raisins liked it. It was a hit at our church supper as well. This is a keeper!

Raisin Pie is my Dad's favourite so I made this for his birthday. I have to give it 5 stars based on his review, which was an enthusiastic 'wouldn't change a thing'. Um, he didn't share any of it with anybody.

This recipe is fantastic. I use Splenda brown sugar blend to cut back on the sugar and the pie disappears.

Great recipe. One small change is to add one more tablespoon of cornstarch to the filling to stiffen it a bit more so it doesn't flow out of the crust when you cut the pie.

YES!!!  I finally found a great raisin pie recipe for my 93 yr old dad.  His mom used to make it for their LARGE (11 kids) family. If you like raisins.. & cinnamon, this is for you.  I soak the raisins in hot water for about a 1/2 hour, before proceeding with the recipes..YUMMY!!!  Never thought I'd like raisin pie.. BUT I DO!!!

My husband was been begging for a raisin pie for his birthday for the past 10 years. I found this one and decided to give it a try. It was wonderful!  I was very skeptic of liking it, but I will make it again and again. It was so easy! I did use lemon juice and zest and Iadded Bacardi rum and vanilla extract to the water when I cooked the raisins. I am very pleased!

The best raisin pie I've ever had the pleasure of making. I followed someone else's hint of using fresh lemon juice instead of vinegar & add a tad more cornstarch for extra thickening. I also like to mix a little powdered sugar & cream together & drizzle over the cooled pie. Always gets raves. Thank you for sharing...

I was looking for a good old fashion raisin pie recipe to make for my parents (Mom 86, Dad 90) and this one was a big hit with them, with each eating seconds.  I did use lemon juice instead of the vinegar as other reviews mentioned. This is a great recipe.

We were a house divided :)  I read the reviews and did double the filling.  I think I would probably prefer not doubling filling, but my husband loved it with the extra filling.  Taste was awesome.  Almost like a very mild mincemeat pie.

Just like Gramma used to make.. except she made the pies on cookie sheets!  Made this exactly as instructed but doubled the recipe as suggested.  Could have actually only just 1 1/2'd the recipe for my 10" glass pie pan as I had filling left over (oh my! left over goodness? dreadful lol!)  No fault of the recipe.. just me wanting more of a good thing! =)

I'm not a fan of raisin anything so I'm rating this for my mom.  Raisin pie is her FAVORITE and I made this just for her.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added a little more cinnamon and about a teaspoon of orange zest.  She said it was perfect - just the way a raisin pie should be...and then she took the whole thing home!

I have never had or heard of raisin pie before when a friend of mine commented "don't you just wish you could find raisin pie like mom/grammie used to make"....to which I said..."yuck".  After the same fried had a radical surgery and tramatic diagnosis I made this pie for her and took it to her home.  She loved it...closed her eyes and said..."it taste's just like my grandmothers".  I would consider that a success!!

You have to really like raisins to enjoy this one, but it is good. Like others, I used lemon juice instead of vinegar and would recommend making it that way. I also doubled the recipe since I had a deep dish pie.

I don't like cooked raisins, so I didn't actually taste it, but my mom and brother really liked it.  They said it was really good, but really sweet.  I can say it is definitely very easy.  I replaced the vinegar with lemon juice.  It cooks quickly once the cornstarch is added, so watch carefully.

My Dad is no longer with us, but I made this Raisin pie for Christmas in honor of his memory. My sister and I would make Raisin pie for him every year, as it was his favorite. I loved this recipe!

I didn't have access to my Raisin Pie recipe so I tried this one since the reviews were all high. I doubled the amount of filling as I made a deep dish pie. The only thing I did different was, as per my recipe of many many years, I soaked the raisins in Canadian Mist for several hours. I always do this and think it gives a richness to the pie and leaves no alcohol taste. You;ll WOW! your raisin lovers with this recipe!! Thanks for posting this recipe.

I made this today for my father-in-law's birthday, as raisin is his favorite pie, and it was well-received by all.

The recipe is excellent as far as ingredients and method, however, at the suggestion of others I essentially doubled the recipe to nicely fill a 9" pie. I used a 3 1/2 cup bulk package of raisins to 3 1/2 cups of water, and doubled the remaining ingredients. I did use lemon juice instead of vinegar, but have made it both ways. (I just happened to have a lemon on hand that needed to be used.)

This raisin pie tasted awesome! The problem I had with it was it was not moist enough. Maybe if I increased everything but the raisins by half ?  Any suggestions ?? If I can make it more moist it will be deeeelicious.

My grandma used to make half moon raisin pies.  She would roll out small pie crusts about 8in in diameter and fold them over and pinch the sides, and they were delicious!  This is the same recipe, only in one big pie instead of small ones.  She didn't put vinegar in her raisins.

Very very tasty.... The only change I made was to add about a cup of homemade applesauce under the raisins as I love apple and raisin together, and like lots of filling in my pie.

I made this pie for my father on Fathers' Day because he said he just loves raisin pie and hasn't had it for soooo long.  Well, both he and my husband said the pie was outstanding.  It was also easy to make. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  I discovered, however, that I'm not as much of a raisin pie fan as my father and husband.  I will make it again - - for them.

my mother-in-law can no longer cook and asked me to fix her husband a raisin pie. i had never made one before but it was a BIG HIT and i was told not to lose the recipe. My husband has just informed me after 32 years of marriage his mom used to make them for him all the time, so, he is next on the list!

A real natural, satisfying, healthy and tasty pie. I ate it cooled (but NOT chilled) yesterday (the day I made it) and it was good. Today, I put it in the warm oven for about 20-30 minutes, and it was wonderful. My family enjoyed it with a scoop of ice-cream and told me it tasted better. A new keeper in my recipe book.

This was an excellent recipe, even given that I forgot the vinegar and butter, and I baked it at 400 because I had another pie in the oven that was supposed to be baked at 350.  If I make it again, I'll mix the cornstarch with a little water before putting it in with the raisins because I didn't manage to get all the lumps out.

I made this pie for thanksgiving this year. I actually tripled the recipe because i was making a deep dish pie. And it turned out wonderful. I did not make any changes at all and it was so good. It was the first time i made and ate raisin pie, im actually eating a piece now as i type. I made it for my grandmothers whose favorite pie is raisin and they LOVED it. I recommend if you have tried this recipe to do so. Its great!

Definitely a great raisin pie!  I made this to share with Mom & Dad and they loved it! Using a store bought crust, I found this to be a quick & easy. The recipe is wonderful as written.  I will be making it again soon.

I was given a lot of raisins and had to find a way to use them. Found this recipe two days ago and have just made my second pie. Hubby loves it.

My favorite pie so far. Agree it needs to be doubled to make a decent pie. Also...I use one cup spiced rum with three cups water instead of for cups of water, three tablespoons lemon juice instead of two tbsp vinegar, and a generous handful of chopped walnuts! Amazing.

My father loves this pie. He is 80 years young. I used an 8 inch pie pan instead of a 9 inch pie pan and it was perfect. Easy recipe and brought back memories for one I love dearly.

I used frozen pie crusts and doubled the recipe. It was an instant favorite. Not to sweet and plump juicy raisins. 
I will definitely make this one again.

This recipe has a number of issues, I'm surprised by all the 5 star ratings. ??

First of all, some of  the measures are not accurate ,  especially for the raisins, you definitely need at least a cup and a half or even two MORE. I also decreased water to about 1 1/2 c. 

Definitely go with lemon zest and juice.

Sugar can be cut down, raisins are already very sweet.

I added more cinnamo, to taste.
 
Biggest issue was the temperature. I baked for 10  minutes at 425 then decreased to 375 for 30 additional minutes. At 425 for the whole time, I would expect crust to be very burnt.

With these changes above, the pie turned out beautifully. It also brought some great childhood memories to mind . That is worth some stars  too.??

I made this recipe almost immediately after looking at the recipe. It is the first time I ever made a raisin pie. I never have eaten raisin pie in my life. It was delicious!!! My husband loves raisin pie and I wanted to make one for him. I am so glad that I got to make his favorite pie. He said it was the best raisin pie he had ever eaten. :)

Made this today, I doubled recipe as others suggested, I also put some imitation rum flavouring in it, but baking it on 425 for 30 mins was too long, next time I will reduce the heat after 10 or 15 minutes.

I'll try this again, next time wearing my reading glasses. I doubled the recipe and quadrupled the sugar by mistake. My family graciously ate it while I kept saying it was too sweet. It looked lovely though!

I have made this three times and love the recipe.  I followed someone's suggestion for substituting spiced rum for some of the water.  Also doubled the recipe as we like a full, deep-dish pie.  It is in the oven right now.

What does it mean to "cook and stir until syrup is clear"? The syrup never gets clear. Maybe time to cook would be helpful.

Big hit! Only chance was to switch lemon juice for the vinegar, and I soaked the raisins for a bit longer before adding other ingredients.

My husband's favourite pie... in fact he asks for this pie on his birthday instead of birthday cake. It really is delicious!

Just finished making this. I simply adore raisin pie. Always have. Does anybody turn the heat down after a while.?I have read several recipes that have said both ways.

Great recipe, but I shouldn't of doubled the filling! It tastes wonderful with the lemon juice substitution of the vinegar, but now I have enough filling for two, possibly three pies. Maybe my pie dish just isn't as deep as all the other reviews who said the original amount wasn't enough, but as far as I know I have a standard 9 inch glass pie dish.  I suppose I'll freeze the leftover filling and make another pie in the future, but I'm kind of bummed about buying extra stuff when I didn't need it.

This is my all-time favorite pie and this recipe makes it so easy to make and enjoy.  I had never actually made it myself, as my grandmother used to make it for me all the time....but THIS recipe is just like hers !!!!    FANTASTIC!!
I did increase the ingredients to better fit a deep dish pie shell.

I used zest a lemon and 2 tablespoons lemon juice instead of the vinegar. Next time I think I will use 3 cups of raisins and increase other ingredients accordingly so my deep dish pie pan is full.

Made for my hubby's birthday as a surprise since he was reminiscing about his grandmother's raisin pie.  Easy to make.  I also did as other reviewers had done and substituted lemon juice for the vinegar.   I only had a deep dish pie plate, so I doubled the filling.  Would not do that again.  In fact, even if I made the amount the recipe calls for, I personally would still end up scraping about half of that out.  Was VERY sweet and obviously not for wishy-washy raisin lovers.  My husband liked it, but said the filling to crust ratio was way off...which was 100%  my fault.  He ate his with softened butter placed under the top crust like he used to do as a kid.  Said it cut the sweetness,  but I didn't try mine that way.  So next time,  I  won't  double the filling (and if anything,  put in less than the recipe makes), will add a little more lemon juice and will cover thd edges with aluminum  foil after the first 20 min of baking.

This pie is delicious.  Was skeptical about the vinegar, but tried it.  I did double the recipe for a 9 inch pie.  A winner!

Excellent!  I added a cup of coarsley chopped walnuts  after cooking the filling like my Mom used to, the flavors really compliment each other.  I would double the filling recipe next time for a thicker pie.

Pretty good.  Double the filling ingredients (bake for 30-35 minutes still).  Use lemon juice instead of vinegar.  Try boiling the raisins in 3 cups of water instead of 4 -- the filling was very liquidy when this was made the first time on 1/20/13.

I made the recipe as written using Cook's Illustrated's Foolproof pie dough.  I was so excited when my dad told me that if he had closed his eyes, he wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this pie and what his mom used to make.  I've been trying to find a recipe to make my dad happy for years, and finally!  Here it is!!!  THANK YOU!

The lemon juice and the lemon zest make this pie a little too lemony for me. I'll cut back on the zest to about 1/2 next time and this will be a 5-star pie.

To be fair, this is the first raisin pie I've tried.  Maybe we just don't like raisin pie.  It tasted like raisins in a crust--nothing special or spectacular.  I won't make this recipe again.
