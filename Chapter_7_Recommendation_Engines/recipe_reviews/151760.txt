I loved this dessert! it was so easy and everyone loves it! I was a little worried that the cake would get mushy, so I made it only twenty min. before eating, but the left overs i put in the frige, were just as tasty.( and not really mushy)

Very easy to do and you can try so many things with this the possibilities are endless. I made this back in the summer using whip cream, vanilla pudding, fresh fruit and cake. It was so delicious even my in-laws (who are very picky sometimes) loved it!

I made this recipe for a party and it was devoured - everybody loved it.  I used angel food cake instead of pound cake.  Someone at the party said that this recipe was a keeper!

I was looking for something quick at the last minute.  I didn't have pound cake so I made it with yellow cake mix.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  It is even good left over, not too mushy. It was light on a hot day too!

I made this just as a family dessert and used pre-sliced butter creme cake and devil's food flavored pudding. It was absolutely amazing. I plan on making this dish often.

I made this for a get together and the average rating from everyone was 4 stars. I made this with an angel food cake and used low fat whipped topping. At first taste I thought it was too simple. Tasted like chocolate pudding with whipped cream on top of cake. But after it sat in the fridge for 2 days it was very, very good. For the get together it chilled in the fridge for 5 hours, but if I make it again I will let it sit for at least 24. The up side to this dessert is that it is very easy and quick to prepare.

Very good! I made two versions: chocolate and strawberry. With the strawberry I used vanilla pudding. I made these awhile ago and can't remember which one people liked more but I can remember both were well received.

Very good! Made it exactly as the recipe called. Next time I think I would mix the Cool Whip in with the pudding and maybe add some Toffee.

I thought this was too sweet and I even used dark chocolate syrup.  I will, however make it again with these changes: real whipped cream lightly sweetened and some toasted coconut or almonds for garnish.
