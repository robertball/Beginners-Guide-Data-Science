My daughters and I made this and it was awesome.  Instead of boiling the water and sugar mixture on the stove I put it in the microwave for 1min. when done I added some ice to cool it down so it did not take long to make at all.  Very refreshing.

This one's a keeper.  Yes, it is labor intensive.  Hey, you might even build up your triceps with all that lemon twisting action - but, if you have the time, the effort is well worth it.  This recipe IS quite sweet, so if your tastes preference runs closer to tart, go easy on the sugar.  I needed six or seven lemons to make  1 1/2 cups of lemon juice.

YUM! This was so good!  And it did not take 4 hours to make, even though I squeezed all the lemons by hand since I didn't have a juicer.  The trick is to soak the lemons in hot water for 10 mins and roll each lemon on the counter before you cut and squeeze.  I only used 1 1/4 C of sugar and added a little more water.  Very good recipe!  Thanks Jo!

I live in Venezuela, where lemons are virtually nonexistent, so I decided to adapt this recipe to make "limeade", with very pleasant results. I used 10 limes to make 1 1/2 cups of juice, added the juice to the syrup mix after it had cooled just slightly, immediately transferred the mixture to a one-gallon pitcher, and topped it off with cold water. The whole procedure took less than ten minutes, and made a very nice alternative to the usual  lemonade.

Very, very good lemonade Jo.  I actually made a cherry limeade by using half limes and adding cherry juice at the end.  My 4 year old loved it.  Highly recommended.  Thanks for sharing.

This was wonderful!  I served it at a Mother's Day barbeque, and everyone loved it.
Since it was served in a large clear container, I floated two lemons sliced into rounds, and also half a bunch of fresh mint leaves.  Very pretty, and the mint added a nice touch of flavor.

This was the first time I made lemonade with the simple syrup and I really think it was worth the extra step as it eliminates having to stir forever to make sure the sugar is dissolved. Degree of sweetness is a matter of individual taste and preference, but 1-1/4 cups of sugar was just right for my tastebuds. Will make lemonade with this simple syrup recipe from now on!

This lemonade is so good! I scaled it down to 10 servings. But I ran out of lemons and I used a small lime. But it still tasted great.I like that it's sweet and not too sour.

I am not a lemonade fan but my siblings like it.  They said it was good...but not enough sugar.  Well, you know how 10 year olds can be with the sugar thing.  Thanks for posting.

The family likes this recipe.  The only changes I make is I juice 4 lemons (which gives about 2 cups) and I also juice one orange into it. The orange "rounds out" the flavor.  Also, to get the most possible juice from your lemons?  Nuke each lemon for 30 seconds, turn over and then 30 seconds more.  Makes a big difference in the amount of juice you get and makes it easier to juice them in general.

I've made this several times and its always comes out great - The only change I make is to thinly peel the lemons and add the peel to the sugar/water mixture on the stove, cooking for about 10-15 minutes.  It adds extra lemon flavor and adds some lovely color to the lemonade.  Make sure you strain out the cooked peels before mixing in the additional water.

Refreshing!  I used lemon juice from concentrate because it was all I had.  I also added a few fresh raspberries into the glass, oooh that was really good.  Next time I'll add some vodka & make it an "adult" drink!  Thanks Jo!

One of the best lemonades I've ever had.
Took a while for me to squeeze the lemon juice out since I didn't have any contraptions for that.  I nuked them in the microwave for 10 seconds and then rolled them on the counter, so that 6 lemons gave me the appropriate juice.

My family loved this lemonade.  I used Splenda to sweeten instead of sugar and it was still delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Wow, tasted wonderful and refreshing!  Followed the recipe to the t, made no changes. It was a tad bit sweet, but that could be fixed easily.  Thank you Jo! UPDATE:  I tried using this recipe to make raspberry lemonade by using fresh raspberries.  Anyhow, lets just say, it tasted nothing like the ones you find at the fine restaurants...I'll keep on experimenting.

My daughter just finished 2nd grade and to celebrate we made this recipe together.  She loves lemonade and wanted to make it from scratch.  I liked the simplicity of the recipe. We had a great time together and this is truly "The Best Lemonade Ever"!

Way to sweet for my taste, I reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cup.  Also to speed things up I added ice to the sugar water mixture to cool it down.  When the ice melts measure the amount so you know how much additional water to add.

Yum! Sweet and tasty!  My 5 year old said, "It tastes so good!"  If you like a more tart lemonade, I would use less sugar or more lemon, but I like it on the sweet side, and this was perfect in my opinion.

I really like this lemonade. If you think it's too sweet, use as much sugar as you want. I use 1 1/3 -1 1/4 cup of sugar. Depending on the size of your lemons, 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice equals 7-8 lemons. Don't forget to leave the pulp. It makes the lemonade look so pretty and it tastes good, too.

Wonderful!!! I used 6 lemons to get th juice. And instead of using sugar, I substituted with Splenda. I ended up using 1 cup of Splenda. Since Spleda dissolves, I did not have to heat it. I just added all the ingredients together and stirred.

I first made this lemonade at my mom's house for our Mother's Day Dinner and I did not make enough according to my family. I thought everyone would drink most of the soda's and tea that was available so I only made a one gallon jug. My husband loved it so much,  one week later he was chairing a meeting so he wanted me to make the lemonade for him to take and he said everyone just loved it. Since our Mother's Day get together I have received many request from my family to make the lemonade because I do such a great job at it. It is Summer and I have had to make a calendar to keep up with the request of orders from my family on when they want me to fix the lemonade for them. I just need to give them the recipe and let them do it but none have asked so I guess I will keep doing it until I get tried of it.  But being honest with myself I do not get tried of the compliments.  Thanks for sharing.

To make a more "tart" and less sweet lemonade.  I made the simple syrup using only 1 cup of sugar to the one cup of water.  I also make extra of the syrup to speed up the process next time I make the recipe.  Very good reviews from those who tasted it.

Tart and sweet... Just how we like it!  If you don't like it that way, let it mellow
down with some ice cubes.  Will definitely make many more times 'cause I 
have 2 lemon trees bursting with fruit.

I didn't think a recipe like this that was so basic would turn out to taste SO good.  This is by far the best lemonade I have ever had!  I strained the pulp out (because of a picky three year old).  It was easy enough that I will make this all the time.  I can hardly wait to enjoy this in the Summer.  Thank you Jo!

Wow, melted sugar is the trick... great idea! I made this recipe in 10 minutes. i put water/sugar mix on stove, cut the peel off 5 large lemons and ran them through my electric juicer. I filled a CERAMIC pitcher(dont use glass pitcher) with ice and added lemon juice, then poured the hot syrup in a thin stream through ice. Add water to taste. Yum!

This was really the best!  I had never made fresh lemonade before.  before I cut the lemons I used my microplane to zest them.  I froze the zest in a baggie for future use!  I will definately be making this all summer!

I've never made homemade lemonade before.  Oh my goodness this is the best stuff.  I didn't change a thing from the recipe.  It's not hard at all to make - don't be put off by the 4 hour time-frame....most of that is just to chill the liquids to ice-cold temperatures.  If you are impatient like me, just use ice cubes in your glass!  Thank you, Jo, for a wonderful recipe.  I've shared it with all my friends just now over the internet.  If my husband doesn't come home soon, he's not going to get to taste this stuff....I'm going to drink it all!

Very good lemonade; although, I didn't taste a difference between this lemonade and the batch I made just adding straight ultrafine baker's sugar.  It sure saved time not to have to disolve the sugar and wait for it to cool.  (Also, I used a little less sugar for a more tart lemonade.)

Easy peasy with no squeezie!  I used concentrate!  :)  * I made this again using fresh lemons and it was sooo good!  Lots more work but much fresher tasting!  Either way you make it it is a great recipe!

Good, easy to make recipe for fresh lemonade.  I've made it about 10 times since I first found it here a couple of months ago.  NOTE: I changed the sugar to 1.5 cups because I found it a bit too sweet.

This was a delicious and easy lemonade recipe. I combined the juice from 1lb of strawberries to it - it made a great, sweet addition to an already refreshing drink. Personally I was too impatient to wait for the syrup to chill and blended everything right off the bat. I served it over ice and it was wonderful! Thank you Jo. :)

I made this for Easter.  It was very good.  I hand-squeezed 8 LARGE lemons, and still did not have enough so I supplemented in some Lemon Juice from the jar.  It does not make as much as it says it does.  I filled 8 large glasses with it, and we were out!

I made this recipe for 20 servings.. It was too sweet. The second time I modified it using half cup less sugar and half cup more lemon juice.. Then I added about half a tray of ice.. YUM!!! I like my lemonade pretty tart though.. Thanks for the base recipe!!!

We made this for a lemonade stand that the kids had for Hurricane Katrina victims over the weekend.  Every adult that tried it said that it was the BEST homemade lemonade they had ever had.  Very easy, refreshing, and delicious!

I bought some lemons to make another dish from this website and used the last of them for this drink. I started with only 1 1/3c sugar ~ perfect for me and my family. If you want "gourmet" lemonade - this is the way to go, but "Country Time" certainly is cheaper. I'll save this recipe for showers and other get-togethers when I really want to make a good impression.

I made it following the recipe...TERRIFIC! Then, because of dietary issues and a diabetic friend, made it with Splenda® using same amount as sugar in recipe. This is excellent and I make it that way all the time now.

This recipe was perfect for my son's 1st birthday party! Everyone enjoyed it so much.  I doubled the recipe, and instead of boiling just the sugar and a portion of the water (by accident), I boiled the entire mixture of sugar and water.  Still was perfect!  Took a little longer of course.. but worth it.

This is a refreshing and easy drink. No need for  the fuss of stirring the granulated sugar until it dissolves in the pitcher! I also tried it with limes and it was also good. Sometimes, the lemonade was a little bit too sweet so I added a couple of ice cubes and 1-2 Tbsp more of lemon juice.

I'd use a bit less sugar next time, but it was wonderful.

This was good, but I think the recipe for Vintage Lemondade is better.  That recipe however does take longer to make and in a pinch I will use this one again.

Very tasty.  Was looking to make some lemonade like one from a famous fast food restaurant.  This was close.  *You will need about 6 lemons to get enough juice for this recipe.*

This is a great recipe, a little over-sweet for my tastes.  I have used the recipe twice now, and the second time, lessened the sugar to 1 cup and found it to be much more enjoyable.

I had never made homemade lemonade before...and this was pretty easy.  It was a little on the sweet side, like some others have said.  I only had 2 large lemons on hand...and hadn't planned on making lemonade until I found this recipe.  The other favorable reviews made me crave the stuff, so I made it using half fresh, half bottled lemon juice.  Maybe using all fresh lemon juice would have made it a bit tarter?  Anyway, delicious!  I will make this again!! Thanks!

Wow am I glad I stumbled upon this recipe and tried it.  Better than any store bought lemonade and about as easy to make!  I used 6 large lemons and it was the perfect amount.  Didn't need to alter anything-it tasted great!!  Thank you for sharing this!!

I enjoyed the freshness of this old time favorite.  I have made it exactly to the recipe and found it to sweet for my taste, so I now use 1 1/4 cup of sugar instead and I like the zip this gives.  I will make this again and again.

Second to some of the alcholic drinks served at our 4th of July bash - this was the best holiday/summer drink ever! Followed the recipe to the letter and everyone wanted more. Better than the powdered Country Time mix anyday! 1 glass is worth every squeeze of the lemon! Thanks!

This is a delicious recipe. It was a little too sweet and too tart for me. After some minor adjustments, it turned out to be perfect. I use 1 cup of sugar instead of what the original recipe calls for. I'm already making my second batch!

I liked the idea of disolving the sugar,  but I found this to be WAY too sweet.  Of course all the kids I made it for loved it, but the adults didn't.  Next time I will add much more lemon juice and it will be perfect.

This was good, but WAY too sweet. I tried diluting with water but I didn't want to lose the lemon flavor.  Next time, I'll add much less sugar (1/2 to 3/4 the amount called for).

Also, I scaled this to 10 servings.  Squeezing 4 lemons gave about 3/4 cup of lemon juice, then I added back in the pulp.  Resulted in 2 small- to medium-sized glasses of lemonade.

My husband loved this.  I made it scaled down to 4 cups of water, but I added five instead, and I strained the pulp out. What has prevented me from making lemonade before was the gritty sugar left over, but this method gets rid of it.  Thanks!!

I really like this recipe.  I tried to cut down on the sugar, but it didn't taste right.  I ended up putting the sugar that I didn't put in.  Follow the recipe.  It's fine the way it is.  I've made this recipe so much I found shortcuts for myself.  I normally just microwave the sugar and a cup or two of water in a mug and throw it on in my jug after it's done. Seriously, this recipe is dummy proof.  I thought that this recipe was so incredibly simple and I was right! I'm so impressed that it was so good.  :)

I used 1 3/4 cups of lemon juice and 1 3/4 of sugar. I didn't boil the sugar water just warmed it while continously stirring it. I added the lemon juice and syrup to 7 cups of refridgerated water. It was ready in seconds! My family loved it! Took me 2 bags of sm/md lemons.

Easy, tasty, fresh. :)
The only difference was that I cut the sugar down to one cup, but I also decreased water to 7 cups total.  No need to let it chill for 4 hours.  I let the syrup chill while I juiced the lemons, and then mixed them together and chilled overnight.

Very good, although lemons put out a lot less juice than you might think, so buy extras and try to talk your husband into being responsible for juicing them!

Really good and easy to make.  My husband loves lemonade and now this is his favorite recipe!  The ratio of sugar and lemon is perfect for that lip puckering sweet-tart taste.  Tip:  To get the most juice  from your lemons, blast them in the microwave for 10-15 seconds, then roll on the counter.  Juices will burst thru as soon as you begin to cut the lemon open!

This was fantastic!  I used 8 lemons for this recipe and followed the recipe exactly.  I followed others advice and soaked the lemons in hot water for ten minutes prior to juicing.  I've never had so much juice come out of a lemon before!  That may be one of my favorite new cooking techniques!

"I'm in heaven...."(singing)!  I must say, this is some **GOOD STUFF!!**  It tastes so much like Dairy Queen's lemonade.  It's chilling in the fridge and I'm just about to treat my children to their first homemade lemonade on this hot, Southern spring day.  Fantastic, delicious,   5*****stars!!!

This was a GREAT way to blend the ingredients.  But the mix was not right for me.  I scaled it to 10 servings (4 cups of water), but it was still too sour and too sweet.  I added an extra cup of water and it was better, but still very sweet.  I will try adjusting the ingredients.  But I do love how there's no gritty sugar at the bottom...and it tastes the same at the top of the cup and the bottom of the cup.

This is the very best way to make homemade lemonade. There were no sugar particles floating around in the drink as it was completely dissolved. This lemonade is just like the fresh squeezed lemonade you get when you go out. I will definitely make this again. It was very easy and did not take 4 hours to make. I let the syrup chill in the refrigerator while I cooked and then I added water to it that was already in my refrigerator. It turned out great! Thank you.

Great recipe - YUMMY.  I made it with only 1 cup of sugar and it was PLENTY sweet enough.  Next time I'll make it with 3/4 cup and see what happens.  I can't imagine how sweet this would be with 1.75c of sugar.

This recipe may look like it's too much work just for lemonade, but it really isn't. My syrup boils, cools and is refrigerated for about 2 hours max before I mix it with the juice. 
I find that it takes about 9 large lemons to get enough lemon juice and now I keep a spare batch of simple syrup in the fridge for when I want to make another pitcher.
So very worth it! Just double your simple syrup recipe and put some aside for next time.

Very good recipe!  I didn't add in all of the simple syrup and I added the rind from 1 lemon.  Gives it a more refreshing taste.  

Tastes great when you stick some in a bowl, put it in the freezer and make it a little slushy like.

Way too sweet. I tried this recipe twice, following the instructions exactly. I ended up adding more lemon juice and water to it to balance out the sweetness. I think next time I will just add the sugar to taste instead of adding it all in at once.

My 4 year old has been begging me to make Lemonade, so I finally bought the lemons and we followed this easy recipe. It was perfect!  Not too sweet, but enough to cut the sour. Thank you so much for making my daughter's day sunny!

Is too sweet as written for our tastes- increased water to 9 cups and lemon juice to 2 cups and then it is perfect. update 6/27: made with Splenda once and also with mashed fresh strawberries sometimes, really good. Thanks this is our recipe!

One word comes to mind and that is "GREAT" (and I don't even like lemons)!  We held an open house this past Saturday, and I thought it would be special to make a pitcher of homemade lemonade.  I squeezed fresh lemons (you'll need 7 very large lemons) instead of using bottled lemon juice.  It wasn't too sweet and wasn't too tart -- it was "just right"!  I placed a few thin lemon slices to float on the top for appearance sake, and it looked really pretty, too.

This is a great lemonade. It was a little too sweet so I had to add more lemon and water. On the whole, everyone at the party loved it. Thanks Jo.

I live in Beijing, China as an expat teacher, and it's nice to get a familiar taste - many Chinese believe lemonade is this thing called Sprite.  *sigh*

One change I made though is that I cut the sugar down as another user suggested to 1.5C and, to cut down on work and lemons, I quartered and peeled 4 medium lemons, tossed them in the blender with a cup of water; I wound up with two cups of "lemon juice" which were perfect when mixed with the rest of the ingredients.  I also added lemon zest from two of the lemons to the syrup for extra lemon flavour.  Absolutely incredible and refreshing!

This lemonade is amazing!! Did the recipe exactly as written and even my kids loved it! I even added some strawberries and let it sit overnight. Our strawberry lemonade was so good I drank almost all of it and my husband only had 1 small cup, I couldn't help myself :) we will definitely be making this again!

Crazy good, crazy simple. Not too tart and not too sweet. You can cut down on the wait time by chilling the pan of simple syrup in an ice bath.

Great Recipe! I played around with the quantities 2nd time I made it as I ended up with almost 2 cups of juice after the big squeeze. The second batch I also added 200ml passionfruit pulp and I cut back on the sugar to 1 1/4 cups as the passion fruit pulp was already sweetened. This is the best Lemonade recipe I have used and it is so refreshing.

Very, very good. It's tart and sweet and not the least bit watered down. I think it's miles better than anything you can buy in a store. It is a great recipe to add to as well.

I made it as written (other than halving the recipe) and it was absolutely wonderful - which is why I gave it 5 stars. Then, I took a hint from another recipe and added a few drops of vanilla, and it was also really good. This is excellent as-is, and it's also nice with a little vanilla - I ended up with two great recipes in one. I plan on drinking the whole 10 servings myself...

This was delicious! My only modification was that I only added 1 1/2 cups sugar, since I like my lemonade on the tart side. I have already made this twice, and will definitely be making it again!

I've been making this for over a year now at least.  It's my "go to" recipe and I have it memorized :)  We drink it everyday even in the winter now!  I don't add 8 cups of water...more like 6.5 to 7.  We like it on the tart side so when it's over ice and the ice melts, it's just perfect!! Oh ~ PS ~ I just use Splenda and it comes out wonderful too!  I think it's better the longer it sits.

I followed the reviewer by microwaving the sugar syrup in the microwave.  Then I added ice to water to make up the last 7 cups.  I ended up adding an extra half cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice to make it more lemony.  My daughter loved making this with me.

This is great but I made a few changes. I used 1 1/2 cups of fresh lemon juice and 1/2 cup of fresh orange juice.  I added a small amount of pink lemonade koolaid and doubled my water to make a gallon. Wow, was it a hit at my Christmas dinner tonight.

Delicious!  I used bottled juice (I know, I know...but it's what I had in the house) and it was still awesome!  I can't wait to try it with some crushed blueberries or with lime juice.

This was very sweet. Next time I will decrease the sugar, increase the fresh lemon and add fresh mint. * UPDATE * When we have a million lemons on our tree - we juice the lemons and freeze pre-measured portions for the lemonade in individual freezer Ziplock bags. When you want to make the lemonade, just thaw the frozen bag on the counter for awhile or in the fridge overnight. Nothing tastes as good as fresh squeezed, but this is still better than the store bought frozen (and cheaper).

Excellent lemonade! To save time, I just poured boiling water over the sugar and stirred it vigorously before adding lemon juice and cold water and ice. It turned out just lovely.

Made this last night for dinner guests and everybody loved it.  I used 8 lemons to come up with the 1 1/2 cups of juice, but I ended up adding a little more water than what was called for.  Was very refreshing and went perfect with our meal of BBQ chicken and twice baked potatoes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is great! Just enough sweetness and lemon. But I didn't make this for the drink. I made it and collected the lemon seeds and soaked them overnight. Then I planted them in a pot indoors with pebbles on top, and all of them came up, and now they're all 6 inches tall! Smart and easy way to grow lemon trees!

Entirely too sweet, but sooooo good!  I never thought of dissolving the sugar into a simple syrup prior to mixing with the lemon juice and remaining water, but it's a great idea!  I'll never make lemonade or limeade any other way.  Next time, I'll reduce the sugar to 1-1/2 or 1 -3/4 cups.

I make this ALL the time.  Its so easy to do and a huge crowd pleaser.  My family bought me the Cuisanart Pulp Control Citrus Juicer for my birthday! It was only $30 and it is absolutely amazing.  Tip: Make sure you bring your sugar water to a boil so that you see the bottom of the pan.  I used to not let it go all the way out of impatience but when I did, my critics all commented on how it tasted better than usual.  Sometimes if the lemons are small or old you may not get a full 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice.  I've supplemented a 1/4 cup with bottled and it turned out fine.

This recipe is awesome! I didn't boil the sugar & water, just heated it until sugar dissolved. Also, didn't refrigerate anything until I was done, just chilling the whole thing until later. Also yummy with a couple orange slices or whole fresh strawberries thrown in :)

I made both as shown just used 1 1/2 c sugar for our taste and for lower calorie or for diabetics I made with 1 cup splenda and 1/2 c regular sugar and was just as good.  Other people tried and didnt even know it was splenda!

I made it a 2nd time and it was much sweeter and I added a 2 C of lemon juice to give it more zing.  
Originally, I wrote...
"Not as sweet as I thougt it could be.  It seemed to be missing something.  I added strawberries for appearance and taste.  Maybe I need to add more lemon juice to make it more tart."
Now, I think it's just right.  The strawberries were the right sweetness when mixed together.

VERY good!  I do like my lemonade a little more tart, so I cut the sugar to 1-1/4 c and I thought it was perfect.  Liked another reviewer's suggestion to let lemons sit in hot water for 10 min. and then roll on counter before squeezing.  I also had a few berries at the bottom of the carton sitting in my fridge, so I added 4 strawberries and half a handful of blueberries in with the water and sugar while boiling (then removed berries before adding syrup).  PERFECT pink lemonade!  Flavor was great.

The best EVER!  I guess my taste buds have changed because now I crave lemonade.  This recipe is perfect and so easy!  It was little sweet - even for me, but I loved it - and I didn't change a thing.  Sliced up some of the skins and put those in the pitchter.  Try it this recipe - I don't think you'll be sorry.  (Used about 6 lemons)

Excellent!!! As with other reviews I cut down sugar to 1 1/2 C. I made simple syrup in microwave until boiling. I only had 3 lemons =2/3 C. of lemon juice. Put lemons in microwave each for 15 sec. then rolled on table to increase ease of juicing. Used Real Lemon juice to make up the 1 1/2 c. of lemon juice. Poured hot syrup over 2 C. ice. Added 5 C. cold water. So I got real pulp and lemon taste w/o squeezing all the lemons. 15 min. tops to make. Also try hot for sore throats, keeps scurvy away!! Happy summer!

DELICIOUS.
however it was only the perfect amount of sweetness when i reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups of sugar. 
MAKE SURE NOT TO SKIP MELTING THE SUGAR WITH THE WATER.
it took exactly 6 lemons to make 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice.

Excellent, easy recipe!  I used home-grown Meyer lemons, which are a little sweeter than other lemons, so I increased the amount of juice.  My family inhaled it!

This is one of the best recipes for lemonade I've ever had.  I usually add just a tad less sugar though.  It's great if you toss it in the blender with some peaches or strawberries for some extra flavor.

Delicious lemonade. Making simple syrup keeps the sugar dissolved. Use fresh lemons (not bottled) for the best taste.   I only use 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I like my lemonade to be extra tart!

A very reliable recipe. Followed exactly and pleased with the turn out. Everyone loved it and I ran out within 30 minutes of serving it. I used real/fresh lemons and that cut down on what some ppl might have been refering to as overly sweet.

The way lemonade should taste.  This recipe was perfect as is.  To make the lemons softer I sat in near boiling water (water form our instant hot water dispenser) and rolled before cutting in half and juicing.

This lemonade is AMAZING!  It was just how I like it. I did take the advice of other reviewers and use only 1 and 1/4 cup of sugar. I like my lemonade more tart then sweet! I used about 9 lemons to create the 1.5 cups of juice. It was a lot of squeezing... but WELL WORTH TI!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent!! I love sweet lemonade and this is perfect.  Add a little less sugar if you prefer a slightly tarter lemonade.  It tastes just like the famous "Hotdog on a stick" lemonade (which is my favorite lemonade ever!) The second time I made this I added about 1/2cup of freshly sliced strawberries to the pan when I was making the simple syrup...and wow!! I made the best strawberry lemonade ever!! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made this recipe for a tea party, it was really delicious as is, but to make it go a little further we added some diet 7-up to give it a little kick and served it in a punchbowl.Yum

Never made homemade lemonade before, since it is not a very well known thing over here. But made it for a BBQ and it was a big hit! Didn't change a thing.

This is the best lemonade. I cut the sugar in half and add a bit more lemon juice. I add a few frozen berries (strawberries, blackberries,raspberries...whatever I have) to the glass along with the ice.  Absolutely delicious.

This is great! After reading the reviews I wanted to make sure I didn't get it too sweet. I frequently find drinks like specialty coffees that are mixed by a barista to company specs too sweet. I made the sugar syrup as directed although you don't have to boil it, just heat it until the sugar dissolves. I made the syrup last night and chilled it overnight. It took 10 medium lemons to yield 1.5 cups of juice. I ended up using about 3/4 of the sugar syrup as  I mixed the juice and water, I added the syrup to taste. Using refrigerated lemons and water along with the refrigerated syrup lets you enjoy the lemonade immediately. This is somewhat labor intensive for the amount it makes - not really enough for a party because it's SOOO good. But I made it as a treat for our 4th of July picnic and it was a nice treat. I'll definitely make it again.

I followed this recipe but instead of squeezing all the lemons, I used a food prossesor and strained the lemons in a sifter. Better yet if you have a juicer.

I used just one cup of sugar and that was plenty.  Didnt let it cool, just mixed it all together and it was perfect!  Barely lasted one day so I mixed up another batch but this time I used limes, AWESOME limeade!

Eh. I found this recipe much too strong for me... not sweet enough, and instead of quenching my thirst, it made me very thirsty. I wound up adding an additional 2 cups of water and 1/4 cup of sugar. It was very sweet, but I was trying to duplicate a recipe from childhood, and with my alterations it was a pretty close match! I combined the sugar and lemon juice first, then 1 cup hot water and brought to a boil, as my old recipe had called for. The 2+ quarts I made disappeared very quickly, but without my alterations, it was hard for me to drink. This was a good starting point, though.

Delicious!  I never realized how wonderful real lemonade was.  I just finished making this with my little guy and we had a blast.  It was easy, fast (using the microwave shortcut) and absolutely delicious.  I did end up adding about two cups more of water, but that was just a personal preference for the tartness.  This is definitely going to be made often this summer.  Thanks for sharing!

I agree that this is an easy but great tasting recipe.  Just making simple syrup makes all the difference in the texture, and the taste of the Lemonade.  This simple little step, which I never thought of before, made all the difference to such a quick easy recipe. Creating simple syrup prevents small little pieces of unmixed sugar granular from taunting you at the bottom of the pitcher as you mix and mix until you end up with Mixers’ elbow.  The only change I made was to add a splash of fresh lime juice, and one to two  Caffeine Free Stash Peppermint Herbal Tea bags, depending if I doubled the mixture amount or not. I felt this added a nice crisp taste to my Lemonade. Hope others can enjoy this extra step as well.

I found the recipe as written to be sweeter than I like. I usually make the Vintage Lemonade recipe which is a bit tangier. I think next time I'll cut the sugar down to a cup, cup and a half.

My 6 year old son and I make this together. We substitute ice for the water, throw it in the blender, and make frozen lemonade.  My son wants me to add, "Don't crush the ice all the way or it won't taste as good."  We also do not wait the four hours for the syrup to cool.  No need.  It tastes great without the wait!

First time to make lemonade from scratch.  It takes some time, but it's worth the raves.  My son wanted to stop at "Chik fil A" for a $3 cup of lemonade... I said we could make some at home for less.  This stands up to the "Chik fil A" and we would agree... it's the "Best Lemonade Ever"!

Great recipe. I would also suggest that you take about a 1/4 to 1/2 C. of fresh raspberries and crush them through a sifter over the completed lemonade for an exquisite raspberry lemonade. Very refreshing and a great mixer with with many varieties of Vodka.

So tasty, refreshing and good for you. Well, minus the sugar! But way better for you then store bought. A great easy recipe for lemonade. I add mint leaves to the bottom of my pitcher and crush them. Then I add my lemon juice, lemon syrup & water.  Let it sit in the fridge for about a 1/2 hr and then serve. SO good. Add vodka for a grown-up lemonade with a kick!

When the simple syrup was finished, I put four thin slices of fresh ginger in as it was cooling.  This made a lovely ginger lemonade when mixed with the juice and water

I used 1 1/2 cups sugar, it was still nice and sweet for lemonade.  It took me 6 lemons to get enough juice (almost 1.5 cups anyway) when I did it by hand (no juicer).  I only let the syrup cool a few minutes before mixing everything together with ice, so no need to wait the 4 hours and fully chill everything!  My kids loved it!

Simple & Delicious!  I did have to slightly adjust the amounts since my largest pitcher wouldn't hold it all.  I had moderately juicy, medium-sized lemons and it took me 10 to get 1 1/2 cups of juice.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract which was a nice touch, but more would have been overpowering.  Great after it was chilled or mixed half-and-half with iced tea for an Arnold Palmer.  Thanks!

if you want to do something extra special, slice about 8 to 10 dime size pieces of fresh ginger and add to the boiling process. remove after 15 minutes.

This was very refreshing, though I found that it was a bit too sweet.  It was perfect when I made it with 1 1/4 cups of sugar.   I used a tip I saw on TV once to make squeezing the lemons easier - after cutting them in half, pop them into the microwave for about 45 seconds.  The juice will run right out of them with minimal effort!  I also boiled fresh ginger slices in my sugar syrup and strained them out afterward.  The gingery kick they added was delicious.

I really don't understand why some reviews said that the sugar wasn't enough. It was too much if you ask me. I measured it in my head, and decided to go with 1 cup of sugar for 1 cup of water (for the boiling part). 1 3/4 cups of sugar is too sweet. At first, I thought it would be less for 7 cups of water, but it was perfect! It was actually sweeter than I thought! I drink my lemonade a little bit less sweeter, but the sugar was perfect (reduced from 1 3/4 to 1 cup). I also didn't use lemon juice straight from lemons. First, I didn't have any. Second, it would be more time consuming if I tried to juice 1 1/2 cups worth of lemons! I used organic lemon juice, straight from the bottle, and it tasted just as great! Overall this lemonade was wonderful. Next time, for my own preference, and since I like my lemonade to be "diet", I will add 1/2 cup of sugar. And I'm pretty sure it will still be sweet.

These are basically the same proportions (water, lemon juice, sugar) we've always used to make lemonade since I was a little girl, though I think I may use slightly less juice and closer to 1 cup of sugar (1-3/4 c. sugar seems a lot for a 2 qt recipe).  I have never boiled anything at all.  I just dump the sugar in my pitcher, run enough hot water over it to cover, then stir til dissolved.  That hangs out and cools to room temp while I juice the lemons (about 6 for a 2-qt. pitcher, depending on size).  Then I add the juice to the pitcher and fill to within about an inch of the top with cold water and toss in a few of the squeezed-out lemon halves.  It's delicious right away, but of course it's much more flavorful once it's had a chance to sit the fridge for a few hours.  In my humble opinion, the boiling is unnecessary.  I tried it to see if it made any difference, but I couldn't tell that it did.  To each his own, though -- either way, there's nothing more refreshing and delicious than homemade lemonade on a hot summer's day! :)  Oh, almost forgot to mention -- I am diabetic and normally make my lemonade with Splenda, and you can't tell one bit of difference.  I'm picky about that since sweet iced tea and lemonade are two things I'd rather not have at all than to have with some off flavor.  So don't be afraid to try Splenda!

After reading a lot of reviews and some people complaining it was too sweet and others complaining it was too tart, I decided to try the recipe exactly as written.  We prefer our lemonade tart and like many others, found it to be way too sweet.  I ended up adding 2 more cups of water and another 1/2 cup of lemon juice (I used bottled since I didn't have any fresh lemons and want to try it with fresh, which I think will be even better) and came up with what we thought was a pretty good batch of lemonade.  Tart like we like it, with just the right amount of sweetness.  I really liked the idea of cooking the sugar and water first.  Although a bit more time consuming, you are assured that the sugar is well blended instead of sitting on the bottom.  Good recipe!

The best lemonade I have ever tried.  I used a little less sugar than called for and strawberries too.  When I was boiling the sugar water I grabbed 6-7 strawberries and mashed them up before dropping them in the sugar water.  Let it froth up a bit before chilling.  Adds a great strawberry flavor to it and could work with any other berry too.

Tastes great!  I found that it is much easier to boil equal parts sugar and equal parts water (1 3/4c each) to make a simple syrup, then add the cooled syrup to the lemon juice and remaining water (6 1/4c).   This cuts down on the time to bring it to a boil and on the cooling time!

Couldn't be better.  I used Splenda instead of sugar for one cup, and a half a cup of regular sugar to cut calories.  It is delicious.  This is what I'll be doing with 85% of my lemons from now on.

I have a sweet tooth, but this was a little more sugar than I would prefer in a drink. It was very good. It would probably mix well with an adult beverage. I made this just for myself and it only lasted me 3- days or so. I also have a juicer, so it did not take me long at all to make. I think I may take a suggestion and try strawberries in it next time. YUM!!

We had a bunch of lemons from a friends tree. We cut the rinds off and threw the whole lemon in the blender. Sweetened with splenda, scaled down the water, added crushed ice and blended it all up. It made the most delicous frozen lemonade.

My daughter (Shes 3) just finished her third glass, (she  swiped it from me when i was not looking, and is asking for more.  I only had about 1 cup of lemon juice, so i left out about 1/2 cup of watem but it is still a bit watered down for me, I also like lemonade to be  a bit sour, and this is a bit too sweet for me.  Will make again with 7 lemons instead of 6, and a little less surgar

This lemonade is really good and easy to make.  It just takes a little longer than I would like because you need to chill the sugar and water mixture.  I put mine in the freezer for about 30 minutes.  Also, I thought that it was too sweet.  Next time I will cut the amoun of sugar that I put in.  I'm looking forward to trying it again and adding strawberries and raspberries.

We make this all the time. It only takes minutes. We boil the sugar and water in the microwave, then add ice to cool down. I use an organic, not from concentrate lemon juice that works just as well as fresh lemons in my opinion.

Very good.  On the sweeter side which I liked more than some sour lemonades. ~ETA:   I've made it a number of times now and we always love it.  It's my go to lemonade recipe.  I've even played with it some by adding other flavors like mashed cranberries for holidays drinks or mint leaves.  It's always a hit.  If you want to add extras just add until you think it tastes good.

This is a great recipe!!! The taste is perfect for little kids, not too sweet, not to tart... I made this with my preschool class when we talked about yellow and they loved squeezing the lemons. ( I did cheat  since I had to double the recipe to make enough for all of the kids I added lemon juice concentrate as well as fresh lemons)

I juiced 3 lemons, and only came out with 2/3 C.  You probably need at least 6 lemons for 1 1/2 C.  It was delicious, and we wanted more, but drank it all!

Best lemonade recipe!

I've found that you can get the 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice from about 6-7 lemons if you heat the lemons up first. I also add some ice to keep it cool.

Great recipe!

Very good....a little too sugary for our taste but have cut it down a bit (or diluted) and it's great.  Particularly great for making Arnold Palmers!

Lucky enough to have an old neighbor who always gifted me lemons and now that I moved he sent a batch via mail! Love him...however I had a bunch of very ripe lemons ready to go...so lemonade it was. 

This recipe was the perfect match for the taste buds of this house, so thank you!

I like the addition of other fruits that other members have tried, I'll give that a whirl in the future.

Just okay for me. Made it for a Bridal Shower and didn't like it much so I ended up tweaking it a LOT. Added POM, Orange juice, ginger ale, and a little vodka.

This was very good with a one addition, I added 4 more cups of water because it was so sweet. It never affected the tartness and it even made around a gallon. So simple to make and you know what is in it. Good!

I LOVE this recipe! It does not take as long as it says and it's not that labor intensive. 

Instead of 1 3/4 cup of sugar, I use 1 1/2 cups. I like mine a little more tart. It takes about 2 minutes for the water to boil with the sugar in it. Once it boils, I pour it into the pitcher with the lemon juice (I own a citrus juicer) and the remaining water. I then add ice cubes (to cool it faster) and a few lemon slices for effect. 

I pop it in the fridge and we're ready to go. Sometimes we can't wait for a glass so if you pour it into a cup with ice, it'll cool down in no time. I just made a batch and I can't wait to enjoy it with dinner later!

Wonderful!!!! We love this lemonade!  I did add 1/8 tea of salt (read that in another recipe to cut bitterness), other than the salt I followed the recipe exactly.  You won't be disappointed!

This is really good lemonade, but really sweet. I went down to 1.5 cups of sugar and I'll probably use 1.25 next time. I chose this recipe because it calls for lemon juice instead of just lemons. In my experience, not all lemons have the same amount of juice which can throw off the sweet/tart balance. However, I love the simplicity of lemonade and this recipe make a great glass of lemonade :)

Ok,so it took about 13 small lemons.I did what one reviewer said and let lemons soak in warm water than my husband also suggested rolling lemons on the counter than cuting, then juicing.Wow did it work!!My family loved this recipe it was very good we added a little more juice for our taste. I love the idea of the syrup that makes the drink very smooth so don't leave that IMPORTANT detail out and use fresh lemons! Also used cheese cloth for the seeds.This is definately a keeper! Thanks for sharing and God bless.

When I read this recipe I was like okay so how is this any different than any other lemonade?  The boiling the water and sugar together is what makes it different and absolutely delicious.  I pretty much drank the whole thing myself. :)

Awesome has been used so many times on the review of this recipe but there's no other way to describe it! It doesn't get any easier...then when I cheat and substitute the bottled lemon juice that I had bought in bulk and needed a way to use it up before it went bad. Found this recipe and have make it at least once a week. The kids will either mix it half and half with the iced tea I make (tastes similar to the Arnold Palmer half and half) or like other reviewers have done and used it to blend with some frozen strawberries or blueberries. Whatever we have on hand seems to work! Thanks for sharing Jo!

This was amazing, and the best part is is that it doesn't involve so many lemons to use! I used about 4 large lemons, though I ran out of sugar, but it was fabulous, my husband and I loved it, and almost everyone loved it, but my father-in-law thought it wasn't enough lemons or sugar. But this did not take me four hours, I let my husband roll out the lemons on the table until they became soft making the juices come out much easier. It took him about 5 minutes to squeeze all four. But all in all, this is a keeper, I will be making this again!

Very good recipe for lemonade. Best thing is to keep things basic. I need about 6 medium sized lemons for this. And it is much better to make the simple syrup instead of just adding the sugar. Although, I keep my syrup balanced, equal parts sugar and water (in other words, I cut the sugar back to one cup; It's really all you need).

Followed the directions exactly and loved the results! Tart and sweet (not too sweet for our tastes). I dropped a few of the lemon halves into the water I heated up for the sugar just to infuse a little extra lemon flavor. We loved this!

This is a great standard. I just poured the juice and the simple syrup over a whole lotta ice and topped it off with cold water to equal about three quarts. My husband said, "Well, there's our summer drink."

LATER: Also works with my iced tea maker, where I put the juice and sugar in the pitcher and water up to the 2 quarts line in the machine. When it's done, I stir to dissolve and add ice. Made with Demerara or Turbinado sugar, it's "Mom's Dirty Lemonade" and we love it!

The trick to the perfect lemonade is to keep the sugar water (simple syrup) and the lemon juice seperate until you are ready to drink it. My family has a pitcher of lemon juice and a pitcher of sweetend water at the "bar". We bring our glass of ice and add as much lemon/water as we like. The lemonade is always the perfect flavor for the person drinking it.

This really is the best lemonade ever!  My husband loves it and he considers himself to be somewhat of an expert.  I didn't go through the long process, however.  I stirred it all together while still warm, then chilled, and I used lemon juice concentrate.  I'm sure fresh lemons would be even better, but I don't have the time or patience.

First time i ever made homemade lemonade and it was absolutely awesome. I Just mixed the water with splenda and added the lemon juice. Just perfect. Very strong, just the way i like it. You can just add some extra water for those who like it a bit less sweet/tart.

I made this with Splenda instead of sugar.  No one could tell this difference.  It was very delicious.

I searched for this recipe, because if it wasn't here, I was going to submit it.  This is the only "Real" lemonade.  Simply adding sugar to lemon juice tastes like sugar - simple syrup does not.  One change I make - don't add the water, leave it concentrated.  Then pour a bottomful in a glass and use sparkling water - WAY better...

Everyone at my party loved it!  I made the "concentrate" ahead of time (the 1 c. water and sugar mixture combined with the lemon juice) and put it in the freezer.  The day before I needed it I took it out of the freezer and put it in the refrig.  The day of the party, all I had to do was mix the concentrate with the remaining 7 c. of water.

My son said that this is 10 stars! LOL. I cut the sugar down and it was still pretty darn sweet. Will make again as soon as I buy more lemons. I got a Krups juicer and this recipe is a breeze!  ***Update*** Just wanted to let you all know that I have been making this for my brother and nephew that both have juvenile diabetes and I use the baking Splenda instead of the sugar and it does beautifully. I use the equivalent of 1 cup of sugar. Thanks :)

I loved this recipe!  Instead of putting the mix of sugar and water in the fridge, I put ice cubes in the pan so it would cool down faster.  My mom and dad tried it and loved it, so did my friends!

I love this lemonade and wanted to enjoy it even when there is not a group to drink 8 cups lemonade.....

So I double or triple the amount and make a large batch of sugar-water syrup and store it in glass Quart jars in the refrig.

Then, no matter the number of servings I wish to make, I use equal parts syrup and lemon juice and add 2.3 parts water to it.  Yum

E.g., 1 C syrup + 1 C Lemon Juice + 2&1/3 C Water = 3&1/3 C Delicious Lemonade!

Just helped my 7 year old make this this morning for a family get together.  He put a sign out that said Free Lemonade Samples with small cups.  Everyone liked it so much that he made almost $8.  He never even asked for money, they liked it so well they got out money and were paying him. And it sure made him feel good! ;)
Easy trick, to cool the simple syrup, we put the bowl of syrup in a bigger bowl of ice water.  It was nice an cold in no time at all, like 10-15 minutes!

The title says it all.  It is definitely the best lemonade I have ever had.  I used 2# of lemons and got enough fresh lemon juice and once I added it to the simple sugar syrup & water it was done.  I filled a glass with ice, poured some lemonade in and had to admit it is the best lemonade that I've ever had.

Totally enjoyed this!  I microwaved the sugar water for about 3 minutes until it was cooked down.  Then, I added 1.5 cup bottled lemon juice.  I can't imagine taking the time to hand squeeze!  This way was much quicker, and the result was a great balance of sweet and tart.  I will definitely make this again... and again!

Reminds me of the lemonade that my southern granny  used to make!  I used 5 rather large lemons and got 1 1/2c. lemon juice- it was the perfect amount for the simple syrup and water ratio.  Fantastic!

Yes it really is The Best Lemonade Ever! I will use this recipe every time I make lemonade. To speed the process up, I did as some of the others said and added some ice to the sugar water.

Warm up your lemons in the microwave for easier squeezing.

This recipe is really good!  The only change I made was that I zested the lemon peel into the syrup mixture and let it infuse and then strained it before going into the fridge to cool.

This is the only way I make lemonade and it is so good!  I agree with others the trick to get the juice out of the lemons is to microwave them for a bit or soak them in hot water or roll them for awhile to get them soft.  I also used artificial sweetener instead of sugar. This is good refreshing lemonade if you just put it on ice.

Just got a new juicier. Made this for my first homemade concoction. And it was easy and delicious. Although I cheated and added the syrup mixture when it was Luke warm. Came out just fine.

Better than what you get at an amusement park!  Only wish I had a juicer.  Next time I may split the juice 1/2 fresh squeezed and 1/2 bottled to save some time.  Added some of the lemons halves to the lemonade afterwards to get some additional flavor.

My 4 yr old Meyer Lemon tree has finally produced a good bunch of lemons here in Florida.  It's December, but my husband still asked for lemonade, so I tried this.  I used Splenda instead of sugar to save the calories and it is wonderful!  The Splenda doesn't have to be heated to melt it either, so there was no need to cool it down before adding the lemon juice and water.  A really simple way to make it...saved time and tastes great!

I had only bought 6 small to medium-sized lemons, which gave me only 1 cup of juice, so I ended up using a bit less water/sugar when I made mine. But I had also purposefully started out with a bit less sugar since my husband doesn't like it too sweet. (Besides, it's easy to add more of the concentrated dissolved sugar/water mixture if needed). This is incredibly refreshing and much, MUCH better than the store-bought stuff!

I avoid lemon at all costs (more of a lime person), so lemonade is usually too bitter for me. BUT this recipe was absolutely fantastic. It uses simple syrup, which I love from making Mojitos, and it's so easy to make and does not take long at all. Next time I'll use a natural sugar (Xylitol) to cut back on the "man-made sweet factor". LOVE IT! Thank you!

This is great!  

I don't like my lemonade too sweet.  I have a 2 gallon glass dispenser, so doubled the recipe then I added another 6 cups of water and some ice and it was perfect for my tastes.  I also sliced up three more lemons and dropped in the glass dispenser and it looks beautiful.

I really enjoyed this lemonade recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly as written but I only had 4 lemons which only produced about a half of a cup of lemon juice so I had to substitute with Real Lemon.  It was still very delicious and I will make it again and again.

This is a great recipe. I read a review that said it was labour intensive. A few suggestions : 1) boil the water and dissolve the sugar to make that step easier and 2) pop the lemons into the microwave for 20 seconds before squeezing, it will squeeze out more juice in half the time!

I added large pieces of the zest of one lemon to the saucepan and removed it after it cooled. Added so much more lemon flavor.

This really is delicious.  I made a double batch and refrigerated the base the night before, then added the ice and water in a pretty dispenser right before the party.  It was a big hit, and it was all gone in about 30 minutes! I wish there was a way around all the sugar, but it was great.

I JUST made this, and it really IS the best lemonade ever! The perfect blend of sweet and tart. I microwaved my sugar & water mixture, to save time. I also pricked my lemons with a fork and gave them a minute in the micro as well, to release all the wonderful juices. I was short on lemons, so I used a few squirts of bottled juice. I went easy on the water, subbing in quite a bit of ice...it was ready to drink much quicker that way. This was a HUGE hit with my family. Forget the HFCS~filled stuff in the can...make your own, and be sure use this recipe!!! Top notch!!!

Verygood lemonade!  I made this with my 3 yr. old last weekend and he had lots of fun sqeezing all the lemons.  I didn't read the directions throughly and did not heat the sugar water mixture.  I just mixed it all together and it turned out just fine!  Love it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yep.  Terrific.  I used 10 limes and cherry juice from marischino cherries.  I used splenda to sweeten to make it low carb.  It was DELICIOUS and a terrific summer treat!

Delicious. And my 5 year old daughter enjoyed squeezing the lemons. I also added less water & used ice at the end to cool it down faster.

We have tried this recipe 3 times and it has had a funny taste each time. I think it might be boiling the sugar and water that gives it a funny taste  - we won't be making it again.

Great Recipe. I like the idea of a simple syrup, and usually do it this way but in a pinch, like when my impatient kids want lemonade NOW I just mix it all up in a pitcher and skip the simple syrup step.  FYI, In a major pinch I have used bottled lemon juice and it's definitely not as good, but it's worked (use slightly less than called for and adjust to your taste).

I've made this several times. It's perfect just as written, but very forgiving. I was short on lemons, so I squeezed a few limes to make up the difference - delicious! Also, you can cheat a little if you don't want to take the time to make the simple syrup. Just start by putting the sugar in the bottom of the pitcher, then add one cup of very hot water (I nuke it) and stir to dissolve the sugar. If it doesn't completely dissolve, it will when the other 7 cups of water and the juice are added. You can add a little crushed ice into the water to chill it faster, too. A real crowd-pleaser, especially made with fresh lemons!

Absolutely fantastic! Everywhere I go, I'm asked to copy the recipe down for others to have! It's grown to be such a common drink that I have detered from juicing my own lemons and now just pour out the bottled stuff. I refuse to use any other recipe for lemonade! With some experimentations done, the best advice I can give is: Do NOT deviate from the recipe - original is truly the greatest, and dissolving the sugar over the stove is the secret, not the proportions of sugar to water to lemon juice! Cheers!

This was easy and so freakin' delicious! It makes a lot of lemonade too. I used the "Real Lemon" Lemon Juice because I didn't have any lemons. But honestly I'll be making it again the same way. Maybe going as far as buying better, pulpier 100% pure lemon juice. It's just so easy! When I tasted it I found it a bit too sweet. I simply added more ice and it tasted perfect. I like a icy-cold lemonade so making it extra sweet is best anyhow so you don't have a bland water-down drink.

Very refreshing! It took 7 lemons to make 1 1/2 cups of fresh lemon juice. I used my electric juicer so everything came together very easy. Just the right amount of tart to sweet - I will be making more of this very soon!

Wow!  I'd never had homemade lemonade and made this recipe on a lark - this is so good, I can't stop drinking it!  Used 1 and a quarter cups sugar and it is juuuust right for us.  I was too antsy to wait for the simple syrup to cool - just added the whole shebang and added some ice cubes to our glasses.  We squeezed the lemons by hand because we have no juicer and it wasn't very hard or time consuming.  Thanks a million!

I just taught Vacation Bible School and we taught 85 children how to make this lemonade to raise money for Alex's Lemonade Stand (Children Cancer Research).  I made the syrup in advance, 1 1/4 cup of sugar to 1 cup of water.  The children had a blast squeezing the lemons with an old fashioned Rival lemon squeezer.  They added their squeezed juice to the pitcher of 7 cups of water and 1 1/4 of syrup.  We raised over $225.00 at .50 a glass.  Thank you for a fabulous recipe that adults and children, alike, will drink!

This really is worth the extra work to make the syrup base. I also used only 1 1/4 C sugar and it created what was in my mind the perfect balance of sweet and tart with beginning and aftertastes. The tip to soak the lemons in warm water and roll them firmly before slicing and juicing does a great job maximizing the juice you can get from one lemon. This will be a big hit this summer!

This is delicious, but I didn't want to wait. I used just 1/3 cup of boiling water from the kettle, with 150g sugar in the pot so it only took a couple of minutes to dissolve.  Then I used a litre of cold water from the fridge with 200ml lemon juice, poured the hot syrup in slowly, and drank it straight away.

Very good!  It took me 6 medium sized lemons to get the required juice when I halved the recipe (so 12 if you make the full amount).  I even microwaved them for 30 seconds and rolled them around.  Oh well...still worth it!
I added some pureed strawberries that I made by adding berries to a little of the lemonade in the blender and blending until smooth.  Then I poured it all into the pitcher for pink strawberry lemonade.

Thanks!

I made this using 1 1/2 cups of sugar but it was still way too sweet for us. Next time I will take the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups. Otherwise a pretty tasty recipe and not at all time-consuming. Great to now have a way to use up all the lemons from dad's trees!

I love this lemonade recipe.  I do cut the sugar down to 1 cup, however, because it's a bit sweet otherwise.  I have also substituted limes, as well as using club soda to make sparkling lemonade or limeade.  It's been a hit all summer.
Addendum - I had a half pint of strawberries that needed to be used so I blended them with ice and a bit of water until they were smooth and added them to the lemonade - best strawberry lemonade I've ever had!

Excellent!  I made no modifications to the recipe.  Everyone gulped it down fast and loved it!  Perfect pucker and sweetness combo IMHO.

I grew up on Wylers lemonade drink but my husband said he really liked "real" lemonade.  Gave this recipe a try and everyone loves it.  We like a tart lemonade so I only used 1 cup sugar. I love that the simple syrup eliminates the grainy sugar on the bottom of the pitcher syndrome.  Will make often

I loved this recipe. It was easy, quick and tasted amazing. Works well with lemons, limes or a mixture of both. The only change I made was using fizzy water instead of still. Served it at a BBQ, and 4 peopleaske dfor the recipe!

This did take more work than the powderered (DUH) but it was WELL worth it. A friend said it was just like her mom used to make.  I thought this was very good.  And I used the reduced portion of sugar as well and it turned out great.

Ok so initially I thought this was to sweet. I've made it again and love the idea of making the sugar syrup since it is so hard to get sugar to dissolve in cold water. I have many lemons and I will always use this recipe.

This was a wonderful recipe!  Based on the other reviewers, I reduced the sugar just by a bit though (to 1.5 cups) but everything else remained the same.  It was delicious and kept well in the fridge (both as syrup and fully mixed) for the several days it took me to finish it :)

Very refreshing!  I used a bit less sugar to make the simple syrup.  The syrup can be stored in the refrigerator so a batch of lemonade can be whipped up in minutes.

This was delicious! A little too sweet for my taste, but if you add several ice cubes to it after mixing everything, it dilutes it to perfection!

Oh so good and refreshing! I just got married a few weeks ago and this was served at our high tea between the ceremony and reception. It was a hot day and everyone RAVED about it, it tastes wonderfully homemade. Few changes, we added a splash of cranberry juice (makes it pink) and a few sprigs of bruised mint to make it extra refreshing. delightful recipe!

The first time I made this I used bottled lemon juice. It was nasty. I made it again using fresh squeeze lemons and mmmm, good! For the 1 1/2 cups juiced, I used 4 LARGE lemons. I didn't make the simple syrup, I just threw it all together and it was great. I even turned it into a slush in my electric ice cream maker and it was awesome. Thanks!

This was excellent, I followed the recipe exactly and loved it, made it a second time and this time I added 1 cup of cut up strawberries to the boiling syrup, reserved some strawberries to put in the lemonade and added a bit more water, it's still great! I love the recipe as it is, and i love it with the strawberries. by far the best lemonade I have ever made. thanks again!!!!

This was definetely the best lemonade we have ever had. The kids helped me squeeze the lemons (we used 7 large lemons).we don't like pulp so I strained the lemon juice of pulp and seeds but we just couldn't wait for the whole thing to chill so once the sugar mixture cooled down a bit we used a mixture of 1/2 ice cubes and 1/2 water to make up the remaining 7 cups of water and the kids taste tested immediately--and WOW it was a hit! Thanks!!

There is always going to be some people who find it too sweet, some that will find it too tart, but this is a good basic recipe. Too sweet? Cut the sugar and add lemon. Too tart? Add more sugar. Just play with it until it suits you, but like I said, it is a good basic recipe. I like it the way it is. I garnish with slices of lemon in the pitcher.

Loved this. I cut sugar down to 1 1/4 c. heated with cup of water in microwave, then added a cup of ice. Immediately added to lemon juice plus 6 more cups of water and it was perfect to drink over ice right away.

Great recipe! I didn't have enough lemons so I substituted with limes and oranges until it came to 1 1/2 cups.  I kept the lemons/limes/oranges and muddled them with the sugar then added the boiling water to the mixture.  Very tasty and refreshing! I will definitely keep this in the recipe box! Thanks for the recipe!

The name says it all.  We are addicted to it and can't get enough and family and friends love it too.  I also throw in a large pinch of salt to stop any bitterness.  I like it best made from 2 fresh lemons and the balance in bottled 'Real Lemon' juice.  If I just use all lemons, the 'bite' of tart and sweet just isn't there.  Using the 2 real lemons also allows for some pulp. Making the 'simple syrup' and letting it chill before mixing makes a big difference in the taste.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I am so glad this recipe came up.  I used to make this lemonade 30 years ago and kinda lost the recipe and forgot all about it.

It is the very best lemonade!  Thanks Allrecipes for posting this one.

Would have given 4.5 if allowed. Try Meyer lemons and less sugar if you can find them. Less sour, more fruity and complex.

OMG!  My husband and I just made a batch of limoncello and wanted to use the leftover lemons to make lemonade.  We'd never found a recipe we liked, however, until this one.  Wow!  Like another reviewer, I microwaved a cup of water for a minute, added 1-3/4 cups of Splenda instead of sugar, then 1-1/2 cups ice cubes to cool down the simple syrup quickly.  Added the lemon juice and the rest of the water and couldn't believe how good it tasted!  Thank you, Jo, for posting this one!

This is a great starting point.  I've been juicing whole lemons, using more lemon juice and less sugar each time.  I store the concentrate in the fridge (the lemon juice and simple sugar), then add water to taste.  I prefer more water, my husband prefers less.  For company, we use the receipe as directed.

Very good and refreshing. I only had 6 large lemons that made 1 cup of juice so I used all but about a quarter of the simple syrup. It's more sweet than tart but was just the right balance for us.

I made this much quicker than the recipe says. I bought a 2# bag of lemons, which turned out to be perfect. I soaked them in hot water then rolled them on the counter before juicing them. Then I filled the pitcher with 7 cups of cold water and added the hot syrup to it, then the lemon juice. Much better than waiting for my fridge to work on it. Took about 30 minutes, super cheap, and worth every ounce of effort.

Good flavor for basic lemonade, but when I added about a cup of pureed fresh strawberries it was amazing!

I made this with my preschool class.  Here's what we did: each child rolled a lemon to get the juices flowing.  Then we cut them in half and took turns squeezing the lemons (12 lemons made the perfect amount for us).  We strained the juice to make sure no seeds or pulp got in.  Instead of boiling, we simply mixed the ingredients together.  Best lemonade I've ever had and so simple (if you've got 12 kids doing the hard part of squeezing 12 lemons lol)

This recipe was okay but I think it was way to sour and tart. My suggestion is if you want to make it then put in less lemons; and I dont think that it was that refreashing. NOT the best lemonade ever!!

This is really the best lemonade ever....I can't wait to make it for the bbq and with strawberries. It didn't take 4hr and 35 mins, only about 2hr because it does take some time to juice about 9 lemons but really worth it. I didn't feel like waiting for the syrup to get really cold but i didn't need to. Thx for this recipe.

Delicious lemonade! Exactly what I've been looking for, for years.
I only used 1 1/2 cups white sugar, and it was enough for me, even though I like my lemonade on the sweet side ;o)

Wonderful, very refreshing lemonade! Not too sweet and not too sour. I didn't wait to chill the simple syrup (impatient, I know) but it worked out just fine.

Can't wait to try putting some sliced strawberries in it!

My husband and my 2-year old liked the recipe as written, but my 4-year old did not. He said that it tasted like regular lemonade went bad...maybe he will like it better if I add more water and/or sugar. I will see if I can adjust the proportions to my son's liking.

5 lemons make about 1.5 cups of juice with pulps. I think 6 lemons might have better balance between sourness and sweetness.

Update: For the amount of sugar used in lemonade, I'm going to replace it with stevia. Kind of worry about stevia's bitter aftertaste. I read that lemon-flavored stevia drop by Sweet Leaf works well.

Fabulous!  I used an approximate ratio of 2 lemons:1 lime and thought the flavor was just perfect.  Next time, I will freeze some cherry juice to use as ice cubes.

Great!  I shared this recipe with my sister in Kentucky and my mother in Mississippi they were also happy with the taste.  When I make it for my family it is gone within 24 hours.

This is just the best recipe.  So refreshing in the summer.  Beats soda and other soft drinks.  All natural. When I was sick with a cold my mother would always make me a warm homemade lemonaide and I could never figure out how she made it.  Now I know....make the syrup first.

After so many glowing reviews, I simply had to try this one.  It didn't disappoint.  While I really don't relish squeezing so many lemons (I'd just as soon use bottled lemon juice), it was worth the effort.  It took me nine lemons to make enough juice.  I had to tell my son who is a lemonade fanatic that I had just the recipe for him.  Try this, you'll like it!

I didn't heat the sugar water mixture because I didn't read the recipe.  It turned out fine.  I didn't have lemons on hand so I just used the store bought lemon juice.  Still yummy and much easier!

I love this site!! Every recipe I've gotten from here I love, I doubled the recipe and by accident I used 3 cups of sugar instead of 3 1/2 I put 2 cups regular sugar and 1 cup worth of the regular sugar in splenda since my mom is diabetic. I thought it was the perfect amount of sugar, any more and it would of been to sweet I think. Thanks for sharing this recipe it's delicious!

this is a great basic lemonade recipe--classic! but if you really want to make it special add a tablespoon of vanilla extract to the gallon of finished lemonade! It makes it taste like you are drinking a slice of lemon meringue pie! SOOOOO YUMMY!

I love this lemonade!!!  I always have a pitcher in my fridge now.   It takes me less than ten minutes to make (including time to run water through a coffee maker) by using lemon juice concentrate.  I use sugar blend so there is less to dissolve (means less hot water needed)  I never have sugar on the bottom anymore!!  My family loves it too!

This is excellent lemonade.  I use an electric juicer for the lemons and it takes no time at all to make.  I've added mint to this and it is so refreshing on a hot summer day.  I'm going to try adding strawberries next time as my family really likes flavored lemonade.

Best recipe ever!  We make this continuously and actually find that 1-1/2 cups of sugar is plenty.     For raspberry lemonade, follow step one using only 1 cup sugar.  Mash 2 cups raspberries (fresh or frozen) with the remaining sugar.  Strain and add to step 2.  Delicious!

The best is right!  Just made it for my family and it's awesome.  For a twist I changed it up a bit.  Instead of a whole cup of water during the simple syrup process I used 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup pureed fresh strawberries.  Boiled it as directed and then put it through a strainer to catch the seeds and mush.  It came out wonderful.  Next time I will make the recipe exactly as directed but this time we were trying to get rid of 15 lbs. of strawberries that we picked from a local farm.

I used 1 1/4 cups sugar and 6 lemons (which was about 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice) and it was just right - not too tart, not too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!

My father never likes the lemonade that I make. He always says something negative about it. When I made this lemonade I really liked it and so did my brothers and my mom. I had found out that my dad loved it too when he took one big cup and a small cup of it in to his room. I was very happy about it and I made some more today. It is a great recipe and I think that all will enjoy it. For me it was a bit too sweet so, I put a bit less sugar in it and it was a lot better. I had put only 6 cups of water in and that amount was just perfect. Right away I poured the hot syrup into the pitcher but, I had to add a lot of ice to it on a hot day like today. I hope you enjoy!! ;)

This lemonade reminded me of the ones at the county fair.  It was a little sweet for my taste with all of the syrup.  My husband loved it though.  On a really hot day working in the yard it would be great though!  But, if I made lemonade all the time I would probably do a less sweet version with a more lemony taste.  Either way I doubt there would be anyone that wouldn't love this drink.

So great! My in-laws just moved into a house with a lemon tree so I had to make lemonade as soon as I could. This recipe is the first and last I'll ever use!

Delicious and refreshing! Made up the concentrate before going on holiday, and just added to unsweetened soda water when we wanted a drink.

I made this a couple of times... First, I did everything double proportioned and it was terrific! Second, I took out some lemons (it took 9 the first time) and swapped them for a package of strawberries and that batch was even better! But all in all, I'd say this is the perfect syrup/lemon ratio.

This lemonade is awesome - I have served it at several parties and cookouts and never have a drop left over. I would recommend adding 2/3 of the sugar and then adding the rest to taste for those who prefer their lemonade on the tart side as I do.

Was never a big fan of Lemonade until I found this recipe. Now it's a staple in the 'fridge. The first time I made it, it was a bit to sweet for my taste, so the second cut back on the sugar a bit, you can always add more you want it sweeter. Only change I make is once the sugar has dissolved and cooled just a little, I pour it over 2 cups of ice (as Alton Brown always says "a pints a pound the world around")then mix the rest together and float a few lemon slices. Let chill a bit and enjoy.

I made it using "ReaLemon" b/c I didn't have any lemons on hand and my son desperately wanted lemonade.  We all agreed it was great.  Not too tart or too sweet (although our tastes to verge on the sweet, so take that with a grain of salt).

I'm not a huge lemonade drinker, but I enjoyed this treat. It was, however, pretty labor intensive for the relatively small amount of lemonade it produced, but that is to be expected with fresh-squeezed juice. The rest of my family loves lemonade, and they drank this right up! I recommend keeping the pulp if you can; it really adds to it. I substituted Splenda for about half of the amount of sugar the recipe called for, but next time I would just deal with the extra calories and use sugar.

Really, really tasty. Real lemons taste better than bottled, but it still works fine. I cut my sugar by 1/2 c. because I like it tart. Went through 4 jugs this weekend!

Great, simple recipe.  I made it for a bbq I hosted last week and it was a hit!!  I only wish that I made twice as much.  I suggest using 1.5 cups of sugar--you can always add more to taste.

This recipe was so easy and quick. I have never tried to make lemonade before. During our heat wave this is a perfect beverage. Served it to my neighbor who raved over it. This will be in my refidgerator all summer! Excellent starter for cocktails too!!

Mmmmm.... perfect! I've never made lemonade before and the whole family loved this! I made the sugar mix with 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda with 1 cup water. Plenty sweet. could even cut the sugar back a bit more and it would be fine. Definitely worth the extra time and effort. I followed another reviewers advice and let the lemons sit in hot water for 10 minutes, rolled them on the counter, then squeezed them. Even the kids helped. Thank you!

My husband drinks it all up as soon as I mix it! Just for a lazy time, I mixed the melted sugar/water w/lemon juice without any waiting time. Thanks so much. UPDATE:This recipe calls for only 4 oz servings. I upped the amount and use about half squeezed lemon juice with pulp and half condensed juice in a bottle. Works great and everyone now wants the recipe! Again, thanks, Jo.

I use this recipe all the time.  I usually make it with stevia instead of sugar, because we try to avoid sugar and REFUSE to use artificial sweetners.  My 18 month old asks for this all the time :)  So good!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Great recipe to make with the kids.  Don't forget to roll the lemons on a flat surface before juicing - it really helps get all of the juice out of the lemons.  We have made this recipe many times and don't change a thing.  Many thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!  I halved the recipe and microwaved the sugar in 2 cups of water until dissolved.  I used "Italian Volcano Lemon Juice" (not from concentrate).  I thought it was a tad on the sweet side but it might've been the lemon juice.  Next time I won't make a simple syrup...I'll just add sugar to the water and lemon juice.  In the same amount of time it would take the simple syrup to cool, the sugar will have dissolved and will taste the same.  This is how I've always made lemonade.

I wasn't impressed.  It was a lot of prep for lemonade and the end result wasn't sweet enough for our taste.  I may try again and just add more sugar, but I don't think the longer prep time is worth it.  Lemonade the way I usually make it is pretty darn good and really quick!

Because I alter this I can't give it 5*s, but this works for me. I use Splenda instead of sugar and Realemon Juice instead of lemons. Put everything together in a jug and shake. Only takes a couple of minutes to make because I don't have to cook it into a syrup! Keep it in the frig in bottles and I take it to the gym with me.

This was a great treat - I switched about a third of the juice to lime instead of lemon, but it still tasted great!

Great lemonade.  Cut the sugar to a little over 1 cup and it was sweet enough.  Served it at a cookout and everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks!

Excellent!  I had one lemon so re-set the recipe for two servings.  I whipped it up chilled it in the freezer - added ice and drank it.  Took five minutes and I don't even have a juicer - I used my hands!  Delicious.  Though I would recommend using a juicer for larger quantities!

I have never made fresh lemonade so I searched and searched for a good recipe and this is it!  I had to squeeze the lemons by hand since I don't have a juicer so I popped them in the microwave for about 30 seconds until they felt lukewarm.  This made squeezing a sinch and I was able to get more juice out of each lemon.  I thought it was a little sweet so I may reduce the sugar the next time I make it, but that is a personal preference.  Thanks for sharing!!

I was looking for something quick and easy, but I honestly never expected it to be this good! I had some lemon juice for a dessert I made the other night, and I don't normally have any in the house, but I will start buying some just to make this lemonade!

Excellent recipe, but I noticed that it lacks alcohol. I made it just as described in the recipe, but then poured my glass half-full of Tanqueray gin before adding lemonade. Excellent! I imagine a cheaper cocktail (and one more appealing to those who don't like gin) could be prepared by using middle-of-the-road vodka.

This recipe was delicious.  I only gave it 4 stars because it was a bit sweeter than I prefer.  I made this for a cookout and several guests commented that they prefer lemonade to be a bit more sour.  I will definitely try this again, but next time I will try to modify so that it isn't quite so sweet.

We have two lemon trees in our back yard and this was perfect for a summer drink.  Its so versatile too - I followed the exact recipe and was very pleased with the outcome. 
You could easily add more lemon juice and water if you wished to water it down or create a more tart version - but I enjoyed both the sweet and then tart taste that this produced!

Great lemonade.  Easy, too.  To keep it from being too sweet, I just followed another's suggestion and reserved a lot of the sugar syrup so folks could add it to their liking.  No leftovers.  Make a double batch if you've got more than 4 adults partaking!

This can be adjusted without compromising the taste.  Add a little more water if too sweet, more syrup if too sour, etc.  I also made lemon-lime but the lemon was better.

This lemonade was so tasty!  I cut back on the sugar, only adding 1 1/4 cups and also adding about two extra cups water and it was still plenty sweet.  I have never made simple syrup before...it was so smooth, no continued stirring because of sugar sitting on the bottom of the pitcher.

Perfect for a summer day! Everyone enjoyed this lemonade that I brought to a picnic, and it is really thirst quenching. Still perhaps a little tangy even with all that sugar, but good nonetheless. Really easy to make, I even made another pitcher on the spot. Garnish with fresh lemon slices and you have an excellent summer cooler that is popular with kids and adults alike.

This is really good and very simple. I followed anothers suggestion to cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and it was just right.
Instead of boiling the sugar and water in the saucepan, I added 1 cup of boiling water to the sugar and stired. The sugar dissolved easily.

One piece of info that would have been nice to have prior to making this is about how many lemons to buy to get the 1 1/2 cups of juice.  I never made lemonade so had no idea.  I got 5 lemons, squeezed the heck out of them, and came up 1/2 cup short.  I would suggest buying at least 8 lemons.

This was even better and less bitter than the lemonade I get at Chick Fil A! I followed the advice of others and soaked the lemons in hot water for 10 minutes, then rolled them before juicing- that definitely helped a LOT.

I have finally found a lemonade that isn't fussy.  I did change the amounts however.  We used 1 1/3 c sugar if I am making popscicles.  If it is made for drinking then I used 1 1/2 c sugar!  Thanks so much!

This is really good lemonade, but I have to admit something.  I used lemon juice from concentrate.  That's all I had and it was wonderful.  I also added some frozen berries.  Outstanding.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last weekend. It was great. i followed the recipe exactly. It was just the right amount of sweetness and bitterness. My lemonade usually comes out too sweet or too bitter. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is PERFECT. It truly is the best lemonade I've ever had. It really wasn't very much work, i used 6 juicy lemons which gave me the perfect 1 and a half cups lemon juice. I didn't let the syrup get to room temperature and then chill till it was cold, it was still warm, but didnt matter at all. When I put the finished product in the fridge to chill it did the job! Great recipe, a new staple in my house.

As others have said, this was way too sweet.  To remedy it, I added an extra 1/2 cup of lemon juice (we like lemonade very tart) and an extra 3/4 cup water.  Even then it was pretty darn sweet, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.

This recipe didn't take 4 hours.  I heated the sugar and 1 C.water until it was melted all the way, then shut it off.  Then I slowly poured it into the 7 C.Water and lemon juice mixture.  It was a little lukewarm after that, so I just poured it over ice cubes.  Delish!!!  Oh, use an electric juicer! It takes just a few minutes!

Fantastic!  There's nothing like homemade lemonade.  Cooking the sugar changed the flavor ever so slightly, and I am so pleased with the result.  I made lemonade until my family was sick of it, though it's the middle of winter.  I'm not patient enough to refrigerate the syrup, so I simply added a lot of ice in place of some of the water.  Really enjoyed it!

My lemon tree was full of ripe lemons,so my son and i picked and juiced  a ton. Found this recipe and love it. A little sweet for my taste but my son and husband love it. I'm going to freeze juice in individual bags to make as needed. God love hubby, i usually squeez by hand, but when he saw how many lemons we had he went and bought me a juicer. Thanks

I will not be looking for another recipe. This was amazingly tasty. ;) It reminded me of childhood. I did not need to make any changes but I did put the lemon juice in the freezer along side the syrup and water to get extra cold. I also added the rinds after squeezing to the 7 cups of water just to get the last bit of juice out. (I juiced by hand) I can't believe how great this is. Thanks

This is by far the best I have ever had. My 8 yerar old daughter can't stop talking about it. She said I should let Rachel ray taste it. Ha. ha. Since it cost $4.00 for the lemons we will only have this once a month. Thank you sooo much for posting.

This is great.  As per other reviews, I reduced the sugar a good bit as we like a little "tang" to our lemonade, rather than just sweetness.  In a glass pitcher with lemon slices and a few sprigs of fresh mint, it also looks very pretty!  Thanks!

This is exactly how we make lemonade. Simple syrup is wonderful for many things...we like to make a batch for ice tea and leave it in the refrigerator. That way everyone can make their tea as sweet as they like w/out undissolved sugar crystals at the bottom of the tea. We also like to mix this lemonade mix with unsweetened tea instead of the water...lemonade tea.

Really great lemonade-- not too sweet nor too tart.  If you don't have time to wait till the sugar syrup cools, instead of the 8 cups of water, fill your pitcher completely with ice.  Put about two cups of cold water into your sugar syrup and pour the sugar syrup onto the ice.  It will melt some ice.  Then, add enough water to fill the rest of the pitcher.  When the ice melts, it will dilute the lemonade a little, but not too much since it's not really adding much water past the initial recipe.  The first few sips with frozen ice still in it might be a little more tart, but not at all sour.  

We used this at our lemonade stand and people LOVED it; we sold three big pitchers in a few hours.   Get one of those flip-top lemon squeezer gadgets and the hassle of squeezing all those lemons changes to fun.  Couldn't keep the kids from doing it!

Very, very good!  I even used 2 oranges, and the rest lemons, and it is still wonderful.  I guess it is the boiling and cooling that makes all the difference??  I don't know, and I was sceptical, but it really is good.  Hope you like it as much as we do!

Nearly perfect lemonade and easy to make. Not sour in the least bit. Good lemon flavor, but I think I will add a bit more lemon juice to my next batch. That should be perfect I suspect.

Love this recipe. I added a cup and a half of lemons, 3/4 cup sugar, and 7 cups cold water. The lemonade was sweet enough and refreshing. I added 1 cup  boiling water, either from a hot pot or microwaved, to the sugar and let it dissolve in a glass bowl. I cut the lemons into quarters and microwaved them for 3-4 minutes. It was much easier to squeeze the juice out after they were microwaved. I do allow the lemons to cool a bit after microwaving, so I don't burn my hands. I squeeze the juice over a sieve into the sugar water mixture; then pour it into 7 cups cold water and serve immediately over ice or refrigerate till chilled.

I have used this recipe for years using fresh lemons from my tree. Sometimes I'll substitute limes for limeade. Just to be safe, I always use less sugar (1-1/2 cups) than recipe calls for. You can always add more if needed.

It is a great recipe! I like to make cocktails with it. Add vodka and club soda for a refreshing summertime drink!

This was great but a little too sweet for us. Instead, I used 1 3/4 cups of agave nectar, mixed this with 2 cups of hot water. Then added 2 1/2 c of lemon juice and filled the jug up to 3 1/2 liters. Got rave reviews from the inlaws making the recipe this way.

I used this recipe to make homemade lemonade for the first time this summer and now my family won't drink store bought lemonade! I actually use a little extra sugar, about 2 cups, and add most of the sugar/water mixture to the lemonade, then taste it and decide whether or not to add the rest. I think some lemons must be more tart then others because some batches need more sugar than others. A tip if you are squeezing the lemons by hand: let the lemons come to room temperature and roll them on the counter to soften them up before squeezing.

Delicious!  For a healthy twist, substitute Pure Vermont Maple Syrup for the white sugar.  Pure Maple is a low glycemic index food, packed with anti-oxidants and minerals (a serving of pure maple syrup has more potassium than a banana), and tastes great.  In fact, because of the "sweet" taste, you can use less than you would traditional sugar, cutting calories.

Buy it at your local grocery store or online.

I love making my own Lemonade lately, but I have to make twice as much because it doesn't last more than a couple couple of days! My container is part of that problem, said with a smile! :) This recipe is just right! Not tweaking this one!

This is fantastic!  I was in a hurry when I made this so we made the simple syrup as indicated but we did not have the cooling time.  We put crushed ice and water to make the 7 cups of water necessary.  This cooled the syrup off just fine and we were able to drink the lemonade right away.

The Best Lemonade Recipe.  Simple to Make and Great Tasting.  To make it easier in squeezing the lemons I put them in a bowl of very warm water then roll them on the counter top.  So Really Yummy!  My family loves it!

This is the best lemonade ever! I add raspberry mix (no alcohol) to make a raspberry lemonade. I make it for every special occasion and take a jug when I am visiting my older friends. They say it reminds them of the lemonade their mom used to make.

I just recently dug out my Black & Decker Electric Citrus Juicer, so I'm making every lemon and limeade recipe I can find... I made this, subbing 1/2 C Splenda and 1 C Erythritol for the sugar (hate hate hate the taste and after-taste of anything with straight Splenda).  Fan-freakin'-tabulous!!! And with the electric juicer it only took 6 lemons and about 6 minutes for all that juice.

Great base recipe. I just needed to know the ratio of lemon juice to sugar to water (1:1:6 worked for me). Here's how i make my single serving in minutes! Put 1 tbsp honey and 6 tbsp water in glass. Microwave 30 seconds. Stir to dissolve honey. Add 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice. Add some ice. Done! I like making it fresh daily and drinking immediately because if left out long, vitamin C breaks down.

I made this recipe for the sole purpose of finding out if it lives up to the hype. It does. One recommendation I have, and maybe it defeats the purpose of homemade lemonade, is using store bought lemon juice. It tastes just as great and makes it a million times easier.

I made this recipe, adding some salt and a hint of mango. Instead of boiling it, I microwaved for a minute and froze for 2 hours. It turned out to be a very refreshing drink.

Way too sweet.  My pitcher couldn't hold enough water to take out the sweetness AND I used 1/2 cup less sugar than called for (for the kids).  I have a sweet tooth btw.  Having said that, after a few glasses I was able to add more water to the pitcher and sorted it all.  It was really yummy!!  I saved my "juiced" lemons and cut them up in little wedges and threw them in the pitcher.  I will make again but less sugar ;)  Sorry Kids!!

Good base recipe, but I would cut back on the sugar. I bought a bag of lemons and used them all for 1.5 cups of lemon juice and I found this to be too sweet. Didn't have any more fresh lemons, so I grabbed the bottle of lemon juice from my fridge and added another 1/2 cup. Yes! 

I ended up using 2 Cups of lemon juice. Next time, I'll do the math and cut back on the sugar.

Like other reviews, I decreased the sugar by 1/4c.  I am a sugar fanatic, but the full amount would have been a little too much.  I made a double batch for a party, and it was almost gone by the end.  This really is the best lemonade ever!

I didn't have lemons so I used all the limes in my fridge, which gave me a little over a cup & it came out PERFECT! The trick really is to make the simple syrup first

My 6 year old daughter and I just made this today and her review is: I think this is terrific! We used 1 1/4 cups of sugar, which was plenty sweet for us. We did make the sugar syrup and just let it cool on the stove while we juiced 6 large lemons (soaking them in hot water for a few minutes and rolling them on the counter before juicing really helps). Then we added the sugar syrup to the strained lemon juice and added 8 cups of water. This is the perfect drink on a hot summer day and so easy to make, especially with a child.

Add a couple of small bottles of club soda and you'll have an extra refreshing sparkling beverage.  Put a couple of sprigs of fresh mint or lemon balm for color!  Wonderful lemonade recipe!  Not too sweet, not too tart.

Never made fresh squeezed lemonade before. It was delicious! I needed 7 lemons to get the amount of lemon juice called for. The simple syrup was really easy to make, and it was great, no gritty texture. I highly recommend this, even though it takes a while to squeeze all those lemons by hand!

We just made a small 4 person batch with 2 lemons. Because it was such a small batch the boiling process was not needed to dissolve the sugar.

Made this yesterday for a small party.  It really was "The Best Lemonade Ever"!  Definitely needs to be doubled for larger parties though.  The four kids I had drinking it (and coming back for more) nearly chugged it all down by themselves.  The 4 oz servings this recipe goes by is just not very realistic, especially on a hot day.  Otherwise, perfect!

The first thing I did was dissolve 1 1/4 cups of sugar in 1 1/2 cups of HOT tap water and let that cool.  I refrigerated it overnight because I was too tired to squeeze lemons.  The next day I had a lightly sweet simple syrup!  I hand squeezed 8 whole lemons to get exactly one cup of lemon juice. (That was a lot of work!)  With 1 cup of lemon juice in the pitcher, I added 5 cups of cold water and 1 cup of my simple syrup.  Thankfully that was perfect.

A bit too sweet and too watery for my taste.  I only used 3/4 the amount of simple sugar and it could have used the juice of at least one more lemon.

Very simple and easy, and it tastes so fresh and delicious.  I had three large lemons left over from another recipe, so I was able to make a half batch of this lemonade.  I have a feeling my husband and I will be drinking it all!  I added some leftover fresh mint to the pitcher as garnish.  Looks and tastes great.  I'll definitely make this again, although I might reduce the sugar next time so it's a little less sweet.

First time I made lemonade. Did cut back on the sugar, it was still refreshing and sweet. Will make this again and maybe next time I will share, but not this batch! Thanks Jo.

I made this recipe for my daughter to sell at her lemonade stand. I doubled the recipe and hand squeezed the lemons and it still only took me about 20 minutes to make. I'm not a huge fan of lemonade, but this is really good - not too sweet and not too tart.

Yummy!  Tastes like summertime in the shade with a cool breeze.  We tried with limes, too, and it worked great.  I also set some of the lime juice aside to do a sugar-free version with stevia powder, which I thought was even better.  Lighter flavor, WAY fewer calories.  Try about 1 - 1 1/2 Tablespoons stevia powder to 2 quarts limeade.

This is a great recipe as is although I like my lemonade a bit more tart than sweet so I upped the lemon juice to 2 c and cut the water to 6 c.  Very tasty and super refreshing for summer :)

I wasn't crazy about this and didn't think it was the best lemonade ever. The taste of lemonade was bland, and at the same time too sugary. I won't be making this again, sorry.

Excellent proportions for flavor. When I add the additional 7 cups of water, I take a tray of ice or two and measure the water on top of it. Since most of it melted, think I'll use frozen raspberries as "ice" that won't dilute it further.

this was really good - like some others, I reduced the amount of sugar because I like my lemonade tart; i was using up leftover lemons, so had 1 c. lemon juice, 4.5 cups water, and 2/3 c. sugar.  YUM!!!!

I love lemonade. I have never made fresh lemonade, and I now will never buy the store stuff again. This is WONDERFUL. Sure it is a little extra work, but really not much. And you can adjust the amount of ingredients per your taste. Fantastic. Thanks so much for sharing.

This lemonade was easy to make and delicious.  It was a bit too sweet (the lemons werent that sour) so I used more lemons.  To put in a little more tart into it I added some grapefruit juice as well. Its very good with strawberries or mint.

Amazing!! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was so easy. Worth every SECOND of work. I served half of it with strawberries, and half without, and both were great!

Was WAY better than normal lemonade, but too much sugar. Next time, I might use a little more lemon or a little less sugar... Very good tho! :)

This is the BEST! We added fresh strawberry puree : ) Took 10 smallish lemons, a 2lb bag. Next time we'll get a big bag of lemons from Sams Club so we can make more!

I managed to get away with only using 6 lemons and only a cup of fresh lemon juice by boiling the leftover lemon flesh and peels with the water for a few minutes, then straining it out =) Yum!

I made this for our family BBQ. I did it with the bottled lemmon juice and it worked great!, I heated up the sugar, added ice and watter, and sliced a few strawberries, it took me all of 10 minutes. It was awsome. I will make this again and again.

This lemonade was VERY good. I made a few changes but my changes did not change the overall taste of this recipe. I cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup to total 1 1/2 cups. I also did not wait for the mixture to get to room temperature. I took it right off the stove and put in several large blocks of ice and put it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes until cooled. I only added 6 cups of water because I added ice to cool the mixture and I didnt want it to become too watery. I served it chilled over ice and added my own strawberry puree. I took about 2 cups of frozen whole unsweetened strawberries and put them in a food processor while still frozen. I processed them until they were chopped and then added them to a blender with about 1/2 cup of water and 3 tbsp. sugar. I blended it until smooth and added about 2 tbsp. puree per glass of lemonade and topped it with whipped cream. My only complaint is that it doesnt make enough for an average family of 4 who loves lemonade, it was gone ine 1 day :)

My 16 yr old son made this all by himself.  He loved it.  I'm not a big lemonade fan, but I did try it and would agree it's very tasty.  I could go for it a little less sweet, but it was very refreshing!

Perfect Lemonade! I discovered that my ice cube tray takes two cups of water to refill. So after boiling the water and sugar mixture together, I let the syrup cool for about five minutes before dumping an entire tray of ice cubes (equal to two cups of water) in the syrup. Then I add the remaining five cups of water and lemon juice, stir until all the ice is melted, and it's ready to drink. This speeds up the process considerably!

Doubled the recipe and only used two cups of sugar total.  It was definitely sweet enough with only two cups of sugar, so I'd give it 5 stars with the adjustments, only 4 without.!

I adjusted this to 10 servings, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was fine. I used bottled lemon juice. By using the microwave instead of the stovetop to heat it, and then bottled lemon juice instead of squeezing fresh, it was fast and easy. After a good chilling and ice cubes, it was great.

Love this lemonade.  I didn't have quite 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice, but used about 1 1/4 cups lemon juice and the same with the sugar.  I put the lemons in the sink and rolled them on the counter-thanks for that.  It made it so easy to juice them.  :)  I microwaved the sugar and water and then put ice in it to do it faster.  It mixed together in under 15 minutes and was perfect!

This was way too sweet for me but hubby loved it.  It was good but very very sweet.  It tasted like the kind of lemonade that comes off one of those beverage guns at a restaurant.  I added another 1/2 cup of lemon juice which helped a little.

I made this for my husband who loves lemonade.  I didn't understand how there could be so many positive reviews for a drink ...until I tasted it.  I did add extra water to my own glass, but I have to admit this is one refreshing lemonade.  Thanks Jo!

Great recipe that left my husband raving! I used some others ideas: microwaving the simple syrup versus the stove (I had the stove packed cooking dinner), and I added more sugar for our personal taste.

WOW!  A friend of mine brought over a huge bag of lemons from her tree and the first thing I thought to make for the hot weather we have been having is fresh lemonade.  This is an amazing, simple recipe!  Seems too simple to be so good, but so not so!  I used all fresh lemons and though the lemons were very juicy, much juicier than those I usually buy at the store, I needed ALOT of lemons, but so worth it if you can!  I made the simple syrup a few days ago and put it in the fridge until I had a chance to start squeezing the lemons.  Turned out great!  A keeper recipe for sure!  Thanks!

My DIL was making her famous fried chicken. Famous because she makes them about once a year! I made the simple syrup at home and chilled it. Asked her to get 8 lemons on her way home. DH and I squeezed the lemons together while DIL cooked and Son made smashed garlic potatoes. Added the 7 C. water, then syrup to the correct sweetness. Had some left over, but GREAT lemonade.  Can't wait to make it again, since it got left at DIL's house.

This is very good. Made it twice when i visited my family in California and we picked fresh lemons off the tree, so it was even more better.

Perfect blend of sweet and sour.  I added mint to make it even more refreshing.

Was the best lemonade I have ever drinken. Or anyone in my family for that matter! Would lessen the sugar possibly if I ever made it again, but then again, maybe not. Our lemons at home are very sour and everytime I have used them for lemonade in the past, I have had to continually dump sugar in in order to sweeten it enough. This is great!!

Excellent recipe!!!  I first washed and dryed the lemons, then bake them for an hour at 325 degree on a cookie sheet lined with a cooling rack turning once. I let them cool to room temp. Than ran them through an electric juicer rind and all. Than made the recipe to direction. Wonderful wonderful stuff. Everyone like it.

Made this exactly to recipe, and it was the best lemonade I've ever had. I used a full 2lb bag of small lemons to get 1 and 1/2 c juice. I'll be making this all summer!

Really refreshing.  It will take about 8 lemons to give you the amount of juice called for in the recipe.  A perfect summer beverage!

Jo, I just finished making your lemonade.  If I could rate it 10 stars I would! From start to finish I was done in 10 minutes (using an electric juicer to accomplish that).  Another viewer stated that she cut the sugar to one cup.  Knowing you can add & not take away, I started with 1 cup simple syrup in fear it would be too sweet.  Well, as the saying goes "Don't mess with perfection", I added the rest of the 3/4 cup simple syrup and VOILA!  The perfect blend of sweet and tart.  This truly is the "Best Lemonade Ever".  It took me back 45 years to my front yard with my 1 cent lemonade stand!  Thank you for the memories and taking the time to post your recipe.

Easy and delicious.  I used my potato ricer to juice the lemons and only needed to use 5 of them.  Adopting a childhood tradition, I also sliced up an orange (gave it a little squeeze over the pitcher) and threw the entire thing in.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is truly the best lemonade ever! I loved it, I only added 1 1/4 cup of sugar which is the way I like my lemonade however next time I'll have to add more sugar for the hubby it was to tart for him that way. I followed the directions that someone had said and let it soak in hot water for 10 mins. and then roll out on counter before squeezing and I thought that worked really good, it didn't take that long to juice the lemons. It took 7 lemons for mine to equal the 1 1/2 c juice. This will be a new tradition at my house every summer, it will be made many many times. Thanks Jo!

Really, MSI, haven't you ever heard of simple syrup? Simple syrup is the way cooks incorporate sugar into cold drinks like lemonade, iced tea, mojitos, etc. If you added plain sugar and "mixed it all together," you'd end up with a sugar sludge on the bottom of the glass or pitcher. This is really basic stuff.

I loved how easy this recipe was; I took the advice of another reviewer and microwaved the water and sugar and put some ice cubes in it to cool it. The only drawback that I could see with this recipe is that it was too sweet for my husband and I so I added less sugar. To make it more to our tastes, I just added some more water and the juice of one extra lemon. Very good!

I noticed that this recipe calls for more sugar than actual lemon juice.  Also, a few other reviews thought this recipe made lemonade that was too sweet.  I like my lemonade quite lemon-y and tart (but not pucker-face tart), so I reduced the sugar to 1 and a quarter cups and to my amazement it was still too sweet for me!  I added in an extra 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice to tone it down further.  Something to consider if you prefer your lemonade more on the tart side.  Also, 6 average sized lemons for me made 1.5 cups of lemon juice using a simple citrus juicer.

We followed the recipe to the T, except for cutting the sugar back a little (as I always do). This is wonderful Lemonade! I can't wait to make it again during the summer and spike it with Vodka for hot days by the pool!!!

Love this recipe! I used bottled lemon juice and went light on the sugar. My husband, the big lemonade drinker, loved it! I prefer my a little sweeter, so I just add a little extra sugar to my glass. I did not boil the water / sugar, just used hot water to dissolve the sugar. A keeper recipe!

This was very much liked.  I cut down on the sugar to one cup and kept everything else the same.

I made this exactly as you say, and I received RAVES from all my guests!
Perfect balance. Not too sweet, because if it's too sweet it doesn't quench thirst, and not too tart...no puckering of cheeks and lips.   Just perfect.   IDEA: For some guests, we got out the blender, added ice, poured in lemonade, and whirled & twirled to make a Lemon Slushie, we called "Lemon Freeze", and it tasted fantastic.   As good as Rita's Italian Ice.   Thank you

This really is the best ever! My one and only lemonade recipe now, because it tastes so much fresher than canned, powdered or frozen varieties.  I use stevia instead of sugar since I am diabetic.  I heat about 1 cup of the water to warmish and dissolve the stevia in it.  (I only use about 1 and 1/3 c stevia).  Then I just add this to the other ingredients.  I had some unsweetened cherry juice left over from something else and added 1-2 T -- fantastic.

I used my Cuisinart juicer and this was very quick and easy, surprisingly so.  I did reduce the sugar, as my husband likes it a little more tart.  I didn't wait for the syrup to chill, simply poured it over ice.

A Freaking Mazing. I got bored one night 2am and decided to cook something. I actually cheated though and used that lemon juice that you can buy at stores (it's 3am can't think of it's name). Then because i was a bit to impatient, after i boiled and disolved the water and sugar i moved the liquid to a jar and put it in an ice bath for about 10 minutes, then the freezer for an additional ten. Mix and enjoy, I'm anxious to make it correctly to see how much better it will be.

This is an excellent recipe. I can only imagin what it would taste like if i used fresh lemons! i used the lemon juice in a bottle cut the sugar a bit. I was in a hurry to have some so i added 2 cups of cold water to the simple syrup to cool it down then combined the rest of the ingredients in the pitcher. i poured it over ice and it was ready in 10minutes. Delicious!

This Lemonade is the best that I  have ever had in my life. I added ice cold water from a water cooler instead of waiting for it to cool to room temperature. This is for sure a five star recipe!

This was excellent lemonade! I just stirred the sugar in all 8 cups of water and it was fine. I'd also suggest a little less sugar, but it was still delish!

It was very good, I used organic lemon juice and it was very easy to make.  I agree that it is on the sweet side, so if you like your lemonade more tart, use less sugar.

This is really good lemonade, I took suggestions of less sugar and it was still sweet, but tart enough to offset the sweet, love it. 
I used an Italian imported lemon juice and it was delicious. But too expensive for everyday lemonade but wanted to try it, next time fresh squeezed, its the best way to drink lemonade, in my opionion. FYI incase you dont know, I also use simple syrup(slightly cooled) to pour over strawberries for shortcake, and add a little Grand Marnier..excellent.

The first time I made it, I used fresh squeezed lemons. It was wonderful! The second time my husband suggested using bottled lemon juice. Awful! It tasted like Lysol! :P I'm going to wait until I can get fresh lemons. I will make this lemonade again! :)

I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup and juiced two large oranges as well.  It tasted like my favorite lemonade at the State Fair!  For me, it took the juice of 9 lemons to make 1 1/2 cups.

Loved this recipe.  If you add 1 Tbsp Maraschino Cherry Juice at the end of the recipe, it makes a wonderful, very tasty pink lemonade with a faint cherry flavor. Very good, had it while vacationing this past summer.  Also, you could just add a cherry to each cup as you drink it.  Thanks for the recipe, Jo.

I am a big fan of "refreshing" drinks rather than tasteless drinks, and this fit the bill.  I took the tip other reviewers had to soak the lemons in hot water.  My 7 yr old nephew loved this! ~ He did, however, ask what the "floaties" were. Explained that they were "pulp". He looked confused, so we told him they were where the "extra tangy" taste comes from when you make real lemonade.  He said it rocked, and wanted to know if this was from "the olden days" (his phrase).  Thanks!

This is a perfect recipe for lemonade, and WAAAY better than the overpriced "fresh squeezed lemonade" I bought at the county fair this summer. I only made half of the recipe - 80 ounces is a lot.

I felt something was off with the flavor of this so I played around a bit and the result was: 2 cups sugar, 2 cups lemon juice, and 10 cups water. This ended up being perfect for my taste. Thank you for giving me a base to build on to find the recipe for me.

This recipe is wonderful!  I have always had trouble finding the right ratio of lemons to water. I did cut the sugar in half (not enough people complaining it was too tart in the reviews :) ) and it was perfect for my tastes.

A million thanks for this fabulous recipe -- I don't change a thing! I serve this lemonade in a glass pitcher with lemon slices floating in it. I just put a batch of sugar/water in the refrigerator to cool and will try it with fresh limes instead of lemons today. Can't wait to see how the limeade turns out.

Very nice recipe. Used only 1 cup raw unprocessed sugar (heath freak :0). Added a few squeezes of lime juice and lemon slices to final product.

I use 1 1/3 c. sugar to keep it a little more tart, but I've made this numerous times.  I find using half fresh squeezed lemon juice and half Realemon juice is just perfect.  Great mixed with a little vodka too!!

Excellent.  It's a little hard to get all the seeds out and keep some of the pulp, but it is fun to do.  This lemonade tastes great on a sunny Summer afternoon.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed the lemonade, although as previously mentioned, it was quite sweet.  I increased the lemon juice to 2 cups and cut the resulting syrup roughly in half with water before serving.  I also only used 2 lemons and a lime and supplemented with bottled lemon juice.

Good lemonade!  These made great Arnold Palmers with some tea I had in the fridge.  

I only used 6 lemons and noticed this was just enough!

I love this recipe because it's so easy to make, and I always have Minute Maid lemon juice on-hand in my freezer. I prefer my lemonade with pulp, but I never buy lemons. One thing I do differently with this recipe is to boil the water and then dissolve the sugar; sometimes I add herbal or green tea (peppermint is great) to the water, but my husband says that at that point it's actually iced tea and not lemonade.  Thanks for the recipe, Jo!

Very tasty and refreshing! Not too sweet or too tart. We actually used real lemons (bought a bag and kept juicing them until we got a cup and a half of juice). We took this to a church gathering, and it was gone in no time!

This really is the best lemonade ever! I love how sweet it is! To cut down on calories, I use one cup of sugar and the rest is splenda and you can't even tell the difference. The first time I made it I also cut up and added some lemon peels to it, but after a day it became too tart. Not a bad move if you like it tart though.

I had a friend who would make lemonade to die for, however, she wouldn't share her "secret" recipe.  I think I've found her "secret" in this recipe.  It is equal if not better in taste.  HA!  I will be making this for  years to come.

Excellent! My son wanted some lemonade and I only had two lemons. I only got about 3/4 cup of juice. I made the simple syrup before reading the reviews, so I mixed the remaining water and lemon juice then stirred in simple syrup to taste. The lemonade turned out perfectly! We will definitely have this again often.

This is indeed the best lemonade ever. Living in the Netherlands our sugar seems to be much sweeter than yours. Therefore I used only 1 cup of sugar. The lemonade came out great.
Yesterday I used limes instead of lemons to make limeade (or what would you call it). Came out great too!

This is the first lemonade I've ever made except for the powdered kind that I really never liked that much, so I decided to try out this recipie. I thought it was a little bit sweet but next time I'll just add a little less sugar. The pulp in it is really tasty and I don't think I 'd like it as much if it wasn't in it.

This is truly great.  SOOOO easy, too!!  I had to modify it to 15 servings because my pitcher didn't accomodate the full recipe, but obviously that turned out fine.  My husband is a lemonade fanatic and I'm so tired of canned versions... so I was awful happy that this tasted like homemade :)

Made this for a BBQ on the weekend and couldn't keep the jug full! Even my husband loved it, and he is not much of a lemonade fan. Have found it a bit sweet, but added more water, which allowed for more lemonade, so it worked perfectly. Thanks!!

Made this with a few dropper full of liquid Stevia for the diabetics in my family. They all raved. Since our lemon tree is prolific this year, we'll be making this a lot.

Very good. I used the tip of placing the lemons in warm water which made it easier to squeeze them.  This lemonade was excellent and will be my staple this summer.

This is a good base recipe.  I always like it a little more lemony so I added another 1/2 cup.  I also didn't have enough time to let syrup cool so I put lots of ice in pitcher, then poured syrup and lemon juice over ice and added enough water to fill pitcher.

Very good, but did not taste 'fresh'.  Tasted more like syrup-based lemonade.  Added more fresh lemon juice after chilling, since I prefer my lemonade to taste more tart than sweet.  Still, very good!

Wonderful 5 star recipe!  This tastes exactly like the great fresh squeezed lemonade they make at fairs or that we love to buy on the boardwalk at the Jersey Shore.  I took the advice of other reviewers and filled my pitcher with ice with quick chilling because I didn't have the time to let it chill in the frig.  I also used 7 lemons for the 1½ cups of juice.  This was so good.  I've made it at least three times and my 6 year old son and all his friends love it!  Thanks so much for this Yummy summertime drink!

Really good!  I microwaved the lemons for 30 seconds in the microwave and then rolled them vigorously on the counter to bring the juice out before I juiced them.  I agree, it's really sweet so I added a cup and a half more water.  By the time we added ice it was perfect!

This recipe tastes good even if you make it with store-bought lemon juice(I still recommend fresh), just add a 1/4 cup more lemon juice.

WONDERFUL, this was so good.  My husband said after his first sip, it tastes like the carnival lemonade.  Cooking the sugar water is great idea, only takes a few minutes.  I let it chill for about 15 minutes then added it right in. I couldn't wait for it to cool and it was great.  You don't have to wait.  I would add 1 or two more lemons next time, for a more lemony flavor I used about 7 this time.   Thanks, YUMMY

I made this lemonade for my three year olds lemonade stand. I personally thought it was too sweet, but every person that purchased it said it was absolutely wonderful. We sold three gallons of it (which I squeezed by hand ugh!) then I finally gave in and sent my husband to the store for Newman's Lemonade (my personal favorite). We didn't get quite the same reaction from that lemonade. I think I just like really sour things. Thanks for the recipe, I'll definetely make it again once I get a juicer. LOL

I didn't have the best luck with this recipe. There wasn't a very strong lemon flavor, there was too much water. I did like the idea of heating the water and sugar until the sugar disolved, I'm going to use that in my other lemonaid recipes to keep the sugar from collecting at the bottom of the glass!

Very refreshing and tasty!  I made it ever so quickly by adding ice to the hot liquid to cool it down right away, then adding enough water to dilute the mixture.

I suspected that 1 3/4 cups of sugar would be too much for our particular tastes, and I was right. One and and a quarter cups is perfect. This is such an easy recipe. Perfect! (To make it extra special, I stir in a little pureed raspberry or strawberry).

** Thirst quenching happiness in a glass **
I took the time to read the most helpful reviews and went to work.  I soaked my lemons in hot water for 10 mins.  While my lemons were soaking I boiled 1 and 1/4 cup of water with 1 and 1/4 cup of sugar.  While the sugar/water (simple syrup) was cooling I rolled my lemons and hand squeezed them over a stainless steel mesh colander right into the pitcher.  I poured the simple syrup and water into the pitcher, rest of the water and mixed well.  So good, so refreshing and really didn't take that long at all.  I will definitely make this again!

Doesn’t take even close to 4 hours. It was a huge hit with everyone. I also did the sugar/water in microwave until boiling to save a pot.

Great recipe. I did NOT use 1 3/4 of sugar. I tried one cup and it was insanely sweet. I don't even want to imagine how much 1 3/4 of sugar would taste like. The next time I make it i'm going to try under a cup of sugar and If it needs more I will  add more. 

ALSO I made this another time with 1 cup of lemonade juice and the rest lime juice because I ran out of lemon juice and it was awesome!!!

I used 8 lemons to make 1 cup of lemon juice...cut sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and used a whole gallon of water for the entire recipe...1 3/4 c sugar for 8 c water seemed too much. It's very refreshing. I like the idea of making the simple syrup.  If I had a couple more lemons I would add them as well but it's still plenty lemony. Super easy to make...use ice to cool down your syrup.

This is a perfect base recipe.   Make it as written and you won't have a drop leftover.  
After some experimenting, we found that we most love it with 1.5 c sugar and we start with 7 cups of water and add more to taste.  But that has to do with the flavor and ripeness of the lemons available that day, not the recipe.  We actually bought an electric citrus juicer because of this recipe.

My kids and I made this recipe. I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 1 3/4 cups. The result was a nice crisp slightly tart lemonade. The best part was getting the kids involved. Used about 11 lemons to get to 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice just FYI.

I have made this recipe everyday since I found it a week ago! It is so refreshing and a nice change from water. Even my husband, a hard core mountain dew drinker, switches to this lemonade when there is any left. I did follow the original directions, it was very good, but I then adapted it by lowering the sugar a little and conserving lemons to get a bigger quantity of lemonade. When did lemons go to $4 a bag? You will love this recipe!

This is for real the best lemonade ever! I recommend tasting as you go, some lemons are more sour than others and so the recipe quantities aren't reliable every time. I've also used sparkling water instead of flat and it is mind blowing.

For one large lemon, I use 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of water. After letting the syrup cool for only a few minutes, I poured it over ice cubes, then added the lemon juice, cold water, and sparkling water.

Made as per the recipe and it's a great lemonade. Simple, sweet enough yet not too sweet. Great go-to recipe! My lemons were very ripe (had to use them in this because I didn't want them going bad) which made for much easier juicing.

Too much sugar, the lemonade was WAY too sweet, yuck! also, too little water. - I did, however, make some alterations to the recipe: I took away some of the sugar, instead of 1 ¾ cups of sugar, I did 1 1/3 cups of sugar. I also added some water, instead of 8 cups, I did 9 cups. That made it better. I also changed the way I did the sugar, instead of bringing the sugar to a boil and then leaving it out to cool, I stood next to the sugar and stirred it every 10 seconds or so until it had dissolved, then I took it off the heat and let it cool down for about 15 minutes and then put it in a ½ quart salsa jar and set it in the freezer for about 20 minutes. Next, I juiced the lemons and took out SOME of the pulp. And finally I combined the lemon juice and sugar syrup and put it in a pitcher and added the 9 cups of water plus one tray's worth of ice cubes and stirred it up.

Great recipe . Just wanted to share if you only want a large glass and only have a few lemons here is the ingredients  by a third.

1/3 and 1/4 cups white sugar

2 2/3 cups water (just fill a glass with this much water and pull 1/3 and 1/4 cup out of it for the simple sugar)

1/2 cups lemon juice

Nice large lemon you should get about a half a cup.

I modified this a bit because I'm lazy:

Pour two cups of sugar into a gallon jug (I used an empty Hawaiian Punch jug).

Fill the jug about halfway with hot water from the tap, screw on the cap, and shake violently for about a minute.

Uncap, add 2 cups of lemon juice (I used ReaLemon, again because I'm lazy and also I had no lemons) and ice or cold water to fill, then recap and shake again for a bit.

Even using bottled lemon juice, it was surprisingly good. Definitely something to consider next time I'm thirsty, there's nothing in the house, and I'm too lazy/broke to go into town and get something.

Delicious! I only used 1-1/4 cups of sugar as others recommended and it was perfect! Just the right tartness. I've made 2 batches this week, sometimes drinking it "straight", sometimes mixing it with my Tazo Passion tea. Bottom line ~ great lemonade recipe.

I don't like overly sweet so I am glad I read some of the other reviews first before making this recipe.  I followed the advice of a couple reviewers and lower the sugar to 1 1/4 c, which I thought was perfect.  I also recommend following the advice of one reviewer to use the microwave to make the simple syrup; it is so much easier and less clean up.

Delicious but way too sweet. I have a major sweet tooth, but this was too sweet even for me. I'd recommend cutting the sugar by at least 1/4 cup or make it "as is" and keep adding water until it's too your taste.

Very tasty and refreshing.  I also tried adding fresh mint leaves to the lemonade and let the drink absorb their flavor for at least two hours prior to serving.

If you like sweet lemonade, this is it!  It depends on what kinds of lemons you use (Meyer vs. regular lemons), but I would mix the lemon juice + water first, then add half the simple syrup and increase from there.  You'll probably need less syrup, too, if you add fresh fruit to the pitcher as well.  I macerated some strawberries the night before and added about a cup of them to the recipe, so due to all the sweetness in that mix-in, I could use less simple syrup.

Great recipe. 
Tricks: 
You don't need to boil. Sugar dissolves just fine in water. Just mix and wait for it to clarify ( it will dissolve faster in warm tap water.) I make simple syrup daily (which is just sugar and water.) some people swear by the boil but I can't taste the difference.

You can buy lemon juice (not the stuff in the green bottle but like normal juice in quarts) It is 95% as good as fresh. I get mine at a restaurant food supply, but you can find it in normal groceries.

Enjoy!

I guess I will add my 2 cents too.  This was delicious.  I have made my own before, but didn't taste as good as this.  Maybe it's the simple syrup step?  Not sure, but it was so good.  I microwaved my lemons and used a large bbq tong handle to squeeze the juice out.  Made it super easy and almost every drop came out.  Thank you to other reviewers for that suggestion.  : )

Because I don't use artificial sweeteners,but do watch my sugar intake, I made my first batch of this using just 1 cup of sugar.  I think it's perfect!

Best lemonade ever!  I'll be getting a citrus juicer to make this often.  You'll be wondering how you ever drank the powdered stuff.  Easy and naturally good!

Really fresh, just like I LOVE it! I could taste the hard work! A little bit TOO sour, might try adding more sugar or water next time, if I decide to make it for a gathering or something, but still delicious!

Way too strong/syrupy. I'd suggest just using 2/3 the portion of sugar/lemon juice for each portion of water. Filled a gallon jug with 22 servings of the ingredients and 33 servings of the water and THAT made the perfect lemonade.

Too sweet for my family's taste. I like the idea of making the syrup ahead of time, but I used only 1 cup of sugar for the 1 1/2 cups of lemonade. I also only used about 5 cups of additional water.

This recipe of lemonade called fro way too much sugar in my opinion. The lemonade just tasted like sugar with a hint of lemonade. If you are doing this recipe you may consider adding less sugar.

Made this for a wedding reception and tried different ways to make it.  The best we found was to make as written, except use half fresh squeezed lemon juice, and half bottled lemon juice.  This drink was the talk of the reception! I have also made it and froze it in zip lock bags and drank it slushy with fresh or frozen raspberries.

This IS the best lemonade ever!  I used less sugar, and it was still very delicious.  It didn't take 4 hours, even though we juiced the lemons by hand.  It tastes so great, I know I'm going to come back to make more!

Amazing recipe! The only thing I changed was after I boiled the sugar in the water I put it straight in the freezer for about 20-25 minutes until it was cold. Squeezed the lemons in the process of the syrup cooling and it only took about 30 minutes. Not too sweet and not too tart. Thank you for this amazing recipe!

I am rating the recipe as is. To make it to my liking, I had to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. I still used 7 cups of water and 1.5 cups of lemon use. I followed the others suggestions and placed about six large lemons in a bowl of very warm water for 10 minutes before rolling them on the counter and juicing them. It was much easier to juice this way. I love the simple syrup though. It melds the flavors so much better!

I tried this recipe, my lemons were small but I used 8 lemons.  I cut the sugar down to a little under 1 1/2 cups and it was still too sweet for my preference. I used a 2 liter pitcher; I prefer to know I'm drinking lemonade, no sugar water!

Best! Seriously, the best. This was actually the first time I heard about lemonade and decide to try it. This is truly amazing! I got this slushy maker which works amazingly, so I made a lemonade-slushy. Now that's some refreshing juice. Plus, my mom says its very ideal because it's not that unhealthy. Just reduce the sugar a little.

Pretty good recipe. Just basic ingredients and a lot of work for something I can get at a local grocery store that tastes just as good. Fun to make in the summertime. I took other reviewer's advice and heated the lemons in the microwave for 30 seconds or so before juicing and it helped me get a lot more juice with little effort.

Not too bad. I would add less sugar in it way too sweet and I will add half lemon juice and half real squeezed lemon juice next time. Other than that I will make it again with minor fixes.

This recipe was delicious!
I only added 4 cups extra water 'cause it was a little to sweet and lemony.
Will use again in the future.

Very good! I had never made "real" lemonade until I tried this recipe.  I took the advice of other reviews by putting the lemons in the microwave for a few seconds and then rolling on the counter.  Worked great!  Makes juicing the lemons so easy!!  Husband loved it, I made it with half splenda and sugar, turned out great!!! We have several family members that are diabetic so they can enjoy this too.

My grand kids were visiting and we were swimming on a hot southern CA afternoon.  I defrosted lemon juice that I squeezed and froze months ago, mixed the sugar with hot water from the tap, stirred until sugar dissolved, which just took a few swirls, then added the lemon juice...stirred again before adding ice.  Delicious, but sweet.  The kids loved it...I think, I will mix mine with some sparkling water.  A keeper!

Loved it! True to the title of the recipe, it was the best. I added 10 oz of smashed strawberries to make a refreshing strawberry lemonade. I made it this afternoon to have with dinner, and 5 of us (4 adults, and 1 child) almost drank the entire pitcher!

Will definitely make again. Well worth the time to make when you know what's in it.

Great recipe!  Just for variety, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, and threw 3 big strawberries in the blender with some of the lemonade, just to chop the strawberries up, then poured it back into the lemonade.

Wonderful lemonade!  I like mine a little tart, so used only 1 1/4 cups of sugar.  Made the simple syrup in the microwave.

This is easy and delicious.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup because my lemons from the yard are sweeter than the store.  This is always in my fridge during lemon season!  Yummm!

While it is quite sweet, and my boyfriend thought it was too sweet, I enjoyed it. And this recipe can easily be diluted to fit one's taste. I will definitely make again.

This reccipe is alot like another lemonade we had. It was sweet, but  tart, and very yummy! Instead of waiting for the hours for it to be a syrup, I just put it in the freezer for a few minutes, and even as it was hot, the 7 cups of cold water cooled it down. It was delicious, thanks for sharing! :)

Easy recipe and very good lemonade!   I used an old JUICE-KING citrus press which cut down the prep time considerably.    I was a little a concerned about how sweet the lemonade would be.  It tastes great!

This really is delicious; something about making the sugar syrup must really make a difference! I also use this for limeade, and it is great too. I never wait for it to cool, I just put it all together.

This recipe is great! I like a little bit of pulp (not too much!) as it makes lemonade feel more homemade.  I also had some strawberry daiquiri mix that I added to my glass (approx. 2 tbsp. for a tall glass) that made a delicious strawberry lemonade.

Very easy and fast.  I had a little less lemon juice than called for when I got done squeezing my fruit, so I used about 1 cup sugar and 1.25 cups juice.  It is still quite good, and very refreshing!

I poured the sugar/water straight into the pitcher without allowing it to cool first. (I'm too impatient! lol) Instead of adding the remaining 7 cups of water, I put in 6 cups and replaced the last cup of water with two cups of ice to cool it quickly. 
This is truly the best! I usually avoid lemonade at parties and other social gatherings because it's ALWAYS bland, but this lemonade is super sweet! Just the way I like it. =)

Modify the recipe to suit your taste and you'll have a perfect glass of lemonade!  I used 1 cup of sugar and 9-10 cups of water with 7 lemons.  It made it less sweet, which is just the way I like it. It IS the best lemonade ever!

I have an "Orange X" citrus squeezer from Williams-Sonoma that makes quick work of juicing the lemons.  Since I live in FL, I have lemon trees in my yard, so I used my own fresh-picked, organic Meyers lemons for this recipe.  Two lemons gives me 1.5 cups of juice.  I use 3/4 cups Truvia instead of sugar and use a combo of crushed ice from my fridge with filtered water.  I skipped the part about boiling and making the simple syrup. Best lemonade!  For a special, special treat, add a splash of Absolut Limon.

It was a little on the sweet side. I'll cut back on the sugar about half a cup next time. I also used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh. It was still very delicious. I will be serving it at my wedding.

Used this recipe for punch for my Dad's 90th birthday party. I love that Allrecipes has the serving size calculator!  THANK YOU!
We used Crystal Geyser Sparkling Water - lemon and lime in place of plain water to jazz it up!  It was a big hit - especially since the lemons were off of my Dad's lemon tree!  I plan to start canning the lemon juice to have on hand for the future which will make it easier to make when needed or wanted.

I made this lemonade but swapped out white sugar for agave nectar...yummy! I will say that next time I will used light agave nectar as dark gave it a bit of am earthy aftertaste...the hubs didn't like it.

This is a great recipe for lemonade. The only reason I gave it four stars was that it was soooo sweet. It was almost unbearable. But I added extra water until was delicious!!!

AMAZING! I have never written a review until now..because it is that good! I adjusted the serving size to the amount of lemons I had on hand and it was incredible. My whole family loved it. I will be making this for years to come :)

I have always been on the lookout for the crowd pleasing ratio for lemon juice and this is IT! Just realize this does not make an even measurement, its a little over half a gallon.

This is terrific lemonade !!  So much better then frozen cans or bottled. I used 5 lemons and was just shy of the 1 1/2 cups juice needed so I added lemon juice concentrate to make up the rest.  I put my whole lemons into water and let it come to a boil then moved the pan off the heat and let them soak for about 1/2 hour (less time would work). I squeezed the lemons by hand and pulled out all seeds with a ice tea spoon - that was the most time consuming thing. ENJOY!

Great summertime drink--VERY TASTY!  I skipped the boiling part.  I peeled the lemons (about 6 or so) and juiced them in the juicer.  I then added all the ingredients together.  Turned out FANTASTIC!  I'm glad I found this recipe, just in time for our Fourth of July gathering!

Great, simple recipe! I added ice cubes to the syrup mixture and it didn't require any refrigeration before hand. Added in cold water and it was good to go. Remember to roll lemons on counter before so they're extra juicy.

The title says it all. The kids were bugging me to make lemonade from scratch so I made this due to the high ratings. The ratings don't lie. It turned out great! Now all the kids can think about it having a lemonade stand and making some cash out of their new found favorite drink ;)

REFRESHING!  The perfect drink for a hot day!  I sliced two lemons and added them to the finished recipe.  It cut the sweetness a little and was perfect for us.  It was so refreshing!  Thank you Jo for sharing your recipe.

I would have given this 5 stars had it not been so sweet.  I thought 1 3/4 cup sugar was too much.  I will use less as others have suggested next time.  Very good overall though!

This was so good! I read the previous reviews that said it was too sweet, so I decided to add the syrup bit by bit and taste until I had it the way I like it. It didn't require all the syrup for me.

Perfect as is! It does make a lemonade on the sweeter side, but it was by no means too sweet!  I did dissolve the sugar with an equal amount of water in the microwave (1-2 minutes depending on how much sugar you're trying to dissolve) before adding it to the rest of the water/lemon juice. That way it didn't have to sit in the fridge for several hours before we could enjoy!!!  My family has requested that this become a regular fixture in our house and I agree!

I really liked the fresh lemon taste, but felt that this recipe was way too sweet.  Next time, I will try 1.25 cups sugar.  Still yummy, though!

I did do some changes to this lemonade recipe, but it is quite delicious and ideal for those hot summer days.  I did do the simple syrup but reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups.  I only used 5 cups of water and added 1 cup of fresh strawberries that I pureed for strawberry lemonade.

We followed another reviewer's advice and only put in 1-1/4 C of sugar and this was so delicious.  Am waiting for our strawberries to ripen some more to make strawberry lemonade... YUM!

Amazing!!!!  I tried microwaving the halfed lemons to make for easier juicing and it worked great.  I found 30 seconds was perfect and I could hand squeeze the lemons.

VERY good lemonade. I only gave it 4 stars because I felt it was way too sweet. I used 1 1/2 C of sugar and it was syrupy sweet. My second batch I added 1 C. of sugar and about a cup of frozen strawberries (put it in the blender first w/ about a cup of the lemonade) which added a yummy twist. Thank you for sharing the recipe Jo.

This recipe is awesome! It really is the best lemonade ever. I doubled the recipe, using a little less sugar because I like tart lemonade...  3 cups natural cane sugar 16 cups water 3 cups lemon juice (14 lemons)

It was pretty good. I was having a lemonade stand, so I needed to make it quick, so I just mixed everything together. There's a little aftertaste, but it's okay.

Followed the recipe, and I thought it was great. My boyfriend said it was a little sweet for him, so I added a cup of water. Next time I will cut the sugar down a bit and add some strawberries to the glasses. very good recipe!

Heads up: how good this recipe is does strongly depend on your personal taste. I followed it exactly and found it to be a little tart, but I like tart, so I wouldn't change it. My boyfriend on the other hand likes his sweeter, so he would tone it down. Bottom line: if you like it just a little tart, keep it the way it is. If you don't, increase the sugar or cut back the lemons.

GREAT lemonade! Classic and delicious. So easy and quick to make, I don't know why I hadn't ever tried to make from scratch before today!   Like other readers suggested, I used a lot less sugar and it was still quite sweet, so I'm thankful I left out as much as I did.

Even in the middle of December - I get requests to make this at every gathering. Sometimes I do classic lemonade and sometimes I blend up a variety of fruit (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, or mango) with the lemon juice. If I add fruit to the lemon juice in a blender, I lessen the sugar in the simple syrup because the fruit has sugar in it.

Yum!  I used 1 cup bakers sugar (still sweet, but not overpowering).  The bakers sugar is my new favorite (ultra fine makes baking and blender recipes easy!).  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I decreased the sugar to about 3/4's, and I had some people tell me it wasn't sweet enough, and some told me it was too sweet. Still trying to find the happy medium, but I do like the aspect of making a simple syrup to add to the lemonade rather than adding sugar.

Not labor intensive at all if you get your better half to go pick the lemons and then squeeze them for you ;)  Ended up using 2 cups of lemon juice to get it to the tartness I like.  Better half still thought it was still too sweet, but he did find it very refreshing.  This recipe is a keeper.

What a great combination. I made it as directed first and found it too sweet (matter of taste, not recipe). Next time, cut sugar by 1/3. Terrific!

Indeed a great basic lemonade recipe for hot days! I personally used a little less sugar and added a couple of slices of  lime and some fresh mint leaves (it looks great too)and the result was fantastic. Highly recommended. Thanks Jo!

I scaled the recipe just for the 2 of us last week. I saved the hassle of boiling sugar over stove by constant-stirring in a cup of hot water. It was easy and refreshing drink as it had the right combination of sweetness and sourness!! Love it; love it and love it and I'm going to do it again this week... A KEEPER!

We just made this for my son's birthday party and it was a hit.  We doubled the recipe and added a thawed/ pureed container of frozen strawberries.  Made the simple syrup the night before.  Very easy and will make it again.

Delicious.  Perfect summer-time beverage.  Sweet and tart and great over ice.  Worth the effort of juicing the lemons.  This inspired me to go buy a citrus juicer.

Great recipe. I also lowered the amount of sugar to about a cup and a quarter. Six lemons was more than enough for a gallon. Great for the start of summer!

This really is the best lemonade ever! It taste just like the famous hot dog on a stick kind. My husband & I enjoyed making it together and it was perfect as a summer treat...sent the recipe to family & friends too. I added a little ice to the syrup once room temp to speed the process along. I also put the lemon juice, water, and syrup in the freezer to chill. We went from lemons to sipping lemonade in about 45 mins this way.

Yum!  The perfect summertime drink!  It took a lot of lemons and a lot of work since I don't have a juicer but it was sooo worth it.**Made this again and I used bottled lemon juice.  It was almost as good as using real lemons.

I follow another reviewer's advice and microwave the sugar and water for approximately 1 minute in the microwave and cool with ice. I use 1.25 cups of sugar since I like my lemonade tart, and 1.5 cups of a nice bottled lemon juice from Costco. I add water to taste until it's just right.

Hands down the best home made lemonade I have had or made. My boyfriend, who is quite picky when it comes to lemonade, said it should be bottled up and sold! The only changes I made was adding 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 1 3/4 and I also added strawberries to the syrup while it was chilling which gave it a hint of strawberry on day one and it tasted like strawberry lemonade on day 2. Loves it!!

After some tweaking to my taste I got this just right. I would say that the recipe as is really didn't do it for me. I found that it tasted too watered down and not tart enough, and I used about half the amount of sugar. After adding more lemon juice, then a bit of sugar I got the tartness and sweetness just right. Then I added crushed up strawberries, so in the end with the alterations it turned out great!

This was better the longer I refridgerated it...I got too anxious and had my first glass shortly after making it.  Good but not great.  After a couple hours of chilling it was delicious and I couldn't get enough.

I make this every summer with fresh squeezed lemons.  It's easy and refreshing.  Reminds me of lemonade my friend's grandma used to make for us when we were kids.  We picked the lemons from our backyard lemon tree.  Sixty years later, I get my bag of lemons from Costco now.

Followed as directed. However, I like mine a little tart. So, next time I may scale back on the sugar. But, its a great recipe!

This was "okay" but not worth the effort. It took 9 lemons to make this and was still lacking a bit in flavor. Save yourself the time and pick up Minute Maid Lemonade.

I love this recipe.  As some others suggested I put the sugar water mixture in the microwave, instead of the stove, I used about 1 1/4c of sugar.  I used about 8 lemons to make 1 1/2c of lemon juice, which I also had to sqeeze by hand.  This definitely did not take 4 hours to make.   My husband and 3 year old loved it.

This is very nice. I have made lemonade with sugar syrup before and I've found that tasting as you go along is the only measure to get it exactly right for your personal preference, because sometimes lemons are more tart. Because of some of the other reviewers saying it was too sweet, I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I did use the microwave to heat the sugar syrup and added a tray of ice cubes to cool it down quick (in about 3 minutes). I poured the syrup and lemon juice in a jug and poured it into an empty, cleaned 3 Litre juice bottle that we just finished. I then added 8 cups of cold water from the fridge. Again, I shook the bottle at 7 cups of water, tasted, bit too sweet and tartish, so I added another cup of cold water. Perfect. If it is too sweet and you've run out of lemons, try adding more cold water and serve over ice cubes. The tip about letting the lemons sit in warm water for a few minutes really does help with juicing them.

Nice and refreshing.  I like mine a little tart, so cut down the sugar a bit.  A sprig or two of fresh mint gives it a lovely something extra.  Fresh mint leaves and sliced star fruit makes a nice presentation in the caraffe of juice.

This really is the 'best lemonade ever'... Although home made lemonade is only 3 simple ingredients, this is just the right proportions... Sweet and tart, not too watery. My favorite is to use Meyer (sweet) lemons. Also, I've put sliced fresh strawberries with sugar, let sit in frige overnight or longer, then add to lemonade for the 'best strawberry lemonade ever'!

For those of you like me who don't use white sugar, I used 3/4 cup raw sugar and 1/2 cup agave syrup (which is much more sweet than sugar) to the recipe, which made it plenty sweet - so sweet I had to add in about one extra cup of lemon juice!  Unfortunately the brown sweeteners made it mustard-colored lemonade!  Very good though!

Sweet and not too tart!  I was definitely not prepared to make this lemonade, since I had only half a lemon on hand!  I just squeezed the heck out of that half lemon and made up for the rest with that fake lemon juice stuff.  I don't think the flavor was effected much at all.  Next time I will be much more prepared!

It was a little too sugary for my preference so I juiced a few more lemons until it tasted more like lemons and less like sugar water.

I had a birthday party for my 1 year old daughter, both kids and adults, alike, loved the lemonaide. I had to triple the ingredients for a large decanter and it was yummy, indeed. No leftovers except the lemons at the bottom.

Very good! I cut back a little on the sugar (about 1.5 cups) and added an extra cup on water to cut back on the sweetness.

Excellent.  I made for a brunch..I substitued some of the water for seltzer water (not club soda-it has a different taste)-substitute how much water for the seltzer whether you use by the can (about 2 cans) or by the bottle (1).  It gives it a little fizz.  Put in some strawberries if desired.  If you dont use the whole thing thats ok the seltzer changes into the water.   Great for potlucks or brunch.

This is great lemonade.  I used bottled lemon juice and only 1 cup of sugar.  I might try and cut the sugar down and suppliment with agave next time.

This really is the best. The sugar/juice/water ratio is perfect. Also leaving the pulp in there is what makes this so good.

Good Lemonaide, I thought it was good. But alot of work for the flavor. I personally have had better. My guest however loved it and it did not last long. I will make again. But maybe instead of squeezing fresh lemons which took forever. I will use premade lemonaide and and following ingredients.

Perfect recipe! I cut it in half because my pitcher wasn't big enough for all that liquid. I did use a tiny bit less sugar and 5 lemons to get enough juice for half the recipe. It's so worth the work to squeeze those lemons..if you don't have a plastic citrus juicer that catches the seeds and extra pulp you must get one before trying this recipe. Soaked the lemons in hot water and rolled them on the counter before juicing. It didn't take 4 hours to make this recipe..I just poured in cold water and a handful of ice cubes and I was good to go. Also used several fresh mint leaves, bruised them to bring out the minty flavor before adding to individual glasses of lemonade. Cool and refreshing on a hot Florida summer day!

I am giving this 4 stars b/c I did not pay attention to the directions.  I was really in the mood for lemonade all of a sudden.  I used bottled lemon juice and mixed all ingredients together in a Pampered Chef Quick Stir pitcher.  I did not boil the water and the sugar.  The sugar dissolved quickly in the Pampered Chef pitcher.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I liked the blend of lemon and sugar on this recipe but overall it was too strong for me.  I ended up adding more water than what was called for. This lemonade reminded me of the lemonade from the local carnivals. It was just what I had been craving.

Just delicious!  It's a bit sweet for my taste but that's nothing that can't be easily adjusted.  The lemoni-ness (is that a word) is PERFECT!  It's so easy to make and it didn't take even close to 4 hours to cool the sugar syrup.

Delicious.  Everything lemonade should be.  Followed some others suggestions and soaked the lemons in hot water for 10 minutes before squeezing and this softened them up a lot--made squeezing much easier.  1 3/4 cups of sugar is the perfect amount, not overly sweet at all.  You could get away with a little less, but why would you want to?  This is a treat!

I cheated and used lemon juice concentrate.  I'm sure it's much better with freshly squeezed lemons.  Don't know if it was because I used the concentrate or the pan I cooked the syrup in but it seems to have a wee bit of a metallic taste.

I used 1 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice and 1/2 cup of lime juice. I used Splenda instead of sugar and added about 2 tablespoons of cherry juice when I mixed everything together. It was very sweet so I added another cup of water to cut down the sweetness. Very refreshing!

It truly is the best lemonade!  You can also use this to make orangeade as well!!!  Just make the sugar water as stated in the recipe (although, I don't bring it to a boil, sugar dissolves in cold water too) and I add fresh squeezed orange juice (OJ from a carton doesn't taste the same) to each individual glass.  1/2 orange for 1 cup of sugar water then I add a couple of maraschino cherries and  some of its juice for color.  AMAZING!!

This is so good and refreshing! A friend gave me a box of lemons from her uncle's tree and I juiced the lemons by hand, freezing the leftover for future use.  I made a mistake and strained the pulp from the juice.  But even w/ that error, the lemonade was still excellent, so it would have been even better w/ the pulp.

Loved the lemonade! I think boiling the sugar with the water is what really helps. Usually when you make lemonade it has that gritty taste because of the sugar. A little   sweet for me so I added a little more lemon juice because I like my lemonade tangy. I will probably use slightly less sugar next time. Definitely  a keeper!

Great recipe. It also works well with Lemon juice from concentrate.

I've even made it with 1c of lemon juice (from concentrate) and 1/2c of lime juice (from concentrate).

My husband loved it...I used slightly less sugar and had to supplement with some lemon juice as I used a whole bag of lemons and there still wasn't enough juice...This would probably work better with an actual juicer rather then doing it by hand...Very good though!!!

"This IS the best lemonade ever! Two thumbs up!", says the 5 year old! 
It was fun and easy to make and super tasty!
We used a juicer to juice the lemons (we used 8 lemons to get 1 1/2 cups of juice) and then used a sieve to strain the pulp.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Perfect!! I was looking for a lemonade that was light, perfect for a summer day, and not too sweet.  This was it.  The only thing I changed was reducing the sugar to only 1 cup, my family liked it although its all personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

Instead of boiling the lemons, you can also put them in the microwave for 30-40 seconds to release more juice.  They should be stored at room temp rather than in the fridge, too.  

A citrus press is awesome for juicing lemons, limes and small oranges ~~ much like a garlic press but larger and gets every bit of juice out of the lemon!

Delicious and for a twist add a few sprigs of rosemary to the simple syrup mixture and let simmer about 15 minutes, remove the sprigs and add a nectar (peach, mango, etc) to the lemon juice.

Re my August 13 review.  I actually used 12 lemons rather than 10 . . . but they must have been whoppers because I made up another batch today and it took all 8 lemons to make the recipe.  After softening the lemons, I made a slit and then squeezed out most of the juice.  Otherwise I found much of the juice ended up on my cutting board.  This really is yummy lemonade.

I made this for my brother's birthday party.  Everyone loved it.  It was easy to make.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Will make again.  I actually used frozen lemon juice sold under the Minute Maid brand which I found in the "frozen foods" aisle beside the fruit concentrate juices.  I just let them thaw out and measured it out.  I needed two containers of it.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  Will be making it again!!!

Great recipe. My guest liked it, and my husband said it's good. I changed it a little bit. I ran out of lemons, so I just had 1 cup. As for the water, I'm not sure How much I used. Maybe five cups plus one with sugar. Next time I'll try to do it as written. thanks!

Making the sugar water on the stove is an easy and ingenious step.  However, I have to agree with other reviewers, too sweet, I had to juice three extra lemons to balance it out to the sweet tart flavor I was hoping for.  This lemonade is better than the stuff at HOT DOG ON A STICK.

Great tasting lemonade. I used half the sugar, and I still thought it was a little too sweet.

Mmm Yummy and Refreshing!
I followed the recipe except for 2 things: I put the 1 cup of water and all the sugar in the microwave until dissolved and I didn't have enough lemons to make the full 1 1/2 cup of lemon juice, so I used some bottled lemon juice as well.
Very good, thank you for sharing!

Upon drinking this, my son pronouned it the "best lemonade ever," so I'd have to say it is quite aptly named. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 c and reduced the water to 6 cups and ended up with a  perfectly sweet-tart lemonade. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Reduced sugar 1/4 cup to equal lemon juice.  Results...Perfection!  Thanks for sharing. I made this as a special Valentine's Day treat for my 3 year old who loves lemonade.  Never has she had the real thing though.  She loved it. :-)

This is the recipe I have been looking for!  I first used this recipe in 1977 during 7th grade Home Ec. class,  and it was a favorite until I lost it during a move.  Thanks for posting this--it's wonderful!

I've served this to friends and neighbors and they can't believe how delicious this is.  Tried adding a splash of pomegranite juice and WOW!  That's how I make it now.  When it's martini time, I just add Vodka.

Mmmmm,this is so good and refreshing. I used a little more than a cup of sugar and threw some frozen strawberries b/c I ran out of ice cubes,and left a few slices of lemon in a pitcher. This came out so good I had to go out and get a juicer to make this again. My little one said "mommy, this really is the best lemonade ever".

I just made this lemonade!  I have never made lemonade before and I have to say this is really good!  We are having a BBQ for Memorial Day weekend and I did a test run.  I will be making this again on Sunday!  I might use Equal next time to cut down on calories.  VERY YUMMY!

This never fails to please everybody! Even my mother was impressed, and she's  selective with her praise. You can adjust the proportions of ingredients so that it's as sweet or tart as you like it.

This was sooo much better than concentrate lemonade I buy, it's worth the extra effort. My pitcher actually couldn't hold the last 1/1.5 cups or so of water, but that just made taste even more lemony! I can't say I'll never make concentrate lemonade again, but anytime I'm craving some great scratch lemonade this will be the recipe I reach for. Thanks so much!

This does taste like carnival lemonade.  I wasn't relly sure what the point of boiling the water and the sugar was, but I did it any way.  I used 4 lemons and made two quarts of lemonade and it turned out perfect.  I am having a housewarming party in August and I am going to use this recipe for some "Spiced" lemonade.  I will add some vodka and strawberries and I am sure that this will be delicious!

Very easy to make, and very sweet, which is why I am giving it four stars and not five.  I will most definitely make this recipe again however, I will either add more water or drop the amount of sugar it calls for.

The recipe lives up to its name.  I use 1 cup of store bought lemon juice (ReaLemon from Costco) and 1 1/3 cups of sugar for the "perfect" balance of sour and sweet. We go thru this stuff so fast, I make it every couple of days.

This is a very good lemonade recipe, but not the best I've ever made. I made two lemonade recipes today, and I liked the other one (ginger lemonade from this site) better, but this is tasty. I decreased the sugar by about 1/4 cup and it was still a little too sweet for my tastes. My dinner guests really liked it and drank it up very fast. Very refreshing with our heavy Easter dinner.

This was really good, but there was way too much sugar.  I had to add an extra cup of lemon juice to reduce the sweetness.  But, other than that, it was really good.

We recently bought a house that has a lemon tree.  My boys picked some and have been begging for lemonade.  I used 1 1/2 cups sugar,  1 3/4 cup juice, and about 7 1/2 cups water.  I strained the juice because my kids won't drink pulp.  I did not boil the sugar, I used superfine sugar and it melted quickly.  It made this recipe very easy and quick.

It was a hit with my kids and I really liked it too!

Picked fresh lemons and made this recipe.  The best lemonade I ever made.  The fresher the lemons the better.  Held back on the sugar.

This really is the best lemonade I have ever had!  Most homemade ends up tasting too sweet or too sour to me.....this is just perfect.  Not too watery either.  I didn't add quite as much sugar as listed but pretty close.  I put in the lemon juice, water, and 1 1/3 cups sugar and just adjusted to taste from there.  Also, I didn't heat it and do the syrup....just mixed cold and it turned out great.

I cut back on the sugar to just 1 cup and it came out perfect.  I expect my lemonade to be a little tart and there was still plenty of sweetness even after trimming way back on the sugar.

I was using tree ripened Meyer lemons, so reduced the sugar a bit. 

Thanks Jo, this was very refreshing indeed. Even more so, with a shot of good gin in a tall glass with ice.

This tasted amazing! I used the bottled ReàLemon juice instead of juicing the lemons myself and I also put it in the freezer instead of the fridge so it would cool faster (don’t forget to take it out before it freezes though!)

This took me a dozen small lemons to get 1.5 cups of juice. I hope that piece of info can help others judge how many lemons to buy. I only used 1 & 1/3 C. Sugar as well. Once I tasted it, I decided to add more water as it tasted a bit thick to me with just 8 cups of water. I can only imagine how syrupy it would have been adding all the sugar it suggested. All in all: 1.5 cups of lemon juice, 1 & 1/3 C. sugar, and about 10 - 11 cups of water. I highly suggest adding your sweetener slowly and tasting as you go.

Used 1 1/4  cup sugar, poured it into water bottles and let it sit in freezer over nite. The next morning myself, my wife and daughter had a hike planned after about 10 miles and them staying hydrated with water I gave them that ice cold fresh squeezed lemonade they had no idea about. They loved it, glad i went with less sugar.

I really didn’t feel like making the syrup so I used the Simple syrup I had in my bar.  Worked perfectly.  I used the entire 12oz bottle.  Delicious.

Seriously the best!! We have used this for lemonade stands over the years, and it’s been a absolutely perfect every time. We double it every time and it’s the perfect amount for the stand. We always run out though because it’s so popular! The extra work is really worth it. Thank you for this recipe.

Made a double batch with 2 fresh squeezed lemons and the rest juice. Very smooth and very sweet/sour. Got as much pulp in it as possible.

Just awful, much too sweet. I must’ve diluted it by at least a third and I added a bit less sugar to begin with. 
Good recipe if you’re making some kind of lemonade concentrate.

My wife and kids liked this recipe very well. We like to add tequila to the recipe for the adults. It makes a great adult beverage after the kids go to bed.

I haven't made lemonade in years.  Well, it's 102 degrees today, and since it is too HOT for outside, and I had a bag of lemons, why not make lemonade!  There is no question it is worth taking the extra step to make the simple syrup.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2, used 8 lemons (small to medium in size) and approx. 8 cups of water.  I added some ice to the syrup to cool it, which probably made more than 8 cups of water.  I used my old fashioned Juice-O-Matic to juice the lemons.  I gave it 4 stars because it was still too sweet with 1 1/2 cups sugar.  Next time I intend to try it with 1 cup of sugar.  Very refreshing (especially with a little vodka and a mint sprig!)!

Ok so after making lemonade, HOMEMADE lemonade for the first time in my life today, (I’ve made it before but with bottled lemon juice which is always from concentrate) I will never ever look at other lemonades the same. This has got to be the best lemonade over ever had in my life. Simple ingredients and simple to make. BOO-YA!

Turned out great even with my cheats. I used lemon juice concentrate. Tastes the same. 

*This recipe has a ton of sugar. I used only a 1/2 cup  and it’s nice and tart with a little sweetness.*

It is wonderful! But, I guess I don't need as much sugar as the next person. I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar and it tasted great to me.

Absolutely perfect. I have 3 kids in the house who love lemonade and 1 who thinks it's sort of okay sometimes... I just made this and had to modify it just a smidge because I didn't end up with enough lemon juice after juicing several lemons (I think I had 6-7 lemons). So I reduced the sugar a bit and had the kids taste it. They all LOVED it, even my child who is not usually a big fan of lemonade. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you!! :)

I added some salt and a bit more lemon juice because it seemed a little too sweet, but other than that, it was great, and I would totally make it again.

Summer delight! I used  6 extra large lemons HUGE lemons fresh off a California tree to get 1.5 cups of lemon juice so if you are buying average sized supermarket lemons you'll need at least 12. I found it easier to increase (or decrease) the amount of water recommended in this recipe instead of playing around with the lemons and sugar amounts.  Very good recipe. This is a keeper!

This recipe is too sweet. I was looking forward to enjoying a glass of fresh squeezed lemonade, but I could barely finish my first glass because it was over the top sweet. If I made this again I would seriously cut back on the amount of sugar.

Awesome! I didn't have any lemons on hand, this is why I substituted the lemons with some limes, about 1 cup lime juice plus the pulp. I also am rather on the opposite side of sweetness, I wouldn't want the recipe to be too sweet. This is why I only used about 1 1/4 cups of white sugar. 
In the end, a great recipe. I also liked the idea of keeping the pulp, it makes it even more awesome!

OMG - this is like liquid lemon crack, it is so good. I’m not a huge fan of lemonade, but I have a 5 year old with high entrepreneurial hopes of a successful lemonade stand this summer, so we made a batch to test it out. 

This stuff is too good to sell. I’m keeping it for myself. She can sell some Countrytime or Crystal Light while I sit back and drink this liquid gold.

Really delicious, I added the water and lemon juice together and then added the simple syrup last so I could sweeten it to taste. (Didn’t end up using all of the simple syrup as it would’ve been too sweet for my taste.)

This is one of the best recipes for lemonade.  I added fresh blended strawberries. And at the end a fresh spring of mint.
Yum.

Excellent!  This will be my go-to lemonade recipe.  This was my first time making lemonade with simple syrup, as I usually make it with Truvia (Stevia sweetener) but wanted to make something special for my hubby on this hot summer day.  I followed the recipe to a T other than adding ice cubes to quickly cool down the simple syrup.  It took 6 lemons to yield exactly 1-1/2 cups of lemon juice.  In addition to the ice I had added to cool down the syrup, I added the full 8 cups of water and also some more ice in each glass.  My hubby likes things extra sweet, so I added a few packets of Truvia to the full pitcher, but it's great as is and this is a 5-star recipe as is.

This is clearly the best lemonade ever. The second I brought it out everyone fainted. There was screams of delight. There was a whole world war because everyone was trying to get the last of the lemonade. It fixed all my relationships. All my exes came running back. My goat died of excitement. I couldnt thank you enough for this lemonade recipe . (but you owe me a new goat)

This is a great and simple recipe that I made for our Memorial Day grill out!
This made about 3 quarts or so. I used eight lemons to make 1 3/4 cups of juice to make a bit more lemonade. The sugar was easy enough to microwave and the whole process was done in about 30 minutes. I cut back a little on the sugar and it turned it delicious!

Just kind of made this lemonade on a whim, I've never made lemonade before! I was short on lemons, so I substituted with some sour green apples and an orange. I also didn't use as much sugar, but the end result was amazing anyway. This recipe has a lot of room to play around and make due with what you have. Best lemonade ever isn't kidding either!

When I made this for the first time we wanted more! Not too sweet, and easily adapted to specific tastes. My ten year old  keeps expirimenting with this recipe.  This is our go to lemonade recipe. Always a hit at Lemonade stands, sells out consistently!

This is sooooooo good. I buy a bag of lemons every week, just so we can make this lemonade. We do make a minor change adding less sugar and chopping up some fresh mint leaves.

I took a few shortcuts, but the lemonade was still delicious. I took 3 cups of ice, put it in the pitcher, then added 3 cups of water and lemon juice concentrate. After making the syrup, I allowed it to come to ~100F then added it to the mixture.  I will probably reduce the sugar by a 1/4 cup next time.

Excellent! I only used 1 and 1/2cups sugar, as I prefer mine more tart than sweet. I also cut the lemons in half then grilled them to make the juice easier to squeeze out and to add depth of flavor.

Best lemonade. I’ve made this with regular sugar and various sugar subs and always came out great. I add about 1 cup more lemon juice and a total of 10 cups of water and it’s perfect for us.

My rule of thumb is to try a recipe exactly as written once. Then if I choose to make it again, make adjustments to it. This was made with fresh lemons of off a tree in Arizona. BEST lemonade I ever had! When I make it again, I might add some lime,  strawberries, or cherries if I have some available. I did follow some suggestions from other reviews.... heating the lemons in the microwave for 30 seconds, rolling lemons on counter ( I usually do), and heating the sugar/water in the microwave. Thank you for posting those suggestions!
***Great Recipe***

My family and I really enjoyed this. I reduce the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and it is still too sweet. I will reduce it down to 1 1/4 cups of sugar next time.

Great recipe! I used bottled lemon juice but it came out perfect! I didn't chill my syrup. I took out half the water and replaced with ice to chill everything faster.

1/14/19- I made this again.  This time used 1 3/4 cups lemon juice and 1.5 cups sugar.  It was perfect!

It's very tasty!!  A little on the sweet side.  If you like Lemonade a little more tart, you may want to add slightly less sugar and a little more lemon juice.

Too sweet! I thought it was an excessive amount of sugar, but I tasted to make sure. It was!!! So, I doubled the water and added another healthy squeeze of lemon juice into it and it was perfect!

This was both sweet and tart. The lemons at the market were large and I used five using my citrus squeezer. Did not take long and I made it with my three year old. He picked out the seeds and slightly squeezed.

I made this with only one cup of sugar and almost two cups of lemon juice that I had left over from a recent batch of  limoncello. It was sweet enough for me with enough tartness to know you're drinking lemonade, not some sweet store bought stuff.

You got my husband hooked on fresh lemonade. It reminds me of lemonade my mom made with me when I was a child. My father in law loves it too! Better than country time he said. Hes never had it fresh like this. We stick to the recipe, I add some lemon peel only the yellow no butter white peel to the simple syrup and we add strawberry monin for a kick sometimes. Its excellent  lemonade and we have been spending a ton of money on lemons or have it on hand all the time.

My boss gave me a huge bag of lemons from her dad's tree and this recipe was just what I needed! I had SO MUCH LEMON JUICE. I made enough mix to have a gallon fresh and I froze 3 more packages for later! I didn't adjust this recipe at all. Didn't need to. It's just right!

Really good - suggest adding the simple syrup slowly and tasting. This recipe is ridiculously sweet for our taste (but to each their own).

I usually use about 5/4 sugar instead of the full 7/4.

We used this recipe for my kids homemade lemonade stand! It was tasty and great on a hot summer evening! Everyone loved it!!! Made 5 batches worth!! Lots of lemons needed about 40–45 as we had smaller lemons. We microwaved the lemons 10-11 seconds each, rolled them, then juiced them. We made the sugar water ahead of time and only mixed everything when we were ready to open our stand so it stayed cold.

This came out great. I have a lemon squeezer, but the lemon squeezing was still labor intensive. I may opt for lemon juice instead of fresh squeezed next time.

It was good, my kids liked it however, it was too sweet for me.  Despite that I'll definitely make it again but next time I'll try it out using 1 1/4 cups of sugar instead of the 1 3/4 cups.

The title is correct. The family raved about it, I cut down the sugar by half a cup, and the flavor was precise. This is my new and only lemonade recipe.

I made it once with the 2/3 the amount of recommended sugar and instantly poured it down the drain. It was still way too sweet and was not refreshing at all on a hot summer day. I made it again with half the sugar and was pleased.

Delicious! So  much better than store bought lemonade. I used less sugar since I don't like it too sweet. 1 3/4 cups  is too much in my opinion.

I'm sitting here enjoying this as I type.  I cut down to one and a half cups sugar and half cup more lemon, added the peel of one grated lemon and used six cups of water and two cups of ice, so I didn't have to wait for it to cool all the way down.  Added a few lemon slices to my drink and garnished with basil.  Yummy!

This recipe is can be found made in my refrigerator  pretty much everyday in the summer in my house. During the holiday also I put it in the punch bowl with lemon and lime slices along with a frozen mold of it. I also use it to make home made ice pops. I love the fact that its just sugar and real lemon!!  It really is the  Best Lemonade Ever! Thanks for sharing!

I loved the idea of making simple syrup instead of trying to dissolve the sugar in the cold mixture. Like others have said, the amount of sugar called for in the recipe is too much. I followed the recipe (added a few extra lemons because that's the way I like it) but was able to make two batches with the amount of simple syrup I had.  Which I was thankful for because the first pitcher was gone within what seemed like minutes! We are pretty much obsessed with homemade lemonade in this house now!

The only change I made was I mixed the lemon juice with 8 cups of water then added the simple syrup until I liked the taste. I prefer a tart lemonade.

This is what I've been looking for so many years.  A recipe for lemonade just like my Grandma used to make - not too sour not too sweet (although, I did cut down a little on the sugar).  Brings back great memories. Thank you!!

This lemonade is outstanding. Now I don’t have to buy it at the store. I only made one change , I used bottled lemon juice instead of squeezing juice from actual lemons. Also I didn’t boil before  I mixed the ingredients . Great recipe!

I didn't bother heating anything, just stirred a little longer. Also put in slightly less sugar (to taste).  Otherwise, this is a great starting point to get the right proportions.

I only had enough lemons for 1 cup of lemon juice so I used 5-2/3 cups of water and 1-1/4 cup of sugar. I just used room temperature bottled water and mixed the sugar then the lemon juice. It was delicious

This lemonade really is perfect. It was a little on the sweet side but we liked it. I believe next time I will add some strawberries. My kids like me to keep lemonade and sweet tea on hand so they can make Arnold Palmers so this made them very happy. UPDATE: I was in a pinch one day and only had 2 lemons and 2 limes and a bottle of Minute Maid concentrated lemon juice. I used the juice of 1 lemon and 1 lime mixed with the concentrated lemon juice instead of all fresh and it came out excellent! I used the extra lemon and lime sliced to throw in the pitcher just to make it pretty. I will definitely be using this quick option again!

Absolutely perfect!!!! I didn’t need to add any sugar and it was the epitome of Southern Lemonade! What I like to do is cut up some fresh strawberries and add them to the glasses, then pour the lemonade in. It then becomes the perfect strawberry lemonade. I wouldn’t add any to the pitcher unless you plan on it being gone that day. Strawberries overtime in lemonade doesn’t take good to me.

I didn’t have fresh lemons so I used the liquid lemon juice bottles I get from Costco. Worked great. The bottles come in 2 packs and I can make appx 6 gallons of lemonade!!! Well worth the price and mixed great with homemade unsweetened black tea. The other thing I did was I make batches of simple syrup in mason jars and keep them in my fridge (for tea) so I just boiled water and added equal parts water and sugar to a mason jar and shook it maybe 10 times till it was dissolved then tossed it in the fridge to cool. It’s nice to have it in liquid form in the fridge since I hate granulated sugar chunks in my tea. This recipe makes it so I can have a cheap bulk drink for my kids.

I made this for my daughters graduation party in July and everyone loved it. I had to mix up a second batch part way through the event, and I started with a triple recipe of it. Now this is the only lemonade my girls want.

This was good, but a little too sweet. I added one more lemon which made it perfect. Oh, and I didn't read the directions before I made it (was looking pretty much just for measurements) and just mixed it all together - no cooking - and it turned out great!

I have made it exactly as the recipe says - YUM!  I have also substituted Stevia and that's YUM too.  As a variation I have added mashed fruit such as strawberries or blueberries.

This turned out delicious! I heated did sugar and water in the microwave instead of using the stove top and it worked great. I also added 2 cups of fresh strawberries to make a strawberry lemonade. I will definitely make this again. It's a great refreshing summer drink!

WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR!
This recipe would be fine if you decrease the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cups... the recipe as written tastes like sugar water...the overwhelming sweetness overpowers all taste of lemons.  Might as well drink kool-aid or some other artificial  lenonade drink.

This was excellent.  I used pre-squeezed lemon juice, boiled the syrup in the microwave, and I think I added an extra cup of water.  It was a great balance of sweet and sour, and got many compliments at my daughter's lemonade stand.  I was certain I would use less than the called for amount of syrup, but it ended up the recipe was perfect.

Probably the best lemonade ever!  My son is a diabetic so I used Splenda when I made the simple syrup. It wasn't overly sweet & had a slight sour taste. Overall, it's a great drink & well worth the effort!

So good! I added strawberries afterwards to make strawberry lemonade! I also boiled 2 cups of water instead of 1 so the sugar could desolve better. I used only 1 cup of sugar too.

This is a great recipe and I think the key is boiling the sugar to make the simple syrup. However, it was a little sweet for my liking, so I will use less sugar next time. Overall, a simple and tasty lemonade recipe.

Trick for the lemons is to heat them in the microwave for less than a minute before squeezing.  I only needed 3 lemons for a half-batch.  Yum! Refreshing.

Caution! This recipe does not make 20 servings!  You end up with about 80 oz of lemonade. That's 4 oz per serving. Pulp is good, but it's still a bit too sweet for my taste. And a lot of work even with a juicer.

It was 95 degrees here and I made this in less time than it says. It took me 1 & 1/2 hours to make it and it sure did its job in this heat. Quench my thirst and I have to say it's the best lemonade I've ever had in my life. My father was a lemonade connoisseur and he would have loved this over anything he'd ever had in his life also. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

If you don't want an incredibly sweet drink, I recommend looking elsewhere. I increased the water by two cups and it was still overwhelmingly sweet.

This is a great recipe I would not change a thing about it, however, to get the maximum amount of juice out of the lemons, it is wise to roll the lemons on the cutting board until soft ,as one reviewer has already stated . Also it will take about 12 to 15 lemons depending on the size lemons you use, even with rolling or soaking in hot water.

This recipe is a keeper! My son really wanted to make Raspberry lemonade out of the berries he picked off our bush and  the lemons I purchased for this purpose, I was delighted to find this recipe. It's a great recipe as it is, and great with pureed berries.  We mushed a cup of fresh picked  raspberries and added it. So Tasty. I agree with the title "Best Lemonade Ever" Thank you for the recipe! (I'd give it 5 hearts as well) I've made it several times giving my kids a Ziploc bag of berries to mush for me, perfect for their "tea" parties.

I did not have fresh lemons and pulp available, so used bottled Lemon Juice. I'm sure fresh lemons would be better but it was still very good.

I used 1 1/2 cups sugar stirred in 1 cup water and microwaved 2 minutes. I let the syrup cool and added the 1 1/2 cup lemon juice and stored in a glass jar. I love to use this as concentrate- about 50-50 ratio with water, or adding to plain iced tea.
I gave it a four because I also felt the recipe was much too sweet. The next time I will use 1 1/4 cups sugar, which is a half cup less than the recipe.

This recipe is heavenly! I enjoyed making it, but  if you want to make this in 20 minutes not 4 hours, make the syrup, and chill in the freezer for 5 minutes. Then fill a pitcher with ice cubes, and add water & lemon juice, and syrup to the pitcher. Mix together.  I did this and it was incredibly sour.  I love sweet lemonade, so I added another 3/4 of sugar, but if you are the sour  lemonade type, keep as is.

Up here in Canada all lemons are imported and somewhat expensive.  It's awsome and really hits the spot for summertime thirst but it's expensive, and labour intensive unless you have a power squeezer.  You pretty well need a 2 kg beg of lemons to get nearly a liter of lemon juice.

I used less sugar, and I could still cut back more. I cheated and used bottled lemon juice but added real lemon too. It's a good recipe you can tweak to your preference. I need a bigger juice jug or I'll have to make 1/2 a batch next time

Wayyyy too sweet as is. Next time I'll start with half the sugar. I also added an extra  ~1/3 cup of lemon juice because I like  my lemonade strong and tangy.

I have been wanting to experiment with a Lemonade recipe to try and find what my Grandmother used to make when I was a kid (60 years ago).  This comes pretty close.  When I make this again, I will cut back the sugar to 1.5 cups instead of the 1.75.  It was just a bit sweet.  It took me 6 medium size lemons to yield the 1.5 cups of juice.  I use the attachment on my KitchenAid mixer, so that part is a easier.  The lemons were 57 cents each at the store, so a pitcher of lemonade was 3.42.  I will watch when I can get a better deal on lemons.  Then do the squeeze and cook the syrup and freeze them.  Doing the hard(er) steps when I have time will make a pitcher of great lemonade when I want it or when somebody stops by a snap.

Refreshing and simple. I like knowing what is going into my food and drinks. The one thing I did do differently is 1 cup sugar, I like my lemonade to have a pucker effect. Will definitely be making this again!

My wife and I loved it! We found it too sweet though, so I used less sugar. As an extra, I put 10 or 15 fresh mint leaves in a blender full of this lemonade and mixed it up good. It was amazing! (I was copying a drink we had in Israel called "Lemonada")

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I have always bought the powder out of pure convenience...NOT ANYMORE! My daughter came across this recipe and decided she wanted to use it for her "Lemonade Stand" :) This lemonade definitely rates 5 stars across the board. Thank you for sharing!! Happy Summer:)

Great recipe. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and put cold water after desolving the sugar. That way can drink it right away! :)

Loved it but admit I used 1 1/4 C sugar because we like our lemonade with a bit of tart.  Will become a summer staple.

Great recipe however, I only used 3/4 cup of sugar the first time I made it and it was sweet enough for me and my son.  My husband wanted it a bit sweeter so he added an additional 1/2 teaspoon to his.  The next time I made it, I used 1 cup of sugar and it was a bit too sweet.  I can't imagine using 1 3/4 cups......that would be way too sweet!!!

I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and still found it was too sweet. I added 4 additional cups of water and a few more lemons.

I doubled the recipe, and added some lemon zest to the simple syrup.  Beautiful and refreshing.  Can't wait to try this recipe again with less sugar and add cayenne pepper!

**also with doubled recipe used 14 cups water instead of 16

REALLY delicious! I did add a navel orange and it tastes amazing. Easy to make and for so little. Makes a large pitcher of 8 quartz, 1 Gallon if it's too sweet or tart that you add mpre than 8 c of water.

My daughter and i made this today, but modified the recipe to approximately 1/2. 1 cup water + 1/2 cup white sugar, microwave 1 1/2 minutes and put in fridge while juicing 7 medium size lemons. Mixed 3 1/2 cups water plus simple syrup and refrigerated. After sampling of course??.  For the adults, add 1 jigger grey goose per serving. ??

This is definitely a "to taste" recipe. I used the exact recipe but ended up adding more lemon juice (half a cup or so) because it was sweeter than we liked.

Used 1 1/2 Cups of sugar as reviews said it was quite sweet and was good but a bit watered down for our taste, could have been because of strength of lemons though.

This is excellent Lemonade.   I sliced my lemons and use my Juicer and I get so much lemon juice plus it shaves off the outside of the lemons, which makes the lemonade absolutely delicious...

Love it! Such a simple, healthy recipe! Yes, even with sugar, it beats all the fake "powdery" lemonade mixes in cans, which are loaded with dyes and additives or the ones labeled as lemonade in the juice or soda section. It took less than 8 lemons and I bought a few extra to slice as a garnish. The whole family loved it and this will definitely be a great drink coming up this summer. Note: It is a bit on the sweet side but I really don't mind this, I can add a bit of water to it or just cut back on the sugar. I prefer using the recipe, as is, and adding water to the cup if someone wants it more diluted. ????

Definitely halve the amount of sugar and it is perfect!   Add more after that to your taste.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe but used less sugar than called for based on reviews. I was a few ounces short in lemon juice so I used a few key limes.  Added ice to the water to speed up the process.  Made this for the Super Bowl but I don't think there will be any left when the game starts.

We were gifted with about 40 lbs. of lemons.  We gave away about 30 lbs.  What to do with the rest of these beauties?  My husband loves lemonade and I found this recipe.  I don't have a juicer, so I hand squeezed the lemons to make the 1 and a half cups of juice.  I took Naples' advice and only used 1 &  1/4 cup of sugar, PERFECT!  Hubs rated this 4 stars because there wasn't any pulp, my fault because they were hand-squeezed over a colander to catch the seeds.  I'll be making another pitcher very soon.  Delicious and refreshing, thank you for the recipe!

I made this with 1.5 cups of sugar, 0.5 cup less than it calls, and it is still way too sweet. Next time I'll try 1 cup. Otherwise, it's a good recipe.

Toss in a whipping siphon with Co2 for easy sparkling lemonade. Or just use some soda water. Nice little twist on an already southern staple.

I have a ponderosa lemon tree. Ponderosa lemons are a bit bitter compared to they Meyer lemon I typically get in store. Normally this would be too much sugar for me, BUT it was perfect for my home grown lemons ??

I was craving some real lemonade, not the powdery stuff. I found this recipe today, and made it according to the instructions. I have to say, the 8 cups are almost gone. It's just perfect. Its a perfect balance of sweet, sour and tangy. Now, all I need is a juicer. Amazing, thank you!

Very good. It is definitely sweet, but I like it. If you don't like it too sweet, add half the simple syrup, taste it and add more until it's just right. If you wind up with leftover syrup, save it for cocktails or even coffee. If you've already made it, add more lemon juice to cut back on the sweetness. 


                     I made it twice. The first time, I followed it exactly. The second time, I mixed the water and lemon juice, stirred it a little, added the piping hot simple syrup and stirred well. The lemonade was warm, but it cooled in the fridge. It tasted the same and was s little easier and took less time overall.

I just made this and it was amazing.  As a diabetic, I made one change, and that was substituting the sugar for one cu[ of blue agave.  I also ran out of lemons at a little over one cup and used limes to finish up.

When I made the recipe, I originally cut down the sugar to 1.5 cups of sugar and it was still too sweet. I ended up adding 1.5 cup more of water and 1 extra cup of lemon juice, which toned down the sweet, but still came out good.

I used the recipe as a guide but made a few adjustments. I use the bottled "Real Lemon Juice". Use a gallon jug and fill remaining space with water (after the 8 cups it calls for), to counter all the sugar the recipe calls for. Tastes just like the Lemon Shakeups at the fair!! Enjoy!!

It was sweet and had the just right amount of lemon juice and sugar. Once I started drinking it I couldn't stop. This will definitely be a drink that I will make hundreds of time in my lifetime.

I had never made lemonade from scratch before until I tried this recipe. I fallowed it to the letter and it is soooo much better than the powdered stuff. I mean it really doesn't taste anything like it - and that's a good thing! It tastes like the Newmans Own natural lemonade-but better and cheaper because you can make it easily anytime you like!

If you like sugar water with a hint of lemon, than this original recipe is the lemonade for you. The kids thought it was good, but I doubled the amount of lemon juice. The second time I made it, I used 1.5 cups sugar, and 2.5 cups of lemon juice.

It was a little TOO tart for my taste, so I added in the full 2 cups of sugar.

With a few tweets, this was the best lemonade I'd ever had. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and reduced the water to 6 cups. The water reduction was done to allow for ice melt in each glass. For the adults we added vodka.

Good ratio - halved the recipe and substituted granulated stevia for the sugar.

My 2 boys and I LOVED this.  Like other reviewers, we reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, and tried the tip to warm lemons in hot water for 10 min before squeezing.  Greatly appreciated both tips and the lemonade was a hit!  Even with reduced sugar, it was plenty sweet for this sugar-loving family.

This is a great lemonade recipe. I use Splenda instead of sugar to reduce calories, and skip the syrup making process. My kids love it and it goes faster than I can buy lemons. Thanks for the recipe!

I prefer my lemonade more tart -- I found this recipe to be very sweet. I found it helpful to go light on the sugar, I used a 1/4 cup less than called for. I also added extra lemon juice, approximately an additional 1/3 cup.  I added the zest of one lemon to the sugar water when boiling as well, and strained it out when adding the sugar water to the water and lemon juice to add a bit more lemon flavor.

It was all in all pretty good. If I made this again I'd probably cut back on the sugar, it was very very sweet.

My 14-year-old grand nephew made this with lemons grown in the backyard. I was very impressed by his resourcefulness! He followed the instructions, but a bit LARGE quantity. He split into halves and mixed each half in the blender.

His review:
"Pretty good. It has a nice mix of sweet and sour. it's not at all bland." Was he proud of his accomplishment? "Yes I am."

His 11-year-old triplets siblings had the following to say:

Brother #1: "The flavor just explodes your mouth! For people who LOVE sour? Probably not the best, but I like it!."

Brother #2: "I like the pulpy of the lemon and the sweetness of the sugar -- it combines to make it taste really good." 

Sister: "A little too sweet for my liking. I like it a little more sour."

Housekeeper says: "Deliciousa!"

Auntie says: "Truly a PERFECT lemonade! Perhaps stir it up each time you serve so the pulp is in glass..."

Congrats, Chef!!!

This is awesome! I want to give it 5 stars but  read the reviews, put 1 1/2 cups of sugar in, and it's still a little sweet. I used 2 lemons and filled the rest up with bottled lemon juice. Really good with rum! Thanks for the recipe, I will try again with 1 1/4 cups of sugar!

I reduced the sugar water what would be the equivalent of 1 1/4 cup sugar. I used six large lemons to give me 1 1/2 cup juice. It is a little weak on the lemony side for me .. next time I will try eight lemons. Over all really good

Delicious and refreshing!  We don't have a juicer, so we juiced the lemons by hand.  First we soaked the lemons in hot water for 10 minutes.  Then we rolled them on the counter until they were soft.  After cutting them in half, we placed the halves, one by one, in a Ziploc bag and used a rolling pin to squeeze every last drop out.

Excellent!  Just the right amount of tartness vs. sweetness and very easy to make.  I just bought a juicer and am having a ball with this.  Next time I think I will experiment with adding flavors like cherry and blueberry as others have done.  Good recipe!

I substituted Splenda for sugar, 1-for-1.  The Splenda dissolved without having to boil the water.  All my guests declared that it was delicious.

I loved this lemonade! The sugar mixture was surprisingly easy to make. Before I came across this recipe, I just added sugar into the water and lemon juice, but it always sank to the bottom! I'll never do that again, now that I have this wonderful recipe.

Too sweet for my taste. I went ahead and squeezed two more lemons to try to make up for it but wasn't enough. I wish I had more lemons to try to correct. Next time I will start at a cup of sugar and perhaps work my way up to 1&1/4 cup if needed.

I made it as written....but added the syrup last and only until the desired sweetness was obtained. I expect to have to do that with each batch as lemons are not all created equal. This is a keeper. Thank you

Delicious!
I only used 1/2 the simple syrup and it's perfect for us.
I suggest starting there and adding more if you need it, since everyone's tastes vary a bit.

So I went to a Mexican market to buy my lemons and boy when I got done with my lemonade and I tasted it. It tasted like hummingbird water. But then I squeezed a whole bottle of store bought lemon juice and it was ten times better.

The only change I made was to reduce the sugar by 1/2c. Took Cloverdales advise, and microwaved the lemons, and wow you really get a lot of juice out of them! Excellent!! Also, I use the plastic ice cubes, so as not to water down my drink. Enjoy!

It was good, but like many of the other suggested, the sugar is just too high.  I'm from Texas and love too-sweet tea, but for lemonade  , this was delicious and sweet, but I want my lemonade to still have a bit of a tart taste along with the sweet... and this was a whole lot of sweet. I'll definitely be making it again, but will absolutely bring it down to 1 1/4 cups like others suggested.

The above recipe was a little too sweet for my taste so I used an extra 1/4 cup lemon juice and an extra 16.9 oz of water (bottled). In total I used 5 large lemons, the simple syrup, and 4 bottles of water.

Yes! The title says it ALL! First time I've made lemonade myself-I do drink it a lot. It was fairly easy-squeezing the lemons was most of the work. I made this recipe as directed. No changes. It was Delicious! Thank You

This was SUPER AWESOME! However, the sugar is VERY sweet, so you can cut down a bit on the sugar. Also, juicers would work better than hands at the lemons.

We doubled the recipe to make a gallon, although we cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups per batch, and cooked some strawberries and raspberries into the simple syrup.  We will definitely be making more lemonades with this base.

This was my first try at making homemade lemonade since I was a kid and this came out great! It took me about 8 lemons to make the lemon juice that I needed. I also ran out of granulated sugar so I used a scant half a cup of that and the rest baking Stevia. It is definitely tart (hello delicious fresh lemon juice!) but I just added a lot of ice to my glass and it was perfect. Refreshing on a hot summer day- and I may just add some homemade watermelon vodka to it for a fun cocktail. Would definitely recommend- you can tweak to the flavor that you like pretty easily. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this lemonade today with fresh my lemons off my tree from the backyard, it turned out fantastic. Thank you to the person who suggested putting the lemons in boiling water for 10 minutes take out rest, roll  on the counter and squeeze that was brilliant I'll do this every time .
I made the simple syrup with 2 cups of water and 1 1/2 cups of sugar.

I almost followed to a T. I made the simple sugar as written but when I juiced my six lemons it gave me 1 and 3/4 cups juice so I added all of it and a quarter cup more water. It's good but I think my lemons are a little off. I'm definitely going to keep trying though to make sure it was just the lemons. Maybe a little less sugar next time too :) Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe but I had read the reviews about it being very sweet so I started with only one cup of sugar for the simple syrup and thought I would add more if needed, I didn't. We like it tart  and find it more refreshing that way.

This truly is the best Lemonade ever. Made exactly as written as it was my first time.. So didn't want to mess around. This is a great treat.. And it reminds me of the Lemonade you can get at a Carnival. I don't drink much for anything sweet.. But found this really refreshing. Ended up using 8 lemons total, squeezed by hand. I submerged my lemons in warm water for a bit and then I always roll them on the counter to get the juices flowing before cutting and squeezing. Would taste great with some fresh mint.. And could easily be made adult only with some vodka :)

The first time I made this, I found it too sweet. This time after preparing the syrup, I used about half of it (roughly one cup) for 7 cups of water and 1 1/2  of lemon juice.  This time it was perfect, not too sweet and not too tart.

I did not find this to sweet at all. I added ice cubes to the simple syrup to cool down, put everything in a pitcher added ice and water to fill, did not measure water. To get more juice I microwaved the lemons 40 seconds for 3 at a time then I squeezed by putting the lemon inside of a long tong.

I love this recipe but I only used 1 cup of sugar - more than enough. I also added strawberry pulp to make it pink. Next time I'll add one more lemon. This recipe is a great way to make gorgeous home made lemonade.

Loved it and will definitely be making it again. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup based on another review and it was perfect. I gave gave it a 5 star review based on everyone in the house loving it.

I like this recipe but I think it can stand less sugar.  I followed it exactly and it was a tad sweet.  I have a ton of freshly picked lemons so I will try it again but will reduce the sugar from 1-3/4 cups to 1-1/4 cups and see how that works.  Also, this recipe as is "serves 20".  Honestly, who drinks a glass of lemonade that's just 3.6 oz.??

This is my signature drink for family parties. My son in law and all the grandkids especially like it. It takes 7 large lemons (I buy a bag from Sam's), and I always double it (so 2 bags, 14 lemons, slices on top to make it pretty).   4-23-2016 My first time making homemade lemonade. I made it for Family Dinner Night. Everyone loved it, especially the grandkids. Perfect as is!

This drink is deliciously refreshing! Easy and minimal ingredients, thanks to MYGIRLIESMOM who suggested using the microwave instead of stove, it was perfect for what we needed!!! I normally do not like juices or fruit drinks at all but this is yummy and crisp, when cold or icy! Thanks for the recipe share!

Excellent recipe. My lemon  tree produced tons of fruit this year and I've been looking for ways to use it. This recipe fits the bill perfectly. It's simple and tastes great. I love how the syrup is made seperately -- this allows me to make extra for later. I cut the sugar back to 1 cup, and used lots of extra pulp to add back into the lemonade. Try it with a splash of vodka on a hot afternoon. Refreshing.

Absolutely perfect; not too sweet and delightful any time of the year!  I typically follow the recipe to a tee and then adjust the acidity accordingly depending if I'm using meyers, etc.

Four stars for method (the syrup really does make this a delightfully smooth, uniform beverage), though it's far too sweet. I used 1 1/2 cups sugar and it was still too much. Will reduce sugar to 1 1/3 or 1 1/4 cups next time.

This tastes best with fresh-squeezed juice, but the difference is hardly noticeable.
The only thing is the amount of sugar - 1 3/4 is far too much sugar, but half that amount is just perfect.

I made it the base way and loved it.  I have also made it throwing in some lime and grapefruit because I was short on lemons.  Both renditions came out great.

The recipe is overly sweet I'm glad I only added half sugar amount and it still tasted a little sweet thankfully. But the lemon and water ratio is right on!

My family loves this lemonade. If you don't have fresh lemons I have substituted concentrated lemon juice.  Although fresh are better.  I always double the recipe, if not it won't last long. Serve strawberrys on the side for those that might want strawberry lemonade.

The recipe is really good, tasty and healthy. I changed a few things about it because i wanted it to be more healthy. First i changed the amount of sugar to 1 cup (it's still sweet) and i used 7 cups of water so the eight would be completed with ice and i don't have to wait until is cool. By the way i thought that the recipe would be more soft but the lemon flavor is quite strong (i loved it)

Five stars if you reduce sugar a bit (to taste) and add an extra squirt of lemon juice -- yummy!

Very cool & refreshing! Easy to make. My daughters helped squeeze the lemons and loved the lemonade. I did cut the amount of sugar in half due to the kids drinking it,  I thought it was sweet enough and they loved it!! Definitely will be making this again.

Very good! I have made this twice and both times it has been a very natural and refreshing drink. My daughter has asked me to make it again tonight. I think instead of waiting for water to boil, I will use the microwave like "MYGIRLIESMOM"did. Hey, we are in the 21st Century now! To heat something up even a simple cup of water, we do not have to wait for the water to boil just stick a microwavable cup of water in the microwave to heat it up to boiling. Also, my last batch I tried to make strictly with Stevia and it did not taste as good as the first time when I made it exactly as the recipe. So, the amount of sugar mentioned in the recipe is what I will add. I think what I will do is if it is still not as sweet to my taste then I will add the Stevia. Cheers!!

My 7 yr. old daughter and I both agreed this was too syrupy and sickeningly sweet.  We prefer crisp and tart in a lemonade.  The consistency was more in line with a juice.  It wasn't 'bad', but I wouldn't recommend'  it as a refreshing lemonade.

My 12 year old daughter and 6 year old niece squeezed 12 lemons for this double recipe.  Microwaving and rolling the lemons o  the counter madeit so easy to hand squeeze the lemons.  The whole family loved this recipe - it is similar to those expensive lemonade you buy at fairs.

I also took a shortcut and boiled the water in the microwave then added the sugar. My granddaughter loved this so much I'm on my way to buy more lemons! I used 5 large lemons and cut the sugar back to only a cup, we like a little zip to our lemonade. Thanks for the recipes and suggestions.

This lemonade is sooo good! It does not take 4 hours to make. I did not include the pulp (I hate all pulp), but it was delicious. I do have an electric juicer, so it makes things easier. I decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup and increased the lemon juice from my tree by 1/2 cup.I get compliments every time I make it and it works great mixed with homemade iced tea too.

Very refreshing.  Used the tip and put lemons in hot water for 10 mins before juicing by hand.  Cut sugar down to 1.5 cups, infused sugar with rind of 3 lemons and it was just right.

Too much sugar! Start with one cup and then taste to desired sweetness. As is the recipe is sickeningly sweet.

This is a simple and excellent recipe.  I used fresh Lisbon lemons (like a Eureka lemon) from our tree so they are quite tart.  This recipe  gave a nice balance between the sour and sweet.  To make this recipe even better, I zested the lemons and put the zest in with the sugar and water when I made the simple syrup.  I will do this one again because the grandkids are always asking for it.

I used 5 large lemons (1 1/4 C juice), 1 1/8 C sugar and heated 1 cup water and sugar in microwave for 2 m. or till boiling, then added apx. 1 cup ice to cool it off, and remaining 6 C water.  With a lemon quarter squeezed into each glass, this was perfect for our tastes.

This is a very good recipe! I didn't give it five stars because i found it sweet so i added a few more cups of water! Took no time at all! I cheated and used concentrate lemon juice and used pre-boiled water to add to the sugar. As cut up some lemons and limes to add to the mix!

This is an excellent recipe!  I've made it as is, and it's absolutely delicious. It's certainly sweet, so experiment with the sugar measurements to find your perfect amount.  I've also made it by substituting real coconut water for regular water.  This gives it an additional yummy flavor and also lets me cut way back on the amount of sugar needed because the coconut water already has sweetness to it.

Had to add more lemon juice because it tasted like sugar water.  Not sure if it depends on the type of lemons used.  Maybe my lemons were more sweet than sour?  Anyway good once the ratio is corrected.

I love this recipe and have been using it for years. I get so many compliments on it! Most recently, I love to use watermelon scraps and make a watermelon lemonade with a few leaves of mint. It only takes about 1/2 cup of watermelon juice for a recipe of 3 servings.

I'm not a big lemon fan and even I found it to be super refreshing. The toughest part about making this for me was finding a big enough container to make it in....but that soon wasn't a problem as it disappeared quickly from the fridge. Will definitely make again....may even try to tweak it next time. Recipe great as is.

I made this last weekend for a bbq party at home and everyone was raving about it!! Will definitely be making it often during summer. I just used a cup of boiling water out if a kettle for the sugar syrup, stirred the sugar till it dissolved and refrigerated it. Definitely a keeper!!

I used this recipe as a base for mango lemonade and it turned out great! I used one very ripe mango blended with the water and simple syrup and added the lemon juice last. So good!

Substituted 1/2 cup honey instead of the sugar and it was great!  Our 6 lemons only made 1 cup of lemon juice so I adjusted by only adding 5.3 cups water (plus the 1 cup water in the syrup).  Delicious, & healthy :)

I quickly looked at the ingredients to this recipe without paying attention to the directions. So when i made this lemonade, i used 1 3/4c fresh squeezed lemon juice, 1 1/2c of sugar, and 8c of water. I added everything together in jug and shook it up. It turned out great :)

This lemonade is awesome! It was a bit strong for my taste, so I added an extra cup of water. I love strawberry lemonade, so I put a pouch of frozen dole strawberries in a blender with a little of the lemonade. It should come out slushy. Then add to the lemonade mix...delicious and refreshing!

Super sweet. Make sure to reduce the sugar to 1 cup or you'll have a diabetic coma amount of sugar. Soak your lemons in hot water for about 10 minutes and then roll them for softer, juicer lemons. You can even use limes. Add strawberries or mangoes or raspberries for flavored lemonade.

I made this with a little over a cup of Splenda for my husband.  Added 6 cups of water and sampled, it already tasted watered down.  I don't think real sugar would've improved the flavor that greatly, it just wasn't worth the effort compared to buying store brand.

I made this recipe as is last night and it was amazing. I usually struggle to get the sugar to dissolve in the cold water, so boiling it into a syrup was a big help. My mom loved this lemonade.

If you look at a cross-section of the reviews of this lemonade recipe, you will see that some people find it too sweet, some find it too tart, but in any case, this is a good recipe to start with.  If it's too sweet, simply reduce the sugar and/or add more lemon juice, water, or ice.  If it's too tart, simply reduce the amount of lemon juice and/or add more sugar, water or ice.  If you follow the directions exactly, it comes out pretty well in any case. I like to drink it chilled but without ice, but I think the recipe will stand up to serving it over ice.  Try garnishing with lemon slices in the pitcher and/or in individual glasses.

I did a few modifications in my most recent attempt at making this, and you might want to try some as well.  I reduced the sugar to one and a half cups and used turbinado sugar.  I did not heat the sugar and water to make syrup first, I simply  added the sugar crystals directly to cool, filtered water in a sealable container, shook it up really well, then added the lemon juice and shook it up again.  The heating of the sugar in the water does not really do anything except facilitate the sugar crystals' going up into solution. Shaking the mixture vigorously does the same thing.  I also only used 7 cups of water, and although I have a citrus juicer, I experimented with store-bought lemon juice in a bottle.  I tasted the lemonade straight, and it was fine.  Over ice it would still be strong enough.  It's a fine recipe to play with, so have fun!

Such a hit! Everyone who tried this loved it and thought it was the best lemonade they ever had. It was a little too sour and sweet for my taste so I put extra water in my glass but everyone else thought it was perfect. I've made this twice already and I will be making it a lot more I'm sure :) Thank you!!

Perfect proportions! I used 6 good sized lemons and got exactly 1.5 cups of lemon juice! I also took the advice of a previous reviewer and microwaved the water/sugar to make the simple syrup, then put a couple handfuls of ice cubes in to cool it down.  With the help of my food processor juicer attachment (and my 3 year old), the whole process took us about a half hour to make it.  We strained out the pulp because we are not "pulp people," but this recipe is delicious! I may even puree some fresh summer strawberries and make some strawberry lemonade!

Just perfect, I just made it and we love it.  Took the tip about making the "simple syrup" in the microwave and it worked great.

Loved it! It was just the right about of sweet with the best hint of tart. We only added 1 1/2 cup of sugar instead, and we took someone's advice and put the syrup in the microwave for 2 minutes, and after put some ice in it. This made it go much faster.

I used two cups of lemon juice, 1-1/2 cups sugar and a 1/2 of water.  I boiled about half the water and added the sugar.  When it was dissolved I added it to everything else in a gallon pitcher filled with ice and the ice melts to make a gallon and cools it down.  It was delicious.  It's worth spending $20 on a quick juicer.  It took me about 3 minutes to get the juice for 2 cups.

Heat and roll the lemons first to get more juice out

So good, even with (gasp) lemon juice bought from the store. I had to use two pitchers (where normally a can of concentrate would make only 1 pitcher full. It was so good we drank it all in one day!

Holy  this is awesome. I didn't have enough lemon juice so I blended together some watermelon and strawberries in the watermelon juice from the container and added for that last half cup. It made it sweeter and less tart, but still awesome. If I did have the rest of the juice it would be perfect.

This recipe is outstanding!  I love making homemade lemonade, and this recipe has always done well.  Every time I've made this it has gotten great reviews from those who have drank it.  It takes a little work, but the recipe was very easy to follow.

Great! Just one adjustment: the sugar water from the ingredients yielded 1.5 cups of syrup for me; I used 1.25 cups of the syrup. I doubt using all the syrup would have made it too sweet. Also, I used 6 cups of water, instead of 8, and filled the remainder in the form of ice. I prefer my lemonade a little on the tart side. :)

This lemonade is WONDERFUL! I quadrupled the batch and sold it at my local farmers market stand. Everyone loved it! I sold out completely both times I've been there. I plan on making it every time I go there. Here's one tip, instead of heating the sugar and the water on the stove, just do it in the microwave instead. It's much quicker and easier. Hope this helps!

This is one fine lemonade to usher in the beginning of summer.  The ratios of sugar, to water, to lemon are perfect and illicit just the right amount of pucker to your lips.  As another had suggested, the use of a microwave and ice cubes can hurry you on to Lemonirvana, 

Nuke 1 cup of water for 1 minute.  Add sugar to irradiated water.  Swirl into a syrupy translucent mixture.  Pour remaining water, ice, and lemon juice to jug.  Stir in syrup.  Jug-a-lug.  A note on the mysteries of ice: place ice into your measuring cup before adding the water to ensure an accurate measurement.

Delicious.  Took about 5-6 lemons to make 1.5 cups.  I added all the water when I made the syrup and it turned out fine.  Also floated thinly sliced lemon and orange slices to the punch bowl.  It was the hit of the party and gone before any of the other beverages.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked the lemonade, but I enjoy it more a bit on the sour side. I would go down to just a cup of sugar next time. It's a keeper recipe, though.

Awesome! Great base recipe.  I used pure lemon juice from a bottle to make it easier.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup. I used ice and water for the remaining 7 cups of water u add at the end to cool it faster.  I threw 1/2 the mix in my blendtec and added a cup of frozen strawberries. Yum! We made these into popsicles and added a dash of heavy whipping cream to the pops too. With the remaining simple syrup and ice/water we added lime juice and frozen strawberries to make strawberry limeade.  Awesome if you like margaritas!

My boyfriend was kind enough to lend his muscles to squeeze the lemons by hand for lack of a better and method and we managed to get 1 cup of juice from 6 lemons. We rolled them on the counter before juicing them but I would recommend looking into other methods of extracting the juice more efficiently. It was tasty!

Halved the recipe the first time I made it. Rather than measure fresh lemon juice or use concentrate, I just eyeballed it, and 5 medium to large lemons was the perfect number to use for a half recipe.

I made this recipe to the tune of 10 gallons for a Cub Scout campout.  Everyone loved it!  I did change two things: 1. I used only 1 1/2 cups sugar(and it was still on the sweet side); 2. I peeled some of the outer rinds on the lemons and added them right after I took the simple syrup off the burner to get the oil out them for even more flavor.

Making a sugar syrup is definitely the best way to make lemonade. This recipe is waaaay too sweet though. My first batch I threw out. Second batch was too tart with only one cup sugar. The perfect ratio is 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups sugar

I love this lemonade! I was blessed with a large box of Meyer lemons and my daughter brought over her juicer so we could freeze the juice. I needed to know the proportions of juice to water in a good lemonade and this recipe did just that! Now I just pull a container of juice out of the freezer and we have great lemonade for family parties. The simple syrup makes a lot of difference too - smooths it out - don't skip that part! ??

I used 1.5 c of sugar and 1.4 cup of lemon juice, took all of 10 minutes to throw together. I didn't make simple syrup threw it all in the pitcher using room temperature bottled water and it was ready to drink. It was perfect, thanks!

This is IT- it's the only recipe we'll ever need for lemonade! Tried this recipe a week ago, and have since had to make it 3 times- it's that good. :) Thank you so much for sharing this one- it's great to be able to make lemonade, the "clean" way- no nasty corn syrup-based glop in a can for this family! :D

Every one has been making some sort of cherry/strawberry limeade including me but I didn't do enough for that to taste like cherry lemonade so this was a good way to hold off until the next grocery trip.

This is the one! As a self-identified lemonade junkie, this recipe gets the proportions exactly right. Not too sweet. not too tart. Jusr right! We add just a touch of vanilla extract (really just a drop or two) for that extra zing. Enjoy!!

Delicious! Just made today. I hand squeezed 8 lemons and had about1 1/4 cup of juice. I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar with the cup of water and stirred on the stove on medium heat until it just dissolved. Added a little over 3 quarts of water and it came out perfect just like my Grandma makes! A little sweet but more tart.

This was wonderful! I took note of people saying it was too sweet so I used a little less sugar, next time I will put the exact amount in as I didn't think I made it sweet enough. Minus me not following the recipe, it was great! I will definitely be making this in the future for parties and gatherings!

Refreshing and a Thirst Quencher! The Best Lemonade Ever was just what I was looking for when I wanted something for a hot summer day. The concoction is boiled on the stove to make a simple syrup. This method dissolves the sugar well. Chill in the Refrigerator, pour over ice and Enjoy!

The title says it all.  My kids love squeezing the fresh lemons.  It's a family affair, and disappears quickly. I love it!

I only gave it 4 stars b/c I made changes...Made this, but did reduce the sugar per other reviews. Used 6 large lemons and after soaking them (per another review) in hot/warm water X 20 minutes, rolled them and got 2 cups of juice. Nice refreshing beverage. Will try adding strawberries next time for a switch. Def'nt keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and really liked it. However, it is more sweet than tart, and my family likes tart better, although that's just preference. So, I now make it using 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 cup sugar. Sometimes I use a little less water, to make it a little stronger. But the recipe is great as is, and it's very easy to tweak to specific likes. Sometimes I sub 1/2 cup lime juice for the lemon juice, which is great. It's also amazing frozen and turned into a slushy.

I have a very prolific Meyer lemon tree, I squeeze, freeze the juice, slices & wedges.  This is a great recipe to use up all my juice.  Because Meyer lemons are a cross between a mandarin orange and a lemon I used 1/4 cup less sugar.  My family enjoyed it.

Confessions of a lemonade snob- I LOVE this recipe. Not too tart. Not too sweet. It is great! I followed the advice of someone else and make the sugar syrup in the microwave for one minute- and it STILL turns out amazing. I've made it almost 6 times now.

Very Good! Tastes really good. The simple syrup is a good idea. I would just pour sugar in and mix forever!! For a twist, I like to put mint in my lemonade, so I put it in the simple syrup and straind it out afterwards. Good Stuff. Perfect for summer.

This recipe is delicious... gave it a 4 star only because my family found the amount of sugar used is waaaaay too much.  We tend to like a nice balance or a tad more sourness rather than sickeningly sweet. Great beverage during the summer months!

Delicious! Very refreshing, great for our 4th of July cookout. Not overly "lemony" or sour. It is quite sweet. I used the juice of 8 lemons.

This lemonade recipe is amazing! But instead of water I used soda water. It Makes it more refreshing and fizzy. A great recipe! Perfect sourness perfect sweetness. 5 stars.

This is very yummy - but, oh my!, what a lot of work! LOTS of squeezing. I would not make this again without some type of a juicer. Just takes too much time!

Mmmmm...I made it almost exactly---once I boiled the sugar/water syrup I added a cup or two of ice to the pan. I also use a Pampered Chef juicer--saves so much time! It took me about 6 lemons plus I used 1 lime just to bump the flavor. I also put some fresh mint from my garden into the pitcher. Just delish!

Simple and delicious! Not too tart not too sweet...i did not cool the sugar mixture in the fridge before mixing and it was great -  (i like warm lemonade).  everyone else in my house loved it after it cooled too!  i can't wait to serve this at a cookout.

My husband and I love this lemonade. The pitcher I used couldn't hold all of the liquid so I just used 6 and 1/2 cups of water.  It turned out great!!  Thanks, Jo, for the recipe. We will use this all summer.

I made this yesterday for my dad who is very picky and he absolutely loved it! The only thing I did a little different was add 1 1/4 cup sugar so it wasn't so sweet. I will make this again and make frozen pops for the kids. Thanks

This is really GREAT lemonade.  The simple syrup was super easy to make.  I ended up using a full 2 cups of lemon juice, because we like our lemonade pretty tart, but otherwise followed the directions.  Very refreshing!

Oooh so refreshing. The secret is heating the sugar and water to make syrup. I have a juicer, so that made it super easy for the rest. And good tip on adding the mint leaves from the garden, thanks!

I switched about 2 cups of water for ice so that I could drink it faster. And cut the sugar to 1 2/3 as opposed to 1 3/4. Great recipe easily tweaked to personal preference. Thanks for the recipe!

Really smooth and easy to make. I made it as per the recipe but increased it to serve 50. It was definetley a bit sweet for my taste so next time I will reduce the sugar. I got 3 1/4 cups of lemon jucie from 18 small lemons. I put them in the microwave for 10-20 seconds then rolled them before cutting and juicing them.

This was excellent. This was my first attempt to make homemade lemonade and it was a definite success. I followed other reviewers suggestions and heated the water and sugar mixture in the microwave to same on time for 2 minutes then chilled in the fridge. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe...I used only 1.5 cups sugar...otherwise it was a bit sweet.  I also pureed some strawberries and put it in the lemonade for natural sweetener.  Tasted like strawberry lemonade from Red Robin.  So good and the kids had me make 3 pitchers the first day.  I didn't chill.  To make the whole 8 cups of water, I just added ice cubs and that was it.  Awesome.

This is a good Lemonade recipe.  I followed the directions the first time I made it, but found it way too sweet and after adding ice cubes to the glass, found the taste diluted too much.      The second time I made it I cut back on the sugar by a 1/2 cup and added only 5 cups of water (including the sugar water).  I then added ice cubes to the glasses and found it was much better tasting.

This is excellent and you can adjust the sugar to your taste. Strawberries were on sale last week, so I pureed some and added to the lemonade.  I buy the bottled lemon juice at Sam's (2 huge bottles) for $5.00 and I use Splenda.  It is so much more economical (even using the Splenda) than to buy the ready made drinks like Fuze that I have been buying.  I'm sure it is much cheaper than buying Crystal Light too.

I used bottled lemon juice and 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I still found it too sweet, next time I'll use 1 cup of sugar.

the only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that it was just too sweet.  i like my lemonade a little more sour, so next time i will cut back on the sugar.  other than that, it was great!!

This was simple but good :) My daughter made this for us and we enjoyed it. We didn't use as much sugar as called for because we like a tart lemonade. Next time I will either up the lemon juice, or use even less sugar. We used 1 1/4 cups this time.

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and it's great!  My son and husband love it at full throttle, but I fill my water bottle with half of this and half water!!  I don't like the pulp, so I'll do it different next time.  But there WILL be a next time!!

Very nice on hot days! I just mix all ingredients and stir for 5 minutes until the sugar is dissolved. Add some ice cubes and ready to drink in 10 minutes.

This lemonade is the F'ing BOMB!  Because I like my lemonade a little tart I used 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 3/4 cups lemon juice.  My 3-year-old boy LOVES it.  I have a lemon tree at my disposal so it makes it really convenient.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

I used 1 1/4 cup sugar because I like it my lemonade just a little sweet but not too much.  I had 8 largish lemons which gave me about 1 1/4 cup lemon juice.   I added a little from a bottle to make up the difference.  I also added 9 large strawberries (pureed) as well as the pulp from three of the lemons.  It ended up having the right mix of sweet and sour.  It was really nice to have a guideline to follow.  Thanks Jo!

This is really the BEST lemonade ever!  I make it every summer and my kids can't get enough!  I was talking to my 5 yr old the other day about how summer was coming and asked what he was looking forward to, he said swimming and drinking lemonade!  This lemonade is like sunshine in a glass!  LOVE IT!

I love lemonade and this definately is the best recipe for it ever!! I made it for a picnic and everyone loved it and asked how I made it. It was ingenius to create a simple syrup for ever mixing!

I also made a "7up" knock off by using half fresh lemons and half limes and mixing in club soda.

I also made icecubes with mint in them for an added touch

Love this recipe. It is VERY comparable to the Simply Lemonade we buy in stores, but not as expensive. If you don't mind taking the time to make this, I think it is worth the $4 you save at the store everytime. First time I made this I didn't have lemons, so I used bottled lemon juice and it came out so great. The real lemon is an added bonus if you like the pulpy taste.

Great base recipe and my two older boys had a blast juicing the lemons...I would like to play around with this in the future adding different flavors.  Beats the canned high fructose corn syrup stuff any day!!

We picked lemons off of the tree in our garden and really thought it was the best lemonade in the world.

It's funny I ran across this recipe - I detest drinking water unless I've been exercising, so in order to still get enough, I drink this same concoction daily.  Except I got tired of squeezing lemons, so I use bottled lemon juice instead.  Also, I don't use sugar for glycemic purposes, so I use splenda instead.  Just as great & refreshing!

I have one of those manual citrus squeezers that Rick Bayless uses (I got mine at a Mexican grocery), and can testify that it made quick work of getting maximum juice for minimum effort.  This really is wonderful lemonade!  The hardest part was waiting for the sugar syrup to get cold before mixing things up.  Fantastico!!

This was the first (homemade) lemonade I have ever made and it will be the only one I'll make from here on out. I make this all the time. My husband wants it and doesn't like to share it at all. He made me make it when we went with his family on vacation. They loved it too and I had to give it to them so they can make. I also tried it with splenda and it was still good just a little different taste. Great summer treat!

I used "real lemon juice" from a bottle.  This was good lemonade - no more can stuff for me.  Maybe next time I'll spend the time and squeeze real lemons.. wonderful!

Great - thanks Jo!  I used the exact measurements called for and it’s just the right sweet/tart combo for me.  I  didn't wait for the syrup to cool before mixing it all together.  

I bought an electric citrus juicer just for this recipe ($17 at Target).  It was worth every penny as it made this  so quick and easy to do, and I only needed 6 lemons.

amazing recipe for lemonade!
i squeezed the lemons by hand which really did not take too long...you dont really need to let the sugar+water mixture cool down..just add in the rest of the cold water...after i was done adding the water i put in a whole tray of ice cubes and mixed the lemonade really well in the blender...it took hardly 20 minutes to do it all..and result was AWESOMe..
most refreshing lemonade ever!

Good stuff!  I made it with a little less sugar and it was great.  Next time I will try with full sugar to compare.  Thanks to reviewers with advice to soak lemons in hot water then roll.  Worked great! This lemonade tasted even better the next day. I wish I had found this recipe at the beginning of summer instead of in the fall - it would be perfect by the pool.  I will file away for next year.

I have never made a homemade drink like this before and was very nervous about how it would turn out. WOW! Took it to a party and everyone loved it. To kick it up a notch, we put fresh squeezed strawberries in and it was better than any restaraunt lemonade. Thank you.

SO freakin' yummy! I used 1 1/4 cup sugar because previous reviews said it was too sweet, and I was  about 1/4 cup short in lemon juice, so I used lime juice. (I was trying to use some lemons before they went bad!) It turned out WONDERFULLY and will definitely go in my family cookbook! Thanks for sharing!

I too adjusted the sugar in my lemonade to taste. I only used 1 cup in the syrup and it was perfect. My brother almost drank a whole pitcher to himself he was that impressed. I also had a heap of fesh mint leaves to the lemonade to soak, and it really made it delicious!

Doubling the recipe was perfect for my gallon pitcher.  I used bottled lemon juice and it was easy and delicous.   The recipe was exactly as sweet as my family likes it.

I was good. I have tasted better homemade lemonade, but I am not sure what it lacks.

This is an excellent lemonade - still not as good as the fairs as I wanted to recreate - but the best lemonade I've made so far!  Very smooth - not too tart.

This was the best fresh squeezed lemonade I've ever tasted. It reminded me of the lemon shake ups at the fair. My husband loved it too. It was a little too tart after it chilled, but once it sets in the fridge over the night it's just perfect. I put a few frozen raspberries in my glass and it gave it a nice raspberry flavor to the lemonade. Very good! We have a lemon tree so we will make this again and again!!!

I liked it too.  I did not have time to wait for the hot syrup to cool so I heated up only 2 cups of water and added the sugar.  Heated it until the sugar dissolved, didn't quite come to a boil.  Then I poured it in the pitcher and added cold water to fill it about 3/4 way and filled the rest up with ice cubes.  Put it in the fridge and it was nice and cold in an hour.

It tasted okay.  I had to add more lemon juice and sugar to get it to my sweetness level, though.  That may just be my preference.

Everyone loved this!!  I don't think I'll be making this often because it does require a lot of work to juice the lemons.  But I will say it was easy to substitute Splenda for the sugar, and it tasted delicious and no one noticed the difference.  Summertime in a glass!

Ratio of ingredients was great, without having to continuously taste to mix. Actually, I squeezed all of a bag of lemons, then rescaled the recipe until I got the amount of juice that matched what I had squeezed, then I went from there with the other measurements. Worked great. Thanks!

Not bad but I think it was missing something. I guess I like mines a little on the tart side. Still I have to admit this is a pretty good lemonade drink and quite easy to make. A good friend of mine has a lemon tree and gives me boxes of them, I'll be making this again until I find another to suit my tart taste buds.

This was delicious.  We followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great.  We served it to adults and children and all agreed it was a "keeper".

It was really needed for such hot days. I thought the mixture was a bit too concentrated so i added more cups of water and also lessened the sugar a little.

This recipe is very easy to make. Guests liked the lemonade better after an additional cup of water was added. Delicious. Thank you.

I tinkered a bit and found equal amounts of sugar and lemon juice (1 1/2 cups of each) are the best combination for me.  Other than that, this lemonade can't go wrong, no matter what kind of lemons you use.  The concentrate freezes well too, so you can make batches of it when lemons are cheap and enjoy your lemonade all year round.

Excellent! Quick and refreshing. Dissolving the sugar in boiling water first was a great idea, but I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and used the hot syrup right away - adding ice cubes and additional water to chill the syrup.
