Uncle JJ, you are a GOOD MAN.  The recipe was followed exactly.  I tried this on pork chops and chicken (both BBQ'd of course) and they were divine.

As suggested, I added three tablespoons of cornstarch to prevent clumping (for storage).  It worked like a CHARM.  The cornstarch also reduces a lot of the heat, if you shy away from spices.

I agree with Voleyballmom: this will not taste good on beef.  Sorry, chickens!

Yowza! Kick City! We love it. If you are shy of heat you may want to reduce the cayenne and maybe the chili powder. Otherwise this is a fabulous rub for chicken or pork as suggested. I wouldn't use it on anything beef. We had it on a pork tenderloin and it was delish. Thank you uncle jj!

My boyfriend needed rib rub and was going to buy some but I refused to let him. Typical male household that's very short on supplies; we've used it on ribs, chicken, and my favorite acorn squash. The rub caramelizes beautifully, so this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I used smoked paprika as a substitution. The rub was just enough to cover two full racks of pork ribs. It was so good with just the right amount of sweet and heat, paired with the smokiness from the paprika. I can't wait to use it again next week. Going to try it on grilled pork chops.

Thank you Uncle JJ for this recipe! I made this dry rub for some pork ribs and it turned out amazing! I rubbed it on and let it sit for 30 mins before cooking just like the recipe stated. It wasn't too terribly spicy. Will definitely use this again!!

I followed the recipe and it is now my husband's favorite rib seasoning. The paprika I had on hand was too smoky for most dishes I make, so I used it in the rub and the intense smokiness added a nice flavor.

I used half the paprika, no cayenne pepper and maybe half the black pepper to make it kid friendly. Used one recipe for 9 chicken breasts.

This was delicious on chicken drumsticks that we grilled!  I put it on the drumsticks and placed them back in the fridge for several hours before grilling.  

We were out of brown sugar and I replaced with honey, which made it more of a paste (added a bit of hot water to thin).  I left out the cayenne because we have young children.  It was so good!  Definitely will make again!!!!!

I've made it twice now and those who ate say the ribs are great.  Had sauce on the table  both times and no one used it.  I did slow cook these using a Holland Grill and I'm sure that helped too.  Still, this is an excellent rub.

I didn't have dark brown sugar so I used the light. I also used a 1/2-3/4 tsp of cayenne. Rubbed  it on baby back ribs. It was excellent!!  I cooked the ribs on a rack in a baking pan and covered with foil for 2 hours at 350. Should have covered the bottom of the baking pan with foil because I ended up with a caramelized black mess in the bottom of the baking pan. Definitely will use this rub again! Great,great,great

This was my first attempt at smoking ribs with a rub.  I didn't care for this rub recipe because I thought it was heavy on the cayenne pepper.  I know that some folks like cayenne (as do I) but this was a bit much.  I will keep experimenting with rubs...just not with Uncle JJ's.

I made this rub and put it on pork ribs. I added more cayenne pepper and also some Cajun seasoning because I like a little more heat. This rub turned out amazing, everyone was very happy.
