i've made this dip for years.  For parties, I spread the cream cheese on the bottom of a shallow pan, then spread the crab sauce mixture on top.  I get requests for this everywhere I go!

Excellent recipe, I added a little onion and garlic powder to the cream cheese and sprinkled fresh parsley over the top.  It was a hit, thanks for sharing!

I've been making this app for years and it's great to take to any party with people of all ages... I do it the same way CINDYT does by spreading the cream cheese on a platter, then spread the cocktail sauce and shred up the crab on top of that... I serve it with several cracker choices. I wouldn't just put the block of cream cheese, it's a little too hard for people to eat that way. Great dip though!!

during lobster season here in Southern California I make this dip using lobster. it's quite a treat considering lobster is quite expensive here.
