I made so much for a party the night before Thanksgiving, I thought I would have enough left to smooth over and take the next night to the big dinner. Boy was I wrong. The inebriated guests that were left at the end of the night coaxed me into bringing it back out and I ended up going to the store at midnight to get more ingredients to make another batch. It was a success on both nights to say the least. I wasn't allowed to add peppers because they are not a favorable taste in my family. But I would like to at some point especially this month because the green and red adds a special festive look. . .

It turned out ok, about what you would expect for 4 ingredients.  I would recomend only adding half the packet of ranch and tasting it.  Then decide if you want more flavor.  The ranch seasoning was a bit overpowering for my taste.  It was like the crab wasn't even in the recipe at all.
