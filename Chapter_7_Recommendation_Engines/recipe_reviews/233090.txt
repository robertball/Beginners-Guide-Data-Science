Very good flavor and easy to make!  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt like it was a little too much cake on top for my taste.  Next time I will add maybe 2 or 3 extra cups of apricots to the mixture.  I also added a crumb topping--yum!

I followed the recipe exactly except added the extra tablespoon of butter left in the stick.  When did more butter harm anything?  The result was perfect.  Not runny (I cooked the syrup about 5 minutes instead of the 1 stated as I think that is a typo).  The apricots were given to me from a friend's tree, and some where sweet and some were tart.  This would be great with peaches too. The batter is perfect to me - a sweet biscuit dough.  Definitely making this again.  It makes a lot, so cut the recipe down for a smaller batch of apricots.  This recipe would feed a crowd.

This was good! Very easy, but it is way more cakey than traditionally cobblery.

The flavor was good but I must have done something wrong when I made the topping.  My topping was more like a cake instead of a biscuit/crumble. I will try it again and hopefully it will come out right.

This is my sisters recipe, and I think it is amazing.  You can try it with any kind of fruit.  We usually use peach or apricot.

Absolutely delicious. I decreases the sugar by a third and added blueberries on top of the apricots before putting the dough on top. It was juicy and fresh tasting. My family loved it.

The apricots were delicious prepared according to the recipe.  It does have a thick cakey layer of cobbler which could be easily adjusted to preference.  A great way to use up the buckets of apricots from our bountiful harvest!

This tasted awesome! I added a bit more cinnamon. I also used a fork to measure the flour and leved it off. I didn't use quite a cup of milk and limited the sugar sprinkled on top to half a tablespoon instead of the two tablespoons it asked for. The crust was the best I've made!

Yes but I had not made so I use allspice and I use blueberries with the apricot with a Twist and rum smells good. This was a good simple easy recipe to follow and with a crumble I actually add toasted walnuts and and toasted oatmeal

Very good. I did add some cardamom, just about a 1/4 tsp. This will be my new go-to for summer potlucks.

Delicious!  Because some reviewers said the cobbler was "too cakey" (and because I have a ton of apricots from my tree), I increased the apricots to 8 cups.  We like cinnamon, so I doubled that to 1/2 teaspoon.  Also added a little almond extract to both the fruit and the topping.  Really wonderful!!

we used very ripe apricots. so I did not pre cook them. we also used stevia sugar blend to cutting the sugar. I used raw sugar on top with dabs of butter. I also added ginger,.cinnamon, & nutmeg in the apricots and topping.

Followed directions to a tee except I used seven cups of apricots (got a lot of apricots on the tree this year) and it was wonderful. The crust was perfect and really complemented the apricots. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Followed the recipe and realized  I missed cutting in the butter, so I melted the butter and stirred into the batter.  It was excellent and my husband loved it, we had it for breakfast with our coffee.  Definitely will make this again with fresh apricots or peaches.

I followed the recipe exactly except I made only 3/4 of the dough/cake and it was perfect in proportion and deliciousness. My husband's eyes opened wide when he tasted it. Mine too. I like apricots both raw and cooked, but this recipe made cooked the standout favorite. Oh--I used all 7 T of butter for the 3/4 version of the dough.  This recipe gets the tart and sweet of fresh apricots. Really, really good.
