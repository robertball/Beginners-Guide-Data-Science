I picked out this recipe because both my parents don't eat egg yolk.  Much to my surprise, this dish doesn't taste dull or gross at all like I thought it would be.  It's actually kinda refreshing.

My husband has really missed deviled eggs since he had a heart attack. I thought these would be a good substitute. He didn't like them and neither did my kids. Sorry.

I came up with a similar recipe but I used crushed saltines instead of the potatoes (4 crackers per egg) and I also did not use relish.  Some of my friends actually thought they tasted better than real devil eggs.  Great taste and not too unhealthy.

A unique and enjoyable twist on the tired old devilled eggs I grew up with.

I don't like this recipe. No one I or my family knows does either. It does bake quick though.

I hate to admit I changed this recipe, but I give it five stars out of principle. Great idea to use potato instead of high cholesterol yolks! For reliable results I recommend using your favorite deviled egg recipe, just sub mashed potatoes for the egg yolks. A mini food processor works great to blend the filling, and no one knew the difference! Thanks for the heart healthy idea!
