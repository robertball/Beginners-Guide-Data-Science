Really good!  Suprisingly so.  Does not need any extra sweetness.  Goes well with "Balsamic Glazed Salmon Fillets," also on this site.  Perfect meal!

This recipe was AMAZING, though I have to admit, I doctored it to suit my sweet tooth. I added a few table spoons of brown sugar to the mashed potatoes and chipotle peppers, and before I baked it in the casserole dish, I added a brown sugar and pecan topping to the top. YUM. This recipe is coming with me to the Thanksgiving Table.

We love this recipe.  I add a bit more chipotle pepper because we like some heat.  If you like the smoky flavor but not the heat you can sub smoked paprika for the chipotle pepper. To take it over the top add some coarsely grated manchego cheese.  Excellent side with grilled meats!

Fabulous. This was eaten up by even my non-sweet potato eaters and my die-hard sweet potato/marshmallow casserole lovers. I added a bit of maple syrup to give a little more sweetness and flavor and adjusted the amount of chipotles for the small kids in my family.

This needs 2 or 3 times as much chipotle peppers and adobo sauce for my taste- I was worried about it having too much spice so I made the recipe as stated but the sweet potatoes were still too sweet for us.

I am not normally a fan of Sweet Potatoes because they are usually made too sweet for me. I made this with canned yams (that I already had on hand), drained well and added no extra sweet anything, and I am now a fan of these for sure.  Will have to make them with fresh before I can give 5 stars, but the canned worked nicely.

Great recipe.  I added some brown sugar to the top (as recommended by others) so it would caramelize a bit while baking. I tasted the mix before the brown sugar was added and after with the brown sugar was much better.  It adds just a touch of sweet to counteract the smokey heat from the Chipotle.   So easy to make.

I just made this recipe with about 5 sweet potatoes mashed and two whole chipotle peppers (plus some added adobo sauce) and brown sugar and boy was it good!! next time I might try scraping some of the seeds out first for a smoother texture.

This was fabulous!  Even with only half the chipotle peppers, it was plenty hot and the smoky flavor still came through.  They made a nice complement to the buttery sweetness of the sweet potatoes.  This will definitely become a regular at our house.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow very very good. This was smoky and had some heat but was mild. I cut this down to what it said was 2 servings which was a I think it called for 1.5 lb potatoes and so I used canned approx same amount draining them first and used the measurements it scaled it down to. I doubled the butter though and removed the seeds from the pepper. I spread this in a pyrex pie plate prepped with non stick spray and baked it along with a main dish for about 45 minutes and it was a hit. DH wouldn't try he doesn't eat sweet potatoes, but I loved this! Thanks.

What a fantastic alternative to sugary sweet potato preparations! My family has avoided sweet potatoes for years because they are so often dripping with sugar or marshmallows (they are called "sweet" potatoes, after all, do they really need to be sweeter?!) but we love LOVE this recipe. It goes in a flash at my department's holiday potluck. At home we really like things hot & spicy, so I add another pepper for extra kick. I've also substituted olive oil for the butter to make it vegan friendly and it makes almost no difference. Thank you SUBEAR!

I don't usually like sweet potatoes or spicy foods, but this was a fabulous dish.  It wasn't too sweet or spicy so the mix was wonderful.

This was a great spin on traditional sweet potatoes!  I reduced the recipe to one serving and added about 3 T of maple syrup, 2T of brown sugar, and a dash of milk.  The sweet and spicy contrast was fantastic!  My boyfriend loved them with our juicy steaks for dinner tonight!

This recipe is fabulous!  I didn't change a thing - love it!  Went well with our Balsamic Glazed Salmon Fillets. This may also make an appearance on the Thanksgiving table.  :)

I liked that this recipe can be made a day ahead.  Also, it has a smooth and creamy texture.  However, I found I don't really care for chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  Next time I make this recipe I think I'll subsitute something sweet like crushed pineapple.

I would've given this 5 stars but my husband preferred our other recipe (sweet potatos with roasted garlic and rosemary, from allrecipes). This was really easy and I loved the smokey heat finish. Very good!

This is one of our fall favorites.  We serve it every time one of our fall holidays comes around, and everyone always raves about it!  It's delicious, and very simple to make.  If you bake the potatoes the same day you serve, it's even better, because the potatoes are still naturally warm and they haven't gotten cold yet.  Will serve this year at my family's Thanksgiving.

Made exactly as written and hubby and I loved it, might add a little more chipotle next time.  My suggestion: Don't add sugar (extra calories!) until you try it this way first.  My 13 yr old on the other hand didn't care for it and added honey to his servings.

A great recipe for using up the rest of the sweet potatoes before they went bad! I've done sweet potato fries many times, but wanted something different and something that went well with my chicken and black bean enchiladas. It was a perfect combination!

Mashed Chipotle Sweet Potatoes Haiku: "Not too thrilled with these. Needed WAY more chipotles, for that smoky heat." I disagree w/ so many of the reviews adding brown sugar - that's what makes this recipe unique is that it's not another sweet, sweet, sweet potato side dish. The sweetness of the potato itself should be enough to jive w/ the chipotles in adobo, alas, there wasn't enough oomph from just a mere tablespoon. If I made this again, I'd do as frazzled's review states and double or even triple the chipotle, along w/ more of the adobo sauce too.

Great taste--used chipotle chile powder as I didn't have any canned chiles and it was delicious (added a sprinkle of garlic powder as well)
