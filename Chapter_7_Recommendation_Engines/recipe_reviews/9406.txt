The recipe I use is 1 c. sugar, 1 c. dark corn syrup, 1 tbl. vinagar and 1 Tbl of soda. I bring the first 3 ing. to 300 deg. then add soda. I line a 9 x 13 pan with parchment paper and spray it with pam. When you pour the hot candy into the pan do not spread it. It will spread itself and let cool completely for about 1 hour before you remove it. After it has cooled remove from pan and remove parchment. Break into pieces. Dip into chocolate.This recipe does work if you follow the directions. Also invest in a candy themometor.

Finally!  After a long, hard search for a good "Seafoam" candy recipe (not to mention three batches that turned out more like divinity than what I was trying to make), I have found it!  After breaking the candy into pieces, I dipped them in chocolate like you would get if you bought this at the store.  Yummy!  By the way, to the people who complained about this being "too hard": it's supposed to be hard!  That's why you cook it to the *hard crack* stage.  One hint is to line your pan with foil and butter or spray it well so you can just lift the candy out when it's set.

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! my younger sisters and brothers have a lot of food allergies, as well as being finicky eaters.  but they gobbled this up at light speed!  one promise that i'll make this turns them into ANGELS!  i made it in the microwave n it turned out perfectly.  I scaled the recipe to 1, would put it in for 11 second intervals, stirring after each one.  for those who like it crunchy, i put it over ice, n those who like it chewy can wait for it to be cool enough to handle.  Incredibly quick and easy!  Wonderful maple flavor and you can play around with temperature and cooling time to alter consistancy.

This attempt, I took the advice to line the pan with sprayed foil.  Took it off heat at 290-295...It turned out perfect.  Doesn't stick to my teetch as much as the last batch did...I've eaten so much already that my mouth is getting sore...This is really good stuff!

I really like this, it was quick and easy to make. Clean-up was a snap. Altough mine is really hard and crunchy, next time I might not wait until it is 300 degrees stop it at 270. But it is definetly worth it!

If you like the taste of toasted marshmallows, this recipe is for you!  Beware-you won't be able to stop eating these though!  Fun for kids to make (with help) and fun to eat.  I found that not everyone is fond of the taste, but for those that do, they're addicting.

This was my first attempt at candymaking and a dismal failure. I think the sugar must have got burnt; the whole thing looked and tasted quite disgusting. I don't think it's the recipe's fault, though - just a warning to the inexperienced, you may have trouble with this! Be prepared to waste some maple syrup before you get it right!

This recipe was great! So easy to make, it requires nothing but the time waiting for the temp to rise. Not great for my young kids, but my husband and I love it. This will definetly be in my gift baskets this year!

I don't like this recipe.  It tastes too much like the soda.  My husband and grandparents loved it though.

I LOVE maple sponge candy, but not the price of it (if you can find it).  This recipe makes it easy and fun to make your own!  I live in Maine and maple syrup is plentiful, and often gifted by friends who tap trees, so I used real maple syrup instead of the maple flavored variety.  Nothing like the real thing.

A few words of caution - once you add the baking powder it more than doubles in size, and begins to cool and becomes immobile very quickly.  I made a double batch at first, and it bubbled up over the edge of the pan!  I had to scoop some of it into another pan, and in the process made it less bubbly - that's why it says "don't spread" - it just makes a mess and may ruin the effect of the "sponge."  Moral of the story - if you want a larger amount of candy - make two separate batches, or use a large pot and pan to hold the mixture.  And work quickly!  

I plan to dip some of mine in chocolate.  Because - chocolate!

I'm pretty sure I did everything right, but this candy was much more brittle than I had hoped.  It had a great taste, but you wound up picking it out of your teeth for an hour after eating a piece!  I don't know if it should be cooked a to a little bit lower temperature, or if there are retrictions on how much to stir after you add the soda or what, but I will not make this one again. Also, maybe the fact that I live at 5500 feet made a difference? Thanks anyway for the recipe!

Very easy to make, but it turned out so hard that it's almost impossible to eat.  It's not like the sponge candy that I remember.

Yum Yum Yum. This was my first successful attempt at sponge candy..i followed the recipe exactly, only I used parchment paper in the pan for easy cleanup. This was a huge success!

Not as foamy as I would have liked, hopefully that will come with practice.  This was delicious with real maple syrup.  This NEEDS the sprayed foil as recommended... a greased pan is not enough.

This recipe was great, and easy.  I let mine cook a bit too long and ended up with most of it being burned.. but the few parts that I was able to taste were great... I'll have to try this again and make sure to really keep my eye on the thermometer.

I followed the recipe to the "t" and came out with a pan full of cement that I cannot even chip out!!!  This is not the sponge candy that I remember.  The one we had as kids was crunchy but would melt in your mouth...in the meantime I will get out the blow torch and try to save my pan.

Here in Buffalo, NY, Sponge Candy is dipped in chocolate.  I use this base recipe to make 22 different flavors of the candy, which is rare here.  Most people like sponge dipped in dark chocolate, milk chocolate or peanut butter chocolate.  I have flavors like Espresso, S'mores, Cookies & Creme, Caramel Banana, Raspberry Almond, Cherry Cordial, Coconut Caramel, Candy Apple, Krispy Krunch, Red Velvet, Mint Chocolate, Maple Walnut, Lemon Creme, Creamsicle,  Orange Chocolate, and more.  We like it crunchy here, so I do cook it to 300.

I read the others' reviews and lined my pan with buttered tin foil, and I didn't let the candy get all the way to 300 degrees. Also, since I live in the south, where cane sugar is abundant, I used cane syrup instead of maple syrup. It came out a little chewy on the outside and a little crunchy on the inside, and it tastes just like Cracker Jacks. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Made it to the letter recipe but it didn't rise. "Hard as a rock" slab of brittle sans the peanuts. 
I don't believe stirred the soda in long enough. 
I will try again though.

Wasn't a fan of the flavor and some pieces were too dense for my liking. All the pieces ended up sticking together  in the jar. Threw the whole batch out. Made more using other's suggestions and didn't like those either. Will stick to buying from a confectioner's store

I enjoyed flavor of this candy!! The only thing I would recommended is not using candy thermonmeter and just waiting until syrup mixture comes to a boil. On the first attempt I allowed syrup mixture to boil at referred temperature, but candy came at hard and burnlike, but on the second attempt I did not use the candy thermonmeter and only allowed mixture to boil for three minutes prior to adding baking soda and then allow it to set in refrigerator for a few hours. Candy came out decent afterwards, and I was able to break them into nicer pieces.

I used 3/4 C Dark Corn Syrup, and 1/4 C Maple flavored Syrup instead of the full cup of maple syrup.  It turned out wonderfully!  Great recipe, thanks for posting it!

I don't know what went wrong but I followed the recipe verbatim. It wasn't solid it turned to powder when I went to break it.

I had to literally chisel this out of the pan, even after greasing it. After it was out all the pieces sort of melted together (room temp) into a puddle. I thought it supposed to be more sponge like and brittle. No one ate it and we ended up throwing it away. It did taste okay if you sucked on it, but it was too much effort to get a small piece unstuck from a large one. I followed this recipe exactly. Maybe some people got better results because of the humidity in the room???

Hard? Cement? Mine came out like chewing gum... not sure what happened wrong, I'm trying to fix it in the oven but I don't think it's going so well :-) The gooey stuff tastes good and looks spongey but I wish mine were hard!!!

This is fun to make.  Turned out just like seafoam candy. I loved the smell of the maple syrup cooking, sort of like being in the middle of a pine forest.
