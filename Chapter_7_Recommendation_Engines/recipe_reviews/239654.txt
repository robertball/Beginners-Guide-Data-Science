I love this recipe! I make it every week! I only use it for the meatballs though and then just use a jar of Prego. We use our leftovers to make meatball subs! So yummy!

I only made the meatballs in this recipe cause we already have a sauce we love. They were great. Our kids loved them. They said they were the best I have ever made.

I cook for a large group of senior citizens. they told me two meatballs were great, but the sauce was a bit spicy. my own opinion is it was very good but I like spicy stuff.

Another hit for my husband. He asked me what was in this so two thumbs up for this recipe. I loved how it tasted like great marinara sauce and only made me want pizza.

I just made this and it was soo good... I seasoned mine more to make it more spicy but other than that I followed the recipe
