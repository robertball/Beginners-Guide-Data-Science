Very good!!! I added a small amount of seasoning salt when cooking the chicken and made a cream sauce with milk and the ranch for the rice.

Comfort food! I have made this several times and this time I decided to change it up a bit.  I added 8 oz of cream cheese and an entire packet of ranch, I also subsituted chicken broth for the milk and slow cooked it in the crockpot.  Instead of rice I made mashed potatoes.

At first I thought there was too much sauce for the amount of chicken in the recipe.  But when you serve the sauce over the rice, the proportion is just right.  This is very good.

Great recipe! Easy to follow, and tastes great! I did not have the ranch dressing on hand, but it tasted just fine without it; so I cannot wait to try the recipe with it! :)

This chicken did taste very good, but as I suspected it was too salty.  The dressing mix has a lot of sodium.

Excellent recipe! The second time I made it, I just made normal rice and put the extra ranch in with the chicken

This was really good! Even my super-picky husband loved it. We both thought it would be great with white wine. I am just learning how to cook and this is one of the first recipes I made. It was really easy and quick. I will definitely make it again!

Nothing about this was good.  Ranch rice may sound good but it was not. Will not be doing this one again

Fantastic!! Loved it! However, I used 2 1/4 C water for the 1 C of rice and it was very watery, so I just added more rice. I added more Ranch to the rice than the recommended 1/2 packet, and an 8 oz of cream cheese to the chicken as is cooked for those 10 minutes. Super good. Will definately cook this again.

I was scared at first for all the ranch seasoning being used (I was doing the chicken and rice) but it came out good. I also didnt have a can of mushroom so instead I used a can of condensed cream of potato. While I was a little scared how it was going to turn out, I came out great! Dont know how to compare until next time when I use the can of mushroom. Hopefully just as good!

Great fast and easy recipe! My family loved it. I didn't have long grain rice but minute rice was a good substitute.
