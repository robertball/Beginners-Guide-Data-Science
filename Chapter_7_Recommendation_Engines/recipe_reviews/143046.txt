Pretty decent recipe. I didn't have heavy cream on hand, which most of the sweet corn tomalito (pudding) recipes call for, so it was good to see that MILK was called for in this recipe. With the MILK it worked out just fine and this recipe was good indeed. We like our tomalito sweet so I did top it off with a swirl of honey on top before scooping it out to serve. YUM!

This is just like we've had at a local restaurant that moved out of town. Love this recipe!
