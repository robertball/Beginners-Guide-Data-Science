Absolutely ridiculous!! The thyme is an unexpected and stellar addition. The only change I made was to soak the cut potatoes in very hot tap water for 10 minutes, then I dried them with a smooth kitchen towel before tossing them with the spices and fat. This accomplishes a few things that improve the final product. First, it rinses off excess starch from the surface which prevents the leathery, mottled, overbrowned skin that often forms on oven fries. See the picture above. The skin will be thin and crispy, evenly golden if you do the soak. Secondly, it starts the cooking process, which seals the moisture inside the potatoes, so that while the outside crisps, the inside stays delightfully soft and fluffy. That's a winning combination, obviously. Thirdly, by sealing the outside, the amount of fat that soaks in (and which you ingest) is minimized. The fat adds a subtle, complex layer of flavor that just isn't there with fries cooked in vegetable fat. Yeah, yeah, I know. Cholesterol. Just so long as you don't make a habit of them, which is admittedly a temptation, the occasional indulgence won't be a big deal. Trust me. They'll be fighting over who gets the last couple.

yes, i made some changes...i boiled the potatoes as suggested by another site for 5mins, drained them in a colander & banged them a bit in the process which it suggested roughens the surface allowing for greater browning & absorption of the duck fat.  roasted them as chef john suggested.  only complaint was i hadn't made enough.  i love chef john.

Made it with russet potatoes followed directions exactly and they turned out great, crunchy outside and creamy inside. Best oven potato wedges I have made. Also works well with sweet potatoes but there not as crunchy.

As with all things Chef-John, this was a winner.  
Last time I made it, I used sweet potatoes.  Boiled the fries until close to being done, drained and dried.  Sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on the fries.
Was a great compliment to bourbon glazed salmon and raspberry broccoli.

These are a go to favorite with steak.  I don't know where to even get duck fat so I use olive oil instead and the potatoes come out great every time.

I just made these using olive oil since I didn't happen to have any duck fat on hand. I also used Yukon gold and red potatoes.  Turned out FANTASTIC!!  Will make again and again!!  :)  Thanks!
