I didn't have bow ties so I used rigatoni thinking the sauce would fill the tubes of the pasta making each bite an explosion of flavor. I was so so so right. Dinner was 5 star and lunch for every one was a 5 star heaven. I will make this again.

This is the only pasta recipe I usually make. We can't afford to eat pasta very much - so when we do I have to make sure it is a GREAT recipe!  The sweet Italian sausage makes it worth all of the carbs!

WOW!!this  is now one of my families favorite recipes! I did change the sausage to J.C. Potters hot breakfast sausage simply because that's what we like!Everthing else I tried to follow closely but could not find but (no KIDDING)2 twigs of basil--so I used that and added 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil and that worked very well. I was lucky enough to have fresh garden tomatoes and believe fresh is always better if possible.This is a very addicting recipe and oh so good!!I gave dd and sil half (it Made A lot),Sil said he could eat the whole bowl--- We ALL agreed*****

Although I made some alterations I did not change the core of the recipe and this was a family approved recipe. I used ground hot sausage  instead of sweet out of family preference. I used heavy cream because that is what I could find. Penne instead of bow ties because I did not realize I was out. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh but when reading the directions it sounds like either fresh or canned could be used. Lastly dried basil instead of fresh because I could not find any locally. Fresh basil would have been better but it was still a tasty sauce with the dried.

De-lish! I used Half & Half for the cream and a can of diced tomatoes, drained. Also, I didn't have quite enough fresh basil, so I also added a little dried - believe me when I say I'm no fresh vs. dried herb snob, but the Fresh Basil really made the difference. I will definitely make this again. I really love the "light" consistency of the sauce with the tomato & basil. Thanks, Johnsonville Kitchens!

We highly recommend this flavorful, attractive and possibly kid-friendly dish for a quick week night dinner, a nonlaborous dish to serve guests and it is quite budget friendly, a real positive in these tiemes! The excellent quality of the Johnsonville sausage made all the difference in this dish. For personal preference only, next time I will decrease the pasta to 2 cups and leave all other ingredients the same.

This is a recipe I have used for years, except we use heavy cream, it is richer.  It is a family favorite and I highly recommend it. We also add 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and instead of fresh tomatoes, we use 1 11oz. can of petite diced tomatoes. Anyway you do it, you will love it. (We also use 1/2 cup of parmesan instead of what the above recipe states)

Beautiful dish with great flavors. The basil cream sauce is really nice. Couldn't find "light cream," so I used regular cream for whipping. (Heavy cream.) I would make this one again. Very, very good!

My Family loves this pasta infused with basil, light cream and Parmesan cheese.  We prefer the smaller bowtie pasta in this dish. I am adding this Johnsonville recipe to the Keeper List. Everyone in my family ate this pasta including my five year old granddaughter.

I loved everything about this dish.  It was fast and easy to prepare, but most importantly, it was delicious.  I improvised a little adding extra pasta, using a can of diced tomatoes and dried basil for the sauce, and it was excellent, boosted by the quality of the sausage.  This is a perfect week night meal.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  The only complaint I had was from the kids who thought it was too hot, and I have to agree (but I don't care for spicy things in general).  Next time, I will cut back on the red pepper flakes or omit them altogether.  As for ease, you can't get much simpler than this.  My 8 year old daughter helped me with almost every step of the recipe.  I paired the dish with some garlic bread sticks.  Delish!

I used 2 links of Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage and 2 links of their hot sausage.  I wanted the heat, but I didn't want to overwhelm the basil flavor.  Then I discovered I hadn't bought the bow tie pasta, so I improvised and used wide egg noodles (I know, right?)  Success!  We all enjoyed dinner and there is enough for a lunch that will only have improved with time.  Thanks, Johnsonville Kitchens!

Very nice pasta dish . . . even my Italian hubby like it!  We used orecchiette, or "little ears" pasta, instead of the bowtie.  In a recipe like this, I prefer to use the Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage that is packaged in bulk (without the casings), as I like the way it crumbles when browning.  I did add a bit of my homemade marinara sauce (at hubs request), which was a nice addition.  Buon Appetito!

Amazing!  The only thing I did differently was added some 4 Cheese Itailian blend shredded and used a little less basil, about a 1/4 cup.  Other than that I followed it exactly and it was fantastic!

This didn't wow me. I guess I was expecting a lot after all the super positive reviews. In fact for me it's a 3 star, but my husband and son really liked it so I'm rating it a 4. However, I highly doubt I'll ever make it again......UPDATE--When putting this in my husbands lunch, I tasted it cold from the fridge and thought it tasted really good! For me this recipe tastes much better cold or even reheated leftovers were good enough to give a 4 from me. I think the flavors having time to meld was key.

Absolutely delicious meal.  And so, so easy to throw together.  If you're looking for something you can get on the table within 30 minutes, definitely try this.  My husband said he wasn't very hungry, and he went back for seconds.  Since it's only two of us, I used 3 sausages, kept everything else the same and it was perfect. I did use a fresh tomato and fresh basil.  No leftovers for us.  I love Johnsonville products, and this one will be a repeat for sure.

OMG this was delicious. I was out of bow tie pasta (which is weird because I always have it on hand), so I used shell pasta instead. I also forgot to put the cream, but it was extremely delicious without it. Probably a lot healthier too. The last thing I did different also was I added about 7 sweet peppers chopped up and omitted the pepper flakes. I wanted sweet and not spicy. The peppers added such a beautiful color and flavor. My husband ate 4 plates of this. He told me to make this recipe a staple.

We loved it!  I doubled the recipe (we love leftovers) and used extra diced tomatoes (since I wasn't sure how many to buy to get the amount called for in the recipe- ha ha ha). We kept the pasta separate since it always soaks up the sauce when combined and stored. Absolutely delicious. I can't wait to make it again when our garden tomatoes are in. Thanks

This was very good! I used mild Johnsonville sausage the other day, and hands down the sweet sausage is much better! I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I would make, if I made it again is I would not add the basil. I find fresh basil to be very dominant and this was no exception. It is pricy at this time of the year anyway. This was easy to make and tasted as good or better than any similar dish at a fancy Italian restaurant.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I hate was I didn't have sweet sausage. I used mild and it was way too spicy. The only thing I would add next time is sun dried tomatoes and some mozzarella cheese. I am a cheese lover though! This is a great recipe!

I have to preface this review with a disclaimer (or two):  I hate sausage.  A lot.  As an Allrecipes Brand Ambassador, Johnsonville asked us to give their recipes a try.  I was dreading it.  I bought all of the ingredients, came home from work, and...poured myself a drink.  I considered bagging our dinner plan and eating leftover pizza, instead.  However, I decided to make myself get busy in the kitchen and I'm so glad I did.  Not only did this come together in LESS than 15 minutes (probably closer to 10), but it was also quite tasty, even for a sausage hater like me.  Now, I must admit, I used the wrong Johnsonville sausage because I couldn't locate what the recipe called for in our grocery store (I ended w/a New Orleans links).  It wouldn't "decase" for me, so I simply chopped it and continued from there.  THANK YOU for dinner, johnsonville!

This recipe was good; it was cheaper to use jarred Alfredo sauce than it was to buy cream.  It tasted good but its not so good you would get asked for the recipe.   It is not memorable in any way and I doubt it would have been if I used the light cream instead.  The kids did eat it though; so that is worth a few stars.

Very tasty!! Followed the recipe except grilled the sausage on the BBQ along with zuchinni and red and green bell peppers.  Then chopped sausage and veggies and added to the sauce with pasta.  Worked out perfectly since I boiled the pasta and made the sauce while my husband grilled. We used hot italian sausage, but will try a different sausage next time, just for variety.

Wonderful! Quick and easy. My husband likes to make a great sauce and simmer all day. I told him about this receipt and requested it for dinner. He wanted to cook and was surprised at how quick and easy it was, I did have to convince him not to reduce the sauce too much! He did add some white wine and bumped up the red pepper and added pecorino romano (our favorite) when served, excellent meal. We will be having this again. :)

So delicious! I only used 3 of the 5 sausages in the pack to cut down on calories. Also, added some flour to the end product to make the sauce a little thicker. I couldn't find the sweet sausage so just used mild Italian instead. It was just the right amount of spice. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly!

I read a bunch of the reviews and took on a couple of suggestions when I made this yesterday.  I put in canned diced tomatoes and a half of a can of sweet peppers and only used 6 oz of already de-cased sausage (thanks reviewers!).  Instead of cream, I used sour cream (my idea :) - all my guests had 3 servings and LOVED it!  Thanks :)

I really enjoy this dish. I absolutely hate tomatoes but in this dish I use stewed tomatoes or diced tomatoes. I sometimes cut them up more so the pieces aren't as big. I have made this about 3 times at home and it's a hit. This week is my week to make lunch for my department and this is what I will be making. I hope they enjoy it as much as I do.

Have made this twice. Super yummy both times. The first time I used dried basil and some spinach I had on-hand; just enough spinach to add some color. The second time, I made the meat/sauce the day before. I had some half and half and some heavy whipping cream I needed to use up, so combined those to make the 1-1/2 cups light cream called for. The next day as I boiled the pasta it occurred to me that mushrooms might be a nice addition, so I caramelized some sliced, fresh 'shrooms, and when they were ready, added the meat/sauce. When that was hot I added the fresh basil and cooked pasta, and about 1/4 cup of 2% milk as the sauce was getting a little thick. The fresh basil flavor combined with the Johnsonville Italian Sweet Sausage and just the touch of heat from the red pepper flakes is truly sensational.  Served this with a salad of greens dressed with oil and Balsamic Vinegar, Craisins, and grated fresh Parmesan.  Hubby and I love this recipe.

I have made this several times now as it has become a favorite in our house! The only thing I am doing differently now than when I first started is to pull back on the red chili flakes (for a bit less heat) and add more cream. The sauce is so delicious we prefer to have a bit more of it to go around. Thank you!

My husband and I both loved this. I did have to cook the sauce a little longer to thicken it up but it was well worth the extra few min!!!
We have also tried it with some added mushrooms.... YUM!

I really liked this! I think it is imperative to use fresh ingredients (tomatoes, basil, etc.) to really get the full effect...the fresh basil definitely made a big difference! I thought this was marvelous and made it exactly as written other than adding chopped fresh mushrooms into the mix. Thanks, Johnsonville. You made me feel like a gourmet Italian chef today. :)

This was really great and very simple to make. I used a little extra garlic, just cause I like garlic so much. And I added a little diced sweet pepper just cause I had some left over from breakfast and it added some nice color and crunch. Just for convenience I used canned diced Italian tomatoes, including the juice and it worked fine though fresh tomatoes would have been so much prettier.
I wouldn't make any major tweaks to this one. It's just great.

I came cross this recipe when searching for recipes using Italian sausage and am glad I did. It tastes great and is quick to cook. The recipe only serves 4 instead of 5 in my household but I only use 3  sausage links (hot ones, we like it spicy) instead of 5. It's also versatile enough that you can make substitutions based on what you have on hand. At times I've subbed dried basil for fresh, heavy cream for light cream, canned diced tomatoes for fresh, ground cayenne pepper for red pepper flakes and penne rigate for bowtie pasta and it always turns out good.

Great Recipe!  My husband loved it!  I used fat free half and half in place of the light cream and it was perfect.  This will definitely become a "go to" recipe.

The recipe was pretty amazing -- I used dried basil instead of fresh, and the sauce still came out brilliant.  My daughter thought that it could be a little creamier, but my son advised that it was perfect the way it was.  Either way, the taste was phenomenal, so powerful and flavorful.  5 stars ++++.

Easy and delicious dinner! I took the suggestion of another reviewer, and only used three of the five sausages in the package. I felt this made for just the right amount of sausage in the dish. Also, my grocery store had sold out of the sweet sausage, so I used the mild and just omitted the red pepper flakes. The flavor was rich, and served with a salad, made for a really enjoyable dinner. Will make this again!

Delicious! I have been making this for years and it’s my most requested item. Even my Italian cousins say it’s the best dish. It’s great to even make the sauce ahead of time, freeze and then heat and serve.

FANTASTIC! I didn't have quite as much basil as called for, but it worked out fine, and used a mix of heavy cream (I had some to use up) and half and half. Also, I chose to add the tomatoes right before serving b/c I don't like when the skins peel off into the sauce...next time I'm gonna try it w/ canned diced tomatoes, well drained, and see how that workes out. Little guy chose campanelle shaped pasta over the bowties, which was a great choice. I was glad that I waited before adding the salt b/c it really didn't need it, IMO. The whole family raved over dinner tonight, which makes this a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

There is a reason this recipe is getting 5 stars!  It is delicious!  Make a whole batch so you have enough leftover for lunch the next day because you will want some!  I love to use a combo of Johnsonville All Natural Mild and Hot Ground Sausage because it gives it just the right amount of heat for even little guys to savor--in which case I didn't add the red pepper flakes.  Fresh basil is an absolute must in this recipe!  This will be on my menu for next week for sure!  Thanks, Johnsonville!

I have made this recipe many times and think it's fantastic. I use cherry tomatoes and add fresh veggies (zucchini, mushrooms, asparagus…anything that adds nice colors.). Since I am adding more volume to the dish I double the cream and parmesan cheese. Every time I make this dish everyone is very impressed!

It was pretty easy and quick to prepare. Believe it or not, all I had were beer brats!  I removed the casing and it still tasted delicious. I used a large can of whole tomatoes and sliced them since I didn't have fresh tomatoes.  I also used a bit of the juice from the tomatoes for extra sauce and a little extra half and half to make sure it was creamy and not too tomato based.  I would make this again as a tasty budget friendly dish.

Amazing.....we subbed for hot sausage and it worked out well.  Trying sun-dried tomoatoes the second time out....oh and don't forget to wait on the basil till last.  First time out I put in during the reduction and it lost a lot of flavor.

I made this dish last night and my family loved it! I modified this receipe slightly by not putting in the red pepper flakes and I used heavy cream instead of light.  The sauce was just rich enough not too heavy.  Try this receipe your family will love it too!

Awesome!!!! I made it exactly as stated on the recipe the first time, and it was great! The second time, I replace the fresh tomatoes with two 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes, and the heavy cream with half and half, and it was still awesome! I didn't want to go to the store, and these substitutions definitely worked!!

Just Made This Tonight For Dinner. It Is Awesome. I Did Not Like The
Look Of The Fresh Basil At The SuperMarket, so I Had To Use Dry. Still
Came Out Very Good. But I Will Be Using Fresh Basil If At All Possible. It Was Quick To Put Together, And Very Little Mess. A
WonderFul Recipe. Thank You From Florida!

This recipe is kick-as*!  It gets thumbs up every time I make it.  If I want to impress someone, I make this.  You will not be disappointed.  The flavours are incredible.  Even for my fussy "I don't like sausage" eater, she eats it and says it's good!
