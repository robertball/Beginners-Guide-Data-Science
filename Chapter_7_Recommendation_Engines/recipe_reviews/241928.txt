Great flavor and worth the extra step of making the filling. I melted milk chocolate with a dab of coconut oil and the subtle flavor really made these treats extra special.

I made these in a 9x13" pan, more like Peanut Butter Rice Krispie Treat Bars with Chocolate Frosting, and cut them into squares. I completely left out the yolk part, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Very Yummy!!

This was really, really good. Just be careful to make sure the “yolks” are really chilled before starting to make the “whites.” I froze them for a while and they worked out really well.

I did not put the chocolate on these as I was having a melt down with wax paper vs parchment paper on another recipe but these were excellent without the chocolate.  By the way, DON'T use wax paper for parchment paper.  :(
