Wonderful!  Used fresh sauteed spinach, 5 eggs, and used feta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  Made this for guests and they took home the recipe!

I doubled the recipe for 6 guests and it was a huge hit. There were enough leftovers for a happy repeat at lunchtime. The swiss and cheddar cheeses really make the dish.

Very tasty but a bit runny.
