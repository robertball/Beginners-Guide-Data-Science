I made one change which I will explain but this is excellent. I went to the specialty store and told the lady what I was making. She recommended a shrimp paste in a tube over the dried salted shrimp. She said the flavor was better, the tube had a longer shelf, and the texture would be better. So, with that being said, that is what I did. This was great! In my honest opinion I think anchovy paste would work in this too.
