Excellent recipe and easy.  Chef John ponders the question in the video of how to figure out how to have the bacon cook to done at the same time as the Porchetta.  I think I solved this: Try using the pre-cooked bacon from the supermarket. It is somewhat cooked but still flexible enough to wrap the raw Porchetta and does the bacon part well when the Porchetta is cooking. Worked for me.  No changes EVER!

I just made this for my family tonight and it is an absolute delicious burst of flavor! The pork was cooked perfectly using the suggested times. So juicy and tender! And the flavors of the rub are in perfect harmony! My girlfriend found it to be a little too spicy with the pepper flakes so if you're sensitive about spicy foods then you might want to cut back on that. Overall, one of the best recipes I've made on this site so far!

I made a version of this on the weekend. Used the recipe for the rub. Made a lattice of 12 bacon strips, wrapped the tenderloin, then wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerated 24 hours. Cooked in a smoker at 220 for about 4 hours until internal temp was 145. Flavor and texture was perfect. Thanks for the inspiration!

Simple yet elegant recipe? Made this  9/2/2017. WOW!!!  Used all the ingredients that Chef John used, except dry (didn't have fresh herbs) but did cut down the amount  of rub we put on the loin, as we had a very small one.  The whole family loved it, requested again for tonights dinner? Thanks Chef John for another Delish meal.

You can prep it a day ahead and then just pop it in oven the day of.  Instead of wrapping in bacon, I used thin-sliced Italian prosciutto bc I had some I needed to use up.  Each package of tenderloin actually has TWO one-lb pork tenderloins in it.  I needed 2 lbs of meat minimum, so I just butterflied each tenderloin into a 3-part foldout, making it a flat piece of meat. Then I dovetailed one edge of a tenderloin slightly over the other, making it as if it were one piece laid flat.  I then proceeded as recipe states and added the herb paste (which I doubled), then rolled it up and wrapped it in prosciutto.  It worked out well to give me a larger piece of meat I needed. When you cut into it, you see a coiled spiral of filling inside. Very impressive.  The prosciutto crisps up every bit as nicely as bacon would. I'd make it again.  Cooks quickly too.

The most delicious pork tenderloin I have ever had.  I never change anything the first time I make something from a recipe and this one did not disappoint.  Cooked perfectly to medium - so tender and juicy.  The flavor is amazing, but very bold.  I love the idea of the bacon lattice (perhaps cook it for a few minutes and cool before wrapping the loin.  Make certain that your rub has been rubbed into a paste is a key to the success of this recipe as well as using a large enough piece of meat.  Thank you Chef John

This was so good .. I did tweak it a bit. I added a little extra of all the ingredients to add some to the outer piece. I also added some Dijon mustard and cumin. I used cracked pepper crusted bacon to wrap it with.

This is an excellent set of instructions for a very good recipe, typical of Chef John.  I need to tailor my seasoning ratios to suit my own tastes, or the quality of my herbs, because mine came out strong on lemon and rosemary, balanced on salt and pepper (I used only half the recommended amount of pepper), and light on fennel and sage.  Also, 31 minutes (not 25) left the inside perfectly cooked and the bacon a bit rare.  Next time I'll plan to spend a minute or two broiling it to get the finish I like.

Wow. I’ve followed Chef John for years and he is one of the best there is. I’ve made this twice now. I’ve been wrapping things in bacon for years and there are some tricks to it. First, par cook the bacon for say 25 minutes on 325 between 2 sheet pans or something to keep it flat. I use parchment paper in between as well. That doesn’t cook the bacon fully. I then wrap the loins and  cook at 375 until an internaL temp of about 128-130. I do this to then broil on high, both sides of the roast to crisp the bacon up, about 5 minutes a side is all that needed. My temp turns out around 140 when I pull it out which goes up to 145-148 after resting. I also doubled the spice mixture because I make two tenderloins at a time with this recipe. Excellent recipe though. I added no additional ingredients. Thanks John.

This was so tender and juicy. Really good. My tenderloin came in two long pieces so I put them together and wrapped them. Took an additional 5 minutes and then I couldn’t find my flamethrower so I put the broiler on for a couple of minutes and it was amazing

Really super delish.  Next time I plan to cut down on the salt and add some extra red pepper flakes.  Also make sure to have the ends of the bacon underneath the tenderloin otherwise they will curl up. :-(

Mine took a LOT longer than 25 minutes to cook. Not sure what I did wrong, once it was cooked though, it was good, I'll try it again later.

Made this exactly as recipe directed and I am thoroughly impressed. My Nona made porchetta for Sunday family dinners. It was always delicious and flavorful. Chef John’s baby porchetta is a great adaptation to traditional porchetta. The meat is tender and juicy, while the season paste is bursting with flavor. Your kitchen will smell absolutely amazing. What does it say about a recipe when the bacon is almost an afterthought?!

I didn't use the fennel because I didn't have any. However I added fresh dill weed. My fathers family are from Northern Italy and only used dill, garlic, salt and pepper.

My son literally loved this!  I made small roasted red potatoes and this fresh carrot recipe I have.  I have to admit, I hate Fennel, so omitted it.   It still came out really nice!, but I really hate the flavor of Fennel, lol.  Im pretty sure my kids never had it until they left home and someon else served it.

I used a 2 1/2 lb loin roast so lowered the temp and cooked longer till meat thermometer read 145. If I do it again, which I probably will, I will be sure to use thinly sliced bacon. I used thick-sliced and it didn’t brown as much as I would have liked. Or, maybe,  do without the bacon altogether. I might also reduce the red paper flake. The rub has a wonderful flavor but was a bit spicy for me. Overall very happy with the roast.

Simple to make. Very nice, I tripled it for a dinner party and was very good. Next time I will use less rosemary as the taste was very strong.

What a wonderful entree!  As many have said, the flavor explosion is amazing.  Keep an eye on the internal temperature thermometer, because it hits its peak  temperature quickly.

Super tender and zesty. I had to adapt the recipe a little based on the herbs I already had in my spice rack.

I felt that the pepper was too strong so I will cut back.  Also the sage didn't loose its bitter raw taste with the short cooking time.  Any remedies to counteract ct the bitter taste?
