I love the flavor of the cheesecake filling -- I used a graham cracker crust, which I think will work fine. I like that the recipe follows a standard cheesecake base. I also like that it's no-bake and look forward to slicing into it tomorrow :) Also, the use of vanilla is fantastic with the coconut milk. I used a thick coconut milk instead of a cream.

Hubby LOVES vanilla bean cheesecake and he loves coconut. I was sure he'd love this, but we both agree it was only so-so. I did make 2 changes: used pecans instead of almonds (personal preference) and I accidentally used coconut milk instead of coconut cream. The texture was way too soft, even after chilling overnight, and we wound up having to freeze it to make it more palatable. Even frozen it didn't hold together all that well. Using cream, as directed, will definitely improve texture, but I'm not sure by how much. Hubby felt like the yogurt taste was too strong, too. I think the brand of yogurt is key to the success of this recipe, both for texture and flavor. We both liked the blueberry sauce.
