This fish was excellent!  I did make a few changes though.  I put a little bit of extra virgin olive oil on the fish and salt and pepper before baking it.  I turned the broiler on for about 2 minutes after the 20 minutes was up.  I used half the butter and did not add tomato to the sauce.  Instead, I added extra lemon juice and fresh parsley.  This recipe is certainly a keeper!!!

Awesome! I had cod on hand but made per recipe.  Wow was it great. Fixed over steamed veggies. I have to admit it didn't sound so great with just a few ingredients but I was totally wrong. I did add a little more hot sauce and black pepper the second helping. Very easy to make. Like the commercial, I ate the whole thing myself. Keeper for sure. Thanks, Becca for sharing.

This is certainly a wonderful dish, easy to prepare, little cleanup, and not overly filling.  Rice as a side dish and a green salad or coleslaw add just enough to complete the meal.  I purchase my mahi-mahi frozen at Costco.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I doubled this recipe to feed a larger group. The next time I make it, I will half the butter. There is way more sauce than is needed and it was too buttery/greasy. Reducing the butter would solve both issues. I set the fish on a bed of seasoned rice (I make my own seasoning) and this did wonders to soak up the sauce. We did sprinkle some lemon pepper on the fish after trying it as is and found this gave it JUST the zing we were looking for. This would be a great sauce for shrimp! Especially grilled.

What a delightful sauce!  I used cod because that's what I had in the freezer, and sprinkled with lemon pepper before baking.  I didn't have green onions on hand, so sauteed minced sweet onions on low while the butter was melting.  The Louisiana hot sauce added a wonderful zing!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Delicious! You can use any good white fish. I usually use halibut since my husband goes spear fishing a lot. You can also grill the fish and add some shrimp skewers and serve it on top of a bed of rice then pour the "Accidental" sauce over it. I know a lot of people complain about how much butter is in the sauce but you don't have to use it all- this is just how Bubba Gump's fish co. makes it.

I wasn't thrilled with this one.   It was fair.  I think adding a little vermouth might help improve the depth of the flavor.  Fish was rather bland.  I wonder if frying it instead of baking it would help.

I really liked this dish.   The mahi mahi was reasonably priced and I got a nice filet.   I simmer the butter, garlic, tomato and instead of green onion I used fresh parsley and fresh thyme.  I skipped the hot sauce but just because of the fresh herbs.  I didn't add lemon juice to this sauce but gave everyone a fresh lemon wedge when I served it.

I was worried about using 450F so I did 400 and just baked it longer.

Made an asparagus au gratin for the side.

What a great sauce base. I did things a little different like others.  I grilled salmon rubbed with EVOO and lemon pepper.  Sliced and grilled the romas, a thick sliced white onion and some baby portabellas, they got chopped fine and added to the sauce. (Lots of Frank’s)
I served it all up on a bed of spinach sautéed with olive oil, fresh garlic and sliced almonds, and a grill-baked sweet potato.
I cut the butter in half.  (Did I mention I love my grill?)
Thanks for posting!

used on Tilapia and it was AWESOME. Cut the butter in half and helped not be as greasy since the fish steaks were thinner. Added a little Cayenne to kick it up a notch too.

I've tried many great recipes from this site in the last three years, but this is the first that made me want to do a review for. Awesome! I don't think you'll want to leave out the tomatoes, I may half the butter next time, add some lemon pepper and give it a couple more drops of hot sauce.

Simple and delicious!  I used Barramundi which is a sustainable replacement for sea bass and other mild white fish.  For 2 portions I used 2 T each of butter and Brummel & Brown lower fat butter.  I microwaved the sauce because it was so hot in the kitchen.  My fish cooked in 10 minutes because it was a thinner filet.  I kept the other ingredients the same for the sauce and it was wonderful.
This will be a go-to staple in our kitchen!

It was good but the next time i think I will cut the lemon juice it half because it was very acidic/ "lemony".

Thank God I found this recipe!  This is the EXACT same recipe as what is served at Bubba Gumps and they will always make Accidental Fish if you request it (if you are nice).  Just so nice to know that I can make this at home and it was a HUGE success!  I had to make this for four, so I doubled everything.  In the end, I added some grated Paremesian and a little parsely (because I overshot the amount of squeezed lemon Juice) and added a little pepper and sea salt. Tasted GREAT and I'm sure is now a new favorite!

I made this using tilapia.  After rubbing on the olive oil, I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper.  I lowered the oven temp to 400 and mine were perfectly done in 20 minutes.   For the sauce, I cut the butter in half, and instead of lemon juice, I put in a splash of dry white wine.  I added the tomatoes and doubled the green onion.   This was great served over jasmine rice, and made for a delicious and super easy dinner.

This was so yummy.  I will tweak it a little to personal tastes next time but very good.  (Next time, more tomato and more onion.)  Tried this with Tilapia as the store was out of Mahi Mahi.  I paired this with some brown rice and some grilled asparagus.  VERY YUMMY!  The hint of lemon really hit the spot.

We loved this!  I didn't have green onions, so I used a red onion.  I'm sure it would have looked prettier with some green, but it tasted delicious.  I used half the butter as someone else suggested, and it was still a ton of butter, so use no more than 1/4 cup butter.  I also added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, because I love lemon, and it was great.  While it was delicious, I did not notice the spiciness, so probably would have been good to add extra hot sauce.  We are trying to eat healthier, so we had baked sweet potatoes and a green salad on the side instead of having this with white rice.  It was a delicious combo.

This recipe is delicious as is!  If you like sauce on your rice, DO NOT half the butter.  The original amount provided the perfect amount of sauce.  The chives and lemon are what make the sauce, so if you don't have fresh chives, it won't be as great.

I used Tilapia...It was delicious! Approximately 10 minutes and then another 5 minutes with the sauce poured onto them. I used very thick tilapia and used the whole 20 minutes May, 2014. Still excellent!

This dish was soooooo good!  My husband gave it a thumbs up and said it was a definite keeper.  I used Cod because Mahi Mahi is hard to find in my area.  Beside the type of fish, the only change I made was to add more hot sauce (about 1 1/2 teaspoons).  Served it with Roasted Chicken Couscous and a broccoli/red pepper/onion vegetable medley.  Delicious!

Really good. The title is a bit odd. As usual I substitute lime for lemon juice. When serving sprinkle with chopped cilantro.

I used cod as that is what I had. I doubled the recipe, based on the other reviews I cut down the butter. I liked the recipe and my husband loved it! We will make it again - however I think I would increase the hot sauce as we really didn't taste it and decrease the lemon juice. I make it with brown rice and fixed sugar snap peas with it. Yummy dinner!

It was a decent fish dish. As we try to incorporate fish into our weekly meals I'm looking for tasty, quick and easy. This was quick and easy, but it's missing something. Still a decent dish and one that I will most likely make again. I cut the butter in half and topped it with fresh basil. The tomatoes were delicious and I would recommend not skipping them.

Prepared as written & was surprised at how much we liked it. Just a light (in taste), pleasantly flavored fish dish. I served this over leftover cooked penne pasta & next time half of the butter will suffice. However, if serving over rice definitely use all the butter.

This was awesome. I switched it up a little, though. I used 2 Roma tomatoes, and lime instead of lemon. Also, there seems to be a mahi mahi shortage right now, so I used tilapia instead. It worked out GREAT.

I have made this twice.  The first time using a whole stick of regular butter and Mahi-Mahil.  The second time with 6tbs. of light butter and tilapia.  It was a huge hit both times! I'll probably stick with the light butter in the future to cut calories.  I make dirty rice and put the fish over it and then pour the sauce over the whole thing - the rice absorbs a lot of the sauce so it is not greasy and the flavor is great!!

Possible answer to why this is called "Accidental Fish."  A long time ago at a restaurant in Washington, DC, Mahi Mahi was on the menu and was also referred to as "Poor Man's Lobster" and it was served with drawn butter just like lobster tail.  If you don't like the fat content, just reduce the amount of butter. Great recipe -- thanks Becca.

This is okay.  I used cod and cut back on the butter by adding EVOO.  The sauce still turned out too buttery.  Also added more hot sauce because two drops isn't enough.  Not my cup of tea.

This recipe was less than par. I would suggest adding less butter and attempt to add more garlic and spices to add some more flavor.

Very good, but then it's hard to go wrong with a lemon garlic butter sauce on fish. :)  I would have liked more hot sauce, I think (my philosophy is, if you're going to add it, what's the point of just adding 2 drops!) Also, I didn't think that much butter was necessary; I used half and it was plenty. Very tasty recipe!

I've made this several times now with mahi-mahi and cod -- it's a terrific weeknight dinner because it comes together so quickly. I use half butter/half EVOO and double the tomatoes and green onions. Tonight I'm trying it with one garlic clove and substituting ramps (wild leeks, which grow in our woods) for the green onions. You could probably use a dry white wine instead of the lemon juice. The sauce would be good over pasta without the fish!

I found this recipe bland and left the fish (mahi) tasting fishy.  I did not use much hot sauce.  Perhaps that would have improved it.  I will not be making this again.  The butter did taste good over the rice, but that's about it.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I added some cut black olives, and red pepper sliced then, and honestly my husband who doesn't care for fish even ate it!  It's a must try recipe for sure.

I usually approach fish in a minimalist way so that the taste of the fish is not smothered, but this is a wonderful recipe that compliments the mahi-mahi beautifully.

I used half the butter and used yellow onion as I did not have a green onion.  After reading other reviews, I also put just a touch of creole seasoning on the mahi mahi prior to placing in the oven.  Everything else was as written in the recipe.  We loved it, even my husband who is not a fan of fish!  Thanks so much!!!

This was delicious!!! I used 3 tilapia fillets, rubbed with olive oil, salt and peppered both sides. Squeezed 1/4 lemon over fish before baking as i didn't have any lemon pepper seasoning. Used all the butter the recipe calls for and thought it was perfect to pour on top of fish served on a bed of white rice. Didn't have the roma, squeezed 1/2 lemon in butter and an extra dash of Louisi hot sauce. squeezed remaining lemon over fish before adding lemon butter sauce. DE-LISH!!! I will be cooking fish more often.

Truly excellent!  Easy quick prep.Used Pike filets from Mich. fresh  lake water.Used extra Roma and green onion- did not increase butter. Tilapia and Swea filets would be great. An inexpensive, attractive and delicious recipe.

Absolutely the best fish recipe we have ever made. Probably made it 25 times. The only minor improvement we made a while back is the addition of 1/4 cup of white wine to the sauce mixture and we simmer for about 15 minutes to thicken it a little.

My husband absolutely loved this! I added some Pimentoes, Cinnamon, and fresh basil to the sauce and a tiny bit of cayanne directly on the fish to take this recipe where I wanted for the evening, but it was Incredible.  "The yummiest fish I have eaten in my entire life."- A very Happy Hubby   Works great with any sort of rice.  We ate it with a brown and Black rice mix and poured the sauce right on the rice.   Much yumminess!!

Followed the recipe exactly other than adjusting cooking times according to the fish fillet size. We really liked this. I did season the fish before baking, which I thought was important because our mahi fillets were very thick. I did cut the amount of butter in half just because I thought it would be enough sauce for two fillets. Hubs dumped the sauce on every surface. :-) Served it with Portuguese rice that appears on the AR site. Winner, winner fishy dinner!

This is a very nice and easy way to cook fish. Enough to season the fish and not too much that overpowered the fish.

This recipe was an excellent base to start cooking a fish I'd never made before.  I tailored it to my tastes, sauteed some spinach with the sauce and made that the bed for my fish and sauce.   Loved the lemon/butter sauce.  Will definitely make again and try with different fish.

Made as written with mahi mahi. So simple, but it really is a lovely way to prepare this fish. The fish really shines through, so make sure you use the freshest and best fish!

We followed the recipe exactly as written.  Preparing Mahi-Mahi was a first for us.  Being from the Midwest, our fish recipes lean towards, walleye, perch, frozen haddock, cod and salmon and have to admit, this Mahi-Mahi recipe was right up there with the rest.  We loved it and so easy to prepare.

I guess this deserves five stars considering the fact that my husband ate it all and I didn't get to taste it! I used cod because I had it on hand. I also put in a lot more hot sauce because we like spicy. I'll have to make it again!

I love this recipe. Have made it many times with differing white fish. Just made it for lunch with halibut. I thought the 450 sounded high but it has never burned filets cooking for twenty minutes. I made recipe per instructions but had some red and yellow peppers and chopped them up and threw into sauce. This is such an easy recipe but also so yummy! Don't skimp on the hot sauce, it adds a lot of depth.

Excellent! The instructions on my frozen fish, baked at 450degF, said to check at 12 min and bake up to 18 min (which I did). The sauce was delish (I added extra hot sauce), and I could see this working well with other fish, as well. I did omit the tomato, but I'm sure it would work fine here. Thanks for this very good and easy recipe!

Very good and easy to make recipe. Original calls for way too much butter, 2 T was enough to make a sauce for us. I also used Penzey's California pepper to season the fish before baking about 20 minutes at 425 and it turned out well. I recommend lining dish with foil for easy cleanup. The tomatoes gave it a nice flavor and the onions added a little crunch.

This was a great recipe on a night I didn't have a lot of time to cook. Used fresh water bass filets, it's what I had on hand. Followed the recipe with just a splash of white wine to the sauce. Thinly sliced a Zuchini in also. Great on a bed of rice.

I had frozen tilapia filets to use and they worked great. My 4 year old ate ALL of her fish and asked for more! So good, though I will half the amount of butter for our 3 fish filets next time. We ate with jasmine rice, which was just amazing.

This was pretty good for a light summer dish. I would eat a nice salad on the side. I used some instead of mahi mahi and magarine in place of butter. Skipped the tomatoes.

Made as directed, with the only changes being 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup, and used ocean perch because my local grocery store doesn't carry mahi mahi and the ocean perch was fresh that day. :) This is a fantastic recipe!!! Definitely use the tomatoes, and don't let them nor the green onions cook too much when you heat the sauce. Served it over Jenni's Italian farro pilaf from this site, and it was not only a complete meal, but a five star one! Thanks so much for posting! Easy and delicious!!!

This  is  a great recipe... So good and quick and easy.   The only thing I changed was the pepper sauce... I used the Cholula Chipotle sauce  for the smoky pepper flavor.  I also only baked for 15 min. and it was perfect...  White, moist and fell apart with the touch of a  fork.. Thank you Becca!

This was pretty bland.  I ended up sprinkling red pepper flakes on it at the table.  It was easy to prepare although the sauce is pretty greasy.  Perhaps the addition of a thickener to make it truly a sauce and/or adding a seasoning to the rice would help.   Since reviewers have used all different types of fish (I used pollock, maybe the problem?)  you would adjust cooking time based on the type and thickness of your fish.

Thank you, Becca, for sharing this beautifully simple, fast and delicious recipe.   It was excellent with fresh grouper.  Next time I will serve the fish and sauce over rice as suggested -- just thinking about it is making me hungry.

Great! Used 3 Roma's, rest very similar to recipe. Good with rice or pasta as it makes extra sauce. Grouper or mahi is tasty and cooks in similar amt of time.

This recipe sat in my box for months because while it seemed easy enough to make, I couldn't imagine it being very good. I'm so glad I finally tried it -- it's not good, it's amazing! Like other reviewers, I only use about half the butter, but if you can eat tomatoes, don't skip that ingerdient. I've tried this recipe with halibut, cod, and grouper -- all with great results.

Very good recipe. I made a few changes to suite my taste. I have made this with mahi and grouper, both great but really any good white fish will work. I tend to like more spice so I used this recipe using more tomato and a lot of extra Louisiana hot sauce and garlic. I have also used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies along with fresh diced Roma tomatoes still adding Louisiana hot sauce. I tend to smother the fish in the sauce as the extra sauce falls off into the rice for additional flavor. This is an amazing dish served over a box or 5 depending on meal size, of Rice a Roni long grain wild rice mix with steamed vegetables as a side dish, yum!!!  FYI I have made a lot of fish dishes using many different variations, using the long grain wild rice seems to have the perfect consistency for this dish.

The sauce was so delicious, I had to stop myself from eating it before the fish was done!  I added some mushrooms and onions to it, which only added to its wonderful taste. Served it on a bed of steamed spinach, with sides of cole slaw and asparagus. Will be serving it the next time we have company. It would work with any fish, and even chicken.

Ridiculously good and easy.  I did rub salt on the fish and I added capers to the sauce because my family's addicted to capers.  I used halibut.  Perfect!

we used tilapia instead of mahi mahi and it turned out very good. We also used a can on peeled petite diced tomatoes which gave it a little more juice which we put on the rice. We will make this again.

amazing flavor for very little prep.  I needed a quick meal from ingredients on hand, and this was it!  I had mahi mahi thawed, and followed other's suggestion to rub it with lemon pepper before baking.  I followed everything else to a T, omitting the tomato because I didn't have one on hand.  Very impressive for the simplicity.  I'll make it again.

I made this and really liked it!  My husband thought it had too much lemon, but I thought that's what made it delish!  I spend summers at a remote cabin in Alaska, so if I don't have an ingredient, I have to make do.  In this case I did not have green onions, but I did have some sweet peppers, so I substituted 1 yellow sweet pepper for the green onion.  Loved it!

This recipe was great. So tasty! the lemon works well with the tomatoes and the mahi mahi was a delicious fish.  The hot sauce added just a small kick of heat. Baked the fish at a lower temp and longer time just because the oil seemed to start burning at the beginning.  also, seasoned the fish with salt, pepper and some chili powder before baking.

bought mahi mahi for the first time and needed to know how to cook it.  this recipe turned out great!  used 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp hot sauce and no tomato for almost a pound filet.  baked exactly as stated.  it was totally yummy!  I am now a big fan of mahi mahi.  thanks!

I thought this would have more flavor based on some of the reviews. I even doubled the garlic. My husband and son liked it but I was disappointed in what I felt was a lack of flavor. I will need to figure out something to add to it.

This sauce made what was unfortunately a mediocre piece of store bought Mahi Mahi...quite good.  For our purposes and taste I used half the butter but otherwise followed the recipe with more hot sauce (to taste as suggested per recipe).  Great stuff. Can't wait to make it again using a better piece of Mahi Mahi.

The sauce is great!! I used a bit of minced onion as suggested in another review, and added a bit more hot sauce ... otherwise made as written. Delicious.

I saved about a tablespoon of the leftover sauce with my trusty spatula job because I couldn't bear to part with it. PS: put it over red snapper. Thanks!!

Amazing!!  I used Cod and half the amount of butter as suggested by most.  I sprinkled with Old Bay before baking the cod.  The easiest baked fish recipe with minimal ingredients!  Will be making again soon!  Very Weight Watcher friendly as long as you watch the amount of butter.

This is a great Mahi Mahi recipe!  After reading the reviews, we cut the butter in half and I'm glad we did.  We didn't have green onion but used a small amount of yellow onion instead.  I added this to my recipe box and can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

So very easy to make and excellent!
Used tilapia and a bit less butter and served over rice.
Big hit!
I think the amount of garlic, hot sauce and green onion is totally flexible and can be adjusted to your personal taste,
So play it by ear....

Made this last week with fresh red snapper and thought it was just delicious.  Used half the butter and a little extra olive oil, 5 splashes of hot sauce, and 2 tomatoes.  So good, I'm making it again tonight for company.  Serve atop brown rice.  Healthy and incredibly good!!

Used Swai instead of Mahi Mahi and put it in for 16 min. Tender and delicious! Also cut out half the butter and added jalepenos.
