Great recipe. I've made it twice. Once w/o and once with nutmeg.  Like it best w/ a pinch of nutmeg and use non dairy creamer.  So glad to have this.  Haven't had biscuits and gravy in years until now.  Thanks for the recipe!

I consider myself a connoisseur of Southern sausage gravy. I recently married a woman who is unfortunately lactose intolerant being that my favorite food is biscuits and gravy with sausage and eggs I had to find a way to still enjoy that treat with my wife. I I was very surprised by the Worcestershire sauce and the teaspoon of nutmeg I have never heard of this and I gave it a try anyway. It's really good and I'm just amazed you can make good gravy with almond milk at all. I think next time I will give it a try without the nutmeg and Worcestershire and just do it with just salt and pepper can see which method I prefer. Thank you for posting this really cool recipe.

Seriously I have used your site so many times and never made an account... this was so amazing... so perfect that I made an account to say so... make sure you get unsweetened almond milk when making it fyi. It is not my mom's version but it's a close second and there is no dairy so it's safe for my family. So thank you thank you thank you. I have not been able eat this in 4 years... thank you.
