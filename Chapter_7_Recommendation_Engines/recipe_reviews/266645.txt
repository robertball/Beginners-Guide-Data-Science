a great recipe made better. Today I added a few tablespoons of almond flour and baked them in mini muffin tins, totally delicious, chewy and moist.

I followed the recipe to the "T", but there was to much liquid when I tried scoping them onto the cookie sheet.  I baked the first batch that way and they didn't look right, so I went and bought another bag of coconut and added another 1-1/2 cup to the batter.  Then 2nd scoop onto the cookie sheet was just the way the picture showed it!! Perfect baking.  May I suggest that the recipe should state "3 Cups of PACKED DOWN unsweetened Coconut.

I made it as written. I only had sweetened coconut, so I went with that. My adult son really loved them. Perfect chewiness, though I did add more coconut than stated in the recipe. I added enough to make the mound more firm as it was fairly runny with stated amounts. I rolled my first half in more coconut but did not do so with the last batch. They really didn't look any different when cooked.  I used most of a 14 oz bag. I am looking forward to trying this with unsweetened coconut next time. I only got 15 cookies with my cookie scoop and I flattened them before baking so as to have a more cookie-like appearance.

Utterly delicious! I am crazy about coconut and these were my childhood's favorite...and now I could seriously be gaining some good pounds...luckily, my kids are my 24/7 gym. Oh and I didn't have almond extract, but didn't miss it.

So easy and delicious.  I could not find unsweetened coconut, so I used the sweetened and it was fine.  I got several compliments on them too!

I have made these a few times now and they are fantastic!    This is what I have found to work every time...   I use have sweetened and half unsweetened coconut.   The mixture is too wet to roll into balls so I use a 2tbs spring loaded scoop and pack it tight with the back of a spoon.  Release onto parchment lined cookie sheets and bake.   I only dip half of the cookies in melted chocolate chips.  They are delicious with or without the chocolate.

These were delicious. The unsweetened coconut I used was not as fine so my cookies had a more rustic look.  I'll put it in the processor first next time to make it finer.  I also learned the hard way that they have to be completely cooled before moving the dipped cookies. Best to watch the video first but that said they're very easy to make. Yum

Whaaa?! So good! Mmm! Highly recommended. The trick is finding the right scoop to use. And don't skip rolling them in extra dry coconut before going on the baking pan, so much extra yum!

Works great and delicious! My batter was a little dry so I had to add a tiny bit more condensed milk. I did use a small ice cream scooper to drop the cookies, but had to be gentle with it and not squeeze the spring loaded handle all the way otherwise the cookie would lose its shape. I added a roasted almond inside the cookie as Chef John suggested and was not disappointed. I forgot to set some shredded coconut aside so I didn't get to roll the cookies in it before baking, but they still looked great.

I love coconut and these turned out perfect following the recipe as written.  The only thing I did differently was to use the entire can of sweetened condensed milk, therefore making a double batch. Double Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of rolling them in the coconut and found the mixture to have too much moisture.   It seeped out a little during baking.

Fabulous!  Reminiscent of Passover In NYC!  So easy.  Unsweetened Coconut seemed hard to find, then by accident I located Organic Unsweetened coconut flakes in the produce area at the market.

These taste excellent, but they are a pain in the butt to roll because the "dough" seemed a bit soon. I added additional coconut to get them to keep their shape.
Delicious!

Unsweetened vs. Sweetened coconut makes a big difference: The former will result in a dryer (takes longer to chew) macaroon; the latter is stickier.  Both are good; can also just use both in recipe.  We were looking to replicate a limited edition Tropical Mounds bar that was on the market briefly years ago, so we replaced extracts w/1 tsp orange extract, and made macaroon orange w/food coloring.  Dipping in chocolate was essential to the final product, and we dare say, it was beautiful and delicious!

It was runny.  I had to add more coconut.  They didn't stay together while dipping them.  Flavor was good, but presentation was terrible. Will not make ever again.

Mine didn't turn out anything like what is shown. There is no way I could get the amount stated out of these ingredients. I will try another recipe.
