Definately good but a little salty so I made these changes: In step 1, I used two cans of undrained beans and 1 1/2 cups of water with a ham hock.  I omitted the salt altogether and substituted the lard with olive oil. I did not blend the last can of beans, I drained two cans into mixture and heated.  It was absolutely delicious!!!

This is very good, my son says better than Popeye's. I used dried red beans so the ham hock would cook throughly and left out the lard because my husband has heart disease

Excellent all in all.  Always good to see people who aren't afraid of good ol' fashioned lard.  I read another review claiming this recipe was too salty.  Probably because it uses canned beans.  I use the dried.  Furthermore, sea salt instead of the usual stuff has a milder flavour and lacks the bitterness of table salt.  I played around with the recipe and added some beef scraps I had from making my beef shortening, it was a nice touch.

This is terrific!  If you like New Orleans red beans & rice, you'll love this. I couldn't bring myself to include the lard so just omitted it but I followed the rest of recipe and my family loved it.

This was very good, especially for someone like me who's not a meat eater and needs to find alternative protein sources. I didn't have any lard on hand so I used olive oil. Thanks Jackie!

Followed the recipe w/o ham and used a lean pork which was shredded.  Turned out amazing.  Thanks for the idea.

These are pretty good but could use a bit more spice.  I used some shredded pork for the meat & made a pot of red beans, which were well seasoned.  When you puree them in the food processor they resemble refried beans.  I wasn't thrilled about adding lard to the whole batch so I pureed the beans as instructed and then just melted a bit of lard in a pan and refried a small portion.  The rest I heated in a sauce pan.  I don't think the lard added enough flavor to warrant the extra calories.  With the plain rice this was pretty bland.  I ended up stirring it all together, adding salsa and making bean and cheese burritos.  The kids loved those.
