8.4.16    We have many, many Cuban restaurants in Tampa, and this is an authentic version of a Cuban Sandwich.  Used my panini pan to "press" the sandwich, typically the way they are served.  Split a sandwich with my husband today for a very nice lunch.

I confess I didn't use Smithfield products as their not available here. However I found very good subsitutes at Lavergne Western Beef in Navan.
I will make this again, and again!

I cannot stand mustard or pickles but stepped out of my box and loved this sandwich.

I just made this for dinner tonight, very yummy. I used a grill pan with press ,homemade pickles and Dijon mustard. but I did cheat by using leftover pork roast instead of a pork loin. I will make this again, yummy in our tummy!!!
