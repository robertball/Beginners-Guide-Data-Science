The key to a good sear is to get the skillet really hot. I like to put the pan on med/high heat for two-three minutes before adding the oil, I used Avocado as it has a higher smoke point, then add the oil and allow it to shimmer before adding the scallops. I then dropped the heat to med. My scallops were large so I cooked for four minutes on the first side and then three on the second side. In the recipe description it says to drizzle with balsamic and basil but in the body is says to garnish with lemon zest. I went with the lemon zest as I thought that the balsamic would overpower the scallops. I served this on a garlic/parsley butter reduction. Great, simple recipe that I will make again.

Delicious. A quick and simple recipe. I garnished with a side of pasta with lemon butter sauce and asparagus.

Easy and delicious! I have used the same recipe from another site (except it does not use lemon). I like it better without the lemon while cooking. I can get a better sear quicker. If I want a little lemon after they're cooked, I'll add it.

Perfect basic technique.  Make sure scallops are dry.  I added some fresh Rosemary to the initial oil heating.  Loved them!

This is a quick and easy way to make scallops.   We all loved them and I am not much of a seafood person.  Perfect.

I did add a little capers because lemon, butter, and capers are a go to for me with any seafood.
