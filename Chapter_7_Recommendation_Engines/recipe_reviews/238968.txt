This was so quick and delicious! I only changed a couple things. I melted the butter in a pie plate and then sliced unpeeled peaches into it. Instead of coating with 3/4 cup of sugar I lightly sprinkled sugar on the peaches. I then topped with the batter in which I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg (personal preference). I will be making this again - might try cherries next time. Thank you for the recipe!!

This recipe was awesome... I'm really picky about the cobbler part so have had a hard time finding a recipe I like but this is the one!! Its so easy to make too, only thing I did different was I only had frozen peaches on hand and I mixed the melted butter into the cobbler batter and put it on top on the peaches, only because my oven burnt the fruit of a different recipe I tried... thank you for sharing this I will be making it a lot.

So here's what did wrong so you can get it right, lol. I didn't have regular flour so used organic wheat flour. It's ok I guess but I think I cooked it too long. I had biscuick and should've used that instead and it has baking powder in it.  I used canned peaches so I didn't add a lot of sugar to the peachy but did add some and about a tablespoon of butter. Peaches had a good flavor. It's my fault for the cobbler not coming out great because I didn't have white flour and cooked it 5 min to long. Will definitely try again with correct ingredients.

I made this pretty much as written except I used 5 medium-sized peaches and substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg (personal preference). Had my doubts when I put it all together and stuck it in the oven but it smelled so good while baking and looked great when it was done baking. Served it with a little whip cream and it was delicious. Will definitely be making this again - thanks for sharing.

This was Amazing! I needed to make this dairy free so instead of butter I used 1/2 butter flavored Earth Balance spread and 1/2 coconut oil (only because I didn't have enough Earth Balance). I also used sweetened vanilla almond milk in place of regular milk. I wanted to make a big pan of it because I had peaches I needed to use. I peeled and sliced 6 large peaches and mixed with 1 cup of sugar. I doubled the ingredients needed to make the dough. Other than that I followed the directions exactly. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it took maybe 5-10 extra minutes to bake. My family LOVED it! My husband even took a little to work and shared with a guy who now wants his wife to make some. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! I made a few changes. I doubled the recipe, added two more peaches and baked in a 9x13 stone baking dish. I used brown sugar on the peaches instead of white, but I did use white sugar in the batter. I also put 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon on the peaches. The peaches wound up sitting in the brown sugar mixture for several hours, as I was trying to prep ahead. By the time I was ready to put this together, the peaches had juiced themselves because of the sugar. Therefore, I was nervous to put them on top of the batter as the recipe suggested. So I put the peaches on the bottom and added the melted butter (and 2 teaspoons vanilla) to the batter and put it on top. Baked at 375 for about 50 minutes. It was absolutely amazing, my family and dinner guests raved about it. I served it with vanilla ice cream. It was simple and wonderful - I will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it for the first time yesterday for a July 4 picnic and everyone was delighted. I had only a few fresh peaches, so I supplemented with blueberries and a few chopped walnuts. I also cut the sugar a bit since we tend to like things tart. Not only was the finished product a beautiful dessert, but my family sat around the table eating it with vanilla ice cream until it was completely gone! They then asked for the recipe. It was definitely a hit.

I just made this for Father's Day and my husband said it was delicious.  I loved that it was low in calories, but I did use much less sugar than called for as we do not like super sweet desserts.  I used a little less than 1/4 cup sugar over the peaches and it was still too sweet, so I added a couple more peaches.  Next time I will taste the peaches first!  I also used that same amount of sugar in the batter.

So easy and delicious! I cut back on the sugar by a quarter cup and is still too sweet for my taste. This recipe is a keeper for sure. Just need to decrease the amount of sugar some more.

Very good.  I did cut the sugar and added cinnamon to both the peaches and the batter.  I just filled an 8 x 8 dish with peaches, sprinkled on about 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon and cut the sugar in the batter to 2/3 or so cup and added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I did put the peaches on the bottom.  Very yummy!

This recipe is super easy to follow and just as easy to make. I followed the instructions exactly and it came out perfect. I did add a dash of cinnamon along with the nutmeg. This will be a go to dessert recipe for me.

Love the sugary crisp on the top. My whole family loved it! I didn't have fresh peaches, so I substituted with two 15oz cans of peaches. With that, I reduced the first 3/4 cup sugar to 1/4 cup because the peaches were in light syrup to begin with.

Yummy! We froze some peaches last summer and I've been looking for an easy cobbler recipe! The only thing I did differently was I used about 1/4 c sugar on the peaches since they were so sweet already. And I used half and half because that was all I had. Thanks for the great recipe!

Amazing recipe! I've made this cobbler a total of three times in the span of 1 weeks, and my whole family (myself included!) have loved it. I did experiment with the baking time a tiny bit, and found that baking it for exactly 45 minutes gives you a chewy and soft result. One small change that I made was to add a few pinches of cinnamon. I've always thought that cinnamon adds such a lovely aroma and flavor to baked goods, and in this case, it totally made the flavors POP!!! It's a quick, easy to make (and clean up), absolutely scrummy recipe!

Used 8 fresh peaches and doubled the ingredients for the bread. However, due to comments regarding sugar, I used half cup brown sugar plus half cup white sugar for the peaches. I used less than 1/4 c white sugar in the bread mixture. This was awesome! Best cobbler I have ever had. Next time I might use 10 peaches instead of 8.

Amazing! Added a little cinnamon to the batter in addition to the nutmeg. Followed the rest of  recipe exactly. Note to those concerned about burning the peaches. They sink to the bottom so they don't burn.

Great Recipe!  I had already begun before I realized that I had no general purpose flour.  I had to substitute whole wheat.  Not bad, but here is what I would tweak.  The whole wheat came out pretty good, but it was a little rustic and nutty.  I would replace 1-cup all purpose flour with 1/2-cup whole wheat, and 1/2-cup all purpose.  I would also use more peaches.  I used two large ones, but keeping everything else the same, and using three large peaches would give a better fruit ratio.

I also added a little cinnamon, and some fresh nutmeg.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  When I think of peach cobbler, this is what I think of - not the kind with pie crust on top of the peaches.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 x 11 Pyrex dish - bad decision!  It turned out delicious but I should have used a 9 x 13 Pyrex dish.  Thank goodness I put it on a baking sheet otherwise I would have had a mess in my oven and probably would have set off the smoke alarm!

Super easy, simple ingredients. I substituted a little cinnamon, as I was out of nutmeg. Also used 1/2 cup sugar on peaches instead of 3/4, mine were sweet already. Turned out great! Hubby said it is the best peach cobbler he's ever had! Made it for dessert last night ans I seriously already have another one in the oven before 8a.m.!

This is such an easy recipe, and turned out great!  I did make a few changes. I made this in an 8 x 8 pan.  When I saw the recipe I was not convinced that 2 peaches would be adequate.  

I ended up using 6 peaches for the filling.  I used a gluten free flour from Costco in place of the regular flour.  That worked well!

I made this for a birthday celebration at work.  Some of our staff have gluten allergies and that was easy to deal with.  We also have a few vegans, and I am always at a loss when it comes to dessert.

I am going to a Labor Day potluck this weekend and I will make this to take along!

I made this gluten free using Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 baking flour (which is the best stuff in the world to use for gluten free baking). I cut up the butter and let it melt in the baking dish in the oven as it heated up. Used about 1/2 c. sugar in the batter and vanilla rice milk. Poured the batter over the butter then put peaches on top and sprinkled with some cinnamon sugar I had left from another recipe. Show stopping delicious! Already sent the recipe to my friend and my sister. Will make again while peaches are in season and then with other fruits. Thanks for this simple but delicious recipe on exactly the day I needed it.

I'm from Tennessee and I  remember the great cobblers made with fresh fruit.  They were wonderful and simle to make.  Just as this was. I had my grandson do everything. We went outside to the garden while it baked and collected mulberries .

Pulled the cobbler from the oven and after cooling dove into it .

We loved it.

Hands down the easiest & best tasting Peach Cobbler I've ever had—& I made it. This was my first attempt at making Peach Cobbler, EVER!  Yet I was more than thrilled with the outcome. I made very minor adjustments to the recipe;
Instead of using the full amount of butter asked in the ingredients, I did half butter & half coconut oil. Then instead of pouring the butter mix completely in the pan, I poured half of the butter (coconut oil) mix in the pan and the other half in the batter mix. 

I also chose to add cinnamon to replace the nutmeg, & I also added a dash of cinnamon to the peaches a and sugar mixture. 

For baking, I placed the peaches in the pant first, then layer the batter on top of it. I cooked my Cobbler for an 1hr and let it sit for an hour. I then brushed the top with melted butter and broiled it until the top had stiffened into a more solid crust!

I made this basically following the recipe I doubled the batter as I had peaches that needed to be used. I left the skin on as they were too soft to peel. I also reduced the sugar on the peaches as they were so soft and sweet already. I used cinnamon as most others did. Next time I'm going to try brown sugar to coat them instead of white sugar as I think there will be a richer taste when the sugar candies down around the peaches? Love this recipe its the second time I've used it.

My family really enjoyed this dessert.  I made the recipe according to directions except I poured the batter over the top of the peaches rather than underneath.  It browned beautifully.  The only thing I might do differently next time would be to drain some of the juice from the peach and sugar mixture to prevent it from bubbling over in the oven.

I reduced the sugar on the peaches to 1/2 cup. It was plenty sweet. Very simple to make. I will definitely make it again.
My husband’s most requested cobbler! I’ve made it several times now. I will try it with apples in the fall.

My husband and I held a competition to see who made the best cobbler and I lost although the kids ate it all and said it was really good!  I did do a little modifying with the recipe as others did in the amount of sugar that was added. I reduced the sugar total down to 3/4 of a cup and split using half brown sugar and half king sugar. It was still just as sweet and I probably could have reduced in another quarter of a cup because of the sweetness of the fresh peaches. I will also use a little more milk to thin out my better as I put my peaches in the pan first and my batter on top to make it a little less cake like.It was quick and easy. My husband has his own recipe which he uses piecrust. I would definitely make it again and I am sharing this recipe with a few friends who I have told about it. Good luck to those who are trying this and thank you for sharing your recipe with us all to enjoy. I will also use a little more milk to thin out my batter as I put my peaches in the pan first and my batter on top to make it a little less cake like.

Delightful. As recommended I reduced sugar in batter and on peaches. I used 5 smallish peaches. Next time I will use more. Ratio is a little too cakey for me.  Quick and easy!!!

It was great!  Took the advice of several other people and melted the butter in a pie pan and added 3 sliced peaches slightly sprinkled with sugar instead of 3/4 c.  I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg, poured the batter on top and baked it for 45 min.  Overflowed the pan a bit but it was delicious! So easy.

I didn't like it at first and neither did my 7 year old. The texture of the "bread" was a bit of a turn-off. I brought it to work the next day and everyone loved it, and I liked it better. Heated up on day two with a cup of coffee and it was really good. I didn't have any nutmeg so used cinnamon. The only other change I made was using 3 large peaches instead of two (two?!). I kept the sugar the same, as my peaches were only on the firm end of ripe, and it was not too sweet for me. I would use four peaches next time and add the nutmeg, maybe some vanilla.

My batter didn’t rise above the peaches and stuck to the bottom.. maybe was an error somewhere on my part.. i read reviews and cut most of the sugar out for the peach mixture as the peaches were really sweet. It tasted great but needed a knife to cut through the cake part.. will try again one more time..

I am giving it 4 stars because I tweaked the recipe. First, I used 5 peaches, not 2. Second, I used 1/4 cup white sugar to coat the peaches, not 3/4, which seemed like a lot. If you use the 1/4 cup, the peaches will be slightly tart, which we prefer. Third, I used 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/4 brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup just white in the flour mixture. Lastly I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. This was the best cobbler! It is really, really good! Will be making it again soon.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!
I used 3 large peaches and substituted the nutmeg for cinnamon.
The other change, just added small amount of fresh lemon juice to peach mixture.
Served with vanilla caramel ice cream.  Will make this again!

This is the first time I have made peach cobbler. I had peaches that had to be used. I read a lot of the reviews and they said to cut down on the sugar. I used 8-9 medium sliced peaches. I used a little less than 1/4 cup mixed with the peaches, along with a little cinnamon instead of nutmeg. I tasted the peaches to check their sweetness. I used 2/3 c sugar in the batter and a little cinnamon instead of the nutmeg again. I baked it for 40 minutes. It was delicious. Just sweet enough. Topped it with homemade peach ice cream. I will definitely make this again.

I followed the directions exactly.  I made it for my daughter's birthday "cake".  She loved it and said that it reminded her of the peach cobblers we made when she was a kid.  I might put in one  more peach next time.

This is my favorite peach cobbler recipe...simple, easy, delicious.   I follow the recipe exactly, though I have decided that I like it best with a minimum of 3 cups sliced, fresh peaches, even 4 cups will fit in the 8x8 pan.  Often our peaches are more medium than large.  This year we bought Regina peaches from Yakima, Washington - perfect for cobblers.

This recipe is awesome as is but I added some lemon juice to cut down on the sweetness. Also, added a tsp of cornstarch to the peach mix. Everyone loved it.

Tasted very good. The reason for 4 vs 5 stars is because I had to modify this. I used 1 cup total sugar vs 1 1/2c and easily has enough...any more would have been overload. And it needed more peaches than 2. I used 4 medium peaches. I would definitely make it again, with these modifications.

This was delicious, but I made it with apricots instead of peaches, and I used Jules gluten free flour.  I also made it with cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  We inhaled it.  Yum!

I decreased the sugar by a half cup and could have done more. I also would add another peach next time. I thought overall this is a great basic recipe and easy. Good hot or cold, with or without ice cream.

We really liked this recipe.  It used fresh peaches which are in season right now.
We blanched the peaches and used 4 of them instead of two.
We used 1/3 cup of sugar on the peaches and left them for 4 or 5 hours at room temperature to make a nice syrup.
It required a larger Corning dish to cook but turned out perfectly after 45 minutes in the oven.

This turned out really good! Of course, I made some changes which included: cutting the sugar down, using Rice Dream as opposed to milk, and I added cinnamon versus nutmeg. I also added chopped walnuts too. It turned out really good!

This is such a great recipe!  So easy, and so good.  Pouring  the batter on the bottom of the dish (and spreading the peaches on top of the batter) is genius.  You get this beautiful base on the bottom that absorbs the peaches and creates this sort of gooey peach bread-like pudding with a golden crust.  It makes the thought of putting a biscuit-type crust on top of the peaches very unappealing.  I added fresh ginger to the super sweet seasonal peaches (I would never consider using canned peaches), and oh.my.goodness... it was excellent.  I served it warm with cold vanilla ice cream and it was summertime-BBQ-dessert-perfection.

This is a simple but great recipe! I did lower the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup. I would definitely make this again and will try to lower the sugar another 1/4 cup and may also decrease the butter amount  a little too.

Super easy and quick to throw together! Taste was great, too. My only complaint is that 45 minutes was way too long to bake it, I had it in for only 40 minutes and it almost burnt. And next time I'll use less butter as i had pools of melted butter sitting in each corner of the pan.

Delicious way to use up overripe peaches.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I will use maybe half of the butter and half of the sugar, and like another reviewer, use cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  My husband and I ate half the cobbler in one sitting!

Made per the recipe with the exception of using cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  The cobbler was tasty enough but seemed very greasy so may try again but use less butter.  Also, was rather too chewy for me.  Will try again with some modifications.

So easy to make! But, I did add extra peaches.  Two peaches just didn't seem like enough to me so I used 6 medium size peaches that I just picked that morning.  I used 2/3 cup brown sugar with them instead of the white sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  My family likes their cobbler with the bread portion on top so I greased my pan, put in the peach mixture then poured the melted butter over the peaches then topped with batter.  Came out perfect and not a drop was left!

This recipe was just OK for me, and I made it with only one modification (slightly reduced the sugar). My main issue was that the biscuit part of the cobbler turned out too chewy for me, especially around the edges. I think the 1/2 cup of butter was just too much, or maybe there was too much liquid. I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup in total (1/2 cup mixed with the peaches and 1/2 cup in the batter) and it was still way too sweet for me. But at the end of the day, the results were still alright and the recipe was extremely quick and easy to make.

I've made this twice in two days. Both times I made the recipe as stated except I used cinnamon in place or nutmeg as a personal preference. The second time I made a 13x8 pan so I'd have more!! I can't stop eating it. Really delicious. I sliced the peaches and put them in sugar and a little cinnamon while I made the topping, the sugar and juice from the peaches makes a yummy syrup that mixes well while cooking. DELISH!!!!

This is exactly what I imagine when I want peach cobbler!!!  I doubled the recipe (after I had cut way more peaches than the recipe called for!)  the crust was biscuit-like but not too thick!  After reading other reviews, I too scaled back on the sugar, thinking we may be adding ice cream to it.  It was perfect, no ice cream needed!  Even though I doubled the cobbler recipe, I still only used a total of 1 1/2c sugar and more peaches than it called for.  Delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Made this for a quick dessert last night using frozen peaches and it was delicious!  In addition to the nutmeg, I added a heaping tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger.  I subbed brown sugar for the dough and used buttermilk because it was what I had on hand. ( I usually use evaporated milk for this type of cobbler).  One of my favorite go-to desserts!

We enjoyed this dessert the first time I made it, so I made it a second time a few days later and we loved it even more. I converted it to a gluten free dessert for our daughter-in-law by substituting gluten free flour. I made it twice. The first time I used my own frozen peaches and it turned out quite well, however, I probably should've cooked it longer as the crust didn't seem to be quite done. Second time I used canned peaches from the store. They had two or three times the liquid that my frozen peaches had and I was concerned that it would be too much liquid. However, it was fantastic. Because of the liquid some of the batter from the crust seeped to the bottom and formed a crust on the bottom as well as the top. Although the recipe said to put the batter in first, I had followed others advice to put the batter on top. Now I know why you put it in first so you can have that nice delicious crust bottom and top.

OMG! This was so good and so easy! I cut back on the sugar and butter (personal taste). I had to use canned peaches since they aren't in season. Didn't matter, absolutely the best peach cobbler I have ever eaten!
UPDATE: Made this again but used frozen peaches ( almost thawed in microwave). 
Even better! I'll use frozen fruit from now on since it's frozen fresh. I can't wait for summer and fresh peaches again. 
My daughter wants this every week now. I will try other fruits too. Thanks for an easy and tasty dessert.

Delicious!  We just moved into a new home and our sweet new neighbor brought over a peach cobbler as a welcome to the neighborhood.  I went on a recipe search to find a replica and the was very, very close.  My new favorite cobbler!  Thank you for posting.

I made two 9x9x3 baking dishes for a neighborhood get together and even with the neighborhood children only one got eaten. Probably because everyone else brought a cobbler as well. The hits were a brownie cobbler and a veggie cobbler. As for mine I found that the peaches were difficult to pit, even though they looked great (cling peaches).  The rest went pretty easy after that but I'm not sure I would put that time in again.

I haven't had peach cobler since my Grandmother made it when I was a child, but this is definitely in my recipe box for sure!  It was so easy and I thought it wasn't going to be because the batter and butter melted together when assembling in the dish.  It came out fresh, sweet, and gooey.  I did add a pinch or two of cinnamon and will probably add a little Grand Mariner the next time to give a nice punch!  Thanks for sharing something I will make for years to come.

I did make some modifications. 
1. I cut the sugar in half. Peaches are so sweet on their own.
2. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.
3. I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the peaches.
4. I doubled the amount of peaches.
I served it Labor Day for a family picnic and it was a hit. My husband loved it so much I repeated on Thursday (cut the recipe in half for the two of us.

I had a lot of peaches so I doubled the recipe all but the sugar and the butter.  The butter I used 2/3 cup and the sugar I kept as is in the original recipe.  Was plenty sweet enough and turned out great!  The family loved it.

Fantastic! I used less butter -- the amount called for seemed excessive so I used about half. I also used slightly less sugar. It was delicious. I actually made it with peaches then with pears and blackberries a couple weeks later. Both were amazing.

I did lessen the butter by half and the sugar by 1/2 cup since I'm trying to diet. Also used more peaches. Even with the changes I loved it and have made it several times.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe. The batter came out chewy and I would have preferred a lot more peaches than the two large peaches the recipe suggested. If it needs to be tweaked this much, it's not worth anything over an average 3 stars. Nothing to write home about.

Wonderful I used peaches from our tree and added a lot more than the recipe called for. Other than that I followed the batter recipe.

Holy Moly - SO GOOD!  I made it exactly to the directions only changing that I put peaches on the bottom, then batter and then more peaches on the top.  Even though I LOVED it, next time I would do as others and less sugar and more peaches!  This is the best recipe, just need to adjust to personal taste.  

I made it the night before and next day I put it in the toaster oven and toasted to a dark brown!  Guess what?  It was even better than fresh out of the oven the night before!!  I couldn't believe it.   I would request that the recipe give a cup amount for the peaches rather than a number of peaches.  Next time I will calculate it out and change my recipe for future use.  

Thank you for this recipe!

Delicious...we used frozen peaches and strawberries and reduced sugar by 1/4 cup...it had a little strange aftertaste but that may have to do with a bit of freezer burn on the fruit.

Easy to make...will definitely do again.

Great recipe!  I had no fresh peaches so I used one can of 15 oz peaches in their own juice and added a cup of frozen blue berries.  I think it would have been better if it would have been 100% peaches. My wife liked the blue berries.  Will make it again.

I'm shocked! This is so good!! I cut the sugar amount in half and before putting it in the oven I thought for sure it was still too much sugar. It was perfect! I added a little cinnamon to the peaches. Easy and tasty!

This is the best cobbler I ever ate!!! You could use any fruit to make this dessert. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was amazing. I may try adding some blueberries next time just to experiment. This is the only recipe I'm going to use in the future.

I made a double batch to take to a 4th of July party.  I substituted Truvia sugar blend and used just 3/4 cup of butter in my 2x batch.   It was loved by all and disappeared in no time served hot with vanilla ice cream or light cream, it' s perfect.    And, it was so easy to make.

This was easy and delicious. I cut way back on the sugar, maybe only using 1/4 cup total. The peaches were so fresh and sweet that all that sugar was not necessary. Easy and quick. Maybe next time I will try folding the peaches in at the end instead of just laying them on top.

We loved this recipe!  Changed it just a bit with 3 peaches, 1/4 cup sugar on the peaches, (but probably should have used more-there wasn't much syrup when it came out of the oven), a tad more nutmeg and added cinnamon.  Just made it the day before yesterday and already my family is asking for more!

Made this according to the recipe. It was very easy!! I would not use the full amount of butter next time as it tasted a bit too buttery for my tastes.

Made this yesterday with fresh peaches.  Husband said it was the best he has ever had :-)  I used 3 medium peaches, and cut the amount of sugar to half a cup mixed in the peaches, and a heaping half cup for the flour mixture.  Did not use nutmeg, and used a few dashes of cinnamon in the peaches, and then a few dashes in the flour mixture.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as written.  Was a little skeptical on using butter as base, flour mix next, and peaches on top.  Peaches sunk during baking, and the cake created a crisp/sugary layer.  Did pull out of the oven at 35-40min, would have been burnt/overdone around the edges if I left in for the 45-50min.  Added to my favorites, very easy, will definitely make again :-)

This was excellent. It was my first attempt at peach cobbler, because I miss my Granny's cooking.  Its easy to make and super good. I didnt make any changes, except that I used a large can of sliced peaches and just sprinkled them with sugar and put 3/4c of sugar in the dough. Will make again and again and with other types of filling. Cherry is next!

Delish! I made it dairy free with almond milk and coconut oil. I left the skins on and cut very small so my 2 yr old could dig in. Next time I'll pour the batter on top of the peaches because they didn't sink... I think they were too light. I also didn't add any sugar to the peaches as they are super sweet already. Definitely a 5 star recipe and easy too!

I elected to delete the Nutmeg and add 1 tsp of cinnamon. Best peach cobbler I've ever had!!

Loved this, simple and yummy. First time making peach cobbler and it came out perfect. It was a huge hit with the family.

Absolutely delicious! I did cut back on the sugar both in mixing with the peaches and a little less in the flour mix. And tried it with cinnamon since we aren't nutmeg fans.

Easy, simple ingredients! I added a little cinnamon to the peaches, and used 6 small-med peaches. I also added vanilla to the milk... and made the cobbler in a brownie pan, instead of a 9x9. The cake turned out spongy, sweet, and delicious.

Delicious, classic. Scrumptious out of the oven with ice cream. Yummy the next morning with coffee.
We got 6 servings, not 12 from the 8x8 pan. Luckily there were only four of us.

Rookie at making cobbler. This was so easy to do. Didn't have nutmeg so just left it out. Didn't miss it.  I kept it in fridge and it got a little 'soupy' by the 3rd day.  Am going to make up a few and freeze for winter.  Will make again.
