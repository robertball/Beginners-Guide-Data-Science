This is great! I shaped the eggs myself, tuck each egg securely on a skewer and completely dipped the rice crispy treat in chocolate. I also did little batches of white chocolate with different food colors, they came out looking like pastel colors which was great! I did one coat, let it harden, another coat let it harden, and one last coat to make sure it was not all bumpy from the rice, and to give it a good solid shell. Once they were coated I stuck the other end of the skewers in a foam plant base. I am ready to do these for easter!

Great treat for the kids!  Instead of the chocolate chips I use the colored bags of chocolate you can get at craft stores.  VERY easy to use and the chocolates come is any color you can dream of!

Made these with my girls yesterday and they loved to shape these.....after adding the marshmellow to the krispies.....you really must wait a little before shaping these....aside from the fact that the marshmallow is hot.....it is just too soft and sticky to form....so wait a few minutes....and seriously butter or spray your hands with cooking spray....makes it so easy to form these lil eggs. And these are super tasty too....what could be better than a rice krispie treat...one with chocolate...I used Nestle' semi-sweet morsels and used pastel colored non-peril sprinkles.....fun recipe for the kiddos! Thanks!

A little hard to mold and I used off brand marshmellows and off brand cereal. And was still good. Also make sure that you use MILK chocolate, not unsweetened chocolate chips.

A very nice idea.  When I melted the chocolate I used a double boiler technique. One large saucepan with water near boiling then chocolate in a smaller saucepan over this so the bottom was in the water but not letting the water overflow into the chocolate. It'll melt perfectly you can leave it there or take it off and put it back at your leisure.  I molded by hands and put a toothpick into each then let them cool. Then I dipped them. Also, I tend to use paraffin wax to temper my chocolate instead of shortening.

Oh dear. I've successfully followed the recipe off the back of the cereal box for years but followed the posted recipe for this one, using margarine (typically used butter) and marshmallow creme as suggested at the bottom (typically, the bagged kind) and boy, this did not turn out. The mallow coating was too thin and while the mix pressed neatly into the plastic eggs (PHENOMENAL idea, thanks!) nothing would hold its shape: ended up pressing into a pan for bars, really PRESSING, and even those fell apart when cut. So, I would try this again using real butter and marshmallows but being slighly superstitious I'll simply use the recipe I know I can follow and take up the technique from there. They did taste good!

I loved this idea but had a hard time melting the chocolate. I used milk chocolate chip morsels and im not sure if thats the right kind. I was disappointed because i LOVED the idea of this recipes. I dont want to down the recipe- i think it was just me.

I thought I would love this recipe since I love rice krispie treats and chocolate, but it wasn't as easy as it looks, and more importantly it was way too sweet. Believe me, when I say something is too sweet- it's WAY too sweet!

Don't skip on the butter for your hands! I kept my butter out and just dipped my fingers into it each time I went to make another egg!

These were so cute and so fun to make!!  Make sure to butter up your hands nice and good when shaping the eggs, the cereal mixture is SUPER sticky.  The chocolate mixture got "sugary" as we were melting it down.  Maybe it was because we used butter instead of shortening or milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet??? I personally found the chocolate & sprinkles to be a little too sweet.. however my parents & aunts and uncles devoured them!!  I look forward to making them again next Easter!!!

I shaped using plastic eggs that I coated with butter. I dipped them in chocolate and decorated.  Had fun making them.

Easy. Fun. Kids love 'em. It does stick to your hands so make sure to butter up your hands well when molding them.

These were so easy and delish.  Thanks for the helpful hint to use a plastic Easter egg to shape the treats, I only needed to spray the inside of the egg the first time with a bit of cooking oil and I used a larger Easter egg.  Cooking oil spray on your hands also helps, and wait about 4-5 minutes after coating the Rice Krispies to shape the eggs otherwise they are just too hot and sticky.  They were the most popular Easter dessert - both children and adults loved them.  All the family members commented on how adorable they were.  Will make again next year!

These were fun, surprisingly easy and were a huge hit at out Easter cookout for church!  I used peanut peanut butter chips, milk chocolate chips, and also put some food coloring in some white almond bark to add some color to the display.  I put them in a large Easter basket with edible Easter grass. I didn't have a single one to take home with me ! ! !

These turned out so cute and were so easy to do! This would be a fun recipe to make with older kids. My 2 yr old just wanted to eat the chocolate off. I would definately recommend spraying your hands with cooking spray though. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!

This was so fun to make with my 16 year old daughter. It was super easy. Definitely use Pam on your hands and in the plastic eggs. Fill the eggs with the warm mixture and press together. It comes out perfect and very easily.  These were a huge hit with the kids and all the adults at the Easter gathers. None left!!!  :)

Only thing I would do differently is freeze the eggs before decorating as I found the melted chocolate was warm enough that the eggs wanted to lose their shape when dipped, otherwise the kids and I loved it and they were a big hit with the inlaws at Easter!  Very creative!

These turned out soooo adorable!!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was sooooo difficult to work with...even after coating my hands in cooking spray!!! Besides the frustrating sticky mess...these turned out great...I seperated my mix into 3 groups and used 3 different food colors to make them look more like easter eggs...loved it!!!! I put them in the baskets I made of home made candies for my family and everyone just loved them.  The only thing was that they had all apparently seen some commercial advertising the same idea (besides the food coloring) the night before (lol) so it kinda took away some of my steam!!! But oh well, everyone still enjoyed them!!

My whole family enjoyed making these and eating them!  We didn't have quite enough chocolate on hand, so we made some with just sprinkles and they turned out great too.

I used Cocoa Krispies for this and colored candy melts in pink, light blue, yellow and lavender to make them look a little more festive for Easter. I nestled them in a pretty bowl filled with Easter grass and they looked adorable. They were a bit of a pain to make but everyone loved them so it was certainly worth putting up with sticky hands for a while. Thank you!

I used half of a plastic easter egg sprayed with cooking spray to shape these, then placed them in a mini muffin pan to harden. I had chocolate leftover after dipping, they are currently firming up in the fridge, look tasty!

I made these last year & they were a big hit with the adults and the kids! I found that using a plastic egg greased with butter ws the easiest way to shape these treats. I also made it easier by buying the microwavable cup of dipping chocolate. It it less messy! I will probably make these again this year!

This was good but Really difficult to deal with.  The eggs were hard to shape and I used a plastic egg as another reciewer had suggested.  And it was so difficult.  This year instead I'm going to lay it out flat and use cookie cutters to cut into egg shapes and then let the kids decorate the eggs.

We had fun making these for my daughter's preschool Easter celebration.  My husband used a large plastic Easter egg coated with butter to shape them. It worked pretty well.  I personally feel like it was too much shortening since the chocolate was very runny and took a long time to set up. Will make these again, super fun.

These were cute, a little messy but cute. My kids ended up only eating the part with chocolate and sprinkles but even the adults loved them. I was lucky to find edible grass for Easter whick made them that more lovely.

We added peanut butter to our Krispies.  Nice change for the same old treats!  Will make again.  Thanks!
