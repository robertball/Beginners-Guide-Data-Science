This recipe is fantastic!!  I always get asked for the recipe.  I make it in a 9x13 pan.  I also put a light layer of bananas between brownie and pudding layers when serving immediately (as I don't like strawberries).

Not a bad recipe. Make way too much filling, I used about half of it. Please chill the filling for at least 30 minutes. 5 minutes simply isn't long enough, it is still runny after just 5 minutes.

This is absolutely delicious. I've made it several times and it is always a hit. I used 2 cheesecake pans that were slightly different sizes, but was able to shave off some of the larger one with a knife and it still looked very appetizing. Also, I did not use all the custard when layering. Extra custard can be used for dipping fruit. Delicious!

Another big hit! Instead of making it and a layered cake look I did a trifle wish I would have taken a picture.

I've had this recipe for 10 years & have brought it to numerous group functions.  EVERY time I make it I'm always asked for the recipe, without fail.  Even people on diets can't resist.  It tastes great & looks beautiful.  Fruit & chocolate covers all the bases.  It's soooooo simple to make.  I love it!
