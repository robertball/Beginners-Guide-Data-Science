I really wanted to like this--it was fast, easy, and a nutritious dinner. However, the flavor and spices on the salmon were all in competition with each other--so the end result was a rather unpleasant, almost medicinal flavor. The cinnamon, orange, oregano, and smoked paprika are just not very complimentary flavors. They all try to takeover, and in this recipe, none of them did--which created a not-so-good overall flavor. And the dressing for the salad was so acidic that it was also unpleasant to eat as well. I'm surprised that with that much vinegar and mustard that there was no sweetener to balance it out. Overall, I wanted to try something different, and this was definitely different. I don't think I'll be making it again though. Sorry.
