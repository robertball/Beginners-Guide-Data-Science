These are much better if you dip them in chocolate AFTER you dip them in caramel.  I usually dip them in the caramel,let that sit for a moment, then dip them in melted milk chocolate and drizzle some melted white chocolate over the top.  The presentation is beautiful and they taste wonderful!

I dipped each rod (I used jumbo 8" rods) in the caramel (leaving about a 2 1/2 inch "handle") put them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet (next time I think I will try to get them supported in a glass so that the caramel doesn't pool up at the end) & stuck them in the freezer for a couple of hours. Then I dipped them in ghiradelli dipping chocolate & coated them in the chopped peanuts. (I only used peanuts on the very end of the rods to give them a truly gourmet look). These are soo tasty! They taste like a twix candy bar, only much better.

Great recipe!  I cut the pretzel rods in half (to better fit on the goodie tray) and dipped in caramel and chocolate.  Let the caramel set and then dip in chocolate.  If the caramel "pools" on one side while setting, roll the rods to smooth out the caramel after it has set.  You can do so many things with this recipe, so many options for coating the rods.....nuts, candies, colored drizzles, sprinkles, etc.

I opted for this recipe because it seemed so easy. My two friends and I made them together, one dipped them in caramel, I did the chocolate, and one topped them with nuts. We poured and smoothed the caramel with a spoon, let it sit for a minute or two, then did the same for the chocolate. The peanuts went on right away else the chocolate hardened and was no longer tacky. It was a sticky mess, but the end product was way worth it - thus the 5 stars. They are ABSOLUTELY delicious, better than store bought. I couldnt imagine doing them alone, the caramel and chocolate do get cold/hard and then the pretzels break. It would even be fun to do with kids. But, do try them, they are awesome and addicting, and worthy of many compliments.

I thought that these were amazing! I changed the recipe a little.  I dipped them in caramel like the recipe called for then I rolled them in a mixture of mini chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, toffee chips, and chopped walnuts.  I also didn't add the extra layer of chocolate on top in fear of making it too sweet.  My family and friends LOVED them and asked for the recipe...  Another great all recipes website recipe!  Thank you

Yummy! Made these the other night for our departmental bake sale...they almost didn't make it to work. I found that the caramel did a little better when it hardened up just a little - after melting, I set it off the heat for a few minutes, then used the back of a spoon to smear on the pretzel rods. I didn't have any trouble with the caramel running all over the place once I put them on parchment paper to 'set' before covering with chocolate. I changed up the toppings a little - used chopped roasted peanuts (used my mini food chopper to chop 'em up fine), shredded coconut, chopped white chocolate, and multi-colored sprinkles. I didn't put all the toppings on one rod - I made a variety. The only thing I didn't like about this recipe is the use of pre-packaged caramels - it took a while to unwrap all those little buggers. However, I used what I had left over in my baking stash - next time I think I'll try making caramel from scratch. I had some caramel, chocolate, and toppings leftover, so I threw all the toppings together in with the caramel, stirred it up a little, rolled into small balls, then dropped them in the chocolate. A nice little surprise. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these at Christmas time and gave away to neighbors and friends with homemade cookies.  The favorite was the one with chocolate and rolled in crushed butterfinger candy.  Just freeze the candy and beat up in a plastic bag.  I recommend laying down either wax paper or plastic because of the drips and mess. but oh so easy and oh so good

I found this recipe to be a bit more time consuming than I had expected.  However, it was very good.  I found it helpful to have my "assembly line" of toppings ready to go.  If you like peanut butter, you will love this.  The combination of ingredients makes this a very thick, peanut butter-y tasting sort of treat.  Definitely have a beverage available.  I will make this again.

These things are awesome!  I let the caramel cool slightly then spread on the pretzels first, then pressed mini M&M's into the caramel.  Placed on parchment and popped in the refrigerator for just a few minutes, then drizzled in melted dark chocolate.  I also did some with caramel, dark chocolate and crushed toffee bar - those were good too! I'm looking forward to making more of these, and experimenting with different combinations.

These are great!  Tastes just like a twix bar the way I made them.  I used caramel bits by Kraft, which melt up quickly, and you don't have to unwrap.  TIP:  Place a piece of wax paper on a cookie sheet and spray it with non-stick cooking spray REALLY WELL. If you don't do this, the caramel WILL stick!  Coat the pretzel rods with the caramel (spreading with a small spoon works well), then place on the cookie sheet, and put cookie sheet in the refrigerator to set.  While mine were in the frig, I melted about 3/4 of a bag of milk chocolate chips in the microwave.  I spread the melted chocolate over the set caramel with a spoon. Then drizzled with melted white chocolate and sprinkled with Halloween sprinkles. Works well if you have help in this step.  I was doing the milk chocolate, my son drizzled the white and my daugter decorates with the sprinkles.  These were a big hit with my Sunday school class for a Halloween treat!  Will make these again, I'm sure.

These were pretty easy (but a bit time consuimg) to make.  They were a pretty big hit too, alot of people suggested dipping it in chocolate instead of the caramel.

The caramel melted pretty nicely, although I heated in 30 sec. spurts.  Next time I will spray the wax paper with some cooking spray since they stuck to it pretty badly.  I lost a few peeling them off.  We coated in chocolate after the caramel cooled and decorated with crushed butterfingers & kitkats, sprinkles, m&m's.  Great use for all that left over Halloween candy!

You really can't go wrong with these. Caramel, chocolate, pretzels.. They're delicious!  After making around 100 rods, here are my words of advice. Thin the caramel a lot; it makes it much easier to work with.. the thicker the caramel the more often the pretzels break.  To remove excess caramel, spin the rod against the side of your pan (I used a small crockpot and it worked wonderfully). DON'T lay the caramels on WAX PAPER!  Some may have already known this but I didn't.. big mistake!  Next time I'll try parchment paper.  But because we used wax paper, the only way we were able to get them to release was by laying the paper/pretzels on a slightly warmed burner (glasstop stove).  It worked but wasn't preferred.  We decorated with holiday sprinkles and the end result was beautiful.  Perfect project for a Girls' Day In :)

I've been making versions of these pretzels for years. They are always a hit at bake sales. Here are 2 hints that may help you when making them.   Purchase those ice cube trays that make ice cubes that are long and skinny.  The cubes will fit down the neck of water/drink bottles.  The pretzels fit perfect in there and will dry/harden perfectly in there. If the pretzels are a little short, crumble up paper and put inside the ice cube tube.  If selling them, use the same tray but cover in a brown bag or paper and then tie a pretty ribbon around it.  I find the brown bag works easiest, cheapest, and looks great w/the ribbon.  2. To wrap the pretzels I'll just buy that clear,stiff plastic wrapping paper at the $ stores.  (The kind you can use to wrap baskets, etc.)  I either seal them w/clear tape or I'll cut the pieces long and tie the ends w/curling ribbon.  These are great year round, for all holidays, but our favorite is during During Halloween, we decorate them by sprinkling fall-Halloween theme cupcake/cake sprinkles on them, wrap them and call them Witches Wands.

I let these set on the wax paper after dipping the caramel and planned to then dip them in the chocolate.  I am not sure if I let them sit too long??? but the caramel was glued to the wax paper and couldn't be peeled off.  I had to throw them out.  Don't wait to dip them in chocolate like I did or they will be ruined!

These are one of my favorite things to make during the holidays!  One thing I do a bit differently is instead of using a tablespoon of water I use 2 tablespoons evaporated milk.  I also use a 2 cup pyrex glass measuring cup, once the caramel is melted I pour what will fit in the measuring cup.  It makes is really easy to dip the pretzels and less messy.  I scrape the bottom of the pretzel on the spout of the measuring cup.  Plus if the caramel starts to cool to much you can just pop it in the microwave.  And, since I like to do these in batches, I just refrigerate any leftovers I have right in the measuring cup, it's easy to reheat and use another day.  I use a variety of mini chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, mini M & M's, crushed health bars, pecans, butterscotch chips and any thing else I have in the house.  I don't usually dip them again in chocolate, it's really not needed in my opinion.

Very yummy. I take the pretzels, dip them in the caramel, roll them in nuts after it's set up a bit, and then generously drizzle white and semi-sweet chocolate over the top. perfect for gifts.

My daughter is running for Student Body Secretary so we made 4 batches of these to hand out in hopes of some campaign votes. :0) We did it in steps and that made a bit of a difference. First we painted the caramel on and placed on wax paper sprayed with Pam until set (about 15 min.) Then we melted our Chocolate and painted it on and let sit. Finally, when that was set, we melted two bowls of  white chocolate that we thinned out with some Crisco and tinted to match her school colors and drizzled over the top. Very pretty and very yummy! We were lucky enough to find 'Pretzel Bags' in the baking section at our local Walmart to give them out in. Great idea, thank you for posting the recipe Jeannie!

I made these last year and they are impossible to mess up. The easiest Christmas dessert in the world. We dip ours in chocolate first then roll in nuts or candy and drizzle with homemade caramel.(Homemade caramel is also super easy, basically it's just melted sugar and a little butter and cream or milk..) Anyway, no tips or tricks it is really fun and simple and really impresses people when you show up with them!!

We made our own caramel using 2 C sugar
1 C corn syrup 1 C butter and a can of condensed milk - Homemade caramel worked well, but next time I may try melting caramel candies..sounds a little easier. I was nervous the pretzels might be too sweet and stick to teeth but everyone LOVED them, and they looked cute!

these are time consuming, but definitely worth it! i've been making chocolate covered pretzels for years, but somehow never thought to do caramel!! I melted the caramels and water in my slow cooker- while they were melting, i prepped a baking sheet with greased foil- i used a spoon to coat the pretzels, then popped the tray in the fridge for 15mins to cool before coating with chocolate- taste just like Twix! I did a few with just caramel, and pressed mini m&ms into them while the caramel was still hot- they are cute! so take the time to make these if you want to impress someone!

You can do so much with these! I made them 2 Christmases ago, and I remember rolling them in the chocolate, and then we sprinkled all kind of little candy things on them, and nuts. At the family party, the ones that went fast were the ones that had crushed up plain Lays potato chips on them! we were eating chips while making these, and horsing around, so someone came up with the idea. Have made them again since, and ...yep! They are darn good! Get inventive!

These are amazing, I feel like a gourmet candy chef! I used parchment paper and I still had to spray it to keep from sticking. I used kraft caramel bits, they were very easy to melt and work with. After the caramel had hardened in the freezer I covered it with semi-sweet chocolate and drizzled with white chocolate. I rolled a few in crushed pecans. Would make a great treat for bridal/baby showers sprinkled with the colors of the theme. Can't wait to make again.

Fantastic...the caramel came out perfectly!    I used a variety of toppings and coatings.  - Caramel layer, then a chocolate layer, vanilla drizzle. - Caramel layer, then a melted peanutbutter chips layer, sprinkled with mini M&Ms.  I also used mixed chopped nuts, Andes Mints, and colorful sugar sprinkles.  Lots of fun to make.  Be creative!

Great Recipe.  I broke the rods in half and only did half the amount of caramel at a time, just in case I ruined it.  I didn't really measure out the water, but it seems the less you use, the thicker your caramel will be on your pretzels.  I like it thick, so when you put it on parchment paper, it gathers in a little pool.  More caramel to cover in chocolate!  Put the caramel sticks in the fridge or freezer to harden.  They were so much easier to work with cold.  But once they're covered it chocolate, you don't have to worry about that anymore.  No nuts for me, but I did add white chocolate for presentation.  They were sooooo delicious!  Definitely something I'll make every year, or every other year for christmas.

Excellent! I made these Salted Caramel Chocolate Pretzels with a couple of changes to look and taste.  Instead of water I used milk or you can also use condensed milk instead of water in the caramels. The other change was to the method in that I drizzled the chocolate over on an angle so you could see the caramel underneath. I sprinkled a pinch of kosher salt to finish them off.  The salt really punches up the flavour.

Super Easy + Delicious = 5 STARS!! The caramel layer sets them apart from your normal dipped pretzels. I used both white chocolate and vanilla almond bark.  I preferred the white chocolate version. I let the caramel dry before dipping in chocolate layer.  Make sure to spray oil on your wax paper to prevent the caramel from sticking to it while hardening.

This is a great idea but it needed a little help to make it perfect.  First, I melted the caramels in the crockpot.  Then, I melted white and dark almond bark in pans on the stove.  I used the back of a spoon to "swirl" the caramel on the rods.  Was a little difficult and time consuming, but worth it.  Let those cool and harden.  Then, dip in almond bark.  Before hardened, sprinkle nuts, andes pieces, crushed reeses or toffee bits before almond bark is hardened.  Then use the leftover almond bark in contrasiting colors to drizzle over rods.  Perfect!  Used 1T. of water for 2 bags of caramels, turned out perfectly chewy.

I initially melted the caramel in the microwave. I used MacIntosh's caramel bars ( i like this better than the individual caramels).  The caramel kept getting hard so I transferred the caramel to a  pot sprayed with Pam, heat on lowest setting.  The caramel stayed warm, this made it tons easier to dip & cover the pretzels. Did the same with the chocolate.....used milk & dark choc. They were a hit at my party!

OMGoodness OMGoodness! These were terrific. I made them for a party I had for my neices and nephews and what a great recipe for kids to help with! I was unsure of "candy coated chocolate" so I used milk chocolate peices. I sent some to work with my husband and he said they went like crazy! Thank you for such a WONDERFUL, EASY recipe!

We received as a Christmas gifts.  They were very good.  Each gift was garnished with two of the chocolate dipped pretzel rods securly wrapped and tied to the top with a ribbon.  It was beautiful and delicious!  I opened my pretzels in mid-January and they were still very good.  Looking forward to using this idea in years to come.

Delicious. I dipped some of the pretzel rods in caramel, then into m&ms. I dipped the rest into peanut butter and milk  chocolate chips. They came out great. Just be careful about how hot the caramel is, as it can melt the chocolate and peanut butter chips.

These were so good. Just like the ones that cost a fortune in the chocolate stores.  I made these for holiday treat bags for third graders. I would not suggest that. It took way too much time and after watching them inhale them, I decided it was too much work for that. The prep time is way longer than 5 minutes. It takes forever to unwrap the caramels. Once you get that done they are fairly easy to make but do take time. The topping possibilities are endless. After dipping in caramel, I rolled the pretzel in a mixture of chopped peanuts, mini chocolate chips and holiday sprinkles. Then I drizzled with white chocolate and sprinkled on a few more sprinkles. I found some pretzel bags at the craft store. I think they turned out really cute. If the caramel starts to firm up just pop it back in the microwave for a few seconds.

Made these last night for the holidays. Bought Dark Chocolate disks from AC Moore... Used the double boiler method to melt... First bag was a bust. I learned with the second package that you MUST keep the water boiling the entire time you are melting/dipping. You cant turn the flame down/off after the chocolate melts. If you do, it turns rock hard like fudge. This is probably why melting in the microwave doesnt work out well.  So keep a steady boil going while dipping. I dipped a whole bag of rods and then about 1/2 bag of pretzel snaps (waffle shaped) just half the pretzel. I sprinkled them with some green/white mint chip decorations I found. They ended up tasting like a Mint Girl Scout Cookie! This recipe is really versatile!  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe! It was so easy and didn't take long. I brought these to a Christmas party and they were gone within minutes! 
Like other people have done, I also dipped them in melted chocolate after I dipped them in caramel and let the caramel set. Also, rather than crushed nuts, I drizzled white chocolate over them. The presentation looked amazing and they tasted great! Thanks for this incredibly recipe that I will use again and again!

I made these using caramel bits instead of indivdually wrapped caramels. I dipped rods as well as the large sourdough pretzels.  I did not completely cover the the sourdough pretzels with caramel as they are quite large.  I then dipped them in a combination of dark chocolate and chocolate almond bark.  Add some sprinkles and/or white chocolate drizzle and they were beautiful. Tasted delicious too!
