Absolutely wonderful.  I used my own ground pork shoulder because it has an excellent fat to meat ratio that keeps the sausage moist without coming out greasy.  Mix it up and put in the fridge overnight before either freezing or cooking so the flavors can mingle.  I no longer buy store made sausage as I think this tastes much more superior than what is in the stores.

This was great! I did not have any anise, so I substituted fennel seed- and left it whole. Very tasty!  A bit too salty for our taste, next time I'll just reduce the amount.

Oh please people. splurge now and then,  use the pork, you know, the other white meat?  forget the turkey.  this is sausage, to be savoured and tasted and enjoyed.  use turkey for your burgers, but not for sausage for pizzas and meatballs.  Have we forgotten that lean pork is as healthy as turkey?   Loved this recipe, and I make a lot of sausage and smoke it too. Good job.   Makes a great Sausage and Eggs breakfast to. I can really appreciate the after much experimentation. been there, done that.  but that is what we good cooks do. lol. try and try til we get it right, and someone will change it, but that is ok, we are happy with what we got.  Keep submitting Lee. Good recipe.  I like it.

To make this a little lighter (and maybe a little more cost effective, depending on how great your shopping skills are), you can substitute ground chicken or turkey for the ground pork and still have it come out tasting like italian sausage. This is one of my favorite go-to recipes for when I'm making breakfast sausage. Even my ground turkey/chicken hating husband loves this recipe. For a sweeter sausage flavor, I like to add either a tablespoon or so of brown sugar or maple syrup.

This is a very tasty sausage. I don't care for anise and substituted fennel seed. Since we had butchered a whole hog, I had the butcher prepare the fresh ground pork, and I made 10 lbs. of this recipe and froze it. 
Thanks, Lee, for this recipe and the one for breakfast sausage.

This sausage is EXCELLENT and SO much healthier than commercial brands.  I used 1-1/2 lbs. of regular ground turkey, and all the spices required for the 2 lbs. of pork, except that I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp. and subbed 1/4 tsp. anise extract for the seeds.  It made enough sausage topping for 2 large pizzas.  VERY, VERY GOOD.

This turned out very well.  I used 3 lbs. of lean ground turkey and doubled the spices except for the anise seed, since I didn't have any.  I can't wait to use it in all my favorite sausage recipes.  I've been looking for a good recipe to make turkey sausage with and this fit the bill.  Next time I may add more spice.;)

Very good but would add fennel seed next time and bit of oil to moisten.  I froze patties and cooked when needed.

I also substituted fennel seed for the anise seed (used 1 tsp because we like fennel).  Left out the salt entirely, and used ground turkey.  Very good!

All 8 of my kids and my husband have refused to go back to store bought sausage since trying this! I get pork roasts on sale and grind my own meat so there is almost no grease at all and having a large family, this makes sausage WAYYYYYY cheaper for us!!!

Authentic Italian sausage flavor!  I subbed fennel for anise and added only a dash of red pepper flakes.

I also used ground turkey breast. I also used fennel instead of anise- it's what I had & I do like it! Threw some in some spaghetti sauce. I'll bet it will be great on pizza. I'd like to try it with the pork- maybe. I dunno. Pork is kinda nasty- except for bacon!!!

The best.  I triple this recipe and freeze a in portions.  I then mix with ziti or manicotti when I make it.  I highly recommend this sausage recipe.

Great.  I could not find the plain ground pork so I used the Jimmy Dean sausage.  I added the spices as specified.  It was very good.  I froz the leftovers for another pie.   Next time I will not cook the sausage mixture until quite done.  It got a little black in the oven.  But tasted great. I made, also from this site, Jays Signature pizza crust and the easy pizza sauce.  I am from NJ the home of great Pizza Pie and this was mixture was just as good as we have here.  I will make this again.  Thanks

I ended up using extra lean turkey (1g fat per serving) for this...and didn't like it at all!!  :(
I was hoping to use it in my lasagna (since lasagna is fattening in general, I was hoping to cut it down a bit!!) but it really didn't work well.  In the future I may try regular fat turkey, or try lean ground pork.  I really have faith that this will be a great recipe....just not with extra lean turkey!!

I used Hormel Spicy Pork sausage. It was definitely spicy, and I followed this recipe almost exactly (I used fennel seeds instead of anise.) So flavorful, and so delicious! This will become a staple for my dinner recipes.

Multiplied the ingredient amounts by 8 to season 11.5 lbs of ground venison. Only used 2 tsp of salt due to reviewers comments. Did not have dried onion in the pantry. Used 2 tsp crushed red pepper. This may be a keeper. I'm refrigerating the mix over night and will cook a sample in 24 hrs and adjust seasonings as needed before freezing portioned meat.

LOVE this recipe!  I use it on pizza and in lasagna and spaghetti... very versatile.  The spices and seasonings are terrific.  I increase all seasonings by 1/2 their amount, but I keep the salt the same.  I have done this with ground turkey, and it works really well.  I like to mix up the meat and then let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours to "marinate" first - flavors really mesh together well then.  Also, to save time, I scale the recipe to 60 or more servings and then mix up all the seasoning ingredients in a jar for future use.  I have also mixed up the meat & frozen it for future use - both cooked and uncooked freeze equally well.

This was soo delicious! I had one pound of ground turkey that I needed to use up, and this was perfect. The measurements are spot on. When I buy some ground pork, I'll make pork sausage, but both ways are delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe for turkey sausage!  I did, of course, tweak it a bit.  I added 1/2 the salt.  I added fennel seed and used the Italian Seasoning from the Tuscany Bread Dipping Herbs that I get from the supermarket, in addition to all of the other herbs and spices.  My husband loved this recipe!!

This was a good, simple recipe to follow. I don't like anise so I skipped that, but now I wish I read the reviews before cooking- I would have added fennel. I will definitely put this on my "try again" list.

Great sausage recipe. I like to make my own and this one tastes just like the mild italian that you would purchase in a store.

I liked the concept, but this didn't have enough seasonings. I would probably do this again, but add more seasonings.

I'd cut the salt back to 1 tsp. only. It was a great tasting sausage, just a bit too salty. All the other spices were "right on" :) I always add in a bit extra red pepper flakes, spicy is good! I also did NOT have the anise, so I used crushed Fennel seeds. It gave it the same flavor.

This is a humdinger of a good recipe, I didn't have the Anise seeds but saw that other people also made it without and I didn't add the salt, but then I cook without salt anyway.  We used it in the 'Sausage Pasta' recipe also from this site. If I could give more stars then I would. Thank you for sharing.

This is the best italian sausage I have ever had...better than store bought. I have also used a combination of medium ground beef and pork, medium ground beef and venison...the results were great although I do perfer the pork and beef mixture as well as the all pork. I usually cook the meat mixture into very small balls and then freeze them in freezer bags for those times I want to add to soups or sauces. These are great in Italian Wedding soup. I have also made the meat mixture into little patties and frozen to use latter for breakfast. Thank you soooo much for such a fantastic recipe!!

Very good sausage!  Where we live (Mexico) Italian sausage is not readily available but some comfort foods from home (like meatloaf) really need it.  Never would I have considered actually making my own!  Very easy recipe.  I go a little heavy on the spices and use fresh garlic & onion.  A word of warning, I am accustomed to sausage with a longer shelf life because all of the preservatives.  Just takes a little adjusting to remember to freeze what you aren't going to use right away, besides, it freezes very well.

Followed the recipe exactly, using lean ground pork. I made the mixture into patties and grilled them on the BBQ. Excellent! Will definitely make this again.

Like other reviewers, I was in search of a recipe to make Italian sausage since I cannot have many of the additives (mostly MSG) in commercially-prepared sausage.  We moved and I could no longer find sausage without additives.

Even if you *can* eat commercial sausage, DON'T - make this and you'll never make anything else!!!  I used 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 fresh ground turkey (better texture than frozen).  This cuts the fat content, and it's still so great!  I did add whole fennel seeds like other reviewers.  I used this in pasta sauce the first time and can't wait to try it on pizza!

If you haven't tried Lee Fogle's Breakfast Sausage recipe - YOU MUST!  It's also fantastic!  THANK YOU!!!!

I can't eat store-bought Italian Sausage because of all the junk they put in it, so this was a great find. I added a couple pinches of caraway seeds because it seemed to be missing something and it was perfect. My husband and two of my three kids liked it better than the stuff from the store!

I made this to put on pizza's, I didn't have any Italian Style seasoning, so I made my own and added to this with a fresh package of pork sausage from a butchered whole hog, this is perfect!  And my husband loves it!  Thank you for the recipe!

Now that i'm trying to cut down on salt, fat and preservative I search for recipes for much craved ready to cook foods. After reading some of the recipes here for homemade sausages, I've decided to try this one. Love love loved it. I made it with half beef and half chicken. Only other thing I did was added ground cloves and allspice. It is one of the best I've tasted. Next batch I'll add some oil to the mixture because this batch was little dry do to the fact that the ground meats I had on hand was very lean.  Otherwise excellent recipe. Thanks.

Love this recipe as long as I double the seasonings except for the salt.  I used 3 tsp of salt.  I also substituted the anise for whole fennel seeds.  Fabulous flavor.  Thank you for this recipe post.

I did not have dried parsley, but other than that, I used everything else in the recipe.  Delicious homemade sausage! I will reduce the crushed red pepper flakes next time for the kids, but boy was this flavorful and wonderful.  Look forward to making it again.

I like this, I scale it down to 4 when I only have a pound of ground pork. This ups the spices and it's very good. Substitute fennel for anise.

This recipe was a pleasant surprise to find as I always hate having to buy premade Italian Sausage links and then get the meat out of the casings to use.  I made the whole batch and froze in 1/2 pound amounts.  I used one to make the Italian Sausage Lasagna recipe here on AR which was wonderful!  I think when I make this again, and I will, I will increase the amount of seasonings but this is just a personal preference.  I did use fennel seed instead of anise, just because it is what I had.  Thanks for this recipe!

My husband loves this sausage... we have used in sauce as well as on pizza.   Also, works well with 1/2 recipe.  Very easy to also add more or less spice as needed.

I needed Italian sausage for a soup I was making and didn't have any on hand, so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of pork, and I didn't have any anise seed or fennel seed (don't care for either one), so I just left it out.  The flavor was spot-on and went perfectly in my soup.  I'll use this recipe from now on whenever a recipe calls for crumbled Italian sausage.

My girlfriend and I LOVED THEM! Minor mods: had no anise so used fennel. Used a bit of hot sauce as I don't like 'spicy'. No minced onion so I used minced garlic. Rolled them into sausage shapes - served up with spagetti & sauce.  Light years better than store bought.

Very good! Tastes just like we expected. I much prefer making my own foods and now I have 1 more item I don't have to buy. I used this for a sausage and mushroom pizza for my DH, and he liked it. This is a great base recipe and fantastic as is. Thanks Lee for sharing this!

So good, and really healthy compared to normal sausages! We have a pork additives allergy in my family, and for the longest time have not been able to eat them because of it. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Wow.  I was just looking for a way to use up the leftover ground pork from last night and I discovered the ONLY way I'll do italian sausage from now on.  It's just as good as the stuff you get from the store and the ground pork I used was 96% lean.  I didn't have anise, so I used fennel as a substitute like some other did and I discovered that I love the stuff.  I even added extra.  I left out the red peppers because of my picky seven year old, but did everything else according to the recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you!

So much better than store bought sausage. I substituted fennel for the anise out of necessity and doubled the red pepper flakes out of preference.  I used 90% lean ground pork and formed 2 ounce patties that we grilled.  Will keep this recipe (and my changes) and try on pizza and in breakfast quiches.  Delicious!

Didn't have the anise seeds, but it was great without. Glad I looked for a recipe instead of just putting plain cooked sausage on our pizza. This was much better.

Seasonings are perfect, I did however substitute ground turkey because of the diet I’m on and it turned out delicious. I mixed it all together and refrigerated overnight before cooking.

I swapped the pork for ground turkey and the results were amazing. This recipe is great for making crumbles for sausage gravy or my personal homemade pizza fries.

Definitely want to use fennel seed. Preferably roasted and cracked. Pork and fennel seed.. perfect marriage and very traditional. I am currently living in Brazil and cannot buy Italian sausage here, so I have to make it. Im a professional cook and living here has forced me to learn many, many things in order to eat good food.

Great recipe! I added crushed fennel though, and cut back on the salt by half ( hubby is on a low sodium diet). The entire family enjoyed, made two pounds and it was gone in one meal. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it with us. Will make it again and again.

This was very Good! I didn't have anise seeds so I used fennel instead. I also used ground venison since I didn't have any ground pork. It was very good and we put it on pizza. Everyone liked it.

I had to improvise with some of the herbs. However, even with the improvisations, it still turned out delicious!!! I'm impressed. Jolly good show. You can bet I'll be making this one again.

I use this recipe with wild pig meat that I get from hunting and it always turns out great; I'd say that the flavor is as good as anything you'd buy from the grocery store and has MUCH less fat than store bought sausage if you're using wild pork or lean ground pork. I use the sausage on pizza, in spaghetti sauces, in calzones, or whatever else might call for Italian Sausage.

I changed a few things that made this simple recipe awesome. I heated 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over med-high heat, adding in a diced onion & diced green pepper. Sauted this until onion was translucent. Then added a pound roll of Italian sausage. Added all seasonings & replaced sage with fennel seeds. Browned the meat & thoroughly incorporated seasonings into it. I didn't have any fat to drain, and the olive oil really sealed in the flavors. Letting the sausage sit in covered glass bowl overnight to meld. Then will transfer to smaller freezer portion sized bags tomorrow. You can do so much with this mixture. I'm making homemade strombolies with a small batch to start out that I'll let simmer in a homemade tomato sauce. The house smells wonderful while making this recipe. With ingredients you normally have on hand anyway, this is excellent!!

I made this, and it was great.  I also substituted the Anise for fennel seeds.  I mixed it all up in the morning and let the spices mix into the meat all day before cooking up and using it as a pizza topping.  I also only used 1 lb of meat, but used the amount of spices that was called for 2 lbs.   My husband loved it too.

Yum.  I added a little cayenne pepper more for flavor than heat.  Skipped the anise as I didn't have any and did not miss it.  This tasted so fresh!

This is awesome! I needed Italian sausage for a ziti dish I was making, and found I had none, but I had a pound of ground pork. I adjusted the amounts accordingly, and subbed fennel for anise as I had no anise, and it came out really good. I almost wanted to eat just a bowl of crumbled cooked sausage! lol

Quite good, but I add about 1.5 times the spices to get a stronger flavor. I also left out the anise and it was still good. I also did 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for a better taste.

This "Italian Style Sausage" would in fact make an excellent topping for pizza. I made mine into patties and baked them in the oven and they smelled exactly like pizza cooking. Thank you Lee Fogle for sharing your recipe.

Fantastic!  So easy too...don't bother to mix in a separate bowl, I just added the spices to the pan with the meat.  I love fennel so I used that in place of anise. Didn't have paprika so I left that out too.  You must try this, it is soooo good and soooo easy to make.  Makes awesome crumbles as well as patties.

Great recipe!
I took this one and ran with it, adding 10 pounds of elk and multiplying all the ingredients by 5. It turned out great! Can't go wrong here!

One complaint though: The recommendation of salt is WAY TOO much. I did 3/4 of the recommended amount and although I thought it tasted great, my dad thought it was too salty. Salt can make or break a recipe. Just be wary.

Besides that, it's good to go.

Happy eating!

Reduced the salt by 50%, added about 3/4 cups finely chopped tart apples, and a couple of teaspoons of bread crumbs as it was pretty moist.  Patties cooked on the grill

Great jumping off recipe! My boyfriend and I love spicy so we tweaked it a little.  We were also out of parsley .  We doubled the pepper flakes, doubled the Italian seasoning, added 1 tsp sage, 1 tsp fennel seeds and  1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. Delicious!!! Will make over and over.   We are also watching cholesterol so we did half lean pork and half lean ground chicken breast.

Wonderful flavor exactly as written. I haven't bought ready made sausages since I discovered this recipe, sveral years ago. Much healthier than store bought. I have even tried it as a meatlloaf with a few extra ingredients!

This is a great starting point for a mix of spices for Italian sausage, easily tweak-able to individual preferences. I like to reduce the salt and increase everything else by just a bit, subbing out some of the anise for fennel. Also usually use a mix of pork and turkey. Thanks for the recipe!

Nice recipe. A bit too much salt for me (easily adjustable) and I too used fennel vs anise seed. I used the flavor profile as written but used different mediums on some (such as pasted roasted garlic, and finely minced sweet onion). Added a bit of a white balsamic and olive oil too. What I do (and suggest) regarding salt: start with 1/2 the salt, then, after allowing sausage to rest overnight, fry up a small portion and taste it cooked - add more salt and/or adj seasonings to your liking.  Also: Got a big kick out of CountryRay (May 2010)review. Couldn't of said it better myself! Use the pork ppl :) I do grind my own using pork butt or shoulder. It's worth it to me. Thanks for the recipe Lee.

Great start but a little under seasoned. Next time I'll add a bit more of the spices and possibly some fennel seeds as well. But I will certainly be keeping this recipe and using it over and over. I put it into my homemade marinara sauce and I was really pleased. Thanks!

Really easy and delicious. I didn't have anise, so I left it out. I will be making this frequently!

This was just ok. I didn't hate it, but I won't be using it again. There's a few, much better Italian sausage recipes out there. Maybe I just like it spicier than most, but I wasn't impressed.

I halved the recipe and wish I hadn't--I didn't taste as much of the sausage flavor as I would've liked.  I'm a bit of a spice fiend, though, so I don't think that is a reflection on the recipe.  For me, I'd have preferred it being doubled.  Bf didn't notice a thing, though, so it must be me.  I added in fennel seeds along with the anise since I love fennel flavor.  I'll definitely come back to this and flavor with more anise and fennel next time.  thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for this! I accidentally bought a HUGE amount of ground pork instead of beef so I wanted a good recipe to use with it. This was great! I liked the  anise...gave a totally different flavor. I thought I didn't have garlic powder, so I substituted 1 tsp. garlic salt and reduced the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. Worked out great. Thanks!

I used ground turkey and the flavor is perfect, just the right amount of all the spices! I did use fennel seed instead of anise (because we just like it). Ground turkey tends to get dry when it is cooking so we added olive oil. We love this recipe!

I love this. I love the idea of making our own sausage. I get organic grass-fed ground pork from my farmer. I do add fennel seeds and omit the garlic powder (I just use fresh garlic, crushed).

I used this recipe with ground lean turkey to put on pizza with sauteed mushrooms and skim mozzarella cheese (trying to be more healthy). 

I don't like sausage typically (something about the flavor/texture), but it did taste like sausage, and I did eat some of it. And my fiance seemed to like it, even though he usually hates all forms of turkey. Not a bad recipe, and it's probably a lot better with ground pork.

I didn't change the recipe at all and it turned out great.  It's a little on the mild side, but that's what I was looking for.  Next time I'll probably double the spices for even better flavor.
