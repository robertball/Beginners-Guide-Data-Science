This was a nice change from my go-to chili recipe. It was quick to get together and didn't have an excessive amount of ingredients like some chili recipes do. For extra flavor, I added 1/2 tsp. of cumin and used chili style diced tomatoes.  I followed the "cooks notes" at the end of the recipe and used ground turkey instead of beef.  Perfect for a cold wintry night!

This was perfect for a chilly Fall evening.  I followed the recipe as written, but omitted the optional jalapeno pepper:  the hot Italian sausage I used, paired with the cayenne pepper, gave it enough of a kick for us!

Simple, easy, and delicious. I had only meant to make this once, but it has been so popular, I have been making it every week for three weeks. Even my 11 year old niece can't get enough.

I used mild Italian sausage and substituted 1 can of Kidney beans. I used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, 2 cans of original Rotel and 2 ribs of chopped celery. Turned out great. Best chili ever. Will definitely make it again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I won the chili contest in our small group with this recipe. I did had another tablespoon of chili powder and a teaspoon of red pepper. It was very good. This will be my go too recipe. Oh I also cooked t in a crockpot after browning the meat.

I added one can of pinto beans, and one can of black bean, and also a can of whole corn. Also, I added another 15 oz. can of tomatoes.
 
I can honestly say, this is my new favorite of all time. I will be making this often, and for my son...he will LOVE IT!!!

Great easy recipe. Added a little yellow, red, and orange peppers for color. Also added small can of petite diced tomatoes with jalapeno instead of adding jalapeno. Loved it!!

Good chili!  I didn't have any diced tomatoes on hand, so I used 1 can of whole tomatoes and 1 can of tomato soup.  I had to add extra spice to it, so I added more chili powder, garlic, and cumin.  Tastes good!

I made this on a chilly Washington state day.  It was great!  I followed the recipe except I added a little more chill powder and a bit of cumin.  AND of course, it was even better the next day. It will be a "repeat" for us.

Not enough liquid.  We added 12 oz. of beer and 11.5 oz. of tomato juice.  Next time will cut back on the beer or maybe use some red wine instead.  The flavor turned out wonderful, but am wondering why there is such a little amount of liquid.  I thought there might not be enough chili powder, but the spices were just right.  Made it a second time--not so good.  Not making again.  The best chili on this site is Boilermaker's, but has so many ingredients we refrain from making it very often--great for Super Bowl.
