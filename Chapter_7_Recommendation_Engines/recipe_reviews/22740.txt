This bread turned out to be quite good and VERY quick and easy. It's especially good served hot with butter. It's fairly dense with a nice crisp crust similar to a plain Irish soda bread (no currants etc). I'll definitely be making it again.

My husband is native and loves his "Buffalo Chip" bread. I tested the recipe with shortening sub instead of butter powder milk sub and original. All three were great! My family loved them. Super easy quick and tasty bread with beans or a hearty stew. Definately will recommend and stored in the recipe box.

Wow! It's great to see a recipe for this! This is wonderful bread to accompany just about any meal. It is best fresh from the oven with fresh raspberry or chokecherry jelly. We slice it into half inch slices and it makes delicious toast also. My aunt lives in the Turtle Mtns and when she makes gallette she just keeps putting ingredients together until it looks and feels right-it's great to see exact amounts for those of us who are not master gallette makers like her!

I have made this recipe multiple times now. I love it for the simplicity and ease of preparation and the crunchy crust. I have tried it with all white and all whole wheat flour and it has turned out great each time. It is a hearty dense bread. Quite good.

I remember my father used to make this when I was a child. I looked forward to eating it as we didn't have much to eat in the house. He used to tell me his grandmother used to make it. I never relized it was something from our Native background. Thank you for sharing.

Best bannok I have made yet. Only change was to use whole wheat flour. Made a nice size round loaf... Wonderful!

I made this with whole wheat flour and cut the recipe in half. With that in mind the baking time was decreased; my bread only took about 20 minutes! Great taste!

I couldn't locate my family recipe for galette and searched on Allrecipes and there it was! Turns out great. I made a couple modifications: crisco instead of butter & 3/4 cup milk 3/4 cup water. Just like grandma use to make! Best to not over work the dough.

I feel bad in a way rating this so low but I really disliked the bread as it came out as I made it. I wanted to like it-such a simple and useful recipe. I did use whole wheat flour but so do other reviewers and my bread came out looking exactly as the main photo does. I see that most people really liked it so I am open to possibly doing something wrong but I don't think I did. I understood this was going to be a dense bread but to me the bread tasted like dough or flour not bread. The texture was clay-like but perhaps it is supposed to be. I knew it would be different than sour-dough or yeast raised bread and was surprised I did not like the flavor as well as the texture. I tend to like a wide variety of things and am open to it. Many reviewers seem to have experience with this bread including from childhood and the good associations with remembering eating it. I can't say whether or not the "spice" of nostalgia has helped their result taste better than mine. The only other baking soda-leavened bread I've eaten before is Irish Soda bread and I've only had it a few times. I give it two stars not one in case it was something I did. There's not a big loss if you try the recipe anyway-most people have the ingredients always around. Who knows maybe you will like it?

Made this because we are running out of food and it will fill my kids up. I doubled the recipe ran out of all purpose flour and put in a cup of self-rising flour. I adjusted the baking powder and salt. Added cinnamon nutmeg sugar and vanilla. Added butter on top and my babies really enjoyed it.

I love this recipe but I did use 4 tbsp of melted butter and a little bit more milk it was kinda dry. I also kneaded it a few minutes. It turned out great. Will use this recipe from now on. I also rubbed butter on the top after taking out of oven.
