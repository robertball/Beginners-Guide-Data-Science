When I was living in Korea there was a restaurant that served what we called, "Chilli Chicken." This is almost that exact chicken! I loved this dish so much that I was considering flying back there on vacation just to have it again. I also added come red pepper flakes to the recipe. We love spicy food! Thank you!

I was in a bit of a rush and couldn't find gochujang at my local store. So I opted for a Thai Sweet Chili Sauce and hoped for the best. It was more sweet than it was spicy, but both my husband and I loved it! I really want to try the Korean hot pepper paste next time. Either way, I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the great recipe!

Was a little aprehensive when I read this recipe as I don't normally like spicy foods. I have to say it wasn't really that spicy. It has a lot less punch than your standard buffulo wings. It is sweet to start and then a hint of "heat" afterward. I loved it and so did everyone else thats tried it. I would give it 5.5* P.S. had trouble finding hot pepper paste. Had to go to asian market.

Very good dish. I used a sweet chili sauce in place of the sugar and then a little hot sauce. Flavors were nicely balanced. Served it over brown basmati rice.

Very nice light taste. Also very easy to cook. I've already made this twice this past week. Like everyone else I did some subsitutions. The first time I made it w/o onions, it didn't make a big impact on taste. Like the rest I was unable to find Gochujang paste and went with Thai sweet chili. Since the chili is already sweet, I also omitted the suger and lemon peper. I made it using Golden Delicious Apples  which i found to be perfect for the taste. I put too much peper and wine in the first try and it was very sauce and peper heavy. The second time I lightened up on the wine and the blance was perfect. I perfer to cut the chicken into larger chunks. The second time i did them too small and it began to shred into pieces as i cooked it. I used a simple white Chardoney, tastes good!

This was very delicious. I couldn't find the hot pepper paste so I used red pepper flakes and red chile paste, but otherwise I made as exactly written. I loved it and would recommend this to anyone!

My husband is Korean, and we both typically find chicken to be very bland. This meal was delicious and very easy. We served it with white rice and kimchee. I diced the apple, onion, and celery, I liked it that way vs. big chunks. I'd definitely recommend this. It had just the right amount of 'kick'.

Very easy and tasty!  I used 2 tablespoons of Siracha (sp?) chili sauce because I didn't have the one listed here.  It was very delicious.

I made this last week and again this week and it was so easy and delicious. I also couldn't find the spicy sauce so I tried the Thai Sweet Chili Sauce and it was really good. The serving size for two people was way too small for my boyfriend and I so I doubled it when I made it again. I was trying to find something good to go along with it and settled on cream cheese rangoons and it went really well. The meal is very light and crisp and I will definitely keep making it.

this was a great recipe.  i'm only giving it 4 because i want to give room one day for a 5.  you need to use the korean chili paste though.  that is critical to get the right flavour.  i also used a whole chicken and a jalepeno pepper.  i didn't remove all the skin from the chicken but left some on.  i also put a little sour cream in and a touch more white wine and a touch of lemon.  mostly because this dish needs to taste fresh but solid.  thanks for the great recipe.  and make sure you get the correct chili pase.  i got mine from ujimaya.

We really loved this recipe and will have this again and again. I must admit that I did not have the Korean pepper paste but I think the chile paste is a close match. NO lemon pepper either, but I put in a little grated lemon peel instead. Doubled the recipe for four, and served with lemon fried rice from this sight--great match. Thanks for sharing this one.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE. Only comment I can make is that it needs more sauce in order for the delicious flavor to absorb into the noodles we put this amazing dish over. ·^.^·

My family loved this, however I substituted chili sauce for the hot chili sauce and doubled it for a spicier flavor. Yummy!

We made this according to the recipe and found it a little bland.  The veggies and apple seem to soak up more of the gochujang than the chicken.  We want to try this again but next time I am going to add more gochujang and marinate the chicken in the wine, gochujang, peppers and garlic beforehand.

This dish is quite tasty. I'm half Korean so we always have gochujang on hand. My husband wasn't too keen on the apples' consistency of being partially mushy, but overall, the dish was a hit. I served this with some rice and a Korean cucumber salad. The sweetness of the cucumber salad went very well with this dish. Will definitely make it again! Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good.  Next time I will add more apples (maybe use a whole one) and cut the apple pieces larger (I think I diced instead of leaving them in chunks).  Definitely find the gochujang sauce!

We really liked this recipe.  I used Thai chili sauce in place of the gochujang and I used half the amount called for.  Thanks for the recipe.

Looking for something different to do with chicken, I came across this faceless (since Dec. ’09) recipe.  Although my family liked it, we all thought it was lacking something.  I served it over white rice and that didn’t seem to add anything to the dish.  The vegetables were cooked with a nice crispness still there and the chicken had good flavor, but the overall opinion was that it was good, but too many other recipes out there to make this one again.
