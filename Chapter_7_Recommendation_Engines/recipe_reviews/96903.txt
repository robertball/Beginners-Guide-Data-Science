I didn't have any brandy, so I substituded for more rum & it was delish.  Also, used pinot grigio for a less sweet flavor since the fruit and sprite made it sweet enough :)

Great Sangria and pretty too.  I put some of the fruit on toothpicks for a garnish.

I made this for a BBQ. Everyone loved it. The only changes I made was I used pineapple flavored rum and skipped the brandy. Will definitely make again!

I thought this was good, although I did alter it to use ingredients I had on hand. I used a red zinfandel and used diet soda.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
