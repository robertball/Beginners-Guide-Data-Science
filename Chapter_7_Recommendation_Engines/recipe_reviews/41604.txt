Truely italian. Similar to my 85 yr old grandfathers.I prefer a dark red wine, and I well-browned the meat prior to simmering.  A delicious recipe.

I used 1 lb hot and 1 lb sweet sausage instead of the pork. The hot sausage gave this sauce the extra kick it was missing. My friends always ask me to make it for Soprano's Sunday.

Wonderful! I opted to cut the pork in 1 inch cubes, which lessened the cooking time to about 2 hours. The pork is so tender.... melts in your mouth. At first I thought the amount of dried herbs to be excessive but it all mellows out in the end. The final product is a hearty, yet light tasting sauce. I served it farfale pasta. Simple recipe, simple ingredients - can't get any better than this!

This recipe is great as written.  I always have to make some adjustments because of preference.  I browned 1 lb of hot italian sausage and added to the pork shoulder and some diced up pancetta.  I did not brown the pancetta just added it to the meats.  Instead of white wine, which is fine, I used two cups of red wine.  Let is simmer all day long.  Freezes well and gets better with age!

While this recipe is an interesting twist on traditional spaghetti, it leaves something to be desired. I followed the recipe exactly (except for using a sugar substitute), but there just wasn't enough umph. I believe more garlic and maybe a little heat would benefit this sauce. On the bright side, the pork is incredibly tender in about 3 1/2 hours. I served it on bowties with garlic bread, but I think it would go well with rice after the spice additions. Also, this recipe makes A LOT!!! I froze two large bags of it. This would be easy in a crock pot, too.

This was a delicious recipe. Only changes I made was to first brown the roast on all sides and set aside. Then I sauteed the onions and garlic. Also I used about 1 cup of red wine instead of the white. The smells will drive you crazy during the 4-5 hours.

This was a good base recipe.  I used ground pork instead of the shoulder. I brown the ground pork first before adding to the ingredients.  I also added to the sauce some meatballs, hot italian sausage, and chicken thighs for extra flavour and removed them from the sauce for a meal.  I used the sauce on spaghetti and homemade gnocci .  Also I used about 3 cups of white wine in this dish - it helped give it more flavour, as it was a bit bland at first. I would suggest only using 2 cups if you don't add the meatballs, sausage, and chicken.  I will make this again.

Amazingly flavorful!  Makes a great deal of gravy that freezes well.  Be careful with the salt.

Originally, my changes were to use cubed meat (half pork, half beef), crushed tomatoes, beef stock instead of water.  But while the meat was very tender after simmering for 4 hours, the sauce had no flavor.  I added another 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, 2 small cans of tomato paste and another 2 Tbs garlic and simmered for another half hour.  Better, but I still refrigerated overnight to hopefully allow some flavors to develop.  Thanks for the recipe and the ideas, but I'll stick with our favorite:  the Sicilian Succo from this site--it's a better fit for our tastes.

FANTASTIC!  I read many Italian gravy recipes and kinda combined what I thought would make not only great pork, but a great sauce at the same time.  Pork shoulder is the best.  Sometimes I find it at my local market, sometimes I don't, so a good pork roast has worked well for me as well.  I do make my own tomato puree. I use 6 large tomatoes and boil them and peel them, then blend them with the sugar.  I add 2 cans of tomato paste when I add the puree.  I also add like 4000% more garlic (hehe). I like to carmalize the onions with full bulb of garlic.  Other than that, I follow this recipe as is and it makes wonderful sauce for any pasta and especially for Lasagne.  I like it so much, it has been hand written in my personal cook book journal. Enjoy.

YES! This is almost exactly like the gravy we make for Christmas dinner to go over the ravioli we make. We use beef though, instead of pork. It tastes delicious and it's so good to see someone else who calls it "gravy", not "sauce"!

Not my most favorite meat sauce. Tasted a bit sour and I was expecting more for the amount of time I had to wait for it to cook...

First time made it as written--exception used dry red wine. Turned out great! Have made it since with modifications--personal preference.  Used fressh herbs (tripled amount and added some basil)also added 28oz Italian plum peeled tomatoes-chopped.  Made it a bit more chunky.  Also, added 1 small can tomato paste.

Very good. I would definitely cube my pork next time, as it took a really long time to break down into manageable pieces. Also, you'll probably want to cook this uncovered for about half of the time to let the sauce reduce - it's quite watery if kept covered the entire time. Still, we enjoyed it with these changes, so I would likely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

I used italian pork sausage/beef mixture in my gravy along with red wine. (didn't have the roast handy) FANTASTIC!! I don't know why some reviews said it had no flavor(season to taste, its a no brainer)?!?! This gravy was amazing, and will be my go-to sauce recipe from now on. Thanks for posting!! :)

Blah. I dont know if I did something wrong, but the pork did not fall apart into the sauce as I had imagined it would. I like more consistency to my sauce. This would be good over tortolini's or in lasagne.

This recipe is very close to my former SIL who is Scilian. So very very good! I did buy pork shoulder steaks and trimmed some of the fat. I also browned it before adding to the pot. She used to get the sauce going for an hour or so and then refrigerate overnight and simmer all day the next day. This is WONDERFUl stuff! Thanks for the recipe.

I agree it lack flavor!  I adjusted.  Used variety of meats.  Italian sausage, beef neck bone and during the last hour, dropped in some meatballs.   I used a large fresh chopped onion, started with 6 chopped garlic cloves and 2 tblsp of each:  dried, oregano, basil, parsley.  Added the water and wine.  Simmered for 3 hours, stirring every half hour. Make sure, as it reduces, to scape the thick sauce from the sides.  No sugar, no tomato paste.  If you cook it long enough, it sweetens the sauce and intensifies the flavors. As you stir, taste the sauce. If it need most spices add as you go along with salt and pepper.  After three hours, I dropped raw meatballs in gently.  Don’t stir for half hour until

I am making this as I type.  It looks like there is way too much liquid (recipe calls for 9 cups of water, total)  I started with 6 cups, and am getting worried.  This has about 3 more hours of simmering to go.....  Did I misread something?

This is a keeper!!!!! I stayed very close to this recipe with only a few exceptions; double the wine to a full cup and reduce the water by a 1/2 cup in then first part, I pureed in the blender 2-14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes and 2-14.5 cans whole peeled tomatoes instead of canned puree, just my choice. Since I made mine in the slow cooker I let it cook at consistent temp of med/high, ( checking to make sure it wasn't popping or boiling hard ) and DID NOT add the additional 6 cups of water in the second part since it retained all the water it needed. In the last hour I tilted the lid to release the steam significantly ( you could even take it off if your slow cooker/crockpot is deep enough) so it would cook down to more of a sauce/gravy like consistency. I substituted boneless pork spare ribs as well. It was delicious!
