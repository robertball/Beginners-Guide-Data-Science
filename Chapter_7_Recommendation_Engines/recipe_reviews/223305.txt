I believe there is a typo on this recipe. Too bad because it is really very good. I believe that the baking powder should be 2 tsp not 2 Tablespoons. I made this using 2 teaspoons of baking powder and it is a 5 star recipe. As written with 2 Tablespoons baking powder it is doomed to failure. Hopefully the submitter bakerchic12321 will see this and notify AllRecipes so they can correct it. Thanks so much bakerchic12321.

I think there is too much baking powder in this recipe--gives it a funny taste. Would 2 teaspoons be the correct amount?

Fantastic! First, make sure you adjust the baking powder to two teaspoons. I didn't have enough peaches, so I ended up using three cups of peaches, one cup fresh blackberries, and one cup sliced black plums. To make up for the tartness of the plums I increased the sugar for the fruit mixture to 1/3 cup, and also added a dash of nutmeg along with the cinnamon. It's perfect.

My Grandmother and the rest of the family make this all the time using different fruit variations. The baking powder is either 2tbs or 2 tsp depending on where you live. In Kansas they use 2tsp but here in AK where I live that isn't enough, the batter won't rise so I added more up to 2tbs and that ended up being perfect and no funny taste. So on that aspect you adjust as needed. Made with fresh blackberries and a can of peaches over the wk end and used the juice from the peaches in the batter. It was delicious and gone quick, 3 college kids devoured it with vanilla ice cream.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 2 teaspoons instead of tablespoons for the baking powder. I misread how much sugar to put in the dough, ended up not adding any and only put in 1/2 cup sugar with the cinnamon and lemon juice. I didn't notice this till I made the recipe a second time! Everyone who ate my unintentionally "reduced sugar" edition loved it, so I made it the same way and was just as happy with it

I reversed the amount of peaches and berries. My sister is gluten free so I made the batter with gluten free flour. I also used frozen fruit thawed out making sure to drain much of the natural juices that occur. I will use it later for something else, maybe a barbecue sauce. Will be trying it later today with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Picked my own blackberries in Anacortes, WA with my grandson and used locally grown peaches.  Made this cobbler for my family, perfect results and everyone was trying to get the last bite.  Keeper recipe.

I made this for a Labor Day bbq. It was a hit with adults and kids. I served it a la mode, with Tillamook French Vanilla ice cream. It turned out soft inside, with a golden crust and the fruit was delicious. I will make this one of my go to desserts for summer bbqs.

It was yummy.  I doubled the blackberries and only used a 1/3 cup sugar in the batter.  The fruit taste really came through.  Not too sweet and not too tart.  It was perfect topped with vanilla ice cream.

Scrumptious! Made this with fresh peaches and blackberries and followed the recommendations on the baking powder typo. Used half brown sugar and half white sugar in the dough but that was only change.  Will definitely make again soon!

This recipe did not have enough of the cake for this amount of fruit.  It also does not require a whopping 2 tablespoons of baking powder.  No one in our family enjoyed it so it got tossed. 
Waste of wonderful fresh fruit.

Great! Delicious and not too hard. There was a TYPO in the recipe however, and thankfully I read the reviews before making it which made me realize the recipe maker must have meant 2 TEASPOONS NOT TABLESPOONS. I made it with fresh peaches and Blackberries and it was scrumptious.

TYPO - Please note that it is 2 teaspoons of baking powder and not tablespoons.  If you make it with that correction it is a five star recipe.  It is so easy to put together and everyone loved it.  I used frozen fruit which I had defrosted but still ended up increasing the baking time to get the golden crust I was looking for.

I really liked this recipe. Unfortunately, I had to replace peaches and blackberries with apples and blueberries (grocery store had NO peaches for some reason). I also couldn't find baking powder. The taste is delicious!! Although, I do think the recipe calls for too much butter. A lot of the butter was floating around at the top, so next time, I'm going to use less butter. But I definitely recommend this recipe. It's super simple, easy, and delicious!

The recipe was excellent.  I did follow others' tips and used three tsp instead of 3 tbsp of baking powder.  Did not last long however, the fruit became soggy but fresh out of the oven with ice cream was delicious!

I don't like blackberries so I made it with blueberries. It was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again. Also followed others' advice regarding the baking powder and only used two teaspoons.

Loved it. Will add another cup of peaches next time but loved the blackberry combo. Easy to make too.

Tastes great! The only change I made was leaving out the lemon juice simply because I didn't have any on hand.  Will definitely make this again.

Best cobbler recipe!  I use blueberries with the peaches.   Once you combine,  you will never have to choose between the two again!
