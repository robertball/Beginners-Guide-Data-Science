This is really great.  We will use slightly less mustard next time, though.  We found that it was better the second time around, so, after cooking it, let it sit for awhile and then reheat.  This thickens it and makes the flavors mix better.  We had it with pitas and raw veggies.  We liked it best with carrots.  We will definitely make this again!

This dip is more or less like a baked potatoe topping. It's not for using tortilla chips.

I made this as a cheese sauce for fresh steamed broccoli and it was fabulous!  The whole family loved it, including our little ones!  Thanks!  We will be having this again!

Great recipe! This was enjoyed by all at my daughter's birthday party, and has been at other occasions in the past. I used turkey bacon in case that makes a difference to anyone, and baked my bacon in the oven instead of pan frying it to save myself a bit of mess. After making it I popped it in the fridge overnight to reheat it for the party. But it reheats really well, and tasted fabulous with the bread we served it with. I will most definitely be making this again!

This was great! I only rated 4 instead of 5 because I think the reciepe should call for the broccoli to be diced into small piece, it ended up being more like broccoli with melted cheese ontop. So next time to make it more "dip like" Ill probably use a food processor for the bacon and broccoli or something of that sort. But the taste of this recipe was WONDERFUL!! I dont have any left overs! Also this goes great in a bread bowl

I am vegetarian so I skipped the bacon, used miracle whip instead of mayonnaise, black pepper instead of white pepper, and reduced the yellow mustard as per previous suggestions.  It is really thin so I agree with the suggestion to let cool and reheat then the consistency is perfect.  If you used less cheese it would be more like a side dish, I think next time I will cut up the broccoli into smaller pieces to make it easier for dipping.  All in all it is decent, though I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up on this recipe.  I'll have to experiment more next time.

Simple and tasty.  A big hit wherever I have brought it, and never bring any home.

Really good! I agree with the previous comment, which said that the tablespoon of mustard might have been a bit much. Even with that though, it is still awesome

This recipe was just okay. Nothing fantastic. Following other reviewers' advice, I used less mustard, only 1 Tbls, and used chopped broccoli that I cut up even smaller. I also made it ahead of time and reheated it as one mentioned, but that just made it separate and become grainy. My mom enjoyed it leftover as a topping for baked potatoes, at least.
