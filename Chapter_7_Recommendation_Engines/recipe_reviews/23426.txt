I followed the advice of other users and changed the recipe in the following ways: I only used 1/2 cup sugar, I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, I used one whole egg instead of 2 whites (I only had one egg), I used 3 bananas instead of two and 1/3 cup applesauce, added 1tsp vanilla extract and 1tsp almond extract, and 1/4 tsp. salt.  I also added 1/4 cup chopped nuts.  It tastes great, and I didnt get a rubbery crust at all, as some people did.  It's easy enough that I'll definitely be making it for my next school bake sale, which I don't often do, since I usually have way too much homework :)

i also wanted to give it 4.5 stars.  it's a good recipe to start with but after reading countless reviews on things that should be added, i decided to heed their warning.  
i mixed the dry ingredients in a separate bowl than the 'wet'(apple sauce, bananas, sugar, egg whites) ingredients.  and i added 1/2 tsp. salt to the dry mixture and 1 tsp vanilla to the wet mixture.  then i mixed the dry ingredients into the wet gradually till moistened, followed by walnuts(they complement the banana flavor so well!).  another nice touch is to top the batter in the pan with a mix of brown sugar and a little water. it gives the crust a sweet crunch.
anyway, it smelled so good while it was baking that my roommates couldn't even wait till the bread cooled before they scarfed it down.
hope this helped.  sorry it was so long.

This is great. I couldnt find my banana bread recipe so i tried this one.  It will be the recipe i use for now on!  My guess is that the people who have chewy or heavy bread are stirring too much, and the people with not enough flavor are using bananas that are not ripe enough. The nastier they look the better they are for bread!

I was looking for a great low fat banana bread. This is it, but I did tweak the recipe a bit. I added nutmeg instead of cinnamon and also vanilla as others had suggested. I also added 1/2 tsp salt, which I believe is the "missing" ingredient some reviewers were talking about. With these changes the bread was FAB!!!

Almost passed this one by due to the fat free nature...but am I glad I didn't!  Had to rub it in dh's face when he said he loved it!  Used 3 ripe bananas, added choco chips and nuts for fun, 1/2 nutmeg and upped the cinnamon due to some reviews saying it was bland, and cut the sugar.  To sell my husband on a healthy recipe is something!  Made it as muffins, 350 for 18 min.  Perfect.  Thanks.  TStephensx7

This turned out great!  Very moist.  As someone else suggested I added 1/8 teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of vanilla.  I think those are the missing ingredients.  Probably over strirring is why some are having it turn out rubbery.  Great lowfat alternative!

I'd like to give this one 4 1/2 stars. As an earlier reviewer wrote, it was a bit "rubbery" but that didn't take away from the fact that it was delicious! I modified it slightly: replaced 1/4 c. of flour with 1/3 c. oatmeal, added about 3/4 c. raisins and 1 tsp. of vanilla. The aroma while it was baking made my mouth water! And to think I picked this one because it was listed first!

I have made this twice now and it came out absolutely perfectly both times!  I love that I can count on that!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 3 large overly ripe bananas, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg, 1 whole egg in place of the egg whites, and used 1/3 cup unsweetened organic applesauce.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup the first time, but both my husband and I thought it was a little under-sweet, so I used 3/4 cup the second time and it was perfect and not too sweet either.  I mixed the wet ingredients and dry ingredients in two separate bowls and then added the wet ingredients to the dry.  I used an electric hand mixer on the lowest setting and mixed until JUST combined.  Sometimes if you over-mix a batter, it can become dense and rubbery.  The second it's incorporated together, stop mixing.  I baked it in a greased 9x5 loaf pan for exactly 50 minutes (I have a gas oven and it may make a difference as far as the cooking time) and it was perfectly done.  Soft and moist and delicious - and made the house smell so good while baking!

this is absolutely gross....i don't know if it's cuz something went wrong in MY baking..but i've made banana bread before!
the bread was really tough, kinda has a really heavy muffin-like texture, that tastes BAD!  i think the applesauce made it really BAD, it gave it a weird kick...probably exacerbating the texture....GROSS! bad bad bad, don't make this!

Not moist at all and it seems to be missing something. I think next time I will add more applesauce and banana and maybe a little vanilla.

Great recipe with a few changes. You must add half a tsp of.salt or the bread will lack flavor. Mix wet and dry ingredients separately then fold the wet into dry. Don't use a hand mixer for that part or your bread will be rubbery. I use 3 bananas and add a tsp of vanilla. Adding a tbsp of brown sugar (sprinkled) on the top makes a deliciously crunchy top crust. Thanks to the reviewer who left that tip.

This recipe is dangerously delicious!  I followed the advice of other users and changed the recipe in the following ways: 3/4 c whole wheat flour, 3/4c white flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 whole egg,  3 bananas, 1/3 cup apple butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp almond extract, and 1/4 tsp. salt. I also added 1/4 cup chopped pecans. It was totally awesome!

This is such a great low fat recipe!  I made a double batch (I had a lot of bananas to use up!) and it came out great.  Even though the recipe is already low fat I did make a couple changes...whole wheat flour instead of white, Splenda instead of white sugar and "no sugar added" applesauce instead of regular.  I also added a dash of vanilla, salt and nutmeg.  The recipe came out great and I had a lot of requests for a copy of the recipe.  Enjoy!

Great recipe, the second time I did it turned out much better. First I beat eggwhites with sugar until frothy and folded them after beating the rest of the ingridients.
To decorate use rolled oats; just sprinkle on top of the bread before baking.

this bread is really good! I added the salt and vanilla as suggested by other reviewers. It is a little dense, but very moist. I also topped it with a mixture of flour, brown sugar and 1/2 tablespoon butter (yes, it adds a little fat) but it really is worth it!  Will definitely make again.

This turned out great-I did double the amount of bananas and also I added vanilla and cinamon applesauce. It was actually better once it was cooled and sliced the following day.

for the amount of fat, this is wonderful!  be sure not to stir too much or it will be "rubbery."  like someone else stated, the more rotten the banana, the better!

Made this just recently for a second time. Again, I used brown sugar instead of white, added walnuts and this time used 3 bananas. However I was out of applesauce and substituted 1/4c. of melted I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light. And this time it didn't come out chewy at all. Adds 200 calories and 24g. of fat to the loaf but considering how many slices you get out of the loaf, it's not too bad. Maybe next time I'll try 1/8c. of applesauce and 1/8c. ICBINB Light. Still a delicious recipe!!!

I loved this bread, and have started making it all the time!  I actually preferred it to the sometimes greasy texture of full-fat varieties.  I added a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips to curb my sweet tooth, but the recipe worked great as submitted. Five stars all around!

Fabulous.  This recipe is moist and light in texture.  I didn't have any applesauce so I used melted I Can't Believe It's No Butter like a previous review mentioned and it worked just fine.  Of course, I added about 1/2 cup of walnuts though.  I feel thin already.

I had no applesauce so I halved the amount of sugar, and added honey and jam instead to make up the moisture. Turned out okay, although it's missing an edge, eventhough I added salt like other users suggested. It was still nice, and the fact that it has no fat is a big plus. =)

Good, but it was a very chewy and compact loaf.  It is a nice non-fat alternative to regular banana bread though.

I've made this twice - my honey and I love it.  I add walnuts which adds fat, of course, but I don't care.  I like the fact that it is a lite version.  This will be my regular recipe.

Really good! I added some walnuts, vanilla and chocolate pieces. My whole family loved this recipe and I will definitely make it again.
*note: I made it over and over, and then tried it with Splenda. I don't know if that was what went wrong or if it was something else, but it didn't rise - so was flat and dense, and was a terrible texture.

I have never made banana bread before, although I have tasted many.  This bread came out tasty tasty tasty!  I doubled the ammount of bananas taking the suggestion from others.  Definitely a great no fat version.

This bread is AWESOME!!  I can't believe it is FAT FREE!!  My kids ate all but the one piece I got to eat.  Now I'm waiting for my bananas to go brown so that I can make more.  This time I will make at least two loaves so that I am somewhat guaranteed to get more than one piece.

The recipe was great , especially for my daughter who is constantly watching her fat intake! I made it as muffins tho (12 muffins) and baked at 350 for 15-20 mins. I also think that next time i might look for the sugar-free applesauce, as it was almost a little TOO sweet.

HONESTLY, I wasn't sure what to expect given the wide range in reviews.  I'm a bit of an expert when it comes to banana bread (at least in regard to how it SHOULD taste) and make a loaf almost weekly.  My significant other remains very health-conscious and although I've been making the substitution of Splenda blend/whole wheat flour for sugar/white flour, the amount of butter that goes into a normal recipe is a little disturbing.  

So ... I was very excited to try this recipe.  At first I wanted to try it out as it was, but given my past experience, added vanilla & a pinch of salt to the recipe, used Splenda blend & whole wheat flour & added 4 mediumish bananas (probably more than a cup's worth).  At the last minute, I added maybe 1/4th cup of semisweet chocolate chips.  It smelled wonderful, made a hefty, gorgeous looking loaf, but when I did try the non-chocolate infused bits, it was a little "moist" (maybe too much so for some people's tastes - it was fine to me).  I thought it was lacking in flavor (I find it odd how some people say it's "too sweet" while others say "not sweet enough"), but this was expected for something without any fat. :)

Overall, my recommendations are:
1) Add an extra banana.  MAKE SURE THEY ARE OVERLY RIPE, i.e. blackening!!! If they are normal-looking, you won't get a good banana flavor regardless of your recipe.

2) Add vanilla.  Any true banana bread recipe has vanilla.

3) If you want a bit more flavor, try more cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.

made all the changes suggested by others here...3/4 cup wheat + 3/4 cup white flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 3 bananas, 1/2 applesauce, 1 egg, 1/2 skim milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/3 cup walnuts.  Came out very moist and delicious.  Great recipe! thanks.

wow! i must say, i'm pretty impressed with this recipe.  i wasn't really expecting much because i've made a couple low-fat/no fat banana breads before and none of them turned out very well.. like they were EDIBLE.. but not really banana bread. after reading some reviews, i decreased sugar (and in my case, i used splenda) to 1/2 cup, increased the applesauce to 1/2 cup, used 3 medium bananas, added a tsp of vanilla, 1/8 tsp of nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp salt, and used 3/4 cup white flour and 3/4 cup wheat flour, and also mixed the dry ingredients and wet ingredients seperately and mixed them together last.  seems like a bit of changes, but i still give the recipe 5 stars just because you can hardly (at least for me) tell that it .. has virtually no fat. oh, i used 1/4 cup egg substitute instead too. :P anyway... make this bread! pretty good stuff.

I have made this multiple times and it is now one of my favorites. For a little boost I add 1 tsp of vanilla or 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract, plus chopped almonds.  The applesauce trick to hold the moisture works wonderfully and I send some to work with my fiance often and his entire office gobbles it up. THANK YOU for the great recipe.

I Love this Banana Bread!!! I can't keep it in the house, my husband eats a whole loaf by him self. And since I am trying to lose weight it is nice that it is low-fat. It is very moist and flavor full. I do add vanilla to it though, helps to bring out the flavor a little more. i have given this recipe to family & friends. I highly recomend you try it. It is so easy, and good.

This was an excellent bread for having virtually no fat! My entire family enjoyed it very much. We did add a small amount of butter before eating, which added some fat...but still far less fat than most banana breads.

It is an excellent banana bread.  I've made this recipe in the past exactly as is but I must
admit that I wanted to make it differently this time.  This is what I changed:
instead of egg whites - whole eggs
instead of applesauce - used canola oil
It was so delicious!

This was very good, quick, and easy.  While the recipe did not specify that "old" banannas should be used, I did use blackened ones to produce better flavor.  I took a loaf to the family across the street and the kids ate all of it before mom had a chance to try it.  I'd say it's pretty kid friendly based on that! :)

Fabulous!  
I tweaked it a bit as well and it was fantastic.  As another user did, I decreased sugar to 1/2 cup, increased apple sauce to 1/3 cup, and added a dash of salt and nutmeg.  This will be my new go to banana bread recipe from now on.

I would've given it a full 5 stars, but I did make some minor adjustments. I used whole-wheat flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce, added a teaspoon vanilla and threw in some chocolate chips. This is a great basic recipe that is easily tailored to suit your individual tastes. Not over-mixing the batter with these kinds of breads is important. So I mix the wet ingredients and sugar together, and mix the dry ingredients together in a separate bowl. Then I combine the two and mix until just moistened. I then fold in the bananas and chocolate chips. The consistency was great.

I used 1/2 cup sugar, 3 bananas, 1/2 cup banana-vanilla low-fat yogurt (Stonyfield brand) for the applesauce, and added 1/2 teas vanilla and it was AMAZING!!! So moist and tasty. Especially with Brummel&Brown on it!

Great banana bread...I used 1 1/2 cups of banana and it was very moist and flavorful.  Definately add some salt (1/4 tsp) and vanilla (1tsp)...it makes a difference.

This is one of the better low-fat banana breads I have made.  I use 1/4 c of light brown sugar and 2/4 c splenda to further lighten it up.  I have also used 1 c mashed fresh peaches instead of bananas and it was so good, and my picky peach loving diabetic father was so pleased!!  Bravo!!

This recipe will replace all my other Banana Bread recipes. It is easy to make, the bread is moist and no one will ever know that you used applesauce instead of oil! My husband actually said he liked the taste of this bread better than the regular (fat) version.

My kids love this banana bread with a twist to the original recipe: use 2 eggs (not only the white), wholewheat flour (instead of white flour), 3 bananas, 1/2 cups Apple sauce and two big spoons of honey instead of sugar, i.e., no refined flour or sugar. Also added 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and doubled the cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers.

Used this recipe to make banana bread for the first time. I will admit it is on the sweeter side with all that sugar. I will taking advice from previous posts to lower the sugar. I also added an extra banana and also added whole ground flax seed. Flax seed is really good for you and it can be put in any kind of bread, pancakes....etc. other than the sweetness it is really good for my time. The kids and husband love it and that is what counts??

Wonderful!  I used all whole wheat flour, replaced sugar with Splenda, I added extra bananas, a bit more applesauce, and about 1 TBSP of oil, for texture.  Tastes just as good as the full fat version!  Will definitely be making this again!

3 stars BECAUSE you should make these changes, and then ..Love it!! I see no need to make a banana bread any other way. -Following other reviewers' advice, I made these changes first: Mixed the dry and wet ingredients separate first, I substituted most of the cinnamon for nutmeg, added 1/4 tsp or so of salt, 3/4 tsp vanilla extract, almost TWICE the applesauce, 3 bananas (not 2), 1 whole egg instead of the 2 whites, (added walnuts), and tried not to over stir it when combining the 2 separate bowls! ...finished with warm water with brown sugar on top. Oh and I used splenda cause I'm dieting, and my dad's diabetic whom I also made some for. The added touches made it perfect, (moist and delish!) (Oh my pan was wider too, so it only took 20-25 min to make!) Thankyou everyone for the advice, and thankyou, Allison for posting this great recipe! ...Making another batch now (lots of old bananas in the freezer to use up!) And I'm adding peanut butter chips and chocolate chips (no walnuts). yum.

Great recipe. A bit dry on my first go-around with it; the crust was quite tough and the inside was a  bit plain. However, on my second try I added extra applesauce, a cup of milk, a cup of walnuts, and three bananas. It turned out perfect. Tip: use the very ripest of bananas. They add extra flavour and allows one to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup vs. 3/4 cup.

This was very good considering it was so low fat.  One thing I did, which I always do with banana bread, was to wrap it in foil and leave it overnight.  Banana bread always tastes better to me after doing this.

I liked this recipe. I actually used 2 whole eggs (not just the whites) and added a litte more applesauce and a little less sugar. Turned out very moist and yummy in the inside - nice crispy crust. I also added walnuts.

I haven't tried this recipe, but for all those who are adding chocolate chips, nuts, etc., I'm laughing because it isn't LOW FAT if you do that.  ;)   If you want a regular banana bread, use a different recipe; don't kid yourself this is still low fat after you change it.

It turned out perfect, I too made changes, I used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour,1 c unbleached all purpose flour, 1/2 c. organic cane sugar, 1/2 tsp. sea salt, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1 egg, 3 smashed banana's, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1/3 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. nuts. So it's still almost no fat - very moist with great flavor!

I made this recipe twice.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, increased the applesauce to 1/3 cup, added 1/4 t salt and a dash of nutmeg.  I sprinkled brown sugar over the top before baking.  It came out perfectly.

Very, very good bread!  I did make some of the previously mentioned additions-- less sugar, more applesauce, 3 bananas and the addition of 1/2 t of salt.  I also added golden raisins.  It turned out fantastic.  I'll add more cinnamon because that is our taste. Really great recipe, thank you!

Excellent recipe for a low fat banana bread.  I followed others suggestions and left out sugar, used 1/2 cup of splenda, 1 egg beater, 3 bananas, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla and added walnuts. The bread had good consistency and flavor.  I much prefer adding butter, sugar and eggs but we are watching our diet these days and this was a very flavorful replacement.

First of all, I almost doubled the amount of banana in this recipe (this may have changed results a bit).  I also added about a teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and a few tablespoons less sugar. The inside was moist and fluffy coming out of the oven, but the outside was very browned and tough--I'd lower the temperature and cook it slower next time.  Great banana flavour for low-fat.

This banana bread is so good i make sure there is always some around the house! I also add about one heaping teaspoon of dark brown sugar and 1/2 a tsp. of vanilla extract. I put in as many bananas as I have availible- up to three, and usually use half a cup of applesauce to make it extra moist. When cooking in a 9x5 loaf pan, only cook for 45 minuts. Since its relativly healthy, its great for breakfast. Bread is easy to make and freezes well. Perfect.

Great recipe foundation. I increased the applesauce to 1/2 cup, replaced 1/2 cup of the white flour with wheat, and added brown sugar. It is WONDERFUL.

Wonderful! I lost my old banana bread recipe so I searched up this one. I have always made applesauce breads and I love them, at this point regular banana bread seems heavy and oily to me.
 couple of things I did different: I added two heaping tablespoons cocoa powder to make it chocolate, my theory is if something is worth baking it is worth chocolate! Second, I took out the egg whites and substituted one more mashed banana. Works just as well without the egg.

This is by far my favorite Low Fat Banana Bread Recipe. I double it everytime and add caramel bits and use mini chocolate chips. It is moist...not dense and dry like other recipes I have tried. Definitely a keeper!

This is good! I lowered the sugar to half cup. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and the rest all purpose. I used 3 bananas and one of those little individual apple sauce cups, they come in a pack of 6 I think. (unsweetened). Delicious and moist! I will make it again and again. I will try it next with the full amount of sugar, just to compare, but it was good with just half cup sugar. Don't forget the walnuts, they just go so well with the bread!

I would rate between a 4-5star. Made with 1 whole egg, 1/3 c. no-sugar apple sauce, 3/4c. sugar, 1/4t. nutmeg, 1/4t. cinnamon, 1/2t. vanilla, 1/2t. almond flavoring. Next time I'd cut soda to 1/4t. & add nuts. If I'd had 3 bananas I would have used 3. Very flavorful, simple & delicious.

A little dry, but still good for a low fat alternative to the normal bread. I added some allspice and vanilla to try and jazz it up a bit.

Just took these out of the oven & they're pretty tasty, but not as cakey as expected.  I mixed dry & wet ingredients separately, and combined gently & briefly - could be the 1.5 TBsp flax seeds I threw in (as I do w most recipes).  I also cut sugar to 1/2 cup (brown only), mixed white with whole wheat flour, doubled cinnamon, and added salt & vanilla as per suggestions.  I put choc chips in some, and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans in all: lovely!  Will make again without flax, to see if this affects texture.

I added a few chopped pecans, mashed 3 “small” bananas with my immersion blender, and used Truvia Baking Blend in place of the sugar.  Baked in two 6”x3-1/2” mini loaf pans for 35 minutes.  Many recipes that I’ve tried using applesauce as a fat replacement haven’t worked, but it REALLY works in this recipe.  I’ve made many different banana bread recipes (many fat laden), and this one measures up to the best of them.  It’s easy to make, very moist and tender, full of banana flavor, and pretty healthy.  An excellent banana bread recipe that’s going into my Favorites folder.

This was an excellent banana bread! I got rave reviews from my family when I made it, though I did tweak with the recipe a little by cutting the sugar to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp salt and a tsp of vanilla extract.  When I made it the second time around I added some peanut butter chips, which was also a big hit.  I'll never use another recipe again!  As a note to others, just make sure you don't overwork the dough and you won't wind up with a rubbery texture :)

Tasted ok but did seem a little rubbery. But since it was low fat, I enjoyed it.

I've made this many times and everybody loves it. My brother, who refuses to eat low-fat most of the time, ate this entire loaf in one day. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

awesome! I love sweet treats that you can cut the oil/butter out of and not miss it. I replace 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat flour too for extra health benefits. Then I used one whole egg rather than the two whites. You can use closer to 1/3 c. applesauce, be generous with the bananas and conservative with the sugar. 3/4 c sugar makes it very sweet. 1/2 c. would still be fine. 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp vanilla would be good additions too.

I gave this 1 star b/c my daughter liked it.  The crust was hard and the bread was sticky and heavy.....  Sometimes recipes need butter!  I was really dissapointed b/c Im trying to eat healthy and this was really discouraging.

Really, really good for almost no fat!  I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat white flour.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  I didn't realize until after I put it in the oven that it had no salt in it.  Next time, I will add some.

Don't miss the fat a bit.  This banana bread is moist and full of banana flavor.   I make this all the time and consider it to be one of my favorite banana bread recipes.

Found this recipe to be easy to make and turned out well with my own tweeking. Like all the other reviews I added a 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1tsp vanilla, used 1/3 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup sugar a little extra cinnamon, swapped the all purpose flour for whole wheat flour and used chocolate chips instead of nuts because of allergies. I used 3 really ripe bananas mashed with a fork and didn't over do on the mixing. I added each wet ingredient individually into the dry saving the bananas and choco chips last. I also mixed a bit of brown sugar with water and spread it on top during baking process for a nice sweet crunch. It turned out moist and browned well. Next time I'll try some raisins or dark choc chips for healthy additions.

Delicious!! My husband even liked it (of course I didn't tell him it's HEALTHY haha) I made a few small changes due to the reviews of others-a little salt and nutmeg, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of applesauce, mixing the wet and dry ingredients separately first...turned out great!! A little "rubbery" perhaps, as others say, but it still tastes great!!

Like others I made a ton of changes: subbed splenda for sugar, eggbeaters for egg whites, whole wheat flour for white, and 4 bananas.  I also added 1/2t nutmeg, 1t vanilla, 1/4t salt and upped the applesauce to 1/3c.  It smelled delicious while baking.  I must have made too many substitutions because it was still gooey at 60 mins.  I've stuck it back in the oven but more time doesn't seem to solve the problem.  It still tastes pretty good.

wow, great recipe.. IMPORTANT, ADD THE DRY INGREDIENTS TO THE WET ONES, I THINK ADDING THE WET INGREDIENTS TO THE DRY ING. WILL GIVE YOU A RUBBERY TEXTURE. THESE WERE PRETTY DENSE, well its banana BREAD and I made them as muffins.. I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts and used a whole egg (eggs and nuts are not bad for you, saturated fat is). That makes them 2.8 grams fat for each serving. this made 12 muffins great recipe! thanks for sharing!

The only change I made was to throw in some walnuts and a small handful of mini chocolate chips. (I love chocolate in banana bread, and you only need a tiny bit to get a big boost of flavor!)I'll try this as muffins next time. Thank you for this nutritious and delicious recipe!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I made it last night and my family loved it.  I made mine into 12 muffins.  I used 3/4 c. AP Flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, I also used 1/4 c white sugar Splenda and 1/4 brown sugar Splenda.  I used 3 bananas, and added vanilla and nutmeg.  These were so yummy and very guilt free!

very yummy! not too sweet and very moist, just the way I like it. I did change it up a little though- I added vanilla and honey (because I was a little short on sugar), and used one whole egg instead of 2 egg whites (I only had one egg!) and freshly grated half an apple instead of applesauce. it turned out to be some of the best banana bread I have tried, and I make it all the time when I buy too many bananas! thanks

I have a tendency to buy bananas and forget to eat them until they're overripe, so finding this recipe was perfect. Absolutely wonderful banana bread - I substitute brown sugar for the white and add a bit extra cinnamon, and it's delicious.

This recipe is the best low fat banana bread recipe I have ever had.  It is absolutely wonderful!  It is nice and sweet.  Best of all, it is only 2 points on Weight Watchers!  I have tried many low fat banana bread recipes and this one is by far the best.  I did add the vanilla as suggested in some of the other reviews and double the cinnamon.  Great!!  Will definitely have again and again.  Thanks.

I'v made a lot of Quick Breads but have always tended to sneer at those that substituted "low or no fat" ingredients.  That was until I became a serious WeightWatcher and had to figure a way to have some "good" things and still keep the points down.  I have made this loaf 6 times now and plan to make it many more.  It is good enough and low enough in points (4 for 1/6th of the loaf) that I don't even feel that I'm missing out on the "bad" foods.

terrific banana bread.  I tend to not like the greasiness anyway, so I don't miss the oils at all.  I tinkered with the recipe a bit.  Instead of the recommended amount, I added 4oz (1/2 cup) of applesauce, 2tsp vanilla, doubled the cinnamon, and baked for half the time recommended.  It is deeeelishhh and a great snack!

5 stars for a low fat sweet bread!  

I don't miss the butter at all.  

Alternatively - I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt per previous advice.  
I used Mott's Cinnamon flavored apple sauce.

Finally - a little sweet for my taste, I'll take the sugar down to 1/2 cup next time.   

My husband loved it with ice cream!

Very good recipe.  I've added it to my recipe book!!!  Like the others mentioned, I added vanilla.  Next time I will add more bananas and NOT stir too much.

Not as good as my grandma's banana bread, but the low fat content makes up for it!

I give this recipe a 5 because it actually is a good tasting no fat banana bread.  The apples really do the job of keeping the bread moist and its so simple to make. At first I thought I was missing an ingredient when I didn't see any milk or water to be added.

My husband and I thought this recipe tasted awful.  It was very paste like and had a strong flour taste.  Wouldn't make it again.  I checked 3 times to make sure that I made it correctly because we thought it tasted so bad.  We don't recommend it.

This is the best banana bread ever! It is just lucky that it is low fat as well. I only had one egg, so instead of 2 whites I just used the whole egg - it turned out fine. I have used 1/4 cup walnuts, 1/2 tsp vanilla and doubled the cinnamon just for a change. An easy recipe to play around with.

Why the heck are people adding suggestions of adding butter? it's supposed to be low fat! Anyway I love this recipe so much! It's perfect. No changes necessary. My family loves this bread, and i make it into muffins for breakfast too! I definitely recommend it.

This is a wonderful recipe. the only things I added were one tsp of vanilla, 1/4 C of Walnuts, and an 1/8th tsp of salt. After 50 minutes I had a beautiful, moist banana loaf. Mine was not rubbery at all from crust to the middle, I even used my kitchen aid to mix it as I do with all my banana bread recipes with no problems, of course using the lowest setting just until it comes together. Thanks for this recipe and for making my  diet seem not as impossible!

I gave this 4 stars because I think with some minor adjustments it's perfect!!  It needs a bit more cinnamon and even more banana!  I used 3 smaller bananas and doubled the cinnamon.  I used 1 whole egg and added some cinnamon chips (didn't have walnuts, or I would have added those).  It was so good, my guests didn't even know it was low fat!

I used 4 very-ripe bananas, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and replaced the applesauce with fat free plain yogurt and a bit of vanilla extract. I also used 1/4 cup oatmeal, some wheat germ and 1/2 cup each of wheat and white flours. The result was extremely moist, not at all chewy (I blended wet and dry ingredients separately and then mixed by hand). Next time I'll increase the cinnamon and nutmeg and likely add some dried cranberries or fresh blueberries. Would be divine with some dark chocolate chips for a dessert bread.

I took the advice of other reviewers and tweaked the recipe a bit by using 1/2c sugar,  1/2 tsp nutmeg,  one whole egg instead of 2 whites, 3-4 bananas, and 1/3 cup applesauce.  I also threw in a dash of vanilla.  I made mine into muffins instead of a loaf of bread and they were divine!

Love this recipe. I did make a few changes such as: 1/2 cup sugar, vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 cup chopped strawberries, 1/4 cup of lowfat plain yogurt instead of applesauce, 1/2 tsp salt & 1 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. It may be a bit too sweet for me but I think recipe was amazing for my first banana bread.

I substitute whole wheat flour and increase unsweetened applesauce. Egg beaters instead of whites and I add allspice for some zip. Dark brown sugar instead of white sugar and for some xtra flavor I top with chopped nuts mixed with some brown sugar and cinnamon. No one will beleive me that this bread ia Almost fat free!!

This is by far the best banana bread recipe I've ever come across.  I sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top before I baked it and it gave it a nice sweet crunch.  FANTASTIC!

I did not modify this recipe at all. It was really delicious. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. I used spray butter on it and it was just like the "real" thing. My kids loved it too.  I will make again for sure!

I used 2 large bananas, added in the vanilla&salt as others suggested, and used egg white substitute. I think this is an excellent recipe, I am going to try it next with Splenda to make it even more healthy!

Excellent if you love Banana Bread, but hate all that old fatty stuff that is in the old fashioned kind!
I used 1/2 whole wheat pastry and 1/2 white flour, only 1/2 cup sugar and did 1/4 of that brown.  I used 3 bananas, dash of salt, dash of vanilla & nutmeg and it was awesome!!

This was great! I can eat banana bread and not feel bad about it. When I saw this recipe I was of course very skeptical. I figured I would give it a try and use some of the other reviewers suggestions. I was more than happy with the way it came out. Do this and you won't be disappointed. I added a 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour along with the 1 cup of all purpose flour. I was just trying to make it a little healthier. I  added 1/4 tsp of salt, I did use the 3/4 cup of sugar, I didn't add the cinnamon because I used one of those individual cinnamon applesauce cups. I used the whole thing and I think next time I will definately use more cinnamon bc I really didn't taste it in the bread. I did use one large egg instead of two egg whites. I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract and of course I added ab 1/3 of a cup of chopped walnuts. In my opinion you can't have banana bread without nuts. Also, I used 3 very ripe bananas. This was so good and I will definately make it again! The only things I may do different next time is that maybe I will use all whole wheat flour just to see how it comes out and definately more cinnamon seeing as how I only used what was in the applesauce cup this time. Thanks for this healthy take on banana bread!

The only switcharoo I did was to substitute nutmeg for the cinnamon (allergies).  It didn't rise nearly like I thought it would and I probably could have done one large loaf instead of two regular loves (I doubled the recipe).  I also followed other suggestions and used a full egg, not 2 egg whites and lowered the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Pretty darned tasty!

This is a very good recipe! I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews and it's wonderful. I did add extra banana and applesauce (and added a few chocolate chips), and I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour. I made muffins instead of a loaf, and it was delicious! I used my 'paddle' attachment on my mixer so it didn't overmix everything, and they were moist, delicious and sweet- not rubbery at all.
Thanks to the person who noted about using very ripe bananas- mine were very soft and the skins almost brown. I think that makes a big difference in how well they turn out.

Very good banana bread.  I used the entire egg not just the egg white and I used 2 bananas.  The loaf turned out great.  So happy to find a recipe that doesn't require tons of butter.

I've had much better low fat banana bread in the past. I added 1 tsp vanilla, because every baking recipe needs vanilla. Even then, it was good, but kind of "meh". The texture is great, but I can taste the cinnamon too much and the banana flavour isn't quite strong enough. I think next time I'd add a little more banana, and probably use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar to get a richer flavour without adding more fat.

For this bread being pretty much fat free, it was EXCELLENT! Yes, it does have a slightly different texture, but it's definately something that one could easily get past. The flavors are wonderful. I did add a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients and mixed the wet ingredients seperately, adding about 1 teaspoon of vanilla and an entire individual serving size container of no sugar added apple sauce (I'm guessing it was about 1/2 cup), then combining with the dry until just combined. I really LOVED this bread and so did my little guy who has already eaten 2 pieces, lol. This simple and wonderfully quick bread will be a staple at my house! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent.  Don't overcook or it will be dry.  I use 1 1/4 cup white flour and 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour.  I also use 1 egg instead of 2 whites.

This bread is the best version of low fat I have found.  It's not overly chewy like some recipes out there.  The cooking time for me seems a bit short tho, so be sure to test the middle before removing from the oven, my first loaf was still a bit gooey in the very center.  For a yummy variation, try adding some flaked coconut.  But be sure to reduce the sugar if using the sweetened kind.  So delicious, thank you!

YUMMMMMY!!!  I can't give this 5 stars just because I made quite a few alterations. I used about a 1/2 cup of white sugar (topping the measuring cup up with brown sugar), I used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground clove.  I used one whole egg and I had to throw in a bit more applesauce in order to achieve the right consistency.   The extra spices really did the trick.  Absolutely amazingly delicious!

I made 8 muffins and they were delicious! I used two bananas, added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, a dash of salt, and  a teaspoon of vanilla. I added a teaspoon of olive oil.. which I think helped with the rubbery-ness that can come along with using just apple sauce. I also used one egg instead of two egg whites. In addition, I used one cup whole wheat flour and the rest all purpose.   If you go to the recipe for "to die for bluberry muffins" there is a great streusal topping for muffins which made mine come out beautifully. You only need half of what that recipe calls for, and I just used brown sugar and low fat margarine so it didn't add a ton of calories.   yum! they were gone in two days. I would heat the muffin up for 30 seconds in the microwave then add a little butter.

I think this is a great base recipe but I followed the sugguestions of other reviewers and it came out good. I did take it out at 50 minutes because my toothpick came out clean but the bottom third was not done enough, next time i'll be more careful.

I LOVE BANANA BREAD, but am watching my fat intake. I've used applesauce instead of fat before with other recipes before and did NOT like it, so I was a little worried about this recipe as well. I followed all instructions, but added chocolate chips and 1 TBSP vanilla. It is AMAZING. My sister, who doesn't like banana bread ate two pieces and I had to pry it away from my hubbby. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

I have made it twice already and it was fantastic as it is! The key to keeping the crust "un rubbery" is to wait until the bread is completely cool to wrap it up. We love this bread and it is a great snack for those with a sweet tooth that are watching their figure.

Super simple to make. I use one egg instead of 2 egg whites and add some vanilla and fresh ground nutmeg.  I also split the flour half white and half whole wheat. You can't even tell.  I make this frequently and my family LOVES it. I also make it for my son' daycare and have yet to find somebody who doesn't love this recipe. :)

I love how people find the need to make no fat banana bread and suggest to add chocolate chips and walnuts or use the whole egg. Personally, I just smother every slice in butter!! Honestly, for almost no fat it was great.

Good jumping off recipe for a low fat banana bread!  I did add a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, increased applesauce to 1/3 cup, added 2 tsp of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp of salt and used 3 very ripe bananas and replaced the sugar with splenda.  Turned out yummy!

I really liked this recipe, I did make a couple changes, I had to add more applesauce as the batter was too dry without. Also I added some ground flax (aprox 1/4 cup), so maybe that was why I need the extra liquid? I am on WW so i wanted to add some extra fibre. I didn't give it 5 stars, as it just wasn't the real banana bread I have grown to love.

This recipe is great! You never would guess it is low fat and low calorie. I made a few tweaks to the recipe according to the ingredients I had on hand: I used brown sugar instead of white, 1 whole egg, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon coconut extract. I also sprinkled the top with granulated sugar before baking. YUM!

delicious!! i was skeptical of a low fat banana bread but this was great! following the suggestions made by others, i modified the recipe in the following ways: 3/4 c whole wheat flour and 3/4 c all-purpose flour, no white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 whole egg rather than 2 whites, 3 very ripe (black) bananas, 1/2 c applesauce, 1/2 t almond extract, 1/2 t vanilla extract, 1/2 t salt and also added 1/4 c choc chips. baked at 350 for 45 minutes and bread came out incredibly moist and delicious. will be making this one again and again!

Delicious! Instead of 3/4 c sugar I used 1/2c white sugar and about 1 tbs packed brown sugar. I added a little vanilla like others suggested and two handfulls of chopped walnuts. delicious! Made as muffins this recipe put ou 19 muffins - small little guys but I'm a banana-nut-bread-aholic and the serving sizes help me to not eat the whole loaf! I also used one whole egg instead of two white to help the bread stay together a bit better.

SO good for fat free!  I actually used about 4 medium sized bananas, so they were extra banana-y flavored, and were very moist and dense.  I also added about a tbsp cinnamon and about 2 tsp vanilla extract.  I made these into 12 muffins so they were easy to transport and portion controlled.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  Mine was rubbery the first time as well, but I attribute that to overmixing and over-baking.  It continues to cook when taken out, so it's fine if it's still a bit mushy in spots when you take it out.  It's a great way to satisfy a sweet tooth in a healthy way and is still really good with less sugar.  Thanks so much for sharing it!

I've been testing the low-fat banana breads on this site and this is by far the best I've found! I used the batter for muffins, reduced the temp to 325, and baked for 40 mins. They came out great! I also added 1/4 tsp vanilla for a little extra flavor.

Great. I made the changes suggested with 3 bananas, 1/2 cup brown sugar and  used 1/2 cup whole wheat flower. I increased the applesauce to 1/2 cup. Perfect!

Great recipe, a little dry but worth it for being low fat! I'd make again, but am still looking for that perfect banana bread that's not too sweet, not too dry, doesn't burn on the edges just perfect. This was close, but not quite the one.

I used peach sauce, instead of applesauce and a whole egg.  But the bread is great for being so low in fat!  Best Low fat Banana bread I have had!

This turned out great! I made them into mini muffins and subbed 1/2c whole wheat flour and added 1/4 tsp vanilla ext and baked for 12 mins and it was perfect. I just ate one hot and steamy from the oven and cant wait to eat another! I would have never known they were low fat! Delicious.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have found! I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 plain to make it even healthier. Wonderful texture and taste, the perfect breakfast.

I loved this recipe.I recently went on a strict diet and I miss sweets. This makes me feel like I am not cheating! 
I replaced 1 cup of white flour with wheat flour, used Splenda instead of sugar and used 1\2 cup applesauce. I will slice it up and freeze it so I can have it for breakfast for a morning pick me up! THANKS!!!!!

This is the best banana bread I have ever had, including health benefits. Usually my mom makes it, calories and all. When I made this, everyone liked it and ate it right up. I used all whole-wheat and didn't fully mush the bananas [[I forgot to]].Thank you!! I will make sure to use this recipe every time.

If I were rating this just as banana bread, it would be a 4, but as a fat-free banana bread (I can't figure out why it isn't called no fat instead of ALMOST - where is the fat coming from?) it's really pretty good.  I subbed Splenda baking blend for half the sugar.  Mine had plenty of banana flavor and was great other than it was quite chewy.  However, that was to be expected, and everyone liked it anyway. I'll make this again.

HEAVENLY! thanks so much for this recipe. i didn't need to change a thing. it was perfect. the recipe was also simple and i'm glad that it's a healthier version. i will make this again for sure!

This is really great. My husband is on a no-fat diet (although it's more like low-fat, knowing his love of all things greasy) and he enjoys banana bread. To make this lower fat, I used fat-free egg substitute in a carton instead of egg whites. I used 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/4 cup rolled oats, 1/2 c. sugar (I'm making another loaf right now, and it's half white sugar and half brown), more like 1½ tsp baking powder (I've found this recipe makes a somewhat flat loaf). I omitted the cinnamon due to allergies. Two bananas work perfectly, and I was out of applesauce so I pureed canned pears with some of the light syrup (two pear halves were perfect). Added raisins last time but not this time (we're out!). I check it after maybe 40 minutes as it was done in 45 last time. Thanks, Allison, this recipe makes a tasty loaf. :)

made into muffins, decreased sugar to less than 1/2 cup (less calories, too) and it worked well.  i did need some soymilk to loosen up the batter, but as far as low fat goes, it was great.  a word to those who are new to low fat recipes...they are always more chewy, so as far as low fat muffins go, these have a great texture!!

I was looking for a "healthy" banana bread recipe and came across this one. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to try it with some of the recommended modifications. Results were excellent. I don't like an extremely dense banana bread--I like more cakey--and this one wasnt' too bad. It had some density, but still was airy as well. The bread was very moist. Like other reviewers, I skipped the applesauce and used 6 oz of vanilla non-fat yogurt. I also opted for 3 bananas and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I also used only 1/2 cup sugar to lighten the calories. While very good, it needs a bit more punch, so next time I will add some cinnamon or nutmeg. If you have a convection oven, I highly recommend using it. It helped my results. Overall, very good.

being low fat, the taste was definitely quite good for banana bread, but i thought it was a bit chewy and tough.  also i thought it didnt rise enough. i didnt think i overmixed, because once the wet and dry ingredients were combined i put it into the loaf tin.  i used apple puree instead of applesauce(i couldnt find apple sauce here in australia).  i will definitely try this recipe again, mixing less, and possibly substituting with a whole egg instead.  but overall a good banana bread for those healthy conscious.

This is the only banana bread recipe I use it as a base. I put low fat yoghurt instead of apple sauce and it tastes great. Pecans lining the top of the loave or walnuts, it's just such a guilt free banana bread, thanks for the recipe.

This recipe blew me away because, for a low fat version of BB, I did't feel that the taste/texture had been compromised.  I used SNAPPLEMEBLUE's recommendations from 8/27/2003 except I omitted the nuts and almond extract.

Definitley one of my favorite recipes! I've made it several times and my family loves it (and they freak out anytime I'm in the kitchen whipping up something 'healthy'). I like to use 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour, add vanilla, double the cinnamon, and add a pinch of both nutmeg and cloves. The fact that there is no fat from oil or butter means I can add in my own goodies. Try 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts--delicious! I usually bake it the night before and wrap it in aluminum foil. It does tend to be a bit chewy the next morning, but for some reason after 24 hours the texture is much like that of regular banana bread. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

I thought this recipe turned out GREAT! Yes, it was a little heavy and not as fluffy as regular unhealthy banana bread. But, considering the good health of this bread it was DELICIOUS!
I used wheat flour, splenda granular, 1/2 tsp vanilla and that even made it more healthy. I baked it in a regular loaf pan and cut it into 10 slices 1/2" thick. The calories are 81.6, carbs are 13.3, sodium is 131.8 and the lo-fat is still pretty much the same. Definitely try it!

Absolutely THE best banana  bread recipe I've ever found. Not greasy, but still moist. Since they are low fat, I can afford to add 3/4c chocolate chips which really make this bread.

What a wonderful bread! I, too, upped the applesauce to 1/2 cup and added vanilla and almond extracts. It's dense and flavorful, and will be the only banana bread I make from now on. Thanks for submitting, Allison!

I made this yesterday for my partner who has to "cut down"!  It was easy to make and smelt beautiful while baking.  As it was not specified in the recipe on what to do with the egg whites, I beat them with electric beaters until fluffy.  Also, next time I make it, I will lessen the amount of sugar as it was quite sweet.  It is a really good recipe.  Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good.  I added 1/4 c chopped walnuts, 1 t vanilla, and sprinkled the top with 1 T sugar. (Made it 3 pts per serving on WW.)  I also doubled the cinnamon and would not recommend it - it was a little too strong for me.  It's definitely a dense/moist bread.

Not a bad banana bread for it being almost fat free. I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp, increased the apple sauce to 1/2 cup. I still used the same amount of banana. I also added a pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp of vanilla.. The crust was a bit rubbery but the savory taste inside made up for it

When I made this bread for the first time,I found that it was missing something.  Since then, I have been using the same recipe but I add either raisins, chocolate chips, or walnuts for exrta flavor.  I think that this recipe is great and whenever my family has a gathering, I am asked to bake this bread.  I also use whole wheat flour instead of white and it is really tasty and more nutritious.  This bread is alos perfect for my diet and it helps me enjoy eating desserts while still maintaining my weight.  It's great to know that breads this good could be low in fat!!!

Everyone loved this bread and I have made several loves. I sprinked cinamon and sugar on top before I baked it which made the crust extra good. I tried to substitue splenda for the sugar, it was still good but it had a little after taste.

I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract, 1/4 cup of sliced almonds, 1/2 tsp. allspice & 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, THEN it was good. Original recipe okay, but it tasted like it was missing something.

Wasn't the best banana bread ever, but considering that it was low-fat it was pretty darn good!  I would definitely make it again!

this recipe was great!!! i left the recipe as is without changing a thing and will be making this again very soon. like previous reviews, i will experiment in the future with more bananas and maybe some brown sugar and whole wheat flour. overall a wonderful, healthy snack that won't ruin your diet.

I just made this banana bread today and my husband and I both really liked it.  I've tried many low-fat or no-fat banana breads before and this one was the best.  I did follow the suggestion of a previous reviewer for 1/2 cup of sugar and 4 ripe bananas and it turned out just right.

Like other reveiwers suggested, I cut the sugar down to a half cup. I added 4 very ripe bananas with cinnamon applesauce. This produced a nice texture in 12 muffins, which kept very well covered tightly. Great to keep for breakfasts on the go. Next time I will add vanilla.

Not exactly like the full-fat version, but close enough to kill acraving without killing a diet.  To suck even more calories out of this recipe, I used Splenda brand sweetener.  My kids enjoyed it, too.

Not bad for low-fat.  The bread was very moist, but a bit bland.  I couldn't taste the banana when I tested the batter, so I added another 1/2 cup of mashed bananas.  I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  Next time I'll add more cinnamon, and maybe some cloves or nutmeg.

My 8 year old daughter and I made these as muffins this morning. They are very tasty and moist.  The use of unsweetened applesauce instead of oil is an added bonus. I will use these on Weight Watchers, (3 points per muffin).

This recipe was very delicious.  It needs a little bit more of a banana flavor though.  I also used 2 whole eggs instead of the whites for a richer taste. Overall, very tasty and guilt-free!

What an awesome recipe! I added one more banana than the recipe calls for, and the taste was outstanding. The bread is very moist, and considering it has no fat, I don't feel guilty eating it all the time!!

I've tried several low/no fat banana bread recipes and this one is by far the best.  I added Craisins, probably more than I should but it's still yummy!  to cut down the fat even more, I sprayed my pan instead of "lightly greasing".  I'll definitely be using this recipe in the future!

This bread was so simple that I was surprised at the flavor and moistness!  It was very tasty and didn't last long.  Even my picky eater granddaughter loved it!  The only change I made was to add pecans.  Yummy!

I've been looking for a good low fat banana bread recipe, thanks!  Per another review I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp of vanilla and almond extracts and 1/4 tsp salt.  I used one whole egg as that was what I had and would have used 3 bananas instead of two if I'd had another that was a little overly ripe.  My loaf pan is 9x5 so I changed the baking time to 35 min. Also, if I'd had some chopped nuts on hand, I would add those (1/4 cup).  All turned out great!

This is a good base recipe for low fat banana bread, but I found there was a lack of flavor the first time I made this. The second time I decided to give it a bit of a Caribbean kick-I used 1/2c brown sugar, did 3/4c whole wheat flour & all purpose flour, added 1/4 tsp allspice, and subbed in a splash of Appleton rum. I also used some dark brown bananas to give it an added sweetness. My husband raved about it so much he's already requested I only ever use this recipe in the future!

Second time I made this recipe, liked it the first time and loved it the second.  I did use some of the suggestions offered by other reviews, I used 1/3 cup oatmeal, 3 very ripe bananas moderately mashed, I like a little texture,  1/2 cup or scant more whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour.  I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and I used sugar in the raw and I also added 1/2 cup of raisins, but next time I will add 2/3 cup, I also soaked the raisins in hot water before mixing into the batter and I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  The bread is a tad rubbery but extremely flavorful.

I like things really sweet, so this didn't quite live up to my sweet tooth, but it was moist and dense, and everyone who had a slice *loved* it. I added more cinnamon than it called for and used cinnamon applesauce instead, but other than that, no modifications! Definitely a great potluck or bakesale bread!

Yummy banana bread that is more healthy than most.  Based on my preferences I used a little more banana and applesauce and reduced the sugar to 1/2 c.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla as well.  I love a recipe with flexibility!

Great recipe! I cut the sugar like others had suggested by 1/2 and it was plenty. I also used 1/2 cup of wheat flour and 1 cup of bread flour instead of the 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour. Thanks for the posting!

I made this bread last saturday, 2 loaves. It turned out excellent. I did dust the top with a tad bit of brown sugar before going in the oven, and added some dried cranberries to one loaf. Incredible. Will make from now on, no more regular fat banana bread at our house!

This is a really good recipe and the fact that is has almost no fat makes it even better. I just used one egg instead of two whites and added nutmeg.

Bread looks beautiful and tastes pretty good for low fat.  I guess I just don't like the extra stickiness you get with low fat recipes.  It's just a texture thing for me.  I would probably make again though.

I Love this Recipe!  Out of all the healthy/low fat banana breads I've made over the years, this one turned out the tastiest!  I substituted Splenda Brown Sugar (1/2 cup), Whole Wheat Flour, added 1/4 cup of walnuts & 1/4 cups of ground flax seed to make it lower in sugar, higher in fiber & good fats.  This makes a balanced low-fat healthy banana bread for the whole family!  Yum.  Happy Cooking!

In place of the 1/4 cup applesauce, I like to use a strawberry/applesauce snack cup, and 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I've been using this recipe for a few years now with my variation and it turns out perfectly moist every time.  :)  I also don't fuss about exactly one cup of mashed banana.  Usually 2 does the job just fine.  :)

I've been looking for a healthier banana bread, and this recipe has done it for me! I did make a few alterations: I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and only 1/2 cup all-purpose, used 1 egg instead of 2 whites, substituted raw sugar for white and decreased the amount to 1/2 cup, added 1/4 tsp of salt, added a handful of chopped walnuts, and lightly sprinkled the top with quick oats before baking. It could have used some more bananas, but I'm perfectly happy with how it turned out. Other reviews suggested adding 1 tsp of vanilla, which I had every intention of doing, but forgot. I imagine that would have added a nice, new depth to the bread. This is a great, basic, and healthy recipe to play with and build from. It turned out great... right out of the oven and drizzled with a little honey :)

I didn't really li a it. Even if I forgot the sugar. Plus it was heavy and was best warm out of the oven. Not very good the next day. Sometimes, the real fat version is best, especially for breads, cakes, or muffins.

This will replace my other favourite bananna bread recipe.  I too added 1 tsp. vanilla, used 1 whole egg and added a handfull of raisins.  Do Not over  stir the wet into the dry ingredients. The taste is exquisit.

LOVED THIS BREAD.  Added 1 tsp vanilla, used 1 whole egg instead of two egg whites, two large ripe bananas, one of the single serving applesauce cups and a handful of chocolate chips.  Only mix wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until blended. Do not over mix. I baked mine for 64 mins. in a glass loaf pan and it was perfect!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this recipe as mini-muffins and they were delish and a great consistency! I added extra cinnamon and some nutmeg. I wonder how they would cook up with half whole-wheat flour and half all-purpose?

I add a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to get more flavor. Also, I bake 25 degrees lower with foil covering it so the crust doesn't get as tough. For time, just keep an eye on it.

This was a great recipe! I was leary of it because of other people's comments, but I made it with a little more banana (because I wanted to use all that I had), and it turned out great - surprised my wife by not telling her how low in fat it was until she tried it. I will be making this again and again.

I make this banana bread frequently throughout the year and use wheat flour instead of all purpose and it tastes great....very moist.  I also mix in chocolate chips at times or nuts.

I did this exactly like the recipe called and got a rubbery crust and a good yet bland inside.  I will try to make this again with the suggestions from other reviewers.

This is the best low-fat bread recipe i've tried by now. I've substitute the banana with home made pumpkin puree. I cut down the sugar and i've used 0 calorie liquid sweetener (50 drops), i also added vanilla, all spices and 1 tbsp peanut butter (home made). What can i say: Delicious!! Because the pumpkin is low-calorie, the nutrition valories did changed a little: 71 ckal per serving.

Some commenters have mentioned that there seems to be something missing. Actally, I think that thing is bananas! I tweaked this through several test runs, and this is the deal: DOUBLE the bananas and add a pinch of salt. Barely stir, just until everything is blended. I ended up with a moist, sweet loaf this way, just about perfect for a sour-cream-less banana bread.

It turned out OK with good flavor. It was soft, but also very chewy and dense, which I thought might happen when I noticed how dry the mixture was. It was quite difficult to mix together and perhaps because of that I over mixed it and it became dense. Anyways, perhaps a bit more applesauce would have helped.

This recipe is amazing!!!  I also used the suggestions on the Jan 7, 2004 review and she was spot on.  I forgot to buy applesauce and used greek yogurt instead.  I don't like cakes with applesauce anyway, they don't stay together and you can hardly eat them with a fork.  The greek yogurt worked awesome!  I made muffins and they are so nice and dense, I'll never use applesauce again.  I am also looking into using honey or if I have to, Splenda and see how the recipe works that way.  I may have to bake these every week!!!  Love it!!!!

I made these yesterday. I used splenda instead of sugar and added nuts.  I made muffins instead of bread and they were great.  My husband grabs one and out the door he goes to work.  It is great for cutting the fat out of a breakfast treat he likes.  Thank you.

Love this! Read reviews and made the following changes: Used 1 c. white flour and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour. Used 1 whole egg rather than egg whites. Used 3 bananas. Added 1/2 cup walnuts.

I did make a few changes. I used whole wheat flour and just under 1/2 cup sugar and the rest splenda. Like some other reviewers said I used 1/2 tsp nutmeg and about 1 tsp vanilla. It is a very heavy bread but has a very yummy flavor. My 5 year old loved it as well. It would be good with maybe a little extra banana as well.

This was really good, especially for being low-fat.  I did use one whole egg instead of just egg whites, didn't want to create any waste, but the substitute was fine.  I may experiment next time and add a cinnamon, brown sugar, pecan swirl.

Love this recipe! I made these last night and had them for breakfast today. I made them in muffin form and sprinkled chopped pecans and oats on top before baking. I also added 1/4 cup lowfat buttermilk and 1 tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients. Of course the cooking time is shorter when making muffins rather than a loaf. 18-20 minutes worked for me.  This will be my new banana bread recipe. No need for the fat when they taste this good.

Excellent recipe. I used a scant 1/2 cup of Splenda (for baking), 1/2 the cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp. each nutmeg and vanilla. I bake as muffins for portioning :-)

Recipe also works great with 1 cup canned pumpkin instead of banana for pumpkin spice muffins!

Delicious! A moist, somewhat cake-like, healthy banana bread. The concept alone gets at least 3 stars!  Following the recipe as given, my biggest complaint is the amount of sugar. There is no reason to add that much; it's plenty sweet. Next time, 1 whole egg instead of 2 whites (just for convenience), more spice & vanilla, whole wheat flour, and 1/3 to 1/2 c. of a less processed sweetener. Don't overmix! Don't overbake!

I would give this recipe a 3.5.  The taste was good for a healthy bread.  I cooked for the recommended time and center was still kind of gooey.  Bread was a little heavy and didn't expand much.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I made a few changes; 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 egg, 4 bananas, 1/3 cup applesauce, 1/8 teaspoon of salt and 1 tsp of vanilla.  A little brown sugar sprinkled on top, a handful of raisins and this came out perfect; moist, flavourful and delicious.

Do not omit salt in this recipe, and also, as for any bread or muffin recipe, mix wet and dry ingredients separately and then add dry ingredients to the wet ones just until moistened...it is ok if batter appears lumpy when there is fruit in the recipe. I also added vanilla and nutmeg, and as suggested by another rater, a brown sugar and water syrup poured on top makes this bread top crunchy and sweet, however I also added salt in the syrup topping.

Great low-fat choice! I followed the advice of others re using a little salt and nutmeg, and substituted part of the sugar with Splenda. I only had cinnamon applesauce on hand, which worked great. It made 9 large muffins, baked for about 24 minutes. While they aren't as good as the neighborhood bakery, they have a LOT fewer grams of fat. Thanks!

This is fantastic!!! I followed the recipe except that I used pumpkin puree because I didn't have any banana on hand but really wanted to make a quick bread LOL.. This is really quick to assemble, took me less than 10 min, pretty much the time the oven was preheating. The bread came out amazingly well, pretty and tasty. A keeper! I will try banana next time when I have bananas.

Good overall recipe! I did tweak some ingredients though. I used one whole egg as opposed to two whites and two bananas (I didnt bother to measure one cup)Also, I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Also, a pinch of salt. I prepared the wet and dry ingredients seperately, then mixed them before pouring them. I didn't have a loaf pan, so I made cupcakes instead.(same temp. for 20 minutes) They turned out quite moist and very delicious. I will defenitly make these again.

I made this with my diabetic husband in mind.  Splenda sweetened applesauce, splenda instead of sugar, and two bananas.  It turned out a little chewy and not as "bready" as I wanted, not sure why, but with some butter and warmed I'm sure it will be fine.  I forgot to spray the pan, so it stuck like crazy, but I plan on making another batch tomorrow (have two more bananas to use up), and will maybe add a little more baking powder to see if it rises a little more. Overall, a good recipe if you are watching your weight, fat intake, or sugar. Thanks for posting.

Super easy and very tasty way to make a healthy version of banana bread. Next time I'll cut down the sugar a little, as it was on the sweet side for my taste. Also, the texture came out a little more spongy than I would have preferred, so I'll have to make adjustments to get it a little heavier. But as-is, this a great recipe that I'll be making again and again!

LOVED this!! The only things I added were a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of salt. This was perfectly moist, very flavorful, and I don't feel guilty eating it. I will be making this repeatedly.

As the recipe is written I'd give it 4 stars but like most of the other reviewers I also tweak it a little to my tastes. I've been using this recipe for literally years.  I never separate the egg whites and just use whole eggs, and I always use homemade applesauce, add walnuts and/or chocolate chips and I add more cinnamon. I have made this recipe countless times and have found that it's really a loosy goosy recipe. You don't have to be really exact with your measurements and it always comes out great. I might add 2 bananas one time and 4 the next depending on what I have on hand and I have never, even once, had this recipe fail.

I should have known better.  Baking with NO fat always yields a chewy bread.  This was really sweet and had a bad texture and even smelled strange.  Stick with traditional recipes!

Yum! Without additions, a 4, but with them, a 5. I made these into 12 muffins, and I followed other reviewers advice to kick the recipe up a notch. I used 1.5 cups flour, 1/4 cup each white and brown sugar, 1.25 tsps baking powder, 1/2 tsp each baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. 1 egg, 3 bananas, 1/3 cup applesauce, and 1 tsp vanilla. I mixed the dry ingredients in one bowl, wet ingredients (plus sugar) in another bowl and then added the dry to the wet. I stirred gently and stopped as soon as it was mixed. Careful, as over-stirring can ruin the muffins/bread. I cooked the muffins for 17 minutes and in my hot oven they came out perfect. The toothpick test will always let you know. This is a great recipe to build on and next time I'll try adding 1/4 cup chopped nuts. Very delicious and I highly recommend it.

For an almost no fat banana bread, it was okay. I added toasted walnuts but... I don't know, I guess I missed the fat. My kids and husband didn't like it. I toasted a slice in my toaster oven and it was a little better that way but in the end, I slathered some butter on it.

This was great! I used whole wheat and it worked out fine. I did use an extra 1/2 cup of banana because of the whole wheat. It was a very healthy snack that the kids really enjoyed.

This is pretty good.  I followed the recipe with a couple of exceptions recommended by other reviewers.  I used a 1/2 cup of sugar plus one tablespoon of splenda for extra sweetness without the calories.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and used apple pie spice instead of cinnamon.  It's really very good, crispy outside and moist inside.  Not rubbery as others have experienced.

I could definitely tell it was missing the fat and so could my kids...they wouldn't eat it after a sample taste, but I still liked it well enough to bake again for myself. The bread was a little rubbery...even though I made sure not to over stir and use very ripe bananas.

I changed it up a little after reading some reviews. I used 1/3 c apple sauce and only 1/2 c of sugar along with some nutmeg, some almond extract, and some pecans. It came out very good. Not too bad for a lower fat banana bread!

This recipe is a good base. I followed suggestions from other reviewers and added salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. I also mixed the dry ingredients first and then mixed in the wet. I increased the apple sauce to 1/3rd cup. I also put a crumble mixture on top (brown sugar, butter and cinnamon) to give the crust a crunchy texture. The bread is a little rubbery, but still good.

I liked this recipe. It's definitely not too sweet and because I can't chew nuts right now, I dumped 5 handfuls of walnuts into the blender while I peureed the bananas. That added to the flavor quite nicely. Next time, I'll double the recipe so I can send a loaf home with my granddaughters when they stop by after school. They like Grandmas baking and I like to give hem something different each time they come to my home.

This was super good!!! i made a couple of changes as well. Instead of the egg whites i just used one whole egg.  I also used all brown sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce  and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Overall this is a great recipe!!!! Awesome

Interesting to find butter/oil is not needed. I didn't add much sugar to the cake mixture since the applesauce (1 cup mashed apples + 1 cup water + 1/4 c brown sugar) is sweet enough. Added instant oatmeal as well. Increased the salt to 1 tsp as well. This is healthy and tasty. Not rubbery at all.

This is pretty good, especially for low fat. I make banana bread a lot so I'm used to the high fat kinds but this is really good if you're trying to watch what you are eating. I did add a little salt to it.

Really yummy with some modifications. I doubled the amount of applesauce and decreased the sugar to 2/3 cup. I also added 1/4 cup walnuts and 1/4 cup chopped dates to the batter. Delicious! Thank you for a healthy banana bread recipe!

I love this banana bread and so does everyone I've ever made it for. It always turns out, is so easy and is very moist. I have had nothing but success with this one in all the years I've been using it! The recipe is perfect the way it is but I add a total of 1 teaspoon of cinnamon because I really like cinnamon.

2016 Update: We recently started finding ways to reduce our sugar so I abandoned this recipe in search of a no sugar banana bread. My family loves this bread and keep asking why we can't just have the 'old' banana bread so I made this but eliminated the sugar and doubled the banana and it did not disappoint! Moist, flavourful and tastes the same. This recipe has proven to be versatile and we love it!

My family loved this recipe. I used two bananas (I put them in the freezer when they are too ripe to eat and keep them for banana bread later). Next time I make this I will cut the sugar a bit but we thought the flavor was really good. The crust does get slightly rubbery but I don't see how that is a problem.

This bread has a really great texture and flavor considering it has almost no fat in it. I added chopped walnuts to mine and it went fast.

Certainly not as good as the full fat version, but very good considering it is low fat.  I have made it twice and it turned out perfect both times.  The only change I made was to use one whole egg instead of 2 egg whites and I used whole wheat flour because that was all I had.  It still turned out perfectly moist with a nice crunchy top.  A perfect healthy snack for me and the kids!

I think next time I make this I will add a little more on the spice side but this was actually really good considering how healthy it is for banana bread.  The kids still asked for seconds so I consider it a hit!

This banana bread is absolutely wonderful. It is so yummy and moist you would never even know it has no oil or butter in it. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose to make it even more healthy and it was great.

I made some changes, so my rating is based on how mine turned out ;-)  I substituted some of the AP flour for spelt flour (1/2 cup), put in a heaping cup of bananas (wish I had put in more, maybe 2 cups), used a half cup of applesauce, one whole egg, added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla, a 1/4 tsp of almond extract and a pinch of salt.  I also put in 1/4 cup brown sugar and the rest turbinado sugar.  I made 12 muffins and sprinkled some of the turbinado sugar on the top.  I may have overbaked, they cooked faster than I thought (probably about 18 min at 350).  The texture was nice, I think my spelt may have made it a little heavier than just AP flour would be.  They were on the sweet side but do seem to be missing something.  I dont usually put cinnamon in my banana bread, so I might leave that out next time and just try doubling the banana?  For having no oil or butter, I thought they turned out great.  I'm trying to find healthier breads/muffins for my boys to eat as snacks.  I bet they taste better the next day, or I usually like to freeze my quick breads, they seem to get extra moist after being frozen.  I will try them again and maybe keep with just AP flour and maybe try adding a little wheat germ.

Yes, my crust was rubbery! But the inside was nice and moist. I didn't have baking soda (prob. why it didn't turn out). I used sweet n low for the sugar. I will try this again the right way!

Based upon other reviewers I did change this recipe just a bit.  FOr some added fiber I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup white flour.  I also added a a little salt and extra cinnamon since I was out of nutmeg.  I also used 3 bananas.  I kept the egg whites.  This bread was wonderful and I made them into muffins to make sure I had 12 servings.  Absolutely wonderful!!!

This is excellent banana bread - I, too, followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added some spices to add flavor.  With the additions, you cannot tell that it is low in fat.  Excellent!

Not bad at all for 'almost no fat' banana bread!  I'm glad I waited a couple of days to rate this after I made it.  First day, ehh... not very impressive.  But, next day, sooo much better!  I followed advice of reviewer who added vanilla and almond extract and reduced sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also used half all purpose and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I found I had to use a little more than 1/3 cup applesauce to get the batter the right consistency so it wasn't so dry.  I did use 3 'nanners' as recommended by others and would do so when I make this again.  I sprinkled the top with oatmeal for an extra touch.  Thanks for sharing!

I used 1/4 cup egg replacer instead of the whites but didn't change anything else. My husband is on Weight Watchers and each serving of this bread is about 2 points, so to make sure we got 12 servings I made the batter into 12 muffins which I baked for between 15-20 minutes.  Delicious.  The kids loved them and so did their dad.

My husband didn't know it was low in fat!  I think I need to cook it about 15 minutes longer next time.  (I kept adding minutes because it wasn't done yet.)  I'll try it again sometime when I have to use up some bananas :)

The Banana Bread was delicious! I substituted a little of the flour with wheat flour and it turned out yummy. The nutrition information shows 12 slices would contain 128 calories each. That would make the slices little bitty... so I cut the loaf into six equal slices and figure they are about 256 calories each. Thank you for this recipe.

Yummy!  About the best banana bread I have eaten, and with no extra fat! 
I did use one whole egg instead of the two egg whites, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Came out great, and will be putting this in my recipe book as my main banana bread recipe!

I modified this recipe a bit: used one whole egg (if going for low cholestrol it's better to go with two egg whites), cut the sugar amount to less than half and added more mashed babanas and pitted/chopped dates to more naturally sweeten the batter (also added 1/4 cut chocolate chips) and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. I know, it's  little busy this way but that's how we like it :)

I didn't make any substitutions, although my oven is wonky so it baked for closer to 40 minutes, but it turned out great.  I like it better than "regular" banana bread recipes - the top doesn't get as sticky, the crust isn't rubbery, and it doesn't fall apart.

Although I love this recipe and make it all the time, I basically only use part of the recipe and a bunch of the suggestions from everyone else...therefore I'm only giving it a 4 because the original recipe is not the one I really enjoy. Modifications I've made: 3/4 c all-purpose flour, 3/4 c whole-wheat flour, 1/2 c white sugar, 1/4 t salt, 1/2 milk, 3-4 bananas, 1/2 c applesauce, 1/2 t vanilla extract, 1/2 t nutmeg.

I loved it!!  I took some advise from some of the other users, and this is what I did. I used Hodgson Mill 50/50 wheat & white flour, I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 tsp. salt, upped the applesauce to 1/3 cup, upped bananas to 3, and I minused the Sugar to 1/2 cup, I also added about 1/3 cup of Milled Flax Seed,to get you Omega-3 oils.  The bread came out great, My Husband loved it, it tasted so good just out of the oven with some butter. Thanks So Much.

This had amazing texture, and the flavor was good enough- considering the lack of fat.  The flavor is actually more like 4 stars. I replaced 1/2 cup of the white flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I used a little bit less sugar than called for, and I used 3 over-ripe bananas.  I used a bit more applesauce (almost 1/3 cup, approx.) and I added 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips and 1 tsp salt (I was very glad I had added the salt!).  I also used one whole egg rather than the 2 whites (didn't have any other use for the yolks, and felt too bad to throw them away).  I made these into mini-muffins.  My husband and I have already eaten a bunch of them.  I just can't get over the fluffy texture!

I made these as muffins, adding 1/2 cup oat bran and 2 Tbsp ground flaxseed, and they were very delicious!  After reading some reviews on the texture, I was not expecting something so good.  This is my *new* banana bread recipe, thanks!!

I thought this was wonderful. even my hubby liked it and he is not a low/no fat eater. the only thing i did was take half the recipe and add about 1 Cup of great grains for an added crunch (which i liked and my friend does not and i shared this recipe with her) i loved that it is diet(lifestyle change) friendly..lol this is a definate keeper thank you

Oh gosh, this is the most amazing banana bread I've ever made. Hands down. And so VERY healthy. I think I've died and went to heaven? Hah.

I used Splenda instead of sugar, and added some vanilla extract. =]

This was very tasty!  Delicious despite the no oil!  I made this twice - one time with 1/4c of grated apple, and one time with 1/2c of yogurt, and I'd have to say the yogurt one had a better texture.  I also made the following adjustments: 1/2c sugar, 1/2t vanilla, pinch of salt, and 3/4c of all bran to up the fiber.  I made the bread in my rice cooker so it was very moist.

This was much better than I expected. Usually low fat banana breads lack taste. This one had most of the taste of "regular" banana bread and was easy to make.

I liked that it was lowfat, but it didn't taste as good I thought it would be. There was not enough banana flavor. I think the applesauce was what made the texture all chewy and sticky. Overall, it is okay for a lowfat recipe.

This turned out good for me.  No hard crust as others have said.  I did lower the oven temp to 325 degrees for 40 min. as suggested from another review.  I used one whole egg, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 3 bananas and 1/2 c applesauce.  It seemed a little dry so I added about 1/4 c (maybe a little less) of egg nog. I used flour, sugar, soda, and cinnamon as called for.

Well, maybe I did something wrong, but while the flavor was good, this was really tough bread.  I know not to overhandle flour or else you risk tough bread, so i think I was careful.  I did make one change which might have been fatal - I made mini muffins.  I saw another review that said the interior was moist but the crust was tough - maybe since I made mini-muffins the toughness was emphasized.

Ok - I may have spoken too soon.  I retried the recipe and made a loaf, increasing the banana, substituting whole wheat flour for 1/2 the flour.  Came out pretty good!

This was surprisingly good.  I used 1 whole egg, 1.5 medium bananas, 1/2 c. applesauce, 1/2 c. oats/1 c. flour, and added nutmeg & vanilla, and it was ready in about 40 - 45 minutes (hot oven).  This was really moist and delicious and my kids ate it up.  Since I buy too many bananas and then they go bad, I will be making this often!

this banana bread is very moist and chewy, but i found that it does not have a lot of flavor. though over all my family liked the fact that it's a healthier lower fat dessert/snack. i will make it again, but with more cinnamon and banana.

I thought this recipe was okay.  I did make some revisions to it... including upping the cinammon, adding nutmeg, and using whole wheat flour instead of the white.  I actually forgot the egg... and it still did work.  I think the taste was only average but maybe that's b/c of my changes.  BTW, if you do use the whole wheat flour...make sure to up the baking powder & soda to get the rise.  Will definitely try it again, with less revisions.

This is a great low-fat recipe. I made a couple changes too. I used brown sugar instead of white, added some cinnamon and nutmeg, used 1 1/2 cups bananas, and I made them into muffins. I put the muffins in the freezer and take one out for a low-fat, low-calorie snack every day.  Great recipe!

I have made this recipe over and over and over again and I never get bored of it!  It's an amazing, guilt free snack.  It tastes the best when it just comes out of the oven because the crust is a little crispy.  Once it's a few days old, the crust becomes soft.  I usually add the suggested cinnamon plus some and I usually end up mashing 3 bananas which comes to a little over a cup.  The extra banana makes the loaf even better.

This recipe was great!!! I loved it. I used equal instead of regular sugar (I'm diabtetic) and it was great. I also added vanilla and put more cinnamin. It was awesome.

This is what I was looking for. We always go to America skiing and have this after a hard day. Its just wonderful and moist and full of flavour. I made it with a whole egg and added dates and walnuts for extra texture. Yum Yum

This was okay...I used quite a lot more applesauce just to get the dry ingredients to incorporate. Instead of making a loaf I put the batter into a muffin tin. Baking time was just a few minutes. The flavor was good, not great but they are definately very low in fat which I like. May or may not try again.

This was an excellent recipe.  I took some of the previous reviewers suggestions and used one whole egg instead of the two egg whites.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of both vanilla and almond extract.  The only complaint I have is that the crust was too chewy.  I will try to adjust the applesauce quantity the next time I make it maybe that will help.

I thought this bread was really good.  I followed the previous suggestions of adding vanilla, nutmeg, and a little extra applesauce and banana.  I also used whole eggs, and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I also dusted the pan with Splenda/cinnamon after spraying it with cooking spray.  My loaf only took about 40 minutes to bake; this may be why my crust was not chewy at all.  I will use this recipe again!

If your love banana bread and want to watch the fat intake, this recipe's for you.  The moistness derived from applesauce.  Great taste.

This bread was lovely. I used brown sugar instead of white and only used about half of what the recipe called for - then I added some chocolate chips to make up for the sweetness.  I also mixed in some whole wheat flour for some added fiber - turned out great!  Thanks...

Delicious!  The crust was a little chewy, but otherwise fantastic.  I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup applesauce, adding the nutmeg and vanilla.  I also tried it as muffins omitting the nutmeg and adding extra cinnamon.  Great with pecans in the mix too, yum!  THanks!!

This recipe was wonderful.  I was excited to find a low-fat banana bread.  I made the bread according to the specified directions.  It was very moist. My husband came home from work & wanted to try some right away.  He loved it and requests it all of the time.  My 2 year old loved it as well.  The second time I made it I added some chopped walnuts, but changed nothing else because it was so great to begin with.  This bread doesn't last long at our house.  Thanks!

Added extras as mentioned and it was great for a no-fat bread.  Made double batch and baked muffins and bread.  I would suggest cooking it less than stated for a less chewier crust.  Smelled wonderful and tastes better than the oily versions.

This bread was so good.  I made some for my work since we all have desk jobs and are always on a diet.  They loved it, and my husband did as well.
I used double the amount of cinnamon and topped it with a thin glaze of milk and powdered sugar.  
Thank you for this great recipe-April

I was looking for a banana bread recipie that would fit with Weight Watchers & this one fits!  Great snack for the "sweet munchies" & only 2 pts per slice.  I put in 2 bananas & the 1 tsp vanilla & it is very good, next time I'll follow the suggestion I saw about 4 bananas & 1/2 c sugar. Will definitly make again!

dense and sticky, but very tasty.  If you like dense bread, this is for you.  I'm more of a fluffy type myself.

Hubby and I think this banana bread is great.The first time I made it before reading any revues and followed the recipe as written.Today I doubled the recipe and added raisins to the second loaf.For us the raisins made it even better but it does make it sweeter.I will try some of the other suggestions because I know I will make this loaf often.And last but not least a little trick my sister taught me.When that last banana in the bunch has gone a little too black or soft to enjoy,throw it in the freezer.Just defrost them in the microwave when you are ready to bake your bread and you have the sweetest blackest bananas you could ask for.A little yukky, but works great and saves from throwing the banana out because you don´t have enough for the recipe.

This bread came out perfect! I was suprised how moist it turned out--and the texture was wonderful. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour, and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. of salt as recommended. This is probably the best low fat recipe I've ever made. Will definitely be making again.

For such a healthy recipe, the results were pretty darn good!  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and added nutmeg and 1/2 tsp vanilla as recommended.  Next time might try without cinnamon.  Texture was moist and tender on the inside- wonderful.  Texture on the outside was slightly tough but who cares when it's that good for you.

Now, I credit this to my own fault as I should have read the reviews before making. I liked it, but mine did turn out rubbery from stirring too much, but I will not give up on it because it did have great flavor not to mention I added extra cinnamon. I will take the other reviewers suggestions by adding the vanilla and salt. I will keeep this on hand because it is so low in  fat, next time I will remember to be sure to take care when preparing, as I said, it does have great flavor.

This is great recipe.  I made it on a friday night and by sunday it was gone.  No one could believe that it was low fat.  I, too, decreased the amount of sugar and substitued cinnamon applesauce and thought it was perfect.  Very moist and delicious.  Definitely a keeper.

My banana loving boyfriend loved this recipe.  We added some walnuts and a little bit more applesauce for extra moistness.  It was yummy.  We'll definitely be making it again.  Thanks Allison.

I've trimmed down banana bread recipes before, and I thought this one did it marvelously.  I dusted the top with cinnamon sugar and finely chopped walnuts before baking.  
It's moist and tasty.

Not bad considering it's low fat and only 2 points per serving on weight watchers. I found it to be "heavy", not very moist. I left it in the oven for 55 minutes but I think maybe it wasn't enough. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. Will give it another try. Next time, I hope it will be as moist as most other raters have found it to be.

This recipe smelled soooo good in the oven. However, after an hour of anticipation, I was really disappointed. The bread so bland I ended up tossing it out. I would definitely not waste my time or effort on this recipe ever again.

This recipe was pretty bland, and was too chewy for lack of a better word. I've tried other things with applesauce and gotten the same results...so I guess I'm just not lucky with applesauce!

My family loved this recipe and made no complaints about it being low fat.  The bread was very flavourful and moist and was wonderful served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. A definite keeper!!

This recipe was wonderful but i did make some changes, i used my homemade cinn. applesauce, and a little more applesauce and banana then called for.  I also added two tablespoons of low-fat yogurt.  I also used the whole egg.  Next time i might try just the whites.  This bread turned out WONDERFUL!

Instead of Almost no fat banana bread it should be called almost no taste banana bread. I was very disapointed in this recipe and will not try again.

I read the other reviews and decided to try this recipe out....it was awesome!! I cannot believe it is low in fat...the applesauce really keeps this bread moist. I used a little less sugar too, about 2/3 cup, and it was still sweet. I've given some to the babysitter, and co-workers, not to mention my husband. Everyone likes it and is equally surprised it's low-fat! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

You will not believe this is no-fat. I used cinnamon applesauce and a bit of nutmeg for a spicier taste, and to celebrate this great, guilt-free recipe, I added chocolate chips and walnuts. So good you can give it as a gift to health-conscious friends.

Excellent flavor! Easy to make as I'm not a baker. Love the low fat version. It makes it easy for the members of my family with high blood pressure and high cholestrol to enjoy something good. Great texture and very moist.

I DEFINITELY needed to cook longer than 55 min.  Over an hour.  The bread is cook, but very chewy.  I'll probably make it again since my friends loved it.

PERFECTION 
I have been on the hunt for a GOOD banana bread recipe forever and ive FINALLY FOUND IT!
Its EXACTLY what i want in a good banana bread! Its perfectly soft and moist, dense almost because its so moist?? But airy at the same time! Im not a fan of the overly light & airy banana breads and this one has the PERFECT texture! Its not overly sweet at all, which i was afraid of, infact i was planning on only adding 1/2c sugar, but upon reading reviews, 1/2c wouldve been not sweet enough so i used 3/4c and it was the perfect amount!
I dont see why does this recipe doesnt have 8k 5-star ratings because this recipes tops ALL the other banana breads ive tried EASILY

I used pancake and waffle mix instead of flour. I omitted the baking soda/powder because pancake mix has it already. I also used 2 whole eggs. Really good not too sweet either.

I made this recipe, but didn't have applesauce, so I increased the amount of banana by 1/4 cup to substitute for the applesauce.  I also added a cup of blueberries.   I like it.  I will make it again if my husband enjoys it.  He is trying to transition to a low fat heart healthy diet.

Turned out great! I added a whole egg and just before baking I sprinkled cinnamon, sugar, a tiny sprinkle of instant oats (for decoration really) and the teeniest tiniest pats of butter. Turned out gorgeous, golden brown and moist. This would be delicious with nuts and chocolate chips. Goes great w hot tea!

Everything you could expect from a good banana bread. Moist, flavorful, satisfying. I added chocolate chips and walnuts for some variation. Definitely going to be my go-to recipe!

I’ve tried many recipes for banana bread before and this one was the best. My entire family loved it. My kids keep asking me for more. I followed the recipe exactly as it is. However instead of smashing the bananas with a fork I used a hand blender. Best banana bread recipe ever!!! Thank you!

YUM! I made these into muffins. Baked for 20-25min. These are my new favorite. I did read some of the reviews, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/8 tsp of salt nd 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I also addded a sprinkle of chocolate chips on top. 

As long as you mix the dry ingrediants well in a seperate bowl then the wet in another and only mix them together enough to moisten they turn out perfect. 

Mix too much and they get chewy.  I can't wait to try these with added coconut and pineapple.

Excellent recipe !!
I had added an extra 1/2 c of flour and the batter went a little dry at first..
So I added another quarter of sugar free applesauce and about a 1/4 c. Of hazelnut coffee creamer to get the batter to pour smooth...
Turned out nicely, I may add some walnuts next time..
Five thumbs up on a great recipe..

As others suggested I added the nutmeg, used whole eggs (I tripled the recipe) and put brown sugar on top. I set the time at the lessor setting of 50 minutes and was very glad I did, it was ready to come out then. This recipe is a little less sweet than I personally like but I like it on the sweet side. I did not decrease the sugar due to my personal preference. The brown sugar on top adds a very nice crunch and is very pleasing to the eye. My grandson didn’t even let it cool before he cut out a large hunk! It is good!

Made it with slight changes. I added 1tsp of vanilla, as other reviews said. I also didn’t see that it was 2 egg WHITES, thought just eggs. So I ended up just using one whole egg. Turned out great.

A very tasty bread or muffin!  I believe it is a good basic recipe that can be tweaked with other ingredients, such as raisins.  I also used apple butter when I had no applesauce.  A great recipe for those who can not have fat!

The only things I did differently were to add 1/2 tsp vanilla, and I mixed the wet and dry separately first. otherwise this was great. I have been watching my fat intake since getting gallstones and this was a very welcome treat!

Following the suggestions of others I used 1/2 c brown sugar, one whole egg instead of 2 whites, 6 bananas instead of 2 and 1/3 cup applesauce. Added 1tsp vanilla extract and 1tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 c chopped walnuts.

4 stars because not quite as good as a recipe that is not low fat!  I did as suggested in several reviews: added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/3 cup applesauce, almost 3/4 sugar, 1 egg instead of 2 egg whites, 1 tsp vanilla; baked as muffins only 15 minutes at 350 degrees.   Made for my sister-in-law who has to maintain a low fat, low sugar diet.  She thought they were great!

It was very moist.  I did substitute the white sugar for brown sugar, and I only had a mixed, homemade rhubarb-applesauce.  Next time I will put a little foil over the top the last 15 min. to avoid over-browning.  I will definitely make it again.

Bless it!! (4.5)  Heres what I did differently from the recipe/added & it turned out amazing: half whole wheat flour & half all-purpose, one whole egg, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/8th tsp salt, and 2 tsp vanilla extract. I also separated the wet & dry ingredients until final mixing

This recipe is just right, I have cut the suger to 1/2 cup, but I belive if you like to add whole nut you need to stick to the mentioned measurement of sugar, I made the apple sauce my self and It turned out fabulous, I used three medium sized bananas, I have whisked the eggs white,and the recipe took 50 min. Using electric oven. I loved the recipe and diffently will  add it to my favorites but next time I believe I 'll use whole nut.

I have been making this recipe for years and it comes out perfect every time. I add 1/2 tsp of vanilla and that is all. If I make mini muffins for the kids, I put them in for about 20-22 minutes!

I will make again, it was moist, fluffy/springy.  Doubled recipe.  Added 1/2 tsp salt, and used 2 whole eggs (I added a dab of butter - haha). With ~half batter, made 12 muffins and cooked for about 18 minutes. The other part, I put it in a loaf pan and cooked it about 55 minutes.

With some tweaks, it came out AMAZING! I've got people begging me for my recipe!  I followed the advice of some other users and changed the recipe a little: I used 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp salt, one whole egg instead of 2 whites, 3 bananas instead of two and 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt instead of applesauce - everything else was as is.

I’m not sure if I’m just used to the full fat recipes I’ve always done but this wasn’t good! I had two bites and realized it wasn’t worth saving the rest. I took notes and followed what others did to add flavor. To prevent it from being rubbery I folded in the ingredients versus a mixer but was still on the tougher side. Not making this again. I’m super bummed!

I read the reviews and used less sugar and more apple sauce.  I also added some nutmeg and a little vanilla.  I like that this recipe has some versatility. The bread turned out delicious! I topped it with some slivered almonds.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I love this recipe! Made delicious, sweet, moist bread :) I did make a few changes. To make the recipe vegan I replaced the egg whites with 1/4 cup of dark chocolate almond milk (I also just wanted to add a bit of chocolatey goodness!) and I doubled the cinnamon because I love cinnamon. Very happy with the results.

Followed the suggestions by Snapplemeblue. Overall, this was a solid banana bread recipe considering how much healthier it was than traditional recipes. There was a slight hint of flavor being off - I think maybe a pinch of salt would help. I also had to bake mine much longer than 55 minutes - maybe a reflection of all of the changes I made? It was probably closer to 1:05-1:10. I would definitely make this again.

The only change I made to this recipe was using Stevia instead of regular sugar. The bread was very good. I was happy to find this recipe to make for my mom who is on a medically required no salt, no fat diet. She & my dad are enjoying this bread.

It's only been out for a little while. So all I can say is that it's OK when warm. My family seemed to enjoy it though, so I might just have to update this later on.

3 bananas instead of 2, added 1/8 tsp salt, used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup stevia, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites, upped applesauce to 1/3 cup, added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract.

Sooooo good! Can't wait for a few of the next batch of bananas to go past their prime!

I used one egg rather than two egg whites and increased the applesauce to one third cup and added a cup of raisins. Every one absolutely loves this Banana Bread.

My wife is allergic to apples, so I used a pureed pear, turned out very moist, I would have never known there wasn't butter in this recipe.  As a bonus, it was super easy to make, as a rookie, I had the batter mixed before the oven was ready.

Made it today by doubling the recipe and the kids almost ate the whole first loaf. Here were my modifications: 1/2 cup of sugar, added 1tsp  vanilla and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and substituted 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat flour. Next time I may add a bit of chocolate chips. It was moist and delicious!

I can't give it 5 stars because the recipe is missing some details. Don't forget 1/2 tsp salt. Mix the dry ingredients nd the wet ingredients (incl. sugr) seperatlely then stir the wet into the dry until just combined. I cut the sugr down to 1 cup; I also used 1 egg instead of 2 whites but that was just because I didn't want to waste an egg. I don't believe these changes had  great overall effect on the quality of the cake. 

The result was delicious.

Doubled applesauce, added nutmeg and walnuts, and I also reduced the sugar to half cup. It makes a moist, dense banana bread, which is my favorite kind. I love this recipe!

Turned out moist! I only used 1 tablespoon of organic coconut sugar, half white & half whole wheat flour, upped baking powder by 1/4 teaspoon, added salt, nutmeg & vanilla. I mixed in goji berries, walnuts and chia seed for added superfood nutrition.

I combined suggestions from several others: 1/2 c sugar, four very ripe bananas (small-med size), pumpkin spice + cinnamon, 1/3 c apple sauce, 1 whole egg, 1tsp vanilla, replaced half c flour with white unbleached whole wheat, 1/4 tsp salt, had no baking soda so I replaced with extra 1/2 tsp baking powder, added a lovely brown sugar chia seed topping (a little water added to make it a nice drizzle), AND my own addition: one grated zucchini from the garden :D  
Overall great texture great flavor, no complaints!

My husband loves banana bread.  I didn't tell him that this was a low fat recipe.  He loved it!  Even better than my regular recipe.
Sharing the recipe now with my daughter-in-law, sister-in-law and niece. 
Will be waiting for their opinions.

All in all I rate this as okay for a non-fat banana bread. I made the recipe exactly as stated. Having read the other reviews which said it was dry, I shortened the baking time to 45 min. and didn't find it was dry that way.  A split on taste though. I thought it tasted pretty good and like the no fat idea, just wish it was no calories as well. My husband said it was ' only okay' and that something was missing.

I have made a vegan version of this (using a flax egg and some extra baking powder). I also made it into a pumpkin bread, which was delicious. Apple sauce isn't so widely available in the UK so I subbed some soy yoghurt and I cut the sugar to a half a cup (also I only had brown sugar, which gives it a lovely molasses flavour). It wasn't gummy or tough and honestly it didn't even last 24 hours on the counter! I now use this recipe as a base for different loaves (I've also made some yoghurt-lemon chia cake!)

I was very pleased with this bread. I exchanged the two egg whites for one whole egg (I cannot justify tossing the most nutritious part of the egg away!). As per a few other reviewers, I added nutmeg, salt and 3 bananas. Though it isn't quite as low fat as the original recipe, it is still acceptable and delicious!

I've made this bread from this recipe several times now and it always turns out perfectly. I read the reviews and I followed some of the suggestions which were to increase the amount of banana, add 1 egg instead of 2 egg whites, cut the sugar and half, used a third cup of unsweetened applesauce, added vanilla and also some walnuts. The bread is very moist and flavorful and not at all rubbery as some have reviewed. I think the trick is to not over mix the batter.

I have made this many times in the last few weeks. It's saved me during a difficult time of not being able to eat fat. The only change I made at first was to use half whole wheat flour. Today I substituted a grated apple and one banana for the cup of banana and applesauce. The batter looked a bit dry so I added a couple tablespoons of applesauce as well. Brown sugar and cinnamon on top. Extra yummy!

I had a hand of very brown bananas to use up so I doubled the batch & made two loaves today.  I am disappointed overall - shoulda stuck with Nana's Full-o-fat Recipe.  I used homemade applesauce and followed everything else to the letter.  I ended up having to cover w/ foil half-way through and they still got darker than my usual bread.  My son and I taste-tested while they were slightly warm and fresh - the bread is super dense, still moist but rubbery texture almost, and lacks flavor.  I've enjoyed a dozen BB recipes more than this one - but this one is easy to put together quickly and will be fine for breakfast when we don't want something overly sweet.

Added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp cardamom.  Cut sugar to 1/2 cup because bananas were super ripe.  Also added 1/2 cup walnuts hand-crushed.  Next time more nuts!  Maybe pineapple.  Happy to find a cholesterol friendly recipe.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! I've made it several times and passed it on to friends and family.  I omit the egg whites and add about 6oz of low fat vanilla greek yogurt. It turns out moist and flavorful every time. This is the only banana bread recipe I use now. Try it you won't be disappointed!!!

I am rating this recipe after making it as directed. Any banana flavor was overpowered by the amount of sugar and the texture was rubbery. Sorry - I wanted to like this, but it's just not what appeals to me.

Try this recipe!  I have made this several times now, always slightly different, and it's always yummy!  I usually do a mix of white and wheat flour, as well as a mix of sugars/sugar substitute.  My most recent one was actually a Strawberry Bread variant, and it was great too!  It required me to about double the egg and applesauce due to the lack of moisture you normally get from the banana, and I would recommend decreasing the sugar to about 1/2 cup.  Just try this recipe, and make it how you want it!

This is my go-to banana bread recipe.  I make the recipe exactly as it is written and then divide it into 12 muffins.  (Each muffin is only 2 (old) Weight Watcher points - BONUS!!) Sometimes I put chocolate chips on the tops.  My 3-year-old LOVES these and so do the rest of us!

I loved it! Used 3/4 C whole wheat flour and 1/2 c oats instead of regular flour, halved the applesauce and egg, and added walnuts. Turned out wonderfully! Didn't have baking powder so I just used 1 1/2 tsp baking soda. Also didn't have just cinnamon so I used pumpkin pie spice in its place with a dash of ginger. I used a minimal amount of truvia instead of sugar and topped it with an almond greek yogurt frosting!

I have to say this is a great banana bread recipe.  I thought about adding a little oil, but I am glad I didn't.  Usually, my "healthy" banana bread recipes taste healthy.  This one tastes moist and full of banana flavor!  Give it a try.
I made a few changes, as per prior reviews and personal preference:
3.5 bananas, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 2/3 cup white sugar, 1 cup whole wheat sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup oatmeal, omitted cinammon

I was impressed to the recipe did not include any oil or butter so I thought I would give it a try.. I doubled the recipe and used three egg whites plus one whole egg and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also added a tablespoon of apple butter since my applesauce was unsweetened. It turned out well and was very moist and not rubbery in texture. I would make it again although I do prefer my regular full fat recipe!

Loved it was some slight modifications. Being that I'm a bypass patient, I changed a few/added ingredients:  whole wheat flour, Splenda instead of sugar and added one cup of raisins and 3/4 cup of sliced almonds. Took another's reviews and also added nutmeg, vanilla extract, extra cinnamon and extra baking soda. Increased apple sauce to 1.5 cups... Delicious! (I made a double batch!) my new favorite desert!

Followed advice from reviews and made the following changes, used white whole wheat flour, 1 full egg, 2 large bananas, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp of salt and did not over mix batter (by hand).  Then baked for 50 minutes.  Kids loved it just as much as the last recipe I made with bread flour and real butter.  I think nuts would be delicious, but my kids don't do nuts in bread, just yet.  :-)

This is my first time substituting oil with applesauce. I mede mine as muffins as I don't have a loaf pan and they were ok/pretty good. The taste is difinitley compromised (not the same as using oil) but you can feel good about eating something a little better for you. My boyfriend loved them and wants me to make them again which I probably will. Giving this 4 stars because the recipie makes compromises to be healthier, otherwise would probably give it 3 stars.

I followed Snapplemeblue's suggestions and it turned out delicious.  I also added a 1/4 cup of some chopped walnuts.  I would suggest cutting the almond extract to only a 1/2 teaspoon, I love almond extract but I thought it was a little overbearing for this recipe. The recipe as written is a good base, but I think you need to add the extras in order to get a good flavor.

As far as cakes with no fat go this was the bomb, additions were 4 chopped up medjool dates, vanilla and 2 tbs of yoghurt -  fat free and omitted quarter of sugar and replaced with 2 tbs golden syrup or molasses. Beautiful!

Definitely delicious! I actually did a variation and added sliced strawberries, and had to cook an additional 5 to 10 minutes since the strawberries add moisture to the bread. Yum!

This was AMAZING. The only change I made was instead of a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon i used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (all recipes that ask for cinnamon I use pumpkin pie spice, it gives it an amazing depth of flavor). Needless to say my boys will not stop eating it. This is a perfect way to use up mushy bananas.

After reading some of the reviews I also made some suggestions, such as adding an extra banana, cutting the sugar to 1/2 cup, using one whole egg, adding an 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 cup nutmeg (next time I'll cut to 1/4 or even 1/8!!) and 2 tsp vanilla.  It turned out moist and was actually not too bad.  Not my favorite recipe I've tried but a much healthier recipe.

Awesome bread! I made changes  as others suggested, also added my own to jazz it up. Added the 1/2cup sugar, 1 egg, 1tsp vanilla, 3/4tsp cinn., 1/4 tsp all spice, 1/4 cup walnuts, 1/8 tsp salt. I added 1 T oil to make sure it want rubber as my last experience with a different recipe. I fattened this up by topping with chopped walnuts and choc chips. It was definitely worth the extra calories. Can't get enough.

This recipe was pretty good, although I did change it some. I added the zest of one orange and about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. The orange zest added a pop of flavour and the walnuts added that extra crunch. Next time, I will add in more cinnamon along with some vanilla and some nutmeg, but will also choose to reduce the amount of sugar that I put into it. Overall, it was a pretty good recipe though.

DELICIOUS!! My whole family loves it! I added a whole teaspoon of cinnamon and will probably add more next time. Also, I added a  1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and mixed those in at the end.  It only took about 40 minutes to bake though. Will DEFINETLY make again

Did not like this very much. Maybe bc its low in fat or the fact that I added nutmeg and cinnamon. I'll be trying a different recipe for my next loaf.

Loved it. Made a couple of changes. Little less sugar. Full teaspoon cinnamon. I used 2 egg whites and a third full egg.  Only had one banana which added up to a half a cup so I upped the applesauce to 3/4 cup and it turned out great.

Soo I am rating this even thought I totally changed it into Pumpkin bread muffins. I swapped out the banna for pumpkin.  

Upped the cinnamon to 1 Tsp
Add 1/2 Tsp All spice
added 1/2 Tsp Nutmeg 
Added 2 Tbls of brown sugar

Baked at 350 for 25 min and topped with a little homemade cream cheese icing .

Excellent made it with Apple Butter instead of Apple Sauce (as I was out of AS), replaced the sugar with Splenda and added 1/4 cup walnuts. Everyone loved it period! Thanks for the great recipe.

I have made this several times now and have enjoyed it each time.  Great recipe!!  I added a bit more banana, not for any other reason than I love the flavour.

I really love this recipe. I took the advice of another reviewer and added 3 bananas, but the bread came out a little gooey. I did add jumbo mixed raisin - so yummy. I will definitely try this recipe again but with only 1 cup of banana, as the recipe calls for.

I thought this was a great recipe!  I tweeked it a bit like others have.  I added a tsp. of vanilla, 1/4 tsp. salt, one whole egg instead of the egg whites. I also sprinkled a little brown sugar on top.  Next time I may try adding a small amount of nuts.

As others suggested, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp salt, and 3/4 tsp vanilla for extra flavor. Used 4 bananas, and upped applesauce to 1/3 cup. Very moist and flavorful. Only complaint was crust is slightly chewy.

Very delicious...I made mine into muffins instead of a whole loaf. I took others suggestions and added vanilla and salt. I also added a lot more cinnamon and chocolate chips (which kinda defeats the purpose of almost no fat) but they were great.

I love banana bread and this is so good!  I replaced the white flour with wheat flour and used 1 whole egg and 1 egg white.  I also added vanilla as others suggested and some chopped walnuts as well.  What a great healthy version of banana bread!

I was looking for a low cholesterol recipe and hit the jackpot on this one.  I used one of those single serve applesauces.  I did add a lttle water to get the batter going because I didn't want to over work it.  Flavor and texture is awesome!  What a healthy treat!

I'm living in Japan so I was worried I had to make too many alterations, but it turned out great! I made the applesauce from scratch since there isn't applesauce here, then I used a square pan instead. I dusted the top with sugar and cinnamon and it baked in about 20 minutes. It looks like a dream and tastes nice and moist, which might be from the cake-like shape it has. I'll definitely make this again!  Added 1 tsp salt, 1/3 cup nuts, and baked in a 6x6 inch pan or so for 15-20 minutes.

I am only giving this 4 stars because I changed the recipe. I used whole wheat flour for half the amount of flour. Added a tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp of salt, 1 tsp cinnamon and used some brown sugar in place of the white sugar. I used two different bowls one for wet items and another with dry items then combined them. My recipe turned out awesome! So moist and not chewy like at all.  Everyone loved it!

This bread is deliciously moist, and even better the next day. It's also a healthier alternative to quick breads made with oil and whole eggs. Next time I'll have to try it with wheat flour!

My first experience baking banana bread.  I added all the additions as the last reviewer, except I used this stone-ground all natural wheat flour, which was my misstep I believe.  Otherwise it tasted very moist and flavorful.   Just use normal flour like the recipe says and you'll be fine!

I love this recipe because my husband (who is supposed to be on a low fat diet) devoured this bread!  I made a few changes, like some other cooks suggested, and added some cinnamon and vanilla.  I also added a handful of chocolate chips and some chopped walnuts.  My personal touch to every loaf of banana bread I make, is to freeze nasty old bananas, then thaw them for the bread.  The bananas may look disgusting, but because of the freezer, they mash really easily, and have a nice strong flavor.  :)

I followed this recipe and used 3 bananas, I liked that it had minimal ingredients which I had on hand. It was pretty good for something with minimal fat, just a little on the rubbery side but it was still okay.. I made this into 12 muffins and i sprinkled some banana nut cheerios on the top of each muffin to add some crunch. I would make this again if I ever need to use up some ripe bananas next time.

I followed this recipe, made it a double batch--one loaf and one in a cupcake tin. The cupcakes only cooked for about 20 minutes.  I added shredded coconut and some mixed dried fruit to the mix, and decorated the top with apple slices and pecans.  DELISH.

I thought this was the best banana bread I ever had! Crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside. The recipie calls for egg whites, but I used the whole egg instead. It was not hard to prepare, and well worth the little time it took to make!

Made as is (but with less sugar), I didn't like this recipe at all.  It could definitely use more banana and maybe just a touch of oil to get rid of that rubbery texture.  If I make this recipe again, I'll definitely be trying some of the suggestions as is.

I followed some of the tips, nutmeg instead of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of salt. I also used unsweetened strawberry kiwi apple sauce since that's all I had and whole wheat flour. Turned out fantastic!!

This banana bread was moist and yummy!  It made my house smell amazing as it baked.  I only made a couple of small revisions.  I had some homemade cinnamon applesauce in the fridge, so I used it for the applesauce and omitted the extra cinnamon.  Also because of its sweetness, I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Used one egg in place of two egg whites.  I think that is about it.  I'm always looking for a good banana bread recipe that isn't dry.  This one was great!

On it face, it seemed to make a tasty and guilt-free snack. I followed the recipe as it is. It smelled good but its moist did not last once it cooled off. It became hard and "rubbery". Would like to find out what went wrong.

healthy version with oat and couple of other changes.  1 cup flour with 1/2 cup oats.  1/2 tsp. nutmeg. also three bananas, 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of regular.  I also separate the wet and dry ingredients.  to top it off i combine 1/8 cup of brown sugar with chopped pecans and butter melted by far the best part, makes a sweet topping everyone that has tried it has loved this part!

For a low fat baked treat, this is really good....and I didn't even have enough bananas!!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and threw in a tbsp. of vital wheat gluten flour and a whole individual cup of applesauce (which is about 1/2 cup).  I upped the cinnamon, used some nutmeg.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  This is a keeper!

Flavor was good, but the texture was rubbery.  I know this can be a problem for breads made without fat.  Buttermilk is often a useful substitute for up to half the desired amount of applesauce when baking, especially when oil serves as the only source of liquid (which I suspect it would be in the fattening version of this bread).  I plan to try this change next time.

We think these are great!  We added a bit of vanilla for more flavor, but they are delicious (I say they as we made them into muffins, no bread pan at home to make it in!).  Great for a low fat treat!

Great low fat version!  Following others, I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, upped the homemade no sugar added applesauce to 1/3 cup, used three bananas, and some walnuts.  It came out great and very moist!  A winner!

I have been using this recipe for almost 5 years and love it. Most of the time I follow it exactly as it is written, although I occasionally will add vanilla and nutmeg as well. Never had a problem with it. It is a very dense bread and is great for breakfast with a cup of coffee. Out of all of the banana bread recipes I have tried, this is my favorite because it is delicious, and healthier for you than your average banana loaf. 5 stars!

I actually used 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar (which equates to 1/2 cup), a humped 1/4 cup of white sugar, eyeballed about a 1/4 tspn nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of salt, used 1 egg instead of whites, 2 bananas, and self rising flour so I omitted baking soda and powder.Very good.. not rubbery at all.

This recipe makes 3 mini loaves, and I bake them for about 25 min.  I've made this banana bread a few times and really like it.  I make minor changes by adding some salt, vanilla, walnuts, and some baking spice blend (in addition to the cinnamon).  Great recipe!

Overall this was pretty good.  I made muffins instead of a loaf. After reading others suggestions, I added a tsp of vanilla, tsp of cinnamon .5 tsp of salt, and a brown sugar and water mix to the top of muffins.  I mixed the dry and wet ingredients seperately first, and then blended only until the dry mix was incorporated.  The muffins came out a little heavier and more moist than I would have liked, but I think this is because of the applesauce.   Overall this is a great low-fat alternative to traditional banana bread!

This was not very good.  I substituted plain yogurt for applesauce, maybe that is why it was not so good & turned out flat.

The BEST low fat(in this case, extremely) banana bread ever! They were just out of this world moist and the banana aroma was irresistible. Taking account of other people's reviews, i made the following changes: 3/4 white flour, 3/4 whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup splenda(my bananas were ripe to the max), 1/3 cup applesauce, 1 whole egg, 1/4 tsp vanilla and salt, and I used 4 bananas (size ranging from medium to large). I will use this recipe again and again! This beats ALL other low fat banana bread recipes. others still have oil in them but they're not even half as good! Thank you sooo much for this great recipe! I'm planning to throw my other banana recipes out!

This was pretty yummy. For being low fat I don't think it had much difference in texture like other reviewers had mentioned. I cooked for as long as recommended by my edges were crisp and the middle fell flat. Other than that it had great flavor with the additions of vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I will make this again.

For a almost no fat banana bread this was VERY good. I lessen the sugar to 1/2 cup, increased cinnamon to 1 1/2 t. and added some vanilla.  I made into 12 muffins instead, and it took 20 min. to cook. I will definitly make again. A great way to use up over ripe bananas and have a healthy snack!

This is a great banana bread!  I used three bananas and 1/2 cup applesause, then added 1/4 cup flax meal, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup vanilla flavored protein mix.  This is great for breakfast and so healthy! You don't miss the oil at all.

Good for being low in fat, but it's not the best. It needs more flavor.  My daughter likes it so that is a plus.  I will make again, but I will add more spices and vanilla. I think this would be good as banana bread french toast.

I have been using another banana bread recipe from AR, and I love it! But I'm trying to lose weight, and just can't eat it anymore! So I came across this one, and finally decided to make it eventhough it had mixed reviews. I'm so glad I did, because it turned out wonderful! Just like everyone already said, don't over mix it. I added an extra banana and a little vanilla, and I'm thrilled with the outcome. I can't believe I'm going to say this but I may even reduce the sugar a bit next time! For those of you who are skeptical, don't be afraid to try this one =)

I appreciate this recipe because of the recent changes I have made to my diet. Every now and then, I still want something sweet. So, I can have this and not feel too guilty. I substitute Splenda for sugar with no problems for fewer calories.

Post Edit:
I made this again today (Jan 22, 2010) and made a few changes that really improved this. The first time I made this, I liked it, but it was a bit rubbery and dry. This time I added one more banana which made 1 1/2 cups mashed banana, and I added 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the 1/4 cup the recipe called for. I also had a leftover brown sugar/cinnamon mixture that I had used for something else which I sprinkled sparingly over the top which made for a yummy crust. My bread this time was moist and delicious with a perfect crust!

first time ever trying to make banana bread and it turned out great! i followed everybody's suggestions of vanilla and cinnamon, 1 whole egg. i added oatmeal and next time, will only put in 1/4 cup of sugar. i put 1/2 cup in but it was still too sweet for me. i dont even want to try any other banana bread recipe. so moist and delicious!

Absolutely delicious!!! I can't believe there is no oil or butter in it! I have no reason to make banana bread with oil in it anymore!! I guess I made a bunch of changes though, like alot of others. Used less sugar, added nutmeg, added salt, used the whole egg, used 3 bananas (didn't measure), used more applesauce, added vanilla and walnuts. Amazing.

I use this recipe almost every week. I've picked up jars of baby food (applesauce, blueberries, pears, peaches, etc) to add to this in place of the applesauce. I've also added a 1/4 cup of flax meal to increase the nutritional benefit for my kiddos.

I made no changes to the recipe and was very disappointed. Very rubbery and no taste.

It was edible, at best. Rubbery, not sweet enough (unless we're supposed to use a sweetened applesauce), absolutely bland, even with addition of 1 tsp of good vanilla extract and some salt, as recommended by others.  Sure, if you add nuts, raisins, apples, more applesauce and what's not, it might be better, but then it would be a completely different recipe.

I thought this was very good the only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  The bread wasn't quite as moist as the recipe I usually make but it was moist enough.

This was very tasty! My fiance and I both loved it and I will definitely be making it again :)  I changed the recipe slightly, using 2tsp of ground cinnamon, one egg, 1/2 cup apple sauce, 4 bananas, 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup walnuts, 1tsp of pumpkin spice, 1tsp vanilla, 1/2tsp salt, dash of honey, then I let it cool for about 10mins before serving.

A great way to get a little sweet treat in when you're watching what you're eating. A little rubbery for me but it was a big hit with my husband and the kids.  I made them in a muffin pan and it was perfect for serving the kids.  I added vanilla and increased the applesauce to 1/3 of a cup.  Thanks for sharing.

Very, very good - with a little tweaking as good as the higher fat banana breads I've made from this site.  I used 1 cup white and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. added a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Used 3 medium, very ripe bananas and the bread turned out really moist and perfectly sweetened. Note: for those who said it turned out rubbery... you over stirred.

EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ALMOST NO FAT, I STILL EXPECTED IT TO BE BETTER THAN IT WAS. I DID MAKE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECIPE AS SUGGESTED BY OTHER REVIEWS. I DON,T THINK I WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN.

This is just fabulous!  I altered the recipe a little by adding about 1-2 tbs cinnamon, 1/2 cup walnuts, 1 cup craisins, 1 apple diced.  I also baked for 40-50 minutes since I'm using a 9x5 loaf pan.  Our family of four has been eating a whole loaf everyday.

Anyone who likes "real" banana bread will probably  not like this low-fat recipe.  Mine was a tad rubbery.  I did add salt and vanilla and also added a mixture on brown sugar and water sprinkled on the top of it before baking.  That was a nice addition.

I'll be making this again since the first loaf disappeared so fast!  No one could even guess that this was low fat.  I followed the advice of others and added a bit of salt and about a tsp of vanilla, alos upped the cinamon to a full tsp. Next time I will definately add walnuts though.

LOVE it!  I added the salt, vanilla, and a small, chopped apple as recommended by others.  I also used 1/3 cup of apple butter instead of applesauce then sprinkled the top with my Pampered Chef chocolate hazelnut sprinkles. YUM!

The first time I made this recipe to the T.  I added vanilla and nutmeg as recommended as well.  It was a little dry.  The secong time I upped the applesauce and added chopped apple and walnuts and the difference was 10 fold.  The apples add that little bit of extra moisture needed.  All in all a great recipe.

YUM! Made this recipe as muffins and they came out great with a couple of changes/additions that other users suggested: I used whole wheat flour instead of white, 3 bananas, 1/3 c applesauce, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 cup pecans.  I mixed wet and dry ingredients separately and then incorporated them together.  Hard to believe these are healthy!!

I added 1/2 teaspoon salt and a teaspoon vanilla extract. Could have a bit more taste but I think it is due to the bananas I had, not being ripe enough.

This was a good banana bread.  Like the others mentioned, it was a bit dry and the crust was slightly rubbery.  I didn't over mix, and I used two bananas.  I also added extra apple sauce and a pinch of salt and vanilla.  Very easy recipe!

I added 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 tsp. vanilla.  They came out quite yummy, but not nearly enough banana flavor for me.  I recommend upping the banana to 1.5 or even 2 cups (approx. 3-4 bananas).  I also made the recipe as muffins (instead of a loaf), and found that the cooking time was about 18 min.

We love this bread! I've made it several times now through the course of the year and no one can tell it's a low fat recipe. I haven't deviated from the original recipe and it has always come out moist. It's the only banana bread recipe I use now!

This banana bread was extremely easy to make and very yummy!  I'm amazed at how well it turned out in spite of my mistakes and omissions.

Followed previous reviewer's advice to mix dry and wet ingredients separately, before gradually combining the two together until just moist.

Made it with the following changes/mistakes:  1-1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 3 ripe bananas, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 whole egg, 1/3 cup applesauce, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tbsp brown sugar for the topping, no baking soda (because I didn't have any) and overbaked by 15 minutes (because I forgot about it).  It still turned out great!  Well, it was kind of dense, but still very tasty and definitely edible.

I love how healthy it is too.  Next time, I'll make again with baking soda, ground flax seeds (1/4 cup?) and additional applesauce...  We'll see how that one goes!

Subbing applesauce for oil makes this bread so incredibly moist.  Added some chopped pecans and cinnamon per other reviews.  I ate the entire loaf in 48 hrs.

This banana bread is fantastic! I add a little bit more applesauce to make it even more moist and I also add chocolate chips. I have had TONS of people ask me for the recipe and a loaf never stays longer than a day in our house. I even made mini loaves for our out of town guests at our wedding and received rave reviews! It can even be made vegan using no eggs (add more applesauce) and vegan dark chocolate. Great recipe!

If I want to make muffins instead of a loaf of bread, what temperature should I bake them at? If the same temperature as the bread, how long should I bake them for? Oh, and the bread was delicious.

This recipe makes DELICIOUS, moist banana bread.  My family devoured the first loaf in less than 15 minutes. I definitely recommend adding a bit of brown sugar to the top of the loaf.

Yum! This is an awesome low fat recipe! I took some other reviewer's advice and added 1 tsp. almond extract and 1 tsp. vanilla. The crust was a bit "rubbery,"  but I actually enjoyed the texture. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was SO tastey! I did follow some of the reviews though, and added 1/2 tsp salt, upped the cin. to 1tsp and used 3 (very) ripe bananas, and subbed 1 whole egg for the egg white.  My picky family  ate it up so quickly, and definetly could't tell it was low-fat! Thanks!

This was amazing! I followed the recipe almost exactly, and it tastes wonderful. The only small changes I made were to dust the pan with sugar, add an extra 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and a dash of vanilla. I couldn't believe that it had so much less fat but tasted so good. I don't think I'll make regular banana bread again.

I have always wanted use applesauce and bananas in a recipe (they are SO much healthier) instead of oil; but I have been a little hesitant to try. When I made this recipe, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the batter was consistent and did not contain excess flour or other ingredients. And before I go on, these suckers rise very fast, so don’t be disappointed if your muffin tin is not completely full to the top, for within 20 minutes of baking, they are all ready there. They smell so good in the oven; it makes you want to gobble them up before they are even done cooking. These muffins were really good EXCEPT THERE WAS ONE BIG PROBLEM: THE MUFFIN DID NOT COOK ALL OF THE WAY OR SOMETHING BECAUSE WHEN I WENT TO TAKE THE MUFFIN WRAPPER OFF, THE MUFFIN LITERALLY STUCK TO IT, IT WAS LIKE THE ONLY THING YOU COULD EAT WAS THE TOP (unless you wanted to eat the wrapper!)This is how I modified the recipe. Based on other reviews I used only what is listed below:
¾ cup all purpose flour
¼ cup Splenda
1 egg (whole)
2 bananas (medium sized)
1 4oz cup of unsweetened applesauce 
½ tsp of both almond and vanilla extract
½ tsp of baking powder and baking soda
Cinnamon
Nutmeg 

I followed the original recipe and mixed the flour, sugar, baking powder and soda, cinnamon, nutmeg (dash or two of each), and almond and vanilla extract. I then added the bananas, applesauce, and finally the egg. The applesauce work

Very good and moist bread. I did make a couple small adjustments.  I used egg beaters instead of the egg.  I did not have enough banana so I increased the applesauce to compensate.  I forgot to add nuts which I will be sure to remember next time.

This receipe is great! i changed it just a bit by putting one whole egg and one egg white and increasing the applesauce to a half cup.  I made them into muffins and added rolled oats on top for extra crunch and added goodness!

This is really tasty!  I modified it a bit like others by using half all purpose and half whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, used 1/4 cup eggbeaters, and added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1st almond extract, and 1/4 tsp salt.  Came out great!

This is a great recipe. I made a couple of changes based on some other reviewers--substituted brown sugar for white and reduced it to 1/2 a cup; added 1 tsp of vanilla; put in two whole eggs instead of just the whites; and baked it for almost an hour and a half so it was done the whole way through. And it was even better the next day!

This was very easy to make and for an almost no fat bread was pretty good.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup as others suggested and added some rasins.  I also used half white, half wheat flour.  The great thing about this recipe is that my family didn't know it was healthy for them. I will be making this again!

Great consistency! I changed it and made "tropical bread"...1 banana, 1 mango, crushed pineapple, chopped/dried pineapple and mango, flaked coconut, and walnuts.

This is really a great recipe for low fat banana bread. I did add 3 medium bananas, 1 tsp vanilla essence, 1/2 cup of apple sauce, walnuts and use brown sugar instead of white sugar. Everyone loved it but I feel like there was something missing. I think I would add a little more applesauce and try the pumpkin spice suggestion the next time I make it.

this banana bread was so good it was gone b4 I could take a picture!  Made these adjustments no white sugar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1 whole egg and I added crushed pecans as my husband does not like nuts.  He didn't even know they were there and ate 1/2 the loaf!  My loaf turned out perfect not rubbery at all. This is a great sweet treat if you are trying to lose weight, hopefully the next loaf will last a little longer!

I followed the recipe and then took SNAPPLEMEBLUE's suggestions and it turned out really tasty!  The almond essence added a really nice flavour too.  This was a great low fat substitute when you don't need the calories/fat of banana bread, but want the taste!

I made this bread but used a substitute egg product and it turned out just okay.  It has a good flavor and my family likes it but next time I make this I will just use the egg white and it will probably be better- My fault as I was trying to make it different.  I also added about a tsp of vanilla-

I make this bread all the time.  The only change I make is instead of the 2 egg whites I use 1 whole egg.  The bread is moist and has a heavy texture but that is what I like about it.  Slice it, toast it, and eat!!!  YUMMY!

I substituted Splenda for the sugar and added an extra banana, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. I too got the rubbery crust. It's not bad per se, just a little odd texture-wise. The inside of this loaf is EXTREMELY moist. All in all not a bad recipe, and quite good for being so low in fat.

Very good! I made this into muffins for portion control and they were great! I used 1/2 c. brown sugar, a little more than 1/2 c. applesauce, and added vanilla. They were very moist but a little chewy on the outside! Will definitely make again!

I loved this bread.  I changed it just a bit to suit my tastes and it is by far the best I've ever had.  I used 1/2 white flour, 1/2 wheat flour mix and dropped the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  I also added 1tsp. vanilla and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  
I got lots of raves and will surely make it again!

I have to give this 5 stars because this recipe was so easy.  I used 2 whole eggs because I was lazy, I admit it, and didn't separate the white from the yolk.  I am sure the recipe would have been fine with only the egg whites.  Moist banana bread is oh so good!

This was by far the best banana bread I've ever made.  I got compliments from my family and friends.  Even my three year old who normally refuses banana bread, LOVED it, and it's so healthy.

I took the advice of others and it was great.  I made them in a muffin pan for portion control and they are great!

Hmmm very good. Followed snapplemeblue's advice for changes in the recipe, turned out quite nice. I'm always on the lookout for low fat recipes =) btw: the fat in this recipe is from the nonstick cooking spray; hence the title "almost no fat".

This banana bread was excellent but it needed some additions, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I added a 1/4 tsp of salt, 1 tsp vanilla, and some chopped walnuts.  I also used 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  I used egg beaters instead of egg whites and swapped a 1/4 cup of reg sugar with brown sugar.  This bread was very moist and sweet.  I made 3 mini loaves.  Will definately make again!

Amazing; tastes great, no fat. What more could you ask for in a banana bread? Walnuts, perhaps, but not much else.

I followed suggestions as far as adding nutmeg and vanilla.  HOWEVER I had a baking panic moment when I realized that I had no baking powder and decided to go for it and use all baking soda...turned out ok, actually!  A little chewy, but still had great flavor.  Will definitly make again, this recipe is extremely forgiving!

This was VERY good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Though it doesn't have much of a banana flavor - it's definitely sweet enough...and a great snack for kids!

Surprisingly moist for having no fat.  Needs a butter or frosting spread but otherwise it has a great banana flavor.

I could barely eat this tho it smelled ok baking.  My bananas were very ripe, but it just didn't have much of a banana flavor.  I tried making it again bc of the good reviews, but even my husband (who eats everything) is not a fan.

Wonderfully tasty! I followed advice of many and added 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp. nutmeg + cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I also used 1/3 cup of apple buter instead of applesauce. Enjoy!

This bread was awesome for a no fat bread. The first time I made it the bananas sunk to the bottom of the loaf. So, the second time I mixed the bananas with a few tablespoons of flour which helped the bananas to stay suspended in the mixture while baking. I also used about a 1/4 of a cup of Splenda rather than sugar. It wasn't too sweet...the applesauce and bananas gave the bread a natural sweet flavor.

Makes a great healthy banana bread. I choose to adjust the sugar content to 1/2 cup Splenda blend and 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar blend. I also add a dash of olive oil for baking (for better non-stick ability), I use 1 whole egg and add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. This recipe was a great foundation and I love the results. I make this all the time!

After reading the reviews I added a little bit of milk and some vanilla. Also a little bit extra applesauce. It rose pretty well. For personal interest i added wlanuts and raisins! I found it didnt need to be cooked as long or it would have completely burnt and dried out. For a healthy bread,, has a good taste in my opinion! Thankks! =)

This is the best tasting low fat banana bread I've ever had, and believe me, I've tried quite a few! I might add more banana next time for some extra banana flavor, but that's the only change I'd make.

I'm not going to rate this because I think I beat the mixture too much.  It did not rise very well but the taste was good.  When I make it again, I will also not cook as long as stated because the time seems like way too much.  It is a very dense bread.

I also thought that this bread was a little tough on the edges and moist inside.  It did not have too much flavor so next time I will add some vanilla and some nutmeg. Pretty good for a low fat snack!

I thought it was a little chewey.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour, maybe that was too much.  The taste was good though and my children liked it.  I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

I THINK THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT. I HAVE MADE IT THREE TIMES, AND EACH TIME MY FAMILY ATE IT PRETTY QUICKLY. THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS TO NOT BAKE IT FOR SO LONG. THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE CRAZY TO SAY THAT IT IS A HORRIBLE RECIPE.

Just made this recipe this morning with what I had on hand -- I had to adjust the recipe slightly.  I used half all-purpose flour and half wheat flour, only one egg though whole, added some nutmeg and vanilla, cut the surgar in half and used homemade applesauce.  I've never had better.  I love the applesauce in the bread and plan try it in place of oil or butter in many other bread/cake recipes.

These were excellent!!! I made muffins instead of bread, and you cant even tell they were low fat. I didnt have applesauce so I used the large jar of banana baby food and about tbls. of canola oil.  I will definately made these again, not only were they a healthy snack for me but I dont feel guilty feeding them to my 11 month old either.

very easy to make; moist and dense bread.  scale back on the sugar for a less sweet taste, if you prefer.

This is a good basic recipe, although I have had better, but only because this is a lower fat version. For low fat, it was pretty good, and my children love it. Although, I added 2 extra TB's of applesauce, whole eggs (rather than whites), and I added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon which gave it a wonderful flavor. All in all, for a low fat version, I give this recipe a B+. To ease the dryness on top, I just cooled down to warm on a wire rack, and wrapped in foil. The next morning, it was just fine.

Although I did change the recipe by preparing this will bread flour, adding 1/4 cup walnut pieces and cooking it in a bread machine I can't imagine that should cause too much of a change in taste from the original recipe.  

To be honest I thought this tasted like a thick brick without much flavor.  Even when served warm with a little butter to soften the texture this is not an appetizing bread.  This is not a successful "low fat" recipe and I would not make it again.

This was very easy and quick to make.  It turned out really good with the exception of the outside being too crusty and the inside a little too gummy, but the flavor is awesome!  My very picky 8 year old loved it!

This bread has a different texture to it - more chewy. For low fat, it was amazing! The cinnamon gives it a nice flavor too.

I really like this bread!  I froze it and it still tasted excellent after I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds.  This is a superb recipe for "Calorie and Fat Conscious" people like me!!  Being as moist as it is, my family did not believe that it was low in fat.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and it tasted just as good. It is now a family favorite and I am happy because it is better for our health!

Mmmm, banana bread. This recipe is one of the best that I have ever had. And low fat to boot! Very good toasted. I like it spread with a little peanut butter. It freezes well too. I keep some frozen so I can pop a slice in the toaster for a quick (And healthy) dessert or snack. It would also be good with some chocolate chips added, but that might defeat the healthy purpouse of the recipe...

This had a good flavor, and though the crust was chewy, it was a nice texture with the softness of the bread itself.  This recipe is a nice update on the classic that is in most of my cookbooks--very yummy despite the low-fat factor!

Very easy and delicious recipe, not to mention that it does not taste lowfat. Warmed up with a pat of light butter makes for a great breakfast or carry in for work. The aroma of this bread is almost as good as the taste!

This recipe was VERY good!  We increased the measurements to better fill up our 8 x 5 loaf pan, and subsituted Splenda for half of the sugar amount.  Deliciously healthy!

No matter how carefully you mix a muffin with so little fat, it's going to get a little chewy I think. So, although this muffin is a tad chewy, it's still very banana-y and not soggy, as some muffins with fat replacers like applesauce are.

This banana bread was too dense for my liking.  The crust was too tough.  I really liked the idea of adding applesauce though.  I think I like the more traditional banana bread.

Wow-for a "healthy" treat this was delicious! I added 1.5 c banana to give it a richer taste, and I believe that was a key step.  The only reason it didn't recieve 5 stars because it was a tad bit chewy, but considering it has no oil, I could see why this would happen.

I was pleasantly surprised with this banana bread. I took the suggestions to increase the appleasauce and add nutmeg and vanilla. The crust was still a bit chewy, so I might try adding another banana next time. I will also add walnuts next time. This will definitely replace the bakery's banana bread I've been buying. Overall a good, healthy snack.

This was great for low fat!!!! I also reduced calories by using splenda and I also used eggbeaters. I did not have any over ripe bananas and i really wanted to try this today so I used 1 and 3/4 cups sweetened applesauce and no bananas. I also added 1 teas vanilla and increased cinnamon to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons. It took only about 30 min in my oven but I think my loaf pan was a 9X5. Will make again , can't wait to try with bananas as called for but worked great with just the applesauce!! Thanks Allison! Oh one more change I added 1/8 teas salt.

Definetely the only banana bread recipe I'll make from now on. The icing on the cake is the lowfat part. I added walnuts and it was absolutely heavenly. First time I made it it was gone within a day. Now I make 2 loaves at a time, or else muffins. Wish all recipes were this easy and delicious (not to mention lowfat).

This was very easy and delicious. I did use whole eggs though - but only 
because I forgot to seperate them. Next time I may use unsweetened apple 
sauce.

GORGEOUS!
I can't believe this is almost no fat.  It was so quick and so easy, and tasted so good that I had to make a second one straight after!  My husband loves Banana Bread so I know it won't last long when he gets home...that's why I'm off to have my second piece!!!

My family and my boyfriend can't even tell that it is fat-free. Taste GOOD, except that it's a little too sweet --- should reduce sugar added.

This was an excellent recipe and the results were wonderful!  I made two batches for a party and it was a hit amongst my family and friends!  The cinnamon provided a delicious flavor and the 'apple bananas' I used provided sweetness.  I love this recipe and I would definitely use it again!

When I saw "fat free" I almost skipped it, but decided to try it and am glad I did (so are my husband and sons).  Amazing moistness and flavour.  I used less sugar and 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 white flour.  Thanks

My family and I loved this recipe... it was moist and had an excellent flavor. I added a 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts for a little something "extra". This is another recipe I will share with the women at Weight Watchers!

WOW!  This banana bread is a winner!  I made it for my 3-year-old son, but he never got to try it, because my DH and I hoarded it for ourselves. I used sweetened applesauce and added walnuts, but otherwise kept the recipe as is.  Thanks for sharing this treasure with us.

I really appreciated this lowfat banana bread as I am always conscious of the amount of fat I eat.  It tastes great and is extremely moist.

Great recipe. Love the use of applesauce vs. butter/margarine.  I substituted nutmeg for the cinnamon because it's a personal preference, but otherwise, wouldn't change a thing!

This bread was GREAT!  My roommates and I didn't think it tasted fat-free at all.  We added extra bananas and cinnamon than called for and let it bake for about an hour.  It was perfect warm and still moist and chewy the next day.  Yum!

I used whole wheat flour, and added a half cup of walnuts.  It was surprisingly yummy, for how healthy it is!!  My husband and I will be living off this for a while!!

I loved the fact that it used applesauce instead of butter (I used strawberry-apple and even added some mashed strawberries) but I found this recipe to be rather bland and not very sweet.

Very tasty.  You don't miss the butter at all.
