What a wonderful blend of flavors! This recipe has a lot of flavors going on, so it can easily be tinkered with to suit individual tastes. For instance, hubby can't deal with "hot and spicy" so unfortunately I had to leave the hot sauce out.  No matter--since I used brown mustard rather than Creole, I added a little Cajun seasoning, and that really gave this a boost of flavor to make up for not using the hot sauce.  A teaspoon of salt seemed an awful lot to me so I used 1/2 tsp. and it was plenty salty enough. Unlike some others, I did use both the olives as well as the capers, the combination of which was a real flavor sensation!  This was just perfect to serve with "Perfect Crab Cakes with Green Onions," also from this site.

In a word - "awesome"! Yes, for the long list of ingredients it looks like a lot of work for not a lot of pay off, but trust me you'll be glad you tried this especially if you're having really good crab cakes! Just to be on the safe side trying this for the first time I cut the recipe in half. I didn't have Creole mustard, so I used dijon and added 1/4 tsp. of "Cajun Seasoning Mix" from this site. I always have it on hand in a tiny tupperware container along wtih my other spices. I used some Frank's red hot for the hot sauce and also opted to add the capers which was a really good decision. I did however cut the amount of salt in half as the salt from the olives and capers really makes up for it. I let it set in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors come together and boy was it ever good! This is a definite keeper!

Soooo gooood!!  I eye-balled most of the ingredients, used regular mustard and some creole seasoning instead of creole mustard, bottled lemon juice, no salt and after tasting it, thought it needed more spice so I added a good squeeze of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (found with the Asian food at the grocery store).  It was still too chunky for me, so I put it all in a small blender attachment and gave it a whirl.  Next time I won't bother chopping everything and do this from the get go.  It was great the first day but the next day...WOW!  All the flavors melded together and it was just right.  The fish just SCREAMED for it!

Leave out the green olives and salt for a perfect Remoulade that's terrific with any seafood dish.
Thanks for sharing. I'm not sure what other reviewers meant by this being a difficult or time-consuming recipe. In my opinion, the recipe went together quickly and perfectly.

Thought this recipe called for a bit too many ingredients, but I followed it exactly and it was definitely worth the effort. Very tasty indeed! I used it on crab cakes and it was much better than the traditional red pepper sauce that I usually use. Had some leftover sauce that we used with fried shrimp a few days later and that was yummy too! I liked this much better than the remoulade sauces I've had in restaurants! This one's a keeper!!

I've made this recipe several times now and while it is alot of work to put together, the end result is well worth it.  My only gripe would be that it has somewhat of a bitter taste to it (I think from too much creole mustard).  I used all the ingredients but the olives and only about half the amount of salt and Louisiana hot sauce.  I also used capers just because I really like them (about two tablespoons).  To counter the bitter taste of the creole mustard I use only a table spoon and a half of the mustard instead of two and I add some brown sugar to it (five spoonfuls).  It tastes much better this way in my humble opinion.  I would say it is 3 stars without the sugar and 5 stars with it.  Yes the sugar makes a BIG difference!!  I do not make this sauce without it.  This is an excellent recipe and will taste much better than any shrimp sauce that you get at a restaurant.  Enjoy!

This was very good, after I fixed it up some, there was waay too much Creole mustard. And I even put the right amount in, I had to add sugar, more mayo, and some garlic powder, just to prevent the taste from being so strong.

Made this last night with "Lori's Famous Crab Cakes" and what a combination.  My husband said this sauce was better than any restaurants'.  I couldn't find any creole mustard or seasoning so I used the spicy brown mustard as suggested.  We're trying to think of things to make just to use the sauce !!!  Loved it and will definitely make this again.

Thanks for the great recipe!  I left out the green olives because I didn't have any on hand.  I also substituted a little jalapeno for the capers.  Even without the capers and the olives, I discovered that it  didn't need any salt.  One other thing:  It's very spicy if you use Sriracha.  I love spicy food, so it was perfect for me.  Those who aren't into spicy food, though, may want to dial things back a bit.

I loved it so much I'm going to start keeping it on hand... so worth every single ingredient.  It was dangerously close to a remoulade sauce I had at a very upscale restaurant recently.  They served it with crab cakes.  I just like it as a dipping sauce for and white meat or with fish.

If You know Remoulade Sauce this is it.  I followed the recipe exactly. I made a double batch because I knew I would want more throughout the week. I'm in the food business. My clients are the best chefs in the Metro Atlanta Area. I eat alot of food and cook lots of food. I also like to fish. I caught a 10# flat head catfish last weekend at the lake. Flat Heads are the best eating catfish. I thought I need to make this special. So I searched up a new Remoulade Sauce. Trust Me, this recipe is the real deal. I have searched this website for recipe ideas for years. I have never posted a review_ I know I should post my opinion, maybe I'm lazy. I felt compeled to post a review after preparing this recipe. It was that good. Better than the recipe I have been using for 30 years-I grew up on the Gulf Coast.  The great thing about Remoulade Sauce is it's versatile, sandwich spreads, salad dressing, tomatoes and onions. My adult kids love it. I'll stop here. This is good

I followed the recipe as is and it was wonderful.  I have never understood why people rate recipes after they have made changes to render them unrecognizable.  Personally I try to try a recipe once exactly as written and then I can more accurately tell what "might" make it better.

This is very similiar to the remoulade I make, but there are 2 ingredients not listed which are almost essential...cajun seasoning and prepared horseradish...really makes this incredible.

Yowza.  More delicious than I thought it would be.  I like Thousand Island dressing, so I was pretty sure I'd like it, but the family does not.  I made Crab and Shrimp Louis from this site, but replaced the dressing in that recipe with this sauce.  The family RAVED about it.  (kinda freaked me out a little)  This is good stuff!!
UPDATE:  Made this again with the old man's "help."  He added 1 T. of Tabasco instead of Frank's Louisiana Sauce.  WOW!  It was really zippy but incredibly delicious!!  We used most of it on the Shrimp/Crab Louis Salad on AR and the leftover sauce went on Rueben sandwiches.  Can't recommend this stuff highly enough!!

I made this delicious sauce last week to serve with my BIL fantastic crabcakes - a match made in heaven! I  deviated by bumping up the garlic to four cloves, personal preference only. I'd like to try this with deli roast beef or use in a tuna salad. Thanks so much for a real keeper!

I made this to go with the Low Country Boil we were doing. We used it on our red beans & rice, the shrimp, the potatoes, the sausage...YUM! Everyone was raving about this sauce & asking for the recipe! I left out the capers, used brown spicy mustard instead of Creole, added some Creole seasoning & put it all through my food processor to smooth out the chunks. EXCELLENT!!

Excellent! The first time I made this I followed the instructions and it was very good. Since then I have made some small changes by using the original recipe as a base. Try it with pureed avocado or fresh cilantro added into it. It makes an excellent sauce for fish tacos. Thanks CookingCowgirls.

This was awesome!  My boyfriend and I both loved it!  I could not find creole mustard so I used spicey brown and added a bit of creole seasoning.  I also left out the scallions, garlic and celery just because I was in a hurry but threw in a few extra capers and a dash of garlic powder and it was fabulous! Thanks for a great recipe!

The amount of prep work is WELL worth it! Certainly will not find a Remoulade like this in any restaurant. Just a fair warning...the flavors (and heat) gets more intense every day that it sits! :)

Great recipe! I am from New Orleans and never had a remoulade with green olives in it but figured I would try it.  Loved it!  A lot of remoulades are made with horseradish and my husband hates horseradish, so this recipe was great.  Remoulade sauce varies in ingredients and you can adjust for personal tastes (like most New Orleans foods - the recipe is considered a starting place).  :-)  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is an excellent sauce recipe! I made my own chili sauce using the 'Chili Sauce' recipe from here. I did not have creole mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard. I also did not have fresh parsley on hand, so I used some dried. Instead of plain chili powder, I opted to use chipotle chili powder and it gave the sauce a wonderful, smoky/spicy kick that I am loving. I wish I would have had the capers on hand, because I know they would be a wonderful addition, but I'll make sure I have them for next time. I made this to serve with salmon patties for dinner tonight, and I cannot wait to eat because I know this sauce is just gonna take them over the top. I will definately be making this again, and I cannot wait to try this on a fish sandwich~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I didn't use the capers, and didn't notice. I served it with my old bay shrimp and potatoes and had excellent reviews! I threw the rest in with the leftover potatoes, added some sour cream and hard boiled egg, and voila! Excellent potato salad! :)

This is the best remoulade sauce I have ever had - and this is my favorite sauce so I try it everywhere I go.  I added lime juice, too, since I had one on hand.  I also tripled the amount of capers - I love them.  Delicious.

This is perfect and well worth the effort for an authentic New Orleans sauce. I disagree with one reviewer that put the ingredients thru a blender. The finely diced bits give it the proper texture for this recipe. The bursts of flavor from a caper or olive, for example, makes it perfect for seafood. First class all the way!

We topped crab cakes with this. My husband, sister and I think it is delish! I didn't have creole mustard so we used regular mustard and Emeral's Essence.

Absolutely divine remoulade! I followed the recipe exactly and no alterations are needed. Makes quite a lot though so I'll probably make a half recipe next time.

With olives and capers in the recipe a teaspoon of salt is not necessary and I am very happy that I left it out.  I made this recipe because I could not find the remoulade recipe I have used in the past.  I could not find creole mustard anywhere so had to improvise my own with mustard and creole seasoning.  Due to the fact that I did not have the creole mustard called for, and the fact that my husband liked it, I am giving it an additional star.  I will continue to look for my previous recipe, though, which was much more reminiscent of what I have had in New Orleans.

I absolutley loved this sauce...but it still doesn't top my favorite remoulade from a certain restaurant. My husband liked it but said there was something overpowering about it - I think it was the green olives so I may try using less next time. I actually thought the saltiness was great and this tasted so yummy on salmon cakes. Only problem now is we have so much left over I need to find things to eat it with! Throwing out this fresh homemade sauce would be such a waste! Thanks for a lovely remoulade recipe that I can turn to!

This was all it said it was!  Very good.  I took the advice of someone else in a review and used a food processor for the mincing and chopping.  I've been looking for a great remoulade sauce for quite some time.  I have now found it!  Thanks!!!

I am from New Orleans and this recipe is just like the Remoulade Sauce I enjoyed at so many N.O. restaurants. I made it exactly as listed, except that I put the scallions, parsley, olives, celery and garlic in a food processor before I added them to the other ingredients. This gave me a nice, smooth texture.  The sauce was great with crab cakes.

I eyeballed all the spices in this recipe, so I really didn't follow it strictly (also I didn't have celery or mayo and substituted EVOO and a bit of sour cream, instead).  That said, the blend of ingredients made a superb remoulade for my salmon cakes that truly made the dish after tweaking the ratios.  Thanks for the idea!

I made this as a sauce to serve with shrimp cocktail, along with a more traditional sauce, for Thanksgiving and it went over quite well – even got a request for the recipe!!  I made this as directed, although I did tweak it here and there.  I used a little less lemon juice and a little more chili sauce (just to use up the rest in the bottle).  I didn’t see any need for the olive oil and left that out, and I didn’t use the capers.  I’m planning on using the leftovers on some tilapia this weekend!

This recipe is almost identical to one my husband got from a cajun chef aboard an offshore oil rig in 1972.  Leave out the olives and go lighter on the salt and it's perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

The Chili sauce and chili powder make the recipe bitter. If you remove it you will not need to use sugar.

This is fantastic as is (my chili sauce was a hot Asian variety so I didn't need extra heat). I highly recommend  following the recipe first and resisting the temptation to dicker with it, except  for a possible hot sauce adjustment to taste (AFTER you make it). Be prepared: this recipe makes a lot --a big bowlful. Plan on lots of seafood to use it up. The good news is --it's even better the next day.

I made this as an accomapaniment to Louisiana boiled shrimp, just wonderful!  I skipped the olives, but did add chopped capers (love them!).  This definitely has a kick, not for the faint of heart, don't even think about it!  But for those of us who love a punch, and a nice change from traditional cocktail sauce, this is a winner.  Well done!

Yippee Cahyeah!!!!  Holy cow, you cookincowgirls you.  I was looking for something other than the usual cocktail sauce for shrimp and I found it!  Did not have a few items on hand - used grey poupon, didn't have chili sauce or green olives, so I doubled up on the celery and included some finely chopped tender celery leaves.  Chilled it - which is critical to let the flavors blend - and it is really good.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.  This will become a staple at my house. UPDATE APRIL 2015 - made this recipe substituting fat free greek yogurt for the mayo.  Delish!

update, I no longer bother with all the minced veggies, only the minced garlic, it is still very good on crab cakes and a lot less work. 
This was very good, tasting it by itself I was skeptical, it tasted different but on top of crab cakes it works well.  I do wish the type of chili sauce to use was listed, I never know if it's asian chili sauce, mexican or heinz, I went with the heinz. Didn't have creole mustard so used spicy brown along w/some cajun seasoning. Nice change from plain old tarter sauce, thanks!

This was delicious! My guests raved over it and asked for the recipe. Unfortunately I had a hard time finding a couple of the ingredients at the grocery store one was the creole mustard, I improvised and used spicey brown mustard and mixed in some cajun spice, I also thought I had hot sauce but when it came time to make it... oh well.... I put in a tablespoon of horseradish, I also did not use the capers. It was absolutely delicious!!! Can't wait to make it again! My guests used it over my own creation of crab, mayo, cheddar, broccoli and red pepper filled pastry, baked in a mini muffin pan. Thanks cookincowgirls!

This is the best remoulade I've ever had. I've made this recipe 5x or so and it's always a big hit with some grilled shrimp! I sub Dijon for the Creole mustard and skip the olives and capers. I also eyeball the ingredients and taste as I mix. Once you get the right blend and it's almost spicy enough it's good to go. Put it in the fridge for a couple hours the heat will increase 2-4x. Mmmm! Whenever possible I make it the day before needed to allow more time for the flavors to blend and the spice to really come out.

This sauce is amazing!!!  I don't even like mayonnaise...I hate it, actually.  If it came down to dying a slow painful death and eating a tablespoon of mayonnaise I'd have to think about it for a sec, haha.  

But the other abundant flavors in this sauce come together so well that you don't even notice the mayo!  It has the perfect amount of kick.  Not so spicy that your mouth heats up and your lips burn and your nose runs, haha.

This recipe makes a lot more than 6 servings, in my opinion.  I topped off 4 4-ounce pieces of salmon with a generous amount of sauce on each one and there was a ton left over.

I wasn't able to find creole mustard so I used dijon...and I hate olives so I left those out.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as-is.

Delicious over crab cakes.  I didn't have any capers and didn't miss them :)  I halved the recipe and it still makes plenty for 4 people.  Thank you cookincowgirls for posting this, it made my meal :)

Just made this for my Crab Cakes for Super Bowl Sunday. Tastes great will probably be even better tomorrow after the flavors marry. It seems a little runny, I think next time I will reduce the lemon juice and EVOO some. I used Franks Hot Sauce and Bavarian whole grain and Dijon mustard as that is what I had on hand and I also added a heaping TBLS of prepared horseradish. Used half the salt

Great recipe!  I didn't have any chili sauce so I used some cocktail sauce instead - figured since it was for seafood anyhow!  I've never had remoulade sauce before so I couldn't testify as to the authenticity of this recipe, but I will definitely be making this again!

this is a very good recipe!! i omitted the capers and olives (personal preference) and it tastes amazing! i even used it as a dipping sauce for grilled chicken (even better if you mix with ranch) but used the next day for seafood (breaded shrimp, crabcakes, smoked salmon) and it was SO GOOD! i loved it! so easy to make and definately a keeper! thanks for sharing!

This is absolutely out of this world delicious. The only change I made was to add horseradish. Only because I love horseradish, but perfect as written. I'll never use anything else on my seafood. Thanks!

Love it!  Make sure you use Sriracha hot sauce for a wonderful kick.  I added chopped sweet onion, since I didn't have scallions, left out the green olives, and added a little chopped green pepper.  Used regular yellow mustard, since I didn't have Creole mustard, with a bit of Creole seasoning.  Was great on crab cakes!

Worked out perfectly for me!  I had it with crab cakes made with an Old Bay crab cake seasoning packet.  I'm the slowest cook in the world, so I cut down the ingredients to make it more manageable for me.  I omitted the parsley (though I used some dry parsley), olives, celery and capers.  I also didn't have nor could I find Creole mustard, so I used regular French's mustard and some Creole seasoning.  I used a little Sriracha sauce instead of the Louisiana-style hot sauce.  Even with hacking up the recipe this much, it still turned out great!  And I'm throwing out my bottle of store-bought remoulade sauce that tastes mediocre at best.

Made a total variation of this recipe, so I'm leaving a rating just to let you all know that if you have the majority of these ingredients in your pantry, it turns out just fine if a few things are missing.    I wasn't in the mood to assemble so many ingredients after making crab cakes and other side dishes, so I left out quite a bit.  (Here's what I did not add: celery, capers, olive oil, olives)   Subbed spicy brown mustard for Creole mustard.    Added a healthy dash of Old Bay.    Didn't measure anything - just eyeballed it and it was fine.

What a fantastic recipe! I could see using this with not only shrimp, but with crab cakes, salmon cakes, cold lobster or any type of fish for that matter. I left out the olives but I did use the capers which added a nice tang. So good and thank you Cookincowgirls!!

This is the most delicius dip for sea food!  It's great on fried chicken too.  I didn't have Creale Mustard, so I used a combo of spicy brown mustard and dijon with some horseraddish.  I also didn't have the chili sauce so I used Sriracha, yummy, finger licking goodness.  I've made it it with garlic stuffed olives, the good ones that you scoop from the bins and it was even better! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

WOW!  Great seafood sauce recipe!  Since I used what I had on hand, I had to use regular mustard instead of Creole, regular sweet onion instead of the scallions, and some cayenne pepper instead of the hot sauce.  I also left out the green olives and the capers since I didn't have any either.  This still had an awesome flavor even with my necessary changes and omissions!  I'm sure it would be super with all the correct ingredients too.  I did cut the amount of salt, as suggested by several reviewers.  I followed a previous reviewer's advice and just processed it all in my little food processor to save time and effort.

This is the one!  I just finished prepare 3 different recipes I found online.  By far, this one makes the list.  I think the chili sauce instead of ketchup (which most recipes use) is a great idea.  Chili sauce has a better "kick" than ketchup.  U Go Cowgirls!

My husband just came back from Louisiana and he said this is very close to the sauce he had there.  Very good as a sauce and as a spread.  Did add brown sugar as suggested by others for a sweeter taste.

This recipe is AWESOME!  Made it the night before to let all the ingredients' flavors meld.  It wasn't hard to put together at all.  Served it on grilled salmon and bay scallops.  My husband could not stop raving about the remoulade.  This will be made over and over and over, that's for sure!

Outstanding. Used every ingredient. I used with shrimp and crab one night and made some more a few nights later and was xlnt with crab cakes. Worth every minute of preperation. Even just for a sauce. Glad I found this one. Some may want to adjust the hot sauce but to me it was great. I also want to make it as a crab and shrimp louie type salad. Great texture. What else can I say. I loved it! Thanks for sharing!

My Husband said he hated Remoulade sauce.... then I had him try this and he has changed his mind! He loves this and wants it on everything now.

Edit - it is now 2017.  I still make this recipe and still love it.  I've found that I like it better with a little more capers but its still delicious!  Great on salmon, tuna steaks, crab cakes, shrimp and more!

Soooooo good! such a nice accompaniment to fish.  I backed way off of the chili sauce, I didn't want it flaming, so use your own judgement, and it gets hotter as it sits. Really delish, everyone liked it.

I made a few changes, but we really enjoyed this sauce.  I served it as a spread for shrimp po'boys and it was perfect!  I was out of chili sauce, so I used ketchup that I spiced up a bit with  garlic powder and minced onion.  I also left the mustard out all together.  I used only a splash of olive oil, rather than the full amount called for and I left out the olives and the capers.  Perfect!  I think it would be good for crab cakes and shrimp cocktail as well and I will definitely make this again!

Was Really good- made this to go with cocktail shrimp and we ended up using it as dressing on the salad too.

This Remoulade Sauce recipe is the best!  At first I was skeptical about using every ingredient but I took a chance.  I used every one except for the capers and it was DELICIOUS!!  From now on, it is a must have to go along with all of our seafood.  Thank you!!!

This was delicious.
I couldn't find creole mustard so I made my own using whole grain mustard, hot sauce & minced onion.
Also I left out the olives and capers since I was using this for oyster po' boys.

All I tasted was onion, olives, capers and the chili powder.  Too salty and oniony.  No one at home uses these ingredients!

Yummy!  Made as written, leaving out the capers.  Poured it over boiled and peeled shrimp and marinated them a couple of hours.  Served it over lettuce.

I am from New Orleans and this is similar to Leah Chase's.

So wonderful!  I used this as a dipping sauce for oven-baked zucchini fries, and it was scrumptious.  I used Sriracha for the chili sauce and low-fat Helman's Mayo.  My dad, who hates low-fat anything, couldn't tell the difference.  I also omitted the oil, olives, and salt due to personal preference.

The recipe looked a bit overwhelming at first but I dutifully gathered all ingredients and set forth. What a reward! It was all I could do not to eat it straight with a spoon, but I managed to use it with my shrimp only. I'll definitely use this again, and will proudly serve it to guests.

I LOVE this sauce! I added a t. of horseradish and Dijon mustard since I didn't have creole. The only green olives I had were stuffed with blue cheese, but it totally worked! Served with Maryland crab cakes. Definitely a recipe that I will make again and again. :)

Followed the recipe but be careful if you use the green olives.  They can overpower the other flavors.  Used Dijon and tone ground mustard

This is a wonderful recipe!  I prepared it as written, leaving out only the olives since I didn't have any.  I served it with Chef John's Crab Cakes, also from this site.  Couldn't have been any better!  My daughter liked it so much, she ate it on a hamburger!

I must say leaving out the salt or the green olives would mean that you no longer have a authentic creole remoulade. That being said if you have high blood pressure lowering the salt is not a bad Idea.

I didn't use the celery because my husband hates raw celery.  He lived near New Orleans for three years, and he said this was the best remoulade sauce he's EVER eaten!  It was very easy to make, too!

Kept out the olives and celery, and didnt have the Creole mustard so I used regular yellow mustard with about a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper mixed in. Didnt really know what Creole mustard tastes like, but I figure it had to be spicy.  Turned out awesome. Had it with Fried Green tomatoes, and when I turned around my wifes cousin was licking the rest of the sauce up with her finger, needless to say she wanted the recipe.Great with fish tacos also.

Not hot enough! This recipe needs some horseradish, so add some hot mustard or some straight up horseradish. It was wonderful, other than that. I used it at my Mardi Gras party by making a pretty tray full of peeled, boiled shrimp, and dumped the sauce on top, garnished with some olives and tomatoes, and let the good times roll. Yum.

This one is really good! I love it! There are so many variations to making a remoulade, but this one is the most authentic when you need a good Cajun dipping sauce. I wouldn't change a thing! It's also good for dipping wings  These flavors really jazz things up!

Great flavour!  I used minced onions instead of scallions, and dijon mustard as we don't have cajun mustard available here.  Served it over blackened tilapia on ciabiatta bread.  My family adored it! Thanks.

So yummy! I agree with some other commenters that it was pretty salty (between the olives and the capers and the worcestershire), so I leave the teaspoon of straight salt out. Fantastic with Zucchini Crab Cakes.

I have had several versions of Remoulade sauce and this is definately the best. You can complain that alot of work goes into making it, but this sauce requires all fresh ingredients in order to truly appreciate how spectacular it is. This is great with hard boiled eggs, shrimp, chicken, you name it!

This was excellent.  Didn't have the chili sauce, so substituted the Sririchi (however you spell it) that someone else used (gave it a nice, subtle heat at the end), and followed someone else's advice about just putting it all in the food processor together.  Came out perfectly.

I made this to accompany fried shrimp sandwiches and a corn/crab chowder. It was excellent on the sandwiches and added fantastic flavor. I would recommend this sauce to anyone looking to jazz up a shrimp meal.

Used asian type of chili sauce and left the recipe as is (minus olives and salt) - it was excellent. I was looking for something like what they serve at Outback Steakhouse and this was pretty close. Loved it! Eating it with Crab Cakes tonight.

I didn't add the olives or capers and I still thought this was far too salty tasting.  I didn't enjoy this remoulade sauce at all.  I thought the chili powder was odd tasting on the crab cakes I served this with.  I had to scrape mine off, this recipe didn't do it for me.

Sorry but this was really bad. We served it with crab and lobster cakes. We have had Remoulade served with crab cakes out at different places and were really looking forward to making it ourselves. This was nothing close to anything we have had out.

This is now a staple condiment in our fridge.  I’ve tried to find a remoulade that compares to one I had years ago in Alabama and this one blew it out of the park!  Perfect for any seafood.

We made this to serve with crab cakes. It was delicious, we loved that it had some heat to it. Makes a ton though so I guess I will have to find some more seafood dishes to use it up. Thanks for a keeper!

I used 1/4 cup sriracha in place of chili sauce and hot sauce and skipped the capers. I put all but the mayo in my mini chopper, and then whisked in the mayo, which made it real easy.  Delicious! Great with fried green tomatoes as well as seafood.

Fantastic recipe! The only thing I altered was reducing the salt. I would recommend omitting it until the end and adding according to taste. Otherwise this recipe is perfect! I serve it with a low country boil or steamed shrimp. YUM!

Wow, this was good. I wound up making a few adjustments for texture reasons. I doubled the capers because I really like capers and I left out the olive oil and lemon juice because it already seemed saucy enough, and I left out the salt because I didn't rinse either the olives or the capers, but I kept all the other additions. This is definitely going to replace mayo when I make sandwiches.

Surprisingly good! I didn't have Chile Sauce, so I used regular ketchup. I added a bit more of the capers, but omitted the salt. It was a big hit as a dip for shrimp.

We thought it was delicious!  As my family doesn't enjoy the chunks of celery & onion, I used a stick hand blender and blended the sauce.  It gets more delicious as it chills in the refrigerator.  It's great on crab cakes, baked catfish and even as a dipping  sauce for steamed artichokes.

You can make this spicy hot, or not,  or somewhere in between. I halfed all spicy ingredients and it was still quite hot. Delicious  addition to shrimp. No salt needed in the spicing of the shrimp. I used butter, garlic, white wine, and pepper and sautéed them.

Did not find Cajun mustard so added Cajun spice. When we first made the sauce we were unimpressed. But as the tastes melded it turned delicious.

I have never made this version, but it sounds delish! I have family on the North Shore and I've loved remoulade since the first time I tried it. Only one addition: you forgot to add how wonderful it is onfried pickles and fried green beans! Laissez les bon temps roulez!

Delicious!  This recipe is a keeper!  I served this with boiled shrimp for my Advent by Candlelight event at church.  It was a huge hit.  I omitted the capers, because I didn't have any on hand.  I used regular mustard and one teaspoon of Cajun seasoning instead of the Creole mustard.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a fantastic remoulade sauce (not to be confused with the Southern regional favorite that originated in Jackson, Mississippi, Comeback Sauce. :) ) Wonderfully rich and full of flavor! I wouldn't change a thing about it. It does call for a number of ingredients, but it's absolutely worth the effort. Add the salt last, after tasting, as the olives and capers may make it salty enough for some tastes.

Perfect. Used spicy brown mustard, skipped the scallions, olives, and capers. Put all other ingredients in the food processor - didn't bother chopping the parsley, celery or garlic. Gave it a whirl for about 20 seconds. Getting all the stuff out took the most time!

This is an excellent recipe.  I let the flavors blend in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before serving and it was really good with my crab cakes.  Thanks for a great remoulade sauce!

I just finished making this and it is amazingly delicious. I used the capers and olives, they are a perfect compliment to all the other ingredients. The only thing I did differently was to omit the salt entirely - I forgot, it was a happy accident. Thank you!

KABOOM! This was a fantastic sauce for crab cakes! I, like some of the others, did not have creole mustard and used stone ground mustard instead. It was a hit and I will definitely make this again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Wow. Made this a couple days ago and it's still a hit. Doubled all the green items and chili sauce and it's the best roumelade I've ever made. If it sits a day, it's even better.

I liked it but don't think I would bother again. I don't know why it is called a Remoulade, because apart from the mayonnaise, mustard and capers, it has nothing in common with the original.

I am laughing so hard right now - I used sriracha for the chili sauce as it is what I had - kalamata olives because it was what I had  - everything else exact to the recipe.  My wife can't stop eating it as a dip on chips (which was not the intended purpose), and my 18-month old son keeps plowing chips dipped in it, coughing now and then because of the sriracha and hot sauce but continually going back for more.  Using it to dip with buttermilk-cornmeal fried catfish.  Delicious for all of us!!!  (it IS remoulade....it is meant to be spicy).

I love this recipe and have made it multiple times. I don't keep capers on hand so sometimes I use them and sometimes I don't.  I also do not have Creole mustard so I substitute regular mustard with creole seasoning.  I could just eat it with a spoon!  We use it on the Chicken Crabless Cakes, Zucchini Cakes, fish, and salmon.  Fabulous! As good as any restaurant sauce.

Agreed with another reviewer that I initially thought this recipe had too many ingredients.  However upon inspection they are all ordinary and easily obtained.  The finished product was delicious... I can't wait to have crabcakes again, just to enjoy this sauce.  Yummy!

Love this recipe.!!! I made a few changes to accommodate what I had on hand at the time. Instead of celery, scallions, Worcestershire, and garlic I used celery powder, onion powder, red wine vinegar, and garlic powder. I used it as a sandwich spread and a dip. This sauce will be a new staple for me for sure.

I use this sauce for po'boy sandwiches. I tried them when I was in New Orleans and this is the recipe that is closest to the taste of the sauce that goes into the sandwich. My family also loves it... :)

I have tried many versions of remoulade and had not found one I loved until this one. I served it with crab cakes for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Now I just need to find other recipes to use it with!

Very tasty sauce I used for crab cakes (for 2 people).  Made 1/2 the recipe.  Omitted the celery, capers and olives, and used Dijon mustard in place of the creole mustard.  Just the right amount of heat.

Very flavorful, with a kick!  It did have a lot of ingredients, but went together quickly. I cut the recipe for 4 servings and it was much more than I'd make in the future. I took several of the suggestions, including putting it all in a food processor to begin with, using Dijon mustard and 1/4 tsp of Creole seasoning instead of the Creole mustard and using only 1/2 tsp of salt. I didn't have celery, green olives, and substituted 1/4 c of onions for the scallions. I did include the capers, and used a little less hot sauce than called for. Turned out very flavorful and went well with crab cakes. Will definitely make it again and try it with the celery and green olives!

Used it on crab cakes.  Tasty, but a little thin.  Need to figure out a way to thicken it up--or perhaps just read other the reviews.  I'm sure the answer lies in there somewhere.

I was sure when I saw this. I had alot of the ingredients already.  So, I tried this for a christmas eve shrimp appitizer. Was pleasantly surprised how good it was.  I will put this sauce on all seafood dips, sandwiches or just as a sauce over.  IT WAS REALLY GOOD. WORTH THE TRY : )

Made this to go with crab cakes tonight, excellent!  This will be a regular at my house. Did change a few, no capers, didn't have any, and Dijon mustard as I didn't have the other kind. Oh and I didn't add any salt.  Otherwise made as directed and per another review I did it all in the food processor.

Made this tonight for Panko-crusted crabcakes, absolutely delish!!!  Made a few changes based on heat preference & ingredients I did or didn't have on hand...omitted olives & capers, added sautéed minced red bell pepper & minced celery, cut the chili sauce in half, only did 1 dash of hot sauce & did half mayo half plain yogurt.  Did salt to taste instead of just adding a certain amount.

Made this as shown and it is perfect for shrimp cocktail or something similar. Tried it on the crab cakes and although it was good I just thought it over powered the crab cake a bit

I'm not sure how remoulade is supposed to taste; this was very spicy but I guess that's what it is supposed to be.

Excellent.  I too will cut the salt down next time, because between the salmon patties that I served this with and these...something was a wee bit salty.  A pain to make, but well worth it.  Make it early and then refrigerate to let the flavors mingle.  Thanks for the post Cookincowgirls!
