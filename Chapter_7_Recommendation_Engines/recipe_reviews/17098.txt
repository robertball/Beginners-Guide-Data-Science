Great recipe. I took the advice of another and tossed the ziti with the sour cream before layering. I will NEVER skip this step. The noodles stayed creamy and delicious. I browned ground pork, used left over ground beef, garlic and onion. I didn't have provolone so topped every layer with parmesan. I didn't need 2 jars of sauce as others said they did. very good.

I wish I could rate this 10star!!! I made this exactly per the recipe, only change I made was extra cheese, my family loves italian cheeses, other that I did it exactly. I made this on friday night, and we have eaten 6 meals from this one dish! And it tastes better and better every time. My only recommendation is to use a 3 or maybe even 4 quart dish, for I used a 3 qt and it very nearly overflowed the dish, maybe cause of all the extra cheese I used! I will make this a regular menu item in my home, it was a huge hit!

Aside from a fabulous recipe, this was SO fast. My boyfriend raved about it and so did I. Made a nice 9x13 FULL of ziti. Great for a family style meal with several guests or a pot luck.

Some tips: As suggested by other reviews I seasoned the ground beef with italian seasoning and added minced garlic. To give this recipe a real italian flare, I bought spaghetti sauce with italian sausage already inside so I didnt have to buy and cook sausage too. It turned out just right.. not too overpowering. I also added a small amount of the sauce to cover the first layer of ziti as suggested by another review and it came out perfect.. I think it might have been too dry on the bottom otherwise.

A large skillet was too small for all of the spaghetti sauce. I had to transfer it to a large pot. An electric skillet might be big enough.. 

This recipe fills a 9x13 to the brim so make sure you dont use anything smaller. I also baked this uncovered on the center rack with no isses and the cheese came out nice and golden brown. 

Definitely will make this again!!

I read the reviews and decided to be a little creative. I mixed the ziti with sour cream, ricotta, 1 egg, and 1 jar of the spaghetti sauce. I used Italian sausage and browned it with onion and garlic. I drained the fat off and added the remaining jar of spaghetti sauce. I sprayed a deep baking pan with olive oil spray and then added a layer of ziti, sausage mixture, shredded mozzarella cheese, sliced provolone topped off with sliced pepperoni. I repeated the layers, except for the pepperoni, and topped it off with the parmesan and the fresh basil. I also made an extra pan of this for a friend. Everyone raved about how good it was! I was surprised when my pasta hating son had two helpings! I am giving this 5 stars because it is an excellent base recipe. Thank you!

I have been making this recipe for several years and it is excellent.  Have given the recipe out many times.  Sour cream is MUCH less expensive than riccotta cheese, and many guests do not believe that there isnt riccotta in this ziti.  The only things I do different is that I use an 8oz package of each of the cheese and I assemble differently.  While the pasta is cooking, I brown the beef and onion, drain and mix the 2 jars of sauce with the meat...simmer until pasta is all done. After draining the pasta, I mix it with the meat/sauce.  Time to layer...half meat/sauce/pasta, layer all the provolone, spread a container of sour cream, then rest of meat/sauce/pasta, all the mozz cheese, and a sprinkle of parm cheese.  Bake about 30-45 minutes until hot. NEVER dry and just amazing in taste.  My old family ziti recipe has gone out the window!

This is for kathyj2008.  I totally agree with you.  My pet peeve is people that rate it high or low and then follow up with so many changes that it is nothing like the original.  I like to hear what they did or did not like because that helps me evaluate it considering my tastes.  I thought this was an all around good recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  Made so much that I split it into two batches, freezing one (before baking) and baking the other.  I needed to use a little more cheese than called for because of this, but only about a cup more.  First one was absolutely delicious & we just made the frozen one last night.  I thawed it in the refrigerator overnight and baked as directed.  Just as good as the first time!  I'll be making this a lot for families in our squadron as they have babies or move in/out.  Thanks Susan for such a great recipe.

This was so good!  I was going to make Baked Ziti I, but decided on this one due to the fresh basil (I love it! And I have my own basil plant).  I used a pound of whole wheat penne instead of ziti.  I used 93% lean ground beef, a red onion, and organic pasta, pasta sauce, and sour cream.  I used shredded mozzarella and a 16 oz. container of sour cream.  I made one big deep dish(probably about 11x4 or something) and one foil 8x8 pan to freeze for later.  I loved the fresh basil on top, and added some fresh oregano too, because I just bought an oregano plant yesterday!  My hubby and I loved this, and so did our one-year old!

I must agree with Linda & Kathy.  Make the recipe as written.  It irritates me that so many reviewers make substitutes, then rate it.  Not fair.  Only confuses other reviewers.  If you liked the recipe  ingredients to start with, why change it?  If you decide to make it again, then make your substitutes.  I liked it and will make again to suit my familys taste.

I used 1/2 pound of beef and 1/2 pound ground italian sausage, this dish was an instant hit.  I've already made it twice.

Everyone I asked to try this, loved it. Definately need larger than a 2-quart baking dish. A 9x13 pan was filled to the top.

I made this last night and it was a hit.  I added 2 cloves of fresh, minced garlic to the meat while cooking and some fresh sliced mushrooms too.  I don't buy spaghetti sauce so I used tomato sauce and added oregano, Italian seasoning and salt & pepper along with the basil.  DON'T skip the basil!  I took the advice of another reviewer and stirred the sour cream on to the cooked pasta and reserved a little of the sour cream to add in the center per instructions.  I used a large, deep casserole dish and put some sauce on the bottom first.  Followed that with the pasta and sprinkled parm then more sauce.  Next I sliced 1 pkg of fresh mozzarella in the center along with the sour cream and parmesan. Followed with pasta then sauce ending with sauce.  I topped it with a combo of shredded mozzarella and parmesan.  Baked it uncovered for about 35 minutes.  Delish and so creamy with the fresh mozzarella and sour cream.  Served with hot, crusty bread.  Thanks!

I made this a day ahead for a graduation picnic.  It was a hit!  All ages went back for more.  Cook to pasta to aldente then quick cool in ice water. Dry completely then prepare the layers as directed. Cover and place in fridge.  Remove from the fridge well before baking to allow tray to come to room tempurature.  Then baked uncovered as directed.  We re-covered the trays (I made enough for 20) then transported to the picnic and placed on chafing dishes.  Delicious!

The boys loved this one. . . even though we ate it for three days!  This made a lot more than I was expecting.  Could have substituted less expensive shredded cheeses as well.  Probably will try again using rigotta cheese to replace sour cream so I can freeze the leftovers :)

This recipe was given to me a number of years ago and has always been a hit!  The difference is spicy italian sausage in lieu of ground beef, shredded parmesan cheese and garlic.  However, as others have said there is NO way this fits in a 2 qt dish.  I use two and freeze one.  It is a Winner!

This is so good.  I've been making one similar to this for years.  I've never added sour cream.  Instead I add some Classico Alfredo sauce, but not a whole lot - maybe half a cup as I want to taste the pasta sauce.   I add Fontina cheese too as it's creamy and melts beautifully.  I also use Italian low-fat sausage.  In the summer I have fresh basil and it really takes this to another level.  Also add a combo of Italian spices.  It freezes well for leftovers.  Always a hit!

This was not just simple but delicious! I omitted the meat (TRYING TO SAVE MONEY ON GROCERY BILL) and still found it flavorful. Will definitely make again

I loved this! Tastes a lot like lasagna without all the work. I did add hot italian sausage along with the ground beef. Made my own sauce but kept everything else the same. Was a bit worried about using the sour cream but it tasted great. Will definitely make again.

I have to say that this is really, REALLY good.  The fresh basil really makes a difference in the flavor.  Try to get fresh basil if you can.  Everyone really likes this dish and they often ask me to make for any get-togethers.  ENJOY.  mmmm...mmmmm...good!

A personal favorite of mine! I've used this recipe twice, and both times have turned out wonderfully. The first time, i followed the recipe to a T and it got rave reviews. The 2nd time, I decided to take a vegetarian spin on it by substituting portabello mushrooms for ground beef. I cooked it just as the beef should have been cooked, with the same seasonings. it was absolutely fabulous! The sour cream really makes it.

This was just OK.  I thought the addition of sourcream took away from the "Italianess" of the dish.  I love ziti but won't be making it this way again.

Yum!  And easy...  This makes a TON, so I agree with everyone else, use a 9x13 and you'll fill it to the brim.  I used the ingredients exactly as directed, but made one change to the process and that was to toss the noodles in sour cream before layering.  I can't imagine doing it any other way.  I also used a spicy marinara and it was perfect!  The flavors of the three different cheeses meld beautifully and everything comes together well. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow, they're always better with this kind of dish!

Sounds terrific!  For a vegetarian option, toss cooked & drained ziti with 2 containers of ricotta cheese, & 2 cups of shredded mozzarella.  Pour some of the spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a greased 13x9 pan. Next add 1/2 of the ziti mixture & a layer of cheese--shredded moz, sliced moz or provolone. Finish off the jar of sauce over the top. Repeat layer ending with the 1/2 cup parmesan. Bake 30-45 min. It's a Mr Food recipe that rocks!  Awesome!!

This ziti recipie is fantastic!!!  I did halve the recipe since it is just my husband and I.  I didn't have any onion or fresh garlic so I used onion powder and garlic powder.  I think next time I make it I will add alittle hot breakfast sausage to it and maybe alittle more cheese.  My husband is not a big eater and had 2 huge portions so I was happy.  Thanks for the recipe

Excellent recipe.  Everytime I bake this recipe it is a huge hit in my household.  My suggestion to this recipe would be to mix the sour cream with the baked ziti noodles in a large mixing bowl, this ensures an even coverage.  Also make sure to do a top layer of ziti, cheese, and sauce in that order.  If you put cheese on top of the sauce at the top it might burn the cheese (I have done this before).

Sooo flavorful!  My husband, who usually has no opinion on dinner, said "this is really, really good stuff".  Definately need a bigger dish!!  I ended up pouring mine into a 9x13 after the casserole dish overflowed :)  Keeper!!

YUM! Very good! I did as someone suggested and coated the ziti with the sour cream. It turned out great.

Certainly one of the better ziti recipes i've had.  It is quick, cheap, simple, and thank heavens, not too cheesy.  It may be a little boring for my tastebuds as followed by the recipe, but it wouldn't take much to kick it up a notch.  I did saute the onions before throwing in the beef.  Next time I'll experiment with a few changes like 3-6 cloves of sauteed garlic, a dash of pepper flakes, or maybe mixing/subbing the beef for italian sausage.

the recipe is basically a good one. however, it defineitely calls for ricotta cheese, NOT sour cream! i agree with half gr beef and half sausage. and more seasoning, but that is how i cook everything...

Oh so yummy.  We had company over and they could not stop raving about this ziti.  I made a double batch so I could have leftovers for myself.  I left out the mozzarella and basil, but didn't miss it.  I served this with a salad and garlic bread and I thank you for sharing this yummy recipe.

Good food!  And easy to experiment with. (I doubled it, subbed ricotta for the sour cream and made my own spaghetti sauce but I couldn't fit all the sauce in.) My guests loved it.  The doubled recipe was bigger than 4 quarts and would have fed 20 people.  Great leftovers.

Made it in the morning and placed in fridge til time to cook.  (Let sit on counter for 20 minutes before placing it in oven.) One of the jars of sauce I used had ricotta in it, so that combined with the sour cream made it nice and creamy--not at all dry.  Didn't have provelone cheese (I'm in China and have to take what's available at the time) but I didn't miss it.  It makes a lot of food!  I served with my homemade bruschetta...

I make this recipe over and over again.  And all my friends make it too(they've passed it along as well).  I do use the Sargento's mix of provolone and mozzerella for ease.  The one major change I made was I split it into a 9x13 and a 8x8 pan.  If we have company I bake both otherwise one goes into the freezer for a quick dinner another night.

Great Recipe.

Very good recipe! I followed the instructions almost exactly. The only variation I made was mixing the sour cream and pasta together beforehand. The family loved it! As another reviewer previously said, it had a similar flavor to lasagna. And it made a TON! This would be excellent to bring to potlucks, parties, or when you are having guests for dinner. Yummy and so easy! Will definitely be making again!

Very good and easy to make.  I also mixed the sour cream with the pasta before putting it in a 9x13 pan.  Went over really well for our Mother's Day carry-in at Mom's.

I have never made or eaten Baked Ziti before, and I have to say this was awesome!!  My husband looked at it and was not too thrilled at first, but we have decided that this recipe definitely needs to go into our regular rotation of meals.  This would be perfect for a gathering since it makes so much!  Very simple to put together, I did however use a little more cheese, since we love cheese.  I used the whole 8oz packages of cheese for the mozzarella and provolone, and it was perfect.

So I made this twice recently, apparently bc I forgot to review it, but it's a good recipe so I guess it doesn't matter.  This second time, I used homemade frozen spaghetti sauce and just used my kitchen scale to measure the appropriate amount.  I also followed reviewer's advice and mixed the sour cream with the ziti to keep it moist (well, I used penne, but why quibble?--close enough!) and it works well.  I don't have fresh basil on hand, so I used dried but added it in with the sauce so it could help develop the flavors.  Whenever I make a pasta bake, I put some of the sauce in the pan before the pasta (not much, just enough to have a thin layer) so as to keep the bottom layer of pasta drying out, then I just layer as noted in the recipe.  It works well every time.  I didn't have provolone but I didn't notice--just used a tad more mozzarella, and it worked well.  this is a good, basic recipe.  I must say I prefer another recipe for a quicker ziti since I don't have to boil the noodles (with extra water, they boil in the casserole as it bakes) but this is equally good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting ricotta cheese for the sour cream (I also halved the recipe). I had planned to cover with foil, as other readers suggested, but forgot and it still was fantastic.  Served it with garlic toast and corn, which made it a perfect meal on this cold and snowy night!!!

Delicious, Bruh!!!  Followed some reviewers' advice and tossed the ziti in sour cream before putting in pan.  Also mixed bottom layer of ziti with sauce mixture so noodles wouldn't be dry.  Added lots more cheese, garlic with the onion and used fresh basil on top of cheese layer in middle as well as on top.  Makes a very full dish but didn't spill over.  Great recipe, straight up!!!

This was absolutely delicious!  I made a couple of changes -I didn't bother with the onion or basil.  Also DH hates sour cream (and it seemed a little out of place to me anyway) so instead I used a jar of Ragu alfredo sauce, and I stirred it into the pasta before I layered the ingredients.  Everything else was the same.  Since I was just cooking for two I split it into two pans and froze one of them for later.  Awesome!

It makes a LOT (and may spill over in your oven).  It is a great, inexpensive dish to make for a large crowd.  In the future, I would mix the basil in, as I think you miss out on a lot of the flavor when it is on top.

I must say this is the best and easiest ziti I ever made. I used ground chicken and also used dried basil because that is what I had on hand. Next time I will use fresh basil. I mixed the sour cream into the sauce and then mixed it into the pasta---things are distributedbetter this way. Layered cheeses.

This meal was amazing! I didn't use the onion and sour cream.  Also, I added the parmesan cheese after the dish was finished baking.  I used the Clasico Traditional Sweet Basil sauce so I didn't need to add basil.  The Clasico mushroom and olive sauce is great for this dish as well.  1 pound of ground beef will NOT be enough.  I used two pounds of ground beef and 2.5 jars of sauce. Love this dish and so did my family!

This is the second time I've made this. I stuck pretty close to the recipe, only adding 12 oz of cottage cheese and about a half cup of grated Parmesan to the sour cream. Added about 1/2 tsp cayenne to the spaghetti sauce for a little bite.  I used a 15" X 10" shallow roasting pan and it filled it nicely with a little space to spare at the top.  It is soooooo good!  MY stomach is saying , "No more" and my taste buds are arguing!!!  LOL  I had never seen a recipe for ziti calling for sour cream but it does definitely add something. DELICIOUS!

My family really liked this recipe.  My two daughters are not fans of lasagna, but I thought the ziti might make it appear like something else, it worked.  Although the sour cream taste was fine and not offensive, it curdled during baking and they thought it was ricotta cheese, which they do not like.  Next time I prepare it, I will likely just leave out the sour cream.  I made it as written, but added garlic, salt and Italian seasoning to the meat when cooking otherwise, it would have been very bland.  Do yourself a favor and season your meat before adding the sauce.  Also, this is alot of ingredients for a 2 quart dish.  I had to leave some of the pasta and sauce out because it would have overflowed.  GREAT basic recipe, just needs more seasonings.

This recipe is great!  Mixed the pasta with the sour cream.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  This is definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it quickly has become a favorite.  I was never a fan of baked ziti, but I am now!  I think it is the sour cream that really makes a difference in this recipe.  The noodles and sauce stay creamy rather than dry, and I am sure that the three cheeses adds extra flavor as well.  Yum!

I made this for Christmas eve dinner for my in-laws and it was a huge hit!!! I tossed ziti in sour cream before baking and it made it so creamy! I also topped with shredded Italian cheese blend and oregano instead of parmesan cheese- the recipe had some sauce left over which some people chose to add to their plates of ziti. Will definitely make this again soon!

This was a big hit, but there is no way it fits in a 2 quart dish if prepared exactly as stated.  I used a 3 quart baking dish and still couldn't put in all of the sauce mixture.  I also mixed the basil with the sour cream instead of putting on the top.

Absolutely delicious. I prepared the recipe as stated (using a 3 qt. dish) and everything came out perfect. The ziti were moist and creamy and the flavors merry together nicely. This recipe is by far better than any other I've tried and I'm a mother to 5 and prepare all meals at home. Thank you!

I make this quite often.  I have never used sour cream though.  I use italian sausage and pepperoni and just mix the pasta with the rest of the ingredients and top with some mozzarella rather than layering.  Bake covered for 30 minutes and uncover for the last 10 minutes. Everyone in my family loves this.

Definately a great place to start.  I made it last night for supper.  I made my meat sauce recipe and used that for the sauce.  I than cooked a mixture of small rigatoni and whole wheat rottlia(sp the corkscrew looking one).  the 3rd layer was a package of 6 Italian cheeses with some fontina on the second layer under the sauce and with parme riga on the top.  Just because of cost versus volume.  This was simple and excellent.  I brought leftovers for lunch today.  It also chewed up a bunch of my fresh basil which I have year round.  So simply look at the instructions and eye in for the amount of people you want.  Meat sauce can be frozen for another  meal and cheese put back in the fridge and noodles cna even be nuked with some butter and cheese for a quick lunch.  Grear recipe!  I mixed the sour cream with the cooked noodles until it looked coated

Rave Reviews from my dinner party! I did season my beef with rosemary, dried oregano, dried basil, and fresh minced garlic. Used Classico Spicy Tomato and Basil spaghetti sauce. I also took advice from a reviewer and mixed my noodles with the sour cream when layering and there were no dry noodles to be found! Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out great!

I was leery over the addition of sour cream to this recipe, but went with it anyway since there were so many positive reviews. I was not disappointed! The pasta was creamy and delicious, and the sour cream added a nice, delicate finish. Delicious - will definitely make again!

AMAZING! My fiancee loves this, and all my friends ask for it over and over.  So simple. You can make a day ahead, just don't bake it until the day you plan to eat it.   Changes: I add garlic to the sauce, and some italian seasoning. It tastes amazing.  Since it's just the two of us, I split it between two containers and give one away.  Always makes my friends really happy when they get this

Absolutely fantastic! The sour cream produces such a different flavor than the usual ricotta cheese. This has become my go-to meal for potlucks and dinner parties. The only difference I make is that I usually leave off the basil just because I never remember to pick some up. Tastes great with turkey instead of beef as well.

I cut the recipe in half and it still filled a 9x9 pan to the top!  I took others' suggestion and mixed the sour cream into the noodles.  It creates almost a ricotta effect.  I used a jar of Trader Joe's Organic Tomato and Basil Marinara and substituted mild Italian sausage for the ground beef.  I also used fresh basil from my garden.  It turned out pretty good!  I'll make it again.  I can't imagine making the whole recipe unless I had a LOT of people to feed, though.

Incredible!  This tasted more like lasagna than traditional ziti.  I followed the advice of others...after cooking the ziti, I mixed with sour cream, ricotta, and jar of spaghetti sauce (a very high end brand from Sprouts) and then cooked 1 lb. of Laura's lean beef, and 1/2 lb. of italian sausage, with whole onion and garlic.  Drained the grease and then added the 2nd jar of spaghetti sauce.  Layered 2-9x13 glass dish with ziti mixture, meat mixture, fresh shredded provolone, then fresh shredded mozzarella, then layer of pepperoni, then repeat ziti, meat, and cheese layers again and top with fresh chopped basil and fresh parigiano.  This is way better than most expensive italian restaurants.  fantastic!  thanks for the recipe and everyone's input!

This was my first time making baked ziti and I can't rave enough about the recipe! It was a HUGE success! I threw a couples baby shower for a family member and it was the perfect dish. I am not a fan of ricotta so I was happy to see the sour cream substitute. Just a note-I used my homeade sauce and extra cheese (you can't have enough). Also I used a bigger dish-it fits perfect in one of those aluminium roaster pans. Perfect for a family get together or large group. Thanks!

Five stars all the way around!  This was the best baked pasta I've come across so far.  This made a LOT more than 8 servings/2qt-worth.  I made this in a 4qt/11x13" baking dish and the dish was full.  I used a can of Hunt's "zesty and spicy" sauce and a jar of three-cheese.  The spicy sauce and provolone cheese defintely gave this dish the kick I've been looking for.  My husband and I sent some home with my mother-in-law and heard that my father-in-law raved about it!  I will DEFINTELY make this again and again!  (This is going to be a perfect potluck dish for our family suppers - thank you SO much for sharing!)  FYI - I mixed the sour cream with the pasta before adding sauce, as suggested by another reviewer.

This is a HUGE hit in my house.  I never would have thought sour cream would be such an awesome addition to baked ziti but it's delicious.  I often make this without the meat and it turns out just as well.  One thing I've done differently is to mix the ziti with one jar of the spaghetti sauce so that it's all coated.  I let it sit for about 10-15 before assembling.  It helps ensure that all the noodles have sauce on them.

I use one of those disposable lasagna pans.  It all fits and one less thing to clean up!
I also use a pound of the ground Johnsonville Italian sausage and a pound of beef.

It's good. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, but it's not possible. 
The outcome really depends on the sauce you use.

I made this over the weekend and I just realized I did not put in the basil. I used mini ziti and I did mix the pasta with the meat sauce. I did enjoy it, but I bet it would have been better with the basil. I'll make it again with ALL the ingredients. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a keeper!  It's so rich and creamy, which makes it stand above most ziti recipes. Perfect for potlucks or parties since it travels well and can be prepared ahead. It's so easy to make and the flavors are even better the next day. Pick a good quality tomato sauce, and it tastes yummy still made with reduced fat sour cream. I also add sauteed mushrooms to the sauce and several shakes of Italian spices too.

I was looking for a quick, easy recipe and was impressed by all the reviews.  Looking at the recipe I had my doubts but tried it anyway.  It was simply OK - I have no idea why people went crazy over it.  The sour cream dries up and has an interesting creamy consistency like ricotta - so why not use ricotta anyway?  It would taste better.  My idea of a great baked ziti is one that has plenty of homemade sauce and thick top layer of bubbly mozarella cheese.

This is a great tasting recipe, but the directions said to use a 2 quart baking dish; there is no way to fit all of that food into a 2 quart dish.  Better to use a bigger dish!

This was excellent.  I made it for a youth group event last weekend and everyone loved it.  I was very nervous as Italian food is not my specialty. I made it with the Ragu Chunky Tomato, Garlic & Onion and the sauce tasted as fresh as any homemade I have ever eaten! Let me also add that 1 & 1/2 pans fed 20 people with a lot going back for 2nds and 3rds.  This dish really does make a lot.  Thanks for a great recipe

I've made this recipe yesterday and it is very creamy, cheasy and absolutly delicious! Besides it is very easy and quick to do. I browned the meet in a tablespoon of olive oil with the onion sauted first. I used a jar of tomato sauce and a jar of bolognese sauce and turned out fantastic and tasty! This recipe will be a usual at my table!!!Thanks Susan!

This is the first review I've posted and if I could give this 10 stars, I would.  Made this for dinner tonight and it was fabulous.  Used Bertolli's Tomato and Basil sauce, followed the recipe exactly.  Everybody loved it and it was so simple to fix.  This will definitely be fixed on a regular basis.  Thanks for the great recipe.

LOVED this recipe!! Hubby raved, too! I changed a few things - only used one 28-oz jar of spaghetti sauce (two would have been way too much liquid), sauteed 3 minced cloves of garlic with the onion and substituted ricotta cheese for the sour cream. I also used shredded mozarella instead of slices (easier to sprinkle on the layers). It all fit nicely in a 9x13 pan (I think because of using only one jar of spaghetti sauce).  It was plenty moist and very, very tasty. It made a lot! Enough for two dinners and two lunches for him, plus I froze two more small containers for later lunches. Thanks, Susan! I will be making this many times!

This is very good.  I used hot turkey sausage instead of ground beef and grated cheese instead of sliced.  Next time I will mix all of the ingredients together (except for the basil and parm cheese) for a better, more even consistency.  But very good as is.

This was my first attempt at cooking from a recipe I was not familiar with. If I can make it, anyone can. I made it without beef and substituted ricotta cheese for sour cream. DELICIOUS, very cheesy, tastes just like Sbarros. My boyfriend thinks I can actually cook now. You may want to use a bigger pan though. It was overflowing! Wonderful recipe. Anyone will like it.

I made this only I used a local rough ground Italian sausage instead of the ground beef. My previous recipe did not include sour cream and fresh basil, which really adds another layer of depth and flavor to this dish.

The other thing I do is I mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl, then pour it into the greased casserole dish, then topping with the Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.

This meal freezes well and is a go-to dish when I'm in a hurry after a long day at work.

I really liked this recipe.   I  did change a couple things which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I used homemade sauce and layered the ingredients a little different.  After reading the other reviews I mixed the sauce with the ziti and put the cheese on top of each layer.  It turned out great and my family loved it.  Yum

As is, this recipe is 5 stars.  Creamy, flavorful, filling, one of my favorite things to make.  Over time I've changed a few things to make it 6 stars.  I make homemade meatballs (Soprano's recipe), saute onions and mushrooms before adding the sauce, and coat the noodles in sour cream before putting them in the dish.  It's great and easier with hamburger or italian sausage, but meatballs make it outstanding!

This was delicious and easy. I got some spiced sauce and didn't get fresh basil. I also mixed the sour cream with the pasta before layering, per some reviews. I wish I had bought shredded cheese as I was stripping the cheese in half to make sure they mixed well.

I agree with the other reviewer that said to mix the sour cream with the pasta to keep it from drying out. I thought it needed some salt, but the kids and husband disagreed with me, so there you go… LOL. I was also too lazy to cut and sauté the onion so I used an envelope of Lipton onion soup mix. I have made it exactly as written  before and it's a FIVE star recipe. I've also added cottage cheese before when I had extra that was getting kind of… old. I've also made it with elbow macaroni before. It's a very versatile dish.  :-)

This recipe was out of this world.  I usually make baked ziti with ricotta, but didn't have any this time, so I tried this method. I've had the recipe in my recipe box for years, but never was adventurous enough to give it a try.  All I can say is--Wow!  So much better than my other recipe.  I squeezed 2 or 3 sausages out of their casings and added that to the ground beef; I also added some mushrooms that I wanted to use.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Sorry, baked ziti purists, but I don't think I'll ever make it with ricotta again--this was so creamy and delicious.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  Try it--you won't be disappointed.

Surprisngly very good.  We added garlic to the  ground beef as it was browning.  We used a can of tomato paste and a can of tomato sauce since we did not have a jar of spaghetti sauce.  It turned out fabulous ~  Can't wait to have the leftover tomorrow ~

very good and simple. I used Italian blend cheese in addition to the provalone  because I had it on hand. I also added the sour cream to the pasta as suggested by others. I used my own homemade spahetti sauce. I did not use quite as much liquid (sauce) as the recipe states.

Oh wow.  This was really good.  One hour from start to table with a salad and garlic bread.  My 6yo twins devoured it and my italian-food resistant husband actually said he'd like to have it again.  Mixed the ziti with the sour cream (will go down to 1c next time), used 1.5 jars of sauce, and omitted the fresh basil.  We'll get another two meals out of this too!  It's easy, comforting, and very kid friendly.  Thanks Verdieiiis!

Super duper YUMMY and very easy to make!!!!  Got rave reviews from our family, including our 4 year old daughter.  I followed this recipe as written, but added a little more cheese (consequently, it ended up being QUITE cheesy!)  Note that this doesn't fit in a 2 quart baking dish...not even close!  Make sure to use a larger dish.  We'll definitely be making this again!

Next time I think I'll only use one jar of sauce and a little less sour cream. Having said that, this dish was delicious. I'm pretty new to cooking and was happy about how great this turned out. Will definitely be making this again.

TRY THIS RECIPE!!! Followed it EXACTLY the first time: comments- MAKES TOO MUCH unless you are the Brady Bunch. Second time: used 1 1/2 jars Mezzeratta Arrabbiatta Spaghetti sauce (unbelievable), tossed cooked Ziti (12 oz) with 1 cup sour cream to keep it creamy, added 2 cloves of minced garlic, and only used shredded Mozzarela cheese. OUTSTANDING RECIPE

Delish!!!!  The only suggestion I have is to omit the provolone, as the other cheeses over power it, making it needless calories and fat anyway.  Next time I'll just put more of the other cheeses......

This recipes was typical of a casserole. It was just okay. Everyone raved about it in the reviews and I thought it was going to be fantastic...it was not. I tossed the noodles in the sour cream as suggested and followed the recipe exactly. I just expected more...

The only reason this got 5 stars from me is because I couldn't give it 10! My husband does not usually like pasta and he ate this for a week straight! The only thing about it is that it makes way more than our little family can eat. Next time I may try and freeze some to put in the oven for later.

This was so good!  I subbed lean ground turkey for the ground beef and used light sour cream.  I overflowed my 2.5 qt casserole dish, so next time I will use something bigger.

my picky eater husband really enjoyed this. i made it like the recipe said, but I used sausage instead of the beef. Great leftovers too. Word of advice, use a big pan because the 3 qt 9x 13 I used was almost too small. Also you may want to cover with tin foil until the last 5 min or so of baking so the cheese doesn't burn.

Yum!  I really like the sour cream in this rather than ricotta.  I've made the recipe several times now.  The first time, I made it as described.  The second time I halved the beef.  This last time, I left the meat out.  My favorite was the meatless version!  Very good.

Made pretty much just as written.  Used turkey meat less fat and light sour cream.  Was really good. If I was not trying to fit in a new bathing suit I would have had garlic bread with it.

I mixed the sour cream into the dry pasta and this definitely kept the pasta creamy instead of drying out. I only used half the amount of sauce because that was all i had. I used fontina cheese instead of provolone because that is all i had. It came out great! My husband's least favorite food is pasta and he said this was excellent! Definitely make it again! So easy to make.

My husband and loved this recipe, and my husband is an extremely picky eater:) I customized it a little-I used ground turkey instead of beef, alfredo sauce instead of tomato, and tossed the pasta with sour cream(like another person suggested). It was extremely delicious and creamy! I'll definitely be making this dish again.

This did not fit into a 2 qt baking dish and I didn't even add any meat! I used a 2 1/2 qt dish and it was filled to the top before I finished adding all the sauce. Almost a whole jar is left over. I'll just have to hope that it doesn't come out too dry. It was easy to make though.

My family loves this recipe so thank you for sharing it :)  I only made few small changes by adding some fresh grated parmesan to the sour cream and tossing the pasta in it; and, as other reviewers suggested, I seasoned the ground beef with Italian seasoning and minced garlic.

Very good dish! I mixed the sour cream with the noodles as recommended by others. Came out great! I like the mix of provolone and mozzerella.

Fantastic! Following the advice of others, I tossed the sour cream with the noodles to keep them from drying out. When I was layering everything I was afraid that there was too much sauce and not enought meat but it all turned out great. I did the layers a little different: noodles/sour cream, sauce, cheeses, sauce, noodles/sour cream, sauce, cheese, sauce, and parmesan just to keep it from getting dry. You can get a good quality sliced mozzarella and provolone cheeses at the deli counter for less than you will pay in the refrigerator section.

This is a delicious recipe!  I gave it 5 stars even if I made some changes to it.  It would have been a great recipe without the changes I’ve made.  I had homemade meat pasta sauce so I used that rather then having to brown ground beef and adding a jar of pasta sauce so I did save some time.  I also added fresh spinach because I had some I wanted to use up and it’s healthy…..I tossed it on top of my sauce while it was heating up just to wilt it down.  I also did not bother with the layering process…all I did was mix my pasta with the sour cream (from other review) placed at bottom of dish topped with heated sauce them added my cheese on top.  One review mentioned that her cheese got too browned on top but if all your ingredients are hot then the dish does not have to be in the oven for a very long time….it just needs time to get bubbly hot and melt the cheese on top.  Thanks VERDIEIIIS for the great recipe….it’s a keeper.

This a very good recipe. I added garlic and used half beef and half pork. You need a much larger pan than is suggested. I used a lasagna pan and it was full.

**Update** - I made this for a second time and used a 15oz carton of ricotta cheese for the sour cream, again mixed in with the pasta.  Used ground turkey and added 1 t. each, italian herb and salt.  Deelish!! prefer the ricotta, for sure.  My husband would like me to add capers and red pepper flakes next time, but as I said before, the kids LOVE it the simple way.   This was a great and easy meal.  My kids (3 and 18 months)devoured their dinner - I should give 5 stars for that.  I used macaroni and coated the pasta with sour cream as recommended.  I used a 12oz package of shredded cheese combo from Trader Joe's and dried basil for fresh.  I will make again.

Great recipe, I love fresh Basil. This makes well over the serving suggestion. There are 5 of us and I could still cut the recipe in half and have some leftovers. Served with a salad and garlic bread for the perfect easy pleasey cold weather meal.

Very yummy recipe. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and light sour cream to make a little healthier.. very good.  Also, I took the previous suggestion to toss the ziti noodles in sour cream before layering and used a bit more cheese.  Definitely need a 3-quart baking dish or larger; mine barely fit into the 3-quart dish.  My boyfriend really liked this dish and we had lots of leftovers.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe without any alterations the first time and it was okay but SO much better the second time when I followed the suggestions to add the sour cream to the ziti.  It was so rich and creamy.  I probably added just a bit more sour cream and cheese than it asked for too.

Great recipe. I added some blobs of ricotta mixed with parsley and egg with the sour cream layer just because I couldn't imagine cooking baked ziti without it! Also, covered with tin foil sprayed with pam for the majority of the time, then took it off in the last 5 minutes. Great recipe, yum yum.

I also followed other advise and mixed the hot noodles with the sour cream.  It was good, but way too much sauce.  I think that the taste of the sauce took over the whole meal.  I will try again with 1/2 the amount of sauce.

I served this at my son's birthday dinner and everyone ate it up from small children to older adults.  I did toss the pasta in 1/2 the sour cream and spread the remainder and it worked great.  I added a little extra cheese and used Prego mushroom and green pepper sauce. This is diffinetely a keeper.

This ziti remains moist even when reheated and is very cheesy. This was very good with some crusty garlic bread.

The easiest baked ziti I have ever made and it was just as tasty as more complicated recipes. I didn't have fresh basil on hand and it still tasted great.

I make this all the time. I make mine with Trader Joe's Organic Vodka Sauce & Shredded cheese. It tastes awesome!!! I don't eat meat so I use the fake Morning Star Farms recipe crumbles and It turns out perfect every time.  This is a recipe that is REALLY HARD to screw up.  It makes great leftovers for days! A+

We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  It definitely makes a lot and tastes great reheated.  There is nothing that needs to be changed in this recipe.  We use the "Sweet Basil" tomato sauce from Classico and really enjoy it.  My picky 3 year old always asks for more and we always share this recipe.  Make this tonight!  You won't be disappointed! :-)

Excellent and E-Z recipe. I didn't have sliced provolone or mozzarella, but I subbed sliced American cheese and a shredded cheddar/Mexican blend (DeMoula's Market Basket brand, no less), and used a bit more than 2 TBSP of grated Parmesan at the end, just eyeballing it. The verdict? Deelish, filling and enough for several days (and I'm 6-3, 19 stone).

This was excellent! I only made a couple of changes per other reviews. I added a can of drained Italian style diced tomatoes to the sauce mixture & left out the basil. I only used about a cup of sour cream. I mixed half a cup with the pasta on the bottom of the dish, along with a couple of spoonfuls of sauce. (I made it the night before so I didn't want it to be dry.) I used one can of Prego sausage flavored sauce & one can of Prego meat flavored sauce.

This was outstanding.  I spread a little sauce on top of the ziti before layering as someone suggested so it wouldn't dry out but other than that I followed the recipe to a "T".  Will probably make up a huge dish to freeze and take to the beach.

This recipe is great, but it does make ALOT.  It's really inexpensive to make if you use the grated "italian cheese blend" that is in the dairy section at the grocery store.  It is a combination of all of the required cheeses plus a few extras.  I always love easy!  I make this with sliced hot italian sausage, it comes out great every time.  It can even be made ahead and put into the oven the night of.

This was a big hit at an inpromtu dinner party. Very simple, yet very good. If I had to make any changes I would use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta cheese. The sour cream is what really makes the dish. Will definately be this again, but most likely on a smaller scale.

I make this all the time. Sometimes with sausage, sometimes with gr. beef, sometimes with no meat. I rarely use more than 1 C sour cream though. It is always a hit.

This was great!! I didn't have any cheese except for shredded mozzeralla, and i still thought it was great!! I think it will be even better with the sliced cheese (it was hard to spread the sour cream on the shredded)!

THE BEST I HAVE EVER EATEN.  I did not have ziti so I used rigatoni and added green bellpepper with the onions to saute. I used Bertolli olive oil and garlic sauce.  I was surprised at the sour cream being so good in this.  Can't wait for the next time to cook it. Also it is so easy.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.. God Bless You......

I liked this, it made TONS! Four adults didn't even eat half! I will try sausage next time as I thought it needed a little more heat, I might also try some chili powder or red pepper flake.  My boyfriend said it was perfect the way it was.

This recipe was delicious!! It's quick and a perfect dish to serve company because it serves alot and can easily be doubled. I added italian seasoning to my sauce, used lowfat sour cream, and instead of Provolone and Mozzerella slices, I used a lowfat italian pre-shredded cheese mix. My family loved it!

Made twice already in 3 weeks since finding recipe.  Only different thing I did was use ricotta cheese in place of sour cream, and mixed it throughout the noodles.

I also don't think people who substantially change the recipe should review it!  It's ok to change to your taste, but reviews are supposed to rate the recipe as listed.

I did make this exactly as written and came out very good (4 Stars).  Now, with that said, in the future I would also use ricotta cheese instead of sour cream, and add 2 or 3 cloves of chopped fresh garlic, and cook for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  I will also add 1 small can of tomato paste to the sauce (Gravy) because I love how it deepens the taste.  If it turns out better than the original, as I suspect, I'll post a new recipe!  If it's not better, I'll stick with this 4 star original!!!

I have been making this for years.  Once you make this version of ziti, you will never try another recipe.  The sour cream really makes this recipe stand out.  It is especially good if you have anyone who has an issue with ricotta cheese.  When I make it, I leave out the meat and use a marinara sauce. This is my go to main dish , when someone needs a dish to pass whether it be a happy or a sad occassion...it is a nurturing dish.  You can't go wrong with this one.  It freezes well too.I use rigatoni or a shape like that.

UNBELIEVEABLE!!! Def follow the recommendation of one of the reviewers and mix the sour cream in with the cooked noodles first and then go ahead and do your layering.  Seriously had nothing left after having company for dinner and even heard "This is the best pasta I've ever had!" I also tossed in a tablespoon of brown sugar to my sauce....so, so good!!!

This ziti casserole was pretty great to eat. I would definitely keep this as a menu item. A big change that should be made is that the cooking time should be 45 minutes compared to 30 minutes, was not heated all the way through. But was still pretty good.

I made no substitutions which is new for me. The recipe called for a 2 qt casserole and I used a 3 quart.  It filled every last space in the pan. This recipe was excellent! Sour cream made it creamy. Everyone loved it!

This was the first time making Bake Ziti  at the tender age of 56 years  my family  loved it. I did make a slight change to it  by adding Italian hot sausage and a little dash of Cayenne pepper.It did taste very good and would make it in the future .

My family thought the layer of sour cream was weird and tasted like, well, a layer of sour cream. We all ended up mixing up our portions to blend it and that made it better. I'd definitely recommend adding the sour cream in some other way, like tossing it with the noodles as others have suggested.

I highly recommend this recipe but do have some comments. I found sauce in our grocery store only comes in 24 oz size so I bought 3 of them and used 2 1/3 to get to exactly the 56 ounces total the recipe calls for. That was probably a little too much, will stick to 2 jars next time. Typical of recipes in this app the total time required is understated some. And despite simmering the onions as directed (length of time) they ended up a bit crunchy. Lesson learned - taste them next time. Which is fine but will just lengthen the total time a little more. I also subbed in low fat versions of cheese and sour cream and it turned out just fine in terms of taste and texture.

I wish I could give this 10 stars! I have made this recipe twice. It is so easy to make and delicious! Every time I have made this recipe, I receive positive feedback that it tastes like a restaurant version. I would recommend cooking the pasta for 6 minutes because my noodles turn out a little bit crunchy after they hit the oven. Overall love!

Definitely enjoyed this recipe! Didn't add anything to it except extra seasonings and it was a hit! We even ate it for left overs which normally does not happen. This will definitely be kept as a favorite

I made this minus the fresh basil and ground beef.  I had neither on hand and it's 10 degrees out so going out shopping for them was not on the agenda.  I used Italian turkey sausage and left out the fresh basil but did add Italian seasoning to pasta and sour cream mixture.  I also added a baby spinach.  It was very good. I will make this again.  I may try ricotta next time.

After reading the other reviews I didn't try to put this in a 9×13 pan.  I used my roasting pan instead and it was pretty full.  Since the roaster was non-stick I didn't need to grease the pan prior to filling.

I did use two of the 24 oz jars of pasta sauce. Couldn't find ziti so I used rigatoni instead.

The recipe is good as is, but the second time around time around, I buttered & seasoned my noodles (with onion powder, garlic powder, seasoning salt, pepper and Italian seasoning, used ground turkey instead of lean beef, added Italian sausage and seasoned my meat (with same seasonings as above) and used 8 oz of both provolone and mozzarella cheeses. My family LOVES it. We're pretty big on Italian food so that's no small complimet! GREAT recipe, thanks so much for sharing.

Very good. Filled a 9x13 glass dish to the brim. I used ground deer burger instead of ground beef because that's what we had in the freezer. I used all mozzarella instead of provolone because it was cheaper to buy one package and use it all than to buy two different types of cheese and only half of each. I mixed the noodles with the sour cream and put a layer of sauce first as suggested by other reviews and that helped keep the noodles soft. Yum!

I accidentally skipped the sour cream the directions didn't really say when to add but all of a sudden it showed up as "pour meat sauce and sour cream mixture on ziti"... Was I supposed to stir it in the meat sauce as it was cooking? Or mix it in just before I poured over pasta? 

I also only used 2 jars of pasta sauce instead of 3.

Great recipe!

Very delicious and super simple! Only made a couple modifications by substituting cottage cheese instead of sour cream and added garlic salt and Italian seasoning. I mixed the pasta with the cottage cheese as others suggested and it turned out awesome

The meal came out great! I added more salt and pepper. I also mixed the pasta with the sour cream before layering it with the sauce and cheese. I covered it with foil for the first half of baking time. =]

i would give this ten stars if i could. followed recipe exactly(used mostaccioli shells, since i couldn't find ziti and i don't know if there's a difference) and used garlic basil barilla sauce(consumer report good buy).
tossed the pasta with light sour cream before putting it in dish and voila! simply one of the best things i have made from this site. my son ate 1/3 of the dish in one sitting.

Me & my Husband loved this. We omitted the beef, and I coated the pasta with one cup of sour cream as another suggested. I would not skip this step as it made it stay moist I believe. I used one jar of organic sauce instead of two, This was great but may use one and half next time as it dried out just a bit after a few days. It last several days and we loved it as leftovers for dinner & lunch. This is going on the regular meal list. I may make a half recipe in a smaller pan since it is just the two of us eating it all. Loved it!

I made this recipe exactly as stated with no alterations.  It was pretty dang good.  Not awesome.  It could use a little more flavor.  The sour cream seemed a little off... I think next time I would use Ricotta instead of sour cream and maybe add a 1/2 pound of ground Italian sausage.  You won't go wrong making the recipe as is though. It was very good.  We all enjoyed it.  I suspect the leftovers will be better than day 1 when the flavors all merry together.  Thank you for the good recipe.

Put RICOTTA CHEESE in this! The only thing I did to modify was to add a small container of ricotta cheese, and I mixed the noodles with the ricotta and sour cream before I started layering. It took the recipe from a 3 to a 5. This is a keeper! Also, be sure to use a 9x13 pan - it will fill it to overflowing.

I absolutely loved this recipe. It took on a creamier and smooth flavor with the sour cream. My husband and daugther gave two thumbs up! It's a keeper. I did however, used swiss cheese instead of provolone only because I had swiss and didn't want to make an extra trip to the store. I also used half ground beef and half Italian sausage..mmmmm....Fantastic!

Easy & delicious!  Used Newman's Own Sockarooni Sauce & used just one bag of shredded moz split instead of sliced.  Added garlic in w/ my onions but otherwise followed directions in a 4 qt. dish!  It was fantastic. *Revised: Froze it & went straight from freezer to oven in a Gladware casserole. Because the Gladware smaller - if freezing use 3/4 recipe (half was a little dry)

I added hot Italian Sausage to the dish.  I also mixed the sour cream with the tomato sauce, and then layered the cheese in the casserole dish.  I used the Sargento 6 Italian Cheese blend which worked out perfectly.

This is my go to recipe every year, as I am begged to make ziti every year for our Potluck Christmas party at work.  Making it in a crockpot assures you won't have too much to fit in the pan, but you also won't get the perfect baked texture and you'll need to adjust your sauce to your desired dryness level.  I tried this last year, and while enjoyed by all, I felt just the sour cream made it too twangy and I had tons left over.  This year I made my sauce separate and let it stew awhile adding in spices/flavoring to my liking rather than just opening two generic cans of sauce.  The sour cream is a nice touch but I used only just enough to "butter" my noodles with after boiling.  I also felt ziti desparately needs ricotta so I replaced the sour cream in the middle with ricotta.  A mixture of beef and italian sausage gives a more authentic flavor of ziti as well.  There were 11 people total at our Christmas party this year and I barely had a serving to take home with me.  Nevertheless, as written, the recipe is still very good and will get rave reviews.

My family loved this dish. It is very tastey and easy to make.  I prepared ahead, covered and put in refrigerator until time to bake.  Next time I make it, I think I will add some sliced black olives and garlic.

Was a hit with my hubby!!  He loved it.  I was unsure about the sour cream so I limited the amount that I added, however the sour cream is what gives it the rich flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was good, but not GREAT.  funny is that everyone loved it, but I didn't. It was good and I ate it...but I didn't like the sour cream in it. It gave it sort of a tangy taste, which I didn't like.  I don't care for ricotta cheese, and the sour cream became like a tangy ricotta once cooked.  I added extra basil and 5 cloves of garlic to the sauce, which gave the sauce great flavor.  I would make again, but leave out the sour cream.

This was amazing!!!  I always add more spices though.  Lots of fresh garlic, parsley, rosemary, and sometimes mushrooms.

Excellent recipe, however used 13.25 oz box penne pasta and switched out one jar of spag sauce for a can of diced toms in garlic and basil. I also added in 4 oz. Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and some extra ground fennel. Doubled the parmesan cheese.  Next time I will switch the sour cream for ricotta.  Also did not include the chopped basil in the cooking process but rather sprinkled it on the finished meal to maintain the delicate flavor of the herb.  Wonderful dish!  Sorry, I can't help but play with recipes.

This was really delicious, though I made some modifications.  I used ground turkey (93% lean) and light sour cream.  I also used an italian mix of shredded cheeses vs. purely provolone.  I also took the advice of others and tossed the pasta in the sour cream before layering everything. It was great, and I would definitely make it again.

I also mixed in the sour cream with the noodles first and them layered accordingly.  The recipe was great and I used ground turkey instead of beef.

This was really good, I especially like the sour cream added to it :) The men really liked it, but said there was room for improvement. It's just missing that little something to make it really fantastic! Thank you for sharing your recipe, it is definitely a good base to tweak to suit the tastes of the family!

This is a good recipe, very tasty.  I will replace my old baked Ziti recipe with this one.  Used only 1 jar of sauce and it was enough.  I also added 1 clove of garlic with the onion.

This was amazing!! It lasted us for several meals. I took the advice of other reviewers and added the sour cream to the noodles as well as some of the sauce. I also put the cheese on top of the layered sauce. I used shredded mozzarella and dried basil and it all turned out delicious!!

Delicious!  I followed the tip of stirring the ziti into the sour cream and cheated by using dried basil (time crunch).  I also added more mozzarella - not sure how much because I had a little extra shredded in the refrigerator and just sprinkled into the first layer of cheeses.  My bf actually preferred this to the Baked Ziti I, which was also much enjoyed, due to the basil.  Next time I will make it with fresh basil and see if it makes a difference, not that this needs any improvement!

LOVE this recipe! Very easy to make and easy to tweak, I use vegetarian crumbles instead of ground beef and even meat eaters love this! If you want to save some calories/fat and serve a vegetarian swap out the meat! :)

This is one of my go-to recipes.  I use is so often its rediculous.  I'm rating five stars just for the awesomeness of the pure recipe itself.

But heres what i've done to perfect it in my own taste:  I add salt, pepper and garlic to the beef along with the onion.  I use about 1 1/2 jars of "tomato basil" sauce.  I feel that the flavor of spaghetti sauce really enhances the recipe.  Finally I use just mozzerella (no provolone) and a sprinkle of parmesan.

Its delicious with or without modifications.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

This was excellent. The sour cream makes it really creamy and good. The only thing that I would say is that I used a 2.5 qt baking dish and it still overflowed the edges.

Made it exactly as written. It was good. Not five star  fantastic, but good. I will definitely make it again, but next time I will use 1.5 jars of pasta sauce instead of 2 as I found my pasta a bit more watery than I usually like. I will also cut the sour cream down to 1 cup instead of 1.5. I let mine stand for about 5 minutes, but would suggest letting it rest for maybe 10 mins before serving just to allow it to "firm up".

This recipe is soooooooo  good. Just made it and my entire family loved it even my 17 month old daughter who ate meat for the first time with this recipe. I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and mix pasta with the sour cream, very nice touch. You will need two jars of sauce FOR SURE!!!!

Good base, easy enough to assemble but definitely needs a bigger pot and MORE seasonings plus a sub of spicy Italian sausage doesn't hurt.

My pickiest eater said, "MAKE THIS AGAIN!" The only thing I did different was I sprinkled the dish with a little bit of red pepper flakes and I used homemade spaghetti sauce.  Everyone loved this recipe.

This was soooo yummy! I added a few spices to the sauce when it simmered. I put in a little Sriracha,fresh basil, onion powder, italian seasonings and sugar. Came out so amazing I will make it again!

This ziti is FAB!  I used Bertrolli Olive Oil and Garlic sauce (which is my favorite sauce).  I always add 2-4 cloves of additional garlic to the sauce, a teaspoon of oregano, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and 1/4 cup grated parmasean cheese.  I would use half of this for 1 jar.  Yes, I have an addiction to garlic....and I add cayenne pepper to almost everything.  I followed the recipe as written (aside from my personal additions to the jars of spaghetti sauce).  I did follow the recommendations of another reviewer and mixed the noodles with sour cream.  This turned out fabulously.  My husband and 12 year old daughter loved it as did my 2 year old son.  This is definitely going into my rotation and will be the "go to dish to take to pot lucks".  Thank you Vardieiis for such a wonderful recipe.  Oh, and one more thing.  The fresh basil sprinkled over the top is a must.  I just want to emphasise fresh basil as dried basil spice can just not compare to using fresh!  You can't go wrong with this recipe!!  WE LOVE IT!!!

Yummy!  It's definitely a large amount, so I think I'll divide into two dishes next time.  I used ground turkey, but other than that I went by the recipe.  Delicious!

This was pretty good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the store bought sauce -- next time I will make my own.  I did as other reviewers suggested and mixed the noodles with the sour cream.  I also used shredded pizza cheese since it had the mozarella and the provolone cheeses all in one.  And I also added meatballs to give it a little something extra.

Just made this last night. it was a huge hit! Thanks for the recipe! Everything came out great but it does call for a lot more sauce than I think it needs. I will experiment with lesser quantities in the future.

Delicious.  It's almost like a lazy-man's lasagna.  I took another reviewers suggestion and mixed the pasta with the meat sauce, then layered as directed.  Only other changes were to add some chopped fresh garlic to beef and onions, and used Ricotta instead of sour cream.  Fresh basil definitely adds a lot of flavor.  Makes a ton.  As another review noted, this would be an excellent pot luck dish.  This will go into my regular rotation file.

I made this for a family gathering and everyone LOVED it! I splurged on the sauce and used an arrabiata and a marinara sauce from Culinary Circle. I'm so glad I did as it would not have had the flavor that it did if I had used a Prego or Ragu. I served it with caesar salad and ciabatta bread. I've made many great recipes from AllRecipes.com and this is my 1st review. It was so good and had such a great response that I thought I should share!

Very good, my family loved it. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. It was fine. Served a lot! Would be a great potluck dish.

This was a wonderful pasta dish!  It took quite a bit longer to cook than I anticipated though.  I would add a bit more basil throughout the dish next time though, just to amp up the flavour.

My kids all asked at the same time if they could have this dish again tomorrow in their lunches.  It was if the world stopped turning.  Even my husband liked it and he doesn't like anything with red sauce.

Added a 1/2 cup Ricotta cheese and seasoned some ground turkey instead of beef.  Made in individual bowls and used 1/2 the sauce because that was all we had on hand.  Still turned out amazing!  My wife is a big fan of Baked Ziti and she raved about it.

Had to cheat terribly I'm afraid but still, delicious :o) eating it as we speak at 2.30am!!!
No provolone unless maybe go to Selfridges or Harrods so I used mature cheddar instead.
No spaghetti sauce so used tinned tomatoes, oxo cube and mixed herbs.
Had some leftover bacon bits and chorizo floating around so used those in the meat mixture too.
Overall very yummy.  Thanks for a great recipe :o)

Had this for dinner this evening. Tasted great!!! I did tweak it a bit. I sauteed a green bell pepper, minced garlic, and portabella mushrooms with the onion, and meat. I didn't have fresh basil, so I added about 3t of dried basil, and about 1 1/2 t of orgegano to the meat mixture. Really a great base recipe. Thanks for sharing. I forgot....I also added a can of rotell original to the meat sauce.

I made some changes to this recipe by replacing sour cream with cottage cheese and using ground turkey instead of beef.  I also mixed in some chopped spinach and skipped the fresh basil.  My husband and I loved it!

Needed to use up the last of the block of mozzarella I had, and this was perfect. I did make the Marinara Sauce on this site, and let it simmer with the beef and onion mixture. I cut all the amounts in half for only two people, and I still had enough for a 2-quart casserole. Yummy!

Excellent! I used less cheese to lower the fat content and I only used mozzarella since I didn't have any provolone, and whole grain pasta.. Still came out really good!!

I made this recipe as stated, but kept it veggie-friendly and didn't add the beef (I did add the sauteed onions to the pasta sauce though).  I tossed the ziti with the sour cream as others had noted.  We were able to comfortably feed 7 adults, with a salad and garlic bread on the side.  It's a great recipe for a mild audience, but my husband and I had to add a lot of crushed red pepper to ours to make it palatable.

How can you go wrong with this? Everyone liked it! My only complaint is the the instructions are misleading. I used a 2 1/2qt baking dish and that was still too small. Use between a 3 and a 4qt to prevent a mess.

This was sooo good! I didnt change a thing!  I did just mix the Sour Cream with the noodles after I drained them so they would not get dryed out during cooking.

This dish turned out very flavorful and delicious! The only thing I did different was use 12oz. of ricotta mixed with one egg instead of the sour cream and mixed the cooked pasta into it before baking to prevent dryness. I also used 8oz of cheese instead of 6oz. It turned out fantastic and was a huge hit with everyone who ate it! The basil really gave it an awesome flavor!

Great stuff!  I made a 1/2 recipe in a shallow 9x13 " pan and it was full.  I prefer to eat vegetarian, so I substituted Morningstar Sausage for the ground beef.  Probably ended up using more prov/mozz as well--6 oz in a half recipe.  Delicious, easier than lasagna and makes great left overs.

I made a few changes but I loved this recipe.  I exchanged the sour cream for ricotta cheese and exchanged the provolone for cheddar cheese and it turns out great every time.  I added minced garlic and diced green peppers to the beef.  Everyone raved about it and always ask me to bring it to get togethers.

Great recipe, but use a larger dish! The first time I made this, I used a 2.5 quart dish and it overflowed and was a total mess. I made it again using a a 4 quart rectangular pan, everything fit nicely this time.   Both times I made this I prepared it in the morning, put it in the fridge, and cooked it later. Perfect dish for making ahead of time. The leftovers are fabulous!

This was pretty tasty and a little different than other baked italian dishes. Instead of ground beef I used Aidell's sun dried tomato and Mozzarella sausage, sliced. I also mixed the pasta with the sour cream, basil,parm and cayanne pepper.

Yummy.  I've made this a number of times and the only change I make is seasoning the ground beef with a bit of salt, pepper, garlic and Italian seasoning before adding the spaghetti sauce.  The last time I made this I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 8"x8" glass dish and used shredded mozzarella instead of sliced, because it's what we had.  Worked perfectly.  An easy dinner that I describe as a "lazy lasagna".  This recipe makes a lot of food but the leftovers never seem to go to waste.

As others suggested l tossed the ziti first with the sour cream, they may have been dry otherwise.  28 oz of sauce is enough however, I did add garlic.  The rest of the recipe was followed as written.

A good, basic recipe.  I put mine in two 8 x 8 dishes.   Cooked one, froze the other.  It could use a little tweaking to make it better, but it isn't bad at all just like it's written.

This is the best pasta I've ever eaten! I was a little leery of baking sour cream, but it is so delicious!The only things I changed were I made my own sauce and I only used about 45 oz of it total, a little less than the recipe called for and it was plenty. This recipe does make alot so if you are only cooking for two you will have tons of leftovers for the freezer.

Different than I was expecting, but fantastic! After reading many reviews, I tossed the pasta in the sour cream, browned my ground beef with italian seasoning, salt, & pepper, used 1 jar of italian sausage spaghetti sauce & 1 jar of mushroom spaghetti sauce, and increased both cheeses by about 2 ounces.  I made it all in 1 deep 9" x 13" pan and it barely fit. The result was very creamy, flavorful ziti - a ton of it! My husband and I ate it for 4 meals & still had nearly half a pan left. Next time I will try separating it into 2 smaller pans and maybe put some mozzarella on top (not just the parmesan) for a browned cheesy crust. Fantastic recipe!

GREAT dish! I also mixed the sour cream with the pasta and then layered the remaining ingredients. I made a double batch for our family of 5 and another family of 5. We only needed ONE batch...and that's with kids and adults alike going for seconds. Try this, we loved it!

This is the recipe I use.  So easy to make I was really skeptical the first time I tried it.  My only change is to skip the provolone and use all mozzarella but there are limitless possibilities for additions and ways to make this recipe your own... olives, veggies, a little jarred alfredo, different pasta.    My husband loves this and actually prefers it to my "takes all day" lasagne.  I line up all the ziti in little rows to make it neat and easy to serve but I don't think you have to take the time.  I usually serve this with a salad, green beans and garlic bread.

Great substitute for ricotta, family loved it.  I also mixed sour cream and parmesan with ziti before layering.   I used shredded italian cheese blend, ground turkey and homemade sauce. Even my hubby who swears he hates sour cream loved it.

I added some sausage--and did mix my noodles and sauce before laying it out in the pan...just so my noodles wouldn't be dry.  Great for left-overs also!! Thanks!

This was really good! I made it with leftover home made meat sauce. The fresh basil was really nice on this. I usually make ziti with ricotta but this is a good alternative. It seemed a bit lighter. I'll be making this again!

I'm a college student who doesn't have too much experience in the kitchen, but this recipe was easy to put together and turned out delicious! Even my boyfriend, who hates pasta, went back for more!

This recipe was ok.  I used Classico Fire Roasted Tomato & Garlic sauce.  Perhaps if I tried a different sauce I would've like this better.

This was by far the best recipe we've tried for Baked Ziti! My 10yr old couldn't get enough of it! The only change I would suggest is to use shredded mozzarella and tear the provolone into pieces - I was a little wary of the sour cream as I am a ricotta fan - but it was great!

I made spaghetti sauce with spiral pasta one night and had lots of everything left over so I decided to put this together on the same night and let it sit in the fridge until the next day. Really easy to put together as well. It is FANTASTIC!!! I added fresh herbs to my sauce (bit of parsley, oregano, and basil) and used KAY'S SPAGHETTI SAUCE from this site. I mixed the pasta spirals with the sour cream, grated cheddar and 1 egg as one reviewer suggested and it makes the noodles so creamy and delicious. Won't do it any other way from now on. I layered it pasta, sauce, sour cream, etc and finished the top with another layer of sour cream, grated parmesand and finely chopped basil. I also had a round of brie to use up (didn't have provolone) and dotted pieces of the cheese throughout the dish in the centre. Absolutely best ziti I've ever tasted. I also made the sour cream a little easier to spread evenly by mixing with a tablespoon or two of milk and mixing well, then spreading over the beef sauce. I put the chunks of brie on top of the beef sauce and my eldest child gave me the dirtiest glare when I said I ate all the leftovers.

Finally, great baked ziti in our home!  I don't know why it just never turns out for me, but this was really great. I subbed ricotta for half of the sour cream and always make homemade sauce & it was a cheesy, gooey, wonderful mess - just how baked ziti should be!  (If you will willfully risk burning yourself on hot, bubbly cheese, you've done it right!)

This recipe was very yummy however in my opinion 2 jars of sauce was way too much. My ziti was swimming in it. I also mixed my pasta with the sour cream as others did and that worked out perfectly. I will definately make this again but with much less sauce, maybe just one jar.

This is a great recipe!!! I used vodka cream sauce as well as italian sausage, make sure you coat the pasta in sour cream, it makes a huge difference.

Instead of a 9x13" pan, I divide this recipe into two smaller pans. One I pop in the oven and the other in the freezer. I can thaw it in the morning and cook it that night. It tastes just as good as the first one.

Excellent!!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and tossed the pasta and sour cream together and used sausage in place of ground beef. I did not have any fresh basil, so I used dried basil, oregano and garlic salt in between the layers. The spaghetti sauce I used had green peppers and mushrooms.   Everyone raved!  I will be using this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was absolutely delicious! Makes a full 3 quart pan, almost overflowing. I added a can of sliced mushrooms. I also used more cheese than it called for. Cheese is never a bad thing! I took another reviewer's suggestion and tossed the pasta with the sour cream prior to layering. I think this is a must because it made the dish creamy and nice. I did use the 2 jars of sauce, but looking back, I think it would have been better with more like 1 or 1.5 jars. There was a bit much sauce. I baked it for exactly the time called for and the top was nice and golden. It was so good!

I thought this was really good. Few changes i made, i tossed the pasta w/ the sour cream, and i fried the hamburger and onion together all at once as opposed to cooking the hamburger and then the onion and i also seasoned the meat w/ some garlic salt.

Excellent dish and reheats nicely for  leftovers. I used a 9x13 glass baking dish (worked great) and 1.5 lbs. of lean ground beef. I like a meatier sauce, and this worked well.

As others recommended, I should have coated the pasta with the sour cream (next time!). This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Yummo!  this was great, easy and delicious!  I have made recipes like this in the past and they were really dry, this was NOT!  I followed one reviewer who recommended to mix the sour cream with the pasta and then do the layers- it was fantastic and so moist!  This will be a weekday staple in our house, thanks a ton!  Oh- I added fennel seeds to the ground beef for a little sausage flavor.

I made this last night and it was a hit. My husband who hates when I try to change things on him, loved it. He wanted to know why it wasn't as dry as my normal baked ziti. I did mix the sour cream with my pasta before layering and I doubled the sauce.  This will replace my old ziti recipe!

This was SO good and made enough for many leftover plates! I took the advice others mentioned about mixing the sour cream with the noodles - a MUST. I also mixed about 1/2 lb ground pork because I had it on hand and my husband likes a lot of meat.
This recipe was super easy and SO GOOD.

This was really good. I accidentally added all of the cheese in the first layer, but still turned out great. My whole family loved it. I used sweet venison sausage for the beef & dried basil(my store didn't have fresh)I also added the sour cream to the pasta as other had & dolloped some as I layered it too. It does make a lot. It fed my family of 6 & we will have enough leftovers for tomorrow for a quick dinner. Thanks

Would have given it 5 stars, because it was so darned tasty, but I used my own recipe for spagetti sauce.  A jar spagetti sauce?  My goodness!! That's the best part.  Try any sauces on this site.. a far cry better than from a jar!  I was skeptical about the sour cream, but gave it a go.. it was delish.  Other than the sauce, didn't change a thing.. (OK, I snuck in some extra cheese) so sue me!

This was so good!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I forgot to get fresh basil, so I used dried and it still turned out great.  I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it.  I also love that it is so simple. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I love this recipe!  The first time I made it, I made it exactly like the recipe called for.  Everyone just loved it.  The next time, I added spices to the sauce, just as I would when making spaghetti.  I added Italian seasoning, a little hot sause for a kick, garlic and spaghetti seasonings.  It was so good me and my husband ate the entire pan in 2 days.

This has replaced my old recipe. The family loved it so it's a keeper. Next time I may add some Italian sausage, not that it needs it though. Great recipe!

Excellent!!! I made this last night for dinner and followed the recipe as is... it was GREAT!! Can't wait to eat it again for lunch today. Only thing is it makes way more than 8 servings (I guess serving size is subjective). I'm bringing leftovers to Basketball Playoffs Game 6 for my buddies to enjoy.

Recipe is very good. I made it for a buffet of 60. Changes that I made were to added additional marinara sauce to the Ziti after it was cooked and then did the layering, this kept the dish moist- I also did the sauce first in the layering before the cheese.  Had rave reviews - definately will make this dish again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made it three times and each time my family has loved it.  I used Classico for the tomato sauce; Florentine Spinach and Cheese for one jar and Italian Sausage for the other.  I used the sausage sauce to mix with the ground hamburger because it adds great flavor, and the other jar I used just to moisten the pasta with before layering into the dish. I also sprinkled basil on top of the whole dish, but it's not crucial (just makes it a little tastier, I think).  This is the best recipe I've found on the website-- definitely a keeper.

We really liked this once I added more sauce.  The problem was not with the recipe but with changing the amount of servings.  When I changed the amount to 4 servings it changed everything but the amount of pasta.  I didn't realize it until we had already eaten 1/2 of it & we both thought it was dry.  So watch your amounts if you change the servings.

I used "Kay's Spaghetti and Lasagna Sauce" instead of jarred sauce...It made all the difference!! If i used jarred sauce the rating would be much lower since sauce is the most important in all baked pasta dishes. Sour cream was nice and cheap but i may try it with ricotta or a cheese and sour cream blend since it didn't seem to mix great in the oven. All in all I like the recipe as a base with room to make individual changes without straying to far from the basic.

I do like using the sour cream instead of riccota-it's a texture thing. Great dish to serve to a crowd and I can prepare it in advance shich allows me to enjoy time with my guests.  Thank you.

I am assuming this recipe is amazing because I made it for a party and everyone DEVOURED it. Even I didnt get to try it! But they said it was amazing: rich, creamy, and indulgent. The only change I made was softening the onion in butter and oil because I didnt use meat. I also put a little bit of the sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before the first layer of pasta just so the whole thing would stay moist.

Spectacular and easy! This was a fabulous recipe that I will make again and again. The 9x13 was filled to the top, so you're going to have leftovers. I did season my beef with dried minced onion and garlic powder, and I also used a packaged shredded "pizza" cheese mixture in addition to a smoked mozzerella, which turned out just fine. 

I would say that adding a layer of sauce to the bottom is a must. If you like chunkier sauce, add a can of diced tomatoes to your sauce for variety...it turns out well and adds complexity. I used sauce containing Italian sausage as did another reviewer, which made a noticable difference. I sprinkled parsley atop the finished product and served....WOW! This was so easy and tastes great, not to mention it saves money with all the leftovers. Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe, Susan!

SO GOOD!  I brought this to a potluck and everyone LOVED it.  I was really skeptical about the sour cream (I love ricotta) and about using "slices" of cheese... but it came out amazing... especially w/ the provolone and fresh basil. I followed the recipe completely, but did coat the noodles first w/ half the sour cream, so they wouldn't dry out. It makes a ridiculous amount of food, so be prepared!!!

My husband requests this recipe all the time now... to the point that I'm getting sick of it! LOL

We use sausage, and then instead of sliced mozseralla and provolone we use the Sargento's bag of mixed shredded mozzeralla and provolone cheese. I also use a bit more sour cream then needed and it is just so tasty and cheesy/creamy!  I love that it makes a ton which means left overs and no cooking the next night!

We made this for my brother and his wife the first night home from having a baby and I later found out that my brother called home to my mom and told her how great of a cook I was and that they loved the ziti I made and they should have me make it for them!  You know it's good when it warrents a call home from your brother!

I made this for a family gathering… and my sisters refused to leave without left-overs! I love the addition of fresh basil (different from my old Baked Ziti recipe.) My only adjustment as to use ½ ground turkey and ½ Italian turkey sausage for the meat. Thanks, Susan!

This was wonderful!  I've made many baked zitis but thought this one had a great flavor.  I seasoned my cooked ground beef with some garlic powder and italian seasoning.  I think it's the provolone that makes this dish so tasty so definitely go with the sliced and don't skimp.  I used shredded mozz because it's what I had on hand. I cut back on the sour cream using only about 1 cup of low fat.  I only used about 1-1/2 jars of sauce (26 oz. each).  This was plenty saucy for us. The end result was perfect.  Thanks for this submission Susan.

This tastes like traditional baked ziti. It is delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and didn't use any onion. I covered with foil for the first 25 min. of baking and then removed the foil for the last 5 min. I will definitley make this again.

This made way more than just my husband & I could eat, but it was great heated up the next 3 days.  :P  I used ground turkey and added plenty of oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil and parsley.  Also, I had some left over Greek-style yogurt that worked fine for the sour cream.  I'll definitely make this again when I've got a lot of people to feed!

Yummy this was pretty good! i did tweek it a little well maybe alot, I just got finished making and eating this not even 30 mins. ago.I did it different. I boiled 16 oz. of noodles and browned my my meat I added a small bell pepper and minced garlic as well as italian seasoning, chopped onion, and pepper, let it simmer for 15 minutes. Once I drained the noodles I placed them in a pan that I sprayed with cooking spray. I placed the noodles in the pan and spread prob. about 14 oz. of sour cream over the noodles, topped with the sauce and then took mozzarella cheese, shredded cheddar cheese, and a mexican mix placed it in a bowl added italian seasoning and garlic powder mixed well and then put it atop the sauce. I only used one jar of sauce and will use 2 the next time. I DIDN'T cover with aluminum foil because all i need to do was melt the cheese, served with home made garlic bread and it was a hit.I will make it again and might even try next time with cream cheese!!

AWESOME recipe!!!  MY husband and son raved about this meal even when we ate it as leftovers.  We had a party catered over the holidays and one of the items was baked ziti and it was the hit of the party.  My husband thought this ziti was even better than the caterers!

AWESOME!!! I have been making this since the beginning of this year. Everyone that taste it wants the recipe and loves it. I hate giving up how easy it because it looks like I slaved away all day!

I used half sour cream & half ricotta cheese with one egg added. Omitted the meat & added fresh garlic to the sauce. This could not have been better.  Very creamy and flavorful. I thought I would have left overs because it made a lot but my guests ate it all!  So easy and wonderful.

So good! The provolone makes it! I did toss the pasta in the sauce before layering with the cheese so it would be juicy. Made it without meat and it was delicious--next time will do as another suggested and make two smaller pans, one for eating now and one for freezing.

I really enjoyed this baked ziti, and will use this recipe in the future in place of my old one.  My only change was to use less sour cream (probably about 1 cup) and it was reduced fat.  I thought the provolone cheese gave this ziti a different depth of flavor.  Beware, this makes a lot!  But, my husband and I thought the leftovers were very good- not too dry like leftover pasta can be.

Really good! I just made my usual speghetti sauce (Sun Dried tomatoe sauce, a little hot sauce, a bunch of garlic, red onion, a little black bean with ginger and garlic sauce, ect ect...) I also added some cream cheese, and some cottage cheese to the sour cream mixture. I then topped it off with cheddar and parm. Very tasty! Loved it :)

I would really like to give this 4-1/2 stars!  This dish was delicious.  I was a bit skeptical about sour cream, which I, personally, don't normally like.  However, it worked into this recipe very well.  Only problem was I couldn't find "ziti" -- so I made this with rigatoni.  Superb!!!!!

Yum! This was great - wasn't sure what to make of the sour cream, when I was putting it together, but it came out rich and delicious.
Yes, it made a lot, but that was a lucky break, as we had two unexpected guests for dinner the night I made this!

This was very tasty.  I served it last night when I had my daughter and her son for dinner.  Very easy to do.  The only suggestion I would add is that the directions specify a 2 quart casserole.  However I found that a 2 quart casserole would not hold the quantity after everything is put together.  Would recommend changing instructions to read layering everything in a rectangular baking dish.  I had to use (2) 2qt. casseroles because there was so much. Real comfort food.
Thanks.

This was awesome!  I substituted italian sausage instead of hamburger.  The fresh basil really adds to the flavor.  My picky eater husband loves this and wants this on our Top Ten list!

Very good, although I changed it alot, it survived.  Used ground turkey, mozz instead of provolone, and cut back on the sour cream.

I used 2 bags of Sargentos Mozzerella Bistro Blend in place of the plain provolone & mozzarella. Otherwise I did everything else the same.  Oh! And I used a chunky Barilla style sauce.  Purely decadent comfort food!!  ...THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! 
Update!  This time, I sauteed a green pepper and some garlic with the meat, beat an egg and then beat it in with a 15oz container of ricotta and used that instead of sour cream.  Yum!  BTW - Is same recipe as Baked Ziti I, but with more parmesan & basil...

This is excellent. It makes a huge batch, so I made it in two pans and froze one for later. I used 2 lbs. ground beef and about twice as much cheese as called for. Also, I added a can of sliced black olives and a can of sliced mushrooms (both drained well), and I added a chopped green pepper with the onion. Mine was definitely Baked Ziti Supreme. Very good!

I cut the servings to 6, used one large can of good tomato sauce and 1 can diced tomatoes.  Didn't have provolone so I upped the mozzarella a little bit.  Yum.

This is outstanding! It makes a lot so I split it up and took it to a friend's house. Both families loved it. I made it two nights ago and my 17 yr. old son asked me to make it again tonight. I'm going to make him wait a week.
Very easy and you can't mess it up!

This was so easy (and very tasty) my husband made it.  I used the exact recipe and the fresh basil is a must.  I also used fresh marinara sauce found at the store instead of jar.

I use half beef half hot Italian sausage. For the filling I use half ricotta and half sour cream.  Never thought to use sour cream in such a dish but I will never make ziti, lasagna or similar dishes again without using it! I use my homemade spaghetti sauce if I have some on hand.  thank you for such a wonderful recipe!  oh and it makes a HUGE batch!   Enough to fill a 9x13 and a smaller batch for the freezer.

We loved this! I took the advice of another reader and mixed the pasta with the meat sauce, laid 1/2 down, cover with provolone, spread sour cream, layer the other 1/2 pasta meat mixture, cover with mozzarella and topped with Parmesan. YUM!!!!

I mixed the sour cream with the noodles before layering.  Kept the noodles moist.  This tasted so yummy!  I added extra cheese just by a little bit.  My family loved it, and great leftovers for the next day!

I used ground chicken, and penne rigate noodles as I couldn't find any ziti in my walmart. Due to the size difference (I think) it was nearly overflowing my largest casserole dish! I had it in a baking tray in case it dropped while cooking (it didn't).
It was absolutely delicious. Will make it again for sure.

I made this as per the recipe with the tip to mix the sour cream with the warm pasta.  It was a big hit for my group potluck lunch.  I also used Italian flavored turkey sausage.  The leftovers are also great warmed up the next day.  This is definitely a family keeper recipe.

A KEEPER!
A delicious meal. I didnt use provolone cheese because I didnt have any.  I used mozzarella and parmesan in the dish and on top.  I also used whole wheat pasta. I didnt think I would like the whole wheat pasta in this dish because of the texture but took a chance anyway. I couldnt tell the difference so I'll keep this substitution. I used a 11×14 dish and both jars of spahaghetti sauce. I know many people said its too much but my family love cheese and I knew it would be on the drier side without extra sauce. It was prefect! So if you use the amount of cheese listed in this recipe, you will not need 2 jars but I used 6 oz shredded parmesan and nearly 4 cups shredded mozzarella Also, the suggestion to add the sour cream to the pasta first is genius- it makes the dish nice and creamy! I topped with dry basil- didnt have fresh. Even with the larger 11x14 dish on 350, it was still done in 30 minutes. Next time I will make sure I have provolone. I think it will be more delicious but even without it, it's a 5 star recipe.

My kids love this. I think it’s a little dry so I add about a half jar of extra sauce and use 16oz of sour cream. It’s easy though and the family asked for it regularly.

I haven't had baked ziti in ages. So I made this dish and only swapped the ground beef with ground turkey which is so much healthier and tastier. It came out so good and delicious. I would love to make it again and try the other ziti recipes out later this year.

I made it the original way several times and it was a bit hit!  I then changed the recipe to add sweet Italian sausage and extra cheese.  I usually double the recipe and put half in the freezer.  It is unbelievable how well this freezes.  This has become a favorite of our large family gatherings.

I substituted sweet Italian sausage for half of the ground beef, added 3 cloves of garlic, mixed the cooked ziti with 1 cup of the sour cream and used the remaining half cup of sour cream to spread between the layers of ziti. Thank you for the base recipe. Excellent dish. This is definitely a keeper.

This was so good! I made some tweaks based on other reviewers recommendations. I used mild Italian sausage rather than ground beef. I added a good amount of minced garlic and Italian seasoning to the sausage. I also mixed in the sour cream with the cooked noodles. This kept the noodles from drying out. I’ll be making this again!

Made my own sauce with italian sausage.   I did mix the sour cream with the macaroni like someone else suggested.   This was the best baked ziti I've ever had or made.  My family loved it.  Was a little worried about the sour cream, but it was great.

AMAZING!! I made this tonight and followed the tips other reviewers suggested, ie. used beef and salsiccia, mixed the sour cream in the noodles, seasoned the beef while browning, and sauced the first noodle layer. I also used shredded mozzarella and Italian blend then topped with parm. This is now a family favorite!

Great everything. Couldn’t find zitti so substituted another pasta. 8” casserole dish easily fed 6. Added a little Marsala to top things off.

I made one change which was mentioned by another member here, I mixed the sour cream into the drained ziti noodles. Cooked it uncovered the whole time at the recipe time and temp. My Wifey and the Teen both chowed down and LOVED IT! Ohhh Yeahhh... IT'S A KEEPER!

Was a very big winner. I substituted one half of the sour cream with one half Greek yogurt! Will last for two meals for sure. I also used link pork Italian sausage that I cut up in half inch slices and browned first (just like you would ground beef or ground Italian sausage).

The only change I made was to toss the cooked, drained ziti in a couple big dollops of sour cream to keep it moist. I gave this casserole to my family members and it got rave reviews!

YUM - YUM - YUMMMM!  I made this the other night, with italian sausage instead of ground beef. I also took the advice of another reviewer & mixed the sour cream into the cooked noodles before layering (GREAT TIP!), used my 3.7 QT 9x13 glass baking dish...filled it perfectly! Hubby LOVED it as did I!  DEFINITELY keeping this recipe in my dinner loop - thanks for posting it!

I made this exactly the way the  recipe  read.  It was very tasty and had good form to it. I really liked the sour cream taste . I’ve always used ricotta cheese but I prefer the sour cream. It gave it a smoother consistency and a better flavor. Very good recipe!

The recipe calls for a 2 qt. baking dish but when assembled, there was way too much for a 2 qt. dish, so I used a 3 qt. Which was fine.

As suggested by other reviewers I added the sour cream to the pasta before assembling the dish.  Used hot Italian sausage rather than ground beef since we had that on hand.  It turned out very delicious.  Terrific recipe  - thanks!

I cut this in half because I wanted to try before I took it to a pot luck  or served to guests.  I enjoyed very much and put the left overs into small containers to freeze.  I used different cheeses but it still was very good.

I used Bertolli Tomatoo Basil sauce, Mild Sausage, 2 cloves garlic, 1.5 Tbl Italian Seasoning and a shake or 2 of Crushed Red Pepper. Easy to cook, assmble & bake.  Very flavorful. This is our new go-to when the Kid, grandkids and great grandkids come to visit.

I prepared this as written and we all really enjoyed it.
However, I HALVED the recipe and it barely fit into a 2 qt. 8x8" casserole dish.
I believe this is meant for a 13x9 pan especially when the recipe says it serves 8.

It is delicious, hubby and adult kids devoured it and are looking forward to leftovers!!  I followed the recipe as is, cooked the noodles per the time listed in recipe instead of pasta box, buttered the bottom and sides of the pan to avoid sticking, and used a 9x13 which was filled to the brim.  I used a spoon on the insides of the pan to help the sauce settle into the cracks a bit.  I didn't add seasonings or anything, just made the dish as is.  It was truly delish and a must make again dish!!

This is not a traditional baked Ziti. No ground beef ( diced ham), no sour cream ( Ricotta cheese) no hard boiled eggs  .... I stopped reading after that. Just because  It’s baked doesn’t make it “ baked ziti “. Try a original it is out of this world good, in my opinion.  I was disappointed in this one. JMLV

Our family loves it! Leftovers were even better. Used a pound Italian sausage and a pound ground beef. 3 24 ounce jars sauce and a little extra pasta to compensate. So delicious and made a lot for my large hungry family that handed out a lot of compliments.

I had never made “real” ziti before. This was excellent. I followed the recipe except that I added more meat, primarily because i wanted to use everything I had. I used hot sausage and burger meat, 1 pound each, so doubled the amount of meat. The result was a very tasty, meaty, delicious baked ziti. My sons ask for more “white stuff” next time so I may add more sour cream next time around. It was a little time consuming, mostly because of the meat. We loved it though. Even better as leftovers w some additional sauce to revive it a bit.

So DELICIOUS! I changed it up a bit to fit my family’s taste buds. I sautéed green bell pepper and onion in olive oil and used turkey meat instead of ground beef. To that mixture I added different spices such as Italian seasoning, seasoning salt, parsley, and cumin. I also chopped up fresh garlic and let that simmer in with the pasta sauce. I tossed the noodles in olive oil before I started to layer everything. And did not add the parm cheese until the last 5 minutes. My family LOVED this, paired with salad and garlic bread.

We loved this recipe. I used one jar of Mid’s Sauce -32oz and I didn’t use so much sour cream. I didn’t measure how much Sour cream I used, I just spread a layer on top. I also sprinkled Parmesan on top of the mozzarella layers.   I will definitely make this again!

This was my first try at this dish. We were very pleased. Next time, however, I will buy ricotta. I would prefer it to the sour cream I used as a substitute.  Very much worth trying.

So delicious!! I followed the advice of the reader who mixed the pasta and meat sauce together. I also doubled the fresh basil. I put one layer of pasta mixture, then a layer of provolone, sprinkled grated Parmesan, the sour cream, added a sprinkle of fresh basil. Then i added the pasta mixture, mozzarella cheese and a final sprinkle of Parmesan. Finally, I sprinkled the top with the fresh basil. DO NOT skip the fresh basil!!  It makes a huge difference!! I used a 11x14 pan and it was wall to wall!! So very Yummy!! Truly an awesome recipe!!

I used seasoned ground turkey and a sauce that had sausage in it. The other jar of sauce was tomato basil because i left out the fresh basil for thriftiness. I only did one layer in a 9x13. Layered the noodles, the cheese slices, then poured the sauce over and covered with Parmesan. Use both jars of sauces or it gets a little dry during storage.

I made this as a dinner for a colleague and her family who is recovering from some medical problems.  I made it pretty much according to the recipe directions.  The changes I did make were minor: 
1) I put the onions in the pan to saute a few minutes before adding the ground beef, to ensure they were cooked enough and not crunchy still.  
2) I did spice up the meat and onions with some salt, peper, garlic, basil and oregano (as other reviews recommended).
3) I mixed the pasta and sauce in a big bowl and then just scooped half of that into the pan, layered mozzarrella and sour cream, and then scooped the rest of the pasta over that and layered the provolone and sour cream.  
Very easy and it made A LOT.  It will fit in a standard 9x13 but would work better in a deeper lasagna dish.  My co-worker said it was delicious and they had enough left over for another meal.
I will definitely make this again!  Makes a nice potluck or meal gift.

This is delicious!! I wasn’t sure what to do with the sour cream so I mixed it into the spaghetti and meat mixture before layering. Pretty sure I wasn’t supposed to do that but it’s so yummy!!!!  Also, as many of the reviews note this absolutely does not fit in a 2QT dish. Mine was 3 and was full to just above the rim!

This is an excellent recipe.  I changed absolutely nothing, no modifications needed at all, and I've made it probably about 5-6 times.  It's still great left over and good for a larger crowd.  Would recommend to anyone.  Enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was fairly simple to prepare and turned out delicious!!  The sour cream was a nice addition and really seemed like ricotta cheese but with a more mild taste.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this as written, except I did toss the ziti with the sour cream. This is excellent!  I have made this numerous times   Everyone loves it. I made it for a lunch at work and people thought it came from a restaurant.  Great recipe!

I've made this baked ziti many times exactly as it is written, minus the meat. We just prefer meatless dishes... And since half of my family is gluten-free, I make two 8 x 8 dishes - one with regular pasta, the other gluten-free pasta. I split everything evenly into each casserole dish. It is so easy to make and pleases everyone in my family.

I make this every time a friend has a baby (and isn't a vegetarian). I agree with the step of tossing the pasta in the sour cream. It keeps the noodles from drying out. Amazing every time and super easy.

Really good and so easy to make. 

The only change I made was to sprinkle a little Italian seasoning on my beef. I also layered differently because of the reviews. I mixed all the sauce with the pasta. One half of that mixture went into my pan. I layered provolone, sour cream and mozzarella and then put the rest of the pasta mixture on top. I sprinkled the parm and extra mozz that I had on hand on the very top.

YUM! I was looking for a way to use ingredients I had on hand (as usual) and came across this recipe. I love that it was so adaptable and surprisingly delicious. I used the 8 ounces penne I had on hand, ground chuck, 3 pre cooked sausage patties (thawed and chopped up), a sautéed onion and garlic,  extra cheese, 2 jars of spaghetti sauce. I was afraid that my mozzarella and casserole blend cheeses would be bland, so I added lots of grated Parmesan and Italian seasonings. Like other reviewers suggested, I tossed the cooked pasta with the sour cream before layering. This made two full 8 x8 inch casseroles (one for the freezer, one for now) plus one mini casserole for my single neighbor. I put chopped fresh basil from my windowsill on top. Delicious!  I love the versitility of this recipe, it would be great for potlucks,  and I will try it with different flavors of spaghetti sauces and cheeses.  Although it will be hard to beat this combo. This one is a keeper!

next time will NOT use  a no-salt organic marinara sauce and will add chopped garlic together with the onion.  then it will be perfect!!  I did mix the sauce with the ziti as some suggested so had no problem with dryness.  I refrigerated it and baked it the next day.  (rested on counter 30 minutes before baking)

I did a few alterations, only because I didn't have all the ingredients in the house.  Added sausage instead of ground beef, and used Italian mixed cheese instead of just mozzarella.  Hubby liked it the first night, LOVED it the second.  This one is definitely on my make ahead list.

I did it differently! I used a very large pot to brown 1 lb. of mixed hot and regular Italian sausage.  Then I added the onion, basil, Italian seasoning, a little olive oil, fresh crushed garlic, crushed red pepper, salt and pepper to same pot and sautéed it.  Meanwhile, I mixed the sour cream (2 cups), 10oz each of mozzarella and provolone cheese, 3/4 cup grated parmesan in a huge bowl. When meat and onions were done i poured the spaghetti sauce and 1 can diced tomatoes into it and heated it through. When the meat and sauce mixture was heated through i poured it into the cheese mixture in the huge bowl. Mixed it all up well and poured most of it into one 10 x9x2 foil pan filling it to within a 1/2" of the top. The rest i put in a smaller casserole (pyrex) dish. I topped both with more mozzarella, parmesan and provolone cheese. I froze the large pan for later and cooked the smaller one.  Was very good and plenty moist as I like it.

I have made this too many times to count and it always turns out great. I have made variations of this recipe as well. Sometimes I add ground beef, onions, and red wine to improve the sauce. Sometimes I cook and slice Italian sausages and add those as a layer. Sometimes I add extra cheese. This recipe is very adaptable as well as quick and easy to make.

Wonderful.  I kept to the recipe, but assembled differently.  Combining the hot drained pasta with the sour cream and half of the mozzarella ensure an incredibly creamy texture.  This is easy, quick, and so good.

I made this it was really good all my kids even ate it which is hard to do. I did what some others suggested and mixed the sour cream with the noodles. You have to do that every bite was so creamy. I also used sausage because my husband wanted me to but would have been just as good with beef.

This is a favorite go to dish for me. It is fairly quick to make and everybody in my house loves it. I took the advice of another reviewer and I use half Italian sausage and half ground beef and it gives a really great flavor. Otherwise I followed everything exactly. The great thing is if you doublet you can put one in the freezer and we can eat off of another one for 2 to 3 dinners. It makes quite a lot and with a nice salad and some good garlic bread it's bound to please everyone.

I followed the recipe, but my boyfriend chose marinara sauce instead of "spaghetti" sauce. We used extra lean ground beef and no sausage. Overall, the taste was very bland. I did add garlic and oregano to the ground beef and onions as the sauce had no flavor to it (my mistake). In the end, it smelled delicious but had no flavor. I think I may try a higher fat count in the beef next time and also bake in a 9x13 dish. I had a LOT of extra sauce using a 2.75 baking dish. I should have also tossed the ziti with the sour cream. My boyfriend seemed to like it, but I wouldn't make it again without some adjustments.

This was so delicious!! I used mild Italian sausage instead of the beef. I also took someone's suggestion and added the sour cream to the pasta.  Everyone in my household loved it!

I only had Gluten free Ziti from Walmart (actually doesn't taste bad).  I had 4 C spaghetti sauce that  I had frozen and did the following:  Split all in half (ziti, spag sauce and cheese ( 1 lb Mozarella and 3/4 C Parmesan will make 2 dinners, one for now and one for later (2 people).
Grease small baking dish, stir some sour cream with the ziti and place in dish.  Add half of the sauce, top with half of the Mozarella, sprinkle with dried basil.  Add remaining ziti , top with remaining spaghetti sauce, Mozarella and Parmesan.  Bake 350 until done, arond 30 min.  Freeze other half of everything for another easy dinner.

Great recipe.  I did use 1/2 lb Hamburg and 1/2 lb sweet Italian sausage. That was the only change I made.  Will definitely make again.

I help my daughter make this recipe for a school project and she says everyone loved it! She said her teacher loves it so much, that he took what was left home with him. And, of course, she received an A for her grade. I did as a reviewer recommended and tossed the pasta with the sour cream and was told it was very creamy! Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I made according to recipe except that I stirred the sour cream into the pasta like the others suggested. I will make this dish again; the family liked it.  Next time, however, I will add fresh garlic, a few more spices, and chop some zucchini to add. Overall, solid dish!

I made this and removed the ground beef to make it vegetarian. I could've used Morningstar crumbles but just didn't feel like going to the store (these should be a staple in any vegetarian household anyway). My family Loved it!

Everyone loved this.  I skipped the meat and onion but used part "easy pizza sauce" from Allrecipes to boost the marinara a bit.  I also mixed the pasta with the sour cream as others suggested.

This is amazing I have made it more then once! I took a whole 16 ounce container of sour cream and mixed it with the ziti noodles after I drained them. It seemed to keep the noodles moist! I will definitely make this over and over! Our family gives it 5 thumbs up!!!

My family loved the ziti, but everyone, even the cheese lovers, agreed there was too much cheese.  They would like it made again, but with less cheese next time.  It also made a huge batch.  We got about 12 servings out of it.

Because the comments said that this recipe was so large I halved it. I also follow the suggestions to mix the sour cream with the pasta.  I used Italian turkey sausage instead of hamburger and whole grain pasta. This was very delicious and it was even better when I had left over.

The whole family loved it, I followed the recipe with only a few exceptions. 1st I used 8oz of both of the cheeses and also used much more parmesan cheese, probably close to a cup or so. Also seasoned the beef with some garlic, salt, pepper and some dried basil. this one is a keeper.

It was good; probably would have been better if my husband had covered the ziti in the oven. The top was a little dry. Omitted the meat since some of my coworkers don't eat meat.

Better than lasagna! My whole family loves itttt!!! Thanks so much for the recipe and all the helpful tips from other reviewers! I didn't chop the basil leaves! I torn them and the flavor is amazing! Plus, I covered with loose aluminum foil for 20' to keep the food moist then removed the rest 10' to get that browny burnt cheese on top. It's amazingly good! I didn't have sour cream on hand so I replaced with cream cheese and it was perfect for us!

I didn't have any Parmesan, so I just used mozzarella on the top instead. I used dried basil instead of fresh, and onion powder (onion-hating household here) still tastes GREAT!

This is one of my favorites. Mixing the sour cream with the Ziti first was a great tip. I like to substitute Italian sausage for the ground beef.

Excellent as written! Only change I made was in the layering; placed all provalone and sour cream on first layer and all mozzerella, basil and parmessan on top layer. Baked 20 minutes covered and then uncovered until bubbly. Mmmmm. Yields a large quantity so will be freezing some for another day.

I made this recipe basically as written - I had bowtie pasta on hand so I used that, I didn't have provolone so I used all mozzarella, and I left out the basil.  I tend to just wing it when I am cooking and use what is on hand.  My husband really liked this pasta. I'll definitely make this one again.  So easy and he was impressed.  I made it up to the point of baking then left it on the counter a little while waiting for him to be closer to finishing working so it would be hot when he got home.  I think you could refrigerate and bake at a later time to make it more convenient as well.

Took this to church potluck tonight.  It was a great hit.  The only changes I made was I used penne pasta because my little grocery did not have ziti; I added fresh sauteed mushrooms to the sauce; and, like others, I mixed the sour cream with the pasta prior to assembly.  It filled a 9 x 13 pan to the brim!

I just made this tonight for the second time, but this time I did it vegetarian: used veggie crumbles in place of beef and RiceCheeze in place of the cheeses. Hands down the best thing I've eaten since becoming a vegetarian! Oh my goodness! 5 stars :D

Great recipe. There was no way I could have ever made it fit into the suggested 2 quart baking dish, I ended up filling a 3 quart AND a 2 quart dish so I couldn't use the layering method unfortunately.

I have been making this for years and this recipe is pretty much what I do.I use whatever cheese is in my fridge,whatever meat and sometimes mix what types of pasta depending on what is in the house.Sometimes half ziti and half some other such as penne...One variation is to add sliced Polish sausage,mmm yummy!

I cut the recipe down to half since only two of us were going to eat it and because it was a new recipe for us.  We both loved it and wished we had made the full amount so we could freeze some for next week.  My husband isn't a fan of sour cream, but we were both pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of it keeping the pasta moist when they were tossed together, but with very little taste of sour cream.

This is a great recipe. I use it every time I make ziti. I tossed the ziti with the sour cream before layering. It comes out great every time.

I make this with Italian sausage instead of ground beef and am always asked for the recipe.  It has become a staple for late Thanksgiving dinner when everyone is tired of turkey!

Use an interesting sauce (like a caramelized onion Cabernet blend) and this will be off the charts. Am going to try tossing the pasta with the sour cream next time.

This was very good! I did what other people suggested and mixed the sour cream with the noodles. It was pretty easy to make, but I wish I would have used a bigger baking dish or packed the noodles down more.  I used less sauce than was called for (about 36 oz) and everything was still overflowing in my oven.

I make this dish every Christmas instead of Lasagna and my family absolutely loves it.  In fact they'd never head of Ziti until made this dish.  I don't deviate from the recipe and it's scrumptious, just enough cheese, sauce, etc.

This was the best baked ziti recipe I have ever made!  It was great as written.  The only change I made, was to mix the ziti with the sour cream, as suggested by others ( it does make a difference doing it that way) and I used homemade pasta sauce.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was my first time cooking baked ziti so I followed the directions as they are. The only thing I did different was mixed the sour cream with the pasta and I did add Italian seasoning to the meat. The whole family loved it! My husband kept on asking for more! Great recipe

We thought it was great- even with gluten free noodles!  I took the advice of others and tossed the noodles with sour cream first, GREAT ADVICE. This will be a family favorite for a long time.

We really enjoyed this.  I made a few changes, using whole wheat pasta and used onion sour cream in place of regular.  This was so creamy and so yummy!  I did what someone else had suggested and mixed the pasta and sour cream together.  Yummy!

Excellent flavor--almost worth the high calories.  Use slightly less cheese, homemade marinara.

Since I'm cooking for one, I cut the recipe in half, and had enough for 4 meals. I did toss the ziti with the sour cream as someone else suggested. I skipped the onion and added some fresh mushrooms. Will definitely make this again!

Basically I followed the recipe (except I chose different cheeses in a greater quantity) and I agree with the other reviews ... toss the ziti around in the sour cream before layering. Awesome meal!

I didn't follow the recipe completely because I had a bunch of random packs of cheese with small amounts left in them. So for me, this recipe worked well as a way to use up leftover shredded/sliced cheeses, I also added dried red pepper flakes to the sauce for a little spice and it was very tasty.

This was amazing! I did add sour cream before layering but that was the only thing I did different from the recipe. This is now a family favorite and gets requested by the little ones!

This is a winner.  Even have made it in the crock pot.  Made this recipe as is, but I did toss the pasta with the sour cream.  I have used Italian sausage and other kinds of pasta too.

I love this as is, but it is equally yummy turned into a one-pot meal. It's very flexible, and it's something deliciously different than yet similar to traditional spaghetti.

This was easy and delicious!  I will never make lasagna again.  The sour cream takes the place of ricotta.  I took the other suggestions and mixed the sour cream in with the noodles.  Six of us ate tonight and still have plenty of left overs.

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes. Pretty much made it the way it says other then one change (mixed a little bit of the sauce with the pasta) to keep it from sticking. Turned out fantastic. It makes quite a bit but it's not a bad thing when you run your own daycare...the kiddies LOVED the leftovers :)

I did like this recipe.  I took the advice of another member and tossed the pasta in the sour cream instead of trying to layer it.  I will make this again.

Very good and relatively easy to make.  The only change I would make is cut back on the amount of tomato sauce used and strain some off the sauce juices otherwise it'll be a little runnier.  The sour cream is what made this dish.

I Was skeptical about the sour cream in this recipe, but it was delicious. I took others advice and mixed it with the noodles. I also used Rao's sauce with Italian sausage and mushrooms. It's a bit expensive, but very good and it saves time! I will make this again for sure!

I customized this recipe to my families taste.  I left out the ground meat, onion and basil bc I either didn't have it or don't like it.   I used the sour cream to coat the ziti noodles after I cooked them and added a layer of cottage cheese on top of the noodles instead of Ricotta (stole from a dif recipe) with a little parmesan cheese.  I used Paul Newmans Sockarooni Sauce which gave great flavor and poured over top the noodles and cottage cheese mix.  Added shredded Mozzarella cheese and baked it in the oven.  Tasted great and even better the second day.  We revived the leftovers by adding more cheese on top of cold noodles and placed back in the oven not the microwave to heat up.  My daughter asked me to make this again.

This was awesome!! The whole family loved it!

It makes enough for about 3 meals.

I did toss the noodles in the sour cream and I did not add the basil as I didn't want the taste to be too overpowering for the kids.

yumm!  I also mixed the sour cream with the pasta and used a little more cheese than the recipe called for.  The jars of sauce I had were 24 oz each but seemed plenty.  Very hearty and wonderful comfort food!

I really liked this recipe, I did as others suggested and tossed the pasta in the sour cream first and I also only needed 1 jar of sauce.  I also didn't have provolone so I just used mozzarella.  I didn't give it 5 stars because we didn't LOVE it, but it still was really good.

Yum!  Easy, fast and delicious!  I followed one of the suggestions of tossing the pata with the sour cream which is a huge improvement, and I agree with a couple of people about putting it in a bigger pan than the 2 qt pan - because  the 2 qt was stuffed to the gills!   But besides adding my own touches of spices, oregano etc to the spaghetti sauce, I followed the recipe and it was a hit!!!!  Tastes even better left over!   Will be a family favorite from now on!

Tried this exactly as written (minus fresh basil as could not find any in store) last night for dinner and it was delicious!  I was skeptical of the sour (almost bought ricotta) cream but I really liked it.

Someone suggested to toss the sour cream with the pasta.  I did this and it worked out great!  We LOVED it!  I made it with sausage.  We will be making this again!

Amazing caserole.  My picky daugher loved it and she does not even like lasagna - so we are amazed.

We puchased a ziti caserole from Central Market and this recipe blew it away.  Thank you so much for sharing and I recommend this recipe to anyone considering it.

This is excellent!  To be honest I am not a big fan of pasta dishes but I love this!  I did toss the cooked pasta in sour cream prior to layering and it worked fantastic.  The dish was creamy, flavorful, and filling.  This filled a 9X13, 3 quart dish and will be leftovers for a couple days. Cleanup was even a breeze, as it came out of the dish flawlessly without any baked on food!  This dish is wonderful without any changes but would be great with your own personal touches!

Great recipe.  Had to substitute a couple items as I could not find in our local store.  I used Penne pasta and Shredded Italian Cheese.  And as I cannot have garlic I used 1 can of Tomato sauce and one can of diced tomatoes.  Turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe

YUM!  Sour cream and provolone made this dish a little more different/special.  10 of us for a family dinner, everyone liked it from age 3 up!  I used whole wheat pasta and mixed it in with sour cream before baking.  Also only had dried basil, added fresh garlic, parsley, italian seasoning and a dash of crushed red pepper in with the beef.  Can't wait for leftovers today.  Quick easy cheap crowd pleaser!

This dish was amazing....I did season the ground beef just a little with salt, pepper, and creole seasoning......I also added a small can of tomato paste(contained basil, garlic, and oregano), and a pinch of sugar.  I did follow the directions of a previous review and mix the ziti pasta and sour cream together....it turned out perfect....My husband had two servings.... My husband requested I make a pan, so he can take it to work for his co-workers.

Perfect pasta.  I used whole wheat penne pasta and mixed it with sour cream, dry basil, italian seasoning, and salt/pepper.  I used thick slices of jack cheese (in lieu of provolone and mozzarella).  I layered the sauce/meat mixture, the pasta coated in sour cream and dry seasoning, and jack cheese (layering it like lasagna and ending with the sauce/meat mixture and a dusting of parmesan).  Awesome.

I really love this recipe, but usually substitute Italian sausage for the ground beef.  Also, I combine the sour cream, grated cheese, and pasta and layer that with the sauce and cheese.  So good!

Followed the recipe with a couple of modifications: 1. mixed noodles with the sour cream 2. added some sauce over the first layer (like when I make Lasagna) 3. Used dried basil, that was all I had at the time. 4. used mini ziti noodles. I agree with others, I would 1/2 the recipe next time or split it in 2 pans and put one in the freezer before baking.  My kids gobbled this up, they are 2 and 4.  Have enough leftover we will probably have it for a few days.

This was SUCH A HIT at my home! I am new to cooking & made this for my first family gathering for 6 big eaters last week. I did make some adjustments, I used 2lbs of ziti, I added a small 1/2 container of ricotta & used almost all of the sour cream. I only used 1/2 onion & 1 lb of ground lean turkey, and I didn't layer (didn't have the time). To me Ziti is all mixed up anyways, loaded on the mozzarella and BAMB it was a HIT! We did have just a bit of left overs that lasted my husband and I 2 more small meals each. WILL make this again. Simple, easy and cheap

YUM! Wonderful and quick recipe.  Only problem was the amount.  I used a 2 1/2 quart corning ware dish and it was brimming.  I will use at least a 3 quart next time.  Since we have a garden and the tomatoes are in, my husband wanted to make a sauce.  He used fresh Italian tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil all from the garden and a bit of tomato paste.  The sour cream definitely made a difference.  I topped it with fresh Napoletano basil from the garden. Everyone loved it.  This is a keeper.

i thought it was okay. it was definitely quick and easy to make, so that was a plus. i'm not entirely sure what it was that i didn't love about it..i felt it was missing something. i'm giving it 4 stars because my boyfriend absolutely loved it and ate most of it last night haha. so maybe it's just a personal preference.

I made this and loved it! It was perfect but i would suggest a some garlic and mixing some of the cheese in with the sause. Also i didnt put the sour cream in layers i added that into the sause as well but i used less than the recipe said.

easy to make. followed tips and coated noodles in sour cream. used 2 jars of sauce, but only 2 cups (8 oz) of shredded italian cheese, and omitted basil. filled 9x13 pan. edit: make sure to boil noodles so they still have a little crunch. coated 13.25 oz noodles with 8 oz sour cream.

I made this last night for my daughter's 21st birthday meal.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was use 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 pound sausage.  Never have I received more compliments on any other homemade meal than this one.  It was awesome.  The best!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe, have been making it for years and usually follow it exactly except I omit the basil since I don't usually have it on hand.  If I do make any modifications it w/b to the chs. If i don't have mozzarella on hand, I would use whatever chs blend I have and it still turns out delicious. It must be the sour cream that makes it taste so good.

I made this once for my fiance and I and he absolutely loved it! I'm making it again tonight since we're on a tight budget ((buying a house)) and this is inexpensive to make! What he loves most is that there is NO ricotta. He hates that stuff. lol

I have made this for my husband's birthday 3 years in a row and it's a big hit every time.  I just had someone email me for the recipe.  It is absolutely delicious.  I even had my mother admit that she loved it and she's a huge fan of using ricotta!

Excellent!!! I did as others recommended and tossed the pasta in the sour cream. Halving the recipe yielded enough for many leftovers! I can't enough great things about this. Absolutely wonderful!!

yummy. My family has to watch their lactose (milk) intake so I cut out the sour cream and mixed the sauce with lactose free milk.

I substitute 1 cup of ricotta for provolone cheese.  Utilize two jars of tomato sauce and add spices when cooking the meat.  It is delicious.

I made this for company tonight, one of whom was a vegetarian. I made one dish with sausage instead of the ground beef and onions, the other with plain tomato sauce. I was worried about the sauce going on top of the pasta rather than mixed in, so I just put a little sauce in with the noodles to wet them. The pasta was great! I froze half after it was cooked. We'll see how it is the second time around.

Very good ziti.  I used 2 24oz meat flavor spaghetti sauces and the amount of sauce was perfect.  Also, I think that ricotta in place of the sour cream would be better, but the sour cream wasn't bad at all.

WE LOVE IT! My husband's favorite food of all time was always Stouffers Lasagna. Yes, it is good but I always wanted his favorite to be something I MADE. This recipe did the trick. The only thing I did different was instead of sour cream I mixed in 2 cups of cottage cheese to the sauce before I layered it on. I'm glad to say that I have finally beat out a processed food company. :)

This recipe is very popular at our house!  I took the advice of another reviewer and always toss the pasta in the sour cream.  It works wonderfully.  I also don't seem to use two full jars of sauce, but I do save the leftover sauce, so I can moisten the ziti when I reheat the leftovers.    Thank you so much for a GREAT recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  I halved it and it made 6 generous servings.  Mixed sour cream with the sauce and then mixed sauce, cheese and pasta together-no layering required.  Topped with more mozzarella and the Parmesan-yum!

We really liked this! I would use 1 1/2 boxes of pasta next time as the sauce/meat ratio was off - too much sauce for the amount of pasta. I added a lot of seasoning to the meat when I cooked it (onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, thyme, marjoram...), but otherwise made it just as written. I just split it into two dishes. Will definitely make again.

My husband's favorite meal in the whole world is Baked Ziti. After seeing this recipe featured, I decided to switch up the recipe I had been using. I will NEVER go back to the old recipe. I mix the sour cream and the pasta together before I start he layering process, this helps keep everything moist. I also choose to use roasted garlic red sauce. I love this recipe. Everyone should use it!!

Great Recipe.  I did like others suggested and mixed the sour cream and pasta together.  This is definately a keeper - my family loved it.

Tasty dish... I did add a few cloves of garlic to the pan when softening the onion. I used my own sauce , so I didn't really measure. I only had about 2 thin slices of provolone and 2 c of shredded mozz, lastly I only had about 1/2 c of sour cream(lite) on hand, so I added 2 oz of cream cheese(also lite- and all I had on hand). Still everyone ate,so no complaints here.

Dude! Who needs an italian restaurant. It's so easy to do this at home. This was great. I halved the recipie since it's only my wife & I. Turned out great with perfect flavors. I will definately make this again. I might add some green pepper next time.

I should have followed the recipe more exactly. I used about a cup of shredded mozzarella because I had it on hand. However, it came out more like hambuger helper. Good recipe I'm sure because even without enough cheese it was still tasty and simple.

The recipe was quick and easy and very cheesey.  I used Italian Sausage, sliced after cooking them, rather than ground beef.  I also simmered the mixture for about 30 minutes so the sausage and sause blended well.  I used the Ricotta cheese rather than sour cream and it turned out wonderful.  The entire family loved it, great recipe.

This was a great recipe and easy.  I also took the advice of others and mixed the sour cream with the pasta.  I originally started placing this in a 9x13 pan to find that there was too much to go in so ended up transferring to a deep dish lasagna pan.  My kids were home for the weekend and loved it as much as my husband and I.

Although I use this site all of the time, this is my first review. I made two batches of this today to take to work because the employees needed a nice "pick-me-up". I was hesitant to take a dish I had never tried but I didn't need to worry. It got RAVE reviews. People begged for the recipe. I really liked it myself (although I prefer the creamier taste of ricotta). I used half beef and half sausage and did mix the sour cream with the pasta as others suggested.  Great Job! A new staple!

I have made this twice. The first time I used ground chuck, but I had to quadruple the recipe for a party. Last night I made the basic recipe using Italian sausage. This is by far the best baked ziti ever. It does have a resemblance to lasagna, but I think it's better. I do mix the sour cream into the ziti first....stop searching. This is the best one yet! I will making this one a lot! I have started to mix in some marscapone cheese. It has now been taken to the next level. Try it!

This recipe was great.  I did as suggested by other reviews and mixed the parmesan cheese, sour cream, and noodles.  It came out great.  Used two 8x8 casserole dish and cooked one and froze one.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy, but looked like it took a long time to make. I am a fan of ricotta so I substituted 15 oz. of ricotta for the sour cream. I also used Bertolli sauce and it came out great.

Great recipe!  The ratios are perfect and the dish is very versatile.  I halved it and it still filled a 9x13 casserole dish (I probably had more meat in there than it called for).  I also mixed the noodles with the sour cream and they weren't dry at all.  There was plenty of sauce, too.  I mixed hamburg with hot Italian sausage, but it would be great either way.  This is going in my rotation!

Loved this!! I made this for some picky eaters and they raved about it asking me to make it again. I did use more cheese then the recipe called for, it was also shredded not sliced, and I used a little less sauce. This is a great recipe.

It was very good - substituted pepperoni for the ground beef and onion - also, halved the sour cream and replaced the other half with ricotta - also added chopped basil to this layer along with parmesan - reggiano is a must! Baked for 30 minutes covered, and 10 minutes uncovered and let sit for 5 - pretty good for a quick meal!

This was my first baked ziti and the recipe is very good, but I felt that some of the measurements are off. I think 2 (24 oz) jars of sauce are plenty. 56 oz is a lot of sauce. Also, there is no way that all of that pasta and sauce would fit in a 2 qt baking dish. I used a deep 9x13 dish and everything just barely fit. I thought the sour cream was very good and is a little easier to spread instead of ricotta. I also added some frozen chopped spinach, chopped mushrooms and garlic to the sauce. This would also be awesome with Italian sausage. Very tasty! Thanks a lot!

We loved this! The sour cream gives it a nice twist. I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also used sliced Havarti for the first cheese layer and shredded three-cheese blend for the top layer (because I didn't have what the recipe called for). Anyway, totally fab and we'll definitely make it again.

By far this was the best recipe that I have found on this site so far!! I substituted ricotta for sour cream and did not have provolone so I used jack and mozzarella. I also used whole wheat pasta and ground turkey. Very yummy!!

This was my first attempt at making baked ziti and it was amazing. I made it for a group of friends as an easy dinner party recipe. Everyone loved it and to this day I’m being begged to make it again. The fun thing about this dish is you can easily make it your own by changing the cheese adding extras and removing what you don’t want. I made my vegetarian and used different cheeses. A word of advice, don’t remove the sour cream, that’s the extra yummy ingredient. Soon I’ll try this recipe with Feta cheese.  Happy Bakeziting!

This recipe is the best. I make for our family, half I put in the freezer for a later date and half to be eaten right away. It is delicious! I have made it for friends and family and I always get rave reviews.

This is my all time favorite recipe.  If I need to make a meal for someone they always get this ziti.  I have also used zucchini instead of ground meat and have used sausage and ground meat... both are AWESOME!  The only thing different I have done is add a little more basil and oregano, to taste.  I don't even have this in my recipe box anymore since I make it so often I go off of memory!  AWESOME!!

I also cut the recipe in half and it still made 5 generous servings. I also didn't layer it, just mixed it all together and put the slices of prov. and extra basil on top. Very very good. Pleased a very picky eater in my house. Will make again and again.

I used other reviews and mixed in part of the sour cream into the noodles (without adding additional layers). I also only used 1 jar of sauce, which turned out to be too little after cooking it. All ingredients did NOT fit in the mentioned casserole dish. Pretty good though.

I was surprised that this was so good. I'm not a big pasta fan but I will make this again. I didn't use jar sauce..I used the Best Marinara Sauce Yet from this site. This is a keeper:)

Awesome recipe with so much room for variation!  I have used different pastas, cheeses and ground meats (depending on what was on hand or left over) without disappointment.  I also substituted cream cheese with a little milk (to thin) instead of sour cream and it was so creamy and yummy!  Easy and variable and everyone loves!

My husband loved this recipe!  I incorporated several other reviewer's suggestions (tossing ziti with sour cream, seasoning the meat with Italian seasoning, added a little pepperoni) and sprinkled some Creole Seasoning in with the meat.  I used shredded mozzarella instead of sliced.  Very good!  I baked half of it and put the other half in the freezer to use later.  Yum!

I used 1/2lb Hot Italian Sausage and 1/2lb ground chuck.  It was fantastic.  I also threw in 2 cloves fresh garlic to the sauce mixture.  Otherwise this is restaurant quality.

This is a delicious recipe that my family loves!  The only thing I did different was leave out the onion as my family doesn't care for them.  So cheesy and delicious!  Leftovers are just as good.  If you love cheese, like I do, this recipe is perfect for you!

This recipe is really wonderful.  Tastes like you cooked all day, extremely easy
Alright, I need to add something else!  I have made this the original way and it was fabulous!  I also tried like others suggested to mix sour cream with the noodles.  There is definately a difference in taste when you alter the recipe.  It's better when layered the way the recipe was written.  Why mess with perfection?

This was amazing!!  I'm giving 5 stars even though I changed some methods per reviews.  I mixed the sour cream with the noodles 1st and LOVED how that turned out.  I'm so happy not to have to use expensive riccotta or sub cottage cheese (I just don't like cottage cheese in my casseroles).  I only used 1 jar of sauce, I think 2 would be overkill, besides it's cheaper.  I definitely recommend the pasta/s.c. THEN sauce THEN cheese layering method. The sauce needs to touch noodle.  The provalone is a must have!!  My fav. jar sauce is Ragu, Sweet Italian Sausage & Cheese. Add worcestershire & garlic salt to the meat & onions, then a can of italian diced tomatoes, then sauce.  YUMMY!!

This was so easy to assemble and so yummy! Very cheesy - which I love :-) I did toss the ziti with the sauce for the bottom layer but changed nothing else.

Yum.  Very easy and very yummy.  I also followed another reviewers advice and mixed the past with the sour cream, used italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Otherwise, everything was exactly as written.  I filled 2-8x8 dishes to the top.

Love this recipe.  I use 2 cups sour cream and I think it tastes better if you make it in a smaller but deeper pan so that each layer has enough of the flavors.  If you do this though, it takes a long time to cook(could be at least an hour).

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious!  I only bought one 26oz jar of sauce and so I was worried about it being a little dry, but it wasn't.  I browned the meat and added a few herbs.  Then when I added the onions I also tossed in some garlic.  I mixed the pasta with most of the sour cream.  Then when I was layering I added a few dollops because I was worried about it being too dry.  I used a mixture of cheeses.  (Quattro formaggio is a great cheese mixture from Trader Joe's!!)  I also used some mozzarella and parmesan for the top.  I divided the recipe into two 8x8 dishes and froze one for another night.  Overall, a great recipe and very quick to throw together!

This was OK.  I halved the recipe for our family of 4 and there were leftovers (I have 2 young kids though.)  I used a 24.5 oz. can of sauce and it was enough.  If I were to make this again, which I doubt I will since there are so many other versions to try instead, I would reduce the sour cream by about 30% (e.g., instead of 1.5 cups, try 1 cup).  Also, I mixed the sour cream into the pasta instead of layering it.  Not sure if that made it taste too "sour creamy".

I made this exactly as the recipes specified, except tossed the pasta with the sour cream before adding the other ingredients.  We add from this for multiple days when we didn't have time to make dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

I am 55 years old and have been using my Mom's recipe (she's Italian) for my whole life. I used my own homemade meat sauce. Using the provolone in lieu of the typical ricotta was DELICIOUS. Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks????

The best!!!!  I love this recipe. The only thing I did a little different was put some more mozarella on the top along with the parmegan.  Otherwise, it was perfect as is.  It does make a lot, but I found that it freezes well and can be thawed and reheated with no problems.

I've made this for my boyfriend twice and he is a Very picky eater.  His words were "you will continue to make this right?"  So am diffently keeping this one for the books.  

For me I do the pasta al dente and have to use a 4 qt roasting pan for the full recipe.  Makes for some great lunches for the week.  Enjoy

I used a sausage and beef mixture. Added more cheese and followed the advice of other reviewers about the sour cream and mixing it in with thte pasta. Good tasting and husband really liked it.

Tastes wonderful!  I used heavy whipping cream instead of sour cream because that's what I had on hand.  It made for a nice tomato-cream sauce.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I've made this twice.  The first time as the recipe listed and the second time with a few tweaks.  With the tweaks it was definitely a 5, but as is, it's a 4.  Mixed the sour cream with the noodles as others have done and I mixed Italian sausage with the ground beef.

I give this five stars because it is exceptionally easy and feeds so many so cheaply. I can even sautee some veggies and sneak them in a corner for myself with no ground beef (section it off w/ a little tinfoil).  As an only vegetarian it's very nice to be able to have the same as everyone else with only a little extra work.  Also, I have to mention my fiance LOVES this.  He begs for it, likes it almost as much as lasagna and I can make it in half the time!  It even freezes well.  As far as practicality, price and ease go, it's definetly five stars and six if you factor in my guys happiness ;) Thank you!

This was so good!  I used a jar of Meijers Gold sauce with italian sausage in it and my whole family loved it.  I also mixed the sour cream with the noodles before laying it and I also mixed the sauce with the noodles before laying it.  It is something I will make for sure again!  Thanks so much!!

Very yummy ziti. I mixed the pasta with the sour cream as others recommended and I left out the meat as I didn't have any. Turned out very creamy and cheesy.

This was absolutely the most delicious baked ziti I have ever had. I halved the recipe and it still made enough for 2 nights with my family of 4. I caution you to be prepared to use 2 casserole dishes if you make the recipe as is.

One Word: DELICIOUS!! I enjoyed this recipe very much, it had great flavor and pretty simple to make. I did use the suggestion of coating the ziti with the sour cream before layering..Great dish and a hit with everyone!!

excellent recipe. 
1. used lowfat sour cream, couldn't taste any difference
2. recommend as other users have, coating the pasta with the sour cream
3.  added some red pepper while the sauce was stewing, not enough, because the sauce wasn't very spicy
4.  added 3 cloves of minced garlic before i started sauteing the onions
5. used maybe 1.5 bottles of sauce. was still delicious. 

next time i would try adding mushroom while the sauce is stewing.

I made this recipe for my husband and me last night. It was SCRUMPTIOUS! True, it does make a whole whole lot, but it heats up really well for leftovers (as evidenced by my empty tupperware bowl for lunch today!). I used shredded mozerella instead of slices and it was still really good. Also I used the McCormicks basil seasoning instead of "fresh" basil and that was fine too. I just layered the sour cream in the middle. It was super easy and SUPER GOOD!

This is the best Ziti ever. The only thing I would recommend is to coat the noodles with sourcream instead of layering it. It keeps everything from drying out. This recipe makes alot, I made the whole thing and divided it before baking and froze half of it and got another meal out of it!!

Excellent!!  My whole family loved it!  I do have to say that the 2qt pan is way too small, my 4qt barely held it all, also didn't need quite that much sauce.  I also used the other suggestions and tossed the pasta in the sour cream.  Wonderful!

Great recipe - I also made a few changes based on personal preference - I used sweet italian sausage and added mushrooms.  I also cut the recipe by half and it still filled a 9x13 pan.  I do think it's the sour cream (which I tossed with the pasta as suggested)and provolone cheese that make this difference in this one.

Great, easy recipe which makes a ton of food.  Had enough for 4 adults, 3 kids, and leftovers for 4 more adult meals.  I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef which turned out well.

So far, one of the best recipes I've gotten off the site! Very yummy. Didn't have Ziti so I used the bow tie pasta I had in the cupboard and used my favorite sauce (Paul Newmans brand).Excellent, will make again!

The recipe is definitely delicious !!!  But this yeilds way more than a 2 qt casserole...more like 2 of them (single layered).  Next time I will just layer it all once into a 13 X 9 baking dish.  Also, I added another lb of beef because 1 lb was just not enough for 2 jars of spaghetti sauce.  I also used more cheese than called for.  It was tasty, though !!!  I will definitely make it again.

This was awesome.  I used 1/2 lb burger and 1/2 lb ground sausage.  I also followed anothers suggestion and tossed the cooked noodles with the sour cream just before assembling and it turned out awesome.  The recipe only called for 6 oz of mozz and prov cheese, but I had 8 oz on hand and used it all!  Very good recipe and I will definately make again and again.

Was very good!! Made a few changes: added onion, greenpepper, garlic and a few spices to the sausage while frying. When this was done i added sauce to sausage and let sit while boiling the noodles. I used macroni noodles, because that is what I had on hand and also mixed sour cream with the noodles. I only used mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. I also made my first layer with the meatsauce since I was worried that the noodles would stick to the bottom of the 13" x 9" pan. Served with salad and garlic bread and was a big hit!

Really very good.  I will make this again and I will make extra pasta to make it easily prepare 2 8x8 casseroles so I can freeze one.

I made this last night and WOW, not only was it awesome, but it made a HUGE dish.  The only thing i did was use some extra cheese, and since i wasnt sure about whether to use 1 or 2 28 oz cans of sauce, i only used one, which was good, since it would have been too much sauce if i had just used 1.  We prefer more cheese here anyway, so it came out excellent. When i opened the oven to pull it out, i just had to stand there and look at it, cause it came out looking so picture perfect!

I took the advice of other reviewers: mixed sour cream (low-fat) into ziti before layering, and added spices & garlic to ground beef (extra lean) while browning.  This turned out amazing.  While my husband and I both wondered if it would spill over the sides, it didn't and we will be enjoying this for days to come!  Absolutely delicious!

I made this just the other day. My husband LOVED IT! I added sliced Italian sausage...and followed another reviewer's advice and tossed the cooled ziti in the sour cream...and ALSO tossed in some grated parmesan at the same time. It did make a LOT and we enjoyed it for 3 days...and YES it was better each time! :)

Wonderful recipe!  Took others advice and mixed the sour cream with the hot pasta, much easier than trying to spread it over the cheese.  Also, cooked it in a 13 x 11 dish and it still overflowed in the oven.  So easy to prepare and so good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Okay, but I think it was a bit too "cheesy". Next time I will use less cheese, and also put in the 9x13 pan and a smaller pan as well. The 9x13 was full to the brim and I did not add all the sauce. Just put a bit on top of each serving. Plenty of leftovers from our family of 7. Would make a good casserole for a potluck.

I made this last night using penne instead of ziti, and it was really delicious.  I took the advice of others and mixed the sour cream right in with the hot, drained pasta, then followed the rest of the recipe letter for letter.  Moist, cheesy and flavorful - the fresh basil is awesome.

I love this recipe, I have even shared it with my sisters and they love it too. It is fast, easy and everyone enjoys it. The only thing I change is that I break it in half between 2 pans. I bake one and freeze the other for later.

I made this recipe last night and I thought it was really good.  I did make some changes though.  I left out the basil and the moz. cheese.  I used more provolone and parmasean instead.  It seemed like a cross between lasange and spaghetti.  It was good.

This was great!  I made a regular pan using ricotta as others had suggested & had enough to do a little one with sour cream  We DID NOT like with the sour cream, it for whatever reason seemed very salty.  Loved the one with ricotta & husband said he like the texture of that one as well.

Really good and easy to make.  I added some garlic powder to the ground beef while it was cooking and only used about a cup of sour cream because it's all we had.  The combination of provolone an mozzerella cheese is yummy.  Makes a lot, but I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  Served with a salad and slices of Rosemary Bread.

Very tasty.  Definitely more pasta than meat.  Next time I will increase the meat a little and decrease the pasta a little or use a dish bigger than 9x13.

This was really good. I forgot about the sour cream and it was still very nice.  I will try adding it next time, or just some ricotta as recommended by other reviewers.  Great for leftovers, too.

So good!  I used veggie ground round instead of beef but it was still fab.  The sour cream is a must.  I was skeptical since this is simpler than the baked pasta recipes I tend to like, but I will definitely be making this again.  I used Barilla's pasta sauce with mushrooms (and sauteed some onions with it) for the base and it was great like that but I'd also love to try it with my own bolognese.

I made this last night, my family loved it. It was really the best Ziti I have ever made. Will keep this in my regular recipe rotation. I added bell pepper & black olives to the sauce mixture just to make it fun.

We've tried a dozen or so recipes for baked ziti, trying to find one as good as and similar to one we enjoyed at a restaurant we visited frequently a decade or so ago when we lived in California.

This one comes close, and in any event is very good. Don't need to change a thing, and the leftovers are excellent.

Really great!  Does fill up 9x13 pan to the top, so plan accordingly.  Also, I added the sauce over the bottom layer so the noodles would remain soft.  Made if for guests coming over to watch a TV show and they loved it.

I thought this recipe was good, not great.  I followed others advice and added garlic to the beef as I was browning it and bought sauce with mushroom and italian sausage in it.  Overall, I was not enthused by two things :  1. The sour cream was too much.  Next time I will try ricotta cheese and cut down the amount to be added 2. The basil was overpowering.  I would definitely reduce the portion from 1/4 to maybe a table spoon.  
  This recipe is worth a shot, and I would make it again, I just don't know how often.

I served this for "Girls Night" at my house and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I think, after trying severeal ziti recipes, that the key to a good baked ziti (or any pasta dish) is the sauce. I used 2 jars marinara and 1 jar 3 cheese sauce and it was good, but I think next time I will look for a GREAT sauce recipe and try making it with a better sauce, not jared. That would make it a 5 star! I also added a small container of ricotta cheese to the noodles before layering as suggested by others and it did keep the noodles from drying out. I will do that again next time too!

I cut this in half and it would serve 4 just fine. Wonderful and cheesy, I used lowfat ricotta with a beaten egg instead of sour cream and mixed it in with the noodles so they wouldn't dry out.  I would make this again

I really loved the taste of this Ziti. I could not believe that the cheese melted so well over all of the pasta, at first I thought cheese slices would be a little strange but it works out great. The sauce mixed with the sour cream was a great addition too and really mellowed the flavor. My only problem was that it made a HUGE amount of pasta. If anyone was really able to fit all of this into a 2 quart baking dish I would love to know how! I used a 3 quart dish and it was almost overflowing. I had plenty to send home with my Mom and my husband, daughter and I still had enough leftovers for about 3 more meals. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

We loved this recipe!  The cheeses were so gooey together and delicious.  I used pork sausage instead of the ground beef and it was good.  I also did the half ricotta half sour cream cheese thing.  It was good...just a little more like a lasagna.  I think next time, we'll just use the sour cream all the way instead.  Very good, and very delicious as left overs and overs!

Good recipe--it made a lot more than what I thought it was going to.  I ended up having to move it to a 9x13 pan.  I think it would be better if I had used some italian sausage--the plain hamburger lacked some flavor.

Pretty darn tasty!  I have to agree with the other reviewers, it makes a LOT.  I added a little dried oregano and used boccini (fresh mozzarella balls) and a shredded Italian blend..which made for a very gooey cheesy experience.  Absolutely delicious!

My family loved it, and so did I. Really easy to make. Next time I will have to use a somewhat larger pan, because I had ingredients spilling over! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was wonderful. I had to make a few exceptions. I only used provolone (no mozzarella or Parmesan). Since it was blazing hot and not appropriate to heat up the oven, I warmed up our portions in the microwave. Delicious.

This was very good - however I used only about a half of a cup of sour cream. I will make this again - everyone enjoyed it, including my 5 and 3 year old cousins who were staying with me that night!

I made this for a church dinner on the grounds.  I have several recipes to give out now.  It was great.  The only thing I changed was that I mixed the sour cream with the hot noodles instead of layer it and I used slices of swiss cheese because that is what I had.  Will use this recipe many more times.

This was really tasty and really easy.  I did not add the parmesan or basil (I didn't have either on hand) but just added shredded mozzarella to the top.  A really quick fix as well, besides the 30 minutes it takes to bake.  Great for a weeknight.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!  I use sour cream in my lasagna (instead of ricotta), but this was a much better pasta recipe.  This dish has also became a favorite for pot-lucks at work (everyone requests it).  Plus, it's so easy to assemble!

Yum! Gosh this was easy and great. I used a mixture of sausage and ground beef, added garlic, and used my lasagna pan - all fit with plenty of room. I was concerned about the sour cream but it really just blends in. Thanks!!

Great recipe and a definite keeper! I used homemade pasta sauce (Spaghetti sauce I from this site)and penne (that's all I had) but I otherwise followed the recipe to a T. We both loved it, it's a good thing the servings are huge! ;) Might sub ricotta for cream next time, as other reviewers did.

Excellent. I made this dish the nite before and it was a great make ahead meal. I used ground turkey instead of beef and I added the fresh basil to my sauce mixture (instead of sprinkling it on top.) This was great.

Seeing that this recipe called for canned spaghetti sauce, I was a little  concerned about using it. I read many of the reviews and thought, "well, maybe my concerns are for nothing." I was wrong. I'd been looking for a richer, spicier version of my ziti. What my husband and I ended up getting was something that was indeed easy to make, but really tasted like canned spaghetti sauce (I used Bartolli's). So, maybe it was the spaghetti sauce we used, maybe not. I think we both would have preferred something with a homemade sauce.

We loved it!  There was nothing left to put away after dinner.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I used my own spaghetti sauce.  I haven't found a spaghetti sauce in a jar yet that I like as well as my own sauce from scratch.

My family and I also thought this was very good.  I took another's suggestion and used the Bertolli's Tomato Basil Spaghetti Sauce.  I used a 9x13 baking dish and it JUST made it.  Like so many others have suggested, you might want to use two baking dishes as this recipe makes A LOT of ziti.

Yum!  I made this last night and substituted ground turkey for beef because I don't eat red meat. It was delicious and made enough for my husband and I to have again tonight(and probably tomorrow, too!).  Since the pasta was finished before the sauce was done simmering, I added the sour cream to the ziti so they wouldn't dry out. Will make again soon!

We loved this recipe! My husband who is Italian is always complaining that you can't find good Italian food anymore, he ate 3 helpings...This recipe was so easy and fast, I was really surprised. My daughter also loved it, and both asked that I make it again soon. The recipe does make a lot though, so I might cut it in half next time so they don't over eat. :) Even though my family had second helpings we still had left overs. I will be adding this to my recipe file!

Good recipe, makes way too much for 2 people. I had to use two casserole dishes. Would have been better with a meat, maybe sausage or beef.

Sour cream makes this recipe delicious. Never would have thought of that! I love sauce so I do use 2 jars when making this. With or without the ground meat it's yummy. For fun I bake them in individual sized pasta dishes, keeps them looking nice when served.

I asked my husband to rate this recipe as I made it for him.  He said he'd give it a 3 or a 4.  I was leaning more towards five but his comment was that "It tasted delicious but it doesn't look so attractive when served.  Lasagna when made looks nice and tastes great."  Dressing up any ziti with fresh parsley on the side or sprinkling parmesean after it comes out will dress it up.  I tend to rate more on taste than aesthetics and so my comment is it deserves a 4 1/2.  Thanks, we'll make it again.

This was so easy!  The provolone and sour cream (I used all provolone and no mozzarella) give this recipe a really unique flavor!  I also mixed the basil into the sauce instead of sprinkling on top.  My kids won't eat anything with green on it!  It was a big hit with adults and children alike!

Sinfully decadent!  I used hot italian sausage, added mushrooms and onions, and increased the cheese.  I will definitely be passing this recipe along!

When I came across this recipe I just HAD to make it for my hubby who is a ziti fiend. We both liked it but as a matter of personal taste, found the sour cream to be overpowering. I have since made it a few times and cut back on the sour cream, simply scrumptious. This one is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

This was quick and easy to make.  I made it for a baby shower and everyone loved it!  I did chop some fresh basil and put it inside my layers before cooking - but don't put too much!

As noted by a previous reviewer, this made way more than could fit into a 2 qt. dish.  I used two dishes and froze one.  The taste was very good.

This recipe was a cut above others of this type.  I think the two types of cheeses and the fresh basil made all of the difference!

Delicious! I would change one thing, either halve the recipe to put it in a 2 qt baking dish or put it in a 13x9x2 pan. I ended up with way too much sauce and pasta to even fit in a 2 qt baking dish.  But either way, the combinations of sour cream & cheese & sauce is excellent.  My favorite pasta sauce to use is Ragu- tomato, garlic & onion.

To die for... I even like this better than lasagna, and that's unheard of!  The thing that makes it better than a lot of baked ziti recipes is the amount of sauce that goes into it.  It seems like too much sauce, but others dry out as they bake.  I would like  to add that I will only make this with Ragu original.  I tried Prego because it was on sale once, but it is sweet and ruined this dish.

here in the u.k sometimes its hard to get the exact ingredients - provolone for example but when you can, it's well worth the effort. my son, who is soo picky at times absolutely loves this and could probably eat a four person serving on his own! really tasty filling teatime special that i'm always being begged to make more of!

This recipe was very good! We're very picky about our spaghetti sauce (we only eat homemade), so I was skeptical of using ready-made. I left out the sour cream, but other than that the only thing I changed was I added mozzarella, basil, garlic, oregano, etc to the sauce (all the things I normally put in my homemade sauce) and it was delicious!

This recipe was awesome!  It seemed like 2 jars of sauce would be too much, but it was just right.  I used a garlic/basil sauce.  I added some garlic while browning the beef, and I also added some ricotta in the middle layer.  This dish was way better than other baked pasta recipes I have tried.  It was deliciously sinful, and worth it!

I halved the recipe, used whole wheat penne and low-fat ricotta, it was delicious and very easy to make. I served it at a girls' night get together and my friends took home leftovers and the recipe.

Just made this recipe this past weekend for company, and it went very, very well.  My company said it was the best they ever had.  I made a few minor substitutions/changes: shredded mozzerella & provolone blend instead of the slices, put the sour cream on top of the cheese - enough to coat it, used Cabernet Marinara sauce for that extra kick.  Mine never really "bubbled" but it was done nonetheless - I checked for the parmesan to melt and I saw liquid at the bottom boiling.  Also, I made up the casserole the night before and just baked it the next day, which went just fine.  I would definitely recommend this recipe, and have already given it out to my company!

So very yummy and tasty. I did not have any fresh basil, but that did not take away from the dish at all. Nice change from the usual lasanga.

This was WONDERFUL.  Even my picky 12 year old liked it. The only thing I did different was use all mozzarella cheese instead of a mixture of that and provolone.

This was wonderful!  I used ricotta cheese and added three big cloves of garlic.  I also had to use an 11x14 inch pan, but I'm so glad, because now we have enough to share with family and we get to eat it again tomorrow!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family loved this. I am now passing this on to my friends and family. I did change the sour cream for ricotta, and the fresh basil is a must. I would add a little extra cheese to this for a more authentic feel.

Used half ground beef and half hot italian sausage.  Filled to the top of a 9 x 13 glass dish.  Very good and even better the next two days.  Will make again.
Thanks, Michele, cambridge ontario

Fantastic.  I used a 9x13 pan and still had left over sauce.  The substitution of sour cream for ricotta was a nice change.  Thanks!
