I added about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to the apples and rhubarb and it seemed to help thicken it a bit.  Great flavour.  I also made an oatmeal crumble topping for it.   1 c oatmeal 1/2 c marg and  1/2 c brown sugar  (approx measurements)

Just a question on the pie.  Is that just 6 apples or should it be 6 cups?  And also, on the rhubarb, is that 3 cups or 3 stalks.  If stalks how big of ones do you use?  Thanks.

My husband doesn't like rhubarb, but I do.  I made this recipe when we had company last weekend, adding 1/4 cup of flour and 1 tsp of baking powder.  The pie had a great consistency, not too juicy and sliced perfectly.  The end product received excellent reviews, even from my husband.  Will make it again.

So good! I added the 1/4 cup flour and a teaspoon of cornstarch. I also added one more stalk of rhubarb and took away an apple. Oh and I prefer a more British flavour so I changed the cinnamon to ginger. Very happy with the results! The kids hated it, though so there was more for DH and me.

This pie was really easy to make and my husband really liked it.  I felt it was a little bland, but I'm not a big pie eater. The only problem I had with this recipe was the measurements.  Three what of rhubarb?  Three stalks? Three cups?  Maybe this is something most people would just know automatically.  But still, very good recipe.

Some people are asking about the amounts.  Well, 3 medium-sized chopped stalks (about 30 cm/12‚Äù) yield 3 cups of rhubarb.  And 6 regular apples, peeled, cored and chopped yield 6 cups.  I used 3 granny smith and 3 gala apples and it was delicious.  Not too tart, not too sweet.  And I topped it with 3/4 cup flour + 1/3 brown sugar + 6 tbsp butter for a crumbly finish.  Highly recommended!

This recipe is poorly written. The amounts are not clear, and a baking temperature of 440 doesn't seem right (my pie would definitely have burned if I hadn't turned the oven down twice). I used about 4 Granny Smith apples and no more than 2 cups of rhubarb and that was plenty.
It tastes fine but if you are really looking for a good rhubarb pie, stick with the Strawberry/Rhubarb Crumb Pie on this site - it's amazing.

I made this pie the other evening for company. It was delicious, of course I used my own crust recipe instead of store bought. Would add a tablespoon of flour to the sugar next time making to absorb some of the liquid.  The rhubarb added just enough tartness to the pie.
Give it 5 Stars.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this pie and I also added in the 1/4 c. flour.  This made it easy to slice and it held up well when sliced.  a very good and easy recipe. We will be having it for our Memorial Day dinner with vanilla ice cream of course.

This recipe is perfect as it is!  It can even be divided for smaller servings without spoiling the flavor.  I baked it in a 6" round glass pie plate and it was enough for 4 people generously.  It's definitely a "keeper".  Thanks.

This was really good.  I was able to use some rhubarb that I had in the freezer.  I made a crumble topping for it rather than crust on top.  I am a huge fan of rhubarb so I will make this again with next year's crop!

It was okay. I added flour to the filling but other than that I followed the recipe. Maybe the apples I used were too tart for this recipe, my pie was just too tart overall. I don't think apples and rhubarb are a great combination. I will not make this again.

This pie was good, but I would cut down on the apples and add more rhubarb. Also, not sure if it was suppose to be 3 stalks of rhubarb or 3c rhubarb. I used 3c. of rhubarb and it still wasn't enough. I took others advice and added 1/4c. flour, but I felt like it was too much. Other than that, it was very easy to make and still tasted good, just not a five star.

This recipe definitely does not work. There were so many things that went wrong.

1) the amount of apple and rhubarb used for the filling is just way too much for the pie crust. I still had a 1/4 to 1/3 of the filling remaining even after using a deep pie pan and piling the topping high.

2) the pie came out extrememly watery on the inside

Not good

If I could give it a lower score I would.  It was just a heap of cold fruit when it went in and a heap of hot fruit when it came out.  Might as well have eaten it raw.  There was nothing pie-filling-y about this "pie."

The apple rhubarb crumble on this site is much better.

This is delicious.  Ironically, I'd bought rhubarb for a pie and after making one, didn't have enough for a second pie so I thought, "Maybe I'll add apples!"  I threw everything together, baked it, and then happened to find this recipe which is exactly my own improvised recipe.

I believe I had four stalks of rhubarb, and used three apples; six apples seems like it would really overfill the crust as my pie was piled quite high.  I would recommend sprinkling minit tapioca on the bottom before adding filling, to absorb some liquid.

Very good. I added a 1/4 cup of flour as others suggested. Turned out well! HOWEVER be warned, I had enough filling for three pies! Also, I am not sure, but I took the numbers in front of the fruits to mean how many - so 6 apples, 3 rhubarb. It made a lot!

This pie was very good indeed. The only changes I made were to add a little flour to fruit mixture. I  think 440¬∞F is a odd temperature and slightly too high. My pie was very dark after just 30 minutes, so either reduce the temperature slightly or keep a close eye on it and cover with foil when golden.

I mixed all Pie ingredients together in a bowl then poured it into the pie shell, I also added about 2 T of butter cut up. I topped it with another crust. My dinner company loved it! I thought it was better the next day!!

The first one I made had way too much fruit and ended up with a mess, my own fault since it was the first pie EVER that I made.  Next try was perfect!!  I also added 1/4 C flour and did a crunch topping.  I did not have oatmeal so I substituted granola and holy cow talk about amazing!!!

Great taste, I adjusted the baking temperature.  Baked on lower rack at 425-450 for 20 minutes and then moved to middle rack, turned temperature down to 350 and baked for another 25-30 minutes.  Only added one teaspoon of cinnamon.

This pie turned out great!  My picky eaters are asking me to make another one.  I added a little flour like previous raters recommend.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome!  I added 1/4 cup flour and 1 Tbsp corn starch like everybody else did, and it was still a little watery, but OMG the taste is out of this world! Sweet, tart, awesome!

My husband and son really liked it.  I think next time I won't use the food processor for chopping, the filling cooked too soft for me; I like  texture in my fruit pies.  I used reviewer pamjlee's crumb topping.  I doubled the topping since there was enough filling for two pies.  I was a little nervous because the topping spread so much, but it set-up a little like an oatmeal cookie.  I also used 1 1/2 T cornstarch instead of 1 T--simply because that's the measuring spoon I grabbed. I will likely make it again because the rest of the family liked it so much.

This is better than the traditional rhubarb strawberry pie.  I added 2 tbsps. of flour to fruit as rhubarb tends to make a runny pie.  Chopping apples was also a good idea.

Wasn't sweet enough and the rhubarb was still a bit tough.  I probably wouldn't make it again.

This was my first time making this recipe. I'll try it again but I'll put a top crust on it because the pie did not look pretty when it came out of the oven. At the end of the day, the pie tasted good but not great.
