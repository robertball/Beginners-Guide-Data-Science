There's something seriously off with the ratio of ingredients in the burgers.  I made the first batch exactly as follows (but I halved the recipe).  I used only carrots.  6 cups of bread crumbs is at least twice the amount needed.  I had to add extra eggs/oil just to be able to form them into patties.  They didn't even stick to the bran flakes and they ended up tasting like bread crumb cakes with a bit of carrots.  The next batch I made with a mixture of carrots/zucchini.  I doubled the amount of veggies and halved the amount of bread crumbs.  This time they turned out great.  I ate them on their own and dipped them in garlic mayo.
1 star for the recipe, 4 star for the taste with major modifications.

I was a little funny about trying this recipe but I am really glad I did!!  My teen daughter is a vegetarian and the rest of us are not so I made these for her while we had chicken sandwiches and these were to die for!!!  I added carrot and zucchini and followed the recipe exactly as stated and they held together perfectly and had an amazing flavor!!  My whole non vegetarian family was jealous of my vegetarian teen after tasting these and they are requesting these for our next burger meal.  Do try these, you won't be dissapointed..  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These were super!  Very pleasant flavor, very flavorful!  I did only use half of the breadcrumbs, as suggested by others.  I also held the patty in one hand, and sprinkled the crushed cereal on, then turned it on to the other hand and sprinkled crushed cereal on the other side rather than dipping.  When cooked, they were delicious, firm, flavorful patties!  My husband was impressed by them too.

This was ridiculously delicious! I made a serving for 6 instead of 12. I used 2 cups of bread crumbs instead of 3 (I toasted whole-wheat bread, cut it up into pieces and used my blender to make it into crumbs) and about 1 and a half cups of raisin bran cereal (I picked out all the raisins). I will definitely be making this again! I'm real anxious to share it with others.

love it! love it! it tastes really good! i made a few changes as i don't have other ingredients available and i can't wait to make them.

so, instead of mayonnaise i used cream cheese, i put in lots of minced garlic too. then i used 1 cup bread crumbs and 1 cup all-purpose flour as i used up the bread crumbs i have at home and looked for an alternative. for cereal flakes i used instant oatmeal. instead of baking, i fried it like the old school burgers. just used very little oil... made sure each side is cooked very well and of course the oatmeal is crunchy enough.i spread cream cheese on it and put in on a burger bun. ate it while it was still hot and yum yum yum!!! thank you so much!

At first when my dad asked how carrot burgers sounded for dinner I was a little hesitant. I figured we could try it, but had little faith it would be good enough to have again. I was wrong. This was a great vegetarian alternative. 6 cups of bread crumbs was way too much and my dad only used two. The burgers reminded me of a chicken patty, actually. Very filling. This one is a keeper; will definitely have again.

I dunno.  Just didn't "grab" any of us.  Yeah, both kids (12 & 14) ate one (since the pork chops weren't done yet).  They wouldn't have if I told them they were carrot burgers.  I just said it was a side dish.  Ate 'em with ketchup.  'Kinda tastes like ketchup with ketchup.  For those who are going to try, I minced the onion & microwaved it with the carrots.  It cooked nicely - no crunches.  I didn't do the cereal coating & cooked 'em in a pan.  'Glad I tried it, but won't make it again.  Next day: Had one cold.  'Reminded me of Thanksgiving bread dressing.  Not a bad idea.  Making dressing patties (with my recipe).  Camping.  Kids.  Hmmm.  I think the bread crumbs in it plus serving it on bread is just too much - yeah, bread.  Maybe it's a better side dish with some type of gravy or sauce?

I used only half the amount of breadcrumbs called for (3 cups instead of 6) and they came out perfect!

I would rather eat this any day than a veggie burger from most restaurants/stores. This recipe was really easy.  I was reluctant to try it because it sounds so odd, but I had some leftover shredded carrots & wanted to do something with them. I didn’t have breadcrumbs, so I used oatmeal (half the amount, based on other reviews). I didn’t have flake cereal, so I used crushed honey nut cheerios. I may have made them a little thicker than necessary (next time I’ll make them thinner). I served them on sourdough bread with ketchup and mustard. They were good. I don't think I'm in love, but I definitely like them. I’m taking the leftovers to work tomorrow to see how they hold up reheated in the microwave.

This is an interesting new way to eat more veggies, I  only used 3 cups of breadcrumbs as others suggested and for cereal I used Special K. I was worried as I put it together because the patties didn't hold too well, but it was great coming out of the oven. Will try again with other veggies, thanks for the recipe!

I made this and I LOVED it! However by mistake I left out the wheat flakes but added fried onions   from  the can. I made this last year but forgot how I made it, back then I remembered to add everything.   I served it with smashed cauliflower and green beans. It was filling and tasty.  I loved it so much I rushed to the store to purchase enough to make again and throw in the freezer,   it took less then 20 minutes to fix.

4 stars for the recipe base, 5 stars for my additions and changes. I used three cups carrots, 2 cups Italian bread crumbs since it's what I had on hand, and three eggs to keep the ratio of egg to carrot similar to the recipe. They were soooo good! After tasting them I think a tablespoon or so of Dijon mustard in the mix would just put it over the moon! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe!  Even my carrot hating spouse loves it! I made a few changes.  Mainly, I used corn flake cereal instead of wheat as that is what I had on hand.  I did not use olive oil, I used regular vegetable oil and only 1 tablespoon.  Then I put a tablespoon of fruit chutney in it.  I also mixed some of the cereal crumbs in the batter itself to help hold it together better then coated it with the rest.  I also added a bit of Cajun spice, but you can season it to your specific tastes.  I have recommended this to my friends as I think it is that good.

My family LOVED this recipe!!  I followed the reviews and halved the bread crumbs (used gluten free) which gave the perfect consistency.  I did not use the cereal coating because I had none that was gf.  We love seasoning so I tripled the garlic (approx), added turmeric, which we're using more and more of in recipes for it's amazing health benefits, and substituted coconut oil for the olive oil.  Topped with siracha, dill pickle and BBQ sauce and voila, new family favourite!!!

Three cups of bread crumbs instead of six and the recipe is great and they held together well. It is almost as simple to make as regular burgers. I'm not a vegetarian and there was nothing about these that seemed "too healthy" any more than a potato chip would. Not to be missed.

I don't know why this gets so many good reviews.  The flavor is okay, plus for the textures, but the recipe is way off on portions.  1 egg is more than enough, otherwise you need a ton of bread crumbs.  What is the mayonnaise for?  to make it moist?  Seems like that could be left out all together too.

great idea, poor execution.

So good!  I also reduced the amount of bread crumbs to 1 1/2 cups, added some parmesan and some grated zucchini.  Instead of on a bun we ate them like a patty with a quick white sauce (mayo, pickle juice, sour cream, fresh basil, salt & pepper).  I will make this recipe over and over again!

Surprisingly good!  Like everybody else, I use zucchini and carrot and diminish by half the quantity of bread crumbs (Panko).  And to add a touch of spiciness I add some hot spice sauce (1 1/2 Table spoon).  Those ingredients are easy to find in any home. Easy recipes to make.

Sorry...I wanted this to have a carrot taste, or at least be a kind of carrot stuffing flavored patty. But, it tasted like bread with cereal coating. Didn't taste carrot or onion. Just bread.

Too heavy on the breadcrumbs and cereal stuff. Are there any carrots in here? These should be called bread burgers.

Fantastic!!!  My whole family LOVED them.  They were better than we expected.  I did the recipe with half carrots/half zucchini and changed the bread crumbs to 3 cups as advised by others.  This is going on favorites for sure:)
