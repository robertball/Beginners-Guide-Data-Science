Kali, your cake is phenomenal! My family loved it! It is not your typical heavy carrot cake and it has a fine and light crumb texture.  I love the mandarin oranges and orange zest! My husband didn't know there were mandarin oranges in the cake, but what a way to make a moist cake. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful cake! I didn't have canned mandarin oranges so I used 3 small fruit cups in 100% juice which are 4 oz. each from Dole. I drained the oranges. I also live at high altitude, 5062 feet. So, I had to adjust the baking soda to 1 and 1/4 tsp.

Amazing! I made no revisions to this recipe and my hubby says it may just be the best cake he's ever had. And that's saying a lot because his mom can BAKE!! 

A note - I drained the mandarin oranges and sliced them up into smaller pieces before mixing into the batter. Don't feel like you have to get fresh mandarins - the canned ones were excellent (and you can't really even tell they're in there anyway)

Amazing! I made the cake as cupcakes but otherwise followed the directions and they turned out perfectly. My family dislikes the coconut and nuts most carrot cake recipes call for so I was pleased to find this one without those ingredients. It was a huge hit and is definitely a recipe that will be made again!

Very moist, very good even though a bit too sweet for me! Great idea substituting pineapple with mandarin oranges. Recipe calls for 11 oz canned oranges. Stores in my area sell only 15 oz cans. Was hard to know how to measure 11 oz, so I added all 15 oz to recipe. Used rest of ingredients as called for, except I substituted vegetable oil with organic coconut oil. Could be the extra 4 oz of mandarins with combo of 2 cups of sugar made it too sweet for my taste. When making next batch, I'll reduce sugar or lesser oranges. Prep time was more than 15 minutes. Took 45 minutes between measuring, shredding carrots, and beating mixture. Baked 45 minutes. Cake's been refrigerated for three days; still a bit sweeter for me. After microwaving a piece, I spread soft butter on it and enjoyed it. Thanks for submitting your recipe.o

I just started cooking/baking things and have so far enjoyed it. I made this last night for my mom's birthday since she loves carrot/spice cakes and she freaking loved it! It was so light yet moist and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and used some store bought cream cheese icing and chopped pecans as a topping, which gave it a nice crunch. I'm thinking the next time I make it, I'll substitute raisins for the carrots after using the mixer to see how that tastes and actually make the cream cheese icing. Thank you for sharing!

I've made this cake twice now, and both times it was a big hit!  It was so good, the second time I made it was for my sons birthday cake.  I love the oranges instead of pineapple in this one.  This is now one of my favorite cakes!  I make it exactly as the recipe states but I usually do end up baking it an extra 5 minutes roughly.  Thank you Kali for a great carrot cake!

Hands down the best carrot cake I’ve ever had! This was so good that it’s my first review ever on here...at least that I can think of lol! Anyway my family and I don’t dig the nuts and coconut that traditionally goes in carrot cake like another used said. This cake is amazing and so moist. I made my own frosting by using about half to 3/4 of canned frosting (cream cheese flavor) and then adding a whole block of room temp Philadelphia cheese. I added some lemon juice and some grated lemon zest and orange zest until I got the taste I was looking for. I’m not good with measurements so I just taste until I like. Spread on top and enjoy! Also kept in fridge due to cream cheese. We heated a piece up in the microwave for 20-30 seconds when we wanted one and oh my gosh!!!!

This was lusciously fluffy and moist. The addition of mandarin oranges and orange zest, plus the perfect amount of spice, really knocked this out of the ballpark.  Since my husband loves nuts, I added a few crushed walnuts,  although it is perfect as written.

Very easy to make. I added raisins and walnuts and baked in two 9” round pans,  350* for about 40 minutes. Topped with a basic cream cheese frosting. DELUCIOUS!

It was good, just wish recipes would use weight measurements instead of cups, I did a bit a research and weighed the main ingredients, went light on the oil and sugar for health reasons but the cake turned out delicious, oh and used more carrots than stated and could have taken more,

I made this today.  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar.  The manderian oranges had plenty of sweetness.  I also sprinkled chopped walnuts over the frosting.  It will be gone soon.  Very tasty however.

This cake was so good!  I had to make it gluten-free and dairy-free.  I used gf flour and for the icing I used vegan cream cheese.  I wonder what it tastes like with gluten and dairy because without, it was great!

Doubled the recipe, used a mix of crushed pineapple & applesauce, I had no mandarin oranges to hand. I did half of brown & white sugar ( I don’t usually use white sugar). I added some raisins soaked in Jamaican red rum!!  This is the 2nd time I’m making this. It was a big success for Christmas Lunch.

I prefer a more spicy carrot cake. Therefore will have to experiment  with the quantities of cinnamon and nutmeg in this recipe. Perhaps I will add some allspice next time. Having said that; the cake is nicely light and the family enjoyed.

This cake is excellent! Not to sweet & the crumb texture is perfect. My 13 year old granddaughter just baked her 1st from scratch cake using this recipe & everyone RAVED. I have to confess it is better than the recipe I’ve been using for years. I wasn’t sure how I was going today feel about no nuts or raisins in it, but now I can say it does not need those things. Delicious

I had high hopes for this cake but they were dashed.  I followed the recipe exactly and the result was a very bland, boring cake even with the addition of a tangy cream cheese icing.  I won't be making it again.

Wow, this is a delicious cake!  You really only get a hint of orange, so don't be afraid.  The cake is moist and a little lighter than the typical dense carrot cake.  I just searched for a cream cheese icing recipe to use.  Try it, you will love it!

It is a delightful recipe. Mine could have used more orange zest for extra flavor. Much better a few days later. The moisture really increases. I used basic cream cheese frosting. It was a hit at the Easter Dinner.

This was a wonderfully moist, delicious and easy to prepare cake. Instead of using cinamon and nutmeg, I used allspice . also I iced it with cream cheese frosting.

Made this for Easter the day before.  It is indeed lighter then other recipes.  I followed the recipe and only added cream cheese frosting which I always add a dash of pineapple juice.  My son loved it and took a huge chunk home as well.  My husband said it taste better the third day.  I like the light cake after a big meal but he likes my recipe better.  So I'll post it this week.

I made these as cupcakes for Easter.  It was delicious.  Very moist and gave them a bit of a citrus undertone.  Topped them with a butter cream frosting....awesome!

This was my first time making a carrot cake from scratch, and it was a hit. Everyone liked it- it was moist and delicious. Even the chocolate lovers in my family wanted more!

This  cake was great. The reason for a rate of four was I didn't see a frosting recipe. The other is the process of preparation is a little complicated for some. I will make it again because I love to cook from scratch some people don't.

This carrot cake is the best!  I made if for Easter and everyone commented on how moist and flavorful it was. Even those that typically don't like carrot cake tried it and loved it!  I followed the recipe as directed and came out perfect.  Made my own cream cheese icing.

I would definitely make it again.  It was a lovely fresh taste and especially enjoyed the Orange Zest flavour and just enough spices.

Followed the recipe as written but without the zest (didn't have any) and it turned out wonderful! I did have to bake it for a bit longer but that's probably just my oven.  Definitely will keep and make again. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Craved this cake for 20yrs! Finally made it but it wasn't quite like Mom made, but quite lovely and my Mom really liked your recipe. Thanks for sharing! I used a little container of mandarin oranges in jello (stirred it until jello broke up some). And for the icing, I used some orange juice to give it the tang I remember Mom having in hers.

I made this according to the recipe. It was satisfactory, but lacked the moistness I expected. I will adjust the  flavor and texture complexity next time by adding nuts, coconut, and/or pineapple.

Amazing taste; wonderfully moist.  Served it at school for a snack; received a thumbs up. Need to make again!!
