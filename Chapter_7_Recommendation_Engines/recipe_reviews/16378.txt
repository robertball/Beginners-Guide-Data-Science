The whole family gave this recipe a thumbs up.  I cooked mine in the crock pot so that the pork chops came out nice and tender.  Next time I would use half the water called for so that the gravy is a little thicker but we all thought the flavor was great! Thanks Karen.

Yum! This was really good.  I used 3 boneless porkchops and browned them on each side for about 3-5 minutes.  I then placed them in a casserole dish and put sliced onions and 1 can of mushrooms on top.  I then put the mushroom soup mixture on top of it (I used 1/2 of the onion soup mix and 1/2 cup of milk). I baked this covered for 30min and then uncovered for 15min. Delish!  Great with mashed potatoes.

This is a fabulously versatile recipe!  I always add at least a half pound of mushrooms (because we love them so much).  Works really well over egg noodles - don't even have to butter them.  I would reduce the water by just a little bit for thicker gravy...the longer you let it cook, the more water is absorbed.  Recipe as is is too thin for rice.  For a change of pace, use chicken breasts instead of pork, but greatly reduce water (1/4-1/2 can) since the chicken doesn't take long to cook.

Like another reviewer's partner, my boyfriend also raved about this dish before he even tasted it!  I added an extra cup of water and 1/2 cup long grain white rice, making it a one-dish meal.  It was done in only 50 minutes.  I will make this again soon.

This was wonderful! Quoting my husband, "...not too salty, pork chop is tender, and not bland". I put half the amount of onion soup mix that was required. Also, I put half the amount of water, which made the gravy the right consistency to pour over garlic mashed potatoes. To add some zing to it, I garnished the top with crispy fried onions during the last 3 minutes of baking. One last thing, I shortened the baking time to 55 minutes for 1/2 inch thick of chops. This was a great recipe and very easy, will definitely make it again. Thank you.

This was passable but really not that great... especially as is.  I made the recommended changes based on previous reviews and I'm still not that impressed.  It was okay but I won't be making it again.  It just isn't as good as my go-to pork chop recipe.

This was a hit with entire family. Souper easy, and yes a little salty, just use low sodium soup. Chops were real tender. Used milk instead of water and don't cover when baking.

This was so easy and it was fabulous with a side of rice. I used the Lipton's Golden Onion soup mix and the 98% low fat version of cream of mushroom soup...I'm on Weight Watchers. I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper before searing. Chops were moist, sauce was great...total comfort food!! 6 points with rice!

I gave this a 4 Star rating because for a busy family, this is fast, easy & delicious.
 Like other reviewers, I too, suggest less water and less cooking time (the boneless pork chops were done in 1 hour.)
  I used Crimini Mushrooms, next time I'll add more than the one cup called for. I also added  fresh garlic.
 This is not an extraordinary dish but how many week day suppers are? 
 The good points are it requires practically no effort & you'll probably have all the ingrediants on hand. Best of all, my whole family enjoyed it. That's good enough for me; thanks, Karen.

I thought this recipe was okay but nothing to write home about.  I even doubled the soups and added some extra garlic per previous reviews and still thought it only tasted okay.  I don't regret trying it, everyone ate some without complaint but nobody bragged it up either.  I think I'll keep looking.  Thank you anyways.

This looks great, but please tell me how thick these pork chops are....baking in a 350 degree oven for an hour and a half, I am guessing they are pretty thick. Also - is this recipe for bone-in or boneless pork chops. Thanks.

I give this recipe 5 stars as is, for being fast, easy, and pretty tasty. I tweaked it a bit the 2nd time and thought it was even better. I used only half of the packet of soup mix (Beefy Onion) because I wanted to add a little of my own spices, a few dashes garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. I used the full can of liquid, I didn't think it was too runny at all (as some others suggested). I did however use 1% milk instead of water. I used button mushrooms, but might try a portabella next time.
This would be wonderful served over potatoes or rice, but I prefer egg noodles and it was delish! I served it with some steamed green beans. Over all, a great pork chop, which I usually have trouble with! They stayed tender and flavorful!

Bone in chops are a MUST.  Hubby hates mushrooms, so I used low sodium cream of chicken soup and did not add fresh mushrooms.  Final product was fall off the bone tender, but salty, bland, and very much akin to the gravy on a chicken fried steak.   The second time around (see my custom recipe), I browned 2 DRY pork chops (salt & pepper to taste) in 1 tbsp unsalted butter on each side.  Removed chops and deglazed pan with dash of white wine, added minced onion and 4 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tbsp cayenne, 1/2 tbsp dried parsley.  When liquid had evaporated, I added 1 tbsp flour, stirring constantly until roux was brown.  Added low sodium cream of chicken soup and 1 can water to the party.  Boiled stirring constantly for a few moments.  Returned pork chops to the pan with juices.  Covered and baked.  Much improved.

WoW! This is definitely one of my new favorite recipes! I decided to make it because of it's ease and variety, never expecting it to be SO delicious! I followed the recipe to a T and it was great! The chops came out so tender and my 3year old and 10month old couldn't stop eating it, not to mention my husband. The only issue was that it was slightly too salty, probably from the onion soup mix. Next time I will try to find a lower sodium version or a low sodium soup if available. Despite the saltiness, it was still excellent and I will be making it again and again! Thanks for sharing diggetydog!

I used 6 pork chops and so doubled the sauce to serve with 1 lb of egg noodles. As the recipe is written, it is way too salty. There is potential here however, and so if there is a next time I will half the onion soup mix.  All of the water called for is also unnecessary in my opinion - for my double batch I only used about a quarter of a can just to help mix the ingredients. I added some fresh ground pepper, sweet paprika and savory to the sauce which worked well.

This is so good! I had to double the recipe. I used one envelope of onion soup mix, crushed half of a small can of french fried onions and then topped the casserole with the remaining french fried onions. Thank you for a very tasty recipe!

I have done this in the oven and in a crock pot.  The meat comes out tender every time.  I'm not a big fan of the flavor and the saltiness though.  I only use 1/2 package of the onion soup mix to try and cup down on it.

Yum!  The chops fell apart they were so tender.  I didn't brown the chops because my mother never did.  Also, I used 2 cans of soup since I like extra gravy for potatoes and I didn't mix the onion soup mix in with the mushroom soup, I just sprinkled it on top.  Made for easy clean up with less dishes.  Love it!

I gave this 5 Stars but only because I used chicken breasts instead of pork chops.  I used two breasts (used a mallet to make them 1/2 thick).  Cut each breast into 5 or 6 pieces.  Used 3/4 can of milk instead of water.  Used 1/2 package onion soup mix.  This came out great.  Made a good gravy.  It was enough for my husband and I (and enough leftovers for my two neighbors).  My husband requests this weekly.  I did use pork chops the first time I made this and they were tough.

This was good.  The pork was very tender, but was a little bland.  I did dredge the pork in flour before browning in the electric skillet.  I used the skillet for the entire meal instead of using the oven.  I used roasted garlic mushroom soup.  I will probably make again.  Thanks for the post.

My family really liked this, I liked how easy it was.  I used Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom with reduced sodium. I think otherwise it would have been much too salty as others have mentioned.

I made this one day when I had company and everyone loved it.  I got a call from the person that had it at my house and they asked for the recipe.  It made such tasty gravy.

Great recipe!  I only used 1 cup of water & the sauce turned out very nice.  Next time I will only put in 1/2 of the soup mix as it was very salty as others have mentioned.  Both of my kids loved it!  I didn't have time to make rice so I just boiled some ramen noodles (no seasoning) & some green beans...put some meat & sauce over the noodles & put a little sauce on the beans.  It was very good.  I will definately make it again but next time in the crock pot so the meat will be even more tender.  The cooking time was probably only 45 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Sorry, It gets one star because it is so salty.  We did eat this for dinner, but not again.  I used low sodium soy sauce and it was still salty.

I thought this was really good! It was so easy to prepare and would be great for a busy night ~ especially since I already had all of the ingredients on hand. Will definitely make this again! I read the reviews before making this and cut the water in half and was glad I did. Served over rice and this worked out well because there was so much sauce! Yum! I used 4 boneless chops and  baked for 1 hr. I will try reduced sodium soup next time as it was a little salty.

This recipes was so easy to make although I did make some changes. I cut the pork chops into cubes and cooked on the stove top. When they were nice and tender I added a teaspoon of chopped garlic and a teaspoon of garlic powder.  I did as other reviews and only added half a pack of the onion.  Although next time will omit the whole onion or add less than half since the flavor to the onion is very strong. Dish came out great.

This was very easy to throw together. I used assorted chops so after I browned them and put them in the casserole dish they didn't take but about 25 min. to cook. I will definitely be making this again and again.

This tasted pretty good but I wouldn't exactly call it a casserole because it was so incredibly soupy.  If something was added in the mix to thicken it up I would've given it a full 5 stars.

Wouldn't use onion soup mix again - too salty. Maybe substitute other spices? Otherwise was very tasty.

Followed recipe with only one change.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used low sodium cream of chicken soup.  It was tasty, we will make it again.

This dish was perfect for our putluck.  Took a 45 minute car ride with it and everyone raved! I used Lipton Garlic and Herb Mix in place of Onion Mix as I picked up the wrong box.  It was delicious.  Thanks!

Really, really easy recipe.  A little salty, but I like that.  I only have canned mushrooms and added a sliced onion for some texture.  Served over white rice with Jasmine's brussel sprout recipe from this site.

I used chopped onions instead of the onion soup and still was excellant.  I used a grill pan to brown the chops and got the nice browning in the pan which I'm sure added to the flavor.  Make again!

Wow! This was delicious!! I added extra mushrooms and chopped onion, seasoned the chops with salt and pepper before browning, and baked for 30 min. covered, then 15 min. uncovered. Incredibly easy and delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

This is going to my recipe box!  Everyone loved it.  I made no modifications (except for slicing a pork loin instead of using chops) - but I should have doubled the recipe.

Doubled the recipe for 8 chops.  Used 1 package of onion soup mix to 2 cans of mushroom soup, 1 and 1/2 soup cans of milk instead of water and fresh ground pepper.  Good flavor, but the gravy was still too thin for my taste.  Next time I'll use less liquid.  Very easy recipe, will definately make again.

I didn't fry my chops first.  I also used two cans of soups and one can of milk.  I recommend using the low sodium soups because with the onion soup mix it is quite salty.  I served it with mashed potatoes, next time I will cook the potatoes and other vegetables with the casserole.  I'll keep this recipe and continue to play around with it until I find a mix I like.

Served over egg noodles. This was tasty, but the pork ended up very dry. Will probably make it again, but reduce the time drastically.

This was very good.  The only thing I did different was I used two cans of soup with one can of milk instead of water.  It cut back on the salt from the onion soup mix and the milk makes it thicker like gravy.  Very good...I will make this again.

I only give this 3 stars. The flavor was good, just way to much salt. If you make this do not add that much onion soup mix! I will make this again just with less soup mix. Thanks for the posting.

Not bad. This is a good base recipe. I doctored it up by first browning the pork chops in an olive oil/butter combination. I also replaced the water in the recipe with milk and heavy cream. I added ground sage, fresh minced garlic and black pepper.  It was a tad salty for me but my husband didn't think so. Served the pork chop atop roasted garlic/cream cheese mashed potatoes. It was easy to prepare, don't think I would serve to anyone other than family. Also, I sliced the mushrooms instead of dicing.

This was over all really good. I took the advice from the others and cut the H2O in half. Next time I will only use a 1/4th can of H2O. I also used "2 chops and the cooking time was 1 hour.

Well, my husband and I didn't think this dish was that wonderful.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  I changed the soup to roasted garlic cream of mushroom for added flavor as another reviewer did, but it still didn't do anything for us.  Also, my boneless pork chops were done in 1 hour.

Super easy recipe!  I browned the chops in an stovetop-to-oven pan which made it a one-dish meal.  Very tasty way to prepare lean chops.  I served wild rice as a side and the sauce was delicious with it.  Kids may not like all the mushrooms, but, if your kid is a mushroom lover like mine are, they'll love it, too!

Fabulous. Pork chops were moist and tender.  I added garlic powder to the soup mixture and served  with noodles.  Fresh mushrooms would be very nice to. A must-have recipe.

My husband is usually leary of me trying new recipes, but the moment I took this out of the oven he was raving about it!  (He hadn't even tasted it yet!)  We love lots of gravy, so I doubled the recipe (with the exception of the pork), and his only suggestion was that I add some fresh onions the next time I make it!  I can't say enough about this recipe!

This recipe was quick and easy. It had a wonderful flavor and the meat fell off the bones. I would definately have this again for supper. Thank You.

Thank you for all the great advice.  I actually had 8 thin chops that I seasoned and seared and placed in a large pan.  I then used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup and added water to them - not milk - in a pot (I actually added an extra 1/2 can of water because of the rice). I warmed it up just to get rid of chunks than added chopped carrots, dried shitake mushrooms, and 1.5 cups of long grain white rice and added butter.  I just stirred it for a second then poured it over the chops into the pan. Covered with foil and baked at 350 for 50mins.  It was so good!  The rice turned out so yummy and the meat was great!  What a great one pan meal that gives you time to play, talk, do homework with your kids when they are home from school.

Great recipe. I followed it except that I used the low fat version of cream of mushroom and it was still delicious!!! Next time I will probably use fresh onions as well

Add baked sliced potato. Cook onions and mushrooms when browning the chops. Add a little hot sauce and cheese on top about 20 min. before done.

After reading the reviews, I used 6 thin, bone in pork chops, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms, 1 package lipton onion soup mix,  1/2 soup can of water, 1 cup sour cream, a little dried parsley and about 1 clove of garlic.  I did not brown my pork chops becasue I thought they would be overcooked.  Worked great!  -- We served it over rice and loved it.  I'll try it with chicken next time.

Super easy and the pork chops were so tender! A big hit with the family! I may add a little corn starch next time...I doubled the recipe and the sauce was a little watery in consistency, but that had no negative effect on the flavor. YUM!

I wish I could give this one 4.5 stars. I think the cook time might be off. I cooked for an hour and my chops were a bit dry so next time- 45 minutes should be good. Otherwise, this was great. I used 2 cans of soup to one can of water and the gravy was perfect and tasty. I just needed some extra salt and pepper. Easy and yummy- just what dinner should be. Thanks!

I thought this recipe was awesome! I used the full amount of water called for, so I took the advice of another reviewer and served it with egg noodles instead of rice. It worked well. I added more mushrooms than called for because I really love mushrooms. My only complaint about this recipe is it was a bit too salty for my taste. Next time, I might try reducing the dry onion soup to see if that helps out.

I've been making a version of this recipe for years. I omit the dry onion soup, way to salty, and use the cream of mushroom soup and fresh mushrooms (8oz.) size but I slice and fry them before adding them to the soup. I also add 1 T. of Soy Sauce to the soup and mushrooms before baking for 1 hr.

This was very easy to make, tasty, but very salty.  Maybe next time I will use half the pack of dry soup mix.  I think that was where the salty taste came from.

This is SO GOOD!  The pork chops turned out super tender and the gravy was awesome!  I added dry Onion and Mushroom soup as opposed to just Onion and it was still Super delicious!  Very easy and quick for a night when you just don't have time for preparation.

This recipe was very good.  My husband and boys raved about it.  It was so easy to put together and the pork chops just fell apart.  The only thing is I wish the gavy would have been thicker.  I may have to experiment next time.

Very easy recipe that yield a nice comfort food kind of meal.  I seasoned the chops a little before browning.  I usually find that recipes calling for a full envolope of onion soup mix are too salty for our tastes so I used on 1/2 envie in this recipe.  I also used milk instead of water for the gravy.  This was yummy with rice.

A good, average meal for home cooking. I bought the healthy choice soup to try to reduce the sodium. Omitted the mushrooms. This was ho-hum, but it was a hot dinner. Thanks for the post.

I placed fresh sliced mushrooms and thinly sliced onions on top of boneless porkchops. Then instead of water and soup mix- i just added a few spices to a thick cream of mushroom soup and milk mixture to pour over top. Cooked for 45 min.(covered for 30, uncovered for 15)

Recipe was nice alternative to regular pork chops.  I use boneless ones and it only took about an hour to bake.  I also removed 1/4 of the onion mix as per the advice of other reviews and glad I did.  It would have been way to salty with it

I thought this recipe was easy, used readily available ingredients, and tasted very good.  To make this recipe even easier(and to cut down on pans to clean) I did not pre-brown my boneless loin chops, but just placed them uncooked in the pan.  I added 1 cup of uncooked rice to soup mixture as well to make it a "one pan meal". I used 1 soup can of water and, even with the added rice, the sauce was still runny...next time I will try 1/2 can water. I used a 4.5 oz jar of sliced mushrooms.  I covered my pan with foil because of the rice, but sauce/rice were plenty thin, so next time will bake uncovered. My 4 boneless loin chops with the rice, took 1 hour 15min to cook. This is good, easy, tasty weekday meal.  Will definitely try again.

Way too soupy for our taste and the chops were over cooked.  I might try again with only about 1/4 cup of water and cook for no more than an hour.

Good, easy recipe.  I made exactly as directed.  Next time I would cover while baking and possibly bake longer or better yet, make in the crockpot.  I prefer pork that falls apart.  Husband and son loved it!

My husband loved these.  I doubled the batch and used one can of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and one can of plain cream of mushroom with only one envelope of onion soup mix.  Very tender and tasty.  Great recipe that I will make again.

My husband put one forkful of this dish in his mouth and pronounced it great.  It was a little too salty for my taste, but using less of the onion soup mix would probably fix that problem.  Quick and easy to prepare.  It will stay on my keeper list.  Thanks!

Good, but.  If you sneak in a shake of savoury, a shake of granulated garlic , ground pepper and oh ya, a pinch of cayenne. With a shot of Worcester sauce, it is now even gooder.

My husband said these are the best pork chops I've ever made! I put some French fried onions on the last 15 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer, and we really liked that... also, I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so used jarred and they were fine. Fresh would probably have been better, but it was too cold to run to the store.

I made some changes though. I didn't use the onion soup packet(didn't have any on hand and takes too long to drive to the store for just that lol.) and used a little bit more water added some small onions(whole) from our garden. I put mushrooms onions and soup with water in a sauce pan and partially cooked it. I had thin sliced - bone in and fried them up. Put them in a 9 X 13 baking dish poured soup mixture over it put in 350° and baked for 45 minutes. Tasted so good next time I'll try it with a mushroom gravy.

Do NOT bake it for 1 1/2 hours. I thought that was too long to begin with so cut it down to one hour. I had 2 1/2 pounds of 2" thick pork chops. I pulled it out of the oven after 1 hour and the meat temperature was OVER 200 degrees. I hate overcooking meat and I suppose I should have checked the meat at 1/2 hour.

So I made this as directed with onion and mushroom dry soup mix and heart healthy cream of mushroom soup. I did not make any other changes. I used bone in pork chops about 1 inch thick. I was worried from the reviews it would be too salty but I found it kind of boring. Not too salty at all. The sauce was VERY thin and I cooked it the full 1 1/2 hours as directed and the sauce did not get thicker nor did the water burn off. The pork itself was ok. The sauce itself was ok. I really liked how easy it was to put together. And it smelled amazing cooking, but it was just ok in flavor. I would season the pork as I brown it next time and I would probably definitely use much less water or even omit the water to help with the salt level and thickness of the sauce. I probably would not make this as is again though.

Chops are now in the crock pot so, I won't know exactly how they turn out for a while.  But.........I had to alter the recipe as to the amount I needed.  I used 6 very thickly cut chops, put a few slivers of garlic inside each one.  I also used a family size can of cream of mushroom soup, a tad bit of Worcestershire Sauce, an entire package of dry onion soup mix, fresh mushroom slices and enough water for a nice gravy consistency.  Also of course browned the chops as directed.  I tasted the gravy mixture before adding to the chops, not too salty because I had basically double of everything.  Tasted wonderful not even in the crock pot yet!  Am anxious to see how these turn out.....will update.  You really could serve these with noodles or potatoes, it's a versatile recipe. I don't see why you couldn't add sliced potatoes and onions if so desired.  I think I'll go with buttered egg noodles tonight and a nice salad.  Thanks for this (assumingly) great recipe!  It seems like a wonderful starter recipe!

Okay, I did follow suggestions from other reviewers. I replaced the water with milk and cut the amount to 1/2 half the amount of liquid called for. I used 1/2 packet of onion soup mix and because my chops were thinner cut the cooking time to 50 minutes. The gravy was not thin and the meat was tender.

 The taste is good but nothing spectacular  but it is basic, thrifty, quick and easy.

Glad I read a bunch of reviews. First I cut the water by half.  Sauce came out just thick enough.  Added 5-6 sliced Crimini mushrooms . Didn't salt the chops before browning as I thought there would be enough salt in the onion & mushroom soup mixes. Glad I did that.  Here's a warning about cooking time.  I used 2 boneless loin of pork  chops.  They were rather thick, 1 1/2 to 2 inches.  I covered the baking dish in aluminum foil as I was concerned that the soup mixes, water & mushrooms mix would cook off in the oven & dry out. Glad I did.  The recipe calls for cooking the chops for 90 minutes in total.  IMHO this is WAY TOO LONG.  I checked my chops after about 55 minutes and almost had a heart attack.  I won't even tell you what the internal temperature was.  I thought for sure I had ruined the chops.  I think what saved dinner was covering the casserole with aluminum foil.  The chops were slightly over cooked and a little dry (not much) but still very tender.  If the chops had been thinner (Or God forbid thin sliced chops), I'm thinkin' that they would have been like shoe leather.  SO... Keep a watchful eye on the temperature of the chops.  If your using a standard cut chop, I would recommend checking the temperature after about 30 minutes (maybe even less).  I'm gonna try this again.  There was just something missing.  I can't put my finger on it just yet. Maybe some garlic or some herbs, thyme or sage or something and next time I'll use an oven thermometer inserted in the

My husband and I loved it.  After browning the pork chops in the skillet, I sauteed onions and mushrooms in the same pan to pick up some of yummy flavors left in the pan.  Then added  in the reduced fat/sodium cream of mushroom soup and unsalted beef broth (instead of onion mix and water) in the onion mushroom mixture and heated it up for a minute or two before pouring over the pork chops.

Family loves this recipe. I use 2 cans of COM soup and a whole envelope of the onion soup mix. I only used 3/4 can of water because I was out of milk. I didn't want it too  thin.

I have been making this dish for years!  My mother made it often but here are our tweaks:  Using about 5-6 boneless chops, brown and set aside.  Saute some mushrooms and add the mushroom soup, 1/2 can of beer (any kind) and 2 T. of the dry onion soup mix--stir together well.  Add the browned chops and simmer for about 20 minutes.  It takes about 10 min. of prep work.  

It's not exactly healthy but it's delicious and husband loves it!  The gravy is great over brown rice.

It was tasty, and the bonless pork ribs I used came out great and tender. The only issue I have is the name. It really isn't a casserole. Also, half a can of water makes it less watery when it comes out of the oven.

My first review. Overall, this was only okay. The pork chops were somewhat dry after cooking for one hour. I added one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery to the soup mixture and added extra celery and potatoes on top along with a half can of milk. I did not brown the meat so maybe that would have helped the flavor. Pork chops tasted bland sorry to say.

Excellent! Very easy to make too. I added the extra mushrooms, cut down on the water to thicken the gravy and my pork chops were done after 45 minutes. Definitely will make this again.

I prepared this recipe tonight and it was a big hit with everyone.  It was easy, fast and delicious!  I used a full small carton of mushrooms instead of the 1 cup in the recipe as another member did.  The gravy was really good on mashed potatoes and next time I may add sliced onions and sliced potatoes as in the standard pork chop/potato casserole.  All in all this is a great dish!

I was trying to figure out what to do with some leftover pork roast and this recipe was the answer! I chopped up the pork, covered with the soup mixture, and baked for probably an hour covered. This made a delicious dinner served over noodles with some green beans as a side dish. Thanks for the great recipe! My family loved it and I didn't let good leftovers go to waste!

A bit embarrassing, since I never make things from packages, but a friend of mine made these for me once and now it's the only way I cook pork chops!!  This recipe is perfect as is.  Also try it with beefy onion soup mix and/or cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic!  It really doesn't need water added b/c of the mushroom liquid that gets released, but that's a preference.  I wouldn't call it a "casserole" though.

This is a quick easy recipe to prepare, but just a little too salty for my taste.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and everything was perfect (except for the salt).  This made a perfect gravy for my baked potatoes.  I would like to try again using low sodium soup and maybe half of the dry soup mix as others suggested. Also, I think more     mushrooms would be good too.

This is an excellent recipe and one I've been making for over 20 years. I put long grain rice on the bottom of the casserole dish and it comes out perfectly everytime I make it. I was a bit surprised to see someone else using the almost same exact recipe as mine, but it is a great dish!

Quick prep, easy, delicious! What more can you ask for.  I like to put a layer of sliced mushrooms under the chops in the baking pan to help keep it from sticking.

This is a family favorite.  I like to use Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup and the package of onion soup mix.  Also, at the end of your cooking, you can top with some Durkee fried onions and put back in the oven for ~ 5 minutes to make a really pretty and flavorful topping.  I always use the Hormel center cut pork chops and these come out perfect!

This was good.  I used the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and 1/3 of a pkg of onion soup mix that I already had open.  I used 1/2 can of milk instead of water and still thought the gravy was a bit thin.  I had 3- 3/4 inch pork chops and 2- 1/2 inch pork steaks in the pkg I thawed for this dish.  I would use all chops next time and trim more fat.  Due to time constraints, garlic instant mashed potatoes were served with it.

Just made this for dinner and while it was really easy and quick, I must say the presentation wasn't the best and the meat was a little bland.  Next time, I will sear the meat first, as cooking the meat in the creamed/water mixture created more water than I'd like to see for "gravy".  I ended up scooping a good deal of the "gravy" out and making rice (which came out really good).  The remaining "gravy" is in the oven thickening up; I will put it over the rice/meat once on our plates.  Overall, this was a good recipe, but you WILL need to tweak it to your taste.

This recipe is easy and tasty. It is very high in sodium though, so not recommended for those on a low-sodium diet. Next time I will reduce the heavy salt flavor by using low-sodium soup and only half the onion soup mix. Also, the title is misleading because this really isn't a casserole.

This wasn't bad, but not the best I've had.  I give it 4 stars because of the simplicity of preparation.  I personally had to make my own modifications to give it enough flavor.  My husband and I are avid spice fans.  I felt the recipe as it is didn't have the flavor we were looking for.

This is a tasty, easy way to make pork chops.  I didn't brown the chops first -- too lazy!  And I think they turned out just fine.  Also, only used half a soup-can of water, and there was plenty of gravy after cooking.

The flavor was very good, but my pork chops really dried out.  Next time I'll check them after 30 minutes.  But, will make again with shortened cooking time.  Thanks!

This was very good. Based on the reviews by others - I reduced the onion soup mix, used a little less water, and a larger can of the mushroom soup. I'm glad I made the changes - otherwise it would have been way too salty.

I mean, it's not a spectacular recipe that I would prepare for dinner guests, but I will definitely make it again sometime, just for me and my husband.

I loved this recipe! I think next time I'll add less water, since I like the souip more like a gravy consistency, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. I served rice and a salad, for an easy meal!

I used about 2/3 of the onion soup mix package and it wasn't too salty.  The sauce was quite a bit runny than I was expecting or would have liked.  I'm not sure if I will make this again, but if I do I will try it with less water.  The flavor was pretty good, but I'm not sure if it was good enough to do again.

The pork chops came out so tender and juicy and the sauce was very tasty.  It came out a little too salty, probably from the combination of canned soup and soup mix, without enough water to dilute.  Next time, I'll halve the amount of soup mix and give that a shot.  An easy weekday dish!

I must be doing something wrong.  The pork chops were pretty bland really.  And i asked the meat dept guy for a good piece of pork which would bake well.  It cam out dry. I haven't had any luck with the pork chop casseroles.

These are great. I made them in the crockpot and used the exact same ingredients. I only had 3 frozen pork chops so i just threw them in the crock pot frozen.  Left them in there for 8 hours on low then served over whole wheat noodles. Yum!

My half-inch boneless chops needed 30 minutes in the oven.  I thought the gravy was too salty with less than the full can of water... and who doesn't want extra gravy for their rice??  I used canned mushrooms and 98% fat-free COM.

We enjoyed this meal, however it was a bit too salty. We will make it again and try 1/2 package of the dry soup mix. I also cut down the amount of water and the sauce was thick and perfect over brown rice. Thanks for a great recipe!

A fast meal that tasted delicious. I stuck with the recipe except for the mushrooms, I cooked them whole instead of slicing them up. The kids don't like them, so it was easier to serve without having to pick mushroom pieces out. Definitely will be making this again.

This is a very good recipe. Something different to do with pork chops. served with rice. Iused six pork chops and 2 cans of soup. this made enough gravy for both chops and rice, and still had some left! I will make this again.

These chops tasted great. But next time I will only cook them for about an hour, so they won't be so tough.

This recipe was WONDERFUL! The meat is so tender my 2 year old ate it right off the bone. It was so easy to make and practically effortless!

My family are not huge pork lovers but I used this recipe and it was quick, easy, and the meat fell off the bone. Well done!
