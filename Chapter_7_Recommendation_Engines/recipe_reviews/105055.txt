I used ice cream instead of the sweet milk and frozen mango chunks with a few frozen mixed berries and it tasted just like something i would get at orange julius

There's not way this would have made 5 servings for me, but it was still pretty good. I ended up adding ice to mine to make it more of a batida, I guess, but it would have been good without it...just not cold like I like my drinks.

Much too sweet. This only made 2 servings... not 5. My mangoes might have been bad, I don't know. It turned greyish yellow, and was very pulpy.

I made this two ways - as a drink and as an ice cream! Because I wanted the ice cream to have a creamy mouth feel, I used a combination of milk and heavy cream instead of just milk. Both were very good, but I preferred it as ice cream - maybe because it's been so hot and humid here in Georgia, that it just hit the spot after our Thai dinner tonight! Delicious!
