This recipe was really good, but I found it hard to make a smaller amount without creating a lot of waste. I also added an extra handful of feta cheese. All in all, it tasted awesome!  Lots to everyone to take some home!

Yum! I skipped the feta and made my own Italian dressing from a mix. Light and tasty summer pasta salad. Thanks :)

I doubled the recipe and made a few small changes. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. I omitted the feta cheese,
used grape tomatoes and only had 1/3 of the celery as that was all I had on hand. It still was a winner and I will make it again.

I did this but only used bell peppers,  purple onions, minced garlic and rotini pasta. After, I added Zesty Italian dressing and Parmesan on top. All the other veggies- my husband isn't fond of so I just took them out. It came out really good :)
