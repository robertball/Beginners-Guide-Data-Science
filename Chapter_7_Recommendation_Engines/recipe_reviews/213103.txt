OMG this recipe came out sooooo good after my modifications. I was hooked from the first bite!    I halved the recipe and used:   whole wheat flour instead of regular,   organic cane sugar instead of white sugar ,   Extra virgin olive oil instead of veggie shortening,and   soy milk instead of regular milk    I ommited the pecans because they were not available  at the time. I also put the cakes in two  buttered aluminum loave pans since I did not have any bundt pans.  I was expecting a catastrophe since when I was mixing the butters and sugars the olive oil floated a bit on top but in the end I got this beautiful delicious pound cake like dessert drizzled with tasty caramel sauce. The sauce was so good I see myself making it to coincide with some apples! This recipe is so easy and can be very great for events like garnishing with strawberries or bananas and leaving a bowl of caramel glaze in the middle, yum yum!

Although this cake was delish, there must have been an error in the recipe when it stated that you should pour the glaze over the cake while still in the pan, at least if you are using a bundt cake like the picture shows.  I let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turned it over onto a cake dish before I added the glaze.  Other than that, it was fantastic, thanks!

was very good, but just a regular cake texture.  Someone mentioned it growing over the sides of the bundt pan, and since detest cleaning my oven, I made a bundt pan AND 3 muffins!  This was the perfect amount in the 12 cup pan.  Rose right up to the top without spilling over.  TIP WITH THE SAUCE!!!  Boil for 4 minutes.  If using the bundt pan, cool and flip the cake onto a plate.  Pour 1/4 of the hot sauce on the cake and let the liquid seep in.  Let the remaining sauce cool for 15 or 20 minutes until it thickens and then pour the remaining over the cake so it stays where you put it. :)

Very good, I received many remarks about how wonderful it was. A nice change from traditional banana bread. I followed the recipe as far as the ingredients go. I baked it in a bundt cake pan and it rose above the rim of the pan. It also took 1 hr and 35min in my oven to finish baking. I allowed the cake to cool for the 10 min in the pan then turned it out onto a cooling rack. Then I used a spoon to slowly drizzle the glaze over the entire cake. It turned out very nice and pretty. Very moist! Make sure to allow to cool completely before covering.

Awesome cake - easy to make. I only made 1 change. After making the glaze, I added about 1/4 cup of Praline Liquor to the glaze, poked holes in the cake and spooned the glaze over bottom and let it sit for about 10 minutes, turned it out and poked additional holes and added rest of glaze.

Very good flavor - not quite as dense as a pound cake should be, IMO, hence 4 stars from me and not 5.  I substituted 2% milk for the heavy cream in the glaze and it was excellent.

Very tasty cake indeed!  There was way too much batter for my bundt pan, so I transferred the rest to a medium-sized loaf pan.  The cooking time was much longer than specified, and so I ended up turning the heat up to 350 to get it done a little faster.  But I think 325 in the beginning was a good start.  Only think I left out was the pecans as many people I serve cake do not like nuts, although I think it needs them.  And I left off the glaze and used my own brown sugar caramel glaze/frosting.  I actually followed a mixing technique from 'The Cake Bible'.  She actually mixes the dry ingredients in the bowl, on low, for 30 seconds, rather than just relying on sifting, and then adds in the butter and part of the wet ingredients all at once.  What this does is to help provide a 'coating' for the wheat and prevents the gluten strands from forming too quickly and getting too tough.  This keeps a cake fluffy and soft and moist without getting too tough or dry.  It works out beautifully.  I would agree with others, this cake isn't exactly a pound cake in texture, but it's a lovely cake either way.  Thanks!

Excellent cake that ages very well--it gets moister in the following days.  Made the cake several times and have found the following:
1) The pan matters!  The tube pan makes a superior cake versus a bundt pan. The cake is distributed more evenly in the tube pan.  Additionally, applying the glaze is done more effectively on a cake from a tub pan as the top is flat and the glaze sets up better.
2) Let both the the glaze and cake cool before applying the glaze.  If you apply the glaze when either the cake or glaze is hot than the glaze will essentially seep into the cake (ie, there will really be no glaze).
3) If you want some of the glaze inside the cake than I recommend put holes throught the top of the cake to about an inch from the bottom of the cake.  I found a chopstick to be the perfect size--the hole is big enough to poor glaze into but not so big you cannot cover it up with very cool glaze.  Note: save a small amount of glaze for plugging the holes--the glaze should almost be a dough-like consistency to plug the holes.
4) Lastly, ignore the part of the directions about pouring the glaze over the cake while still in pan--you will left with a cake where most of the glaze seeps into the top of the cake and becomes  indistinguishable from the cake itself (if done while warm). The cake is more appeasing with a visable glaze on top.

Not really a pound cake.  Nice and moist.  I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar and it was fine.  I also cheated because it was a busy day and used Smuckers Caramel Sauce.

Not as dense as poundcake or even banana bread, which is nice. Too sweet, though. I'll make it again, but I'll cut the sugar quite a bit. I also added some pumpkin pie spice.

I baked this cake, and it came out delicious. I was out of vanilla extract so I used one teaspoon of lemon extract & one teaspoon of almond extract. I also only had one cup of brown sugar so used 2 cups white sugar & 1 cup one brown sugar. The cake still came out delicious minus my substitutions. I also used vegetable oil instead of shortening. I think this recipe is just a no-fail recipe & the whole family loved it!!! Will indeed make again, except next time I'll have all the ingredients on hand. :)

I absolutely loved this cake! I made this for my mother-in-law for her birthday. She loved it!  I specifically enjoyed the carmel glaze and have used it on other cakes since then. I love the denseness of the pound cake too. It could be thought of as too heavy by some but I thought it was perfect, allowing the glaze to sink in just enough..

I agree with Alician, can't add all the sauce this makes to the bottom of a bundt cake. Change: make the sauce after the cake comes out, and pour most of it over the top. Good otherwise, I am eating a piece right now!

Awesome recipe!  I have made this several times and it always turns out perfect even when I have had to make substitutions.  I have been short and egg, or short a banana, added spices or not added spices, used the caramel glaze or a chocolate one or no glaze at all...whether I follow the recipe exactly or change things it's always delicious! I use this recipe for banana bread and cakes now and it is always a hit!

Made exactly as written except for glaze. I couldn't see how you would be able to put the glaze on while the cake was still in pan, let it cool then flip it to take out of pan?? That seemed like it would have been a huge mess? I cooled it in pan for ten mins flipped it , used a kabob skewer to poke about 15 holes in the cake then drizzled the glaze over the cake and topped the cake with more chopped pecans. Not much of the glaze seemed to get into the holes, maybe after sitting awhile, either way the cake turned out very moist and delicious ! Wish the glaze would thicken a bit more after sitting because it's a bit messy but tastes wonderful!

This is my second time of making this cake as is. Do not need to change a thing. I baked the cake in my Angel food cake pan and 4 cupcakes.  The cupcakes were moist and delicious with no glaze. Makes a wonderful bread also, just leave off the glaze. Definitely a keeper!!

What a perfectly delicious recipe!  Other than adding one teaspoon cinnamon to my dry ingredients, I followed the cake recipe as written.  It was done in 1 hour and 20 minutes.  I cooled the cake in the pan for 10 minutes and on a cooling rack for 10 minutes before adding the glaze.  The only change I made to the glaze was I didn't add the vanilla until it was removed from the heat.  This, I"m sure, is from habit.  Great recipe!

I ended up with WAY too much batter for a bundt pan, so my oven is a little messy now...! What I ended up with was pretty tasty, though. I used chocolate chips instead of pecans because one of the people I was making it for has a nut allergy. Also, I didn't use the glaze because the cake was really sweet on its own. If I ever make this again, I think I'll use half as much brown sugar.

best banana cake ever.  i almost left out the pecans as i'm not a big fan.  i'm glad i didn't.  i followed the recipe exactly except for the glaze.  i poured some over the cake while it was in the pan and the rest once i turned it out.  

i tried it while it was still warm.  it was fabulous.

This cake is EXCELLENT! I added pure vanilla extract out of habit and I only had 3 bananas on hand, so that is what I used. I didn't add the nuts. The cake is soooo good and even better the next day! Don't omit the caramel glaze because it is delectable and it is what makes this cake so special!! Will definitely be a staple in my home! :)

This was a fantastic use for surplus bananas!  I baked it in an angel food pan after reading how much it made and it worked out great!  Everyone loved the glaze on it too!  definitely a keeper in my recipe files!!  Thank you, Swanee, for sharing this wonderful recipe! :)

This is a wonderful recipe. I didn't do the caramel glaze but I baked the cake exactly as the directions say, no modifications.  Very moist.  I baked the batter in mini 1 cup bundts.  I'd say this is more a regular cake consistency, not a pound cake density.  Will use this recipe again!

Cake tasted fine, but got stuck in the bundt pan. So, I had a mess. I greased and floured the pan just like it said and left it in pan for 10 min. Maybe I should have let it cool 100% before removing.  Good thing I had a back up cake for the party.

Amazing cake! Make sure to mix this in a very large mixing bowl.  Also while baking, it came over the top of the bundt pan just a bit so I put a pan underneath it.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I may put some in a small bread pan so it won't spill over.  I took the advice of another and put the caramel glaze over the cake after I took it out of the pan.  Do NOT skip the home-made caramel glaze!  Absolutely wonderful.

Absolutely delicious! I did use all butter and skipped the glaze,  but otherwise went by the recipe,  and as many times as I've made it, it has always turned out perfect. I do use Bakers Joy to prepare  my pan, and nothing ever sticks.. Great recipe!
I use a 12 cup Nordic Ware fluted pan, so I've never had a problem with it overflowing

I tried this and I'm glad I did. The cake came out delicious and moist. The only addition that I made was I added some cinnamon to the batter, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Although I should have cut the recipe in half because I did wind up with a bit more batter than I needed.

Rich and delicious. Has a lighter texture than traditional pound cakes. I poured half the glaze into the pan as directed, but then poured the rest on the top after putting the cake on a platter. I had more batter than could fit in my bundt pan, so I ended up with an extra baby cake.

Used two cups whole wheat flour, one cup gluten free flour, coconut oil instead of shortening, 1/2 and 1/2 in the glaze (because that's what I had). Cooked 1 hour and 10 mins and next time would take out 5 min earlier. The cake did rise to the top of the pan but did not run over. Added about half of the glaze while still in the pan, after 10 mins I removed to a cake pan and poured the rest of the glaze over the top and used a brush to cover. It was very good!

Didn't have any nuts on hand, but it was delicious anyway.  I followed the recipe to the letter otherwise.  I was hesitant to bake it in my only bundt pan (heart shaped) because of other reviews about the large amount of batter...I think my pan may hold even less than standard ones.  I used a 13x9 stone pan and baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  It came out incredibly moist and the flavor is excellent.  It is slightly more dense than a regular cake, but, just as other reviewers have said, it isn't really pound cake texture.  I used a sharp knife to put slits in the cake every couple of inches or so, and poured the glaze over the cake while it was still pretty hot.  It soaked into the slits and left a thin coating on the top.  We ate it when it had cooled about 30 minutes and it was incredible! Definitely a recipe I will use again.

Made this cake for my brother's birthday. Followed the recipe but omitted the nuts and only had 3 ripe bananas. I prepared the non-stick bundt pan as directed, yet it got stuck. After getting it out and some places ripped, I was able to piece them back together. Poured the glaze on top instead of in the pan to cover the torn pieces. The cake was good, but not spectacular. The glaze tasted better than the cake which was a must on this cake. I thought it was ok. My family and relatives liked it.

Pretty good but I wouldn't consider a Pound Cake, it's a lot lighter.  Recipe worked good as mini bundt cakes.  I added mini chocolate chips & butter frosting.

Very good made as is.A very moist cake, but I would not call it a pound cake--still delicious! I skipped the caramel glaze and served it with sliced bananas, strawberries and hot fudge sauce--it was excellent!! Will try the glaze next time.This was a great ending to an early spring grilled BBQ meal.

I made this last night for my birthday. This is one of the best banana cakes ever, and the carmel sauce was really wonderful. My son does not like nuts so I just omited them and sprinkled them on half of the top of the cake after I glazed it. Absolutely wonderful. I will definately be making this again.. Thanks.

The only thing I did not according to the directions was to pour the icing on after the cake was out of the pan. The cake came out perfect, did not overflow the pan and looked just like the picture when done. Everyone who had a piece loved it! Definitely making it again!!!

I made this without adding the pecans (my daughter doesn't like nuts), but added some 'toasted' walnuts to the last bit of glaze mix and added to the top (for my taste and just to make it pretty).  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe today and although it's a good cake, it didn't have the texture of a traditional pound cake for me.
It is extremely moist with a great banana taste.

I forgot to add the whipping cream to the glaze mixture but think it came out good.  I didn't have shortening so used more butter in it's place.  The recipe shows the cake made in a bundt pan but the recipe calls for a fluted tube pan that is normally used for angel food cake and the middle lifts out.  I saw reviews where people put it in the bundt pan and had too much batter and it ran over and was difficult to glaze.  With the angel food cake pan, all of the batter fit into it and I was able to glaze the top in the pan.  It was delicious and moist and took to a church covered dish and people raved about it.

I halved the recipe with the following exceptions:  I used 3 eggs, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  Then I used butter flavored Crisco instead of the  butter and oil.  I used walnuts instead of pecans. And I used banana extract instead of vanilla.  A half recipe made just the right amount for a bundt pan.  This cake is good, it is very moist, but it isn't spectacular.  It did not have enough banana flavor to me, and it was lacking any other flavor.   In the recipe's defense, I did not use the glaze.  But that would not have changed my opinion on the flavor as the glaze would have only made it sweeter, and sweetness was not my issue.  This recipe needs some spices to enhance the flavors.  It was moist, but just too bland for me.  Unless you have a nut allergy, I would definitely use chopped nuts (not too fine), the nuts were a must or it would have really been lacking.

I had some bananas and I wanted to make a pound cake for my husband or banana bread, so I searched for banana pound cake and this came up. The only thing I added was ginger as I usually use some in my banana bread. I used Pam for baking on the pan and I only used half the glaze in the pan and the other half after I took it out of the pan. I am not a big cake eater although I bake a lot, mostly for my husband. the cake had a lovely texture and wasn't as dense as banana bread. I will have to see how long it lasts. I'm going to take some to work on Monday.

I liked the flavor, but the cake itself was a bit gooey and sticky.
That's not the result that I was looking for, and my family  didn't eat much either. They don't like it!

Always looking for different banana bread recipes.  Good reviews on this so tried it and not sorry. Per others I did cut back on sugar.  Also used white whole wheat for about a third of the regular flour. I had sour cream so used a full cup in place of milk.  This filled a loaf pan and also 2/3 of bundt pan, both perfectly done in 40 min.  (Always set timer for a good ten or more minutes before time recipe calls for, then check often). Husband said this is the best banana cake/bread, not too dry or crumbly with good texture.  :-) Oh, almost forgot to say we did not use the topping tasted good without.

This is an excellent recipe and I didn't make any changes. You could lessen the calorie content easily with just a few changes though. My family raved , including the young ones! Added to favorites and will make again! The caramel sauce could be used on almost any cake.

this was a huge hit.  I did NOT pour the caramel glaze over the cake while still in the pan. That was a disaster ready to happen.  The glaze is very liquidy and most of it poured down the side of the cake and didn't stick. I'd recommend pouring some of the liquidy glaze over (some of it soaks into the cake, num).  And then let the glaze cool down and set and when it's more solid, reglaze. Otherwise I made no changes and the cake was fabulous.

This is the best cake I ever made.  I've made banana bread many times, as we have about 100 banana trees in our yard (Hawaii), but this recipe will now be my new go to recipe.  Thank you.

I bought Walnuts instead of Pecans. The recipe said it took 4 hours to make from beginning to end. I made the cake in 20 minutes and let it bake for  90 minutes. I removed the cake from the pan fresh out of the oven. Fifteen minutes later I had the caramel sauce made, the cake covered and finished.  Took me approximately 2 hours & 15 minutes, not 4 hours. This cake was delicious.

I decided to use coconut oil in place of butter, and shortening. I used 1 cup organic coconut oil, and used organic brown sugar and granulated sugar. Then I switched out the flour for gluten free brown rice flour. I baked it for almost 2 hours to get it fully done @325 degrees, and it came out absolutely stunning! I did not put the drizzle on it because it looks pretty enough, and already has tons of sugar in it!

This was a VERY yummy cake.  Followed the directions exactly (except didn't add the nuts) and I had NO problems with sticking or overflowing in the pan.  Will definitely make this cake again!!  As stated in the directions, I put the glaze on while it was still in the pan, but I used a chopstick to poke holes in it first.  I would do everything exactly the same way next time.  Thank you for this delicious cake recipe!!

1) I've made this recipe for my office about 3 or 4 times. The first time, I removed the cake from the oven, poured the sauce on top of it while it was still in the bundt pan, and left it to cool overnight, because it was already getting late. The next day, I started freaking out when I could not separate the cake from the pan. So I cut it into slices while still in the pan and served on a platter. Everyone loved how moist it was since the sauce soaked through. I told a supervisor I had actually messed up, but he started asking for this "goof-up cake" for the office get-togethers. 2) I made this recipe for my mother the correct way and she broke her diet, because it's pretty irresistible if you like sweets. 3) When my supervisor requested the "goof-up cake" again, I sprayed the bundt pan with Pam baking spray with flour, which was more effective than butter spray alone in separating the cake from the pan. 4) Using a mini spatula that fits in the grooves of my pan made separating even easier.

I just made this recipe as written for our bed and breakfast guests.  It was too much batter for my Bundt pan, so I had leftovers of about 1 1/2 cups to put into my little Rachel Ray oval baker, for my husband and me.  I followed the suggestion of others and poked holes in the top of the cake AFTER I flipped it. Then I drizzled the glaze over.  Let me tell you, this glaze with the cream is heads above the plain brown sugar/butter glaze suggested for the apple cake with caramel glaze. (also a winner).  I'll use this glaze always - its' divine! Then I sprinkled additional nuts on the top for decoration, and to hide any holes the glaze didn't cover.

My cake had to cook the full hour and twenty minutes. It was amazing!  Not very dense, but the glaze takes it from light semi sweet to very sweet and yummy!  My husband, who gives true reviews, said, and I quote (bleeped), "Man, that shxxxxt is fxxxxxxg good!"  :O  Truer words were never spoken! :)

I have been using a recipe for 30 yrs using a yellow cake mix with a box of instant pudding and  bananas, but today I didn't have a cake mix, so found this recipe and it will ALWAYS be the recipe I use for banana pound cake.  I added a cup of flaxseed meal and I separated the eggs, beat the egg white and then folded them in, it made the best cake with a little added fiber. I used loaf pans and this recipe made 3 loaves. Glad I was out of cake mix!!!

Excellent! The cake is very moist, and delicious. I would definitely make this cake again. The only change I made is that I made the cake using einkorn flour.

With out the glaze, it's basically a dense banana bread - so don't omit the glaze!  This got *rave* reviews served within 5 or 6 hours of coming out of the oven.  After a night in the fridge, however, the remainder surprisingly lost its appeal.  Definitely will serve it only warm/fresh in the future.
