I was looking for a bread that would be great with a cup of coffee in the morning so I decided to use this recipe but just add more sweetness. I doubled the brown sugar and honey and instead of putting the almonds into the dough I mixed them with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and about 1 tbls of corn oil and sprinkled it all over the top and sides of the dough before baking it. I added 1 tsp. of pure almond extract to the dough. And I only used 1 tsp. of salt. This was exactly what I was looking for! It was very slightly sweet and crunchy on top and I love the tang from the cream cheese in the bread! I didn't do a second rise. I just let it rise for 1 hour in a greased 8"x8" baking dish with my almond/sugar topping, then just baked it at 350 degrees for 55-60 minutes! My house was filled with the lovely aroma of sweet almond bread! Perfect! I will be making this ALOT!

I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.  As another poster suggested, I doubled the sugar and honey.  I thought the dough was too large for one bread pan, and it took a long time to rise a little, but raised considerably while baking.  The loaf tastes good, but as with so many wheat breads, it is rather dense and a little hard to hold together when toasting.  I did like the flavor, but I like a bread that is a little more "spongy" and less crumbly. Perhaps next time I will divide it between two loaf pans and see if less weight makes it a little less dense.
