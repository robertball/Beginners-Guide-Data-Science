This cookie turned out well. I was however put off a bit by my sweetened coconut. I may try unsweetened next time or find a way to sweeten it myself. I just think it alone tastes artificial. But the cookie itself was amazing!! Tip: You need to whip the egg whites into stiff peaks and then whip in the vanilla and sugar. Mix the other ingrediants together and then blend up both together.

Delicious! I've always made macaroons with a recipe using sweetened condensed milk, but during my unplanned cookie making spree today (We in the midwest love being trapped in our homes w/ 3ft of snow outside our doors) I found that I didn't have any s.c.m.! So i tried this recipe, thinking it wouldn't be as chewy and yummy in the center, but I was wrong! Wonderful! I added about 3/4 tsp of almond extract too - a nice touch but BE CAREFUL, that stuff is STRONG! Anyway, a definite hit! I'll pass up the s.c.m. recipe any day... delicious! Thank you so much!

This is a great recipe!! These cookies were super easy and super quick!! I wipped them up in 3o minutes because we were having unexpected guest over for some tea, but we had nothing to go witht the tea! The only thing i did differently was drizzle these with chocolate!! They were delicious... and all gone by the time our guest left!

Fantastic!  After reading the reviews I was sceptical that this recipe was on point but they were so simple I made them anyway.  The cookies were crunchy around the edges and nice and soft in the middle.  Just perfect.  I can see where these would taste like an Almond Joy so next time I make them (and there WILL be a next time) I will add the almond and chocolate.

I have been trying to find the knock-off version of the "two-bite" macaroons found in the stores.  I tried this recipe and added 1 tsp. of corn syrup (which is an ingredient listed on the back of the "two'bite macaroon" package.  I made these for a bake sale and they all stuck (I used waxed paper).  The flavour was so-so but not as intense as I would have liked, even though I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract.  Still looking for the perfect recipe.  p.s.  Does anyone have a trick for not making this sort of recipe stick?

I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract for a little deeper flavor and loved the result.  Very easy and very quick. Didn't turn out sticky at all and had a wonderful light texture.  It made 18 cookies

I followed the recipe exactly, plus added 1/2 tsp almond extract.  They were excellent (and I don't normally care for coconut :-). I used parchment paper so I didn't need to grease the cookie sheet.

I have a lot of friends who can't eat wheat or sugar, so the next time I made them I decided to experiment by replacing the sugar with Splenda, and the flour with Rice flour.  The flavor was good, however, they were too dry, and crumbled a bit when cooled.  However, I'll bet with a little more experimenting (maybe adding another egg white!) these will work as sugar and gluten-free.

I LOVE coconut macaroons and this is my favorite recipe for them ever! I do not ever make such statements lightly. I am glad I read other reviews as I put altered the recipe before baking it: I added 1/2 t. of almond extract and 2 cups of coconut vs the 1 1/3 listed. They came out perfect!

This recipe makes a delicious, light, crispy macaroon.  If you are looking for the dense, sticky/gooey kind, this is not for you!  However we found them just perfect, able to eat a couple without feeling sick to your stomach, as sometimes happens with the heavier/overly sweet ones.  I cut down on the sugar by half as I wanted to dip the bottoms in semi-sweet chocolate, and I also added a little almond extract along with the vanilla. These held their shape PERFECTLY! The only other change I made was to cut the flour in half for the 2nd batch and after (already made 4 batches this week to give away!) as I found 2 tablespoons made it a little too "flour-y".  Here's a tip: if you are using coconut flakes that are a bit on the dry side, let the mix sit for 5-10 minutes before baking, so yummy!

These turned out perfect! I think the instructions miss telling us to whip the egg whites till stiff because that is how I made them and they were perfect.

Amazingly delicious and simple!  DON'T COOK ON WAX PAPER! :) They stuck really bad, what a mistake!  I doubled the recipe (good thing!) but put half the amount of sugar. I added some extra coconut to make them a bit thicker and also did it gluten free substituting rice/tapioca/xatham for the regular flour.  These are wonderful!

This is a good macaroon recipe if you are looking for one.  Follow the instructions just as noted.  If you whip the egg whites you get more of a meringue w/ coconut(really fluffy with coconut flakes). You want more of a coconut look.

Great flavor, but a little extra flour and coconut are necessary to thicken the batter.  Otherwise it spreads out too much during cooking.  Thicken the dough and you get chewy, moist macaroons!

These are amazing! I made them with freshly grated coconut, which made for a very moist and delicate macaroon. I also used turbinado sugar and whole wheat pastry flour instead, which enhanced the golden appearance of the finished product.   Made the exact number of servings listed. Perfect for a quick treat.

I enjoyed these, but I used my food processor, which I found made the mixing much easier, and you absolutely have to have parchment paper lining your cookie sheets for macaroons - ungreased they'll stick and greased and they spread and stick.  Use parchment paper and let them cool and they come off perfectly.

These taste like those cute little two-bite macaroons. So good and very esy to make, the first batch lasted one day in my house so I made up another one today. They will be gone by tomorrow =). Only thing is my dough was super mushy and moist I used 5 tablespoons of flour instead of 2 and a full teaspoon of vanilla rather then the half. Definately will be making these again!

Very chewy and light texture. This was a very easy and simple recipe and had delicious results. I used a little more than what recipe called for when scooping onto cookie sheet as 1 tsp. seemed too small (about 1 tablespoon). Came out the perfect size. Also dipped in milk chocolate, using those Baker's melting containers in the baking aisle. Almost tastes like an Almond Joy, minus the almond and with much better texture!

Perfect coconut macaroons!  Made a batch of these this afternoon, following the recipe exactly.  Our oven is a bit slow, so turned it up a bit and added a few more minutes so that the macaroons would get that beautiful golden brown color.  My husband ate the first one and then shouted "Man, these are GREAT!!", then he polished off the entire batch. They're a hit!!   Thanks, Penny Ann, for sharing this fantastic recipe.

These Macaroons were nice.  I dipped the bottom in dark chocolate which was a nice touch!  Although the macaroons themselves didn't have much flavor, I won't be making these again.  They def need more sugar and perhaps more salt.  But I do have to say that they were very very easy to make!!

I usually do not participate in ratings however I must do so because the macaroons made from this recipe are excellent and yes, I am quite fussy and an accomplished baker.  They are elegant and delicate! Also for individuals who are concerned about heating healthy - the coconut and egg white keep this item in my good books!!!  The recipe is easy enough for a very young person to follow and to make wonderful macaroons each and every time!!!  Congratulations!!!!!!!!

Excellent cookie! Made it just like the recipe except substituted Splenda sugar blend for the sugar. I also lined my baking sheets with parchment, and when they were done cooking, they slid right off the parchment onto the wire rack. This recipe is very forgiving, also - my mind wandered during one of the 9 batches I've made since Christmas, and I forgot to put in half of the egg whites. Result? A cookie that was a little crisper on the edges, and a little less chewy - but still just as flavorful.  My son-in-law who never eats dessert gobbled them down. This recipe is definitely in my keeper file. Friends think they're so hard to make just because they're delicate-looking, but they couldn't be more wrong.

Great macaroons for such a simple recipe! I like how it's just a small batch so you can play around with it if you wish without wasting so much if something went wrong. I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract (in with the egg whites) as another member suggested & they turned out great! I will definitely make these again!

This was a very simple recipe.  Before making it I read the reviews and saw many people made adjustments, I decided to make it first as the recipe says and then adjust from there.  They turned out great, no adjustments needed.  I doubled the batch and it only made about 15 good sized macaroons total.

One word: yummy! And easy to make! The amount of egg whites and coconut aren't exactly right. I think there needs to be less egg white and more coconut (or maybe flour) that I'll have to try next time. I followed the 9 servings and it only made 18 cookies (used a 1 tablespoon to make them) so make sure you double the recipe cause it's definitely worth it!

These are great!  I only got 20 out of this batch so double up!  I grated some dark chocolate on top of them and they looked like they had pepper on them so I really don't recommend this because it looks rediculous.  If you want chocolate on them, drizzle melted chocolate or even a tablespoon of cocoa should do the trick.

An excellent recipe that is both quick and very tasty. I think the "magic" here is in using excellent vanilla. I have Mexican vanilla which has a wonderful flavor of its own. The cookies were wonderful and the size of the recipe great as it didn't leave too many to store.

This is an excellent recipe.  I substituted the sugar with Splenda and they turned out great.  Since it has only 2 T. flour it's realatively lowcarb which is important to us.  They are also great for people with IBS.  2 a day controls the condition...read this in People's Pharmacy column in newspaper and it works.

I added 1/2 t of almond extract, topped the unbaked cookies with a few slices of almond, baked them as directed, spread melted semisweet chocolate on the bottom, and then dipped the bottom of each cookie in chopped almonds. My dad said it was like a Mounds/Almond Joy cookie.  Very pretty cookie!

I am not a big fan of coconuts, but my husband brought a bag of coconut flakes and I had to use it somehow. I stumble across this recipe and thought it would be a good way to use it. I loved it, I copy the recipe exactly and it turned out so good. It's crunchy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. It's too sweet, so it doesn't cover the coconut taste. Thought this was the perfect recipe.

Great! I added a bit more coconut than the recipe asked for and a bit less sugar as I used sweetened coconut. Came out perfectly- crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside!

Yummm!  Texture is perfect and SO easy!   First time I made, they lacked something in flavor, a little bland.   Tried again with a pinch more salt and mixed the vanilla and touch of almond in with the egg whites, was much better.  Take care to grease the cookie sheet very lightly so as to not overbrown the bottom of the cookie and don't overcook them!  18 minutes exactly was a charm for mine.  Chocolate adds the finishing touch that really takes them to the next level.

These turned out really well! The package of coconut I bought had roughly the same recipe, except it was 2 1/3 cups of coconut. I also added some semi-sweet chocolate after it cooled. Delicious.

I love macaroons, but always thought that they were to time consuming to make.  I made some home made granola and had left over coconut, so I decided to try this recipe out.  The cookies came out perfectly and the recipe was simple.  Thanks for sharing it!

These are wonderful coconut macaroons! Easy to make and easy to find ingredients. I only recommend that you double the recipe (at least) because they will disapear fast. Your recipe is scrumptious. Thank you for sharing it.

There were good, but tasted a little too "eggy" for me. Take this with a grain of salt though because this is the first time i've made coconut macaroons- maybe that's how they should tase!

Really good. My diabetic aunt loved them. We added another tbs of flour. OUr first batch tasted good but not very pretty, kind of flat. By adding another tbs, we got a rounder, prettier cookie. Didnt change taste, just appearance. Even though these dont have much sugar, they are sweet enough.

I will give this recipe 5 stars for flavor BUT - have PLENTY and i mean PLENTY of extra coconut on hand if you are making a big batch. I followed the re-calculated recipe to the t and the mixture was so wet that they just melted on the sheet.   The wet mix should just barely make the coconut moist enough to stick together.  My first two tries came out TERRIBLY runny so i added two more bags of coconut to get the remainder of the mix right.  Only then did they come out looking like the photo.

Kids loved these.  I added sliced almonds to the dough before baking.  When the cookies cooled, I drizzled melted chocolate over them.  Tasted like an Almond Joy bar.  Very good.

Great recipe, we made them smaller and dipped some of them half way in melted chocolate. They'd be good with a nut in the middle too.

I loved this recipes, it was really easy to make and they turned out great. I took it to a get together, everyone loved one and asked for the recipe. I also melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and dipped half the macaroons in it after they cooled and put it on wax paper. For sure will make again.

I had adjusted the quantity to 16 servings which would use half of a 350 gram bag of coconut (175 grams).  the batter turned out to be very runny.  I ended up using about another half a cup of sugar 3/4 cup of flour,  half a teaspoon of vanilla and the whole bag of coconut. I just kept adding until it had a spoonable (new word?) consistensy.  They turned out really good,  chewey and sweet,  kids loved it!!

At last a recipe ideal for my diabetic, dairy-allergic, suffering from heart illness mother-in-law. I've just changed sugar for 45gr of fructose.

This is a great recipe!  The macaroons are not too sweet and have a yummy caramel flavour.  I love vanilla so I add in a little extra.

My only criticism is that it only made 11  small cookies. I'll double the batch next time and make sure I coat the aluminum foil with spray.

Delicious and easy to make.  I did hand whip the egg whites with a dash of cream of tartar, sugar and extracts before adding to the dry.  I also substituted a little bit of ground almonds because I didn't have enough coconut.  Yummy!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Wonderful Macaroons.  Made them several times.  To make them gluten free, just substitute corn starch for the flour.  The corn starch ones actually came out better than the flour ones!

Taste is great, texture is off. Like other reviewers I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract. Like I said, very tasty but the texture was more cookie like than macaroon like.

These are the best macaroons I've ever tasted. My boyfriend, who is very picky, loved them and said they were the best macaroons he's ever had too. I used arrowroot powder instead of flour and were still amazing.

I made these for my husband because he loves coconut and we can't stop eating them.  This is a great, easy bake recipe.  I followed a reviewer's tip and baked them each with a maraschino cherry in the middle.  The cherry adds a great flavor to the coconut and a touch elegance to the look of macaroons.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!  One tip I have is that I found that 18-20 mins is a lot so I will probably bake them for 16-17 mins next time.

These macaroons are a family favorite. I make them constantly from Thanksgiving to New Years. I put 1/2 a maraschino cherry on each one before baking. That is how my Grandma always does it. Even she admits this recipe is better than hers.   I've made this recipe ALOT and I find that every batch is a little different. Some dryer, some moister. I think that has more to do with the coconut. Whether or not its fresh, or what brand you are using. If it seems a little moist, just add more coconut and flour.

These are amazing!! I didn't add almond extract as other reviewers did, BUT, I did chop up some almonds and used those. I placed the macaroon balls on the chopped nuts and then put them onto the baking sheet and drizzled them with chocolate. The almond pieces on the bottom added a slight crunch and gave the perfect amount of almond flavor.

I made this exactly as written using sweetened coconut, plus I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  They were excellent.   I baked them on a parchment-lined pan and had no trouble with sticking.  This is going to become one of my stand-bys.

These turned out pretty good - a little too chewy for my tastes, i prefer macaroons a little bit denser.  I did have to cook them for more like 30 minutes before they started to brown.

I followed the recipe exactly and these came out GREAT!  I found that my version of a "rounded teaspoon" (I took my teaspoon measuring spoon and scooped up spoonfuls of the "batter" and dropped those on the cookie sheet) yielded 15 macaroons instead of 9, like the recipe says.  Which is fine!  I think next time I will make my macaroons larger by measuring a "heaping teaspoon" of the mixture for each one.  Thanks for sharing!

It was really good.  Although my package of flaked coconut equaled 2 cups, so I added one more egg and a bit more flour.  Also reduced the sugar a bit and they turned out  nice!  Crispy on the bottom, soft in the middle, and not too sweet.

Mmm delicious! I was a bit nervous because I used tablespoon-full drops for the macaroons and the baking time took a tad longer.  Nonetheless, they came out fragrant and sweet. Definitely going to make again.

I have been looking for a macaroon recipe this good for years!! I dipped them in melted semi-sweet chocolate(with parafin) and pressed a whole almond onto the top!  They were better than a you know what candy bar!! Definately a keeper! Thanks!

I thought these macaroons were spongy. I did not like them at all. I used a different recipe with condensed milk. It was much better. These do not taste like traditional macaroons.

These came out more like a meringue, but were DELISH! I added 1/3 cup more sugar and 1tsp of almond extract. Very simple and so tasty!

The batter was a little too wet to hold together in the dome shape I wanted, but the taste got rave reviews!

These were very good, but not "the best" I've ever had.  I had to cook them a little longer than called for to get them to have a little "brown" on the tips of the coconut.

I made these and a recipe that used sweetened condensed milk.  The others had a much better taste and texture!
