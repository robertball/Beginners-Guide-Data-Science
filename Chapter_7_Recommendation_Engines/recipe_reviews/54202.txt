I have made this many, many times but I half the oil, triple the garlic and lemon and add a little thyme and oregano, and rosemary so moist and tangy with the extra lemon garlic and the smell while grilling amazing. I made this for fatherâ€™s day and it was a big hit this time I added a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper. Really good on lamb chops too. I am giving the 5 ***** to the recipe with the added lemon juice and garlic and extra herbs. As far as I am concerned you can never have too much garlic.

LOVE this recipe!!! I followed many of the previous reviewers advice (especially Cloverdale1's) and these are my final changes:

only 1/2 cup olive oil
juice of 3 medium lemons
2 tablespoons minced garlic 
NO paprika (just b/c I don't have any)
1 teasp. of crushed basil 
1 teasp. of crushed oregano
1/4 teasp. cayenne pepper
1/4 teasp. crushed red pepper
Kept salt, and black pepper the same....

I am not a good planner, and I like easy cooking, so I only marinate about an hour to an hour and 1/2. Then I just put in the the broiler instead of grilling.

As you can tell, I like it spicy. Even in the broiler, this recipe kept the chicken perfectly cooked and MOIST. YUMMY!!!!
My husband and 13 year old LOVED IT, and said they want this one a lot, which is great b/c it's so easy...

Excellent - didn't marinate over night but did all day - still VERY tender and flavorful - I cooked the chicken on my George Forman grill and it turned out great - can't wait to try it BBQ style. Even hubby who isn't a chicken fan liked it.

This was the best grilled chicken recipe I have found!! I do not grill chicken because it comes out too dry.  This recipe has changed that!  Thank you.  I followed others' advice about using 1/2 cup oil and doubling the lemon juice.  I reserved some of the mixture and used it for asparagus.  I left the asparagus in the marinade for an hour and then threw it on the top grate of the grill while the chicken was cooking.  Excellent!

This tasted great and was very easy. The only thing I would do differently, is take the chicken and marinade out of the refrigerator about 45 minutes before putting the chicken on the grill. The marinade "solidifies" in the refrigerator, and I think I would like it to become a liquid before grilling. I served it with Greek Pasta Salad III also on this site. A great easy meal. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great. I ordered chicken the last time I was at my local Greek restaurant and I have to say that this tasted nearly identical, if not better! This one is a keeper.

I prepared and marinated the chicken while I went Christmas shopping then grilled it on my George Foreman grill. Quick, easy and delicious. Wouldn't change a thing. I am adding this to my family's list of favorites right now. We have taken to eating it with feta cheese over greens as a salad. Perfection.

This was OK but nothing special.  I did bake the chicken instead of grilling it though, due to the colder weather.  I thought it was a bit bland while my husband said he tasted the pepper more than the garlic.  A hint, though, is to take the marinated chicken out ahead of time before cooking, as the olive oil solidifies in the frig.

This was fabulous.  A big hit with the family.  Moist and juicy and very flavorful.  I marinated a full 24 hours before grilling.  This will be a regular in my summer grilling rotation!  I served it with a Greek salad using the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing from this site and it too was delish!  Thanks for posting! FORGOT TO ADD:  I took others advice and halved the oil but doubled the lemon and garlic.  Added 1 tsp. oregano.

Absolutely fabulous. Have made this several times and everyone wants the recipe.  Does flare up a bit when you first put on the grill.  Wonderful flavor and so very easy.

Chicken breasts have a tendency to dry out when grilling (at least in my experience), but not this recipe! The olive oil really helps keep it so moist. This has just the right amount of lemon juice, but I did use closer to a tablespoon of garlic. This marinade would be a great vehicle to add whatever herbs you like. Next time I will try adding rosemary!

Did chicken kabobs with this and then put it in a pita with some feta and the Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber sauce and it was delicious.  Great healthy alternative to a gyro.  This one is definitely going into the regular rotation.

9.7.2010-I only marinated the chicken for two hours and it came out delicious!  Can't wait to try it marinading overnight!  I think making the slits in the chicken, allowing the marinade to seep in, helped keep the chicken nice and tender.  Usually our grilled chicken comes out kinda dry, but this time they were perfect and tasted like the chicken from a Greek restaurant.9.16.2017-have been making this for a while, but marinade time last night was 1 hour. Still tender and juicy, but flavors didn't come through. This recipe pairs well with just about anything--potatoes, pilaf, greens, etc.

Delicious!  I used 1/2 c. olive oil, probably 5 T. lemon juice and marinated in pyrex smaller rectangle dish and baked in the same dish at 400 for 20 min.  Nice and moist and delicious!

So far this is the best marinade I have come across. Chicken had a great taste and would still go with pretty much any side dish! Definite Keeper!

This was delicious! I used about 6-7 cloves of garlic and about 1/3 cup of olive oil. I let it marinade for a few hours in the fridge and then grilled the breasts. Served with rice pilaf, tzatziki sauce, and steamed carrots and brocoli. A hit in our house -- will definitely make this again!

My family went crazy for the taste of this chicken. Marinating it for the full 24 hours is essential. However, the olive oil can be adjusted to less, maybe cut it in half and it is just as effective.

Absolutly the best chicken marinade I have ever tried.  I did take the suggestions of other reviewers and increased the lemon and decreased the oil.  I added additional garlic and paprika but to be honest I really don't think you can go wrong with different amounts of seasoning,  The basic recipe is yummy as is.  Thank you so much Michael for posting.  No more bland chicken for me!

This recipe is so good. It is defintely a keeper. I followed some of the other suggestions especially on the olive oil amount. I used half a cup as other suggested and instead added 3 crushed garlic cloves and added oregano. I did not eliminate the paprika since I like the color it gives to food. The taste was perfect and despite I used tenders they came out moist. I cooked them in a cast iron skillet on the range top 5 minutes per side and only put it in the broiler to finish about 3 minutes and that was it. I had dinner done in 20 minutes! By the way, I marinated the tenders for about 4 hours outside the fridge and it tasted very good. The tenders absorbed the marinade very well!

I was experimenting again in the kitchen and I used this recipe as a base for creating an Italian/mediterranean marinade for chicken because I want to serve it with Fettuccini Alfredo for a local VFW Sat. night dinner.  For 4 chicken breasts, I used basil/oregano instead of paprika and only 1/2 tsp of pepper, more garlic.  I exchanged the lemon juice for 1-2 TBl of roasted garlic rice vinegar and 3 TBL of white wine vinegar along with 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of 1 cup.   My husband grilled it on the BBQ.  We all enjoyed it and my husband who does not like chicken kept giving compliments.  I usually have leftovers of chicken and I did this time, but instead of everyone leaving it for mom to eat, my son came home the next day and ate the rest. And they keep saying how good that chicken was!! I will be making it for home and the Sat. night dinner!

This was delicious! This was the most JUICY tasting chicken I have ever tasted. It was equivalent to the chicken at a really nice restaurant. I followed the ingredients list but did use a scant measurement of the black pepper. I did think the marinade amount was excessive, and I dislike wasting any, so I cut it in half and it made the perfect amount. I also wanted to cut the calories to some and I am sure that helped. For convenience I broiled the chicken. With the amount of oil in the chicken marinade just be careful when doing this and know your broiler settings well. I made a chicken sandwich, as I had planned out of it tonight, on a toasted baguette with a slice of lite swiss and tomato. Although, it was actually quite good with just a fork and a knife. TY

I used only about 1/2 cup of olive oil, skipped the paprika, and added one tbsp of dried oregano.  It was fantastic!

i made a version of this using thighs.  i increased the garlic to about 1/2 cup, and only used about a tablespoon of garlic flavor olive oil.  i baked it for an hour and a half @ 375.  i kept it covered for the first 45 minutes, then basted it about every 15 minutes with the cooking juices.  it absolutely melted in your mouth!

We eat a lot of chicken in my family and this is by far the best recipe!  My husband LOVES it and asks me to make it all the time.  I shared the recipe with my mother-in-law and we ate it at Christmas.  The whole family loved it!  There were no leftovers of this kind of chicken.  =)

Great recipe! I used a whole bag of frozen chicken breasts, made the marinade with extra lemon juice and garlic and coarse sea salt, and let it defrost/marinate in the bag, flipping in once in awhile. Grilled it as directed - even my PICKY kids ate it. Leftovers were wonderful on salad next day.

Followed the reviews and added extra garlic and lemon along with thyme, oregano, and rosemary. After marinating the chicken turned out so tender and flavorful. YUM!!!

Very good! The taste was neither too garlicky nor too lemony. I did reduce the olive oil. Half was perfect for four boneless breasts. Other than that, I stayed faithful to the recipe. Since our palates missed the anticipated tart boost from the lemon, it fell just short of perfection in our purview. Be aware that with the slits cut in the breast, cooking time should be reduced accordingly. We grilled over charcoal and the taste was top-notch.

I've made this several times so far. The first time I made it, I only marinated the chicken for one hour and it was good.  The following times, I marinated it over night and it was really tasty.

The chicken tastes like regular chicken.  It didn't taste very well at all. No mean to be rude but it had no flavor ro it.

LOVED the simplicity and taste of this chicken!  I added more garlic (but I always do!) and kept everything else the same.  This is going to be a repeat at our house in the near future!!!  Thanks!!!

This is really a good marinade. I use less oil, slightly more lemon, omit the paprika. I add cilantro and green onions and put it in a blender. Good stuff!

Its a keeper! I have four kids under the age of 10 who can be very picky...I kept quiet and watched them and none of them gave it to the dog under the table, that means they liked it. Great with garlic bread. I did'nt have fresh lemon or fresh garlic. I look forward to it next time with fresh ingredients. Thanks.

Delicious. I cubed the chicken and grilled the breasts as kabobs. Simple ingredients but great flavor. I marinated mine for about 6 hours and that seemed to be plenty of time.

Greek Style Garlic Chicken Breast Haiku: "The reviews are raves, but so many make changes. I made as written." I stayed true to the recipe's ratio of ingredients, along w/ marinated my chicken overnight, but the end result was really just "yawmon" - a lemony yawn. Brightening it w/ herbs would certainly be beneficial, along w/ tinkering w/ the ratio of EVOO to lemon juice, so maybe I'll make it again w/ some alterations.

Not enough salt, lemon, garlic or oomph at all.  If you follow the advice of the 4 and 5 star reviewers and completely change the recipe by adding all sorts of herbs and spices, then yes, you've got a great recipe.

This is as authentic as it gets.  I tweaked it for my taste buds (original recipe is great as-is).  I halved the oil, doubles the lemon, crushed 6 garlic cloves, added 1 tsp of oregano and thyme.  I also didn't cut any slits in the chicken as I think this would let the juices out. I also used canola oil instead of Olive oil as olive oil is not meant for high heat cooking.

I made this for the first time tonight and not only was it so simple to make but it was beyond delicious.  My boyfriend said that it was better than anything he's ever tasted in all of the Greek restaurants he has been to.Thank you for making me look like a culinary genius.

This was wonderful! Made this last night. Made it according to recipe. I reserved a little marinade making sure I had some garlic pieces for basting as I grilled. I was a little concerned of how my fiance would like the chicken, but he spoke of how it reminded him of someone's bbq chicken in town, even though there's no bbq in it. Ha! He really liked and it's healthy, something I could put on his new doctor ordered eating plan. This would be really good with feta cheese too. A definite regular.

To make the marinade penetrate faster, I use a jaccarder to make many small holes in any type of meat and the flavors penetrate faster. Also, if the breast is thicker on one end, just slice half way thru like a book to make everything more even. This recipe is FABULOUS,easy and will give you many left-over options. I did reduce the oil, increase the garlic, lemons and added good oregano. Used a stove top grill and used an instant read to prevent over-cooking. Enjoy!

I used bone-in, skin on chicken breasts that were not sliced as indicated by the recipe. Although I marinated for a full 24 hours, the flavors did not infuse the meat to great extent. I did increase the lemon juice to 2 lemons and about 6 cloves of garlic (1/4 cup, chopped). I will try this recipe again, but next time I will remove the skin for marinating.

This was excellent.  Being Canadian I did change one ingredient.  I used P.C. Roast Chicken Spice. I reduced the oil, as well.  After marinating, I put each piece of chicken into a tin foil envelope. Cooked chicken legs 15 mins. each side, then put them on the grill to finish with some of the marinade.  Wonderful!  My husband said "Just like in the restaurant"
Thanks.

Nice flavor.  Froze the chicken and marinade together, and it defrosted wonderfully.  Served with Classic Greek Salad for a quick, light meal.

I've made this with chicken and turkey, marinated it overnight or for as little as 3 hours and cooked it on the outdoor grill as well as baking and broiling in the oven - it was delicious every time.  I put the chicken and marinade into a zippered freezer bag - easier to work in the marinade and handy to pop into the fridge.

Delicious!  Everyone raved about it.  I did increase garlic and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, thus the 4 rather than 5 stars.  I see no need for the full cup.  Let the marinating chicken come to room temp before grilling so the olive oil won't be so gloppy!  For more even cooking, I cut each breast in half crosswise and pounded them to even thickness (not too thin though).  Sometimes I add some chopped fresh oregano, rosemary or thyme from my garden.
Final comment; DO NOT OVERCOOK!

I made this for a party and the chicken was dry. I thought the marinade would keep it moist. I did marinate overnight. I also followed the most helpful positive review edits, but just didn't turn out how i was expecting. I may make it again and try another method of cooking to keep it from being dry.

I liked the flavor of this, but the high ratio of olive oil to lemon juice caused the grill to flare up, requiring very careful monitoring.  I marinated all day, and the chicken was tender and full of flavor.  Perhaps I will try this in the oven, next time.

very good marinade! I only kept the chicken in the marinade for 20 minutes(had to eat and run!) and it was still so tasty! I didnt measure but I am sure I put in more lemon and garlic, as i love them, no paprika though and for side dishes, I made fresh spinach sauteed with EVOO and garlic and fresh mushrooms with pasta sauteed with EVOO, garlic and Parmesan cheese with basil and oregano, s&p, what a meal! "oh so good";-) Thanks for the chicken recipe!

Delicious! I also used half of the oil and left out the paprika but added basil. I broiled it for about 12 min and it turned out  moist and tender. Thanks for sharing.

This was a winner!  Instead of lemon juice, I used one of my swanky lemon flavored olive oils.  I added fresh thyme to the marinade.  I marinated only 1 hour before cooking and right before placing the chicken in the oven, I added some italian seasoning.  The family loved it!  My husband said, "You're becoming quite the chef".  My daughter said, "Please make this again".  My son said, "Mommy, this is good!  It looks just like the food on TV".  So, I will make this very simple, but fantastic chicken again.

this was great!  I made minor changes: I halved the oil, added a little rosemary and extra lemon, I marinated for only 6 hours, served with feta cheese on top - and I baked in the oven instead of grilling.  so good!  I'm keeping this in the rotation.

Doubled the garlic (love garlic!) and cooked the chicken on my George Forman.  I thought the fresh lemon juice added just enough lemon-flavor, but didn't overpower the garlic at all.  I did add a little oregano and thyme as well.  I bet it's even better on an outdoor grill, I can't wait to try it again.

This was a hit! It was far from dry, if you do it right. I pan seared it and added a little of the marinade to the pan. I made it for a salad which I mixed fresh spinach romaine  lettuce cucumbers vine ripe tomatoes red onions and hard boiled eggs sliced up and a day old ciabatta bread cubed and tossed in olive oil and fresh salt and pepper toasted on a cookie sheet in the oven and it was delicious! My family loved it. I just changed a few things I added 1/2 cup olive oil 2 garlic cloves sliced up and  a drop of vinegar and half of a lemon juice and paprika coarse sea salt and fresh ground peppercorns

A simple, tasty recipe and it does what it says! I usually have difficulty keeping chicken breast filets moist but this worked like a charm, even though I only marinated 30 min! Other modifications: used 5/6 (1/2 + 1/3) tsp fried chicken seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt and no paprika. Also, I cut the chicken breast filets in half since the time to marinate was so short.

I thought that this chicken was very good.  It had a nice light lemony tang but was not overpowering and would probably taste great over a salad. My husband thought that it was just ok.

It tasted okay but very expensive to make (1 cup of olive oil for 4 chicken breast can add up-especially if you use good olive oil like I do)

Made this recipe for a cookout.  It was a big hit.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and cut the olive oil in half and used two lemons.  I also added two tbsp of dried oregano.  Marinated for  8 hrs - not overnight.  It turned out great.  I highly recommend it.

This is my go-to grilled chicken recipe. We double the batch but use half the lemon (I'm fine with the lemon flavor, but my bf thinks it's too tangy full strength). It's simple and easy.

This was only OK. 
I flattened my chicken breast as I always do when grilling to ensure even cooking time. 
There was no way I could bring myself to add the entire cup of olive oil.. I added only 1/4 cup. Along with the zest of the lemon I juiced.. As I never waste that. 
I read some reviews about the chicken being white and hard after marinating.. That's because the oil solidified.. Which means it was too much. 
Something was missing in this.. Not too entirely sure what.. Maybe some oregano?

I've made this for decades  but slightly different.
I only use a about 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil that I drizzle over the chicken after putting the lemon on.
Fresh  ground black pepper and a little salt.
I marinate for 30 minutes.
Sometimes I'll put a little ground turmeric on it change it up.
(I vary on the garlic but usually a bit more)

I didn't have lemon juice so I omitted it.  I added chopped cilantro.  Excellent.  My husband loved it!

Very good base recipe for me. I love seasoning and I used this recipe on bone in chicken. I also shook on my homemade Greek seasoning to add flavor!

Great on the grill and used to top a Greek Salad.  My guests loved it!  Very tender and juicy chicken. Quick sear then, cook slow and turn so sides down burn and it's no longer pink.  

I think without the salad & dressing, it might need a slight kick..maybe a pinch of salt?

Greek Salad:
(lettuce, cucs, red onion, feta cheese, pepperoncini peppers,black olives, tomatoes, Greek dressing)

Delicious!! After reading some reviews I only did 1/2 cup of oil and used 2-3 lemons. Also threw some oregano in there. Let in marinate for about 8 hours and then cooked on the grill. Very moist, lemony chicken :)

Marinade was easy to put together, put everything in a zip lock bag and marinated for about 24 hrs, I used 6 chicken breasts instead of 4 and grilled a little past the time i intended to which I think made them a little dry, otherwise the flavor was great.

I would have followed the recipe exactly but 1 cup of olive oil seemed like a lot to me.  Many other reviewers also suggested reducing the oil to a half cup.  The only other change I made was to use the zest of the lemon that I juiced. I marinated the chicken breast for a few hours and then baked it in the oven.  It smelled great while it was baking.  It got done very quickly. The chicken breast was moist and flavorful. Thanks for an excellent recipe.  It was very good, easy to prepare, nutritious and healthy.

Loved it. Was very tender.  I went by other reviews and decreased the oil, increased garlic and lemon. Also added very little amount of thyme, oregano and rosemary.  Used the electric grill and it was fine.

Great recipe halved the oil and tripled the garlic.  Only had time to marinate for 1 hour and it was still tender. I also cut the Breast into tenderloin like strips to help it cook faster. Didn't have any paprika but was still delicious!

This is definately what restaurant style greek chicken tastes like.  I followed others suggestions (1/2 cup olive oil, more lemon juice, paprika, oregeno, basil) and it was awesome.  Don't overcook though (like I did!)

I throw all of this in the crockpot and is soooooo good.  The chicken gets "shreddy" but over rice-yummy.  Even my pickiest will eat this.  Really good.  I have also put all the spices on this and Foreman Grilled it, also good.

Wow for such a simple ingredient recipe this is packed with flavor.  I used less oil than called for and more garlic.  I cut up my chicken breasts into small chunks so the marinade would penetrate better.  I left it in the frig overnight and cooked it in a skillet the next day.

Love this recipe, reminds me of a kebab recipe that my Mom used to make! I did lessen the amount of olive oil used for the marinade, I didn't feel it that would harm the integrity of the recipe. I served Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad with this to round out the meal (also on this site)...yummy! Next time, I will add oregano to the other seasonings and zest the lemon before juicing it. Thank you Michael for posting this recipe!

This was the star dish at our summer dinner party in the garden. I have prepared three other styles of chicken for grilling but this one won everyone over. Even the "sometimes vegetarian" loved it! I followed the recipe to the dot and will do again and again. Thanks for sharing

My family tried this recipe last night and my 9 year old and her two friends could not get enough! They were angry at her sister because she wanted to eat chicken too! They wanted to eat her share. Next time I will definitely double the recipe! I made the recipe without change except to decrease the olive oil and that was because I ran out. Definitely will make again. And so will my daughters friends mother!

I forgot to add the olive oil, and it still turned out delicious. Added oregano, chili powder and upped the garlic a little, and also added a little soy sauce. My ten year old sister raved about this. Thanks for sharing this.

I have to admit - with such a simple recipe I didn't understand the rave reviews.  I mean it's just a lightly seasoned chicken breast.  Then I grilled these with natural charcoal and hickory chips and they were fantastic.   Make these and you won't be sorry.

We used a suggestion on the site and tripled the lemons and garlic. We also marinated the chicken for two nights instead of one. One of the best!

Loved this! I did it on pork kebobs and I let it go overnight. I thought the flavor was great. It grills just beautifully. Can't wait to actually try it on chicken. Served with AR "Orzo and Tomato Salad with Feta Cheese." Yum!

It was tender chicken, but a little one dimensional in flavor, all I could taste was garlic.  I get that it is called Garlic Chicken, but I didn't really taste the Greek part of it.  There are other marinades that are more to my liking for a Greek flavor, but if I want garlic chicken I would use this marinade.

We ate this recipe last night with pasta sea shells on the side and garlic bread.  It was very yummy.  Warning to anyone that is grilling this inside the house instead of out on a barbque grill, open EVERY SINGLE WINDOW IN THE HOUSE because it's going to look like a fire got started in the house somewhere.  The hot grill and the olive made a lot of smoke but it was soooooo worth it.  LOVE IT!

This had great flavor.  I think the amount of olive oil was a bit excessive so next time I will cut back on it.  Otherwise a good recipe.

I made this with a Greek themed meal.  I really liked the flavor as did all of my guests.  I was unable to marinate overnight but the flavor was still very good.  I even had a request for a copy of the recipe!!

Both my husband and I loved this chicken and both give it 5 stars.  That in itself is unusual so you can be very proud.  I did add cayenne and crushed red pepper because we both love spicy.  I baked it in the oven with new red (pre boiled)potatos marinated with the chicken.  I also didn't marinate overnight, just a few hours and it was still great!  Thanks for posting this recipe

I decreased the oil and added more lemon juice, as other reviewers suggested.  I added thyme and basil for more flavor.  I marinated it overnight, so it had plenty of time to flavor the chicken.  Still, it was just rather bland.  I don't love it--but it's ok.  Nothing to write home about.

Hubby had grill going for salmon so I decided to put on a couple of chicken breasts.  Since he was using charcoal I only had about 45 minutes for the chicken to absorb the marinate.  Can't rate a 5 cause I didn't let it sit overnight but it DID have a nice flavor even after only marinating a short time.

This chicken was fantastic! The ingredients worked very well with each other to create an extremely flavorful and tender chicken. Be careful of the oil, though. Flames shot sky high when I initially put on the grill becaue of all the oil that had gotten into the chicken from the slits I cut.

This is super easy and tastes great!  I love the tang of the lemon juice on the chicken.  I followed previous advice to add a bit of thyme...and I threw in a bunch more garlic because we love spicier food.  It was very juicy and had lots of flavor.  Will totally make this again.  Grilled it outside in 15 degree winter, too!

I used the changes another person suggested with 3 times the garlic and lemon and 1/2 of the oil.  I only marinated for 45 minutes and basted the chicken and some yellow squash with the marinade .  Wonderful!  My 3-year-old son is extremely picky and he was shoving this chicken into his mouth.  This is a boy who will only eat a few bites at the most and he ate more than half a piece of chicken.  Thank you for a great new recipe!!

Very nice. I should have read the reviews, but I did cut the oil to 3/4 cup of garlic oil. I only had four hours to marinade but the chicken was moist cooked in cast iron skillet on stove. Next time I will use 1/2 cup oil, increase lemon and garlic and add herbs.

I've been using this marinade for quite sometime for boneless chicken breasts.  I add a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and dried oregano for a little extra flavor.  I have found that I can cut WAY down on the amount of olive oil and adjust the lemon juice based on the amount of olive oil used.  I also don't feel that the chicken needs to marinate over night.  I generally give it anywhere from 30 mins to a couple of hours depending on the day and how much time I have.  The result is always a very flavorful, moist chicken!   If there are any leftovers, its great cut up and added to a nice green, greek salad!

For 2 large chicken breasts I added a heaped tsp of dried oregano and also of dried basil, 1/2 tsp of hot paprika, juice of 1 lemon, 2 large cloves of fresh garlic crushed, minimised the amount of olive oil (made sure there was enough liquid to make a marinade!) added salt and pepper. Tasted great.

Added fresh herbs.  Grilled sweet potatoe and onions slices too.  I also only used 1/2 cup olive oil and more lemon and garlic.  
Next time I would also do 8 min. per side.

So delicious! I didn't change the recipe much other than decreasing the oil and increasing the garlic. I marinated it for about a half hour, but I only had tenders so it was long enough. I ate much more chicken than my boyfriend did and I regret nothing; I plan on making this again.

Amazing chicken!!! We gobbled it up before even putting it on the salad we had made for it. We let it marinade an extra day because dinner plans changed. I'm not sure if that bumped up the flavor, but I can't say enough good things about how it turned out for us.

We very much enjoyed this recipe due to the flavor and simplicity.  I did follow the suggestion of some fellow reviewers by halving the oil and adding lemon and herbs.  I grilled the chicken with fresh rosemary sprigs on top.  We were hoping for more lemon flavor to come through.  I am certainly going to try this again and perhaps tinker a little more with the specs.  In the end the whole family loved this dish, and this will easily be a five star dish with some very minor adjustments.

Yummy yummy in my tummy!! Oh my goodness this chicken is so moist and tender! I hate cooking chicken because it always comes out dry and I'm mad at myself for not finding this recipe earlier. I followed suggestions from other reviewers about cutting half the olive oil and doubling up on the lemon juice and garlic. I had an Italian spice blend on hand so I sprinkled some of that in, marinaded for 2 hours, popped it in the oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees and WOW was it delicious! DH agrees that we're definitely making chicken more often now thanks to this recipe!

This recipe received rave reviews from my family! It just so happened they came to the table and said, "Chicken again", with that tired look in their eyes that seemed to say, something else please.   But then they took a bite. Flavorful, juicy, everyone loved it!  I took advice from other reviewers and used 1/2 cup olive oil, everything else was as is in the original recipe. I marinated overnight. It was truly easy, delicious and requested that I make again. I served it with noodle al fredo from allrecipes, as a side, and they went together nicely. Easy weeknight meal that everyone enjoyed.

Used triple garlic, less oil, and the other suggestions and left out the lemon juice, since we don't care for that. Pounded the chicken to 3/4 inch and cooked about 7-8 minutes a side.  My wife and I really liked it and how juicy it turned out.

Loved it! I cut the oil to 3/4c and replaced the pepper and paprika with greek seasoning. I didn't have access to a grill so I propped up the skewers over a lined pan in the oven and they came out super juicy. Huge hit, Thank you!!

This is good stuff. I kid you not when I say my husband and I have made this every week for the past 8 weeks. No joke. I normally eyeball the ingredients and let it marinate overnight. Then my husband cooks it out on the grill. We've used drumsticks, boneless skinless chicken thighs and breasts. We just had our first child and this recipe has been a lifesaver! It's easy enough to make that we cook a huge batch and eat it throughout the week. Works with everything - salads, rice, veggies, you name it. We'll continue making it for weeks to come!

Very good basic recipe. My changes: I used boneless thighs and marinated about 3 hours. I also added oregano, thyme and a delicious rosemary salt I had on hand. I made this a full meal by throwing together angel hair pasta and broccoli into a quick "sauce" of sauteed garlic in olive oil with wine, kalamata olives, oregano and lemon juice. Chop up the chicken and toss with the pasta and sauce - then add about a 1/4 c of feta cheese for the crowning touch. So yummy!

Optional:  
1)  Top each breast with room temperature feta before serving. 2)  Slice garlic cloves the long way. Place in the slits in the meat.
3)  Cook in a slow cooker. Tastes great.

I only used 1/2 cup of Evoo,  juiced 2 lemons and increased the garlic to 3 cloves( I should have used 4). The chicken marinated for 9 hours and I grilled them on the BBQ. Very tasty and juicy. 
Yes, I will make them again.

WOW! This is the best grilled chicken I've ever eaten. I've tried a lot of recipes for different marinades from this app, but this one is the best ever. I didn't change a thing about it and I'll definitely be making it again! Thanks for a great recipe!

A definite keeper. I reduced oil to 1/2 C, used 2 lemons and added 1 tsp each of dried basil and oregano. All other seasonings per the recipe. I used 2.5 lbs of chicken thighs and it was the perfect amount of sauce. Only had time to marinate an hour and it was fabulous. Can't wait to try again and give it longer to soak in the flavors.

I loved the flavour in this chicken, but did anyone else have an out of control fire on their grill when they tried to cook them? It almost burnt down my house when i put these on the grill. I ended up baking the chicken that didn't get destroyed. The flavour was pretty good, i will make again but next time i will just bake the whole batch.

I am giving this 4 stars, mostly because the meat came out tender. Used 1/2 the oil and doubled the lemon. Added fresh herbs, but still would like more flavor. I left it in the marinade just short of a day.

yummy! Added a lot of extra lemon and garlic, but it was really a success! I've taken a relatively new interest to cooking, so it felt good to make something that came out so delicious on one of my first attempts.

I followed several other reviewers suggestions and halved the oil. It came out moist and delicious.  I will be using this recipe again and again.  It would be delicious sliced on top of a salad.

This recipe was fantastic! I allowed it to marinate for an extra 24 hours and the chicken turned out juicy and tender. I found that substituting garlic salt for garlic cloves works just as well!

My husband is a very picky eater, and he LOVED this recipe!  I like to add a little bit more paprika to the recipe for more flavor, but now I make it up and keep a bottle of it in my fridge to have handy for the next BBQ!

This was horribly bland for us. I have since found other Greek chicken recipes on this site I will try. We ended up having to use dipping sauce for the chicken, which didn't fit in with my Greek theme at all.
This has so many great reviews however, that I guess it just wasn't our cup of tea!

Used Lizabeth's recommendations. I decreased the oil to 1/2 cup but next time, will decrease more to at least 1/4 or even 1/8 cup. Used 3 TBS lemon juice since I didn't have lemons on hand. Used 1 tsp. of oregano and basil and 1/4 tsp. of cayenne and red/black pepper mix but that combination takes away from the original "Greek" recipe. Love the changes but it is what it is...not really Greek. I served the leftover chicken strips over a salad. Very tasty! Didn't understand the concept of "cutting" the chicken prior to marination but either way, the chicken breasts were so tasty and WILL MAKE AGAIN!!!  A definite keeper!

This recipe was just OK with me.  The marinade smelled wonderful so I really had my hopes up.  It still came out kind of bland to me...and I let it marinade over 24hrs!  I gave it 3 stars because my 3 year old loved it.

I have way too many chicken recipes so I used this marinade on pork chops instead.  It worked perfectly!  I marinated the chops overnight, then grilled on the BBQ.  My dinner guests loved it, including my picky 2-year-old who ate an entire piece himself.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I only used half the oil, but I still had more than enough marinade for the chicken plus a large dish of vegtables. The flavor really went all through the meat and vegtables, but, as there was no measurement for the juice yeild, the end result was a bit lemony.

Okay, you had me at "garlic"! Fantastic chicken! I marinated this overnight, following directions exactly. Next time I will reduce the salt but I'm not big on salty foods. I seared the chicken breast and then finished by baking them (covered) and they were yummy! Thanks Michael!

Excellent. I added some Greek seasoning to the marinade as well. Serves it sliced gyros style-was great!

Really loved this.  I used chicken thighs as that's what was handy but took the skin off.  Olive oil is more expensive but I don't think regular oil would be nearly as tasty.  Delicious.

I personally loved this, my husband would have given it a 2 star, but that's because it didn't have cheese ;-).  I thought it was extremely good, and will make it again.
