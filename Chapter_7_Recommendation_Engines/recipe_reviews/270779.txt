I made this not believing that this would actually be good. Weâ€™ll boy was I wrong. The aroma of hot bananas and water filled my house and forced all inhabitants to succumb to it. 4.5/5, could have used some salt.

I like to add a little apple cores to really bring out the banana peel flavor. It makes me feel extra frisky... ;-) Tastes like home.

GAM GAM has the best hot banana water around. I recommend eating the banana water with jumbo shrimp it really complements the texture.

I came across this recipe after a terrible week full of stress, exhaustion, and sleep deprivation. Plans began to change, even an event I was looking forward to all year was cancelled.

I made this recipe to take my things off things and, let me tell you, it's exactly what I needed to take my mind off things. All I could think about was the flavor and texture of what my taste buds were experiencing. I'm glad I was able to take my mind off of things, now I'm no longer stressing about the little things in life!! Thank you Gam Gam for your amazing Hot Banana Water!! 10/10 would drink again :)

Gam gam should be proud. This recipient brought a tear to my singular eye. However I recommend using 16 banana peels instead of 2 it adds quite the flavor to the boiling banana water.
