Tried fixing quinoa for the  first time. This recipe is really easy. I reduced the bacon to only 1/4 cup then added 1/4 c.  mirin or white wine. Salt and pepper to taste.  I skipped  the cilantro. Will be fixing this again. thanks for sharing.

Skipped the cilantro and this was still an amazing side. Red quinoa worked wonderfully. I doubled the recipe, hoping for leftovers. Nope.

I tweaked it a bit based on some stuff that I needed to use (green bell pepper, chicken breasts) and I loved it! Great flavor, reasonably healthy.  I used a thick cut bacon that had very little fat on it, so the onion and peppers generated most of the cooking moisture as opposed to bacon fat.  I think I will make this again and perhaps tweak some more ingredients (possibly garlic, or cumin...possibilities are endless!).

This was a hit, although I modified it quite a bit. Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 lb. bacon, sauteed it by itself, and removed it to drain. I added a half cup of white wine to the drippings, and cooked the onions while the wine reduced, adding the spinach when it was almost dry. After adding the bacon, onion, and spinach mix into the quinoa, I added about a tsp of lemon juice and a tsp of cumin for flavor. Did not use cilantro, though I would if I had it. In the future, I'll use even less bacon and chop it into smaller pieces, and use low sodium chicken broth.  Will definitely make again!

wonderful and easy.  I would suggest cooking the onion separately from the bacon so the bacon can crisp up better.

I liked it but I think it was a bit too salty and meaty.  I used 12 oz of turkey bacon and parsley instead of cilantro.  So I think I'll cut the meat and add more quinoa.  I ate it for lunch as a main dish rather than as a side.

Delicious! I added a some parmesan and some mozzarella and it turned out wonderful.  My husband and I are going grain-free, so this recipe is a perfect weeknight dinner.
Thanks!

I made this with quinoa and brown rice. Added cheese on top. I made it in a 9" skillet and almost ate the whole thing!  It was delish!!!

I wanted a recipe to use up some vegetables but was quick, hot and nutritious meal for one, so I made a half-size of this recipe, cut back on the bacon, used a 2 to 1 ration of liquid (water and chicken bouillon) to quinoa, added two chopped mushrooms to the bacon and onion, added two small chopped tomatoes (with salt and pepper) after the bacon, onion and mushrooms had cooked - cooked the tomatoes for 2 to 3 minutes - then added the spinach to the pan to cook for 2 minutes. Then I added the quinoa and cilantro. Very tasty and satisfying.

I made this to the letter except for the cilantro. Here is what I did:  I added juice of two lemons to the chicken broth for the quinoa; that added a nice citrus flavor that complemented the spinach. Most of all, I recommend cooking the bacon separately until it is crisp, and then cook the onions. I cooked the two together (bacon and onions) for at least double the time suggested and the bacon never firmed up or crisped at all. It was soft and chewy which was disconcerting.  The flavors mixed together well, especially the lemon. Lastly, we added shredded cheese to the top, but Parmesan would have been better than the cheddar mozzarella mix we used. This was our main meal, not a side.

A bit salty. I'm guessing it's from the bullion and NOT the recipe. I baked my bacon then used the drippings to cook the onion.  I added garlic also as suggested by another reviewer. Yum!

Very tasty. I just need to make sure I watch how much bacon grease is in the pan as it made the meal very greasy.

Next time I will use only 1/2# of the bacon and significantly more spinach.  It could be helpful to fully cook the bacon separately (until it is starting to get crispy), then saute the onion.  I thought it tasted good, but others thought it could use more flavor; some garlic, or even red-pepper flakes, would be a good addition.

Very very good!  Didn't use cilantro, and I would definitely cook the bacon first, then the onion.  Many small pieces were a little soggy.

So delicious! I added a few other things: cumin, garlic, a dash of lemon pepper and topped the dish with avocado. Very simple recipe!

We used maple bacon, and half the amount. We also drizzled a little maple syrup over it and it was wonderful! Bacon took a little longer to cook than expected, but that's okay :) Would recommend.
