I came up with a recipe almost identical to this one about two weeks before I saw it. So I prepared this recipe to see how it stacked up against mine. It's very tasty, I like it. Try throwing in a can of no-beans chili and make it taste like a CHILI corn dog. Even better.

This is a dish my whole family loves - including my 2-year old son and meat-eating husband. I don't typically have green onions on hand, so I substitute yellow or white onions (whatever I have)and it tastes yummy anyway. I always leave out the sage because we don't care for the flavor. You could use regular hotdogs, as they are less expensive, but the veggie dogs are healthier. I suggest skipping the step where you reserve part of the hotdog mixture for topping.The topping ends up sinking into the cornbread mix anyway so it really isn't necessary.

Good recipe. I left out the celery and onion to make mine REALLY kid friendly (if making for grown-ups I'd definitely leave it in), and instead I added celery salt* and onion powder. Used a box of Jiffy corn bread mix and turkey hot dogs (watch the celery salt if you use regular hot dogs - might make it too salty) I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan for 20 mins - any longer would've been too much (next time I'll bake for 18mins). Be careful of the timing, especially if you omit the onion and celery, as they add moisture. I DID use the sage in this. I think that if you use light or vegetarian franks in this, it is a good idea to kick up the cornbread. If you use regular hot dogs, you may not need the sage...it's a matter of personal cornbread preference, I guess (I'm from the south and I like seasoned cornbread) Thanks for the recipe.

I was very skeptical about this.  However, it turned out very good.  My husband said "ew, gross" when I told him what we were having, but when he ate it, he said it was surprisingly good.   I only used 4 green onions and 2 stalks of celery.  Next time, I'd probably use the recommened amounts, as what I chopped was about 1/2 what was called for.  I'd make it again.  It makes me feel a little less guilty to serve to my family instead of plain old corn dogs.

This was fun and yummy! I like to make casseroles in the fall and winter and this is a fun change of pace - a little taste of summer when it is cold outside.  I made a low-fat version and it turned out just great (low-fat margarine, egg substitute, low-fat hot dogs and cheese). I plan to take this to a casual pot-luck dinner soon.  Thanks!

I used turkey hot dogs and left out the celery.  I also used half of a yellow onion, instead of the green onions.  My family gobbled this up! It was great!!  I made a half recipe in an 8-inch square pan, since there are only three of us. My two-year old son, thought this was great!  Thank you for sharing this recipe. YUMMY!

I followed other raters' advice and added another 10 minutes baking time--that was a mistake!  But besides the darkened edges and cheese on top, the inside was delicious!  I omitted the celery, onion, and sage.  I added a can of green chilies(like others did), and I also added a can of whole kernel corn.  This was wonderful and I am sure it'll turn out great next time!

I NEVER give one star ratings.  I really try to find something good about a dish. I liked the idea behind this dish, but it did not taste like a corn dog at all.  AND none of kids (all of whom are corn dog lovers) would even begin to eat this.  I obviously will not be making this again.

This was good...tasted more like cornbread with hotdogs in it than a real corndog. I skipped the sage and the celery...my husband really liked it, will probably make again when we have leftover hotdogs! Thanks!

This was a big hit with my very meat eater guy friends.  It was fun to make and even more fun to eat.  Be sure to serve something very light, if anything, with it, as it's very heavy.  But so yummy!  Thanks!

the main thing I would change is that the hodogs would be better sliced thinly or died up so that it was more even throughout.  Othrewise very good and everyone ate it up!

this is a great tasting casserole! not big on hot dogs myself but I/we REALLY liked this one; and SO simple. many substitutions can be made if needed for lack of ingredients (stick with the corn bread mix though)or if just a twist is desired.  We used pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar for an extra kick and it was fabulous. thanks :o)

I followed the recipe, including the celery & sage but used regular meat hot-dogs.  It really DID taste just like a corn dog.  The next day when reheating individual servings, I just sprinkled a little bit of water on top before popping into the microwave.

This was ridiculously easy and quick! I did the recipe exactly as it called for and we LOVED it. I love the sage in it, because it is very similar to cornbread stuffing at Thanksgiving. The kids loved it, even hubby who is not fond of anything vegetarian. Thanks for sharing.

I woke up Friday not feeling too great & wanted to make something that would last untill Sunday dinner. I found this SUPER recipe. The name sounded intriguing, but my boyfriend was willing to try it. It was fabulous!!! We couldn't believe how much it tasted like a real corn dog! I only put a dash of sage in, added more cheese, and scaled the recipe down to 6. When I feel better I plan on throwing a Fair themed dinner party featuring this casserole! Oh yeah, an extra 10 minutes did help!

We had this for lunch and it's pretty tasty.  I left out the celery and sage because I've never eaten a corn dog that had either of those ingredients in it.  I halved the recipe and baked in an 8 x 8 pan.  My casserole had hot dogs poking out and I kind of expected it to look like cornbread but with hot dogs inside.  If I were to make this again, I'd dice the hot dogs instead of slicing in such large pieces.

I often have a heck of a time coming up with casserole dishes for my vegetarian fiance.  This did the trick!  After spending a ridiculous amount on morningstar farms veggie corn dogs, this is an easy and very tasty dish.  I omitted the sage, as that sounded way too much like cornbread stuffing to me, and added two small cans of diced green chilis.  I also used Yves' "Good Dog" -- which tastes an amazing amount like traditional corn dogs and browned up well, not rubbery. My fiance has insisted this be added to the recipe book :)  Thanks Kim!

Have made this many times, and my non-veggie husband and I really enjoy it.  I don't like onions, so I add a can of diced green chiles instead (for 1/2 recipe).  This gives it some kick.  Usually have to add at least 10 min cooking time for center to cook through.

Very dry, dense & overall not good at all. Reduced the amount of sage and it was still overpowering. Even my very not picky fiance hated it.

Great recipe! I have used beef hot dogs or turkey dogs and this turned out great. I didn't use the sage or green onions but added a little onion salt and some precut frozen onions. I also cut out the celery because I don't like the taste but added a can of green chilis. It gave the casserole a nice kick and both my fiance and 20 month old loved it. It also tastes good with a little Franks hot sauce on top. Oh, and I did use more cheese than in the recipe but didn't put any on top until the last five minutes. And I only needed to cook mine about 20 minutes so I would watch it really closely after about 18 minutes.

Very easy to make, and the kids loved it.  But, I think the prep time is longer than 10 minutes -- closer to between 15 and 20, depending on how fast you chop.  I mixed it all up the  night before, though, so when I got home from work, all I had to do was pop it in the oven.

This way pretty good.  I liked the fact that it was extremely quick & easy.  Didn't get rave reviews from the family, but didn't get any complaints either :-)

My whole family (even the PICKY 10-year-old) Loved this recipe!  What a fun twist on the classic corn dog - and SO easy to make.  Will definitely add to our regular menu.  Thank You!  :^P

This is delicious.  Everyone who tried it said it was great.  Except the recipe says it makes 12 servings and if eaten as a main dish it really only serves maybe 6 people.

This was very good!  I didn't add the sage, and I used Healthy Choice hot dogs instead of vegetarian, but we really liked this.  My 7 year old daughter who can be picky with her food, ate 2 servings of this!

I am only giving this 3 starts because I made a lot of changes to the recipe but it turned out really good. First, I omitted the celery and sage. My grocery store carries a mix of frozen onions red and yellow peppers. I sautéed that in a cast iron skillet. Then added a few chopped cherry tomatoes. Removed from the skillet then added the chopped hot dogs to the skillet and browned them. 1 1/2 cups of milk was way more than the 2 packages of corn bread mix called for so I followed the amount on the package. I took the suggestion of another  reviewer and added a can of creamed corn. Then I cooked it in the hot cast iron skillet. Yum

My boyfriend and I really liked this recipe! I substituted red and green bell peppers for the celery and onions (A matter of personal taste) and all beef hot dogs for the veggie dogs and it was a huge hit.

My speedy and simplified version was really good. No saute at all, just cut up Nathans hot dogs right out of the pkg, substitute onion powder for sliced onion.  So all I really did was beat 2 eags, blk pepper and Jiffy corn bread mix (I did add the milk as directed on Jiffy mix), stir in hot dogs, cheese, and bake! 13yo son loves this served with Busch's vegetarian baked beans.  Will try vegan version for my vegan daughter next.

My kids love this.  Sometimes we use smoke sausage instead of hotdogs, and occasionally we add leftover corn. I usally make this when I have leftover homemade hot dog chili to use up.  Tasted great with the chili on top.

I work in a special ed class room of middle school students and they choose this recipe to make for a meal...they removed the celery, green onions, sage & pepper but added a can of whole corn and it was WONDERFUL. While they were making it I wasn't sure I would want to try any but I did and it was great!!!! Can't wait to make it for my family.

The family did enjoy this recipe. It was very easy to make, and although my 7 year old usually says "eew" to any food with "green bits" in it, I did leave in the celery and green onions. I found that it came out nice and moist and wonder if it would be too dry if I left those out..? Also, since there are only 3 of us, I cut the recipe in half and it still turned out fine. One thing I may change for next time: Instead of putting the remaining cheese on top at the start of baking, I may wait until about the last 10 or 15 mins as the cheese did get quite brown on top. Overall, it was a crown pleaser!

Wow! We tried this as a joke and it's going into the recipe box. We used real hotdogs. Just make sure you don't overmix the cornbread and watch your time when you're baking it.

This turned out great! I did modify a few things though: Instead of green onion I used white and sauteed it with the celery (I reduced celery to 1.5 cups) I cut the hot dogs smaller as well as adding about a tablespoon of sugar while they were sauteeing which allowed a really nice caramelization as a result! In the "wet mix" (milk, eggs, etc.) I increased the milk to 1 2/3 (since so many comments said it was dry) I only used 1 tblspoon of sage and added some garlic powder and salt ..the only thing I will add/change when I make this again is to increase the topping of cheese to one cup! It was great!

3.5 stars. Relatively easy recipe done in 30-45 minutes. I personally think it needs some salt. I would advise cutting the hot dog into smaller pieces like mentioned in the recipe. I thought I would like it with bigger pieces but will cut them smaller next time. The big pieces seemed a little rubbery after baking. Ketchup on the side makes it just like a corn dog at the fair. Yummy!

This was great.  A corndog without the stick.  I used low-fat hotdogs and egg beaters, as it was what I had on hand. I left out the celery...personal taste. It came out great.  I was worried about it being dry, but it was moist and delicious. I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the post.

We were not crazy about this casserole. We love corn dogs around here - so it sounded good. But, we thought it was super dry and nothing really special. I ended up squirting mustard all over it to help the flavor. My kids didn't even care for it. Sorry!

I thought this was really good.  My husband liked it too, just not as much as I did.  However, I didn't have cheddar cheese on hand so I substituted gouda.  It was still good but cheddar would have been much better.  It's not gourmet so don't serve it a dinner party! But it's a great weeknight meal that kids will love.  It's fun to eat.  I felt like a kid at a carnival.

For a vegetarian dish, this was really not bad...I would use real hot dogs next time.  My daughter was going through a vegetarian phase and this actually worked for her.  I would give it a four star,but I just can't get over the vegetarian hot dog taste.  Other than that, it was a pretty good kid friendly recipe.

I've looked for and tried to make my own corn dogs at home before. Not very good results. This is quick and tasty. Drizzeled with ketchup and mustard, liked by all. The only thing missing was the crunch. Great addition to my recipes..

Easy to make, but it did NOT "taste just like a corn dog". It tasted like corn bread with hot dogs and cheese. Just say NO to reheating too! The servings are a little on the small size. I think it makes closer to 8-9 servings. Needless to say, I made the full recipe and it was more than enough for my family of 4.

My daughter really liked this.  We used Morningstar Farms veggie hotdogs, which is less weight than called for, but it works fine.  I only had one box of cornbread mix, so I mixed up my grandmother's cornbread recipe (dry ingredients only) and used that in place of the boxed mixes and it worked out great.  My daughter dipped it in ketchup like she would a regular corndog and declard it a "keeper."

My husband and I really enjoy this recipe. I don't use the celery or the sage and it still turns out great! I highly recommend this recipe.

I prepared this using veggie hot dogs, vidalia onion, and pepper. It was pretty good. I thought my 2 year old would love it, but she only ate half of what I gave her. My husband and I enjoyed it more!

Very good recipe.  The kids loved it.  I replaced the green onions with shallots and only used about a half a cup.  I was afraid mine would pull the old "There is green stuff in there. I am not going to eat it." like someone elses children did.

This is a good spin on plain ol' hot dogs.  The only bad review came from the 13 y.o., but to be fair, it was one of those 'I hate everything' days.  I'll make this again.

This is an easy and quick recipe. Definitely tastes just like a traditional corndog too! I omitted the celery and added yellow onions to the green, with some celery salt instead. Tasted fine. Also used beef hot dogs. If using, it's easier to put the ketchup and mustard over the top, as opposed to trying to dip. This is a keeper!!

This was pretty good, 3 year old didn't like it b/c of the "green stuff" in it.  Left out the sage because I just don't like it, next time I'll leave out the green stuff, too.

I thought this was kind of bland, but for my parents i threw on a lot of cheese and they actually liked it. I also thought it was a little heavy on the sage.  I think I would only use 1 tsp next time (I didn't plan on a next time, but my parents said yes, there will be a next time for me to  make this for them, so they liked it).  I don't think it tastes just like a corn dog, but that could just be me.  Try this, it all really depends on your own tatses.

Very easy to prepare. I wasn't happy with the sage. I also added a Sweet Maya onion instead of green onions. All things considered, very tasty and kid friendly!

This does taste just like a corn dog.  
Frying the hot dogs(I used regular beef
hot dogs) gives them a smoky flavor.
Interesting!!

Made this last night with some semi-homemade chili beans & green salad on the side. It was a big hit with my husband and daughter. Will make it again. Went by the recipe, except I didn't have sage and used just a very small amount of poultry seasoning. I love mustard on my corn dog, so I used some mustard to dip my bites in before I ate them. Oops, forgot...used 1/4 pound hotdogs from Costco to make it, they are very good dogs.

I had high hopes, but it was pretty dry.  Loved the concept - maybe I'll play with it a bit to make it a little less dry and granular.  The celery and green onions really added a great flavor!  A work in progress

I will make this again bc it was pretty easy and fun for my girls to chop the veggies and hotdogs.  However, next time I will not put the sage in there. I think that made it taste a bit like stuffing and I'm not a huge fan of that. Next time I think I will add some cumin or cardamom.

It was very dry and needed more flavor.  I did add a little more milk as some suggested.  We dipped each bite in a little mustard and catsup, which helped a bit.

This was delicious! I used regular hotdogs because I had a bunch on hand. I cut the celery, onion and hot dogs using the food processor and omitted the sage since I didn't have any. I followed another persons suggestion and didn't reserve any of the hotdog mixture for the topping. I just mixed everything together and then topped it with a little extra cheese. This got rave reviews from my husband and my son. I am thinking the next time I have to bring a potluck dish, this will be it since it is pretty simple to make.

This tasted super good, but I put it in the wrong-sized dish so it cooked very unevenly. As result, I had to have it with ketchup, which tasted good with it. For some reason it was reminiscent of thanksgiving stuffing.

Just finished eating this yummy meal! I would recommend this to families of insanely picky kids.  My 8 yo will not eat a vegetable even if video game and/or tv time is riding on it. But he ate this with gusto. 
I made some minor changes for our families preferences. Here goes; I subbed a grated summer squash and a grated zucchini for the celery. Celery has a unique flavor and texture that my live-in food critic would've discovered immediately.
I also only made 6 servings. That's it! This was fantastic and I plan on making it again. Only took about 45 min from prep to serve.

Great recipe, very delicious and I love that it calls for veggie dogs because I'm always on the hunt for good vegetarian meals! I halfed the recipe, substituted white onions for the celery and added a little garlic powder....it turned out very tasty! Thanks for posting this yummy dish =)

My family loved this. Only change is to add garlic. We love garlic and it just put this over the top. Nice recipe will make again and again... Thank you.

This one REALLY surprised us.  We made it lactose free using soy milk and daiya cheese substitute.  Only had a cup of green onion, but work out fine. My husband wants me to make this one for the next church carry in.

I could see the potential in this but I think it really depends on your cornbread mix. I used Bob's Red Mill stone ground cornbread mix and it didn't turn out as well as I would have liked. I baked it for 15 minutes and then added a can of vegetarian chili to the top and baked for an additional 15. I think if I had just used Jiffy (Bob's Red Mill was thick and heavy) it would have been light. I will try this again but just a word to all: the simpler the cornbread mix the better!

I'm not real crazy about cornbread so I substituted a Jiffy box of yellow cake mix (same size as the cornbread mix). You get the same flavor of the cornbread without as much of the gritty taste.

This recipe was delicious and easy - a great combination.  I used turkey dogs instead of veggie dogs.  I have made it twice this year, which is a big compliment from me (I hate repeating recipes).

I made this recipe per the directions to go with some homemade chili and was not disappointed at all.  I used all beef hotdogs instead of the vegetarian.  I wonder if the mix I used changed the overall complexion of the dish because it turned out rather sweet.  I used Trader Joe's cornbread mix which also has whole kernels in it, adding some additional texture.  I think next time I'll add some sort of crispy topping, some green pepper and red onion to the vegetable mix, and perhaps a tiny bit of cumin and paprika to give a bit more depth.  Pretty darn good, could be great with doctoring.  Most importantly the kids LOVED it and cleared their plates.

This was just okay.  It tasted more like corn bread with hotdogs in it.  It was a little dry.  Though I did not add any celery to it because a true corn dog does not have celery and it just sounded a little odd.  Maybe next time I will try Velveeta to add more moisture.

My kids did not care for this. Although, I did use sausage instead b/c there were no hot dogs available. So, I gave it 2 stars b/c I don't think it would have made a difference.

I made this a few weeks ago, followed the recipe exactly. But nobody in my family would eat this,. Maybe it's just cause we're not big fans of veggie dogs, but we had to order a pizza.

I loved this. I been having craving for it lately. The celery gives it the sweetness. I think it works out better if you fix the hot dog mixture in with the cornbread one.

This was okay. Not the best out there. I was a little disappointed in it, especially after the corn dog muffins turned out so great! This was definetely a little dry, and the celery kind threw me off. I'll probably just stick with the corn dog muffins recipe...

My great nephew (7 y/o) and myself, made this tonight. Everyone loved it.It was very filling and very easy to make. I changed a few things because I didn't have the right stuff.Instead of green onions I used a green pepper and a regular onion. I did not use rubbed sage, because I didn't have any, and instead of using 2 lbs of hot dogs I used 1 pd of cheese dogs and 1 pd of polish sausage (big hot dogs)and it was delicious!!!

The flavor was good, but i guess i didn't go shallow ENOUGH (I halved it)..... it took forever to cook, and the cheese on top burned.  In hindsight, and for next time, i think i'll go with my cast iron skillet as the casserole dish.  I used the celery and onion, and was happy that i did.

I'm not much of a hot dog fan but this really good.  I think the sage gives it a great flavor. I did make some changes though.  I cut the hot dogs into smaller pieces and put 2 cups of cheese in it with a cup sprinkled over the top...kids love it that way.  I put the cover on the last 5 minutes or so since I have had a problem with it getting too dark.  By the way, the 15 ounce cornbread mix works fine with this recipe.

This was ok. It actually tasted like a corn dog when we put a lot of ketchup on it, but other than that, I really wasn't too thrilled with the taste. Not sure if I would make this again or just have corn dogs!

It isn't the best thing I have eaten and it is not the worst. It serves its purpose, although I do not see myself making it in the futute, if I did I would use real hot dogs.

I am giving this a 4 star rating because it was easy and would have tasted really good.  I absolutely despies veggie dogs, so I really didn't like the taste of it.  If I ate meat again, I would use the "real" hotdogs and it would be wonderful.

Good for vegetarians too! My husband loved it with mustard on the side. Updated! I have made this a bunch of times and we all love it. I just mix everything together and I cut the dogs smaller so it's easier for my 20 month old daughter.

My husband is doing a vegetarian diet for health reasons, and it's hard to find things to cook for the whole family to enjoy.  This was definitely it.  My two year old even asked for seconds!  The recipe must make a lot, since I only made a third for our small family and there were still leftovers.  All it all in was very tasty though and something a little different than beans or pasta for vegetarians.

This is just a fun, tasty recipe. We loved it. The combination of sage and celery makes it very flavorful. I halved the recipe because I wasn't so sure about it, but it was wonderful and will definitely make it again on a regular basis. It's a fun change of pace and easy to prepare.

It's funny, but I like this casserole more than my kids do.  It's sort of a mature version of what a corndog tastes like because of the celery and what not.  I think it's really good.  I make it with Turkey dogs only and serve with ketchup and mustard.

It's not something that would impress company, but something different if you feel like not cooking the "normal" chicken casserole.

This was just ok for me but my kids and hubby loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and served with a salad and was very filling. I will keep this as a quick meal to whip up expecially when I end up with a few extra kids at dinner time.

I've never had a corn dog (always tended more towards the funnel cakes and sweets when it comes to fair food), but this was tasty and a nice-looking casserole.  I cut the hotdogs in rounds because that seemed more appetizing to me for some reason.  My 2 year-old wouldn't eat it, but he hates anything new.  I didn't love this so much that I'll make it very often, but I will keep it on hand as a good kid-friendly dish.
