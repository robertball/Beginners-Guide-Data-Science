I double the chocolate, bc, why not. This time we added almond extract to both cake batter and icing...smells divine!

An easy 5 star chocolate cake.
I tripled the amount of cocoa and baking time needed to be  increased by 20 minutes.
( It could be my oven so bake as directed and test if done.)

What a moist cake! I made the recipe as instructed but added chopped pecans on top. The cake itself is not too sweet but with the very sweet topping creates a perfect combination. This was a super easy recipe and my first cake from scratch. Will make it again. It got a silent reaction because my family was too busy inhaling this cake.

Good cake I made for my husband’s birthday  & he enjoyed it. I do think next time I will tone down the icing as a tad sweet for us, but it was such comfort while inside during this Covid-19. 0

So amazing! I accidentally only put 1/2 cup of butter in the cake and I don’t know if it needed another 1/2 cup. It was delicious! I also added 1/4 tsp of salt to the icing because it was very sweet. I will definitely be baking this one again!

Good cake. I doubled the cocoa in the cake mix. Tastes exactly like Dunkin Hines to me, though, with exception of the great frosting.

I made this cake for my husband’s birthday last weekend.   It was so good I made it again this weekend.  I too had to double the cook time before it was done.  This time I doubled the frosting recipe and added 1/2 t cinnamon and a cup of pecans.  Delicious.

I've been making Texas Sheet Cakes for 44 years...this is the best recipe yet!  The sour cream and coffee rounds out the chocolate to perfection.

I've actually made it many times. This time I put it in two 9-inch round pans. One for a friend, and one for me!  :)

Very good. Frosting was a bit runny so added more powdered sugar.  Probably would sprinkle powdered sugar on top instead of frosting.

After making this moist, delicious, and oh so chocolate cake I told myself not to ever make it again for my household as we could not stop eating it. The only change I made was to sprinkle chopped walnuts on the top.

Wow. Awesome chocolate flavor and cake is super soft. Had it for my b-day and couldn't ask for better. Girlfriend made as directed and wouldn't change a thing. Now for my second piece!
