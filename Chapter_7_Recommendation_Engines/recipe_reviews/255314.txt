9.28.16   It certainly is an interesting combination of ingredients, I just think this is one where youâ€™ll need to tweak to your own personal taste preference.

added egg, and it came out nicely. this is definitely something for someone who is broke and just tired of regular ramen. it is very sweet and recommend adding just a bit more of the seasonings to balance it.

This has a good base idea, but you should probably tweak it a little bit. Someone else said to add egg, which worked great and added another layer of flavor. I added some red flakes and cayenne pepper because I knew it was going to be too sweet. It was not so sweet to the point that it's bad, but the syrup is pretty potent. I would recommend putting even less syrup than is called for. Nonetheless, I finished the whole bowl and personally really enjoyed it. I will probably be making it again because it's better than plain old ramen.
