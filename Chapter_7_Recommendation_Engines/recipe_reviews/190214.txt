I made this dish as directed...it was very bland and not pleasant to eat. The directions were sketchy...I put it on HIGH for 4 hours and it was a good thing I did...the potatoes were just past cooked...I would not recommend this as it was written.

I used a porktenderloin that was packed already marinating in a garlic/lemon seasoning.  I used more vegetables than the recipe called for, so it took a little longer but the tenderness of that loin gave 'ME' GREAT REVIEWS!!!    T H A N K S ! ! ! ! ! !

As the author stated, this is a great base recipe to tailor to your liking! I slightly increased the amount of veggies and added 1 chopped celery stalk celery, 1 quartered red apple, and for herbs I added 1 tsp dried thyme, 1 tsp dried rosemary, 2 bay leaves and 1 Tbsp dried parsley (fresh herbs would have been better). For the beer, I increased the amount to 8 fl oz and used Rickard's Red (I'd prefer to use Rickard's Dark, but we were out). I cooked it on high for 4 hrs instead of on low. Extremely flavorful, tender, and convenient. My family and I loved it and will make it again. I highly recommend this recipe and encourage tailoring it by adding herbs/spices you like that compliment pork.

It wasn't bad, I just didn't care for it.  The meat was very tender.  Just didn't like the flavor much.

This tasted just like every other slow cooker roast type thing.  I will say I felt like it was a perfectly good waste of beer :0(

I made this as directed using Wierbacher Winter Ale & added more veggies, garlic and sea salt as well as 1 can of Hunts diced tomatoes.  It was pretty good.  I nice base recipe to explore options and a great way to use up some of your least favorite brews included in a sampler pack! I only gave it 3 stars because it did need some tweaking to make it just right for us.

I used a tenderloin that was already seasoned with garlic and rosemary.  I slow cooked the tenderloin in Yuenling Black and Tan (the only beer I had on hand at the moment) for 5 hours. The meat was absolutely amazing, so tender and tasteful.  The left over juices I made a gravy and served with mashed potatoes.  The dish was delicious and definitely a keeper.

2 stars for ease of preparation, otherwise it was a waste of ingredients. No taste, very bland.

Absolutely delicious. I loaded the cooker with extra carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms. This was so simple.

Meh.  I liked the vegetables in this--they absorbed a nice flavor from the ingredients (I used a Samuel Adams beer), but the pork itself was rather dry and bland.  Not sure if using pork chops instead would make the meat more flavorful, or if I should just cook veggies in the crock pot and roast the pork in the oven separately.  I didn't try a big tenderloin with this recipe--just did a small piece, about 4 servings worth.  Perhaps I overcooked it?  I will attribute the dryness to user error, but the meat still wasn't flavorful enough for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added spices and a diced apple and salt and peppered to taste. I left out the vinegar because the beer was enough to tenderize the pork. It sure did come out great. My husband couldn't  get enough. The only thing is my prep time was 45 min instead if the 15 mins they said.  So if you are making this before you go to work make sure you start an hour before to give yourself enough time to prep and clean up.

I used an entire large can of beer and still didn't have enough stock so I added two cups of chicken stock.  This is probably because I added more vegetables than the recipe called for.  I also cooked it on high for 4 hours but it wasn't nearly cooked so I had to transfer everything to a roasting pan and put it in the oven on 400 for about 25 minutes.  In the end, it turned out delicious and the family eat every last bit.

We like beer but did not like the beer flavor in the vegetables. I will try a different recipe next time.

Added more potatoes. I used the petite medley potatoes and baby gold. Also added extra sage and cooked low for 8 hours.

Nice recipe! Great base, added lots of spices and whatever veggies were in the fridge. I also used a Beau's Marzen which is an amber lager. Put it on for 8 hours on low just because I know my slow cooker. Thanks!

We loved it. Even our 12-year-old, who doesn't like meat, loved it. Only problem I had was my fault. I doubled the vegetables and then added more beer to compensate, which made it a little too watery. I should have just relied on the condensation from the veggies to make up for the added bulk.

Good mix of veggies and meat, just needed more spice.
