Overall pretty good - I cut this down to 4 servings used dijon mustard and instead of nonfat evaporated milk I just used skim milk. I served it over grilled chicken and mixed greens.

I thought this was a very good recipe a nice change from the ranch dressing that I have been making lately. I have to change dressings every so often because my husband gets bored with the same dressing all the time. I did change some things. I used balsamic vinegar and couldn't see opening a can of evaporated milk for just 2 tablespoons so I used heavy cream (helps keep the carbs down since I used the balsamic vinegar)

Tasty dressing for a leaf lettuce salad with garden fresh cucumber and tomato. I added a small amount of honey to the dressing and used fresh dill from my herb garden lots of it. Forgot to add the milk - without it the dressing was a little too sharp with strong vinegar taste but I'm not rating the recipe lower since that was my fault.

We liked this better for dipping pretzels than a salad dressing but that might have been my fault. I used nonfat dry milk instead of evaporated so it might have been a slightly different taste. Added more cheese though because it was too soupy for dipping. I'd make again to use as a dip!
