This recipe was awesome, but I did make a change. I used dried parsley because the store was out of fresh. I also added a couple T's of fresh chopped rosemary to it. I made the dressing the night before so the flavors would meld. I got great reviews for this one.

Great concept, but the lemon was too much of a good thing.  Rather than subtle and pleasant it was a little overbearing.  Back off on the lemon zest and this would be wonderful.

Delicious! I used regular baking potatoes and served this with tilapia and broccoli. The only thing different I did was throw the potatoes with the dressing in a pan and broil with the fish for 7 minutes. Will make again.

Very, Very yummy! I had to use Yukon Gold potatoes, that is all I had.  Went really good with lemon garlic fish. Will make again...

Wonderful recipe for potatoes with a great lemon flavor!  I opted for fresh lemon juice and lemon zest.  This was quick and easy - perfect side dish for a weeknight meal!

Very good!  I doubled the recipe, and to make the measurements easier, I just used the juice and zest of 1/2 lemon, used 1 Tbsp. each olive oil and melted butter, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  I served it with chicken, but I think these would be best with fish.

These were really great potatoes! I made them with some lemon herb chicken breasts seasoned with lemon/herb seasoning and lemon juice. I also added the seasoning to the potatoes as well. At first I wasn't so sure about using lemon juice with potatoes but they turned out fantastic and I cant wait to make these agian. I really liked these and so did the rest of my family. what an orginal idea, I wish I would have come up with it! ha ha. Thanks for the fabulous recipe.

Very light-tasting and nicely flavored.  I would add a little more pepper for personal taste.

Something different for potatoes!  Yeah!  The lemon might have been a bit strong at first, but it was addicting after awhile.  I couldn't stop eating them!  This is so easy, too--done in 20 minutes.

Delicious, especially for the citrus lover. I used lime instead of lemon, added a little more salt, and added a chopped plum tomato.

These were ok.  Family thought the lemon was a little strong, but they were a cahnge of pace.

At first I thought, "wow, it's awfully lemony." But then the lemony goodness grew on me. I might cut back slightly on the lemon juice next time, but otherwise it worked great with a tomato/orange-based chicken dish.

was not impressed. Maybe I should have given it more time to sit so flavors could meld.

Wonderful! I used a little extra lemon juice because I love the flavor. Next time I'm going to use a lot more parsley because it really soaked up the flavor of all the ingredients. This was my side dish to poached salmon. I can't wait to eat this again!
