I strongly recommend to rinse quinoa thoroughly before toasting it a little to remove its natural defense of bitterness & proceed w/the recipe.

This is the best simple Quinoa recipe I have found so far, I did alter it a bit though. I used low sodium soy sauce, used two tablespoons grated fresh ginger.  And for the onion (because I didn't have any green onions at the time) I used 1 tablespoon minced yellow onion and added it with the broth and other ingredients, then topped with crushed parsley. It was delicious as a healthy snack as well as a sidedish.

This is a nicely flavored quinoa, but I like to have some variation in texture, so I added arame (seaweed) and avocado, which for me would make this 5 stars. I also used veg broth instead of chicken. Nice, easy recipe!

This is the best quinoa recipe I've tried so far. I think quinoa works with an asian flavor. It was a little too strong though. I would double quinoa, cut back the soy sauce, or use low sodium chicken stock (too salty) next time. Also add broccoli!

I really liked this recipe... gave real rich flavor... although I used toasted sesame oil and chopped up some carrots instead of the onions :)

Just made this for lunch and it was awesome.  I reduced the soy sauce to 1 TB and increased the garlic and ginger (1 small bulb, or about a dozen cloves and 1/4 minced fresh ginger).  I think that the cooking time directed may be too long.  My quinoa seemed done about 10 minutes sooner than described in the recipe.  Over cooking quinoa ruins the texture.  It becomes mushy and loses the mild crunchiness it has when cooked until the spirals start showing on the kernels.

Gah, salty!!!! I just finished making this (following the recipe as is) and it's so, so salty! Use reduced sodium broth and 1/2 the soy sauce. 
In the mean time, I'm going to work on making this taste better.

I love finding new ways to prepare quinoa, and this recipe is one that I really enjoyed.  The only change I made was to use sesame oil rather than olive oil for that extra asian flavor.  Some toasted peanuts or cashews would also give this dish some texture.  thanks for the recipe!

This is the go-to Quinoa recipe!!!  I have tried probably a dozen quinoa recipes and this is hands down my favorite.  The ginger and the soy sauce beautifully complement the flavor of the quinoa!  You must use fresh ginger!  If you have more than one type of quinoa available to you I recommend using the common lighter colored quinoa (looks off-white).  We have a local farmer who grows multiple varieties so I mix 3/4 white quinoa and 1/4 red quinoa.  The white absorbs the flavors better the red gives it a nice crunchy texture.  If you buy it in the store, the red quinoa will not absorb the flavors as well.

I made this recipe with bulgur (I find the two grains almost interchangeable) and my family loved it. I sauted an onion and two cloves of garlic before toasting the bulgur and then omitted the garlic powder. Simple and delicious.

I omitted the oil, and used water instead of broth.  I cooked the quinoa right in the soy sauce, ginger and garlic water.  This is a little too salty, so maybe I will try a low sodium soy sauce next time!

Super delish, easy weekday meal! However, we definitely added half the soy sauce it calls for, about 3 times the garlic and also about 1-2 tablespoons of ginger. AND definitely add steamed broccoli! I just threw some chopped broccoli over the quinoa mixture with a little extra water as it finished cooking in the pan. This is really good stuff!

This was a great start... I added a head of broccoli, 1/2 a red bell pepper, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and served with 3/4 lb of chicken I cooked seperately.  I tossed the broccoli, pre-cooked chicken and red bell pepper in after 20 minutes and the veggies were perfectly done, not soggy!   The recipe was a bit salty for my tastes; next time I will try 1 cup chicken broth, 1 cup water to reduce the sodium while keeping the soy sauce flavor.

I love quinoa and eat it all the time so I was looking for something to spice it up a bit. This was definitely worthwhile, although it would be waaay too salty for me with full salt soy sauce and broth (I used low sodium for both). I also added red bell pepper and broccoli because I had it around (next time I'll add the broccoli later or steam it separately, it got too mushy) and water chestnuts, which I love and are a nice healthy way to bulk it up.

Way too salty. Maybe the chicken broth I used?? I might try it again being careful to read the sodium content on the broth and soy sauce.

Not bad! Definitely better than other quinoa dishes I've tried. Following the advice of another member, I added water chestnut, which I think made the dish much better by adding texture. I also added less soy sauce, used low sodium chicken broth, and before serving, mixed in a splash of sesame oil. I would definitely make this again. WATER CHESTNUT is key!

My family gave this a 5 star!!!  I did add some minced carrot for color & texture and reduced the soy to 1 T (I did not have reduced sodium).  I also rinsed the Quinoa as suggested.  My boys loved it so much that they asked to take some along with my Asian pork to school for lunch tomorrow!!  This is a definate keeper - Thanks for sharing!!

This was so good.  Made it to sub for rice under an "asian" chicken I made.  Rave reviews from the testers!  I did rinse quinoa first then used sesame and olive oil to toast.  I also did not have any green onion on hand so I added some dried onion flakes and it did well.  AND I used reduced salt chicken broth, I would not use regular with the soy.  I will be making this often.

This recipe cooked the quinoa to a nice fluffy consistency. I served it with glazed salmon. I always rinse quinoa before cooking so I skipped toasting it in oil. Even the quinoa complainers in my household enjoyed this recipe. Thank you for posting!

I typically find quinoa boring but this was super delicious. I adjusted by using low sodium soy sauce and low sodium veg broth. I thought the flavors perfectly balanced.

Bit salty and overpowering soy sauce taste I thought next time I'll use half as much sauce requested . Really good otherwise.

This was pretty good.  I only used 1 Tbsp soy sauce.  Next time I'd add some veggies - maybe carrots and broccoli - to make it a bit more interesting.

Excellent! I used 1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger because I was out of fresh. I might stir in something extra next time for some crunch.

Good, flavorful and easy.  The soy sauce flavor overpowers a bit, but this is a tasty way to make quinoa.

I used bulgur instead of quinoa and it turned out semi-bland.  I don't think there are strong enough flavors in the recipe to really pop, but it was a good starting point.  I upped the soy sauce (low sodium), added hoisin sauce, and a whole head of steamed broccoli.  I also added a little more ginger.  Turned out tasty!

very good!  I used low sodium broth (think it would be much to salty otherwise), added finely chopped bell pepper, and followed others advice using extra ginger.... I might  not do the extra ginger next time, but overall a success!  My husband, who was skeptical about this "new thing" called Quinoa, loved it!

Awesome.  I'm new to this quinoa, so I've been experimenting with different ways to cook it.  Never thought of this!  This recipe's definitely a keeper.  I added the carrots, celery, snap peas, as well as some cilantro at the end.  Oh, and yes, the cooking time in the recipe is about 10 minutes too long.

Unfortunately I had to omit the green onions and broth - as I didn't have any on had. I cooked it in the rice cooker as the author suggested - and it was fabulous. (So I also did not 'toast' the quinoa in olive oil - just threw all in the rice cooker)

Loved the flavor, I'll probably cut down on the liquid next time, or maybe I toasted it too long?  The texture of the quinoa was a little mushy to me.

The perfect compliment to our Barbeque Halibut Steaks.  Delicious.  I did use just one tablespoon of soy sauce so it would not be too salty.  The green onions are a must.

Use a tiny bit of toasted sesame oil, add extra ginger, a few chopped carrots, a few finely chopped broccoli florets, don't add soy sauce while cooking. Add sparingly after cooked.

First time trying quinoa with my rice-loving family. I thought it was good, although I still found it salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce and only used half the amount, as per other reviewers. Nice substitute for rice. Perhaps mix in some unsalted freezer veggies.

Delicious but it came out mushy.  My box of quinoa says to cook 10-15 minutes.  I will do this next time & add mushrooms.  Made with pan seared salmon marinated in soy sauce and sesame oil.

This was fantastic! My husband and kids ate it up!  Because some of the other reviews said this could be a bit salty I made one change - I used 2 cups of water and 1tsp of chicken boullion in place of the chicken brothIt was a perfect companion to teriyaki pork and asian salad. Used the leftovers, combined with some veggies and leftover pork to make a great salad.  Great recipe - Thanks!

Loved this one and so did my kids. A great variation to fried rice and a ton healthier. I made it with low-sodium soy sauce, more ginger (as suggested by another reviewer) and served it with Ma Po Tofu with Eggplant. It was delish. I felt like a vegetarian gourmet cook! :)

This is a fantastic quinoa recipe.  I follow the ingredients exactly except for the last 5 minutes, I throw in a cup of shelled edamame and and a cup diced green onion.  I save out half of the green tops of the onion to add raw before chowing down!  The first night I eat it hot, but it is even better the next day cold for lunch!  It is similar to couscous only better. Great flavors!

This was my first time trying Quinoa.  I followed some of the other suggestions and added carrots, celery, peas, onions, and green onions that I cooked separately and added to the quinoa in the last 5 minutes.  I also reduced the soy sauce even though I was using low salt soy sauce.  Everyone loved it.  I made it along with the slow cooker Mongolian Beef from this web site.  That was also good.  I messed up and added a little too much fresh ginger in it but still liked it.  I steamed some fresh sugar snap peas to round out the meal. I will be making both recipes again!!

Fantastic recipe!  I wish I had made more because my family ate it and were looking for seconds.  I was shocked because my kids usually complain when I make Asian dishes for dinner.  I added chopped broccoli and carrots for added nutrition, texture, and flavor.

It was ok... This was my first experience with quinoa so I don't know how much of it is just my personal taste preference or the actual recipe itself.  It had a weird textural feel to it that I didn't care for.

This is excellent!  We added peas, onions, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and cashews to it.  I stir fried them alone and then added them to the quinoa during the last 5 minutes.  It tasted just like fried rice but it was healthy!  I highly recommend this.

This was my first time making quinoa and I was very impressed how this turned out. The only thing I changed was to use low sodium soy sauce because the chicken broth I used was quite salty. The flavours  are great and it's such a nice change from brown rice.

Good side dish. We did use 2 cloves of garlic & could hardly taste it.  Could use alittle more ginger root, but that is a personal preference.

Love, love, love this recipe.  I am always looking for new ways to use quinoa.  This one was great for a side dish to our teriyaki pork tenderloin.  I did not have any green onions, so just left those out.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as written, and there are no leftovers.

This was really good! I used it as a base for a stir fry instead of typical rice.  Only thing i did different was i cooked the quinoa in water bc i had no broth left.  I will definitely make this again and make sure i have broth this time! Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!!  It was my first time cooking quinoa and this was just the recipe to experiment on.  It was easy and the ingredients are all readily available.  I am addicted!!!!!  I didn't change a thing.  It was served it with turkey burgers!!  Delish :-)

this is the first time I've had quinoa, and although the flavor was good we weren't too keen on the texture of the grain.  this recipe would work well with bulgar too!

A great, easy starter intro to quinoa. I'd been wanting to try it for a while but it seemed daunting. This was a great way to give it a shot - it tasted so good!

Love this recipe. Made it several times now, first time was over dark greens & topped w/ salmon & mandarin orange slices. Most recently topped with bean sprout stir-fry & spicy baked tofu. Every time is delicious!

I have made this twice, the second time I omitted the garlic (husband cannot eat it anymore).  All I tasted was soy sauce.  I was not a fan, probably won't make it again.

I've made quinoa for a while now and always thinking ways of adding flavor to it.  Great recipe overall. I agree with other reviews regarding soy sauce, I suggest cutting down the amount of soy sauce so it won't be too salty. I enjoy turmeric and added just a pinch,  turned out great!

Way way to salty. I couldn't taste any other flavors over the salt. I think next time I'll half the soy and see how it goes. Still have two stars because I think the flavor mix has potential

I liked this dish.  It's a perfect accompaniment if you desire a side dish with Asian flare.  My only complaint is a subliminal bitterness in the background.  Now, I see another rater recommended rinsing the quinoa first (before toasting it) to remove the bitterness.  Dang it. I didn't know this!  I wish the recipe included rinsing the quinoa in the instructions.  Nevertheless, it's a good recipe and I will absolutely make it again (but I'll rinse the quinoa next time :)

As other reviewers have noted ( I wish I read the reviews before making it), this dish is too salty.  Reduce the soy sauce and cut the chicken stock with water.  I used fresh ginger and garlic and added broccoli.

I was so surprised by how good this recipe is! I used 1/2 tb spoon of dark soy sauce and 1 1/2 tb of light soy sauce. I added silced carrots with the rice. When everything was ready I added pre-cooked cubed chicken and green beens. It was so so good! Perfect for a weeknight dinner.

This was very delicious and easy to make. A perfect side dish for lots of meals. I did rinse the quinoa first, as recommended by several people. I also used the lowest sodium chicken broth I could find, as well as cutting down on the soy sauce a bit. You can always go back and add more if you need to. Other than that, I went by the recipe, and it did not disappoint!  Oh, and I did throw in a bit more ginger than called for, only because I adore fresh ginger!  I will be making this regularly for certain. Give it a go! You'll be happy you did!

This was my first time cooking quinoa. It was OK. I followed the recipe, and I typically love those flavors. However,  it seemed like something was missing. One of the readers mentioned sesame oil (maybe toasted sesame seeds would be good, too) and that seems like it might improve the flavor. I liked the texture and the green onions. I think this has potential with some modifications.

So, I have revised my rating to four stars. Yesterday, using the leftover quinoa, I made "fried rice" with it as another reviewer suggested. In my wok, I sauteed thinly sliced carrot, minced garlic, and diced onion in olive oil for about five minutes, then I added the cold quinoa (I estimate it was about 2.5 cups leftover), cut-up asparagus (also leftover from the night before), a dash of Asian Perfect Pinch (McCormick), and more low-sodium soy sauce (about 2 T). After another five minutes, I pushed the quinoa mixture to the side and scrambled an egg. Mixing in the egg, I added leftover diced chicken and cooked the mixture through (another five minutes).  Serving, I topped each bowl with green onions and a splash of soy sauce. It was fantastic!

Good as is, but I made a few changes. To cut down on saltiness I used only 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of water. And I used sesame oil instead of olive oil.  I top the quinoa with stir fry and it makes a great meal.

I will try it again. I normally use low salt soya sauce, but I was out and used the regular one.  Hence why I think it was too salty.

We love quinoa so I made this instead of brown rice to go along with a chicken stir fry. The flavor worked fine , but we all missed the texture from the rice. It doesn't have enough body for a side dish or to stand on its own. Probably won't make again.

Delicious- I made this as a side dish to salmon. I will say that I should've read the reviews about using reduced sodium chicken broth, because it was a tad salty. 

Will remember next time.

I am glad I only made half a batch - this was pretty boring and definitely lacking something.  I used a no sodium chicken broth and found the 1 tablespoon of reduced sodium soy sauce (a house favorite, one we always find tasty) not sufficient.  I served this with Grilled Salmon with Orange Glaze and thought the extra glaze added quite a bit of flavor.  If I make this again, I'll add more ginger, soy sauce and some type of fruit like pineapple or mandarin oranges.

This is exactly how I make my quinoa.  The only thing i do is add a little white pepper, sesame oil and chili pepper flakes.  I like a little kick. My kids love it because is not bland like eating quinoa with just chicken broth.
