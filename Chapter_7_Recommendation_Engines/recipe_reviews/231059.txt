This was a nice change from the regular pumpkin roll we eat every year. I only had two issues with this, which is why I gave it 4 stars. One, 3 cups of confectioner's sugar was way too much for our liking. I tasted the icing at 2 cups and it was already much sweeter than expected. 3 cups was just entirely too much (I'm sure there are some out there with a sweet tooth that would love that much, just not us.) Two, I had issues with the cake falling apart. Every time I cut a slice, it would break in half. Definitely a moist cake with good flavor but it just didn't want to stay together. Overall, I'd probably make it again and use my own recipe for the icing. I'm also going to search around for a way to help it not fall apart next time. Thanks for the recipe Claire!

I made this but used a spice cake mix, 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of oil. Then sprinkled cinnamon on the top of the frosting. It was fabulous, easy and an excellent replacement for pie during the colder months.

I made the cake following the recipe, but I used my own recipe for cream cheese frosting. My family ate it all in one night. I would make it again.

Very good cake!  I added my own touch by adding a few other spices. (clove, cinnamon, vanilla extract and a bit of mayonnaise to the batter). Also, I only had a white cake mix on hand. I used ready made cream cheese frosting instead of making homemade.  The cake disappeared quickly!  It was very flavorful and moist! I will definitely make it again! :)

This is the best and easiest pumpkin cake ever!  I have made this several times and it gets rave reviews from everyone.  Of course, I make my own icing because I'm the area cake baker and have my own recipe.

Followed recipe exactly. Baked perfect in 20 minutes which kind of surprised me ...Usually 13"x9" pans take longer. Cake was moist and tasted delicious. I frosted it with a homemade buttercream maple frosting.

I had a white cake mix in the pantry, and found this recipe.  Luckily, also had a can of pumpkin on hand.  Very good, with butter cream frosting too.  Next time I will use the yellow cake mix to taste any difference.  Thanks for posting.

My son and his wife said this was like pumpkin roll cake (which they love) but MUCH better. I used spice cake mix and added a bit of water because the batter seemed too thick. I had to bake it longer (for 30 minutes and probably because I had added the water).  This cake is well worth the effort of making it. It is delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper.
