This was very good. I cut the recipe in half, used Parmesan cheese, and used spelt flour for half the flour. The end results were delicious. This would make excellent pizza dough. It went great with fettuccine alfredo.

My loaf did not fully get cooked in the middle of the bread for some reason. It smelled and tasted good, though, but it was a lot of hard work kneading in all 6 cups flour - my arms felt like they were going to fall off! Plus it took more than the 30 minutes to prepare it, simply to knead the dough (It gets REALLY stiff). Everyone who ate it loved it, but I'm not sure if I'll make it again because of the elbow grease involved.

This bread was great! The directions were so easy to follow and even though I wasn't able to incorporate all 6 cups of flour to the dough, it turned out just fine and it smelled delicious.  The only bad thing was that I made it for another family and so I didn't get to eat any!

This was fabulous!  I made 1 loaf as bread and the other portion for pan pizza.  I sliced the bread and added mozzarella to it and ran it under the broiler - then added garlic and butter...fantastic.  For the pizza, I also used the 'Exquisite Pizza Sauce' found on this website.  Everyone loved it!

it was pretty good, i used it as bread so i added a lot more spices and it was still a little bland, but good consistancy to where if you play with the spices it is a good base to go by.

This bread was great, but next time I think I will put an egg wash on the outside of it to give it a "crustier" look.  I baked mine for about 40 minutes because some reviewers said the 35 wasn't enough.  Next time I will do it for about 45 minutes because I think it could have used the additional 5 minutes.  Although there are a lot of spices added into the bread, it has a very subtle flavor.  If you're really looking for something where you can distinctly taste the flavors, I would recommend doubling the spices and herbs.  I served this bread with the Spinach and Artichoke Lasagna recipe (HIGHLY recommended) on this site, and I also fixed some bruschetta to go with it.  Next time I will find a different Italian bread recipe to go with the bruschetta because this bread came out dense, heavy, and soft whereas bruschetta is best served on crispy and light bread.

I've made this bread several times, and it's always a success.  People love it and ask for a loaf to take home.

I have substituted thyme for oregano (my own preference) and I bake on a cookie sheet, shaped like a typical italian loaf and scored across the top, with corn meal to prevent sticking.

I have used parmesan reggiano in place of romano, if that's what I have on hand.  Comes out fine.

I like this recipe because it is simple and easy, and has always given me a good outcome.

Great bread, very soft and very aromatic. I did it in the breadmachine. Just follow the breadmachine rules (first liquid ingredients, then dry) and it works!

Yumm, very good recipe for pizza. I baked it on a pizza stone and the whole house was aromatic and the pizza was delicious.  (Also: I added crushed hot pepper to the dough because I like spiciness.)

G R E A T... I have made many times sometimes kneading buy had when I feel like taking the time I enjoy the kneading process but when I am in bit of a hurry I use my Kitchenaid makes quick work in just a couple of minutes I do like to finish off with a little hand kneading just have to get my hands in it. Make extra and freeze then you can have fresh bread any time. Very tasty I have made this with chicken wings and I have made with cubes of chicken breast and put in skewers with cherry tomatoes and peppers. Great for picnics. Will make again and again.

Great recipe!  My only change was to use butter instead of olive oil, which I was out of(!). 
 
Then, because it was so good, I decided to make bread sticks  from it, and they turned out really good, too.  I divided the risen dough into thirds, rolled each third to about 1/3-1/2 inch thickness, cut into about one-inch wide sticks,let them rise second time for about 40 minutes,  baked on parchment for 20 minutes at 375 degrees.  I think it made about 40 sticks, but they were being eaten right out of the oven before I thought to count them.  Big success!  I'm going to make them again, for a pot luck, and will also take homemade dipping sauce.

I used this recipe for a pizza dough.  It was wonderful!!  It had a crunchy outside and tender middle.  It was the best pizza I've ever made!***Made this again 9/21/2005, and made the whole recipe.  Made one big loaf on a cookie sheet, and the rest I divided into breadsticks.  I also used 2 cups of whole wheat flour this time.  It's still just as good!

This was my first "real" attempt at working with bread from scratch.  I'm proud to say the final product was not a dissapointment.  I made mine into breadsticks like a couple of previous reviewers and after they were done, I brushed them with garlic butter (also found on this site).  My son ate so many of these he couldn't eat his dinner.  I did have quite a few left over as my breadsticks were huge!!  I'll definitely continue to make homemade bread now that I have gotten a feel for it.  Thanks for sharing Ann.

I cut this recipe in half and tossed the ingredients in my bread machine, then let the dough rise before oven baking.  This bread was a complete hit with my husband.  I substituted italian seasoning for the oregano and basil, and parmesan for the romano (out of necessity), but the bread was delicious.

Delicious!  What a wonderful bread... and so easy to make.  My toddler helped me make it!  Even my picky eaters loved this bread.  We knew even before it was taken from the oven that it would be delicious, as the fabulous smell filled the house!

This is about the best bread I have ever made!  I scaled the bread to work in a 2-lb bread machine and it came out absolutely marvelous.  I have never seen my family so wild about a bread, and I make bread 2 or 3 times a week.  Absolutely a keeper!

Excellent bread. We were buying store herb bread before this, but not anymore. This is my kid's favorite bread. The herbs really make the bread.

I don't know how many times I've made this, but each time I did, it always came out soooo good and everyone loves it!! I always use it as a pizza crust but it's also good on its own. Never made bread before, so I didn't realize how easy it was to make this.

I have been baking bread for a long time - this is a FANTASTIC recipe. The amount of salt concerned me, as well as the amount of spices, but the bread rose beautifully and baked up nice and soft. The only change I made was to substitute in one cup of wheat flour. Kneaded the dough in a KitchenAid mixer and shaped it as round loaves on a cookie sheet. Only thing that would be better about this bread would be if the crust was thick and crunchy, but I think there's a secret to that I haven't figured out yet. Great recipe!

What a great treat! This is a simply robust bread packed with flavor! I modified just a couple of ingredients. I added rosemary, substituted parmesan, & substituted all-purpose flour. I made my in two 9x5 loaf pan since this bread is more of a hearty dipping bread I would shape it free-form into a loaf or even a a delicious round bread! Great to freeze and give as a hostess gift wrapped in a linen napkin with a bottle of wine!

This bread is delicious!  I ate almost half the loaf myself when it was still warm.  I had a problem with my yeast so it didn't rise to its full potential but it was still delicious.  I made an olive oil dip to go with it of EVOO, salt, pepper and red pepper.  It complimented it nicely.  Thank you for sharing, I am planning on making this again for the holidays.

Excellent bread recipe, Ann. Goes well with italian food and makes great toast. I love that it is so savory. I'd rather have toast in the AM that's savory rather than the sweet types.Texture is dense and rose nicely. I started it in the bread machine then finished it up in the oven.
Thanks for sharing.

This is a wonderful recipe. It went very well with my Italian potato soup. I can't wait to use it as a pizza dough. Thank you Ann for the recipe!

This recipe was the first bread I've made that didn't require a breadmachine. It was easy to make, very tasty, and scales very well. I will continue to use this recipe for future dinners, or just as a snack.

Delicious!  I made this to serve with soup & it is one of the best breads I've ever made.  I used my bread machine, so I halved the recipe & it turned out perfectly.  Even my kids (who are picky eaters) loved it.

I just finished baking this recipe and it was perfect.  I make half batches of everything (whole batches are wasted with just my husband and me around the house) and this cut in half perfectly!  The smell is mouth-watering and the bread itself is wonderful.  Try dipping it in some good olive oil, drizzle with Balsamic Vinegar and enjoy!

Excellent bread!  It's very crusty, which I love.  I let my KA mixer with the dough hook do the hard work of incorporating all the flour in, and I was able to get all 6 cups in.  I used parmesan cheese, which is what I had on hand.  I love the seasoning and can't wait to try this bread with sandwiches!  BTW, 2 packets of yeast = 4 1/2 tsp.

Lovely loaves of bread.  I didn't have the romano to add nor did I have olive oil so I used vegetable oil instead.  They still turned out very nice with a crisp crust and slice beautifully.  Very tender and tasty crumb. Thanks Ann!

Just finished dinner and this bread was a hit. I did make a couple slight changes. I added 2 Tbl. wheat gluten to help it rise better, and I used an egg wash and sprinkled it with Rosemary just before baking. Wonderful, especially with an olive oil dip.

This was an easy recipe!!!  The best bread I've ever baked:)  I let the bread machine do the mixing, kneading, and the first rise, then I shaped the loaves. Very light and tastey, and the house smelled wonderful!  Thank-you Ann....finally a success!!!

This bread was absolutely wonderful!  I will make it on a regular basis and am anxious to try it as pizza dough.  I added 2 tsp of salt as another person recommended and omitted the basil and oregano.  I used extra black pepper and parmesan in place of the romano.  This basic recipe I believe, can be "tweaked" to anyone's liking.  Thank you Ann!

If it were possible to give more than a 5 card rating I would! This is the best Italian Bread I have ever made. Even my hubby, who always teases me about my breads had nothing to say, His mouth was to full! At least a 10 card rating should go to this one.

This bread was fantastic! It was a very easy recipe to prepare. I let it rise a second time before I put it out on the baking sheet and it was the perfect, light & fluffy bread. The herbs gave it the perfect taste. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful gourmet bread! Loved it. I even did it in a buns sheet. Olive oil needs to be a bit more though, 1/2 cup instead of 1/4.

If you are after a very flavorful bread with a soft crumb and crust, this is a great bread.  My crust-hating daughter loved it - crust and all.  But if you are looking for some 'chew' and a heartieer texture/crust, this bread won't cut it.  I may try it again with some whole wheat flour.

So yummy.  Took the advice of another reviewer and cranked the oven to 425 to preheat, put the bread in, threw a cup of ice into the bottom of the oven and then lowered the temp. to 375.  Turned out AMAZING!

This is a good basic recipe, but has room for elaboration.  For those of you who keep trying to put all 6 cups of flower into the recipe, don't.  Whenever you make bread recipes the final flower addition varies depending on your location and the flower you are using.  The best thing to do is add 1.5 cups of flower and then add the flower gradually until the dough gets to the consistency you desire.  Also, adding an egg wash to the loaves after they are formed and before they are baked works really good with this recipe.

Makes a tasty bread/roll! I used this recipe to make pizza rolls (rolls w/ pizza toppings), which make a great on-the-go snack/lunch/dinner.  I omitted the cheese and used my stand mixer with dough hook to do the kneading (about 10 minutes.) To make pizza rolls: after first rising, divide dough into 24 rolls, flatten & place on parchment-lined cookie sheet, brush w/ pizza sauce (5-6 Tbsp. tomato paste, 2 Tbsp. water, 1-2 tsp. oregano, salt & pepper to taste), top with favorite toppings (I used diced ham for simplicity), sprinkle with grated cheese, cover with plastic and let rise about 20 minutes, bake at 350F for about 15-20 minutes. (Alternatively use convection oven at 325F and place 1 cookie sheet in top 1/3 of oven and one in bottom 1/3 of oven, 15-20 minutes.) These freeze well.

I've made this bread several times and it's always so good. Every time I try a different herb bread recipe, everyone tells me to just stick with this one because it's the best. It makes the house smell delicious and it's usually all gone before it's done cooling.

I LOVE this recipe!!!  I used parmesan instead of romano and it tasted great. Some tell me the bread tastes like the delicious restaurant bread you get when you wait for your meal.  It is great toasted and especially used for a panini!!!  grilled cheese on this bread is to die for!  easy to make.  it makes two large loaves.  i freeze one and take it out months later and it's still as good as the first day!!!  you will love it!

This bread was so tasty! Thank you very much for the recipe! I put the ingredients in the bread machine in the order listed in the recipe, and used the bread machine for the dough cycle. After it was complete I made the bread into a braid and baked it in the oven. It turned out large and lovely.  I did halve this recipe and use parmesean cheese instead of the romano (didn't want to run to the store). That was the only change I made and this was perfect, will try romano next time its in the fridge. My husband came home from work just as I was taking it out of the oven, we had a slice and he said, "wow this is better than Subway bread," :)  This recipe is a keeper!

WOW!!!! This was awesome! I was scared to make this because baking anything has never been my forte'. I too tried by halving the recipe and like MC_MA_OF_3, made them into breadsticks. Had I known they were going to turn out this well, I would have made the whole batch! I can't wait to try this as pizza dough. Thank you Ann!

My kids LOVED this!  And the funny part about it is that being the knuckle-head that I am, I cut the recipe in half (after it was printed) and added the full tablespoon of salt.  I made them into breadsticks, and while they were a little too salty, not one was left!  Went great with our pasta with red sauce.  Next time, I won't bother to cut it in 1/2, as they disappeared so quickly. thanks Ann!

This turned out wonderful.  Very flavorful and aromatic - we had it with pasta and it was even better.  Considering using it as a pizza crust next time.  I had no problem with it cooking through and my hint is spray it with water when putting it in the oven then 1/2 way through and again 1 minute before you take it out.  Gives it a golden crust and all it takes is a spray bottle and water...

This is a basic Italian bread recipe with the addition of the herbs. The recipe I've been using for years is the same except mine takes 2 Tbsp more oil & only 1 Tbsp yeast since it multiplies quickly. You can change up the herbs, add parmesan or sun dried tomato, cracked wheat &/or wheat germ.....whatever strikes your fancy. It makes wonderful soft bread sticks too. They're marvelous with a steaming bowl of soup!

I have made this bread for many and it is always a huge hit. I substituted thyme or just Italian seasoning for the oregano several times. I half it mix it in the bread machine and then bake it in the oven on a baking stone.

I used this recipe to make braided stuffed spaghetti. It was pretty good and worked really well. Next time I will probably use fresh garlic though. This will definitely be my go-to bread recipe!

Excellent flavor.  I added a Tablespoon or so (eyeballed it) of chopped black olive and a splash more olive oil as I was kneading it. Last 5-10 minutes, I brushed the tops with olive oil. Made excellent sandwiches with it.  My teenager enjoyed slicing and eating a half loaf while it was still warm.

This was my first time making bread, and I will definitely use this recipe again! It was surprisingly simple and smelled delicious. I made this for a dinner party and got rave reviews from my friends. I did substitute Parmesean cheese for the Romano cheese (my grocery store is seriously lacking in the cheese department!), but the change seemed to work fine. I also baked it for about 10 extra minutes as it still looked a little doughy. I highly recommend this recipe, especially if you haven't baked bread often!

Great recipe, I only did half of it and after punching the dough, I rolled it out on a floured surface, shredded mild cheddar and placed in it in the middle. Rolled into a loaf and baked for 45 minutes. Excellent!

My cooking-impaired roommate and I made this together, and I think that really helps -- having someone else to switch off with when kneading the dough is wonderful. I didn't have any problems whatsoever, and this was the first bread I made that didn't absolutely fail. I did notice some of the other reviewers, when talking about how it didn't cook, mentioned only "loaf" rather than "loaves", so I don't know if that was one of their problems...

We have tried several herb breads looking for something that really worked...  And this is IT!  Made exactly to the recipe, substituting only Parm for the Romano.  We ate an entire loaf with our soup last night!!

While yeast was activating (& later when dough was rising) I sat the bowl on a warm heating pad for even, consistent temprature. I let it rise all day & divided it into 4 small loaves.  I also replace all of the dry seasonings with 3 Tablespoons of Italian Seasoning & teaspoon garlic powder.  It was just simpler & it contains a few more Italian spices, giving it more depth.  I highly disagree that it was hard to kneed.  I have bursitis in both shoulders & wrists & this recipe never once became a problem.  Delicious!    The small loaves make great soup/dip bowls!

I enjoyed the bread--It wasn't the very best I've tried but it was very good sliced, toasted with butter and cheese.  You don't have to add any seasonings to the butter and cheese since they are already in the bread.

This is great! I mixed the seasonings and cheese in a small bowl (left out the onion powder because I was out and added extra garlic powder instead) then mixed it into my yeast mixture. I added a little flour at a time, but the last 1 1/2 cups or so I just kneaded in. The flavor is wonderful and so is the texture. It came out perfectly at exactly 35 minutes. I will be making this one again.

This was my first time making bread. The bread had a good flavor. I used my stand up mixer but I don't think I added quite enough flour because the dough wasn't that stiff. I only baked it for 18 minutes and it turned out golden brown on top but it was really dense in the middle. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I will be trying this again.

Wonderful Bread!  My daughter, who does not like a lot of the breads we make, loves this one.  I didn’t have Romano cheese so I substituted in Parmesan.  I also cut the recipe in half, because my bread machine is just a 1 or 1 ½ loaf machine.

This was a big hit in our household. Itwas made as a pizza. I rolled out the dough and added chicken,onions and roast red peppers and mozzarella cheese as a topping. It was so good and sure beat the pizzeria down the block.

Very good!  My family loved this bread.  I halved the recipe and cut the dough into two.  I froze one ball for pizza dough (which turned out great) and made the other half into about 12 breadsticks.  I also added some ground rosemary, used freshly grated parmesan cheese and brushed the breadsticks with melted butter when they came out of the oven.  Delicious!

Fabulous!  I did substitute 2 cups of whole wheat flour for all purpose, and both times I've made it, I've only ended up using a total of 5.5 cups flour.  I used parmesan cheese instead of Romano. Otherwise, made exactly as directed, and it is awesome!

I cut the recipe in half to make one nice loaf.  This had a wonderful texture and I didn't find it difficult to work with at all.  It came together nicely, and rose well.  I used fresh chopped basil from my window garden and topped with sesame and poppy seeds, and dehydrated onions.  The dried onion gave it a really nice flavor, crispy and roasted on top for extra flavor.  I halved the oregano as a personal preference.  It stayed soft the next day.  Very lovely texture.

Excellent bread.  Made with Cavatini II from this site.  Perfect together.  Like others, I made the bread with my dough cycle on my machine and then transferred to the oven after I let rise for about 30 minutes.  Delicous.

I used my breadmaker on the dough cycle to make this and then shaped it into an oval shape, let it rise about 30 min and then baked it on a cookie sheet.  I realized after I baked it that I forgot the onion powder, but it was excellent without it. I only had the canned parmesan cheese (like you sprinkle on spaghetti) but it turned out great.  Excellent recipe.

This was great bread. I scaled this recipe in half for 1 loaf and made this in my Bread Machine and it came out perfect. It rose just right. I didn’t change a thing except I used a Romano/ Parmesan blend for the cheese. I used the shaker type not fresh shredded. I used the regular white bread 1 ½ lb. loaf setting. I will make this again and again. Great potential for making the dough only in the machine and then (if you are feeling ambitious) making the Italian loaves, soft bread sticks, bread twists, pizza dough or sub rolls for meatball sandwiches or Italian cold cut subs. I will also try this on the French bread setting for a crustier loaf. It was perfect with my lasagna and it’s a flavorful and healthier alternative to the same old butter laden garlic bread accompaniment. I’m no health nut so you know this has got to be good when I consider that!

This worked great in my bread machine. The bread had a nice aroma, and was very soft.

This bread recipe is fantastic.  Works great except the cooking time was longer for me and a higher heat would brown the loaves better.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a delicious first-attempt at bread for me. The only thing I would recommend is that if you substitute garlic salt for garlic powder, don't add the regular salt at all, or it will come out very salty (still good though!). I did not add onion powder either, and used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano, and it came out delicious and soft.

I cut this recipe in half and used my bread machine set on the dough cycle.  Let dough rise, shaped into a braid and then let dough rise again.  My whole house filled with the wonderful aroma of this bread while it was baking.  Bread had a nice chewy crust and tasted great with a little butter spread on each slice.

This recipe was truly FABULOUS!!  The bread was delicious, took exactly 35 minutes in the oven, I didn't change a thing as outlined.  I made one loaf and one braid and everyone loved it.  So yummy, a keeper, soooo easy and simple and the house smelled divine.

This is fabulous bread!  I've made it several times now - served it with Luscious Spinach Artichoke Dip (on this site) as well as used it for pizza dough.  I particularly like it the second day, toasted with butter.  Yummy!  Thanks Ann!

I used this bread as a pizza crust and it was the best crust I have ever eaten. I cut the recipe in half because I couldn't fit 6 cups of bread flour in my bread machine and it was still enough to make a large pizza.

I have made this several times now, usually to take with a soup when I make dinner for a family who needs some TLC. Everyone loves it. I make it in my 6-quart Kitchen Aid so incorporating all that flour is easy. The recipe is simple to halve, though. I have used various hard aged cheeses and it's always been yummy.

Excellent recipe!  Strong suggestion?  Knead the dough on "knead" or "dough" setting in a bread machine.  After 30 minutes add flour or liquid to make dough not quite sticky to the finger touch.  Stop machine and let rise once.  Re-start machine and knead for another 30 minutes adjusting any stickyness.  Remove from machine and shape, let rise, then bake.  The consistency of your bread will be simply marvelous...knead knead knead your bread.

For people who couldn't get their bread to rise, i would use fast rising yeast like i did. Also, my house is generally cold so i put the dough in the oven at 170 F for ten mins and turn it off and left it in there for an hour. The dough rose very nicely. This was my third try and it finally worked.

This bread was simply delicious and easy to make even if you have never made bread from scratch.   My guests raved.  The bread is tender and light with just the right amount of robust herb flavor.  Thumbs up!

Great recipe. I used my mixer (sadly not a kitchen aid) to mix so I didn't have any difficulties. I added 1/2cup ground flax seed meal and omitted 1/2 cup flour to offset- just to add some fiber and a little texture. The bread was flavorful and crusty on the outside yet soft inside. A little heavy but overall just great.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! The first time I baked it exactly as the recipe dictated. However, this recipe is so easy to play with so the second time I used fresh herbs, added rosemary, and doubled the garlic powder (everyone loves garlic, right!?). With slightly less flour (5.5 cups) the bread was soft and supple, and I baked it for 30, not 35 minutes. Very, very good, and I will be making this again!

You definitely don't need 6 cups of flour for this.  5 maximum, and it was still semi-stiff.  I used fresh basil and oregano, and Reggiano.  Wonderful!

Really yummy, aromatic bread... I followed the recipe exactly and the bread turned out great. Used for sandwich bread - family loved it. Original yield states two loaves but they are HUGE loaves. I would say this recipe makes four large loaves.

A fantastic recipe! I made for the first time yesterday, and almost all of it is gone today. It had been a while since I made some bread, and this was real easy to do without using my bread machine. The seasonings worked well together and it wasn't dry at all. Towards the end of the bake time, I could smell the bread from the top of the stairs, which was very aromatic. Brushed to the top with olive oil before and after baking, which gave it a real nice brown color. I'm interested if using an egg wash will make the crust darker. The only thing I may do differently next time is use a Parmesan cheese blend and use little more cheese than what the recipe calls for. I may also make clover rolls out of them, since I made the bread for tomato soup. Perfect for dipping. In short I highly recommend this bread recipe, especially if you are looking to make bread that taste like the ones in Italian restaurants.

This bread is wonderful!  Thank you so much, I've been looking for an herb bread like those served at nice Italian restaurants.  The flavor is perfect.  We are watching our salt intake, so I did 1/2 Tablespoon (instead of 1Tablespoon) salt, then 1/2 Tablespoon Mrs. Dash Tomato Basil Garlic blend, and I also cut each of the rest of the seasonings in half (the Mrs. Dash is full of seasonings).  I also baked it without the cheese, then we mixed a Tablespoon of olive oil with ground black pepper and Parmesan cheese, and dipped the bread in it--yum!

Excellent!! I was so impressed with how this bread turned out. A nice golden color and rises perfectly while baking. I used all fresh herbs, even minced garlic. I did not use grated Romano Cheese, instead I chose a Parmesan Reggiano cheese and it was so heavenly. The aroma filled my house with scents of cheese and herbs. I served this with basil butter, from this website and also shrimp lemon pepper linguine. this made for an awesome meal. Directions easy to follow and results wonderful! Definitely will be a repeat in my house.

I got great results from this easy-to-use recipe.  My family loves bread, so this was a huge hit.  I served it with olive oil for dipping.  Really goes nicely with the top-rated lasagna recipe from this site.  Thanks for an excellent recipe for those of us who do not own bread machines!

I use this dough for EVERYTHING!  I vary it with wheat flour and more or less herbs depending on what I'm making for dinner.  It's great as a pizza dough, too.

Very good bread! I didn't have any oregano, so instead of adding that and the basil, I substituted 2 T of Mrs. Dash's Tomato Basil Garlic blend, with the onion and garlic powder. I also used a Romano/Parmesan cheese blend. The loaves were soft and fluffy, with a nice soft crust. Loved it and will try it again as a pizza crust.

Very good, refreshing bread: a few little notes, if its not cooking all the way through, like it did with me the first time I tried this a year ago... check your yeast - yes even it goes bad. Then, I also thought it needed a bolder flavor for an "italian herb bread" - so to get that add your herbs (preferably fresh and minced) with the Yeast/Sugar/water mixture and let set with the yeast until it is activated. (I used fresh oregano, rosemary, and basil from my garden, as well as a few chopped up garlic cloves). Then, to accentuate it even further, expirament with the salt levels - I thought it needed more - but this is coming from a garlic salt fanatic - which i applied generously and mixed it with the 6 cups flour before adding it. anywho, great bread. thanks christi!!

I CAN make bread. I also halved the recipe but used the same amount of herbs, wonderful. I made 12 bread rolls and 1 small round loaf. Now if I can stop eating it there will be some for tonight! Thank you so much.

I halved the recipe and put the ingredients in the "manufacturer's recommended order" in my bread machine on the dough cycle, then followed the rest of the instructions.  It turned out wonderful!!  I made it to spruce up our leftover Baked Ziti for tonight's dinner.  My four-year-old has already had two pieces!!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Yummy!! It made the house smell wonderful and it tastes incredible!   I was out of oregano and onion powder, so I substituted an extra tablespoon of basil and an extra 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder. I also used Parmesan instead of Romano. I cut some slits and hatch marks on the top once I put it in the pans so that it would look pretty.

This bread had a great flavor - not too much and not too little spice. I made as directed but cut the recipe in half. We dipped it in extra virgin olive oil that had Parmesan cheese and pepper in it. This could easily be the bread on your table at a fancy Italian restaurant.

I originally made this bread, on an occasion when I had run out of milk.  I increased the sugar and most of the spices.  Then it was very spicy indeed, almost a meal by itself.  This week I made it as a pan pizza dough, the 2-loaf recipe made about three 8-inch pan pizzas.  I also used exquisite pizza sauce thanks to an earlier reviewer's suggestion.  Everyone loved the pizzas, especially the "crust!" :D

Great recipe.  Good Choice for someone to use as their first "from scratch bread"  due to it's success rate.  We enjoyed it being tasty and basic.  Exactly what I was looking for.

This was only the second time I have ever baked bread. I cut the recipe in half and it turned out fairly well. I had to let the bread rise a little longer than the recipe called for but that was the only change I made.

This recipe makes a delicious loaf of herb bread. It's odd that people refer to it as 'spicy'.  It's an herbal aromatic bread, but not spicy. If you think it's heavy or dense, you can check if your oven runs too hot or cool with an inexpensive thermometer made to check oven temps.  If you used wheat bread instead of white - it's going to be very dense.  Follow the recipe exactly, bake it at the right temp, and it will turn out so delicious!

Made this in my new bread machine. Wasn't really all that impressed with the flavor. Nothing spectacular. Probably good with some spaghetti though, or dipped in some herb infused EVOO.

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer for this recipe. Same as I have the other two I made in the last 34 hours. I used half wheat-half white in this recipe, which 
made it drier than your typical homemade bread. I had to add a couple more tablespoons of oil to get the bread to stick together enough to knead with the dough hook. I'm not really impressed with the way it turned out. I'd like to try it again with just white flour.

I've baked quite a few breads and this one just wasn't quite right. 
It came out very dense, and a strange mixture between bland and spicy. 
One bite would be nothing but spice, the next completely bland. 
It was great when dipped into sauce (we ate it with spaghetti), but I couldn't eat it plain. 
All in all, some might like it but it definitely wasn't for us.

I think some people need to realize that everyone's oven is different, so baking times may vary! Don't give this recipe a lower rating because your oven is different from the original poster's. 

Anyway, I found that this recipe was very easy to make, and the dough was fragrant, if not a little difficult to work with. I'm taking a loaf to work with my tonight, so I'll see what my co-workers have to say!

Absolutely delicious! I used Parmesan instead of Romano cheese. This is definitely a recipe that we will be making over and over again. Whole family loves it. After trying a slice I went back to get more and one of the loaves was almost gone! Thank you very very much for this recipe.

I'm a breadaholic, and this is one of the best bread
recipes I've ever tried. It's also one of the few recipes
I didn't feel like I could make better if I tweaked it
some. I cut the recipe by 1/3 (so it gave me a 4 cup
flour loaf), but other than that I followed the recipe to
a tee. Baked it in my covered stone bread baker, then
served it with a Minestrone soup. This is truly a 5 star
recipe. Highly recommended!!!

This turned out beautifully.  I was looking for a good made from scratch recipe other than white bread, and this was perfect.  I added a few thing though after the first rising....I put about a cup and a half of shredded cheddar in the dough, and split the dough in half.  In one of the halves I put about 2 tablespoons of chopped jalopenos.  I baked both loaves in the oven on our pizza stone....and then added more cheddar to the top when I was done.  Turned our really good!

I just got myself a Kitchenaid standmixer and wanted to try out a good stiff dough to see how it would work (got a bit concerned after reading some reviews). It did fine tho and there were no problems. IT also made this recipe very easy as it doesnt require lotsof kneading. Anyways, this bread was very, very good. Nice soft texture. Will brush it with something next time to make it a bit crispier, but otherwise great.

What a yummu tasty bread this is!  Even the dough smelled great while rising!  Yes, I will agree with another comment that the kneading is a lot of work, but it's well worth it, especially if you have the time to do it!  This reminds me of the bread served at the Macaroni Grille restaurants, and definitely a recipe I will make time and again!

This bread was fabulous!  I used a different cheese, but it still turned out very well.  Instructions are incredibly easy to follow and the results were wonderful!  Definitely a keeper!

This was a really good bread - packed with flavor.  Unfortunately, I grew impatient with the rises and I think I forced it along a bit.  As a result, I came up with a rather flat bread!  Ooops!  It was still yummy and I will make it again only next time allowing myself more time.  Only thing I did different with this was to use a good amount of Italian seasoning in place of the Italian herbs, since I was out.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic!  I only made half the recipe and omitted the salt and cheese.  It smelled so good baking and tasted even better.  Next time I will try substituting some wheat flour.

this is truly a 5-star bread recipe. i've just fished the loaves out of the oven and they look marvelous. and the taste...mmmmmm! delicious! even if i wasn't able to add in the oregano (ran out of it), and had to use italian seasoning instead (was pretty desperate to try the recipe out), ran out of the specified cheese for the recipe and used regular cheddar in its place, the bread still turned out fantastic!  this would really pair well with the spicy oil & vinegar bread dip (also from this site).  Now, if i could only just stop eating it long enough to make the dip... ;-)

We really enjoyed this bread. My mom made it for us all for an "Italian Night" we did. We paired it with the "Spicy Oil and Vinegar Bread Dip" on this site, and it went perfectly! I can deffinetly see using it for a pizza dough.

Good, but not spectacular.  This bread is very flavourful - best eaten on its own with some butter.  Didn't rise at all - perhaps because of the amount of flour(seemed like too much, but the recipe states that dough should be stiff...)?  I made buns which were more like biscuits.  Nice and dense.

Absolutely delicious! I've made this at least three times now! It's perfect as a snack on its own, cut into strips and dipped, buttered for dinner, or sliced and used for sandwiches. A very moist, savory bread indeed! Yum!

I can't even give this recipe a rating as I must've done something to totally mess this up.  My dough never rose.  I did halve the recipe, so that might've had something to do with it, but I'm doubtful.

This recipe was extremely difficult to make because the dough was very firm, and difficult to knead. I did like the flavor of the end result, and would half the flour if I made this again.

I used this as a pizza crust and it was quite good, but salty.  I halved the recipe and it made a nice size large pizza.  Only thing I would change is to either omit the salt or instead of 1 tbls, use tps.

I have made this bread twice and people LOVE it.  I will say that it takes much longer than 35minutes for it to cook all the way through. I am not sure if it's something I am doing at my end, my oven , but nevertheless, it's DELICIOUS!

This bread is soooooo good.  Tender, flavorful, soft.  I made the full recipe, cut the dough into 8 parts, rolled it out and filled each with hamburger/sausage pizza combination before wrapping them shut.  Fully baked 2 for dinner; partially baked 6 for the freezer.  They were big and oh, so good.  Kids really liked 'em.

Excellent recipe!  I brushed melted butter on the top when it came out of the oven and sprinkled it with kosher salt to add a tad bit of texture and additional flavor.  Thanks!

This recipe was easy to follow and delicious!  I used grated Parmesan cheese because that’s what was in my pantry and I didn’t have basil so i added a little Italian blended seasoning.  Also while baking I put the loaves in preheated Dutch ovens which gave a really nice crust, but I had to bake a little longer.  I baked in total approximately 55 minutes.  Super good and definitely making again!

I only made 1 loaf rather than 2. Cut the bread flour in half and did wheat flour for the other half. I doubled the spices & added Italian seasoning as well. Needed a little extra water due to wheat flour but it came out amazing.

I used the exact same measurements as listed in the recipe; however, basil was not available for me. Thus, I doubled the amount of oregano and it still turned out great! On another note, I mixed all the ingredients without a kitchen aid. No issues there. I highly recommend this recipe. My sister went to culinary school and she even loved it!

This has been my go-to recipe ever since I discovered it on this site years ago. I make it exactly as written to serve at potlucks, with Italian dinners and with most soups. I even use this recipe for fresh bread with other dinners and for sandwiches, I just omit the garlic and herbs. With or without the garlic and herbs this is an awesome bread recipe that has never disappointed...or lasted very long. Thank you Ann for sharing!!!

Left out the cheese, used AP flour, and increased the garlic, using pre-minced. I made the baked loafs into garlic bread (1/2 c butter melted w/ ~3 T pre-minced garlic) and it was fantastic; definitely better than using a store-bought loaf. Will make again!

I've made this 2x now, and it is going to be a staple in  my house.  It tastes wonderful and makes the whole house smell warm and inviting. One word: do not store in the fridge. It will get dried out. After baking, I slice it up and freeze. You can take a piece or two out at a time, defrost quickly and eat.

I've made this bread several times and I recently discovered that the dough is fantastic for pizza: I recently made a batch for bread and decided to tear off a piece of the dough, and put it aside for pizza. It was fantastic. We used it for grilled pizza: be sure to pre-grill both sides of the dough before applying sauce, cheese and toppings, but don't overgrill it. Only until it's lightly toasted. If you pre-bake/grill the crust too long it will be burnt by the time the cheese is melted. I just kept an eye on it, around 5 minutes per side, depending on temperature of the coals.

I have made this one several times .  It is a family favorite.  I usually use parmesan  cheese.  I like to flavor the oil with the herbs before mixing by heating the oil on the stove, adding the herbs, and then letting it cool before adding to the dough.  A little minced garlic is good too!

Love this recipe!  Making it again today. I mixed the dough using my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook and completed the kneading a few minutes by hand. I followed the suggestions of others and put an egg wash on top and topped with kosher salt and Italian seasonings.

This is an EASY, versatile, and delicious recipe.  I made one in a traditional bread loaf pan, and rolled out the other half into a log & spliced the top, added egg wash and both loaves baked as expected.  The rising was incredible!  The result, one of the BEST Italian herb & cheese bread’s my family and I have ever tried!

Very tasty!  Smells like heaven!  Didn't have the cheese on hand so I put it together without and sent my buddy to the store for parm.  Used an egg wash to ensure shiny tops and sprinkled with parm and parsley before popping into the oven.  Basted after it came out with butter seasoned with garlic salt.  Nothing bland about this bread.  And it tastes as good as (or better) than anything I've had at any restaurant.  Worth the time and effort!  I made 4 individual "loafs", one was eaten shortly after coming out of the oven :)  Delicious and hearty!

I cut the recipe in half, and I made it in a BREAD MACHINE, set on basic recipe with medium crust. It turned out with a perfect texture, and well-balanced flavors (seasonings). Family of four enjoyed it very much accompanied by an Italian pasta dish. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This bread is easy to make and flavorful.... I used heaping teaspoons of spices and also added Rosemary.  Yum!  Per other suggestions, I would cook about 5-10 minutes longer, but it was still yummy. Did also add egg glaze per other suggestions.  Will be making this again. Bread sticks and brushed with butter sounds like a nice option I will try.

Delicious!  I used some egg wash for a nice shine. Probably should have left it bake without it. It would have looked more rustic. Had it with some olive tapenade.

I opted for making only one, and added 5 minutes to the bake time, per other reviews. Came out great and 5 stars for flexibility of recipe. I used the loaf for garlic toast and it was a hit.

I used grated Parmesan cheese instead of Romano because that's what I had on hand. Also fresh basil and oregano. Came out well. Cooking time was longer than stated.

I am not a fan of this recipe. The herbs come across wayyyy too strong. I had to throw the bread away because it just didn't taste right. I have baked quite a few different bread recipes and this one doesn't make the cut.  My tip, find another recipe somewhere else because this one just isn't worth the effort.

The crust was crusty and the bread was soft and tender.  I have bread flour and used all purpose.  The bread came out wonderful, company had seconds.  It didn't need butter

Made it twice. Both times I used parmesian instead of Romano, all I had, was delicious! Even made the second batch into breadsticks for pizza night.

This was SO good.  Will definitely save this recipe and make many more times.  Did the egg wash on top as suggested and sprinkled with Italian seasoning before baking.  Amazing bread recipe even if I hadn't done what I did.  You will not be disappointed.  Thank you for this recipe,  we truly love it!?

This bread was so easy to make. The smell is great and the taste is out of this world!! I'll make this again and again. I used a little more seasonings and cheese than called for and used parmesan   cheese. My son and his friend ate a  whole loaf in one night!

First off, I love this how it is. I've been making this recipe for years. However, I have made modifications to suit my taste. :) 

First, I half the recipe. I still make two good sized loaves with the dough that I have. Personally, I like the consistency better this way. 

Plus, now I cook these on a big cast iron griddle. (Mine came in a Ozark Trail set from Walmart) at 450 degrees for 20 minutes. 

With the slightly thinner loaves you get from halving the recipe combined with the higher temperature, what you get is a loaf that is nice and crusty on the outside, but soft on the inside. 

If you want it even crustier/crunchier, try brushing your loaves with an egg wash just before baking. It will make them shiny and awesome.

I have made this bread about a dozen times and each time it is a huge success.  The only change I have made is adding a couple pinches of fresh Rosemary.  Excellent recipe.  Thank You for sharing this.

STUNNING. After the first rise, I split off half of the dough and put it in the freezer to bake another time. I'm glad I did, because we are eating this first loaf WAY too quickly!

No way! I CAN make bread! Beginner bread makers, look no further! I followed the directions exactly, only I took a reviewer's advice and spritzed with water before baking to help it brown. Unlike other reviewers, I did not find it too salty or too dense. It was wonderful! I will most definitely double the herbs and use fresh garlic next time, as it was very mild in flavor, but the texture was perfect. I can't wait till the weekend so I can try it again and experiment with other flavors and shapes.

Update: I just made it again and it was even better! I did it in bread pans this time, brushed in egg wash and sprinkled with kosher salt. Simply gorgeous!

This cooking time for this recipe is off. It needs at least 45 minutes, if not more. My bread did not come out crunchy, nor did it brown well because I followed the directions. Next time I will remember to score it (that was not in the directions) before baking and I will spritz it with water or put an egg wash on it to give it a better colour and more "crunch". It felt weird not doing that but I always follow the directions first time out and then adjust for the next time round. It's very good. My husband and son were standing around the oven waiting for it to come out! So it is a great recipe but it just needs a few adjustments.

Delicious! Followed some other suggestions and made into bread sticks. Eggwash and scored for presentation, sprinkled top with Italian seasoning and parmesan. Add a little salt next time, too, I think. Brushed with butter when fresh out of the oven. Followed baking instructions exactly.

Since I didn't have any romano cheese I used freshly grated parmesan cheese and used less flour than called for because the dough was too stiff to work with the full amount.   I doubled it and made six long thin loaves to serve at a wedding.  The guests loved the bread.  The herbs were just right and the texture perfect.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Made this surprisingly easy and delicious bread recipe today. Everyone loved the crispy crust and moist chewy texture. Made half the recipe and went light on the  herbs and was a little more generous with the cheese  in the dough.  It yielded two 16" loaves, about 3" in circumference, that paired well with the spaghetti and meatballs we had for dinner.  Didn't feel guilty for having 5 slices myself... The rest was devoured by the others at dinner! Will definitely be making this recipe again and again! Yummmm!!!

My first attempt at bread from scratch.  Next time I'll add more herbs and probably some additional types of cheese.  I would have preferred a bolder flavor.  My crust was perfect, very dense loaf.  I will definitely make again.  Bake time was about 45 min, one loaf was a bit bigger than the other, so I made sure I monitored internal temperature...190 degrees for bread to make sure the inside isn't raw.  Aside from that, I did have a problem incorporating some of the flour, I was using the dough hook on my kitchenaid to do most of the leg work for me.  But I just added an additional splash of olive oil and the rest of the flour went right in.

Fantastic simple bread with lots of delicious spices-just the right amount. Makes quite a bit of dough. Half of the recipe made a really large loaf which was perfectly cooked at 30 min as directed. Used half of the loaf to make a delicious grilled sandwich-was crusty, spicy, and perfect! Saved the other half for pizza dough.
Have also made 1/3 dough as a more reasonable size loaf, done right around 30 min.

The only change I made was to add 5 minutes to the cooking time for a total of 40, but other than that I made it exactly as written. It was delicious! Great texture, moist and thick but not dense. Sliced it thin like sandwich bread and it held up perfectly.  Will definitely make it again.

I have made this recipe several times. Each time it turns out wonderful. My family loves this bread so it is my go to recipe for most things. Makes wonderful hoagie buns. Perfect texture and does not fall apart when used as sandwich bread. I have even made it without the herbs and turned out great

This bread is amazing and SO easy. I didn't have Romano cheese but did have parmesan cheese and I didn't have bread flour but had All Purpose so that is what I use and it made a very tasty and soft bread.  The crust is just a little crusty.   This recipe definitely a keeper and will be a go to when I have spaghetti and/or lasagna.  I will also have to use it for pizza.

This bread is amazing! I used my bread machine to make the dough, then baked it at 350 for about 35 minutes. I also added rosemary and left out the garlic powder, and subed the romano with parmesan and it's so soft and flavorful!

This is great the way it is but it's a great recipe to play around with. I've also made it with substitute spices for variety. Tonight I made half the recipe and substituted the Italian spices with extra onion powder, smoked paprika, chili powder, mixed seasoning and garlic and added  1/4 cup chopped onion and a cup of Monterey Jack cheese. Mixed it in my mixer with the dough hook and cooked 4 small loaves in my stoneware bread pan. Shared one of the loaves fresh out of the oven tonight with some guests and the four of us gobbled up the whole thing. It was delicious!

Am making it again today. Like others, I halved the recipe. I cooked it at 350 (convection oven) for 35 minutes then turned the oven off and let it continue cooking for another 10. PERFECT!

Very delicious! Only used 5 cups of flour and saved the last cup for working the dough and still had flour left over. I also used 2tbs of Italian seasoning and it turned out great. Will definitely make this again!

Good bread.  Made changes that really didn't change the recipe just my preference.  Less salt, sugar, and basil.  Used asiago cheese instead of romano because I had that on hand.  Will make again

Right away I need to mention that I left out the cheese, but it didn't need it. This was a great recipe on its own! The crust was just the perfect amount of crunch and the inside was so moist. And wow, was it easy to make! TERRIFIC recipe.

This was delicious! I made this recipe almost exactly as written, and it made 2 gorgeous loaves. The only changes I made were cutting back on the salt to 2 teaspoons and using 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning in place of the 1 tbsp basil/1 tbsp oregano. My husband said this was the best Italian bread he's ever had!

WOW!!This was really good, full of flavors,easy to make, and inexpensive. I wanted to have pizza for dinner, but don't like the

I made this with my KA dough hook.  I did have to add about 1/4 c more water as it was even too stiff for the KA to handle. So easy!  Formed 2 big Italian style loaves.  Lovely slicing texture when cooled.  This is a keeper.  Did bake it for 40 minutes until the loaves sounded hollow when tapped. Thank you for a wonderful bread!

This should be called Easy Italian Herb Bread.  It came together so easily!  I measure my flour by weight and figure 4-1/2 ounces per cup.  Since I started weighing the flour used in my yeast breads, they come together so much better, no fussing with too much or too little flour.  I made a dozen rolls today instead of loaves.  For just two of us, I can freeze what I can't use immediately.  This bread is far from bland, as a couple reviewers have stated.  Maybe they reviewed the wrong recipe.  Someone else said they left out the powdered milk.  This recipe doesn't call for it in the first place.  So make sure you are reviewing the correct recipe, before you knock it.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  Look forward to making it for company as toasted garlic bread slices, yumm!

I cut this to 16 servings and made it in the breadmaker on the dough cycle. I then divided into two portions and made two cylindrical loaves (made cuts every two inches to help it cook in the middle.) Let it rise for about 20 minutes and Baked at 350 for 25-30 minutes. Delicious! Also made a tasty chicken sandwich the next day :-) trying as pizza tonight!

I omitted the cheese because of a dairy allergy and this bread was delicious! It cooked perfectly in the time stated on a dark non stick cookie sheet in two long loaves twisted.

Overall, I liked this bread.  In the future, I would cook it longer as 35 minutes left it slightly under-cooked.  I do have an old and temperamental oven though.  It was a bit bland on its own but very easily paired with other things.  I would love to use this as pizza dough as others have suggested!

I cut the recipe in half and used parmesan. I like to wipe the outside with milk to keep the outside from being too crunchy, but that's a personal taste. My husband especially loves this. There's never any leftovers so I have no idea how this tastes the next day!

This bread is fantastic!  As per other reviewer's suggestions, I added more seasoning and parmesan.  I did have to add more water (approx. a tablespoon).  Will make this often!

Dynamite recipe for Italian bread.  I doubled the spices and baked for 40 minutes and both loaves were perfect.  The flavor was rich and will compliment the baked ziti I am serving tomorrow night.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome recipe! I make this all the time and have been playing with all of the possibilities of just tweaking the herbs. I usually add a little more garlic and onion powder (up to 1 Tbsp each) because I love the garlic-y taste. Also, you can use 2 Tbsp Italian Seasoning instead of 1 Tbsp of basil and oregano to give it a richer flavor. For something 'different', Herbes de Provence works well, or try making it with Tuscan seasoning (just make sure to let the sun-dried tomatoes sit in the olive oil first). There is so much you can do with this recipe with just a few tweaks, but the original is delicious and inspiring!

This recipe is excellent. I am making it for the third time right now. This time, I experimented a little and added a bit of sour dough starter to see how it blends with the other flavors. I've been using fresh herbs from my garden (Thyme, Oregano, Basil) and instead of onion powder I substituted chopped shallots. So far, we've devoured every loaf rather quickly. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This bread came out FANTASTIC!!  It was light and airy, smelled sooooo good.  I didn't have romano on hand so I used some fresh grated parmesean instead and it was great. It didn't seem to rise quite as fast as the directions indicated, so I let it go for an extra 30 mins (1 hour total) once I got it into the loaf pans and they did nicely. This is only my 2nd time making a yeast-based break and I am so impressed with the outcome!

This was an awesome recipe!  I cut the recipe in half and made it in my bread machine as well as baking it in the oven and it came out fabulously both ways.

Fabulous! I substituted all-purpose flour and parmesan cheese since I didn't have bread flour and Romano cheese. This bread was moist and chewy -- we plan to try it as pizza dough this week! So easy.

this bread was sooooo good!! I made it for a group of friends I entertained for a dinner party. I made italian food so it was perfectly fitting. Even though I was not hungry when I made it, I wanted to eat it all right then!! My house smelled like a pizzeria. I am going to make this again!! It was easy to make, too.

Delicious, delicious, delicious!  Fun to make 'cause it smells so good, and even more fun to eat!  This recipe makes two loaves; I put one in the freezer and gave it away the next day.  The loaf we kept stayed fresh and yummy all week.  I highly recommend this if you like good bread.

Absolutely delicious and a hit with all who have eaten it here. My only suggestion is to keep some water beside you as you knead the dough... for me, it needed just a tablespoon or so more to make it the right consistency. Bravo!

This was delicious with a great texture.  Be sure to use fresh yeast for best results.  Next time I will add some rosemary.

I wasn't crazy about this bread.  I thought the cheese flavor was overwhelming.  The bread itself wasn't very good, but the croutons I made from it were outstanding.

Great recipe.  I divided recipe in 1/2 and only had to use about 2 1/4 cups of flour.  Smelled wonderful baking and hubby wants his next pizza made with this dough.  Thanks for sharing Ann.

I love this recipe- it is by far the best I have made on allrecipes..The crust is perfect.  The only thing that could have been better was my own mixer!!!  The sunbeam mixmaster leaves alot of room for improvement mixing dough!!

YUM! So I didn't have garlic or onion powder, so I omitted those ingredients.  I used fresh minced garlic instead, and brushed the tops with rosemary and olive oil before putting them in the oven, and my whole house just smelled wonderful!  The bf and brother loved it with a little pat of butter on it.  Very good - very dense, though, next time I'm going to try to find a way to make it less of a dense bread.  Great flavor though and very easy :)

This recipe was so easy and turned out terrific. My husband, teenager, 3-year-old, and 1-year-old all loved it! How often does that happen?!?! The only change I made was to use All Purpose flour since I had no Bread flour on hand. I made one loaf in a loaf pan (baked 45 min) and I divided up the remaining dough to make 4 oversized hamburger buns (baked 25 min). YUM! I can't wait to try it for pizza dough.

I made my own bread for the first time with this recipe, thanks.  Instead of bread flour, I just used all-purpose organic whole wheat flour.  I only used 4 cups of flour, because it seemed to be the right consistency (at least from my experience with those pizza kits:)).  And I used parmesan cheese instead.  It actually turned out great, and am going to make this quite often.  It was much denser than your normal $.79 loaf, but I liked it very much.

This was an ok recipe. It calls for so much flour and oil, yet not enough herbs. The flavor was a bit bland and the bread got stale very fast, even inside a bread tupperware. I might use fresh garlic and onions next time, if I were to attempt a modified version of this recipe.

Wow! This is the best bread I have ever made. It was perfect -- texture and flavor. It smelled awesome while rising/cooking. A fresh slice doesn't even need any butter. I did use well rounded spoonfuls of all the spices, but then again I always read herbs and spices as "to taste" whether a recipe says so or not. 

I plan to make this bread often. I'm making my own sandwich bread now and while the distinctive flavor won't work with every type of sandwich, when it does work it works well.

Delicious and fragrant. Dough was a smidge difficult to work with, had to scrap my plan for a braided loaf in favour of a round, but tasted good enough to forgive it and then some!

This recipe came out very well, however, we just didn't care for it. I had company for dinner, one person said they liked it, one said it tasted like baking powder, the rest said it was just okay. It was an easy recipe to make. The only change I made was to use 2 tsp. of salt instead of a Tablespoon. I also found I only needed to use 5 1/4 cups of flour. Sorry, but I will not be making this again. I think my dinner group is used to some of the other homemade bread recipes I make and this one just didn't compare.

Halved the recipe- may have been too much flour, as it came out a bit dry. I had hoped the crust would brown a bit but it did not; maybe try brushing with oil towards end of bake time on next attempt. Tasted great in grilled cheese next day.

Yum yum yum .... My house smelled like heaven !!!!
I skipped the cheese,onion powder, used dried herbs(did not have any i wanted to try it so bad), fresh garlic.
Very nice ...and stayed soft the next day (i have had problems bread fealing very dry up next day).
We could eat this bread just like that or with butter ...
Thanks for the recipe ...i will be trying this with whole wheat and other herbs tooo

This was my first time making homemade bread ever. I was surprised by how easy this recipe was (despite the manual labor of stirring in the 6 cups of flour). It came out sooooooo good and smelled incredible! I will definitely make this again.

This smelled so good when I was mixing it up and then the baking... ahhhh... the baking - divine!  It tasted great too, a nice moist interior with tons of flavor.  I used shredded parm, because it was what I had.  Thanks!

This bread came out great.  you can add whatever spices you prefer, and it will still come out great.  The only important thing is to make sure that when you're shaping the loaves, not to kneed the bread too much.  Just touch it enough to make it the right shape and leave it alone.

Delicious!  I didn't get all of the flour mixed in, but it didn't seem to matter a bit.  I served with a hearty soup.  Thanks for sharing!

This bread was incredible!  My three boys all high school football players ate both huge loaves right out of the oven.  Was easy to make followed recipe exactly which is unusual for me and was simple and great tasting. Especially with that oil and vinegar dip that was suggused by a few others.

The bread was delicious.  It's hard to mix all the flour in...I only got in five cups mixing by hand.  But it turned out great.  Yummy!

This was okay. My three year old bread-aholic didn't like it. I don't know what I did wrong, probably will not make again.

Great recipe!  I didn't have any basil (fresh or dried) and substituted fresh rosemary and it was wonderful!!  Rave reviews from the neighbors, too.  Baked for the exact amount of time (35 min) in Pampered Chef pan and the loaf was a beautiful color and texture was soft.  Will definitely make again!

I don't know if i did something wrong or if i just have weird taste but this recipe really didn't do it for me.  I should probably note that this was my first loaf of bread, but it was dense and crumbly, and it didn't really get crusty at all.  With that said i should probably note that everyone else who tried it loved it, my friend told me it wass the best bread she has ever had and ate half the loaf, and my mom who hates chese gobbled it up.

I liked this bread; it turned out light and springy. It was easy to make as well. I think it could have used even more herbs and parm, however.

Pretty good.  The bread rose really well.  I used it as a pizza crust, which worked very well, although maybe the sauce and cheese overtook the bread flavors, i dunno, becuase it didnt seem much different than a regular pizza crust.  But very crunchy crust, chewy inside.

I made this in my bread machine, so I cut the ingrediants in half.  I thought it was very salty (and I love salt), so I would caught the amount even further next time.  I would try this again if I make bread sticks.

This bread is wonderful. It was easily divided in half and the bread machine did all the work for me. I didn't have Romano cheese but grated Parmesan worked fine. Made the whole house smell like an Italian bakery. Left over slices make really tasty sandwiches, with Provolone and roast beef.

Good change of pace from basic rolls for dinner. Used parmesan cheese as could not find romano cheese at the store. Does take a while for kneading but results are worth it. My loaves turned out soft, dense, aromatic and delicious without a crunchy crust.

Made the recipe for a carbo-loading spaghetti dinner...quick, very aromatic, and it really hit the spot.  What an INCREDIBLE bread.  Hardly needs butter...so good just plain.
