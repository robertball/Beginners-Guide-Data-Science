This was delicious; it's an excellent dish to serve at a dinner party.  It's elegant, but not really that hard to make.  I will say that the amount of flour called for is WAY too much....I made it as the recipe directed, and it was not a sauce--it was paste.  So I tossed out half of it, and then added more half & half and some milk when I ran out of that.  I think 3-4 Tbsp. would have been pleny, and you could decrease the butter.  Also needs plenty of salt and pepper.   Other than that, spectacular!

This recipe is very tasty. I lightened it up quite a bit by using fat free half and half and reduced fat butter. I also had to use the full amount of the flour, even though I tried to get by with less, based on what some other reviewers posted. Maybe it was because of the reduced fat ingredients I used needing a bit more bulk. Since I had some mixed color bell pepper strips to use up, I sauteed those along with the mushrooms, and threw in some frozen onion bits for good measure, too. I omitted the artichokes, although I will probably use them next time. We're not crazy about rosemary, so that got left out, too. 
I have to disagree with the poster who said this recipe was easy.  Or, maybe my definition of easy is different. But a recipe that requires the vegetables to be cooked first, then the chicken, then a sauce made separately, then the whole thing baked isn't my idea of "instant". However, I didn't mind too much, because the dish tasted good and it was my day off, so I had the time to devote to this recipe. However, this isn't a dish I'd be able to whip up on most days after work. I served it over egg noodles with steamed asparagus on the side. A really delicious meal. I will make this one again.

This is a delicious chicken recipe that my husband loved!  I'm always looking for chicken recipes that aren't boring and this one for sure is a keeper.  I sauteed 1 clove garlic and half an onion in 1 tbsp butter, 1 tbsp olive oil.  I added the 8oz of chopped mushrooms to this.  Instead of just topping the dish with the mushrooms, I mixed in my garlic, onion, mushroom mixture to the cream sauce and then poured it over the chicken.  I left out the artichokes as well.  The result was a wonderful flavor and a happy family.  Thanks Christine!!

My family enjoyed this! I used 3 boneless chicken breast and cubed them. Did all in a skillet,no baking. First cooked mushrooms. Removed and cooked chicken chunks for about 5-7 min. Used 1 (14 oz) can broth.There is approximately 1 1/2  cups in can,so that is what I used. Removed chicken to the same bowl as mushrooms.I used all the broth to make my sauce. I used about 1/4 cup flour and mixed it with a little half and half. Bring broth to boil and slowly add flour until desired thickness. I'm not really fond of rosemary so I used thyme leaves in it's place. Once I got sauce ingredients together,I added chiken,mushrooms and artichokes. Cooked to heat through. Make sure you use a non stick pan or else it will stick with all that yummy cheese in it. I served it over linguine pasta. It was so good! The sauce is great! Thanks Christine for sharing this with all of us!

What a great starter recipe!! From others reviews, I added 4 cloves fresh minced garlic, which added wonderful flavor, along with chopped sundried tomatoes, garlic salt, and fresh crushed rosemary.  Also substituted 3/4 c milk for some of the half n half and the result was still creamy and delicious.  Used boneless skinless chicken breasts and served with angel hair pasta.  Delicious!

This was good, but only after I changed it around a little.  The recipe calls for WAY too much butter and flour for the roux - 2 T each would be sufficient.  Also, I would scale the sauce back a bit, it makes a TON.  I didn't poach my chicken, yuck, instead sauted it in butter/oil, removed from pan and tented, then cooked mushrooms, etc. in the same pan (w/some onion), then added butter, flour, chicken stock, half & half artichokes, etc. right to the sauce.  Instead of baking the chicken, which would overcook it, I finished it in the skillet.  Much easier and yummy.

This was good.  The only thing we did not like were the mushrooms.  Personal preference for us...they weren't great with the cream sauce and artichokes.  Will make again, but omit those. oh and, please do reduce the flour...way too much as written.  Thanks for the post.

The sauce was great but this recipe seems unnecessarily complicated - why do you cook the chicken twice?! I'll make it again, but I'll make the sauce first and then put it over the raw chicken, mushrooms, artichokes, etc. in the baking dish and bake it altogether.

Largely, this was very good.  In my opinion, this dish is so decadently rich, it's a special occasion meal, not an every night dish.  Also, it takes a little bit longer to make, so another reason to save for company.  Thought the sauce could have used a little garlic flavor.  I thought the artichokes were an inspired addition, since the flavor of them cuts the richness of the sauce somewhat.  And I don't know what happened, but my sauce absorbed 4 cups of liquid...2 of half and half and 2 of broth, before it was the right consistency...as you can imagine, it made a LOT of sauce.  Probably shouldn't have poured it all in with the chicken...it was a bit too much.  We had this with wild rice, which turned out to be a great combo.  Will make again, but if my sauce acts the same way next time, I'll probably only pour half of it on the chicken and hold back the rest to serve over fettucini.  Thanks!

I suggest for the sauce, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, 4 tablespoons flour, 1/2 teaspoon rosemary, and add 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder.

Yummie is all I can say about this recipe. It was so good!! Instead of the artichoke hearts I made fresh green beans and potatoes and I used the cheese sauce over them also. Boy was it a hit with my husband. I also used skim milk which was probably just as good as half and half. Excellent meal and quick !!

Excellent recipe, Christine!  I added a little onion and garlic at the beginning, but left everything else alone.  DH raved about it and I will happily make it again!  I found it interesting that some reviewers said that the sauce was perfect while some took off stars because it was too thick.  If you thought the sauce was too thick, it tells me that you are not measuring the flour properly.  A good roux/sauce starts with equal parts flour and fat, which is what Christine calls for.  To meausure flour, spoon LIGHTLY into the measuring cup and then level it off gently, without tamping down the flour.  This is what I did and the thickness of the sauce was perfect.  Good job, Christine!

This is great comfort food.
I used skim milk instead of half and half. I also used shredded jack cheese,which is what I had on hand.

This recipe is an awful lot of work and came out just "ok".  I cut the flour down to 2-3 T. and it was still very thick.  I might try again. Just don't know right know.

I agree, this chicken was very good.  I didn't find that the sauce was to thick as a previous review had mentioned.  It came out fine to us, we loved it and will make this again often.  Very easy and quick!!

This is a cumbersome and not a very efficient recipe.  I felt that it was very heavy on the rosemary, since it tended to overpower the other flavors.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used only 2 tbsps of flour.  The sauce was ok, but this is a very "mediocre chicken dinner."

My family and I loved this recipe! The only change I made to it was instead of using all 1/2 and 1/2, I just put in a 1/2 a cup of it and 1 cup of 1% milk. It made a nice sauce...not too thick.

The subtitle to this recipe should be "Chicken Alfredo" because that's really all it is. It was good, but nothing outstanding. The only addition I made was some minced garlic. I followed other reviews and didn't cook the chicken twice- I just made the sauce and dumped it over the chicken and baked for 45 minutes. I served over fettucine.

Made it again, cut down on butter, flour, used half skim and half half and half which I guess is equal to whole milk.  Also added garlic and onion to the original mushroom mixture and it is even better this time around!!  : )

This was very good, I made it with a whole cut up chicken. The only changes that I made was to brown the chicken prior to adding the broth. I also cut back on the half and half, using more broth in its place. I did this in an attempt to cut back on some of the calories. The sauce was still creamy and good. Will make again.

This was very good!  Definitely calls for too much flour, which I also didn't read before making it. Luckily I started out with only about 3 tablespoons of flour and that was still too much but manageable by adding more broth than called for.  I only had that yucky canned parmesan and it was still good.  Can't wait to try it with the good cheese.  Also subsituted saute'd, chopped onions for the artichokes.

I'm not sure that I could call this recipe Outstanding Chicken Dinner.  Overall, I was disappointed.  I thought the combination of flavors of the ingredients would be tasty.  Although the flavor wasn't bad, there was way to much sauce, actually I would probably term it paste for the chicken.  I had a  hard time finding the chicken underneath all the sauce.  The recipe suggests  to let the chicken set for a few minutes before serving so the sauce could thicken.  My sauce had the consistency of thick pancake batter.  I added an additional 1/4 cup chicken broth in the preparation of the sauce, but it was still too thick to my liking. I would suggest reducing the amount of butter and flour to 1/4 cup instead.

Wow, this sauce is amazing! I loved the flavor of the rosemary.  I decreased the flour to 1/4 cup and it was still too much - I had to thin the sauce out with more of the chicken broth. Other than that, this is definately an "outstanding" chicken recipe!  Thanks!

I didn't have any rosemary or parmesan. Instead I used 4oz of cheddar, 3oz of grugere cheese, 2 chopped garlic cloves and 1 T of accent. Turned out great!

This was a good meal....something different and my husband loved.  I think kids would like the sauce as well, although I couldn't get my 8 year old to try it.  First, you do have to modify.  I used FAT FREE half and half (I sent my husband to the store...need you ask?) Anyhow, what I thought would be an oops....turned out to be GREAT.  (And less FAT!).  I also saved a cup or more of the chicken broth and stirred in more than the 1/2 cup recommended.  I think it is an error in the recipe.  I think you either have to use 1/2 the flour or add more chicken broth to get the right consistency.  I would make it again...

Although my fiance loved this (minus the artichoke part) I thought it was just ok.  The sauce was a little bland for my taste.  Maybe adding fresh minced garlic would help. Will probably make again but add more flavor somehow.

Wow!  This is a great recipe.  I have a very picky family (4 kids and a picky husband) and they all liked it.  My husband is not crazy about new recipes but seemed to enjoy this as he scooped out seconds!  I will make it again but next time I will chop the artichoke into very tiny pieces.  It's an important flavor in the recipe but can be overpowering if you get too BIG a bite of artichoke.  Thanks for this recipe!

I should have read the reviews first. But, it ended up delicious. I just browned boneless chicken breasts then made sauce using MORE chicken broth plus a little juice from artichokes.
I poured sauce over breasts, COVERED, and baked in oven about 20 minutes at 350 to finish cooking chicken. I served with brown rice... my husband and 22 month old ate it up! Very good recipe with some alterations.

This was a wonderful recipe and quite delicious. It does take a little longer to prepare than noted. But I will make it over and over again. Just be sure and have all your ingredients measured out before hand. You don't have time to do it while you are making the sauce.

Almost 4 starts. I didn't measure out anything and I left out the mushrooms. The sauce is AMAZING, almost wanted to drink it! The chicken was just good, lacked the flavor to pair up with the sauce. I used lots of seasoning and will have to do something more with the chicken next time. If you can find a way to a way to flavor the chicken more this would be 5 stars. Thank you for sharing, will use this idea and make it more my own.

Very tasty sauce, but I have to agree with previous reviewers about the flour!  WAY too much...turned sauce a little "pasty"!  Didn't affect the taste though!  I also sauteed some chopped garlic with the mushrooms for an added "zip"!  Will definitely try again as my hubby loved it!

Yummy!  My husband and I both enjoyed this.  As other reviewers have noted, there's way too much flour.  I used about 3/4 the recipe amount, later thinned with extra milk, and it still ended up as more of a paste than a sauce.  But, the taste was phenomenal so I'm not complaining too much!  I doubled the mushroom amount, and that ended up being my favorite part.  Thanks!

Excellent flavor, but I also make a few changes as per other reviewers - I cut the butter and flour amounts in half, eliminated the salt (as the chicken broth was salty enough).  We love articoke hearts and really enjoyed the taste of the recipe, and the leftovers were just as good the next day reheated.

VERY Bland, the sauce was to thick, had a weird consistancy. Its a lot of work,and ingredients and I ended up eating about 3 bites. The closest thing it tastes like is a bad alfredo. So if you try this, think chicken alfredo.My roommate didn't like it either.Also made penne pasta with it, it made tons of fattening sauce.

This was a great dinner. I did change it just a bit by sauteing the mushrooms in the butter and adding some olive oil (1TBS), some white wine (1/4C) and 2 garlic cloves (chopped). I used sliced mushrooms instead of chopped so it looked really pretty when it was done. Also, after the chicken was done cooking in the broth, I sliced it, then put it in the baking dish along with the chopped artichokes, cream sauce and mushrooms. Topped it with some freshly ground black pepper and Tony's  cajun seasoning. Very delicious!

This recipe is GREAT, we got tired of the same ole chicken and tried this. It was wonderful!!!The sauce did tend to get just a touch thick, so I added alittle bit of the left over broth. Also added garlic salt instead of the regular salt, omitted the artichokes, rosemary, and sub. the half and half with 2% milk instead.  This is diffently a keeper for this family. THANKS AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!

Great recipe. Although a little thick, the cream sauce has a really fantastic.  Next time I will add a little more chicken broth!
But, this is going to become one of my favorite recipes.

This chicken dinner was a huge hit with my dinner guests last night. It was inexpensive and relatively easy to make but left a very classy impression. It went well with fresh steamed green beans and a ceasar salad. The sauce was excellent but be careful with the artichokes I would omit them.

Like another reviewer said, this dish calls for WAY too much rosemary.  It's all I could taste!  It's not that the dish was bad... I really enjoyed the sauce with the artichokes, except that it may have been a little too greasy. The most important thing is just to lay off the rosemary.  Also, I can't explain it, but this recipe just leaves something to be desired.  It could use some tweaking and polishing here and there.  Wish I could figure out what it needs!

Too much time with little reward.  The sauce was way too thick.  Not sure if this was how it was supposed to be or not...I did use reduced-fat butter in an attempt to cut down on the enormous amount of fat and calories in this recipe.  Maybe that was the reason.  If not, I would cut down on the flour, but I will not be making this recipe again.

This recipe was OUTSTANDING!! We LOVED it.  I cut the recipe in half and found that I had more than enough sauce.  I unfortunately did not have artichokes on hand, so I used small whole onions. It was a very nice substitution. I also used alittle more rosemary than what was called for (in the suggestion of the other reviewers).  I also like to use seasoned pepper instead of ground pepper in dishes like this.  It was wonderful over pasta but would not hesitate to put over rice.  YUM!

I give this 4 stars because there is room for improvement. First, I would saute the chicken in a pan rather than simmer it in the broth. Second, WAY TOO MUCH flour is called for. You can use 3-4 tbsp. and it would be fine. I made this with rosemary, just as it called for, but next time I think I am going to use Thyme to see how that would taste. I used more than 1/2 c. chicken broth, I probably used a whole can and just 1 cup of half and half. But you should make it to your desired thickness. I served the chicken over linguine and it was delicious. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I also used fat-free half and half and 'I Cant Believe Its Not Butter' and, if you do that, you should cut down on the amount of butter used.  It was delicious!  All I added was a little garlic powder and paprika.  My wife wants this added to my recipe collection.

This was WONDERFUL!  My husband and son absolutely loved it.  Will definitely make again, but next time I will pan-fry chicken instead of cooking in the stock as I've found the chicken comes out better that way.

Really couldn't decide what to rate this recipe.  Wish I had read the reviews before I made it. There is WAY TOO MUCH flour called for.  Made a horrible paste....could have used as glue. Wasted a carton of half and half. Started over again with 4 tablespoons of flour and it was delicious.  BE CAREFUL.  Also sprinkled a little garlic powder on chicken, and on mushrooms.  Gave it just the right bite.

This is an amazing recipe! I did notice it called for a bit too much butter and flour, but I still made it as-is, it just gave me enough of the incredible sauce to make a batch of ziti noodles and pour it over top them. I only omitted the artichokes because I didn't have them, but would have added them if I did. My entire family loved it! It is the sauce that makes it all! We will make this again and again. I have also sent the recipe to my mother and sisters.

This was a dish my husband and I really enjoyed. The only thing I altered was instead of rosemary I used fresh thyme. I served it on bowtie pasta and was delicious.

This was not "Outstanding" in my opinion. Although the flavor was good I was disappointed with the outcome of this recipe. Firstly, you don't need chicken breast on the bone, chunked would have been better, and the sauce was very gloppy. I did follow the instructions as written.

Good recipe; but, again, way too much flour.  When finished it was a thick paste that wouldn't pour.  Perhaps I added flour too slowly at a medium low temperature.  So keep the broth in case you need to thin out your sauce.   Overall, the chicken was tender, the flavor was good, preparation easy.

WOW! I make this all of the time and never get sick of it! The first time I made it, I had no mushrooms-so I substituted with fresh sundried tomatoes. Also, keep the discarded broth until you're done cooking. I find that I need to add some to thin out the sauce. But all in all, it's great. I thought making it for company would be risky, but I did anyway...and they loved it too!

Really good flavor. I only used a tablespoon of flour and it still was too thick. Also, the sauce separated very fast and I ended up with a lot of oil on the bottom of the pan when I took it out of the oven. It wasn't very appetizing. But it did taste good still.

First of all, WAY too much flour for that amount of liquid.  It formed a paste and I had to add more chicken broth and half and half to thin it out.  Next time I would add only 1/4 cup of butter and only a few tablespoons of flour.  Second, when I tasted the sauce before putting it over the chicken, it was BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.  I added more rosemary, plus some garlic powder, thyme, and cayenne pepper.  I thought the sauce turned out pretty good with these modifications, but the majority of the flavor came from the crimini mushrooms and artichoke hearts.  My husband thought that the chicken was so bland that it made the whole dish bland.  Next time I would saute the chicken in some spices instead of braising it in the chicken broth.

Wonderful dinner that impresses anyone who enters my house.  NEVER FAILS.  I use fat free half/half to reduce those delicious calories! Thanks for the oustanding recipe.

Pretty good. I didnt use any artichokes. I only had 3 chicken breasts and so I used half the amount of flour and butter to make the roux. Next time I'll use less flour, my sauce was VERY thick, I had to thin it out.

Deicious recipe.  I omitted the mushrooms since my husband and I don't care for them and I mistakenly put too many artichoke pieces (jar was more than I realized) but we still enjoyed it.  Next though, I will make sure I put the right amount of artichokes as they did start to get a little overwhelming after the first few bites.  Yum!

This was a big hit with my family. I omitted the artichokes. Added fresh mushrooms with garlic and onion as other reviewers suggested. Used 1% milk and 1/4 cup flour instead of 1/2 cup. Definitely a keeper!

This was very good, but rich.  I used 2% milk instead of the half&half and cut down on the butter slightly.  I also used shredded parmesan cheese and canned mushrooms.  I love articoke hearts, so I put in the whole can.  

The sauce is excellent - I served with brown rice and got rave reviews from the hubby.  Looks like this recipe is a keeper!

I'd give it 6 stars.  Made a few adjustments.  I don't care for artichokes, so I left them out.  I had 4 leg quarters in the freezer, so that's what I used.  Simmered the Q's until done and deboned them.  I added 16 oz of sliced mushrooms sauted in butter.  Put the shrooms and chicken in a casserole dish.  Made the cream sauce.  I used a lot more than 1 1/2C of half and half.  Plus some of the chix broth from the boiled chix to thin the sauce to the proper consistency.  The dish got rave reviews from the family.  Will certainly make this dish again and again.

I thought this was a great foundational recipe that could be modified to taste. I added bacon in with the mushrooms and sauted them in white wine and it was wonderful! Great recipe.

I was not impressed with this recipe at all.  The "sauce" had TOO MUCH flour in it, so it became too thick and looked like runny dough before it's cooked.  The flavors never blended well, and in the end it was just a mess all around.

The chicken was way too dry. Cooking it twice doesn't make much sense.   Sauce was alright but too thick.  I think I'll stick to my alfredo recipe and add the mushrooms and artichokes to it.

This was great.  My husband asked me to fix this often after I served it for dinner the first time.  He loved it, and so did my 2 year old.  Be sure to reserve more broth than called for in the recipe.  You'll need at least a whole cup, if not more; it is very thick with all that flour.  I made this for a last minute dinner party and everyone raved.  I love recipes that make me look good in the kitchen!!!

This was delicious! Even my children loved it!  I also only used 3Tbs. of flour.  I used 2cups 1/2 and 1/2 and 1/2 cup broth.  I sauted the chicken in butter and then cut into pieces and served the dish over pasta!

Talk about a crowd pleaser!  I have 5 children under 13 and usually someone goes hungry because of pickiness. This recipe had everyone asking for seconds! I actually used leftover baked chicken breasts and sliced them about 1 inch thick.  It made it very easy to have 3 chicken breasts feed 7 people, with leftovers!  This is definitely a new family favorite.

Very disappointing!  I had read the warnings about too much flour, but decided to follow the recipe exactly for the first attempt.  "Boiled chicken in a bland cream paste" is the most accurate description.  Add brandy, wine, herbs, anything to add flavor and PLEASE cut the flour!!

Agree with others, too much butter/flour for roux. I omitted the artichokes and mushrooms (picky husband) and it was delicious! Almost an alfredo sauce.

I had to make a few adjustments to this recipe since I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used a little onion instead of mushrooms.  I didn't have half and half so I used a little cream cheese and milk instead.   I also substituted fresh broccoli for artichokes.  I think the mushrooms and artichokes would have been awesome.   Despite the substitutions it was still good.  My biggest critique would be that it was way too much flour and butter for the sauce.   I had to add more chicken broth, water, and milk to get it to even a gravy consistency.  I would probably half that amount for next time.  Very tasty dish though, I loved the method of cooking the chicken, it was flavorful and moist.

This was delightfully different and the sauce is delicious.  Even my husband ,who is in a  recipe competion with with me, gobbled this up.  I had a lot of sauce left over and mixed it up with some green beans and froze it for what we know will be a nice future green bean casserole side dish.  For those worried that the sauce is too thick...don't worry!!  It is a bit pasty, but once it bakes it becomes a very nice gravy.  If you add more liquid or use a lot less flour, it will be a pool of liquidy gravy on your plate, running into your side dishes.  A can of mushroom soup is thick too, and we've all probably used it and found it to liquify upon baking.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's been added to our menu cycle and I would definitely serve it to guests.

Well, one must keep in mind when following a new recipe, it always seems to take double the amount of time. Next time around will be a little faster.
I must agree that for some reason the sauce became too thick too fast (and I know how to measure 1/2 cup of flour!!). I just kept adding more of the left over broth and some milk. I even added 1/4 cup of white wine when cooking the mushrooms (and other veggies that I chose to add to the recipe)! The sauce was nice and smooth when I poured it over the chicken but thickened some more during cooking in the oven that by the time I served it over rice, it was a little too thick.

The taste was amazing but I would add even more liquids next time around!

This is basically baked chicken al fredo, with rosemary.  I used broccoli instead of artichokes as I didn't have any, and it was good, the family liked it, but I found it not up to it's promise.  I thought it would be a different and yummy chicken dinner.  I could have just made fettuccine al fredo with chicken and had basically the same thing.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I did do a few things different, I did not add mushrooms.  I browned the chicken breasts in butter and then added 4 cloves garlic minced.  Poured the chicken broth over the chicken covered and let simmer for 20 min. I removed the chicken and placed in casserole dish and placed artichoke hearts on top and set aside. I then added the half and half cream, rosemary, salt and pepper and parmesan to the broth in the pan, cooked for 5 mins and then poured it over the chicken and artichokes in the casserole.  Covered and placed in 425 oven for a half hour.  I served over egg noodles and had a baguette for dipping.  It was delicious.  I chose not to add the flour at all due to the other reviews.  It was a runnier consistency but fabulous with the noodles and bread.  I will definetly make this again!!!!!

Sauce was way too thick. There must have been a typo in there somewhere, like 1 1/2 cups chicken broth. I added 2 cups half and half and more chicken broth and the sauce was still paste. Flavor was ok but chicken was tough after being cooked too long. I definitely would not waste all those expensive ingredients again.

This recipe is AMAZING! I make it every year now for Christmas Eve for my in-laws. As other reviewers have stated, there is a lot of extra sauce left over. I have found that it works wonders the next day over some pasta noodles. My husband raves to family and friends about this recipe. I use fat free half and half to cut down on the fat and not as much butter to saute the mushrooms. All in all a wonderful recipe that I will continue using!

Thanks for the great recipe! Wow!  I have not tasted a sause like that in a long time.  My husband said,  "cant we just eat the sause!"  I ended up adding the extra 1/2 cup of  broth back in, along with extra half and half and 1/4 more of flower to balance out the extra liquid I put in.  I also added extra parmesan and about 1/2 teaspoon of Garlic power!

definitely an outstanding recipe!  I edited it by using 3/4 stick butter, 1/4 cup of flour and 3/4 cup of parm cheese and it seemed just thick enough.  I also added some chicken seasoning to the sauce (just a dash).  This is the first meal I have ever made that my boyfriend has said "wow" after tasting! I served with Parmesan garlic asparagus and mashed potatoes

This is an awesome recipe!  Even my kids like it.  I have baan known to alter my recipes, with this one when I dont have enough chicken breasts for everyone, I cube them up and put them in the sauce and then cover a baked crescent roll crust with it, then bake it for a few minutes more.  I even took it cubed up in the sauce only in a crock pot to a family gathering and it was a huge success.  If you have picky eaters you could always puree the mushrooms and artichoke hearts and mix them is so no one knows they are there.

This recipe was pretty bad.  I followed the recipe exactly but substituted 2% milk for the half & half.  I thought this might make the sauce a little thinner but I was wrong.  The sauce tasted and looked like a pile of mashed potatoes on chicken.  The chicken was super chewy, I think from simmering in the Chicken stock for 20 min. and then baking for an additional 30 min.  The recipe states something about being much better than a traditional "can soup" sauce.  I strongly dissagree!  Campbells tastes a whole lot better than this sauce!

We thought it was too cheesey and not creamy at all. Maybe I did something wrong even though I followed the recipe. Will not make again.

This came together very quickly and I enjoyed the leftovers the next day. The sauce is pretty darn tasty. My husband and I felt like this was more of an artichoke chicken kind of dip because I cut up the chicken. Will make again.

This dish was overpowering and VERY greasy.  If I were to make it again, I would not use artichokes at all, and I would lessen the amount of butter and parmesan cheese.  All you could taste was the cheese, it was not very pleasant.

It was different but good. I did change alittle on the ing. didnt have any mushrooms so I used half can of mushroom soup,added onions,all the chicken broth was used to get it thinned out some. But it was missing something though-maybe I'll add some broccoli next time.

This was a very good recipie!  The only things I did different were, instead of mushrooms, I sauteed and added onions.  Then instead of just adding 1/2 cup of reserved broth, I added all of the broth.  Before you add your flour, make sure all your liquid ingredients are in first, to avoid "clumpy" gravy.  This dish was in fact easy to make, and my family really liked it.  Will definetly make again, Thanks!

I did a lot of altering with this recipe.  I used boneless chicken breasts and omitted the whole flour/butter mixture.  I added some cornstarch to the half & half to thicken it.  And I used fat free half & half.  My 2 year old really liked it!  We all thought it was good and I would make it again.

I am only rating this a 4 instead of 5 star because of the flour issue! other than that this was AMAZING!! I did add 1 tsp minced garlic to the mushrooms and 2 TBSP minced garlic to the sauce as well as the fact that I also just added it all to uncooked chicken and cut the flour to 1/4 cup.. ok other than all my changes, the basic recipe idea was GREAT! thanx!

This was a great recipe.  The sauce was very thick, but I added broth to thin it out.  Next time I will use a little less flour.  I also had to adjust the cook time, due to boneless breasts.  I also added EVOO, garlic and and a shallot to the mushrooms...the kids liked it too (minus the mushrooms)

I totally messed the sauce up and it was still really good. I did something wrong and the sauce was as thick as cookie dough. Unfortunately I didn't have any broth leftover to thin it out so I put it on top of the chicken anyway and it was still very good. I used skinless, bonless chick breasts.

Christine, I thought this recipe was good.  I made it last night and today my husband of 4 weeks asked me to make it again today.  I will keep this recipe.  It beats the canned mushroom soup.  He said it tastes a whole lot better.  My only problem was that the sauce was a bit thick.  I'll try the suggestions the others made, lessening the flour.

I thought this was rather bland. While simmering the chicken in the broth, it needs some seasoning.  Sauce needs spicing up a bit as well.

My husband loved this.  I left out the artichokes, made all the sauce the way it said and used it to spoon over rice. It was elegant!

Great receipe, easy to prepare, but heavy on the 
butter which made it even better.  The flavor was 
exquisite.  If you love artichokes, parameson you will love it.  Thank you! Great for company

This chicken was pretty good, but do reduce the flour/corn starch.  I used fat free half/half, so maybe I'll use the real stuff next time.  I was out of rosemary, and it definitely needed some zip, so I added thyme and it was delicious.  I'll make this again if I have the ingredients on hand, but won't rush to make it again.
