Wow, this was great pie!!  I used fresh strawberries and cherries (not sour cherries) - I sliced the berries and cherries and sprinkled them with sugar/lemon juice, stirred and let them sit for about 5 minutes.  I mixed the dry ingredients (tapioca, sugar, cornstarch & salt) with 3/4 cup of water and the juice from the berries, let it boil for 5 minutes, added the sliced fruit and boiled for another 2 mintues.  I used a "shortbread cookie" crust (like a graham cracker crust), no top crust and baked it at 350 F for 20 minutes.  My husband and kids were disappointed that there was only 1 pie and not 1 EACH!!!!

I decided to try this pie three weeks ago and have now made it three times for different holidays and potlucks.  I have brought home an empty pie dish each time.  I made it exactly as directed above and it is lovely.  The actual size of the canned cherries called for doesn't exist in my area - replacing with more berries works just fine.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving dessert and everyone passed on the pumpkin pie and went for the berry pie. They loved it and so did I. I used two can's of cherries and one bag of stawberries. It was wonderful...

This pie was great! I made it for a pie auction and it sold for $100.00! I also of coarse had to make one for myself too! YUMMY! My whole family went nuts over it! Thank-you for the recipe!

I thought this was going to be a great pie, but didn't turn out so good.  The filling reminded me of grape jelly.  Not sure why, followed the recipe exact. The pie set up nice and looked pretty with ths sugar on top of the crust.  The flavor and texture were weird though.

I made this recipe with frozen home-grown strawberries and cherries; it was great! Wait until it is cooled to eat or else it will be runny.

I really liked this pie. I'm a huge fan of cherry pie, but I've never really been a strawberry pie fan unlike my husband he goes nuts for strawberry pie. This was a nice pie because it wasn't as overly sweet as a strawberry pie is. Nice balance of flavors.

My family loves this pie! I've made it for them a couple times, and both times got rave reviews.  It's nice and sweet yet the cherries add a bit of sour at the same time.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Everyone liked this pie and it set up well; however, most people said they'd prefer strawberry or cherry rather than the mixed flavors.

Not bad, made it for a bbq, it was gobbled up. When I asked hubby what he thought of it, he said "good, definately enjoyed it, but not enough to ask you to make it again", so there you go...worth one time, but not a keeper

Terrific pie, I suggest for a healthier option to use 1/2 cup of Splenda and choose the cherries in water. I also added 1/4 cup of burgundy and strawberry puree into the mix and disregarded the tapioca. The pie falls apart when cut hot, but its absolutely delicious and hard to resist. Also pie making tip in general: brush the top of the crust with egg whites for that golden crust.

Try using frozen raspberries instead of the strawberries; this take the pie to a whole new level of "yum"!  Highly recommend this recipe for something different! And do be sure to use the sour cherries, not canned cherry pie filling- would be way to sweet.
