WOW - I LOVE THIS SOUP!  With a few small modifications:  I used 2 large leeks (white & green parts), 3 medium potatoes, and substituted one cup table cream in place of one cup chicken broth. I also added a little extra curry (personal taste) for more flavour.  Served it with a salad and got amazing kudos!!  Try replacing potatoes with butternut squash - just as fabulous!!

Very tasty and hearty.  A bowl of this and a hunk of bread and you have a delightfully flavorful and hearty meal.  Rather than tasting the combined flavors it is more like tasting the apple, leek and curry all at the same time...very neat!

You will need to experiment with the size of the 2 apples and 3 leeks...the balance of flavors is easily swayed based on not only the quantity but also the strength of the leek and the ripeness of the apple.  There is a lot of leeway before you go too far one way or the other, though: don't let it worry you but make a note if you think it goes too far one way or the other when you make it the first time.

Overall quite easy, very tasty and hearty!

This is an easy and fine recipe. Having said that, some folks found that it tasted like apple compote. I didn't... I thought it had a three tiered flavor, starting with apple, having leek in the middle and curry as a pleasant aftertaste. You could still taste the apples rawness with the suggested times, I'd probably cook them slightly longer next time...

A tasty, easy soup. I'd stick with non-fat yogurt for the garnish - lowfat was too thick and ended up clumpy. A bit more apple and/or more potato would be nice to balance the leeks better.

Very tasty!  The apple flavour really comes through to make this a very delicious soup.  (The only thing I changed was to leave the peel on the apples:  the soup was going to be pureed anyway and I had gotten fed up with peeling and chopping.)

This soup turned out awesome! I used a small butternut squash and two sweet potatoes in place of the regular potatoes and I added extra curry powder and some red pepper flakes to give it more of a kick. After I blended it, I added (already cooked) Trader Joe's Brown Rice Medley to make it a full meal.

Really good recipe. I took a journey with my hubby in making this recipe and we both thought it was rather good. The pungent smell of the aromatics of curry was to my liking. My son...wasn't a fan, but my girls were. The yogurt adds just a bit of tartness and I orginally didn't season with salt or pepper when I first tried it. I could eat this with or with out the yogurt. Having said that, when I dashed some pepper into the soup, it added a bit of a bite, I did not add or my batch did not need any salt because we could taste the flavor of the salt from the vegetable broth. I followed threw this recipe to a T. One thing if I could go back and change would be to add more vegetables, maybe an additional potato and leek to help bind some of the soup together. When it sits, the liquid separates from the actual apple/leek mixture. Adding the yogurt and combining in individual bowls does elminate that issue but I could get this with or with out the yogurt. Thank you.

Delicious and easy! I made this in my crockpot, turning it on low for 8 hours. I only used about half as much potatoes as it called for and added carrots. I didnt blend it afterwards -- I think it was just as good chunky.

I had to try this soup because it sounded so interesting... but I didn't think I would like it as much as I did! The flavors blended together gave a nice taste, a bit sweet, a bit tangy and a bit spicy. Yum!

This is really good!  I probably used more curry than called for, and added a little coriander and red pepper flakes (I like spicy soups!).  kept the apple peels on (you can't tell after you blend it all together anyway), and left out the potatoes to make it more diet-friendly...delicious!

I used all the ingredients as specified (except I used Free-range Organic Chicken Broth), chopped in my VitaMix before cooking then pureed after cooking.  This may seem like a lot of extra effort ~ It was worth it!  All the ingredients blended very nicely together.  Nothing over powering.  Nice texture and flavor.  We used our dollop of plain yogurt and served with fresh homemade rustic biscuits (daughter's recipe) and ice tea.  Simple meal, very filling and will have again!

This is the first time that I have tried making leek.But I dont see apple and curry powder go together well.Its ahealthy soup, made some changes added 1 1/2 cups of broth and didnot puree it in blender.there were plenty of chunks of leeks /potato/but I could hardly taste apple. So, next time I wont add apples .May be adding spinach and some tomatoes will work.I had mine served with plain cooked rice.thanks for a healthy soup recipe.

Though I'm not usually one for sour things, this soup is really complex and, when paired with a nice bottle of sweet apple wine, it was awesome!

This soup was so easy to make! And fast too! It's really delicious, I didn't follow the measurements exactly (I'm not a fan of measuring) except for the curry because I have never cooked with it until this recipe. I used all the ingredients and cooked for the recommended times. As another reviewer said, I was reluctant to blend it because I like chunky soups, but I went ahead and blended it and what a difference! This is a MUST do step, it completely changes the recipe. I didn't have any yogurt so I served it with a little shredded Parmesan cheese. Great recipe!!

we are having a cookie exchange, plus each person is bringing a crock of soup.  I thought that I would try this one.  Made a pot of this and it was great.  My sister and her daughter came to try it and also gave it 5 stars.  I added about 1 Cup of Swanson Chicken broth, and loved the results. That was the only change I made.  I will make this for the soup exchange.

This soup was just okay for me.  After the curry, I couldn't taste the apples at all and could barely taste the leeks.  If I made it again I'd cut the curry back to 1 teaspoon, add more apples, and substitute sweet onions for the leeks.

Tasty, but a little spicy for me. Yogurt helps alot. I will cut the curry some next time and add another apple as I didn't really get the flavor of it.

WOW!  Can I give this recipe 10 stars??  I had my doubts going in that it would end up tasting funky, but the combination of flavors was wonderful and I didn't even have to add any salt at the end b/c it was so flavorful.  I used two large leeks (about 1.5 lbs) with both the green and white parts, 2 lunchbox sized Granny Smith apples (0.75 lbs), double the amount of potatoes (1.5 cups), the full 2 tsp of curry powder, and 3 cups of chicken broth.  I substituted olive oil for margarine.  After simmering for 30 minutes, I was tempted to leave the soup whole and un-pureed because I really liked the texture of the softened leeks, but the puree-ing actually blended the flavors together very nicely.  Adding the yogurt was a nice touch of sourness and temperature difference with the warm soup.  I would absolutely make this recipe again.  I think it would be very impressive to serve to guests as well.

Love it - easy, super-healthy, and filling. Followed the recipe exactly and it was just perfect. The apple flavor doesn't come through, but that's not a problem, it adds a nice texture to the soup and that's what the most important. I used a little more potato than it called for, to make it thicker. Thanks for the recipe! I will make this many more times!

It was good but if you want more of an apple taste you really need to add more. Definitely makes a different w/yogurt.

Very good flavor and texture. I'd use a little less curry next time. The apple flavor definitely came through, but was a little overpowered by the spice.

I usually don't like soup, but I really like this one.  It's woderful of a light spring or summer meal.  I would recommend making some sort of bread with it to make it a little more filling.

5 stars for nutrition!  I used coconut oil in place of butter, half amount was sufficient.  We sprinkle lots of red pepper flakes on our own bowls.  If you omit the yogurt this is a good vegan recipe too!

Oh, my, this was good!  It was spicy and tangy with a slight crunch from the leeks, and it turned out a pretty light green color.  I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions.  I used olive oil instead of margarine and increased most of the ingredients:  3 medium potatoes, 4 small Granny Smiths, 5c broth, extra curry powder (I used my own homemade version).  I did not bother to peel the apples, and the peel wasn't noticeable in the soup, unless it contributed to the green color.  I used the tops of the leeks along with some other vegetable ends to make the broth ahead of time.  My soup was so delicious my husband and I each had two big bowls full!  I will just have to make more.  Thanks so much for a lovely recipe.

Awesome recipe - enjoyed it immensely.  The only change I made was to use extra hot curry powder as we like it hot here!

This soup was great!!  I followed the recipe to the letter except I used cream cheese instead of yogurt.    While cooking, adding 3 cups of vegetable broth didn't cover the leeks & veggies, and I was worried that I'd have to add some water -- but I threw the top on and kept checking it and it cooked down perfectly.  My neighbor says this one is worth 6 stars.   :)  I'll definitely make this one again!

Absolutely wonderful. The store had no leeks and so, despite being Welsh, I used broccoli and it was splendid.

This was the 2nd time I made this soup.  It was very good the 1st time, but I made a few changes to suite our preferences. Used olive oil instead of margarine, added 1 tsp turmeric along with curry powder, 3 potatoes, 1 apple, 4 cups of broth, to accommodate the chopped carrot and chopped celery (with leaves) that I added. Needed no extra salt, and forgot (both times) the yogurt. Results were excellent - that's one of the things I like about the recipe - it seems very forgiving of changes in proportions of ingredients. My daughter loved it too. Will definitely  make again.

I diced the potatoes, cooked them in the microwave and then added them into the blended soup.  This gave a little bit of texture to the soup.  The soup was thick enough without the potatoes thickening the soup but adding in texture.  I will make it again

This was a delightful fall soup! I made it as written but did end up upping the potatoes slightly (adding a bit of extra stock to maintain the proper consistency). As per some other reviewers' recommendations I also simmered it for about 30 minutes more than the recipe called for. No yogurt on hand but next time will definitely be sure to add it - and yes, there will be a next time!

Fantastic.  Really enjoyed it. A keeper. Only had  one apple and one leek but was great. Proportion was still good, not too appley at all and was perfect for 2 people. Only regret is not buying some bread to dunk.

I tried the squash instead of potato. I am not sure I would do that again. I had to much apple compared to leek. I am going to try again and make changes and see what I think.

My apples were really big so maybe that was the problem. The soup came out too sour.

Delicious, but we did make modifications which I note here only for my own reminder next time: only 1 fairly large apple, an onion instead of leeks, and about 2 1/2 cups of frozen hashbrowns.  We didn't have yogurt to do on the top and didn't miss it.
