The first time I made these they were eh. Because I put the olive oil and my seasoning in with the first 22 minutes.
The second time I made these, I followed directions word for word. 

WOW! AWESOME!! ADDICTING!! And I have some in the oven right now. Sorry popcorn... you have been replaced. This recipe will not disappoint of you drain, I put them on a towel and gently fold over beans to absorb moisture, dump them in a dish ( not a cookie sheet ) bake 22 minutes at 425 and then moisten with olive oil and salt.  Put them back in oven for another 22 minutes . I'm writing directions because its important to follow this person's recipe to a T.

This is a really great roasted chickpeas recipe! I used 3 cans of chickpeas and the same cooking time and amount of olive oil and all went well. To add flavor, I added Lawry’s season salt (a few shakes), 2 tsps grated Parmesan cheese or “shaker cheese” in my house, and 1 tsp garlic powder to the salt and pepper. I also cooked the chickpeas in 11 minute segments, stirring and rotating the pan each time. At the 22 minute mark, I simply added the olive oil and seasonings right in the pan and stirred with a metal spatula (rather than transferring to a bowl) and had no issue with this method. At the 3rd 11 minute check in, I tested a chickpea and didn’t think that another 11 minutes would make them crispy enough for my liking, so I cooked them for 15 minutes the final time, and they turned out great. I think this is a good recipe, just make sure to pat dry your chickpeas (I strained them too) and rotating the pan and stirring every 11 minutes may help to ensure maximum crispiness. You may be satisfied at the 44 minute mark (and I may just like really crispy roasted chickpeas) but you may need to add a few minutes to the cooking time, I think this is just personal preference.

Quick, grab your ice cold beer...this recipe deserves one. As far as method, this is a good one. The chickpeas were crunchy and crispy. The seasoning is just enough to bring out the real chickpea flavour. I ended up sprinkling some nutritional yeast on afterwards, but as is these are five star. Thank you for the recipe.

I’ve made these 3 times now so I’m ready to review. I suggest tripling or quadrupling the recipe to actually have a decent amount of chickpeas.  They shrink while cooking!  I want kids to eat them so I eliminate the pepper.  I cook them for 60 total min, adding oil & salt halfway thru and stirring every 15 min.  I also find they are amazing with 1.5x the salt, 1/2 the oil and when still warm!  Enjoy!

This recipe is easy especially if you used a can. However, I used bagged chickpeas and soaked them and simmered them first to cook.  Dried them off, and placed them on a sheet in the oven at 425. Just as instructed, I pulled them half way through and used olive oil spray to coat and then tossed them with my own choice of spices (cayenne, garlic and onion powder ).  Like others I decreased the first time by 5 min, and after seasoning left them in about 15-17 min.  Test a couple because the first time I took them out, one was perfect, another still a little chewy in the center. Great, easy snack, less fat, sodium, and cost compared to store bought.

I came home from work and was craving something crunchy but not chips or anything like that. I always have some cans of chickpeas in the pantry so searched and ended up on this recipe.

These are so good. I may try to mix it up again with some chili powder or something but they really don't need any additions. This one is going into my regular rotation.

Update: My wife and I have been together for 19 years. In that entire time she has hated chickpeas. Heck, she won't even eat hummus.

She had a handful of the batch I made the other day and just came back from the store with three cans of chickpeas and a new bottle of "Mrs Dash" and told me to make more.

I tried this two times, first in a small oven I have and then in my big oven. They did not get crispy all the way through with these instructions. They were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, not a pleasant texture! I dried them very well & followed instructions both times. I had to cook them 10 more minutes this second time but lowered the temp to 375 so they wouldn't burn on the outside. Other than this , it's a good basic recipe. I added some Cajun spice & it was good.

They were good and a nice choice to try and add these beans to our diet.  I did play around with some extra spices.  That is the beauty of this recipe you can use it as a base and have fun with it at the same time.

Everyone loved these. I doubled the recipe and used our toaster oven to avoid heating up the kitchen. I added roasting time until they were crunchy. A delightful treat!

These directions are for two 22 minute cooking sessions.  In reality it is four 11 minute check ups...  Made as directed EXCEPT used 1/4 tsp Tony Chacheres & two grinds of black pepper.. success!  Shopped ALDI today and for prepackaged result was almost $3 when the can of chick peas was 69 cents!   I'm thinking of using rosemary/garlic infused oil, regular salt & pepper... & on the final 11 minutes microplane a bit of parm.. also thinking Wasabi?? maybe a Thai curry thing.. will share...

I made this with dry beans soaked overnight. I just popped them in the oven on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. The first time I only cooked them for 12 minutes cuz I forgot the time. I pulled them out and drizzled them with orange infused oil and sprinkled with this cajon seasoning mix I make and popped them back in, setting ty timer for the correct amount of time. After a while, they started popping! So after about 10 minutes, I pulled them out. They were delicious. Now I'm wondering what they would be like had I cooked them first!

I had mixed results.  Some came out nice and crispy and others were either too dry or too soft.  I added a little more salt than the recipe called for and added about 1/2 tsp of parsley.  They taste good.

These were delicious but I found 44 mins to be too long to bake in our oven.  I played around with the timing a bit and it seems 16-18 mins each time is better so that they don't burn.

This was SO good! I stirred every 11 minutes, and also added the olive oil and seasonings right into the baking dish (I used a pie plate). I used garlic salt in place of the regular salt, and added some dried crushed rosemary after it was done roasting. I need to start buying chickpeas in bulk...this is going to be my new go-to snack! Thank you to the original poster for sharing such a great, versatile recipe!!

I feel like it could have been a good recipe, the chickpeas I tasted were doing well at 22 minutes when I added oil and seasoning. However after the second 22 minutes they were burnt to blackened crisps and set off the fire alarm when I took them out. Maybe it's just my oven but I will watch them more closely next time I try this

The second cook time was way off (for my oven) so I'm glad I was watching them. After adding the oil and salt, 10 minutes was plenty or they would have burned. 4 stars because dry roasting first is the only way to make these suckers. I've tried to roast chickpeas before, and this is definitely the method to use, just watch them the first time you make them. Can't stop eating these! Thank you for the recipe.

Came out too crunchy and almost burned for my tastes. I halved the cooking time for the second batch and came out chewy, which is more what I prefer.  I intend to experiment with different spice blends now. Delicious and so much better for me than candy.

I followed the recipe except for the baking time. I cooked for 11 mins, stirred. Cooked another 11 mins. added the olive oil, salt, and pepper; then cooked another 11 mins. Checked them and they seemed pretty close to being done, so I cooked them for another 5 min more instead.

Very good, I added a pinch of rosemary, cayenne, and paprika. With my oven It wasn’t quite crispy enough for my liking, so I added 5 minutes, next time I will add 8.

They came out soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside. Maybe next time I’ll cook them longer because I want them crunchier on the inside. They tasted pretty plain too, so maybe next time I’ll add some spicy flavor to it (I used just a little pepper and garlic salt this time).

The execution is good. But I need a little more flavor in these. The ones I had in a restaurant with British friends were amazing. These were...OK. I used garlic salt and a little chili powder. Meh. I'll add more spices next time.

Hooked!!  After reading some reviews, I decided to omit the oil.  I also found that fresh chickpeas stay together better and face it, just taste better.  I used same measurements, but I like spice so first time I used a local mix from the farmers market (new-mex chilis, Caraway, corridor and garlic) I ran out of the Local mix, so Today I used Frank's Dry Seasoning and a Tsp Ranch seasoning. Very yummy and if you follow the baking instructions, they will be crispy. Paper towel is a must.  Yes, my rub sticks even though I didn't use oil.

Very nice, I thought the 44 minutes would make them too hard. But they turned out fine. Other times I left out the stirring and bag thing half way through, apparently that does help.

Lesson learned:  Be sure to keep an eye on them as they quickly go from perfect to burned.  I made this recipe in the toaster oven and noted they seemed pretty brown after the first 22 minutes.  I went ahead and put the oil and seasonings on them and put them back in the toaster oven for the remaining time.  Unfortunately, I was busy making hummus and did not keep an eye on them.  By the time I took them out, many were burned beyond use.  The ones that I was able to salvage were incredible!  Loved how crunchy they were -- much better than the usual recipes I used.  Am currently soaking my dried peas to make another batch tomorrow.

Soooo yummy. I added one minute to each turn time because the first recommended cooking times didn’t lead to the crunchiest of peas (but that could be due to just my oven and it’s temp). Awesome!

These are a good healthy snack that is easy to make. You really have to make sure they are crisped up and don’t add the oil until they are at least halfway baked. Stir them so they don’t burn but better too brown than not. If they don’t crisp all the way, they get soggy over time. I made them just as the recipe said to and found them to be a little bland. I then used infused olive oil like you use with Italian bread and it made a huge difference. Trying all kinds of different toppings now but using this technique as other recipes don’t seem to get crunchy enough or stay fresh once baked. This does both. Stored for a week now in a jar and still crispy.

Before adding seasoning, cook beans an additional 11 minutes, a total of 33 minutes. Adjust seasoning and add garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic salt, and any additional seasonings to olive oil, then toss and return to baking sheet, cook an additional 11 minutes.

I'm still playing with this recipe but  so far, so good.  I agree with another review; follow the instructions as they are. My oven is off a little so I had to cut the time from 22 each round to 20, shaking the pan every 7-10 minutes during the baking processes.

I made this exactly as listed, though did substitute salt with a pinch of garlic seasoning. It smells delicious, and tastes good. My only complaint is that some cooked perfectly, while others were a bit mushy.

this is probably pretty good, but mine were almost black when I pulled them from the oven. I'll try again.
