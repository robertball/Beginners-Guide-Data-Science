A better name would be trail mix/granola. I was a bit skeptical that there was enough "glue" to hold this together, and it turns out I should've trusted my instincts. Since I had everything on hand, I decided to give this a try instead of using my usual granola bar recipe by Ina Garten. I hoped I found a nice stand-in... The flavors were great (helped out by a yummy granola mix I picked up at the farmers market) but after chilling, MAYBE half of it was salvageable as actual bars... if you want to call randomly-sized shards of granola mix "bars." I'll maybe give it another shot some other time...when I have granola hanging around again.

It needed a little more substance so I added 1/4 cup more honey and then after putting it in the pan I baked it at 350 degrees for 13 minutes or until brown. I let it cool completely and it held together nicely. The hubby and all 4 kids love them!

I was short 1-cup of gronola on accident, so I threw in 1-cup of oatmeal to replace it and it did fine. I'm not sure why the other people said there was not enough glue.  I didn't hand whisk this though, maybe that was the difference. I used my blender using the bread beater bar so I guess everything mixed well for me. I think the honey was the perfect amount, any more and it would be way too sweet.

These turned out really good! I followed the recipe exactly, then baked about 20 minutes at 350, cooled, then cut the bars. I'm not sure if the baking did anything. Next time I will cut the bars then bake them on a cookie sheet to see if I can get them toasted and crunchy. I froze some bars for later and they worked out really well!

We made these for a camping trip because we knew we couldn't take milk with us. Wow, were they wonderful and very filling. They traveled well, but I chose to keep them cool as I can imagine they would fall apart if warmed up. I used the mixer to mix evenly and was able to make a double batch. I plan to experiment exchanging the peanut butter for a healthier alternative, but this really is a great bar. We nixed the walnuts, added dried milk and substituted half of the granola with crunched up raisin bran. Also, I chopped the cranberries before adding to the mix. The whole family gobbled this right up. I'm hoping this is our go-to bar mix.
