As this recipe's first reviewer I wish I could give it a better send-off.  I considered the amount of basil suspect, reduced it by half, and it still was more than plenty.  I know it would be basil overkill if the full amount were used, and might even totally obscure any egg taste at all.  I found the raw garlic rather unpleasant as well as the occasional bite of the red pepper flakes.  I think garlic powder and cayenne or a little hot sauce would be better substitutes. Also, for my tastes (or maybe the size of the eggs) I needed to add more mayonnaise.  What I did love was the bacon!   I think this recipe has a fine start and with some modification would be a first rate deviled egg recipe.

WONDERFUL! Cut the recipe in 1/2 and pretty much just eye-balled everything to taste. I used garlic powder in place of the fresh, because I thought that might be too much. We LOVED the flavor of these! What a great change from the traditional deviled eggs. These will definately be made VERY often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

My family really enjoyed these deviled eggs.  I did cut back on the garlic cloves, as that sounded like quite a bit.  I think what they liked best was the fresh basil taste along with the addition of the crushed red pepper flakes.  Very different from my usual eggs that are on the sweet side.  Thanks Joe for your version of Deviled Eggs.

These were most delicious!! I only did 4 eggs for me and my husband to share and I eye balled the ingredients. I used garlic powder, basil from my garden, and the microwavable bacon(thats all I had:). They were a big hit! I will make them again for sure! Next time I'll make more eggs cause they were gone in a flash! Very Very good!!

I thought these were wonderful, but I did leave out the garlic and cut down on the basil.  I would make again.

I have made these twice now, and its now the Holiday dish I am required to bring!!   I used less bacon the 1st time- and both were really good-  Only use Fresh basil though.  I tried the tube basil last time and it wasnt the same.

Yum! Really nice twist on deviled eggs. LOVE the basil in it; gives it a fresh flavor that deviled eggs are so often missing. I don't care for raw garlic so I subbed garlic powder. Thanks! :)

This was really easy to make. I had to cut the basil because it makes my husband sick but i did add Pink Himalayan salt and fresh ground black pepper. I used Miracle Wipe over mayonnaise it gave it a little sweeter and tangy taste. My husband and dad loved them!!!!!

I was in the mood for some kick-a** deviled eggs and these definitely fit the bill! I used a little cayenne in place of the pepper flakes but otherwise followed the recipe.

I made some small changes based on other reviews - used ground cayenne instead of the crushed red pepper, and I roasted the garlic then used about 6 cloves since the flavor is milder. I highly recommend doing that; it was amazing.

Absolutely fantastic! I added about a Tbs of horseradish sauce and they were great if you like that kind of a kick.

garlic cloves had been smoked on the grill as was the bacon.
Reheated bacon and crumbled.  Thawed garlic and put in press.  Used fresh basil -- everything per recipe as far as measure

I made this recipe for an office party, and I had fellow workers begging for the recipe. I used 20 leaves of fresh basil (forget the 1/2 cup in the recipe....WAY too much) and added just a touch more mayo. They turned out perfect!

I made the recipe with 9 eggs and still had tons of filling to spare. Once the ingredients were all mixed together, the filling was a bit dry so I added 2 more Tbsps of Mayo. I then filled a pastry bag and piped the filling into the eggs with plenty left over to pipe on some crackers. Delicious. I'll be making these again. Basil adds a rich fresh flavor.

Added a little Dijon mustard for a bit of zip, but otherwise, very good and easy to make.

Perfect! Taste even better with smoked paprika. Thanks!
