I made two different types of grilled
sandwiches, one with chunky peanut butter
and bananas and one with dark chocolate-peanut butter and bananas. I melted a 
bit of butter in the pan to cook the
sandwiches in, which made it easier for
me. The kids loved this combo and devoured the sandwiches. 

Will make this again, but I think
next time I might try cream cheese and
strawberry preserves, with sliced
strawberries for myself.

Simply awesome! A slightly sweet, warm treat for breakfast or just about any other time of day! It's perfect when you need something on the go or for a quick snack. I love when a few simple ingredients come together to form something so good! I made mine for breakfast using cinnamon-raisin bread vs. whole wheat and sliced the banana nice and thin. I'm a definite peanut butter addict so this was right up my alley! You just gotta love peanut butter when it's nice and melty!

I made this for Husband last night, and he asked me to drizzle a little honey over the bananas. This added a nice flavor. My only suggestion would be to use nice ripe bananas - mine were a little bit on on the green side, and not terribly flavorsome. Thanks!

Just like Josey said, serve open-faced... with just two little changes. First, don't make this into a sandwich, but rather into French Toast! Second be sure to use plenty of maple syrup.

Make sure your peanut buttter layers are really thin, so it doesn't overpower the sandwich.  I used natural peanut butter as well as a small amount of butter in the pan.  I sliced my banana into 3 lengthwise pieces and placed on the bread then drizzled a small amount of agave onto the bananas.

This was Elvis' favorite sandwich. The only thing different he did with his was to mash the banana before adding to the bread. Sometimes we subsitute almond butter for the peanut butter. Great sandwich!

Make this great recipe quicker w/no cleanup; place an oven rack to highlest level and select "broil" on your oven to preheat.  Over the sink, brush olive oil on one side of each slice of bread; put on your fixins'between the 'dry' sides, then set sandwich on a paper plate (don't apply oil on paper plate as excess oil may catch plate on fire). Place on top rack for one minute; check to see if toasted, if not, check in 30 second increments.  When nicely toasted, flip and repeat).  Great sandwich, no cleanup!  Click button if tip was helpful.

Not only was it delicious, but my EXTREMELY picky toddler loved it.  Definitely something I'll make again!  I made it exactly the way the recipe said to and it came out great.  Probably would have been good made with butter instead of cooking spray as well.

Mmm I normally just mash my banana b/t bread and PB, but grilling it?? HELL YEAH!! This was great! I used Whole Foods' honey-roasted PB, a drizzle of blackberry honey on the banana slices, and multi-grain bread. Grilled it over med-hi w/ a small pat of butter, and *poof!* This sandwich disappeared fast!

Very intriguing recipe, so I just had to try it. I agree with other reviews, though. Don't over-do the PB or it could overpower the sandwich. The banana should be the star of the show. Creamy, sweet, and absolutely delicious! May try to add some choc chips next time for a fun after-school snack.

I have been making these grilled sandwiches for years.  They are great if you have to eat on the run and it has all healthy ingredients too.  If I don't feel like getting a skillet out, I just spread the peanut butter on toasted bread and top with sliced bananas.

First its peanut butter sandwiches.  Then some peanut butter and banana.  Next thing you know, you're grilling the dang thing :)

This one is great in a panini maker so long as you use texas toast and use a bit less peanut butter.

I made this for breakfast the other day and served it wil turkey bacon and fruit.  Instead of bread though I used La tortilla whole wheat wraps.  I just put the peanut butter and bannas on one side and folded it over.  the wrap only has 80 calories so its a healthier option.  delicious!  Husband loved it!

Edible but not too tasty - I used a chunky peanut butter that had a lot of oil in it, but the sandwich was very dry. I wouldn't make it again.

I tried to make mine with Nutella and turned out just as good!! I also spread butter on the outer sides of the bread, better color and flavor! Try to cook it on low heat, therefore the bread will be crunchier and it minimals the risk of getting burnt. Delicious!!

One of my all time favorites! Definitely use over ripe bananas for this. I also sometimes make something similar but without bread- just heat a mashed banana in a pan for 3-4 minutes, then drizzle with a bit of peanut butter and cook an additional 30 seconds.

this is how we like our banana sandwiches --- spread cinnamon-raisin bread with butter, place slices of banana on one bread, sprinkle generously with sugar, close up sandwich and place in a sandwich maker, 3 minutes later --- voila!  YUMMY AND SATISFYING!

Mmm simple and yummy. I used butter instead of cooking spray. And added chocolate sauce on another one. Really good thanks for the recipe.

WOW!  I never knew peanut butter melted so creamy!  I recommend you only spread on thin layers of peanut butter or it might be too overwhelming.  I did one thin layer on each bread slice so the banana was in the middle.  Awesome.  Cooked with butter on panini maker.  Easy.  Sliced the banana thin length wise.  Laid long, thin pieces across bread.  Fabulously delicious.

LOVE LOVE LOVE.
Another suggestion is using a 100-calorie, multigrain English muffin instead of bread if you want something lighter. Also a fun twist is putting a few chocolate chips in between the bananas... it's fabulous!

LOVE. It's such an awesome, quick meal. Great for those who want something warm on a cold day or those who are tired of the traditional sandwiches. To make this a little more healthy, try only putting half the peanut butter (i thought 2 tablespoons was overpowering) on whole wheat bread.

I make this often for my daughter and I for lunches and even dinner.  Another variation is to grill the classic PJ&J minus the banana.  This can also be done the oven, I put ours in the toaster oven and skip cooking sprays.  I LOVE IT!  Ooey, Gooey, Yumminess! :)

Got milk?  You'll need a tall glass while eating this one.  One whole banana is too much for my tastes.  I used almost half.  I also buttered the bread instead of using spray.  This is much better than a regular PB and banana sandwich.

Absolutely delicious!  I made this great grilled cheese sandwich with fresh, home-made whole wheat bread that I had just finished baking, which adds a lot of flavor and a nutritional boost.  I did grill it with a thin spreading of butter rather than spraying the pan with cooking spray, however.  Will definitely keep this recipe and make often for a quick supper when we're looking for something "different" and will try it on our company when they bring their little ones.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe! I'm a fan of all things peanut butter and banana, and this was no exception. I used some yummy sourdough bread from the bakery and sliced the bananas lengthwise to get long strips that stayed on the bread better. I drizzed some honey over the peanut butter on the inside and they were delicious. Warm and gooey and defnitely something I make a lot of.

I had heard of peanut butter and banana together but hadn't tried it before now.  For grilling, I used unsalted butter.  My sons liked it a lot but weren't awed by it.  If I try it again, I will not be grilling and I'll add some honey as someone else suggested.

I liked this as a kid, but never tried it grilled. Because my youngest has some food allergies, I tried this with spelt bread and almond butter. I tried grilling and using a toaster oven--grilling definitely works better for spelt bread because it's so dense. This was a good breakfast idea, and got even higher reviews when I added a little maple syrup :)

What a simply brilliant idea!  The peanut butter softens, the grilled bread adds just the right amount of crunch, and the banana supplies sweetness.  This is healthy, fast, easy, and oh, SO delicious.

It's a real lunch saver! I was working on making a casserole, chicken broccoli with rainbow pasta and forgot to defrost the broccoli, so in the mean time I fixed this sandwich for my son and he loved it! Honestly, I  didn't taste it but I have made peanut butter banana sandwich at another time but I didn't think about toasting the bread, great idea!

I have made grilled PB&J for decades, and also love PB/banana sandwiches, but never thought to grill them!  One suggestion to make them less dry, as one reviewer commented: Butter both sides of the sandwich before frying it.  How do you manage that, you ask?  Make a "butter sandwich" then put the peanut butter and bananas on the top slice of bread.  Now pick up the sandwich, separate the bottom slice and put it on top, butter side out.  Now put the sandwich in the skillet and you will have a golden brown and moist sandwich!  I'm a chunky PB guy, and ascribe my longevity to a lifetime of eating peanut butter!

I have made these for 20+ years, first time ever making one of these was when I pregnant with my second child and I never outgrew the comforting gooey taste of PB & Banana! I always melted a little butter on my griddle before frying them, thanks for sharing!!

And I thought I invented this sandwich!!  Simple but sooo delicious!  For those who need to make it fast, just toast the bread in the toaster, and while it's toasting slice the banana.  Once its done, slab the peanut butter and banana and enjoy!

I love this recipe! Today was about my third or fourth time making it, so I decided to mix things up a little. Instead of coating both the slices of bread with peanut butter, I used peanut butter on only one of the two, and used custard creme on the other. It makes the sandwich less gooey but still sweet.

Our family was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this was.  We tried it at Graceland (it was a favorite of Elvis Presley).  ;)  Sweet, excellent combination.  It may become a regular in our lunch/snack lineup.

I am obsessed with this sandwich. I usually toast the bread, but I would like to try it on the griddle. My favorite is the chunky peanut butter and a banana that is somewhat brown. Try it!

I really thought this was a "5" but I made a few changes from the recipe - I used Skippy Natural with Honey Pnut Butter and spread the outside of the bread with mayo plus added some to the inside as well.  The nice crunchy, grilled bread was a good contrast to the creamy, gooey middle.  This is a tasty lunch treat - not just for breakfast!

This recipe is great! Make sure you use ripe bananas so they have that somewhat sweet taste. Though it sounds weird, adding mayo to the sandwich brings out a nice flavor. I use less than a tablespoon of mayo though.

If you have never tried this, it is a must!  Do take the advice many others have offered and use ripe bananas.  Much tastier and a little more nutritious than the old standby of pb & j.  I use light margarine rather than pan spray...PERFECT!

Delicious!  I have eaten peanut butter and banana sandwiches all my life, but never grilled.  The only thing I did differently was to cook it in butter. I made them for my 2 and 4 year old grandsons, and they weren't overly impressed but they are soooo picky.

No, try this on an ENGLISH MUFFIN. I am serious, I eat this EVERY morning for breakfast. I also drizzle a little honey over the peanut butter, and then slice the bananas over that. Just enough for breakfast, and a great source of protein to get me through the morning! There is NOTHING like melted peanut butter over a toasted english muffin... I buy the $1 six pack and they are even better than the brand name. Try it. You'll be hooked! (Oh yeah, and let the bananas ripen a little more...SO good that way!)

I tried this for my preschool kids and called it "Curious George" sandwiches (cause that's what he'd eat).  I really thought it was great - the grilling brought out a toastiness in the bananas.  The bananas were a bit runny and messy though.  My kids didn't like it as much as me.  Only 1 out of three finished theirs.

Very very rich and different and very yummy.  Be warned, mine was burning after 1 minute on each side, rather than the 2 minutes they estimated here, so be sure to check it periodically.

I've made this many times but also many ways. My kids like it as a waffle sandwich. Just toast them in a toaster and spread pb and bananas. This way is really good but I think my favorite way is how my husband makes it. Peanut butter, marshmallow fluff, and bananas and grilled on an outdoor grill. So good!! Just use some foil on the grill grates because it gets all melty. Of course it can be made in a pan or sandwich press too. My family is a little peanut butter obsessed lol

YOU MUST DRIZZLE HONEY OVER THIS SANDWICH! I've done this for 40 years. Dont put the honey inside the sandwich or the bananas will slide around. Put it on top and eat it with a fork. Oh, and always use LOCAL HONEY, and it will help with any allergies.

Yum. I like making them with the cooking spray instead of butter. I hate the taste of butter and peanut butter together. Isn't this how Elvis died?

I love how the peanut butter melts into such creamy goodness! Something very different that could be a quick lunch, how I enjoyed it, or as a snack anytime. I did spread the bread with spreadable butter instead of using cooking spray. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe, KATIES8422!

This was surprisingly good.  I fried in butter instead of cooking spray and drizzled some chocolate on top.  The kids loved it.  Next time I will make it as french toast.

Sometimes you just want to live like Elvis did, and this is the sandwich for those times.  I agree with the reviewer who suggested adding honey, especially if the bananas are not extremely ripe.

I make these all the time..I spread a little butter on the bread first, then put the PB on the opposite side with the banana slices in the middle.Adds a little flavor. we also love grilled PBJ sandwiches.

This was Elvis's favorite snack. The only difference is he used bacon fat to fry the sandwich in. It is very dry if you don't use some sort of fat on the bread. I suggest a light butter to margarine.

This was good for breakfast.  I tried it several different ways: with whole grain bread and with buttermilk bread, and grilled with butter and with cooking spray. Whole grain bread is the way to go and the spray comes out equally as good as real butter! My husband said it was missing something and put honey on his.

I know a serving of peanut butter is 2 T., but it's just too much for me. 1 T. divided between two slices of bread is plenty to taste yet not have your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth. 1/2 a banana is plenty too. While I have had peanut butter and banana sandwiches before, I've never grilled them until now. I like it.

The warm peanut butter is delicious and the bananas stay room temp. I didn't like the oily flavor from the butter I used to fry it in and I don't think I'd like the cooking spray either. Really tasty and fast!

If you want the outer pieces to be toasty and not soggy, use a little light mayo on those sides. I know it sounds weird but they will come out yummy and toasty!

This was a different twist on a grilled sandwich. The warm peanut butter though was drippy, messy, and oozed out while eating. The banana got a tangy taste when heated up and added a soft mushy texture. Although I like all the ingredients separately, I really didn't care for this at all. This is going to make a mess while eating and just know there will be some clean up if you are serving this to kids or toddlers. Sorry this just isn't my thing.

Felt like it was missing a little flavor. I think it could have used a little honey, maple syrup, or chocolate. Something to give it a flavor boost.

Absolutely wonderful. My 10 year old said it was the "best sandwich he has EVER had"! I even drizzled a little bit of chocolate syrup over the banana/peanut butter combo before putting together and grilling. Sooooo good!

I only added pb to one slice of bread by mistake. It probably helped on the calories some.  I think this would be really good with honey! I normally snack on 1 slice of bread and pb w/ banana slices and honey. So having it toasted was a change of pace. I'll probably make this again.

This is great for breakfast (or anytime, really)! I added light margarine instead of cooking spray to the bread, spread peanut butter on each slice, layered a sliced banana, drizzled with honey, and sprinkled with cinnamon before I put the bread together. Afterward I cut the sandwich in half and added syrup - a great substitute for french toast! I'll be making this for years to come, and plan on experimenting with many other toppings!

Fun new recipe.  Very quick, very easy, very good response.  My three kids gobbled it up quick.  My alterations:  I buttered the bread instead of using pam spray, and I sprinked cinnamon on the peanut butter.  I could also use honey or marshmellows inside the sandwhich.

Best idea ever! I love bread. I love peanut butter. I love bananas. I love them all together! Such a simple idea, yet I would have never thought of it on my own. Thank you to the original poster! I will be making this more often.

I tried this recipe with apples instead of bananas (since I didn't have any). It turned out very yummy although I might not use quite as much PB next time. Thanks for the fun breakfast idea!

I eat this sandwich just about everyday for lunch. Sometimes I mix a little chocolate peanut butter and regular peanut butter together and it is so yummy!!! I also drizzle a little honey over my bananas. I usually stick it in the sandwich maker and BAM! I have an excellent lunch. Nothing beats melted peanut butter!

I love this sandwich! I have made it at least 4 times the 1 thing that I would change is I add a teaspoon of honey to the peanut butter before I put it on the bread.

I made this recipe exactly as it called for and it was great!  Next time I think I will try some chocolate chips sprinkled in.  It seems like this would be a good thing to eat if you were sick...=)  UPDATE:  Try drizzling 1 tbso of honey onto this as well.  It takes the flavor to another level. =)

used i cant believe its not butter spray, a little over 1/2 a banana. and added a few chocolate chips (got the idea from another sandwich on this site) you will need a tall glass of milk to wash this down, but its so good. i wish my mom would have known about this when i was growing up.  :D

OMG!  i had a sweet tooth last night and don't normally keep much for sweets in the house and i don't know WHAT made me think of looking up this recipe, but i'm so glad i did.  it was DELICIOUS!  I also lightly buttered the other side of the bread and sprinkled with a little cinnamon/sugar...toasted to golden brown and used a tiny bit of maple syrup on top.  I cannot believe how good it was or that I had never tried one before.  Don't knock it til you try it!!

This was very tasty! I used day-old homemade French bread but that's just because it's what I had. Don't over-stuff your sandwiches with banana or you'll have a mess in your frying pan! Anyway, a little bit of hot banana goes a long way, I promise!

I make a sandwich very similar to this.  Since there are so many calories in it, we split it 3 or 4 ways so it's always a real treat when I make it. I saw the recipe for the pb/banana sandwich that Elvis Presley's cook used to make for him on his biography on TV.  I never wrote it down so have always gone from my memory which could be wrong. :-) Here's how I make mine. I use 2 slices of white bread, toast it, spread peanut butter on both pieces, slice up a small banana and put on one piece of toast, then put other toast on top.  Fry it up in some butter until heated.  Sooooo good!

YUMMY!!! First I spread the peanutbutter on the bread added cinnamon and then spread the bananas on top. After I grilled this I dipped it in honey and it was yummy! As a snack I also like to cut up bananas and put honey on that and sprinkle it with chopped walnut...mmmmmmmm....so good

Haven't thought of this flavor combination before, but this really makes a regular peanut butter sandwich taste great. The slight modification I used was to put a little bit of agave nectar (or regular honey will do) on the bottom of the pan while cooking to give the bread a little sweet outer crust. Be careful, though, as this makes the bread easier to burn so watch it when you're cooking.

My boyfriend is running around with his sandwich right now and practically singing its praises.
My suggestion: be sure to fry the banana slices as well. This adds a terrific touch and contributes to the warm gooiness.

Really tasty.  I made a few changes the second time I made them per the suggestion and they were even better!  I added about 1 1/2 T Honey and 3/4 t Cinnamon with the peanut butter before spreading it on the bread and they were great! Thanks for the posting! :o)

I was actually going to submit my recipe for these when I found this one, lol.  We make these all the time and my son loves them.  If I want to make them extra special, I drizzle a little honey over the bananas and spread a little butter on the outside of the bread before grilling.  I'm glad to see so many other people love these.

these sammys are so good! i like to mash up the bananas and add honey to them. of course, grilling them in butter is better than cooking spray.

Good recipe but I like my PB and Banana sandwiches the way Elvis did his. Pan "grilled" with butter, not cooking spray, and with a few pieces of crispy bacon inside. Yum.

I have neevr been a fan of peanut butter & banana sandwiches but I liked this one! I stole a bite from my granddaughter's & then had to whip me up one too. ;o) I copied Caroline C. & drizled a little honey over the bananas. Went perfect w/ a cold glass of milk!

My son loves peanut butter and banana sandwiches. Used cream peanut butter and white bread. He thought this was O.K. and ate it but likes untoasted bread better. I thought it was pretty good. Wasn't this Elvis' favorite dish?

This basic version is good, but add mayo and a little butter on the outside of the bread before grilling and you won't believe how good it is. It's tastes more like a desert. I'm going to try it a-la-mode sometime. Bet it would be awesome.

Too bad I did not think of this before.  These are a wonderful treat.  Only change for me was using cinnamon chip bread and making it open face and once cooked sprinkle with cinnamon/sugar.  Will definitely make these over and over again.  Thank you so much.

Simple and tasted good, but didn't really grab me. 2 minutes on each side was too much- mine was a little too dark!- but I didn't count that against it in this rating because it didn't affect the taste of the flavors within the sandwich. This would probably be a good food item for a child or for a quick snack for yourself, but not one I'll likely make very often.

Pretty good, but a little more sweetness would make it perfect...maybe adding a little honey or using cinnamon peanut butter instead.

I really like peanut butter and banana slices on toast, so I thought this would be great. It was OK for me. Maybe it was just more bread than I'm used to. I fried it in butter, which I think is the way to go. I think I might like this better as French toast. I did like this and think it is worth trying.

I was lazy, so instead of grilling it, i toasted the bread, spread the peanut butter and added the bananas, then microwaved it for 1min. Turned out great.

made this today for breakfast with sprouted bread, and a thin spread of coconut oil to fry it in.  Loved it!  I always made peanut butter/banana sandwiches, but never thought to grill them.  good idea. 

Thanks for the post.

Mmmm...I found my new favorite snack. I had heard of peanut butter and bananas but I was hesitant to try it. I loved the taste of the warm peanut butter on the toast and the sweet banana.

I made this in 5 mins. This is a good recipe because it is something that is quick and easy. It doesn't require a long list of ingredients that you'd have to go to the grocery store for--bread, peanut butter, and bananas are usually items that everyone has in their house anyway. That way, it takes you no time to throw it together before a work morning. 

 Also I sometimes get intimidated by some of the recipes on here by seasoned and very experienced cookers. This is something that anyone can do. As long as you know how to make a sandwich (or grilled cheese) and fry the two slices of bread, you can do this one.  Also, it is pretty tasty and not unhealthy for you to eat if you use whole wheat bread, lots of bananas, and only a little bit of the peanut butter.

Even better with chunky peanut butter and drizzled maple syrup on top when it's all done. Very tasty.

Much better grilled...I don't know why I never thought of it myself.  I spread butter over the outside of the bread instead of using oil.

Very tasty for something so simple and easy. Surprised we had not thought of it ourselves as much as we eat grilled sandwiches. Like other reviewers, I melt a small bit of butter in the pan to grill the bread, versus the spray. Chunky or smooth pb were both great. They also wrap well in foil to take on the move, and taste good, even when cooled.

I used coconut oil for frying instead. Yummy!  I needed a quick way to use up some smooshy bananas that fell off the top of the freezer. I have three kids but I made this one for me :) it was good!

Perfect breakfast for kids who won't eat breakfast. Sprinkled a little cinnamon over bananas. May add a little honey next time. used butter vs spray for more flavor. Kid approved.

These are great to make on a cold night when you want a protein-packed easy dinner! I was at a cafe once, and they made theirs with a tortilla! They wrapped it up and fried it on a panini press...for mine, I add some honey to the PB and Banana before frying it up, then sprinkle cinnamon on top. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yummy!!!:)
I bet you could do a fried Fluffernutter too! (Pb and Fluff)

I've been eating pb and bananas on toast since I was 8. Never did I consider making a grilled sandwich. Great idea. I wouldn't be pouring syrup all over it or rolling it in sugar because 1. You would loose the flavour of the pb and banana and that wouldn't make a whole lot of sense since this recipe is for PB and bananas. And 2. That would be way to sweet. Way to fattening. And completely unhealthy. And again that would be a total different recipe.

I don't understand how anyone could mess up this recipe as long as they have (successfully) made a grilled cheese sandwich before. I added a drizzle of honey to mine and it came out perfectly. Good, sweet snack!

Look people, it's all or nothing with this sandwich. You have to grill it in butter or it will be tasteless and dry. Lots of calories, yes, but you're not eating it every day! Use butter, it will be much better and that's the way Elvis had them!

I grew up on these!  Now that I'm older, I think I may try them kicked up a notch.  I'm planning to beat some eggs and dip the sandwich as if making French toast, cook about 3 minutes per side, and possibly add powdered sugar or syrup to serve.

Well,I will tell ya. I love it. I have been eating it since I was a little kid. With one minor difference, I just make toast. Why dirty a pan when you can just pop the bread in the toaster? Hmm-reminds me I need to get some bananas.

My dad used to make me these sandwiches all the time; they are my favorite. It sounds weird, but they're oh-so-good! They work with cooking spray, but I like to use a little butter in the pan instead, just like I do with any other grilled sandwich. Try it! It's delicious!

Burned the bread in 2 seconds flat. I think it might be easier to just toast the bread and spread the peanut butter on while it's still warm.

I used Udi's gluten free sandwich bread and put it in our quesadilla maker, amazing and simple! Thank you for a quick, easy, healthy and tasty sandwich. If you use a quesadilla maker it will only take a minute and a half to two minutes...no flipping required.

This was an all time favorite of my sons as they were growing up.  To "kick it up a notch", or make it a "Mom Treat", I added chocolate chips and mini marshmallows between the peanut butter and banana slices, prior to grilling.  My grown sons and their wives love the "adult" version.  Thanks for bringing back the great memories!

oh this is just awesome it's 11:49pm here in germany and this hit the spot! I grilled mine and then drizzled some honey over the top, I used salted butter and browned it a bit before letting my bread toast in the pan. AGH! Gonna make another one!

I made this as an after school snack for my kids, and they all enjoyed it. I drizzled some honey over the bananas and used honey-oat bread. Delicious!

This is a great sandwich!! At first I was a little concerned about preparing this sandwich for work because I never tried this sandwich prior to preparing it for lunch (but I knew this would be good). I was very surprised with the flavor of sandwich and I am intending on making this one of my choices for lunch. I also added a little honey on banana w/cinnamon and nutmeg. Came out great!!

Yum! This is a very easy, simple, warm, and tasty (breakfast) sandwich. The grilled bread combined with the oozing gooey center of peanut butter and banana made a wonderful and delicious combination.

Made this last night... not too fond of bananas but I figured I would give this a go. Glad I did - it was delicious! I added a bit of sugar on the bananas before I grilled it. Yum yum.

Haha, I couldn't resist trying this! I grew up making peanut butter jelly and banana sandwiches, but I never thought to "grill" them! This was good...a great twist on an old favorite! This is a keeper, but next time I think I'll add jelly.

The idea of grilling this sandwich was appealing. I also base what I'm going to make on the reviews, and all the reviews were good. The sandwich was good, but the warm bananas killed it for me. I liked the way the bread and the peanut butter came together.

Mmmm, excellent stuff! I came up with a variation on this idea last weekend, then searched "banana sandwich" on this site to see if anyone else had tried this before. My version is a thin layer of peanut butter on one bread slice, grape jelly on the other, with lots of thick banana slices in between! Grill on the peanut butter side first. It's delicious! Also good with nutella (chocolate hazelnut spread) or honey + cinnamon in place of the jelly.

This is my favorite sandwhich ever! I make mine differntly though...I use Crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy to give it that nice crunch when you bite into it and I also put honey on it. I've tried adding cinnamon to it as well which is nice if you like cinnamon, just don't add too much or it will be overpowering. Give me this and a big glass of milk and I'm in Heaven!

Im not a banana fan, and the thought of warm gooey banana's didn't sound very appealing to me at all. This recipe has converted me. That was really good, but it was even better with the honey as other's suggested. I tried this reicpe cause it sounded so odd. But it was worth it. YUM.

I have been making these sandwiches for years and I am now making them for my children who absolutely love them. They were Elvis Presley's favorite food and one of mine too.

I thought this sounded kind of strange, but my son loves bananas and I was looking for a different way to serve them.  This was really good and popular with the whole family at the breakfast table! Based on other reviews, I added a drizzle of honey and some cinnamon over the bananas.
