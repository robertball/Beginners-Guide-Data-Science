Just a tip for fuss free banana mashing... stick them in a zip-lock bag, zip and squeeze!  When you're done cut a corner off and you have a pour spout!  I do the same for marinades and everything else of the sort!  So much cleaner!  And less dishes to boot!

Amazing pancakes. Definitely the best I'v ever made. I followed another reviews advice and added 1/2t. of vanilla extract. I also used 2T of applesauce instead of the vegetable oil to make it a little healthier. Delicious!!

I have found that by measuring the dry ingredients and then putting them through a shifter makes for fluffy pancakes.  I also substitute melted butter for the oil, I mix the liquid ingredients including the egg and then add the liquid mixture to the dry and stir to mixed, add two whole banannas and using a potato masher, mush them well.  I use 1/4 cup measure per pancake.  For thinner add a bit more milk.

this was a really simple and yummy recipe! i added vanilla like what many reviewers had suggested and it turned out even more delicious. it was just sweet enough for me. but 1 thing to note is really to cook this on a LOW temperature so that the insides of the pancakes gets cooked. it's also less mushy and easier to turn. i learnt this the hard way. the first time i did this i turned the stove on HIGH and the bottom browned really fast. i was struggling to turn it over but the whole thing basically fell apart cos it was still very soft and mushy inside. the bottom ended up black and i had to throw it out and start from a lower temp. other than that it was yummy =) thx for the recipe Andrea

My family loved this recipe but I used self rising flour and omitted the salt and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I also omitted the oil and added 2 Tablespoons of applesauce. And for the peanut butter lover I added to a sauce pan 1 cup of each water, sugar & peanut butter best with smooth peanut butter. And brought this to a boil and cooled I used this as the syrup for the pancakes. So I saved a few calories on the pancakes but added a few on the peanut butter syrup. It was well worth it.

What wonderful pancakes!!  I made a plain batch and then a batch with toasted pecans added to the batter.  Both excellent!  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I adjusted the recipe.  I read the "mushy" complaints and decided to only use one banana.  They were perfect and had plenty of banana flavor.  Everything else in the recipe stayed the same.  I will say that it was a large banana so maybe that makes a difference.  However, I try to reserve 5 stars for outstanding recipes that DON'T need tweaking.

The flavor of these were okay, but the texture just did not do it for me. They were very, very, overly moist. On the verge of being mushy feeling, though I made sure to cook them a very long time. Perhaps the poster uses smaller bananas than I did. It would help if the measurement was in cups instead of amount of bananas, since banana size varies so much. I won't make this recipe again.

I halfed the recipe because I only had one banana! I liked the banana taste, but found the pancake to be too mushy inside like other reviewers.  The concept is good, but I will keep looking for a better recipe.

These turned out delicious!  Because some of the other reviews said the pancakes were a little flat, I did the following to 'fluff' them up and they were beautiful:  to 1 tbsp. of lemon juice add enough milk to make 1 cup and let it stand for at least 5 minutes before adding it to the mix (basically, a substitute for buttermilk).  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, and 1 extra tbsp. of white sugar.  I finely chopped the bananas instead of mashing them, as I find this helps make them not as heavy and I like the way there are little banana chunks in the pancakes.  To reduce the fat, I used only 1 tbsp. of oil instead of two.  In some of them I added peanutbutter/chocolate swirl chips and those were delicious, but very dessert like!  Enjoy!  (Oh, I would say this serves more like 4... it made 10, 3-4 inch pancakes)

I included a teaspoon vanilla, one chopped apple, a handful of chocolate chips, and a sprinkling of cinnamon - turned out wonderful! This is the second time I've made these like this, and I've noticed that making a "whoop" noise while adding the vanilla makes these banana pancakes more delicious.

Wow!  Great recipe!  I actually have been making this for a while now, but haven't rated it.  I have two toddlers who LOVE the banana flavor in these pancakes!  I've added a few things - about 2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup rolled oats.  I love the nutritional value of wheat germ and when you add it to these pancakes, you can't even really tell it's in there!  I make these as often as I have time in the morning or for a brunch on the weekend.

So far so good.  I've actually modified the recipe quite a bit, as far as proportions and some on the ingredients.  Used self rising flour, subbed in two tsp extra flour the missing baking powder.  Only only 1/2 c 1 % milk instead of the whole cup.  Otherwise, followed recipe directions as-is (produced a thick batter; could almost stand a spoon up in it); let sit for about 10 minutes until air bubbles rose to the top.  With mods, this recipe produced fantastically fluffy pancakes with a great banana flavor.  Can't be beat.

Scrumptious!  I LOVE bananas and you really get the banana flavor in these!  Added some cinnamon, didn't bother with the sugar and oil, bananas are sweet enough on their own.  SO GOOD, will make again and again.
Edit: I tried these with 1/4 cup cocoa subbed in for some of the flour = banana chocolate yumminess!!  I have made these several times now and find they are fluffier and less 'wet' on the inside if you cook them real slow and add about 1/2 tsp baking soda!

Not bad, but not particularly outstanding either.  The kids (young adults) thought they could have been a little sweeter. I'll try again with modifications.  Thank you Addean.

Just finished a batch - yum!  I made exactly as directed, except added 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract and spme flaxseed.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and mashed the banana in a baggie.  I was able to get it really liquified, so the pancakes had an even banana flavor, and not big clumps of banana.

Make these!!! They are as easy as any pancake you will find and they taste great.  They are amazing with peanut butter on top, or with cinnamon sugar & maple syrup.  They even taste a lot like banana french toast except they're 1 million times easier to make (well, if you like making pancakes).  Seriously there is nothing wrong with these.

My only criticism of this recipe is the same one I have for many of the pancake recipes on this site - the serving size! Maybe my two toddlers and I are just big eaters, but we can handle the "6" servings all by ourselves!

You can substitute or add as suggested by other reviews, but this recipe is successful as-is. I cook the pancakes on medium low, until they are well browned and start to steam.

Delicious.  I used 2 Tablespoons of apple sauce instead of oil, added 1/4 tsp of vanilla, as suggested by other users, and used a mix of 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour.  YUM!  Also, be sure to cook it on a lower heat to make sure it cooks all the way through without burning the top and bottom.

I don't know if I've already reviewed this recipe, but I just had to say, these pancakes are awesome! Usually when I get a new recipe, I have to modify it to my family's taste, but this one I followed to a T and the pancakes came out so moist and sweeet we didn't even need syrup. The only problem I had was that I had to use fresh bananas (because bananas disappear FAST in this house), but if you microwave your bananas for about 35-40 seconds before you mash them, that makes the bananas easier to work with.

Ol' Butter Fingers here dropped a bunch of bananas, which then turned black in a hurry so banana pancakes for breakfast it was! These were great! Next time I would double the salt to a 1/2 tsp to better enhance the banana flavour. Also, medium high heat is a disasterous setting for my pancakes. I always do medium low and have great results. One last thing, because these pancakes have banana in them, cooking them thoroughly means that they will be darker than the usual 'golden pancake'. Think of it as the difference in colour between a regular loaf of bread and banana bread :) Oh, and you can't lose if you throw a few blueberries or for special occasions chocolate chips into these bad boys. The best technique for add-ins to any kind of pancake is to pour the batter into the heated griddle first, then plunk in your blueberries or chocolate chips or whatever on the raw side while the other side cooks. This method is also great if you want to use the add-in to make a design like a smiley face or initial in the pancake :)

After hearing the Jack Johnson song, how could I not try this recipe? And I'm so glad I did. Definitely my favorite breakfast. I like mine a little mushy in the middle, and I don't smush the bananas in all the way so there are chunks. I would use riper bananas in the future and don't expect something like banana bread! If that's the taste you desire, maybe add a little cinnamon.

Dee-licious recipe! Everyone in my family, from 3 to 70, loves it.  It was requested again this morning.
I've tweaked it a bit to make it a little healthier, easier, and tastier:

1. Use 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (healthier)

2. Use 2 tablespoons of apple sauce instead of vegetable oil (healthier/tastier)

3. Mash bananas in a ziplock baggie, snip one corner, and squeeze into bowl like frosting (easier)

4. Add a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract. (tastier)

5. Add a tablespoon of flaxseed meal (rich in fiber, lignans and omega-3 fats)

Very tasty.  The banana flavor was perfect, just the right amount.  I added some chocolate chips to a few.  I really enjoyed that!  My only complaint, they weren't fluffy enough for me.  I'm sure some people like flatter pancakes; I just prefer mine fluffy.  I would definitely make these again, however!

Hmmm.  Not sure how to rate this recipe - if I could, I'd probably give it around 3.5 stars, but I'll give it a 4 on the side of caution.  The taste was pretty good.. most certainly banana-y, but the texture wasn't great.  They also burned very very quickly, and the outside was done well before the insides even with the heat on low.  The only thing I changed was omitting the sugar, but I don't believe that would change things that much.... bananas - especially over ripe ones - are sugary enough.  I'll give them a try again sometime, but this really wasn't the best pancake recipe I've ever made.

GREAT!  I am a boxing coach and I made these for my athletes after one of their morning runs and they loved them.  Making them with the wheat flour worked great!  Next time I might try adding some almonds...

My toddler son loves bananas, but wouldn't eat these pancakes.  My husband, too, really like bananasa and disliked them so much that he only ate a few bites and discarded the remainder.  They taste like banana, but there's something about them that just doesn't taste right.  We were very disappointed and do not recommend this recipe.

This is my favorite pancake recipe thus far. Thin, yet fluffy and just enough banana for a great flavor. I added candied walnuts to the top for a great crunch.

These pancakes are the best and they are very easy to make. I would suggest mashing the banana's very well in order not to have big hunks of banana in the pancakes.

This recipe offers a great alternative to ordinary pancakes for breakfast. They are a great way to use overripe bananas. One addition I made is to add chocolate chips to part of the batter and it was delicious.

Awesome flavor!  I used 3 really (really) ripe bananas, and they turned out great.  I used butter 'cause I didn't have any oil.  Of course, butter makes everything better, right?  Great recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  I took other reviewer's advice and added the vanilla.  I also sprinkled chopped pecans on the pancakes as they were cooking.  Fluffy, with a very banana flavor, which we loved!  GREAT RECIPE!  By the way, my very picky 1 year old loved them :)

This is a delicious recipe! Although, I did add a few extras....1 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. These compliment the banana flavor well.

Have made these a few times now.  I like to add a little vanilla and a dash of nutmeg.  These are great when you spread on some peanut butter and top with syrup.  My toddler loves when I top with peanut butter and mini marshmallows!!

These are easy to make and delicious!  My husband and I added walnuts and cinnamon to the dry ingredients and vanilla to the wet ingredients and it took the recipe over the top!!!  We have made them the last few times that we had left over bananas.  Thank you to the advice of mashing the bananas in a bag from a reviewer- that speeds things up a lot!

Great taste, very fruity, just not as fluffy as I would have liked.  Maybe I'll try again with a bit more baking powder.  **** Tried these again this morning with a new can of baking powder- Fantastic!  Also make sure you do not over mix the batter, there should still be a few lumps.  I served these with the Strawberry Syrup on this site and everybody raved over them!

My pancakes came out great! I read some other reviews and followed some of their suggestions: I added a pinch of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour + 1/2 cup of white flour. To make it a little bit healthier, I used 1% milk and couldn't taste any difference. Also, I added a small handful of some semisweet chocolate chunks to the batter. :)

Next time, I will probably only use 1 or 1 1/2 bananas. The pancakes were a bit mushy, which I thought I wouldn't mind...but I think adding 1 less banana may make the texture a bit more pancake-like. 

Hope this was helpful!

Made these for breakfast the other day and these were very good! After reading the reviews I did use only 1 banana and I also added 1/2tsp of vanilla. They came out perfect! If you like banana pancakes, this works great!

Delicious and easy. I had the heat turned up to high so they were starting to burn on the outside before the inside was done but that is my own fault. I cant wait to make them again!

I liked them a lot! They made a lot more than 12, but that is because we made them small. I used 1 1/2 banana because that is all I had, and it was fine. The only thing is that these are a little bland... next time I will add vanilla, as suggested. I will make this again for sure, with a few modifications of course!

This was a great recipe. I added 1tsp of vanilla and also doubled the amount of sugar. I used one large ripe banana and found that it provided enough of the banana flavor for my liking. As an extra treat I peeled and sliced up some apple and fried over medium heat with 1tbsp of butter 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/4c of brown sugar. It made a wonderful topping as the juices from the apple and the sugar made a sweet syrup.

These were pretty good! Not as fluffy as I would have liked but definitely very moist. I added a bit of vanilla for extra flavour, but that's the only change I made. Sure did the trick to satisfy my late night sweet tooth ;)

I make batches of these and freeze them for our daughter.  In the morning we put one in the toaster and they are PERFECT!  Definitely a keeper.  I use 3/4 cup milk, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and leave out the oil completely.  Instead of bananas I use 2 jars of fruit babyfood (ususally one applesauce + one of anither flavor) so sometimes we have banana, blueberry, apple... the possibilities are endless.  Love it!!  Thanks!

I thought these were good. I should've used 2 bananas instead of the one the reviews said, one banana just doesn't give it enough banana flavor. I like the pb with syrup idea, but one of my kids didn't like them with pb and my youngest didn't like the pancakes at all, but she's the picky one. I did what the reviews said and I added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tap nutmeg to the dry ingredients,  and 1 tap vanilla to the wet ingredients.  I also added 1/4c chopped pecans to give them a crunch. Yummy when you slice more bananas on top, but I can't get enough bananas!

Delicious! I took the suggestion of a couple other reviewers and only used one banana. I also added 1/4 C. chopped pecans and these were excellent.

I've used various banana pancakes recipes and this one is one of my favorites.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because my mom didn't have the same opinion of them.  The next time I make them, I am going to add 1/2 tsp vanilla as others did to see what difference it makes and if I like it. Looking forward to making them!

I think these are the pancakes Jack Johnson refers to in one of his songs.  They are easy to make AND delicious.  I made them exactly as the recipe called for this time but I might try to do 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour next time just to make them a little healthier.

This was delicious and quite popular with guests, even my banana-phobic daughter.  I used half whole wheat flour and low-fat sour cream thinned with milk as the liquid (I was trying to use it before it expired).  I added vanilla, cinnamon and some toasted, chopped pecans too.  Since the whole wheat is heavier, I sifted the dry ingredients and found the pancakes were not mushy.  Be sure to use a lower heat because they do brown quickly with the sugars in the banana.

I served it with warm maple syrup and blueberries.

I found this recipe early this month and have already made it twice. It was the first time I tried my hand at pancakes and turned out really well. Following other reviewers, I added half whole wheat flour the second time I made it(maybe next time I try with only whole wheat). Also blend the liquid ingredients and bananas to a puree. I skipped the oil and would just add a little butter. Greeat recipe. Thanks for Sharing

I actually made this with a pancake mix, 2 very ripe bananas, and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  Excellent!  Cooked it on med heat, and it came out perfect. I froze the rest for reheating the next day. I greased the skillet with a spray oil, and it came out perfect.  Loved it! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is NOT one I would make again.  I assumed my toddler was just having a picky morning when he refused a second bite, because he loves pancakes and loves banana.  Then I tried a bite, and yuck.  A very thick batter makes cakes that came out golden and disgustingly gooey, or burnt and just barely cooked through - neither choice is particularly pleasing.  After cooking up about 3/4 of the batter trying to manipulate the heat and cooking time to rescue breakfast, I gave up and we had cereal.

Before today I always thought to make good pancakes, I'd have to have bisquick in the house. But this morning I tried this recipe, using a few suggestions from other reviewers, and WOW! THEY WERE AMAZING!!. This is definately "A KEEPER"!  Here's what I did differently from the recipe.

1. I use 'Extra Lg.' eggs, used 2 instead of 1.
2. I added the 1 t. of pure vanilla extract.
3. I used 2 T. of baking powder (mine was 'old' and I was concerned it wouldn't give enough lift).
4. Instead of sugar I used 1 T. baking Splenda and 2 T. brown sugar.
5. I added flour, 1/8 c. at a time until the batter was the correct consistancy for how we like our pancakes. 
This is a terrific recipe, Thanks, Andrea!

Yummy! My husband and daughter fixed these for breakfast today and they were awesome! Tasted just like banana bread just turned into a pancake. After some other suggestions in a few of the reviews, they made some slight changes ~ added about 2 tbsp. more flour, added some vanilla and cinnamon. Perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

These were really good, I did add about a  1/2 cup more flour because the batter was a little runny,and a little bit of vanilla, they turned out great really moist. I agree with the other reviewer who said that if you were a experienced cook at all you know how to judge how the recipe will turn out and add and take away whatever you want, to make it suit your taste ( something along those lines)
So don't sweat it!
My boys all really loved them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some syrup.
They were great the next day to snack on cold to.
Next time I make them I might add some chocolate chips, and make my kids day! Thank you for the great recipe.

These were so yummy Andrea.  I added a tsp of vanilla extract, 1 tsp of cinnamon and upped the sugar to 1/2 a cup.  The batter is very runny and it produces a very flat and dense pancake BUT... they taste great!  If your looking for a light and fluffy pancake recipe, try "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes"...they are terrific as well.  My daughter (22 months) absolutely loves bananas, so I was thrilled when I came across this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

My youngest loves anything that contains a banana and these were no exception.  Normally on a school day my version of a hot breakfast consists of a Pop Tart thrown in the microwave. Needless to say, she was a happy little camper this morning! We're both happy that you submitted this recipe Andrea and I'm sure you're a wonderful cook. Some people are just plain rude. Anyone who "claims" to be an experienced cook also knows where to add or cut to back on certain ingredients. Happy cooking!

I made these this morning and they were a hit! It was easy to put together and they cooked up fast. As suggested by previous reviewers, I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract for added flavor and substituted 2 tbsp. of applesauce for the 2 tbsp. of vegetable oil to make them low-cal. The pancakes turned out fluffy and moist and tasted perfectly sweet and flavorful, no syrup needed (which is huge bc I love syrup!).

Made these impulsively last night when I saw the recipe! They were delicious! I didn't use much syrup at all- they are so good they don't need it. The batter is a little more runny, so mine weren't perfect circles, but still tasted great. I might try to add a little more flour, or a tad less milk next time to see if it changes the taste too much.

Really wasn't that impressed. They were edible, but very heavy and almost had a thick crepe like taste. No way they could be cooked on med/high, I did the first two that way and it was a failure. I make alot of pancakes and always cook on med-med/low.

So easy and SO delicious! I had a few over-ripe bananas and wanted to do something with them instead of tossing (or making bread). I discovered this recipe and glad I did! Per some recommendations, I also added about 1 tsp vanilla, a bit of cinnamon and used 1/2 butter in combination with the oil. Finished off with maple syrup and sprinked with some chopped pecans. Yum!! Thanks ADDEAN1 for the great recipe!

Tried this using Almond Dream milk and my home-made gluten free flour mix - excellent results! I'll be using this as my "go-to" pancake recipe.

Yummy yum yum!  What a great way to use your too-ripe bananas.  I added a pinch of cinnamon as suggested and they were sooo good.  My picky hubby said they tasted like banana bread and a cinnamon bun in pancake form.  I cooked them in Vegetable oil in a cast iron pan which made the outside so crispy and delicious.  We had them with maple syrup, whipping cream and few sliced bananas on top.  It was more like dessert.  They were gobbled up in 10 minutes flat.  So moist, fluffy and delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

We make often banana bread as a use for our over-ripe bananas.  This was a great alternative!  When bananas get over-ripe, simply put them in the freezer. When you are ready to use them, microwave for 60-90 seconds.  Open one end and squeeze the banana out of the peel into your recipe. I put everything into my food processor, which is perfect for pouring the batter out into the pan.  Also, doubled the batch and put the extras into the refrigerator.  Kids will heat and eat them for breakfast all week and even grab one with peanut butter on the go.

This is one of the worst pancakes recipes I have tried. I forgot that it was this one I had tried before and used it again this morning. A real waste on good bananas and my time. Will not be using this one again.

I liked the banana flavor, but the texture wasn't quite right. They were too liquidy. I think next time, I'll put a little more flour and a little less milk.

This is the best pancake I have ever had!  I mixed a little nutella with some peanut butter and dropped a spoonful onto the top of the pancake.  It was the perfect accompaniment.  I mashed the bananas in a bag and cut a hole in a corner to pour it as someone else suggested.  Also, I sifted the dry ingredients before mixing them with the wet.  These were so moist and tasty.  I can't wait to make them again!

These are a fast favorite with me and my fam now. I never add the sugar as I feel it's unnecessary since the bananas add enough sweetness. I've also tried variations with adding chopped walnuts or raisins, or replacing half the milk with coconut milk for a different flavor. Even without adjustments though the basic recipe is super, and very kid friendly.

These are mu husband's favourites!  I add 3 bananas and use 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour - and they are still the lightest, fluffiest pancakes ever.  I also add a dash of nutmeg & cinnamon and a splash of vanilla for extra flavour.  My neice came up with her own twist and put peanut butter on them instead of syrup!

Taste was good, but the texture was lacking.  Very flat and "mushy".  I tried cooking low and slow and also on medium/high heat.  Just don't make a very fluffy pancake.  Kids liked the flavor, so it is a keeper.

This is a family favorite - and something to do with your bananas gone brown!  Helpful hints:  Instead of using 2 bowls for wet and dry ingredients - use one bowl.  Mash the bananas first, then add other wet ingredietns EXCEPT the milk.  Add the dry ingredients, then mix.  Add the milk at the very end.  I don't like a runny mix, so I have found that I do not need as much as the recipe calls for.  Just add the milk to your desired texture.  We added some chocolate chips to them as well.  Yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will never buy boxed pancakes mix again!

Great recipe!  For a bit more flavor I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  For a healthier pancake use: whole wheat bread flour, Splenda or honey/agave nectar, fat free or 1% milk, and apple sauce in place of oil.  I also used two egg whites instead of one whole egg.

I like to freeze my over ripe bananas. When they thaw they are already mushy. They can be thawed in the microwave for about 20 seconds also.

I make these pancakes every weekend for my two kids.  These are so good just plain  that we never use syrup on them!  

I make two changes to the original recipe.   I sprinkle 8 chocolate chips on each pancake immediately after pouring the batter onto the griddle.  (I tried putting chocolate chips in the bowl of batter, but the batter is thin and they all sink to the bottom.)  Since I use chocolate chips, I cut the sugar in half.  

I recommend keeping them between 4 and 5 inches across because they are a little difficult to flip if they are large.

Made this recipe, but added a granola cereal(I toasted the cereal in a frying pan first) I had to the mix and boy did that perk it up! Make sure your bananas are super ripe when you use them. You'll get the best flavor.

Made them this morning.  Used Egg Beaters, and tossed some mini chocolate chips in with them.  They were fluffy, but not enough naner taste.  Also, I thought they naners were a little "goopy."  I will try them again, and re-review.

I really don't like giving recipes a bad review, but this one was just not quite right.  Maybe too much baking soda?  And the texture was mushy.  I ate them, but my kids wouldn't touch them.  Followed recipe to the letter.  Maybe banana pancakes are supposed to be like this though?  I have never had them before so perhaps its not the recipe?

Okay well I started out giving this recipe 4 stars, but I've made it twice since then (my daughter loves them!) and it just seems to get better each time. The last time I used applesauce instead of oil and I will do this every time, it made the pancakes even sweeter. Yum!

They are very good. I added some pecan. They were a little mushy though. I would recomend a double recipe for a 4-6 person family.

Great recipe that easily allows for omission of the egg to accommodated egg allergies.  I didn't make any changes other than not including the egg and the result is still a light, fluffy, tasty pancake.  Excellent!

These were so great!  I used 1 c vanilla soy milk in place of the regular milk and 2.5 mashed bananas.  They were yummy and a hit with my little kids!

The flavour was good but the texture of the pancakes was mushy. Maybe it had too much banana in it... I think I will stick with blueberry pancakes.

these were really good.  I added vanilla (because vanilla makes everything better) and I added some chopped pecans.  I would have given 5 stars, but the reason I gave 4 was because the pancakes were a little mushy.....I think if I make these again, I won't mash the bananas, rather I'll just cut them into small pieces and add to the batter.  That way they will have a better consistency, and the flavor will still be there.

This recipe was phenominal! Very easy to make and very delicious too. I replaced the all-purpose flour with whole wheat and it was great! Super healthy! Thank you for sharing!

I omitted the sugar and added vanilla.  They were sweet enough the way I made them.  Note that I halved it and only got 5 pancakes (I made them a little bigger than 1/4 cup each, which still wasn't very big) so a full recipe won't really serve 6 people.  These are great and I will make them regularly when I feel like pancakes!

These are so good! I combine all the dry ingredients, then put the egg in the blender, blend for a couple seconds, add the rest of the ingredients (including whole bananas) and blend, then slowly add the dry mix. I pour it onto the griddle right out of the blender. Works great and saves a lot of time.

Used whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of the oil...also only used 1 very ripe banana...delicious!  I also estimate that by omitting the oil you drop each pancake down to 100 calories per cake...but please keep in mind that this recipe says you can make 12 pancakes...I made 6 good size pancakes which was plenty for me and my bf.  So 6 good size pancakes at 100 per cake...not too bad!!

This is scumptious!  I add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter.  I pair these with a recipe I found at http://www.epicurious.com/recipes........

2 large bananas  cut into 1/4" rounds
1/4 cp melted butter
1/2 cp brown sugar ( I use light but the original recipe calls for dark)
1/4 cp water
1tsp vanilla

mix melted butter, brown sugar, & water in large, heavy skillet ( I use cast iron). Boil on med/hi heat  until slightly thickened. Approx 2 min.
stir in vanilla & bananas. Remove from heat.

YUM! YUM!

These were yummy and my daughter thought so too.  I snazzed this up a bit by adding a dash of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla and some finely chopped walnuts. Also cooked on medium heat as these pancakes seemed to need some more time for the middle to cook properly.  Definitely a keeper!  Good with whipped cream or some milk and honey.

This recipe was fantastic! This was my first time ever making pancake batter. I always bought pancake mix, so I was very skeptical about how the final product would turn out to be. It turned out GREAT (except for the first try). I did not grease the pan well enough, so the batter was stuck on the pan. I had to throw that out, but the rest of the pancakes turned out great! It tasted much better than the pancake mixes I used in the past! Thank you=)

These were really yummy. It does take awhile too cook them and I recommended doing so on low heat so they cook through. Mmmm...Made the pb syrup another person added and it was yummy with chunky pb.

My 3 year old asked for banana pancakes today because she said she used to love them when she was little...anyway, I have never made them for her or anyone for that matter so I was thrilled to find this delicious and super easy recipe.  She was able to help with the entire thing so she was proud too.  Her twin 10 month old brothers ate them up as well! I would probably add vanilla next time and will try other reader's suggestion of applesauce instead of oil.

Awesome recipe. I substituted the white sugar for a heaping tbsp of brown sugar and the oil with butter. I added a dash of cinnamon and chopped pecans into each cake as they cooked. So good, no need for butter or syrup!!! Husband and brother inlaw begged for 2nds!

I'm not really a pancake person - but I did like this. Instead of mashing the banana, I just cut into thin slices and dropped them into the pancake batter. Turned out really good! Oh! I also added about 1/2 tsp vanilla extract!

Perfect recipe. Fluffy, lots of flavor. Only adjustment made was to sub 1/4 cup of wheat germ for 1/4 of the flour and I used buttermilk. This is a good use for the overripe frozen bananas we keep in the freezer, so I will make these again. Topped with walnuts, pumpkin butter, whip cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg. Delicious.

delicious, with a few touch-ups. My BF loved these for his b-day and proposed to me that day... I attribute it to the pancakes. I used 2 bananas, one I smashed in a baggie and put into the batter, the other I sliced and put into the pancakes right after I poured the batter into the pan. Putting the pancakes right on the griddle brought out an incredible flavor. I also sifted the dry ingredients before mixing with the wet. I also added carmalized walnuts on top... superb! Incredibly sweet with the walnuts, but perfectly sweet without.

This recipe was perfect! I added 1/2-1 tsp vanilla as other people have said. I am the worst pancake-maker ever, but somehow I've made this perfectly every time. Thanks!

These were good, but they took a long time to cook.  Also, there were spots around the banana pieces that were less done than others.

Really, really good.  Everybody liked them.  I made mine with whole wheat flour to give some nice texture but it needs a pinch more baking powder that way.  And as some suggested, I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, toasted walnuts, and only used one pretty good sized banana instead of two.  Next time I'm going to sub apple sauce for the oil, which works really well in other things.

I make pancakes often and these were THE hardest to tell if done in the center. Even with allowing to bubble, they were still so moist from the banana that they tasted undercooked. Next time I will try BEATING my bananas in, so there are no lumps. MAYBE that will help incorporate it better to cook more evenly. The flavor was terrific so i will try again.

These were really good, a bit bland for me. No complaints though and they come together very satisfactory. If you are looking for a knock your socks off kind of pancake try the Pumpkin Pancake recipe on this site.

These pancakes were delicious. I used half whole wheat flour half white for a healthier version. I used brown sugar instead of white, skim milk, and egg white. I omitted the oil. That took care of the mushiness on the inside the bananas makes them soft enough without extra oil. They were great!

These were very good. They are very moist and flavorful. I did a couple of modifications, though - I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, added a dash of cinnamon, and also added a teaspoon of vanilla.

I noticed a couple of reviewers said they had problems with the inside of the pancakes being mushy. A couple of suggestions for that: 1) if you notice the pancakes are getting too brown before the inside completely cooks, try turning the heat down a bit. 2) If the bananas you have are particularly large, try using only one and a half bananas instead of two.

Very good recipe! I would probably use three bananas next time instead of two to give it a more banana-y taste and will definitely try adding cinnamon and vanilla extract. However, they were very, very tasty!

The recipe did what it said... made banana pancakes.  My family thought they were gross.  We followed the recipe to a T and added a little Vinnilla.  They cooked just fine... fluffy and light.  (HERES A TIP: when u mix the batter of pancakes, do NOT overbeat. just mix a bit.  If you over mix, the will be heavy.  You almost want to under mix pancakes.)  
We just did not care for the taste even though we doubled the recipe and only added 3 bananas.  I would say doubling the recipe would give you 18 average size pancakes.  
We will not make this again.

YUM!! I like my pancakes a little over done, so i'm glad these kind of need to be cooked a little longer to get rid of the mushyness. My picky 4 year old loves them!!-Also they freeze really well. Always a bonus for us.

To make my Banana Pancakes I'll freeze some bananas that are going brown.  When they are partially thawed they are soft and gooey and mix very easily with the wet ingredients.  Love this recipe.

Wow, this was delicious! I have been overseas for a while now and have been craving some good American pancakes. These were fantastic. Moist, melt-in-your mouth texture, too. The only thing I did different was add a teaspoon of vanilla extract as suggested by other reviewers.
Thanks so much for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly and I ended up throwing the pancakes away, they were brown on both sides, but so mushy on the inside... it seemed  like they didn't cook enough. I will not be making these again.

Very, very good recipe.  I used whole wheat flour, which makes the pancakes a bit more dense.  I've used this recipe with blueberries as well as banana and I actually like it better that way, but that's a matter of personal preference.  Using 1 full cup of milk proved to make the batter too runny.  Had to increase the amount of flour so I would recommend using about 2/3 c of milk.  I use honey instead of syrup, which really accents the fruity flavor.

Delicious, fluffy, and moist. The riper the bananas, the better; I added a splash of vanilla because the bananas I had on hand were not as ripe as I'd like. As a preference, I pureed the bananas so that they were smooth, with only very small chunks left. To make these a little healthier, I used a 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour, and add 1/4 cup of Quaker Oats (whirred in a processor first). I also used applesauce instead of oil and brown sugar instead of white. I cooked the pancakes on a lightly oiled griddle at 300 F and served them with blueberries and no sugar added syrup.

I followed the directions listed with the addition of vanilla, cinnamon, & nutmeg.  When I ladled the pancakes onto the griddle, I dropped a small handful of chocolate chips on top.  They turned out to be perfect pancakes which we enjoyed.  I froze the leftovers for breakfast next week.

I make this often.  To make it more nutritious, I usually substitute 1/4 cup raw wheat germ for 1/4 of the flour.  My non-banana-eating husband even likes it.  I usually only use 1 banana because 2 bananas make the pancakes too spongy-wet in the middle.  I don't think it would serve 6.  I usually make about 10 4-inch pancakes, and it fills my husband, my 2-year old, and me just right.  Great recipe!

I don't usually like bananas, but I liked these. I used half oat flour and half white flour, and I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter. They tasted similar to banana nut bread; I bet chopped walnuts would be good in these, too! Next time I think I will puree the bananas as I wasn't crazy about the little globs that were left in the batter after I just mashed them. I followed other suggestions and cooked them slowly over medium heat, and they browned nicely.

These pancakes always come out fluffy and light.  My boyfriend and I like to add a little vanilla extract and chocolate chips. I also only use one banana instead of two and thin it out with a little extra milk.  Buttermilk is also really good if you have that on hand. I've used this recipe a dozen times and the pancakes always come out perfect.

I couldn't resist making these after listening to Jack Johnson. These pancakes were decent, but needed some tweaking. I found that the batter was a little runny, so either decrease the amount of bananas or milk, or add some flour. They also weren't as puffy as I liked, but very tender and moist. I substituted applesauce in place of oil and made it with half whole wheat half white flour-came out delicious. Also, a dash of vanilla and cinnamon made it better. All in all, good basic recipe.

My eldest who normally chokes one regular pancake down for me, ate 2 large cakes and took another to school! I added a splash each of vanilla, cinnamon and mini chocolate chips.  I also added close to a quarter cup more of flour to make it to the consistancy I'm comfortable with! 2½ minutes on each side and they made me the worlds greatest mom for the day! Thank you, thank you!

I confess I only tried this recipe because I love the Jack Johnson song. I am such a nerd. But I really liked the flavor. The trick to getting this recipe right is to almost liquidate the banana (use just one). I also added about 4 TBS of sugar, 1 TBS vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinammon and used buttermilk in place of milk. Makes the house smell so lovely and tastes great!

These are good and a great way to use those over-ripe bananas... I omit the sugar, they're sweet enough with the sugar from the banans.

I've made these a few times and always hope to get the hang of them, but each time they are under done.  They taste great and smell wonderful.  My only guess is to add more flour because the batter seems too runny.  They always turn out thin and rubbery for me without altering the recipe.  I hope to figgure this out!!  Barb in BC Canada

I used one big banana instead of two and substituted 1 Tb of maple syrup for the sugar, and the pancakes turned out pretty good.  I highly recommend adding 1/2 cup lightly toasted chopped nuts (I used walnuts) to offset the slightly mushy texture.

This was a good recipe before, but this time we decided to add chocolate chips to the batter & it made them out of this world. Bananas and chocolate are the perfect combination & solves the problem of whether to have syrup or not, no need with the sweetness of the chocolate chips.

Yummy!  I one-and-a-half this, mix the wet ingredients in the blender first (thanks to whoever suggested that!), using two eggs, and cook the pancakes on a slightly cooler griddle than I'd normally use.  I eat mine plain with butter.  :)  My 2-year-old and my husband loved them as well.  They use maple syrup.  Definately a keeper recipe!  It's become a staple in our house.  UPDATE:  Since my daughter was diagnosed with an egg allergy, I've used Ener-G egg replacer and it makes them even better!

Not to bad, just don't over do the banana's.
My 2 year old son loves them.... thanks 

To make them fluffy just add a bit less milk.

Wonderful recipe! Tasty, healthy, easy to make. It is a keeper. I am saving it to my daily cook-book. It is great hot right from the pan, and it is also great in several hours. 
I used previous reviewers suggestions.  Changes I made to the better: add 1 tsp vanilla, replace 2 tbsp. of oil with 2 tbsp. of apple sauce, replace 1 cup of milk with buttermilk. If you don't have butter milk, add 1 tbsp of lemon juice to the milk and let stand for about 15 mins. Do not mash bananas, but chop. Add about 1/2 cup of blueberries before cooking.

These are some of the best pancakes I've made yet. I add half a cup of chocolate chips to them when my nephews and nieces come over and they're a huge hit! But I also use applesauce instead of vegtable oil to make them healthier, shhh.

I served these with salty feta cheese and real maple.
All pancakes were gone in a blink.

I had everything on hand to whip up the recipe for my family on a rare rainy day in Southern California. The banana came through nicely and we pairs it with real maple syrup, fresh sliced strawberries, and whipped cream.

Excellent recipe! After reading other comments, I reduced milk by 1/8th cup and used 2 medium bananas, plus added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  The proportions came out perfect, the batter was not too wet and it cooked beautifully.  Made extra pancakes into Elvis breakfast sandwiches by filling two pancakes with peanut butter!

I tweaked the recipe a little.  I used whole wheat flour in an effort to make it healthier.  Whole wheat flour is  more dense than regular all purpose white flour so I added an extra egg.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil as others did and added cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. The results, yum.....My grown son loved it!

These pancakes are fantastic. Both with and without the half tsp of vanilla extract other reviewers recommended.
I was going to freeze half the batch because I was only cooking for myself but ended up eating them all over the course of the day.They're really good cold, too. No regrets! :D

I love the taste of these pancakes. I think the moist problem has to do with the cooking and less to do with the recipe as when I started to cook them it was a bit moist but when my mom change the pan and cooked them it was perfect. I ate them with whipped cream and syrup. So amazing. And I like how it is to adapted to make little changes to one's preferences.

A big hit with my family!  Left out sugar (my bananas were very ripe), subbed coconut oil and added a splash of vanilla extract.  Moist but not mushy.  Loved that they were not heavy since wet ingredients out weigh the dry so they were pretty thin.

Easy and delicious! Listening to Jack Johnson and just had to have banana pancakes. Luckily, I had all the ingredients on hand. I agree with the earlier reviewer to cook at a lower temperature as a couple got overcooked.  Next time I'm going to add some cinnamon and vanilla as others suggested, but the recipe is delicious just as is!

I read the reviews and really thought I was going to enjoy these pancakes.  I sadly didn't. I was careful to cook them on a heat that wouldn't cause them to burn and I didn't flip until all the air bubbles had popped.  They looked great but I did not like the texture at all.  They had a very "mushy" texture in the center that I didn't care for.  The flavor was OK but a bit bland and I added cinnamon and vanilla.  My son took one bite and was done. I understand the mix of reviews now as I don't think it is a bad recipe it just doesn't appeal to every palate.

I adjusted this recipe for 9 servings, it required 3 bananas, I reduced to 2, round the eggs up to 2, and topped with some homemade strawberry syrup... Turned out amazing!! 

Just for extra flare for a valentines day breakfast I made them heart shaped, strawberry jam topping, garnished with strawberry slices, it was a hit!

Excellent, superb, YUM-O. I substituted the oil for butter and milk for buttermilk. I'm always glad to add more food groups per bite for my kids.

Tried these this morning, as I had a lot of bananas in the freezer begging to be used up. Simple, tasty alternative to regular pancakes. Served them with fried eggs and venison bacon. Yum!

Very good!  I added chocolate chips which made them delish. I used one banana, per reviews, and I think two would have been better. It's best to try a recipe as is and then use reviewers' suggestions after that if needed, so that was my error. Good recipe!

I made this recipe last night, it was fantastic!  The only tiny things I changed were that I used brown sugar instead of white and a little bit of vanilla (just love those flavors).  Otherwise the recipe was spot on, and I'm sure it would be good either way.  Make sure you set the griddle to a lower-than-usual setting and give them time to "bake" to avoid getting the gloppy texture on the inside.  If you have a little patience, they will turn out to be fantastic!  I used somewhat small organic bananas that were over-ripe, and it was just right.  I also let the mix sit for about 30 minutes while I did the dishes to try to get it to rise up as much as it could before starting.  I served mine with boysenberry syrup and whipped topping, and woooow.

I made a few additions so instead of 5 starts it gets four. I added 1/2 tsp allspice and 1 tsp cinnamon. If I have buttermilk on hand I sub it for the milk and add 1/2 tsp baking soda. This makes a thick batter and in the past, I have added more milk. Don't do it, they don't rise as much.

Everything about this recipe worked for me. The bananas give it a nice sweetness without the empty calories of extra sugar. I did use 1 tsp of vanilla as suggested by other members. I also subbed in 1/2 cup of oats for the flour for extra fiber. The pancakes are fluffy and delicious and behave well in the pan (right consistency, easy to manage). Will definitely make these again.

Best pancakes I ever made.  Very simple and delicious.  Only used one very ripe banana and added a 1/2 tsp vanilla and chocolate chips. My son loved them.

I would suggest 2 eggs and substituting 1/3 cup almond flour + 3/4 cup gluten free all purpose flour. A spoonfull of freshly ground flax seeds would add a nutty flavour w/ more nutrients.

After reading some of the reviewers' comments that the pancakes were burnt on the outside and mushy in the center, I made a few changes to the recipe. I increased the sugar to 1/4 cup (we like a sweeter pancake), added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in addition to the 2 t baking powder, decreased the milk to 1/2 cup, decreased the oil to 1 tablespoon, added a dash of cinnamon, and also added chocolate chips. My batter scoops were about the size of a 1/4 cup, and this made about 16 pancakes. Made them for my 7-year-old my son and his friend for breakfast after a sleepover, and they both loved them and demolished half the platter. My son's friend requested I share the recipe with his mom so she can make them! Definitely a keeper recipe!

My husband is the better cook in the family, but I'm the pancake maker. I've tried several banana pancake recipes and this one definitely got the best reviews from my husband. He originally said he didn't want any, but I made him try a bite and he came back for several more. I did add the 1/2t of vanilla extract like others said, but didn't change anything else. They were great!

Thank you for posting a deliciously adaptable recipe.  We made changes, based upon my family's tastes and these were fantastic!  We substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour, 2 tablespoons of maple syrup for white sugar, unsweetened applesauce for vegetable oil, added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  My 2 1/2 year old kidabunks each ate four of these for breakfast.  Thank you again.

Mild banana flavor very moist. Burns easily on stove needs to cook on low. And add extra spray/butter to the pan because the pancakes like to stick otherwise. I added tsp of vanilla didn't include the sugar.

These are definitely delicious, glad to add this to our "keeper" recipes. I knew I could add mashed bananas to pancakes, my son has done it before. However I wasn't sure on the amount of banana. I found this recipe, and funnily enough the base pancake part of the recipe is the exact same recipe as my old faithful recipe that I use from my cookbook. So one change I knew to make, which I will share here is, if you use fat free milk you need to cut back on the milk in order to achieve perfect fluffy pancakes. I doubled the recipe, so I used ONLY 1 1/2 cups of milk. Yummy with butter and syrup. But would be great with just butter.

These are good and easy to make.  The banana flavor is there but not overpowering.  I made the recipe as written the first time and the second time added 1/8 tsp of roasted Saigon cinnamon.  I think next time I may add another half of a banana.  They taste great as written but I will alter the recipe a bit in the future to fit my personal taste.  My husband really likes these as written.

Delicious! I added a 3rd banana and balance it out to make it healthier by adding 1/4 cup of fiber flakes, 3 tbsp of ground  flax seed and 3 tbsp wheat bran. They came out incredibly moist and was barely able taste the healthy additions from all the banana and still went well with it nonetheless. I also used non-bleached all-purpose flour. This has quickly become a breakfast staple in my home!! :)

Great pancakes!!!!  Let me just say, I am not a pancake fan.  I prefer waffles or french toast before pancakes.   To me, pancakes have no taste whatsoever.  Then I thought maybe I should try another version of the pancake recipe.  I love bananas therefore, let me try this....well, I made them last night and they were delicious!!!!!!  The only thing I did differently was add a little bit more sugar and vanilla extract to the batter.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  Unfortunately, my husband and 4 year old doesn't like bananas...but who cares!!!  These will be for me and me only!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

The banana flavor is wonderful in this recipe! This goes great with homemade vanilla syrup sprinkled with walnut meats. I initially followed the recipe using a_houghtaling by mashing the bananas in a bag, but I found that it left chunks of banana, no matter how well I squeezed it between my hands. Half way through, I decided to puree the rest of the pancake batter and found that the banana flavor was better distributed and the pancakes cooked up smoothly and evenly. The only thing I didn't like about this recipe is that it left a baking powder after taste. Next time I will try reducing it to 1-1/2 tsp. To experiment a little, I added some chopped walnuts to a laddle of batter before cooking it, and concluded that I prefer to sprinkle walnuts on top when served (personal preference). A bit of cinnamon would also add a nice touch, and I think substituting whole wheat flour for all-purpose might work well. I will make this again ... it seems to be a forgiving recipe. :-) Thanks for sharing.

I added a little vinegar to the milk to make buttermilk, and added spices (cinnamon, nutmeg) to the flour mixture. The banana flavor is just right, unlike many other banana recipes that are too weak. This is a great simple recipe!

I made these for my husband and father inlaw before a hard day of fencing. I got two thumbs up from both of them and they were full until dinner. As other reviewers suggested I added vanilla and substituted applesauce for the oil.

Really good! Used really really really ripe bananas and doubled the batch.  I ran out of milk, so I used water instead.  This recipe is just perfect, quick and easy.

A family favorite. Recipe can easily be doubled or tripled. My parents freeze the leftovers and toast before eating. Great way to use up over ripe bananas.

Delicious! I added the vanilla other reviewers mentioned as well as some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. These tastes great with a homemade buttermilk syrup. Very Yummy!

I just made and ate this this morning. I thought it was really tasty. Of course the mashed banana made them nice and moist which is a good thing!

These are great!!! I substituted all whole wheat flour and added a splash of vanilla and a little cinnamon. I think they'd be awesome with some chopped up walnuts or pecans as well!

Very tasty pancakes! I added 1/2 tsp of Banana extract to the batter. I made sure my 2 bananas were RIPE. As I was mixing the batter I thought it was a little too watery but it ended up fine in the end. I think next time I might add 3/4 cup buttermilk instead of a full 1 cup. Easy recipe to make, didn't take long to make pancakes, I ended up with 5 medium size pancakes. I cooked it on low setting so as not to burn the outside and ensure even cooking. I topped the pancakes off with more sliced bananas and some maple syrup. All in all, delicious banana pancakes served with crispy bacon!

These were very good but like other reviews 2 bananas leave the inside a little slimy/gooey. I used 2 as the bananas weren't quite ripe, worth trying again but will use only 1 next time. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and vanilla.  They are harder to work with than traditional pancakes because they're heavier and stickier. I imagine you could probably use jarred banana baby food as well, I can't bring myself to use baby food in a recipe but there's a lot of them out there that call for it and I'm not sure the bunch of bananas I bought will get ate. The dogs enjoyed the ones I ruined :) My husband hates pancakes but said if he HAD to eat them then he'd eat the banana ones, he's a picky brat though so don't go by what he says LOL! Update: I froze the extras and after reheating in the oven at 200 for 30 minutes the insides weren't gooey.

These were awesome! I altered the recipe a little by using buttermilk and adding 1 tsp of baking soda and teaspoon of vanilla. I also used butter instead of oil. I sifted the dry ingredients and they turned out perfectly fluffy! Can't wait to make these again!

My kids LOVE these pancakes!  I also add vanilla extract as well as almond oil...super yummy.  I usually use one or one and a half bananas and the texture is fine.  My kids request these at least twice a week and would probably eat them every  morning if they could! :)

These pancakes are wonderful! It's so nice to have something other than banana bread to make when our bananas get overripe. I've made them twice, and the second time used half white flour and half white whole wheat flour. They turned out slightly denser and a little nuttier. Really tasty! My toddler LOVES these.

This recipe was really good. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and and used 2 tbsp applesauce instead of oil. The pancakes were delicious, they tasted just like banana bread! The only thing that keeps this recipe from receiving 4 stars is that they were a bit mushy.

I made these for my husband and 1 year old as I am allergic to bananas. My daughter ate them all up and my husband said they were delicious!! The only thing I changed was using blue agave syrup in place of the white sugar. I did put the bananas in a zip lock bag and squeezed as one member suggested. Overall a great recipe!

Taking into account the reviews of gumminess, I only added one banana to the batter.  Well... the pancakes were still gummy inside.

Update 7/21/2014 - Replaced milk with buttermilk, still used one banana, and added some baking soda...MUCH BETTER!!!

Flavor was ok but totally mushy. They start off looking fluffy but by the time you flip them they sink and turn soggy. Perhaps adding oatmeal would help absorb some of the moisture. Not for our family, they have the consistence of undercooked pancakes.

Pretty much perfect!  I took the suggestion of adding a little vanilla, and I served them with some homemade buttermilk syrup that I had left over from German pancakes.  I'll definitely make this again.

Good, tasty & easy recipe.  I did sub in whole wheat flour for white.  I made one batch as is, and the rest I made with pecans.  My sister & I agreed that pecans was the way to go.  :)  THANKS FOR SHARING!!

I had some ripe bananas that I didn't want to go to waste so I followed this recipe except I added a 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and I used a little butter instead of oil to grease the pan.  Delicious!

These were good. I was surprised they came out as fluffy as they did with the banana in the mix. I use a food processor and puree the bananas rather than mash them. It gives the pancakes a smoother texture. Also, I made these a 2nd time and added strawberries for strawberry / banana pancakes.

This was very good! I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some and put in the toaster for a fast breakfast. I added some vanilla as well but also some coconut to it. Very, very, good! I was a hit with my little boy.

This recipe is delicious! The only thing I did differently was add 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the mix! Will definitely make again!

I liked the banana flavor in these pancakes but didn't like the consistency of the pancake at all.  I make Good Old Fashioned Pancakes all the time from allrecipes and like it much better ...  I also had trouble getting these a nice golden brown - they got dark quickly even on lower heat.  Not bad but not nearly as good as many others I've made.  My kids ate them but weren't thrilled either...  I doubt I'll make them again.

Just finished eating these and they were SO good!  Used the vanilla instead of salt.  I had 2 smaller bananas and would suggest using medium sized ones..could've been a BIT more banana-y for my taste.  As for the mushy reviews: I used a griddle and had it just above the 250 mark.  I let them cook on one side til pin prick sized holes appeared in the MIDDLE of the pancake.  that's when I flipped and removed when golden-ish.  I happened to have some coconut syrup to put on them. SO good. :)

Delicious! I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon, as other raters before me had suggested. I used frozen (defrosted first) bananas that were super ripe and omitted the vegetable oil (on accident), and these turned out fabulous! I will probably continue to skip the oil since they were so moist and flavorful without it.

I actually just made these before looking at another recipe. I made spiced banana pancakes though. I didn't have any 5 spice so I just used cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Also whenever my bananas go bad, I put them in the freezer. All you have to do is thaw them which takes maybe 5 minutes, and then take the skins off and let the banana fall into the mixture and then mash them. I made it to where there were chunks of banana too and it was awesome to have a big piece of banana here and there.

They were a little watery and I had to use 3 more tablespoons of flour. They were also floppy and moist when cooked. May have been because I used over-ripe bananas instead of ripe. Will probably stick with pancake mix and just add bananas if I want that flavor.

The pancakes came out with a very nice texture.  I used my mini blender to mash the bananas.  I will follow the advice of the other reviewer's about the heat level.  I will make sure that I cook them slowly because they darkened too fast, and some of them came out a bit mushy in the middle because they cooked too fast and darkened too quickly on the outside.  My 3-year old was helping me, so I was in a rush to let her pour the 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla in the batter (as some of the reviewers suggested), but it turned out to be rum extract.  Yummo!

Really good pancakes.  I did add cinnamon and vanilla just because I like those flavors in my pancakes. And I cooked them on lower heat (350 on the griddle) and slower to make sure they weren't mushy. Great banana flavor. I'd definitely make again.

These pancakes were ok. I made mine with whole wheat flour, no oil, a splash of vanilla extract, and sliced almonds. I also served with bananas on top.

This is super. These are some of best pancakes that I have ever tried. The banana flavor was not overpowering. I did think that my batter was a bit runny when I followed the recipe exactly. That is an easy fix! Highly recommend.

excellent! I tweaked it a bit, using rice flour instead of all-purpose, and they tasted so good on their own that they didn't need toppings! however they cooked funny. browned very fast on the outside before cooking on the inside. otherwise great!

While cooking first side we added mixtures of chocolate chips, walnuts, coconut, strawberries then flipped and cooked.  It was a banana sundae pancake.  We also loved them original.  DELICIOUS!

These pancakes are awesome. I ran out of milk and substituted strawberry yogurt and added 1 whole egg (since I made the recipe for two people and didn't know how to half an egg) and they still tasted delicious. As suggested, I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and cooked on medium heat. Thank u for the recipe.

Delicious!!  I only had one small to medium banana, so added the milk in increments.  It took the whole cup.  Might not take so much if you use both bananas, depending upon their size.  This is a keeper!

I'm sad to say I wasn't impressed with these pancakes. My 8yo asked that I make "normal" pancakes next time. The only changes I made were adding 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. The only way I could avoid mushy middles was to make really thin pancakes, and cook for a long time, but then they didn't hold up well while eating. It probably would've been faster to just make banana bread. I also like making extra pancakes for freezing/eating the next day, but these didn't taste very good on day two. Sorry, not making again.

These were excellent and came out beautifully textured.  The only thing I did different was I used a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Yum can't wait to make these again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are delicious!!!  I made them this morning for my husband and three kids.  They wanted peanut butter in them too so I added 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and the result was great!  They are also good as is w/out the peanut butter chips.  :-)

Oh My! These are soooo good! My kids ate them all in a matter of a few minutes. They even asked if I could make more that could heat up for breakfast during the week.  My son, my resident coconut lover, even had me sprinkle some coconut in his. I just asked him what he thought, and he gave it a thumbs up !

I followed the suggestion of lowering the heat and they came out great! My husband and I loved these pancakes. I will definitely make these again. I put peanut butter on them and ate them that way. So good.

Unbelievably delicious. I was excited to make these--and I am SO glad I did! The banana has incredible flavor in here. I did make modifications, using buckwheat flour in place of all-purpose. Added cinnamon and vanilla (a must-add for me to most things I make!) I halved the recipe, but I still used the whole egg. I sprinkled one with chopped walnuts and it was great--chocolate chips might be a nice touch. **I followed the recommendations of others and cooked a little slower to make sure they didn't seem mushy. They were perfection! Will post photos soon. YUM! Great for anyone who likes banana bread!

These are some of the best pancakes I have ever eaten. The only thing i added was a little cinnamon. It makes the perfect amount for four people and they are really fast. If you want to make them really good spread some chunky peanut butter on them before your syrup and they are so delcious. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I use this base everytime I make banana pancakes now.  It's great as is or if you want to get more nutrition out of them...you can always sub in half of the flour for whatever you want- (I doubled the recipe so I used) 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup of ground flax and 1/4 cup of wheat bran.  You can also sub in different things for the milk.  I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 apple juice.  I also added in vanilla and nutmeg and they were awesome.  Great recipe. Great banana flavour!

These are AWESOME! We spread a caramel sauce and toasted nuts or macadamia nuts over the top. Mash the bananas kinda chunky, mix all the wet ingredients in, mix dry ingredients together in a bowl, then add to the wet. Whip the eggs whites into stiff egg whites. and fold them in right before grilling.

Absolutely delicious. I now make gluten/dairy free by using rice flour and almond milk (and omit the sugar), but I have used whole wheat flour and buttermilk instead of milk (and 1/2 tsp. baking soda to partially compensate for the acidity). ONLY USED HALF OF THE OIL! The secret is to mix VERY lightly, as little as you can, then not mix again, for the fluffiest pancakes. These did not even need syrup!

Loved 'em!!  I followed many reviewers suggestions and added 1/2 tsp vinilla, and 1/4 tsp cinnamin.  I also found the suggestion of mashing the bananas in a ziploc bag very useful.

These were very frustrating for me.  I could not get them to cook correctly - I tried thinning the batter, making it thicker, cooking it on low heat, cooking it on medium heat...no matter what they were gooey and gross!  I wasted a lot of time and ingredients.

I have NO idea what happened to my mixture, but after waiting 15 minutes for 1 side of the pancake to brown so I could flip it, I got frustrated and used another recipe. If it took that long for one, I had no idea how long it would take to make them all! On the plus side, I have some nice banana mix in my fridge. :) Anyone know what could have happened??

These are some amazing pancakes! I substitued 1/4 of the flour with spelt flour for added nutrients and for a nutty flavor. Also added vanilla and a few dashes of cinnamon. They cooked up wonderfully!

Definitely puree the wet ingredients. Along with vanilla and cinnamon others recommend try omitting the sugar and using  ice milk or half ice cream/half milk in place of just milk. smelled like banana bread cooking. yummy. this is a keeper

When I made this recipe I thought they were great. But as I was cooking them my son asked me why I did not add any cinnamon. So I quickly dashed cinnamon in the remaining batter and it was even better!! Great recipe!!

This recipe did not work for me. When
I made the pancakes as written, the 
pancakes were really runny, so I added
another half cup of flour. The pancakes
cooked up flat. The end result is a 
dense pancake that tastes really rich.

For cooks that like that, this recipe
would be perfect. This recipe just 
wasn't for us. We like fluffier pancakes.

I made a double batch of these and ended up freezing about 8 for breakfast later this week. After reading other reviews I too added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the double batch. This recipe is awesome and not at all mushy in my opinion. Next time I will probably add some toasted walnuts or pecans just for variety but they are definitely not required to make these pancakes great. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I don't really understand what everyone else saw in this recipe, or what I did wrong.  These pancakes never cooked through...not just mushy in the middle, but actually uncooked.  I had to throw 2 batches away.  Sorry.

Holy monkey!  These were outstanding... cooked up big and delicious and fat!  I used very ripe bananas, which I hear is important - it sure seemed to come across here.  Oh, also - they're not particularly sweet on their own.  It makes them perfect with syrup, but if you have other plans you might want to adjust the sugar.  Thanks so much!

I must admit, I didn't taste these pancakes--I hate bananas.  However, I made them for my 16 month old, because I'm trying to get him to eat fruit.  He really enjoyed them and I enjoyed how easy they were to make.  The only changes I made were using half wheat flour, half white flour and only using 1 1/2 bananas.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are my favorite pancakes!  I use soy milk and one large banana instead of 2 so they aren't mushy.  I make these at least once a week!  So delicious with the Blueberry Sauce recipe submitted by Isybel.  Make sure to cook slowly on LOW heat as others have suggested and they will be perfect!

Delicious!  I gave it four stars  because the recipe exactly as given didn't work for me.  I had to add more milk.  Which is, of course, no big deal!  It has an awesome banana taste, and for half of them I added chocolate chips Mmmmmmm!

Our new favorite pancake recipe!
We did as other reviewers suggested and substituted 1/2 all purpose flour + 1/2 wheat flour for the 1 cup of flour, substituted 2 Tbsp. (30g) butter  for the vegetable oil, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and browned the bananas before mixing them in.

These pancakes have always worked for me, so I thought I should finally write a review.  I substitute half whole wheat flour, and decrease bananas to 1 or 1.5.  It is important to cook these on low heat if you want to avoid the mushiness, or they might get too "browned" before cooking on the inside.  I also add some cinnamon and vanilla for some extra kick.  Finally, it doesn't matter what order the ingredients are added, it seems!  Highly recommmended.

These were really nice.  I added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon as these spices go really well with the flavor of bananas.

We love these pancakes!  Dense and hearty - a nice change from your standard buttermilk pancakes.  Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because we do modify it with vanilla, cinnamon & walnuts.

My son woke up on a rainy school holiday and asked for banana pancakes.  I had never made them before but he had ordered them at a local breakfast place. I looked this recipe up and tryed it because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I only used one banana, added a dash of cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla based on the reviews.  He loved the results.  The texture was perfect, they cooked to a nice golden brown.  So easy to make.  If I was making this recipe for adults, I would add some chopped nuts.  This is a great pancake recipe! Try it.

Great recipe!  I've enjoyed it for awhile now, and we really enjoy this one.
  To simplify and achieve a cream, smoother texture, puree the bananas and wet ingredients in your blender.  Mix/sift together dry ingredients and add to blender.  Puree until smooth and then pour from blender container onto griddle!

This pancake is great! I had run out of plain flour so I used self-raising flour, but without the baking powder. I have a sweet tooth so I added another two tablespoons of sugar and only one banana. These pancakes were gone in less than a minute!

I was really surprised by the soft texture. In fact, I was sure I'd done something wrong! lol But they're soooo yummy. Tastes so much like eating banana bread that next time I'm going to try adding nuts next time. We always have extra bananas laying around, so I know I'll making these again.

Delicious!!!  My 4 year old daughter devoured her portion, which says a lot because she's not much of a pan cake fan.  To jazz up the final presentation, I served them with maple syrup and real whipped cream enhanced with a bit of brandy extract.  Now we all know how well bananas and brandy pair together, so it almost goes without saying that I was in breakfast heaven this morning!!  Thanks Andrea for this excellent recipe!  I will be using it often.

I did make some changes right away after the experience I’ve had making big fluffy pancakes: 3 tsp baking powder instead of 2 (helps them rise) and cut the milk to 1/2 cup as there’s added moisture from bananas and oil. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla and used a hand mixer to get the wet ingredients well mixed with bananas. Worked great and my pancakes turned out perfect!

Loved it! Followed the recommendations to add applesauce instead of vegetable oil, added cinnamon and vainilla, and these came out amazing! Big thanks to the reviewer that emphasized cooking on low so these would cook through. I always burn my pancakes (at least one) and this time, they came out absolutely delicious and golden brown. Had some batter left over so I guess it’s banana pancakes tomorrow morning! Yummm! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I added 1/3 cup brown sugar to the recipe and it turned the recipe into extraordinary! I don’t like pancakes but my family does. Not only did they live them but these were so good that I actually ate and really liked them.

Around the 6th pancake I figured out that they’re not gonna be super fluffy because of the bananas, and that they will also have a little more of a mushy texture. Overall they’re quite good and also super easy to make.

I just made these and honestly they were dank!!! I've made banana pancakes before but I never smashed the bananas up and put them in the batter. I've cut banana pieces and laid them on top of the batter so they can cook together. For this recipe I used a fairly hard banana and left ocassional banana chunks in the batter because that's how I wanted them to be. These pancakes were perfect for my taste

These were delicious! I only had almond milk, so I used that, and left out the oil (accidentally) but they were amazing. I ate them with a little bit of natural peanut butter. Heaven on a plate and very fluffy.

OMG These were There Most Amazing Pancakes I have ever made!!! (Don't tell my mom I said that...!!!)
I followed the instructions as written, and these pancakes came out perfectly. I make pancakes a lot, so my family's used to them, but they were impressed with these. Definitely a keeper!

Now, these pancakes were amazing on their own, but I upped the awesome-ness in some even more. once I put the batter on the griddle, I added 5-6 blueberries as it cooked. Blueberry banana pancakes. I don't think this can be outdone!

Made this today. I changed the recipe a bit. I used vanilla and original almond milk (all I had) then added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and cinnamon. These were very moist! Will make again. Anyone have a low carb recipe for these?

Really good no frills banana pancakes. I did use butter instead of vegetable oil to make it healthier. Cooking them on a lower temp made a big difference, keeping them from burning on the outside.

These are excellent, but do be aware they are going to be very moist compared to a regular pancake. I made dark chocolate chunk banana pancakes with this recipe. I subbed the oil with applesauce which I think cut down on the moisture, which they needed. I also used super ripe bananas I had allowed to sit in my fridge for a few weeks after they had turned black on the counter, which really upped the banana flavor.  I threw in a dash of cinnamon as well. I didn't have issues with them being overly flat, considering how dense the batter is. I don't know if it's because I allowed my batter to rest for 15 minutes or so or what. Either way they were very banana-ey and were great with peanut butter.

Very delicious but also very runny, I ended up adding two teaspoons of starch before it was workable, and like many others, I also added a 1/2teaspoon of vanilla. Very yummy and light :)
P.S. you can also substitute the bananas in this and put about a cup of blueberries! Yumm :)

These came out great! Not overly sweet and I even added vanilla and a little bit of honey to enhance the flavor.  I only had 1 1/2 medium sized bananas but still worked out great.  I cooked the pancakes on a lower temp and cooked a little longer than usual  so that they would cook completely through (as one person said they were mushy), then I used a teaspoon of vegetable oil and then a tablespoon  of coconut oil instead as I have been on a coconut oil kick lately.    I ended up with about 10 perfect pancakes that hopefully the kids will enjoy as much as I did.  I also made peanut butter syrup which is easy to make just add a tablespoon or so of Jiff All Natural peanut butter to a cup of maple syrup, heat it up until peanut butter is melted then stir well.  Next time I might even add mini chocolate chips! :)

These are amazing and soooooo tasty.
I used half and half plain flour and wholemeal and added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Also subbed the oil for melted butter. These are so tender and delicious, will definitely keep this recipe in rotation.

My grandchildren call these Nana's Banana Pancakes.  They like to help so there are enough ingredients to go around. I use only one banana and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. To make them extra special, add a banana and strawberry smiley face on top.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla and only used 1.5 medium-sized bananas. It had to be cooked on medium-low temperature otherwise it would burn but wouldn't cook through. I like my pancakes to be a bit on the sweeter side (but I don't use much syrup) so I used two tablespoons of sugar.  Thought it was quite good but since adjustments had to be made, not a 5 star. Also, these weren't fluffy. I wonder if its even possible to make fluffy banana pancakes given the weight of the banana dough.

I always add a tsp of vanilla.  my son loves it!!  11/3/15  I love the recipe just the way it is but to make less sugar and oil I did no sugar, 1 tbsp oil, and 2 tbsp apple sauce.  It was even better than the original :-)

Replaced the milk for almond milk, cooked in coconut oil, added mini chocolate chips, and used brown sugar instead of the white, grapeseed oil instead of vegetable. Kept all the measurements the same, and turned out AMAZING. I will never make pancakes another way. Lots of changes I know, but its what I had.

Amazing! I made banana chocolate waffles by adding a 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. I also made these 50% whole wheat flour and added a splash of extra milk, a tsp of vanilla and a pinch more baking powder.

Just made these as a little birthday treat for myself and they were awesome! I make ugly pancakes so no pictures to share. I added some vanilla, cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, and some chopped walnuts and topped them with a drizzle of honey and some whipped cream. LOVE!

Omg! This pancakes are delicious! We eat a lit of pancakes of different kinds and this recipe is hands down my family's favorite. I let bananas get old just so we can make this recipe. I do add cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and vanilla just because I think it makes it just over the top even better but even as is these are crazy delicious!

These were fantastic! I doubled the recipe including adding 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I also added two strips of bacon I had, diced up! Behold Banana Bacon Pancakes! I didn't have anymore bacon, but I would have added 4 strips.

The flavor is amazing in these pancakes. The only thing I found was, they stuck to my pan a bit more than usual. I added the usual spices cinnamon, nutmeg and added vanilla. To keep my husband happy, I threw in some frozen blueberries. The combination was great.
Thanks for the great recipe!

I used whole wheat flour and added frozen blueberries to the pancakes as they were cooking on the griddle. Also added the vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon. My husband and son both loved them!

I have found that by measuring the dry ingredients and then putting them through a shifter makes for fluffy pancakes. I also substitute melted butter for the oil, I mix the liquid ingredients including the egg and then add the liquid mixture to the dry and stir to mixed, add two whole banannas and using a potato masher, mush them well. I use 1/4 cup measure per pancake. For thinner add a bit more milk.

These were fantastic with a few changes and some careful cooking.  I only used 1/2 cup milk, and replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour (to be healthier, but to be honest I ran out of regular flour).  I added 1 tsp vanilla extract as a few other reviewers did.  I also made sure to cook them more "low and slow" than I usually do with pancakes.  I had to throw out a few when the pan got too hot...the outside got burnt and the inside mushy when it was too hot, just as some other reviewers found.  But low and slow worked great!  I added some chocolate chips and my kids loved them just plain... I loved them with almond butter and a small drizzle of pure maple syrup.  Yum!

I will always come back to this recipe. Be prepared for the end result to feel more like a banana than a pancake. The pancakes are mushy and soft and quite delicious. 

Nutella on top. Do it.

It was just ok. I only had 1% milk but I sifted the dry ingredients and used 1 1/2 slightly underripe bananas to keep the pancakes from getting too wet. The flavor was good but the pancakes didn't brown all that well and were fairly flat. I forgot the vanilla & cinnamon some reviewers were recommending but this recipe needs some tweaking I believe.

This recipe was awesome, and I use the same recipe for blueberry pancakes I just substitute the bananas. The only adjustment I had to make was to add an extra tablespoon of sugar.

Great pancakes! Added 1/4cup quick oats plus bit of cinnamon and vanilla to remind us of the banana bread we like. Loved to eat mine with peanut butter instead of syrup.

"Maybe we can sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now..."
These pancakes were delicious and well worth the extra effort (compared to a mix).  So put on the Jack Johnson music, make these pancakes, and enjoy!

Followed this recipe to the T.  Not enough something in it.  Maybe salt?  Very bland.  If a person has to change it up even just a little then the recipe isnt good.  Sorry,  we didnt like it one bit.

I made a few substitutions because I was out of eggs, milk, and oil.  I used EnerG egg replacer, soy milk, and coconut oil instead.  WOW!  These were fantastic and accidentally vegan.

cut the milk to 1.5 cups, used butter and not oil, and added 1/4c flour  for a doubled recipe - pretty darn good

These pancakes tasted good but the instructions are off. You should not make pancakes over medium high heat! If you do that, the cakes are black on the outside and liquid in the middle. Pancakes should be cooked on medium low and flipped when bubbles are rising to the surface. That is the proper technique for golden pancakes. I followed the recipe as written other than temperature, but I feel like it would have benefitted from some vanilla.

These are by far the best pancakes I have ever had in my life, homemade or otherwise. I leave out the sugar and oil and they still taste great. Top with pecans and powdered sugar for a real treat or add a few chocolate chips to each pancake while they're cooking to mix things up a bit. No matter which version you make, I can't recommend them enough.

Based on reviews, I used 1.5 bananas, added 1tsp cinnamon & 1/2tsp vanilla, subbed 1TBS applesauce for one of the TBS oil, and cooked on low. The first batch was flat and too wet. The second batch came out much better - I added an extra 1/4cup flour and upped the heat to medium to set/brown, then finished on low to allow the center to cook through. they behaved much more like normal pancakes and were delicious!

Good pancakes! I used melted coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil. The banana and coconut seemed like a good combo. My kids insisted I also add a large handful of chocolate chips to half the batter. I followed other suggestions and put in a 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the batter as well. I will make these again and perhaps try adding some crushed walnuts. Thank-you.

Very good pancakes. Giving 4 stars because as other reviewers mentioned, they definitely need about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Also they must be pretty small pancakes. I made 1 and 1/2x the recipe and got exactly 12 pancakes. Will make again.

I had some bananas that were pretty brown.  I didn't want to waste them so looked up this recipe.  

Changes I made:
I saw a post that someone used a ziplock for easy mashing but I used a potato masher.  Added the egg and mashed some more.  I didnt have any lumps.  

I omitted the oil.  Didn't see the sense, especially when I saw another post that the batter was on the runny side. 

I didn't have vanilla (darn) but I had cinnamon!  Oh and I had some chocolate chips to throw in.  Ummmm would be good with some blueberries too I bet.  

And I used Pam.    These were really good.   Yay!

love these pancakes!! i moved to Denmark so i can't get ahold of any decent pancake mix without spending an arm and a leg. this was the perfect solution, and by far better and much cheaper than any out-of-the-box or even diner pancakes.

This recipe came out great! The only reason I didn't give it 5 out of 5 is because I had to add more flour to the mix than the recipe called for. So it wasn't a "perfect recipe" I gobbled these up this morning in seconds! I used brown sugar in mine and added cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla as I don't like syrup so I put all the flavor in my pancake. I also added 1/2 tsp of lemon juice as I do with many of my pancakes (the acid helps break the gluten that forms from the liquid and water which makes a gummy pancake) just to be safe! I've been searching for an easy banana pancake recipe for awhile and this is one of the best I've ran into. I'll definitely be making homemade pancakes more often!

I added an addition half of the amount of every ingredient but bananas, and these turned out to have a perfect texture! Moist, but also fluffy. (For example, add 1/2C flour, 1/2 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, etc....) I also added 1/3C total of sunflower seeds and pecans, both toasted. Delicious!

Made some minor changes to this recipe and LOVED how my pancakes turned out.
-Substituted veg oil for coconut oil (melted over stove top)
-Took out the sugar
-Added mini chocolate chips (just a little)
-Added the egg in 2 parts (first added the yolk to the liquid ingredient mix, then folded in the egg-white to the mixture after combining both the dry and wet mixes together)

Great recipe after a bit of tweaking.  I reduced the banana to only one large over-ripe banana for that quantity of flour and used a potato masher to ensure it was fully mashed.  I sifted the dry ingredients together and added a couple of dashes of ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg. I added a splash of vanilla to the wet ingredients.  Like one of the reviewers said, the pancakes turn out better if you cook them at a lower temperature to make sure the inner part of the pancake gets fully cooked (I do this with all fruit pancakes as well as with chocolate chip pancakes). Even though I reduced the amount of banana, they still had a strong banana taste.

I had no milk on hand, so I substituted with three quarters of a cup of heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup of almond milk. I've never eaten a more flavorful moist pancake in my life. I will make these again and again!

Wow!  Easy, fast, fabulous!  Literally took 3 minutes to make batter.  I omitted oil entirely and used 2 mashed bananas and 1 tsp. vanilla.  Also, I toasted 1/4 c. pecans and tossed into batter.  I let batter sit for 15 mins. and it seemed to thicken slightly.  The pancakes were so flavorful you could have eaten without syrup.  Best testimonial - My 3 yr. old granddaughter asked for seconds.  Could serve these for any special occasion... dollop of whipped cream and a few chopped pecans over top.

My son and I enjoy eating these pancakes. I make sure that the bananas are crushed really well (no big lumps). This makes the pancakes easier to flip. Letting the batter rest for about 30 mins also helps the pancakes to flip better.

The taste is delicious, but my batter was way to watery. I had the add more flour to my batter.

Yuck! I have made a ton of recipes on this site with much success.these pancakes were much too moist almost doughy.
I thought it sounded like a lot of banana in ratio to 
the flour mixture and I was correct! Will not be making these again. Much better pancake recipes on this site.

This recipe is amazing! Instead of one tablespoon white sugar, i did half a tablespoon white sugar and half light brown sugar. I added vanilla extract as advised in lots of the reviews. I topped it off with sliced bananas and a bit of whipped cream below the maple syrup, delicious! Next time will add some cinnamon to it...Will DEFINITELY keep making this!

I am giving this recipe only 3 stars because of the issues with the batter consistency. I had to add at least two more cups of flour before it was even close to the right thickness.  It was way too runny at first, but it was wonderful later. I only changed the amount of flour and none of the other ingredients needed adjusting.

WOW! This pancakes recipe is so good. Now you ask why so low stars. Well in less you are an experienced pancake maker and understand the ratio of wet ingredients to dry ingredients there should be in a pancake batter, it will never turn out well. No one has the same size bananas. And this can completely change the ratio. I doubled the recipe to begin with so I could freeze some.  Before I even mixed the wet to dry ingredients I knew it was way off by looking at the amount of dry to wet. I went ahead and deiced to cook one as is and it was a mess. So I mixed up all the dry ingredients listed above and added it slowly to the already made batter until it was the right consistency.  The kids loved it.

These never seemed to completely cook all the way through, remained really "doughy" in the middle. Taste very good though. Also seemed to tear apart when we tried to put butter on the top. Not sure if too much banana, since vary in size so much, wished they had said how much actual banana to use, for example, 1 cup. That may fix the problem. May try again & adjust amount of the fruit down to see if that is the case.

I've tried these twice. Both times they got major compliments from my kids. The first time I made them the only changes were to use coconut oil instead of veg oil and I added a little vanilla extract.  The second time I actually used 1 banana and about 1/2 cup of pineapple. I blended both up before adding the beaten egg, milk and oil. I noticed that the second version was actually easier to cook on the griddle and less mushy than the all-banana version. But both were really tasty. Makes about 17 3-4 inch pancakes. Plenty to freeze for another morning.

I made these this morning for my boyfriend and I.  He's picky and didn't even want to try them, he did and loved them!  I toasted some old-fashioned oatmeal in a frying pan on the stove and added about 1/2 a cup to the recipe.  I also toasted 1/2 cup of pecans, chopped them up in my food processor very fine and added those.  These are delicious!

it seemed like it needed more sugar?? maybe not since some people like pancakes swimming in syrup.. maybe half a TBS more?
They came out nice, but maybe more milk to thin the recipe since everyone was saying that it was mushy in the center.. that would probably solve the problem.. and the pan/griddle might have been too hot.. I should have added vanilla extract.. but it was too late.. next time.. So instead of making banana bread with the old bananas, make pancakes!
Served with walnuts and this would be banging!
Thanks for the recipe

I just made these for my daycare kids.  I think the beauty of this recipe is it is easily adaptable.  I had some left over buttermilk and used that.  I used brown sugar, as it seems like it always works well with bananas.  I did add vanilla, as many had suggested and also used half whole wheat flour.  They turned out great!  Instead of syrup I served them with vanilla frozen yogurt, which kind of melted over them and then a tiny bit of chocolate syrup.  Regular syrup did not do them justice.  Easily could have been served as a more gourmet item at a bed and breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wish I could have really eaten these, because I think they would have turned out great. But they never would cook all the way through! I was so disappointed! No matter how low I turned the temp. down, it didn't cook the inside of it.

These are pretty good.  Easy to make and fairly quick to cook.  Only issue was that i found that the flavour wasn't so strong.  Had to add a lot of condiments and if i was gonna do that i woulda made plain pancakes.

Best pancakes ever. I used Blue Agave instead of sugar (and less milk to adjust for the liquid) but as long as the bananas are ripe, that's all the sweetness needed. We had fresh strawberries on the side. So good!

Simply amazing recipe! I'd bought overripe bananas from my grocery store at the end of the night when they're on clearance ($.42 for 4 bananas!) so was looking for something to do with them. This recipe is DELICIOUS! Most recipes don't use enough bananas to really infuse it with the flavor, but this one is perfect. I added in walnuts and some cinnamon and vanilla extract. You could easily add in strawberry jam or bits of strawberries.

This recipe gets a 5 because not only is it delicious, it's extremely versatile!

Tasty pancakes!  I messed with it a bit based on other reviews-- added about 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk, because I had some to get rid of.  And I threw some leftover blueberries into one of them, and that was my favorite.

Delicious pancakes! I took the advice of some of the reviewers, using only 1 banana and cooking them slowly on low/mid heat so they were cooked through. I also used 1/2 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and they were more dense, but I expected that and still thought they were wonderful, just like banana bread on the griddle! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe :)

These are really good. Low and slow is the key for these. Don't rush cooking them. I followed entire recipe and they turned out delicious (did make sure to sift dry ingredients). Almost like a treat. I like to put whipped cream on mine, with a sprinkle of nutmeg and a smidge of syrup on top. Of course, I ate 2 standing at the stove before I got to the topping point. Yummy!

Wonderfully delish! I actually used the 2 Tbsp of chunky applesauce instead of oil and used 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. They turned out perfect on the griddle-made 13 of them and I used a homemade syrup of sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, flour, vanilla and water. Seriously the best pancakes I have ever made ;)

Th batter and cooked pancakes smell great.  But even though the pancakes appear to be cooked thoroughly, they are mushy inside and are rubbery.

Yum....my 3 year-old and I were eating them plain off the griddle! I did use 3/4 c milk with 2 T vinegar (buttermilk substitute) and mashed my bananas with a little brown sugar and vanilla. I omitted the oil because I felt the batter didn't need any. These pancakes weren't as fluffy as the Fluffy Pancakes from this site (my favorite pancake recipe, from which I compare all other pancake recipes), hence the 4-star rating. They were a tad doughy, however, I love them that way! My husband said they tasted like banana bread. We'll make these tasty little gems again!

This is a great recipe.  I used two frozen bananas and once I defrosted them they were a bit more wet than fresh bananas, so I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and this gave a good consistnecy.  I added 1/2 t. vanilla as others suggested.  Oh, and prep and cook time was more than 15 minutes for me, for sure. Will make again.

I'm having a hard time understanding the hype over these pancakes.  They just aren't fluffy enough for me and lack a good amount of flavor.  We use the Fluffy Pancakes recipe on this site, and they are much better.

These were easy to make and delicious! The only issue with them is the moistness of the banana makes them harder to cook all the way through; low heat and slow cooking is necessary. But even for the batches that were mushy in the middle, they tasted great.

I used frozen black-eyed peas cooked in vegetable broth for 30 minutes with a little chopped ham thrown in, then I followed the recipe as given (I only had dried red peppers), adjusting liquid as needed. We try to cut back on meat, so I'll give it a try without ham or bacon next time. This is a delicious side, but with a salad and cornbread it would make a meal for us.

I have never made pancakes from scratch, but these were easy. I doubled the recipe because I had four ripe nananas and it made a lot, but they were good!!!!!

Excellent recipe. I may not have put enough sugar because I felt like they needed a little more. Soft and delicious definitely a keeper recipe.

great base recipe - fast and easy. I used half whole wheat flour and added 1/3c raw sunflower seeds for some crunch, and only used 1 teaspoon of canola oil in the batter.  Hearty and delicious!

These are yummie!  I add a little extra flour to make them thicker and I also add cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  I cooked them on medium low as someone else suggested on my nonstick skillet and they come out perfect (not gooey on the inside)!

This was my first attempt at banana pancakes, and your recipe was easy to follow.  My kids raved about the pancakes, and I didn't even get one!  We'll be making this recipe again for certain.  I did add some vanilla and only used one banana (it was all I had) but those were the only modifications I made.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Took others suggestions and omitted sugar, instead added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, dash pumpkin pie spice, & crushed walnuts.  Family loved them!  Will make again.

These were absolutely delicious! I substituted 2/3 of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour, and didn't add the sugar at all. I also used almond milk in place of cow's milk, and it came out really great!

These are so much more than pancakes with mashed bananas in them.  I used applesauce instead of oil and whole wheat flour.  After reading the reviews I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  For my family of six I doubled the recipe.  This is definitely going in the favorites file.

Excellent!  I just made these using whole wheat flour and they were incredible, so I'm positive they could only become more tasty with white.

Really great. Made as written.  Used thawed frozen over-ripe bananas which made incorporation into the other ingredients really easy. Next time, I'll replace the oil with apple sauce as I think that would work just fine.

Great banana flavor and not too sweet- we didn't even need to top wit butter and syrup.  Per other reviewers, I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon vanilla, then stirred in a handfull of chopped pecans at the end.  For the kids I topped the pancakes with milk chocolate chips after I poured the batter onto the hot griddle.

These are pretty tasty! I made some health-nut tweaks that I won't bother listing, and I also replaced the regular milk with buttermilk, which made a lovely contrast with my overripe sweet bananas. At 5am, I didn't want to take any unnecessary risks of undercooked batter, so I sliced the bananas instead of mashing them and scattered them over the batter I had just poured into the pan -- on each individual uncooked pancake. Upon the first bite, my husband gave off a deep, loud "MMMM!" and told me they were delicious. Thank you!

Flavor was great but these ended up as FLAT pancakes, and we prefer a fluffier pancake (unless they're INTENDED to be Swedish-style or crepes, of course)... Next time I'll try maybe sifting the flour, and/or whipping up the egg whites to peaks first, or adding an extra egg to fluffen them up some.  I did add a dash of cinnamon and a glug of vanilla, but I ALWAYS do this to my pancakes and never had it affect the fluffy-factor, just the flavor =)  Mine definitely did NOT end up looking like the ones in the picture... just sayin'...

I followed this recipe, but sprinkled a little cinnamon (we love cinnamon) to the dry ingredients.  They were a hit!  I added pecan pieces for fun and they also turned out great.  I used very ripe bananas, so mashing them with the whisk was easy.  The batter is a little looser than normal pancake batter, but not by much and I did not have a problem with cooking them.  I used a 1/4 cup measure and it worked perfectly.  They spread round and even.  We make them every time we have ripe bananas (which is rare in my house).  UPDATE (9/24/11):  For those that thought the batter was too loose, I suggest cutting the milk down to 3/4 cup and increasing the baking soda to 3 teaspoons.  It does add for a fluffier pancake and not as loose as the original recipe.  I also have used organic whole wheat flour, as it is denser and drier, so it complements the wet ingredients well.  This recipe works very well with 100% whole wheat flour.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I think it's ruined regular pancakes for me! I followed the directions exactly and they turn out amazing every time! I like to serve with powdered sugar, nutella and fresh slices of banana because I think the contrast in texture of the cooked banana and fresh is delightful!

excellent recipe for pancakes.  FYI, i use a variety of flours in my pancakes (whole wheat, spelt, quinoa, buckwheat) and they generally taste fine and are healthy.  I also added chopped almonds to these for the protein and it was improved by them...

make sure you had the heat on lower than higher... i don't know if it's because of the bananas but these tend to burn/carmelize quick  otherwise these are one of the yummiest pancakes to make and eat!! YUM!

fantastic!  To make it more my own, I added vanilla, a dash of cinnamon, a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  I also ran the bananas through the blender--which left some chunks--because of that I followed someone's advice and cooked them slowly over a lower flame. They were great-tasted more like banana bread--yum!

Great concept.  I just thought it was a bit bland.  I will try next time w/ vanilla n cinnamon and sifting dry ingredients first.  I am also excited to try the peanut butter syrup recipe.

These are so easy to make and they are my son's absolute favorite.  They're really sweet though.  So, we tend to eat them plain or with apple sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly but added 1 Tblsp of vanilla and these were excellent! Make sure to use very ripe bananas for full flavor.

I did not change this recipe at all and it was very good. My husband liked it too. It tastes so homemade :) and better than pancake mix from the store. More filling and less processed.

This is my favourite pancake recipe ever and I don't usually like pancakes. I make them with whole wheat flour and two tablespoons wheat germ.

Very good pancakes.  Mine were not the most attractive looking, possible due to adding cinnamon which gave the batter a different color.    These are my changes:  I used brown sugar instead of white, omitted the oil.  I doubled all ingredients, but used 3 large bananas.  I added 1 TB of cinnamon (we LOVE it) and 2 tsp vanilla.  Doubling the recipe was probably not necessary, it just seemed like it would make than I am used to (Aunt Jemima mix).  All 4 of us ate and we have leftovers.  I made the pancakes a bit smaller than I usually do, as I read concerns about them being mushy inside.  I also cooked at 300* on my electric griddle.  After we had breakfast, I thought of something that would make these really outstanding.  Paula Deen has a pecan syrup recipe posted on Food Network site.  It is outstanding!

These were amazing! I used 1 1/2 bananas and added vanilla like the reviewers suggested. They were light and fluffy, and the banana flavor was not too overpowering. It was more of a banana aftertaste. Yum!

These were amazing! The only alterations I made were adding a tbsp of vanilla and chocolate chips! A previous review was right, cook them on a lower heat or they'll be brown on the outside but raw in the middle. I can't wait to eat these again :D

Fantastic Recipe!  i used all organic ingredients, subbed brown sugar for white, soy milk, and added nuts and flax!  Used the peanut butter syrup recipe and subbed almond milk for the water.  (Milk protein allergy sufferer safe!)

Great recipe!  I actually doubled the entire thing except for the bananas and they still had a good amount of banana flavor - I think if I would have doubled the bananas it would have been too much.  Also added vanilla and rolled oats to the recipe, and subbed the oil with applesauce.  I experimented with other toppings and found that adding shredded coconut, chopped pecans, and cinnamon was delish!!  Will definitely make again

My family loves breakfast for dinner, so I made these last night, served with fresh fruit and turkey bacon.  I doubled the recipe, followed it exactly as written.  The batter was rather thin, so next time I will decrease the milk....but they are delicious!  Everyone loved them.  I will definitely make these again.

These pancakes were so easy to put together and they smelled fantastic cooking this morning.  I topped them with fresh banana and some maple syrup.  I replaced the oil with applesauce.  I didn't notice any mushiness.  It was missing a little sweetness in the batter for me, so next time I might indulge my sweet tooth and add a little more sugar.  Overall, it was a great way to start the morning! Thank you for the recipe!

As is, these are delicious. However, for a twist to the healthier side, try adding a 1/3 of a cup of oats, a handful of diced strawberries and a tsp of vanilla. Yum!

Easy, fun and delicious.  Every bite is full of banana ( I smashed them up pretty consistently but not enough where there aren't chunks) and once they hit the frying pan, the smell is amazing :) I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract (I add it to everything) to add a bit of flavor.  Must try!!

I added a little vanilla and cinnamon per other reviews and the flavor was really good, but they turned out mushy inside.  Next time I will try cooking them longer at a lower heat so they cook through.

Very good- the oil is not needed at all, since the bananas provide a lot of moisture.  I just plain didn't use it.  I wouldn't recommend skimping on it if you're planning on using an ungreased griddle or cast iron, because the oil content helps keep them from sticking in these circumstances, but if you're using nonstick, just leave the oil out.  They're fine without added fat.

I think these pancakes have a great taste. I added the extra vanilla most of the other cooks said and they tasted awesome. However, I found the pancakes to be very lumpy and the batter very thick. You MUST cook on a low temperature otherwise the pancakes will be mushy inside. Also, I tried to add more milk to lighten up the batter... BIG MISTAKE! If you want to add more milk, you must add a little bit more of everything other ingredient, if not, the batter will be completely ruined.

Real flavorful and great, but I made a few healthy substitutions: I used Fiber One box mix, substituted the sugar for a tbsp. of vanilla extract, the oil for no sugar added apple sauce, added a tbsp. of natural honey. Topped it with banana slices and chopped walnuts. My husband couldn't stop saying hmmmm.

Absolutely the best pancakes I've ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I used a potato masher to mash the bananas with egg, milk and oil.  They came out light, fluffy and as my 3 yr old would say, scrum-dum-delicious!

Ok people so this is what I did, I thought why mash the bananas? So i cut them up into little chunks instead added some vanilla and cinnamon. They were delicious!! Cooked them on medium, I wonder if some oatmeal could even be added.. will try that next time.

A good and different way to use up the ripe bananas. I added some cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. THX

These were great and so easy!  My one year old cleared her tray!  And my husband ate it!  (He hates pancakes)  I sprinkled some chocolate chips on while they were cooking.  Yummy!  Next time I might not add the sugar and use part wheat flour.  Make it a little healthier :)

The taste of these were delicious. I even took the recommendation of one of the others and made peanut butter syrup. My husband was annoyed with me though, while making them I played Jack Johnson's Banana Pancakes on our surround sound over and over again. LOL:) I did have them turn out with soft middles. Maybe I didn't cook them long enough on a low enough heat. But I will definetly be making these again and soon! Maybe I will leave the music turned down this time:):)

The batter was too moist and very hard to cook all the way through.  It had a different taste.  I should have stayed with a regular pancake recipe.

Although, they tasted pretty good, I found the texture just a little too mushy. Still a nice change from an ordinary pancake, though.

So full of flavor!  These won over my skeptical family who really prefer my tried and true pancakes to any "flavored junk". :D  I've tried caramel apple pancakes, cinnamon apple pancakes, pumpkin pancakes, peanut butter pancakes, all to no avail. FINALLY!  I have flavor respite!

I'm not sure if it was me over mixing it or what, but these turned out flat and gummy. They tasted great, though. In retrospect I should have tried adding more flour to thicken the batter. They cooked all the way through, though so in that respect they were not mushy.

Delicious!  My family doesn't really like anything in their pancakes and they loved this recipe!! Very simple.   Please note: You have to cook on low, low, low :)! I love cooking on med/high but this recipe will burn.  It takes longer to cook the pancake but you don't want the outside done before the inside! :) That's the only tip I have.  Patience! :)

Flat & Bland. I like fluffy pancakes and these pancakes were extremely flat, dry, and bland. They looked nothing like the picture and tasted not that well.  Perhaps, I overstirred it because there were little to no lumps, however, the taste was still poor, therefore I'm giving this recipe 2 stars.

This was the first time I made banana pancakes.  It was wonderful and my husband loved them too!  I added a tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon as suggested by another review.  However, I didn't want lumps of banana in my batter so I mixed all the liquid ingredients and banana in a blender.  I then added the dry ingredients and blended well.  No lumps, no mess and I could pour right from the pitcher to the griddle.  I was able to get 20 pancakes this way!  This is a new household favorite!

I couldn't find regular pancakes on the Allrecipes App I downloaded to my phone. But this worked great- I don't like bananas so I took them out- added butter instead of oil- didn't have white sugar, so I used brown- which added a wonderful deep & rich taste. This is a great base recipe. Next time I'll try adding nuts &/or vanilla- endless options!

I hate bananas but loved these!  I used only one and a half bananas and sliced up the other half to put on the finished pancakes for those who actually like bananas.  I also added a half tsp vanilla, will definitely be making these again!

I have never had banana pancakes before.  I made this for the 1st time and added a little bit of cinnamon to it. They were so good!  I omitted the oil and used nonstick spray and it worked wonders!  So easy to flip them! I also used 3 very ripe medium bananas since that is what I had to use up. I cut down on the suger a tad bit. I cooked them on low with a lid on to be sure they cooked through. Kept them warm in the oven which also helped to cook it through. Thanks for the great recipe!

Pretty good pancakes.  Make sure your bananas are super ripe.  One note though- don't substitute applesauce for the fat in this recipe. Your pancakes will STICK like glue even in a non stick pan. So make sure to use oil or melted butter.

I never give a review less than 5 stars if I change anything. And I did substitute whole wheat flour, soy milk, and egg whites (because that's what I had on hand). I didn't have the mushiness problem, but I did add a little more soy milk to get a thinner consistency. The pancakes were absolutely beautiful. Next time, though, I will definitely add some vanilla and spices to add a little more flavour.

My family loved these!  I mix the batter with a hand blender to make sure there are no larger banana chunks.  I think it's the chunks that can make the pancakes a little mushy.  After using the hand blender, the banana is smooth and evenly distributed, leaving no mush!

Both guinea pigs in my house liked them a lot - I can't say as I did not have any.   I added vanilla as recommended and a sprinkle of cinnamon to each pancake before the initial flip. The recipe as stated made 10 medium pancakes. We'll see if they reheat well.

Yum! Great alternative way to use over ripe bananas instead of banana bread. It did take a few to get the heat and length of time right first ones weren't quite done in the middle. I add blueberries sometimes if on hand and it makes them even better!

These are really good!  Following the advice of others, I added vanilla.  The only other change I made was to use flax-seed oil instead of regular vegetable oil because I like the flavor and health benefits.  These pancakes are tasty even without syrup!

These banana pancakes are awesome!  We used soy milk, added a little vanilla and chopped pecans; and replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour.  They're light, fluffy and just wonderful. Cooked perfectly on medium heat.  My husband loved them! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is an excellent recipe just as written. I think it has become my husband's most requested breakfast. We make these at home, as well as when we go camping. I mix up the dry per batch in baggies to take along. Also, when I have extra bananas left from a bunch that will go bad before I can use them, I mash and freeze.. thaw when needed for this. A slightly different texture, but still very good.

These are very good . . .  I also add about 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a touch of pumpkin pie spice.  I am making these for my one year old, and also use applesauce instead of oil and make with mostly whole wheat flour.  These are very very good.  I generally  use only 1 banana which makes them less mushy and easier for him to eat.  Thanks!

Great banana flavor. Served with maple syrup and toasted pecans. The pancakes really soaked up the syrup. They brown pretty quickly while still slightly mushy in the middle. Warmed them in the oven as I made the rest of the batch, which I think helped the middles cook through a little better.

Yum!  Yum!!  I make pancakes at least once a week (ok, I'm a bit of a pancake junky) and these are great.  My kids eat em up every time.  It's a great way to get rid of some ripe bananas.  I sometimes add some oatmeal to the batter which makes them a bit more substantial.

These pancakes were delicious. The mashed bananas give a nice texture and great flavor, my kids loved them. After all the pancakes were ready I realized that I forgot to add the sugar, but they were sweet enought for us, so next time I will omit the sugar.

These were terribly good! I too added vanilla and switched out the vegetable oil for some nice applesauce with excellent results. I added a little extra milk to thin out the batter but I still had to poke it a bit to thin out the pancakes in the pan so they'd cook evenly. The chunks of banana in them will not cook evenly if you let the chunky bits build up in one spot. The end result was thin pancakes, rather like crepes, with a fabulous banana flavor throughout. This recipe made 9 individual pancakes for me. I served them with a syrup made of peanut butter, a little softened butter, powdered sugar, and a little milk to make it runny. I will make these again for sure!

I took some of the suggestions named here and used 2 T. of applesauce for the oil, 1 tsp of vanilla, and then I decided to add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of apple pie spices. I also used those small brown bananas instead of the yellow ones, they are more dense and less sweet than the yellow variety (use 3 small for 1 yellow big). They turned out fantastic! What a treat! I topped them off with homemade all-day apple butter and they were a nice sweet way to start my morning! Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know WHAT I did wrong with this recipe, but these pancakes were impossible to flip over without a total mess.  I kept the heat on medium (or lower), and still they burnt quickly but were too runny to flip over.  The bits I was able to cook decently DID taste good, but they were unrecognizable as pancakes.

GREAT RECIPE! Pancakes were so moist and yummy! I added a tbs of vanilla and also a tbs of cinnimon... yummy! I doubled the recipe and sifted the dry ingrediants... I had to add a little extra flour.  Overall the best Banana Pancakes I've ever made! :)

This is a great, very basic, and easy pancake recipe. I have this memorized and make it whenever I want to whip up something tasty for breakfast (and it really impresses my friends that I can make pancakes from scratch...little do they know how simple it is!). I love the banana flavor in these, and also enjoy adding in nuts, chocolate chips, or blueberries (although it's also even tasty plain!).

Wow, these really were good. My son was getting tired of the old buttermilk pancakes, so I thought I'd try these. He really loved them (gobbled them up!) and he isn't even a huge banana fan. This is a nice way to use up old ripe bananas when I don't feel like baking banana bread. I did use only 1 banana instead of 2 and, yes, it was still plenty moist and flavorful. I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon as some other reviewers suggested and I felt these were nice additions. Thanks for the nice recipe!

Really good!  Added vanilla and cinnammon, like others and I substituted melted butter for oil.  They were not too "banana-y" at all!  Just right.  I also took the advice of another and put the bananas in a ziplock bag, closed and mushed.  Was so easy and the batter wasn't lumpy at all!

I will never use bisquick or a pancake mix ever again!  This recipe was quick, easy, and delicious!  As per the other reviews, I did make a few additions/changes.  For one, I sifted all the dry ingredients.  Normally I don't bother, but it was worth it for this recipe.  Secondly I added a splash of vanilla and a generous sprinkle of cinnamon.  I also only used one banana, which was plenty.  You get banana flavor without the mushiness.  Squishing the banana in a ziplock bag and then cutting off a corner of the bag is a great idea and works wonderfully.  Overall, this was a great recipe and I can't wait to make it again!

Very good! I made a few changes based on what I had. I didn’t have any milk so I used ½ cup condensed milk and ½ cup water and a 1/3 cup chopped macadamia nuts. Yummy

I LOVE pancakes!  These were extremely good and I loved the addition of the banana!  I used half wheat flour/half white and also subbed applesauce for the oil.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I'll definitely make these again!

My husband called them "exceptional"! Other reviewers have mentioned how the pancakes are mushy around the bananas but that's what my whole family loved about them...like there's just little bits of yummy warm banana bits in the middle. Mmmmm! Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely a crowd pleaser.  I did a thin slice of the bananas instead of mashing them and only used one banana – it turned out great.  I have made them twice in the past week!

DEE-WICIOUS!  Had to double the recipe for a family of four.  They were fabulous served with a little bit of non-salty margarine - no sugar at all, the natural sugar was just enough.  They made a wonderful dinner (not breakfast - we're strange eh?).  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Needed to cook a bit longer on slightly lower temp.  Doubled the recipe and added additional sugar, some vanilla, and fresh grated nutmeg.   Topped with butter, syrup and whipped cream.  I'm no banana lover, but these were a dream!  Thank you for posting.

yummy. made as directed for the first time in my life.. firefighter hubby gets home way early and I was too lazy to improvise;)Anyways, hubby loved them. I took a little bite to test and OMG, but not on the diet so I didn't indulge! :) p.s. 30 yr old metabolism stinks. I so would have eaten this even 2 yrs ago without even sweating it :(

I loved this recipe.  I pureed the bananas and wet ingredients before combining with the dry ingredients because I don't like banana lumps in my pancakes.  They turned out great-- my husband kept stealing them as I was cooking them!

WOW!  I wasn't expecting to like this recipe so much.  I have another pancake recipe that I consider my favorite.  Since I had extra bananas I decided to make these for the kids for dinner.  They are great!  The banana flavor is good, the pancake is nice and light and they get pretty high as they cook.  I made the recipe as written, gasp, even using the oil.

these were good pancakes.  They were hard to flip and were mushy inside. So I microwaved them later to cook them through.  The banana flavor is great and you dont even need syrup with it.  I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar, and sprinkled frozen blueberries on a couple of them when they were in the pan.  The ones with blueberries tasted better.

I made this recipe this morning! It was fantastic, although I made some changes to the recipe. I used:

1 c whole wheat flour
1 t white sugar 
(didn't need the whole Tablespoon because of the fruit)
2 t baking powder
1/4 t salt
1 egg
1 c milk
1 T extra virgin olive oil
1 ripe banana smashed 
(only used 1 because wanted to avoid the mushy texture. was still very banana-y)
1/2 t vanilla extract
blueberry (added when the pancake was being cooked)


This made a light, TASTY and a little healthier pancake. The texture was great, just make sure when you get the batter on the skillet, spread it out. Who wants a mushy pancake.

These are excellent!!  I have made them several times and they do make a dense pancake not a light fluffy kind and I do sift my dry ingredients and followed the recipe exact except that I do add alittle vanilla extract, sometimes some finely chopped walnuts and/or choc chips.  A suggestion to help make sure they cook through and are not mushy is to make sure that once the batter is poured into the pan spread the batter out somewhat thin, this has helped me.  Everyone here, all 5 of us LOVE these pancakes!!

These turned out very mushy.....I had to nuke them in the microwave so they could cook the rest of the way without burning, and once I did that they tasted pretty good.

This was so yummy!  My kids loved it too.  It was just right.  At first I thought they were going to be runny, but they ended up being fluffy.  You don't need much syrup though, they are sweet and moist as is!

This was not a success. I thought the banana taste was a bit lacking, and the pancake was too mushy--not light and fluffy at all, even after sifting the dry ingredients.

My toddler loves pancakes and bananas, and turned this recipe down. I think it may be better just to use a standard pancake recipe and add chopped bananas to it.

I had high hopes for this recipe as most of the reviews were so good.  Unfortunately I had the same problem another reviewer had, the inside remained gooy ad wet.  I tried it on every temperature and it didn't make a difference.  I am very disappointed.

I did not alter the recipe at all, did exactly as it said, step by step. What I was left with was a "pancake" that was wet and soggy on the inside.

These pancakes are very yummy, and have a lot of banana flavor.  I used a bit less sugar and added vanilla extract, and I think it was a nice addition.

Fantastic!  I only had one banana but the pancakes still turned out great.  In fact, I think by using only one banana, the pancakes were not as mushy as some of the other reviews have said. I also added a little vanilla.  My kids really loved them.  I'm keeping this recipe!

The flavour was great, but the pancake texture was offputting.  I thought it was way too mushy inside - it felt to me like I was eating a way undercooked pancake.  I tried cooking longer over lower heat, but still couldn't get the pancake texture that I was looking for.  Probably won't make these banana pancakes again, but it was a fun experiment.

These were excellent banana pancakes! I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla. In addition to the 2 "mushed up" bananas, I diced up another one to add.  I think it would be fun to dice up a few strawberries to add to this.

Very good!  I experimented with whole wheat flour. This is what worked well for me:
-Replaced 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour 
-When I cut the recipe in 1/2 for lower yield, it works well to leave the egg as 1 whole egg & cut everything else in 1/2. 
I agree with the post below that the inside is sometimes runny.

These were okay...they do need a bit more of flavor into it...I followed the recipe just how it says but i didnt not like the flavor that much, my boyfriend ate them in about 1 min but i wanted something more intresting for breakfeast, i suggjest while they are cooking to pour a little bit of maple syrup on the pancake, and that will give it a nice sweet coating!
Overall this was a good recipe.

These are really moist and yummy.  I added cinnamon, vanilla extract, ginger, and nutmeg.  We didn't have whipped cream or syrup, so we ate them with peanut butter.  Yum!  Next time I'd like to add some nuts (walnuts or pecans) and chocolate chips.

Like other reviewers my pancakes didn't cook all the way through.  I made them as directed and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  After nearly burning a few pancakes (with the middles still raw) I turned it down to low, spread the batter very thin and got them to come out golden and almost all the way cooked.  Wouldn't make this again.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe.  The baking soda taste was pretty strong.  It overpowered the bananas and just tasted bitter.  Unfortunately, I'm still searching for a good banana pancake recipe.....

We had unexpected guests this morning for breakfast, so I decided to make a quick breakfast.  Pancakes are always quick.  I had some bananas, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  I did a few things different.  I used fat free buttermilk in place of the milk and veggie oil.  I added some vanilla and doubled the sugar.  Our guests thought they were good and so did we.  We didn't think they were out of this world, but I think the buttermilk, vanilla, and extra sugar made them better than they would have been.  No one complained and they were all gone, so I'd say they must have been good then!  :)

the kids loved it!!!  I needed to use up some leftover bananas, and this recipe was perfect.  I used brownsugar instead of white, and added vanilla and cinnamon as others had suggested.  What a great Saturday morning breakfast.  Spread the batter thinly on the griddle- this will eliminate the "undercooked" problems that some others had!

I substituted apple sauce for the oil and added a little vanilla like others had suggested.  They were good but still a little bland in my opinion, but all liked and a great way to use up some ripe bananas so I guess I'll make again.

I loved that this recipe was from scratch instead of using a store bought pancake mix!  If you are looking for a fat, light, airy pancake, this isn't it; it would need less milk and more baking powder.  And that may be some of the comments about it being too flat or heavy.  The bananas make it very moist, but I wouldn't call it mushy.  It was a great way to get my bread loving daughter to mix in some fruit with her breakfast!  My son rated it okay.

Yum.  They are more dense than a regular pancake but they explode with banana.  I made a few changes and I did use the baggie trick to mush the banana as another reviewer suggested (that worked great!).  I used apple sauce instead of oil and did 1/2 wheat flour 1/2 white flour. I also added over flowing tsp of vanilla (because i love vanilla) and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  I tasted the batter and felt it wasn't as sweet as I like so I added 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  The pancakes were so good all they needed was a little butter- no syrup. I will freeze the leftovers for future use.  Definitely a keeper.

I originally gave these 4 stars, now I've figured out how to make them 5 star pancakes. Only put in 1 banana!! It's just enough, 2 bananas are too much. Also add some cinnamon. Maybe about 1/4 tsp. After making these revisions, these pancakes are in demand and are frequently eaten in our house!

EASY and yummy.  I halved the recipe and made these for my 2 year old.  He loved them.  Didn't change anything else.  Thanks!
UPDATE: I now use this recipe for my standard pancake/waffle mix.  Changes: I use all-100% whole wheat flour, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1 tbs. olive oil.  I have a cheapie waffle maker and they come out perfectly!  It makes a perfect 4 double waffles or 8 (1/4 c.) pancakes.  I just make a full batch and freeze the rest and microwave 1 at a time for picky toddler's healthy breakfast.

I just made these pancakes and they were just okay. They weren't five star pancakes but maybe it's just me. Also, I halfed the recipe. If you like banana in your pancakes, I recommend trying the Good Old Fashion Pancakes from this site and adding bananas. Those come out really fluffy, which I like. These pancakes were a little flatter than I like. I think cutting back on the milk will help with that.

I doubled the recipe and made these as waffles instead of pancakes.  The only thing I added was some cinnamon and nutmeg, a splash of vanilla extract and a bit of wheat germ and whole wheat flour for added nutrition!  So yummy!  My boys loved them with peanut butter and maple syrup!  Something yummy to use up those brown bananas besides banana bread!  These will be made in my home again!

My toddler and I loved this recipe.  My husband was not wild about the combination of bananas and maple syrup, and suggested other toppings -- something to work on in the future.  This recipe was moister and heavier than a standard pancake due to the banana.  Think banana bread vs white bread and you'll have a good parallel.  If you're expecting a light airy pancake with bananas you'll be disappointed, but we liked the result as written.

Oh my ever lovin' goodness, these are awesome!!!  I had a couple bananas, thought I'll try these for the kids.  They were raving about how good they were, they even asked for seconds.  I thought they were just trying to be extra nice to me this morning.  Then later they were going for the cold leftovers.  So I thought I'll just try a bite.  Whoa, there went the rest of the leftovers and my diet.

We used these for an after school snack.  We spread them with frosting, strawberry jam and coolwhip, and they were great!  My banana hater just ate his plain.  Just a note on some previous reviews: Firstly, if your pancake is mushy inside it is probably because you undercooked it.  Secondly, if you are going to rate a recipe, you should actually TRY the recipe before you doctor it totally up, then you stand a chance of knowing what it was you didn't like or could have liked better.  Thirdly, look closely, the recipe does not call for any baking SODA.

delicious pancakes! I too used butter instead of oil and added a tsp of vanilla. make sure you mash up the bananas really well before adding to the egg/milk mixture or your cakes will be really lumpy and won't cook right.

YUM! I loved these and so did my 4-year-old daughter! After reading the reviews, I added 1 tsp of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and replaced the oil with applesauce. These were GREAT! Smelled and tasted delicious!

This was super easy and fast! I just added all the ingredients in one bowl (to save on dishes) And I used butter instead of oil. The second time I made them I added blue berries, tastes good but I needed extra flour.

This came out very well. I made this for my fiance this morning (he loves bananas, and he loves pancakes) and he was very thrilled. :) Note: I only used 1 banana, since that's all I had, but it still came out good (definitely could still taste the banana flavor). Also I used plain soymilk instead of regular milk, and that was ok too.

This recipe was delightful...never thought of putting bananas in pancake mix.  I would also make a suggestion of putting a couple pinches of brown sugar in the mix...makes it wonderful.

Nope couldn't get past the texture. 2 stars for texture, 4 for taste. My hubby took one bite and spit it out. Kids ate a couple though and said they just couldn't do it anymore. I only made 8 to try and threw the rest of the batter out, a double batch. I suggest having some other breakfast on standby, just in case. Now it's 10 a.m. and hubby is out scrambling to get bread for french toast.

We love this recipe.  I always double the amounts and make lots of extra pancakes.  Then I freeze them so the kids can just pop them in the toaster when they want one another day.  I never change anything on this recipe..they turn out great.

I thought these turned out great.  I have never made pancakes before without using a premade mix...so this was a first for me.  The only difference I made to the recipe was I used sliced bananas instead of mashing them and I added a few chocolate chips.

Always searching for something to do with 2 brown bananas, I found this recipe to be a great discovery! Very quick, ingredients always on hand, the kids and husband loved them!
I swamped the 2T of oil for 1T of butter & 1T applesauce. I also added a drizzle of vanilla. Simple and wonderful.

I gave it 4 stars because i, like many, added vanilla and a little bit of milk to it. The vanilla made the pancakes a little more "unique" and the added milk made the pancake batter less goupey! THEY WERE AWESOME PANCAKES!

These were alright. I added a splash of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter and they still didn't come out as anything really spectacular. Maybe using melted butter instead of the oil would give more flavor, but I think I might just use my bananas in bread next time.

I was having a craving for banana pancakes, but had never made them. These were EASY to make and were very tasty!  I made them according to the recipe, but added a little extra sugar because my kids do not like syrup.They cooked up nice and fluffy which was great because I do not like flat, thin pancakes. I had some sugared pecans on  hand and just chopped them up finely and sprinkled them on top with a little pat of butter and then topped everything with syrup. WOW! What a treat! This is definitely one recipe that is going in my box.

The only thing I changed from the original recipe was adding some cinnamon like other reviewers recommended.  The pancakes turned out fluffy and delicious.  I will definitely make them again as a way to use up overripe bananas.

Very tasty and moist pancakes. I did add a little banana extract to the batter as well as some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I will definatly make these again!

I had some buttermilk on hand so I used that instead of regular milk and I also added some korintje cinnamon.  They came out very fluffy and the flavor was great.  My husband claims they are the best pancakes he's ever had :)  We'll definitely make them again.

My husband and my kids loved these pancakes--and so did I!  Next time I make them though, I will omit the sugar.  The bananas make the pancakes sweet enough!

Try this: Thin the batter with a little more milk and make crepes, instead. Spread some peanut butter on the inside on the crepes, roll up, and generously sprinkle the rolls with powdered sugar. DELICIOUS!

If I could have given this recipe zero stars I would have.  My kids like bananas, and pancakes, but not thisI!  There was too much banana and even at very high heat, they weren't done cooking after 15 minutes.  They were very flat too.  Sorry....

These were good and easy.  Next time I will use large bananas instead of medium, and probably increase the baking powder by another teaspoon.

I used 2 very ripe bananas and found that it was easy to mash and then followed the instructions down to the letter. It was WONDERFUL! It needed no syrup or even butter! Next time, I'll top it off with some ripe strawberries! *****Make sure that the pancake on top is bubbling before you flip the pancake to the other side (so that it doesn't "splatter" when you flip it over).

Wow! These pancakes were awesome. All we did was add a little vanilla. I also extremely ripe, frozen bananas.

Probably the best I've had in a very long time! Yum!

I loved these pancakes!  I changed a couple of things to tweak the recipe to my liking: 1. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour 2. Used light brown sugar instead of white 3. Omitted the salt 4. Used 2 T. of unsweetened applesauce instead of oil 5. Used only 1 banana. 6. Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  With all these substitutions, the consistency came out perfect. Like others suggest, feel free to add more sugar or more flour to get the right consistency.  Definitely takes longer to cook than most pancake recipes (it could be b/c I used WW flour), but definitely worth the wait!

The best banana pancakes we have ever had.  I thoroughly mashed the bananas so the flavour was through out the whole pancake. They were thin but not as thin as a crepe.  Absolutley PERFECT! I had to make a second batch as the first dissapeared!

HUGE hit with my family! I added the vanilla and cinnamon suggested by the other reviewers and added one banana instead of two. My batter was really thin so they cooked thoroughly and had the same texture as regular pancakes, not mushy at all. Even my pickiest eater loved them. Will definitely make them again!!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking  for! Following the advice of others we used 1 and a 1/2 bananas and added a little vanilla. We gave the recipe a tropical twist by using a 1/2 cup of chopped macadamia nuts in the batter and topped the pancakes with sliced bananas and COCONUT SYRUP! With some Hawaiian music playing in the background we felt like we were in paradise!

My kids really liked the pancakes, but they were a little too "doughy" for me.  I had to cook them on really low heat to prevent burning and they still didn't seem "done" in the middle.  I might try them again using just one banana.

I would probably say 3.5 stars, I added a teaspoon of both vanilla and cinnamon, which enhanced the banana flavor.  My complaint, like others, is that even though they are cooked, they taste mushy when you hit a banana lump.  Not sure if I'd make them again but they made a nice breakfast.  Maybe little kids would like this more than adults.  Thanks for the recipe.

These have pretty soggy middles. 2 bananas are definitely too much. Try as I might, the middles wouldn't firm up. Maybe half or 1 banana is enough. Some cinnamon to spice it up might be good too.

A WINNER!!!!  Easy to prepare with all ingredients on hand, taste and texture is great!  Kids left no left overs-which is great.  Simple and fast to put on the table-even greater!  This recipe can't be improved on-worth all five stars.

These looked and smelled great and tasted a lot like banana bread (but not as good). My husband did not like the taste or texture at all. I liked them but thought they seemed to be missing something so I added some pumpkin pie spice and chocolate chips to the second batch (it didn't really improve them). I would rather have had plain chocolate chip pancakes, the banana left a bit of an aftertaste.

I made these for my little guy, who is allergic to eggs, so I added a 1/2 extra banana mashed with a little extra baking powder (common sub).  I had to turn the heat down a bit on them as the extra additions took a little longer to cook, but he LOVED them.  Thanks for the great alternative Andrea!

Excellent recipe.  Followed the recipe and used 2 mashed bananas.  Just nice proportion.  Don't use more than 2 bananas.  Very easy to make.

IF you could say there was such a thing as an intense banana flavor, this is it.  They are quite good and very banana-ee.  :)  You do not need much syrup because they are very sweet.  I will probably make these a couple times a year.

Declicious! Just enough bananas and sugar without being overwhelmingly sweet or cloying. Be sure to use low gluten flour for fluffy pancakes though. I added some chocolate bits before I flipped over and my kids (who are choc monsters) went ballastic over them. Better double the recipe while you are making these cos they sure disappear fast!

These were good, but I thought the bananas were a little mushy once they were cooked. Maybe I need to cook on the griddle a little longer.  But my husband absolutely loved these, and he's not a banana person!  These were a great change to regular pancakes.  I omitted the salt and added vanilla, recommended by the other reviewers.  I'll probably be making these again.

So very light and tender, a great recipe!  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to round out the flavors, topped with warm maple syrup and toasted pecans.  Wonderful!

I thought it was very good, but only made 8 small pancakes, so if you have a large family make sure to double the recipe!  It was much simpler than I thought it would be and I will make it again.  Thanks!

I cooked these like I would cook any other pancake and I thought they were very mushy.  Maybe I should have cooked them longer or mashed the banana's better..I don't know but I didn't like the texture at all!

This is a very quick and easy recipe which turned out very well. I was surprised that many reviewers thought these were doughy as I have made these many times and have always had excellent results. My two year old granddaughter likes these so much that she took the recipe home and asks mommy to make them often.

These pancakes were the perfect way to use up over ripe bananas.  They were easy to make, and my kids loved them.  My husband and I didn't care for them too much as we prefer plain ol' pancakes.  I will probably make them again for the kids.  I might even make them up and freeze for mornings when they want something hot and all I want to do is microwave!

Awesome flavor!  Like nothing ever before!  Instead of making the entire thing from scratch though, just add the banana to a store bought pancake mix if you are short on time.  Loved it!

Great Recipe!  I chopped some pecans and lightly toasted them & served on the side for a topping.  We also dusted the pancakes with sifted powdered sugar instead of syrup for our little ones (they don't care for syrup) and they were great that way (and less sticky :). Thanks for sharing!

These pancakes were the best pancakes I have ever eaten.  My boyfriend and I cannot seem to get enough of them.  For all you reviews who had something negative to say you didn't make them correctly.  They are by far the most amazing pancakes.  Have an tried them with a variety of fruits besides bananas and each time I am shocked how great they taste.  Thanks Andrea for putting a smile on our faces!

I thought these pancakes were fabulous!  In our house there was a split decision between syrup and butter and brown sugar.  The were fantastic either way and they are a definate keeper...

My kids like it best without syrup.  I agree as maple syrup is a bit too much for the strong banana flavor.

My kids say it tastes a lot like banana bread.

Next time I will try just using butter to spread on the pancakes.

Excellent Pancake Recipe. I made them for dinner so i added oats to make them more substantial...they were a bit heavy perhaps but still tasted great. Reminded me of banana bread! Cinnamon also added a unique twist!

My husband and I really liked the pancakes. I took a chance and doubled the recipe this first time I made them. I read the reviews and did implement some changes based on their advice. I used 3 very ripe bananas and cut them in small pieces instead of mashing them. To the doubled recipe, I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp baking soda; instead of 2 cups of milk, used about 1 3/4 cups. I did not add any sugar. The bananas were moist and sweet enough. I also added chopped pecans to the flour mixture before combining the wet and dry mixtures. And I cooked the pancakes longer on medium low heat. They came out great.

So good, so moist and fluffy. I used half a cup of whole wheat flour and half a cup of all-purpose flour (coincidentally it was all I had) instead and only had one ripe banana. However, they were the yummiest homemade pancakes I've made yet and they barely needed syrup on em!!

I made these with 1/2 c milk instead of the whole cup. I think they’d be too thin with a 1:1 ratio of flour to milk.

I only gave it 4 stars because I tweaked it a bit. My husband made these first, and while he liked them, he wasn't into the overly moist texture but I loved them. I made them the second time around,  and having much more baking experience than my husband, went with my gut and added roughly an extra 1/4 cup of flour since the batter seemed a bit runny for pancakes.  The texture came out much closer to regular pancakes this time and he also liked them a lot more. I also dumped a bunch of cinnamon in the batter to taste. I will absolutely make these again. But I do recommend a bit of extra flour and some cinnamon to give it an extra kick. I might add some fresh berries to the batter next time.

I followed others’ suggestion to use applesauce instead of vegetable oil and add a half teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. These were quite possibly the best pancakes I’ve ever had!

I had 4 very ripe bananas. I made them 2 days in a row. 1st time, followed the recipe. Not enough banana flavor. 2nd time I added vanilla and banana extract. Great flavor! Now, I need to try a different flour. I had King Arthur’s Unbleached All Purpose but I think it’s making my baked goods and these pancakes too dense.

These pancakes tasted great! However, the insides were mushy. I don't believe they were undercooked. I cooked them at 350 on my griddle. I've made lots of pancakes on this griddle and that temp is good for other mixes. If you don't mind the texture you should make these.

I’ve never made good pancakes in my life but these turned out great. I followed the recipe and they were wonderful but I can see how some vanilla extract would bring them up a notch. This is a keeper.

This was sooo easy and sooo good! Like a lot of others, I added one teaspoon of cinnamon.  This yielded 8 pancakes for me. I made half of the pancakes as is, plain; half with chopped up Reese’s.

I used a pinch of cinnamon, added the vanilla as others suggested as well as butter instead of oil. I had doubled my batch for a larger family. So I used 4 small bananas which equaled to 1 1/3 cup. I used my hand immersion blender to mash my bananas smoother.  I sifted my dry ingredients together. Cooked at 300 to 325. They turned out great. They were not mushy and not overly banana powerful but just right. I could tell they were done cooking on one side just like normal panacakes and they flipped easily and they were cooked all the way through when done. I would make these again. Great way to use my overripe babanas other than just banana bread or oatmeal banana muffins that I make.

Delicious!!! I was craving something sweet, and some very ripe bananas but not enough eggs to make bread, so I decided to try something new. I changed it just a bit:
Substitutions:
Applesauce for oil
Cashew milk for milk

Added:
A handful of unsweet shredded coconut (about 1/2c)
Crushed 86% chocolate (1 9oz bar)

It was the perfect sweet treat, without  too much sweetness.

Fantastic! I have to admit though that I am not the best with heat, so it turned out a little dark bit it's okay! Instead of adding it to medium high heat immediately I let it heat up with small heat till it gradually became my desired heat. That way, it had the golden brown color that I always wanted. I used a small pan in cooking them so it probably didn't have enough space for me to flip it but now I learned??. I added a pinch of cinnamon and a 3/4 tablespoon of vanilla because my family LOVES the vanilla so it turned out not just great, but fantastic!

Was pleasantly surprised as I’ve never gotten banana pancakes to turn out all that well. These were fluffy and decent size. I did make a couple modifications as per others suggestions: I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 medium apple (skinned and chopped small). The apple gives it more volume so I managed to get 11 pancakes instead of 6 using 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. And it adds a slight crunch and a bit of sweetness. As others have said, these need to be cooked low and slow to cook even and all the way through without burning on the outside. Would definitely make again.

It's delicious and easy to make. I used about 7 small bananas and made a triple batch to freeze for  my kids. It was amazing and hard to refuse another pancake. I did add about 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp of artificial vanilla to my triple batch and they were like banana bread pancakes! Yum! Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious recipe, made as is with overripe bananas. This contains all the flavour of a banana cake in a light and fluffy crumpet - we call these crumpets in South Africa, our version of pancakes is the thin, floppier one, similar to a crépe, which are rolled up and sprinkled with cinnamon powder inside/over.  I used a brand new cast iron frying pan, not greased.

Thirst are my family’s favorite pancakes so I make them almost every Saturday morning. So delicious! Sometimes I add a splash of vanilla or a sprinkle of cinnamon, and sometimes I use yogurt instead of milk for a little tang.

I made the recipe exactly as written, and oh my gosh they were so good!!!  I was going to add chocolate chips to encourage my kids to eat them, but I was all out.  I am glad I was!  They were amazing, even without the c.chips.  My kids even had seconds.
I will definitely make these again.  SO much easier than making banana nut bread with old bananas.

I used perfectly light medium sized bananas which was the right amount. I also added 1/2 tsp.  cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of mace. Nutmeg would work in it' place too.  These are fabulous and fluffy.

Pancakes were soft and fill of banana inside.
I didn't beat the banana all the way.  I used less sugar, maybe two teaspoons, because the bananas are sweet enough.  Also I used half the butter.

I rarely come across a recipe rated so well by so many people that has next to no alterations in the reviews. This recipe was excellent! I did make a couple changes (lol!) I substituted butter for the oil and added 1/2tsp of vanilla, but only because that's our preference. The pancakes were delicious. Everyone loved them!

Love this recipe and make it all the time! I add the wet ingredients together first (throw in some vanilla too), then in a separate bowl add the dry, then mix together. The kids love this!

The wet to dry ratio is off by a large margin. I have had to add almost double the flour, extra sugar, and vanilla to make it edible. I also have to cook them at almost my lowest setting because of how wet it is. I gave up and started adding premade pancake mix just to get the right consistentsy. There is no flavor to this recipe and I will not be making these this way again.

This recipe seems promising but it has problems.


I read the reviews and couldn't figure out why a recipe with 2 tbsp of baking powder could be so flat and stodgy for so many people. (I realized later that I read it wrong LOL) My (possibly misguided) solution: add a bit more flour -- say about 1/2 cup? -- and cut the oil to 1 tbsp.  There is a lot of liquid in this recipe and if your bananas are super ripe (like mine were) that's even more liquid -- those things can get watery. 


The flavour is another problem: it was pretty bland so I tried to zazz it up a bit with come fresh ground nutmeg and cinnamon. 


Fluffy: So I added more baking soda than the recipe called for -- 2 tbsp, if you can believe it but it helped boost the fluffiness. Just remember to let the freshly mixed wet & dry ingredients  sit for a minute in the bowl while your pan heats up. It allows the baking powder to work its magic. The batter expands rather dramatically, which I guess makes sense seeing as it had way more than it should have. 


Despite all these fixes, they were fiddly to cook. I was able to get fluffy pancakes, but had to keep lowering the heat and at one point  covered the pan with a large enough lid to trap the heat to help them cook all the way through. You have to keep an eye on them because they will eventually cook all the way through but may be rather darker than you would like. 


I cooked them dry on a no-stick pan. The video that plays with this recipe produces flat, greasy-lookin

These pancakes taste fantastic! I added a little cinnamon to mine. I cooked mine at low heat but they still blackened (not burnt, just dark). I never got the perfect golden brown pancakes. Will definitely make again once I figure out why they turned out dark.

It was a good base recipe but I did alter it, I used coconut milk and added, a teaspoon of vanilla, chocolate chips, a sprinkle of cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg.
The pancakes do come out a little mushy so if you’re worried about texture they might not be for you. I cooked them with butter and cooking spray which gave it crispy edges with a soft inside.

I’m actually in the kitchen right now making them and they look pretty great... once I realized DO NOT PUT THEM ON MEDIUM HIGH HEAT! Medium low is your friend in this recipe. On medium high, I burned the bottom but the center was still pretty raw. Delicious otherwise!

Like most of the reviews, mines came out sort of mushy and when I turned temp down they took awhile to cook.  I actually doubled the recipe.  Possibly baking soda or another type skillet would get a more classic pancake look and taste.

I followed the recipe exact and have never had issues making pancakes... but these pancakes were very difficult. The first photo on this post is not how they will turn out. I used all the ingredients and they were so liquidy  that most of them ended up burning on one side because they wouldn’t cook all the way through fast enough to be flipped. 

I added more flour to the but had to stop so that I didn’t compromise the flavour - which still didn’t really do the trick.

If making these make them the size of loonie pancakes so that they cook faster (maybe).

These have great flavor but the texture isn’t pleasing .. I cooked them longer thinking it would make them less mushy in the middle but that didn’t work. Maybe the bananas I used were too big.

Easy and had ingredients on hand except only had one banana instead of two. Worked fine and probably helped them not be as moist as others experienced.

Delicious! I add vanilla extract to all pancake batters. I also add chopped pecans to this. I omit sugar as bananas and syrup are plenty sweet.

Super good, but make sure to cook on a low heat. like other reviewers I cooked the first few on a medium heat and they were very dark before they were cooked in the middle. I topped with cinnamon honey.

I just made them,  the heavy banana in this thin batter made them hard to flip and made the shape off.  I mashed the bananas with a fork almost liquified with small bits.  I think next time I will add more flour for a thicker batter.  Tasted pretty good.   A nice way to use up 2 bananas that were too ripe to eat.  I added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

I absolutely love this recipe. I have made these several times just as described. If you are having issues with them being mushy in the middle, cook on a lower heat and keep them on longer. They don't cook as quickly as regular pancakes.

Cook on a low heat, cover while cooking will 'bake' them a bit faster, and fluffier. The texture is more moist than a typical pancake. I LOVED that. I also added some finely chopped almonds. Delish!

Okay so, I've went round and round with first forgetting my password, to then being routed back to the wrong page and then having to search the recipe again in google chrome, but alas, I am here with my review pheww...These are freaking delicious! I hardly post reviews, but I was like, yes, someone else must know of the deliciousness of these banana pancake! So, I followed the recipe exactly  preparing the wet and dry ingredients seperately, then combined the two and I was careful not to overmix, and yes the batter was lumpy as it said it would be. However, take note and sift your dry ingredients (I got a taste of baking soda that almost ruined my palette) I did make an addition which was a couple shakes of cinnamon and about a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla. When I say wow, I mean Wow! It's like banana muffins and pancake mixed and were blessed together. ?There's nothing left to say except, try this recipe for yourself!

I had un-ripened bananas so I added a 1/4 teaspoon vanilla to the bananas. Best pancakes I’ve not only made; but best we’ve ever had.  100% recommend this recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as stated and these pancakes are absolutely amazing! We'll definitely add them into our pancake rotation. Next time I might add a half or a full teaspoon of vanilla and see if it enhances the flavor. Not that they really need it though.

I doubled the recipe and the batter came out really thin--so did the pancakes! It tasted like something was missing and I don't know what it was. Some kind of spice? Not sure. Don't know if I'll make it again; the family was underwhelmed.

I liked the video, I would recommend adding:
1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips. I've used this ingredient in a pancake recipe & it was surprisingly not too sweet. Adding bananas to the recipe I used could also work.

Amazing! The texture of these pancakes was soft but NOT mushy like those other low flour recipes. I will definitely make these again! 
Also, do not use cooking spray nor med-high heat like it indicates for cooking these pancakes! My first two came out dark kinda with burnt edges but I quickly changed to just butter on the pan and used med-low heat (NOT med-high heat) and they were fabulous golden brown! 
Note: I made a half recipe for two people and had some edits but the flavor and texture was fabulous! I ended up subbed white sugar for brown sugar, added a sprinkle of cinnamon and I used protein milk instead of the egg (I ran out of eggs). Flavor was on point and this will be my new “go to” banana pancake recipe!

These came out AMAZING.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I added a splash of vanilla extract and a splash of cinnamon to the batter.  I have made several different pancake recipes and these were by far the best.  Fluffy, sweet, great texture.  Just delicious!

This recipe is delicous!! I used whole wheat flour though because it is more healthy and I perfer whole wheat over white flour but you can make it with white if you like!!

The flavor was great! I doubled my recipe and only used two bananas (very ripe ones) and the banana still came through. I DO RECOMMEND  adding more flour if yours turned out runny like mine. So for a double order I used 2 1/2 cups flour but add it as needed. It just may be my preference.

These were great.  I halved the recipe (fed half an egg, scrambled to my dog) used unsweetened vanilla almond milk,  and added 1 serving of chopped walnuts and a dash of cinnamon.  I used an immersion blender to get the wet ingredients thoroughly mixed.  Medium high is too hot...use medium to keep from scorching.  They were moist,  but not too the point of seeming undercooked.  Good recipe!

Great recipe!  I doubled it and in addition, to the batter, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and about 1/2 tablespoon of pure vanilla extract.  They were delicious, nice and fluffy.  I served the pancakes with 1 cup of whole cranberry sauce, which I briefly simmered with about a cup of pancake syrup.  Breakfast was a hit!  Thanks for sharing.

My husband doesdn't usually like moist pancakes because he feels they aren't cooked fully, but he loved these! I did add half a teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe and I will make this more often for sure!

Found it to be a little too watery when it went onto the pan, so I added about a quarter cup more flour. Would probably use slightly less milk too but otherwise delicious :)

First time making pancakes of ANY sort, and these did not disappoint. I took the advice that seems to be traveling through the reviews, adding vanilla and substituting the oil with applesauce. 

They were delicious (and also not mushy at all, which is something I saw the occasional commenter note).

This was the most successful pancake attempt I've ever had!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I also used about 2.5 bananas and got nervous reading other reviews that their batter was too wet, so I mixed in an extra 1/4 cup of flower to thicken it a bit. But the most helpful thing I read in the reviews was TO COOK IT ON LOW HEAT!!! Most pancake recipes (this one included) advise to cook it on medium or medium-high, which cooks the outside too quickly and leaves the inside mush. The advice to cook these low/slow is genius and totally makes sense - allows the baking powder to puff up, lets the outsides get nice and brown and crisp, and allows the middle to cook slowly to a perfect fluff. Amazing!

Second attempt. Great recipe. Only added a splash of vanilla and a super small sprinkle of confectioners sugar on top when I serve them. Big hit with the kiddos and a great way to use our old bananas.

Delicious. I blended the bananas and liquid ingredients to make a smoother texture and didn't use any sugar. Pancakes came out a dream! Also added some chia seeds and hemp hearts for a little protein.

These were amazing! I overheard my 3 little picky first-graders say that they were basically flat, warm banana muffins ??. The only thing I subbed in this recipe was 1 c Krusteaux mix for the flour, salt and baking powder. I was lazy. Served them with honey butter made with equal parts honey and butter, but they were actually plenty sweet with just regular butter. Made a triple batch and froze a bunch. Happy, happy hectic mornings ahead!

Delicious. They are a new family favourite and we have already made them several times. But I use real butter in the batter and I don't use oil.

This worked out well and was fun to make with the kiddos. We’ve been trying to get into clean-eating so we made a few modifications based on that school of thought and what we actually had in our pantry. Lol. I used coconut oil rather then vegetable oil and brown sugar instead of regular white sugar. I might see if I can do honey next time. Def gonna purchase and try another type of flour. I mixed the wet ingredients in the blender separately from the dry and then combined the two. Used 1/4 cup for mine as suggested. They tasted moist and delicious! The family devoured them!

I don’t understand how this recipe has so many good reviews (the reason I selected to make it). These pancakes turned out so incredibly MUSHY. I suggest using either ONE med-lg banana or 2 SMALL bananas (it doesn’t specify which is the problem).  They tasted good but I cooked them for a long time and they were still mushy. Hope this helps someone.

Very good, I can see how it could get a little "mushy" feeling, but really its just from the large chunks of banana so it did not bother us. Reducing banana (compensating with a little milk if need be) would help a lot.

Flat, burnt on the outside, completely raw on the inside, no matter what temperature I cooked them at. Not sure what happened. Waste of bananas.

There are some things that shouldn't be blended into pancakes. Bananas are one them.  Tried to modify to save it, but to no avail. Grandsons thought just cutting up a banana and putting it between a couple of regular pancakes was way better.  I agree.

Good flavor, I added vanilla and cinnamon to batter as well. This recipe is also great with chocolate chips! Cook over lower heat as the inside takes a while to stop being gooey but the outsides will brown fast if youre not paying attention! Have made this too many mornings to count :) love it

I added 1 Tsp vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon because it sounded good. This is an awesome base for fruit pancakes! Tried with applesauce. Left out banana and added 1/2 cup applesauce. Reduced milk to 3/4 cup. Added cinnamon. Was awesome topped with apple butter!

This is my favorite recipe ever! I make these whenever I have any spare bananas. Usually not a fan of pancakes (too doughy for me) but the texture and flavor of these combined make them so amazing.

The bananas were sweet  enough to skip the sugar and moist enough to skip the oil. I get more than enough sodium, so I also skipped the salt. Used 3 bananas instead of 2. 
My family enjoyed it!

They were overall delicious but look and taste a little undone. I think that there should be less banana- maybe just one.

Love the consistency of the batter. Not too thick and not too runny. Instead of mashing the bananas, I blended with almond milk, egg, vegetable oil and added a teaspoon of vanilla. To the dry mixture, added a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Five Stars!!! These are truly the most amazing pancakes ever! I normally don't like bananas that much, but these make them delicious! One tip I have is that even though these look done, they aren't.  Keep them on 'till you are sure the middle is completely cooked- not just the outside.

Love this recipe! I added cinnamon as someone recommended  I would if added vanilla extract if I had any. I know some people said they did t like the mushy texture and I honestly don’t think it’s that mushy once it’s cooled a bit. Also I don’t mind one bit. This tasted like banana bread.

This is a good concept, but the pancakes were very thin and flat. I would do this again, but using a recipe that makes thicker fluffier pancakes. With bananas and walnuts added on top, very delicious.

I've made so many banana pancakes.  This one is IT!  I halfed the recipe but doubled the banana.  It was like eating hot melted bananas, with crispy edges.

Medium high heat was a little too high on my stovetop.  Burnt a couple before I got the heat right.  And since bananas don't all come in the same size... well you'll have to gauge what 2 ripe bananas means to you.  Mine were big so my pancakes were "soft"   Overall flavor was okay - better with walnuts and syrup!

Here's a few pointers for making this wonderful recipe even better.   For added fluffiness, use buttermilk instead of milk, add a small pinch of baking soda, and use just a little less baking powder. I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and a pinch of Vietnamese cinnamon (which reinforces the banana flavor). When using a 1/4 cup measure, this recipe makes 9 (4 inch) pancakes.  3 pancakes will fit perfectly into a 12 inch skillet. Since bananas have a high sugar content, cook the pancakes on med/low, about a 4 our of 10 on the knob, to help keep them from getting too dark before the interior is cooked.  When cooked, do not stack them as you cook more.  Otherwise, the pancakes will be flattened and lose their fluffiness.  Loved the texture.  Like pancakes from a diner, not out of a box.

This recipe was incredibly thin and watery.  I had high hopes for these, based on the number of positive reviews.  I wasn't very impressed with the overall flavor, either.  Very disappointed.  I really wanted to like these.   I like the basics of the recipe, but will have to adjust some, I think.  
NOTE: I added about 1/2 cup of pancake mix to it, along with a teaspoon of cinnamon.  We'll see if it helps!

I am a pancake fanatic and these were great. I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon, pinch of nutmeg and stirred in about 1/4 c. chopped pecans and about 1/2 cup blueberries. An awesome way to use up overripe bananas.

This is the second pancake recipe I had tried today (previous one was chocolate pancakes). And the result was fantastic. I had followed the instructions without much modifications. The dish was delicious - a treat to the taste buds. Thank God.
Being single, I have to rely on myself to keep my taste buds satiated. The food in restaurants are mostly bland, tasteless, and expensive. I can make delicious dishes that don't cost much using AllRecipes recipes. The site will be my go-to place for delicious delectable dishes from now on. Greetings from Karachi, Pakistan.

So thin. Me and my sister love banana pancakes and make them often but this recipe did not work at all. They weren't cooking right and were so liquidy. We noticed the dry to wet ingredients ratio was almost double the wet to dry. We hoped it would work out but they did not. We added more flour but they just weren't up to par. Would not make this recipe again.

Love love love this recipe. Did not make any changes. Both my hubby and I love these pancakes and I make it pretty regularly. Especially when we have leftover ripe bananas that I don’t want to toss. It’s definitely a keeper!!

Made it with Whole Wheat Flour and put water instead of milk.

Turned out perfectly moist.

My son finished the first 3 pancakes in less than 5 minutes. 


Thankssss!

I made this on a whim, found the recipe a minute before I needed to start dinner for myself. I halfed the recipe because I only had one banana and really wanted banana pancakes. It was a great base recipe for pancakes. I've got it down now. My changes: I added more sugar, 3 or 4 tbsp (I wanted mine sweet). I forgot the salt, added a splash of vanilla, and added about 3 tsp of cinnamon. The cinnamon flavor wasn't forward, the combination of ingredients made for a perfect umame of banana pancake flavor. I also made a dulce de leche caramel sauce for it and it was spectacular. (I didn't have any syrup.) Great recipe! Quick and easy. Banana pancakes can sure cheer a girl up!

They were great! I'd like to give them another try and use my griddle. They didn't cook very evenly in a frying pan.

These were a great way to use up ripe bananas. I followed the recipe exactly and will probably make them again, but they were a *tad* chewy. It totally could have been me (maybe over mixing the batter?), but that's the only thing that kept me from

Easier yet.... buy a pancake mix, make as directed, add vanilla if you want, slice bananas and put on top of pancakes with chopped pecans and maple syrup. A lot less work/trouble and they are delish.

These pancakes are amazing!  They are moist and fluffy.  I used gluten free flour,  omitting the baking powder (already in the flour) and adding a little extra flour.

Added a bit more flour as the pancakes were a bit on the runny side at first and they turned out great. Smelled and tasted just like banana bread! I will definitely make these again - my kids loved them.

Great recipe! The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp vanilla. Don't be concerned when the pancakes are still gooey after cooking them—it's the banana, not uncooked batter. Make sure to use at least 2 bananas (don't skimp!) in order to get the right dose of sweet, tasty goodness. My husband really enjoyed them, and was happy to eat them two days in a row. :)

Used whole wheat flour only and substituted applesauce for oil and these were fantastic. I've made them a few times, with or without 1/2 tsp vanilla and/or a dash of cinnamon. I think I tried brown sugar instead of white too. Delicious, easy and healthy every time. I often use frozen bananas microwaved for a minute to defrost. Top with sliced bananas and chopped pecans.

I made some changes to make these 5 stars. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I substituted the oil for melted butter and the milk for buttermilk. I also added at least a 1/4 c chopped walnuts. I also like a slightly thicker pancake so I added a  1/4 c more flour. So good. These are super banana flavored. I love them and so do the kids!

This was my first time trying banana pancakes, and they didn't turn out good. They cooked just fine, but the taste was really quite bitter. Ill just stick with banana bread or banana muffins for my over ripe bananas.

These were tasty but  a little mushy in the middle b/c of the banana so just be aware you will not get your normal pancake texture.  I added a little vanilla to the mix.  My bananas were a little over ripe.  2nd time I made them I used melted butter in place of the oil and we really liked the flavor plus cooked on low for longer. Coconut oil tasted yummy too.

I have made other banana pancakes before that were definitely superior to these. These were thin and disappointing. They all felt undercooked, even when they were a dark brown.

I didnt realize I had already made and reviewed this recipe before. Last time I followed it to a T aside from cooking on medium high because thats just horrible instructions for pancakes... they were bland, squishy and gross. They went straight into the trash. Not realizing that this was the same recipe I used before but remembering that my 1st banana pancake experience was horrible, I tweaked them based on the the 1st few reviews. I substituted melted butter, added vanilla and then cooked them very low and slow so the inside cooked better. They thoroughly bubbled through like cooking normal pancakes so I figured they would turn out well but no, still too mushy feeling inside. These are still gross. I put them in the convection oven and they turned out a tiny bit better but they really need more sugar. If I ever give these another chance, I'd make them silver dollar sized... double the sugar, use butter, vanilla, cook them low and slow and then bake them to thoroughly meld the flavors and allow them to cook all the way. Either way, with all the tweaks required to make these palatable... this exact recipes gets 1 star because its very bad and the upgraded version might get 3 stars. Lol

They were very good.
I noticed that some people were saying they could not get them to bake through even on high heat and they were burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. That happens because on high heat they don't have time to cook through before burning  so next time try low heat and wait till bubbles rise to the top before turning.

The flavour of these pancakes is wonderful. Sweet enough you don't need any syrup! I added the vanilla like many others, and I would give 5 stars, but the texture is a bit moist/mushy (which doesn't bother me at all, but it's definitely not the fluffy texture you expect from pancakes). Recipe was a huge hit with the family, will be holding onto this one and making it again for sure.

I made modifications, but this was definitely the best pancake recipe I've made. I used half white half wheat flour, aquafaba instead of egg, and soy milk instead of dairy. Loved loved loved them as did my toddler. Saving this one.

Quite good, had no trouble making it (I just waited a bit longer to flip the pancakes and closed the pan with a lid between flips to avoid the problem of wet-and-difficult-to-flip pancakes). They were just very mild flavoured and mildly sweet - next time I might experiment with more banana and/or more sugar.

I was going to make dutch pancakes for mother's day brunch, but then I saw my bananas looking sad and dejected. Since I hate to throw away produce, I suddenly thought "Banana pancakes!" Humming the Jack Johnson song, I grabbed my handy iPad and Googled away! 

I followed suggestion of cooking on medium heat. I also always keep my pancakes, as I cook, in a warm oven, so that may have helped as well. They were fine inside. 

I added vanilla after the first four, but even without, they are very good. I did add some big fat blueberries! The pancake itself was delicious. It needed very little syrup. Enjoyed it with peanut butter and a bit of syrup for a lovely breafast! Bonus, it was fast and an easy clean up!

Just tried  this recipe and these are melting in my mouth! The only thing I did different was at a touch of vanilla and due to allergies had to use gluten-free flour. These are the best!

We had some overripe bananas, decided to make some quick and easy pancakes. They are good and healthy, however my kids were a bit reluctant since they are used to the flour and sugar variety. Next time I will put in a little bit of flour to make it more to their liking, and hopefully reduce the flour each time.

These are delicious pancakes! Fluffy, and just a little sweet. I wanted banana bread but these are easier. I used 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 AP flour and it added a lot of flavor without being heavy. Will definitely make again!

YUUUM! I did as was suggested about putting the bananas inside a ziplock bag  but once they were mashed I just put them back into a bowl and whisked everything. These were wonderful - full of flavor, fluffy, and my boyfriend and I enjoyed them!

These were very good pancakes, but I didn't get that much banana flavor. I did cut it down to 1 banana based on what some others said about 2 making it too doughy.  I think the main problem was that the banana wasn't ripe enough.  I'll be trying this again with a riper banana.

I made 1 pancake to taste and it was ways too mushy. I added about half a cup more flour and it was much better. I also switched the vegetable oil for coconut oil and added vanilla extract, almond extract, and nutmeg. They are amazing now.

I used to make these all the time years ago. Don't really know why I stopped. Decided to make some when I had too many ripe bananas and Oh, why did I stop making these?!? They are soooo good! My kids love them! Best thing is the bananas add a lot of sweetness so you add very little sugar. Along with the low quantity of flour and no butter this is a healthier version!

I'm honestly not crazy about pancakes to begin with but these are outstanding!
Melt in your mouth !
Made a batch for my wife and toddler and no one could stop eating them.
I added chocolate chips and used applesauce instead of oil.
Great recipe that will be made time and time again!!

The kids said best pancakes ever!  Very light and they fluffed up wonderfully!  Made exactly as is except since I had a bowl of Frozen mashed ripened bananas left from banana breads I am not sure how many bananas I actually used.  I measured a cup or so out and my husband added a bit more.  Perfect! will make again

I followed the recipe exactly and got perfect banana pancakes. These are filling and delicious! They are now a Sunday tradition for our family.
These were 5 star pancakes without changing a thing.
** I'm not sure how someone can alter a recipe and still give it a 5. If you changed it, you're not rating the original recipe.

I  really liked these pancakes. Very moist and flavorful. The only changes I made were to add some honey and used half and half rather than milk. That was only because I had some left and wanted to use it up. Also added a teaspoon of butter flavor extract. Will definitely make these again. Would like to try with butter pecan syrup or maybe add a dash of rum extract.

Pancakes were fluffy and moist with nice banana flavour. Omitted the oil. I added about a quarter cup more water to thin the batter, as I like a thinner pancake. I think the thinness helped to prevent the inside from becoming overly mushy. I made two batches - one just banana and the other, banana with about a tablespoon of cocoa powder. Yum!

i made this tonight for 3 picky boys (one who *hates* bananas) & a picky boyfriend. i adjusted the settings for 10 servings so there would be enough for breakfasts during the week (i always make extra so they can just pop them in the toaster on school days). i followed the recipe almost exactly as recommended for the 10 servings but i made 3 small changes & 1 addition: 1) i used two bananas (although the recipe called for more than that); 2) i used buttermilk instead of regular milk; 3) i used 2 eggs instead of 1-3/4 eggs; & 4) i added cinnamon & nutmeg. they were a HUGE hit, even with the banana hater. they all had seconds (& thirds) & by the time they were all done, there were only 3 left for the week. they told me they were definitely on the "make this again" list . . . & with how delicious they were, i would be happy to do so! topped them with butter & syrup & served them with bacon & scrambled eggs. not the healthiest dinner ever but it was well worth the extra calories!

I'm not sure how these got so many great reviews. I cooked them low and slow as some other reviewers suggested, but they were still mush inside. Maybe reducing to one banana would help, but I already have a pancake recipe that does work. Probably won't waste time tweaking this one.

Great! For a healthier take, I took out the white sugar and used 3/4 c whole wheat flour and 1/4 c white. I also used almond milk instead of regular.

They tasted great!! As others have said to do, I added a bit of vanilla powder and used only 1 mashed banana. I also used corn oil instead of vegetable and only about 1 tbsp. They were a hit with my kid who kept asking for "more!" I adddd chocolate chips in a few for some fun

These are pretty good for a starting off point. Next time I'll use butter instead of oil, add some vanilla and replace at least half of the milk with buttermilk. I mixed in a few mini chocolate chips, just because my kids love them with bananas.

This recipe was so easy! I only made two changes- I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil and I added a little bit of cinnamon to the batter. They came out perfect and so easy!

Tasted really good. Add a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and no oil and they are perfect. For extra flavour add 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon ( depending on person)  of vanilla extract.

Use peanut butter instead of syrup on the puppies, it will change your life. Added vanilla. Also added a couple of walnuts after pouring batter into pan. So good!

Tip: let the batter sit for 5 minutes before cooking. In my opinion, you get fluffier pancakes!

After cooking two pancakes I realized my personal preference is to not have them as mushy as this recipe has them. I added about  1/2 c of flour to the recipe and the pancakes held their structure better, and syrup. If not it's like a wet mushy hot banana. These pancakes need to be cooked on a low heat. I had my stove on the lowest setting. It's a good recipe, I would only make or eat these with extra flour in them.

I tend to get annoyed when I see people who say this is a great recipe BUT I made changes but well now I'm saying it - I made this recipe, here's what I did differently & they were AWESOME ; I added a teaspoon of vanilla; 1 banana not 2 (2 makes the pancakes too "wet"); sift the dry ingredients; beat the egg before adding; added 1/3 cup of walnuts to the batter; 2 tablespoons of melted butter not oil. They will become a regular in my house!!

This has become a family favorite!  We like it with wild blackberry jam instead of syrup.  I also add a 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour---makes the batter a little less runny and adds some fiber.

I added chocolate chips and it made 100 times better. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and also like a tablespoon of heavy whipping cream. This made the pancakes light and fluffy and well textured. I loved it. I would totally make this again!

It was good but a little mushy. Maybe next time, add less bananas (1 1/2),  1/2 tsp vanilla, and a little bit of cinnamon. Also, had to lower heat and longer cooking time. But the overall taste was good.

Easy. Tasty. I love that it uses 2 bananas. I double the batch, use half whole wheat and half white flour, and make a good dent in my 'dead' bananas.

Wow, these are SO good! I doubled the recipe for my family and for the second cup of flour I used whole wheat pastry flour (I did not double the sugar). For the second cup of milk, I had buttermilk to use up, so I chose that. I did add more regular milk as needed because we like our pancakes on the thinner side, and I believe they cooked more evenly because of this. I always freeze the leftover pancakes for a quick breakfast....but there were no leftovers of this batch, yum!

I really didn't like the thin consistency of these pancakes with the banana added. They came out very floppy compared to regular pancakes - even with added flour - and I well cooked them. Not for me but I'm glad I tried it.

I did every single thing that it said in the recipe. These pancakes are  tasty and (somewhat) healthy, they are easy to make and I suggest that if you want to add more "sweetness" than you could add some chocolate chips in it . Otherwise if you eat these pancakes alone, they are a healthier alternative to some of the other breakfast recipes out there.

Yum! Took advice from others and added applesauce instead of oil. I also added some lemon zest and it was AMAZING! 

Almond milk did just fine in this recipe.

Great recipe. Bananas are naturally very versatile. I followed the recipe and they turned out great. I was reading on the comments and saw a suggestion to add vanilla so I did after i already cooked a few pancakes. Still good but for this morning I'd rather have had it with bananas only. Maybe in the afternoon I'd feel like something heavier and I could add cinnamon,vanilla coconut, walnuts  or pecans. We could serve it with ice cream and honey too. But it is all up to the individual. Overall it is a great recipe that has typical ingredients found in the kitchen everyday!

2 large bananas sliced instead of mushed was a little much - made them hard to cook through. Added a tsp vanilla (and a touch less milk to compensate). Good!

Loved these pancakes! Best recipe I've found so far. They were delicious and had a great texture. I only tweaked the recipe by adding vanilla extract and rolled oats to the mix then blended it all in.

Oh my gosh these are WONDERFUL. My whole family loved them! I did what another person said and used butter instead of oil and added a tad of vanilla. They cooked best if the burner is closer to medium. Definitely a new go-to for me!

I forgot the vegetable oil and these still came out great.  They are definitely on the moist side but were still light and fluffy.  Fantastic banana flavor, I could happily eat these plain, they barely need syrup.

Good idea. Odd taste, flat pancakes (chef issue) and difficult to cook through although I eventually got that right (cook over medium-low).  Will not make again.

These were a big hit, I used 1 1/2 large bananas and just shy of 1 cup of milk and omitted the oil completely as it isn't necessary.  They weren't at all mushy, and my kids have a new favorite.

I enjoy banana pancakes and this recipe was good but way too wet. I would recommend using only 1 banana. If you use 2 bananas then cook on low for a while to avoid mushy pancakes.

These were very easy and delicious.  The recipe made 10 small pancakes (about 4-5" diameter).  They were very moist, which is how I prefer my pancakes (other reviewers have called them "mushy.").  Cook them on low so you can get a bit of a crisp finish.  I substituted brown sugar for white, added about a tablespoon of vanilla extract, a sprinkle of cinnamon and a tiny dash of nutmeg.

These pancakes came out really dense and heavy but the flavour was great! To make life easier, I just blended all my wet ingredients (including the bananas!) Overall these were great!

I love these pancakes. However, I added 2 tsp of cinnamon for more flavor. It goes well with the banana. These are pretty thick so you have to let them cook awhile. I have made these a lot and everybody loves them.

These take forever to cook! I used a nonstick griddle at a low heat setting. As another reviewer mentioned it would have been helpful if the recipe stated how many cups of bananas were used given that banana's vary in size. 

I think if I were to make these again I would use less bananas in hopes that the insides would cook fully through. As far as taste- there were mixed reviews in this house. One kid loved them, one thought they were meh and the other did not like them at all. I thought they were good but the headache of cooking them completely through was a little too much for me.

This was an easy tasty recipe!  I doubled it except only used 3 ripe bananas and did add some vanilla extract.  Could really taste the banana.  Nice twist. Yum

This was quite good. My kids wouldn't try it but they tend not to like flavored things. No problem with mushy but I had to cook on medium heat. Low was too slow and the pancakes didn't brown.

Based upon other comments, I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Cooked low and slow.

I made it with a few modification...read in one of the reviews that it was too moist...so..

1. Added 1 1/2 cups of flour instead of 1
2. Put 2 eggs since i  was making them for my daughter and 
3. Added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence

They were awesome n my daughter loved them too...

A little mushy so add an additional half cup of flour. Also, for better flavor, 1 ts cinnamon and 1/4 nutmeg.

Way too moist, hard to flip, banana flavour very strong. One kid liked it, one kid HATED it. I found that cooking it on medium (not medium high) made it easier to flip and browned it perfectly. I would not make these again.

Made exactly as stated. Very fluffy and delicious. Important not to over mix. Added some chopped candied ginger to part of the batch. I will definitely make again. (BTW-the bananas were medium sized).

Adjustments made. It was really good and easy to do. I woke up craving banana  pancakes  and I looked up a recipe and came Accrosed this recipe. I had all the ingredients in the kitchen already.

I followed the recipe word by word but I did add pecans. That honesty made a difference and made them taste delicious. Perfect with black coffee. 
I also use buttere instead of oil for the pan. It gives them a nice salty crunchy taste at the edges.

Delicious. Stop reading my review and make these immediately. NOTE: Perfect for GLUTEN/DAIRY FREE people. I replaced with Betty Crocker Baking Flower and Silk's Vanilla Almond Milk...and yum! My wife is pregnant, hungry and allergic to milk/gluten...and this right here, did the trick. Well done Allrecipes. Well done!

I just made these. As other reviewers suggested I added vanilla and cinnamon. I also only added one banana due to reviewers saying the pancakes were mushy. They didn't have as much banana flavor as I would have liked this way :( I also added finely chopped walnuts.  Since I still had one banana to use I mashed it with a little peanut butter for a topping. After all this, we thought these were okay. I had been hoping for more of a banana bread taste, but that wasn't the case.

Very good pancakes.  The riper the bananas the more flavorful are the pancakes. If your bananas aren't that ripe, you should add some vanilla extract.
 Also, I think these pancakes, unlike other kinds, need to be cooked on  a medium heat. When using the medium to high heat recommended by the recipe submitter, the pancakes browned on the outside but were still gooey inside.

Flavor wasn't bad but I couldn't get past the texture. The pancakes were VERY moist to the point where I wasn't sure if they were completely cooked. I even tried throwing them back on the pan to cook longer and it didn't help any. Maybe try putting less banana or more flour would be my suggestion.

Amazing recipe! It made the softest, fluffiest pancakes! I used overripe bananas and doubled the recipe. The addition of cinnamon is absolutely essential and should not be missed. The other thing I did different is, when I doubled the recipe, instead of doubling the all-purpose flour, I used half all-purpose flour and half wholemeal wheat flour. Perfect! 
I also added a few raisins/chocolate chips to some of the pancakes I made. Took them to a whole new level. 
Thank you for this recipe! :D

I used coconut oil instead of veggie oil, only change. I love that there's no need for syrup, they're sweet enough with the sugar and bananas. My kids gobbled them up!

These were very good and had a nice banana flavor. I substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for the egg and it was fine. Made a batch and put them in the freezer. Now we microwave each morning for a quick breakfast.

I only had 0.5 cup of 1% milk on hand, added 0.5 cup of cream and it worked out really well.  Very decadent though!!!  I also added blueberries  - YUM!  Fabulous recipe and will definitely continue to use it!

I actually made this recipe one batch times 5 because I had 10 ripe bananas and we were banana breaded out, lol. My whole family loved them and I froze the remaining pancakes as I had enough to feed an army and only 5 people in the house.

Wonderful pancakes, easy to cook! I made pancakes for the first time in my life, and I fall in love with them! :) So tasty flavor, puffy texture! I added vanilla sugar instead of regular one, and used peanut butter and nutella as a topping!

I loved these pancakes. Like many other reviewers I substituted applesause for oil, and added vanilla.  Since I like things chunky, I also added walnuts and chocolate chips.  Came out great.

This recipe is my go to recipe. I always wait until my bananas are super ripe so they can get the full flavor. 

Today I added 2 tsp mexican vanilla  and 1/3 cup plain yogurt with 1/3 cup more flour so it won't be so soft.  I love how the sugar gives it  a crispy texture on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside.

Oh yum!!! I'm making this right now! I doubled the recipe adding 1/2 cup oatmeal, 2 tsp vanilla extract and only 3 smaller bananas (that's all I had). They taste wonderful!!! Smothered with some peanut butter and syrup....so delicious! Plain they taste like banana bread! Next time I'm going to add pecans! Thanks for the recipe!

Take this recipe, add half again the amount of banana, then immediately after taking off of the griddle, slap some peanut butter on that, then drizzle with chocolate syrup of your choice, then sprinkle some confectionary sugar on top.

These were a hit with everyone in my house.  I have tried making banana pancakes before but none have ever come out as good as this recipe.  The next weekend we were wishing that we had some ripe bananas on hand to make them again.  These pancakes are probably tied with banana bread for brown banana uses.

I absolutely loved this recipe, it's simple, yet incredibly delicious. These banana pancakes were hands down, the BEST pancakes I have ever eaten. Topped with fresh-cut bananas and syrup or whipped cream this breakfast treat is pretty good. My family agreed that plain and simple is the way to go though. Honestly these pancakes are great just the way they are and I definitely recommend them.

I followed other post and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, applesauce in stead of oil, I cooked on them low heat and spread the batter out. I also added a 1/2 tsp more sugar then maybe 2 tbls brown sugar. Some of the batter I mixed in white chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips. The texture was a little weird. My husband loved them and my 3 yr old didn't care for them. I thought they were ok.

Added 1 tbsp lemon juice to skim milk to make one cup.  Used 1/2 cake flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Omitted sugar, subbed applesauce for butter, added ground walnuts.  When cooking, added a few chocolate chips to each pancake.  They were healthy, delicious, and we didn't even need syrup!

Have been using this recipe for two years now and it's so easy, and so delicious.  We substitute almond milk and they turn out great...  Oh, we also add pecan pieces (sprinkle them on top after pouring into the pan) and it provides a nice nutty addition!

I followed the recipe exactly, but could not get these to work for us.  The pancakes were not fluffy at all, and although I tried a range of temperatures on the griddle, they never really cooked well all the way through.  We finally got them cooked through, but those were chewy.  We won't be making this recipe again.

This recipe helped create my first successful batch of banana pancakes! The first time I made these I used half of the banana required in the recipe and almond milk in place of milk (since I had no milk). It still turned out great! Actually, they turned out better since using half of the banana I believe. The second time I made these I used the amount of bananas required but they way overpowered the pancakes in my opinion. They weren't fluffy and "cake" like and were actually hard for me to cook all the way through. So I would suggest to play around with the recipe to see what you prefer. Maybe start with one banana and add more if you think they need it. :)

Great pancake recipe with the following substitutions: I used 3/4 cup white flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat. Instead of white sugar, I used turbinado sugar. I definitely didn't want to add vegetable oil so I substituted apple butter. I added 2T cinnamon but will reduce this to 1T next time. Lastly, after reading other reviews concerning size of bananas, I used 1 1/3 large bananas. Next time, I will likely use only 1 large banana. I used my Kitchen Aid standing mixer and the batter came out great. These were the first ever pancakes that I made that actually came out looking and tasting like pancakes! I topped mine with powdered sugar but my husband used maple syrup. Both are great options.

As another reviewer noted, they are a bit more moist than the usual pancake, which I attribute to the bananas.  However, this is a great recipe.  I added a tsp of cinnamon and used almond milk, and my kids loved them.  This one is  keeper!

I thought these were great. For those who are counting, I measured 1.5 bananas out to be .5 cup when mashed, and mine were great. I used peanut butter instead of syrup, very good. It's true they're not super fluffy, they're more dense and heavy because of the banana, but that's fine for me.

I will fiddle with the recipe just to see if i can get it healthier--subbing 2 T applesauce for oil, 1 T flax + 3 T water for egg, omitting sugar, using half whole wheat flour. 

Thanks for a great recipe. :)

I made a few substitutions; freshly ground 9 grain flour, powdered milk (I was out of milk), raw organic sugar, and butter (rather than oil).  I was afraid they would taste bad, so I had my 18 month old try one first and he gobbled it right up!  My husband loved them and I was amazed.  Great recipe!!

I was trying to quickly cook breakfast, so I didn't read the reviews before following the recipe.  It seems that people who like the recipe altered it significantly.  As one reviewer said, it turned out too moist.  The banana flavor was so subtle as to be barely discernible.  I'd cut the milk significantly if I made this recipe again.

Tastes like a piece of banana bread but just with some syrup! The only thing I did different was use whole wheat flour but only because im out of regular flour. Not to mention, if your bananas were really ripe kike mine were, all I did was smash them with a spoon while mixing my other ingredients - so easy.

Just a tip for all you moms out there always looking for a way to add nutrition, instead of replacing the oil with applesauce I used an applesauce/pumpkin/cranberry fruit and veggie puree pouch that I give to my toddlers. I do this a lot with breads, muffins, pancakes, etc. With such a small amount you can't taste it plus it makes things super moist! Just be aware that adding puree will change the texture of your baked goods making them more dense.

Delicious!  I used whole wheat flour and turned the heat down a bit after the first pancakes were getting done on the outside before the inside was ready.  I may try adding vanilla next time because so many reviewers liked it that way, but it was good without.  These pancakes have quite a bit of banana flavor and they're nicely sweet even without syrup.

These were a flop.  Kids refused to eat them.  While the flavor was ok, they remained so moist the texture was almost like uncooked batter.   My stove must heat differently than other folks as well, b/c cooking them on med-high on my cast-iron skillet left them scorched on the outside and runny in the middle.

Yummy pancakes, really great texture. I added cinnamon and some mini choco chips and it was like mini banana breads on a plate. This recipe needs no changes though, we were just feeling decadent :) I'll definitely make it again, thanks so much for sharing.

We loved these! They were pretty soft and squishy in the middle, but no one minded. A great way to use up bananas that are about to go bad, they don't require much effort to mash.

Made it first time this morning for the grandkids and myself. Doubled the recipe. Excellent!  I did add Vanilla but everything else the same.  Used very ripe (over ripe) bananas.  Very moist light pancake which I prefer over dry heavy pancakes for sure.  Easily can add blueberies,chocolate chips and nuts to this!  Definately a keeper recipe!

I prepared this for some friends who spent the night and they were quick and easy to make and delicious! I substituted ww flour for about half of the flour and they were still very light and fluffy. I mashed the bananas with a potato masher and added pecans and vanilla to half the batter. Oh, and I cooked them on medium low as suggested. Excellent!

Just made these and thought they were very good.  I changed the flour to 1/2 cup all purpose flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup almond meal/flour. I also added 1/4 cup of quick cooking oats. I used 2 small /medium bananas mashed in a bag as suggested and that worked great.  Will make again!

I made these on a lazy Sunday morning and what a treat!  They turned out so fluffy and light. I did add a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla, but followed the ingredient list and directions to the letter. I will be making these again.

I added 1/4 c. rolled oats, some ground oatmeal,  1 tsp vanilla, cinnamon. Left off the salt and sugar, but did not increase the other wet ingredients to compensate for more dry ingredients. Came out fine. I did spread the batter in light of all the "mushy" comments. Instead of adding oil to the batter, I just did little pats of butter before frying each pancake. It yielded 8 pancakes. I froze leftovers.

They're ok. I did add a bit more milk and cooked them at a VERY low temp and they were still mushy inside. I would only add 1 banana next time, but, I probably won't make these again.

This was simple but I too make some changes. First change, I also sifted all the dry ingredient together,  I added a1/2 tsp. of vanilla,  then I add 1/3 cup of chopped pecans  and last I sifted  power sugar  on top when serving this gave a beautiful  presentation to the great taste.

Made recipe exactly as printed. Centres of pancakes were gummy and under cooked, although, I did try reviewers suggestion by cooking n low however the centers still were gummy. Pancakes were also pretty bland. Others have suggested using vanilla or cinnamon, I would have to agree as it needs something.

I used 3 instead of 2 bananas b/c I wanted to get rid of it all and it made it super moist and spongy.

I made these for breakfast and they were absolutely magnificent! My husband cleaned his plate. I only made a few changes which was adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and a teaspoon of nutmeg and a teaspoon of cinnamon. The smell that wafted up from my griddle was GLORIOUS! My hubby & our little doggie immediately flocked to the kitchen. For sure these will be a staple in our breakfast repertoire.

I just made these pancakes this a.m. had everything in house, I don't know what these people are eating, but I agree with one lady who rated them, they seemed raw inside, I am a good cook, and make pancakes and waffles often,one of my fav.'s is I Hope Pancakes, I got recipe on line, but these were awful, my husband ate his, he was hungry, but I found them almost raw inside and I browned them up nicely, the batter looked great, but I couldn't eat mine, won't be making them again. I also added vanilla suggested by one lady, good addition, but it didn't help with texture. Two stars because the batter looked great, but the pancakes were not.  I am deleting the recipe from my recipe box.

These were very easy to make! I altered them to make the a little healthier for my two year old. I used whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup flax meal. Instead of oil, I used butter (not healthier, but yummy). I forgot to add vanilla as others had suggested in reviews but I did add cinnamon.

I have yet to try this recipe but I am a banana fanatic and I'm thinking that adding some semi sweet chocolate chips would be amazing. I once had homemade banana/chocolate chip ice cream. To die for if you love bananas. My kids always loved chocolate chip pancakes. So just a thought until I get around to trying this lovely breakfast treat. I think the suggestion of one large banana plus the chips would be perfect and not too moist. I'll write again after I try this recipe.

These are good.  Our Jamaican cook added equal parts vanilla and nutmeg to his Banana Pancakes, mmmmm.  I'll be making Rudolf's pancakes for breakfast tomorrow.  Thanks for the memory reminder.

These are gross! Pancakes aren't supposed to be mush on the inside. I think there is something very wrong with this recipe. I will NEVER make it again. I read another review that said the same thing happened to them so I know it is not just me!

We always double this and we use a can of coconut milk in place of the milk (two kids with dairy allergies). Honestly, I think the coconut milk adds something to it that milk just wouldn't do! They are fantastic pancakes.

Great recipe.  Took other raters' suggestions and used only 1 banana, and added some vanilla bean paste.  Produced a delicate, crispy pancake that was enjoyed by the entire family.

1st time I followed the recipe and loved them! 2nd and 3rd time I used 1/2 wheat flour, apple sauce in place of oil, an extra egg and cinnamon and vanilla and we loved them even more!! I make a double batch and make them into peanut butter and jelly sandwiches the next day.

Great tasting pancake!  But medium-high heat was too high (maybe it's just my stove; it's only about 7 months old).  The first pancake burned, so I had to turn the heat to medium, almost medium low.  Made the pancakes perfectly golden, and they had awesome banana flavor!  Going to try with cinnamon next time, and maybe some peanut butter syrup another reviewer suggested.

Yes, the best pancakes I have made yet. The texture is what was so different and wonderful about these, almost spongy, dense and moist.  Great banana flavor throughout and they cooked up really nice. Two small bananas are better than large ones, keeps a better balance in the batter, the pancakes won't stay so mushy inside when cooking. I used butter instead of oil, I like to keep it real, better flavor too.  Other than these two small tips, follow recipe exactly, you won't regret it!

Today was National Pancake Day and I wanted to try something different. I just happened to have two over ripe bananas on hand and thought this would be great to try...I was not dissapointed! I did add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract (and the cinnamon as the video suggested) and it blew my socks off! This is a keeper! :^D

Quite possibly the best pancakes I've ever had! I only had one large banana, so that is all I used, and I think they turned out perfect. I added vanilla, cinnamon, and a few huckleberries. We ate them spread with a little Nutella. Altogether too good!

Awesome recipe! I substituted sugar with honey and used about 2/3 cup of white flour with 1/3 of buckwheat flour. Came out great! And yes, sieving the dry ingredients after you mix them together helps.

They cooked fine and looked great..the texture was even edible because i only used half a ripe banana so they weren't too mushy..but the taste OMG was AWFUL. It tasted almost bitter like too much baking soda or too much all purpose flour and i stuck to the recipe in all aspects except for how much banana was added.

I added 1/2 rolled oats, vanilla, and cinnamon. I also used brown sugar instead of white, wheat flour and halved the oil. The wheat flour and oats make for a more dense pancake, but seems to hold my growing boys appetites for a longer time.

These pancakes taste SO good!  They are very moist and mushy from the bananas, so if you like fluffy pancakes these might not be for you.  I thought they were different than a normal morning and just delicious!

I subbed whole wheat for white flour and melted coconut oil for vegetable oil, and the result was moist & heavenly w/ lots of banana flavor. Oh and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract...mmm

Good.  And easy.  Once cooked they are not light and fluffy though.  They are sort of mushy inside (even though they are totally cooked) because of the ratio of banana to the small amount of flour.  If you want to taste and sort of feel the banana, these are perfect for you.  I made them exactly as written and we enjoyed them.  They arent my personal favorite but this is a cool recipe.  Thanks!

I was looking for a change-of-pace pancake and stumbled upon this one.  I loved how moist these pancakes were - they were more like a flat banana bread than a pancake.  My 12 months old could eat these without anything on them because they were that moist and I loved that!  We tried syrup and peanut butter and these were good with both.  Next time I might try a honey-peanut butter syrup over them!  Yum!

This is a great recipe!  I make it vegan, so I leave out the egg (bananas work in place of egg) and use soy milk.

The first pancake looked good, golden brown and all but the inside was so gooey, so for the second pancake, I thought I'd cook it longer. It came out looking burnt and the inside was still very gooey.

Substitute 2 Tbl applesauce for vegetable oil, add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and you have the best Banana Pancakes Recipe I've come across so far! I have made these pancakes several times now for friends and always received great compliments after. Using two whole bananas really helps make them a flavorful breakfast treat.

My boyfriend loves the banana pancakes served at a local pancake house, so this weekend I decided to try and make them for him at home.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only change I made was to add a half teaspoon of vanilla.  They turned out great and I will definitely make these again!

Made these one Sunday morning (Jack Johnson anyone? :) - super fantastic!  Subbed WW flour and added some mini choco chips - were a big hit and the maple syrup really brought all the flavors together, which rather surprised me as I'm not a huge fan of syrup!

Excellent! To avoid the mushiness issue, I used ripe but not overripe bananas and diced instead of mashing them. I also added a little vanilla at the suggestion of other reviewers, and used brown sugar instead of white. A wonderful lazy-morning breakfast.

For my first ever pancakes made from scratch, these were great. I love that there is so much that can be added to the recipe just to bump it up a notch. Chocolate chips, blueberries, strawberries... It is a great healthy start to the day and they turned out great. Make sure to cook low and slow so that the mushy texture isn't a factor and all is well!

Used extremely ripe bananas, which added good sweetness, along with more floor, a tsp of Vanilla, and Cinnamon, and a half a tsp of Nutmeg. I also added an extra half tsp of baking powder. Pancakes tasted like Banana bread, which I love. They were very good and moist, but they need more fluffiness. Hmmmm!!!!!!

The best pancakes I've ever tasted! They have a nice banana flavor without being too sweet. It was a simple recipe to make. I served them up with butter and maple syrup. They were a hit for the whole family.

This is a fantastic recipe!  My picky 6 year old loves it and asks for it every Sunday.  I substitute a banana baby food for the banana.  Works great!

I love trying new pancake recipes and have made a few or my own..This recipe is the best I have ever tried.Pancakes are full of flavor and moist like a banana bread.The riper the banana the better for flavor and ease of mashing.I used brown sugar instead of white but no other changes..awesome!

I use just a bit more banana than the recipe calls for and it's absolutely amazing. These pancakes come out perfect every time: fluffy and delicious, a huge crowd pleaser! They are so easy to make and can take on extra ingredients like chocolate chips and/or nuts for variations on taste and an early morning surprise for the family. The only tricky part is that of all pancakes: making sure the griddle is the right temperature! You may want to adjust baking powder amount to suite preference as well (more powder for more fluffyness, less for flatter, more crepe like pancakes).

The taste was really good, but they were pretty mushy and I did cook them slowly...I defrosted frozen bananas so that may be the problem. Although I did make sure to use a little extra flour...hmmmmm

Tasty but watch closely.  They burn easily.  Also good with whole wheat instead of white and add nuts.

Yummo...I squeeze the banana through my fingers instead of chopping it to get even banana yumminess in every bite. I add mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and poof it's a Sun morning ritual.

My two year old son was sick and not eating anything until I made these pancakes.  He inhaled two and demanded a third!  I chose this recipe because of the basic ingredients and I had a banana getting overripe.  I also substituted chocolate salt for regular salt to sweeten them even more.  A treat!  I will definitely make these again.

I have tried many simple banana pancake recipes, but those recipes haven't tasted just right! I did add a touch of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla for a little kick.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! The suggestion to  smash the bananas in a ziplock bag is a great idea! I do that every time and it makes smashing the pancakes fun and easy! :) Thank you for sharing this recipe ADDEAN1!

I used three large ripe bananas instead of two, doubled the rest of the ingredients and added a teaspoon of organic fair trade Vanilla along with a sprinkle of Cassia Cinnamon.  I think next time I might substitute a 1/4 of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  They were delicious!  :-)

Very tasty, much more flavor than simply slicing bananas into a regular pancake batter. I used my potato masher to mash the bananas and it was very simple to do.

Made these pancakes for some guests after we tried them and they were a huge hit. I have a cinnamon addiction problem, so I did add some to my recipe, but that's my own crazy issue, not a recipe flaw at all. The guests we had request these every time they visit now.

The first batch I served with Nutella because we love waffles and crepes with Nutella and bananas. I added 1/4 cup old fashioned oats (not instant) and 2 tablespoons of toasted pecans. Served them with maples syrup and they were a hit. The original pancake recipe was just a little flat and heavy.  With the alterations I'd give them 4 stars.

I used self-rising flour &  just one large banana, brown sugar instead of white, added the vanilla and cinnamon, and served with the Raspberry & Blueberry Pancake Topping from this site--YUM!!!  They're also great for munching on during the day--they don't need anything added!

Yummy! Made these in an attempt to find something new to feed to my twin toddlers and ended up eating just as much myself!

When I first started to pour them into the skillet, the mixture was really thin.  I would recommend waiting a little while to let it thicken up.  By the last batches it was perfect.

Excellent recipe - super easy to throw together on a sunday morning.   I dont use the oil, only 1.5 bananas ( slice the last half for garnish) and include 1-2tsp of vanilla.

These are delicious, i added vanilla, and used soy milk in place or regular. My only issue was a little mushy on inside, next time i'll either add a bit more flour or cook longer on a lower heat. very yummy though and love that it calls for a very small amount of sugar.

Great recipe! I followed it exactly and loved it. May take some suggestions with additions from other cooks next time I make this but honestly tasted great just the way it is. I used the Trader Joes Organic Maple Agave Syrup to top mine.

These are really, really good pancakes.  Next time I make them I think I'll try adding some cinnamon and some vanilla to make it a five star dish.  Thanks for the recipe :)

These were to-die-for! I was actually surprised how well these went over w/all of us! Very moist, thinner pancake. I did add 1 tbl of packed brown sugar in addition to the white sugar just because it felt right. Delish! Next time I'll double or triple the recipe-we just loved them!

These pancakes were awesome!  I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil when mixing, but used veg oil in the pan while cooking.  I also slightly altered the recipe:  1-1/2 cups flour 3-1/2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp salt 1 tbsp sugar 1-1/4 cups organic skim milk 1 egg 3 tbsp organic unsalted butter 2 tbsp organic EVOO 2 bananas, mashed  This made 8 pancakes, and they were pretty large compared to what I'm used to.

This were excellent!  We used the two bananas, but cut the oil in half and added two tablespoons of plain yogurt instead, since I had to use Baking Soda instead of Powder...  We served them with cinnamon sugar and sliced strawberries - incredible!  I don't think I'll ever make plain pancakes again!

Oh my GOSH these are amazing!! Yes, I am this enthusiastic about pancakes. I have made just about every version of pancake known to man, and I have to tell you these are the best pancakes I have ever had. The great thing about these pancakes is that they are naturally sweet with the bananas, so you don't have to add very much sugar.

Definitely a wonderful recipe!  Added a bit of brown sugar in with the white, some vanilla, some cinnamon and some frozen blueberries.  I found that I didn't need to use all the milk though; about 3/4.  Turned out very nice but instead of having the distinct pancake taste, they tasted more like banana muffins to me.  Still amazing!

Very tasty pancakes.  Added mini chocolate chips and cooked on the griddle over medium low heat to cook all the way through.  Nice change of pace from our usual chocolate chip banana muffins!

The best pancakes I have tried so far! Be sure to cook the pancakes on low heat if you are using Pam cooking spray, or else the oil will burn and so will your pancakes!

We loved this pancakes. They are full of flavor and so moist and yummy. We followed the recipe but added 3 tablespoons of milk to make the batter thinner and cook the pancakes faster as I was in a hurry. We also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. or more ground nutmeg, something we always do to pancakes. Thanks for posting!

my wife and i have really discerning tastes when it comes to pancakes, and these were near perfect!  the only mods to the recipe were that i added a little vanilla extract, sifted the dry ingredients, and cooked em slow and low (definitely not medium high(!), as directed).

My boyfriend liked these pancakes when I made them straight from the recipe and loved them when I altered it a little. Instead of two bananas, I used just one banana and added half of a finely chopped apple. I also used 2T of sugar and per the suggestions of other reviewers, added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. When made this way, we eat them with just a little bit of butter on top, or cooked cinnamon apples.

Good moist pancakes.  Nice change from regular pancakes.  Ate with apple cinnamon syrup and they were super good.  The adults and not just the kids I served them to really liked them.  And, they were also good the next day heated in the microwave.

These were great! I used olive oil for the oil and half skim milk half light cream to make it a little healthier! I put some fresh banana slices on top and drizzled with honey...sooooo good!

Sounded good, but did not enjoy banana flavor in the pancakes.  Prefer regular or oatmeal.

Very banana-y, but in a good way. I normally would have followed other user's advice and added vanilla, but I was out. They tasted just great without the vanilla, so it's not necessary, you'll still end up with excellent pancakes. I'm sure these would be great to experiment with.

First time I have ever made banana pancakes and they were awful... too fluffly almost too gross to eat. I will never make these again. I don't think bananas belong in pancakes :(

This is almost identical to the pancake recipe my mom has been making for years except with bananas. Overall, this pancake recipe is a great base for any kind of pancake, just add your desired fruit or filling and they always come out great. Or if you want, use 1/2c. whole wheat flour with 1/2c. white and they come out great.   The only difference between this one and my mom's is that she adds 1/2 tsp of baking soda along with everything else, otherwise identical! Greatest part, you can refrigerate any leftover batter and then when you're reading to use it again just add a Tbsp. or so of milk and it's just as good!

These pancakes are amazing!  I have had to make do with what I have on hand all this week (I hope the economy gets better FAST).  Tonight was a tough night figuring out what to make for dinner with what I had on hand and that wasn't much.  I had bananas, a little flour, and dry milk. I actually tripled the recipe, and because I didn't have enough flour or the means with which to get any, what I did was use old fashioned oats and mixed them in the blender so it resembled flour consistency, and they were amazing! I had my 10 year old help with the liquid ingredients and he loved the way they turned out, that was no surprise, he loves everything. The reason I have given this 5 stars is that my picky boyfriend loved them too, and trust me, if he knew they were a little healthier (because of the oats) he NEVER would have even tried them! I give this an A++ The only other change besides using the powdered milk and the oats was I subbed 1/2 of the white sugar for brown because I like brown sugar with bananas.   Thank you Addean1! You rock!

This was a hit in my house. Everybody loved the pancakes and said they tasted like banana bread. I would have given them five stars but if you eat them without syrup they have a definate after taste of baking soda. Ill make them again.

Added 4 teaspoons of cinnamon and this was a huge hit with our guests. The added cinnamon gave them the appearance of wheat pancakes, so they were really surprised when they bit into one. I also added 3 tbs of sugar. The first batch were a little bland.

I tried the recipe as is and they were delicious.  Actually I did use applesauce instead of oil and couldn't tell.  I used butter and syrup on top and am thinking I may try some strawberry jam for something different to.  I am sure if you altered the recipe to your taste they would be just as yummy.  Will keep this recipe for sure.

These were okay, not bad but not great.  I used 1/2 c. white flour and 1/2 c. white whole wheat flour and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and some chocolate chips.  I agree that there is maybe a little too much baking powder in these.  Will probably move onto other pancake recipes.

This is so good!  I made some changes as well - used 1 1/2 bananas 'cause I had three and wanted to double the batch.  Added about a teaspoon of vanilla, 1-1/2 to 2 tsp. cinnamon, and a cup of chopped pecans.  I also used soft white wheat flour and honey powder instead of the sugar, and applesauce instead of the oil.  My kids even liked this, and they usually don't like pancakes with nuts, that's why I'm rating it 5!

I pretty much just followed my favorite pancake recipe on this site, "good old fashion pancakes" you sift all the dry incredients together and then add the wet ones to the batter. Instead of oil you use butter, plus a tsp of vanilla. These turned out delicious.

These were not dense as I was expecting after reading some reviews. They were fluffy and airy, though a little on the thin side. There was a slight bitter aftertaste from the baking powder though.

I made this as per recipe; and it was to 'gloopy' while flipping; as well as a bit thinner than I'd ususally like.  Soo; what I'd changed was to double everything but the bananas; and add an extra half a cup of flour (totalling 2 1/2 cups); as well as a good dash of vanilla extract.  With those changes; this recipe is a defintie keeper!!

I can 't wait to make these awesome pancakes again! I am allergic to wheat so I substituted the flour and baking powder for Pamela's Baking & Pancake Mix. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and sprinkled in some cinnamon. Following the suggestion of another review I made a peanut butter syrup that was simply amazing. I used half a cup of sugar, water, and peanut butter. Brought to a boil in a sauce pan and simmered. Next time I will use less sugar and add honey from a friends hive. By far the best pancakes I've ever had!

Very flavorful and easy to prepare. I was surprised how much banana flavor there was in these. My only concern was the consistency. I like my pancakes to be a bit fuller. I shall add a bit more flour each time until I come up with the what I desire. Otherwise, I was as happy as a...well a monkey in a room full of bananas!

Tasty! I only had one banana and they still turned out great.  Next time I might add a handful of chocolate chips.

Easy to make, I cut the recipe in half to try out. Turned out yummy! Next time I will turn down the heat and cook on medium rather than high. They cook on the outside quickly and don't seem to get the air bubbles like other pancakes.

While the flavor was very good, it wasn't really the texture I was looking for in a pancake.  Even cooked over low heat for a longer amount of time they were still very dense and mushy.  Love the peanut butter syrup idea.

I used 1/3 c flour, 1/3 c wheat germs and 1/3 cup flour.  Reduced milk to 3/4 cup and still found it to be too wet.  Even lowering then temp and letting them cook longer.  I will try it again with a less ripe of a banana and see if that helps.  Also the banana flavor was not that great for me but it could have been the banana.  Also I added chopped walnuts and I really liked that crunch in the pancake.

I followed other suggestions and added vanilla, also used apple sauce instead of the oil.  They turned out delicious!!  I baked them on medium heat because I felt medium high was too hot.  Didn't need any syrup, just a little apple butter and they tasted great!

A good starter recipe.  I used two bananas and applesauce instead of oil.  The batter was thin so I made silver dollars. The pancakes turned out thin and flimsy (not dense like regular pancakes).  The flavor was good, and I also added some chocolate chips.  Beware that the pancakes may carmelize/burn a little on the griddle because of the sugar content of the 'nanners.

Great recipe, and a wonderful alternative to banana bread for overripe bananas, especially since it did not require a lot of eggs, a stick of butter/margarine, and or nuts.  My husband enjoyed his with maple syrup, and I ate mine with peanut butter and honey drizzled on top.

I really enjoyed these!  I was looking for an alternative to our normal pancake and I also prefer to not add a bunch of sugar to our breakfast.  These were perfect - with all that banana, I figured they didn't need any sugar for sweetness and I was right.  I added some vanilla but otherwise made the recipe as described.  They were heavy and moist, but we enjoyed them.  Next time I will try them with just one banana.  Yum!

These were a HUGE hit! My husband couldn't believe how good they were, my two-year-old had two, and I had 4! I used half whole wheat flour and half white. I did add the vanilla like others suggested, and I used applesauce in place of the oil. Make sure to cook on a low temp. Next time I make them I will add some nuts for texture. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these this morning with buttermilk instead of milk. I also let them sit for about 1/2 hour, and blended the liquids with a hand blender, as another reviewer suggested. They were amazing! I froze half the batch so I have some for another breakfast for me and my husband.

Very nice taste but the cooking instructions should not say over medium high heat as the outside browns too fast and the inside is mush. Maybe next time I will try it over low heat? Thanks for the recipe.

These were good, but yes, a bit soggy in the middle.  Turned off my kids who don't like "gooey" stuff.  They also did not rise very much at all, leading to a rather thin pancake, which again, is not what we're used to.  The taste was great!

Great/easy recipe. This was the first time I ever made pancakes from scratch and all I really did was follow the recipe. I did use 2T of applesauce instead of the veg. oil. Also, I followed the advice to cook it on medium-low. Definitely took a little while but it made sure the center was fully cooked and there was no burning! Definitely making these again!

These pancakes are a great way to use those over ripe bananas lurking in your kitchen. I thought there was just enough banana flavor and they had the perfect fluffy texture!

These were good.  I put 1 mashed banana in the batter and sliced the other banana and added to the tops of the pancakes once they were on the griddle.  Husband says, "They were good, but they didn't blow my mind."  I would agree, but will make them again some lazy Saturday morning.

i have never liked homemade pancakes...too much work for too little flavor/bad flavor...so i've always preferred the "just add water" type. i only tried this because i thought it'd be fun to make banana pancakes (other than my traditional slice bananas on top...). my entire family LOVED them. my husband is pretty picky when it comes to new foods, and he loved them too. thank you for this yummy recipe! we will use this again.

I liked these, my husband did not.  The texture/weight reminded me of the center bite of a slice of french toast - a little chewy/soggy, but very tasty.  Hubby prefers light & fluffy pancakes, and these were definitely not that.  Good recipe though, I'll definitely make them again for myself!

This recipe is perfect, in my opinion. The pancakes are fluffy and moist and oh-so-tasty! I resisted my urge to add a little vanilla, and they were still fantastic. This is definitely going in my permanent file. Thanks, addean1!

What a fantastic find!I love these pancakes.  I made a couple of changes: pastry flour instead of AP because its all I had in the house, I used non-fat milk, I added about a TBSP of vanilla. I also blended all of the wet ingredients in my blender until smooth because I was afraid of raw centered pancakes others had commented on.   This made delicious, crepe like pancakes.  I will make this recipe again and again.   Thanks for posting it!

The flavor was good but I had a tough time cooking them so that they wouldn't seem wet inside from the banana.  I found that a medium low heat worked best but several pancakes in the experimental phase were mushy inside.  Again, the flavor is good. Definitely 5 stars for flavor but I gave it 4 stars because these were flat and not fluffy. I even tried sifting the flour which is the usual requirement for fluffy pancakes.

Even though I could barely taste the bananas, these are very good pancakes. Not as salty as many recipes, and very fluffy.

The taste was really good. However, they didnt seem to be "done" in the middle due to 'mushyness' of the bananas. My husband really enjoyed these and I will work with them to try to change the texture for me.

Very good and very easy! I added the vanilla as another user suggested. I also used 1/2 c. Whole Wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose and they were delicious!   I did have to keep turning the flame down on the griddle... I started off at "medium" (5 of 10) and by the end was down to very low (2 of 10).

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought these were good with the perfect amount of banana flavor. I give it a 4 instead of 5 because they were not very fluffy the way I think pancakes should be.

Very moist and flavorful pancakes!  They turned out a little too moist and heavy for me, but the taste was still great - will make again and try to improve the texture.

These were by far the best pancakes EVER! Used a tsp of vanilla and a little pumpkin pie spice on a low to medium heat griddle. Perfect with lovely bits of banana inside!

I made this recipe on a rainy Sunday morning and my boyfriend, who hates bananas, LOVED them.  Make sure you keep the heat low so they brown and cook through inside the pancake.  I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla like other reviews suggested.  Additionally, I subbed applesauce for the vegetable oil and I think they were fine.

Instead of using all white flour, I used a 1/2 cup of white and a 1/2 cup of whole wheat. I substituted natural applesauce for the oil, and it was fantastic! These turned out great. I slathered some strawberry/raspberry preserves on mine, which I would highly recommend.

You should make at least more serving than there are people.  The recipe doesn't make as much as it says it does.

I wasn't expecting these to be sooo good!  Perfect texture and flavor.  We topped these with crunchy peanut butter and maple syrup.  YUM!  Next time I might try to substitute some of the flour with whole wheat and add some flaxmeal to add some healthy grains.  Finally a different recipe for those overripe bananas besides banana bread!  Highly recommend!!!

Probably the best pancakes we have ever had. The pancakes have a great banana taste, and make a change from traditional boring pancakes.

I make these all the time. My boys LOVE them! I've used whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil and added a splash of vanilla too as well as followed the recipes as suggested and they always turn out great! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

These are sooooo good.i took the advice from other reviewers and added some vanilla extract and cinnamon. Apart from them being somewhat hard to flip after you get over that they are not gonna"look" like the perfect pancake. The taste sure does make up for it. Love it.

This is a very easy to make twist to ordinary pancakes.  Only complaint is that the batter is somewhat thin, making pancakes difficult to flip.  Other than that, it was delicious!

For Valentine's Day, I was looking for a recipe to make something a little different.  I do not claim to be a chef by any means so I wanted something simple that would still taste good.  I thought this recipe was very easy to follow and it was a hit!  I loved the pancakes and will continue to make them.  I did follow a couple of other suggestions and I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon.

These were ok, but not as good as they could have been.  I've had much better banana pancakes at dinners.  The amount of milk in the recipe made them come out too thick.  I ended up added at least an extra cup of milk and they were much better.  After making the first pancake, I also added vanilla and some peanut butter and thought it made them better.

These pancakes were terrible.  I don't know what I did but they were bland and I could barely taste the banana in them.  I didn't like it at all.

These were good but we added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  They were a little more dense than we normally like our pancakes, but we still thought they were yummy.  I definitely recommend cooking them slowly, so they don't burn and the middle cooks through.

I really wanted these to be good... but they were so mushy... I even got to the point where the outside was burned... but still wet inside. Then I tried making waffles with the mix... even worse.

The concept of banana pancakes was great. I substituted the butter for applesauce to make it healthier. I was really disappointed by the taste and texture.

This had good banana flavor, but the texture was a bit gummy for our liking.  We prefer fluffier pancakes.  I think if I made it again, I'd just use one banana.

I love these because they/re easy and delicious.  I like to add walnuts to the batter.  I make them into ultimate pancakes by eating them with peanut butter and a bit of chocolate syrup. mmmnnnn.

I gave it 4 stars because I had to twek it. I added the vanilla and applesauce but I also added Choc. Chips. I made sure the griddle was really hot so i got a crisp top and bottom to my pancake. I also cut the bananas called for in half. This made it a 5 star recipe.

My family loved this - even my one year old.  I only used one banana, added some vanilla, and cooked it over med. low heat like some of the other reviewers suggested.  I personally thought it could use some pecans, but my family liked them as is.

As written, 2 stars; with adjustments, 4 stars. These were way to runny and bland the first time around. I tried again and used 1/2 cup milk (instead of a whole cup), 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/8 tsp cinnamon (instead of a dash), and substituted applesauce for the oil. Very yummy and good texture.

Delicious! I followed the recipe with a few reviewers suggestions. I added the 1/2 tsp. vanilla and used the 2 TBS. Applesauce as opposed to the oil. My kids (5 & 7) loved them as did I. My son and I ate them plain while my daughter preferred hers with syrup. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you so much!

This recipe was very easy and tasted great. I added honey instead of vanilla to sweeten the batter, and I used skim milk (to reduce the fat), and a touch more flour to thicken the consistency.

Absolutely delicious!  I used two large, ripe bananas.  As the recipe stands, I give it 5 stars, even though I prefer thicker, fluffier pancakes.  To accomplish this when making pancakes I always use self-rising flour (which I sift into the batter), omit the baking powder and salt, and add a little extra flour after mixing.  I also added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  The flavor was delicious!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe.  I only made one small change. Instead of two bananas, I only used one.  I didn't find them mushy on the inside when using only one banana, but they still tasted like banana.

These pancakes were okay but nothing to write home about.  I even added a teaspoon of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I'd rather have regular pancakes and then top them with bananas.

This was great, but I tweaked it as well.  I substituted half the milk for buttermilk.  I also added 1/8 tsp ground cardamom, which goes beautifully with bananas.  Per other reviewers, I used half whole wheat flour, but will use all whole wheat next time.  Also, be sure to cook on low to medium so it cooks on the inside without burning the outside. Such a yummy recipe!!

These were fantastic.  Perfect texture.  Only comment I need to make is that the taste of banana is very strong, so make sure your guests like bananas because there will be no way around it.

I followed other suggestions to just add one banana.  They came out nice with a hint of banana, not overpowering. My hubby never showed an interest in trying banana pancakes, but he enjoyed these, as did our 1 yr old!

Next time I make them, I will use melted butter vs the oil, just a preference on my part.

These were ok, but I don't plan to make them again. The mushy bananas made for an unappealing texture -- some have called it doughy but the pancakes are fully cooked. I think I'd rather put bananas on top of the pancakes.

I used buttermilk in place of regular milk and ran that through the blender with the bananas for a creamy mixture.  I also added cinnamon and some chopped strawberries.

When considering this recipe, think more along the lines of a potato pancake type recipe, not a traditional breakfast pancake recipe that has banana flavor.  These are very mushy.  I cooked them low and slow and then tried hot and fast.  I tried pouring direct from measuing cup and then also spreading them out in the pan with a spoon.  No matter what I did, they came out thin and mushy.  Maybe there is too much banana in the recipe?  Loved another reviewer's idea of mashing in a plastic bag first.  You can get all the chunks out that way.  At least that part worked great.

These were tasty, fluffy pancakes. The best part is that they are easy to make. 1 piece  of advice is to spread out the mixture on the pan a bit more since it is a very chunky mix. That way, it cooks more evenly and faster. It also tastes better with ripe  bananas that are spotted. I made about 3 medium sized pancakes from this recipe, but they were sort of thick and were filling.

Awesome pancakes! I did use melted butter instead of oil, and only one banana, but stayed to the recipe otherwise. I will double the recipe next time, because it wasn't enough for a family of five.

Delish!  I did add vanilla like other cooks suggested.  I also substituted 1 c of white flour with 3/4 c wheat flour and 1/4 c white flour...and they STILL came out light and fluffy.  

IMHO the best part of this recipe are the bananas.  With that added natural sweetness, you can skip the syrup altogether.  I finished the pancake off with a light sprinkling of brown sugar and powdered sugar.  Next time I'm going to caramelize some brown sugar in a small pan of bananas for topping.  I can't wait until next weekend!  

P.S.
It's so hard to make the perfect pancake with a gas stove.  I wish I had a griddle!

These take a while to cook all the way through, but they're worth the wait!  Low and slow, they have the just the right amount of banana to not be too sweet.  YUM!

So good.  These were a hit with the whole family.  I added vanilla and cinnamon as others suggested.  I also added chopped pecans.  Delicious! We will definitely be having these again.

I did not change a thing, and we all loved the pancakes.  They are so tasty you do not need any of the usual butter and syrup that tops plain pancakes.  Thank you for submitting.

Quick, easy, and delicious recipe.  Nice and fluffy, although not the best banana pancakes I've ever had.  I also added 1 t. vanilla and cinnamon, but substituted coconut oil.

These pancakes are awesome! We make them a couple of times a month. We've made them following the recipe, but we prefer them with a few changes.  We use whole wheat flour for a heartier pancake and since my son can not have egg whites right now we make them with just the yolks and they still turn out great!  They are fabulous with regular syrup, but we also like them with honeybutter or huckleberry syrup. Mmmm...

We made these pancakes smaller than the typical 1/4 cup because they did not seem to get done as fast as regular pancakes on the inside, probably because of the banana.  They were good!

If you really like banana bread this is totally for you.  I enjoy banana bread but this was a little much for me.  Even though only 2 bananas are called for, i feel it was too much.  Not to mention it was very hard to cook, the batter cooked to the pan, but i was just really patient and it came out just fine.  The taste wasn't bad, really filling, will try again.  Thanks for a fun recipe!

I listened to the advice of others and added one banana and cooked the pancakes on low so they wouldnt come out mushy.  I also added a bit of vanilla flavoring.  I think next time I use 2 bananas instead of one so that certain parts of the pancake with no banana flavoring doesnt taste bland.

These pancakes were good, though, I wished that I'd used a food processor to puree my bananas.  I just mashed them with a fork, and I think the pancakes might have been better if I'd really gotten all the lumps out of the bananas.  Pancakes were surprisingly fluffy.  Usually, I find banana pancakes very heavy and dense.  These were not.

my family loves these banana pancakes...however my husband and boys have a bit of a sweet-tooth so I added an extra tablespoon of sugar as well as a teaspoon of vanilla. They are also great with peacans, fresh strawberries, blueberries or even chocolate chips. This is a great base to really get creative.

Loved the mmmmm... banana flavor in these pancakes!! Well the changes I made (because I wanted to use up the ingredients that I already have) were:
used 1 cup Bisquick Heart Smart mix instead of All Purpose Flour
1/4 cup Egg beaters in place of eggs (being cholestrol savvy!)
1 Banana instead of 2...mashed it up really really well.
And like some reviewer suggested I sifted the flour...the pancakes were truly wonderful...not at all gooey or anything in the middle....will definitely be making these again!
Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

Just had these for breakfast and they were great. I only used 1 banana and I diced it instead of mashing it, still very banana-y. Also, I did have to add more milk to get it the right consistency. I served these with "Absolute Best Pancake Syrup" from this site. *So good*

I agree with other posters that these are a little soft on the inside compared to other pancakes. But the flavor is delicious when you let them cool a bit and then eat them.  I will make again but next time only add one banana or two very small bananas.

This was great, followed it as written and it was great.  Banana flavor was very evenly incorporated and the batter was a great consistency.  Next time might add cinnamon+vanilla.  The guys said it was like biting into banana bread.  :)  Thanks!

YUH-UM!  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla as suggested in other reviews because it sounded good.   The combination of bananas and maple syrup is surprisingly delicious! I think I will make this my new Christmas morning breakfast.

These were very good!  I altered the recipe slightly because I like sliced bananas instead of mashed bananas in my pancakes.  I sliced the bananas thinly and added 1/2 tsp of banana extract to the batter.  I also included the 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract from another review.

We have never had banana pancakes before...thought we'd try something different.  This recipe is enough for a family of 4, I doubled it and it was too much.  I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon for flavor and about 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips for fun.  They were good, but one member of the family didn't like them so we won't make these again until she forgets she didn't like them.

I followed the recipe exactly, but they weren't very fluffy.  However, the flavor was better than I expected.  I added the vanilla as others suggested.  I also threw in some chocolate chips. We topped them with either whipped cream or peanut butter instead of syrup.  My kids devoured them!

These were great!  My two year old daughter, whose quite picky, gobbled them up.  It's quick.  It's easy.  And it's delicious.

As other reviewers have mentioned, this recipe tastes really good, but the inside stays mushy unless you cook them for a while at medium heat. Being hungry in the morning and all, this took a tad too long for me, but still they tasted delicious. I'll probably make this again, but I still want to find a recipe that doesn't take so much time.

These were alright.  I may try them again adding some cinnamon and vanilla.  Also needs to cook on a low heat since they centers were pretty mushy.  If that doesn't work I may try using only one banana. Very filling pancake.

I chopped up the bananas instead of mashing them, subbed half wheat flour, and added vanilla.  Next time I may add some chopped nuts as well.  These were very good but only giving it a 4 cause we prefer my father-in-law's.

THIS RECIPE IS VERY DELICIOUS. WE ADDED VANILLA EXTRACT BUT IT WOULD ALSO WOULD GOOD WITH BANANA EXTRACT. THESE ARE SO GOOD THEY CAN BE EATEN ON THEIR OWN OR WITH SYRUP. I AM NOT PARTIAL TO SWEETS SO I HAD MINE WITHOUT AND FOUND THEM TO BE AWESOME. TO MAKE THE KIDS DAY WE PILED THEM WITH WHIPPED TOPPING AND ADDITIONAL BANANA SLICES. THEY GOT A KICK OUT OF THEM. EVEN THE FINICKIEST EATER WILL LOVE THESE.

My kids thought these were "ok" and gave them 3 stars.  I thought they were mushy inside no matter how long I cooked them.  I just did not like the texture.  1 star for me.

These go perfect with the "buttermilk syrup" recipe on this site.  These are very filling, I could only eat two.   What I did differently was I added two Tbl of applesauce to the recipe (no substitutions) and 1 tsp vanilla.  I also sifted dry ingredients which did make for fluffier pancakes. Love em:)

Followed the recipe exactly besides adding a dash of vanilla extract to the egg mixture. The texture was perfect and the pancakes were nice and moist. The taste wasn't obviously banana-ee but you did get the hint of it. I ate mine with yogurt mixed with honey as the syrup/sauce with bananas, blueberries and strawberries on top. I would make these again.

Loved 'em! I followed recipe as written, except I was a little too tempted by the half bag of chocolate chips on the counter, and threw a few on the top of each pancake while it was cooking. I will definitely make them again.

These were delicious - very light and banana-y.  I left the bananas a little chunky rather than mashing into a puree and also added the 1/4 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon.  The cinnamon was a nice complement to the banana flavor.  Highly recommend.

Heavenly.  I found they were easier to cook at a lower temperature (300F), and they tasted better when I used bananas that had not been frozen.

I doubled it and used 3 bananas. The consitency of the batter was perfect. This recipe is so simple and delicious.  The pancakes have a smooth texture, and a nice banana flavor. Thank you for sharing your recipe

These pancakes are very moist. Almost too moist for my taste. I changed it to 1/2 c. flour and 1/2 c. wheat flour. It gives them a nice texture and makes them healthier for the family. Also, I add 1/4 tsp. vanilla to the wet ingredients and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. The whole family loves them. Delicious!!

These where the best American pancakes I've ever had. I made this the first time like in the recipe, with some vanilla, and the second time (when it was just for me and my boy friend) I added berries and oat meal, and added almost no sugar and oil. They where still really good. I normally don't like American pancakes, so these are by far my favorite. Thanks

This was an overall really yummy recipe.  I think that it has a slightly different texture than the regular cake-y pancake.  This has a denser, more moist center, that is not unpleasant by any means.  I will make this again, and experiment with other fruits.

These were very delicious!  I did change a few things... I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla, and also used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup club soda for fluffier pancakes.  I think the banana flavor was great.  I was nervous because some reviewers said the outside cooked very fast and the middle stayed mushy.  I don't think that's the recipe...I think it's important to let them cook on a lower temperature.  I used a lightly oiled griddle at 300 degrees and let the pancakes cook for 3-5 minutes on the first side, then 1-2 minutes on the second. They were PERFECT!  And wonderfully delicious.  Thanks!

In 2008 we found this allrecipes gem and it's the only pancake recipe or mix we've used since. So easy, nearly impossible to goof up, smooth moist texture, forgiving with substitutions, and just delicious. Often I'll mix a few batches of the dry ingredients and keep them in the freezer until we're ready to add the wet ingredients and make pancakes. My young son loves them without syrup.

Excellent!  I added some vanilla, cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg.  I served with fresh whipped cream since I think that's a little lighter than butter and syrup.  Will definitely make this again!

I was looking for a quick dessert this evening and I had one dying banana, so I halved this recipe. I added vanilla and cinnamon and it was great. I did have to turn the burner on low to make sure the inside was cooked. My husband and I and 2 young kids had just enough for a tasty dessert. I will definitely make them again.

Delicious! I added half a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. Very filling...next time I will cut the recipe in half (for two people).

Awesome!  My children are pretty picky, and don't like anything out of the ordinary, so when they found out they were going to have "banana pancakes", they were discusted...however, they all cleared their plates (and asked for more)!  I added a teaspoon of brown sugar for a little extra sweetness, and they were perfect!  Just as easy of a recipe as bisquick, with ingredients that you normally have in the house (we always seem to even have bananas)!

I used butter instead of oil and added a small dash of cinnamon and some vanilla.  They came out awesome!  I also used apple-bananas that we just picked from our tree this morning.

I have a good cast iron pan that I used and it seems to make the best type of pancakes.  Slightly chewey and fluffy at the same time.  5 stars!

I thought these were tasty and so did my son. My husband and daughter didn't like them at all. The consistancy was a little weird. The outside would be very brown and the inside mushy. I loved the flavor. I did not like the texture.

This banana pancake recipe is AMAZING.  I even omitted the egg for a low-cholesterol version and substituted it for 1/2 a mashed banana.  They still came out perfectly fluffy, light and flavorful. I also substituted butter/oil for Virgin Coconut Oil.  The flavor took on a new dimension.  Absolutely wonderful and a great scent filled the house.  You can use your imagination with this recipe.  Add macadmias, walnuts, shredded coconut.  Simply the best.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Really quite good...made as directed. The reason for only four stars is I like my pancake batter a little thinner, so next time I'll add a tad more milk and possibly some vanilla and cinnamon as other reviewers recommended. Very flavorful though, will definitely make again!

Definately the best banana pancakes I've had! I did add 1 Tbs vanilla, substituted 2 Tbs applesauce for the oil and added about half a cup of chopped pecans. Also, I only used 1 banana and it was still fantastic. So very good.

Yumm!!  I made these pancakes for breakfast this morning for my family and everyone really enjoyed them - especially my 2-year old!  I made two minor changes in that I added about 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract and I used butter instead of the oil.  The recipe yield is a bit off though as this recipe makes 8 pancakes using a 1/3 cup measure, so not enough for 6 people, but enough for 2 adults and a toddler.  The only reason this recipe didn't receive 5 stars is that my husband felt the banana flavor was too strong, so the next time I will reduce the amount of banana to one large.

I stumbled on this recipe as i was looking for a pancake recipe online, boy was I lucky! I made them for my family and they loved them! I love the slight mushy banana feel they have.  I didn't use to like pancakes, but now I think I am definately hooked. Thanks.

Very good -- I doubled the recipe and used half white whole wheat flour and half all purpose. Subbed applesauce for oil (but had to use cooking spray between each batch even on a non-stick griddle). Tossed in a tablespoon of flax seed meal for health reasons. Then added chocolate chips to the last half of the batter and the kids loved these, of course.

I made these adding 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, a dash nutmeg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  I also used a tablespoon packed brown sugar instead of the white sugar. My picky 17 year old said they were the best pancakes she ever had and she doesn't like anything banana flavored!  I simplified the recipe by putting everything into the food processor.  By doing this, I used the same batter for waffles. Because of the fruit, I did have to spray the non-stick waffle iron with Pam every other batch, as they have a tendency to stick.  Great recipe, definitely one to use again.

I thought these were really very good.  Banana flavor was perfect, not too light or too strong.  My family had mixed reviews, hence the 4 stars (4, 5, and 7 year olds and hubby).  I, too, added the 1/2 tsp. vanilla and substituted cinnamon applesauce for the oil to help keep the fat down.  Served with Coconut Syrup from this site... not a fan of the syrup though.  Will make again and serve with Jam!

I followed the suggestion to add 2 T brown sugar, 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t cinnamon since we like our pancakes sweet. Also used 1 T applesauce and 1 T oil instead of 2 T oil to save some fat. Sprinkled some prepared low-fat granola cereal on the bubbling side of the cooking pancakes before flipping on the grown-ups' pancakes like a local favorite restaurant, gives pancakes a little more substance. Nice texture and flavor. Cooked nicely. Would definitely make again.

This was alright, I found that the flavour didn't really stand out for me and I used a very ripe banana. I followed other reviewer suggestion of mushing banana in a sandwich baggie ~ made it easy to mush.  Easy to make. Required more banana for more flavour.  I tried a variety of different toppings including: peanut butter ***, butter ***, maple syrup ****, maple syrup with butter *****.   As indicated the last option is the most recommended, but the others tasted good as well.

Great recipe that the kids LOVE!  I usually make a double batch and freeze them!  They freeze and reheat well!  GREAT way to use up extra bananas!  However, these pancakes take a while to bake so that the centers aren't mushy.

At my house, we eat a lot of pancakes for breakfast.  The kids have gotten burned out lately and don't request them as much.  I made this recipe this morning and they all had 2nds and 3rds!  Even the 1-yr old loved them! I did use 1/2 ww flour and 1/2 ap flour and added a splash of vanilla.  Next time I might use applesauce instead of oil.

Very good!  I added 1/2c buttermilk to this recipe - I love this texture of pancake.  I used two relatively bananas.

These were super easy to put together, and I like the fact that I almost always have all the ingredients needed to make them.  They tasted really good too!  The texture was a little unexpected for me--it almost reminded me of the texture of cooked eggs.  Once I got used to it though, I thouroughly enjoyed these.  I would rate these a 5-star as far as taste goes, but the texture stopped me from giving it 5 stars overall.

Used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Also, used 3 smallish bananas.  Very tasty.  A little mushy on the inside, but that didn't hurt the final product.  Garnished with sliced banana and walnuts.

My family loved it.  I'm trying for the healthiest options lately, so I made one batch the way the recipe specifies - but substituted apple sauce for the oil - delicious!  Then I made a second batch with some Whole Wheat Graham Flour I found at Wal-Mart - even better!!

This is a simple recipe that yields fantastic results. I ended up only using one ripe banana but the strong aroma and flavor of it really shown when these were done cooking.

I used 2 bananas, not 1 or 1.5 like people suggested.  The bananas I used were not the giant kind you find nowadays in like, Costco or something. I also used the vanilla extract as others suggested, and I subsituted 2T of applesauce for the vegetable oil, which worked fine. I also used skim milk, and I think they turned out fine that way. These have to be cooked on low to medium heat, and thus take very long to make, but I think they're worth it :)

This recipe is great!  The only thing I did different was the addition of some cinnamon to each pancake before I flipped it over.  These pancakes stayed hot longer than plain pancakes probably because of the bananas so that was a real plus!  Definitely will make again.

These tasted good but were pretty mushy in the middle. I think whole wheat flour might take care of the mushiness. I'll experiment with it more. Thanks!

Awesome pancake recipe...I added chocolate chips to a portion of the batch, and also used a syrup recipe I found along with some toasted walnut and topped it all off with powdered sugar.  We love the whole chocolate, banana and walnut combination. Thanks for sharing this recipe

LOVE this recipe!!!  I've always found banana pancake recipes where you add sliced banana pieces after you've poured the batter on the pan.  They've never been that great.  This recipe has you mix the mashed banana into the batter.  SO GOOD!!!  Good way to use those bananas that are starting to brown.

Good, quick, and a great way to use two bananas that would otherwise be lost; even for supper with low cal. maple syrup; when nothing else comes to mind.

These are good, but they're not stellar.  After reading reviews about flat pancakes and mushy centers, I substituted buttermilk for the milk and decreased the bananas to one.  
I also added vanilla and cinnamon and a little nutmeg.  They bake up very fluffy this way but they leave a weird taste in the mouth.  The initial flavor is good, but these leave a powdery aftertaste.  If I make these again, I'm going to decrease the baking soda to 1 teaspoon.

Awesome recipe!  These are dense and rich pancakes, not fluffy, light, and flavorless!  As others suggested I used BROWN sugar and vanilla extract.  I also added an extra banana.  This was much better than any mix!

The taste was ok, but these pancakes were very thin, not very filling for everyone here.  Taste wise was good

The good: easy & tasty. The bad: came out mushy and didn't fluff. The vanilla helped lots and was delicious with cinnamon & brown sugar sauce.

A favorite of mine! Perfect for a leisurely weekend morning or for a "snowed-in" breakfast.  I omit the sugar and it still tastes yummy!!! Great with eggs and a side of sausage.

nice recipe.  I made it this afternoon in heart shaped cookie cutters.  They were so excited about them that they had one for dessert after dinner with chocolate syrup on top.

Great recipe.  I doubled the recipe and added 1 T of vanilla and chopped walnuts and used whole wheat flour for half the flour.  My kids actually ate them cold like cookies later in the day.  Really yummy!

This is an excellent recipe! Some variations which you might like to use: replace 1/2 of the white flour with whole wheat, use soy milk in place of the regular, and add some chopped nuts. I have served these with blueberry syrup instead of maple syrup, which is delicious! An easy and healthy pancake.

These pancakes were very yummy!  I chose to use 100% whole WHITE flour to add some fiber (but doesn't make dense, flat pancakes), added about a teaspoon of vanilla, and used canned milk for a more nutrient-dense recipe for my kids.  I also blended one of the bananas along with the wet ingredients in my Vitamix.  The other banana I sliced into the finished batter.  My daughter said "These are really good pancakes!  They're fluffy but crispy around the edges."  Great banana flavor.  Definately will make these again!

I would actually go with more of a 3.5 rating for this one.  They were good - and loaded with banana flavor (which I LOVED!) however, like others stated previously, they were somewhat mushy on the inside.  I cooked at a lower heat to try to ensure they cooked through and I still had that issue.  I thought they were good, but did offer a slightly different texture than your standard pancake.  Maybe adding more flour to the batter can prevent the mushiness?  I don't know...I did add some chocolate chips and the cakes really hit the spot.  This paired with some of the Scrambled Eggs Done Right from this site made a good breakfast for dinner for me.  Thanks!

Awesome!
I had a tone of very ripe bananas in my freezer and this was a great way to use them up....Very simple to make and was a huge hit!
I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and might just add a bit more next time to experiment with

Wonderful pancakes! A delicious treat! I added buttermilk to mine, otherwise did as recipe stated... turned out so rich, dense and wonderful! Next time I may try some other touches...almond extract, nuts... can't wait!! This time we toped with fresh berry jam and a little whipped cream!!! Definitely make again!!!

Very yummy, our family loved these banana pancakes.  We changed a couple of things due to other reviews, by using buttermilk instead of milk, and cinnamon applesauce for the oil.

Just got done making these and my hubby really enjoyed them. Had no problem of them getting flat or mushy. Added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Cinnamon would be a nice touch. Used 1 and 1/2 regular size bananas for the mix and used the other 1/2 of banana on top of the pancakes. This made seven 1/4 cup size pancakes.

These are a little more mushy, for lack of a better word, than traditional pancakes.  It's obviously because of the bananas but they're pretty good.

I added 1 tsp. vanilla and chopped walnuts. I used 1 medium sized banana the second time I tried it and found that it lacked the distinct banana flavor in the original recipe. Also try using ripe bananas as they definitely have more flavor and mash easily.

I really liked these pancakes.  So did my kids.  They were easy to make.  I too, halved the recipe.  I wouldn't call the results mushy.  They were more crepe-like pancakes. I actually liked them better than a traditional pancake.  I also added the vanilla extract.  This is definitely a recipe I will use often.  It is just too easy!

Very good pancakes.  I followed the recipe exactly.  First one was a little under cooked inside so I turned down the heat to medium and cooked the rest to perfection.  We LOVE the banana flavor and would not change a thing...I spread some peanut butter on the one and only left over and rolled it up for my 2 yr old...so good.

So easy and good!  My children refuse to eat fruit so I love to find sneaky yet edible ways to disguise it.  I followed others' advice and used one banana and cooked on medium.  I also mixed it all in the blender to ensure the banana was pureed and for easy pouring.  The banana flavor was just enough and my family gobbled them up!

I took the advise of other users and added only 1 banana and 1/4 tsp of vanilla. My family thought it was okay, however I felt it need something.

Awesome pancakes!!  Husband and 5 yr old son gave rave reviews.  This recipe will certainly be permanent in our house.  The only change I made was leaving out the nuts since I didn't have any on hand.

I had to rate this!  These are great!  A good way to use up those two bananas that lay around.  For those that thought these were to wet, maybe they over mixed?  Also, for fluffy pancakes, ingredients should be room temp.  My 2 year old was nuts over these!  Thanks so much!

Really sweet but really good.  I put walnuts and chocolate chips on top.  They cooked very nicely and the batter was a good pancake consistency.

Best banana pancakes I've ever had. I tripled the recipe and cooked these "live time" for people at work and they were a BIG hit.  A sprinkle of powdered sugar on the top makes them pretty and tastes good too.

The recipe was good.  I also added a bit of cinnamon which we all liked with it.  I also lowered my heat just a little.  These pancakes seemed to want to burn quickly.  Aside from that my family really liked them.

My boyfriend and I loved these pancakes!  He espically loved that the banana taste was bold; there's no guessing as to whether the bananas were used!  I made small pancakes, but he suggested making a few large pancakes and spreading them with vanilla cream cheese and then rolling them to make a crepe-like treat.  We may do that another time.  ***YUMMY***

These were the lightes, fluffiest and tastiest banana pancakes I have ever tried!  One ingedient you could add to spice things up is cinnamon, or cinnamon sugar instead of white sugar.

These were really good.  I used some of the other's advice and used only 1 banana, a little extra milk, and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I also added a little fresh nutmeg.  Yummy!  Will make again.

These were OK.  Next time, I'll add more flour or something because the texture turned out rather flat and soggy.  The banana flavour was good, though.

These were fine to get something on the table quick. I put everything into the blender to save time. However, it overmixed the batter and my cakes were a bit flat and rubbery. They'd have turned out fine if I'd stirred the batter together by hand. Will try again and serve with sliced bananas on top and warmed syrup and butter.

Eh, fairly unexcited about this one. I scaled it right back as there are only 2 of us and still used a whole banana, and the flavour was very bland in the first one. I had to add some vanilla and cinamon to get my husband to eat them. As I used so much banana, there was a certain gooey-ness to the pancakes that would have been nice if they tasted a bit better.

Perhpas not the best pancakes that I've ever had.  The banana flavor was sort of too strong for me.  I also added half a cup of wheat flour instead of just all purpose flour, to  make it more healthy.  Not bad.

I think this is really good.  Yes, it is a little moist in the middle from the banana.  I did reduce the banana to 1 1/2 after reading other reviews and made sure to make thinner pancakes.  They came out moist, not undercooked.  My children love them.

My son ate them up but I took one bite and threw the rest away. Guess it is good for some and bad for others. Followed the recipe to a T except for adding a bit of cinnamon. Wasn't soggy in the middle.

I'd rate this a 2-1/2.  I thought they were ok; my husband didn't care for them.  I agree that the pancakes didn't firm up and they seemed raw even though they weren't.  They also had a strong baking powder flavor.  Next time I'll use my favority pancake recipe and try adding some banana flavoring - either a liqueur or extract, because I like the concept.

A very tasty breakfast.  I'm not a big fan of bananas but this was good.  My husband and I agreed that it tasted like banana nut bread without the nuts.  It seemed to me it was missing something.  I could of had it a little sweeter.  I will make this again and experiment.  Very easy to make.  Thanks!

I'm an amateur at pancake-making; I had a big phobia of raw pancake middles (since that was my problem with other pancakes I have made), but this recipe turned out really well!  Great served with fresh sliced strawberries!

These were wonderful! A nice change from the ordinary. I doubled the recipe, used melted butter instead of oil, added some vanilla and chocolate chips. Although I added a bit too many as some were just too sweet.

Our family was mixed on the reviews.  I thought they were delicious, my husband (who is funny about textures) thought they were too mushy in the middle, and our kids were split (one liked it, the other didn't).  If I make it again, I would definitely increase the sugar to 1/4 cup and decrease the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp.

these were great.  All I added was a tsp of vanilla extract.  I doubled the recipe so we had extras to freeze for quick breakfast later in the week.  Served with butter pecan syrup.  Will make these again and again.  Thanks for the recipe

these taste great.  Very banana-ey, and my 5 year old loved them!  However, I am really funny about texture, and no amount of cooking was going to get rid of that mushy texture in the middle.  I know they were cooked all the way, maybe more flour or less banana?  I worry that changing either amount would affect the taste.
I doubt I'll make these again, unless my son requests them.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, though!

these had really good flavor. they tasted great with the cinnabutter recipe that is also on this site. however, i didn't like the texture of these. i like a more fluffy, floury pancake. these were flat and moist. just not what i'm looking for in a pancake. i probably won't make these again.

I loved this recipe the first time I made it, but I have had problems making it
again.  I think it may have been caused by the cottage stove and its finicky 
heat settings.  Newer stoves shouldn't be a problem.  Great fluffy pancakes and
a faster way to use up bananas.

I didn't even want to taste these, because they were so soggy.  I put all the wet ingredients in the blender until it was basically banana milk.  I then cooked them at a lower temp. for longer time, as suggested.  Didn't work.  This is the 2nd banana pancake recipe I've tried with same results.  Maybe it's just me!!  I think I'll stick to regular pancakes...

I thought these pancakes were very tasty...my five year old was less than impressed, though.  They were a bit too moist, however.  I had too almost burn them to avoid "mushiness" in the middle.  I would make these again, however.

I liked the taste.  Used egg substitute, skim milk and applesauce (sted the veg oil) to cut down the calories a bit and they were still very tasty.

From all the other comments i used onlyu 1/2 c of milk rather than a whole cup to make the mixture thicker, and i put on a really low fire to cook them but the pancakes still ended up a little too moist to my liking. No one else in my family liked them either

I thought that these pancakes were just 'okay'.  They had a nice flavor, however, they were very thin and not at all fluffy.  I will probably stick with good old fashioned pancakes in the future.

My two year old loved these, but my four year old wasn't impressed.  My husband thought they were "okay", but I really liked them.  I used a margerine/cinnimon/sugar mix to top them with and served apples sauteed in that same mix on the side.   

I think this is an excellent meal to fix overnight guests.  It's simple to make and impressive to serve.

Very good recipe. Didn't put cinnamon since I don't like the taste. Had them with a little butter on top. Good low point recipe for weight watchers. My 2 year old loved them. Will make again.

These are like having candy for breakfast. (only good for you!) Delicious and fill your tummy, perfect for a late breakfast brunch on a lazy Sunday morning.  My daughter eats her pancakes (all kinds) with peanut butter on the side and she said that the peanut butter/banana combo was fantastic!  Definately a keeper.

Yummy. These were delicious! My children (under 4) loved them as did my hubby. I served them with homemade chopped apple "gravy" (sauteed apples, brown sugar, apple juice, cinnamon, and cornstarch to thicken).

Delicious. I added a little bit of cinnamon to the banana mixture to give it more flavor.

My 4 year old liked them, my 12 year old did not like them and neither did I. I am not sure if it was the consistancy of the pancakes or what.  Mine did not come out fluffy, they were gooey and mushy inside.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but will try it again on another Saturday when my husband has to work.

An easy recipe. Good use of older bananas. I added a little sugar to make them sweeter, added nutmeg for flavouring and used extra flour to make them easier to flip. Personally, I didn't like them with maple syrup or ice cream, so I ate them alone. May try speading them with butter, as previously suggested.

These were a bit tricky, hard to flip, since the batter is kind of spongy--I found the best way to cook them is on low heat for longer that you would normal pancakes.  They were quite good without syrup.  I added vanilla and cinnamon.
