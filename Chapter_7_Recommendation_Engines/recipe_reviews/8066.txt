WELL THIS WENT TOGETHER WELL, BUT, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THE BUNDT PAN BUT A TUBE PAN, YOU KNOW AN ANGEL FOOD CAKE PAN WITH THE REMOVABLE BOTTOM, CAUSE I COULD NOT GET MINE OUT OF MY BUNDT PAN AND I GREASED AND FLOURED IT. THE CAKE TASTES GREAT THOUGH BUT NOW THAT IT IS IN PIECES WE WILL EAT IT WITH ICECREAM AND CHOCOLATE SAUCE IN A BOWL, NO PRETTY PIECES HERE.  DEFINITELY WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN BUT IN THE "TUBE/ANGEL FOOD" PAN. I ADDED A SPINKLING OF INSTANT COFFEE POWDER TOO FOR A MORE MOCHA TASTE. BARBARA, IF YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO GET IT OUT OF THE BUNDT PAN I WOULD APPRECIATE IT CAUSE IT WOULD LOOK PRETTY OUT OF THE DECORATIVE BUNDT PAN. GREAT CAKE, WITH A PERFECT SPONGE CAKE TEXTURE.

I am eating Paleo so I look for flourless things as well no refined sugars.  I used unsweetened chocolate and 3/4 cup of honey instead of sugar.  I baked it for the hour but I think that was too long for it was started to burn on the bottom.  Although it says cook for 1 hour or until cake springs back....I didn't think I needed to check it 15 minutes before.  So it was overcooked and a bit dry.  According the review before mine...they had problems  using a Bundt Pan.  For me, it fell right out.  Considering this cake had very little fat....just no stick spray on my Bundt pan worked great.  I'd like to try this recipe again and see how fares with less cooking time.

Well I am a bit surprised that there is no butter, but I guess the oil was supposed to come from almonds. It is kinda dry and it was not easy to fold the egg whites in as the egg yolk+chocolate+ almond meal was very very dry drier than peanut butter consistency. I would put a little more sugar as well Maybe using almond meal/flour ( storebought) caused me to put more than intended. ( as the home ground one would naturally be more fluffier)

My daughter wants this again soon. The yolk/chocolate/almond mixture was like peanut butter which made me feel like the fold was more of a stir, but it worked out with a nice rise and texture.  I will definitely grease and flour the pan before baking the next time. Because the cake stuck to the pan, I broke up the cake and layered it with fresh whipped cream and berries in a glass bowl.  This was still a pretty presentation and enjoyed by all.

Wanted something a bit zippier, but this was a good recipe for inspiration. (1) I used 8 eggs (room temperature) instead of 10 and did not separate; beat for 15 minutes with 1-1/2 cups sugar.  (2) Instead of almond, used 1 cup cake meal with 2 tablespoons tapioca starch/flour. (3) Rather than making a chocolate cake, poured 3/4 batter into very well greased and floured (used cocoa powder) bundt pan, then added melted chocolate to remaining batter and swirled (though recipe works same if you want it chocolate). (4) Baked for exactly 50 minutes, cooled for 10 than inverted onto cake plate. (5) Cooled fully, then can either use powdered sugar or, as I did, add a ganache topping. Made twice and nothing but rave reviews! Keeps well out in air tight container for a few days, so you can make a day (or two) in advance and it holds up.
