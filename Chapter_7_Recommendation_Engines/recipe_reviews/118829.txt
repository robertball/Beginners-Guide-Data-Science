Great pasta salad! Pasta salads are so easy and no matter what you add to them as long as the veggies are fresh, you use a good quality dressing, and it's chilled - it'll be delicious. So add what you like. This recipe is a great base. I used tri-colored pasta, a whole bunch of cherry tomatoes that I cut in half, used one red onion instead of two, red pepper instead of green and added some black olives along with the cucumber. For the dressing I used Good Seasons Italian dressing mix (so it was kinda homemade, and kinda not). I also threw in some shredded Parmesan cheese and instead of using Salad Supreme Seasoning I used "Tasty Salad Seasoning" from this site - it's fabulous. This recipe is a definite keeper and much cheaper than getting it from the deli!

I used Smart Taste pasta, only a quarter of a red onion that I diced (I can't imagine that my family would have been crazy about two whole red onions in one salad), and I used red bell pepper instead of green (we don't care for green peppers). For the salad supreme seasoning, I used one whole batch of DC Girly Girl's Tasty Salad Seasoning, which is also from this site. We thought this was very tasty! I think this would be good with cubed provolone or sharp cheddar cheese or maybe even cubed salami to make a complete meal for hot summer days.

Excellent!  I made this for a baby shower and it was a hit!  I changed the veggies a bit - I used matchstick carrots, halved grape tomatoes, diced red bell pepper and broccoli.  I also only used half the bottle of salad seasoning and the flavor was great.

Its a good recipe, i used the tricolor pasta, wishbone zesty itallian dressing, grape tomatoes, sliced carrots, red onion, broccoli and cauliflower and i add southwest chicken breast strips in the pkg along with any variety of cubed cheese for a complete meal. You can make many different combinations with the many vegetables out there.

Been making this for years except with vermicelli broken into 1-2" pieces before cooking. Also don't use cuke's and only 1 each of the onion (chopped) and green bell pepper. I always marinate over night and add the chopped tomatoes right before serving. Everyone loves it and we call it Fantastic Pasta Salad!

This pasta salad seems to be the quick "go-to" salad everyone has been using for years ... and with good reason ... its soooo easy to throw  together, it makes a large serving, and with the fresh ingredients its really refreshing on a hot summer day.  As others have stated the veggie choices are endless.  Using grape tomatoes will saving you time and they also present nice when halved.  I personally skip the onion and cucumber and stick with the tomato and green pepper.  BUT to really kick up the flavor and turn on the Italian, I toss in quartered sliced pepperoni, sliced black olives, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese just before serving.  Also, the pasta does tend to absorb some of the dressing if you are not serving right away (and you shouldn't ... it needs time to chill and blend), so I  save a bit of the Italian dressing to add just before serving.  I have also at times tossed in some cubed monterey cheese and that has always been well received.  Whatever your choices you will be pleased with this pasta salad starter!

I love this pasta salad, it's so versatile.  You can use any veggies you like or pasta for that matter.  Sometimes I will add diced salami and cheese, just ask for an extra thick cut at the deli.

We've been making this pasta salad for years.  You can use whatever veggies or pasta you have on hand (we usually use linguine) and it's easy to scale to the amount of people you're serving.  Just use the Italian dressing and Salad Supreme to taste.  Thanks for sharing!

This was o.k.  Makes a lot, but doesn't keep that well...I think due to the cucumbers.  I might make it again for a family reunion but would need to make a few changes. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2007. It was great!  Everyone loved it and I will make it for pot-luck lunches, etc.  I added some broccoli and red pepper and cherry tomatoes.

I have made this salad for years and have gotten great responses. Any potluck I am asked to make it, Salad Supreme is the key. I have also found that using the cheapest dressing works best. I add olives, green onions instead of red and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. I also make a mayonnaise dressing version just be sure to salt your pasta water and check your seasonings.

I have made this for years.  However, I prefer the English cucumber (without so many seeds) to regular cucumbers as it holds up better.  I also marinate veggies and dressing overnight and then cook pasta in the morning.  The recipe I have calls for plain Spaghetti noodles, but have used all sorts.  It is perfect to take on a picnic because you don't have to worry about spoiling.

I also use the grape tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes so it will keep longer.  Plus I love to add green onions.

Very good! Simple and tasty. I used Tasty Salad Seasoning (from this site) and it worked very well. I added sliced green olives at hubby's request and skipped the onions. I cut the recipe down to 5 servings and only used about 1/4 of a green pepper, which was just right for our preferences. Thanks! :)

Really good - we have make ours with creamy italian dressing and leave out the cucumbers.  This salad is better if you make it the night before.  If it gets too dry, just squeeze the juice of one lemon into it and stir.

This is a really good salad. I used tri-color spirals, cucumbers, yellow onions, green bell pepper, Wish Bone "Robusto" Italian salad dressing and then topped with tomato/basil feta cheese; also added black pepper. I DID NOT USE the Salad Supreme seasoning because I didn't have any and it didn't seem necessary. However, the salad tasted great! Church members have requested it for the next fellowship dinner.

This was a pretty good pasta salad.  I scaled the recipe to half and used grape tomatoes in lieu of the large tomato.  I also added some halved black olives and cracked black pepper.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, lana Boyd!

This is a family favorite at our house. I do make a salad very similar to this recipe, but I add alot of other ingredients. Everyone always asks for this at bbq's.

I made this as a change from fries the last time we had burgers. I really enjoyed it, and my husband liked it as well, even though he's not a big fan of pasta salad. I halved the recipe, and used red bell pepper instead of green, but made no other changes. We topped our individual servings with Parmesan before eating. It was very easy, but a little expensive, so I doubt I'll be making it very often. Thanks.
