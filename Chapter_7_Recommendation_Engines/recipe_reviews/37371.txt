This is a lot like Brunswick stew I get in Georgia at BBQ restaurants. The only thing missing is pulled pork. I added about 1/4 cup of rib sauce, and a couple of tablespoons of "liquid smoke" to give it that just out of the pit taste. Fabulous!

Really tasty stew.  I substituted a can of great northern beans for the "baked beans," and used the chicken broth instead of water (per another reviewer's suggestion) but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  Next time I'll add a little less sugar - I'll be making this one again!

Another great Southern Living Keeper.  Why not use that nice, rich chicken broth instead of water with the flour to thicken?

I wish I could give this one even more stars!!!  What a great recipe.  Made it for 25.....should have scaled it for 50 because they ate it up and I didn't have anything left to feeze.  The changes I made along the way was to increase the turmeric and hot sauce (my customers like it a little spicier).  As sometimes happens, I got a little busy while making the broth and cooked the chicken longer than directed....it fell off the bone and shredded nicely on it's own....a small miscalculation that turned out to advantage.  Definitely worth the time to make.

Delicious recipe, even my kids love it.  To simplify the recipe, I use 1/2 to 3/4 bag of frozen hash browns instead of the red potatoes.  They cook faster and taste just as good.  Just add bread and you have a complete meal.

I resized this to feed 240 and served it cooked in a 20 gallon cast iron cauldron at a football tailgate party.  I added Tony Cachere cajun seasoning, liquid smoke, and Mrs. Dash and received the best compliments of any dish I have ever served. This is a fantastic recipe.

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!  Very tasty. Added celery and garlic to onion and bell pepper.  I like it hot so added more fire ( habanero chili).
Will do again.

This is very good and healthy! I added kidney beans to this. Also, I didn't have any turmeric and instead of cooking the onion in the oil I just chopped it up and cooked in some water for less fat.

This is a family favorite.  I've been making this for a couple of years, and it always gets eaten.  I use frozen limas and corn, and I add a bag of sliced up okra.  Otherwise, it's perfection.

I always get compliments on this one.  It is supposed to be thick--it is a STEW, not a soup. To save time, i use already deboned and skinned chicken breasts and thighs and canned potatotes too if i am really short on time.

freezes very well.

Excellent, I only used two cans of tomatoes per other reviews, also used some of the chicken broth in lieu of water.  Everybody LOVED (my 8 year old picked out the tomatoes, but otherwise loved it) this recipe and it was not hard to make! I didnt have any turmeric either, I dont know if I will add it next time or not.

We really liked this recipe.  I added a package (16oz) frozen veggies for soup found in the frozen section of your supermarket.  If it is a little thick add chicken or beef broth.  As I understand Brunswick stew is suppose to be thicker than soup anyway.  Cooked mine in 2 crockpots for 10hrs on low.  My meat was a combo of venison and chicken.  YUM!!!!!

This came out horrible it was way too sweet and theres way to much tomato sauce also the chicken shredded to pieces, it looked like a mess when I added it to the stew. It had a peculiar smell and taste as well.
My husband did not like it, he could not finish it. I will never make this again!

The best vegetable soup I've ever eaten.  A little time consuming, but SO easy.  I used vegetable broth instead of water.  It is a stew rather than a soup, so if you want more liquid add an extra cup or two of broth.  I also added about 1-1/2 c. frozen okra with the corn and lima beans.  Serve with cornbread.  Yum!

You don't need to change a thing.  Although I used frozen hash brown potatoes for ease.  I also used frozen limas and corn because that is what I buy and 3-3 oz boneless skinless chicken breasts for a lower fat alternative.  Great to portion up in tupperware for easy meals.

Very good Brunswick Stew! I used a rotisserie chicken which saved a lot of work and thus reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. since the rotisserie chicken was already seasoned. I found that the amount of hot sauce was a tad hot (and got cumulatively hotter with each bite) so next time I'll half it. Also cut the sugar by half. I added thinly sliced diced carrots and 1/2 cup of hickory BBQ sauce. Although not traditional, could add some sliced okra. This is a keeper!

Awesome!! My hubby loves this, it is truly a favorite in my home. I find it quite comical when people come here and say that they loved this soup, but they completely changed the ingredients leaving important ingredients out!! LOL, I get a kick out of that, cause if you do that then it isn't Brunswick Stew!!!!

This brunswick stew tasted just like the stuff you get a BBQ joints here in NC.  The only things I changed were:  I've always had brunswick stew with chicken and pork. . . so I got some country style pork ribs and boiled them for 30 minutes and baked them for 1 hours.  The meat just fell off the bone.  I left out the bell peppers and the onion.  I cooked it in a slow cooker for 2 hours and didn't add the potatoes, lima beans and corn until the last 30 minutes.  It was delicious.

The best Brunswick Stew recipe ever! Nothing like the frozen kind you buy in fund raisers. It is extremely flavorful and tangy~! Would not change a thing and have about three frozen containers for later!!! Will make again in the winter. Thanks!

I made this with leftover BBQ pork and cooked it in the crock pot for 4 hours.  I thought it had to much vinegar and tobasco but everyone ate 2 bowls so it must have been better than I thought!

This stew is excellent.   I have been using this recipe for several years now.   My husband grew up with Brunswick Stew, he believes this is the best.   It freezes great too.  I make this all the time.   It amazes me that not many look at this recipe.   I have changed up how I do it, to make it easier.   I roast a chicken in the oven.   I put everything else in a crock pot.   I steam the potatoes till they are almost done.   Today all I had was russet, so that is what is in there.   Then take the chicken off the bone and put it in the crock too.   I don't use water only chicken broth from the chicken.   It is so good, and a cheap meal.   Freezes well.   It is better and thicker the next day when everything has had time to blend together.   If you find it to thick, I have added more chicken broth.

Others consider me a gourmet cook, with 20 plus years experience, using various methods of cooking.
I have never had Brunswick Stew before, but thought I would try this. Although I have no measurement to measure this against other Brunswick Stew recipes, I found this particular recipe was not impressive. My family let it sit in the refrigerator. I will not make this again.

This recipe is the best!!! My husband could not stop eating it. It was so rich and flavorful. I added a little bit more hot sauce to mine which made it a little bit more spicy. Other than that I would not change a thing. I'll be making this agian real soon.

What a disappointment! The worst Brunswick Stew I've ever had.  I believe that the can of baked beans is what ultimately ruined this recipe, although the stew itself had an offensive odor!  Would not make again.

This stew is excellent!  The only change I made is a added about 3/4 cup bbq sauce towards the end of cooking just because I love the flavor bbq sauce gives to brunswick stew.  Awesome recipe, the whole family loved it..even the 4 and 5 year olds!

The consistency of the soup is a bit thick for me.
I added an extra 3 cups of water.  Otherwise, this gets two thumbs up from me!
