I was searching for an Orange Cranberry Relish and your recipe was the first to come up. I have not made it yet but, since my maiden name is Strachan I must try it!!! I'm sure it will be delicious and I will say its an old family recipe! LOL!

I didn't have the triple sec and it tasted wonderful without it. I will be making this again.

I loved it!  Decided to cook the chopped cranberries a few mins as I wasn't sure my hubby would like them raw.  This recipe is awesome!

I really liked this recipe and everyone liked it. I didn't have Triple Sec, as I usually do - but I used 2 teaspoons of Orange bitters, instead. it worked out great! Having too much walnuts in other Christmas dishes, I opted to add pecans instead. Very good!

In my opinion, the Cinnamon ruins this recipe.
