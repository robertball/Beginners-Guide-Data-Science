I thought this was fantastic! I made it for my husband on his birthday and he liked it better than our favorite Thai place. I used 3 teaspoons of curry paste instead of one to add some more flavor/spice as well as a teaspoon of course salt. My picky 3 year old cleaned her plate!

Fantastic! So good we had no leftovers! Very easy to make. Served it with brown rice. Next time I will add a little more curry paste as we like ours a little spicier.

We loved this! My future changes to suite our tastes will be to add 1/2 C of chicken broth mixed with 2 Tbs of corn starch to thicken it and make the sauce go a little farther. I added frozen green beans just before covering and they added a nice contrast to the yellow and orange bell pepper. This one is a keeper.

Make certain to use curry paste and not curry sauce. This comes in a tiny jar and is thick like school paste. Very potent try the 1tsp first. If you'd like it spicier once the sauce is assembled you can always blend more paste with a spoonful of the sauce then add to the pan. this way you don't wind up with hidden chunks of paste.

As suggested by another review I greatly increased the red curry paste. I tripled it and I could have added even more. Also since I am not a huge fish fan when I make this again I will add less fish sauce. SO more curry paste and less fish sauce makes a great tasting dish that I love.

I found it very bland. Perhaps the brand of curry paste makes a big difference but I even added twice as much of the Pataks red curry sauce and it still wasn't very tasty. I tried some garam masala on it and it helped a little.

Very yummy!! I can't have spicy foods and used a mild curry instead of the red that's why the sauce in my pictures looks whiter. I also seasoned the chicken lightly before cooking it and then adjusted the salt level at the end.

I found it good but a bit bland. To add more taste I doubled the curry paste doubled the sugar added sliced mushrooms ginger a pinch of salt and the juice of one lime. I also added a handful of fresh cilantro before serving over a bowl of coconut rice. The coconut rice helped add a bit more flavor to the curry.

Loved it! I cut the chicken into bite sized chunks and trippled the curry paste. I also doubled the sugar and added red pepper flakes in place of the fish sauce. I added corn starch to thicken the sauce. Yum!

i really liked this dish with a few modifications.. i think i was trying to make this taste like Lime-Curry Tofu Stir-Fry (on this site) because i ended up adding 2 T lime juice and 2 t minced ginger.. i also added some mushrooms and 1.5 t soy sauce.. and definitely tripled if not quadrupled the amount of the curry paste.. i used sweetener (sucarlose) for the sugar and half the fish sauce.. this to me was the healthier version of Lime-Curry Tofu Stir-Fry that i was looking for.. ty for the recipe
