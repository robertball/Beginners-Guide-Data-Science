I've been making this basic recipe for years with a couple differences:  I used a yellow cake mix with the juice from the pineapple in place of the water (add water to the juice if necessary).  I've used pineapple tidbits and rings cut up to fit instead of the crushed pineapple. Crushed pineapple can sometimes make the cake under it too mushy sometimes.  Instead of putting the batter directly into the muffin pan, I used paper liners which is so much easier for lunches and serving at picnics.  It's a surprise when they take the paper off to eat it!  It's basically sweet enough for me to eat like this but occasionaly I've dusted powdered sugar on top of the cupcakes after slightly cooled.  Oh, and if you're a coconut lover, add a little to the brown sugar before laying in the pineapple and cherries.  This is a great recipe anyway you make it!

Loved these! Of course baking from scratch is always nice, but this is a great way to make a yummy finger food snack without the extra work. To me adding the pineapple juice to the Duncan Hines cake mix gave it a real extra flavor boost (thanks for the tip!) I don't understand people who rate recipes down for using a mix aid, IF YOU DON'T LIKE MIX THEN DON'T MAKE THE RECIPE.

I made these this morning and they turned out great. Some people were saying to use pineapple tidbits so to see which would be better I made half with crushed and half with tidbits. The crushed looked and tasted better by leaps and bounds.  Otherwise I made them per the recipe with no alterations of substitutions, which is not like me. Here is my advice - Use parchment paper not wax, they stick worse to wax. Move them to a cool place in the kitchen both before and after inverting them, they easily get "sticky" on the bottom (cake side). I found that 20 minutes was not enough so I went about 24 to get them done. I also found it was a pain trying to push down the pineapple while keeping the cherry in the middle and covering the bottom completely. Put the pineapple down and then push the cherry through and down to the bottom to make this a ton easier.

I am a scatch baker as well, but we all need a short cut now and then. Made these for Easter today, along with a turkey, ham, ETC. Made 3 desserts and this one came out of the oven just in time to be served warm! Can you say Yummy!!! And pretty :)
Thank you. Update: had so many requests for this again, did it today for Easter. Used a yellow cake mix (all I had) and a real pineapple that I had that was over ripe. Awesome!! Cleaned pineapple, put slices in a gallon Ziploc and squeezed them into mush. Put in a mesh strainer and pressed the juice out as much as possible, ended up with well over 2 cups. Used juice and pineapple as instructed. Came out perfect!! 13 ppl for Dinner 0 cakes left!

I don't know why I never thought to make little individual cakes like this before!  I made my own cake from scratch but followed this recipe for the instructions with glaze, assembly, and cooking time.  Delicious!  Each little cupcake had just the right amount of caramel glaze and the little tidbits of pineapple were so much easier to eat than the big rings in the traditional recipe.  This one is a keeper!  The kids had so much fun helping with this too.  (I discovered after that the kids used 1 T. of melted butter in each muffin cup not 1 t. maybe that's why it was so good.  :o)

Oh these came out wonderfully.  I used my larger muffin pans to make single serving cakes so there was more pineapple at the top of the cakes.  I would recommend this recipe to all.

This was very easy and very moist and delicious.We don't like the cherries, so I did not use those and I used about 1 1/2 tsp of butter in each dish and a heaping Tbsp of Dark Brown Sugar in each.  I also used Pineapple Tidbits instead of crushed pineapple.  I only had just over 1 cup of pineapple juice, so I added 1/3 cup of water.  Definitely a must make if you like Pineapple Upside Down Cake.

I used fresh cherry halves, pineapple canned in light syrup, and lemon cake mix to which I added a lemons worth of lemon zest  and the same of juice along with the pineapple water - from the can. Used apple sauce in place of oil and only two eggs (that is all I had).  I used  about half a teaspoon of brown sugar AND of agave syrup on each of my cupcakes. 

They were pretty and deliciously moist!!

Used crushed pineapple, squeezed the juice from it & had plenty of juice.  Instead of melting the butter, I dropped a thin pat & covered it with about a tsp of brown sugar.  Delish!

I first made these from a REALLY old Better Homes and Gardens cookbook. My shortcut was a yellow cake mix. I used pineapple slices, cut in half with the cherry in the "divot", but I like all the other ways to present. The paper liners I used turned to mush so I tried the foil liners and it worked better. Love this recipe and the hints, like adding coconut! Thanks everyone! Its such a happy food.

Very good!  I could not bring myself to use the whole tablespoon of sugar for each so I cut that in half and a little less butter with no problem at all.  One thing to remember, the newer cake mixes are a smaller size so I only used 1 cup of pineapple juice with the cake mix.

Not bad for a "doctored up" cake mix recipe. I want to try this with a scratch cake recipe, however. A true pineapple upside cake uses a sponge cake, and this turns out light and fluffy. 

One tip: don't let the cakes sit on the waxed paper too long, or the bottoms will get moist and gummy. Once you know the topping won't drip any more, transfer them to a cooling rack to finish cooling.

Easiest and best Pineapple upside down cake EVER! I used yellow cake mix, couldn't find the pineapple cake mix and it works great. You add pineapple juice into the batter anyway. I also used the large muffin pans, so I doubled the melted butter and the brown sugar that goes in the bottom of the pan.

This was a very good recipe, and easy. I made large cupcakes and i did not have the full amount of pineapple juice so i added water for the remaining amount i was short to make the 1 1/3c. turned out just fine! I also added the extra pineapple to the cake mix.

OMG these are the B E S T upside down cupcakes ever.  Not only are they moist but the flavor from using pineapple juice even makes them more.  I also added some cherry juice  in the second batch for a little variety.   Thank you for this great recipe that will be enjoyed for generations!

Great idea, & hubby really like this, but won't be doing again with this recipe.  I think it is way to sweet.  I will make my usual recipe of Upside Down Cake & put some in cupcake tin though as I like having the smaller sizes.  One thing to make sure is that the butter & brown sugar are mixed together in the cupcake tin before adding pineapple & cake mix.  If they aren't the sugar is lumpy & crystalized instead a smooth buttery top.

I made these once, following directions exactly - five stars.  I made these a second time - thought I also followed exactly - hot mess because the toppings stuck in the pan and I couldn't get cupcakes out cleanly.  I do not know what subtle difference I must have done. I'm not sure I will chance trying these again to take someplace in case they stick all over the pan again.  The flavor though is wonderful, so I will try these again for the family.

Yum! My tablespoons of pineapple must have been heaping because it took 1.5 cans of crushed pineapple.  Like others, I drained the pineapple and used the juice in a yellow cake mix. The cake batter was very runny, and it took a scant third cup to fill each muffin hole.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Turned out delicious and moist!!! Followed the recipe with the first batch (only had a 6 muffin pan) and I put too much batter in it. With the next batch I only filled them up just a bit over half way and they came out perfect. I would recommend that you let them sit for a couple hours before you eat them. I ate one as soon as it cooled off enough and was disappointed because I didn't really like them. My boyfriend came in after his shift and ate one and was absolutely raving about them. I thought he was just being a nice supportive boyfriend but after I tried another one it changed my mind. Don't ask me why but they tasted a million times better!

I liked it, but I had my doubts the whole time because the picture is clearly not the same as the recipe (hint hint: the recipe says crushed pineapple whereas the picture has diced).  However, I tried it anyway.  I have 17 (not 24) cupcakes (and a lot of extra batter as I ran out of pineapples, butter, and cherries when I used the exact measurements listed above), and my cupcakes look like absolute .  They're goopy, sticky, brown sugary globs of how-am-I-going-to-serve-this.  And they are delicious... a trick for getting them out of the muffin tins:  Place the waxed paper on top of the muffin tin, then put a cooling rack upside down on top of the waxed paper.  Hold on tight and flip!  I had a sticky, sugar-hardened pan, and after I loosened my cupcakes with my trusty plastic butter knife, they all slid right out.  If they weren't so messy and they didn't look so bad, I would give this all five stars!  Definitely worth another try to see if I can make them look as good as they taste (and smell)!

I made these as my son's 7th birthday school treat, per his request for pineapple upside down cake for school.  I will have to take his and his teacher's word for it that they were good, since there were none left for me to try one!  She said that they were so moist and full of flavor.  I did add a bit of the cherry juice to the mix as well as using pineapple rings, cut in pieces.

I made 12 cupcakes and a small cake with the rest of the batter.  This tasted just okay, the one positive I can say is that it was moist.  Tasted like pineapples, but with pineapple mix, juice and pineapple pieces - not sure what else it should have tasted like.

 I won't make again, because I think a better recipe must be out there.

I love this recipe.  I made it for my father on  Father's Day.  They turned out Beautiful, for being so simple to make.  I did take the advice of one other review and added only 1 cup of pineapple juice because the store bought cake mix was smaller than what the recipe called for.  Definitely will make again.

So easy to make & they have eye appeal!  I used the Pampered Chef mini bundt cake pan.  These are larger than cupcakes so I added another 5 minutes to the baking time.  Your kitchen will smell delightful.??

Made this for a co workers "workaversary". Everybody loved it! I didn't have enough pineapple juice so I added a little water and I used yellow cake mix because that's all I had. It turned out awesome! They were so pretty and tasted great!

Great recipe. I used both crushed and tidbits. The tidbits came out of the pan easier but both look and smell awesome.

I love this recipe! I used diced pineapples instead of chunk pineapples for a more structured look and cut the cherries in half. the juice from the can was more then enough, so I didn't have to use the extra juice I purchased.

These are so beautiful but they are time consuming, for sure!  I didn't have enough pineapple juice so I supplemented with water.  I used pineapple tidbits and that worked out really well.  I'm proud of myself for making these!

I've made these two ways now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they came out simply awesome. The next time I made these I saved the juice from the cherries and used it along with the juice from the new jar in place of the pineapple juice. Since I had to use a little water to make up the 1 1/3 cup of liquid it calls for I also used 1/2 teaspoon of cherry oil. They came out equally as delicious. This is a great recipe with many possibilities. Thanks for sharing.

One word for this recipe is YUMMY.  I did not have cooking spray so used liners instead. (Will use the cooking spray next time.) Some of the brown sugar came off on liner, but did not take away from the flavor or presentation of the cupcake. Will definitely use this recipe again.

First of all, these tasted really good, but making them was a disaster.  I made two batches at different times, and out of 48 cupcakes I got 24 that were nice, and maybe another 12 that were passable, and the rest I heaped into a bowl, because many of them stuck to the pan and fell apart, in spite of the pan being well-greased.  The second time around, I loosened the edges with a small knife, and that helped somewhat.  I also tried inverting them immediately on removing them from the oven, per the directions on the cake mix box, but that had similar results.

The recipe did not say to use the pineapple that came with the mix in addition to the 22 oz. can, but it was needed.  It did not say whether or not to drain the pineapple, but I did.  There was probably enough juice from the can that I wouldn't have needed to purchase separate pineapple juice.  It also said to use heaping TBSPs of pineapple, but I had just enough with level TBSPs. 

There was just enough batter to go around, and it was not enough to fill the cups to the top, as indicated.  20 minutes was not enough bake time.  They took 5-10 minutes longer to bake.  

Caveat:  do a trial run before making these for company or a group.  Also, I did not read the reviews before making this, so maybe someone else had the same experience--wish I had looked.

I might make these again, but likely I'll make them as a cake in an 8x8 pan instead.

My family absolutely loved these little cakes.  My mom compared them to the top of a muffin since they're the best part that you really want to eat.  She liked that the ratio of topping to cake was higher than in a standard pineapple upside down cake.  The only problem I had was getting these out of the muffin tins- a lot of the topping was left behind and I ended up scooping it out and spreading it on top of the cakes.  I think this was mostly due to the crushed pineapple.  Next time I think I will use larger pineapple pieces or rings.

Love this recipe. Every time I make these they're all gone within a day. Everyone loves them. They're light and moist and very delicious. If you can't find pineapple cake mix, white cake mix will do. Substitute pineapple juice instead of water in the directions on the back of cake mix box

Great recipe. I'm not much of a baker but these sounded too good to pass up. I did find that I had to leave them in for about 35 minutes as opposed to the 20 in the directions. Otherwise very happy with them and plan to make again.

My Hubby and kids all liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly except like other reviewers I used pineapple ring cut up.  I must admit I overfilled and so ran short of the 24 cupcakes it's supposed to make.  Next time I'll use a bigger muffin pan as someone else suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

Just made theses and LOVE them.  I used pineapple chunks and cut them in half.  Was the perfect amount.  Cake came out fluffy and was just the right size for one portion.  I will definately make these again without a second thought.

Great cupcake idea.  Instead of the usual chocolate or vanilla, these were a hit.  I did change it up just a bit.  I used Krusteaz Orange/Cranberry Fat Free muffin mix.  Discard the orange/cranberry can that comes with.  Make mix as directed on box (very easy just add water)  To make 36 cup cakes I used four boxes of mix.  Do not follow baking directions on box.  Use THIS recipe's baking directions of 20 minutes at 350.  Otherwise butter and brown sugar ooze.  Anyway, before inverting, trim bottom of cupcake/muffins so they sit flat.
A great desert and almost fat free, (darn butter) :)

Have made this many times before finding the recipe posted.  I rated it a 4 because of the changes I usually make for the topping. I melt 1 TBSP butter and 1+ TBSP brown sugar in the muffin tin for the brown sugar / butter instructions.  I also don't need the dusting of powdered sugar.

Perfect!  I used chuck canned pineapple and then chopped to a crushed consistency.  I used yellow cake mix as it was all I had on hand but with the pineapple juice had plenty pineapple flavor!!  I heated my oven to 400 * and the turned it down to 350* to bake them.  I baked 18 minutes then turned my pan around and baked another 3 minutes.  Let cool about 10 minutes and I used a butter knife to help loosen  the edges of the little cakes to help with inverting.  Tuned them on parchment paper then  right side up quickly.  Perfect!

These are great. I did use pineapple juice instead of water in the cake mix like some suggested so I needed an extra can of pineapples. They are sticky so when I packed them to take to work, I placed each on on its own piece of parchment paper.

These are delicious!  I really liked that the ratio of fruit/brown sugar to cake is greater than with a standard cake.  I used a classic yellow cake mix with 1 cup pineapple drained from a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks.  As another reviewer mentioned, the cake mix was a bit smaller than called for in the recipe (15 oz vs 18 oz), so 1 cup liquid was just right.  I cut the pineapple chunks in half and placed 3-4 in each muffin cup with 1/2 maraschino cherry in the center as shown in the photo.  Important:  when adding the cake batter, fill no more than half full.  I made 12 cupcakes directly in the pan (well greased) and 12 in paper muffin cups.  There was enough batter remaining to make an additional small (5" cake).  The only problem I had was that some of the butter/brown sugar remained stuck in both the pan and the paper cups (hence 4 starts instead of 5), so I probably won't make this for any more than a very casual occasion.

I made these today to take to work potluck. I didn't notice until after first batch that the Duncan Hines pineapple cake mix is no longer 18.25 ounces but it is  15.25. That explains why my batter was so thin. For my next batch I will only add 1 cup of pineapple juice instead of 1 1/3 as the box calls for 1 cup of water. I made them in mini muffin pans and had to be extra careful not to put too much of the topping in. Since it was already thin batter they got very wet with the toppings. I couldn't get them out of the pan.

I messed up the first batch. I goofed and put too much juice and oil! LOL. They were edible but dense and tough. The second batch nailed it. I also used cupcake paper liners. Easy recipe (if you read, LOL), this one's a keeper.
P.s. I used yellow cake mix.

I used a blueberry instead of a cherry. I didn't change anything else. And the cupcakes fell apart, wouldn't come out of the pan, and made a huge mess.

I made this according to the recipe and would certainly make it again.  I made them to go in my husband's lunch as he loves pineapple upside down cake.  Since it makes 24 servings, I froze them in a plastic container.  Once they were frozen solid, I transferred them to a freezer bag.  Handy little dessert.  Great recipe.

So moist and delicious!  Came out markedly better in silicone muffin cups than in metal.  Did half and half, and the silicone ones popped right out and looked beautiful.  The metal pan released the cupcake but left most of the topping behind so it had to be spooned back on top.  These are really, really good.  The crushed pineapple on each cupcakes is more like 1/2 Tbsp. than a heaping Tbsp.  These are fabulous, and my son always requests them for his birthday.

My husband likes anything with pineapple. I followed this recipe to a T I will try it than add whatever to the recipe if I want the next time. This is perfect don’t need to change anything! This recipe made 24-25 nice size little cakes they were gone by the next day. I had only one! Now this is between 3 people! Definite hit.

These are awesome! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used crushed pineapple. I squeezed 1 cup of juice from the 20 oz can. 20 oz of crushed was not enough for 24 cupcakes. I got about 16 cupcakes of pineapple. I baked mine for 22 minutes. They were light brown. I used a silicone cupcake pan which made it easier to push them out. They came out easily after the 5 minute rest. These are so tasty!

I've made this recipe many times, it's great as written but I've also tried several variations. My favorite is to use pound cake mix - the cake holds up much better. I also use chunks of pineapple. Delicious.

I used a boxed yellow cake mix and substituted the water for pineapple juice.  I also used pineapple rings which I cut into sections and when I ran out of those I used tidbits .  The taste of the cupcakes was  fine, but the texture was a bit mushy.  A few actually fell apart while trying to get them out of the pan.  I was just not happy with how gooey and nearly soggy they were.  Perhaps I will reduce the amount of butter and sugar on the bottoms the next time.

I used yellow cake mix instead of pineapple and avocado oil instead of canola. And I didn't have any crushed pineapple so I used two large cans of rings. They were to die for! I made them two weeks ago for a potluck at work and just got done making another batch right now. They were that good!

this is the closest to the traditional recipe that i've used for years, so i printed it out and gave to my son to make on st. pat's (i was making the colcannon). we added two more tablespoons of sugar, because the bread i remember was slightly sweet. made and baked two loaves, and people couldn't get enough of it. :)

Had great hopes for this recipe when I made it according to instructions. Will not make again. Too labor intensive. And because the muffins don’t cook as long as a full cake would, the brown sugar doesn’t caramelize while cooking so it remained grainy. Had great difficulty with the cupcakes releasing from the muffin tin. Had to scoop the stuck topping (at least half of the topping of each of the 24 cupcakes) and reapply it individually to make sure each cupcake had the yummy topping. After all of that was done, they looked cute and tasted good (especially if you like the crunch of the brown sugar), but just took waaaay too much time. Will make a traditional recipe when I want Pineapple Upside Down Cake again. Just my opinion...

As a child my son would say, "Pineapple Upside Down" and his father and I would say "Cake"! For his 36th birthday I made these using ramekins including a large one, just for him. We don't really like maraschino cherries, so I got some dried Montmorency ones and rehydrated them first and used them instead. I also added the water from the cherries to the pineapple juice to make enough liquid. They were a huge hit with everyone! I will be making this family favorite this way again!!

Working in a church cooking for about a hundred this is a favorite. We do it a bit different. We make 3 hotel pans at a time and it comes out great. We do as many others drain the pineapple and use that juice in the cake mix

Delicious and easy. I did use pineapple juice in place of water in the mix and used tidbits instead of crushed pineapple. Tidbits take more time for placement but much prettier outcome I think. The crowd at my Luau LOVED them. They don’t need to know it was a box cake!

These cupcakes are clever and creative in the sense that these are mini cakes. The presentation is beautiful. This recipe was perfect for our Easter meal. I could not find the pineapple cake mix and used yellow. It was fine. I also had fresh pineapple and chopped it finely.  What a delightful recipe!

This time I didn't change anything.  Oh my, sure was good. I like the idea of making in muffin tins because everyone gets the right amount.  It was so good, I had to have two. I am making it again tomorrow.

I made these twice and while the taste is amazing, both times most of the topping stayed in the pan when I inverted them.  I had to scoop it out and spread on the individual cakes.  I haven't seen too many reviews where this is the problem and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I cooled at least 15 mins but maybe they have to be cooled longer?  They are tasty but I don't think I'll be making them again.

Absolutely delicious. We’re full time RVers and cupcakes work great. We used the jumbo cup holders. Will not use crushed pineapple next time. Too much moisture. Cubes or ring.

My child and I made these - great taste fun morning.  We used a yellow Duncan Hines cake mix.  We used pineapple juice instead of water.  Once cooled, I made sure to run a butter knife around the edges of the cupcake.  I placed parchment paper on top of cupcakes, next put a huge cookie sheet (turned over so that the bottom of the sheet pan touched the parchment paper) then held it all together to flip the entire thing over.  Gave the pan a good knock on the counter and they all popped out (except one which I lifted out).  Looked great!

I am reviewing the original recipe; not a modified version. I made this cupcake version of the pineapple upside down cake and really enjoyed serving and eating the individual cupcakes (as opposed to cutting up a cake). It was delicious just like the cake version. Since my cupcake pans tend to stick even with cooking spray, I opted to use the foil cupcake liners which worked great. I did not add the optional confectioners sugar and it was definitely sweet enough with just the brown sugar. Those who prefer a less-sweet version might choose to use less brown sugar. And those who prefer a rich buttery taste should use butter instead of vegetable oil in the recipe.

Fabulous!   I'm asked to make these for my friends birthday every year. I use my large cupcake pan and make 12 cupcakes.   Have to say that I use Oregon canned dark cherries. Maraschino cherries are toxic.  They bleach them before they soak them in red dye.  They cost a bit more but it so worth it.

Easy to make, but had trouble getting them out of the pan. It said wait five minutes then dump them out. They came out, but the sugar didn't. I'm going to try again. I'm going to dump them as soon as they come out of the oven.

My mom always makes these for me but this time I decided to try to make them myself. I used lemon cake mix instead of pineapple, used 3/4 cup pineapple juice and 1/4 cup cherry juice instead of water. I followed the recipe from there on except one extra thing. I melted a bit more butter into the brown sugar and coated the muffin pan with the brown sugar mixture instead of greasing the pan with non stick spray so the entire cupcake had a slight brown sugar glaze to it. They came out great.

These are adorable and delicious. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I did have some extra batter, which I used to make about 10 mini cupcakes without pineapple for kids who like "plain" food.

Presentation is five stars. 
Ease of preparation is five stars. Spray the pans well. I ran out of pineapple, so I don't recommend a heaping spoonful. 
Taste three stars , Too sweet for this sugaraholic.  I'm not sure I liked the pineaple cake mix.   I will try it again with yellow cake mix and perhaps a mixture of water and pineapple juice, or just water and no juice.

I really don't want to rate as of yet because I think I did something wrong. The brown sugar clumped at the bottom making the cupcakes look like they got burnt. Wish I could post a picture, they turned out NOTHING like the picture, not even close.

Quick, easy and bite size - always great.  Everyone who has tried them loves them.  Made them with and without cherries.  Still good.

This turned out really well!  I made only minor changes similar to what others suggested.  I couldn't find pineapple cake mix (and I thought that would be too sweet, anyway), so I used a "butter" cake mix--this came out so light and fluffy, not like a box mix at all!  I made my cakes in large muffin cups, but because I only had 1 6-muffin pan, I also had to use a small loaf pan (baked about 25 and 35 minutes, respectively).  I added a bit of coconut to the topping and pretty much did everything else the same, although I cooled the cakes more like 10-15 minutes, and they slid out of the pans easily.  Very good and will definitely make again!

I loved making them however way to much for a family of 3, shared with neighbors.  also when making cake mix use the pineapple juice instead of water.  Would make them again.

I made these for hubbys work and they were a hit! I also substituted the juice from the pineapple for the water in the recipe and they came out great!  These would also be great for an Easter gathering I think. Nice size dessert! I will definitely be making these again.

Great recipe!! Made 24 of these and they turned out great. I substituted cherries for raspberries and left them in the cupcake tins for easier clean up and to make them easier to eat. Only thing I would change is the confectioners sugar, just personal preference though.

The recipe was simple, and the results were pretty and delicious. I was skeptical about filling  them to the top, because of my recently cleaned oven, but I did as the recipe instructed, and I had no messy overflows. I also wondered if the author meant to specify cupcake vs muffin tins, since I had some leftover batter, but  the cupcakes did turn out just fine, despite the leftover batter. Great recipe! My boyfriend even ate two, and he doesn't eat sweets. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I used Scottley's Basic Yellow Cake recipe from this same site as opposed to the "pineapple cake mix" in the recipe. l also reduced the amount of brown sugar from 3 tablespoons to 2 teaspoons. The cupcakes came out wonderful. They were very moist, tender, and fruity.

These were excellent.  I added pecans to the cake batter, just to give them a little bite, but I will make them without next time because one of my children doesn't like them!  I will also substitute the pineapple juice with water next time per the instructions on the box.  They were a tad too sweet for my taste.   Also, I will use either pineapple rings or pineapple tidbits instead of crushed pineapple.  There was a lot of liquid from the crushed pineapple, which caused the bottom not to stick too well to the cake. Otherwise, definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Taste good. Made as directed. My pans had a malfunction so I lost a lot of the butter and brown sugar so that most likely would have made them taste even better. I used Wilton spring pans and most of my butter and brown sugar leaked out on the cookie sheet. I was making mini cakes.  :(

Wow!  Delicious muffins.  I actually made mini-muffins using 1/4 of a cherry and less brown sugar.  I even cut up some fresh pineapple for some of the muffins.  Worked great.  They were fun to make and they looked as if they came from a bake shop!  Will be using this recipe for years to come.  One suggestion:  Be sure the pans are sprayed with cooking oil to allow the muffins to fall out.

Got on here to see how other people made theirs. Early on when I started making these it would rise unevenly so halfway through I place a light baking sheet over the muffin pan to even out the bottoms. Really enjoy these!

I made these last Friday for my churches JR Youth Group.  The kids loved them.  I found them a little bit sweet so next time I would cut back on the brown sugar a little.  I think I would add a very scant 1/2 tsp to the muffin cups and 3/4 tsp of butter rather than mix them together.  I made them exactly how the recipe said.  I also gave the kids cans of whipped topping to put on top.  They loved them

I followed the directions and it turned out great.  I served it at a recent family event and it wasn't a great hit.  I've found over the years that you either like it or you dont??. Fortunately I love it and I had plenty left over.  I froze the remaining pieces and will have them all for "me" at a later date.  Thanks for the recipe.

Such a quick, easy recipe!  I used yellow cake mix and I mixed in the pineapple juice from the canned pineapple with the cake mix; added great flavor. Was a big hit! Would totally make this one again.

These were pretty good for being a quick version of pineapple upside down cake.  I wish the bottom was a little more crunchy like the version I usually make.

These were good cupcakes and went over well at Easter but I did have to make some adjustments.  I could not get 24 heaping tablespoons out of a 20 Oz can of can of crushed pineapple.  I think it should be teaspoons.  I  also thought there was way too much brown sugar and would reduce it to 24 teaspoons next time. Also, some newer  cupcake pans hold more batter than some of the older and I had better luck with the bigger ones ( I tried both).  Next time I would not bother melting the butter first, but rather just place a small pat in each cup.  Overall, these were very tasty, moist cupcakes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe,  Bri!

These are really good. They were gone in minutes. Make sure you spray the pan well and pack down the pineapple as directed.

I got rave reviews when I brought these to work.  While I was impressed with how cute they looked, my co-workers were impressed with how delicious they were.  I used more butter than the recipe called for (a little under a tablespoon), but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe exactly.  I used pineapple tidbits this time, but will try the crushed pineapple next time.

I used Pillsbury moist supreme cake mix vs the Duncan Hines and also used the pineapple juice in the mix instead of water and butter instead of oil. These came out so delish and moist, was not disappointed in any way! Tried posting a photo apparently it won't allow me saying image is to small but they look exactly like the pic in recipe

Fab-u-lous!!!!!!  These were easy (if a little time consuming) to make. They will be a hit at work tomorrow. Only thing I did differently was use honey butter, and that's just because I had some in the fridge.

Huge hit, everyone loved them and thought that Grammy (who is the pineapple upside down cake queen) made them! I did substitute yellow cake mix for pineapple cake mix.

I followed the directions.  However, I used oversized muffin tins, so the size was perfect.  I used the tidbits on some and liked the convenience of the rings better than the tidbits.  The rings fit perfectly in my muffin tins.

This is good basic recipe.  I made them with the pineapple tid bits and they were good for a cake mix recipe.

Moist and delicious! I made these in a jumbo muffin pan (6 cakes) and also got mini-loaf pans (3). I used the juice from a drained 8-oz can of crushed pineapple and added a small can of pineapple juice and enough water to equal 1 1/3 cups. I did cut back on a few things. I used less butter (~1/4 cup), swirling around pan around to coat. Also, only sprinkled in a couple scant tsps of brown sugar over the butter, then added a few pieces of the chopped maraschino cherry and a few tsp of the crushed pineapple. The loaf pans slipped right out with fruit mixture intact (probably because more cake was covering them). A little difficulty getting out from muffin pans but just scraped out what was left in pan and reapplied to cake. Giving some to my sister to take back to her family when she visits. Nice to give individual cakes...thanks Bri!

Loved this recipe. Made it for my 9 y/0 niece and my 5 y/o daughter. They both love helping in the kitchen and this recipe was fun for them to help make. The cupcakes came out super moist.

Very good.  I've been using this recipe for several years. Got the original recipe from the Betty Crocker site.  The only thing I do different is I use Splenda.

Love this recipe for class parties!! Everyone loves them and NEVER wants to stop at just one! I like using pineapple chunks to give a flower look to the tops when doing parties.

Very good!  I made these for Christmas.  I usually do a 13 x 9 pineapple upside down cake, but I thought these would be good for people to grab and put on a plate with other desserts.  They were a hit.  I will definitely make again.  They were like cupcakes, so no cutting or forks needed.  Most people just added them to the plate and ate with fingers like a cupcake.

Instead of using a pre-made cake mix I made a homemade yellow cake and substituted half the milk for pineapple juice also I added coconut to the pan.The cupcakes turned out so yummy and baked really fast in the oven.
