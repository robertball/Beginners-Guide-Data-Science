I tried to make this for my family but every single one of them absolutely hated it.  My husband was nice enough to point out that it basically called for me to put cocktail sauce on chicken.  If you have any love for your taste buds please show them some respect and steer CLEAR of this recipe....that is unless you like your family making fun of you for a full night :(

This is quite easy and results in a "different" flavor as advertised. I wouldn't really call it barbecue because of the lack of spices but definitely a nice tangy sauce.

Definitely not what you would expect for barbeque. I changed the recipe by dropping the lemon juice and horseradish completely. Instead I added (for a more bbq flavor) 2 ts brown sugar 1 ts worcestershire sauce 1 ts cayenne 2 ts paprika and 1/4 cup water yum!

This was pretty good but a little bland. Next time I will double the horseradish and add garlic and onion.
