This was tasty.  It was very flavorful and my family enjoyed it.  Next time I would probably use a little less butter and a little more sauce.

Sooo good! I didn't even add the spagetti sauce (oops forgot it at the store). The whole family liked it.

I found this very tasty, and so did the crowd.  I should have cooked it a little less, the recipe gave no time recommendation, so watch it closely so the zucchini does not get over done.  25 minutes at medium heat might be good, stirring frequently if you don't have it in a large pot.

I love this as a vegetable dish, especially in the summer. My family raves every time. I don't use the spaghetti sauce though. It doesn't need it at all.

This was surprisingly good! My husband and I loved it, but my 8 year old didn't, even though it has cheese. Apparently he's decided he doesn't like tomatoes (even though he eats spaghetti ... go figure!)

Even tho it lacks visual appeal, it is very tasty!  I also chose to add in some squash!  I thought that mozzarella cheese would be better so I swapped out the cheddar cheese.
