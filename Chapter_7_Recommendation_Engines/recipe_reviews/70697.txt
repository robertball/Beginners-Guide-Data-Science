This recipe is so easy to make, great for a beginner.  Although at the time of my making it, the recipe did not state when to add the water.  I just disolved the pectin in it before adding it to the grape juice.  I also did the plate in the freezer trick to ensure it was ready.  Place a plate in the freezer during cooking, when sugar is disolved take the plate out and drop a half teaspoon of the jelly onto the plate.  Wait one minute and push it with your fingernail.  If it wrinkles, it's ready to jar!  Great recipe!

Great with grape juice; but when using fresh grapes the large purple ones are perfect; must be boiled and strained and then the sugar and surejel adjusted to quantity of juice yielded; then this recipe works great for fresh also! Thumbs up.

I've been using this recipe since I took Home Ec in high school (sometime during the last century!)and it's a winner.  I even turned my grandmother on to it.

This is the recipe off the sure jell package. The only difference is when the mixture comes to a rolling boil, immediately add the sugar and then bring back to rolling boil, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Then take of heat and ladel. Also for those questioning when to add the water, you don't add any water. Just add the powdered pectin to the grape juice.

Your kids will love you for this and spoil them for store bought jelly! I used liquid pectin and Trader Joe's organic grape juice with Concord grapes. Recipe on the Certo website. I think that if you are a beginner canner, this site is your best bet to do exactly what you do to be safe and make a great product. I have read that liquid pectin produces a fresher fruit taste. In any case, homemade grape jelly is the best!!!

This was a great recipe.  I started out blending several recipes, but the one I was following was calling for 5 cups of juice/7 C sugar.  I only ended up with 3 c. of juice - so I switched to this receipe and ended up with 8 - 8oz jars.  After we added the sugar, we boiled again - for about 10 min - the jelly was not thickening, however i am accustomed to working with liquid Certo.  The jelly is perfect.  Will make again, boil 10 min - then processed in hot water bath for 10 min - let set in canner for 5 after boiling.

This was the first Jelly that I have ever canned. It turned out wonderful. Beautiful color and great taste. Won first place at our County Fair entering it again this year. I did the long process for canning so it would last longer. After one year it has held its color and taste.

I made 5 batches of this jelly using our homegrown grapes fresh off the vine.  I just boil the grapes down and strained them to get a deliciouos grape juice.  The recipe was quick and easy to make.

I am so happy to have found this recipe. A friend gave me a jar of it years ago as a Christmas gift and I loved it! Easy to make, I added the water with the pectin and dissolved it before adding the grape juice. Turned out great, guess what everyone is getting for christmas this year!

This recipe looks very easy.  I am a pretty good cook however, I am new to canning so I like the idea of minimal product and time while learning the ins and outs! 
Should I use no sugar added juice or is regular concorde grape acceptable?

I made this because my 5 year old loves grape jelly. It didn't take nearly a week for mine to set... I made it yesterday and today it's set. I don't really care for grape jelly so I had my husband taste it and he said it tasted just like grape jelly. So it's husband approved now just need to get it kid approved. Thanks!!

My 5 year old daughter and I made three batches of this jelly last summer. One to try it out, and two more the next day because it was THAT good! It couldn't be simpler, and set up like a gem. The whole lot cost me a whopping $4.08 (I already had plenty of jars, lids, and rings), so it was just sugar and pectin for the second batch. I got 18 half-pint jars of jelly total, and we're down to our last 6... I can't recall ever having to buy so much peanut butter! Try this, you'll never go for store-bought jelly again!

This was my first time making Jelly and I had a big gallon jug full of grape juice that a friend made and gave me, I followed the recipe exactly and the jelly turned out wonderful.  I got 8 half pints out of the batch, my 2 year old son was licking the pot clean when I was done. Thank you!

I liked this very much, but i had a few issues with it. First, someone said this was a good recipe for beginners; yes and no.

I followed the recipe to the letter. After about 30 hours of cooling, I opened one up and it tasted a bit gritty... yes, I should have let the mixture boil longer. So, I opened the other two pints, placed them into a large pan and brought it back up to boiling. I then added another tablespoon of pectin while it was just starting to boil. After letting it bubble for five more minutes, I took the jelly off the burner and returned the mixture to sterilized jars. Remember to use new lids.

The redo came out much better. In the future, I'll slightly dilute the grape concentrate the next time (two containers of water rather than three), as the current jelly tastes more like sugary grape than grape jelly. This is an easy fix, however.

Great, easy recipe.  I started with fresh grapes with enough water to cover, boiled, pressed, and strained them for the juice.  My pectin box (Sure jell) was just 1.75 ounces, but it seemed to have worked just fine.

I will give this four stars only because my apple jelly came out great; the grape didn't do as well. I also took off 1 1/2 cups of sugar & added 1/2 cup of honey. It jelled nicely. Hope it taste as good as it looks, the apple that is! The grape just looks blaa, too chunky looking on the tops of the jars and don't know why! I even reprocessed them in new jars & didn't look any better. Oh well, I give most things three tries then its out! I'm still looking for a good recipe for a three berry jam? Any ideas?

Absolutely the best recipe! Tastes wonderful with egg rolls! I used grape juice from my own vines and the only thing I would add is to make sure you strain or skim the pectin scum off the top of the jelly - I used wax on my jelly jars...

Very basic, easy recipe that works even for beginners.  My new favorite grape jelly recipe, however, is  the one included in the pink "Low or No Sugar Sure Jell" box.  It uses 5 1/2 C grape juice and only 3 1/2 C sugar.  It tastes every bit as good, spreads easily, and has WAY less sugar!

I had to adjust the pectin and make several batches. I could not find a 2 ounce package of powdered pectin anywhere. The taste is awesome, but adjusting the pectin was tough.

Perfect! Made mine with liquid pectin though. Mixed juice and sugar in a pot - (rolling) boiled for 5min - stirred in pectin let it come to a (rolling) boil again for one min. Processed for 10min. Came out perfect! Quick and easy.

I made this today and got 6 (8 ounce) jars and all were filled up but one. That one is the house jar all the rest are being given out as gifts. I only added 5 cups of sugar and it was plenty sweet. My bf compared it to Welches Grape jelly and said it was delicious. Very easy to make as well. Will be making again soon!!!

I always water bath for at least 10 minutes.  Be aware that you may find what appears to be shard of glass -- these are sugar crystals and perfectly safe.  It is caused by the supersaturation of sugar.  Be sure to skim the foam that may appear in the  jelly as it is cooking, otherwise you will have a cloudy jelly.

My husband gathered Concord grapes on Cape Cod last week. I had four cups of crushed grape juice and meat but no skin or seeds. I used the recipe adjusted to 70 servings and made it exactly as written. It made 88 ounces of jam and it was outstanding. OMG. Now,I'll never have to make jam again. Did you know that during WWI, British soldiers survived on 8-10 ounces of jam daily as supplies of food were scarce? Yeah, I didn't either.

The color and taste is awesome! But I’m not sure where I went wrong because it was not jellied like it should be, it’s a real thick syrup. But that’s ok I’m still gonna eat it! Taste great on peanut butter sandwiches and toast! I have 3 jars so it will be awhile before I make it again. But I was wondering can I freeze it? And how long will it last in the fridge?

Fresh picked grape. Boiled them with a little water first them squeezed out the juice. I uses liquid Certo. Only had 1/2 the amount of juice so 1/2ed the recipe. Turned out good.

This is sweet, but yummy!  Had a little that didn't make it into my jars, and scooped it up with bread!  I didn't have canning equipment, but went with the advice of "Penniless Parenting."  You can Google 'water bath canning with no equipment,' if you want to learn more.  Came out fine, vacuum sealed, etc.

This was a very easy recipe and excellent in a pinch. However, I am going to cut back on the sugar next time I make it, probably by a cup. I find it a little too sweet.

I used the same recipe except I used low sugar pectin, one cup of sugar, and used the Ball Jam and jelly maker!  It was ready in less than 30 minutes!  I also used 1 tablespoon of butter so it wouldn't foam.

LOVED IT!
