This is an awesome recipe.  Thanks!  I added 1 cup of sliced, fresh mushrooms & some white wine to the zucchini saute & used more cream cheese to make a thicker sauce.  Also added a little chopped fresh parsley to the fresh basil. Yummy over noodles or pasta!

This was really good! I did a few things different. I took 3 costco frozen chicken breasts and boiled them in a bit of water. Then I used the water the chicken boiled in and used that in place of chicken broth the recipie called for and also added 1/2 boullion cube. I did add the broth when I added the zuchinni since I had cubed them in large pieces and needed them to have some liquid to become tender. I ommited the red pepper and added a bit extra cream cheese to make the sauce thicker. Very good and will make again with all the zucchini growing in the garder!

This was really good, and the family loved it - even the kids!  I doubled the zucchini and chicken mixture (except for the stock) and used 3oz cream cheese.  Worked well for 8oz of pasta.  The cream cheese came through subtly w/o overpowering the dish.

This one is WONDERFUL!  Not alot of fat and calories and my picky eater of a husband loved it! Only chages I made were to  double the recipe and then add 2 cans of diced tomatoes in garlic and basil seasonings (because I love tomatoes). I also put all of it in a casserole dish and topped with motzerella and baked it for 20 min at 350 degrees to better set in the flavors!

This was a great dish for entertaining a large group of friends.  The chicken makes it heartier and more substantial, but I left it out for some vegitarian friends and it was still delicious.  Even without cream cheese (for a lactose intolerant friend)this dish wowed them all.  The only alterations I made were replacing half of the broth with vermouth (a white wine will work well too) and adding mushrooms just before the broth/wine.  This recipe doubles/triples well and is very forgiving to mismeasures (I've lost all of my measuring spoons in a recent move). I served with some bruschetta and a white wine/citrus spritzer.  My guests are still raving about this pasta.

Ya, really good. I used a zucchini and a yellow squash. Loved the flavor. I also did add more cream cheese, to make the sauce a bit thicker and it was good. I wouldn't recommend using penne pasta because it's hard to eat with all the chicken and veggies, to get it on your fork was impossible it seemed. So maybe bowtie, or rigatoni or something. Penne is just kind of a stiff pasta. But super tasty and I'll definitely be making again and again. Excellent summer dish.

Great blend of flavors, especially with the red pepper! Added summer squash. Didn't have any cream cheese on hand, and it turned out fine without it. However, we liked it enough to try it again with the cream cheese. Definitely sprinkle parmesan on top - it completes the meal!

Wow...  I guess it's just me, but nothing about this recipe impressed me.  It also looked NOTHING like the picture, so maybe I did something wrong, but it was no good.  I followed the instructions to a T and have had very few problems with recipes on this site...  I love garlic, onion, and zucchini, so I was ready for a scrumptious dinner, but this was not.

Excellent! I used 98% fat free/low sodium chicken broth and whole wheat pasta shells. My husband really liked this. I love that this recipe uses things I almost always have on hand. I'll make again. Thanks! :)

I have tried a similar recipe, however, without chicken.  This is a wonderful dish with some toasted chopped walnuts added, and instead of chopped zucchini, thinly julienne style (thin strips), so that the zucchini doesn't get watery.  I use linguini noodles.  I am hungry just thinking about it.  Might have to make some tonight!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I use Zucchini and, using a Mandolin, cut in Fettuccini type strips.  Grill the strips to lower moisture content.  I use them as the pasta in any normal paste dish.  In flat strips they make Lasagna, lower Carbs than traditional pasta.

One of our staple dinners! Very light and healthy! I use Quinoa Pasta and Light Cream Cheese. I also add white wine and use fresh red pepper instead of canned.
Excellent!!! Thank you NJMOM

I used this a just an idea to make dinner based on what I had in the house.  I usually follow recipes to the T the first time I make them but I needed to use up some stuff in the fridge and pantry.  Instead of pasta I used Isreali couscous,  also used a mix of italian herbs, I mix of frozen veggies (that included zucchini), no chicken, and fresh red bell peppers that I sauteed with the onions and garlic.  My family loved it and it was a great way to use up stuff in the house!

Excellent recipe!  Usually I follow exactly as is, but I read the reviews and decided to go with their suggestions.  I added about 1 cup of sliced mushrooms to the onion & garlic, then added a splash of white wine with the zucchini. Also used 1/2 c chicken broth & 1/4 c white wine rather than 3/4 cup chicken broth. I didn't have roasted red peppers so I used halved grape tomatoes.  Also took other's suggestions & added a little more cream cheese.  Delicous!!  Next time I'll try a combination of peppers & tomatoes. Absolutely wonderful & great leftover.  Enjoy!!

This is my husbands most requested recipes.  I add one yellow squash in addition to the zucchini and increased the garlic to four gloves. It is the best way to use items from my garden.

This was really good. I roasted a  red bell pepper, and didn't use the red pepper flakes.  I especially liked the combination of the broth, cream cheese, and parmesan.

AMAZING! But i did substitute about half a can of diced tomatoes in, instead of the diced roasted red peppers. And i added a little more cream cheese. It was wondeful and i would make it again.

This was a realy simple and tasty recipe! Ever so slightly spicey, but still mild. I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey instead of chicken (simply to use it up) and doubled the amount. I also threw in another tablespoon of cream cheese, and I totally forgot about the basil. Not a huge deal, as I only had dry basil anyway. I used whole wheat bowtie pasta, but shells would've been fun. Anyway, the only thing I want to say is that the recipe calls for 'one zucchini'. Unfortunately Zucchini comes in all shapes and sizes; from six inches to the size of a baseball bat. I put in one cup of chopped zucchini, but I think it needs two cups at least. And the same goes for the onion; the recipe calls for half an onion, and those aso vary greatly in size. I used a quarter cup, and that seemed perfect. Will DEFINATELY make this again, but I will add more zucchini than I did the first time.

Flavorful light sauce over pasta with veg. and chicken. The only change I made was increasing the amount of chicken. Next time I'll try adding more zucchini and peppers -- or decrease the amount of pasta to maybe 6 oz.

Grilled a chicken breast, swapped diced tomatoes for red peppers, and left out the cream cheese.  I would definitely make it as written if I had the ingredients, but it was great with with the substitutes.

I'm rating four stars because I made a lot of changes to this depending on what I had, but it came out soooo good! I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts sauteed in olive oil with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Then sauteed the onion, garlic, and zucchini with salt, pepper, dried oregano and basil dried red pepper flakes,and garlic powder. Added some diced tomatoes with juice and chicken broth, some flour to thicken it and let it simmer. Served over pasta shells! Delish!! My husband said it was restaurant quality.

I cooked costco chicken like mentioned above and also nearly doubled the cream cheese to get the sauce to thicken.  My boyfriend really like it and it was so easy.  I used minced garlic from costco too snd also added 1/2 a red bell pepper in place of the roasted red. ALso, this makes great left overs.

This tasted okay but I was not very happy with the appearance. It looked a little wilted. Maybe I cooked the zucchini too long, not sure. It was good to use up the zucchini I had but I doubt I will be making it again.

This was so,so,so good. I used fettucine, and added a lot more chicken since we are meat people. I also thickened the sauce with more cream cheese, and some cornstartch. I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I can't comment on how hot the actual recipe is, but without that it was dang good.

Wonderful!  And made even better and healthier by using half as much pasta and twice as much zucchini.  This is a company dish for sure.

Added 1/4 cup white Zinfandel and some sun dried tomatoes. I also added 1 cup Parmesan cheese directly into the sauce to thicken it up. DELICIOUS!

I loved this recipe!  Yummy!  I didn't add the crushed red pepper because my husband isn't a fan.  It was a little soupy when I finished so I poured it into a prepared casserole dish, topped it with the Parmesan cheese and baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes and it was perfect.  Will make this again and again.

I really enjoyed this. I had to omit the roasted red peppers, so I substituted a can of undrained diced tomatoes, and added maybe 1/4 cup of tomato sauce. Since I had enough liquid from the tomatoes I opted not to add the chicken broth. I also sauteed sliced mushrooms with the zucchini and onions. It was even better the next day for lunch.

This has become a summer standby in my house!  I use regular red pepper instead of roasted and I always add fresh mushrooms.  It's a great recipe for adding veggies to, and it always turns out delicious!

This is a great recipe and easy to make!  I used frozen chicken fajita strips and penne pasta since I had it on hand, and it was yummy!  Next time I will decrease the red pepper flakes to 1/8 tsp.  It was a little too spicy for my family.  I am also going to try it with shrimp instead of chicken, since my husband is not a big chicken fan.  I can't wait to make this again!

Love it!  A great way to use up your garden zucchini in a light pasta.  I loved that this tasted like an alfredo without all the butter and cream!  I've made it several times and it is a winner.  I left out the roasted red peppers cause we don't love peppers and it was delicious.

I was trying to use up some zucchini before I left for vacation and also some bacon.  I crumbled up a bunch of bacon pieces into this pasta and wow!  Bacon, bacon, bacon with this dish is excellent!  I will be making this again.  It's a perfect pasta dish and really many things can be added into it.  I am excited to try mushrooms.  It is a must to double the zucchini.

What a great easy dinner we had tonight! This was way tastier then I expected it to be.  My roasted red peppers were moldy when I went to use them (UGH!) so I used sun dried tomatoes instead but otherwise made this exactly as directed and it was really really good. A keeper for us so thanks for posting this nice low-fat easy weeknight meal.

Fantastic dish. I just made it for the second time and love it. The first time I made it, I didn't use roasted peppers, but this time I cut up a red bell and roasted it prior to cooking this dish. It was great tasting and I'm glad I kept that in the recipe this time! I did use about 1/2 cup of light cream cheese, which made a very creamy delicious sauce.

Made for church potluck meal and everyone loved it. I did follow suggestion to double cream cheese, and added lots more dried spices when cooking the vegetables first, since the dish needs it after you add plain chicken and pasta. Chopped fresh basil and shredded parm on top are delicious, thanks for sharing.

I doubled this for our large family and it is a keeper! Everyone liked it. I grilled organic chicken thighs with salt, pepper and oregano. Our garden is going crazy right now, so I added some swiss chard and tomatoes. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good and simple.  Only change that I made was doubling the recipe to serve family of four (except for pasta).  I cooked my chicken as whole breasts sauteed in olive oil, seasoned w/ salt, pepper, & garlic powder and chopped after cooked.  Would like to try other people's suggestions of using white wine and adding seeded tomatoes.

This was really good.  I added more broth to make more sauce then added a bit of corn starch to thicken it up a bit.  But other than that, I followed the recipe.  My veggie hating family loved it!  I sliced the zucchini in rounds instead of dicing, which made my kids ask if they were eating pickles.  lol  But they ate it and actually said they liked it!!  Good job on the recipe!!

This was good and easy.  I used leftover roast chicken and thickened the sauce a little with cornstarch.

This was super delicious. Loved the cream cheese sauce and added mushrooms. I made a larger quantity.

pretty good- I added extra cream cheese and Parmesan... I wish I had left out the red pepper flakes (too spicy for me)... otherwise it was good, but pretty similar to a lot of other recipes I've tried here...

I fixed this a few nights ago and it was a hit. Next time I will double the recipe.  I also added more cream cheese and chicken broth to suit my taste and consistency of sauce.

Success!  The first words out of my husband's mouth were:  "How many calories are in this?" then he said:  "My wife can cook!" This recipe was absolutely delicious and the reviews that stated it is tastless are inaccurate.  I more than doubled the recipe and used leftover BBQ chicken.  I took the advise of others and added two cups chicken broth and some white wine.  I added three fresh tomatoes from the garden and used a whole package of lite cream cheese.  The sauce was too thin, so I thickened it with corn starch.  Also as suggested by others, I topped it with mozarella cheese and instead of baking in the oven, I warmed it in the microwave until the cheese was melted.  Don't omit the red pepper flakes, for that's the secret ingredient :)

Awesome. I did switch up a couple of things.  I used whole wheat penne and when I made up my broth ( I use chicken base) I used the pasta water, that made it a little thicker.  Next time I would add mushrooms, but other than that , this was really delish.. Made it for lunch and having it again for dinner, Thanks for the recipe

Made this last night & it turned out well.  Not "super awesome" but we enjoyed it & will prob make again.  Made it exactly as directed except left out the onion and the red peppers as my boyfriend doesn't like these items.  And I added cut up squash.  And more chicken.  The pepper flakes definitely gave it a nice kick.  Eating it for lunch today so hopefully it warms up well.

I got everything from my garden. but substituted the zucchini for yellow summer squash (I suspect any squash will do).  

I also took garden grown cherry tomatoes, halved them, then sauteed them under medium-high heat in a little olive oil with the cut side down until they caramelized.  Then added them into the mixture.  Pretty amazing!!!  Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME! I only did one thing different (just because I didn't have it) and left out the red peppers. If I have them next time, I'll add those as well. I made this recipe for Valentine's Day and it was just perfect. Thanks so much for sharing.

MmmMmm delicious! So simple and delicious. I just used some fresh red pepper I had and it was yummy. I did use more cream cheese as others had suggested. I didn't have parmesan so I omitted it, however I think it would have made this dish even more tasty. Fresh basil is an excellent addition too. Thanks for the recipe.

I would have guessed by the taste that this had a lot of fat, but the small amount of light cream cheese and parmesan gave this great cheesy flavor without a ton of calories.  I mixed the sauce in with whole wheat rotini and left out the chicken, because I served this as a side dish to cajun chicken. I will definitely be making this a couple times a month.  Thank YOU!

This was so yummy!  I didn't have any roasted red peppers, so I left them out.  I also left out the red pepper flakes since my kids don't like things too spicy and hot.  Everyone loved it and my husband (who is kind of picky) said "definitely make this again!"

This was really yummy and very quick dinner.  The only cream cheese i had on hand was the garden veggie type, I swear this made it better because it has a peppery taste.  Also, instead of chicken I added vegetarian sausage.  Very good!

I liked the blend of pasta, chicken, zucchini and roasted red peppers, but I was unpleasantly surprised with the souce. It came out way too soupy. I even tried adding a tablespoon of flour to thicken it, but it didn't help. Next time I'll just use some sort of creamy white sauce from a jar.

I used butter instead of cream cheese, and added a defrosted box of artichoke hearts. Also added a splash of dry sherry. Before adding the chicken broth, I sprinkled the mix with Wondra flour (probably about 3 T.), to help it thicken. I used whole wheat penne pasta. My husband loved it.

Mmmmm...More like 4-1/2 stars.
Different and very tasty. As always, to a pasta dish, I added a little white wine and about 1/2 tsp of sugar. It was a little runny, so I put a bit of corn starch to tighten up the sauce a little. I also added fresh spinach. Very good. Will make again and again. Thanks!

Very weak sauce unless you are willing to at least double the cream cheese, like most reviewers have done.  At this point, however, it stops becoming a lower-calorie main dish.

Also, cooking times for veggies and zucchini seemed a bit long.  There was no crunch left to anything at the end.

Delicious!  I added yellow squash and mushrooms to this recipe and deleted the roasted red peppers and it came out wonderfully! My husband and I loved the spicy flavor added by the red pepper flakes.  Yummy! Will soon be making this again.

I followed exaclty except making a few changes to measurement:
I used 2 zucchini (one green one yellow)
    * 3/4 can instead of 3/4 cup chicken broth, added a little at a time to keep it moist and creamy
    omitted roasted red peppers (only b/c i did not have)
   I used 3 tablespoons whipped cream cheese
and I added 1/2 cup milk with 1 Tbs of flour mixed into it into it.  

This was definately a keeper.  

I used someone else's suggestion and cooked my chicken breasts in ICBINB spray along with a tsp of it seasoning. Not bad, but next time I will try marinating in a lemon-based marinade and grilling before adding it to the mix.

My family really liked this and it was easy to prepare.  I did add more red peppers (2 that I roasted myself, cut in strips), a lot more chicken (1/2 of a store bought already roasted - skin removed) and a whole can of low sodium chicken broth.  I originally skipped the parmesan but found it necessary for the final touch.  I wasn't a fan of the shells and will try a penne or bow-tie next time.

Thanks for an easy, healthy one dish dinner (served with a sesame loaf bread.)  Yummy!

I thought this recipe was pretty good but it seemed to lack in flavor... Maybe next time I'll try using white cooking wine instead of chicken broth?  The spiciness carried the meal.  I'll definitely try it again with some modifications.

I tried this for my annual american idol night dinner with friends!  It was a great recipe everyone really seemed to enjoy it.  I also added extra cream cheese to make the sauce thicker.  You might also consider using low sodium chicken broth and whole wheat pasta.  It made the dish even healthier and it still tasted great!  Thanks for posting!

Well, WOW! I loved it! Family did too. The only neg is that its not a thick sauce, but who cares. It was really good. If you just threw this together you should be a chef. This is a 5 star meal for me. I used angel hair and it was fabulous. I also liked the use of cream cheese instead of heavy cream, so tasty and less fat with all the flavor! NOTE: The only thing that I wondered about was the one ounce of roasted pepper. I used on pepper I roasted myself and that was perfect. No need to buy a pricey jar of roasted red peppers. Anyway......loved it! A keeper all the way. Thanks again for the recipe!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe was delicious!!!  My husband and I loved it!  I did not give it to my kids, the red pepper flakes gave it a great kick, but if I were going to give it to them I would probably leave them out.  I will definitley be keeping this one!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great! I made zoodles (spiral-cut zucchini "noodles") instead of chopped zucchini, but otherwise followed the recipe more or less to the letter. It was good, and very filling. I'll be adding it to the family meal rotation.

Absolutely loved this. I used sundried tomatoes because I had them and I like them better than roasted red peppers. I also used a little more chicken than called for. I used a little more cream cheese and chicken broth since I was using more chicken. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  I used prawns instead of chicken - Costco has cooked, frozen prawns for a quick add.  I also added more cream cheese to thicken the sauce and along with sliced fresh mushrooms and a can of chopped tomatoes.  It's a keeper!

This was DELICIOUS! Made it and was pleasantly surprised. Flavors were delicious, the zucchini absorbed the flavor and helped to intensify it. Easy meal to make on the work days.

We really love this recipe, although it is VERY spicy, and there seems to be wayyy too much pasta for the sauce. With your own eye balling and cooking intuition you can modify and correct the simple mistakes with this recipe. I am very happy with the flavor it was very surprising. If you are on the fence cook it!

We added additional cream cheese to thicken up the sauce and omitted the peppers since we didn't have any. We added some extras like spinach right at the end. Loved it!

I changed this quite a bit from the original by adding Italian tomatoes, omitting red peppers & substituting the cream cheese for Alfredo. It turned out amazing though! The spices come together beautifully & it makes a really delicious, healthy meal. We actually ate dinner twice tonight because it was so good! I pan fried the chicken with some adobo, cumin & chili powder. Amazing recipe!

Super tasty! But I made quite a few changes. I left out the red peppers and added mushrooms, asparagus, and a can of diced tomatoes. Used about triple the amount of cream cheese and added about a 3/4 cup of dry white wine. I sauteed the garlic and onions first, added the veggies 'til tender and set them aside. I then simmered the broth with the wine for about a minute before adding the can of tomatoes (with the juice). Let that simmer for about 15 minutes to reduce some, then added the cream cheese until well incorporated. Threw the veggies back in, added the chicken with salt and pepper to taste, and finally added the pasta. Turned out great!

I changed this more than I normally do, but it was fantastic. I subbed sausage for the chicken because everyone was talking about slightly lacking flavor, and WOW. It brought some heat, spice, and simplicity to the mix (don't have to precook the meat).  I also doubled the cream cheese, added a little sour cream, and a slurry of broth plus mas to thicken it.  Instead of topping with parmesan and basil, I tossed it into the mix.
I strongly recommend making a ton more topping because I ended up with extra pasta.  Can't really overdo the veggies... I added a small squash but wish I'd used two giant zukes/squishes.  I used a pound of sausage, but that can be increased as well.
It was quite easy to make after a fair bit of chopping. Two thumbs up from me and the hubs!

Great recipe with a little kick. I used 16 ounces of rotini, and basically doubled the spices, chicken broth ( just threw in a 14.5 ounce can) , and cream cheese. I added 2 zucchinis and a couple of chicken breasts. I omitted the roasted red pepper, and used dried basil instead of fresh. I was looking for a way to use up a couple of zucchinis, and this worked like a charm.

I made this minus the cream cheese with gemelli pasta.  The only thing I'd change would be to lessen the red pepper flakes. My sons loved it, they just thought it was spicy.

The family liked this as a change up to the normal spaghetti pasta night.  I followed one other reviewers suggestion and used some vermouth.  Basically I doubled the sauce portion of the recipe and used a cup of broth and a half a cup of vermouth.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried in with the sauce at the same time as the oregano. Also I used green beans instead of zucchini just because that was what I was in the mood for veggie-wise.  I'm glad I doubled the sauce or I don't think there would have been enough sauce for four people's pasta. Next time I'll go heavier on the salt & pepper. Oh, and I omitted the red pepper because it is just too hot for us. Also, as one other reviewer said shredded Parmesan on top really did make it, so don't skip it!

Love this dish! After we tried the original recipe, we made it again with a couple of adjustments to suit our family's taste. Omitted the crushed red pepper, too spicy for us. One of my kids added ground red pepper to her own dish. Only used 2 garlic cloves and minced them, very flavorful. Last, we tried it with Barilla whole grain thin spaghetti. Delicious!

Average recipe. Sauce needed thickening added more cream cheese and would omit red pepper next time a bit too spicy for my liking

A great use for zucchini and leftover chicken.  I didn't have any cream cheese so skipped that and it was excellent and even healthier.

I made this tonight for family visiting from Colorado. I was disappointed with this dish. It was just OK. I won't be making it again.

I made this tonight.  I used fresh red peppers instead of the roasted and I used more chicken broth, so my sauce was slightly thin, but I thought it was very good.  One of my guys thought it was wonderful, while the other voted it good (but he's a little veggie-phobic, so the zucchini scared him, even though he admitted he couldn't taste it!)

Delicious recipe and very good as leftovers the next day at work. I couldn't find diced roasted red peppers so I bought a fresh red pepper and cut it up and cooked it with the onions, garlc, zucchini and seasonings.  Also fried two pieces of boneless skinless chicken breasts in olive oil separate for the cooked chicken.  I will definitely be making this often.

The concept was good, however it was not thick at all.  I had to add more cream cheese, add more parmesean cheese to the actual sauce, added montary jack cheese to the sauce and then added the shells into it in the frying pan, cook for 5 more minutes until it was finally edible.  What happened?  Then it did taste good, but was basically my own recipe, not this one.  I wouldn't recomend it except if you tweek it quite a bit.

This is certainly light, but not nearly enough sauce for us.  I thickened it a bit with 1 tbsp of flour but it just wasn't enough and it was also quite bland.  Doubled the zucchini and used bow tie pasta.

What a bummer. This recipe had such good reviews, but I think this is another one of those recipes that was given good reviews based on changes and not the actual recipe. I found the result to be runny and pretty bland. The only thing that saved my veggies and chicken was tons of seasoning and a quick alfredo sauce I whipped up. Once I mixed that in it helped a ton, but as far as the recipe is as written, I have to give it one star. I was really expecting to love this one but didn't. Sorry.

delicious flavor...only major change was omitting the red pepper flakes(7 year old is not a fan) but added them as a garnish to others plates.  Used tofutti and whole wheat pasta...good taste and good for you!

This is great! We eat this on a regular basis. The flavor is wonderful, the broth is a little fluid - I need to try and thicken it up a  bit. But no one ever thinks it is anything but spectacular.

YUM!  I did vary the recipe a bit, but it turned out really well!  I omitted the onions and chicken and added in mushrooms.  Also, I just used a regular (non roasted) red bell pepper and sauteed it with the zuc.  I boiled up 1/2 a box of fetuccini and mixed everything together - it recieved rave reviews from all of the picky eaters I was serving!!!  :)

I had some zucchini from the garden to use and some leftover grilled chicken breasts. Tried this recipe and it was GREAT! Amazingly I had everything on hand except for the roasted red peppers. The fresh chopped basil and parmesan really round out the flavors. I also like the grilled taste from the chicken breasts - great way to use leftovers. Will definitely make again!!

Very simple to make.  I thought it would lack flavor, but not to worry.  My 19mo loved it and so did Dad. I used 2-3 small chicken breast seasoned them with salt, garlic powder, and dried italian seasoning and sautéed until cooked through. Went with others advice and used a bit more cream cheese about 2 oz.  I also added fresh diced tomatoes.

Had to make a couple of modifications to make this a 5-star - is a decent recipe as written but seems to be lacking the following adjustments (to my taste of course) - started by dicing TWO chicken breasts and browning in EVOO (seasoned with a little garlic powder, italian seasoning and seasoning salt).  Resumed following the recipe,but added about twice as much zucchini and three times as much roasted red pepper.  Ended up using whole wheat rotini pasta and tossing the entire meal together before serving.  TURNED OUT GREAT - was delicious, packed with veggies, and still creamy good with the cream cheese.  (Before adding the cooked pasta could see that the sauce was a little on the runny side - adding the pasta & grated cheese helped this.)

This dish turned out very well. I didn't have cream cheese on hand, so I used half & half and corn starch instead. We like our dishes with a lot of sauce, so next time I'll add more chicken broth and be sure to try with cream cheese. I had a thick pasta on hand, but will also try with a smaller noodle. Thanks for the recipe!

This was okay as written, but I did have to add a can of diced tomatoes. After adding the cream cheese and broth, it still seemed a bit watery so I thickened it up a bit with some flour...it was absolutely delicious and worthy of *5 stars* after adding a scoop of Feta cheese and mixing it all in! YUM! Hubby said it was restaurant quality :)

So tasty - I used vegetable broth b/c I didn't have chicken broth - and it still turned out great. Just a hint of spice and so many delicious flavors. I'd def. make this again.

My husband doesn't even like zucchini and he loved this pasta.  I used 3/4C white wine instead of the chicken broth and it turned out wonderfully. Also doubled the cream cheese. I cooked the zucchini and onions together with garlic and butter w/spices listed for about 10 minutes. Great way to eat Zucchini!

My entire family loved this! I didn't add all the chicken stock or cream cheese because some of the other reviews said it was a little runny.  However, the sauce thickened and I ended up wishing I had more.  Great recipe!

This recipe was a great base idea for what I had in the fridge. I followed the recipe as stated except I added cheddar and moz. cheese (about a cup total) at the end instead of cream cheese (didn't have any).  It turned out delicious with a nice fresh flavor with just a little cheese.

Very good!  I added four large mushrooms and used 5 Tablespoons of cream cheese.  Also I put over brown rice.  Will make again.

This was such an easy and fun meal to make.I made it for my wife and I last week and we loved it.The only thing I might suggest is adding some heavy cream to thicken the sauce.The sauce was a little runny but still tasted fine.This is a meal to make when you wanna show off a bit!

YUM!!  I didn't have any red pepper, so I just omitted it. I also used 4 oz. of cream cheese to make the sauce thicker. I will definately make this one again!

WOW! This is yummy! My picky 5 year old ate every bite and asked for more! Made again for relatives and they all asked for the recipe! I added some extra red pepper flakes for a little added heat, and some sun dried tomatoes as well. DELICIOUS! Thank you for the recipe!

Was a tasty & easy week night dinner.Instead of the cooked chicken I added some chicken sausage sliced in 1 cm morsels and also halved the chicken broth and added white wine instead.Will definitely add it to my week night recipe list.

I have a vegetarian in the house so instead of chicken I added more roasted red pepper and some mushrooms and used vegetable broth.  I cooked veggies much less time than indicated in recipe so that the zucchini still had texture.  I used 3 oz of cream cheese and unfortunately had no fresh basil but it tasted good with dried.  I only shook a teeny bit of red pepper flakes in and my teenagers said it was “too spicy”  ???  ERRG! Too bad, we thought it was great, those ungrateful devils!

Very easy and tastey recipe. I only had 1/2 a zuchini so I used mushrooms as well. I thought the consistency of the sauce was great. If you follow the times in the recipe it does cook down a bit and thickens.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was really good!!  I didn't have any red pepper, so I used yellow squash (garden overflow!)  I added more chicken to make it a nice, light, summer meal.  Thanks!

I made this last night and it was great! I added more chicken. It was a little spicy. I usually do not measure anything and I may have added to much red pepper. My husband doesn't like left overs but he ask to take this for lunch today! This is definately something we will have again.

Great starter recipe...I just got done making this dish, and did what I normally do with a recipe- take the ingredients and method and make it my own..I cooked chicken tenders with some cayenne pepper (my family likes it hot!), black pepper, and garlic powder, and italian dressing seasoning (its all I had on hand). I had some left over grilled zucchini and yellow squash, and cut up some red bell pepper and crimini mushrooms. I ended up using almost half a block of light cream cheese. I didn't bother measuring the chicken broth, I just put in enough to cover the chicken...served over penne pasta....Great recipe! Good alternative to those heavy cream alfredos I am used to making...Thanks for sharing!

This was really good. I omitted the chicken broth and used white wine. I also added more chicken and more zuccini and served it over whole wheat spiral noodles.

I made this last night.  It was very good, however I ended up increasing the ingredients on all of this.  It needed more garlic and onions I think, but the family enjoyed it and I will make it again.

This is amazing!  I also added twice the amount of cream cheese, and just a tiny bit of cream to the sauce.  It is sooooo good!

This was a hit with my family!  I pan fried 4 chicken breasts in fat free butter spray and followed everything else to a "T" except for that I did not have any roasted red peppers so I took a can of diced tomatoes with Italian spices and put two heaping tablespoons into the mixture.  I made with spiral whole wheat noodles, garlic bread, and fresh peas for a perfect meal.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe!
My wife loved it, it was easy to prepare, tasty, and answered the question: "What are we going to do with all this zucchini?"

Thanks, NJ Mom (from an NJ DAD)

I love this recipe. I have made it twice since I found it a few months ago. A little spicy, which I like, but could be toned down my reducing the amount of red pepper flakes. Also great with bow tie pasta.

I loved this recipe.  Everyone in my family liked it - including my 13 year old, who actually ate the zucchini!  I did use a bit too much red pepper flakes.  The flavors really blended.  One zucchini recipe down........more to try!

I really liked this recipe I also threw in some asparagus, the cream cheese contributed to a nice creamy sauce.
