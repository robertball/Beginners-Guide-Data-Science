Per my preference, I used olive oil instead of canola oil.  I omitted the red peppers  and carrots, and added cherry tomatoes, sliced in half.  I also added a little bit of table salt.  I also used all black olives instead of green and black.  As another reviewer suggested, I marinated ALL the vegetables (minus the lettuce of course) together and then tossed right before we ate dinner.  I topped with homemade croutons.  It was delicious!  I served with lasagna, and many guests had second helpings of salad, rare!

I wanted a special salad to accompany the pasta dinner I made for my father-in-law's 90th birthday and I'm thrilled to have found this tasty recipe!  So many salads are forgettable, but this one stands out; everyone loved it.

For maximum dresing flavor, be sure to drain the artichoke hearts really well.  I placed each piece upside down on a paper towel and pressed down lightly to remove as much liquid as possible.  I also added some mozzarella fresca (fresh, marinated mozzarella balls) just before serving.  This one gets a rave review from my family!

Very tasty and hearty salad.  I chopped all of the vegetables in advance (adding tomatoes) and marinated them ALL in the dressing and tossed with lettuce right before serving.  I will be making this salad again!

This salad was a great "hit" with our neighbors and they have all asked me to make it again or give them the recipe.  I made a few changes as suggested by previous reviews.  I used olive oil instead of canola, added more veggies (and definitely more garlic), marinated the carrots and black olives with the artichokes, added gourmet mozzarella cut into bite size pieces and put more grated Romano cheese on top of the salad when serving.  I wasn't too sure about "chopping" the lettuce, so, I just tore it into bite size pieces. I am making it again today (one week later) and will add more artichokes. This is definitely a recipe I will keep, but with the changes.

Very Nice! For those wondering about tarragon vinegar, Heinz makes a very popular brand.  But if you can't find it, you can make your own but it can take between 2 and 3 weeks. Recipes can be found for it if you Google it. I don't think It'd be as good with plain vinegar.  To up the spiciness that everyone said it lacked, I did add about a 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to just the oil 4 days before putting together the salad.  It certainly added to the "spiciness" and it has one heck of a kick! I probably could have gotten away with just 1/4 tsp or letting it sit for fewer days.  I will do that again, when I make it the next time!  I also added Yancy's Peppadew cheese (a local mildly spicy sweet pepper cheese), mozzarella, and capocollo ham.  We did leave out the carrots because we don't care for raw carrots.  It might be really good with roasted red peppers and maybe some mushrooms and a couple of shakes of Italian seasoning in it too.  Can't wait to taste this after it has sat for a night!  I'm hoping this won't get gobbled up tomorrow, this is one dish that won't get tossed out; I'd love leftovers of this!  WOW! OK.....UPDATE: NOT A GREAT LEFTOVER MEAL!!!! It did taste wonderful that day. This salad doesn't get better as it gets older. if it doesn't get ate the day you add the lettuce, you will only ending up tossing it out.  So think about how much might get eaten that day because it might just end up being a waste of money!

This took awhile to prepare but it was really worth it!  The artichoke dressing was wonderful!  I left out the carrot and added a green pepper and some crumbled blue cheese.  We also added some pepperoni to make it a complete meal rather than a side dish.

A good salad, however, not very unique.  The artichokes had the most flavour from the marinade and the rest of the salad was rather ordinary.  I guess I missed something in the "spicey" part.  I would use this recipe as a base but would certainly add more herbs, spices to zip it up.

Given that my mission was to clean out the fridge of ingredients I had on hand before I leave for home in the morning, I didn't do a bad job of following the recipe pretty closely.  I don't care for tarragon vinegar or canola oil and I had a lemon to use so I made my dressing of olive oil, fresh lemon juice, the fresh thyme, dry mustard, garlic., salt and pepper, following the measurements as directed in the recipe.  I did not include the sugar, which never appeals to me in a salad dressing.  I grilled fresh baby artichokes and skipped the step of marinating them in the dressing. Regardless of insignificant individual modifications to this recipe it is one worth trying.  As long as you preserve the basic intent of the submitter and her recipe you will be rewarded with an excellent salad your fork will return to until your plate is clean.  It is layers of refreshing and compatible flavors, a rare and refreshing alternative to the typical tossed green salad.

This salad is wonderful to make ahead in containers of each ingredient and mixed at a dinner/party. It really is impressive to watch being mixed, of course, when you taste this salad you can't help but wonder where it's been all your life. It is FABULOUS!

Made a double batch for our 8 person Gourmet Club and everyone loved it including my 2 grown boys who finished up the leftovers when I got home.  The only change I made was to use half extra virgin olive oil.  My husband and boys have requested I definitely make this again!

For those of you that say it doesn't make good leftovers and want to have it for a few days, just leave out the lettuce and toss the rest of the ingredients together. When you serve the salad, put some chopped lettuce on each plate and spoon some of the remaining salad over top. If you keep the lettuce separate, the salad will keep and taste great for several days. This is what I do and the flavour will improve over time.

Great salad.  I added broccoli and marinated everything except the lettuce overnight with great results.  I will be making this again for company.

Delish!  Served this at a holiday progressive Italian dinner with friends.  Perfectly EXCELLENT salad!  
I used Dijon instead of the dry mustard, red vinegar instead of tarragon, and olive oil instead of the canola, but I'm sure these changes were insignificant.

I've made this salad three times now and received many compliments.  My family loves it and I took it to a PotLuck where it was the first salad to disappear!  I will make this salad in the fall and winter when other fresh ingredients are not at their peak.  I used olive oil (instead of Canola)and red wine vinegar (instead of taragon) and red leaf lettuce (instead of romaine).

This was a fun salad. It's not very 'spicy,' more like 'pickle-y.' The sweetnest of the dressing balances out the olives and artichokes - though I might go lighter on the sugar next time. I'm not usually real big on tarragon, but I liked the flavor in this salad. Thanks for the recipe!

We brought this to an Italian themed cocktail party. I did not think it was going to the hit that it was!  There were many different dishes brought and everyone was raving about this salad.  I did add a few different things like fresh mozzarella , good quality italian salami thinly sliced.I also roasted the peppers first and added to the artichoke with marinade.

Delicious.  The only change I made was to swap the cucumber for zucchini.  I was a bit reluctant initially since I don't really like tarragon, but as others have said, the flavor blended well with all the other ingredients.  Tasted like a restaurant quality salad.  Will absolutely make again.  Thank you, Diana, for a great salad.

The dressing is absolutely amazing. My advice is to marinade overnight. The flavor of the dressing with artichokes is perfect!

Changes: I used baby (instead of grated) carrots that I marinated in a jar, overnight, along with the artichokes.  I also let guests sprinkle cheese on their own.  Addition: a mix of freshly marinated Italian vegetables that I picked up in my local supermarket.  I prepared lettuce, red pepper, red onion and olives in advance and refrigerated them in sealed baggies. Then, when guests arrived, all I had to do was peel and slice the cucumber, toss everything into a large glass bowl and place it on the serving counter.  I decided to serve the salad in place of hors d'oeuvres--and it was a major success.  Very pretty and extremely tasty!

This salad is a regular for large gatherings. It is easy to prepare ahead of time, and gets gobbled up each time I make it. The flavors are wonderful and the combination of vegetables in the salad make it a definite treat to eat.

I was expecting a salad that would meet with rave reviews.....but this just wasn't anything special.  I was having a lasagne dinner and wished I had just made a Caesar instead.  This does not have anything "spicy" in  it!!! No one made any comments at all about the salad......

This was really delicious. Be sure to cut up the artichoke hearts into smaller pieces before marinading them.

This was good, but for us it wasn't rave-worthy. We eat salad every day, and we have a lot of interesting and different recipes, so this was just a bit run-of-the-mill for us. I made a couple of modifications: I don't use canola oil, and I was out of olive oil, so I used grapeseed oil, which has a mild flavor like canola; I used white wine vinegar and fresh tarragon; and instead of using red onion (which I don't like), I minced some shallots and added them to the dressing. I also added a few capers and used more olives than called for. We enjoyed it, but this isn't a keeper for us. Thanks, anyway.

This is so excellent. I did not have tarragon vinegar so I used half rice vinegar and half balsamic vinegar and it worked perfect. Will definately make again.

I really loved this salad! I did add Fresh Monzarella as one review previously stated and added Italian meats (Hot Calabrese, Pepper Salame and Hot Capocollo to it I think it helped in the flavor department.  Yummy!

I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to *spice* it up.  I scaled and subbed and ended up using less evoo because I was out, and added a bit of water to spread things adequately over the artichokes.   Worked out perfect for me, the salad  was neither drippy nor oily, lite yet perfectly flavored.  I squashed the health factor by topping with some leftover fried  chicken breast strips.

GREAT Recipe!!
I did make a few changes- I used red wine vinegar and olive oil and used all black olives. I also marinated all of the veggies overnight. I didn't think there seemed to be enought dressing, so I added about 1/2 cup of bottled balsamic vinagerette. Right before serving, I added halved cherry tomatoes to the lettuce and poured all the veggies and dressing on top.  I made this for an 'Italian themed' dinner party and it was very well received!! Everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks!!

I make this recipe all the time, the only changes to it I made are no artichokes (not a fan) and roasted red peppers in olive oil(drained) instead of the chopped ones called for. Turns out perfect everytime and my friends and family always ask for the recipe.

This is an wonderful recipe.I followed instructions as stated but I added grape tomatoes.I made the dressing up the day before and I think it makes a difference in the taste.Four hours before I served it I followed the advice of other reviewers and added all of the vegetables(not lettuce)into the dressing.Excellent!

Eh, it was good, but not fabulous.  There was nothing spicy about it, and frankly, it was kind of a disappointment.  I made this salad for a large group of people but only one person commented on the salad, so I know that it was not a hit.  

I added the artichoke hearts, as well as some roasted red peppers and garbanzo beans to the salad along with everything else in the recipe.  I don't think it really mattered what I added to the salad itself, it was the dressing that just wasn't anything special.  It was almost identical to the dressing that I make on a regular basis.  I even added extra garlic, some pepper, but it still didn't wow me or anyone else.  Oh well.

OK, but not spicy. We served it as is to the kids, then spiced up the adult version by adding harissa diluted in a little water. That was an improvement. I think I'll use spicy marinated olives and artichokes next time to get the spiciness promised in this recipe.

Wow -- utterly amazing and a hit with my guests. I didn't get to take any home 'cause they boxed it up for their lunch tomorrow! Couldn't find Tarragon Vinegar so I sub'd White Wine Vinegar and some herbs. Added some cherry tomatoes too and marinated everything except lettuce overnight..... Delicious, Tasty and Tangy

Great salad.  I substituted the oil from the marinated artichoke hearts jar for the first six ingredients, as I hate to waste that.  I've used it for lots of different salad dressings and meat marinades.

I thought this was good.  It's pretty versatile, so you could add whatever you like.  I thought the idea of pepperoni and pepperocini's would be good.  I didn't have tarragon vinegar, so I just used red wine vinegar.  I wish I had the green olives - that would definately have put a little extra zing in this!

Excellent.  I used Rice vinegar with oregano and basic instead of vinegar with tarragon.  I also used half extra virgin olive oil and half canola oil.

I made this to accompany traditional spaghetti and meatballs.  Substituted extra virgin olive oil for canola, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  It was delicious with the meal and even better the next day.  Will definitely make again and again!

This was okay, but nothing special. I love the ingredients in the dressing but I didn't like the dressing itself.. somehow, it was too tangy yet too bland at the same time. I used organic baby greens with fresh dill, parsley and basil, and that helped. I probably won't make this again.

This salad and dressing is a nice change from the regular Italian dressing I usually serve. I sautéed the onions, red bell pepper, and mushrooms instead of raw and used gorgonzola cheese.  I didn't care for the taste of thyme though so I cut the serving in half and added some dried basil.  Also, like other reviewers, I substituted the tarragon vinegar for red wine vinegar and added fresh garlic and a few capers.  I served it with eggplant parmesan.  I will definitely make again!

Made this for a dinner party and everybody had seconds. I added some Buffala Mozzarella and it was just perfect, only thing I would change would be to add more artichoke.
Will definitely make this again.

Good recipe - Like someone suggested in a previous review, I also swapped olive oil for canola oil and used rice vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar.  In addition, I used 1 1/2 T of dried italian spice mix instead of the frest herbs.  I will definitely make this again.

I really liked this recipe.  I used 1/2 canola, and 1/2 olive oils.  I also cut up all the veggies real small, more chopped.  Then marinated all the veggies overnight.  It almost has "slaw" consistency.  Then before serving, I made some more dressing, and mixed romaine with the veggies, and a little more dressing, and fresh pepper.  I served with Romano on the side.  I was half tempted to serve the "slaw" on top of the romaine, because it was so colorful.  Might do that next time.

A great starting point for the imagination. I loved the dressing, though I used olive oil and more garlic. The name spicy may be a bit misleading, as I did not find it spicy or even all that tangy, so I added roasted red peppers, pepperoni, and kalamata olives, and when it got served as leftovers the next day, it got everything but the kitchen sink thrown in! Still good!

Oh my...so good! I made my own tarragon vinegar by adding 1 T muddled/crushed fresh tarragon leaves to 1 c white wine vinegar and letting it sit overnight. I also subbed olive oil for the canola, grape tomatoes for the carrots, and only used black olives (no green). It looked as good as it tasted, and many guests went back for seconds. Seriously, this is exceptionally good!

A lot of tasty ingredients in this salad so we will definitely make again. The vinegar was a little strong for us, so we may cut back on that a bit. Also my daughter thought adding some tomatoes, chunks of mozzarella and maybe some chicken would be great additions.

Took a double batch to a pot luck dinner and came home with an empty bowl ! Great dressing- I had never used Tarragon Vinegar  before but now I love it. Has trouble finding plain pitted green olives...so just popped out the  garlic stuffing and sliced those.  Didn't grate carrots so I diced matchstick carrots instead. Will definitely make this again-.

I think this would have been excellent if I had had terragon vinegar and Romano cheese. I tried using white vinegar plus dried terragon and mozzarella. Just wasn't quite as strong of dressing as I would have liked. I added turkey pepperoni and left out the green olives. I love green olives but family members don't. I can tell they would have been good in it though.

Wonderful salad that can be tailored to your liking... 
I used EVOO instead of canola and used marinated artichokes - which need to be drained on paper towels before adding or it will make your salad bland and watery which happened on my first go round! Also added halved cherry tomatoes per the reviews but would add them at the end when serving the salad as it makes the salad watery if used in the marinade.  I found Kalamata olives to add the much needed salt that this salad needed. Very easy recipe and although very good base it tasted very bland which could have come from the water in the tomatoes and artichokes - so it needs to be tailored to your liking with seasoning or replace with a very good Mediterranean Vinaigrette!! It is a very good base salad that needs seasoning!

I made this for a small dinner party last night and it was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it and there wasn't a speck left!  The only thing I did differently was to substitute olive oil for canola oil and then marinate all of the veggies overnight and add some premium mozzarella balls.  It's so good, I'm making it again tonight!  Thank you so much for this excellent recipe!

I have been wanting to make this again as I brought it to a party and left the rest behind. I"m not sure if it could have been intact the next day anyway. But I sure would have liked to have found out. I followed the most helpful review that says to marinate all the vegetables and to use olive oil. It was a hit at the party.

This is a family favorite!  The dressing is quite special.  I use marinated artichoke hearts to add a little more zing.  I have added the following to the salad:  grape tomatoes, shredded mozzarella, pepperoncini peppers, and pepperoni.  This salad is always a big hit!

I made this for a get together we went to last night.  As in a previous post, I did not have the tarragon vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar with a half tablespoon of dried tarragon.   Other than that one substitution, the rest of the recipe was the same. Highly recommend!  I have some leftovers, and am looking forward to eating it today.

Umm, It was a yummy recipe! I used olive oil for marinade and no artichoke ,because my husband doesn't like it. I used green onions instead of using red onion. Added some broccoli in the salad. I marinade the chicken overnight "lemon & garlic" marinade. Grilled the chicken and shredded the chicken. Finished up with boil chopped eggs and freshly grated montery jack.

I served this at a all girl's party. All my friends raved about it (Yes, I have great friends!). I couldn't believe it. I've been trying to learn to cook more new things, so it was very satisfying when everyone asked for the recipe. I used cherry tomatoes and a yellow bellpepper. Also used white wine vinegar because I couldn't find tarragon vinegar. I didn't add black olives. Draining the artichoke hearts is a great idea. LOVED THIS RECIPE!

Made this for a family holiday gathering and for some reason it was not a major hit -- the other ("regular") salad was eaten much more.  I had a lot of this left.  I definitely cut back on the onions, but even that didn't seem to make it a crowd pleaser.  Nonetheless, it was still pretty tasty in my personal opinion.
