These cookies were absolutely amazing!  I did not have any problems with the dough sticking to the cookie sheet but I did lightly grease the cookie sheet even though it said not to.  The frosting is really more like fudge so you have frost them quickly otherwise it gets too hard to spread.  I also sandwiched the cookies with the frosting in the middle.  The flavor of these cookies is outstanding and I will be adding this recipe to my recipe box!

Taste was good but I had some problems with the recipe. Followed exactly with the exception of adding a 1/4 teaspoon of orange extract to the fudge topping. Consistancy of the dough before baking was like a pound cake instead of cookie dough. Some stuck slightly to the pans and left cookies that didn't really have a bottom. Even the ones that didn't stick were hollow (can't think of a better way to describe it), so I decided to make them into sandwiches instead of spreading the fudge on the top. The texture of the fudge is exactly like the fudge I make at Christmas and it set up very quickly! It tastes great with the orange in the cookies, so...4 stars.  The kids liked them and they will be eaten. Thanks for sharing.
