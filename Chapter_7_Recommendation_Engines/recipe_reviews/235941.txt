Recipe was great...I usually use 2 chocolate packets for a single cup, so I was going to make this thicker/sweeter than normal. I'd say that rather than adjust the sugar amount, simply adjust the milk content (3 cups for a fairly sweet mix, 4 1/2 cups for a more orthodox sweetness. Great recipe and very easy!

It turned out amazing! Most hot chocolates that are on here have too many ingredients, and they take too long. This recipe was the best I have ever made, and didn’t take nearly as long as the instructions said!

Mildly sweet with dark chocolate taste. Turned out smooth and creamy. I used 1% because that’s what we had. I might have added a little more chocolate than expected.

this is the best and I'm almost positive everybody has all of the ingredients. just match it while its on the stove. it'll go from not boiling at all to over flowing in less than 5 seconds. literally!

I thought this cocoa had wonderful chocolate flavor but it needed just a tad more sugar for my tastes.  Because I had 1% milk, I used 2/3 milk and 1/3 light cream.  I also added just a tad of vanilla and topped with a dollop of Fluff.  The perfect drink for a cold winter’s day.

I only had 1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate, so I added about 3 squares of almond bark. it was super delicious! !
