I made this cake (and BTW it is the original Chocolate Decadence that was created by a Chef in the early 70's) - it's almost difficult to call it a cake.  Remove the eggs from heat when they are about room temp to the touch and constantly whisk, remove from heat and whip the eggs on medium speed for about 4 minutes; also the cake should still be "jiggly" in the center when you take it from the oven.  The recipe I use requires the cake to be frozen for 12 hours after cooled from the oven and about 15 minutes prior to serving set out on counter.  Spread thin layer whipped topping on sides and top(home made - 1 C heavy whipping cream, 1 T conf. sugar and 1/2 t. vanilla) -  load with chocolate curls in the center and pipe some whip cream using a star tip around the curls.  Raspberry sauce is excellent on the plate. It is 12 servings because it is so increadibly rich.
This is the best truly chocoholic recipe I have ever made! Thanks so much for sharing it.  You must try this!

DO NOT LET THE EGGS GET SCRAMBLED.  Further clarity as far as instructions goes would be nice.  I'll try this one again and it'll probably come out brilliantly.

This cake is very, very rich...a little bit does indeed go a long way.  It was very easy to make. My husband and I really enjoyed it...it satisfies a sweet or chocolate craving very well.

The intensity of this recipe is incredible.  No flavor is quite the match.  The torte was a little crumbly even when warmed to room temperature, so I am going to try some new things to try to thicken it up.
