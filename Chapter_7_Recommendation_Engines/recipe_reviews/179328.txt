The recipe as written lacks flavor.  All I could taste was frozen lime flavor.  I almost felt like it was a pina colada without the coconut flavor.  Which if you added in some creme of coconut this would be a perfect pina colada recipe.  I didnt have any coconut, so I ended up adding in some amaretto, grenadine, and a splash of orange juice and it was very good that way.  But as written it was very bland.
