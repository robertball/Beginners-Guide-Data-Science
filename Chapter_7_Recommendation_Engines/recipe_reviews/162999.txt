I made this for one last night, only I used frozen berries and banana and skipped the ice cubes all together. (I don't like to water down my alcohol!) This is like a dessert and cocktail in one, but I'll tell ya, I was pretty happy by the time I got to the bottom of my glass. The powdered lemonade was a nice touch, it gave it just a touch of sweet and tart. This drink owns.

This was very tasty. I omitted the whiskey, as I don't care for it, other than that I made no other changes.
The smoothie was a little on the thick side, I added some pineapple juice to thin it. I will definitely be making these for parties this summer.

I made this for a party, and With the ingredients listed it was terrible.  It took me  20 minutes to get it to be drinkable without wasting all of the other ingredients.
