This recipe was easy to make, and had lots of flavor. However, if you're looking for a traditional-tasting Indian curry dish, this one misses the mark.  Still, pretty yummy on a Wednesday night!

Too much curry.  Did not like the cinnamon.  I liked the Greek yogurt and the way it came together.

I thought this was wonderful. Easy and quick. Served with dosas ( recipe also here on Allrecipes) ad a little extra yogurt on the side to cool the curry

it wasn't horrible, but not something I would make again.
