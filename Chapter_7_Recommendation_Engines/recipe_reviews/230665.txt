Tried this but prefer a similar recipe made in the slow cooker. Increase sauce to 1 cup (as many others do, I use Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ), add 1/4C brown sugar, 1/8C lime juice and 4small apples peeled and chopped. Prepare bacon and wrap chicken the same way, place in slow cooker and cover with BBQ mixture. Cover and cook on low 4-6 hours. Chicken is super moist and I like the slightly sweeter flavor.

Used Sweet Baby Rays served it with mashed cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. I will be serving this meal again and again. Very easy and the meat is just perfect juicy with so much flavor.

I like to use Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce for this recipe. I serve it with mashed potatoes or buttered pasta as the boys like to have something on the side to sop up the sauce on the plate.

I used Jack Daniels sauce and also topped the chicken with Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese in the last few minutes so that it melted. Just like an entry we get a a local dinner.

This was very good. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Chipotle BBQ sauce and it was awesome. My family and I really enjoyed it.

Very good recipe. I followed the recipe exactly until the very end. I added cheese and diced tomatoes and left it covered on the stove top while I finished up on a few things. It was just like the Monterey chicken I get at a popular restaurant

I just made this recipe for a family of 7 and they all loved it!  As th others said, I also used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and because I was cooking a lot more chicken than the original recipe called for I had to extend the cooking time to about an hour.  I do intend to make this recipe again.

This is a very good recipe and works well when a slow cooker isn't an option. Like so many other reviewers I also am a big fan of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. It just seems to make everything better. The slow cooker seems to make the chicken or pork come out juicy and tender every time. If you want a crispy top on the meat simply transfer it to a shallow dish or pan and stick in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes before serving.

As written I believe it is bland.
Have made this recipe for years with a slight variation. I season my chicken with garlic and lawry's seasoning and if you want a kick a little red pepper as well. The top with my favorite BBQ sauce ( Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy). Also after it is finished cooking I top it with a slice of cheese.

Will be trying this recipe with chicken thighs, my family's favorite. Had to give a rating, but have not tried this recipe, I'm sure I'd give it a 5 star rating after trying it, can't miss with chicken & bacon.

Sweet Baby Ray's... everyone isn't using this sauce because it's just marginally OK. It's the best out there!! No other way to do this recipe. And the nice lady that gave the slow cooker way to do this one... she nailed it! It rocks in the slow cooker, too! This is an easy one to put together with great results. I served mine with Tricia's Pineapple Cheese Casserole. Unfortunately, no leftovers, people were scraping my dishes on to their plate to get every last shred of food. It was kinda embarrassing for them... lol but a way big compliment for Tricia and Rach! Well, it would be if I didn't claim these recipes as my own. Shhhh....

Quick, easy and very tasty. The whole family enjoyed it.  I used KC Masterpiece Honey BBQ Sauce.  Also seasoned chicken with S & P and Rotisserie Chicken Seasoning before baking.  I used Hormel pre-cooked bacon which worked great and saved me a step and some clean-up.  Served it with corn on the cob, green beans and fresh sliced peaches.  Thanks Rach!  Will make again and again!

Very easy to make and delicious. I added some brown sugar to the barbecue sauce just to add a little sweetness. I served with some french style string beans. Will add more than 2 slices of bacon per breast next time though.

Loved this! I added a bbq spice mix to the chicken then put the bacon on top.  I surround the chicken in the pan with sliced apples which helped added a lot of flavor to the sauce in the pan.  soooo yummy! bbq chicken with out the work

I fixed this last night it came out perfect.  No need to slow cook this, the chicken was moist, tender, and with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce, it was perfect.  Served it with Crunchy Macaroni Salad and broccoli florets.  The dinner was a success and we'll have it again.

Delicious!  This was so simple that I couldn't believe how good it was!  I sprinkled some Adobo seasoning on the chicken, wrapped it as shown in the half cooked bacon, and put it in the oven.  After 30 minutes, I added the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and cooked for an additional 15 minutes per instructions.  Could not believe how good it was.  I served it with a roasted vegetables recipe (also from this site).  Yummy!!!

Update:  I just made this for the second time, and I was smart enough to make extra.  So the following night I cut up the leftover chicken into small pieces, added a bit more BBQ sauce, and spread it on flat breads.  I added some chopped red onion, mozzarella and a bit of blue cheese and made absolutely delicious barbecue chicken flatbreads.  I will always make extra from now on!

I added some seasoned salt and fresh cracked black pepper to the chicken and it still could have used some additional salt but overall was very good. I was afraid to add too much salt not knowing how salty the bacon would be. We added cheese to one to try it out and you definitely need something acidic to offset it. So next time I will try adding the tomato as some have suggested. It pleased everyone because we all love bacon, my son doesn't like fried chicken or any kind of coating on chicken and it seems to be pretty versatile even making it in one dish. We used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce too. Definitely will tweak and try again!

Thank you for recipe! Bacon chicken and BBQ together... yummy. I wrapped bacon around chicken then cooked for 30 minutes, broiled on high for 10 minutes and back to bake for 10. Nice crispy bacon.

I made it for the second time this weekend and my kids couldn't wait for me to take it out of the oven. One of the best ever. It is easy to make and tastes great! Trudy

Great, simple recipe and the kids loved it.  I added more barbeque sauce because my kids love barbeque sauce.  I also placed the chicken on top of mashed potatoes with grated cheese on top.  It was a hit and EASY.  Thanks!

I made this recipe as written. The BBQ sauce I used was Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy. The chicken breast was moist with a lot of flavor. I followed the advice of another reviewer and lined a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. This made for an easy clean up. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Excellent. Perfect for a week night after work as the recipe is quick and easy. My husband raved about the dinner. The only difference I did was to add a little shredded cheese and melt in the oven before serving.

Delicious.... a big hit with the kids too. I followed it exactly, using Sweet Baby Ray's, however I toward the end of baking I added some shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese on top and let melt. Served with green beans and mushroom wild rice.

I made this as written but sprinkled on some grilling spice before first cook. Not sure if the bacon added that much but this was some good chicken! Used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce. This was fast and easy. Will make again! Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty and easy. I took some potato wedges, tossed them in the bacon grease, and put them in the pan with the chicken, and then seasoned the whole pan with garlic salt and black pepper. Main and side all done at once!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe for our larger family, but kept the baking time the same, and the chicken was wonderfully savory and tender. Next time -- there will definitely be a next time! -- I think I may sprinkle the chicken with a bit of the Smoky Chipotle grinder seasoning we like, and maybe a bit of smoked paprika as well, because we loved the "grilled" taste. A keeper.

Simple, straightforward. Not spectacular but fed the young'uns well. Took a lot longer to cook, but I got these gargantuan chicken breasts, and there were six of them instead of four.

Made this recipe, and with a few changes it can be 5 stars! Firstly, I seasoned the chicken before baking with a little salt and pepper. Also, right before putting in the oven I spooned my leftover bacon greases over the chicken, giving it even more of that awesome bacon flavor! Finished it off with some sweet baby rays, and it was delectable! Served with mashed potatoes, biscuits, and grilled asparagus.

OMG!! This was wonderful!!! I made it as written using my own homemade BBQ sauce. The chicken was moist & flavorful. The bacon was nice & crispy & added a nice dimension of flavor. I served it with mashed potatoes & a marinated cucumber, tomato, bell pepper & onion salad. The BF loved it! This is going into my rotation. I wouldn't change a thing!

Next time I will cover the baking dish with foil.  The bacon grease splattered all over the oven.  The chicken was moist and tender.  This may be my new go-to chicken dish.

Made it as-is several times with Sweet baby Ray’s – my family of six loves it so much – so much that one of my daughters says it is her favorite meal and asked for it on her birthday over going out. Might try adding cheese next time but definitely a hit in my home!

This is one of our favorite recipes.  It's so easy to make and is absolutely delicious.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and topped them with shredded cheddar for the last 5 minutes.  Planning to make this again next time we have guests over for dinner since it's so easy and good.

We are in the midst of a kitchen renovation, so my cooking options are really limited.  I chose this recipe because I had a grill and a microwave to use.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave  to the point that it was about half done.  I then wrapped the chicken breasts in the bacon and basted one side of the chicken with the barbeque sauce.  I grilled it on about 350 degrees for 8 minutes.  I turned the chicken, basted the upper side with the sauce,  and grilled for another 8 minutes.  It had a good flavor and certainly met my needs for a simple home-cooked main course with the options I had.  I will use this recipe again.

This is easy, quick and delicious.  The only thing I changed was slicing the chicken horizontally to make them thinner.  They cooked more evenly and were so juicy.  This is a staple entree  in our home.  My boys devour it every time!

My chicken breasts were bought in a family pack so the sizes differed. I had to cook 3 of the 4  breasts 12 1/2 more minutes, but they all turned out delicious - tasty and tender. I did add garlic powder and Mrs. Dash onion/herb seasoning to the breasts before placing the bacon on them.

this is an awesome recipe. so easy to make, and my entire family loved it! (I have some very picky eaters in my family) will definitely be making it often. however, I have to try to find a thicker bbq sauce because the one I used just ran off the chicken. I think I'll use sweet baby rays next time.

I am so pleased as to how this turned out! This is easy, cheap, and perfect for a weeknight meal. I seasoned it with lemon pepper, garlic salt, and Dale seasoning. You can also use Worcestershire sauce. I also put olive oil on the chicken for moisture. You will not be disappointed with this recipe!?????

I used Steer’s BBQ sauce (because those other ones don’t exist in South Africa)- which made for a great moisture barrier and the chicken was super tender. Will add some pineapple and garlic next time to doll it up a bit but as a busy student in this is great

Absolutely delicious and will make again.  Cut the chicken into smaller pieces and wrapped with bacon so they would cook faster (25 minutes total).   Used Famous Dave's Sweet and Zesty BBQ sauce.

This was very good! I used Sweet Baby Ray's, as did a lot of others. It was perfectly juicy, with just the right amount of bbq taste to it. Thanks!

It was tastier than I thought it would be, but I admit I used turkey bacon b/c we don't eat pork. I think it would have been really delicious with regular bacon.

So fast and easy on a busy night. Can do a wide range of sides! We switch to the broiler for the last few minutes to get the bacon sizzling and make the bbq into a nice glaze.

I really enjoyed this meal!
The changes I made were to cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise to cook more evenly and cooked the bacon only slightly - keeping it still long and not so shriveled up.
I will definitely make this again!

I know most here are fans of the Sweet Baby Ray’s sauce – but why?  I didn’t use it because I am just tired of smoke-flavored  thick corn syrup – ‘high fructose corn syrup’, ‘sodium benzoate’, ‘caramel color’….just tired of manufacturers giving us good flavored slop!  I did find a small bottle of bbq sauce at my local little grocery store called “Braswell’s Molasses BBQ Sauce” – made in Statesboro,Georgia – and it has NONE of the above ingredients – and I could really taste the difference right out of bottle (I live nowhere near Georgia – so was thrilled to find this brand!)!   Now  - onto the recipe – I microwaved my bacon for just under 3 minutes – just to get the edges to start to curl.  Then I wrapped the chicken breasts and immediately poured the entire 13.5-oz bottle over them.  Baked for 1 hour – came out so perfect.  Simple recipe, will use again.  Served with cheddar mashed potatoes  (cheddar biscuits would be great too!) and sweet green peas with lots of butter!

Loved it. Some suggestions that I used or would use next time.
(1) I would filet the thicker chicken breasts to make them cook a bit faster, (2) I used a rub after wrapping the chicken, I would run them before next time (try Slap Yo Mama dry rub for some kick), (3) I would cut my chicken breasts into smaller portions so the bacon can wrap around well.

I used some Sweet Baby Rays at the end and the family loved them. My wife was a naysayer at first but by the end she was all for it. My 13 year old just said, these are awesome and had seconds. Best grilled chicken recipe I have made in a long time.

This was so good and so easy.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. Next time I will try it with chicken breast.   I also didn't cook the bacon ahead of time.  I cooked it at 375 for about 50 mins and then coated with newmans own barbecue sauce while I let the chicken rest(about 10-15 mins).  I served it over spinach and a side of mashed potatoes.

Very easy and great tasting dish.  I only had chicken breasts so I just cut them in half and then followed the recipe as written.  Chicken breast can get dry very fast but this dish was very tender and juicy.

This recipe is very good. I do not really enjoy barbecue sauce; however, my husband loves it so I wanted to make him this dish. It was very good! We used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce instead of Jack Daniel's. Next time I make it I plan on putting honey mustard instead of BBQ sauce and I think that will make it taste like an entirely different dish! This is another recipe that will be added to our favorites!

Wrapped 4 slices of bacon around each breast. Had a couple of breasts left over, cut them into bite size chunks and had them in a salad the next day.

I loved this and so did my family!  I followed the directions - but I pounded the chicken slightly.  I gave the chicken a drizzle with flavored basting oil - gave it a little salt, pepper and garlic - but did all else the same.  I felt I was getting the best of both worlds on a cold spring evening - the flavor of grilled chicken and the easy a deliciousness of oven baked chicken! Will Def make again!!

I have been using this method for 15 years but I always put the bacon on a rack in the pan.  I always spray JUST THE RACK, not the pan; there is too much oil if you spray both. I always use regular sliced bacon - not thick cut but most important of all, I always stretch the slices a little before laying them on the rack.  This makes the bacon crisp up better.

It's a baked chicken breast with a couple slices of bacon on it and store-bought BBQ sauce? I'd be embarrassed to submit this and call it an actual recipe! But I actually make something similar all the time and I call it a chicken sandwich.

I  used a local bbq sauce, Ken Davis, and it turned out great! For such a simple recipe I had my doubts but since it didn't call for a trip to the store I gave it a shot - I'm so glad I did! I mashed up some red potatoes for a side and sautéed asparagus in the bacon grease. My fiancé was thrilled to have a little indulgent comfort food for dinner and I loved how quick it all came together.

Delicious & easy recipe! Only changes I made was to coat the chicken breast with bbq sauce, in addition to putting on bacon, & I baked it on a rack on cookie sheet so the bacon underneath the chicken wasn't soggy. Keeper for sure!

My husband is not a fan of chicken until I made this. (What man doesn't like bacon?) I made it exactly as the recipe indicated except I didn't bother to measure the BBQ sauce. I simply slathered the chicken with it.  It was a hit!

Very good, basic recipe.  I am a beginner cook and found it hard to get the bacon right when baking it along with the chicken.  My bacon got overcooked on my first try, so I had to take the bacon out.  I was afraid the bacon might be underdone if I didn't cook it at all before bacon.  So I decided to just cook the bacon separately and crumble it on top.  I also added cheddar cheese to the top.

This is a delicious way to perk up BBQ chicken, because everything is better with bacon. 
I followed this recipe exactly, using a sweet & spicy BBQ sauce. It was super simple and a fast meal to prep. Will definitely make again.

I sliced my chicken breasts in half lengthwise because a whole chicken breast is too much for one serving for us. This shortened the cook time a little. But, delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly but then sprinkled a little Monterey Jack cheese on at the end. Thanks.

I used this recipe, but I switched out the beasts for thighs. I also added salt & pepper to the chicken before wrapping it in bacon. Maybe it was because I used thighs, but I definitely had to cook it longer than prescribed! I would try cooking it for 45 minutes before adding the sauce, and then another 15-20 minutes with the sauce. Overall, it was delicious!! My family loved it.

My family loved this recipe. I was surprised when somebody said they sprinkled the chicken with salt & pepper before wrapping it in bacon. With all the flavors, I didn't think it would need it. But I did it any way. I'm glad I did. Other than that & melting cheddar cheese on top right at the end, I made the recipe just as it said. The cooking time was perfect & the recipe is DELICIOUS!!

This is so quick and easy.  It's also good with your choice of cheese added near the end.  My choice was provolone.  This is great as is, and would make a great base for all kinds added ingredients.

This was pretty good. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy Barbecue Sauce to give it a nice ba;lance of kick and savory sweetness. I loved the smokey bacon and sauce that went with the tender chicken. Overall, this was a pretty good recipe and very simple to make. I served this with roasted green beans and it was a nice easy meal that everyone enjoyed.

How could you go wrong with delicious chicken, bacon and the sweet/spicy taste of barbecue sauce?  Another awesome way to make this recipe is to take chicken tenders and poke a skewer through and use a grill instead of an oven.  This is a great appetizer too!  Cut in small bites, after cooking the bacon cut pieces in half and wrap around each chicken bite.  You wouldn't need to cook as long, but these would be cute with toothpicks poking out as well.  Kudos Rach!

As of 5/7/15 this recipe has almost 5 stars.  For me, a 5 star recipe is something worth serving to company, it's something SO good I make it at least once every month, maybe every 2 months. Its SO good I tell my mom to make it.  This was NOT that for me.

This wasn't bad, but unless I'm feeling lazy I don't think I will be making it again,  it's easy and quick, and that's how it tasted to me.  My husband said he liked it but he's NOT a picky eater at all...

Very good recipe. I used Baby Rays BBQ sauce, made loaded scalloped potatoes and buttered corn. My boyfriend loved it. Would definitely make this again.

This is a very good basic recipe.  Like others, I made a few changes.  I rubbed down the chicken breasts with Kick Butt Rib Rub - Chipotle Honey, then 5 minutes before they were done, I put a piece of Provolone cheese on top of each breast.  My boys LOVED it, and told me to save this recipe!  I make my own BBQ sauce, so no Sweet Baby Ray's here.

We loved this chicken! It comes out so moist and flavorful.  I too am a Sweet Baby Ray's fan.  So I used the Honey Barbeque Sauce.  I doubled the recipe for company and it took a little longer to bake.  Very simple to prepare, but definitely a dish to serve company. Thanks for sharing a great recipe Rach!

Great recipe with a few minor additions.  I used thighs, salt, peppered and put garlic salt on one side. Flipped down and then put the bacon (hickory smoked thick cut) on. I only used one piece each.  Baked per directions, added sauce and baked 20 more minutes.  Then I put under the broiler for three minutes to finish the chicken and bacon off.  It was a big hit and will be added to the menu at our house.  Quick and easy recipe.

This was good, but I don't get why the BBQ sauce can't be put on from the beginning and then basted throughout for more flavor?  Also, I think some cheese would be awesome on this, might as well right?!

Depending on the BBQ sauce you're using, it's a very easy recipe.  Chicken and bacon.  Both go well together.  I add a BBQ chicken seasoning to the chicken prior to the cooking.  
If you like your sauce, you'll like this recipe.

I made this the other night & my husband and two girls loved it. I did make a few changes. Before wrapping the chicken I seasoned the meat with garlic salt and Creole seasoning. When I pulled the chicken out and added the bbq I also added some frenches fried onion to the top of a few pieces. My husband loved it. Will make again for sure.

This was wonderful! I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original, and right before they were done I added a bit of cheese on top (sorry, we're cheese people). I don't think the cheese made much of a difference flavor wise. I'll skip that next time.
The chicken came out so juicy and tender, delicious.
The kids absolutely loved it, and both gobbled it up. It was very quick and easy to make. I will definitely make this again, it is a great way to use up leftover bacon.

Easy yes but nice to be inspired by a recipe. It made me think of bbq in the summer, even though the grill is buried in 2' of snow. Cut chicken breasts down the middle and wrapped 1 slice of bacon around each piece. Great!

instead of breasts we used thighs.  It was awesome.  I served this at a dinner party this weekend and there wasn't a thing left over but dirty dishes.  I didn't change a thing with this recipe and everyone loved it.

Such a simple and great tasting dish!  I use chicken thighs, homemade Carolina style BBQ sauce and a granulated garlic/dried parsley/black pepper dry rub.  I usually cook an extra 20-25 minutes after adding the sauce...instead of 10-15.  Quick, easy and tasty!

Very tasty!  I seasoned the chicken with a little seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder before wrapping it with the bacon.

This was good. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce. I put the chicken under the broiler for about 2 minutes to crisp the bacon because my family likes crispy bacon.  Next time, I might cook the bacon longer. Depending on the thickness of the bacon, I think the bacon needs to be cooked longer before placing on the chicken. I also think, the cooking time varies if the chicken breasts are smaller. I had smaller chicken breasts and the chicken was done at 30 minutes.

I guess I wasn't using the right kind of barbecue sauce--I know nothing about barbecue stuff. The chicken was tender and the bacon was tasty, but the sauce just sat there--didn't melt down the sides of the chicken at all.

This was a big hit with my family! We used Chubbs Honey Pecan BBQ sauce, but any BBQ sauce you prefer would probably be just as tasty.Simple and tasted great! Will definately be making again!

Great, easy recipe.  It works either on the grill or in the oven.  I've have fixed this several times now.  My son's favorite meal!  Served with rice cooked in chicken broth and baked okra which tastes just like fried okra but doesn't have all the grease!
