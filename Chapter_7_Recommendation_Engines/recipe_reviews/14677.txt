This was the first time I've made brisket, and it came out wonderful! The only tip for those of you whose meat dried out: check how it is looking after about 3-4 hours. I cut the meat up at this point, against the grain, and added it back to the pot. After another 2 hours or so simmering in the juice, it was tender, and the sauce was great on wide egg noodles. A keeper!

Nicki,

The brisket was cooked in a crockpot for 9 hours, and prepared exactly what the recipe called for.  I did however, have to made adjustments because I made it for 5 people only.

It had a very good flavor but it was very tough.

What did I do wrong?  Or could it have been just the brisket?  It was a 1.50 Lancaster Brand Brisket. 

Please let me know, because I would like to make it again soon.

Thanks,

Nancy P.

ALWAYS turns out wonderful! Had not tried cooking Brisket, although loved eating it, as always sounded complicated to make, until I found this recipe. Always tender and so simple and economical to make. Can't say enough about how easy and GREAT this recipe is.

used sweet baby ray's hot and spicy bbq sauce instead of ketchup and gave it a little kick.

This is the perfect base for pot roast sandwiches. For better color and flavor, brown the brisket on the stovetop before placing in the crockpot.  An hour before done, I added some sliced onions, cubed red potatoes and chunked carrots to it.

The gravy to this was awesome!  I took the advice of one reviewer and sliced the meat after 3/4 hours.  I also added beef broth (just enough to cover the beef) at that point to make certain it would not dry out. this gravy is a keeper-I am going to try it on other meat such as roast beef and pot roast.  I think this recipe should also be listed under "gravy"!FABULOUS!

When I was preparing this unusual recipe, my husband was watching..after I poured the ketchup on and rubbed it all over the meat, he looked horrified and exclaimed "If you don't feel like cooking, just say so!" I laughed and told him this was the recipe. Boy was this ever good and so simple. It had a great flavor and was a change from the usual crock pot roast. Thanks for a good laugh and a great recipe!

I took this recipe and sort of ran with it.  I used 1 can of condensed tomato soup with two and a half cans of water instead of ketchup, 1 packet of onion soup dip mix, a few healthy shakes of worcestershire sauce, and garlic salt.  I also added baby red potatoes and coarsely chopped carrots.  At the end, I took out all of the meat and vegetables and added two tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with a dash of cold water to make some great gravy.  Good luck!

Added Tony Cacheres (I live in Southern Louisiana, we have to have more spice)And extra salt and pepper to taste, and cornstarch to desired consistancy. They were right, gravy is to die for and excellent with hawaiian rolls or whatever bread you have handy.  Definitely a keeper!

This is outstanding and so simple to make! I followed the recipe with the exception of a few small adjustments. My brisket was 6 lbs. so I upped the amounts of garlic powder, ketchup and water to compensate, but otherwise left the ingredients as listed. It was done in 9 hours and was delicious! My husband raved about it. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was the first brisket I ever cooked (many years ago) & my husband LOVED it. It made great sandwiches for him the next day.
Over the years I have made revisions. (I no longer cook it in the crock pot)
But it is still a great recipe.

I'm sorry, this recipe left a lot to be desired.  While the brisket was exceptionally tender, the sauce was horrible.  It tasted like ketchup and onions (which it is).  I had to add beef broth and some demi glace to give it some body and flavor and it was still pretty horrible.

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did make a couple of changes this time.  Instead of ketchup, I used chili sauce - just slightly spicier.  I also increased the amount of water and chili sauce (1/2 c) to get more gravy.  I put in enough water to go halfway up the brisket.  We did use the suggestion to put over noodles.  Worked great.  Added homemade slaw as a side.  Can't wait for sandwiches tomorrow.

reply  for nancy: you cooked it for 9 hours. When making a smaller roast for less people adjust the time you cook as well. A 2 to 3 lb roast will only need to cook 4 to 5 hours or so on low in a crockpot.

Based on other reviews and my preference......I had a 4 1/2 lb brisket, browned it quickly, then made as recipe suggested except I added some hot sauce (for flavor) and I used (chicken) broth instead of water.  This cooked and was ready in 9 hours.  I shredded it in big chunks and made sandwiches out of it.  Very good!  Would make again.

I made this as posted and it was very tender and moist.  I shredded the leftovers and added BBQ sauce for BBQ beef sandwiches later in the week.  This is a keeper!

This was really good, and I would make it again.  I have to admit that I am not a huge brisket fan because of all the fat, but my husband loves it so I try to make it for him once in a while.  It's nice to have a change from the regular old corned beef and cabbage style.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a very simple recipe and it was my first attempt at making a brisket.  I had the website change the serving size and I think that is why I think it came out just a bit dry.  Next time I will get a cut of meat that hasn't been trimmed of the fat and I will add more water.  I liked the taste and I'll use the recipe again.

I thought this was by far the best corned beef I have ever had. I added 1/2 cup of beef broth in the bottom of the crockpot and followed the rest of the recipe. It was wonderful!!

This was very good!  It was the first time that I had ever made a beef brisket and was very nervious about the outcome-but I had nothing to worry about.  Hubby liked it, even kids liked it.  I would have been good too if I added some veggies into the mix (carrots,celery,potatoes) Almost like a stew.  I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe, it's a keeper!

This recipe is great basic.  The trick is a tender and flavorful end-product is to use a piece of meat that has nice marbling and decent layer of fat.  Slow cookers do no justice to "top-quality" cuts with little or no fat...they just leave them tough and dry.  Great for rainboots, bad for brisket! :-)

Got mixed reviews on this one.  Used 4 lb beef roast, smothered it with onions, followed remainder of recipe to a T....house smelled wonderful while it cooked, debated most of the day whether we'd eat it on deli buns with condiments of choice or make mashed potatoes and serve like roast.  Kids and I had it on buns-hubby had it on Amish Bread (from this site-wonderful BM bread) covered in gravy.  It needs more spice...maybe bay leaf while cooking or more garlic.  Don't know if I'll try it again.

Very simple, very tasty! I didn't make the gravy, just boiled some potatoes, carrots and celery to serve next to the brisket.

This recipe was totally awsome!  My husband who is a very picky eater loved it.  
It is easy to put together and would be a great easy recipe to put together on the way ot the door.  Come home and it is ready!  The house was filled with wonderful aromas.
Excellent meal.

This needs a lot more flavor. I let it sit in the crockpot overnight so it was nice and tender but it was also very bland. Next time I will make a seperate BBQ sauce or gravy for this.

I think I would make this again if I were able to get a brisket on sale.  My store doesnt always have them, and when they arent on sale they are a little pricey.  I cooked this about 8 hours and sliced the meat, but my husband and I both decided it needed a little more time.  I had already put the flour in the gravy, and we returned the meat to the crockpot.  I fell asleep and forgot about it, and he put it away later that evening.  When I tried it the next day, it was great.  Very tender, and the gravy was excellent!  I loved the gravy more than the meat.  LOL  Totally sopped it up with french bread.  I do like this recipe and might try it again, though I think I prefer the oven barbequed brisket found on this site a little better.

Pretty Good. It reminds me of corned beef. It is not something I would like all the time, but it was tasty. For the gravy, be careful not to add any salt. It does not need it.

WONDERFUL!!  My husband absolutely loved this recipe!  We even bought a pork shoulder and tried it..did everything exactly the same way and it was great too!!  It did lack a little salt..so I think using garlic salt may help out there.  But this is a definate keeper!!

This recipe was super-easy! I cooked it for 3 1/2 hours on high in my slow cooker (and then set it to low for another half-hour to hour) and it was perfect. However, it did lack a little in flavor. Next time, I will add some more spices or perhaps marinate the meat for a while first. But the tender, juicy meat more than makes up for the lessened flavor intensity.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband loved it.  A great meal that can be enjoyed for a couple of days.  First as a roast with mashed potatoes, then on sandwitches the next day.

This was a little tough and tasted a lot like regular ol' pot roast.  I was hoping for something with a little more flavor.  This is pretty good though, at least as far as pot roasts go.

Pretty good, although there are some other recipes here that have better flavor.  I followed some suggestions and used 1 full can of beef broth instead of water.  I also sauted the onion with some fresh garlic before putting it in the crockpot.  As always, I added some Cajun spice and a little red pepper flake to heat it up a little.  I think a little wine, or some vinegar might help break the meat down a little better.

The recipe says "it will be the tenderest brisket you ever tasted".  I discovered this is not the case.  Mine resulted in a real jaw breaker.  Perhaps 12 hours in the crock pot isn't enough.

This was my very first attempt at a brisket. It came out wonderfully in my slow cooker, except for one thing. I had to cut A LOT of fat off the top when it finished cooking. Is this normal, or was my brisket just very fatty?

Amazingly tender.  Wonderful taste.  I skip the gravy and serve it in its own juice or add bbq sauce.  This is the best crock pot recipe I've found.

This recipe changed my mind about corned beef! For years no matter who made it on St Patty's, it was always too tough for me to enjoy. After using this recipe, I will make brisket more often. It leaves the meat with a taste that commands you to eat more. Yummy!

The meat was very tender but in need of spices.  I'll try it again sometime and add more seasoning.

This was recipe was very easy to prepare and the gravy was tasty but lacked salt.  I needed to add more salt and had to cook the brisket for at least 12 hours before it was fork tender.  The next time I will use chuck roast and maybe add some gravy packet mix to the recipe.

My family loved it!  I couldn't believe how easier it was to make and the taste!  I used this on my in-laws, who are  picky on everything that isn't tender, and they gave raved reviews.  My young boys have asked if we could have it every week.  Thanks for making a great meal so easy!!!!!! - DSB - Col.

I put this in my crock pot for about 10-12 hours before it became really tender.  I also reheated it in the crock pot the next day and it was wonderful.  I added some melted cheese and banana peppers to the sandwich, it was GREAT!!  It would make a good winter meal!

The meat was so tender and the gravy was delicious. I served the brisket on sub rolls. My family loved it. I will make this recipe again.

Very, very easy to make, but I found the gravy a little sour and added 1/2 tsp sugar to it. (Maybe it was the ketchup - I used Heinz??)

I tried this recipe using the slow cooker and it was terrific.  The meat was fork tender and the gravy was delicious.
