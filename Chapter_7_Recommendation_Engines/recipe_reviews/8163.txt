AMALGAMATION is right!  Took an AMALGAMATION of ingredients!  :-)  I tried this the other day and it was WELL worth it!  Will have to make another, because I am going to take it to the Church dinner next Sunday.  Thanks!

I took this to my favorite charity's first ever CAKE AUCTION.People were bidding like crazy. The cake finally went for $51.25. I guess that says something about this fabulously unique and tasty treat! Thanks for sharing Glenda.

Really good fruity cake. More work than I usually like to put in (I'm seriously into one-pot cookery!). Icing too sweet for me but made it look really impressive. Well liked by everyone who tasted it.

I make this cake for Christmas every few years - it brings back memories of my grandmother who made a cake like this for Christmas, except it also had chopped dates in it. She mixed 1 cup each of dates, nuts, raisins, and coconut in her flour mixture. She always used her homemade blackberry jam in her cake - I also use blackberry jam. Very, very good, and very, very moist. And very, very time consuming but so worth it! I cut this very rich cake in thin slices with a serrated knife.
