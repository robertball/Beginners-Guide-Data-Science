This was okay. A little bland and dry. It definitely needed some more sauce. I'm not sure I'll make this one again.

I don't think this would be as tasty if I had not have made a couple of adjustments. I added peas in addition to the broccoli and used pancetta instead of regular bacon. I also cooked the chicken in the drippings from the pancetta. I then cooked the rice in a 1/4 cup of chicken broth, 1/4 cup of milk, and 1 1/2 cups of water.
