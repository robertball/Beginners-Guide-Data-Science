I love fried chicken wings & this is a pretty darn good recipe!!  I have a recipe somewhat similar to this one.  I use a mixture of 1/2 flour-1/2 panko bread crumbs, a few scrambled eggs seasoned with hot sauce, salt, pepper, garic powder.  Dip them in the egg mixture, then dredge them in the flour/crumbs.  Fry them up, and they come out super tasty, and super crispy!!  I serve half of them bare, and the other half I drizzle  with warmed honey spiked with some red pepper flakes.  Either way...you can't go wrong with wings!!!

Made for a good chicken dish, but wasn't overly impressed. To me the "breading" tasted exactly like pork Shake n Bake  seasoning.

This is simple as it gets and it couldn't be better!  The chicken skin was nice and crispy and the meat was juicy and tender.  Very good.  THX

I love this recipe b/c it's basic and I love to spruce it up! I like to dip the wings in honey bbq sauce. My husband prefers hot sauce with ranch dressing. I also make it with sweet and sour sauce. It's great.

These are very tasty wings! I prepared this recipe according to the directions. But instead of baking the chicken wings in the oven, instead I cooked them in a deep fryer.

These were pretty tasty. Made them for a party and they were a hit. Only reason I am rating 4 instead of 5 is I expected them to have a little more flavor considering how many spices are used.

These were great - I added a little pepper and Mrs. Dash spice and just dipped them in egg whites - not the whole egg, to save on some cals.
I made a dipping sauce with chili paste and plum sauce - it was delicious and crispy!

I used this recipe and instead of using chicken wings, I used 2 chicken breasts cut into peices, fried in a frying pan and in the last few minutes tossed in some sweet chili sauce & served over rice!

This was pretty good, nice and crispy. It could use a little more flavour though, I think i'll add salt & pepper next time, and increase the onion powder & garlic salt.
