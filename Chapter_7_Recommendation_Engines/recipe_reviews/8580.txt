Wow, I cant believe that 2 out of the 3 top reviews for this recipe are so negative!  I think the people who rated those reviews as "helpful" never even tried this recipe!  SHAME ON YOU!!!!  IT IS GREAT!    I prepared the recipe as recommended, but with chicken breasts.  And i have to say I totally loved it!  I was worried about such a short cooking time for the chicken, but it turned out just right.  And that splash of lemon at the end, incredible, dont leave it out!  Hope that you try this, you wont regret it!

This is the best fajitas recipe I have found.  I substituted about 1/2 T of lime (instead of the lemon) and added it to the marinade.  I also let the meat simmer in the juices - this makes sure that it won't be dry but juicy instead.

I thought the soy sauce in fajitas was a little strange but because of all the wonderful reviews I put my doubts aside.  I shouldn't have.  This was an odd tasting fajita.  Slightly oriental in flavor.  I'm from the Southwest and I've had a lot of good versions of fajitas.  These are not good.

The ingredients for this recipe seem odd for fajitas, but  the chicken is outstanding. I have used this recipe 3 times and the entire family loves it. I do not add the hot sauce, we don't have any, and I double the garlic, we love garlic.

I am doing a low carb diet, so I top a salad with the chicken and use tomato salsa as the dressing. It is full of flavor and very yummy. Greate recipe!

Hmmmmm.  I've been craving Mexican food for sometime now.  My honest opinion would be that these were not bad, but not great either.  In my opinion, and it IS just an opinion, the marinade would be much, much better if the oil & lemon juice were added to it.  I added my veges to the marinade as well.  With a lil doctoring, this is a 5, but I rate a 3 for a decent recipe.  No offense Teresa, mind you, this is just my opinion which may mean nothing to you others!  Thanks for posting!

I took the advice for 'more spice' and added some cumin, sirachen hot sauce, some cracked peppercorns, and a little bit of lime juice to the marinade.  This added just the right amount of spice to the dish.

I too, was sceptical about the worcestershire and soy sauce, but it does work; especially with the addition of the aforementioned spices.

These were delicious, but I made quite a few changes, we don't eat meat:  no chicken, I added about 3 portabello mushrooms caps (sliced), 1 zucchini, 1 yellow crook-necked squash, I used lime instead of lemon and I doubled the marinade (and didn't marinate the veggies, just added the marinade to the skillet).  Truly delicious.  We made burritos out of it, adding sour cream.

Excellent!!  I used it to marinade my thighs and then baked it all together!! We didn't have wraps so I just made black beans and rice and served with the chicken thighs.

The flavour of the marinade was incredible and you don't need to let it sit for a long period of time.

Really Good fajitas.  We did the 30 minute marinade and turned out fine.  As the submitter warned, the chicken will dry out if overcooked, which we slightly did by accident.  To remedy this minor dilema (it really wasn't too bad), we melted some cheese over all and topped with sour cream.  I will make again and just be more careful.

Like many others, I was doubtful when I read through the ingredient list. But, if you follow the recipe, you don't end up with an Asian flavor for the marinade. The saltiness of the soy sauce blends with the sourness of the vinegar. The Worchestershire sauce adds a smoky flavor. Trust the positive reviews; all the flavors blend together! In addition to the lemon juice, I added a bit of lime juice to finish it off. I think next time I might add some fresh cilantro to the marinade as well

Wow! Fantastic recipe. I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours in the fridge and then cooked it (marinade and all) in a pan. I stir fried onions and green peppers first and then added the chicken+marinade. I cooked it on a low flame on about 20-30 mins and the chicken was oh-so-succulent and flavorful. 
(Only change is that I added about 4 cloves of garlic)
Will definitely be making this again.

I like this recipe. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I made it I used some pointers by other people. I added juice of 1 lime in the marinade. I also added a teaspoon of cumin and 1 tablespoon of Texas Pete's Hot Sauce. I'm sure I'll use this recipe again.

I just made these and they're wonderful.  I gave it only 4 because I had to tweak it a bit.  I used ckicken Breasts instead of thighs. Cut the chili powder back to 3/4 teaspoon. Add a teaspoon of brown sugar to marinade. I marinaded for about 3 hours and dumped the whole mixture into the skillet.  Sprinkle it with a little regular sugar, salt and pepper when you only have a minute or two go.  I left the lemon and hot sauce out.  Served with mashed avocado, tomatoes, shredded cheddar, sour cream, and salsa on the best authentic flour tortillas from a local place here in Phoenix. My husband, teenagers and 2 year old ate them up.  I will definitely make it again.

You know, anyone willing to share their recipe is a brave and kind soul. Teresa, thank you for posting this fajita recipe. I found it to be a bit bland. I definitely had to dress it up with some sour cream and salsa. Like another reviewer, I added cumin for some added depth. Instead of hot sauce, I used 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. Thank you again Teresa!

Loved these!  Used chicken breasts instead of thighs and added some red pepper, which made it nice and colourful. Served in a whole wheat pita with cheese, sour cream and salsa. Great for a weeknight meal!

YUMMY!! I used chicken breast and a sirlion steak to make it a combo for guests.  I also added cilantro and substituted lemon for lime juice. I never would have thought to use the ingredients though to make the base.  I will use this again and again and again.  My dinner guest also left with the recipe.

VERY unique - I briefly skimmed a few reviews and read things about how it wasn't like your typical Mexican fajitas you get at a chain or local restaurants. It's true. It's different, but we enjoyed it. It's the kind of food you eat a little more slowly, enjoying each unique bite...flavors you hadn't combined before, mingling in your mouth...I can't say this will be up there on the list to make again and I wouldn't serve it up to guests as "fajitas" but it's always fun to try something new!

I went with the other reviews and added lemon and lime juice, cayenne pepper, and chilli powder. I made additional marinade and cut the peppers (green, red and yellow, onions and chicken (cut in strips) into a covererd bowl with the marinade for several hours (shaking the marinade around occasionally.) I pan fried the peppers, onions, and chicken for quite awhile on low until the juices evaporated. My boyfriend and friends raved about this meal and want to know when I will make it again.

This is an easy and tasty recipe! I substituted white wine vinegar for the cider vinegar(didn't have any), and I used a combination of chicken thighs and breast tenders. I also used different color bell peppers-red, green and yellow. Yummy with avocado, sour cream, salsa, cheddar cheese, and flour tortillas with refried beans on the side.

Pretty good! Needs more spice so will add a few more dashes of pepper sauce. Also won't use yellow pepper as it adds a sweetness. Added mushrooms to the mixture!  Will try Monterey cheese instead of Cheddar next time too.

We thought these were very good. So easy to get dinner on the table with this recipe as well. I had prepared everything ahead of time and when dinner rolled around we had these ready to eat within 10 minutes. However, I do think this recipe is best suited to a variety of sweet peppers rather than the green only, and I would use lime juice rather than lemon next time.

I'm from Texas and although this chicken recipe is flavorful by itself and I might make it as a chicken entree. It does not taste like any real fajita meat I have ever eaten.  I usually eat fajitas here in Texas about 2 to 3 times a month and I have eaten beef and chicken fajitas from all over south and southeast Texas for over 35 years.  I’ve never eaten any that tasted like this.  Please do not get me wrong. I like the flavor of this marinated chicken recipe but it is definitely not what I consider fajita meat.

I usually try a recipe as written the first time, as was the case here. Sorry Teresa but we found these quite bland and will continue to look for the 'homerun' recipe. Not bad - just so so. Thanks anyway.

This is one of favorite our go-to meals.  Excellent flavor.  I marinate everything together and cook it up until the liquid has evaporated.  Only real change is that I use lime instead of lemon...seems more fajita-y!

This marinade is on the sweet side. If you don't mind sweet-tasting fajitas, you may like this. I was looking for more of a southwestern fajita marinade.

I followed the recipe exactly, and as it was cooking my daughter came in the kitchen and asked if we were having meatloaf for dinner.  We tried it and it wasn't spicy at all, had to add cumin and cayenne pepper.   No problem with the chicken drying out like other reviewers did.

Not only is this recipe an alternative to the "boxed" dinners, its 10 times yummier and MUCH cheaper!
This is an impressive dinner for company, and so easy, too. I made a double batch of the marinade, and marinated the veggies in a different container then the chicken...I will continue to do this. I didn't have any lemon on hand, and while the fajitas were great without it, they would be even better WITH.
Next time I make these, I will substiture steak for the chicken and lime for the lemon.

Amazing! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe, preparing and eating it! We took the advice of previous reviews, and used chicken breasts, as well as  combined all the ingredients into the marinade. We also doubled the amount of everything, for a more thorough coating, and it didn't detract from the flavor at all! Again, at the advice of others, we added our veggies (red and green bell pepper, onion, and jalapeño) to the marinade as well, and the result was delicious. Because of our doubling, though, we found the product a bit wet, and had to drain off liquid- but the chicken was tender and moist!

The cooking directions are perfect.  I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours but we still found it bland.  Next time will need to add more spices.  Certainly didnt taste oriental so dont worry about that.

The marinade is great, my only change was to reduce the chili powder for the kiddos and to use chicken breasts, not thighs.  I grilled the chicken on the BBQ along with the peppers (which I had drizzled with olive oil & salt/pepper).  Very good and will definitely make again!

Hubby thought this was all right, but I liked it much better than any "fajita seasonings" packet that I've ever purchased and mixed in with my chicken and veggies. Flavor was more subdued and yet more pervasive, having marinated for a while. Chicken was juicy. Changes: added 1 tsp cumin; included green and red bell peppers, instead of just green, and skipped the lemon juice.

Excellent.  Made marinade as written, but did not marinate.  Just cooked the meat and veggies in it.  Also substituted red, yellow & orange peppers for the green pepper.

I followed the ingredients exactly but cooked my veggies under a broiler instead of in the pan. I like my peppers and onions with bit of a charred taste. The flavor of the chicken was good but different. Not exactly what your  traditional fajitas taste like but still tasty. I let it sit overnight. I will probably make this again but possible grill the chicken instead.

Awesome recipe! I used this recipe for a party and recieved rave reviews -- and every last bit of chicken was eaten with not a scrap of leftovers. I prefer white meat, so I used chicken breasts. I marinated them for several hours starting in the morning, and then cooked them on our gas grill when the party started that evening.  The chicken breasts cooked quickly on the grill.   Wonderful flavor! I sliced them into strips after grilling.  they were a huge hit at our party. I will absolutely use this recipe again!

GREAT!!!  My family of 5 devoured it!!!  I used just over 2lbs of chicken and doubled the marinade recipe as others suggested.  I also added 2 tsp of cumin and put the lemon in the marinade.  Just becuz I love citrus, I squeezed 1/2 a lime on the chicken at the very end too.  YUM YUM YUM!!!!  If you want to add even more flavor to this, pound the chicken breasts out with a meat tenderizer, marinade and grill on the bbq.  OH YEAH!!!!  Tenderizing the chicken helps the chicken from drying out on the bbq!  A family favorite!!!!!

Great just as written.  The only thing I did differently was make it with a little less chicken and added another pepper.  Ounce for ounce it was the about the same as written though.  Delicious!

This tasted sooo good, but it really isn't my idea of a southwestern fajita just something really good and really different. I substituted roasted peppers for the bell pepper and omitted the soy sauce and my husband loved it.

This is an amazing-tasting fajita recipe. I tried making fajitas on my own without a recipe, and they came out OK, but this recipe is top-notch. I used the chicken breast meat instead of the thighs, because I like that better. I did not overcook them, so the meat came out moist and juicy. Fabulous!

I really enjoyed this recipe. However, after making it the first time according to directions, I doctored it a bit to suit our tastes. I doubled the garlic, subbed lime juice for lemon, doubled the lime juice and added it to the marinade, doubled/tripled the hot sauce (we like spicy!), added cumin and onion powder (about 1/2 tsp each) and a splash of liquid smoke. It was yummy to begin with - and then, perfect for my boyfriend and me!

This was quite tasty.  I added some lime juice, cilantro, and cumin to the marinade and let the chicken marinate for about 6 hours.  All I had were red bell peppers so that's what I used, and I liked the color they gave the dish better than the green.  I seared the peppers and onions on high heat and then removed them from the pan. Then I dumped the chicken strips and the marinade into the skillet and let it cook until it got really nice and thick and then added back the onions and peppers along with a few red chile flakes for some heat.  I didn't use the lemon juice; it just didn't appeal to me.  Served this with corn tortillas (fewer weight watcher points than flour) and a nice roasted corn, black bean and mango salad from another site.  We liked it very much and DH had the leftovers for dinner whilst I was working.  Thanks for the post, Teresa!

Easy to make and taste good.  I marinated only 30 min.  After adding some vegitables etc.  it was underseasoned so I made more sauxe and added into the chicken/veggie mixuture.  I think I'll make sure to marinate either for hours or over a night next time.

I love this recipe! I have made it different ways, with/with lemon juice or hot sauce, i have also just cooked chicken breast right in the ingredients(minus the oil) if i didnt have time to marinate. Very tasty with sour cream or mexican white cheese dip poured on. I even serve this over tostidos scoops and pour on cheese dip! Perfect for nachos!

fantastic!! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, marinated in ziploc baggie at room temp for at least 30 min. I added black pepper, cayanne pepper and cumin to the marinade. Used orange & yellow bell peppers and a whole onion. These are sooooo gooood. First time I did not marinate and they were kind of blah, 2nd time I marinated and it really makes a huge difference. Skipped the lemon juice, didn't need it. keeper for sure!

I made these fajitas for Superbowl Sunday and everyone loved them. I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours, and I know this is crazy but the only vinegar I had was balsamic so I just added that. I also added half a teaspoon of cumin, and I used both red and green peppers. The chicken turned out very tender, my husband actually got up and ate the leftovers for breakfast!

This is the first time EVER we've run out of fajita fillings...and this recipe uses 1½ pounds of chicken instead of the standard 1 pound! These were really great!!! Even my hubby commented...these are really good tonight. Thaat's when I told him that they weren't the packaged type, but homemade!

We loved this recipe!  I did add some dried cilantro and ground cumin (about 1/2 tsp each) and put the lemon juice in the marinade instead of waiting right before it was served.  I also used boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  This is definitely restaurant quality dining!

We've made this several times and love them. I leave out the hot sauce, because it bothers my stomach, but they're still great. I also like to throw in some sliced and seeded roma tomatoes for the last minute or two of cooking.

I thought these were really good, especially for how low fat they are.  I also used chicken breast, and I didn't have hot sauce, so I used a few red pepper flakes...you could definately still taste the bite.  I doubled the sauce thinking I would need it (I am a sauce person) but it was a mistake.  There was plenty to marinate the chicken without doubling it.  The result was the sauce was running out of the bottom of the fajita.  It wasn't a taste issue, but a messy issue and not necessary.  Definately a keeper. Thanks for posting!

Excellent recipe.  My whole family enjoyed it and we printed it out for future use. I made two changes:  1) Instead of cooking the chicken for 5 minutes then adding the veggies, I cooked the veggies for 10 minutes first then added the chicken and cooked for an additional 7 minutes.  We prefer the veggies less crispy and it came out delicious.   2) Instead of chili powder, I used chipotle chili powder which added a smoky note to the dish.  Highly recommend doing this if you like the chipotle flavor.  The overall flavor of the chicken was great - it's a good marinade.  Would definitely make this again, and would add more peppers and onions next time.

Absolutely delicious.  I made these for my firehouse and they sucked it down in like 10 minutes.  One of the best chicken recipes I have ever made.

I decided to try this even though some of the ingredients are not "traditional" Southwest.  My whole family loved these especially my hubby and my 8 y.o.  They are scrumptious!  My chicken marinated approximately 8 hours.  The chicken turned out very flavorful and moist.  None of my family thought the soy sauce was overwhelming.  It gave a nice salty flavor to the meat.  My veggies came out perfectly crisp tender.  We served these in warm flour tortillas with sour cream and salsa.  Definitely will try again.

The marinade was very good but I ended up adding a few touches to make it more authentically Mexican: 1 t. cumin, 1 t. paprika, 1/4 cup of chicken stock (the sauteeing for 5 min. dried too much the chicken) and I did add at the time of serving some chopped cilantro. Otherwise, the marinade is surprisingly good!  Thank you for the recipe!

I have been making these for so long and can't believe I forgot to rate it. I make the marinade as is, except in addition to chili powder I add cayenne. To save fat and calories I cook the chicken in a pan sprayed with Pam, and sautee the veggies in the remaining marinade and a little chicken broth. This way this dish is so healthy. We think it's absolutely delicious.

Excellent. Just the right amount of spice, and a very healthy meal. I added all of the marinade to the pan with the chicken, and I also cooked the chicken completely and removed it before adding the veggies. I found it was very good with a red bell pepper, too. Thanks for a great dish!

This recipe was wonderful and versatile.  My husband & I didn't have any fresh chicken on hand, so we decided to try it with canned white meat chicken.  It was excellent.  Rinsed the chicken off first and after marinating, put the chicken and the veggies into the skillet at the same time so as to not dry out the already cooked chicken.  Served it with taco flavored rice and Paul Newman's Peach Salsa.  Excellent!  I know it will be even better (somehow) with fresh chicken.  Thanks for the recipe Teresa!

Made twice. 2nd time, I did use breasts which I think works better.  Also spiced it up a bit more: added more garlic, a sliced jalepeno and a red pepper.  Was also great as leftovers next day to have a fajita salad!

I marinated chicken & grilled it. Very nice mild flavor. I also added some McCormick fajita seasoning. I will use this marinade from now on instead of the bottled marinade I had been using.

These were great! Perfect seasoned taste! I have always used a packet of fajita seasoning mix before, but never will again.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into strips and marinated them all day while I was at work.  They came out awesome.  Thanks for the recipe Teresa!

All I can say is...excellent! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into strips, and I made 2 batches of the marinade. One for the chicken, and one for my onions and peppers. I also added 1 chopped jalepeno pepper to the mix and some ground red pepper to kick it up (we like it hot!) It tasted SO good and my husband can't quit raving about it. Said it was the best he's had! Try it, you'll be glad you did!

I made this for my fiancee and his cousin.  Those boys gobbled it down!  I added a little fresh cilantro to give it a little extra kick!  I also used the chicken breasts and while the chicken and veggies were simmering together, I added more worchestshire sauce and a little extra chilli powder.  I added the lemon juice at the end and cooked it for just a few seconds to get the flavor to go through.  It was awesome!

Excellent!  Even better if you flatten the chicken to a 1/2" thickness first, and lessen the cooking time.  I was also out of lemons and limes so I just used 3 TBS of Jose Cuervo Non-Alcoholic Margarita Mix!  Added a nice tang!  Yummy!

This recipe was very flavorfull.  However, I find the instructed cooking time too long.  I only cooked the chicken and vegi a total of 5 minutes instead of 8 and chicken was still a little bit dry.  Next time I make it I will try to cook the chicken and vegi separately to ensure tenderness.

The first time I followed the recipe to a T and the chicken just stewed in all the juices even though I made a big point of squeezing off as much marinade as possible.  The slight Asian taste didn't seem quite right either but still was an okay dish.  Today I cooked the peppers and onion in a little oil until lightly blackened and then set aside.  Then, instead of using the marinade, I made a dry rub out of cumin, chili powder, paprika, lemon pepper and garlic powder.  I sprinkled it over the chicken and then cooked for about 5 minutes on high in a screaming hot pan.  After turning off the heat I added a splash of worcestjre and squeezed 1/2 of a lemon over the chicken along with a light sprinkling of seasoning salt.  It was a much better result.  Don't forget the lemon juice in the end--it's key.  Very good.

One of the best fajita recipe's I've tried so far.

I did add a few extra things into mine, since we like it hot, I added crushed red pepper, plus a few extra drops of hot sauce. In addition, I added 1/2 tablespoon extra of chili powder to help hide the soy sauce. I also added 1/4 tablespoon of cumin to bring out the South American flavor.

When sauteing the peppers and onions, I added about 1/4 tablespoon each of parsley and oregano to bring out the zest of the ingredients.

I used a large non-stick wok (on high heat) and it turned out really great! 

It is missing a little salt, so be weary of that when you make it, it definitely needs it (in my opinion).

We're a little spicy here so I added a little more hot sauce and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. My family loved the fajitas!  They were better than the ones we had at a restaurant this past week!  I will never order fajitas out again!

This recipe was fantastic!  I modified it by leaving out the lemon juice and added a 1/2 can of pineapple tidbits.  I like spicy food so I also kicked up the heat quite a bit.  While eating, the sweet pineapple gives a surprise of sweet with each spicy bite.

YUM! I doubled the recipe to make these for my boyfriend, mom, and brother last night, and we finished them! I had never made homemade fajitas before, and these were incredible. The only modifications I made were adding a dash of cayenne pepper and a little more worcestershire sauce than called for. When the veggies were cooking with the meat I added a minced jalapeno (seeds included) for a some extra spice. Served this with homemade flour tortillas and I guarantee, this could have competed with the Mexican restaurant down the street.

I wasn't sure about the ingredients, but this was actually quite good. I was missing some flavor, but I think that's mostly because I should have let it marinate longer than 30 minutes, and I forgot the lemon juice at the end. I'll try those next time, and that may tip it from pretty good to great. I used 1 lb chicken and removed from skillet to cook the veggies (1 red+1 green pepper + 1 onion), and tossed the chicken back in at the end - the amount of sauce was perfect.

Very good!  Followed the recipe, except for using frozen chicken breasts.  I cooked the chicken in the marinade and then removed chicken and poured off juices before cooking the veggies.  Added the chicken at the end, also added some frozen (but pre-heated) corn.

These were easy and delicious. I did add a 1/2 t. of cumin as another reviewer suggested and I also added the oil and lime juice into the marinade. They turned out amazing! Kids loved them too! Served them with spanish rice, sauteed onions and peppers and all the toppings of fajitas!

I printed this recipe off a long time ago and digging through the recipe box looking for something new to make, I stumbled upon it again!  Wish I had made this a long time ago!!! Delicious!  My only changes/additions were, I used chicken breasts, added a tsp. of cumin (because I love it so), substituted lime for the lemon and added some fresh mushrooms. I will definitely be making this again!!!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

The best thing about this whole recipe is that it is QUICK!  20-25 minutes maybe (aside from the marinating) to throw together.  Perfect for a quick, reasonably healthy weeknight meal!

That being said - I think next time I'd play with the marinade.  Maybe minus the soy sauce and add some lime juice and little more spice.  But it's a perfectly serviceable base to work from and make it your own!  Thanks for sharing!

Our family really enjoyed this meal. When my husband came home from work, he said it smelled very strong (the vinegar) but when he ate it, he really liked the flavors and said it didn't taste too strong. We'll definitely be making this instead of using the store-bought package of fajita flavoring.

I did use chicken breast instead of thighs and marinated most the day in a ziplock in refrigerator. I did add some cumin and black pepper to the marinade and glad I did, I think it would have lacked the Mexican flavor without it. Served with Black Beans with Pico de Gallo on AR and guacamole.

Sorry, these flavors do not work for me in a Mexican fajita.  I agree with the reviewer who said it smelled like meat loaf--and a bad one at that.  There are much better taco and fajita recipes on this site.

My boyfriend says this is the best fajitas he's ever tasted! The combo in the marinade may sound bizarre, but it is very, very good! Made a side dish of black bean, avocado, tomato, corn salad to go with it.

These were good, I wouldn't call them outstanding.  I used boneless, skinless breasts and didn't have a problem with them drying out even though I had to cook them for much longer than called for to soften the veggies and get the chicken cooked through.  I added a scant tablespoon of soy sauce to the marinade, as some people seemed to find it weird, but it was fine in this.  I did however, add cumin to my skillet while cooking, because on it's own, the flavor was a little bland.  I also went ahead and added the oil and lemon juice to the marinade, which was nice, and sprinkled lime juice on the finished chicken.  All in all, this was nice at home, and even the kids seemed to like it, but I wasn't "wowed" enough to make again.  If I'd gotten this at a restaurant, I think I would have been disappointed.

Easy, tasty, and particularly good on the second day.  My husband would not stop raving about these, claiming they were better than one of the top Mexican restaurants in town.  I'm making them again tonight.  I used red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar as it's what I had on hand.  Also, chili seeds instead of hot sauce.  It comes out mild enough for my kids to eat.  We spice it up with some nice hot salsa!

I was in a rush to make dinner and grabbed the first fajitas recipe that looked good. I used pre-cooked chicken strips (because of a time issue) and heated them in a pan with what would have been the marinade plus some cumin, along with the onion and sliced RED bell pepper. Turned out pretty good, though I bet they'd be even better if the chicken was actually marinated!

With the addition of onion and garlic powders and a bit of cumin, this dish was fabulous Teresa! I marinated the chicken overnight and at the last minute decided to make it even heartier by adding in sauteed potatoes. My S.O. loved this dish and ate three giant sized tortillas! Thank you so much!

Simple, unscrew-up-able fajitas.  I used half boneless skinless breasts and half thigh meat (fresh).  I followed the directions almost exactly except omitted the hot sauce for the children (used Red Wine vinegar since we had no apple cider vinegar).  The end result were very savory, flavorful fajitas.  You could taste every ingredient, especially the mellow onion.  Huge surprise hit, even with two young first time fajita eaters.

I doubled the marinade to be sure I had enough to cover the chicken, then let the chicken simmer in the marinate. Fantastic! The onions and peppers were restaurant quality and made a great dinner!

Good starter recipe. After tasting it the way it was written I decided it was missing something.  With the addition of a few more ingredients it is soooo much better.  Add cumin, dried or fresh cilantro, and chipotle powder(all to taste) and you will be amazed at the difference.

I'm not a huge fan of fajitas, but I really liked these as did the rest of the family.  I used red, orange, and yellow peppers instead of green because that is what we had and I think I probably liked it better that way.  I also didn't have any cider vinegar on hand so I added just a dash of red wine vinegar.  The marinade was surprisingly good.

I tried this tonight and we all really liked it. I forgot the juice at the end and would have loved it with lime juice instead of lemon.  A few reviewers did not like the soy sauce, I can understand that. I liked it, but you could just leave it out. I would suggest using lime juice instead of soy sauce.  I also cooked all the meat first (with the marinade), took it out of the pan and put the veggies in alone. I did use red peppers because that's what we had on hand.   It's quick and easy and turned out great!

Fajitas are one of my husband's and my favorite entrees to order when going out to eat.  At home, I could never match the tastiness though with the packaged fajita mix or using a variety of other recipes.  My husband had come to the conclusion that there was no way to make tasty fajitas at home.  Then I found this recipe.  YUMMY!  It's a keeper and one that will be used at least once a month in this household.

Good recipe a little bit of flavor but not super spicy. Tasted great and could feed to the little one without worrying about it being too hot. Will be using this easy recipe again.

The fajitas had terrific flavor and were easy to make. I made the recipe as is, but left out the bell pepper.  I marinated the chicken for about a half hour, and it turned out great. When I cooked the chicken, I added a little of the marinating liquid to reduce in the skillet.  We served it with warm corn tortillas and bottled green tomatillo salsa. Delicious!

This was exactly what I was looking for. I added an extra clove of garlic, some cayenne pepper, and the lemon juice to the marinade and left it overnight. I served as suggested on warmed (almost crisp) tortillas with salsa on the side. Husband told me it is the best chicken dish I have made so far, and it was so easy and quick. Thanks so much for sharing.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I am a vegetarian and can't say I tasted them; however, I made this recipe for my husband who eats meat and his first reaction was "these are gooooooood!".  My  opinon: They are very easy to make it and apparently quite tasty. The recipe works with steak fajitas as well, once again my husband loves this one.

Different. I think the tomatoes, cilantro, and Mexican cheese we added were the only things that saved these fajitas for us.

Delicious fajitas!  I marinated the cut-up chicken breast separate from the onions and peppers overnight.  We used a red and a yellow pepper instead of the green pepper.  I will definitely make these again!

This is a simple, quick, yet tasty recipe that most people would have the ingredients right on hand. Is it gourmet food?  No.  I don't think it was meant to be. I did not notice any "oriental taste" as others had noted.  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs, added an extra clove of garlic, and about 1/2 tsp of cumin to the marinade--otherwise made and cooked it exactly as stated.  Served with salsa and fat free sour cream on the side.   My husband ate about 3/4 of the entire recipe, and asked that I keep it in the rotation...which I'm happy to do!  (To reduce calories, I usually serve fajitas over shredded lettuce instead of with tortillas.)

These were so easy to make and had great flavor. Next time however I think I will kick up the spice/heat a bit more. They were a bit tame for my taste, but my GF loved them.

Wow these were excellent and healthy.  I think they were better than the ones I order at a restaurant I frequent.  I too thought that the soy sauce would taste weird but it was great.  I also added some cajun spice, some tumeric (because it is healthy), and some seasoning spice (no msg), and some extra garlic and chili powder.  There is no need to double the "sauce" for 1.5 pounds of chicken.  I think it would turn out soggy.  I made spanish rice to serve with this.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe...I will def make this again!!

my family thought this marinade had a really great taste.  I did make a few changes, no soy sauce, sub balsamic for cider vinegar, lime for lemon juice and added cilantro.  I didn't cut the chicken into strips until I took it off the grill.  Definitely a keeper!

These Fajitas were delicious.  Changes were minimal.  Used chicken breast, garlic powder because that was all I had on hand and my chili powder was smoked flavored and of coarse extra few dashes of hot sauce.  Toped it with sour cream and served it with fried rice.  Great, easy and fast meal

Tasty and easy.  I used 2.5 lbs of chicken breast and doubled the sauce (used the lemon juice in the marinade).  Cooking times were spot on.  Served with salsa and sour cream on top of jasmine rice.

Definitely marinate the chicken for a few hours. This recipe is awesome. The only thing I did differently was I used seasoned chicken fajita strips and I added the lime juice to my marinade. Otherwise, excellent flavor. My guy and I loved it! Update: I've made these several times now, and it does taste better with boneless skinless chix breasts cut into strips. But I like the easy way out sometimes, prepared chix strips! :)

Very, very, very good fajitas! Very easy to make as well. I marinaded these and grilled them and they were amazing! Hubby said he doesn't have to get fajitas from Chili's anymore... ;o) I didn't have a problem w/ the soy sauce at all. I used low sodium and found the chicken to be seasoned perfectly. Most chain resturants use soy sauce in their marinades as well. So if you like Chili's or Hard Rock Cafe's fajitas, you'll like these. This is in the monthly rotation from now on.

The chicken was so delicious!  I cooked the chicken and the veggies on a gas grill - what a hit!

I made this for the first time tonight and I almost never make fajitas but I am going to make these more often. This was very good. I added more chili powder like others had suggested. However I added chipole chili powder as my added ingredient and some fresh groung pepper. Thanks for another great recipe.

The combo of soy sauce & worch. didn't seem very mexican to me. So I marinated my chicken in taco sauce, lime, and cilantro, garlic, hot pepper. Tasted Great.

Great recipe!  I live in San Antonio so fajitas are a common dish.  That said, my husband's grandmother told me that she normally doesn't like chicken fajitas (too dry), but that these were moist and perfectly seasoned.  We prepared both beef and chicken fajitas and these were gone at the end of the party.  Chicken thighs are definitely the secret to tender, flavorful fajitas.  Well definitely make again! Thank you!

Yummy!  I doubled the amount of marinade, and cooked the chicken in the sauce, so it was nice and juicy.  Great combination of spices.

These were better than any fajita mix I have had from the grocery store :) - I did follow the advice of others and add the lemon juice to the marinade for the chicken, using boneless skinless chicken breasts. I let the chicken marinate all day, as opposed to 30 minutes. I also substituted ground cumin and paprika for the chili powder (I didn't have any at the time). I served the fajitas with pico de gallo (recipe from this site), cheddar cheese, and sour cream. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Oh my gosh, these are so good!  I am completely amazed by how easy and tasty this recipe was!  One of the best things about is that all the ingredients are things I have in my house anyways, and it is really super easy.  My husband and I both loved them and I will defiantly be making them again!  Highly Recommended!

"Pollo Fajitas" makes them sound far more authentic, than they really are...although I believe the proper name would be "Fajitas de Pollo".

Quite honestly some of the worst fajitas I have ever had. Not sure how this recipe earned such a high rating, but I thought it was awful. I agree with the person that stated they have had good fajitas, and these are definately not it. They were bland and pretty much tasteless. Only way to "save" them is to pile on the toppings.

In order to prevent the chicken from drying out, I marinated whole boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and then sliced them AFTER cooking them.  The meat was moist and delicious!  And I just put in the bell pepper and onion about half way through.  It all came out fine.

GREAT TASTE!!!!!
I fried the onions and peppers first
because I like mine cooked really well.
Other than that, I followed the recipe
exactly, and it was a BIG HIT at our 
house.  Better than most restaurants!!!

We have used this recipe numerous times on a much larger scale (65 servings). We made the honest mistake of adding the lemon juice to the marinade and it worked so well we continue this method ;) Also, we didn't realize we were out of hot sauce once so we adlibbed with cayenne pepper and it still turned out great! You can also used store bought minced garlic instead of fresh if you don't have any, as well as 100% concentrate lemon juice. We ALWAYS marinate overnight and we consistently get asked to make this recipe :) We serve ours, topped with Mexican cheese blend, (home made) salsa and sour cream & a side of arroz con gondules.

This was good! I didn't find it outstanding on it's own, but definitely good.
I'm in agreeance with the rest of the reviews that say it's not very Mexican on its own, but I made and served it with the Pico de Gallo [added lime and more cilantro to the latter recipe] and it made the entire dish phenomenal!
I've added both to my personal recipe book: this is the sign of a winning recipe.

Thanks!

This was amazing! 
As most, I made a few changes:
1) Used chicken breast (2, boneless, skinless)
2) Used 1tbsp Siracha (the asian rooster sauce) instead of Cider Vinegar and Chili Powder
3) Added 1/4 tsp of Cumin
4) Added 1/4 tsp Chili Pepper Flakes
5) Added tsp of Paprika (sort of just threw it in until things looked to my liking)
6) Used 5 medium sized garlic cloves
7) Added just a sprinkling of salt and pepper

For the veggies, I fried up the onions and green peppers a bit. It looked plain, and peppers were under cooked. So I added about 1/4 cup of water with 1/4 tsp of paprika (so the water was red) to the pan while frying. Sprinkled salt and pepper while cooking. 

For the tortillas, I put them in a pan and warmed them (blackened them a little bit). 

I'm mainly writing this so I don't forget the changes I made!!! LOVVVVVVVED this; we ate it ALL that night - using the excuse that there wasn't enough left to "save" anyway. So good.

This was pretty good, and after tasting the marinade, I figured out that the sweet taste other reviewers mentioned was actually from the  Worcestershire sauce.  I was going to make this exactly as the recipe stated, but after reading reviews and tasting, I tweaked it a little.  I left out the hot sauce and added 1 tsp. smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp. adobo seasoning.  I squeezed half a lime over the finished dish before serving.  This had a nice little heat, but I still tasted the Worcestershire.  Next time, I will use less.

I had high hopes because of the high rating, despite the fact that soy sauce was one of the ingredients which is odd for a Mexican dish.   My family & I were very disappointed. I won't be using this recipe again.

Pollo Fajitas' Haiku: "Marinade is good. Didn't jive with fajitas. On own though, it's fine." Followed the recipe exactly as written, and we weren't thrilled w/ what the soy/worc. flavor did to fajitas; however, some of the leftover chicken was great over a basic green salad, so the marinade on its own for chicken is good, but when dressed up and served fajita-style, my mouth didn't sense any fiesta-fajita-flavor.

I decided to give this recipe a try and I'm glad I did, I can have my own opinion now. The chicken lacked flavor, it was just sour and nothing more. Also, it did not look appealing. Will not make again, do not recommend.

Although the chicken came out very moist, it was overpowered by the seasonings.

I used cooked shrimp in this recipe. Added them in at the end. Also cooked some mushrooms with the onion mixture. Also added the juice of the other lime half at the end. Deeeelicious!

Pounded chicken breasts flat, cut into strips. Followed ingredients except added more garlic and added everything but onions, pepper and oil and marinated for 3 hours. Very good flavor, but think I would like the chicken grilled for better color.

This recipe magically popped into my e-mail right when I was wondering what I could make with some chicken thighs. The ingredients are simple and were on hand. Prep was fast and easy. It'll never be as good as grilled fajitas, but it was quite tasty.

My family loved this. I made a double recipe and served with black beans hoping it would go farther, and we still had no leftovers! May have gone a bit heavy on the "dash" of hot pepper sauce—husband, son and I loved it; my parents thought it was a bit much. I have a habit of making the same meal a little differently each time, but my husband insisted I save this one so I could replicate it!

If I could, I would give this 4.5 stars.  Really good flavor and cooked up perfectly.  I might try adding some spices next time, hence not 5 stars, but still delicious as it was.

This recipe was delicious and simple.  We tried it with steak and shrimp and the marinade worked beautifully with both.  So easy and unbelievably good.  A new top pic in our household.

Been making this exact recipe for YEARS...got it for the Los Angeles Times.   Always a crowd pleaser, and if you think it will taste oriental, you probably get your Chinese food at Señor Juan's Taco Shed...try the mu shu enchiladas!

I thought these were really good and they were easy to put together. The chicken stayed moist. I marinated the peppers and onions along with the chicken. I will definitely make these again.

These are phenomenal - taste just like what you'd order at a Mexican restaurant.  I poured the chicken and marinade into the pan together and had the sizzling effect.  Tasted awesome.

Made this because of the high rating even though the list of ingredients sounded strange.  I was joking with my husband we were having Asian-fusion Fajitas for dinner.  They turned out really tender and delicious.  Will add a bit more hot sauce or chili powder next time and maybe some Adobo.  But, still a keeper recipe.

Was very good. Nice flavor. I added the veggies to the marinade, doubled the ingredients and added half a lime's juice, plus a little paprika and red pepper.

My fiance and I both absolutely loved this!  I doubled the amount of marinade and let the chicken sit in it for about 45 minutes.  While the chicken was cooking I used the remainder of the marinade on the vegetables.  I served it with Spanish Rice II and it was to die for.

This was very good!  My boyfriend loved it and so did I.  It had just the right amount of seasoning. It was a very clean tasting dish. the only changes i made were I added a dash of llime juice to the marinade itself, did not use lemon, and added red peppers

The more I make this dish, the more I like it. Very easy to make and delicious! The only ingredient I switched out is the cider vinegar. I never have that in my kitchen, so I used balsamic vinegar instead. Still really good.

I just love this recipe.  I've made it as is countless times.  I've also taken it to the crock pot for chicken tacos in the winter with fabulous results.  I just add the frozen chicken breasts with a cup of chicken stock and let it cook all day, when I get home I remove any fat, shred the chicken then add the marinade ingredients and cook until dinner time.  So good!  Thank you for sharing!

This is great recipe. The ingredients intrigued me. I also added more spices.  I tripled the recipe as I was making a large amount of chicken.  I used 4 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp corriander. This is a great marinade. I will definitely make this again.  My whole family loved it.

I made this the other night...I was worried about my family liking it because it seems so strange to use the ingredients listed for Fajitas...but it was great...I too used chicken breast...and it turned out fine...I will defiantly make this again... :)

They were great.  I didn't have any hot sauce, so I simply added a small amount from a taco seasoning packet, it was delightful. We both loved them

The only things I changed: use chicken breasts, omit the hot pepper sauce, and add one Tbs. fresh squeezed lime juice to the marinade instead of lemon.  The flavor was just perfect and made a great filling for fajitas!  Will be making again.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe!  We've never ventured into fajitas before and this was a wonderful introduction.  Incredibly easy to make, great flavor and it made just enough for our family of four.  We left out the hot pepper sauce and halved the chili powder (because our oldest and I have very sensitive palates) but I imagine that for those who like it hot it would be really easy to modify to your tastes.   We highly recommend this recipe for everyone who needs a quick dinner.   Thank you!

I tried this recipe last week in an effort to replace the McCormick chicken fajita seasoning that I ordinarily use in making chicken fajitas.  This recipe makes the dish taste just like it does when I order it at a restaurant.  We will definitely be incorporating this meal into our weekly rotation!

Have to give recipe 4 stars because the hubby wasnt crazy about them.  I liked them.. something different and thought the taste was pretty good - the husband thought something was "missing" but couldnt quite put his finger on what that missing item was.   I followed the recipe exactly but did use chicken breasts instead of thighs.

This was very bland.  Could be improved with more seasoning but not really worth the effort.  There are much better fajita recipes.

Love this.  Quick, easy, tasty.  I added cilantro and did yellow, red, and green peppers.  I finished it off with cheddar cheese, fresh tomatoes, and sour cream.

This was delicious!  I added cumin and chipotle spice to the marinade, and let it marinade for 7 hours.  The chicken was tender and tasty!  As the author states, be careful not to overcook. Add the veggies just before the chicken is cooked all the way, then the veggies and chicken are finished at the same time- not the chicken before.

My first time making fajitas with out the seasoning packet. I was looking for a way to make fajitas without the MSG. I was suprised at the ingredients and thought it may end up bland but it had awesome flavor and it was so juicy. Thankyou for the wonderful recipe!!!

We loved this recipe for fajitas.  I added a TB of liquid smoke and a TB of lemon juice into the marinade.  I think I took other folks advice and also added a bit of cumin.  Marinated chicken and beef in the marinade (separately) and liked them both.  Perhaps even liked the steak better...  Made it two days ago, and this is what we're having again tonight!  Yummo!

These were tasty, a nice unique flavor for fajitas.  I added a little cayenne pepper at the end to give it more heat and it tasted great.

I was looking for a fajita recipe that was quick as well as healthy, and tasted good.  This was really tasty. I'll definitely make this again.  I do have to admit that I didn't add all of the hot spices, as I can handle them...and it still tasted great.

Oh these were great! Followed the directions to a tee! I decided to let them marinade for a few hrs in the fridge. The only complaint I have is they were a little on the greasy side. So instead of one tbs I will use a half tbs. Definitely will make again!

Having moved to WA State after living in CA for many many years I miss Mexican food so much. I know that if I want it, I have to make it now. This recipe was easy to follow, not a ton of ingredients, and tasted very good. The only thing I did differently was to cook longer to soften the onions and the peppers and I used red and yellow peppers instead of the green.

I used beef instead of chicken and a red bell pepper instead of green.  I also feel that the veggies need to cook a little longer and the meat a little less, but that's just my preference.  Wrapped up with a whole wheat tortilla, salsa, and sour cream!

I love this marinaide, I use chicken breast and grill them then slice.  I did double the recipe for 5 small breast.  I cook the peppers and onions tossed in olive oil, salt and pepper on the grill in a grilling pan, excellent!!

Awesome fajitas! I added 1/2 tsp cumin. Marinated 4-5 hrs and sauted in the marinade, which made the meat very tender, juicy and flavorful.  Cooked 10 min, added the veggies and cooked another 7 min.  Served with sliced jalepenos, chopped cilantro, limes and sour cream. Delicious!

I usually just improvise when I make fajitas but decided to try this.  I was able to marinate for a couple of hours.  Very nice and tender.  I used chicken tenderloins so did not have to cut them into strips.  I also doubled the marinade and poured it back in the skillet the last couple of minutes of cooking.  They were a big hit with my kids as well.

Rave reviews from even the pickiest eater of all, my son, who not only had seconds, but thirds!! Very easy to make and during the 1/2 hour the chicken was marinating I was able to get the dishes done and kitchen spotless so when dinner was done there was very little cleanup for the boys, they liked that :)  Will make again and again.

The marinade for this is wonderful!!  However, I would add more to the fajitas when I'm ready to eat them, but that's just personal preference.  I like lots of flavors.  I would add guacamole and sour cream at the least.  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs since that was all I had, but I'm sure it would be even tastier with the thigh meat.  I'll try to do that next time, and there will be a next time!!

I tried this dish last night and wasn't that impressed. I think it was the whole Chinese food taste to the chicken. I would have probably like this dish more if it were in a stir fry with other veggies over rice. Flavor of chicken was good just not in a fajita style dish.

I didn't have the green pepper on hand so left it out and these fajitas still turned out fabulous. I did end up turning the heat down to medium-high as I was getting a lot of smoke on high. The meat turns out very tasty and tender. A great recipe and easy to prepare.

Was e3xcellent as written.  I let the chicken marinate in the fridge for several hours.  Had on soft wraps with sour cream and salsa chili sauce.  This it would be good over rice  Thanks for recipe.

Dish was ok. Not as " South of the border" as I expected. Next time I will try and spice it up a bit. I'll probably hold the soy sauce.

VERY good and flavorful - I followed the recipe, to a "T" and I got a ton of compliments on how delicious the chicken was. I let the chicken marinate over night and it perfect!

I really enjoyed the flavors in this fajita recipe. It was delicious. The only things I did different was added more vegetables and some chipotle pepper, because I love the deep flavor. My family loved it and it was one of the easiest meals I have made in a while.

I'm not very picky but I was hoping for a Mexican taste for my fajitas.  It was tasty but it had an Oriental taste.  I know...duh it has soy sauce!! But I read some reviews and determined that it would not taste Oriental. I wanted to make something special for my hubby on our anniversary because he loves chicken fajitas and so tried this.  I should've known to stick with my original recipe...the one he loves.

I used boneless chicken breasts and it turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the hot sauce.  I definitely recommend cooking the chicken for the exact amount of time specified in the recipe.  I continued cooking the peppers and onions for an additional 2 minutes so they would not be so crunchy.  I will definitely make this again!

Great flavor, even without sour cream.  Will make this regularly.  Added a few fresh small red peppers and doubled the recipe.  Used the 30minute marinade option.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly the way it's written. I've made this twice. Some changes that I have found that enhance the flavor - I didn't use vinegar and it turns out fine! I also added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder. Finally, I added red peppers to the veggies.   Wonderful! I served this dish with Mexican rice, sour cream, Mission Jalapeno tortillas (most grocery stores carry them!!!), and lemon wedges. A favorite!

These fajitas were so tasty! The recipe was very simple. I added a little cumin while cooking and cooked the peppers and onions longer to get that blackened taste.

I this recipe did not have the authentic Mexican flavors I expected from a true fajita dish.  I suspected this was the case because of the soy and Worcestershire sauce but gave it a try anyway. Disappointing.

holy chicken fajitas! These were so good. I honestly have never made chicken fajitas before because I never wanted to use a preservative-filled packet of seasoning, so I am super excited to finally have a recipe that I can make at home. Thanks!

We really enjoyed this. I can see myself making it a couple times a month, it's simple to whip up and the ingredients are things you probably already have.  You'd never guess the mix of soy, vinegar and Worcestershire was in this tasty dish! I followed the marinade recipe exactly and used 2 sliced breasts, marinated for about 5 hours. Really great flavor. I'll probably add more  hot sauce next time, about 1-1/2 teaspoons. As for the reviewers who poo-pooed this recipe because of the unconventional ingredients - I've got to wonder if they really made the recipe... while the flavor isn't hugely Tex-Mex and I wouldn't expect to be served this at any of the gourmet mexican eateries in Dallas, I could complete see this as a huge hit at the local bar & grill named as some sort of chicken wrap.

With a few changes this is a good recipe.  First, I tripled the marinade for 5 large chicken breasts.  Next time I will cut the amt. of worchester sauce and increase the chili powder or maybe add cumin.  The meat was so tender.  I also cooked the vegetables first seperate from the chicken as we like soft vegetables.  Good starter recipe and with a few changes our family will use this alot.

This was GREAT!  I didn't use the soy sauce {I was out} and I used crushed pepper flakes instead of hot pepper sauce.  I added the lemon juice and the vegetable oil to the marinate.  I marinated 2lbs of chicken strips for 30mins at room temperature.  I didn't cook these in a skillet; instead in the microwave for 15mins.  I layered the onion and yellow bell pepper on the bottom of my Deep Dish Baker, added the chicken strips, cooked 15mins and let it rest for 5mins before serving to my family.  Will use this Marinate at my Pampered Chef Shows.  Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe because I realized I didn't have a fajita seasoning packet but was craving fajitas, and I think I may stop buying seasoning packets. I loved this marinade. The only changes I made were using lime juice instead of lemon, and putting it in the marinade. I served it with cheddar, sour cream, and tortillas.

So good! I did double the recipe to have more sauce, and also added 1 tsp of cumin, 1/4 cup beer, and 1 Tbsp of brown sugar. During the sauteeing, I also added 1 tsp of corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit to my liking. I'll definitely be adding this recipe to my list of favs!

This is the best marinade we've found for fajitas. We're vegetarians, and we've successfully used this marinade for both tofu and Quorn chicken-style strips. I like to let both of them go for an hour or so in the marinade. I also like to add cilantro if I have it.

Soy sauce may be a fairly unusual addition to a fajita marinade, but the end result was one of the best fajita marinades I've made.  I did add 1 tblsp of lime juice to the marinade, instead of finishing the cooked chicken with it as the recipe suggests.  I also added the 1 tblsp of vegetable oil to the marinade and just dumped the marinated chicken right into the skillet from the ziploc bag.

I was skeptical of this recipe from the beginning based on the Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce, but I went ahead based on the reviews. I was not impressed. These didn't taste anything like fajitas. The acid from the vinegar broke down the meat so it wasn't as tough, but that was the only redeeming quality of this dish.

These were delicious, and extremely easy, especially if you marinate the chicken before hand.  I would use more peppers if you like veggies, but other than that, yum! (Oh, and throwing in some cheese is tasty too!)

I thought this was VERY good!  Key is to let marinate all day.  I liked the unique combo of flavor, but if you aren't a fan of soy this may not be for you.  However, my husband and I LOVED it and will make it often. Thank you!

Awesome seasoning for fajitas... tasted just like a restaurant. This is my new 'go to' fajita marinade!

There were so many good ingredients in this fajita recipe that I thought they would taste better than the ones I make with plain fajita seasoning.  All we could taste was the chili powder, which I don't particularly like.

This was an absolutely wonderful and fast recipe. My husband who doesn't usually care for Fajitas loved it as well. I really think it is the fact that the chicken is marinated that makes the difference. I thought that everything was perfect in this recipe. The only thing that I did differently was leave out the green peppers because my husband doesn't like them... and I forgot to add the lemon juice at the end... but they still tasted great! We topped them with cheese, salsa, and sour cream. Yum Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't as thrilled with this as I had hoped. It was good but it needed a little more kick. Maybe a bit more hot sauce would have helped. I added onions mushrooms and red and green bell peppers. I also used chicken breasts which lowered what little fat content there was.

Delicious! I added just the lemon and some extra lime juice to the marinade. Heated the oil in the pan, add the chicken with the marinade. Cooked on HIGH for a few minutes and then added peppers and onions. Delicious!

Excellent.  I made 4 times the sauce and added juice of 2 limes and 1 tsp cumin to marinade.  Saved some of sauce to add to mixture near end of cooking.  Very tasty.

This was perfect! My entire family, toddler included, ate every bite.  I made a few changes, I added the lemon juice to the marinade by accident and I cooked the chicken/veggies in the oil and marinade also.  I did put a lid on the pan while the veggies where in to help soften them up, but that's just a personal preference.  I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe and plan to make this a regular in our house!

I read the reviews after I already had the chicken and steak in the marinade. We like things on the spicy side so I added red pepper and a couple teaspoons of taco seasoning. My husband really enjoy this recipe, but I will play with the seasonings more when I make it again. Thanks for sharing.

I was little concerned seeing Worcheshire sauce & soy sauce - wondering how it could taste like "fajitas".  It was really tasty.  I added 2 tsp of chili powder instead of 1 to make it spicier.  I really liked that.  The chicken also carmelized well.  Served on a hot fajita skillet & drizzled with lime juice instead of lemon juice.  Lime just goes so much better with Tex Mex.   I recommend this recipe to others.

Wonderful fajita recipe.  It is very easy and tastes delicious.  I actually used gordita soft tortillas.  It was really great.  My family loved this recipe and they are very hard to please!!!  I will definitely make it a part of my regular meals.

This tasted more like an asian marinade than a fajita marinade. Tried it on steak and chicken. It was okay but won't make again. I'll stick with the pre-marinated fajitas you buy at the grocery store. At least then, I'll know I'm getting the real deal.

These fajitas turned out excellent. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I wrapped the chicken in foil and put them on the bbq, to keep them moist. I added a little bit of lemon juice (lime would be better) and some bottled italian dressing. They almost tasted as good as the ones at our favorite mexican restaurant!

My extremely picky 5 year old couldn't get enough of these flavorful fajitas.  I omitted the hot sauce to tone it down for the kids, and cooked the veggies seperately.  I will be making these often!

EXCELLENT!!!! We had left over baked turkey & used the marinade to saute the turkey, onion & pepper in. Next time we'll try as directed, but we know using left overs also works.

This is a great fajita recipe.  I would increase the amount of spices, though. Maybe 2 teaspoons of chili powder and 2 dashes of hot sauce.  Otherwise, great!

You people who did not think there was enough spice are mistaken!
Add some red peppers if you need it! I spinkled the juice from a jalapeno on the saute mixture and YUMMY!

The recipe was just okay.  It didn't have enough taste or kick.  Plus the chicken was watery.  Maybe I did something wrong.  If I make it again I will definitely add more spices.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  My husband thought it could use more zest, however.  I used a food slicer to get my veggies nice and thin, which really made the recipe cook quickly.  I will make this again, but I will add more seaonings to "kick it up another notch."

The fajitas were just as good as you get out.  I let the meat marinade in the fridge all day and the flavor was great.  It was so easy to make and only takes a little cooking time.  I will definately make this again.

Didn't care for it with beef.   Might try chicken in the future.  The soy sauce is what made it seem wrong.  Not Mexican enough for us.

I marinated the chicken overnight, then cooked the onions and peppers (red and yellow, not green) in the marinade as well and served on flour tortillas. 

For my vegetarian friends, I cooked the onions and peppers with black beans in the same marinade and let it cook down.  The flavor was just as good and everyone loved it!

Love the tang of the soy/Worcester mixed. I add more hot sauce and chili powder. I love more veggies so use tri-colored peppers. Served with Spanish rice and white corn tortilllas.

This was a great recipe! I did make some changes.  I added the following to the marinade-red wine, small amount of onion, olive oil and lime and cumin. As the chicken was cooking I put the veggies in the marinade to coat them.  I added cilantro and a bit more lime once the veggies were cooking.  Served with pico de gallo and guacamole-delish!

Yum. Whole family liked it. Added juice of half lime to marinade, let chicken marinade for 2-3 hours.  Sautéed 5 cut up chicken breasts in 2 batches. Caramelized 1 sliced white onion and several baby bell peppers in seperate pan. Stirred together to serve in tortillas with sour cream.

So I had just made this but I did things a little differently. Instead of just using chicken thighs I wanted to add steak to it as well. When I made the marinade I added some brown and white sugar via reviewers. It smelled and tasted amazing, but after I had cooked the meat (included the marinade) and veggies, it was still a little too bland for my liking. Next time I make this I will probably use some more of the suggestions and add cumin and pepper to add a little more flavor. But all in all, it wasn't bad for a first time try and I'll be trying it again with a little more tweaks, thus the 3 stars

Really good! I thought it might be salty or have too much of a stir fry flavour but it was a good moist fajita. We served with cheddar and avocado.

I've made this several times and for the life of me I just can't get it to turn out quite the way I hoped it would. Whenever I cook the chicken, the marinade escapes from the chicken and makes the fry pan too wet. The result is that the chicken doesn't cook well because it is drenched in liquid (perhaps the fault is in my cooking technique). I had to cook the vegetables separately. I'll give this another shot, but it seems like there might be a better recipe out there.

Just made this for dinner! We don't like hot sauce in our family so we didn't add that. It also didn't need the lemon. I caramelized the onions before I cooked the chicken and it was amazing!

I was looking for something different than what I normally make and found this one. I did not marinate, instead I used it in the pan with the chicken and the vegetables. I just like mine a little more flavorful. It turned out really good. My 6 year old loved it! And so did my husband! Thanks. This is a keeper.  For those who are so negative, perhaps they need to give this recipe another shot. It's really worth it.

I really enjoyed this recipe! The only thing I changed was instead of using soy sauce I used Dale's Steak Seasoning. It still has a soy sauce kind of taste but I thought it might help with the oriental flavor some people mentioned. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great! The hubby likes having tacos but I get tired of them. This is a great alternative for me! Can't wait to have these again! Thanks for sharing!

I use this recipe all the time and it's always a hit. Instead of chili powder I use taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning I from this site). I've made it using thighs and breasts and I definitely prefer thighs. Sometimes the breasts can be a little dry. I serve it with Mexican rice and guacamole.

I made these exactly as written with the exception of the hot sauce because I forgot to put it in.  the pan I used was too small, next time I will cook it in my cast iron pan to get that crust.  Will definitely  make again!

Just made these Friday night with my fiancé. So easy to make and the flavor is outstanding. I know the ingredients seem a bit different for fajitas, but they blend so well and really have an authentic taste. For even more authentic taste, I recommend serving with fresh lime-squeezed margaritas!

FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe, and it was delicious. I would use more spices next time, although it turned out really yummy as-is. Also, it is important to get the pan really hot before cooking and to let the chicken brown on each side -- the carmelization is soooo tasty! Highly recommend. I plan to make this again and again :)

Had this for dinner tonight and it was SO good!  I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of thighs since I don't like thighs, and upped the garlic to 4 cloves and bell pepper to 1 and a 1/2 bell peppers.  I was a little worried to add 1/2 a lemon at the end, but it really brought out the flavors. I served it with a salad (weird, I know, but I try to eat a big salad before or with each dinner) and with homemade guacamole.  The guacamole is a MUST! It gives a nice creaminess to the fajitas.  Overall, a very simple, healthy dinner that I will be adding to my rotation.

Made recipe to the letter (added a chopped tomatoe to the meat mixture at the end, had one to use up) and it was AMAZING!  I choose not to encase it in a tortilla, but the rest of the family did and not one morsal left in the pan. We also made guacamole and topped with that along with some salsa.  WILL make again and again.  Just wish I would have taken a picture as it looked to colorful and yummy.

I made this a few weeks ago and it was great! I have always used the powder seasoning and had never done a marinade before but this one was fantastic. It's so easy too, I'll never use the powered store bought seasoning again. Delicious!

I agree with Miss Tina! This recipe was delicious! I used pre-cooked chicken breasts which cut down on the cooking time and used 3 cloves of garlic instead of just one. The result was a quick, tasty summer dish.

The chicken was deliciously tender but a bit short on flavor when compared with more traditional fajitas. I will go with a more traditional recipe next time. The soy sauce mix was not bad; it just wasn't as good as regular fajita seasoning.

Although this isn't bad it really didn't taste like authentic mexican to my husband and I. It tasted more like Asian food. It was very good just would prefer over white rice instead of mexican rice or in a fajita.

Oh my goodness!  I am a newly wed and am always on this site trying to find a tasty recipe to surprise my husband with my new found skills.  Unfortunately they usually don't turn out as good as I would hope.  These fajitas however were just the opposite.  They were the best fajitas I have ever eaten and the best part...I made them! :)  The only downside...I had no confident going in and made them on a night the hubby wasn't home.  I'm hoping they warm up well.  I did make a small change.  Because all I had was frozen chicken breasts in the house, I boiled the chicken and then I sauteed the veggies (1 red pepper sliced and 1 small yellow onion) in the marinade.  When the chicken was done, I sliced it into small strips and made another batch of the marinade (minus the garlic this time) and let the chicken sit in it while I finished up my veggies.  Once the veggies were ready, I threw in the chicken and let them marry together for a few minutes (I didn't add the lemon juice, but that was because I kept tasting the yummy chicken and just got distracted and forgot).  I served it in a warm tortilla with brown rice (minute rice in the microwave), sour cream, and a bit of salsa.  YUMMY!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the awesome recipe that was simple enough for even a kitchen virgin like me to whip up.

Teresa this was delicious!

I was in a pinch for dinner, I started late and wanted something fast, but flavorful and good.  Found your recipe, followed directions for the ingredients, but used 1/2 red, yellow and orange bell pepper and a whole medium red onion and used skinless, boneless chicken breasts.

Served this on whole wheat tortilla and added a little sour cream and cholula...after eating I forgot I didn't put the lemon on it, so I bet that would make it even more flavorful.  

My son and husband L O V E D these...made this a few nights ago and my son asked for it again.  So I have some chicken breasts marinating and will make it tomorrow.

T H A N K  you for posting!!!!

This wasn't bad, but wasn't amazingly awesome either.  It seemed to be a bit vinegar-y, and I'm not sure it really has an authentic Mexican style taste to it.  I did let it marinate in the fridge for about an hour before I cooked it and added twice the amount of garlic that it asked for (but followed the rest of the directions).  Both my boyfriend and I thought it was just OK.

I saute'ed the chicken in the marinate, so it came out juicy rather than dry.

I have used this recipe a number of times.  It's my go-to fajita recipe.  I love that it's quick and I really like the flavor.  It's also easy to change up a bit by adding things like lime juice or extra spices like onion powder.

Not my favorite recipe for fajitas.  The  chicken did have a good flavor but not what I would consider a fajita.  I would omit the soy sauce if I make this again.

We loved this!  One of my favorite fajita recipes I've ever made.  My changes:  I doubled everything except the chicken and added 1/2 of cumin.  I also added a red pepper and put the lemon juice in with the rest of the marinade.  I didn't cook the chicken according to the recipe, but used cooked chicken and let it soak in the marinade for a few minutes before tossing it with the cooked veggies.  So good!  Thanks!

I love this recipe. I do not change any of the ingredients. The only thing I do differently is brown the chicken, remove it from the pan and drain the fat, then saute the veggies in the same pan. I place the chicken back in and mix them together for a couple minutes. Very popular in this house!!!

Really good marinade with a subtle flavor once cooked.  I used extra garlic and hot sauce, and could definitely taste the hot sauce in the marinade after cooking.  Also added another clove of garlic to the peppers and onions while cooking.  Served on flour tortillas with sour cream and salsa.

I just made this dish for myself and my hubby.  For once I got a very positive comment about my cooking (I'm not very good without a recipe) I would absoulutely make this again.  Instead of thighs I used chicken breasts, be careful not to overcook if you decide to use breasts too.  I used two lemons instead of just half because I added it directly to the marinade.  I was a little aprehensive about the soy sauce so I only used 1/2 tbsp. Also instead of using hot pepper sauce in the marinade I just threw a whole jalepeno in my food processor with the other ingredients for the marinade.  It came out very juicy and there was enough to feed a family of four (yay!) I recommend trying it with the recipe for "Mexican rice III" (also found on this site).

Wow, these fajitas are great. This recipe has become one of my regulars. It's easy to make and is delicious. I also add some Spanish rice, sour cream, and cheddar all in a tortilla. I let the chicken marinate in a ziploc bag so there's even less mess. Thanks!

These tasted really good, but didn't really taste like fajitas! Tasty chicken!****Update: My favorite chicken marinade; however, I am still trying to find a fajita marinade. Fajitas in Texas do not taste like this!!

I used breast as the recipe submitter mentioned. I too thought the soy was odd like another reviewer mentioned but it all blended nicely for us. I prefer my chicken grilled but this was fast and easy on a night I didn't have much extra time.

My husband and I were hungry for fajitas but too lazy to go out to eat.  This recipe was PERFECT... we had everything on hand and will certainly make it again... it saved us easily $40!

This was so delicious, our entire family of 5 devoured it!  The only change I made was to substitute chipotle chili powder in place of the chili powder, and I used Cholula for the hot pepper sauce.

I used this marinade for shrimp fajitas.  I found this recipe for quick dinner last minute and somehow left out the soysauce on accident but it was sooooo good.  I wonder if I should add the soysauce when I use this marinade again.

I've also made this with flank steak strips, ground beef, or ground chicken.  It works equally well with all.  I always double the ingredients for the marinade, add 1tsp cumin, 1tsp coriander and cook it with the meat.  I never buy taco seasoning any more, this is our favorite!

I didn't care for the flavor. Some of my guests thought it was good but the majority ate only one fajita then went to a veggie only filled tortilla. That is rather telling being that I have a meat and potatoes kind of family. I won't try it again.

It is an interesting marinade.  Not bad.  Not Mexican! Soy sauce and Wocestershire are not staples in the Mexican kitchen ( I haven't actually been in one, but I think the Senoritas will back me up on this one). Lime juice, Cumin,(even Red wine vinegar might be acceptable). No, not my Fajitas!  You could call them FaHahas though. Just to differentiate.

easy, quick, and delicious. we love mexican food and i usually just sautee my chicken in oil and chili powder but this was Much better! i thought it tasted better than a mexican restaurant! to cut down the fat, i used olive oil and i also added wedges of tomato for the last minute of cooking. paired with a little lettuce and low fat mexican cheese in corn tortillas, it was a real winner. even my anti-vegetable, picky-eater husband loved them! i calculated three tortillas (with minimal chicken) to be about 5-6 points -- for those doing Weight Watchers

GREAT RECIPE!!  I did add the lemon to the marinade and marinated the chicken for 1-1/2 hours...I used the velvetting method (mixing 1 T flour-1T cornstarch-2T EVOO and coating the chicken in it before cooking) it worked perfectly!!!!  Great RECIPE!

These are wonderful!  I was suspicious because of the unusual, non-mexican, ingredients but they turned out great!  I didn't use any of the spicy stuff because I served it to children.  Also used fresh lime juice in both the marinade and while cooking.  Yummy!  Thank you!

I added the veggies to the marinade, doubled the whole recipe, added a teaspoon of cumin and some ground white pepper.  Came out great, could maybe use some green chili peppers, but I didn't have any.  Pretty darn good.

Very delicious!  Used chicken cutlets since they were on sale.  Worked very well.  Also used lime instead of lemon as someone suggested.  A tip, some of us are trying to eat healthier.  I tried Trader Joe's Whole Wheat tortillas and they were very delicious.  Not strong tasting at all.

Super yummy! We used chicken breast and red pepper instead of green. It wasn't dry at all. Served with sprouted corn tortillas and shredded cabbage, along with homemade refried beans. Yum! =)

I have to give this a solid 4 star, if for nothing else, my DS ate it with no complaints.  This was an okday meal.  I agree the seasonings were a little odd with the soy sauce, since people were compaining this was bland, i added some cumin and one package of sazon to the chicken marinading. i forgot the lemon at the end, but then again i probably would have used lime if i had it on hand.

Made this for my family and they loved it.  My husband asked me to make it again.  I could only find bone-in, skinless chicken thighs, and this time I am using boneless, skinless chicken breasts because it's what's in the 'fridge.  I am sure it will be great again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very good change from the more common beef tacos made at home. Would definitely recommend this for someone thats is not wanting to spend a bunch of time in the kitchen preparing the meal. Because the taste does not reflect the fact that it was as quick to make as it was.

Very, very good.  Longer you marinate the chicken, better the flavor.  I made two adjustments I consider worthwhile: (1) I tossed vegies w/ a generous amount of McCormick fajita seasoning both prior to cooking and while finishing in pan which added an additional dimension of flavor, and (2) I followed others suggestion to finish with fresh chopped cilantro last minute of cooking.  Enjoy!

Very rarely do I follow a recipe without tweaking it a bit, but this one needs NO changes!  I have used both chicken thighs and chicken breasts and it's turned out great both ways.  I also am quite generous with the Frank's Red Hot, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Instead of traditional fajitas, I really like this in a whole wheat pita with a little lowfat sour cream.  Delicious!!

This was definetly good, but not great. It did taste a bit oriental like other reviewers said. I added cumin and lime juice, which helped.

I agree with the final reviewer--this is a terrific recipe--and also followed other's advice and used lemon juice in place of vinegar in marinade.  The sauce does sound weird, but you will be adding that extra marinade to boil with the fajitas at the end.

Delicious! We really enjoyed this marinade for fajita night.  My only change was to reduce the chili powder a little bit because of having little ones.  We will definitely use this again.

This wasn't quite right--perhaps it was the lemon or soy sauce?  We marinaded over night and the taste just wasn't that great or "correct" for Mexican flavor...

I made this sauce as-is, but left out the hot sauce because I didn't have any. The worchestershire sauce was overwhelming and it would be better with a lot less of it.

I added about 1/3 cup of water to the marinade as I found the marinade not to be quite enough to coat my chicken.  I also used boneless skinless breasts in place of the thighs and fresh squeezed lime instead of the lemon.  Was fantastic!

I made this recipe for a big family party this past weekend.  The changes I made:  *Increased the number of servings to 40 *Doubled the amount of marinade *Added cumin (a little less than equal the amount of chili powder) *Doubled the hot sauce *Substituted some of the lemons for limes and added it directly to the marinade *Let it all marinate overnight   *Cooked it, marinade and all, in a big electric roaster.    I can't tell you how wonderful this turned out!  I received a great deal of compliments on this recipe.  Cooking in the marinade and pulling the chicken out directly with tongs kept the chicken nice and juicy.  While some reviewers thought theirs had a hint of "Asian" flavor, I didn't sense that at all.  I will keep this around for gatherings of all sizes!

My family loved this and asked that I make it again.  I used Robync2's suggestion of cooking in the microwave.  I recently purchased a deep dish baker and had no idea what to do with it (thought I had ordered a deep dish pie pan).  The meat and veggies turned out great.  The only thing different that I will do next time is use chicken breasts, or a mixture of chicken breasts and thighs next time.  My chicken thighs were so fatty I had to drain off the fat before I could serve it.  This is a wonderful, super easy, quick and delish recipe.  Along with serving for family meals I plan to use it frequently this summer when friends come over for casual outside dining.

We enjoyed this at our house but it was just average. However, I'm willing to keep it on to experiment with it! If you are serving it over rice, as some other reviewers suggested, double or triple the marinade to have enough sauce. I might leave out the lemon juice next time.

These fajitas really were amazing.  I added the lemon juice to the marinade as a previous poster had suggested and it worked out well, although I am sure sticking to the recipe would turn out amazing too.  Definitely worth a try!!

This was a really good recipe.  I marinated it all morning and followed the recipe exactly except that I had to use white vinegar instead of cider.  The only thing that I would possibly change is adding some cumin and maybe a bit more hot pepper spice.  It was a little lacking in flavor for my taste, but it was great for my children because they do not care for the heavily spiced Mexican flavor.  I might even would try dividing it so that my kids can have the more mild, and the adults can have the spicy! Definitely a keeper!

Not only were these too bland, I had a bad feeling about starting to cook the chicken before the veggies.  It should have been the other way around.  Even though the onion and peppers were thinly sliced, 3 minutes cooking time was in no way long enough to get them the slightest bit tender.  I guess this is fine for someone who likes their vegetables REALLY crisp.  By the time the veggies were adequately cooked, the chicken was overdone. I also ened up adding mushrooms and to make it more flavorful and more Mexican in taste; cheese sauce and salsa.  Even after these alterations I think I've made far better fajita filling just by winging it.

Very good fajita marinade recipe. I doubled the sauce and made it in the morning and marinated it all day. I also added more garlic and diced up some jalapenos because we like it spicy. I have used this with beef and chicken and it's been great every time.

I had my heart set on fajitas tonight but I was out of the standard Old El Paso seasoning, so I tried this- delicious!  What a unique taste.  The chicken and veggies would probably taste great over rice as well.  The color of the marinated chicken makes it more difficult to see when it's done.  Be sure to cut uniform slices thin enough that you can be certain they cook all the way through.  I ended up using almost double the amount of sauce the recipe called for.  I used garlic salt instead of minced garlic, and since I didn't have hot sauce I added more chili powder and ground cayenne for an extra kick.  Personally, I like my veggies cooked more than the final result of this recipe.  I ended up picking out the chicken and letting the veggies simmer an extra 5+ minutes.  Next time (there will definitely be a next time!) I'll set some sauce aside and start cooking the veggies before the chicken.

this was so good!  I will never use store bought again.  My family really liked this.  the only thing I changed was no cider vinegar because we were out and I added cumin.

The marinade for the chicken was fine, but I don't think it really tasted like a fajita marinade.  I think I'll stick with my old standby in the future.  The chicken did taste good, it was just different for a Mexican marinade.  Soy sauce?  Hm.  Mixed with hot sauce?  Sounds like a stir fry recipe to me.

I also added cumin, coriander, paprika (instead of red pepper flakes) black pepper, garlic salt, and since I had some unused salsa in the fridge, I threw that in too.  After everything, this was a strong, tasty marinade.

This recipe is fantastic! My husband and I had it for dinner the other night and we both raved over the flavor. Afterwards, I realized we forgot to add the lemon juice, so I will try that next time, but it was amazing even without it! I've already shared the recipe with family and friends. =)

My family loved this recipe.  Using the lemon with the recipe is a MUST.  Do not miss this step.  Totally changes the flavor of the chicken.  I used chicken breasts and added a little cumin because I love it.  Other than that followed exactly.  Will definately use again, can't taste the soy sauce or worch. sauce -- doesn't taste asian at all.

The lemon juice was the kicker here, lime juice should do just as good. We liked it pretty well, but felt it needed more Texas Pete than what the recipe called for.

To my marinade I added about 1t of Cumin powder. Makes a heartier marinade, and we love the flavor it brings.  Loved this recipe, thanks!

i followed the recipe exactly and even included the top-rated suggestions of adding cumin, lime juice & fresh cracked pepper...still had an asian twist. It was good but definitely not what I was expecting...

Easy and turned out better than I thought it would.  While it was not overly flovourful, the chicken went very well with the peppers and onions I cooked it with.  I thought that the marinade was going to make the chicken taste more like the soy sauce since that is all I could smell as I was putting it together.  It ended up being just fine and I will use the marinade again.

I first made this dish in Paris, where several of the ingredients are not readily available, most notably Worcestershire sauce. Since I was living in the Chinatown area of Paris, I had access to a lot of Asian food stores and I substituted Hoi San barbecue sauce for the Worcestershire. It made for really delicious fajitas with an Asian twist! It sounds strange but I highly recommend it if you want to change things up.

Whole family loved this.  I think next time I would add red pepper and maybe some thick slices of tomato.  I find it served that way a lot when we eat out.  These were just as good as any restaurant, and very quick to make.

Way good! I followed the directions almost exact.  The only thing I changed was to add the peppers and onions to the marinade then put it all in the pan together. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was a big hit!  So easy.  Didn't have hot sauce, but it was just fine without it.  I let it marinade a whole day and night and it was perfect.  My husband ate 4 fahitas!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was just okay.  I would double ALL the seasonings (including peppers), and add ground cumin.  It's a good start, but not as much flavor as I would like.

I really enjoy the flavor of this marinade, but like others I added the lemon juice and some oil to it. I would have liked to have extra lemon juice to sprinkle over top after the chicken was cooked, but I used it all in the marinade. I did cook the chicken in some of the marinade as cooking sauce, but just a little of it. Next time, I will not put as much soy sauce or worchestershire, and would add more hotsauce, as it wasn't spicy enough for us. Good marinade,thanks!

Excellent recipe. Very easy to prepare. Added some (very little) shredded cheese to it when I rolled it in the bread. Added a little extra. This recipe went very well with the "Classic Spanish Sangria" recipe that I found here at Allrecipes.

Soooo good!!  I increased the garlic to 3 cloves (we love garlic) and the hot sauce to taste.  I also cooked the chicken in the marinade.  It was so juicy and absolutely wonderful!  My husband loved it too.  This will definitely become a staple in my house.

This recipe was amazing. My boyfriend and I were full, but then had to go back to get one more! I made it with chicken and thin-sliced tri-tip and added the lemon juice and a little vegetable oil to the marinade. We used red and green bell peppers. The meat was so flavorful and the veggies really absorbed the flavor while cooking. All we topped it with was a hot southwest style salsa and it didn't need anything else!

My boyfriend always requests this recipe! To get the full flavor, poke holes in the meat with a fork before marinating. I use 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper instead of hot pepper sauce and balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar. I also cook all of the chicken and veggies in the marinade. It makes everything juicer. I pair this recipe with the best guacamole. Just thinking about this meal makes me hungry!

This was super easy and yummy.  Didn't really change anything except added some fajita seasoning and left out the hot sauce.  Will be making again soon!!!

Great taste & healthy! Next time I will marinate the chicken in a deeper container. I used a glass dish. I served with mexican rice. I used a lime instead of lemon. Served with chunked avocado, cheese, lettuce and sour cream. Delicious!!!

I just tried this recipe and it is fantastic!  I will never buy fajita marinade again.  I took some of the others advice and used lime juice.  I also left out the hot sauce.  I used chicken breasts and left them in the marinade for several hours. We love spicy stuff and this was just right!

This marinade was YUM! I also sauteed red and yellow peppers with the onion and topped with cheese, sour cream, and salsa. It was huge hit!

A good recipe, but being from Texas and doing a lot of Tex-Mex cooking, fajitas MUST be grilled along with the peppers and onion. I also used chicken breast tenders and marinated for about 6 hours.

Made these last night with a few changes: doubled garlic and added some cilantro; marinated for at least 2 hours. Added salsa on top. Very good. Will make again.

This was just not for me although my husband seemed to enjoy it.  I used chicken thighs and looking back, I think that I would have enjoyed it more had I used chicken breast.  The flavor was just okay to me.  Nothing spectacular.

very good as leftovers to let the flavors meld together. fresh from the skillet was good too, but just too fresh--sounds funny, but true. make enough for leftovers! we also used chicken as well as filet mignon. get the most tender steak possible for good results.

This is a standby recipe for a quick meal. We use chicken breast instead of thighs, and add red or yellow bell pepper and red onion. Great for a quick weekday meal.

I didn't make the whole recipe, just the marinade for the meat and my boyfriend said it was just bland. Not much flavor, nothing special. We make fajitas all the time and they usually come out well. He said the worstershire sauce detracted, not added from the overall flavor. I don't thik i would try this recipe again.

This recipe is a 5 Star because everything you need is already in your kitchen.  AND, it makes an awesome chicken for either fajitas, salads, or just a spicy entree.  This was a big hit at dinner served with the Mexican Rice III from this site.  Try it!

Tasty, easy, quick.  Throw the chicken in the marinade in the morning and cook it when you get home.  I love it with red peppers (instead of green) wrapped in whole wheat tortillas with some avacado.

I usually use a fajita starter packet but forgot to pick one up at the grocery.  We actually liked this better than the packets.  Very juicy and easy.  I will use this from now on.

I cooked the chicken in the marinade instead of marinating beforehand (short on time...) and it tasted great.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Great recipe.

Fantastic marinade!  Please use the grill for this recipe!  We used chickan and beef and marinaded for 30 minutes.  Pleny of flavor!  Double the marinade too.  We used green and orange (got to love the orange) bell peppers with onion and wrapped in a tin foil pouch with butter and XVO.  Sprinkle the veges with a little bit of cumin.  GRILL AWAY!  The veges take a little longer than the meat so start them first.  Don't forget to garnish with sour cream and grated cheese.  We will make again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  This was great.  My family loved it.  I added a little lemon juice and Italian dressing to the marinade like another review suggested.  That did the trick.  Thanks Teresa for sharing the recipe.

This was a wonderful recipe!  The chicken was so flavorful with just the right amount of zing.  And I did overcook it by almost 10 minutes, (thought I was done for!)and chicken was actually very tender.  A hit with the whole family!

Was good, but seemed to be lacking something.  Thought it would be more flavorful since got very good reviews. Once I smothered with homemade guacamole and sour cream, didn't really matter anyway, though!

These were good but by far not my favorite fajita recipe.  The worcestershire flavor really came through in my opinion and it wasn't Tex-mexy enough for my taste.  I will try it again, adjusting some of the ingredients.

Wow! We've been eating this as leftovers all week and love it every time! I included spanish rice, cheese, tomatoes and light sour cream in the tortillas and it was awesome. I'll definitely make this again! Thank you Theresa!

Fantastic! I added some italian dressing and lemon juice to the marinade, then grilled the chicken breasts I used. I put butter and cut-up onions in a crock-pot beforehand, let them cook nicely, then grilled the chicken early in the day. I then put the cut-up chicken breast over the onions and put the crock pot on "keep warm" until dinner time. My hubby raved! These were fantastic. I would have used peppers as well in the crock pot but I didn't have any in my fridge. Thanks for the recipe! Yummy!!!

This was wonderful! I was a little wary of some of the ingredients (soy sauce in fajitas?) but everyone loved them. Couldn't find my hot pepper sauce, so I added 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper.

Made this last night, it was easy and tastey.  Used white vinegar, boneless chicken breasts, and forgot the lemon.  It was still delish.

Really good. Didn't have the pepper sauce on hand, so left it out...and I thought they were great, but I will buy some pepper sauce for next time. It would be even better with a little heat! Bye bye fajita seasoning packets!

served it with warm flour tortillas, fresh salsa, shredded lettuce and cheese.  It was a hit.

Thank you for posting the recipe. The taste wasn't quite what I expected. In my opinion, it was a bit bland. Perhaps it's just me. You do/did have a 5 star rating so there are people out there that actually like this recipe. Anyhow, I'm hispanic and I like my chicken very flavorful so I think I will just stick to my standard fajita recipe. Thank you for sharing anyway.

This is the only way I make fajitas. At times I make extra sauce by doubling the Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, chili powder, and lemon in a separate pot so it can be served with any left overs over rice the next day.

Simple, quick, and tasty.  Nothing overly 'special', but it'll definitely become my standard fajita marinade.  Also, I used red wine vinegar, and it tasted fine.

This fajita marinade is excellent! My husband and I aren't meat eaters, so I marinated onion and red and green bell peppers.  We loved it.  The marinade gives the vegetables such a great flavor that if I used the chicken, I'd throw the vegetables in the marinade too!  Great!

I've tried other fajita recipes on All Recipes, and this is my favorite.  I have even used the marinade with beef instead of chicken.  It is also really good to marinate the chicken and then BBQ.

Thanks for sharing a recipe that uses items we have on hand.  When snow hits on the East coast it is nice to have a place to share recipes.  This has a mild flavor even though it looks like it would be hot.  Good to add to a salad next day or over rice.  Thanks!

Love this one. The suggestion for a quicker marinade time by sitting it out for 30 minutes was perfect. The chicken was nice and tender. I always use a little more peppers and onions for these recipes because they are just good.

Very good dish. I made the sauce earlier this morning and  marinated the chicken  in a plastic bag for a good 4-5 hours. I turned the chicken over in bag after 2 hours.  Only thing I would do different next time is make more of the sauce. I also made flour tortillas from this site also. To use with the chicken and vegetables. I would recommend this recipr

Thank you Theresa. This recipe was a hit with my family! My husband said that I have found our fajita recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except for these 2 changes: I added 1 tsp Cumin and did not add the hot sauce (my family doesn't like heat). Dinner was a hit tonight!

These were fine...but as someone who grew up eating great Tex-Mex, this is not what I am looking for in fajitas. I saw a lot of people saying soy sauce seemed like a weird ingredient - actually it is a very common ingredient in fajita marinades at restaurants. The problem with this recipe for me was the chili powder. I felt it overpowered all the other flavors. Like I said, we didn’t throw them out or anything, but based on my personal preference I won’t make this one again.

I was SO sceptical at the ingredients but I was keen to try a packaged spice substitute for chicken fajita marinade. We garnished with fresh jalapeño slices, coriander leaves, shredded jack cheese, diced fresh tomatoes and avocado slices. Served on fresh greens or in a warm tortilla. This recipe is definitely a keeper

This is delicious! I didn't have hot sauce, so I substituted 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper in the marinade. I used it as filling for quesadillas with queso cheese. Everyone asked for seconds.

I added  1 link of chorizo (cooked that first, then added chicken), some cumin, extra hot sauce, used lime juice in marinade and at the end and also topped with cilantro. I’ll use less chicken next time, but it was great!

I was out of fajitas seasoning so I decided to try something new and stumbled upon this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written using chicken breast instead of chicken thighs. The chicken thighs would definitely add more flavor to this dish giving it the extra flavor I felt it was missing, next time I'm going to use those. I also was hesitant about adding soy sauce in the marinade but it seems to work especially with the squeeze of lemon juice at the end. The acid adds a nice touch! Top each fajita with fresh pico de gallo, cheese, guacamole and fresh cilantro  and you have a delicious fajitas. I served these with corn & Spanish rice for a meal my kids devoured.

Oh my gosh! I have never had fajitas that were equal to these. Absolutely delicious!! Only change was I used chicken breast  and cut chicken and vegetables into bite-sized chunks. Marinade was  superb. Then I squeezed a half lime over the finished product. So easy, so good! Just became one of my FAVORITES!

We used boneless chicken breasts, red onions and red bell peppers. The chicken only marinated for 1/2 hour and the flavor was still amazing! Served with wraps, salsa, shredded cheddar jack, sour cream and guacamole. I forgot the lemon juice but honestly I don't think it needed it. Next time we are going to try the marinade on steak as well. Highly recommend this recipe!!!

I chopped everything up and then we ended up not eating it until the next evening. Apparently the marinating is key--It was AMAZING!!

Changes:
1T coconut oil instead of veg
1/2 red bell pepper and 1/2 green bell pepper
1/2 of an onion instead of a whole one
White vinegar instead of white wine vinegar (didn't have it)
Whole wheat tortillas
Baby spinach
Sour cream
avocado

What I did: 
I took someone's advice from a review and sauted the veggies first, and then added the marinated chicken AND the baby spinach, covered the pan, and cooked it for 20mins on low heat. After it was cooked all the way through, I turned it onto high heat until all the juices were off. 

I had it with olives, lettuce, spinach, sour cream, and avocado. It was pretty amazing. Wish I had marinated longer, and maybe next time will marinate the veggies too.

Used all ingredients but added cumin and salt  and franks hot sauce and also smashed my garlic probably used a little more because it was a little bland for my taste buds .Everyone liked it.

Relatively easy (just need to plan ahead a little) and very good.  My husband isn't a big fan of chicken, but he really liked this recipe.  I think the seasonings would be good with beef, too.  I served it over fried polenta for a different take on things.  Yummy!

I'm only giving this recipe four stars even though my husband really liked it. I thought the marinade was to dry. Added about  2 tlb. oil before I added the meat. Also added cumin, cilantro, juice from 1 lime and doubled the garlic.

I used this recipe last night to make chicken fajitas.  I will definitely be following this recipe again.  I did not use the hot sauce (didn't have any) and used lime rather than lemon (again, it was what I had on hand).  Other than that, this was terrific!  Thanks!

The best homemade fajitas I've ever had.  I was worried that the chicken wasn't cooked enough, but as everyone else said, it was perfect!! Perfect on a tortilla with sour cream, guac and some cholula!

Came out perfect! The meal got compliments. The only thing I changed is I precooked the peppers in just a little oil to get a charred taste and to make them softer, and included jalapeños.

Not bad at all, I did overcook the chicken just slightly but substituted most of the spicier ingredients for milder. Used breast also. I really enjoyed them in a fresh salad wrap :)

These are the best homemade fajitas I've ever had! I added shredded cheese, sour cream, and a little hot sauce to the finished product, but the flavoring was so good that no salsa was needed. I also made some jasmine rice to put in the tortillas sort of as a filler. It was so flavorful! One of my new favorite recipes. :)

I made this as written, except I only had chicken breasts and no chili powder so I substituted a homemade rub that contains chili powder. I was conscious of  the cooking time to keep the chicken from drying out and it turned out delicious!  Oh, and I forgot the lemon but it was still delicious.

This is a good, quick recipe.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and followed the recipe exactly (except for onions b/c I didn't have any).  I let the chicken marinate for about 45 minutes after cutting the breasts into strips.  Next time, I will add the peppers to the marinade as others have suggested.  I Will use onions next time too.  My 10 year old loved them and said they were "excellent."  I didn't get the Asian flavor that others commented upon.

wish I had read down a few more reviews to those who added in the extras spices & heat as those were the people who found the soy & Worcestershire sauce to be not so over powering. Was a great flavor as the recipient stands, but not where I was heading. I'll try this again with the suggestions for sure! Thanks for sharing!

I've tried lots of different fajita recipes and marinades and while I was skeptical of the marinade (soy sauce?), these turned out great! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs as that was what I had on hand. Very tasty. I made them with the cilantro lime rice recipe on here it was a perfect pairing. I will definitely be making these again.

This was delicious!!! Did it taste like an authentic fajita? How would I know, I'm from the Midwest!!! But was it a tasty dish? Absolutely!!!!!! Did I make it exactly as written? Of course not! I left out the hot sauce and peppers, used lime instead of lemon (in the marinade) and marinated the chicken and onions together in the fridge. The result was fantastic! I will make this again!!!

I made this for dinner tonight for my wife and some friends. Everyone loved it and my friends are natives of El Paso, Texas. I was so nervous that there wouldn't be enough flavor or heat so I replaced the green pepper for Anaheim pepper. It was a subtle replacement and still just as good. I paired this with some Pico De Gallo and guacamole along with some Mexican rice. Again a huge hit with my El Paso friends.

This recipe as is isn't that great it's too bland for my taste and more tangy then spicy. However, when you add chili pepper, cumin, lime juice and cilantro to the marinade and get rid of the lemon  it is delicious and incredibly easy. The doctored version is my go to recipe during the week. I also tend to either cut the chicken in half or double the marinade ingredients so there is extra when I go to add the veggies.

I thought this had pretty good flavor, but still prefer just plain old fajita seasoning.  I actually like it better the next day reheated!  Thanks!!

This was a good, solid recipe and somewhat unique. Made the marinade per the recipe and it resulted in a somewhat Asian flair on traditional fajitas. Could take it a step further in that direction with a little ginger root. I'd make this again. It's not a traditional fajita recipe, but that's not a bad thing. I served with guacamole for a swing back towards Mexico.

It was very good, but a little weak on flavor for me. I added extra worcester and soy to the veggies and didn't have cider vinegar so I did rice wine vinegar with a dollop of honey because it seemed like a good idea. And if you shop at Costco, I highly recommend using their Greek yogurt jalapeno dip in place of sour cream (cant believe i was out, but the dip worked beautifully)

Made it with sliced chicken breast. I didn't have the Worcestershire sauce, so skipped it.  Marinated overnight, and added a Poblano pepper to the green. Flavorful.

Wow, easy, good, & healthy.  I followed the marinade recipe to a T except was afraid it wouldn't be enough so doubled it for two chx breasts I had in the fridge.  I poured the marinade and chicken into the pan together and wished I hadn't, it didn't need that much liquid in the pan...but I think it was the right amount for marinating. We had this in flour tortillas, no sour cream, no cheese, no salsa, it stood on it's own two feet.

I thought it was great.  Evidently I've had the recipe since 2010 and had never tried it.  I used thighs, didn't have Worcester sauce so substituted with a little molasses and smoke sauce.  Didn't have peppers so used a few spears of Asparagus.  Still came out great and I added the marinade in with the first batch of chicken.  I'm going back for seconds!

I thought this was great for what I was using for. I had the ingredients on hand which makes it even better. I marinaded my chicken breast all day and grilled them. Topped with pico de galo and shredded Mexican cheese and put under the broiler until all the cheese melted. Then topped with sliced avocado... Great meal

This was some of the best fajita mix that I have ever had! I thought the chicken would turn out really dry, but it was surprisingly moist and flavorful! The bit of crunch the veggies had added a nice overall texture to the dish. Will definitely add this to my arsenal of quick and easy recipes!
UPDATE: Just made with tofu instead of chicken and it was still amazing. Now that is an impressive recipe.

Excellent!  I was tempted to make more changes than I did, but I'm glad I left it alone for the most part.  I used a fairly liberal "dash" of hot sauce and I used sriracha.  I was out of lemon juice so I subbed lime.  Really good!

good with salsa and homemade tortillas.  I added oregano and cumin, but could have still used more flavor.  Still, it was easy to make and pretty tasty.  The chicken turned out especially good.

I marinated the chicken for 30+ minutes at room temperature, but it wasn't very flavorful.  I also didn't like sauteing the onion and pepper with the chicken rather than separately.  I doctored up the leftovers by adding fresh pineapple chunks and sweet-sour sauce adapted from Sweet and Sour Chicken I, and that turned out to be delicious.

I absolutely loved this and agree with the review from another user DON'T SKIP the spritz of lemon at the end. To be honest I used lime because I think it melds better with a Mexican inspired dish and it's what I had but it just brightens the whole thing! I added a sprinkle of fresh Cilantro and I will definitely make this again!

My husband's words: "Ohhhh, wow!  This is so much more flavorful than I expected!  I thought these were just gonna be your standard fajitas...but these are so good!".  I doubled the sauce, used several colorful peppers and a large onion.  I marinated both the chicken and the veggies, and added all the marinade when I added each component to the pan.  Don't forget the lemon at the end!  Made some brown rice to go with it (always my husband's request), and served with cheese and sour cream.  Very good!

Very good!  Not juicy, but it tasted exactly right.  Next time I'd put more hot sauce in.  A dash does not make it even a little bit spicy.
I used the leftovers from a roast chicken, and added 1/2 cup of water to the marinade to make sure that all the pieces of chicken touched it.

So good.  So very good.  Can I just write "So good" again and again and you'll get the point?  I can't get over this dish.   EASY to make and, my god, just, so very good.  Great blend of flavors, great balance of spice, and pretty light and healthy.  I cannot wait to make this again!

This has become a staple on our dinner menu! The only things I did different are double the sauce and I used almost an entire head of garlic. My husband, who is a picky eater LOVES this recipe! P.S. we also eat it over white rice

Okay the soy sauce marinade was not really what I expect a fajita to taste like, but it made the chicken super tender and it was pretty good.  Only thing I did differnt i I threw in some shrimp with my chicken because I like shrimp fajitas.

This was wonderful.  I doubled the marinade because I had some extra chicken.  I added extra garlic, and put the lemon juice in with the marinade.  I sauteed the onion and pepper, then added the chicken and marinade and boiled it all down a bit. This is such a keeper.

Amazing!!  Just added a little chili lime seasoning to marinade.  The marinade caused a wonderful browned result like you get in restaurant fajitas. Yummy!!!

I've made this over and over again. I stick pretty close to the original recipe, sometimes using chicken breasts instead of thighs.  The family loves it.  It's easy and made with ingredients I usually have on hand in the kitchen.  It's a winner at my house.

I'm so glad I tried this recipe - it is very good!  It is one of those recipes with ingredients usually in the house.  The only change I made was using less oil by spraying the pan with oil before sauteing the chicken.  We ate it with thin pita bread instead of tortillas.  I will definitely make this again soon.

I followed the recipe, except I doubled it and added the oil and lemon to the marinade. I cut the chicken into strips and marinated it in the fridge for almost 7 hours. I fried it up in EVOO w/ an onion and some peppers. It was good, but it didn't have a whole lot of flavor. It kind of reminded me of curry, I think next time I'll just make curry.

Teresa, thanks so much for the recipe, I LOVE LOVE LOVED IT (& my family did too)!!! I changed a couple things though. I didn't have or just couldn't use some of the ingredients so instead of the Worcestershire sauce I used A1 steak sauce, instead of soy sauce I added a bit of salt and I didn't add vinegar or the lemon, but it honestly tasted DELICIOUS! Wrapped in a warm wheat tortilla with a side of fried plantain!! MMMMM... GOOD! Oh I tripled the amount of each ingredient because my family of 5 eats like a family of 20 and let me tell you, they finished every last bit of it! :)

Had this for dinner tonight - delicious.  Followed the recipe but used 1 lb. chicken breast, added a red bell pepper, tablespoon of cumin, white vinegar (since that's all I had), and messed up and put the lemon juice in with the marinade.  It was great, will definitely make this again.  Loved all the veggies.  Thanks Teresa !  Also had no sour cream on hand, used a tiny squirt of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing on mine, fiance used a spoonful of salsa.  Mmm.

Muy autentico or not, this recipe really worked for this American family. It used ingredients that I usually have at home (had a lime -- rather old and small -- so I used that instead of a half lemon) and was tasty, healthful, inexpensive and didn't take all day or dirty every dish in my kitchen. The "participation" aspect, i.e. getting to "play with one's food at the table" made this dish fun and drew everyone to the dinner table including a neighbor's stray kid who was at our house playing!
PS - Don't leave out the (oh so inauthentic) soy sauce -- it really revs up the chicken's flavor.

Oh man, the first time I made these I couldn't believe how good the chicken was. The chicken never turns out dry. I have made these a few times and have used chicken breast but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

Good! I was a little worried because of the marinade ingredients, but had to give this a try. Very interesting blend of flavors. I did add cumin and a bit of lime juice to the marinade. I thought it was good, but my fiance raved! Thanks :)

Very good.  I don't think it tasted like soy sauce or oriental.  Putting sour cream and salsa on it probably helped.

These were really good right out of the pan and steaming hot.  I served them on a king sized corn tortilla with Terry's Texas Pinto Beans. Yummy!  I only used bell peppers because my eldest son is alergic to onion.

These were great, and really easy, too. I did cook the chicken two minutes longer, because my pieces were quite thick. Even the three-year-old loved them. Thanks for a great, fast recipe.

This recipe was excellent. I used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. Will definitely make this again. I did not have lime juice, however, I will try it next time I make these.

Tasty!  Tasty!  Tasty!  I sauteed my veggies first, because my husband like them really soft.  I added some salt and pepper and lime juice while sauteing.  The marinade for the meat was awesome as is!  This meal received a thumbs up while chewing from my husband. (a great rating) :)

I'm not an authority on fajitas, but this makes an above average marinade for a tasty fajita.  4 stars as is, and the second time around, I made a few minor changes that seemed to improve the flavor, at least for me...

I used a good grade balsamic instead of cider vinegar, substituted a sushi soy sauce (which is lower in sodium and sweeter), and increased the minced garlic to two cloves.  After cooking the fajita mix (meat, onion, pepper), I blended together a spread of 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup medium salsa, 1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend and lemon juice, and spread a couple of tablespoons over each fajita before rolling up.

Thanks for sharing your recipe, Teresa.

Mucho bueno!!! Yum to my tum! Will make these again! I did not have cider vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar, still turned out very good. Served with Mexican rice, corn tortillas, guacamole, cheese and sour cream! Great chicken fajita recipe! Thank you!

We loved the chicken--although I made a few changes. I left out the worcestershire sauce and added lemon and lime juice and some chopped onion to the marinade. The soy sauce did give it an asian flare, but it was still really good--those looking for true mexican won't like it which is why I gave it a 4. We grilled the chicken strips and used the extra on a salad the next day!

Used breasts instead of thighs (we don't like dark meat). Didn't have chili powder so I used 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp Cayenne pepper instead. Wow! what a kick! These were so much more flavorful than my usual fajita seasoning. Will make again. Yummy!

Very good and easy to prepare.  I used red and green peppers for color and flavor.  Next time I think I'll add the lemon juice to the marinade instead of just adding it at the end.

This was great and I have now made it a few times.  I used a red pepper instead of the green as we prefer them but I didn't change anything else.  Thanks!

AWESOME FAJITAS, I DIDN'T ADD THE HOT SAUCE AS MY FAMILY DOESN'T LIKE ANYTHING TO SPICY. I ADDED LEMON & LIME JUICE TO THE MARINADE. RECIPE IS AWESOME! THANKS FOR SHARING IT.

This was very good.  The only changes I made were to cook the peppers first and then added the chicken.  I was out of fresh lemons so skipped the lemon juice.  My husband really like it.

We made these last week and absolutely loved them!  My husband said they taste exactly the same as the one's he orders at popular chain restaurants.  He insisted that night that we add "Fajita night" to the regular menu rotation.  Loved it!!

This had great flavor. My husband is not a fan of 'new' food, but he really enjoyed this - we will be making these often! I took advice from other reviewers and doubled the marinade for 2 chicken breasts, and cooked the chicken in the marinade. Also, used white vinegar because I had it on hand.

Was short on time and ingredients (no lemons) but nonetheless tasted great!  I doubled the vinegar b/c I could only marinate for 15 minutes.  I sauteed the onions separately with a little salt and pepper.  Then separately, I sauteed garlic for about a minute in some oil, chili powder, and cumin, then threw in the chicken to cook.

The marinade for this recipe is excellent, I actually double the marinade ingredients this recipe calls for because it doubles as a wonderful sauce in the fajitas. I absolutely love making this recipe because its easy, quick and tastes wonderful. It is my husband's current favorite recipe, I would definitely recommend trying these Pollo Fajitas.

I doubled the meat and quadrupled the marinade/sauce; I guess my friends and I just eat a lot. I marinaded the chicken in a ziploc bag in the fridge for little over an hour and the meat was moist and flavorful. I did put some garlic in the skillet before the meat, as well. I might not scale the soy sauce with everything else next time, though, as the meal was a bit salty. I probably should have found skinless, boneless thighs, but I didn't... which contributed to some manual labor on my part. Under those conditions, not particularly bachelor-friendly. Find skinless/boneless as the recipe calls for, though, and it's easy enough.

Well this was good but it didn't have as much flavor as I'd hoped.  I think the marinade needs to be doubled and it needs to sit longer than 30 minutes.  Also could use another clove or two of garlic.  I added a Tbsp each of lemon and lime juices to the marinade.  But I just really couldn't taste it at all on the chicken.

This was my first attempt at Fajitas - glad I used this recipe!  Though I used chicken breasts, white vinegar, cayanne pepper, etc I had on hand. The lemon at the end was wonderful and leftovers are even better. Hubby and I loved this recipe- itsa keeper!

I typically just use a southwest seasoning while cooking the meat and veggies.  So, for a change I decided to try this recipe and boy am I glad I did!  They were delicious.  I did add about a teaspoon of cumin and a little bit of salt and pepper to the marinade.  I also placed the onions and peppers (green & red) in the marinade with the chicken for about 45 mins which was plenty of time.  I also really liked the flavor the chicken thighs brought - much better than chicken breasts, which is what I normally use.  Thanks for a great fajitas recipe!

I have made this chicken twice.  The first time I did it I did it exactly like recipe said.  The second time I cooked it in the oven.  I did not cut the chicken into strips.  I used chicken breasts.  I doubled the recipe and I marinated them for about 6 hours.  Then I put them on baking dishes, I sliced onions and red peppers.  I placed taht right on top of the chicken.  I put them in the oven for about 50 minutes and they came out really good.  My dinner guests where raving about how good it was.

I thought this was outstanding!  I wanted a recipe for beef fajitas, but wasn't too sure about the ones listed. So for fun made this one. I did do 5 dashes of hot sauce. Like my stuff a bit spicy. It was delish.

Great marinade! Everyone enjoyed the fajitas this made. I simplized things and added all the ingredients into a large ziploc bag, closed it up and shook it up to mix, then added the chicken and marinaded over night. Very good! Thanks for sharing!

Very simple fast and tasty - added liquid smoke for some extra flavor. Left out the hot sauce.

This was good.  Marinade was easy and coated the chicken well.  This is a fast and filling meal for busy weeknights.

This was really good! I marinated it(breast strips,not thighs) for about 45 minutes. The chicken was tender,and a beautiful golden brown color,thanks to the soy and worcestershire sauce. My family loved it,and I will be making it again! Thanks!

Excellant, even the kids loved it. Definetly a keeper.  I was skeptical about the soy and werster sauce being over powering, but was not. I added extra garlic and 1 TBS. powdered faita seasoning.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The meat had a nice flavor to it, but it wasn't too overpowering.  

Next time I think I'll marinate the meat a bit longer.

I loved this recipe! My only suggestion would be to cut down on the cooking time of the chicken slightly...my pieces got pretty charred. Overall though, this was great!

Loved it...My girlfriend gave it a "10". Followed the directions except for putting the marinade in a sealable bag and put into the fridge for 30-60 min (don't like leaving raw chicken at room temp). Served it up with sour cream. Will definitely do again.

I made this as written except I didn't have any hot sauce, so I used chipolte chili powder instead. While it tasted ok, it was lacking something for our tastes. I will probably not make again. It's definitely not tex-mex fajitas. Perhaps teriyaki by adding some honey or brown sugar and pineapple?
I will keep looking for a good fajita recipe.

I really liked this.  I used the marinade for my chicken.  Then after adding the veggies I added more marinade ingredients plus a bit of V8 and lemon to make it a little more saucy.  I added zucchini in it as well.  I also added one shake of seasoning with smoke flavoring to the marinade.

I made these again.  This time i made marinade as directed, with shake of SouthWestern seasoning. Marinaded chicken and veggies (peppers, onions, zucchini,mushrooms) in seperate bowls. Cooked on Forman grill. MMMmmm

I made this one night when I started making fajitas and realized I didn't have any fajita seasoning mix, and have never had to buy fajita seasoning since! This is amzingly easy, delicious, and a healthy meal to top it off. This is a weekly favorite. Thanks

Whether or not they're authentically Mexican, they're really tasty and easy to prepare.  I marinated chicken breast overnight (due to a change in plans) and the fajitas tasted great the next day.  Added a side of black beans to the suggested accompaniments and it made a fine meal.

Very Good and Easy - used Breasts instead of thighs and also cooked in the marinade because of time restraints.  I think next time I would add some cumin!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried several fajita marinades.  This one is not highly traditional, but turns out pretty savory.  Not scaldingly hot.

I used Penzey's medium hot chili powder, added 1/4 tsp. pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp oregano.

Well received by DH and I; son who is picky, didn't like it so well.

As someone who is trying to live with a low fat diet, I thought this was pretty good.  Served it with pico de gallo, flour tortillas and fat-free sour cream.

I've made these several times and love them! Have also made for company and always get rave reviews. I use chicken breast instead of thighs. And when I'm just about through sauteing I splash in a little more soy sauce (low sodium because this already has a good salt flavor). Wonderful!

Absolutely the best marinade! I didn't have the cider vinegar but it still tasted so good. I used it on chicken & steak and marinated it for about an hour. I wrapped mine in foil and put in on the grill and the meat would melt in your mouth! Thanks for the recipie.

I liked this recipe but I didn't love it. The chicken came out tender but it was rather tasteless. That is my husbands favorite dish in the mexican restaurants and he told me to look for another recipe for this. I'm sorry but I will have to keep on looking for a GREAT fajitas recipe.

I really loved that this recipe used up just the little bit of everything that I already had on hand. My family really enjoyed this recipe. I was rushed and only had 30 min. and the marinade could be tasted. Will make again.

This recipe's very good.  I love that it's made with everything you'd normally have in the house.  We like it better than the fajita spice packages from the store.  It's now the family standby for fajitas! (Make sure to serve with salsa, chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese, sour cream, etc.!!)

Great recipe.  I used chicken breasts, though, and lime juice in place of the lemon juice.  Growing up in south Texas eating lots of tex-mex, I was wary of this recipe, but it was great.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a really tasty way to prepare fajitas.  I added a tsp. of ground cumin to the marinade and it tasted great.  I think next time I'll squeeze fresh lime over the chicken right before serving to perk up the flavors.

This recipe was quick and easy. Everyone loved it! I did add the extra chili powder, lemon marinade and extra hot sauce. I was only able to marinate the chicken for about 2 hours but it was very flavorful.

Made with chicken breasts and let them marinade all day.  Next time I will double the marinade.  Made with Absolute Mexican cornbread from this site.  Thanks Teresa.

Great fajitas!  I doubled the marinade and added cumin, lemon pepper and oregano.  I allowed the boneless/skinless chicken breasts to marinate for 4 hours prior to cooking.  I used yellow and red bell peppers in addition to the green for extra color.

Good & easy, but I like to marinate overnight for much better flavor.  Also if you're working it's easier to come home and have it waiting for you to saute up! I omitted the oil and just used olive oil spray on the pan.  Works just as well.

Really good fajitas! Added a squeeze of lemon and some cumin as suggested by another reviewer, and some red pepper flakes to give it more heat. Served with Mexican Rice II from the site, it made a really delicious meal.

This recipe did not have the bold fajita taste that I was looking for. I sprinkled more chili powder and cumin to give it more flavor. I used a non-fat cooking spray instead of oil and cooked it in a non-stick skillet. HOWEVER, the taste was good to roll in a flour tortilla, with cheese, salsa, lettuce and ranch dressing. Also, I marinated the chicken for 6 hours.

I didn't much care for the flavor of the chicken alone but once all the ingredients ware rolled together in a tortilla with some sour cream, I thought it tasted pretty good. My son who loves mexican food however refused to eat it. I might make this again but will keep looking for a better fajita recipe.

Really good fajitas!  I never would have thought - soy sauce???  But really it's delicious.  I added some salt to the marinade.  All it needed was a little salsa and cilantro on top, some Spanish rice and salad on the side.... very easy dinner, and well-received.  Will be making this again!

Very good, but it did seem to be lacking something.  I used soy chicken so maybe that was it.  I marinated it overnight & the soy chicken tasted wonderful!  Definately a great marinade :)  The salsa & sour cream pepped it up a lot!

My husband loved it!  I used red pepper and we added our own toppings (cheese, lettuce, sour cream, taco sauce...) and it was a great, easy meal to make.  I will definately try this with steak too.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! It's become a standard in our dinner rotation. All the ingredients are things I keep on hand, nothing unusual or expensive. It's got great flavor and provides me a broad palette to add and subtract as I like. We regularly add portobellos and carrots to round out the veggies.

Served these for company the other night and they were very good, I didn't add the lemon (my last lemon had gone bad and I didn't realize until I was cooking).  Very easy and uses ingredients I usually have on hand so I will definitely do again--next time I'll make sure to buy a fresh lemon!! KM

I just got married and can't cook at all, but i made this (so easy!)and it's the first thing my husband absolutely LOVED.  I didn't change one thing about it and he couldn't quit talking about how great it was!  Said it's the best fajita he's ever had..hands down.

Excellent!  I used flank steak and added a drop of liquid smoke.
