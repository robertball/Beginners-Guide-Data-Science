Not sure if I can review my own recipe....it is OK to cut the cooking time to 3.5 or 4 hours as someone else suggested.  Also, if you can find authentic tasso (can be ordered on the internet if you search for it), it makes a great substitution for the ham hock.  If you use tasso, you need to cut back or eliminate the creole seasoning since tasso provides a lot of heat along with flavor.  Andouille is a good substitute for smoked sausage as someone suggested, but again you may need to cut back on the creole seasoning depending on how much spice is in the sausage.  Celery is really optional, I often don't use it.

Finally, someone commented on it being too soupy.  Cutting the water back by a cup is OK, but if you cook it the full 5 hours it gets a little thicker.  In addition, I recommend using high quality medium grain sticky rice (the Japanese rice often used for sushi).  New Orleanians typically use long grain rice, but the sticky rice is delicious and gives it a much thicker, non soupy, texture.  Sticky rice gives it a delectable porridge-like consistency.

I liked seasoning mix -- extremely close to what I currently use -- but I put the hot sauce on the table.  Three suggestions:
1)The beans need to be soaked overnight to be thoroughly hydrated and cleaned - drain and refill the water after soaking.
2)Add the ham hock and cook for about 3 hours before adding the veggies and prefried/drained sausage. 
3)While sauteing the veggies add a couple of large spoons of beans and mash into the veggie mixture. This flavors and slightly thickens the sauce.

I loved this dish! Made as written except for the ham hock and sausage. I had a very meaty smoked ham bone in the freezer so I threw that in the bean pot. A bowl of coleslaw and a skillet of cornbread and, ah, my. A supper fit for a king!

Delicious!
I've made this recipe a handful of times now and it keeps on tasting better.  
I used bacon fat for the shortening and cooked the red beans using the slow cooker after soaking overnight.  This last time, I cut back on the liquid to about seven cups.  Instead of water, I used chicken stock.
When the beans are tender, I take about two cups of the beans, veggies, liquid (no meat) and run it through the food processor for a heartier, thickened texture.  I return the processed beans back to the crock pot until fully cooked.
I serve the red beans with medium grain Calrose or short-grain Nishiki rice and cornbread on the side.
Put a bottle of Tabasco on the table and hmmmmm!

This was easy to prep and throw in the crock pot.  I do recommend soaking the beans overnight:  I cooked in the slow cooker on high for about 4 hours.  I didn't have a ham hock but had andouille and used that.  I cut the Tony's to 1/2 tablespoon with the andouille.  My 4 yo and 3 yo old asked for seconds but all they could talk about was how spicy it was and I had to refill their waters about 3 times.  It was exactly the right amount of spicy for my husband and I.  If you are going to cook in the crock pot a good rule of thumb is to just cover the beans by about 1/4 inch because the amount of liquid you start with will generally be about what you end with.

This is a very tasty recipe. However, I did make a couple of changes. I used chicken broth in the place of the water, and after bringing everything to a boil on the stove, I placed it all in the crock pot on the low setting. After 3 hours I did mash a good amount of the beans against the side of the pot to thicken it a bit. Next time I will reduce the broth to 6 cups because it was a little more soupy than I like. This is a keeper! Thanks Matt for a wonderful recipe.

IMHO, Good. The sausage needs to be added later in the process, because its a bit mushy after simmering for 5 hours. Also if you're going to bother adding a ham-hock for flavor and meat then I recommend 2 because there's not much meat on them. The recipe is a little soupy for my taste, recommend 7 cups of water. Had scratch cornbread as a side..perfect combo.

I love this recipe. Very tasty. I made a few small changes. I used Andouille sausage, and per some reviewers, I added it at the end so it wouldn't get mushy. I cut it in 1/4 inch rounds and sauteed them until slightly browned. I used Johnsonville brand, which has only a slight spicy taste. I soaked beans overnight, and then cooked it in a slow cooker. I didn't want soupy beans, so I added only enough water to cover beans, 3 cups. I slow cooked 10 hours, and the consistency was perfect, slightly thick red juice. I really like the spices in this, but I tasted after 8 hours and I thought it needed more salt and spice, so I added a second dash of hot sauce and an extra 1/2 T Tony Chachere's seasoning - perfect. Great over white rice.

When  I have about half hour left to cook I take the back of a spoon and smash some of the beans on the side of the pot. It helps make it a little thicker without adding anything else to it!

Oh yeah this is tasty. I used andouille sausage. I used 1 1/2 pounds of beans and 2 ham hocks but the original amount of sausage. Great flavor with the right amount of kick to it. Served with cornbread.

EXCELLENT!!  I used 6 cups of water, smoked ham shanks and instead of shortening I used olive oil.  Time was reduced b/c I soaked my beans over night.  I also used whole grain brown rice.

I've made this for guests several times and it's a huge hit. I just throw it into a slow cooker so I can forget about it! Even better the second, third day as the flavors combine. Try making it a day or two before, then reheating it in a slow cooker. Yum! 8 cups of water is kind of excessive if you're eating right away- 6 is more than enough. After a couple of days, it all gets absorbed.

Loved this a LOT! I didn't have a ham hock but I did have 7 cups of rich dark ham stock and a cup of coconut milk in the freezer. I used some andouille I brought back from Nola. I will make this again and again. Maybe tomorrow.

Loved this recipe. I've actually made it twice, the second time I used canned red beans instead of dry beans, cuts down tremendously on the water needed and cooking time (down to about an hour) with little loss of flavor and I also mixed the rice into the dish instead of serving over it the second time.

Wow!! Made this last night and it was awesome!! I cooked it longer to thicken up the way I wanted, deleted the celery, and used bacon grease to cook the onion and pepper. Other than those changes, I kept it the same. My wife and kids loved it. I made it to go with Texas slow cooker pulled pork and spicy cole slaw, also from this site. Great meal and I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe! I cooked in pressure cooker for 25 minutes. Combined everything except smoked sausage & rice, added smoked sausage after cooking beans in pressure cooker. Used Sriracha sauce and added 1 whole cayenne pepper. Take the pepper and milk out the meat inside(yum)  Added a Tbs. or 2 of chicken bouillon to water and just added enough water to cover beans. So good served with greens and hot vinegar.

Absolutely delicious. I omitted the ham hocks and instead added a bit of liquid smoke; the taste wasn't distinguishable in the final product, so I'll try adding it halfway through cooking next time instead of at the beginning. Unless you like very spicy beans, I suggest using regular smoked sausage for the dish, as the creole seasoning adds plenty of heat. I only needed around 4 hours for the simmering, and I didn't soak the beans ahead of time, but that may have been a fluke, and the extra hour of cooking won't ruin the dish. You can add a pinch more of the spices as you see fit, but not too much- judge for yourself based on the age of your herbs.

Good basic recipe! I like to make a roux and add the sausage later, so it will thicken and the sausage won't get mushy.

I was awesome.  I added more cayenne, being I was born and raised in LA.  We like it spicy.  Also, I cut my sausages in diagonal pieces and brown them real well on both sides.  I added the sausage to the pot after the dish was completely finished.  When you do it that way, the sausage maintains its integrity and its full flavor.  If you cook it in the pot with the broth and beans for 4 or 5 hours, it just taste like a watered down hot dog or it taste exactly like the beans.  I also used 2 ham hocks because I love the smokiness it brings.  Oh, and don't forget, there is meat in the ham hocks too.  You have to "debone" it like a chicken to get to it, but well worth it.

I grew up on red beans and rice as a kid in Mississippi. Every Wednesday for lunch in high school. This recipe is exactly as I remember it,  just a little spice, and warms you all the way  through. I soaked the beans (I used small red beans) overnight and cooked about 4hours. 
 Here’s a tip for the people think that the liquid came out a little too thin: take a cup of the beans, mash them and reincorporate them in the pot. It will thicken the mixture.

i loved this.  my DH not so much, that's why the 4 stars instead of 5.  the seasoning was spot on from what i remember from being in New Orleans.  mine might not have looked as pretty, but boy was it tasty. i'm going to make up some of this spice mix to have on hand.  i used http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/62568095/cajun-chefs-cajun-seasoning/detail.aspx  thanks for the post Matt, this will have to be one of those recipes i make just for me.  :-)

Yummy!  I did not use shortening, because I don't have any.  I also did not use bay leaves, because I don't like them.  After I fried the meat and veggies in a pan, I then combined with the water, beans, and hock in the slow cooker.  Cooked on low for 8 hours.  Will def make this again.  I did take the suggestion and use 6 cups of water.  I could go for more spicy, but you can always add more Cajun seasoning to your own bowl!

This is a great recipe!  Very flavorful, especially if you make it the day before you plan to serve it.  I followed the recipe, except for serving with brown rice instead of the traditional white rice.  I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning, which was very good.  I also browned the cut-up smoked sausage before adding it to the pot, as I didn't want it to take the chance of it getting mushy.  Thanks for this keeper recipe, Matt!

I waited until the last half hour to add the sausage and also added a bottle of beer along with the water at the beginning (cutting the amount of water by a cup and a half). Best red bean recipe ever!!!!

Didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  Subbed bacon fat for shortening and ham hock.  Used my own seasoning blend.  Used chourico sausage.  Freakin' fabulous.  My rather picky son took a few bites and said I could make this again.

Excellent as a vegetarian meal as well.  Omitted ham hock and sausage.  Doubled the celery, used 7 cups of veg broth and 1/2 cup of red wine and added liquid smoke during the last 15 minutes.  Delicious.

This is the boyfriend's favorite so far and I use it as a guide line. Instead of the ham hock/ shortening I put in a good amount of bacon fat which is something I normally just have in the fridge. Such an easy meal to prep in the slow cooker, that's what I love the most!

Turned out very favorable, but too soupy. I suggest reducing the water by a cup. Plus, with just a little soaking time (perhaps two hours), there is no need to simmer for the suggest 5 hours, just test the texture of the beans around 3-1/2-to-4 hours.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes. I love it with mesquite-flavored Kiolbassa from Costco and Tony Chachere’s creole seasoning. It always gets compliments when served to a group. Also, if you forget to start it five hours in advance, it works well in an Instant Pot for about 70 minutes at high pressure.

I soaked the beans overnight and eliminated the celery. Put everything except sausage in the crockpot, substituting the water with low sodium chicken broth which I reduced to 7 cups. Cooked on low for 6 hours, then high for 3 hours. I cut the sausage into thin slices, browned them in a skillet and added to the beans about the last 45 minutes. The juice was just about right, not too thin. No need to add salt if you use Tony's Creole seasoning. I did add a teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little more kick.The beans were a little salty until I added the rice. My husband who's not a big fan of Cajun food really enjoyed this and wants me to make it again.

I have made this several times and love it!  I follow the recipe pretty much as given just changing the smoked sausage depending on what I get.  This is actually tastier the day after.  love freezing the leftovers so I can have a quick meal on those busy nights later on.

This is my absolute favorite recipe on this site. It’s the perfect red beans and rice.  I get rave reviews every time I make it. I usually use a pretty meaty ham hock and chop the meat from it back up and put it back in the beans after cooking.  Perfect with some corn bread.  I go back to this recipe repeatedly.

I love this recipe.  I could live on it. I use the crock pot, and it is important to know that you have to reduce the liquid to just covering the beans, because as another review said, with a crock pot you end up with the same amount of liquid you start with.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and run a couple of cups of the beans through my blender to give me the texture I like,  This is the best red beans and rice recipe I've had so far.

THE ONLY THING THAT I MAY SUGGEST IS TO SOAK THE BEANS FOR ATLEAST 3 HOURS AND FRY THE SAUSAGE BEFORE HAND TO PREVENT THE SAUSAGE FROM BECOME A LITTLE MUSHY. AND DONT BE AFRAID TO USE MORE SPICES IF YOU REALLY WANT THAT CAJUN TASTE!

This was super good.  I did make some alterations:

1) No meat stuff. It doesn't need it anyway.
2) I replaced some water with 3/4 cup of Chardonnay and 2/3 cup Sherry.
3) I doubled the Creole spices.
4) I added a tablespoon of Cumin.
5) I added two teaspoons of cayenne pepper.

Fantastic flavor!  I had left over brats from the grill so I used those instead of the smoked sausage.  I did use the celery; also added extra garlic and crushed red pepper.  I used homemade creole/cajun seasoning because I can make it with less salt than I can purchase. The recipe is a great blend of flavors.  I would have never thought to add the sage and thyme, but it was a perfect addition to this.  Hubby loved it too.  Thanks so much for posting.

Will definitely make it again.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used 6 cups of water and like another review I cooked it on the stovetop in a pot for about 1 - 2 hours, then tranferred it to my crockpot and cooked it for 5 more hours.  Into the second hour in the crockpot I added smoked sausage.  Served it over rice with Lousiana Hot Sauce on top.  My husband said this was the best Red Beans and Rice I ever made.

I made a few changes. My boyfriend is vegetarian so for the first part of the process I left out all meat products and cooked as directed otherwise. I love using my crock pot for these kinds of things so I sautéed the onion, garlic, and bell pepper as per the directions and added it to the crock pot with the celery and spices. I let that cook for 4 hours, mash some of the beans in the crock pot, and remove the boyfriends portion. I then add andouille sausage and cook another hour. It's delicious! I lived in New Orleans for 4 years while I went to college and this is the closest recipe I've been able to find.

Just delicious! The smoked flavor of the ham hock  was amazing. I loved the hint of heat/spice from the Creole seasoning. The only thing I added was a tablespoon of cornstarch thicken the broth.

Hard to beat red beans and ham bone alone but these extra seasonings put it to 5 stars.  Good recipe and will use it next time I want Cajun the beans.  Placed beans on top of Basmati rice.  Good combination.

Didn’t have andouille sausage but substituted some hatch green chili sausages. Put in a ham hock and it came out great.  Yes I’ll definitely make it again.

Used a ham steak (cubed) instead of a ham hock. I like lots of meat in my RB&R!

Very good! Very similar to the red beans served at Harry’s bar in NOLA, which are the best—and FREE— red beans I’ve ever had. Their secret ingredient?? EGGPLANT! Awesomely delish.

Wonderful! Best red beans and rice ever. Only changes were to omit the sage (don't care for it) and use smoked turkey sausage to cut down on fat. Will definitely make this again. A friend from New Orleans uses Camellia brand red beans, which I did...perhaps that makes a difference?

This was delicious. It was a bit watery, so 3 hours into cooking I removed about 3 cups of water and boiled it down in a separate pot to concentrate the flavors (about 15 minutes). I returned the thickened broth to the pot and cooked for another half hour (about 4 hours total). I added a couple teaspoons of Accent, but followed the recipe otherwise. Will definitely make again!

We liked this a lot but would preferred more spice and more sausage. However, I didn’t use the brand of creole seasoning that was recommended. Adding hot sauce at the end helped.

This was delicious. I used chicken broth instead of water and added a red pepper as well. I also used a combination of andouille and polish sausage. The combination of thyme and sage worked very well too. Will make again.

Great recipe. I thought I’d make it & share with others but my husband wouldn’t share & ate it all in about 3 days! . I replaced the fresh onion, peppers & celery with a single frozen bag of same ingredients (for ease) & replaced the ham hock with cubed smoked ham (could not find a ham hock!). Turned out great & actually needed to add a little more water.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Camillia dry beans are by far the best, but If you must use canned red beans, try to  find the "Blue Runner" brand.  I don't know if they are available outside the Gulf Coast, but they are so creamy and match the New Orleans texture to a "T".
You will not be sorry!

Hubby says it was the best red beans he’s ever had. Terrific recipe. With eight cups it does make a lot of ‘gravy’ but that was a good thing. Really it needs no changes whatsoever. Thank you for posting the recipe.

I rate recipe's on what I can do with them because, inevitably, I change ingredients to fit our tastes's so, that said, this one comes closest to  very little change, hence, 5 stars.
Having eaten Red Beans and Rice in Naulin's & experience using  hamhocks for flavor Here's what I changed on the first 'go round'.

Charles' review focused  on some  key ingredients important to both he and I.  His tastes dictated  adding 2 hamhocks for 10 servings.  Our taste's agree. I made 5 servings  using 1 hamhock. 
We differ somewhat on sausage consistency so cooking time is extremely important.  Since I like mine on the mushy side 4 to 5 hours are great. If one likes them on the 'firmer side' as he does,  experiment with adding the sausage later.  

He also knows 4 to 5 hour cooking times are necessary to get the full flavor from the hamhock.  My mother did the same. Growing up in a middle class New Jersey Italian neighborhood,  pork products were a staple for making spaghetti sauce.  She used pigs feet (similar in taste) )instead of hamhocks. The butcher would discard them so the price was right.  For those of you thinking 'ewwwww', she lived to 90 and my father 93.  Myself? I'm 65 and riding an average of 60 to 70 miles a week on my road bike. You can stick to your veggies...  Mom got that one right!

He also commented on the broth consistency. He likes his thicker the same as me. I slowly added flour  to thicken it.  Corn starch doesn't work well for me as it tends to glob even adding

My husband was born in New Orleans and he loves it when I make this red beans and rice. I do not change the recipe, only add sausage a little later.  My kids eat this too because we wait to add cayenne or hot sauce until we serve and the recipe with just the creole seasoning is not hot.

Pretty much followed the list of ingredients, but used bacon grease to sauté the veggies and I used a 6 qt crock pot set on "high" for 8hrs. 
Instead of ham hocks... I used 1.3 LB of unseasoned fresh ham necks and 12 oz of smoked beef sausage. 4 bay leaves instead of 2. 

I grew up on shrimp boats in and on the bayous of Louisiana and this base recipe is pretty close to perfect for my palate.

Long grain rice with a few reckless dashes of Louisiana hot sauce on top, cold beer and a comfortable place to lay down afterwards. Not a bad way to spend an evening.

This is great and worth the time you put into it. I also soaked my beans overnight. I didn't have a ham hock so I just got cut up pieces of ham and ham fat and used that to saute my veggies in in the beginning. Then pulled out the fat and left the ham pieces to simmer with the beans. I added in the sausage later as well. I just used water instead of chicken broth/stock and honestly it was fine, the flavor was amazing (I'd watch the salt though when adding any broth/stock, mine was plenty salty as-is). The beans get that glorious smokey flavor that only slow-cooked beans get, no canned beans can compare. Love this! I am already for my second try but this time got the real red beans (instead of kindey) and found some ham hocks. Can't wait!

Loved it !!! Husband loved it too!
Will definitely make it again. The only change I made was to use a ham bone  with some meat on it instead of the sausage, the way I remember it from when I lived Lafayette, LA.
Just the right amount of heat.

My husband LOVES it and says it is like his granny used to make. Can't go more than a month or 2 without him begging for me to make it again. Only thing I change is making it in the crock pot instead of on the stove.

I love this recipe because it has all the same seasonings as my mom's.  My method of putting it together is a little bit different but I think the result is just about the same.  I did soak the beans overnight and used chicken broth instead of water.  I also added the browned sausages at the end so they wouldn't be mushy.  My NOLA mom would be proud :)

The spices were spot on.  Next time I will reduce the liquid- it was too soupy, but delicious.  I can't wait to try this again.

Excellent flavor. My go to red beans and rice recipe from now on. My family preferred the small red beans but was tasty with larger kidney beans as well.

I've made this twice now.. It was quite a hit with the BF! I followed the recipe as written, except that I used a yellow bell pepper instead of green (it's what I had on hand) and also added a bit of beef broth and some smoked paprika to enhance the flavor & the color a little. I didn't measure any of the herbs & spices, I just eye-balled it & added to our taste preferences. Both times I served it with cornbread, fried okra & cole slaw. Yum!!! This is a wonderful recipe that I will make often.

I have tried several recipes for red beans & rice. This one was right on the money. I didn't even have to alter the recipe.

I will definitely make this again! I did add a little extra seasoning and a couple more ham hocks but without the two the recipe still would've been great! I will say with the addition seasoning that I added there was no need to add hot sauce. Next time I make it early in the morning and serve the next day. They taste even better the next day! I'm so happy we don't have to go all the way to New Orleans to get good red beans now!

I am Southern, so we when we have beans (pinto) and cornbread with dinner I usually make a huge pot of beans and make this recipe with the leftover beans.  Makes a fairly quick meal (and delicious) having seasoned beans already. I cook on stovetop and adjust seasonings to our liking.  Thanks for the recipe and y'all should try it! Roll Tide!

I made mine in the slow cooker, and it was excellent!  Our grocer sells chunks of seasoning ham, and I keep that on hand in the freezer, and I used that in place of the ham hocks.

Quite good! I made this tonight and loved it.  I used a slightly different sausage because it was on sale and prepared my own red beans from dry beans first, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely and it turned out wonderfully.  Unfortunately it's a bit too spicy for my hubby's tender tummy, but I'm freezing the rest in individual packages for lunches later on.

These were really good. Have an excellent flavor with a spicy kick. Good thick, texture although I did smash a few beans to thicken the sauce but my family enjoys the beans mostly intact, as well. We were able to make two meals out of this amount. I will be making these again.
