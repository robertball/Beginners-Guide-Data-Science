Used those long almost seedless English cucumbers and cut a little thicker than 1/4 inch.  Then took a spoon and hollowed out a little bit of the center to make a well for the guac.  Topped with very thin slices of cherry tomato and a dollop of ranch dressing.  Took to a party and they all disappeared.

This was a real hit at the party! I used grape tomatoes at the top instead of plum tomatoes. I agree with earlier comments that it needed a little zing - maybe some chili pepper?

This was excellent and easy.  Brought to a party and it was a hit.  I had homegrown cherry tomatoes and basil from the garden which added to the fresh flavor.  The avocado mix was 'lick the bowl' delicious.  Bonus is that it felt healthy.  Used leftover mix to spread on burgers.  Double yum!

Made this for a party and they were gone in minutes! Used a bit of garlic powder instead of real garlic  and it still tasted great. Got nothing but great reviews. Will make this again for sure. Very light so perfect if you're eating a heavy meal afterwards.

Cook's note state you can use cherry tomatoes. I had grape tomatoes on hand which are basically the same thing and this is what used. I left out the optional yogurt because we just don't like it.  I think if you were to use yogurt it would be good with a pinch of dry dill stirred in it.  These were fun and refreshing and something I will make again. I used a crinkle cutter on my cuke's and that made for a nice presentation.

This was so good. I made sure to finely chop the Basil before mixing everything.  I added the zest of the lime and that really made a difference.  I used garlic powder but next time I will use fresh garlic.

Love the idea of the healthy appetizer but this lacked some flavor...maybe adding something to give it a better finish? Jalepenos??

Made this and was disappointed a bit.  Seemed to be lacking something in the avocado/basil/garlic mixture...onion maybe? Did make a nice Christmas tree layout with it so that was good.

Tried this recipe twice.  Neither time did the ingredients blend properly.  I threw everything down the garburator and will be deleting this recipe from my collection.

I used a food processor, but I suggest using a blender to get the ingredients chopped finer, especially the basil. I used grape tomatoes sliced in half and then I secured two halves of tomato on top of the avocado mix with fancy toothpicks. I didnâ€™t have a squeeze bottle to drizzle the yogurt, so I put a mini dollop on top of the tomatoes. I took these to a party and everyone loved them.

VERY simple to make. Its a light and tasty appetizer! However the recipe says 4 servings which led me to believe that it wouldn't make that much...I tripled it and made two english cucumbers and still could have made more!

A refreshing summer snack bite. A bit bland so might try adding a little zing next time as others suggested. I loved that I had all the ingredients in my garden other then the avocado. Looked very pretty with the orange and red cherry tomatoes I topped them with.
