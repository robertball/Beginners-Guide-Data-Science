Really should rate this at a 3, but I am giving it a 4 because it has so much potential! First of all, an absolute MUST, is baking the pie crust for 8-10 mins before filling otherwise you end up with a soggy bottom. Cover the edges with tin foil or a pie edge cover because they WILL burn by the end of baking, specially at that temp. As for the temp, I would reduce it to 400F next time, which is plenty hot enough to bake a quiche. I did add some onions that I softened in the microwave and some garlic powder - I would add more next time. Also, I would change up the cheese and do a mixture of cheeses like cheddar, mozza, parm, and asiago. The milk and cream need to be reduced to allow the egg to set properly - I would reduce the milk and cream both to 3/4 cup EACH. The next time I make this with the changes I've noted, I will update.

I think I needed to cover the crust with foil toward the end.  I had to take it out because it was really getting brown.  I would have preferred the texture a bit firmer (so I guess cooked longer).  Also next time, I might try to add spinach or onion or a different kind of cheese.  It was a little mild in flavor.  Also, the milder flavors taste better when it isn't so hot out of the oven.

Add a little grated onion and garlic or grated shallots...sprinkle with parmesean cheese both before and after baking.

Yummy! Everyone couldn't stop eating it. I made it for someone and everyone else ended up eating  all of it, so now I'll have to make another. Very good. Great dish for a dinner party.

I used both sharp and mild cheddar cheese and omitted the hot sauce.  A very good recipe.

Oh my goodness, I just finished eating 2 pieces of this for dinner and it was DIVINE!!!  I would not change a thing, the simplicity of it is what makes it so good...just perfect!  It was light yet filling...a bite of custard mixed in with cheese  YUM!!!  This is probably my favorite recipe off this site to date.  I wouldn't change a thing as far as the recipe goes but definitely, when you're making something so focused on the cheese I would splurge and buy a really high quality sharp cheddar from Trader Joe's or an equivalent.  YUMMMMM is all I can say and I have ONE happy tummy tonight:O)

The dish came out great (the suggestion by another reviewer to bake the pie crust by itself first was spot on), but it's kind of bland by itself. Next time, I will up the hot sauce/pepper/paprika and maybe add in onions, broccoli or other veggies.

I made this and it turned out wonderful!  Even as leftovers, it heated up and was yummy good.  I can see that this would make a fabulous base for some crumbled bacon or some ham bits, maybe some onion.  I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe,it comes out great every time.  My daughters Girl Scout Troop even made it!  The picture really doesn't do it justice, it looks beautiful after it has cooled a bit.  I also use this as a base recipe for other quiches

I added six pieces of crispy bacon. Everyone loved it & my grandsons asked for seconds. Even the picky seven year old.

Great tasting easy to make. I spread red pesto and cooked backed bacon on the base.
I made too much liquid but never mind and added extra cheese. 
Served with Spaghetti in a tomato sauce
