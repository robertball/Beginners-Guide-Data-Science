Excellent recipe!  Very spicy as-is, so I wouldn't alter a thing.  I wish they let you do halves, it'd be a 4.5 for sure.  Only thing I did differently was I used about 2 tsp. dried parsley instead of the 2 Tb. fresh since I knew I wouldn't be able to use an entire bunch of fresh over the next few days. They ended up pretty oily so I might reduce the oil a bit next time.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe! ***EDIT*** I bumped this up tp 5 stars since I've made this pretty much every week since that first time.  I don't always have shallots around so I make do with an extra clove of garlic or two and a few liberal shakes (maybe 6-7) of dried, minced onion.  That way, as long as I have potatoes and my spice cabinet I can whip these up as a side to anything in no time at all.  I only have to bake for 30 minutes with one flip halfway through.  Absolutely delicious!***another edit*** Yes, months later and again more to add.  We converted this into a "grill recipe" and wanted to share since no one wants a hot oven for very long during the summer.  Before you throw your meat on, crank the grill to about 400 or so and throw these on the top rack if you have on on a sturdy cookie sheet.  Grill about 20 mins, flip them and finish off another 20 minutes until golden-brown.  We like them this way even better!

Kind of played it by ear since I only made one potato--just sprinkled with a little Cajun seasoning rather than measuring individual spices,and still used the other ingredients called for  (in far lesser amounts of course!) Crispy and brown on the outside, and nicely done and not mushy on the inside. One potato was perfectly done in 30 minutes. Delicious!

I followed directions exactly. The aroma filled the house and I was afraid the taste would be too strong. It was perfect! My husband was very pleased, said they were the best oven potatoes he ever had. My son ate them all up also.  We all thought they were great exactly as instructed to prepare them. The leftovers taste just as good.

I would give this a solid 4.5.  They were really great.  You don't feel the heat until you've eaten a few.  I cooked on 425 because I was grilling outside and didn't want to come back to a burning kitchen.  Also, it only took mine about 30 minutes.  I let them sit in the oven for another 10 minutes.  They were crispy on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside.  YUM!
*TIP*  I bought a little salt and pepper jar at Walmart for less than $1, and I made a big bottle of the spices all mixed together.  Now when I want to make this, I just cut up the potatoes and sprinkle my "fry spice" on them.  It's MUCH easier than getting out all the different spice bottles.

This was very good. We didn't have shallots, so we substituted with half an onion and added an extra clove of garlic. We also baked them for an extra 15 minutes to get them a little crispier. My wife loved them! We'll be making these again.

These are really good!! I did put everything except the olive oil into a small food processor chopped it, and the added the olive oil and gave it a short whirl.  I made a nice paste that stuck to the potatoes. These are little spicy but you can't stop eating them actually addicting.

I have to admit that I ate about half of these potatoes myself because they were JUST THAT GOOD.  I used a combination of red, white, and sweet potatoes and used a little less cayenne pepper.  Will def. be making these again.

These were very tasty. I baked them about 15 minutes longer than requested just because I like my potatoes on the crispy side. The seasoning was just right for us and not overpowering at all. I will definitely make this again, it is going in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing.

The family and I loved this including the little ones.  I made it a little too hot so deviate too much from the spices in the recipe.  I didn't have any shallots but some green onions and used the tails of them instead.  What a way to get rid of left over red potatoes and make a very tasty and spicy dish!

I doubled the all the spices EXCEPT the salt, I just added that to taste. Good side for Leftover Dog Pile. I served these with a homemade ranch dressing to dip. These were good, but I think it could use a little more somethin'-somethin'. Maybe some garlic/onion powders.

These potatoes turned out fine, but only after adjustments-- so I don't think it is fair to give a higher mark as written.  Once I sliced the potatoes I rinsed them in water and dried them well to remove any starch, so they would bake up more crisp.  Fresh shallots or garlic would turn to ash in this heat, so I used onion powder and garlic grandules.  I reduced the cayenne pepper by half when I put the potoates on the pan, then added some to one end, as 2 members of my family like things more spicy.  The cooking time as approximately 35 minutes.

I served these with the Cajun Stuffed Peppers from this site.  It was a great combo.  They turned out great although there were black flecks in the pan from where the seasoning that was not on the potatoes burned.  It wasn't very attractive so you might want to transfer them to another dish to serve them.

I found a new favorite recipe for potatoes!  For the longest time I was using the 'Roasted New Potatoes' recipe on this site.  I did without the shallots (none on hand) and it was still great!

I used the tip and subbed russets since that is what I had... added cajun seasoning, olive oil, onion, and garlic...and what the heck? How about some carrots too?! This was great! I cut my potatoes in about--I'd say the size of a jumbo olive (??!!) and they were done in closer to 30 minutes. A great side that lets the oven do all the work! Yum!

Absolutely delicious potatoes! I used russet potatoes and yellow onions and they came out so good with just the right amount of spice! One thing I might just do differently next time is wrap portions of the potatoes in foil so they cook but not get all crisp or hard on the outside. I like my potatoes soft and tender but without that almost burnt texture.

These potatoes were a smash hit at our Christmas dinner. I looked through all the potato recipes to find the one I wanted to make and chose this one. Imagine my surprise when I bought the red potatoes and found the same recipe on the potato bag. This is a true keeper.

Quite spicy and not necessarily pretty since the garlic and shallots tend to blacken. Also not a fan of the smell burning garlic makes while they are cooking. But it doesn't bother me much because they are so good. My favorite seasoned potato - I can't even think of anything I've had in a restaurant that comes close.

These went over well with my children and with me since they were easy to prepare.  I tossed all the ingredients in a plastic bag and shook it up.(No dishes)  Then I dumped it all into a well greased disposable tin pan (Again, no dishes to wash) and placed the whole pan on a preheated grill set on the highest heat.  I stirred them about every five minutes making sure they weren't sticking to the bottom.  When they started to get crispy I took them off the grill.  They were perfectly seasoned as I added the ingredients the recipe suggested.  They were not too hot and not too bland!  Just Lovely!

I made this for my family.  It was a little spicy, but my picky 11 year old ate it up.  I thought it was missing something... maybe a little cumen?  Some onion powder... Not sure.

These were a wonderful side dish to a Bourbon-Glazed Beef Tenderloin that I made for my Mardi Gras party this year.  Thank you for sharing.  I kicked up the spice a little bit more and added a little tiny bit of Parmesan just for flavor.  Very delicious!

These were very good and tasty. Nice, light and healthy. I cut my scalloped my potatoes instead of cutting them into wedges. I also added some Herbs de Provence (I'm sure any dry herb mixture would do) and a bit of crumbled bacon (from 2 baked bacon strips). Topped it off with fresh chives. This was good.

These potatoes are the best roasted potatoes that I've made in a long time.  The spices give them extra flavor, they are so great.

Have made this twice in the past month, once when my brother was visiting and again last night. The first time was for my brother who dislikes potatoes.  He never said a word but had 2 large helpings, then finished off what was left on the platter. Great recipe, cooked the way recipe is written. Thanks for sharing it.

Loved these potatoes, I did use Yukon Gold instead of Red potatoes as it was what I had on hand.  Did not use the 1/4 cup of olive oil but instead sprayed the potatoes with PAM spray before adding the spices to cut down on the fat.

LOVED this recipe.  Like other reviewers, I used half the amount of oil, and there was still enough.  Also, the potatoes were ready to eat after only 35 minutes, so watch your oven carefully!  We had this with the Seasoned Turkey Burgers recipe from this site.

enjoy this very much.  For 2 used 4 small to med red potatoes and cut to 1/8 inch and cooked for 30 min. Left in at 350 to keep warm for another 20 min and they were pretty crunchy (which I enjoy) but close to being over cooked.  Would probably been done in 30 min turning half way through.

These make the perfect snack or side dish or anything, really. They were so tasty! I baked them about twenty minutes longer than the recipe called for because I like them crispier, but that didn't seem to matter, because everyone gobbled them up. Scrumptious.

I make this all the time and LOVE it!   The spices are just perfect.  The changes I make are: omit the shallots, use garlic powder instead of minced garlic, and I probably use less potatoes (I don't measure).  Other than that, the recipe is to die for.

Delicious potatoes. I used russet as it was the only kind I had and I also replaced the fresh parsley with dried. Mine were done to perfection after 35 minutes. I'll makes these again for sure.

Delicious! The only changes I made were to use thinly sliced baking potatoes (the only ones on hand) and, at the suggestion of another reviewer, add a little pepper to the mix.

These are amazing!  My son, my boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating them!!  This is definitely going into the recipe rotation.  Even my son who doesn't like spicy food thought these were good.  I do like mildly spicy food and my boyfriend likes really spicy food.  We all three agreed that these were really really good.

Made this with cajun spiced sole fillets last night, mainly to compare the spice combination in this recipe to my package Cajun spice.  There is no comparison.  The spiced fish was bland compared to these potatoes.  A keeper in this house, for sure!  Thanks for a new take on oven fries.

These are awesome!!!  Great to do with red potatoes, baking potatoes AND sweet potatoes. I've had to substitute red onion for the shallots at times, and have never had any complaints.  I'm always asked for the recipe and these are a hit everywhere I've brought them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this!! I did not have shallots, so used regular onion, and russet potatoes.   follow the rest of the recipe to the letter- Absolutely awesome!!  Didn't have to cook it quite as long..  make sure to turn them like it says.. otherwise you get some dry pieces.

These were great. I added quite a bit more cayenne because I love spicy foods. A keeper for sure.

I added the onion and garlic halfway through and cooked these for 40 minutes at 220 degrees C as we have a fan oven. This was pretty much perfect but no way hot enough which surprised me as I expected it to blow my head off after reading other reveiws. I suppose it just goes to show we're not all alike. As we already make potato wedges in this way using other herb and spice blends, I'd reccomend that you experiment eg rosemary and garlic, or curry, or whatever you have on hand.

Love them!  Made as is except used only about 1/4 tsp. salt.  Also did not at cayenne pepper until after potatoes were in the pan, then added to just one 1/2 side of the pan (the kiddos don't do too well with the spicy).  Didn't have fresh parsley, but used dried in the same quantity and it was still just fabulous.  Great recipe!

These were AMAZING.  Perfect recipe, and it was totally on par.  I sliced mine a little thinner, so they cooked for less time, but they came out crunchy and seasoned PERFECTLY.  Will make again!

Honestly the best I've ever tasted, It was easy, I've changed a couple of ingredients, used russet potatoes and onions instead of shallots but it turned out wonderful. I'm pretty sure I'll make it again.

I decided to make this recipe at the last minute so I didn't have any shallots.  Since they have an oniony garlic kind of flavor, I just added a little chopped onion.  These are awesome!  My family loved them.  In fact, I am having to make them again 2 days later!

These are great.  I make them routinely now.  My only change is that i backed down the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon as they were a little too hot for me.  I like spice, but it was a little too much.

Also great if you cook them on the grill, just make sure to cook the potatoes a bit before grilling.

Today is Labor Day and I wanted to serve something other than the traditional fare of hotdogs, hamburgers and potato salad.  I grilled some steaks and served these yummy potatoes and boy were they a hit!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated except I substituted onions for the shallots because my grocer didn’t have shallots in stock.  The cooking time was too long as these were done in 25 minutes but otherwise the recipe is perfect as stated.  They are very spicy which is great for my family but would also taste good with half the spice for those who don’t like hot food.  Will definitely be adding these to my repertoire.

Tasted amazing. I didnt mix the ingredients together first and then add the potatoes. I just added each ingredient to the potatoes in the bowl and mixed it all together.

I've made a lot of different flavors of roasted oven fries, and this is probably my favorite. I've made these a few times now, and they are great--I like the sneaky late heat, sometimes I use a little more cayenne to get more heat. As others have said, these are good with ranch dressing, but you dont' really need to dip them in anything because the flavor is so good. I've used both red potatoes and yukon golds, and they turned out great either way.

I made these again and made some changes.  I used 4 large baking potats and cut them into steak fries. I also put the parsley on while they were baking and I added more cayenne.  It was really good and everyone like them except the children. I will be making this again for sure.

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Yukon golds, because that's what came in the CSA bag. I loved the flavor of the roasted shallot pieces. I didn't find this spicy at all. This mix would be good with yams, too.

These were very good. I didnt use the onion or garlic because i thought it would burn after an hour in the oven, so i used garlic and onion powder instead. i also used dried parsley. They needed a lot of salt, but the finished result was perfect! Nice crunchy outside and tender inside! yummm...

I love this recipe!  Everyone I have made it for loves it.  I cut my potatoes into thinner slices so that they get nice and crispy.  Also, I tend to add a little more of all the ingredients for a little bit stronger flavor (especially garlic and shallots).

These are delicious! I didn't use garlic as some members of my family were going out but they still had plenty of flavour. However, I found they cooked in about 35-40 minutes at approx. 400F, although our oven is usually quicker than recipes say anyway. We had this with steak and mushrooms and it was very yummy.

I really liked these potatoes.  I added a few extra seasonings, such as Mrs. Dash, and sprinkle of Old Bay.  These turned out great!  Will make again.

Instead of baking these i threw them in a pan with olive oil and the spices. What a great side dish. Just enough heat but not too much that the kids could eat them. I'm a tough critic with potatoe dishes. Excellent job!

Boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe! I used red baby potatoes, cut them in half and they came out so creamy with great flavor and a nice kick of heat from the all the seasonings.  Roast them with Onions and Bell peppers.  They were the perfect side dish to my grilled shrimps.  Will make this again and again.

These turned out perfectly, nice and spicy. I left the skins on and only turned once halfway through cooking. Next time I would cut back on the oil a little bit. Thankyou Tamra.

These were great! I was short on time so I put the potatoes in the microwave for a bit first and then they only needed about 20 mins in the oven. Just used whatever potatoes I had lying around

I usually don't have much luck with potatoes.  This time it was a hit!  I used Russet's and used about 12 of them.  I put the oil and seasonings in a gallon ziplock bag which made the coating part easy.  I baked them on a cooking sheet.  Yum.  Yum Yum.

I was making the "Grilled Salmon with Avocado Dip" recipe on this site, and one of the reviewers suggested serving this as an accompaniment.  My husband loved these potatoes.  I didn't have shallots, but added some chopped onion.

My boyfriend and I made these as a side dish for grilled chicken and they were delicious! We are Texans so we love spicy food and this definitely hit the spot! We just wish we had greased the pan more because we think we lost some of the flavor.

I made these for my husband and I last night and they were very yummy! I had some plain russet potatoes that I needed to use up and I came across this recipe. I used the russet potatoes instead of the red potatoes the recipe called for and they ended up incredibly flavorful! The only other thing that I changed/modified was that I didn't use shallots because I didn't have them on hand. They got nice and crispy in the oven...I would keep an eye on them though. All ovens are different, and mine were perfect after about 25 minutes. They were great and we can't wait to have them again!

Made this today and absolutely loved it.  I'm struggling to find any way to improve this.  I might add a bit more cayenne next time for a bit more of a kick.  If I still made it as per the recipe I would still be thrilled with it.

All I can say is these potatoes rock!!! I followed the recipe (minus parsley) and made it into a vegetarian dinner treat with cheddar and eggs on top. Wow! Spicy and delicious. Definitely will make these again.

Yummy! I made these along side shrimp and corn on the cob.  There wasn't any left after dinner, and we usually always have leftover potatoes at our house.  Just be sure to thoroughly grease the pan!! It is a must!

I've been baking these for awhile now and they're so wonderful. Your neighbors will definitely smell these from outside. Nothing needs to be changed, it's great the way it is. If you want them cooked a little faster just cut it slightly thinner.

These were yummy and really easy. I didn't have cayenne pepper, which may have defeated the purpose, but it still tasted pretty good. I used 2 tsp of dried parsley and used 1 shallot on hand. I would consider cutting the oil down some. I made this in a corningware bowl so I wouldn't dirty up another dish. It browned up the sides, but wasn't too bad. I baked it for just over 30 minutes, stirring it at 15 minutes, and it turned out well.

I made this for mother's day. My MIL hates spicy stuff so I left out the cayenne and used regular potatoes. It was soooo good even without the spice although for my husband and I , Iwill keep it in. I did notice that I could have only cooked it for 40 minutes at 400 and it would have been fine.

This recipe is a great compliment to almost any entree!  It gets rotated into meals pretty often and I like that is uses olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  The smell when the potatoes are baking is amazing only overshadowed by the flavor when eating them.  I typically use more garlic and sometimes some steak seasoning just because that's my preference.  This recipe is perfect as is.  Okay, stop reading, go buy some potatoes and give it a try!!!

What am I doing wrong?  I baked these once at 350 (had meatloaf in the oven as well), and they turned out OK but all shriveled up.  Then tonight I made them at 450 and they burned after 35 minutes but were still kind of greasy, too.  Is it because I'm using russet potatoes?  Slicing them too thin?

I made these and can't stop eating them.  I used dried parsley and dried minced onions and yellow baking potatoes.  I cooked them with a chicken dish so the temperature I used was 350 degrees for about a hour.

Fabulous. I sometimes substitute the spices and use garam masala/curry instead.

Decent potatoes.  I don't know how "cajun" they tasted to me, though.

This recipe is Awesome!!! I loved the fact that they were so crispy and you can change the spices to suit the meal. I like it with parsley, garlic, dried minced onion, pepper and then I use sea salt fresh out of the oven. Yummy! Thanks!!! =)

these are a great side dish to burgers or meat. they have a spicy kick, but not too much.  i think they would be perfect dipped in ranch dressing, or something like that.

I'm always looking for a variety of ways to cook potatoes and I also love cajun flavors. I really did like them, except for I thought they were a ittle bland... I added more salt and they were decent but not "awesome". I'm still trying to figure out what else I need to add to get a tang or zing - or something.

I was making roasted chicken and needed a simple side dish, so i gave this a try!! prepared this just for myself, so i used three small potatoes and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. However, i added 2 garlic cloves, and next time i'm going to add even more (I'm a garlic lover!:)
I didn't have shallots since we never use them, so added 1TB of onions instead.
Great recipe!! thank you!!

I used Russets, medium to small, cut them into eighths so they were perfect large fry size.  Tinkered quite a bit with the spices based on what I had on hand and my kids' tastes.  Used a little cumin, seasoned salt, Cajun seasoning, Italian seasoning, pepper melange.  Cooked for the full 45 minutes, turning every 15 as directed.  After that, topped them with some shredded nacho cheese and put back in the oven for another three minutes.  Big hit with the kids, and I have to say I enjoyed them very much.  

This is fundamentally a fine recipe.  Toss them in oil and use a good mix of spices depending on what you like and you will be happy.

Made recipe exactly as written, and it ended up a little spicy for my taste. I'll make them again, but probably will use half the cayenne pepper.

Not bad, everyone seemed to like them. I did use onions flakes in place of the scallions. The potatoes had a nice spice to them, not too hot.

My husband loved it... my mom made it for breakfast the next morning... and my dad about grinned his face off (although he added Tapatio).  Only thing I will do different is cut the potatoes smaller so there is more flavor on less potatoe.  Also, it only took me 25 minutes worth of oven time, and I used a bit less oil.

I dont like potatoes very much but I made this for my husband (no way would my 3 and 4 year old boys try it) We both really liked them - I made them with ranch dressing as a dip and it was a hit.  Will make again  - I also followed the recipe exactly as listed *** 
Update - new review - my now 5 year old son loves these and I make them when ever I can - If I dont have shallots on hand I use diced onion instead
thanks for a great recipe

These were excellent. I will agree with the person who sugested to leave them in the oven for a extra 10-15 minutes to make them a little crispier. Will definately be making these more often.

These potatoes were an excellent side dish to our grilled burgers.  I used baking potatoes, since that's what I had on hand & they were great.  The only other change is that I used a tad less of the cayenne (we like some heat, but not burning!).  Overall, an excellent dish that I will make again.  Especially with the added bonus of the wonderful aroma that fills your house while these are baking!

I made this over the weekend.  I  followed the recipe exactly except using dried parsley flakes instead of minced fresh parsley.

It was excellent!  My sister and her hubby (both of whose cooking skills and culinary tastes put mine to shame) loved it.  My sister even asked for the recipie!

I'll definitely be making these again.  Great recipie!

I used the same amount of ingredients in this recipe for a single Jamaican yam... my mouth was burning. But I'll definitely do it again :). Probably half it for one large yam next time :P

These were great even without the cayenne pepper.  I did not have any on hand so I used a bit of extra paprika and plenty of crushed red pepper.  I found that they did not need to entire time to cook and were done in almost half.  However, it worked out nicely to turn off the oven and let them sit while everything else finished cooking.

I followed it exactly and it was delicious!! The only suggestion I have is to go less time than the 50 minutes. Next time, I will try the minimum suggestion of 40 minutes. Very good!

It was pretty good. I used small white potatoes so it took shorter time to cook.
keep an eye close so they don't burn because the garlic & shallots will be bitter.

These were great. I omitted all the seasonings and just used cajun seasoning adding up to the amount of seasoning stated in the recipe. It wasn't too spicy either. I will make these again.

These potatoes were great!  I cooked a little longer than stated because I like my potatoes to get a little more golden brown.  My sister in law which only eats potatoes in the form of unhealthy french fries loved these.  I made them with roasted pork tenderloin and cucumber salad....perfect!

This is an easy side dish for just about anything and my boyfriend loved them.  I baked these on a cookie sheet along with my meat dish at 350 for only 45 minutes and they turned out great.  I only used 1/8 cup of olive oil.  I was afraid there wasn't enough seasonings to coat the potatoes, but there was just the right amount.  The skins turned out crispy, the insides were soft and there was just the right amount of heat.

I made these last night and they were really good.  Next time I might add the shallots later because mine burned.  Otherwise it was a very good, very easy recipe to make.

Simple, yet delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I baked it for one hour because we like it on the crispy side and added a little garlic powder to heighten the garlic flavor. A definite keeper.

Great recipe!  I forgot to make these with dinner, so I made them right before going to bed.  Neither of us were in the mood for them, but they were so good we couldn't stay away.  I'm adding this to my recipe box!  I did end up following other reviewers and reduced the amount of oil, didn’t use shallots, and doubled the garlic.

AWESOME!  I made these for a dinner party with NY Strip steaks on the grill.  I set the number servings for 18 although we only had a group of 14.  The potatoes were still all GONE by the end of the meal.  We've made this for our family many times since and it's always a hit.

Instead of using the dry seasonings I used 1 tbsp of a commercial Cajun seasoning. Fantastic! Season these any way you want --it's the oil amount and the cooking time that make these perfect. I was worried they'd stick; they didn't. They were perfectly cooked through and good and crispy on the outside. Delicious and easy --a keeper.

This is the best potatoes recipe ever. This is my second time of making this and I made a couple modifications. I used onion powder instead of the shallot, and this is the crazy thing I did... I used tandoori seasoning  in place of all the other ingredients. It gave it a nice golden color and the taste was fabulous. My little girl found it a little spicy even though she really liked it but my husband and I could not have enough of it and this is why I am making it twice in a week. Thanks

These were a nice change from the regular roasted oven fries I make.  Oven fries can be a little bland sometimes, but, these had great flavor and the spice was just right for us.

This was a great recipe! I had all the ingredients on hand and it was fairly easy to prepare. I did dice the potatoes instead of cutting into wedges. They are slightly spicy (too spicy for my three year old) but you could adjust the amount of spice for your own preference.

I make a lot of roasted potatoes and I think these were the best I have ever made. I used approx 6 medium sized potatoes, I did not have shallots so I used a little bit of extra garlic and added in a couple of chopped green onions.  Highly recommended and definetely will make again!

I thought the flavor was delicious but a little too spicy for me.  I think it was user error, however.  I made the seasonings as suggested but only used half the portion of potatoes.  So, I think the potatoes had double the spice.  Oh well, you live you learn!  I'll definitely make this recipe again but with less seasoning.

These roasted potatoes are great!!!  I made fewer potatoes than the recipe called for (enough for my BF and I).  But, I reduced the serving number to 3 in the serving/scaling box and used that given amount of oil and spices because the more flavor the better for me!! ALSO: I cut the potatoes into wedges, then cut the wedges in half.  I ADDED SOME PETITE BABY CARROTS (regular baby carrots will work too) to the oil mixture. Before the first turning of the vegetables, I sliced up one MED YELLOW ONION (not too thin or they'll burn) and whipped up some more of the flavored oil to toss them in. I stirred them in during the first stirring/turning of the veggies. I cooked the mixture for a total of about 45-50 minutes, turning every 15 minutes. DELICIOSO!!!!

Delicious!! I changed it up a little- I added a tablespoon of melted butter to the oil, seasoned it with creole seasoning and a roasted garlic blend from McCormicks. Also, added a tad bit more fresh garlic and a dash of beef boullion granules to the mixture. After baking for 45 minutes, I broiled the potatoes for three minutes giving a crispier potato. I will make again.

I didn't have a great recipe for roasted potatoes.  Now I do!  I didn't have  shallots, fresh garlic or parsley so I used 3 green onions, 1 t. garlic powder and 1 T. parsley flakes (and added it  right in the mixture).  Added 15 minutes for extra crunch.  Really good, just right potato dish for so many recipes.  Thanks!

I didn't have any oil or shallots on hand so I used butter and elimated the shallots all together. They still turned out great. The Cajun powder gave the potoatoes a little kick without bothering those with sensitive stomachs. I will use this recipe again and again.

These are outstanding exactly as the reccipe is written. I put a little paper towel down on the bottom of the serving bowl though, to pick up some of the excess oil. Whenever I serve these potatoes, there are never any left over. This is the thing that the people at the table will pick at until they are gone, even when they are no longer hungry. That is always a good sign.

These potatoes are soooooo good! DH said to save this recipe and my son even wanted to know how to make them. We had them with "Rotisserie Style Chicken" from this site. Excellent meal and super easy.

These were fabulous!  I don't even normally like potatoes, but my fmily does, and I like spicy food  so I gave these a try!  Yummy!  I added extra garlic and chili powder and made them with small red potatoes and they turned out very crispy and delicious after 45 minutes in the oven.

Loved them!!! Nice and spicy and very easy to make. The only change is that I added the onions at the last 15 min so that they wouldnt burn.

I used yukon golds instead of reds and used Emeril's cajun spice blend instead of the individual spices.  Cooked 375 for a little over an hour tossing every so often so they got nice and crispy. Family loved!

These were good and everyone at my dinner party liked them but we also agreed that while they had heat, they didn't have as much spice/flavor as we would have liked. I think just a bit of garlic salt would do the trick.

Pretty good - very flavorful. Personally, I think I still prefer thinner, crunchier potatoes (more like fries) ... maybe I'll try a Cajun French Fry variation next time.

I will surely make these again when shallots are ready in my garden. I used just a couple of shakes of the cayenne and they had lots of heat. 1/2 tsp would be too much in my opinion. I also added a pinch of thyme. Very tasty.

I cooked these wraped in foil on a gas grill that was approx 350 degrees.  I used fingerling potatoes cut in quarters length wise and only cooked them for 20 minutes.  They didn't get crispy wraped in foil but were tasty.  If grilling and want crispy try just placing them on foil.

I made these tonight and my family LOVED them. I followed the advice of others and baked for almost an hour making them nice and crispy. I used a scant 1/4 tsp of cayenne and they really were not spicy at all to me, but I like spicy. I will definately make these again.

I am not a fan of potatoes, but these were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, making sure to turn the potatoes every 15 minutes, and everything was perfect. Next time I'll add a little more cayenne, as we're a fan of spicy foods, and a little more salt. I made these yesterday and am already making them again today.

Great recipe. I cut down the cayenne a bit because we are wimps with heat :) but it was wonderful. I did decrease the heat a bit on the oven, I think 400 would suffice for 45 minutes. Thanks!!

This was my first time to roast potatoes. They were tasty, but I gave them 3 stars because I only had to cook them for 25 minutes and they still came out burnt. The flavor was there, but way too spicy! My husband and I love heat, but I needed a lot to drink after eating them. I suggest cutting down on the cayenne pepper and grate the onion instead of chopping it. There were little burnt pieces of onion everywhere!

These potatoes are spicy, just the way I like it. I like putting on the parsley with about 10 minutes to go, to give it a little more subtle (than fresh) parsley taste.  Family seems to like it quite a bit, considering they come back for thirds.

Really tasty potatoes!  I used only 1/2 the amount of cayenne and it was just right for us.  Next time I'll cut the oil down some because they were a little too oily.

Very good idea, but too spicy and not enough salt. I would say use 1/4 or 1/2 the cayenne. Add 5tsp of salt, 4-5 cloves of garlic, and 1 full onion. I also added a little butter at the very end which made them a lot better.

Wow; these were great; now my new favorite potato. I followed the recipe exactly except I added more cayenne pepper. I don't have a roasting pan, so I used a large air-bake sheet (with sides). I baked them for probably 50 minutes. They were starting to blacken a bit (which was awesome). We dipped these in Ranch. Sour cream was good, too. Definitly a keeper!

I tried these on three friends tonight, and we all loved them.  They were spicy without being overwhelming and really easy to make.  I had to keep them in the oven longer than the recipe called for, but I'm not sure how long it ended up being because we had to adjust the oven temp for the chicken.  I'll definitely make this often.  Thank you!

I mixed sweet and regular potatoes as someone else suggested, and they were fabulous.  I took them to a cookout and they were one of the first dishes finished. These will become a regular staple at my house.

I made these last night for my boyfriend and I for a sort of make shift dinner. They were so good and easy. The only thing I did differently was I added steak seasoning to the potatoes so I wouldn't have to measure out the salt, pepper, and all that jazz. I also meant to add the garlic but I totally forgot. They were delicious anyway. My boyfriend absolutely loved them!

I sliced some thin like potatoe chips.  The larger the slices the less time you have to spend flipping them.  I also doubled the spices but kept the amount of oil the same.  And for quick clean up I baked them on parchment paper so I didn't have to wash the cookie sheet.

Wow!  These were fantastic!  Very easy to make.  I used russet potatoes because that is what I had.  I put in just over half of the cayenne pepper the recipe calls for because I was feeding a 6 year old.  I'm glad I did.  If I had put in 1/2 tsp, they would have been way too spicy for everyone.  I also didn't have any shallots, so I used dried onion flakes (I let them soak in the olive oil for a few minutes before mixing the rest of the ingredients).  I headed the warnings of others and used less oil and watched cooking time.  I think I ended up cooking mine about 40 min.  They turned out perfect- some a little crispy on the edges, some soft throughout.  I will make these again and again!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  As other raters suggested, watch the time, mine cooked faster than anticipated.  Last time we made without cajun spices and used Old Bay seasoning (omit salt).  Either way, they came out great.

Will make again for sure.  WATCH THE TIME.
I have a convection oven, set it for 400 and checked at 30 min.  They were VERY dark brown.  They still tasted good.  Will watch the time more closely next time.  I am sure they will be even better next time.

These were very good. I used russet potatoes and cut them thinner so they would be more crispy.  (I used six potatoes).  Baked them at 450 for 40 minutes and they were very good. Only reason I didnt give them 5 stars is I would have liked to have tasted the seasoning a bit more.

When I first pulled these out of the oven I thought "ok, they're pretty good, but I don't understand what the hype is about." About an hour later, after I single-handedly COMPLETELY FINISHED the TWO pans I had intended to be for a BBQ, I decided the recipe lived up to the hype. :)
Delicious.

These were a hit at dinner.  They are not spicy at all and next time I will add more spice to them.  And I can't even tolerate too spicy food.  Everyone wanted the recipe for these.  Made exactly as stated.

Great recipe, but the time is WAY off.  Instead of 45-50 minutes this only needs to be in the oven for about 20-25.

Fantastic recipe.  Followed it exactly, but cut down on cayenne since my wife isn't into spicy foods as much as I am.  They came out great.

This is one of my favorite potatoe recipes from this site.  I have made them several times. Sometimes I cut down the spice, and they still have a lot of flavor!  They go great with the Slow-Cooked Texas-Style Beef Brisket on this site!

Delicious! Even my picky husband liked them. I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dried. The potatoes had just the right amount of spice and they were soft on the inside with a little crisp on the ouside.

This was very good. The only thing I would suggest is adding the shallots maybe halfway through the baking time. My shallots were on the burned side.  Other than that, great recipe!  Kids ate them with ranch dressing to cut down on the spicy taste!

I used Russet potatoes and they started falling apart. Next time will use red potatoes instead. I used 1 small fresh onion chopped fine instead of the scallots and I used 1 tsp garlic powder instead of the garlic clove and also 2 tsp dried parsley instead of fresh. My husband and I absolutely loved them. He told me to keep this receipe in my file to make again and that was high praise indeed as he is a very picky eater. One of the best receipes I found for oven potatoes.

These were amazing and surprisingly easy to make. They filled the house with their amazing aroma!! I did not change anything except adding some extra garlic. I roasted them for an extra 15 minutes to get a nice crisp on the outside. These potatoes go great the with Tex-Mex Burger with Cajun Mayo recipe from this website!

I love this recipe! I have used all types of potatoes and usually dice them - they cook faster. I add more hot spice(cayenne) and have even used chili flavoured olive oil. Never goes wrong and very, very tasty!

Pretty good, but nothing spectacular. I doubled everything except the oil and peppers, and it still needed some more salt. The kids appreciated these super soft spuds.

Hubby loved these.  I liked these a lot but they were a tad spicy for me (but lived up to their Cajun name). I used russets and roasted them for 35 minutes and they were perfect.

These potatoes were delicious.  The shallots caramelized a bit during cooking and that just added to it.  The "kick" from the spices was just right.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent.  The only thing I would change next time is a little less cayenne pepper for my 3 year old.  But they were perfect for the adults.

My new favorite potato! 
I used a small onion in place of shallots. I turned the temp to 375 and cooked for 45 minutes. I didn't have any farlic so I used garlic powder. 
They were awesome!

good recipie. I added parmesan chesse and discovered that 45 minutes in the oven was a little too long. These were done in about 30 minutes. I also sprinkled some of the spices over the wedges after tossing them in the oil mixtre. Hubby enjoyed them.

My fiancee and I both loved these!!  I'm concerned about the amount of oil that goes into them, so maybe they'll be just a "once in a while" side :)  I might go a little lighter on the cayenne next time though.  It was good, but got to be a tad spicy after we had eaten a few.

This is a great recipe that is easy to make.  I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used a teaspoon of dried Italian Herbs instead and it turned out fine.  We had these with a grilled NY Strip Steak for a perfect dinner.

I made this for a cooking class and loved it. Even my grandmother, as intolerant as she is to to pungent spices, agreed it was good. I sometimes add a sprinkling of parmesan to the recipe.

Mmmmm ... nice and spicy!  The only change I made was to cut the potatoes in small cubes instead of long strips, and cooked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  Excellent!

Very good, but I had to make a few adjustments, that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I only needed about 2-3 tbsp of oil - a whole quarter cup would have created a greasy product.  I also only used 1/4 tsp cayenne and they were still pretty spicy.

I also used cajun seasoning spice, extra 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I sprayed the pan with cooking spray.  It was delicious.

These potatoes are awesome.  I had to change a few things due to lack of ingredients on hand.  I firstly used yukon gold potatoes and kept the skins on.  They worked very well.  I also didn't have any parsley so I just omitted it.  I also didn't have any shallots so I used onion flakes.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.  The outcome was deliciously crispy potatoes and a tender middle with great cajun spice.

Fantastic as is.  Make sure you chop your shallots (or onions, which ever you're using) really small, as the first time i made mine, they were a little burnt.  This is an excellent recipe and its a go-to when i dont have much on hand.  Thank you!

I made a few adjustments for this: regular onion, onion salt instead of reg, and added 1/2 t. of hot sauce and a couple of teaspoons of thyme.  Overall, I thought this recipe was outstanding.  So far this is the best roasted potatoes recipe I've found on this site.

This was very, very good, and very, very easy! Only change I made was adding more salt after they were done, and out of the oven. Thanks! OH, and I didn't have green onions, so I used some basil instead...great flavor.

I liked the "Booyah Potatoes" comment below, so I decided to give these a try.  My husband said they were the best potatoes I've ever made.  With the disclaimer that I'm not much of a cook, I still think this recipe deserves 5 stars.  It was just right around my tolerance level for spicy.  But then, we can't go wrong with anything that's pepper, pepper, and garlic in this family.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I prepared this in two separate pans.  In the one for my husband and myself, I followed the recipe exactly.  In the other one, for the kids, I omitted the black pepper and red pepper.  (Both came out delicous.)  Other than needing a tad more salt at the end, it was absolutely perfect!!  Thanks for sharing this restaurant quality dish!

AWESOME describes these.  I wanted to make something a little different for Christmas Eve dinner to go with my husbands steaks, so I decided to try these and it was worth the risk.  Everyone asked for the recipe, which just goes to show that they really did love them.

We really liked these. I followed the recipe exactly, although I added a little bit more parsley while tossing everything together- maybe a total of 3 tbsp. I found it easier to cover my baking sheet with aluminum foil, then greased it with a little olive oil, to make for easier clean up. Flipping these can be a little tricky, so be careful- otherwise they were very easy to make and were a great complement to the meal. I'm looking forward to experimenting with other types of flavors!

I used russet potatoes and cut them into wedge-like fries and baked them on a greased cookie sheet.  Turned out quite well but I had to lower the temperature to 350 degrees and toss them every 15-20 minutes or else they burned.  Shallots always turned out burned however I cooked them so I just brushed them off before serving.  Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the shallot problem.  Update: I used sweet potatoes and yams for this recipe and it turned out great!

I make this recipe ALL the time! It's wonderful and I HIGHLY reccomend.  You can also eaily just use steak seasoning on them instead of all other seasonings.

My kids have a limited diet because they are on a diet for Autism where they cannot have gluten or dairy.  This is fast, easy and tastes delicious.  You can even use yellow potatoes, vegetable oil...whatever spices you have and it comes out great.  This is one recipe that I am super glad I found.

Outstanding!  I subbed some Essence that I had on hand from when I made a huge batch of it, and I was afraid it would be too spicy, but with some blue cheese for dipping my kids (2&4) ate it up!!!  Every time I have ever tried to roast potatoes they would get stuck all over my pan and make a mess, but these didn't.  A keeper!

These are SO good! I didn't have any paprika or shallots, so for the paprika, I put in a little extra cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes. For the shallots I put in equal parts garlic and onion powder about 1/2 tsp each. They were quite spicy, so I'm definitely going to buy some paprika, but they were still very good. We also did it with russets because we didn't have any red potatoes. Thanks for the good recipe!

I used Russet potatoes instead of red and added an extra clove of garlic. These were SO GOOD! I don't know if I didn't use the full amount of potatoes, but these were perfectly spiced. I suggest others who said it didn't have enough flavor to double the spices or use less potatoes. These were great with a little bit of sour cream on the side! Oh, and I only used a tablespoon of oil. Perfect!

Pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly but I lowered the temp to 350 so I could roast the potatoes along with a chicken. It took about 1 1/2 hours and the timing was perfect, they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I thought they were a little bland, next time I'll add a couple more cloves of garlic and some cumin. My husband said they were better with gravy on them. Still, a good basic recipe to start from.

Used about 4-5 potatoes, as there is only enough oil to properly coat this amount.  Poured remaining oil into the bottom of foil-covered roasting pan, and rubbed wedges with that oil each time I turned them over.  Very very flavorful recipe!

The neighbors raved about how good the potatoes tasted. I only made a few substitutions. I used only 1tsp salt and 1tsp I used the All Seasons seasoning salt. I didn't have shallots so I used 1 T of dried minced onions. Wonderful recipe and full of flavor! No one can say this was bland. :)

I made these potatoes as a side for a rotisserie pork roast.  The potatoes were EXCELLENT(they got a better review than my roast!!!).  They had just the right amount of "kick" and they were actually quite crispy...just like I love them.  I will definitely make those over and over again!!!

My family loves spicy Cajun food, and this recipe didn't disappoint us!  Can be altered to suit your own tastes easily!  Very quick and easy to throw together at the last minute when grilling chicken or steaks.
