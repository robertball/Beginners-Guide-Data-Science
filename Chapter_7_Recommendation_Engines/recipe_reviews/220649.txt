My family loves sweet hush puppies with corn so this recipe was right up our alley!  I did add a little flour to thicken the batter and I left out the cayenne (for my little ones).  I will use this recipe again but I will cut it in half.  The yield was way too much for us.

this is a decent recipe. it's a little soupy, which is why i gave it a 3 star.  you have to be careful when putting it in the oil. 

i did things a little different, i upped the spices (all of them) to give it more flavor and i also added some corn starch to thicken it. but you can also you flour. 

over all it turned out pretty good and i think i will definitely be using this hush puppy recipe again.

We loved this with adjustments - cut in half to 1 box jiffy mix, 1/4 cup buttermilk instead of the canned milk, Used can of whole Kernel sweet corn (drained) or 1 cup frozen whole kernel sweet corn works great too, 1 tsp for all seasonings, replaced Cayenne pepper with Weber Cajun Seasoning.  2nd batch tried it with Weber Lemon Herb seasoning **delish** my son couldnt get enough of them. We also used this recipe as a base and increased the buttermilk to thin and make a batter for fried zucchini, which was a huge hit. Definitely a keeper recipe.

These were amazing! Neither myself nor my husb care for hush puppies but we loved these that we made to go with our fish fry.  Guests loved them too.  Because others said the batter was too runny (and it was), I left out an egg (I used 2 large ones) and used 1/2 c. milk.  I added flour  till it was the right consistency, about 1 to 1-1/2 c.  I will make these again even if I am not having a fish fry!  This made quite a few using a small cookie scoop and cooked up to golf ball sized.  You could easily half the recipe.

I did take another reviewer's suggestion and add a little flour to thicken the batter (I didn't measure, I just added until it was the consistancy I was looking for)--it was quite wet without the additional flour. I also threw in a few chopped green onions. Very easy to prepare, the hardest part about it was the frying and not because it was hard, only time consuming. We used this as a side for Ham Bone Chowder as "dippers"--NO leftovers.

The corn really makes this recipe! My kids were eating them as fast as I could make 'em! I did alter it just a bit since I do not use mixes, hence I grabbed my fav cornbread recipe and just mixed up the dry ingredients, which included 1/4 c. sugar. From there, I followed this, except that I also omitted the cayenne. I used melted coconut oil to take the guilt out of frying. Tasted great! Will be making this again!

As written, these are too wet to hold their shape in the oil (I tried, lol), so adding some flour to the mix to thicken it up is the perfect remedy (for a 1/2 recipe I think I added between 1/3 and 1/2 cup flour, but judge for yourself)! These are VERY tasty and light, just like proper hush puppies should be, IMO. I did halve the recipe, but still used 1 teaspoon each of the garlic and onion powders, which gave these great flavor. I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I like them, but they do need some extra flour, as others commented.

The batter was WAY too runny.  I got very few balls of dough.  Most of it hit the oil and fell apart.  Tasted good but lots of little pieces of dough.

Following he recipe exactly left me with a very loose, soupy batter. I had to add almost whole cup of flour, which threw off the seasoning and left me with very bland results. Also, using jiffy mix and canned corn made for very sweet hush puppies, which isn't really to my liking.

They were a little gritty for my liking, but a good recipe when you are in a pinch!

Yum!  Loved these but you definitely want to follow review suggestions to add flour and double the spices.  You probably also want to half the recipe unless you're making for a crowd; this yields a ton!  I fried mine in coconut oil for a healthier alternative and they were delicious.

First time making hush puppies and this was the recipe to start with.  I would like to know how to get them in the ball shape.  Mine were more like globs, but the family loved them.
