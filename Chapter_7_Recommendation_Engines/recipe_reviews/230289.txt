I just made these for a baby girl shower.  Very good.   I didn't dip in chocolate, nor did I use peppermint extract.  I did dip dough balls in crushed peppermint before I put them on the Cooke sheet.   I would make these again.  Watch the time.  Mine were done in about 7-7.5 minutes.  Depends on your oven.

I cut the recipe in half and didn't add peppermint extract or the chocolate chips simply because I didn't have them on hand. Also, instead of using shortening I used almond oil. They turned out very well...they ended up baking for about 10 minutes total. They tasted very good and both my roommate and I love them! I will definitely be making these again!

I left out the peppermint extract and red food coloring. I also just made like regular chocolate chip cookies and didn't roll into balls or press down with a glass.  They baked fine. The candy cane bits will stick to the cookie sheet so after the first pan I did use PAM to grease it each time. They do need to set for awhile before you take them off the sheet. One review said they had to bake them longer because they were gooey. I didn't bake longer. I just let them sit on the pan for a good while before trying to remove them. They are really delicious! We were out of candy canes so I used 24 starlight mints. Very yummy!

I made the dough, added the white chocolate chips, then took a small scoop of dough and dipped one side of it in crushed candy canes.  We loved them!   Next time I will add a bit more flour...maybe 1/4 cup.

I've baked lots of cookies in my oven but these took forever to bake.  At 10 min they were really gooey so I baked 2 min. more and took them out thinking they would bake a little more.  They were not done. Made second batch smaller, but with the same result so I baked them longer.  They got really crispy then.  They don't taste too bad except for the first gooey ones.  Not sure I'll go to all that trouble again.
