This was wonderful! Don't be afraid because the canadian bacon doesn't fit right in the muffin tins....they'll cup up while cooking & form a perfect bowl for the egg mixture. I just sprayed the muffin tins w/ Pam instead of greasing & I didn't have fresh bell pepper so I subbed canned roasted red pepper instead. (I added them to the onions after they were sauteed.) After 12 minutes of baking, we topped them w/ some smoked provolone cheese & baked for 3 more minutes. The yolks were almost cooked through...just slightly runny, which is just the way I like them. The presentation of these is great...they were so pretty. I used a cake spreader to lift them up out of the tins & then I topped them w/ fresh chives. I served them w/ halved grapefruit w/ sugar & Blood Marys. It was the perfect Sunday morning brunch...thanks!

QUICK AND EASY..I LEFT OUT THE PEPPERS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND DOESNT LIKE THEM...I ALSO WISKED THE EGGS IN A BOWL AND POURED THEM IN THE CUPS..I SPRINKLED A LITTLE CHEESE THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF BAKING.

Awesome for breakfast or brunch!  Yummy.  Instead of greasing I used Pam, used frozen pepper strips and my biggest hint is instead of muffin pan I used ramkins so that the canadian bacon fit.  It worked like a charm.

Wonderful!!  If you make 4 approx. 1" cuts equally spaced and perpendicular to the edge of the bacon, it will fit nicely into the muffin tin without popping up.

Perfect for SBD.  Adjusted slightly, mostly in size of dish.  Used a large ramekin (6oz) and used red pepper, onion, shallot & mushroom for the veggie mixture (though it could hold a lot more veggies when done in a ramekin).  Also used two eggs (beaten) mixed with shredded cheddar cheese for the topper.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent & easy.  I didn't have canadian bacon on hand, so I used thinly sliced smoked deli ham.  Also added cooked mushroooms, spinach, and 1 tsp minced garlic.  Topped the egg with shredded cheddar cheese.  Next time, I will probably add a very thin slice of tomato, too!  YUMMMMMMMMMMMM

This was really good and pretty simple. My changes were from the advice of others, whisking the eggs before adding, including mushroom w/peppers, and a touch  of cheese. But I did have enough to make 6 muffins. Hope this helps...they are really worth trying!

These were so tasty, I fixed them for brunch this weekend and everyone loved them including my brother-in-law and his wife who are professional chefs by trade.  They both raved about them.  I served them with hashbrowns with bellpepper and onion, fresh fruit tray, and lemon raspberry muffins. I can't wait to make these again.  The only change that I made to them was I put a little shredded pepperjack cheese on them just as they came out fo the oven. Excellent recipe A++++++++++++++

Great recipe for a small group.  I made them even easier by just scrambing eggs with a touch of heavy cream and tossing in some dried dill and dried chives, no peppers or shallots on hand.  I'll try with fresh herbs next spring, but I'll be quite satisifed with my dried mixture until then.

This is a great recipe! I modified it a bit buy using 1/2 egg substitute and 1/2 real eggs and scrambling all together before putting in the muffin tins and adding low fat cheddar on top. They even reheat well which was a concern for me. The substitue made them really light and fluffy and my family loved them!

I altered this recipe to fit the tastes of my family. I placed half slice of bologna in the muffin tin, poured my beaten egg (mixture of pinch of grated cheddar and 1 egg) mixture in the tin and topped with grated cheddar.  I did the same with bacon and even with mushrooms. Kids and adults all loved this recipe.

MMMMMMM I don't do the diet, i just cook the food. and i LOVE these so much. I don't even like bell peppers but they turn all sweet and juicy on the bottom when you cook them like this. I simplify the recipe though (skip the shallot, herbs, salt, pepper, frying).  first, spray a muffin tin with non-sticker. If you aren't too lazy, it's nice to fry the bacon a little bit so it will crispy. chop up the green and red peppers and put them straight in the muffin tins. insert the bacon (i use chicken bacon) around the edge, then crack an egg on top.  bake in the oven for like, 30-40 min, depending on how hard you like the egg (or how long you forget about them, or how eager you are to get them out).  devour.

Great low carb breakfast.  I don't even put the veggies in, we just like the egg baked in the canadian bacon cup.

This recipe is great for the South Beach diet.  It's flavorful and unique.  I've substituted the Canadian bacon with an extra lean turkey bacon, to cut down on the fat-- and it worked out well.

great recipe but takes a little work. I used asperagas tips as well. They made great little handles to pull the cups out of the tins but the tips get crispy if you don't coat them in butter before baking

I made this for the first time today and loved it. I did have to cook the eggs a little longer because the whites weren't setting up, and as a result the yolks were hard. But it was still good. I made a mock hollandaise sauce (South Beach Diet book recipe) and served it on top. I may just make a regular hollandaise sauce using Smart Balance Spread instead of butter. It's good for you :).

Delicious! I added a bit more pepper than called for in the recipe because I like lots of veggies. I also added some shredded cheese between the veggies and the eggs. Perfect breakfast for the SBD.

For a "diet" recipe - these are pretty good and very filling. I would recommend doing something to add a little more flavor.. maybe add tomato or some fat-free cheese? Worth making again and again.

These are OK. The eggs are a little bit rubbery. I think next time I will just scramble them like usual and serve the Canadian bacon on the side. The best thing about them is their low-carb qualities.

This is a wonderful breakfast. I beat my egg first before putting it into the "cup", as I only likes my eggs that way. Flavourful, delicious... one of my favourite breakfasts!

These are soooo good! I may fail often with diets (okay, all the time *G*), but I continue to use this recipe. I bought a ramekins to cook it in. Much easier to clean than a muffin tin. Thanks!

Love it, love it, and love it!  I've told multiple family members and friends about this great recipe.  It's a great combination of various food groups (egg, meat, veggies), and very tasty.  This has become a regular weekend breakfast.  It does take some time to prepare/cook, so I don't make it on weekdays.  Get a food chopper, though, and you'll cut your time in half.

I was making these before I started South Beach.  I found a microwave egg cooker that is suitable for cooking poached style eggs.  My husband and I have been having these baked eggs every morning before going to work - cooked in the microwave.  Very good indeed!

I did not like this.  I made a couple of them w/cheese for my husband.  I added a handful of shredded low-fat cheese on top prior to baking.  Those were a little better.  But I definitely would not make these again.

definitly easy to put together and bake. i had to tear the canadian bacon in half to get it to sit down in my muffin tin, but the egg filled in the hole and made it one piece. i liked the over-easy style egg that came out of the oven. easy to reheat and have for a quick breakfast.

AWESOME.  Used English bacon.  The tip on cutting slits works well, two slits in the non-streaky part made it lie down peacefully.

BTW do not think because bacon is fatty that this won't stick.  You still need to oil the pan a little.

Such an easy breakfast to make that has no carbs, is healthy and can impress your loved one(s) with little work.  I make a slice in each piece of canadian bacon and then overlap the ends (to look like a shallow cone) so that it fits in my muffin tins better.  Don't worry if the egg seems to fall through - it will all bake nicely.  I also scramble my eggs and use egg whites sometimes.

Great idea but I couldn't get the Canadian bacon to stay in the bottom of the cups heehee so I improvised.  I pretty much made a "souffle"  layers of bacon and then poured the egg mixture on top and cooked at 400 degrees until done.

We loved this recipe! We are starting out on the South Beach diet and this idea for breakfast is a keeper! I also just sprayed the baking tin with cooking spray and I omited the onion (because I do not like them).
