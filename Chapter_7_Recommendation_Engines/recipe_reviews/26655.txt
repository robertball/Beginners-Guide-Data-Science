These are yummy!  Prep takes a little time but it's not difficult at all (my 8 yr old 
daughter helps make the meatballs) and the results are worth it!  I've made this twice, 
the second time leaving out only the green pepper (I used a little extra onion to help 
make up the volume of the missing ingredient) at the request of my husband and it 
was still great!  I also made more sauce because my husband loves it, and he's NOT
a sour cream fan!  I used 3 cans of golden mushroom, a 16 oz container of sour cream,
an 8 oz package of fresh mushrooms sliced and about 3/4 cup of milk.  I also add a
little garlic & onion powder to the sauce to jazz it up, and leave out the salt because
it seems unnecessary with all that soup.  This is something I know I'll be making for
years

This is a good recipe.I just put my own little touches to my families taste.I did not have any bread crumbs so I made my own bread crumbs by toasting a few slices then placing them in my chopper and just added some italian seasoning.I also added worchestershire sauce and garlic powder to the meat.For the sauce I used 3 cans of cream of mushroom,1 large can sliced mushrooms,about 1 1/2 cups milk,1 tbsp kitchen bouqet and then some salt,pepper,onion and garlic powder.After baking the meetballs for about 30 min. I used paper towels to remove drippings off the meatballs then I placed them in a 9x13 dish,completely covered them with the sauce and baked about 45 min.Served over egg noodles. Turned out really good I will be making this again and again.

Very good flavor! I made the meatballs and then put them in a crockpot with the sauce for about 4 hrs. (I didn't add the sour cream until the last 1/2 hr.) The sauce was very rich, almost too rich, and a little thicker than I am used to. I think next time I will try less sour cream and possibly water instead of milk. Overall, excellent!..my boyfriend loved them.

Call me crazy, but I wasn't impressed.  I think I will try again and add a little of the soup to the meat mixture, also add some garlic powder, as far as the sauce, I will totally leave out the browning sauce and add an envelope of dry onion soup mix.

I must admit I was a bit skeptical but I was in a pinch and had all ingredients on hand. I followed the directions to a tee and it came out wonderfully! Very quick and easy! I will definitely be adding this to the recipe box. Thanks!

DRY!!!!  Either half the meatball recipe OR double the soup recipe. The flavor is good, but this recipe really needs more sauce.

THIS RECIPE WAS EASY TO MAKE.  I ADDED A LITTLE GARLIC AND SEASONING SALT TO ADD A LITTLE MORE FLAVOR AND THEY WERE DELICIOUS. I ALSO USED 1LB GROUND TURKEY AND 1LB GROUND BEEF.  MY FAMILY ENJOYED THEM. WILL MAKE AGAIN

Made this for the Eagles/ Redskins game. Nobody was impressed- very little got eaten. Everyone kept saying it was "missing something". Meatballs were not very flavorful (and this was AFTER I added extra seasonings to the meat), and gravy/sauce was bland. If I make this again, and that's a big IF, I would def have to changes things up. OH well, at least the Redskins won!

These meatballs were the BOMB! I was looking for a quick meal to cook in about 30 minutes or less and this worked well. The only difference is that I used the frozen meatballs instead of making them from scratch. All in all, these were yet delicious!

Very good recipe.  Added a bit of minced garlic to the meatball mixture and the sauce mixture.  Didn't have browning sauce so I subbed worsey sauce.  Family loved.

I followed this recipe as written and had high hopes but for me the taste of the sauce was bland - my grade school boys did not like at all.

This recipe is the bomb. Best mushroom sauce ever. If you are in a hurry (or just feeling too lazy), you can use frozen meatballs. I took this too work and now everyone thinks I am some kind of gourmet chef.

We love this recipe! I didn't have browning sauce so I used beef soup base (about 2 teas.) and thought they were very good. Omitted the salt. I've also made the meatballs for sub sandwiches with spaghetti sauce and put them in my sphagetti! Maybe some people overcook them. They are a little dense, but I think just right. Maybe fresh breadcrumbs would help! I'll be making these often. They have alot more flavor than swedish meatballs!

This was really good for how simple it is. We enjoyed this dish and I served this with wide egg noodles. I didn't have mushrooms so what was in the soup is all there was. I only added half the browning sauce called for. Not too fancy, but good food and easy to do. Thanks!

The meatballs were kinda dense, probably because no liquid was required. They were good, but dry & dense. I did not care for the taste of the sauce. I thought the browning flavor(I used Kitchen Bouquet) was too strong. Will not make this again. There are better meatball recipes to be found on this site.

Good! Definitely rich, creamy comfort food. I would certainly omit the browning sauce next time, as it seemed to add more salt than anything. I halved the meatballs, but kept the amount of sauce the same. My only complaint besides the uber-saltiness of the dish was that the sauce was a bit too thick. This definitely has potential of being a repeat dish for us with a few tweaks! Thanks :)

This was great! Kind of like Beef Stroganoff but easier! We do Monday meatball madness and this was a nice change from always having spaghetti. I didn't have any of the Kitchen Bouquet so I used 1 tsp. of Worcester sauce and it was great. I also left out the GP's because my husband cant have them and just had more onion. I also leave out the extra salt sicne there is enough in the soup already. I add the baked meatballs to the ixture in my slow cooker and leave it in there on the lowest setting till we are ready to eat. We have had this twice now once serving it over egg noodles and the other over rice.

The meatballs were great! Except I made a few changes. I took out the browning sauce out all together, and instead I added 2 tablespoons of chili powder, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg. Also, in the actual meatballs I added another teaspoon of nutmeg. The whole family absolutley loved it. I will definitley be making this recipe again!

I've made this several times and it's become a family favorite.  I don't use the browning sauce because I don't keep any but follow everything else exactly.  This is really good over egg noodles, kinda like a psuedo stroganof.

Very tasty quick main dish.  I used frozen Italian meatballs to save time. I made the basic sauce, but I also added a pkg of dried Beefy Onion Soup instead of the browning sauce. I squeezed a large wedge of lemon to the sauce to add acidity and sprinkled in a medley of Italian herbs. I heated the frozen meatballs in the baking dish for about 30 minutes, poured the sauce over all and baked another 30 minutes more until all was bubbly.  I served it over tripolini pasta noodle nests with a Greek salad and crusty bread.

husband loved it. I added chives, parsley and splash of apple wood smoke sauce and worchestershire sauce to the meatballs.  omitted bell peppers bc didn't have any.  I also used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  Sauce was done in 20 minutes in oven.  watch so it doesn't burn.

Ok so I cheated a little... I used about 9 frozen meatballs for this, which I heated in the oven.  I skipped steps 2 and 3.  Because I cut the recipe in half, I put it all in a 8x8.  I also ran out of sour cream, so I subbed in a little mayo.  I also added in some sweet red pepper, which I lightly sauteed beforehand, to give the dish some crunch.  Next time I'll put even more peppers in, because it was a good addition.  I skipped the salt entirely because I felt there was plenty in the meatballs and soup.  I served mine over homemade mashed red potatoes.  I'd definitely make this again!

I made a couple of changes based on other reviews.  Increased the sauce X3 - used 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, 1 can cream of mushroom and a packed of onion soup mix.  Then added 3/4 cup of milk - threw it all in the crockpot with some frozen meatballs I had bought on sale.  Added a pint of sour cream at the end and served over egg noodles and spaetzle - delicious.  A great basis for an easy weeknight crockpot recipe.  Thanks!

Good basic recipe ... Elevated by omitting green pepper but add 2 minced garlic cloves. Also used 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound of ground pork to keep meatballs moist. Whisk together 1/4 cup catsup with 2 eggs and mix in meat mixture. For sauce I Used cream of mushroom soup (2 cans) . Add 1/4 cup Brandy to add flavor to sauce. (Optional) Bake meatball on foil covered pan for easy clean up for 30 minutes then add meatballs and sauce to cast iron Dutch oven and bake 1 hour at 300 degree. Spectacular over mashed potatoes.  Makes about 40 small meatballs.

My rating is for the sauce only, since I used pre-made meatballs as a shortcut. 

I really liked the sauce.  It is similar to Beef stroganoff sauce.  It was tasty and creamy, even with low fat sour cream and skim milk.  

To bring out the flavor in the mushrooms, I suggest lightly sauteeing them in butter before adding to the rest of the sauce.

I have been looking for this meatball recipe. My husband had these as a kid at a friends and wanted me to try to make them. He said they were perfect. I used frozen meatballs and subsituted cream of chicken for one of the cans of mushroom soup. (I only had one can) Thanks so much I am sure I will be making these often.

I used Cream of Celery and Cream of Mushroom w/roasted garlic soups (one each)(that's all I had), used really good frozen (comercial) meatballs. Added some onion powder and good (drinkable not cooking stuff) dry sherry. I only went 4 stars cuz I broke the rule.  I changed things before I made it the first time.
Will definetly make it again .. new hubby liked it!  I too used Kichen bouquet ... maybe the good sherry counter acted the acidity ... Enjoy!

I used this recipe only for the meatballs (not the sauce) because I was looking for a good basic meatball recipe.  The results were just what I wanted.  The meatballs were perfect, and my spaghetti dinner was a hit.  Now, I will make them again so I can try out this mushroom sauce!  Thanks:)

Everyone LOVED these. I served over medium egg noodles. Froze what little leftovers I had in a zip lock freezer bag.  Reheated wonderfully. Tasted like beef strogonoff.  A definate keeper.

Fantastic. Easy prep. Meatballs delicious, but the star is the sauce. Omg. I'd bet you could put this on almost anything and it would improve. And both are so easy to make, the meatballs and the sauce. A culinary beginner could pull this off. I think every mushroom lover should try it and I will definitely be making this again.

Made it for dinner tonight and it was very good. And to those who rate it low, who haven't even made it, but are rating it on "how it looks" or "it's poor nutrition" should be ashamed of themselves! My goodness the internet has sure allowed a lot of really mean-spirited people to post unwarranted and rude comments!

Wonderful!  I added waterchestnuts and garlic to the meatballs and decreased the cooking time to 15 minutes, then 20 minutes in the sauce.  This cured the "dryness" problem. My happy little family loved them!

My husband loved this.  I used a chopper to chop the green pepper and onion, really fine. For the meatballs.  I also, took the advise of others and made more sauce.  I used 3 cans of soup.  Plus, I added a dash of worchestershire, along with garlic.

This is a great meatball recipe.  I hesitated to make this because it sounded like a lot of work, but it really wasn't.  Definately better than using frozen meatballs!  My friend's mother makes the best meatballs, and I've been asking for her recipe for years, but this is the closest that I've found so far!
The meatballs are also good coated with your favorite marinara sauce for spagetti too.

I used frozen meatballs so it made the receipe easier.  I baked the meatballs for about 30 minutes and then pat them dry.  Made the sauce and poured them over the meatballs and baked.  My family loved it over pasta.  My son, who is a picky eater liked.
Definitely will make again.  Cathy Helms

This was excellent!!!  I used frozen meatballs and just madeup the mushroom
sauce, which was incredibly tasty.  I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I used a half of a 
block of cream cheese and it was equally fabulous!!  Thanks for sharing this one, Jen!

THE MEATBALLS WERE GOOD, BUT I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE SAUCE.  NEXT TIME I MAY TRY USING CREAM OF MUSHROOM AS OPPOSED TO GOLDEN MUSHROOM SOUP.

Meatballs are spot ON in flavor. Interchangeable sauces make this stretch. I tripled the recipe and froze the meatballs in bags for future meals.  This mushroom sauce is so rich and magical... Whip up some smooth Yukon Gold mashed potatoes and serve alongside. The ultimate comfort food! Thanks for the recipe! I made NO changes.

This was absolutely fantastic. I kind of made it in a hurry and completely forgot about pouring the sauce on the meatballs and putting it back in the oven.  I just heated it on the stove and let the meatballs cook completely in the oven. It was definitely a new favorite to add to the menu.

I thought this recipe was great. The only addition I made  is adding a generous splash of  Worchester  sauce to “beef” up the flavor.  I made the meatballs too big ( I couldn’t figure out what to inches* was LOL)but either way it worked out fine. Everyone got a big meatball with mashed potatoes and the gravy on top. Really nice meal. Will add to my rotation.
* I miscalculated 2” and made them closer to 3”.

This was Ok.  Husband didn't like it much.  I didn't have the browning sauce, so the sauce was white, which was also OK. 
 Probably won't make again.   I will probably just make the  meatballs and my own gravy.

Yes , I made changes as I cooked for just my wife and I, so I halved the meat, used a red pepper, and instead of browning sauce used a packet of French onion soup mix as suggested by another patron to this page. My wife and I ate one serving but didn’t enjoy it at all, however, my daughter took the leftovers and loved it, go figure.

I made this for dinner tonight and my wife loved it (I did too). I used ground bison that I had in the freezer and used some beef stock I had left over from a pot roast as part of the sauce. And served it over rice which my wife loves. We have plenty of leftovers (it made 24 meatballs and there's only the two of us) but will make it again in the future.

So easy and fast if you’re working in cheat mode (aka buy a bag of frozen cooked Italian meatballs). I added a pinch of garlic powder and used one can of golden mushroom and one can of cream of mushroom, and I used two small cans of sliced mushrooms (again, cheat mode!). I served it over basmati rice and with garlic toast.  The whole family liked it. Will make again!

Used frozen Italian meatballs to save a bit of time.  Sauteed the fresh mushrooms in butter and only used/only had one can of cream of mushroom soup.  Served it over egg noodles and was well received by the family.

Husband liked it. I made the meatballs without green pepper since he's not a fan. The meatballs are really good...I might try a different sauce. All in all...good recipe. I also made theeatballs the night before...so the day 9f it took no time at all.

I just noticed that the recipe doesn’t say where to add the eggs. It was okay for me to figure it out but a new cook might not . The end result was awesome my entire picky family liked it!

We loved the sauce.   I was lazy and used some frozen meatballs.   I sautéed the green pepper and mushrooms, then added them to the sauce.  Followed the recipe from there on.  We really enjoyed them over mashed potatoes, but there was plenty of sauce to use over noodles.    It's a keeper!

This recipe has potential, we really liked the meatballs - they're outstanding!  (Used 1 lb hamburger + 1 lb Italian sausage.)
The sauce however, needs help - while it looks delicious... it's too plain for our taste.   I added garlic and Worcestershire...  and found it much improved.  
Interested in what others think.

my Husband loved this dish!  I left out the green pepper and added an extra egg to the meat mixture.  Also, I covered the pan after I combined the sauce and meatballs.  The meatballs were moist and tender.  The next time I make this, I’m going to use 1 can of mushroom soup and 1 of beef consommé.  It was a little too ‘mushroomy’ for my taste.

Yummy! I halved the recipe and sautéed the mushrooms in butter and added some onion and garlic to put in the sauce. Didn't use browning sauce. There was plenty of sauce for the 1 lb of ground beef. Served atop of mashed cauliflower.

This is definitely a “keeper “ 
It tastes even better the next day. I might add a little more seasoning to the meatballs, maybe some oregano and thyme. The sauce is delicious! We enjoyed every bite.

These are very tasty and I wouldn't change the Creator's ingredients. at all. Actually, they are very similar to my Salisbury Steak recipe, but in meatball form instead of patties. I served them with steamed broccoli and noodles instead of mashed potatoes.

I used frozen Italian meatballs. Browned in the oven. To the sauce I added and sautéed 1/4 C onion, three smashed garlic cloves and two tablespoons red minced red pepper. Instead of kitchen bouquet I used W sauce. I did not add any salt. This had great flavor.  Regarding the ratio of meatballs to sauce, I added an amount of meatballs that looked like a good ratio to me. Had plenty of sauce and meatballs.  Quick meal for a busy day.

So good!!! I have a big family so I needed the gravy to stretch a little further. I added 2 cups of water and 2 packs of brown gravy mix to the mushroom gravy. I served over a lb bag of wide egg noodles. I followed ingredients exactly only I cooked the gravy on the stovetop and added the meatballs to the big pot once they finished baking.

I used cream of mushroom soup and savory beef gravy and 1/4 cup milk for the sauce. Added small amount of dill before serving. Meatballs are great,but cooked in oven for about 20 minutes as I then simmered gravy for another 20 min. Ser ed with mash potatoes and Garlic green beans. Very very good,approved by all!

This recipe was well-received by my family, especially the mushroom lovers- it does look great in the casserole.  Because I can't tolerate mushrooms, I made some with a different approach... I did not add any mushrooms and I changed the soups to 1 can of Cream of Chicken and 1 can of Cream of Celery.  I also won't use browning sauce so I left that out.  Guess what?  No matter which version you try, this is a good, filling meal that is simple to make; the difference is one dish looks golden and the other looks like cream sauce.  You can even use frozen meatballs instead of making your own (although nothing beats homemade meatballs).  Thanks for a nice comfort food to enjoy!

Just dandy! Being lazy, didn't want to run out and get more ground beef, only had 600 grams, so added about 300 grms of Italian sausage taken out of its casing and blended. Was delist, and would have been so even with straight ground beef.

Very good! I used soy sauce instead of browning sauce and doubled the sauce recipe (other wise not enough sauce for rice). Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious!! Even without the browning sauce. I change the green peppers for green beans sometimes and they still come out delicious. I will make it again and again and again!

I mix in a package of Stove Top for the filler and a 1/4 cup of rice with the onion.  Gives the meatballs a nice flavor.  For the gravy, I brown the meatballs on the stove turning every so often and then once I remove the meatballs from the pan I use the drippings in combo with a can of cream of mushroom and a can of either cream of chicken or cream of celery.

This was ok for me, but my husband loved it, which is the reason it got 4 stars. The only thing I did difference was I left out the bell pepper (nobody in my house likes them). Probably won't make this again unless my husband asks for it :)

This was pretty good.  I left out the fresh mushrooms and the browning sauce (I usually just use this for gravy).  My family didn't care too much for the sauce, but they did eat it.  I like how easy it was to brown the meatballs in the oven then continue baking in the sauce.  I would for sure make this again and use a different soup.

Very good and simple recipe.  I used already made meatballs i had on hand from the freezer section and this dish turned out just as good.  Served it over wide egg noodles, this is a great quick hot comforting meal i will make again.  My entire family enjoyed it! Thanks!

This was a quick and easy dinner to make on a weeknight. I served mine with white rice, and seasoned the meatballs more with garlic seasoning....

I have made this dish twice now and it is very good.  I modified it a bit to cut down in preparation time.  I use frozen meatballs that have been thawed and I can have this meal on the table in forty-five minutes.  A real time saver when I have to work all day and need something quick.

These were excellent and easy! I bought pre-made meatballs, used light sour cream, extra milk and added a little onion and garlic powder. My three year old loved them. I will definitely make these again.
