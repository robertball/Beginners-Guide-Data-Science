I made my own brown sugar. ( 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup molasses mixed together ) Add 1/2 cup flour and 1 teaspoon baking soda. Very good cookies! They do stick a bit but just let them cool a bit and it's fine. I'll make them again.

Not very impressed with this recipe. I am wondering if something was left out.  The dough did not seem  stiff enough and the cookies were very thin and flat.  The recipe said use an ungreased pan and there was no way this worked.  The picture with the recipe showed cookies baked and then cut into bars but the recipe said drop by rounded spoonfuls .  Would be interested in hearing comments from other cooks who tried this recipe.
