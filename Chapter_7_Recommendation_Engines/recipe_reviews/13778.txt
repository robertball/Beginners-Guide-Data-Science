The jarred and canned artichokes do have a flavor that clashes with the spinach. I use the frozen artichokes, 2 packages, cook well and remove any tough, woody parts. I also add finely chopped and sauteed onion and garlic. I make this every year for Thanksgiving and get RAVES! There are never any leftovers! My mouth is watering for it right now!

I loved this recipe.  I actually stuffed huge mushrooms with this dip before baking and then baked it in the mushrooms for 20 minutes.  It is great for an appetizer to steak!

If I make this again I'll use regular artichokes instead of marinated.

I've been making this requested recipe for years with RAVE reviews.  Difference is that I save some of the marinade from the marinaded artichokes and mix it with the cooked spinach.  It's a beautiful mix of flavors.  Partners best with steak.

I agree that the marinated artichokes did not blend well with the flavor of the spinach mixture.
I think the regular artichokes in the can will not be so overwhelming.  I'm going to try this recipe with mushrooms instead of artichokes.  My husband and liked it but think we will love it with the change I've suggested.

I have been making this recipe since before any of us had even heard of a pc, much less the internet. (I have now made myself feel older than dirt!) We love it and I cannot imagine not using marinated artichokes.  Different strokes etc.

One thing I forgot to mention! I agree there is too much spinach.  I always make more of the cream cheese topping.  So, you may want to try this change too!  When there is too much spinach, its too chewy.

Nice recipe. I added some sauted yellow onion, and a little nutmeg. Topped it with cheddar cheese before baking it. Yum! :)

My family is very open to new dishes--but everyone in my dinner party of 7 turned their noses up.  We like spinach, we like artichokes, we did not like this dish.

This is unbelievably delicious.  Although I use twice as many artichoke hearts, less spinach, more cream cheese and butter.  I learned to make this over 30 years ago.  I just didn't know what the name of this dish was.  Happy to see it here.

This was good, but similar to other spinach and artichoke dips I've made. I wanted something more like a side dish, so I think I have to keep looking.

Very yummy - Did great with VEGAN substitutes (Tofutti "cream cheese," soy milk, Earth Balance margarine and Rice "parmesan"). As others, I did not use marinated artichokes (didn't have).  Use 1 can water packed (lightly chopped).  Added cajun spice & garlic for extra seasoning.

It's a good start--I did add some garlic powder because it seemed like it needed something else for flavor. Be sure to get chopped spinach so it doesn't come out too stringy. I took another reviewer's advice and used non-marinated artichoke hearts. I enjoyed it, but will doctor it up a bit with more garlic, some saut√©ed onion, and hot sauce for kick.

Decided to make this recipe for an appetizer.  Did misread the recipe and used 3 8-ounce packages of cream cheese so had to add more milk and make another pan.  It still turned out fantastically!!!  One pan cut nicely into squares, the other worked better to spoon onto crackers.

Not popular at my table.  I think the problem is that regular jarred atrichoke hearts--not marinated--should be used.

I made this for a family dinner and it went over well.  Several said it could be served as a dip and I agreed.  I used artichokes in a jar (not marinated) but due to time constraints did not refrigerate before baking.  I honesty do not see where this step would have made any difference.

Delicious! I made is with 20 oz of fresh spinach instead of frozen. I wilted the fresh spinach before adding. Also I used canned regular artichokes as I think the flavor of marinated artichokes is overwhelming. Also I mixed artichokes in with the mix instead of keeping them at the bottom of the pan. Whole family loved it!
