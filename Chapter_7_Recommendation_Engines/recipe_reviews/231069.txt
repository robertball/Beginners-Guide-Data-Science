This was good as written, but adding a dash of almond extract made it much better.

Very simple and easy dip to serve with fruit. It does have a very strong cream cheese flavor, so, I think it would be better with a flavored cream cheese like strawberry or honey.  It would also be good with a little lemon or almond extract added. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese to save on some calories.

I doubled the cream cheese and used a big container of marshmallow fluff (16 oz) instead of the marshmallow creme and it was AMAZING.  You can taste the cream cheese as others have stated, but I really like plain cream cheese, so I'm good with it the way it is - If you like plain cream cheese, there is no need to go with a flavored one such as strawberry.  If you don't, then do as others suggest and use a flavored cream cheese =).  I will certainly be making this again - I took it to a party and it was a hit!

I make this with cream cheese and marshmallow fluff instead of marshmallow creme. Depending on my mood I add either vanilla extract or orange extract.  So yummy
