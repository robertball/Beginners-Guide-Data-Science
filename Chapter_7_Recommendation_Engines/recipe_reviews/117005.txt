So yummy! I can't stop eating them! I didn't put the corn syrup in. It's against my beliefs. I just doubled the honey.  I also added flax seed instead of sesame and almonds instead of the sunflower and raspberry/chocolate chips.  Sooo yummy!  I can't wait to make the next batch.

I use this site several times a week and this recipe definitely makes my top 5 list.  I made two batches for my husband to take to a running race and the team raved about them.  He said they were gone in just a couple minutes.  Here is what I did different.  I ommitted all seeds/raisens.  I replaced the corn syrup with organic honey (choc chips provide plenty of sweetness) and also used natural organic peanut butter.  Because of the listed ommissions, the first batch came out a little soft so I added 1/8 cup of additional oats to the second batch which gave a more firm bar.   Goodbye Owalla.  Hello HM Chewy Gran Bars  Thank you Lavone.

This is a great base for a granola recipe. I left out the sunflower and sesame seeds along with the raisin and wheat germ because I didn't have any. But I did add in 1/4 cup of flax seeds and an extra 1/2 cup of oats. Turned out very good, can really smell and taste the peanut butter in them. When pressing mixture into pan make sure you really press firmly that way when you turn them out they won't crumble.

Finally- a nice granola bar recipe. I did make a lot of substitutions but I think the oats, peanut butter and brown sugar is the perfect base. I used honey instead of corn syrup, and it was fantastic!  I think that possibly cooking them down first would help them set better. I used dairy free semi sweet bakers chocolate, sweetened coconut and a mix of pecans and walnuts instead of any other things. They were delicious and my picky husband loves them!.
I recently tried them in a 9X13 instead of an 8X8 and I liked the results. A little more crispy. 325 for 20min

I double the recipe for a cake pan...make sure you use buttered hands and press firmly into the buttered pan.
I ad craisins, mini choc. chips, and sliced raisins...also I add a bit more peanut butter. Bake 26min. until edges start to brown. Awesome!!!!

This was a great wholesome treat. I followed the directions but added a little more protein by throwing in some chopped walnuts and almonds. Very delicious!! Thank you!!

Our favorite (after trying three other granola bar recipes from this site)!  Note: I used the corn syrup and had NO problems with crumbling.

I really like these bars.  I find that flavor improves each day.  On the 3rd day they were absolutely delicious.  I substituted dried cranberries for the chocolate chips.  Next time I will try using honey in the place of the corn syrup.

I've been trying out recipes for portable breakfasts for my husband, and these are pretty amazing! Surprisingly sweet, too. My alternates: natural sugar-free peanut butter instead of regular, honey instead of corn syrup (ew + bad for your health), no vanilla as I had none on hand, and instead of seeds, added peanuts. I baked them for 18 minutes, and cooled them; however, they weren't firm enough and many in the middle of the pan fell apart, so I'll try baking them and cooling them longer. But for flavour, these are fantastic.

This is a simply delicious granola bar.  I omitted the raisins (I like them, kids don't).  Am making this one again, for sure.

I NEVER rate recipes, but had to do my review. These are absolutely wonderful and extremely addicting. I have made these three times following the advice from previous reviews. 1/3 cup of brown sugar, applesauce for sure in the place of butter, 1/3 cup of chocolate chips (plenty sweet) and 1/3 cup of honey verses corn syrup. I bake mine for about 17 minutes. They feel a little soft when straight out of the oven. Once cooled they are perfect. No crumbling, just enough sweetness and the peanut butter makes it divine. I also added some chopped walnuts and raisins. This recipe rocks! A staple in our home.

This recipe is SO good and SO easy! We don't keep sunflower kernels, raisins, toasted wheat germ and sesame seeds on hand so I didnt add any of that to it, instead I just doubled the oats. I used two different sizes of oats, one was larger and the other smaller. I previously made this recipe once before using a cake pan, but trying to take them out was very difficult even after 2 hours of cooling and hardening, they crumbled a little and got squished. This time I made triple the amount to be able to cover a cookie sheet that I lined with foil, they came out so much easier and I will be able to flip them over to dry out the bottom (moisture likes to settle and make the bottom squishy). I really like this recipe as you can tell I've made 4 batches of it already in just 2 days. Thanks!

These were great. I made a few changes though: substituted peanuts for the sunflower seeds, used old fashioned oats instead of quick-cooking oats, added craisins (cranberry raisins) and took out the sesame seeds and chocolate chips. I'll be making these again soon, but I think next time I'll double the batch and maybe substitute honey for the corn syrup. Mine did turn out slightly crumbly (may have been due to my premature cutting them). I ended up wrapping them individually and sticking them in the fridge and that held them together really nicely.

Being a 'health nut,' I doctored this recipe like a lot of other reviewers. I substituted walnuts for the seeds (mostly because I didn't have the seeds on hand), and substituted dried blueberries & tart dried cherries for the chocolate chips & raisins (1/2 cup total). I also used unsweetened almond butter instead of peanut butter, light olive oil (not to be confused with extra virgin) for the butter, and raw honey for the corn syrup. I felt much better about my ingredient list, and the bars were still delicious.

Soooo yummy!  I used chunky peanut butter, 1/4 cup of honey instead of corn syrup, and stirred in some cocoa krispies.  I didn't have wheat germ, raisins or sesame seeds, but used some butter toffee sunflower kernals I got at Dollar General.  Smooshed it down in a cooking sprayed cookie sheet (could have doubled the recipe) and baked at 325 for 20 minutes, they came out PERFECT!

Love this recipe but I changed it out a bit based on what I had available at home.  I used brown sugar splenda blend, an eighth cup each molasses and honey instead of corn syrup, left out the seeds and chocolate chips but added a mixture of toasted nuts (pecans, almonds, walnuts) for protein.  Since I wasn't sure how badly the granola would stick to a baking pan, even with spray, I used an 8 inch springform pan which worked great. I was able to separate the sides without a problem and used a spatula to gently pull the granola from the bottom of the pan onto wax paper.    My husband and I both love the bars and have been taking them for breakfast with some greek yogurt on the side.  I'll definitely make them again!

I adjusted these bars just a bit to reflect a healthier eating lifestyle. I doubled the recipe for this, cut the sugar down to 1/4 of a cup, I used Trader Joe's organic chunky peanut butter, homemade sugar free maple syrup instead of corn syrup, applesauce in place of half the butter, dried blueberries and Craisins in place of the raisins (That's what I had on hand, isn't it about using what you have on hand?), and I cut the chocolate chips back to 1/4 cup, just to give the bars a little taste of chocolate. 350* for 20 minutes made a perfect bar. I got 24 organic granola bars for less that two bucks for the whole 24 instead of 4.50 for a box of six pre-packaged organic granola bars at the store. What I do now is just cut them into bars and seperate them into snack bags and freeze them. When I need a couple for my boys' lunch, I just pull a couple out in the morning and throw them in the lunch bag and by lunch, they're thawed out. I still can't believe I bought granola bars when they're so simple it should be illegal.

I made this as close to the written recipe as I could, with what I had available.  I did substitute honey for the corn syrup, rice krispies for the sunflower seeds, flax meal for the wheat germ, and used a raisin/cranberry mix of fruits.  Then omitted the sesame seeds and the chocolate chips.  It certainly tasted really good before being cooked!  They are cooling on the rack right now.  The only thing I would change is cut down on the brown sugar--it was a bit sweet for my tastes, which is also why I omitted the chocolate chips. The fruit, and the honey, are probably enough sweetness, if you are looking for a healthy snack for you or your kids. I can't wait to play with this recipe again, and try different combinations of additions.

YUM! My husband, preschooler and I love these. I have made them 4 times in 3 weeks! I use honey instead of corn syrup stir in whatever seeds, nuts, or dried fruit I have on hand. Go easy on the fruit and chocolate though because they are pretty sweet as is. I also sent a batch to my bestie in Afghanistan. Much better than cookies that dry out. These seem to get better over time as another reviewer mentioned.

I probably shouldn't even rate this becuase I've changed it a lot, but here goes... I love this recipe. I made it nut free and wheat free for my son's class.  I left out the sunflowers, sesame seeds, and wheat germ.I replaced the peanut butter with sunflower butter, And instead of all corn syrup, I used about 1 TBSP of corn syrup and the rest honey.  Everything else was the same though.  When this came out of the oven it was VERY "runny" or "mushy" so I put it in the fridge and it set right up.  Next time I make this, I will use less honey and less butter and maybe add in a little applesauce, and some gluten free rice puff cereal.

Very good bar. Mine were a little sticky, I only baked them 15 min. 20 would probably be just right. I will make them again and play with them a bit.

Chewy, moist, awesome!  I can't figure out why some had crunchy granola that fell apart, other than maybe they messed with the recipe too much?  It may be tempting to eliminate some of the brown sugar, but, brown sugar does indeed add a lot of moisture.  That being said, I may a few changes, in order to use all natural ingredients, that still lead to wonderful, moist granola bars.  
I used Agave Nectar in place of the corn syrup, added 1 T of ground flax seed, used Ghee butter (natural butter found in the baking aisle at a store like Whole Foods that is a bit healthier than regular butter), and substituted almond butter for the peanut butter (more vitamins in almond butter).  I skipped the sunflower kernels, sesame seeds and chocolate chips (recipe is plenty sweet without) and added dried cherries, chopped dried apricots and salted almonds - it was absolutely wonderful!  Everyone who tried this loved it and many asked for my recipe.

this would be more of a 3 1/2 stars. Its really good, but really sweet. I think I might try less corn syrup next time.

These are a great substitute for the store bought variety! My whole family loves them. It is a great starter recipe and fun to explore new add-INS and substitutes. I like almond butter instead of peanut, using some whole oats along with quick oats, and brown rice cereal makes them a less dense. Of course my family loves chocolate chips so I haven't made them without yet.

I've made these several times, and it's nice to be able use whatever I have in the cabinet. I've added nuts, different flavored chips, flax seeds, etc.  I've also use 2 cups oats, and 1 cup steel cut oats and instead of 1/2 cup corn syrup, I use 3/4 cup agave syrup, and am able decrease the butter by a couple of tablespoons.  THANKS- great recipe- my kids love granola bars, glad to make these healthier, much more affordable ones.

very simple & delicious granola bars! they are easy to tailor to your taste buds. you can pretty much add whatever fruit, nuts, spices, etc to the recipe that you'd like. i added flax seeds, toasted sunflower seeds, raisins & mini chocolate chips. next time i might omit a portion of the brown sugar, as these are pretty sweet.

Great recipe! I also substituted honey for cornstarch and used the oats, honey, peanut butter mixture as a base and just threw in whatever I had in the house. I followed other reviewers' advice to bake the bars for longer than the 15-20 minutes and they came out hard. Will back for less next time!

These turned out great, not too peanut buttery. I added 1/4 cup of egg whites  to increase protein and chewyness. I subbed chopped walnuts and pecans for the sunflower seeds and wheat germ. I also subbed honey for the corn syrup. I added semi-sweet chocolate chips. Next time I will add a pinch of salt. Unfortunately, my kids didn't like them, they are very picky, but my husband and I loved them.

Very good granola base.  I subbed applesauce for the butter and honey for the corn syrup.  I also added flax seed, walnuts and craisins, eliminated sunflower kernels, sesame seeds and chocolate chips (didn't have them on hand). Deelish! My husband couldn't stay out of them.

These were awesome! Was searching for a granola bar similar to prepackaged famous name brand so I could modify milk free products for my kid with special dietary needs and these were delicious! Whole family couldn't keep their hands off 'em! Thank you sooooo much for sharing!

This recipe is excellent!  I took the users advice and substituted honey for corn syrup.  I did not have sunflower seeds, so I used raw pepitas (squash seeds).  I am not a fan of raisins, so I used dried cherries, which made the bars pleasantly tangy.  I also used miniature chocolate chips which gave just enough chocolate flavor in each bite.  I used a round flat meat tenderizer tool to tamp the mixture firmly into the pan.  I noticed that the mixture was already starting to brown at 15 minutes, and I removed it from the oven even though it did not appear completely set.  It set as it cooled.  It was crumbly at first because I could not wait for it to be completely cooled before I took a sample.  It never had the chance to "season" a day.  I would definitely make a double batch next time.  I see no reason for me to try other granola bar recipes because this one is ambrosia.  Thank you, Lavonne, for sharing it.

Very good...I used honey rather than corn syrup and used white chocolate chips and slivered almonds instead of sunflower kernels, raisins and sesame seeds...so many variations and the butter, brown sugar, peanut butter and honey make a great base to start with!

I have made this several times and adusted it to our taste.  They're really, really good and even my kids love them!  They are much better than store bought and I know exactly what goes into them.  Definitely a new staple snack recipe in our house.

I used 100% pure maple syrup instead of corn and omitted raisins. SO good, but don't hold together well since pure maple syrup is so watery. Much better than store bought granola bars, and much cheaper. They're now a "lunch box" staple. Thanks for sharing, Lavone!

I strongly recommend following the Editor's note by allowing these bars to cure for a day.  Initially I doubted the taste of these bars; but, after waiting another 24 + hours, rave reviews from family and friends, a 2nd taste test by me as well as a 3rd taste test comparing them to high-end commercial granola bars, I came to the conclusion that I never want to buy granola bars again.  These bars were a vast improvement in taste, texture, and ingredients.  I greatly enjoyed the flexibility of the recipe as well, because I included flax seed, honey, peanuts, dried cranberries, wheat germ, and crispy rice cereal.  Thank you for submitting this great recipe.

great recipe! I substituted 1/2 cup honey for corn surup and added 1/2 cup each dark chocolate and pecans. I also doubled the recipe and baked it in a cookie sheet and it was easier to cut.

Love these!  I also added ground flaxseed, a 1/4cup coconut and used chopped dried apricot. I think you could add just about anything to these! Next time will try to replace the corn syrup with honey. Had to bake for 20 min, next time will try 25 for a little more browning. They held together really well!

Delish! Left out the peanut butter (so I could send to daycare/ school) and sub'd in extra sunflower seeds and a couple tablespoons of sunflower oil, as well as sub'd graham cracker crumbs for the wheat-germ (just what I had on hand). More like cookies, but kids are in love, so I think it is a good compromise!

For variety, I substituted the following for the peanut butter:  1/4 cup cocoa powder, 1/8 cup corn syrup, 1 tblsp butter, 1/8 cup powdered sugar, and a bit of brewed coffee. Also added walnuts and dried cherries. 
Patting down with a spatula after removing from the oven stops any crumbling.

Yum! I had never made granola bars before trying this recipe, and these are delicious. The only substitution I made was agave nectar for the corn syrup, and as far as I can tell it worked just as well. I'm not judging anyone for using corn syrup and I am sure it is equally delicious as written--I just had agave nectar on hand. I will be making these again and again and I look forward to experimenting with the add-ins (nuts, chips, etc.). 

Just a note for novice granola bar bakers like me: 
These take a long time to cool and set. I thought I could make them the morning of a playdate and have them ready in a couple of hours, but they were falling apart when I tried to cut them too early. They are well worth the wait.

This is a wonderful recipe and very versatile. I've made it several times with different ingredients. My kids love the cranberry and white chocolate version. I often use dried fruit tid bits and a small amount of mini chocolate chips (just enough to fool the kids). It also works nicely with almond butter, if you don't have/use peanut butter. You can also substitute honey or brown rice syrup for the corn syrup, if you'd like, and cut down on the brown sugar. Great!!

I just tried this recipe for the first time yesterday, and I made more today (a double batch this time!)  I only used the quick-cooking oats and chocolate chips, because that's all I had on hand, but they turned out great!  I'd like to try honey on the next batch instead of corn syrup, and maybe some chopped almonds and dried cranberries.  So easy to make and have on hand, I love this recipe!  UPDATE (5/30/12):  I can't even count how many times I've made this recipe (or how many times I've been asked for the recipe), a family favorite for sure!  I now use honey instead of the corn syrup and we have not been able to tell a difference in taste or texture!!

I make this one a little differently, by using honey instead of corn syrup, and boiling the wet ingredients, mixing all together and pressing into a pan. Then I cool instead of baking and cut into squares. This is a great recipe!

Did the old "whatever was in my cupboard" too. Used superchunky peanut butter, no corn syrup (1/8 c molasses, 1/8 c honey), no wheat germ or sesame seeds. Used dried cranberries instead of raisins.

Made them as is the first time and they turned out crumbly, I will follow other reviewers suggestions to add more honey and butter.  Hubby took these to work and he ate them all, crumbly or not.

I came in hoping this recipe would be great (2nd one I have tried) and other than being a little sweet it was perfect! Next time I will try reducing the brown sugar next time though because I was going for a "healthy tasting" granola bar. I used sunflower seeds, cranberries, pepitas, sliced almonds and crunchy peanut butter. I used honey in place of the corn syrup and I have a gluten allergy so I did not use any wheat germ.

As written this recipe is just average.  It serves as a good base, but is much improved with just a couple of changes. I made two batches, one following the recipe exactly the next with changes. And the one with changes was much more well received.

On the second batch I used crunchy peanut butter, honey in place of the corn syrup and about half the brown sugar.  I also used chopped slivered almonds instead of sunflower seeds, and dried cherries instead of raisins.

I am about to enjoy this recipe! What I did different though is, instead of the seeds and raisins, I added 1/4c.Sliced Almonds and about a .1/4c. sliced Blackberries:) I only made one batch but my husband is on his way to get more butt and I will be making several variations to this recipe!

These are really good!!  Nice and chewy with lots of fruit.  I used honey instead of corn syrup like others suggested.  You can add whatever combination of nuts, fruit or chocolate that you like.  Will definitely be making again.

Absolutely amazing! Ive made these bars twice with perfect results. After reading comments, I made the following changes: substitute honey for corn syrup, nuts (almonds are yummy) for sunflower kernels, add 1/4 cup craisins, leave out the wheat germ and sesame seeds, add 1/8 cup quick oats. Perfect for playgroup!

The flavor of these is wonderful. I made them as-is, except for adding about 2 TBS of flaxseed. I baked them about 18 minutes, but they were just a little crumbly after cooling. I will probably make them again, as it's a pretty healthy snack for my two-year old, and quite easy to make.
UPDATE-I let these cool an entire day, and they held together well the longer they sat. Will definitely make again.

Everyone loved these bars.  I made them to take on a beach vacation so I would have healthy snacks for the kids that were easy to pack to take down to the beach.  But these were so popular the kids hardly got to have any!  Everyone had their fingers in the bag and kept eating them.  I guess next year I will have to make several batches!    Loved em!

This was a great recipe, and my kids loved it.  They loved them straight out of the oven, and the 2 tiny ones that were left over for the next day tasted even better.  I didn't have sunflower seeds, so i took a chance with ground flax meal, toasted wheat germ, whole oats, and chunky peanutbutter, i also added some chocolate chips.  These were divine, and I can't wait to try them with some more variations.

These were quick and easy! I too substituted honey for the corn syrup. Instead of using sunflower seeds, raisins, and sesame seeds, (didn't have any around the house) I used a little more than 1/2 cup of a soy energy blend from Costco: toasted soy nuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and dried cranberries. Yummm...

Edited: Takes about 20 minutes to make. Tried these with syrup instead of honey/corn syrup. Also, should quadruple this recipe when making it so I'll use 2 9x13 pans because they are good to have on hand.These are so much better than some of the other granola bars on this website. I've tried Granola bars III and Playgroup granola bars and their textures were way off but these are perfect. I used corn syrup but may try honey (for health) another time. The kids love them - I made them last night while everyone was in bed and they are almost gone at 10am this morning.. great recipe, followed it perfectly but added 1/4 c. oats for the flax seed - doubled it in a 9x13 and cooked for 23 minutes. Great!

My kids loved these & so did I.  The peanut butter gives it a great flavor.  I left out the corn syrup and added white chocolate chips.  I used maple extract instead of vanilla.  They're a little crumbly, but if you let them cool completely before cutting them, they stay together pretty well.  I also wrapped them individually for lunch boxes.

These were really good, but not at all what I was expecting. To me 'granola' sounds healthy and this was anything but. We just enjoyed it for what it was: a yummy peanut butter and oatmeal bar. I made these for a car trip (substituting mini M&Ms for the chocolate chips to save on mess) and they held up well.

This recipe is quick and easy to make.  I'm dairy and soy free due to allergies so I've made this recipe 4 times so far for a quick snack to throw in my purse as I'm heading out the door.  Easy to substitue any add-ins you like.  I use cranberries, honey roasted peanuts, and walnuts.  I've substitued honey for corn syrup as other reviews suggested and make a double batch then freeze the extras.

Decent.  I used applsauce in place of butter and honey in place of the corn syrup.  Did not add sunflower or sesame seeds or wheat germ.  i did add 2 TB of flax seed instead.  It turned out a little to heavy on the honey flavor- my fault since that was my own add in- but still soft and chewy.  I loved the choc chips in these and will likely used extra next time.  Quick and easy and healthy enough with some modifications.  They are not so good that you can't stop eatng them but they are tasty enough to enjoy for breakfast or a quick easy grab snack.

Great granola bar base! I cooked the sugar mixture down a little, and this helped them hold together better. I am working on the ratio of sugar to honey(didn't use corn syrup), as these turned out VERY sweet. The sweetness seemed to mellow after a day or two,and the flavor was very good. I will also try this with sunbutter since I have a child with a peanut allergy.

This has been my most-used recipe from this site for the last year.  Love it!  Started making these as a way to use up those bucket-loads of WIC cereal.  I like that it is versatile to suit what I have on hand.  I too use honey in place of corn syrup.  11 packs of instant oatmeal makes a double batch.  And I use coconut in place of wheat germ, so good!  They freeze well, too, just layer wax paper between them.

I liked these a lot.  They are nice and hardy.  I was pleased with how chewy they were, that was my most important want.  I used the honey instead of corn syrup.  Flax meal, sesame seeds and almonds.  Added about a 1/4 cup choc chips, and also threw in some freeze dried rasberries that I had in food storage.  I like them.  My three year old didn't however which is who I was trying for.  I am not sure if it was peanut butter, or if they needed a little less "substance"  :)

This should be tried once. Reading the reviews gives you plenty of ideas as to making them super healthy or just like the Chewy brand. I regularly do both since I'm not fully devoted to the different health food lifestyles. But this recipe has the potential to be an one of those things.  I did go to a local organic food coop and asked what kinds of mix-ins they could suggest. I now have about 6 months worth of new ways to try this!

Awesome.  I substituted ground flax seed for wheat germ (since I didn't have it) and milk chocolate chips for semi-sweet (bought the wrong thing).  I will make this again and again, especially since this lends itself to endless substitution possibilities.  I used a large stoneware pan and had to triple the recipe, in case anyone is wondering.  All the better for us to have more for giving and freezing.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe.  (The consistency was perfect after cooling and cutting when made in my stoneware pan.)

Love these! They freeze and keep well; I always double it. I do let them rest before cutting and wrapping, this helps the bars stay together.   I have tried several combinations which is what I like about the recipe. The kids seem to most enjoy white choc. chips, craisins, chopped peanuts or almonds (vs. sunflower kernels), flax (vs. sesame seeds). I use the corn syrup as listed; my daughter has a fructose restricted diet and it is a better choice for her vs. honey.

Made a few changes in the recipe but it turned out great.  I followed the editor's note to let the bars rest (I waited overnight)before wrapping them up and had no problems with them crumbling.  Changes: substituted agave syrup for 1/2 of the brown sugar; used old fashioned oats; added cooca powder to the liquid ingredients because didn't have choc. chips; substituted chia seeds for sesame seeds.

I was looking for a substitute for the grocery store granola bars, and this one is better in every way!  Just sweet enough and very chewy.  I didn't have any butter, so I used oil instead, and I've made several batches of them.  I never make them without doubling the batch and baking them in a 9 x 13 pan.  No need to try any other recipe!

These are really great. I melted the chocolate and stirred it in so there was chocolate flavor in every bite. Really yummy.

I am always sharing this recipe. It is one of my very favorites of any kind! I use molasses instead of corn syrup and I make liberal substitutions so long as the ratio is the same such as bran instead of wheat germ, etc. Pressing it down into the pan is important for it to hold together. Also if you leave it in for the shorter amount of time rather than the longer, it will be more chewy instead of crunchy which makes it that much more awesome. Say if you leave it for 12 minutes instead of 20, it might look like it would never stick together but as it cools down, the molasses firms it up to. Never had it fail. A real winner!

I love these bars! I have been making them to put into my husband's lunch for several months now and he's a huge fan. The addition of the corn syrup makes them just the right consistency. I have gotten creative about substituting different dried fruits for the raisins, I often use flax seed instead of sunflower seeds and skip the wheat germ if I don't have it on hand. They are still great. I make this so often I've started putting the portions into greased muffin tins. This way there is no messy cutting; I just pop them out and wrap individually for lunches. Voila!

This is my "go to " recipe when I want granola bars. I use this as the base recipe and add whatever I have on hand, like coconut, peanuts, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, or ground flax seeds instead of wheat germ,  etc.  I have also used old-fashioned oats rather than the quick oats.  I usually add more peanut butter since our family loves peanut butter.  I just use less butter instead.  
This is also a good recipe for "raw foodists" who want a sticky granola snack.. just add your own dried fruit and homemade peanut butter and leave out the cooked ingredients.

Per the other recs, used:
1) little less brown sugar (more than 1/3 c. but less than 1/2 c.)
2) Unsalted almond butter in place of peanut butter
3) honey in place of corn syrup
4) unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter

For the add-ins:
1) 1/4 c. ground flax seed in place of the wheat germ and sesame seeds
2) heaping 1/2 c. chopped, dried dates 
3) 1/2 c. pistachios

Cooked it for 20 minutes and it's cooling now.  Smells good.  Will let it cool overnight since other reviewers stressed that it was best to cool completely before cutting.  Can't wait to try!  I also bought dried strawberries, dried figs, dried blueberries, almonds, and walnuts to experiment with other variations.  Would have included the chocolate chips but am making the granola bars for a trip to a hot place, so do not want them to melt.

Will be using this now instead of buying granola bars. Thanks for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe! Since I have a lot of raw honey on hand, I too, substitute honey for corn syrup.

my kids loved them,  but I did make some healthier changes.  Honey, instead of corn syrup,  and added pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, and nuts.  It was great.

Just tried this recipe and I LOVE it! This seems a little more like a dessert than a snack though. The chewy granola bars I get from WalMart are 100 cal each. Im really trying to reach that with this recipe without making the portion size bite size. I did what a lot of others did and substituted the corn syrup for honey and took out a lot of the nuts/seeds (added ground flax-although now I hear ground flax is pointless unless you keep it as a seed? Im not sure). I also added 1/8 cup more oats so it would be a more firm bar. I love the outcome but as I said before its very much like a dessert. I think I just need to keep working with this recipe to  make it just right for me. Thank you so much for posting this recipe! Im really excited to be able to make this at home now :)

These are awesome.  I also used honey instead of karo syrup.  I didn't add raisins or sesame seeds.  I added a little granola to it, and used chunky peanut butter.  I can't stop eating them!

Wonderful taste and texture.  I used up some trail mix that was loaded with sunflower seeds that my kids weren't eating.  Worked just fine.  :D

The only alterations I made were to use honey instead of corn syrup and chopped up peanuts instead of sunflower seeds.  They came out really yummy and with the perfect texture.  They were super easy and quick to make!  The only thing is, I'm not sure if these are really that healthy since it's very rich....

so good! They sort of remind me of the store bought "Oatmeal To-Go Bars". I used corn syrup because I ran out of honey and they turned out fantastic. You can substitute raisins with many other fillings. Definitely a keeper.

These were excellent!  Even my picky husband and son loved them.  I used honey instead of c. syrup, and flaxseed instead of wheat germ.  Next time i'll try reducing the sugar and maybe try a butter alternative.  They were super sweet and too yummy to resist.

Used agave syrup instead of corn syrup and just added whatever I have in my cupboards. I believe pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, chocolate chips, cashews. The agave syrup spread it out while baking but still turned out good.

Very good recipe! They reminded me of something I had tried before, but couldn't remember what it was until a day later. They reminded me of the no bake cookie with the oats and peanut butter. This is so much cheaper than buying the super small, overly sweet bars in the store. Thanks for a great recipe!
