I was looking for something to serve for Christmas eve lunch. This was easy to prepare and I had all the ingredients on hand except for the marsala wine. I substituted white for the filling and did not make the optional sauce on the side. I did add a half cup shredded cheese. the whole family enjoyed it. Thanks.

I made these for a dinner party with the optional Marsala sauce.  Followed the  recipe but added some shoestring carrots for color.  A bit tricky to roll the dough out into the right size squares and to get the purses to close up properly.   I may have worked the dough too much because they didn't puff up much during baking.  But the end result was none-the-less beautiful and delicious and a unique side dish.  The sauce is wonderful - don't leave that out!
