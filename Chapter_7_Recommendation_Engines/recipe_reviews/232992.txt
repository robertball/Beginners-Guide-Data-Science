This was so easy and the seasonings added a little more heat than I was expecting. I used some homemade bread from the freezer that I believe was "fake" sourdough and that worked fine. I also broke down and very lightly sprayed them with a mist of EVOO because my bread was dry and the seasonings wouldn't stick. After the 6 min, they were crispy on the outside and a little tender/chewy on the inside. I left them about 2 more minutes and it made them too crunchy. We used them all , so I don't know how well they would have stored. Next time I'll try just the 6 min and see how they cool.

I looked everywhere for a crouton recipe WITHOUT oil. We don’t use any dairy or oil. This recipe was fabulous. I had hearty, homemade whole grain, seeded bread cut into ~3\4” cubes. It took about 30” to crisp up but they were delicious soaked in the broth of our minestrone soup!

The seasoning is fine but refused to stick to the bread cubes without at least a little spray oil.
