quite disappointing..before becoming gluten intolerant i have eaten these cookies made w/ all purpose flour. i know enough not to be too hopeful of the results for substituting flours. some work and some don't. this didn't! the cookies melted into one large sheet of pastry. perhaps chilling the dough before hand might have worked! the ingredients call for 2 C chopped hazelnuts, 2 C chopped walnuts or hazelnuts  (quite a large amount of nuts). the directions call to add the ground hazelnuts and the chopped hazelnuts........what ground nuts? this recipe was a dismal failure. if i can resurrect another from experimentation i will forward to you. this is Christmas week and there are several gluten intolerant family members for whom this was to be a treat.

Even after chilling the dough as I would for regular Mexican Wedding Cake cookies, I still ended up with a finished cookie that looked more like a very flat crisp than a Mexican Wedding Cake. I did manage to save the remainder of the dough & turn it into a fairly good cookie that was close to the original Mexican Wedding cake with some changes. I will submit the recipe for others to try if they would like.

This recipe was a total flop. The cookies melted into one big mess. I would think twice before making this one.

This recipe just doesn't work.  We had to add an egg just to get the whole thing to stick together a bit.  Do yourself a favor and skip this recipe... use a GF flour mix and substitute it cup for cup in a regular mexican wedding cake recipe.

I tried this recipe twice as written, once right away and once leaving the dough sit in fridge 24 hrs.  Not happy with the results.  Instead of using rice and tapioca  flours, I switched to a 1 to 1 gluten-free flour that contains xanthan gum, took out the gelatin and added an egg and a pinch of salt -- voila, the way they should be.  I also roll in conf. sugar right out of the oven, and again after cooled.
