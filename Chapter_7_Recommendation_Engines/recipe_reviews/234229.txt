These mixed up quick and tasted great. I've been asked to make a fourth batch. So they must be good. A good reason to keep cake mixes in the cupboard for when there are unexpected guests. I've done a couple of variations using different flavours of mixes and add ins. They work well too. Thank you for this recipe.

If you love a cake-like type of cookies, you will enjoy these as my daughter did, but not so impressive with me.  My husband thought, it would pair nicely with some frosting since the cookies are soft.  Make sure to have your butter and eggs at room temperature.  Also,  I was afraid of my cookies
sticking to the sheet so I lightly sprayed it with Pam.  Baked for 15 minutes.

This is the first cookie I have made that pleased everyone in the family.  My husband, my grandsons and their parents each have their own favorite and their tastes don't correspond. This one pleased them all!  I had to use what I had on hand as we were having an ice storm and could not get to the grocery store.  I was out of butter and almost out of oil,  so I substituted 1/4 cup corn oil and 1/4 cup coconut oil, and a French vanilla cake mix. The result was wonderful.. I'm making them again today!
