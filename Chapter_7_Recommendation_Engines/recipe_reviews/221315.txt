This was delicious! Thank you for sharing your yummy recipe. I did make some changes to suit our tastes. For the sauce I cut the salt way down. 2 tablespoons sounds like a lot to me (I would like to ask the recipe submitter if that is maybe a typo), so I used 2 teaspoons and that was a good amount for us. I also reduced the chili powder by 1/2 and that was plenty for us-I felt 2 tablespoons would make the sauce taste like chili powder only. I tasted the sauce before pouring it over the meat and it was wonderful, so I was happy with the changes I made.  I would suggest checking the temp of the meat about 45 mins into the cooking time - the meat was a tad overcooked, but it was still a big hit with the fam! This paired perfectly with garlic sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. Did I mention the sauce was delish!  I think I will try adding a third kiwi next time!! yummmm

Great sauce, a nice mix of sweet and spice. I halved the salt and it was just fine. I think this would make an excellent sauce for pork chops as well and will be trying it again in the near future!

The sauce on these ribs was very tasty.  I liked that it uses kiwi, which I haven't seen paired with meat before.  Like others, I reduced the salt and used 2 teaspoons.  My only complaint is that some of the sauce cooked into a sugary rock onto the baking sheet and it was very hard to clean.  Next time I would line the bottom of the pan with foil as well as over the top, making a packet around the meat for easy clean up.  Also I would like to try this recipe in the slow cooker to make the meat more tender.

Delicious!!! I doubled sauce for 10 pounds of pork and I had plenty! Perfect balance of sweet and acid. Only changes were..I added half of a hefty bulb of garlic, about a quarter tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, oh and half a small onion, all into the blender. Winner!!

This was a hit with the whole family.  I lined a cookie sheet with foil, large enough that it would wrap around to complete the "loose cover."  Made clean up a breeze!

This recipe was very yummy! I made a few changes to the sauce: 3 kiwis, a pinch of salt, garlic powder (no cloves on hand), and half the chilli powder. I tasted the sauce before cooking, and thought there was enough chilli powder in it - but after cooking I couldn't taste it. I would add the full amount of chilli powder next time. I lined a casserole dish with parchment paper (made clean-up a snap!), and cooked a pork tenderloin in the oven at 400F for 1 hour. It was delicious. However, there is not too much taste of kiwi left after mixing all the ingredients together for the sauce.

I tried this because a friend gave me a bunch of kiwis that I had no idea what to do with. All I can say is WOW! I wanted to put this sauce on everything! Friends were licking the bones clean, then the plates, then asking for seconds. It is pretty salty though, so feel free to cut back on the salt and still have it taste fine.

Great unique flavor. Made as directed but used boneless chops on the stove top.

Thanks for posting this recipe!  Note that the sauce is very forgiving.  On short notice I used peaches instead of kiwis and lemon juice instead of lime, and still got rave reviews from the family.  Also used cayenne to make up for a slight deficiency in the chili powder. Next time I'll go with the lime juice and, as others have said, halve the salt.  I think pitted cherries or apricots would also work instead of kiwis.  Would appreciate any hints on reducing the sugar, perhaps substituting Splenda, to make it more diabetic friendly.

It was very easy and had a wonderful taste.  I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and reduce the amount of salt from 2 tablespoons to 2 teaspoons and I'm very glad I did.  I think it would have been way to salty with 2 tablespoons of salt.  I also reduced the amount of chili powder by half because I'm not fond of it.  So those modifications made it perfect for my tastes.  I will definitely make again.

Well I had to make some substitutes but it was fantastic. The first one was instead of the three pounds of ribs I used 1.5 pounds of left over rib meat. The next was I didnâ€™t have chili powder so I subbed in Chinese Five spice. If you have never used it you need to buy it. Lastly instead of minced garlic I used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. It turned out amazing and with some mashed potatoes it is defiantly an easy dinner while using leftovers.

This was different, but in a good way. An unexpected flavor combination on pork, but it works!

I heeded the comments from others about the amount salt and cut it back dramatically. Also, I highly recommend lining the baking dish as once baked, the sauce becomes hardened in the pan. But the flavor is delicious!

This recipe was delicious.   My husband is not a big fan of barbecue ribs and this is a great recipe alternative for something different.   The only change I made was the salt.  I used 2 teaspoons.  Great flavor combinations with the chili powder, limes, and kiwi.  I will definitely share this recipe.

I don't eat pork but this sauce goes GREAT with chicken. Like others, I halved the salt and used 3 kiwis instead of two, and brown sugar. Yummmm....

I thought this was a really good dish.  I used 3 Kiwis and cut down the salt and chili powder as others suggested.  I also used honey instead of white sugar and it was really good.

Had this last night for supper...it was easy and good!! We are not huge pork fans but really liked this. My husband and I are on a whole 30 diet where we cannot have any added sugar, so instead of sugar I used honey...it was still sweet! But next time I will add more honey. We didn't add quite as much salt or chili powder due to other reviews. It baked for 45 minutes and was done!

I used 3 very ripe (soft) kiwis, and 2 tsp salt, would have been fine with 3 tsp. The sauce was sweet and fruity after cooking, and very good on pork. I will be making this again.

This is a fabulous recipe - we prefer this to barbeque and have made over and over for family and friends.  Thank you so much for this recipe!
