good recipe, but end result was more similiar to enchiladas than fajitas. I cooked the chicken on the stove with the marinade after it had marinated for 30 minutes, it made the chicken so full of flavor it was amazing. Also, I used Zesty Italian dressing, and it gave it an extra kick. I thought the salsa would make it too spicy, so I used canned tomatoes with onions and green paper instead, and it was great. I also had made guacamole the same night, so I put that on top instead of avacado, amazing! The soup mixture with the tomatoes was the perfect balance to the flavorful chicken.

The chicken in this recipe was great. And I loved the cheese sause idea. However, I am rating this with only 3 stars because I had to doctor up the sauce quite a bit. It was too "can" tasting so I added some cream cheese and american cheese. I also cut up tomatoes and green chile and added them to the sauce, as well as the salsa. Fajitas don't seem complete to me without bell peppers and onions, so I cooked up long thin slices in a skillet to top the fajitas.

It was good, my husband and friend really liked it but to me it wasn't anything special. Definetly worth a try though, I may be biased because I'm not a huge fan of chicken.
