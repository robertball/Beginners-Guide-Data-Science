I cooked these cookies at 375 for about 18 minutes to make them a little more crisper, if you like them chewy 12-15 should do it. They're a nice cookie with tea or milk since they are quite dry and they're milder than a ginger snap if you don't like the strong taste ginger snaps usually have. Kids would enjoy them because they're so mild, its a nice autum cookie.

I baked the cookies at 375 for 10 to 12 minutes. Not great, but good if you want ginger cookies and you don't have molasses
