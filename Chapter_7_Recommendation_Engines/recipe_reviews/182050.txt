Made this for lunch today.  Could not find the broth the recipe calls for so used the College Inn White Wine and Herb broth.  Before adding the broth, sauteed the veggies with the garlic and thyme for about 10 minutes and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Also, did not dice small, but in rather larger pieces.  We really enjoyed this!

Definitely a good soup, but needed more seasonings.  It was a bit bland.  I added noodles to make it a bit more hearty.  Also, next time I plan to add something to thicken it up a bit.

I really loved this.  The wine/herb broth gives it a really warm and unique flavor.  I was making another dish so ended putting additional carrots, potatoes and a few cubes of beef. 

It was great!

I liked this recipe, though I altered it a bit. I added a potato, doubled the red bell pepper, and also added green beans. I substituted the broth for one can of beef broth, one can vegetable with herbs broth. Spiced it up a little with garlic pepperm a pinch of sea salt, 1/4 tsp. dried parsely, and a pinch of celery powder. The end result was spectacular. I made this specifically because I had a sore throat and needed something hearty, warm, and healthy.. this fit the bill to a tee and even my picky husband and kids loved it. I think I'll add even more veggies next time!

This was pretty good!  I added a little ground red pepper as I like that flavor with zucchini and tomatoes.  I also used vegetable broth and added roasted celery and cannellini beans.  I broke up some tortilla chips and added to my bowl for some crunch (before they got soggy ha).  My adult son sad it was ok.  He said it would be good with Italian sausage in it,(kind of defeats the purpose of veggie soup ha)It hit the spot it was 18 below here today!
