I scaled this recipe in half for just two of us; even so, we'll still have leftovers. I also cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces as others advised. Added about 1/4tsp cayenne pepper, but I would definitely double the cumin-cinnamon seasoning if I were to make this again. Served over steamed brown basmati rice.  Thanks for sharing, ChristyJ!

This was very tasty, but I must admit that I mostly used a different recipe for Chicken Costa Brava that I found in an old cookbook.  All of the ingredients are the same, but some of the quantities are different:  2 whole chicken breasts instead of 5, 8 oz of tomatoes instead of 14.5, 1 cup of salsa instead of 1/2 cup, 2 tsp of cornstarch instead of 2 tbsp, and a mixture of black and green olives instead of 2 cups of black.  I used a medium-heat salsa, and whole tomatoes that I crushed before adding.  I wonder if maybe it was these small differences that kept mine from being "bland," as some people are complaining?  Anyway, the fella liked it - the pineapple bits were particularly spicy and tangy and delicious - so next time I'll make it the Allrecipes way and update.

I'll admit that I was very wary of the combination of the ingredients. I was pleasantly surprised, as were my dinner guests. The word to describe this dish is complex. As others have noted, every bite is different, but they work together. It definitely will get the guests talking. Thank you!

I added mandarin oranges, green olives, and curry to this wonderful dish.  I could've eaten the sauce alone, it was so chuncky and flavorful!

I am glad my family likes to try different international dishes or I would have never made this wonderful chicken dish!  It is so good!  I used a whole chicken, and the only complaint was that some of the pieces (like the wings)were hard to pick up and eat because of the great sauce that covers the chicken.  I will try boneless breats cut into strips next time I make it, which will probably be very soon!

OMG!!  This is SOOOO good!!  The only changes that I made were to add extra onion (we love them) and leave out the corn starch.  Try it ~ You won't be sorry!!  Yummy!!!

Sweet and spicy!  Fantastic flavor combination; even the BF who usually forgoes spicy foods said this was a winner.  Earlier suggestions to cut chicken into bite-sized pieces seem to be a good idea, as we liked this over rice and it would've made it a little neater to eat.  All in all a delicious meal.  Thanks for this submission!

This was a very attractive dish.  I used half the olives and found there were still plenty.  The dish does have an unusual flavour but it is still very good.  It would be a nice addition to a pot luck.

Wonderful only minor changes i used Italian style stewed tomatoes and I made 3 serving instead of 10.   Served it with white rice tried it over the rice and then tossed the rice into the pan to try for 2nds and tossing it was better but its wonderful!

very tasty meal.  The chicken was rather chewy (could have been the brand?).  Almost like greek flavor with the olives.

I made this recipe using the changes from Zelda Sayre, posted on 1/9/08, and it was perfect!  I did not increase the salsa to 1 cup like she says, but left it at 1/2 cup, and it was just enough to give it a kick without overwhelming the other flavors.  The amount of chicken needs to be decreased, or the spices increased.  I actually made it in the pressure cooker, so, after browning the chicken and adding the other ingredients (except the pineapple and cornstarch) I closed the cooker, brought it to pressure, and 10 minutes later it was ready, with only the sauce needing to be thickened.

At first glance, I was unsure what to expect from this recipe.  After trying it, however, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The flavors are so good together and you get a different taste in every bite.  My only change is using pineapple tidbits instead of chunks.  Even my 4-year-old loves this served over white rice.

I made this for a bridal shower, and it went over SO well. It was great because I just let it simmer while I was entertaining guests...I cooked the rice at the last minute, and "wha-la"! Done!

It was also TOTALLY delicious! People thought I had the party catered!

This was an excellent blend of flavors. No one in the house likes olives, so we subbed in some marinated artichoke hearts because we had some to get rid of, and wanted to make sure we kept the saltiness flavor at least somewhat present. I also used two tsp of cumin, cinnamon, and smoked sweet paprika. Looking back, for using only 3 breasts, that much spice sounds a bit crazy but it made the sauce absolutely amazing. Served over brown rice.

This was fantastic! I also added extra spices as well as some course ground black pepper. I wish I had added more olives and pineapple as I did not have as much on hand as the recipe called for. I served it over a Spanish rice/orzo blend. I will make this again no doubt!

WOW.....this was delicious. I followed the recipe to the tee except for two little things. I used Pork cutlets instead of chicken and I used a little Bad Byrons Butt Rubb seasoning to the cinnamon and cumin. My husband couldn't stop eating it until the entire pan was gone. All the flavors go well together and I can't wait to try it with chicken. I might add a little cayenne next time too...spicey never hurt anyone. Great recipe, Christy!

Amazing! 'm not usually a big fan of sweet and spicy, but this dish won me over! I did add Mandarin oranges as suggested by another reviewer and cut the amount of pineapple and onion by about 1/3. Also, instead of using salsa I used Raspberry Chipotle sauce to keep the balance between the flavors. I will definitely be making this one again!

I enjoyed the wonderful blend of flavors.  Next time I will use green olives in addition to the black olives, and triple the cumin.  I will also consider adding some crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up a little more.

Very tasty! I couldn't stop taking little tasters! I agree with other reviewers. Each forkful does have its own flavor. 
What I did differently: 
I like cinnamon so I put a super heaping teaspoonful of that. Added CAYENNE and CURRY. I don't know if the spices really stuck to the chicken so I'm thinking it may have been better had I added those before the chicken was fully browned. Didn't have olives, so I used CAPERS. Used 1/4 c SIRACHA and 1/4 c SALSA. Was pretty spicy so I did add the MANDARIN ORANGES and a little of the juice. Used red, orange, and yellow mini peppers. I think I might have used like 3 TEASPOONS OF CORNSTARCH. It was all good. I'll make it again for sure and next time I'll use the olives. Sadly...I burned the rice.

Just made this and it was delicious! Even my husband, who usually hates hot dishes with fruits, ate every bite. I used fresh pineapple instead of canned, so I added a little fresh orange juice instead of the pineapple water.

This was good! I enjoyed the mix of pineapple and tomatoes - something I wouldn't have thought of! I wonder how it would be with green olives instead of black?

This was not bad; but, as my family said, "Not bad, but it wouldn't hurt my feelings if you never made   it again."  This usually means not their favorite flavor.  I personally agree with one reviewer who said every bite yields a different taste.  Some of these bites are much better than others, and my family is really used to the same flavor in every bite, making them want one more bite.  This is one dish I wouldn't even change ... too many flavors to figure out how to get only one taste.

This was pretty good, but for me the sweetness just didn't set right.  Obviously, I knew it would be sweet when I read the ingredients, but I was curious.  There is nothing wrong with the recipe.  We just didn't care for the taste.

As is I must give it a 3.  I had to double and even triple the seasonings to give it flavor and it still came out bland.  However, the leftovers were extremely tasty.  I will make this again, except next time I will cut the chicken into bit size pieces and cook the day before serving...that way I am sure to love it!

This is my family's favorite recipe.  I make it very often.  I don't add anything or leave out anything.  I make it exactly as it reads.  I will confess to putting a bottle of hot sauce on the table -- but not everyone will use it.

I made this with bone-in chicken thighs because thats what i had on hand. It turned out delicious.  Both myself and my bf loved it. the cinnamon and cumin add a nice touch to it. I served it over balsamic rice as a side.

This was wonderful!  I made this on Sunday evening so my husband and I could eat the leftovers the rest of the week as  quick, healthy meals.  This goes fantastic with rice.  I followed the recipe exactly.  (Side note - I'm really not much of a cook, so I was happy it was easy, and my husband was really happy it turned out so well!!)

This unlikely set of ingredients leads to a totally satisfying dish - the combo of sweet, spicy, tangy, and salty is perfect.  I stirred in about 2 tbsp of nonfat sour cream at the end of cooking to thicken and I liked the creamier sauce.

This was really great.  I used three chicken breast halves, a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks and a 10 oz can of olives.  Only 4 stars because the wife didn't really like it.

This was great the first time I made it, which was strictly by the recipe.  It was also great the second time when I allowed myself to "measure" less accurately. I really like it for Pot Luck dinners with plain rice.

This dish is so delicious!  I prepared it with both chicken thighs (skin off) and breasts, the thighs were definitely a lot better in this dish, and I usually prefer breast. I followed the recipe pretty much to the "t", however i did NOT add all the recommended salsa, because I didn't want to have a "salsa" taste-salsa tends to be over-powering when added to  sauces.  I only used about 1 tbspn.  And I did not add pineapples, only the juice (the juice is absolutely needed to add sweetness to the sauce, which is needed from all the acid from the tomatoes).  I added a hint more cinnamon and cumin than called for.  My entire family loved this!  Left overs are even better the next day!  I think next time I will add chunks of potatoes to this meal instead of the rice.   You should def try this dish!!!

I think this dish would be better with a fuller flavor piece of chicken. My chicken breasts didn't really absorb much flavor from the sauce. We will probably make it again but with thighs.

I thoroughly enjoyed this meal! It has moved up to one of my permanent favorites.  I had with rice and then the left overs with noodles.  I really liked it on the noodles! A very colorful dish as well!

Without a doubt, different, but OH SO good. I've never been a fan of pineapple, but this dish has changed my perspective... The flavors go so well together! My only suggestions are to use pineapple tidbits instead of chunks, and cut the chicken into bite size pieces before browning. Both times I've made this I served it over white rice. Definately will keep mAKING! Thanks Christy!!

This was delicious--a great mix of flavors! I cut the chicken into 1 in. pieces, which was a good size.  I would add another half onion.  I also added some steamed/canned carrots.  We ate it over brown rice.  It's very filling and it makes a lot.

I thought it was excellent and my 2 and 5yr old's ate it pretty well (probably because of the pineapple).  My husband said maybe add a dash of oyster sauce but otherwise it was good.

I was a different taste for our family.  Being to Costa Brava, Lloret De Mar, Barcelona and all over the cost of Spain.  I loved it, it reminded me of those college trips and so did the boyfriend.  The family found it to be out of there taste some.

WOW.  This recipe totally surprised me.  So different and so delicious!  I used extra pineapple and extra salsa.  I doubled the spices like other users suggested.  Next time I will probably use 1 1/2 times what the recipe calls for instead of double.  This is now one of my favorite recipes!

Following what I read in the reviews before me; I tripled the seasonings and because I like it very much..added smoked paprika.  This recipe really is a make-the-day-before dish... and the reward is that it IS quite good the next day.  :) Thanks for posting..

I'm not sure what it was about this recipe but it was just very average! I thought it was going to be really great and flavoursome with the Pinapple and olives but it was actually rather bland. If I was to make it again I would not add so much tomatoe and salsa, I would add a lot more seasoning and perhaps not cook it for as long as the breasts came out rather dry.

Everyone that has tried this loves it.  I prefer to cut the chicken into cubes and I add a little more of the spices.  Depending on who I am making it for I also like to add varying amounts of hot sauce. Great Recipe, Thanks!

I really wanted to try this recipe and since I did not have all the ingredients at hand and I live alone, I made a few changes and substitutions. I scaled the recipe down in size using only 2 chicken breasts instead of 10.
Firstly, I cut the breasts into bite size pieces just for convenience. I used fresh pineapple and tomatoes instead of canned and added a little pineapple juice. I also omitted the salsa in favour of using fresh ingredients. I left the amount of spice the same, since I wanted to get that Southern European flavour to really come forward and was generous with the amount of black olives.
It was a most enjoyable dish and the next time I make it, I may try adding a few unpeeled mini potatoes instead of serving the dish over rice and adding a splash of full bodied white wine instead of the water.
Bravo and thanks for the recipe.

This was great! I replaced the olives with capers (hate olives) and used fresh pineapple instead of canned because I had some, but otherwise followed the instructions as written and it turned out wonderful!

This was wonderful.  Will definitely make it again and again.  I made it pretty much as written.  Just used fresh pineapple instead of canned and chicken thighs instead of breasts.  Delicious flavors.  Loved the pineapple and cinnamon paired against the savory olives.  Yummm.

I made this for the second time today.  The first time I made it, I didn't notice that it says "salt to taste" at the bottom!  Nothing I did fixed it, but I was intrigued so tried it again.  I have to laugh at myself, because I did mess up again!  For some reason, I misread when I was supposed to use the cumin and cinnamon.  Anyway, this is what I did:  I only used 3 pretty large boneless chicken breasts (we don't like dark meat and there are only 3 adults and 1 toddler); I mixed 2 teaspoons each cumin and cinnamon and some salt, mixed the chicken with that (that was the mess up!), I had also cut the chicken into chunks.  I also browned it in olive oil; seems like in Spain, olive oil would normally be used (that's my thinking), sprinkled an additional teaspoon each of cumin & cinnamon, then stirred in the onion, but used 2, and tons of garlic minced.  Added the reserved pineapple juice, salsa (used 3/4 cup), tomatoes and olives.  I tasted before adding the cornstarch and added some black pepper and cayenne, then tasted.  Then I added the pineapple (salted) and the red pepper strips.  Served over rice cooked in chicken broth with a salad.  Delish!  However, you notice I had to use much more seasoning and my daughter wasn't crazy for it.  That's why I'm giving it a 4, since I had to "doctor" it up.

we loved this; although i did tweak (as i usually do) i did not stray far from the original.  i added 1/2 tsp indian chili powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika and increased the cumin to 2 tsp.  i used half green/half black on the olives.  i also used bone in legs/thighs.  this make a LOT of sauce.  i am wondering if i can freeze the leftover sauce for another time.  thanks so much for the post christyj!

Absolutely fabulous! I took the other reviewers' suggestions and increased the amount of cumin, cinnomon, and salsa. I also added a little smoked paprika, chipotle chili powder, dash of nutmeg, and jalepeno-stuffed green olives for a more authentic flavor. I was very happily surprised by the different flavors in every bite. Will make again frequently. Good job! Delicious ethnic food!

Three or four chicken breasts pounded evenly flat and Jaccard  (  or simple fork ) tenderized prior to marinating them chilled for hours,  will work just fine ( I found the Wish Bone EVOO Garlic herb dressing worked well here ). Browning chicken THEN cutting into bite sized pieces also worked like a charm.  Diced tomatoes also work if you don't have stewed tomatoes on hand.  Go with recipe ingredient amounts as instructed--and be surprised on how well paired the flavors combine!

Given the size of today's chicken breasts, 10  halves would not even fit in the pan.  I used 4 and cut them into smaller pieces.  The result was quite good.

Major stars!!  I doubled the spices and used chicken thighs because we prefer them. I didn't have salsa so left it out. I added diced bell peppers with the onions and -- something I always have to do -- doubled the cornstarch. I served it over rice, and my husband was delighted. He took one whiff of the aroma and announced it couldn't possibly smell that good and not taste good, too. He already wants to know when I'll make it again. Thanks!

No significant changes, just added a jalapeño and used fresh pineapple.  I forgot to add the salsa, unintentional.  This is an excellent meal.  The combination of flavors work surprisingly well together.  My husband and I loved this recipe.

I made it as written, as I think all original recipes should be given a chance before tinkering with them. Actually, it turned out great, except my son didn't like the olives, and in future I may add a bit of sugar to it to cut the cumin a bit. Overall, a winner, indeed!

I made this for dinner tonight.  The hubby said that it is "Some Kind of Wonderful" and would like to have it again.
2. I made this again last night by request of my hubby.  I don't understand the bad reviews from some.  My husband requests this dish.  He loves it and so do I.  I usually add a bit more pineapple than the recipe calls for, that is our personal preference.  If someone doesn't  particularly like an ingredient it can be replaced by something else, or just left out.  Personally we love it just like it is.

Ugh. I made this as written, and the flavors didn't work for me or my husband. He usually takes leftovers to work for lunch the following day, and he asked for this to be smothered in BBQ sauce, minus the olives, to make it palatable. The only positive thing I have to say is the pineapple juice did a good job of tenderizing the chicken.

Made half the recipe, slicing chicken in strips as others suggested. I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used stewed tomatoes and I used medium heat salsa. I liked the contrast of the sweet pineapple with the rest of the ingredients.  Everyone liked it but to me it was a little too spicy (cinnamon & cumin) overall.

I was pleasently suprised by the wonderful aroma and flavor of this dish. The ingredients are all things that taste great on a pizza but somehow this compliments each flavor so well. I served with spanish rice instead of white.

A very nice dish.  I used regular black olives.  Next time -- and there will be a next time -- I'll try a cured olive such as Kalamata which will provide a sharper contrast in taste.  Easy preparation.  I served with rice.

This was delicious! Perfectly flavorful, tangy and sweet, even though we used tofu in place of chicken (my boyfriend is vegetarian). Maybe because the 1 block of tofu we used is so much less than the amount of chicken called for, the amount of spice was just right? We didn't have a red pepper so we used a roasted hatch green chili and jalapeno pepper, which was really really good.

Made it a serving size for two. I doubled the cumin and cinnamon, and did a little extra garlic. The flavor was so good, especially mixed in with the pineapple

I followed the recipe almost to the T---but downsized it some. It's really pretty tasty, and easy, my husband had 2 helpings and raved about it:) Next time I will do more of the cinnamon and cumin mixture. A GOOD different combination.

I went looking for a recipe that I could make with the ingredients I had on hand and found this recipe.  I had some frozen red pepper (I slice, lay on a cookie sheet and freeze fresh peppers and when frozen transfer to a freezer bag), crushed pineapple and tomato puree, so made those changes and it came out excellent.  My guy loved it and asked me to save the recipe to make again.  He loves anything with peppers.

It's next to impossible for me to make anything spicy due to my husband refusing to even try.  Not only did he try this dish but loved it.  Everyone at the table wanted seconds.

Very different and was a hit with %83 of my family. I know most of us do not care for cumin so left that out, still very layered and interesting.  Nice to have something different to do with chicken.

We loved this one. As others commented the amount of chicken is simply absurd and need to be halved at least. I also ditched the cornflour. Aside from that very nice dish

I change the recipe a little bit. three and a half pounds of cut up chicken breast dusted with cumin and cinnamon, s&p, triple the amount of cumin and cinnamon. Brown the chicken and set it aside then sauteed onions and garlic I seared and peeled red and green peppers, added sun dried tomatoes with stewed tomatoes. I used three kinds of olives. I used hot salsa and cayenne pepper. I didn't thicken with cornstarch I didn't think it needed it) Served with quinoa everybody loved it I'll make it again.

This was definitely a keeper. I followed the advice of a few reviewers and doubled the cinnamon and cumin, and added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Great flavours!

I followed the recipe pretty closely except I was making it for 50-60 people so obviously multiplied.  I also chose, instead of adding cornstarch later for thickening, to lightly flour all the chicken before cooking.  This works great for thickening.  After cooking everything, I always put it in slow cookers on "keep warm" and this always makes chicken so tender by the time we eat and it mixes and mellows the flavors.  This dish was very good but in my own opinion, not great!!  It was very much like many other dishes I have made using raisins to add sweetness but in this case used pineapple.  Oh yes, I had a mix of skinless boneless thighs and breasts all cut into large chunks.  Thanks for the recipe!

Flavorful but scaled back chicken  and other ingredients to serve 3-4 people.  I also used some Mexican salsa with fresh tomato chunks instead of the stewed tomatoes.

If you crave a delicious dish different from the normal American cuisine, this is it! Lots of layers of very different flavors. I halved the recipe but used 1 tsp. of cumin and cinnamon. What a wonderful aroma that made. Served over white rice.

After reading several reviews, I decided to try a loose version using items in the pantry:  A combination of leftover nicose olives ( minus the pits), and green pimento ones,; a can of diced tomatoes ( use the stewed ones next time); crushed pineapple ( use the small chunks next time) and a jar of cherry salsa. Also cut the chicken to large bite size & did equal breast and thighs. Liked the white & dark meat combo.  Got rave reviews. Thank you for the ideas!!

Having read a lot of the reviews, I did cut the chicken into chunks and used half black olives and green olives. I didn't add quite as much pineapple juice or chunks, because I was afraid of it being too sweet. Added 1 cup salsa and a few capers. It was terrific yesterday when I made it, but fabulous today for lunch - it gets better  the next day!! Thanks for a great recipe!

JCut chicken into 1/3 portion size, used season diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil  and what will make a difference is the type salsa one uses. 

My preparation passed the test with the family and will next serve to guests for their reaction.

Great recipe! The family loved it! As usual I (at least) quadrupled the spices. As suggested by some I doubled the salsa and halved the tomatoes. I served with bowtie pasta - should have served with rice, the flavours would have worked better.

This dish was very delicious.  My family normally wouldn't eat anything sweet with meats, but this combination was great and not sweet at all.  
I would definitely make it again as a special treat.

I omitted the olives, added adobe, used jasmine rice.   This recipe will be a family mainstay.

For a first attempt it came out rather good. There were lots of left overs. We had to scale it to seven people because of 4 guests visiting and still there was a lot left. I would reduce the amount of initial pineapple juice and add more if needed. I would also use a bit more corn starch to thicken the sauce.

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe! The flavor combination was unique and delicious. I did also cut two (2) chicken breasts into bite sized pieces before cooking and used a cup of salsa, plus salt & pepper to taste. Wonderful dish, a real keeper!

Awesome! I doubled the cumin and cinnamon as suggested. I mixed black and green olives because  that's what I had. Didn't have red pepper, no problem. I used Quorn boneless chicken substitute to keep it meatless. I didn't want to use cornstarch, so I simmered it uncovered for half the time to thicken the sauce. I loved it!

Made it last night.  It doesn't tell you to cut the chicken into bite size pieces but it is important to do that.  A huge hit at dinner and with the gang heading to work with yummy leftovers.

I used 6 boneless chicken thighs cooked in coconut oil, added the onion when I flipped them over. Used the seasonings as suggested but added a little chile powder, salt and pepper. Cut the chicken up when cooked to allow the seasonings to simmer in. We thought it was very good and different. Husband says to make again!

Very good! It could have been juicier, but I had to fry them on the stove and may have cooked them too long. I added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of orange juice which gave the taste an extra brightness. This one's a keeper!
