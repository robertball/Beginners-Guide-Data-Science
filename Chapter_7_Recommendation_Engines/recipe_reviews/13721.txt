My dear mom passed down this recipe, it has been in our family many years and is almost identical to this. It is called Ambrosia Salad. It is my family's favorite. It calls for 1/4 c. shredded coconut(leave out if don't like), but it gives a nice flavor and sweetness to this, 1 c. sour cream or enough to moisten, 1 c. grapes halved, 1 c. mandarin oranges drained( I use more), 1 c. mini marshmellows and 1 c. crushed pineapple drained. Double for large crowds. You can basically add the fruits you like and mix with sour cream until your liking. I think the cherries is a great addition!We especially like this in the summer months but get cravings for it year round! My daughter begs me to make this all the time! This recipe is so close to this and that is why I gave it 5*. I think any way you make will be great! Thanks Tina for sharing!

A friend made this at a birthday party and I ate it without knowing what was in it.  I was shocked that the creaminess was from sour cream!  She said she added all the ingredients except the marshmallows(add them before serving if you don't like mush) and let it set overnight to combine the flavors (and to take away the tang from the sour cream). I tried it at home and used fatfree sour cream with the same results.  I also added a little of the cherry juice.  Great recipe, Thanks!

Don't wait for holidays to make this salad! If you're sick of whipped cream, cool whip and mayonnaise adorning your salads, then this one is for you! The sour cream dressing is wonderful, not too sweet or heavy. Sometimes I add just a touch of orange or lemon extract to the sour cream.I usually halve it, then use very few marshmallows (too sweet). Sometimes I add a banana or two and leave out the marshmallows completely. Thanks Tina.This is delish!

My mother used to make this wonderful fruit salad that she called "5 Cup Fruit Salad" for every holiday and we all loved it. She recently passed away and I was trying to think of what all we use to put in it and I knew we used marshmellows, cherries, sour cream, canned pineapples and something else. I got on here to see if I could find one similar to hers. Back then they did not have mandarin (spelling?) oranges canned and I think (????) she used fresh oranges and possibly canned pears too. We would add cherry juice to the mixture for a colorful dish and would hold off on the marshmellows until it was about and hour before it was served otherwise it would become mushy. Sprinkly some chopped pecans or walnuts on top. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe so that I too can make this fabulous fruit salad that sound disgusting because of sour cream but is truly refreshing and oh so easy to make!

Who dosen't love "fluffy" salads? I like to use colored marshmallows and add a half cup or so of pecans. If I have it, I'll throw in a cup or so of flaked sweetened coconut. This recipe always bends well to whatever canned fruit you have on hand.

The sour cream gave it a wonderfully tangy, creamy texture but wayyyyy too many marshmallows.  I'll try using 8 oz marshmallows next time.

I added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts and I sliced frozen strawberries in half.  I really liked this recipe, but it makes enough for 10 to 12 servings.

I love this and have made it for years. I cut or tear the cherries in half. I put the cherries, mandrain oranges and pineapple into a colander and drain the fruit well. I pour the fruit and marshmellows in a bowl and pour in the sour cream and mix well. I let it sit over night in the fridge. Yummy!

This was very good. Made it for playgroup - both the moms & the kids loved it. I added only about 3/4 the marshmallows and sour cream. It was light & not runny at all. Thanks for a quick & easy pleaser!

This is a family tradtion at our home with a few changes. I drain all my fruit the overnight and the next morning mix sour cream, marshmellows, pinapples, oranges and then I use a few cans of mixed fruit instead of the cherries then mix it all together. Then we take the fruit juice and make our family punch. My children come home every Holiday expecting it! Its a healthy and delicious receipe.

This was just okay.  The sour cream was a kind of harsh flavor so I added coconut.  That made it just right.  Enough sweet against the sour cream flavor.  I guess with the coconut I'd give it five stars.

It tasted good. However, if I was to do it over again I would do less marshmallows, (I think less than half of what it calls for) and more fruit, probably put some bananas in there too, and more thoroughly drain all the fruit. That's more like a mistake on my part. It was too soupy. But like I said before I loved that taste of it all together. And it's true, it's even better the longer it refrigerates.

I only had 1/3 of the marshmellows it called for so I used that many.  It was a great salad--I don't know why it called for that many--I will always make it with 1/3.

Easy and quick to make.  I used the advice of others and halved the recipe.  Then I added coconut and used less marshmallows.  I also used frozen pineapple (thawed) since that's what I had on hand.  I drained all fruit well and the salad wasn't soupy at all.  It was great.

I have made this per the recipe and really enjoyed the fact that it was not too sweet. I used fruit w/o sweetened syrup, and half pkg of marshmallows. If you use the low-fat or fat free scour cream, it is a fairly healthy salad.  I have added pecans and toasted coconut on occasion just to change it a bit. Its quick to prepare.

I had to give it a star because it was the only choice.  My boyfriend grew up on food like this; I want to please him, but I also know that it's time for him to eat more healthful food.  Once is enough for this calorie-laden, food-value-lacking recipe.  Real fruit in a real salad is better!  This is dessert.

I added a few bananas and green grapes to give it more volume and to make it not so "canned" and it turned out fabulous!  I also added about 1/2 c flaked coconut and about a tablespoon of the the cherry juice and it just gave it a little extra touch.  Fabulous and easy!!!!  I think this will be a big hit tomorrow and I'll definitely make this during the summer.

Delicious and refreshing!  A classic treat.  I decided to let the salad sit in the fridge for a while so the marshmallows would "melt" into the sour cream and sweeten it up a bit.

this was a hit with my family.   My son had turned the leftovers into a pie with a granola crust.  I was actually surprised at how good it turned out.  I added banannas to the fruit and I think next time i'm also going to add frest peaches.  I like this a lot!

I've been making this for years.  Good for pot lucks.
In my version, I also add one can of peaches, add 
3 or 4 bananas, and green and/or red seedless grapes.
I don't use the cherries.

Scrumptious! I had this at MOPS the other day and came home craving more. I can't believe it's the sour cream that makes all the difference : )

Made this to go with Thanksgiving dinner.  I was a little worried about the sour cream, but it turns out great!  I doubled the fruit, but otherwise left the recipe alone.  Everyone loved it.  It easily fed 15+ people.  The longer it sits the better it tastes (the second day the leftovers were even better).

I needed a fruit salad recipe to bring to a Thanksgiving potluck.  This one fit the bill.  I was a little apprehensive about the sour cream but it works well in this.  I added a touch of powdered sugar like someone had suggested.

This is a great fruit salad recipe.  I made it for my family's Thanksgiving, and then countless dinners at home since then.  I love the sour cream (as opposed to a whipped topping).  I didn't use all the marshmallows called for as it seemed like a lot.

I love this salad. It tastes so good. If you let it sit in the fridge awhile, the marshmallows absorb the juice and get soft and tasty!

Yummo! Our family's new super fast throw together dessert.  I just added fresh strawberries and bananas to make it more fresh tasting. Chilled for an hour to allow flavors to mix then served in wine glasses with few cut up strawberries to make a pretty presentation.

Pretty good! I made this for a friend who just had a baby. She has 3 young children, so I made this  to entice the little ones. I halved the marshmallows. Next time I will only use 1/2 to 2/3 of the 16 oz container of sour cream instead of the whole thing.. I did use low fat sour cream, and it was delicious. No need to make this fattening. Next time I might add halved green grapes and coconut.

This brings me back to childhood! Love this recipe and agree-you can add whatever fruits you prefer. We used a can of mixed fruits,small can of mandarin oranges, small jar of maraschino cherries, small can of pineapple chunks, about a 1/4 c of flaked coconut and 8 oz sour cream (enough to moisten) like the idea of adding marshmallows before serving-will try this for Christmas. I usually make this for Easter dinner and I like to use the fruity kind of marshmallows for the pretty pastel colors! If people didnt know it was sour cream they couldnt tell. People have asked me why dont I just use cool-whip and I say that would make it unbearably sweet, sour cream is just right!!!

My family has traditional made a version of this salad every major holiday for as long as I can remember. And I am over 60 years old. We use the ingredients listed plus apples, bananas, grapes, dates and either pecans or walnuts. We also use sweet cream instead of sour cream. And it is impossible to decide whether to consume during the main meal or as dessert or simply to eat it till it is gone.

This is delicious. However, I used fresh pineapple and added some grapes. I added a small box of dry instant vanilla pudding and some juice from the marashino cherries jar to the sour cream, which kind of kicked it up a notch.

Love this salad, however my husband thinks there are WAAAAY too many marshmallows in the recipe as it's written.  I used an 11 oz bag this time and he still thought it was too many, so next time I'll try 8.  I also add bananas and grapes.  So good!

Very, very good!! I made this for a funeral dinner and I kept a little scoop of it to keep at home so I could try it and I wish I could have kept the whole thing! I doubled the recipe but only left 1 package of marshmallows and that was plenty! The sour cream added a wonderful flavor to the salad! Loved it and will definately make this again!! Thank you!

This was way too sweet for us.  Might be improved by using much fewer marshmellows.  Made it when my grandkids were here and even they wouldn't eat it!

Delicious! My entire family (teens & adults) loved it.

Changes: I used fresh summer fruits--nectarines, bananas, red grapes, and fresh pineapple. I added a bag of sweetened coconut.

My mom made something very similar. She added a package of shredded coconut. My husband hates coconut, so I leave that out. It's best if made a day ahead, or at least several hours.

I have been eating this since I was a little girl. Recently I tried using Non-fat vanilla Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and it was amazing!!!! I think I'll stick with the yogurt-my family couldn't tell the difference and I knew I was sneaking some extra protein in a very yummy treat!!! Just an FYI I used about 1/2 of a large container of the yogurt, and I use crushed pineapple instead of chunks.

I saw this and had everything to make it. While I was very cautious with the sour cream because just looking at the 16oz of sour cream, I was very worried that it was going to be too much. And I was right. I followed everything else as written far as the fruit and marshmallows were concerned, but after mixing a little bit of sour cream in at a time to where I felt it was just enough to be creamy but yet not so much that it was drowning in sour cream. I did add a small jar of maraschino cherries at the very end after they were well drained. Then topped with some granola per serving. I'll make again with my adjustments but not as written with the full amount of sour cream.

Used the recipe as is and i must say WOW! My husband is extremely picky but he absolutely loved it and so did I. I must admit that i thought it was going to taste off with the sour cream but i couldnt have been more wrong. The sour cream actually balances it out quite nicely. I love, love, love this recipe!

This has been a tradition at our holiday meals for at least 30 years.  We add a couple cups of walnuts.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving--it is generally demanded that I make it, or else! Everyone seems to love it. It is so easy to make, I feel guilty receiving praise for it. The change I make to it is to halve the number of marshmallows--there are still plenty of them even if you only use half the amount, trust me.
