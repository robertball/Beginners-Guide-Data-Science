This cake wasn't quite sweet enough for me the first time tried it so I used peach pie filling instead. That made all the difference in the world! Now I have this recipe at least once a month! Thanks :P

This was a perfect recipe to make for our new neighbors.  A cake was in order, but after all of the heavy sweetness of the holidays, I wanted something light and yummy.  I made two loaf pans so I could taste test it before giving as a gift.  I took a picture and submitted it, so hopefully, you can see what it looks like soon. =)

I see this has gotten a few mixed reviews, but my cake turned out great.  I used lite peaches in juice from concentrate, and I beat it with a mixer for two minutes.  I baked it in a bundt pan sprayed with pam for 35 minutes and it looked great.  It was pretty bland at first, but as it cooled and sat for a couple hours, the peach flavor got stronger.  Good recipe when you're trying to eat lighter!

This was great!  Light and not over sweet.  I made sure to use peaches in juice because it sounds like if you use the ones packed in syrup the cake becomes sticky.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of peach schnapps to make sure it had a good peachy flavor.
We were taking this to a friend's house but it didn't quite make it.  We each tried a little bite and ended up eating half of the cake.  I had to cube the rest since I couldn't exactly bring a half eaten cake.  We had it with ice cream and some kind of peach sauce would have been nice over the ice cream.  We all finished off the bowl of cubed cake that night.  It was great plain to snack on but could also be fancied up with whipped cream, a peach sauce or ice cream and sliced peaches.

This was just okay. It was a nice little experiment to see what could be created with just two ingredients, but it was nothing special and not something I'm likely to make again. Even with a delicate peach flavor I felt it needed something, so I topped it with a strawberry rhubarb sauce I had made from my garden last summer and fresh whipped cream. Thanks for sharing the recipe - it definitely was quick, easy, and fun to make!

The angel food mix I used was a 16 oz. box  - and I used a can of peach halves in heavy syrup (15 1/4 oz) - which I cut up myself (perhaps there is less liquid in a can of peach halves rather than already diced peaches????).  I spread the batter in a 9x10x2 ungreased baking pan (9x13x2 would work too!) and baked at a slightly higher temp (I have a gas oven) - until it was pretty brown on top and a knife came out clean.  It was not soggy at all!  It was great - hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream on the side!!!! I had mine with powdered sugar sprinkled on top (also hot out of the oven!).   Great for a quickie Movie night dessert/treat!!!  Best to eat it the night it is made - not suited to be "leftovers."

I have made this twice with in the last week. Last Sunday for Easter (my husband loved it and got upset when I took the leftovers to work on Monday!) and today for a baby shower. I made it into cupcakes for the baby shower. Topped it with whipped cream and they were a big hit. Watch them in the oven because they will scorch easily in cupcake form. 
I can see myself making this again and again. I may try other types of fruit too. Manderin oranges, pineapple etc....Who would have thought...Thanks! 7/10/04 Syill making this cake and still loving it! For a nice presentaion lay a piece on a plate top with a spoon of whipped cream and slice of fresh peach. People will love it.

Use a name brand of angel food cake as it does make a difference.  I also feel it needed more peaches, so next time I'll use a larger can of diced peaches.

Here is the real skinny on this one!  I have made this for years with a 20oz can of crushed pineapple win its own juice.  What really makes the cake is the topping.  I mix a small package of vanilla pudding, one cup of milk and whisk until thick.  The add an 8oz tub of coolwhip.  I serve the topping on the side.  I had planned to try it with peaches as I love them!  I will use a larger can than this recipe calls for and use my topping.

This could be the best I've ever had.  I used about 5 ripe fresh peaches sprinkled with about 1/3 sugar to make the juices flow.  I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of water to the mix.  Not too sweet & ultra light- just perfect!

I tried this recipe because of all of it's great reviews and was disappointed with the results. I found that the cake had very little peach flavor to it and was much heavier than a typical angel food cake. I also noticed that the cake was rather sticky as a result of using the syrup from the peaches instead of water. Kind of bummed out after such high expectations.

There's nothing better than something delicious and easy!  I really like this and so does everyone I've served it too.  Nice too because it's light, low calorie/low fat.  SECOND NOTE:  I added more peaches last time I made this and when I turned the pan over to cool, the cake plopped out onto the table in pieces, so don't add more peaches!  Prepare as directed!  Thanks for the recipe...yummy!

Was not to sure about adding a can of peach pie filling to the cake mix. However it worked great. Husband loves peaches with angel food,so why not mix them together? Great idea. Will try other fruits. Maybe lemon pie filling.Thanks for the idea.

I wasn't crazy about it because I don't like cooked peaches.I made it for my father and it went over really big.So if you know someone who has to eat light or you yourself want a naturally sweetened dessert,Try it!

I agree with some of the other reviews that this was a bit sticky.  Because of that I cubed the cake, stirred in some diced fresh peaches and cool whip.  Was a big hit at our July 4th celebration!

This was so easy and sooo good!   Make sure you use peaches in juice, not syrup, otherwise the cake will be sticky and too sweet, and I'm pretty sure angel food cake is the only kind that will work with this method since other types need egg.   Be sure to cook the angel food cake completely.  My first attempt was undercooked, and cake fell.  This really is a great, quick, and easy recipe!

Waffled between 4 and 5 stars . . . good, went with 5 stars because is an easy low-fat dessert.  Peach schapps adds a little extra peach flavor; add to mix, glaze or whipped topping.

I have made this 2 times in the last week.  First as quick cupcakes for work... with a can of cherry pie filling instead of peaches.  They were so sweet and refreshing, they didn't even need frosting and were gone before the night shift showed up.  Only issue with cupcakes it that they really "deflated" while cooling.  Probalby will try a loaf pan next time.


Then the second time as written with the peaches, also very yummy, but not super sweet.  I served it to my visiting parents while we played cards after dinner.  We had it on the table and kept picking and picking at it until it was just about gone!  I think I'll try it with apple pie filling this fall.

I thought this was delicious.  It is sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth but not a diet breaker.  I really like it with low fat cool whip on it.  I will continue to make this recipe.

I used fresh peaches from my peach tree. Since I had them in the fridge, I was unable to get fresh juice from them. I cut them up finely and used 1/2 cup less water than the box called for. It turned out GREAT and was eaten by everyone within hours.

A guilt free desert and a great way to use up some of the excess peaches from the garden.  I just wish the fruit chunks would not fall to the bottom so much.  The cake was baked in a tube pan.  It is upside down once it is down and the cake was weighted down...Other than the appearance, it is a great cake!

I usually don't eat angel food cake because it's too sweet for me, a sweet eater.  However, this was wonderful and I will definitely make it again.  (I didn't read the directions of not putting into a bundt pan until I had the batter in the pan.  What a mess!)

I followed the directions of this recipe and the cake box.  I baked my cake in a tube pan and it turned a lovely brown on top, but when I inverted my cake, I ended up with hot, soggy cake on the floor.  A small  bit of the cake was salvaged, and it tasted great, so maybe I will try this recipe again. I'm embarrased to give this recipe a low rating when it's received many rave reviews, sorry Abart.

This cake is beyond excellent, and simple.  I wasn't going to make it at first, due to the mixed reviews, but boy am I glad I changed my mind!  I bake and decorate cakes out of my home for a living, and I would definitely make this for company or a customer.

I honestly can not believe how easy this recipe was. I thought that ingredients were missing and that it would be a total flop, but it is excellent. This recipe is light, easy and delicious.

Yummy! I've never been a huge fan of plain angel food cake, but I needed something quick and easy for an office potluck, and just happened to have a mix and peaches. So easy, and everyone loved it!

Easy and so tasty.  I used a can of peaches in passion fruit syrup.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  Everyone is simply amazed at the few ingredients.  I have given this recipe out to many friends.

What is great about this recipe is how easy it is. However, I made quite a few changes.  I used 20 oz. crushed pineapples in juice instead of peaches. I used a mixer to really get the fruit mixed with my Betty Crocker mix, and added 1 tablespoon of peach schnapps. I bet it might taste good with Malibu rum instead of schnapps.  I baked it in two 9 in. loaf pans. While it was baking (make sure you bake it thoroughly), I took another reviewer's advice and made sort of a sauce, turns out you really need this sauce to make the recipe great. I mixed about 3 tablespoons more of crushed pineapple, with a tub of fat free and thawed cool whip, a package of powdered vanilla pudding and about a cup of fat free milk. It's not a fluffy sauce, it is more smooth and pudding like, but it tastes great and serve on the side.

This was really good! Yes: It deflates after cooking, it's a little sticky, and don't invert the tube pan.  But for an easy dessert it's great.  In a tube pan, I had to cook it 15 minutes longer, so I'll be trying cupcakes or loaf pans another time.

This is the easiest dessert I've ever made. Only two ingredients and it was delicious. I made a dozen cupcakes and a small cake. Simple & easy recipe!

This was simple to make and yummy to eat! Not my favorite dessert ever, but will probably make again when i want something lighter and easy.  Tastes best with whipped cream.

Very good recipe, my Mom loved it.  My only problem with it is that it's not a good diabetic recipe.  Angel food cake in general is very high in sugar, especially a mix.  I will make it for others, but I can't eat it myself!  If you aren't diabetic, it's wonderful!!

I used peaches in heavy syrup. The texture was eggy and the cake rose then dropped in the middle a few moments later.

I read a lot of reviews before I tried it.  I was trying to clean out the freezer so I tried to use 15 fluid oz of frozen peaches instead of a can.  There must be more mass and less liquid, because I got a cake so dense that it fell out of the pan when hanging upside down.  Peach flavor was barely there, but the cake was moist and yummy nonetheless.  I had some meringe icing to make the collapsed cake look better.  I then made a raspberry sauce sweetened with honey.  Was a totally fat free and relatively healthy dessert.  Woudl do it again!  Might try the schnapps trick next time, but didn't have any.

This is very delicious. I also tried using crushed pineapple instead of peaches and we loved it. I think I'll try mandarin oranges next.

Per the reviews, this recipe could be more specific...people were getting different results depending on the canned peaches and the size dish used. I had sliced peaches in heavy syrup. The cake mix box called for 1 1/4 cup water. I strained and diced and slightly mashed the peaches but still I only got about 1/2 cup liquid so I added water to get the right amount (ok, some of that added liquid was raspberry liquor and as a saltaholic, I had to add a dash) I used a 13x9 pan and baked it for 28 min per the Betty Crocker cake box directions if in 3 loaf pans. It came close to going over the edge of the pan. It seemed to be cooking too fast so halfway I lowered temp from 350 to 325. The 13x9 was tricky to flip onto a cooling rack and it almost ended up on the floor. After it cooled, the center fell out onto the rack, maybe because of how much I had jostled it in the flipping,  but still tasty. With the heavy syrup peaches, it was reminiscent of cotton candy sweetness. I liked it enough to try it again, but with fruit in natural juice instead of syrup.

great alternative to the tradition DRY mix. This added a great flavor. I also added a tsp of vanilla.
