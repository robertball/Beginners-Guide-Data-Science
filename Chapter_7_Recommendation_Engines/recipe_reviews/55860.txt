FANTASTIC! This was a great baked chicken. I changed some things to make it even more flavorful for us. For the breadcrumb mixture I substituted "pepperidge farm herb stuffing" instead of plain bread crumbs and also added 1 tsp oregano along with the basil. I used 4 large chicken breasts and used 4 tbsp olive oil and 2 cloves garlic. I also sprinkled a little salt and pepper on the chicken breasts before dipping them into the oil/garlic mixture. Oh to make this easier, use 2 pie pans for the dipping. It's so much easier than a bowl.. unless the chicken breasts are smaller or tenders. I did not think there was too much breadcrumb mixture as other reviewers said. I did have a little bit of each leftover (oil and breadcrumb), so I first drizzled what was left of the oil on the prepared chicken breasts in the pan, and then sprinkled what was left of the breadcrmb mixture over this. Then I sprinkled all of this with some garlic powder. It took about 40 minutes for the chicken to be done. It was SO MOIST and SO FLAVORFUL. Better and SO MUCH EASIER than my usual parmensan chicken recipe. WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN. Thanks!

I'm going to make this tonight. I started reading the reviews and got very fusterated.  If your not going to make a recipe how it is, don't write a review.  Your not rating this recipe.  Post your own recipe!!!!  I don't get it.  Had to get that off my chest.:)

With  my modifications, it came out perfect! Used 6 chicken breasts. Was out of italian breadcrumbs so used chicken flavored stove top stuffing crushed well. Used 4 tbsps of olive oil and 2 tsps minced garlic. Put chicken breasts in a ziplock bag, added garlic, oil mixture, added 2 tsps adobo, 1 tsp each of salt & pepper, mixed well. Dipped the chicken pieces in the crumb/parmesan cheese mixture and baked for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. I've made similar recipes and they've lacked in flavor - this is the first time the flavor was perfect (in my opinion!) so I made sure to write it down this time!! This is one of those great recipes that is perfect for altering to your preference. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe.  Here's what I did with it.  I added melted butter to the olive oil (about equal amounts), used Japanese style panko crumbs and FRESH parmesan.  I pounded the breasts to ensure even and quick cooking and after they were baked (I cooked them at 375 degrees for 30 minutes)I put a little sun dried tomato pesto on top of each one and covered that with slices of mozza cheese.  I then put the pan under a hot broiler for a minute.  The only part that took any time was pounding the breasts.  I whipped this up for unexpected dinner guests and served it on a bed of rice pilaf on a large platter.  It tasted great and it looked impressive.  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers.  Do try the panko crumbs if you can find them as they make a light crispy coating and the texture is more appealing than regular bread crumbs.

Really great, pretty healthy, chicken dish. Cooked exactly 30 minutes and they were perfect. I used panko bread crumbs because I think they offer a better crunch. Also, I cooked the chicken on a cooling rack and flipped them half way through so that they wouldn't get soggy on the bottom. A trick I learned watching America's Test Kitchen.

Let me start by saying that I hate breaded chicken.  I decided to give this a try because I was pressed for time.  We only eat chicken/ fish/veggies/grains and sometimes it gets boring.  I was completely amazed that this was so good!  I used a little more garlic, seasoned bread crumbs, and a dash of italian seasoning and season salt.  I also used a softer parmesan cheese that made all the difference.  Chicken was juicy and full of flavor.  By the way, organic chicken will always taste better!  Those in doubt..it is a keeper!

The Chicken was beautiful, but the recipe doesnt call for the chicken to be seasoned, I suggest that you do if only with mrs dash or salt even. But otherwise it was superb! It went well with mashes patatoes (my creativity) and DONT cover the pan with foil when baking because it will come out soggy. So leave it as is and sprinkle enough of the excess breadcrumbs over the top of the chicken. And the recipe calls for way too much breadcrumbs and after you dip the chicken in the breadcrumbs you MUST throw them away (contamination etc..) and that is a massive waste, USE YOUR DISCRETION. OTHERWISE THE CHICKEN WAS SUPERB!

Absolutely Delicious! Quick prep and came out moist and tasty.  Also melted mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken and served with marinara sauce and side of spaghetti. Is going to become a regular meal in my house!

Our family really enjoyed this chicken. This meal was extremely flavorful, and juicy, perhaps adjusting the spices to our liking did it. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to try something a bit different for dinner. I did make the following changes: I allowed the minced garlic to sit in the oil for about 10 mins. and added Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the bread crumbs. I also used Italian bread crumbs and pounded out the chicken into thin cutlets, turned it under the broiler for five minutes and topped with shredded mozzarella while under the broiler.

I've made this dozens of times.  Put a little oil in your baking pan.  Squeeze the fresh garlic into that.  Sit in just a barely warm oven for a few minutes to let the garlic rest and flavors mix.  Then dip and roll your chicken in that and then roll in the bread crumb/parmesan cheese mixture.  Put back in the same baking dish and bake!  That's all I do.  Plain bread crumbs with parmesan cheese.  It really doesn't need any other flavors mixed together.  It's a wonderful easy moist dish!

this recipe was awesome. it was quick and easy and my fiance and i loved it. i used italian bread crumbs instead and used more garlic-we love lots of garlic! i also threw in some cayenne pepper in there for a little spice. i also used the thinly pre-sliced chicken breasts so they took no time at all to bake-about 18-20 min or so. i served them with a mushroom and peas side dish sauteed in white wine. it was a great dinner!

I gave this four stars because it is easy, inexpensive, and great for leftovers.  The taste is good, too.  To me, this recipe is a "base" recipe.  That means it is just the starting point.  The recipe has a basic flavor so you can personalize it in many ways.  Serve on spaghetti with sauce, serve on wild rice with mushroom cream sauce, serve on a bun with mayo for a sandwich, etc.  I followed other reviewer advice and cooked on a rack, turning 1/2 thru cooking time.  Turned out perfect.  And, I broiled it for 5 minutes with mozzarella cheese at the end.  I do not pay attention to overall scores anymore, so those who are all worked up about how others review a recipe need to relax.  Instead, read the reviews and you can get so many interesting hints on how to tweak a recipe.  To me, sharing and learning from others is important, as I am not a "wanna be" professional chef.  Thank you.

Delicious.  I have been looking for a good baked chicken recipe that is easy and good.  Chicken was juicy and flavorful.  I added 3-4 times the amount of garlic, but made 8 pieces of chicken (4 large chicken breasts butterflied and halved).  I also seasoned the raw chicken breast with part of a packet of good season's dry itialian mix.  My husband loved this and I will definitely make again!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but it's in my recipe box to make one night.. I wanted to write a review, because I see many people complaining about how people don't rate the recipe as written. Instead they make their own little tweaks and rate how that dish turned out. I don't mind this at all, I welcome it. If people were to write their own versions and post them, we'd have loads and loads of the same recipe with little differences.. I always check the reviews before making a dish to see what tweak I can do to make this recipe even better!

RATING AS PER ORIGINAL RECIPE= AVERAGE.  I made this recipe only looking at the rating and number of reviews; I should have known better.  The “most helpful” reviews all modified it in one way or another.  In the end the recipe does need to be modified because it is bland and the “crust” doesn’t come out crusty at all.  All the reviewers made modification to remedy these aspects: change to panko, Italian breadcrumbs, drizzling oil to moisten the bread crumb mixture, double the oil and garlic mixture, or add mozzarella. 
It wasn’t bad, just really ordinary.  I could make several modifications and make this more appealing as per the reviews.  That being said, I would rather keep a similar but better recipe in my recipe box, for which I would not have to keep notes as to the substantial modification that it needs.

I have used this exact receipe for years and love it.  For a change, after the chicken has baked, put a slice of mozzarella or provolone cheese on top of each breast and pour your favorit sauce over it.  Put it back in the oven until the sauce bubbles and the cheese melts.

i dont know if i did something wrong but i followed the recipe exact and it just tasted like i rolled the chicken breast in bread crumbs.  there was no flavor whatsoever.  ill read some reviews and adjust the recipe accordingly next time i make this.  i think it would be awesome with a few extras done to it, or maybe even a white sauce over it.  but as is its pretty bland.

I make a similar chicken recipe.  Instead of dipping the chicken in oil, I use an egg wash (a beaten egg with a T. of water).  I use panko bread crumbs and romano, instead of regular bread crumbs and parmesan.  Then I brown each side of the chicken before baking.  Also, try to cut large breasts in half lengthwise.  It will get done much faster.  I serve the chicken with pasta and a half and half mix of marinara and alfredo.  This is a favorite.

These are great baked chicken breasts. I didn't use all of the crumb mixture (actually about half) and needed more of the olive oil and garlic . I also added a bit more garlic because I love the stuff! I brined my chicken breasts in a saltwater solution for a while before follwing the recipe so they would retain moisture, drying them with a towel before putting them in the olive oil. They were very moist. I served with a marinara sauce and some melted Italian cheeses. Delicious!

Superb dish and easy to do! I made it even easier by coating the chicken in pesto sauce instead of using dried basil and oil. This allowed me to cut down on the Parmesan as the sauce has cheese in it of course. I also used garlic paste from a jar!
As pesto can be salty, be careful when adding seasoning!

Delicious! I've been making something similar for years and it's definitely a favorite in this house. Instead of olive oil I use an egg wash and did the chicken twice to get a nice coating of breading. I added some garlic, oregano, basil and parsley to the bread crumb mixture for a nice herbed flavor. I spray a glass baking dish with Olive Oil PAM and turn the chicken once during cooking. Very simple and very good!

i didnt think this was all that good. i decreased the servings to two, but i followed the instructions exactly! i didnt think it had any flavor. 
i've made almost this same thing before, but instead i marinated the chicken in italian dressing before coating with the bread crumb/parmesan cheese. that way is a lot better in my opinion. but you could use this recipe for that one too, just marinate it before coating!!!

I was looking for something quick, easy and tasteful to do with BLSL chicken breast.  This fit the bill.  The only thing that I did differently was to use Panko Bread Crumbs with Italian Seasoning.  The crumb mixture with the parmesan would also be good on fish or pork chops.  Will keep to use again. UPDATE:  I cooked this again last night using the Panko Bread crumbs and we loved it.  This is an easy, easy way to cook BLSL chicken, that is tasty.

All my kids loved this recipe and gave it 5 stars.  I took the advice from the other reviews and marinated the chicken in Italian dressing before I dipped the chicken pieces in 2./3 cup grated parmesan cheese, 1 TBSP Italian seasonings, 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1 cup Panko bread crumbs.  I had to bake the chicken 50 minutes since my chicken was on the thick side.  The chicken came out crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Enjoy!

This is my new go-to recipe for chicken. I bake it on a cooling rack set on a baking sheet to make sure it crisps up nicely. You can experiment with different seasonings. A couple of my favorites are lemon pepper and dry ranch mix.

Very good! Followed the recipe exactly. The coating is flavorful and crunchy.  Very easy to make.

Gave it four stars instead of five because it's unnecessarily greasy with the olive oil.  I've made basically the same thing for the past 25 years using fat free Italian dressing to dip it in.  It's delicious and a lot lower fat that way.

this recipe yielded such deliciously moist chicken breasts! my only changes were to halve the recipe and to sub egg whites for the olive oil to cut back on fat. the flavor of the breading was superb and the chicken was cooked perfectly. so often it's the simple recipes that make such great tasting meals - doesn't seem like it would be much from the ingredient list but we really enjoyed this tonight.  my two year old ate almost an entire chicken breast and that is downright amazing!

I have been making something similar for years.  Only difference is melted butter instead of oil.  Oil would be healthier though. I also chop/mince about 8 cloves of garlic and equal parts Parm and crumbs.I combine any leftover crumbs and butter and drizzle over chicken before baking. Not too garlicy :)It's a winner

I've been making a version of this recipe for about 30 yrs. now- here is what I do. I melt about 1/4- 1/3 cup of butter with several (3-4) cloves of garlic that I put through my garlic press. I make fresh breadcrumbs in my food processor( use whatever type bread is on hand). I mix the fresh crumbs with freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano, salt, pepper,some sesame seeds,& some finely chopped fresh basil. I coat the chicken in the butter then pack on the coating, lay them on a baking sheet & depending on the thickness, bake 30-40 min. @ 375. This may not be the healthiest method but it sure is the tastiest & I can be sure of several requests for the recipe. It's also wonderful cold. My family always liked it served with a salad & scalloped potatoes.

I was pretty satisfied with this dish.  Like other people complained about, it was difficult to get the chicken breading "crunchy;" however, I must say I prefered the breading soft! The softer breading provided a better taste to the chicken, gave it a better texture, and provided more moistness to the chicken. Overall: Taste: 4 stars, Simplicity: 4 stars, Presentation: 4 stars, Satisfaction: 4 stars

Make this for a baked chicken contest and got third. Very moist. Suggest that you cut the chicken breast in half so they are thinner (they cook better) and you dip them in eggs and then in the breading and then in the garlic/oil mixture then back into the bread crumbs, overall very good and yummy!

Delicious! Moist! Quick!! I took the advice of others and used 4 Tbsp oil, the panko crumbs, the fresh parmesan, and a tsp of salt and pepper. In addition, I used 6 cloves of garlic, minced with the olive oil (we LOVE garlic around here). To the coating I added 1/8 tsp of cayenne for some kick and 1 tsp of onion powder. It was flavorful and mmmm good!!

This recipe is awesome, I put the garlic through my garlic press into the olive oil and microwave for about 20 seconds to really get the oil tasting like the garlic.  After baking for 30 min. I pour a jar of marinara over the chicken and sprinkle with mozzerella cheese and bake an additional 10-15 minutes (make sure the cheese doesn't burn). This is awesome and a family favorite. Super easy too!

I appreciate all the reviews with variations.  Everyone has their own special way of doing things, and if the recipe can be tweeked just a touch to make it great, I'd like to know that before wasting a dinner.  That said, I combined a few variations, but it was kinda soggy and bland to me.  He loved it though which is why I gave 3 stars.

I have made this for years, I use melted butter instead of olive oil, and just italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese, dip chicken in melted butter then in mixture of bread crumbs and cheese, any remaining butter drizzle over chicken after placing it in the pan. Bake 30 minutes on 350 comes out nice and moist, turm over once to ensure even browing. Thats all you need to do!! Great

I just made this recipe tonight for the first time! It turned out great! Very juicy chicken with great flavor. SUPER easy recipe too, so that's a big plus for me. I should say I made one modification: I used italian style bread crumbs, and I think that's where a lot of the good flavor came from. Overall, a good recipe, that i'll probably repeat.

Very good.  I cooked mine in a skillet in a bit of olive oil just because I didn't want to turn on the oven.  I usually cut chicken breasts in to three pieces instead of pounding for even cooking.  I cut across where the breast begins to thicken and then split the thick part in two.  Took about ten minutes, or less, for the chicken to cook.

Delicious. Took the suggestion from other reviews and seasoned my boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins with Lawry seasoning salt before dipping in the olive oil/garlic blend. I did need to make more of the oil blend, will use 4 Tblsps. olive oil and 3 cloves of garlic next time. Progresso Italian flavored bread crumbs worked great in this recipe.

This was very good.  The bread crumb cheese mixture made way too much and I didn't want to throw it away so I peeled and diced some potatoes, added some sauteed onion, butter and the bread crumb cheese mixture and baked until they were tender.  It complemented the chicken very well!  My husband LOVED the chicken!

Excellent!  First time I've ever made chicken parmesan, and it couldn't have been easier or tastier.  All I added was about 1 clove garlic for each chicken breast and a tsp. Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs.  I am going to put marinara sauce and mozarella on top of the left overs for tonights supper.

Delicious! I found that I needed at least double to olive oil and garlic but other than that it is fantastic. I use a roasting pan to bake these in and it makes them crisp all around (the first time I followed the recipe and used a glass baking dish, but the bottom side came out really moist/mushy, using the roasting pan allowed all sides to be crisper but the chicken was still very moist!)

I loved this recipe just as it is.. but had to write to give a variation of this using a whole chicken with skin still on: Up the garlic to 3 bulbs, eliminate the breadcrumbs entirely, and substitute the basil for dill.  Add 1/2 an onion and 1/2 a lemon with zest. I realize that this is a quite a different meal, but it was totally inspired by this one and I love crispy chicken skin (my bad)! Smear the oil/garlic/lemon+zest all over and in the chicken. Sprinkle S&P, dill, parmesan inside and out of the chicken.  Cut onion in 4 and put one piece in the chicken and 3 out.  Put a couple of slices of lemon in an open pan. (cast iron fry pan is great.) Bake 350 until leg turns loosely.. baste and cook 10 more minutes to crisp. yum! Thanks for the inspiration!

My 4-year old can be a bit of a picky eater, but she'll eat an entire chicken breast when I make this.  I make extra and the leftovers go in crusty buns for my husband's lunch the next day.  The only change I make is to marinate the chicken breasts in Italian salad dressing for a few minutes before coating them in the bread crumb mixture.  Yummy!

This chicken turned out great! The breasts I used were a little thick so mine took almost 40 minutes in the oven. I put the olive oil/garlic mixture in the microwave for a minute or so to slightly heat it to really infuse the oil with garlic flavor, and worked great! Chicken was moist and tender and the breading is delicious. I will use this again, thanks (:

Great! I cooked it differently and it was even better. I blended the basil, pepper, garlic and olive oil in one dish. I used at least double the garlic and olive oil. That way the chicken was seasoned instead of the bread crumbs. I used a pinch of coarse ground salt on each piece of chicken, dipped it in the seasoned oil and then into the Parmesan bread crumb mixture. It tasted Great!

The whole family loved this recipe. Even my 3 extremely picky kids, including my oldest who rarely eats any dinner I make so that says a lot. My husband said "Wow this is really good chicken," and the best part about it was how quick and easy it is to make. I did use half butter and half olive oil in the oil dipping mixture and used about 6-8  minced garlic cloves which I simmered in the butter/olive oil before dipping the chicken into it and I used Panko instead of bread crumbs and then turned up the heat to 425 durung the last half of cooking thinking that might give it a ccrispier crust. This turned out great and will now be a regular meal for us. My only issue was I didnlt spray the pam with cooking spray and it stuck to the pan so I would recommend spraying the pan before cooking. Thanks so much for posting. Can't wait to make this again.

Very surprised with all the five star reviews.  I just finished preparing and eating this dish and found the recipe to be fundamentally flawed in a number of ways.  

I started out with 4 pieces of chicken and even with two less pieces than the recipe called for, the amount of EVOO and garlic was not enough.  I added one extra clove of fresh garlic and another splash or two of EVOO to sufficiently coat 4 pieces of chicken.  

The crust cooked up nice and crunchy and it looks great when done.  I used panko breadcrumbs which probably helped some, but upon taking my first bite, I found the flavor to be lacking.  It was actually quite dull and uninspiring.  If you are looking for a dish with some excitement, this certainly isn't it.   

I may experiment with it a little bit next time by adding some additional seasoning and perhaps some Italian dressing to kick it up a notch, but as written, this dish is a definite pass for me.

As written this is a 4 star recipe, with small modifications it is an easy 5 star.  First off, THANK YOU for submitting this it was awesome.  I took others notes and used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Also, I cooked the chicken on a cooling rack so they would not get soggy.  I topped the cooked chicken with motz and broiled, nice play on chichen parm.  Great meal.

Great Recipe. It is good as is,but leaves the door open for your imagination. This is a recipe that is usually critizied by cooks that are just begining to learn how to cook. A healthy dish , I might add.

This was delicious and easy, great for a weeknight meal. I used Swanson herbed stuffing, crushed up, instead of the bread crumbs, and increased the oil.  Served it with spaghetti, mmmmm mmmmm!

Very yummy.  Only complaint is that the first few pieces ended up with way more garlic than the pieces at the end.  Suggest just sprinkling the minced garlic after the chick is in the pan for more even seasoning.

The chicken was so moist and it smelled great cooking.  I like the idea of dipping the chicken in the olive oil & garlic rather than egg.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add marinara sauce and cheese.  A keeper

This is fabulous.  If your breading was soggy, check the temperature of your oven; it may not heat as high as the setting indicates.  And, if you thought it was dry, you most likely left it in the oven too long.

i just cooked this for me, my husband and my brother.  first and foremost, the SMELL of it cooking is amazing.  i used three cloves of garlic, big ones, i think that was part of it.   there is no need for that amount of bread crumbs, i had a ton left over and i halved four full breasts.   served with pasta and arrabiata sauce, was very simple and tasty.  up the garlic and down the bread crumbs and you're good to go.  will be making this again.

This recipe is EXCELLENT for anyone without a lot of time.  I threw this together with some rice and a few extra cloves of garlic and VOILA an easy delicious meal.  Wolfgang thought I had slaved over the stove all day ... when I just threw it in the oven before he got there.  I'm adding this to my top 5 starting lineup of recipes!

Great recipe!  I used chicken legs instead of breast, and I love garlic so I added a whole lot more.  I didn't add the Parmesean because I had run out, but the recipe was still great.  To the bread crumbs I mixed in some finely chopped Oregano.  In addition, I wrapped 2 slices of bacon around each leg.  Then I drizzled the remaining olive oil mixture over the chicken, and sprinkled the remaining bread crumbs too.  I've already made this recipe twice and it was a hit both times.

I absolutely love this recipe! Mine turned out very juicy and full of flavor. My boyfriend said it was the best chicken he had ever tasted and that it is restaurant quality. I read about 50 plus reviews before I tried it and then I proceeded with what I thought would be best. There's just one thing I want to clarify... I read a lot of reviews that said they used chicken breasts. The recipe calls for chicken breast halves which I'm sure makes a huge difference with flavor and time. I just cut my chicken breast lengthwise down the middle to get halves. I also pounded the thick part a little to bring it down to about an inch and a half of thickness. I used a cup of Japanese Style Plain Planko breadcrumbs, a cup of parmesan cheese, and about 6-7 large garlic cloves rather than the small amount the recipe called for. I also added a tsp of salt, tsp cayenne pepper, and a tsp oregano to the breadcrumb/parmesan mix. The timing was perfect.

Best chicken parm recipe I've ever used! And so simple. I basically followed the recipe, only I did half butter half olive oil. I also used Panky bread crumbs and seasoned it with an Italian herb, salt and pepper. I used 3 large chicken beasts and pounded out the chicken and baked for 30 minutes at 350 then 10 more minutes at 375 (the bread crumbs weren't browning and clear juice wasn't coming out, so I upped the heat for 10 extra minutes). Then once it turned golden and it was sizzling with clear juices I added provolone cheese on top and broiled it for a couple minites. Served with spagetti and marinara sauce and a side salad. It was incredibly juicy and very very flavorful! I've also used an egg mixture to bread my chicken but I'm sold on the olive oil/butter and garlic now!!

This recipe was really flavorful. I did however make a few adjustments. I used italian breadcrumbs instead of plain an added a little bit of Italian seasoning as well as seasoning my chicken breasts with some salt and pepper before coating them into the oil and breadcrumb mixture. I might need to use a wire rack next time because the bottom of my chicken breasts got a little soggy. Other then that it was moist an delicious.

This chicken turned out very moist and yummy.  However, the recipe calls for more bread crumbs than you need and then directs you to pour the rest over the top before baking.  Nobody wanted to eat all those extra bread crumbs so we ended up raking most of them off.  I would probably make this again with less bread crumbs and without dumping the left over crumbs on top.

I made this chicken last night.  I cut the breasts horizontaly (some of the my children can't eat such a large portion).  I ground a box of stove-top stuffing mix for the bread crumbs (my children love it). I had to increase the oil. The stuffing crumbs covered 10 breast halfs.  If I hadn't made them smaller I would have had too much bread crumbs. (did not salt the chicken because the crumbs were salty enough) DELISH!

I was in a rush for a quick easy chicken dish for a finger food party.  So used some chicken drumlets, and dunked them in some italian salad dressing, then followed the recipe pretty much, except for upping the garlic and adding fresh basil and rosemary.
  Cut back on the cooking time, and my reputation for being a whiz bang good cook  remains intact.  Thanks for a quickie idea  Jimmie

Very good. It's amazing how delicious the most basic of recipes can be. This one yielded flavorful, very moist chicken breasts. I wasn't sure about the basil at first but it was really what made this recipe. There was only one small hiccup ~ the olive oil and garlic mixture was not even sufficient to coat the 4 chicken breasts I was using. Otherwise, follow this recipe to the letter and you can't go wrong.

This was quick and easy,I used some chicken thighs I had left over came out really tender inside and a little crunch (cheese) outside. I think this would be good breading on fish which I'm going to try next time.

I'm always looking for new and innovative ways to make boneless/skinless breasts and this was rather tasty. It definitely needed more seasoning on the chicken itself, not necessarily in the breadcrumbs. Instead of mincing garlic, I used my mortar and pestle to make a paste with the garlic & olive oil then dipped in Panko breadcrumbs for an extra crunch. The result was a nice, garlicky, crunchy dish. I will definitely try this one again.

Some people recommended adding salt, but if you're trying to cut back on salt it is perfect how it is in this recipe. You can always add herbs to increase taste as needed without adding salt. I used fresh basil & it worked great. Thanks for the recipe :-)

Pretty good.  I mixed it up Shake N Bake style (I hate dishes).  The bottom was a little soggy, but the flavor was pretty good. I felt like it could use a little more kick though.  Salt?  Quick and easy nonetheless.

Oh wow!!! I am so impressed. I usually don't make baked chicken dishes, so this is my first one that I am so impressed with. Like most of us, I did alter a bit. I was making for just myself on a night my hubby and son were gone, so I only used enough ingredients and chicken for myself. First, I seasoned chicken with garlic salt then added lemon pepper seasoning to the bread crumb mixture. I threw more garlic in because I love love love the stuff. Cooked in baking dish for thirty, but for some reason when I went to take it out, it wasn't nearly done, so I cooked for ten more minutes and served it with garlic asparagus and a baked potato. Went great with a glass of chardonnay! I will definitely be making this again for my husband and son!

As an Italian who hasn't made chicken parmesan for years because fried chicken isn't good for you, I was pleasantly surprised with this basic recipe. It did not have enough garlic for my taste (I used about 15 cloves - one half of a giant head of garlic - instead of one clove). I also grew up using Romano cheese which is stronger and has more bite than Parmesan which is more popular among most Americans. Needless to say, I substituted Romano instead of Parmesan cheese. I had Progresso bread crumbs on hand which I used for the bread crumbs. Even though the bread crumbs had basilico in it already, you can never have too much basilico in my opinion, so I added additional basilico like the recipe called for.  When it was just about done I took it out of the oven, put pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese on it, and let it finish cooking until the cheese melted. It was a real hit with my seven year old who called it "chicken pizza".

Much better than recipes that call for egg and flour. Olive oil and pre-minced garlic is all you need and easier too. Absolutely delicious! I did use panko like other reviewers, but that's just my family's preference. EXCELLENT dish!

It was delish!  I marinated in basil italian dressing for an hour or so and used that to mostien the chix then rolled in the bread mixture.  It was juicy and had a great flavor.  Lots of yummy left overs to put on salads.

This was sooooo good : )  I ended up adding 1tsp of garlic powder, 1tsp onion powder and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture.  I used the Kraft grated parmesan cheese -  I find it sticks better to the chicken  than when I grate my own cheese (Maybe because that cheese is almost the same consistency as the bread crumbs?).  I also flipped the chicken breasts over after fifteen minutes of cooking to get even browning. I also put the chicken on a plate then sprinkled the crumbs on top of the chicken, that way I could still save any left over crumbs and use them again in the next few days.

I made this recipe for my bf and I and we both loved it! This is definitely a keeper.. I just changed a couple things. I doubled the garlic and instead of using shredded parmesan I used grated parmesan cheese along with Italian bread crumbs. It tasted like something you'd order from a restaurant, it was that good! One side note..make sure you dont add too much if any salt to the mixture since the cheese and bread cumbs will make up for the salt. This would be great if used for chicken parmesan or just a side of broccoli and cheese over rice like we had. I added a bit of butter to the caserole dish and covered the chicken with foil and baked on 350 for 40mins.

This came out really good.  I know I should not rate it on my changes, but I did change it a bit.  I marinated the chicken overnight in Italian salad dressing, but then breaded it according to the recipe and baked at 375.  My chicken breasts were quite large, so they took about 50 minutes to cook, but were still extremely tender and juicy.  Thanks for a great recipe that we can play with according to our own tastes.

Flavorless, soggy, and overhyped recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe, but added extra garlic.  If I were to do it over again I would have used my Italian Season breading, and added garlic powder and other seasonings.  I added extra topping and as a result the topping became mushy.  I also had to cook the chicken for around 45 minutes.  Only good thing was that the chicken was tender and not dry.

Excellent recipe.  My boyfriend and i LOVED it.
Things that i changed:
I added much more garlic but i LOVE garlic.  I really didnt measure it as I love an over abudance of garlic.  I warmed the olive oil and garlic in the microwave for a minute to infuse the garlic into the oil.  I also added Italian Seasoning to the bread crumb/parmesan mix.  Also, i did about a 1 1/2 cups of parmesan instead of 2/3 cups because i love the parmesan flavor.

We loved this recipe!  My whole family loved it!  I cooked it about 5 minutes longer and also broiled it for an extra crisp.  I definitely recommend using the Italian Seasoned breadcrumbs vs. the plain.  GREAT recipe.

This recipe turned out tasty, moist, easy to prepare, and cooked fast. I used 4 large breasts, and I did not cut them. I found that I needed twice as much olive oil (about 4 tbs) to get them very moist before breading. I also used 3 cloves of minced garlic instead of 1. I found that after breading, putting the extra bread crumbs on top was not necessary. I also baked them for 45 minutes as the breasts were quite thick. This is an easy tasty no-brainer dinner.

This recipe was one of the best chicken parm dishes I've had - and I used to work in an italian restaurant! About 20 minutes into baking, I added some italian seasoned tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese.  I will definitely make this again.  It was so easy and tastes like I spent hours making it!

So instead of evo I used mayo. I just put the garlic in the mayo slathered it on the chicken coated with the bread crumb mix and POW! It was moist, crunchy, and full of flavor! My husband feedback was I don't know what you did here but I will need this repeated tomorrow. Too bad I'm all out of chicken breast.

WHAT I CHANGED (I'd give it 4 stars with my changes): 
Used Kellogs corn flakes crumbs instead of the bread crumbs so it'd be more crisp. Panko would have done well also. I added more garlic to the crumbs in addition to what was in the oil. After I put it in the pan, I topped with salt and oregano.

I also thought the chicken was too soft cooking it at 350 so about 10 minutes before I took it out I increased the temp to 425 to crust the outside.

The flavor wasn't very good, and the breading was soggy when the chicken was done.  My husband ended up "revamping" the chicken I'd made by throwing it in some oil in a pan and turning into fried chicken.

Good and easy. I needed double the wet ingredients (oil and garlic) compared to the dry. My husband didn't care for the soft breadcrumb texture, but I was fine with it, especially given the ease of preparation!

Not bad, just kind of plain.  Added 1T of butter to the oil/garlic and heated slightly to melt.  Added a little marojam to the crumb mixture; plenty of breading left over, froze for future use.  Chicken came out kind of dry and tough.  Definitely not a dish for company as is.

I eliminate the bread crumbs and use a lot more seasonings for full flavor.  Add oregano, paprika, maybe a little salt too.  Also, we only use butter and cook in a cast iron skillet.  But the oven would be good too! Delish!

Great easy meal! I took 9 frozen chicken breasts (4 hungry guys and me, so 2 each and 1 for me) and defrosted in the microwave for about 15 minutes with a few glugs of Olive Oil, salt, pepper and minced Garlic (I cheated and added it from the jar) and some butter to make it stick. (You can leave the kitchen, or in my case, the house for 30 minutes and work out during this time!)

Breasts all coated well and thawed, dip into mixture as stated but also added 1 cup of crushed Corn Flakes to give it more crunch and a dash of Cayenne Pepper and Garlic Salt. Chopped fresh Basil, because I have it in my garden and love it! Okay for you people that HATE when someone changes the recipe; there wouldn't be any comments if no one changed it to their liking! :) Topped with some Mozzarella cheese the last 10 minutes and turned up to 375. DON'T OVERCOOK! It was moist and delicious!  

Served with Seasoned Broccoli and Garlic Parmesan Mashed Potatoes.

Very good base recipe,  seasoned chicken with old bay & paprika prior to coating and used panko with herbs provincial mixed in and turned out fantastic. You can mix your seasonings & herbs for a twist and even throw some franks red hot or sarichi prior to coating for a buffalo wing kick!

I made the recipe as written (although did turn the chicken over half way through).  It was great, not soggy at all.  I did have a lot of breadcrumb mixture left over (I only did 4 pieces of chicken).  I would definitely cook this recipe again.

I rated this recipe 5 stars for many reasons -- 1 - my entire family loved it, which is difficult to achieve in my house; 2 - it was a piece of cake to prepare; 3 - the ingredients are readily available most of the time and 4 - it is good enough to serve company. I especially liked using olive oil instead of eggs for the first step in breading the chicken. Much easier, less messy and very tasty. I did add 2 extra cloves of garlic because my family loves garlic, but that is the only change I made. Thank you!!UPDATE: -- I accidentally added 1 tsp of oregano instead of basil, then added the basil anyway. It was wonderful, and that's how I make it now. I taught my non-cooking son how to make it, and he made it for his friends, who couldn't get enough of it. Excellent recipe.

Made this last night! Only had 4 pieces of chicken to use, but that was more than enough for my boyfriend and I. We only had one each, so I have leftovers, yum! I took a suggestion from another comment and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I don't have olive oil, but used vegetable oil. Works just as well. I used this receipe sort of as a guide. I didn't do any of the measurements or anything, but it came out great. Chicken was moist...just perfect! Boyfriend approves, and he isn't much of a garlic guy. I dished garlic noodles and mixed veggies with this chicken. :) Will definitely make again.

This was good; I read through lots of reviews and decided to increase the spices and garlic since we like things with lots of flavor (and many reviews suggested doing this).  With spices doubled, it was very good and I will definitely make it again.

This recipe will give you the BEST breaded chicken you've ever had. Do entire breasts, or cut them into strips for delicious baked chicken fingers. I like to add some dried dill and lemon pepper seasoning to my breading. Tastes a lot like KFC, but without the nasty grease.

I love the way that the garlic and parmesan came through in this!  A nice change from the usual breaded chicken.  I found it was easier to brush the oil and garlic on rather then trying to dip the chicken into that mixture.  I also seasoned my meat with salt and pepper before adding the coatings.

This is simply delicious. I have a picky chicken family (hubby always thinks it is too dry) and everyone (hubby, and 2 picky kids) gobbled it up and gave me compliments! Thank you for this recipe! I cut the chicken into thirds and made tenders, served with pasta, marinara sauce, broccoli and bread. The chicken was done at 40 minutes.

i was a little skeptical with this recipe -- looked too simple and easy. but it was exactly that -- simple, easy and SUPER flavourful! granted, i did add more garlic and added some italian seasoning to the bread crumbs (and salt and pepper)! but the olive oil and garlic (instead of egg) was super! loved this, and will be making again -- especially when in a time crunch! thanks for sharing!

It was fantastic. My husband who HATES chicken ate this right up then went back for more! The only thing I changed was the bread crumbs. I used Italian flavor instead of plain, it only added to it though. Absolutley a keeper!

This had really good flavor but I wasn't crazy about the texture.  I wish the bread crumb mixture wasn't so dry.  I will make this again but next time I will drizzle some evoo on top of the chicken before I bake it and see if that helps.

This was excellent and easy to prepare.  I had 'very plump' chicken breasts... so I baked them for 45 minutes as another reviewer did.  Delicious.... even as left-overs.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Simple but delicious. I really liked the result of using olive oil to coat the chicken rather than egg. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This chicken was delicious! I used 4 large breasts instead of 6 and I had to double the olive oil and garlic amounts because after the first 2 breasts there wasn't any left and I cooked the chicken for 45 minutes which turned out perfect. It was so juicy and flavorful. Definitely a new family favorite.

It's hard to find a way to make chicken breast stay moist, but this recipe does it.  Delicious and different.

It was very strong. I used larger chicken breasts, and I would suggest going smaller for this recipe. My family liked it though.

So I added potatoes to this and ended up liking them more than the chicken! I tossed them in the garlic oil before I did the chicken and put them in the bottom of the greased pan I sprinkled them with salt, pepper and some of the breadcrumb mixture. I just laid the chicken on top of the potatoes to bake. Both were yummy!!!! Thx for sharing!

When I make this again I'll add more seasonings to the bread crumb/parmesan mixture. To me it was just too bland. I had some pretty thick breasts so I baked them for 35 mins versus 30 and the meat came out great. More salt, and I'll dwell on what else I'll add, but with a few tweaks this could become a standard at my place because it's so easy!

Chicken without salt is simply bland, no matter what else you do to it.  I sprinkled salt on each thigh but next time I'll also add a half teaspoon or so to the breadcrumb mixture.  I used shredded Parmesan and Panko breadcrumbs because that is what I had on hand.  I'll use less breadcrumbs next time because 1 cup was too much, even after sprinkling more on after the thighs were in the pan, and the leftover had to be thrown out.

good and simple. I've never used garlic oil instead of egg when breading chicken, I heated the olive oil and garlic in the microwave a little so the flavors could blend. is this a well known alternative I've just never known about?. I've made this twice second time I used it as a sort of chicken parm dish with red sauce, I think I like it this way better than my actual chicken parm recipe.

It was a very good for dinner & still good the next day for lunch! I'm definitely making this again. The second time around I will add a slice of swiss or provolone cheese between the chicken & breading.

A great weeknight meal!  I use chicken tenders to cut the cooking time in half.  Before I leave for work in the morning, I put them in a Ziploc bag with the oil and garlic (put through a garlic press), adding salt and pepper to taste.  We like more garlicky flavor.  I use Italian breadcrumbs and omit the basil. While it cooks I make a green salad and some angel hair pasta (which also cooks quickly).  I serve the pasta with a little butter and parmesan, and it's a dinner everyone likes in about 30 minutes!

This is my first review, but I just made this recipe and had to let you know how great it is. I also used melted butter and olive oil to which I added grated garlic, fresh chopped basil, and fresh chopped parsley.Then I had thin pork chops thawed so I used them instead of chicken. Wonderful! Can't wait for my boyfriend to get home to try them!

This recipe has become a staple--my family loves it.  I'm a little lazy, so I just toss the chicken with a little oil and seasonings and eyeball the breadcrumbs and parmesan, and bake it on parchment instead of greasing the pan.  I also experiment with different seasonings, but I stay fairly true to the original recipe, and this chicken is fantastic--moist and delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe, Karen!

These were really good!!! Good by themselves, however, I felt like I needed some sort of sauce. I think these would be really good for a chicken parmesan, or maybe w/a cream sauce. I will definitley make these again but try them along w/something else!

This recipe has become a staple in my house.  I even had to send some back with my daughter when she came home from college for the weekend.  I use Olive Oil PAM instead of the olive oil, and add a bit more garlic, but other than that, follow the original recipe.  Very easy and very good.

Excellent dish, I followed the exact recipe with chicken tenderloins and it came out even better than expected. I ended up using much more than the called for garlic mixture and made it with the healthier canola oil and it came out great. 

A tip for anyone, if serving over pasta (I used angel hair), add a bit of butter to the pasta and use any leftover garlic/oil to flavor the pasta. It comes out great.

Awesome awesome recipe.

Very good flavor - my picky kids loved it.  I would decrease the amount of breading next time - I put the remaining breading on top as suggested, and it was a bit too much.  Very good, otherwise!

Excellent recipe!  The olive oil is a lovely idea and adds a nice flavor (depending on the brand, of course); the chicken stayed wonderfully moist which, when dealing with mass-quantity purchased frozen chicken breasts, is a huge plus.

I needed a very quick and very easy recipe that took little or no effort, as I'm 8 months pregnant. This was so easy! And my husband and I really liked it. I took another reviewer's advice and covered the pan with foil; it crisped up the chicken a bit.
My suggestions: 1. don't top chicken with remaining bread crumbs, as it doesn't really do anything for the final product; 2. use a pastry brush to brush oil on instead of dipping chicken into oil.
Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper!

Fantastic! I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. Also, i made some adjustments - double olive oil and garlic (i made only 4 breasts, and already used all for dipping), added a little bit of garlic powder in the breadcrumb/cheese mix, and baked a bit longer - 40 min. Delicious! Also, i put some breadcrumb cheese mixture (adding more for each breast) in the Ziploc bag, put chiken breast in it and shook it - easier to evenly cover it in the crumbs. :o)

Really good! I used two chicken breasts, scaled the recipe in half, yet used twice as much garlic ( I let the garlic meld with the oil for 2 hours). I also used equal parts of bread crumbs and parmesan. The result was really juicy chicken. I cooked my two chicken breasts for 25 min. and they were perfectly cooked. I served these with brussel sprouts and mushrooms (from this site) and served whole steamed artichokes with creamy horseradish sauce as an appetizer.

This is a first-rate quick & easy dish that even my uber-picky husband enjoyed!  We're big fans of garlic, so while I cut back on everything else (to make 2 servings), I used TWO garlic cloves, more Parmesan than breadcrumbs and Italian herb seasoning.  I also followed someone's advice about using a thermometer, and when it hit 170*, it was PERFECT (took about 40 minutes).  Will definitely make again!  Thanks Karen!

I prepared this last night for my husband and me.  Since I only used 2 chicken breasts, I halved the other ingredients, and that seemed about right. After the chicken had cooked for 30 minutes, I covered my husband's portion with pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese, and cooked about 5 minutes longer, until the cheese melted.  My husband loved it, especially since chicken parmesan is a favorite of his. Very easy to prepare, with ingredients most of us have on hand.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks, Karen.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I made it exactly according to the directions.  I served it with chicken flavored rice & corn but next time I think I will serve it with linguine & spaghetti sauce for a chicken parmesan dinner.  Very Good!

More garlic was added, 1/2 clove per piece of chicken.  Everything together was pretty good.  I also made it with Steelhead trout, that was 4 stars.

Like many other reviewers on this site, I decided to tweak the recipe a bit and let you know how great this variation is.  My wife doesn't like chicken breasts so I substituted pork shoulder steaks.  Bread crumbs are out because we're gluten free so I went with cornmeal.  Since oil can be fattening, I used egg whites instead.  Not a big fan of basil so I selected saffron instead.  Anyway, I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter (wait, no, I baked the shoulder steaks at 375 for 40 minutes, sorry).  I plated this delicious dish and added a combination of ranch dressing and Durkee's hot sauce over the top to add flavor. Delicious!  My wife can't stop raving about these baked chicken breasts with garlic parmesan!

We love this chicken!  I did make a few changes.  Cut the chicken into bite-sized chunks and coated individually.  Used Pepridge Farm herb seasoned stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs.  Omitted the basil.  Used a bit more garlic and olive oil, and added poultry seasoning to the bread crumb mixture.  Delicious!

Instead of Olive Oil I use one or two beaten eggs with a dash of Dejonge mustard and garlic in a shallow bowl. In a Baggie I add Panko instead of breadcrumbs and sometimes mix itup with cornflake crumbs too, fresh grated Parmesan, a dash of Lawrys salt and pepper., some parsley for color.  ( helpful to pound the breasts for more tenderness prior to prep. ) spray .lightly with olive oil . 
Bake at 350 on a rack in a 9x13 pan. For 30 minutes.   This will crisp both sides of the chicken.
Been making this recipe for 40 years plus. Was my Moms recipe. We call it Chicken Parm 101!

Made this garlic parmesan chicken tonight for my daughter, her boyfriend, my son and nephew, all in their 20's and they loved it.!  I tweaked it a bit by adding oregano, sun-dried tomato pesto and used Shake and Bake parmesan bread crumbs.  Served it over spaghetti, with salad and fingerling potatoes.  I must say it was absolutely delicious and everyone loved it.  I will definitely come back to this website for more recipes.

Very good - the olive gives the chicken a great moist texture.  Of course, I did add a touch more garlic.  I may also try it using panko bread crumbs instead (personal preference).  It will be a keeper in our household.

This chicken was delicious!  The only thing I would recommend is doubling the olive oil and add a 2nd garlic clove.  Everything else was followed exactly how the recipe was listed.  Some people said it had no flavor, this is definitely not the case.  It was extremely flavorful and the bread crumbs did create a crispy coating.  I too get extremely annoyed when people change the recipe and then rate the original recipe.  Rate the listed recipe, we don't want to hear what you did to change it to suit your tastes!  Thank you Karen for this wonderful recipe which I will definitely be making again.

This is my second go at this, first one was great and the second one would be no different. I changed the recipe for 8 servings.
That is correct in some of the reviews about not enough oil to coat six servings much less my eight servings. Those who whine about not enough oil sounds like they've never been in the kitchen before?
I pour in about a 1/2 cup of Olive oil and mince the garlic to look like it covers most of the bottom. Come on guys, Really!

Made this last night, It was very good. It cooked in about half the time recommended though. I added some tomato sauce at the end on top of the chicken, then a slice of mozzarella. I put it back into the oven to let it melt, and served it over spaghetti with some fresh julienned basil.

Amazing recipe! instead of basil I used freshly home dried parsley flake. And served with steamed broccoli which I topped with Parmesan cheese, zesty lemon seasoning and a little pepper and dash of garlic powder. The wife loved it and the one year old loved the broccoli. So defiantly and A+ recipe for the whole family we felt like. :)

It wasn't great. It's a good way to cook the chicken, but there wasn't enough flavor to the breadcrumbs. I used Italian breadcrumbs.

Family loved it, must give 5 stars! Made it as written AND did add some bottled Caesar salad dressing to the olive oil and garlic to dip the chicken into. Don't get upset - I know it's not in the original recipe, but this is my tweak. It was PHENOMENAL. Will make again.

This recipe is so yummy! I took the advice of another user & put the oil and garlic into a zip lock bag and coated 1 chicken breast at a time. I also roasted the garlic prior to adding it to the oil. The chicken comes out so flavorful & tender! I think the next time I make this, I'll put the chicken on a rack inside the pan, to raise it up & allow the bottom to become crisp, too. I paired the chicken with roasted veggies & my man loved it! Another allrecipes success!

I made the recipe AS IS and it was easy and delicious. The chicken was flavorful and juicy. I'm completely confused by the folks saying it was bland. I agree there are a ton of breadcrumbs but I used them all anyway and sort of "buried" the chicken in it. I think it helped seal in the flavor and juiciness. I just scraped most of it off before serving. My whole family loved this -- even the picky eaters!

I really liked this recipe! The smell is just divine! The only problem I seem to have is that there is not enough olive oil to dip all six pieces of chicken in! About half way through the baking I do add a little more breading and Parmesan so it is crispy.

I made the recipe as noted but did double the oil.  I turned halfway through cooking so both sides brown. 
Delicious.

Amazing. Instead of basil I used fresh ground thyme also added some granulated onion and garlic.  Lastly some French onions crunched up in the crumbs.  
Seen on another site that Italian dressing was used instead of oil of course all the ingredients weren't there  but that tastes better than oil.  Then even use Italian bread crumbs.  Yum ! Only ten minutes most prep and so worth it!  This is the first time I've successfully made bread crumb chicken without it all falling off. A lot to do with the greasing of the pan I'm guessing. So worth it!

This recipe sounded like a great idea for the party I was planning. I decided to try it out before the party, to make sure it works. Good thing, I did! And twice! First time I followed the recipe exactly but by accident put the oven on 300 degrees, instead of 350 - it came out juicy inside but too pale and soggy outside. Next time, i follow the recipe exactly, and the chicken was beautifully golden but too dry inside. I did not like it. Plus, the taste was so-so... I will not do this again.

Husband loved this, but there was a LOT more breading than we needed for the chicken even after adjusting the recipe.  I coated fresh asparagus with the leftover breading and an egg wash then roasted that.  It was as big a hit as the chicken!  Great combination.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was OK.  It was moist with a  a nice crust but I prefer more flavor.  It was a bit bland for my liking.

Very average if you make the recipe as is. It's fine for an easy dinner that the kids would eat but it's kind if a boring entree.

This recipe was soooo goood!! I love to cook and as I've gotten older I rarely measure but did follow the basics of this since I adjusted this for 2 servings. I heated basil infused oil and about the same amount of butter and finely diced garlic. When cool I added a good squeeze of lemon and dredged the chicken breasts in it and then in the breadcrumb mixture of Parmesan, pepper and some Lawry's Seasoned Salt. I baked it on a rack like someone else suggested at 425. It came out a little crunchy, and still very moist inside. It pared up very well with Easy Lemon and Garlic Broccoli also from this site. What a lovely dinner we had!!! Thanks Karen.

I use this recipe a lot because chicken is one of the only meats that can be agreed upon in my household and this is so easy!  It tastes great and the chicken always comes out moist.  My boyfriend took leftovers to work the next day and heated them up in the microwave.  He said everyone was raving about how good it smelled!  Great recipe.

Love the recipe! The chicken was very flavorful and moist, though the coating was really mushy. I turned on the broiler for a few minutes toward the end to 'crisp' up the coating on the top a bit, and it was beautiful but the bottom was still mushy. I may try to cut back on the oil a bit next time around, but overall was very delicious.

This is not a review as I have not made this yet. As for the ones that complained about the others not following the recipe before they review, sometimes you just don't have all the ingredients called for on hand. So we have to improvise. That is what cooking is about. I go here for ideas. If you want to follow the recipe exact, go ahead.

This was absolutely delicious, and my husband who doesn't like Parmesan loved it.  SO easy, too!  I did throw out about 1/2 cup of the breading b/c it was just too much, but I'd say that reducing the mix by about 30 percent woudl be right on.  It was so delicious!!

EXCELLENT!  I found a new and EASY way to make breaded chicken.  I used panko because that is what I had.  I also baked the chicken for 30 minutes at 425 degrees and it turned out crispy and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.  This will be my way of making breaded chicken from now on!

It was good but not really great. I make the baked chicken nuggets from this site and they are more flavorful and not much more work. Just cutting the chicken in smaller pieces.

This was a huge hit here. I can't believe how easy and fast it was to prepare too. I had this in the oven in minutes. My husband loved this and raved from the first bite. I used a little more garlic than called for and sprinkled a bit of kosher salt over the dish before baking. This was fantastic, thanks for posting!

This is one for your keeper file and really no need to make changes!  I used panko crumbs but that's personal preference, I like the crunch. My chicken breasts were thick so I cut in half through the sides, which gave me two large, yet thinner, pieces of chicken.  This saved me from the bother of pounding (which I avoid because the chicken juices splat out, even if they are sandwiched in wax paper) plus it's faster.  I also cooked the cutlets on my cookie cooling racks in the sheet pan, to keep the meat crispier. (A good trick when cooking with fattier meats, too, to keep meat leaner).  And finally, I had three chicken breasts for 7 people and because I'd cut them in in half thinly and they still looked full-sized to the diners they felt full and I still had leftovers!

Superb :)  Only next time I will flatten the chicken breasts so that they cook faster.  Tonight the chicken breasts took a good 45 mins to cook through.

I thought this recipe was way too simple to be good. I was so wrong! The chicken is extremely juicy! Instead of bread crumbs, I used Panko.  I love the extra crisp. I wasn't sure about the Parmesan cheese... But I'm so glad I added it anyway! It gives it such a different flavor. I plan on making this AGAIN tonight!

This was a very quick way to prepare a full-of-flavor last-minute chicken dinner. I did not use the basil, only because I didn't have it, and I didn't sprinkle anything over them after they finished cooking, prior to serving. I truly think that what put them over the top was the oil and garlic. My husband and I are real garlic lovers and I used 4 cloves.  We loved them and I will definitely use this recipe again (and again, and again).

Yuummy!!! Never would have thought that such simple combination of ingredients would be able to offer such a delicious twist to the regular baked chicken breast, the parmesan on the breading will definitively keep everyone guessing what is it that makes this simple dish so special, :D served with my own recipe for cheese mash potatoes, a garden salad and some Heineken's, all you'll need is a nap afterwards, thank you again for sharing!!!

One of our family favorites - I use Panko breadcrumbs, and turn the oven to low broil for the last few minutes just to get an extra crispy top.  The kids even love it!

I crushed up garlic and cheese flavored croutons for the bread crumbs. And instead of olive oil, I used italian dressing. It's in the oven now and smells soo good.

Easy to make...great moist taste with plenty of flavors.
Also added 1 tsp oregano and doubled olive oil and doubled garlic which was just enough to coat all the chicken and used Panko bread crumbs as others suggested.
A very quick, dependable easy recipe!

Per my husband.... "a keeper".  You could easily season this completely differently and get a great result. Cajun, Mexican seasonings. Great starting place for lots of options. Chicken was moist and looked very pretty.

Love this! So easy. Have made this basic recipe as is and jazzed up. Instead of plain olive oil, I use balsamic based homemade Italian dressing (or store bought would be fine too) to marinate chicken in before dipping in breadcrumb/cheese mixture. THE BOMB!!!

It was good, although I used shredded Parmesan and it turned crispier than the bread crumbs resulting in an odd textural aspect. Flavours were good together, will use a different style of Parmesan next time.

I kinda changed the recipe up a little for more taste. I used about 1/2 bulb fresh chopped garlic, with about 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil(for sauteing and taste), Then I used about 1c italian breadcrumbs, about 1/2c parm cheese, about 1 tablespoon garlic powder, some salt, pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes. 
*Most of those ingredients were eyeballed* Then about 5 minutes before chicken was done, I added some mozz cheese along with a mexican blend then about 2 minutes later, I added a little of the customized store bought sauce to each then baked for another 3 minutes. 
Served with customized store bought sauce over linguine and fettuccine. Absolutely amazing!

I made as is and the chicken was moist; howeve,r the chicken was so plain tasting, even with the additions to the bread crumbs!  Adding seasoning before dipping would help out tons.

Amazing!  Basicallly followed the recipe exactly, but finely minced the garlic instead of crushing.  The garlic & butter really only coated 3 big breast halves, so would suggest doubling for six.  Used Panko crumbs as one review suggested and romano (which I like better than parmesan).  Cooked about 40 minutes.  Incredibly tasty for something so simple.  Moist, tender and brimming with a good flavor.  It's a keeper!

Fantastic.  I liked one reviewer who suggested to drizzle the remaining oil on top of the chicken.  That made it extra moist.  I also placed a slice of mozzarella on each chicken breast during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Superb!!  My husband and kids devoured it.

This recipe has often made its way to our dinner table. The only thing I add before serving is gravy or white sauce just to add more flavor and moisture to the dish.

I've always tried to get my baked chicken and I this recipe did it with a few minor changes. Instead of olive oil, I used to eggs to save calories and fat in the meal. I added the salt, pepper and basil to the eggs and coated the chicken with this before I coated them in the bread crumb and parmesan mixture. Like others, I used Panko crumbs. I believe this was the key to the chicken's crunchiness! Great recipe overall! Definitely a staple

so good; marinated the chicken in a little olive oil and seasoning before baking it, and added lots of seasoning to the breadcrumbs. also added more garlic than called for; DELICIOUS.

This was fantastic!  We love garlic, so I used 2 cloves for a 3 serving portion, and it wasn't overbearing at all!  Thank you for this recipe, we will be adding it to our "Do it again" list.

This was great! The only change I made was to use Italian seasoning instead of basil, Panko bread crumbs, and I put some mozzarella cheese on the chicken when it was finished baking (just pop it back in the warm oven for a minute to melt). I served it with spaghetti marinara, and the family loved it!

Wonderful, the flavor is great. I poured a jar of Trader Joe's marinara over the chicken atop whole wheat spaghetti. Very satisfying and authentic tasting. Leftovers were stellar!

Simple, easy to whip up and delish!!!!  The only thing I did different was add fresh basil instead of dried.  Delicious flavor!

I really loved this recipe. Used chicken tenders. I coated them with panko crumbs, because that was what I had on hand, and substituted garlic powder for the garlic, because I didn't have any garlic. I couldn't believe how moist they were, I topped them with tomato sauce and grated mozzarella cheese, I will definitely make them again. Thank you for this recipe!

This was a great recipe, but I changed a couple of things myself.  First I infused the garlic and the oil by cooking the garlic in the oil until it was clear, then let it cool.  You can store this in the fridge and also use it for dipping bread.
     Then I used some home made garlic and butter crutons instead of plain crackers.  But I did try it the orginal way first and it was delicious.

I made this twice in one week because it was such a hit with my husband and sons. The first time I served with brown rice and broccoli. The second time I served with whole wheat spaghetti and homemade marinara. Both times it was delicious! This is a new family staple that I'm sure I'll be having to make frequently at the request of my family! I love that it's a baked recipe instead of frying. There's a similar family recipe using panko that my family loves, but it requires frying. This is a perfect alternative!

This chicken was incredible!!! I was looking for a healthy recipe with lots of flavor, this could not have been any better. The only thing I changed was that I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt and garlic powder before dipping in the oil. I used more oil than it called for and baked it for 40 minutes due to larger chicken breasts. I also used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs. Could not have been more moist! I will be making this again and again :)

I made this dish exactly as the recipe was written and it was delicious!  It was extremely tasty and very moist.  I served it sliced, tossed in a spring salad (with sliced mushrooms and avocado added).  The only thing I had to do different was cook it for an extra 10 minutes.  I'm not sure if that was due to the higher altitude of where I live or maybe the thickness of the breasts.  I would recommend this to anyone and will definitely be cooking this again, and again, and again... :)

This was wonderful!  Our chicken breasts were so large we cut them in half - used crushed whole wheat crackers instead of bread crumbs. So Moist!  Will make this again for sure.

I did not think this recipe was great on it's own, although perhaps if it had a sauce it could have shined. I think it would be great as the base to Chicken Parm... just put some marinara and provolone or mozzarella over it in the end and it would be great. As is... it was just breaded chicken to me. It was moist and garlicky, though!

I would have to give this a 2 as I don't like chicken to look white when it's done, the flavor was ok but not great. I will probably not try again as my family of 5 felt the same way. SORRY

Fabulous chicken recipe! The only minor change I made was to sprinkle shredded parmesan on top of the chicken prior to baking versus adding grated parmesan to the bread crumb mix. i also used panko instead regular bread crumbs. Really good recipe and I will for sure make again.

this was really yummy!   i modified it a bit and it turned out really good.   i pounded the chicken breasts a bit thinner to about 3/8 inch since they were almost 1" thick and then marinated overnight in olive oil, about 3 tbsp chopped garlic from a jar, basil and some honey mustard dressing.  i didn't measure out any of the bread crumb mixture but eyeballed it and it looked good and it turned out fantastic and i baked it about 40 minutes.  was super moist and very tasty.  my husband and sons liked it and they had it with honey mustard dressing on top/side.  i served it with garlic buttered pasta and green beans and rolls.  nice change of pace.  thank you - have added this to my recipe box!  :)

This was surprisingly good for such a simple dish.  I appreciated not having to flour and egg the chicken, a process that I find tedious, and this dish offers the added benefit of being baked instead of fried.  I used home-made bread crumbs from half a loaf of stale bread.  I didn't measure the olive oil, but I definitely used more than 2 tablespoons;  I just added it to the dish with the garlic as it got used up.  I baked it at 160°C for 40 minutes.  Perfect.

A great and easy recipe. I substitued the olive oil for 1 tablespoon Roasted Garlic Avocado Oil and 1 tablespoon Tuscan Herb Avocado Oil for a mouthwatering result! Avo oil has a high smoke point, over 500 degrees, so there's no burning or smoking at high temps and you don't lose the infused flavors.

Chicken was dry, and to much basil for our taste.  As others have said, it does make a lot of crumb mixture.  You could def. cut that part down.

Made this for dinner tonight. The kids loved it! Hubby thought it was just pretty good. I loved it because it was easy. I made loaded mashed potatos and green beans for the sides. Yummy :)

I had a recipe that was very similar to this one minus the fresh garlic.  It is excellent!  I also add a 1/4-1/2 tsp. of rosemary sometimes for fun.  The flavors blend beautifully! I usually serve it with salad, whole wheat pasta, and french bread.  Costco sells a butternut squash pasta sauce that I have found to go well with this dish and of course the traditional marnina is always good.

Followed the recipe to the letter, It was great, wouldn't change a thing.  Many people change it ever before they try it.  I am making it again today.

So simple and tastes so good! I didn't have any basil leaves. And I used Italian bread crumbs, which added extra flavor to it. I had to cook it for about 10 minutes longer, but thats because my chicken breasts were huge. Came out perfect! Thanks!

Prepared as directed; family loved it. Not sure how much lower in calories it is than frying but it was quick, easy, and delicious. Much easier than the standard breading and frying we usually do. We will be making it again.

Amazing! Really great! Instead of putting pepper in the breading, i salted and peppered the chicken. I then dipped it in the oil/garlic and breading mixture just like the recipe. I also added onion powder and oregano to the mixture. I piled extra breading below and on top of the chicken. After that, I sprinkled a little more dried basil and oregano as well as garlic powder. I used tinfoil for easy cleanup and tented it in the beginning, but as I got impatient, I folded it down.

Next to fried chicken, this recipe is my favorite! I have eaten 3 meals back to back and loved every bite...I whipped up some spaghetti & opened a jar of sauce & tossed on some fresh parmesan cheese and I am in love!

I've been making this for years, but my recipe uses crushed cornflakes instead of bread crumbs.  I also use 1/3 cup Grated parm & 1/3 cup Shredded.  The freshly grated parm adds more crunchiness.

This was great.   I followed other suggestions and doubled oil & garlic. I think this would also make a good coating for tilapia.

Awesome! I actually didn't have bread crumbs, and am watching my weight so I used Special K cereal instead, and it was absolutely fantastic. My partner said it was the best chicken she had eaten. Thanks!

I really liked this- was hopeful my husband would as well but he was pretty neutral. Regardless, I'll likely make again. The one change I did was to heat the oil and garlic together, so that the garlic was infused into the oil. I also used Panko crumbs. I look forward to enjoying the leftovers for lunch.

I thought it was a little dry, but I tend to have a hard time baking chicken for some reason!? It was a very easy prep. Would be perfect for a on the run night.

Very good and would definitely make again. I was surprised that the recipe was called chicken parm when it didn't inlcude any sauce or cheese. I pounded the breasts thin & followed directions, cook time was a little less. Took it out of the oven, poured warm spaghetti sauce over it and topped w/ mozzerella cheese and put it under the brioler til bubbly.  Served it over spaghetti with a little extra sauce.  Delicious!

Excellent recipe. Simple to prepare. I can honestly say this was the best baked chicken breast I've had. So moist and flavorful. I only made a few minor additions/variations: added some ground herbs to the bread crumbs, used additional garlic in the oil, and used the broiler the last few minutes to brown the dish a bit more.

This was awesome! My son said the best chicken ever.  I used the herb stuffing as the breading and even added my own touch by slicing the chicken open 3/4 of the way and inserting feta cheese inside.  I just held it to when I dipped it in the olive oil and breading.  This was an easy and very tasty meal.  I have fixed it twice in 2 weeks!

This was so good and so easy to make, it came out so moist and tender and the entire family loved it. I did use crushed cornflake crumbs instead of breadcrumbs but that is the only change I made. It had great flavor. I made some angelhair pasta tossed it with pesto and served the chicken with that and steamed cauliflower. Greaat tasting meal

good basic recipe.  I kind of modified it a bit and mashed the oil and garlic together then added the breadcrumbs, and cheese mixture to it along with a little of milk.  That way everything was in one bowl.  I coated the chicken then served it with cheesy potatoes cooked in the oven and brown sugar carrots.

Very juicy and got many compliments.  I, however was not impressed.  Flavor was a bit bland.  I would probably season the chicken a bit before coating.  Maybe with an Italian seasoning.  Definately will try again that way!!

Yummy! I added an extra 2 Tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp miced garlic, and smashed garlic crackers. Turned outso good! I cut the breasts in half and still had more than enough coating for all of them.

I really liked how easy this recipe was.  I added 2 TB of butter to the olive oil for flavor, and crushed pepperidge farm stuffing mix for the bread crumbs.  And I always flatten chicken breasts that are baked so we can cut them with a fork.  I sprinkled the top with mozz cheese about 7 minutes before it was finished cooking.  Served with plain spaghetti noodles and a side of spag sauce for those who wanted it.   Easy, easy, easy.

This is a good recipe for boneless chicken breasts.  I added Italian dressing to the wet mix, and as others suggested, I seasoned with Mrs Dash and topped with shredded mozzarella.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful.

Excellent dish! I had to sub veggie oil for the olive oil because I was out of olive oil, but it still came out great! I did use premade italian seasoning with the breadcrumbs, and then sprinkled some shredded mozzarella after it had finished cooking and put it back in for a minute or two to melt the cheese. My kids inhaled it. Will cook again for sure!

Will make this very easy dish over and over and over again. It was moist and full of flavor. I served over buttered pasta and it was fabulous!

This is similar to what we've been making for years: used 1/2 dijon mustard and 1/2 oil, omit basil, 2/3 c parsley, 3 cloves garlic and freshly-shredded parmesan. If using panko/bread crumbs with no seasoning be sure to add pepper and salt to taste (careful with the salt if using fresh parmesan)  Whirl everything except oil/mustard in food processor starting with garlic/parsley. Can make in bulk and freeze.   Tried and true. Next time I'll try it with some fresh basil!

Very tasty chicken! Easy to prepare- I used the recipe "as is"- no changes. My husband & I think it's good enough to make again.

This was soooo good!  The only changes I made were instead of a clove of garlic, I mixed 1 tsp garlic powder with the oil, and then after putting in the pan, drizzled with an additional 2 TBSP oil and 1 tsp garlic mixture.  Chicken was moist, and my husband went back for a third piece!  Thank you for this great recipe!

Really more like 4.5 stars, but let's not get too picky. I upped the garlic in this and dredged, rather than dipped the chicken in the oil/garlic mixture. I also spiced up the breading mixture with some red pepper flakes and pepper. My BF and son are extremely picky about chicken and both devoured this recipe. An excellent hearty dinner when served with a nice green salad and a side of pasta. Definitely going into the regular rotation.

I thought that this was an excellent recipe.  I cooked in on a cooling rack over a pan.  I also sprayed the coated chicken with olive oil pam.  This makes it turn out nice and crisp.

Great; would have given it 5 stars except it didn't brown or get as crispy as it should;  I baked it on a cooling rack over a pan but at the end had to turn up the heat to get crunch.  However the breast stayed moist and flavorful

I made this recipe last week (and was dumb enough to believe I came up with it on my own). I'm glad to see it in print!  Anyway, after baking the chicken, I topped it with the Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce and then sliced mozzarella on top.  The family loved it so much that I made it the next night too!  There wasn't any for left overs!

I tried this on a whim one night after never having much luck crumbing any kind of meat. It turned out great! I added garlic salt and mixed herbs for more flavour and my boyfriend loved it. Would certainly make this again.

This was okay. It seemed really dry and my son didn't like the way the parmesan became so crunchy. I might experiment with it again one day.

Looking for something quick, easy and tasty, then this is it! The crust kept the chicken completely moist and juicy. I used dry seasoned bread crumbs, so the crust was a little drier and crunchy. Next time may try regular bread crumbs. Definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it.  I used shredded Parmesan, since that's what I keep on hand.  I used 4 large chicken breasts, & it seemed like I had way too many breadcrumbs and not enough olive oil, using the recipe proportions.  There was only enough oil to dip one side of each piece of chicken, but that was enough to provide great flavor.  I used a garlic press instead of mincing the garlic, & that worked very nicely.  Next time I would reduce the breadcrumbs to equal the cheese, when using 4 chicken breasts.  The chicken turned out moist and flavorful.  I appreciate the simplicity of the recipe.  It's a definite keeper.  Thanks!  I will be making this again.

This was really good and so simple to make. I used Italian bread crumbs for more flavor and added some panko for more crunch. I also added some hot sauce to the olive oil and garlic mix. I topped the chicken with the remaining bread crumbs and then put a pat of butter on each breast. The chicken came out so crunchy and tender. I served it with fresh green beans and honey roasted potatoes. A keeper, thank you!

AMAZINGLY delicious! I just made a few additions to make this similar to traditional chicken parmesan: I added an extra 20 minutes to the recipe since my chicken wasn't even close to done at the time stated! I spooned about a cup of garlic pasta sauce over the top of the chicken breasts about 10 min before the chicken was done cooking. And the last 2 minutes or so, I put two pieces of sliced provolone on top and let it melt. I served with spaghetti tossed with pesto and grated parmesan. Its amore!!! I'll definitely make again. OUTSTANDING

This chicken was very simple to make and a big hit with the family. I added a few more garlic cloves and sprinkled Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic into the bread crumb mix- used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs. I cooked it for 45 minutes and as others suggested i flipped the chicken with 15 minutes left. Served with egg noodles, broccoli rabe and a salad. I will make again.

This was a great recipe that got rave reviews at my house. I followed the recipe exactly, but before i started, i let the chicken sit in a marinade of egg, italian dressing, and mayo to tenderize it a bit.

This is WOW level chicken...  something I would be proud to serve to guests.  A bonus is the taste is no reflection on how quick and easy this dish is to prepare!  I personally used roasted garlic instead of minced in the olive oil and Italian bread crumbs with a sprinkle of salt, pepper, and garlic salt, along with the parmesean cheese and basil.  Using bowls worked great, I mixed the dry ingredients well in a plastic bag and only added 1/3 at a time to the bowl to keep them fresh and not clumping as I breaded more chicken.  ABSOLUTELY SUPERB!!!  Need to find a good side dish to go with it, 'plain' spaghetti doesn't quite fit right?  Maybe a dressed up potato recipe...

OMG  this was amazing!!!! I loved it. I followed the the recipe to the tee. Only advice would be to use tons less breadcrumbs. I used 1/2 C, but it was still too much. I would use tons less.

This was great! So easy and still "special" ... if you are looking for something easy and fast to cook try this recipe! ... The only thing I changed was that I used chicken thighs instead... since they are more tender and juicy... everything else I did the same way. Awesome! My husband loved it!

This is a oldie but goodie.  I change mine up a bit by toasting my breadcrumbs before coating the chicken to give them some crunch (sometimes I use toasted sourdough bread crumbs).  Also instead of using oil I coat them with a thin layer of Dijon mustard to give it some extra zip.

My husband said "I would give it a 5, it is the most moist chicken I have ever eaten." Anything this good that is also quick and easy is a definite keeper. I did use Italian bread crumbs instead, but did everything else by the recipe.

It was definitely 5 stars for ease but the taste was good but not great.  I'd make it again though and take some of the advice from other posts like adding more garlic and broiling it for a crispier finish. It was easy to throw together with a different taste when you are in that "chicken rut" that I have been in.  Thanks.

Yum!  Used italian seasoned breadcrumbs but other than that followed the recipe to a T.  Chicken was moist and delicious, topping was crunchy.  Bonus - this recipe is EASY!  I was making parmesan risotto to go with this so my hubby (who doesn't cook) offered to make this.  He had no problems and it came out perfect :)

I am giving this 4 stars mainly because of the extreme ease in preparation.  Dish came out juicy, and looking good...However, I would suggest salting & peppering the chicken directly, rather than just adding pepper to the bread-crumbs. The basil was a nice touch.  Thx, Karen.  PS:  This recipe is similar to other baked chicken recipes on this website -- such as Garlic Cheddar Chicken, which I also reviewed positively.

Every time I've ever made breaded & baked boneless chicken it has been kind of dry and/or boring.  This one was moist, tender and delicious, and even better, quick and easy.  The family loved it!  I melted a little Smart Balance in the baking dish first, and I used Italian flavored bread crumbs.  I also melted some mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken right at the end because my family asked for it.  Thanks Karen.

I made this last night. I didn't add the thyme. I had Italian seasoned bread crumbs and with the black pepper, the chicken didn't need any additional seasoning. I took it out of the oven to check it and added more parmesan on top. It was moist, tender, it was delicious! I ate it with a Buttery Carrot recipe off this site. It was very good!

Just okay.  Nothing is wrong with it, but it's just a bit blah.  Easy to make and it's in the oven and done with 'til the time goes off.  I used 5 leg quarters, and used 3/4 cup of chicken broth in the bottom to keep it from drying out and burning.  Also, I covered with foil for the first 3/4 of the cooking, and cooked it for 55 minutes.  Very moist and juicy.

I have made a version of this recipe for years and it's a family favorite. My version cooks the chicken breasts with butter.

Also it can be made with chicken tenders and cooked in the microwave for a real quick dinner for working people.

Made this for my supper tonight, and it was excellent.  Since I was cooking for one, I used 4 chicken tenderloins (and ate every one of them).  I also substituted cracker crumbs for bread, added a tsp of oregano to the dry mix, and sprinkled about ½ cup of mozarella over them for the last five minutes of baking time.  I'm not normally a big fan of chicken, but this recipe was quick, easy, and very tasty.

I love this recipe. I buy the boneless skinless chicken breast from Costco and halve them lengthwise. I marinate the chicken in fat free Italian dressing. No need for the olive oil that way.

I always make a recipe the first time exactly as written and if it is good I can make any changes that will make it better for me.  The recipe was perfect as written. My only change was to bake the chicken for 1 hour.  The chicken breasts were quite large and 30 minutes was not going to work.  Smaller breasts might have baked in 30 minutes.  I shared the chicken with a friend and she said it was the best baked chicken she has ever had.  I agreed.

Not as crunchy as I had hoped but it was great none-the-less.

I made this as is except that I had only 1/4 cup of bread crumbs left and made up the difference with panko bread crumbs (used 3/4 cup). It was tasty and crispy. I think I'll make it like this next time I want baked chicken cutlets. The flavors meld together nicely without overpowering each other. It will be my new go-to for a healthier option. I agree with another reviewer that mentioned that 2 tablespoons of olive oil for coating will not be enough to cover 6 cutlets. I would say 2 tablespoons of oo will cover approximately 3 chicken breasts. Also, I might use a ratio of 2 garlic cloves to 2 tablespoons of oo only because my family likes garlic. Do not pass up this recipe...it's worth it!!!

This was one of the best chicken recipes I have made. I added a pat of butter to the top of each piece and used Italian bread crumbs. I did season chicken with salt and pepper which is not mentioned in recipe. It was full of flavor and my peeps ate it up.

A little bland for me by I really liked the idea of using garlic in the oil prior to dredging in crumb mixture. I also had to bake for 45 minutes to ensure the chicken was fully cooked. Still came out very tender and juicy! Will add more seasonings next time!

my family liked it so much I had to make it twice in one week. Absolutely delicious. I used panko bread crumbs and  I did add one thing, I squirted some olive oil on top of the breaded chicken before baking, to make it crispy.

The cons: Made exactly as the recipe called the chicken came out soggy, which I kind of expected. The olive oil mixture will not be enough, double it.

The pros: despite the chicken having that typical soggy-baked texture it was delicious. 

Tips: pan sear the chicken before bakingnto crisp it up. I would give it 5 stars prepared this way. I served it with penne and vodka sauce and it paired well. EDIT: my wife says its perfect the way it is so I am increasing it from three stars to 4

Quick and Easy.  The chicken was moist and yummy.  My family loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I will add a little more garlic for more flavor.

Loved this recipe! I ended up needing more olive oil and garlic but other than that I made exactly as is to see how it came out and it was wonderful! I have to agree with the other lady on writing a review. Ratings are for this recipe, not the recipe that you created off of this recipe. If you add stuff, create your own recipe on here with those additions!

I always use a little more garlic for this. It is super easy, not too much prep time. I like that it doesn't call for an egg wash as I am allergic. This is a go-to school night recipe.

Delicious, moist and easy to make. The only thing I adjusted was cooking time to 40 minutes. It was a hit and I'll be making it again.

An easy recipe, but as other reviewers have noted there isn't enough of the oil and garlic mixture to coat all 6 chicken breasts.  I made the recipe as-is but only used two chicken breasts, I might have been able to coat a third but wouldn't have been able to do four.  (There was plenty of the bread crumb mixture, though.)

The flavor is quite mild, I'll probably tweak the seasonings a bit next time.

Very tasty! I used Italian style Panko breadcrumbs.  I preheated the oven to 425 degrees and cooked the breasts for around 50 minutes. I doubled the garlic and used olive oil for one set of breasts and melted Smart Balance for another - both versions were good.

I went by the recipe and didn't change anything and gave it to my dad who loved it, but I feel like it could be better. It has a good flavor but seems to be missing something. I'd suggest having a berry/fruit sauce on the side to add a little more flavor.

I used Panko bread crumbs, and cut the chicken into strips. To get the golden brown crispiness I was looking for I placed under broiler and then flipped the pieces to get the other side golden.

This is my second time making the recipe and it has come out perfectly both times. I cut my chicken breasts pretty thinly so they cook faster. I use Progresso Italian breadcrumbs. I flipped the breasts over halfway through and poured remaining breadcrumb mixture on the backside

Pros-It was really easy to make and the ingredients list was quite short.


Cons-Not very flavorful. You need to season it a bit more or use plenty of cheese. 


Overall I'll be cooking this again but will use a bit more cheese and seasoning. My thanks to the author of the recipe. You made it simple enough for a novice cook like me to try and I actually felt pretty good with the results.

Oh my god this was so good. I made it last night, and I only changed a few things - one, I used panko bread crumbs as recommended. DO THIS, it gives it a wonderful crunch. Two- I added a teaspoon of oregano to the cheese/breadcrumb mix. Three, at the end of thirty minutes it didn't seem quite done (I also forgot to set a timer in the beginning) so I cranked the heat to broil for five minutes and it lightly toasted the breadcrumbs and gave it a lovely crust. Perfect!

Great recipe!!

I only had panko on hand, so I used that. Mixed in a bit of garlic powder, hot and regular paprika and fresh basil.
I also sprinkled salt and pepper on both sides of the chicken instead of adding it to the panko crumbs. 

Turned out amazingly delicious!!

I have made this more than once, and my husband and adult children love it!  I did change in that I use italian bread crumbs instead of using basil and black pepper. I have also substituted Italian Cheese shreds (mix of mozarella, provolone and parmesan)which reduces cost minimally but returns awesome flavor. This reheats well.  Last time I used boneless skinless thighs as well as breasts and the results were outstanding.  No waste if you make extra because it reheats well.  My hubby said make this again!!

This was great.  I agree with other viewers that the quantities are skewed.  I used 1/2 c bread crumbs and 1/3 c of parm cheese and still had plenty left over.  I skipped the basil as we didn't have any and the pepper as my husband doesn't like it.  I did use seasoned bread crumbs and with the garlic, I thought this was a nice amount of seasoning.  Very simple recipe and my 4 year old loved it which makes it AMAZING!!!

Since the wife is on a gluten free diet, the only thing I changed was the bread crumbs to quinoa flour. Otherwise, it was great.

I made this recipe twice while I was visiting my grandsons.  Serving something that all three little ones like is sometimes challenging. They all liked it, I even got a thumbs up! I don't know how the chicken is as leftovers because it was all eaten both times. The only substitutions I made were using chicken tenderloins instead of breasts & frozen crushed garlic cubes in stead of fresh, minced garlic. They  were still moist & flavorful.

This recipe is great. Instead coating the chicken in oil and garlic, I marinated the chicken in Italian salad dressing and then coated it in Italian breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese. It's a lot easier and taste great!

We tried this and liked it.  However, we added Worcestershire sauce instead of apple cider vinegar, plus Woeber's sweet and spicy mustard to the wet mix.  It added lots of flavor.

Fast, easy, and delicious! I modified the recipe slightly by adding a couple of shakes of garlic salt to the bread crumb mixture, and drizzled melted butter on the breaded chicken before baking. Great recipe!

This is a wonderful, flavorful, juicy chicken recipe.  Added just a few extra spices, celery salt and garlic pepper. Prepared the pan with a basil infused olive oil. So glad I made extra for leftovers.

Have tried this recipe twice...once with halved chicken breasts and once with thighs...it is juicy and tender and oh so good!.  Making a little extra bread crumb mixture to add to top is a plus.  It takes less than 10 minutes to prepare, another plus.

It was OK.  I think it falls just short of making rotation.  Certainly easy, but far too crumb-y.  Just kind of dry and gritty instead of a nice crust.

The whole family loved this. We made it with just two large chicken breasts in a square glass pan and it took about 45 minutes, instead of 30. But it was delicious.

Loved it. I cooked the chicken in an oven bag at 300 for an hour to keep it tender and juicy. Great easy recipe. Will
Make again.

Made this tonight for supper and it was pretty good.  I doubled the amount of oil and garlic as the chicken breasts were pretty big.  I added some salt to the breadcrumb mixture as well.

I actually used Kellogg's corn flakes crumbs and I must say I loved the crunchy texture. The mixture was very good and the chicken was juicy and tender, but I had to bake it for about 45 mins. I made fresh mashed potatoes and corn to go with it and the wifey really enjoyed it. Forgot to take a pic. Soo GOOD!

Delicious and easy to prepare. 
I really didn't think I  would like this as much as I did, but I'm glad you gave us this yummy recipe. Thank you! I had it along with my favorite Paula Deen honey mustard recipe I found online. This is definitely a keeper recipe. Thanks again!

I made this recipe for dinner the other night and my husband and I both LOVED it.  It's so good.  I think I had a little too many breadcrumbs on top of the chicken because I didn't actually measure the ingredients (I just eyeballed it), so I had to cook mine a little longer to get the topping crispy.  Once it was done, it was moist, flavorful and delicious.  I'll be making this again very soon.

Made this last night and it was fabulous!  I threw together some marinara sauce with canned crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, bay leaf and garlic and onion powders  - served that over noodles as a side dish.  This is my new "go-to" for a quick yummy dinner! Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good! Followed the directions. The garlic clove bits didn't really stick to the chicken at all, so I might try garlic powder or salt next time. Also, the Parmesan cheese we used (just pre-shredded stuff in a plastic bottle) hardened a little bit after the baking, so we got a few bites that were quite crunchy from the cheese. Also, we used crushed up Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, because we can never find bread crumbs in the store. Still delicious with the minor change! But overall, it was a really good recipe, great tasting! Highly recommend it! (EDIT: Okay, I made it again using 1 tsp garlic salt in the dry mixture instead of garlic clove w/ olive oil. It turned out much better. Recommend it if you find the garlic is not sticking to your chicken!)

I have made this plate for my husband for dinner and we absolutely loved it. Very flavorful and filling. I added veggies and steamed rice as sides.

This recipe called for 6 chickens, but I only had 3 so I decided to split all the ingredients by 2. By the time I was done reading the chicken I still had over half of the seasonings left over. When I ate the chicken they had no flavor and didn't seem cooked all the way through, despite cooking them for 40 minutes. Any help?

Was ok, not to rave about or get 4/5stars. Needed near 1hr @170 in fan oven. I'd added some chilli flakes cumin & coriander to mix also as like a bit of kick in food. If not would have been bland. Finished grilling for a few minutes also to give bit colour.

It was good, Felt it went a little heavy on the bread crumbs and I added more oil and garlic to the mix. Also used a garlic olive oil too.

It's a really great recipe. Tried it today and everyone loved it! Though I will halve the recipe next time. Turns out I had to throw away a whole bunch of the Bread crumb mix as I had already dipped the chicken in it and had waayyyyy too much left over. 10/10 WILL MAKE AGAIN!

Tried this last night and turned out great! I did use whole non split chicken breast so it took closer to 45-50 minutes to bake until internal temperature got to 165 but I think that helped get the outer coating more crisp anyway. I served it over spaghetti with Emeril's jar of spaghetti sauce and it was great! I do plan to prepare it again in the future.

I made this recipe pretty much as-is except for adding a few shakes of red pepper to the breading.  I thought this was delicious for now easy it is to make.  As another reviewer mentioned, panko breadcrumbs are the way to go if you can swing it.  I give it 4 stars though as I think the chicken could use a little flour prior to dipping/breading as some of the coating came away when plating.  Thanks for sharing this!

It was so good! The chicken was very moist! It was a hit with the hubby and kids. Will be making again. I loved reading the reviews and tweaked it a little by what others did. I used more garlic cuz I love it and seasoned my chicken with adobo for more flavor. Made angel hair pasta and pasta sauce with garlic bread. ??

Made this and it was fantastic. Instead of dipping the chicken in oil and garlic, I added two beaten eggs to the mixture so it would stick better. I also added Lemon pepper and herb seasoning to my bread crumb batter. Turned out well.

This was very good and my girls who are somewhat picky really enjoyed it. I tweaked this recipe a bit by using half breadcrumbs and half Panko breadcrumbs for extra crunchiness.  I also used dried oregano instead of basil leaves and used coarse ground pepper to taste. I think adding fresh grated Parmesan adds more flavor as well.  Overall this recipe was easy  and delicious to make. I would definitely make it again.

Super easy, quick and tasty! The oil moistened the chicken and the cheese in the breading  really gave it a richer overall flavor.

I'll start by saying I'm a horrible cook, so I tried this recipe because it seemed very simple.  I followed the instructions EXACTLY and at 30 minutes my chicken was still almost completely raw inside, and brown on the outside.  OH, how I wish this didn't ALWAYS happen to me.  I'm so tired of wasting food.

As a 14 year old cooking for the first time, this recipe was VERY helpful.  The chicken tastes fantastic.  I only encountered two problems.  1) I ran out of the olive oil, garlic mix half-way through.  2) the bread crumb mixture has a hard time sticking.  Other than that, it's a fantastic recipe/tutorial and with a few modifications, it's practically cook off ready. :)

I made this chicken dish last night and my husband ate 3 pieces and gave it a 10 out of 10.  He put the copy of this recipe straight into my recipe folder and said it must be made again.
I did do just a little adjustments.  Didn't seem to have any basil in my cupboard so I substituted with a little dill weed, italian seasoning and a little salt with the bread crumb mixture.  Will be making this again for sure.

No changes needed, moist & tender and ready for your favorite sauce or salad dressing. There is a baked chicken nugget recipe that is very similar and equally good. The idea is a chicken that will please little ones who want to put ketchup or ranch dressing on and big one who like to use hot wing or bbq sauce.  It is a wonderful and versatile chicken. 

I did actually use "seasoned" chicken breasts from the deli counter but since I loathe people who give a good review only after changing the entire recipe, I only mention it in case, like me, it happens to be what you have on hand.

Soooo moist and tender. Be sure to pound to flatten in a freezer baggie with oil and garlic and seasonings. My chicken breasts were so big, we could only eat half. Could change up the seasoning for variety. I used a meat thermometer to check for doneness (180°) (Anyone have a suggestion for how to make the bottom crispy? )

Wow that was really good! Turned out great just the way it's written aside from what people say in their reviews. Added a little salt to the breading but they were delish!BTW if you don't have bread crumbs on hand either set your bread out to let it get stale or toast it and then crumble,works just as well....

I should have read the reviews before making this.  I found that there was far too much breadcrumb mixture and that it was pretty dry.  I will make this again but add more cheese (I used fresh parm and I think that I will need to double the amount that was specified) and see how it goes from there.  In my perspective a little tweaking will make this good.

This recipe was tasty, as long as you add your own flavor since not everyone likes the same thing. I too thought the breadcrumbs left over was waaaaaaaaayy too much, even for 6 pieces of chicken, I had to scrape some off before serving to my kids. So here's what I did for the oil and garlic mix: for every 3 pieces, I used 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 clove (equaling 4 tablespoons of oil and 2 cloves of garlic), it was enough then. I also added garlic powder, savory seasoning and paprika for a little more flavor. I gave this 5 stars because after you put your own spin on it, it will be a hit, as it was with my picky 4 and 2 yr old.

Wow, this was good!  I only made the recipe for two breasts and I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used crushed corn flakes and it was delicious!  Definitely will make this one again!

Delicious! ... but with a few changes from reviews I read, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. 
I put the garlic in the oil as recipe states, but also added 2 more cloves into the breading mix along with a little salt. (we love garlic!)
I also turned the temp up a bit after realizing it just wasn't going to brown/crisp like I wanted it to on the outside before the inside dried out. 
I served this with a small side of spaghetti sauce for dipping. I am looking forward to using this recipe as a base for chicken Parmesan...yum!

I was worried it would be a bland recipe but the fresh garlic really makes it very flavorful since it isn't cooked before adding it to the breading

The only alteration I made was in using egg whites instead of oil.  The breading stuck to the chicken fairly well, and turned out crispy.  Not sure how using oil would change the final product.

I have used this recipe for both chicken and pork chops.  It was delicious with both.  I baked the pork chops for 45 minutes, which was perfect for 1/2 inch chops.  I will definitely make both of these recipes again!

Very flavorful recipe, all in my family loved it.  I did double the garlic and added salt and pepper to coat the chicken.  I also added 1/3 cup panko to 1/3 cup Italian bread crumbs.  Then I added low moisture mozzarella to the Parmesan cheese.  I cooked as instructed and it came out great!

It was a tasty chicken breast, but nothing to wave flags over. I made it as the recipe states. If I make it again, I'll season the breast (S&P) before I dip it in the olive oil and garlic and I will add, probably, some Italian Seasoning and a bit of white pepper to the bread crumbs and probably some dried parsley. Or maybe start with Italian bread crumbs. I will also give the coated breasts a fine mist of olive oil spray oil. Or coat my hands with olive oil and just pat them a bit.

I think this is really good but, a tad dry(could just be my preference since I tend to find chicken dry anyways). the family loves it and is good when you have extra chicken breasts. We usually double or triple the garlic, use panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs and omit the basil. I'm 11 and i have no problems making this! :-) thanks!
UPDATE: I tried using mayo instead of oil  and it makes the chicken much moister.

The best review for this chicken is that it was totally approved by the 3 yr. old grandchild! Personally, I would prefer the chicken coated in butter rather than olive oil. I did use Italian style breadcrumbs and lightly salted the chicken which probably helped give it more flavor.

I tried and it was easy, breezy delish. But only because I adjusted based on some of the other suggestions. I love it that better cooks than me put their own spin on it. Really comes in handy when I don't have all the ingredients and am looking for an easy substitute too.

Delicious!  My husband said this is the best way to do chicken (and we have it a lot of different ways!). I used panko breadcrumbs as that's all I use.  I also used two cloves of garlic (we love garlic) and sprinkled it all with some garlic powder.  It was moist, tender and delicious.

Excellent, healthy recipe for breaded chicken!!  Have made several times and everyone loves it.  I also have made it using gluten free bread crumbs and that works well too.  As with most recipes, I throw ingredients together to taste and don't exactly follow precise directions - hard to go wrong with garlic, parmesan and olive oil!  The only thing I would say it to make more than you think you'll need because people will want seconds!

The recipe mentioned that the chicken should be baked in the oven for thirty minutes. My biggest concern was the chicken becoming too dry while baking in the oven. I cooked the chicken in a skillet with some olive oil and garlic, for about fifteen to twenty minutes, and the chicken was moist. Also, I substituted Italian bread crumbs because it had more flavor in it. I served the chicken with Caesar's salad, and I was able to serve dinner within half an hour. I will continue to keep making this recipe, but I will cook the chicken over the stove than to bake it. :-)

Great recipe.  I used venison instead of chicken and I did a few modifications.  After the bread crumbs were nice and brown, I topped each cutlet with mozzarella cheese and let it melt.  Right before serving I spooned spaghetti gravy over the cutlets. Excellent!

This is a staple meal in our family! Delicious! I tend to cut the chicken breast into strips so it takes less time to cook in the oven. We usually serve Parmesan Chicken with salad or broccoli.

This was very good.  I didn't make HUGE adjustments, just very small ones, using the same ingredients.  I toasted 3 slices of white bread for the bread crumbs and processed in the food processor with the cheese, basil, pepper.  I used 4 or so cloves of garlic instead of 1...we really like garlic. I also followed a suggestion in the comments to allow the garlic to soak in the oil to get the flavor going.  I prepared the oil, then peeled and chopped potatoes for mash potatoes, and trimmed the chicken while the garlic oil was "brewing", about 15 minutes or so.  I am not sure what a difference that made to the flavor, but what can it hurt right?

Fantastic Recipe but I changed a few things to make it perfect!! Instead of chicken I used Veal! Yum.  Use Lard instead of olive oil because it gives it that Spanish tamale kick.  Deef fried 1st before baking, so you can stuff the veal with Mayo (I used miracle whip though).  Dry bread crumbs seemed lame so I used Spicy Italalian dried crumbs, portabella mushrooms, goat cheese and a touch of Dr Pepper in the stuffing.  Oh and some Bruschetta (optional) Wrapped these fried, stuffed, chicken rolls in kale (seaweed) topped with about 1 cup romano/mozzarella after dipping in egg white and bake.  Its that easy.  Family loved it, dogs too!

All of my picky eaters loved these. I followed the advice of others and put the chicken in a bag with 4 tbsp oil, 2 cloves of garlic, salt and pepper; then dipped in the breadcrumb (seasoned) and Parmesan mixture. I also sprayed with cooking spray before cooking to keep crispy.

I add a touch of mustard to the butter and garlic. I also drizzle this over the chicken, if there is any leftover after the whole preparation. Sometimes it takes longer than 30 min. The whole house smells good while this is cooking.

I tried something similar. I used Panko bread crumbs and sliced chicken breasts lengthwise. Flattened and dipped in olive oil then bread crumbs. Cooked at 400 for about 20min (convect works the best)
Served on kaiser roll with lettuce tomatoe and onion. Best chicken sandwich ever!!

great recipe.  Dipping in olive oil and then bread crumbs is easier than in egg.  Baking makes the chicken real tender too.

Really good! I gave the recipe a 4 because it doesn't mention seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper before using the breading. You really need to season first for best flavor. The second time I made this, I used Italian seasoning instead of just basil and I like it even better.

This recipe was awesome! The only changes I made was to the type of bread crumbs: I used Stoffer's Stove Top stuffing (Chicken) and using a rolling pin crushed the amount that i needed for the breading. I also added about a 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to the breading mixture (either Sharp Cheddar, three cheese mix, or Mozzarella....all three types of cheese work great so take your pick.) 
I did notice that if you add the extra ingredient you'll have to decrease the amount of bread crumbs from 1 cup to about 1/2 to 3/4 cup depending on the size of the chicken breasts.

Wonderful tender and moist. I used Panko rather than bread crumbs and the  recipe was very moist with a light beautiful crunchy coating. Will definitely make this again! I paired it with Basmati rice and oven baked asparagus with olive oil, garlic and  seasonings with Romano cheese sprinkled before baking, wonderful!

This is a very kid friendly dish. I put more garlic in the oil though, probably a little more than 2 cloves. It goes well with a side of pasta so that the meal has a little more flavor, but with the added garlic it was tasty. I saw it featured and decided to make it the same night. It made the house smell wonderful. I will definitely make this again.

I made this last night and my whole family absolutely loved it!  My husband said that it was some of the best chicken he has ever had.  They all said that they thought dinner had come straight from a restaurant.  I made the chicken with extra garlic in the olive oil and some season salt other wise I followed the recipe exactly.  I served it with some penne and roasted garlic cream sauce.  My husband and kids say this is a keeper!!

I actually like this recipe. It was very simple, and very easy to make. I served it with some fettucini a salad and breadsticks, and it was phenominal. I dont think you can go wrong with this recipe. I think its so great how everyone has the bravery to change it a little to make it there own. Happy cooking!

This recipe was so DELICIOUS!  I made it for my family and served it with pasta and salad.  It was so good I made the exact same thing the next day.  Everything was eaten!  I used more garlic in the olive oil and halved the bread crumbs.  I dumped the remaining crumbs and olive oil over the chicken before baking.  The chicken breast turned out wonderfully tender and juicy.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Made this for dinner tonight, I added more garlic than called for and seasoned the chicken w/ Salt & Pepper. I also used Italian Seasoning.
It's going to be one of my regulars for sure :)

Sounded promising, but I found the chicken to be really dry.  Perhaps it needs some kind of oil or sauce to change up the texture...

This was okay. I think with some alterations it could be good. It was a bit dry. Maybe needed a dipping sauce? The chicken was so tender that you could cut it with your fork.

wow, very easy recipe that turned out great. i used chicken tenderloins and baked for 25 mins, turning over half way through. because i used tenderloins i had some extra breading and used asparagus for the rest. i did use a little extra garlic and added onion powder and oregano in the breading mix. chicken was very tender and went well with the breaded asparagus and some garlic/olive oil noodles. yummm, nice recipe as is and to play with :)

I love this recipe! My whole family liked it, but I suggest cooking the chicken on both sides because it is mushy on the bottom if you do not.

This recipe was good, but it took about 45 min in my oven at 350F to reach an internal temp of 165. Also, she instructs to top the chicken with any remaining crumbs, but this resulted in a lot of dry crumbs in our mouths. Since there is no egg to create a coating, the extra crumbs don't really combine into the crust. Only the crumbs closest to the oil coating stick. So I won't be adding the additional crumbs on top next time. Otherwise, a tasty and very moist baked chicken recipe overall. Next time I'll add some oregano and salt for additional flavor and some dried parsley for additional color. My husband liked it enough as is for a thumbs up. Thanks, Karen!

the taste was incredibly delicious. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs - I love dark meat and the texture much better because it is more juicy and tender. I used panko breadcrumbs for a better crunch and I omitted the clove of garlic and just lightly sprinkled some s&p and garlic powder onto the chicken itself before dipping in oil. I also omitted the basil - just for personal preference. However, next time I will dip the chicken in a whisked egg mixture instead of the oil - I found that dipping them in olive oil did not make the breadcrumbs stick at all.

This chicken was great! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, just kind of borrowed the general idea. I used two cloves of garlic (we love garlic at my house). I also just kind of estimated the ratios of seasoned bread crumbs to the shaky Parmesan cheese. I cooked at 350 degrees for a little longer than recommended (they still looked pink to me). and MAN were they good! I usually use egg and milk to bread my chicken, and I'm sure olive oil is less healthy but it was so much crispier on the breading. Also, if you use 2 cloves, don't be scared by the overpowering scent of garlic that will be in your kitchen while these are cooking... the taste isn't overpowering at all, it's just right! I highly recommend this for an easy week night dinner idea.

I tried making this according to the recipe but I should have known better.  Next time I will drizzle on more olive oil after breading the chicken for a crunchier crust.  I'll also lower the temperature and broil them at the end for a darker finish.  The taste was excellent, 4 stars for a weak presentation.

Pretty juicy.   I began with chicken breasts bone in, skin on-so cut off pieces of chicken (like chicken tenders).  I stuck it in a ziplock with 2 crushed garlic cloves and 4 TBL olive oil.  Threw in some cayenne, white pepper, and garlic salt.  Marinated for about 9 hours.  Then, when I prepared to bake it- preheated oven to 350, greased the dish, and crushed some colby cheez-its (9) with the  1/2 cup italian bread crumbs, 1/3 cup jack cheese, and  1/3 mexican blend cheese.  Added  some basil, mixed it- dipped the chicken-and stuck it in the oven :)  ENJOY!!!

I can't give this a proper review b/c I didn't have real Parmesan cheese (I used store bought ground up Parmesan) & I used minced garlic as opposed to a fresh garlic clove.  The chicken was still good with the alternatives though.

I love this chicken! I am a points+ weight watcher and lighten it up by substituting the olive oil and crushed garlic infusion for 1/4 cup egg beaters mixed with 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder. The rest is the same. This switch saves 1 point per serving. Excellent!

So yummy! Did as others suggested and added chipotle peppers to 'wet' ingredients and doubled the amount of olive oil and garlic. I also put the chicken breasts in a ziploc bag and marinated them in the olive oil/garlic mixture before dipping them in the bread crumbs. So yummy and will definitely be making this again and again! :-) It too about an hour to cook.

excellent!! Definitely go with fresh basil, the dry stuff has no flavor. I used crushed croutons instead of the bread crumbs. Also, I did season the chicken with garlic salt and onion powder. Over all a very good chicken recipe!!

Used Panko crumbs for a crispier coating. A little light on the flavor. I think next time I will try thighs for a juicer meat

Baked Garlic Parmesan Chicken Haiku: "So easy to make. And the taste was excellent. But too many crumbs." I hated having to toss so much extra of the crumb mixture, but there was just alot leftover, even after following the recipe saying to top the chicken w/ what remained. But otherwise, the resulting chicken was moist and wonderfully seasoned, although it just occured to me that I used Italian Seasoned breadcrumbs, as that's all I had available. Oh and to avoid mushy chicken, I baked it on a greased rack over a pan to catch anything, flipping half-way thru. Got that tip from another baked chicken from AR.

made this for my 'rents' in law and extended family...was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone. increased the garlic due to personal preference, and that was the only change. my husband was a big fan too....made it a second time at his request. this will become a regular recipe for use in our home.

So good! Needed a little salt. Cut breadcrumb mixture in half, and you'll still probably have too much. But all in all, an easy and delicious dish.

This recipie was fantastic, except instead of the oil I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing and put it in the bread crumbs straight from there.  It was delightful, in flavor.  I also added oregano, garlic, and some shredded Romano, Parmesan mix to the bread crumbs.

Made this tonight for supper and it was fantastic, pleasing even the picky eaters :) My only adjustments were to use the pre-seasoned Italian chicken breasts (from Walmart) and then I doubled the breading, using Panko crumbs and adding a tsp. of oregano in addition to the basil as well as 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese. I had to increase my baking time by about 15 minutes just because the chicken breasts were quite large but the chicken was very moist, not dried out at all. I will definitely be making this again!

This was so easy to make and tasted so yummy! I served it along side fresh green beans and rice.  Instead of normal bread crumbs, I used "Italian style bread crumbs" and mine took 40 min to bake.  After thirty minutes I topped it with some mozzerella cheese and after 40 minutes..the chicken was so tender and juicy and had great flavor!

Just got done eating this. Recipe is rather bland. I did use Panko crumbs instead of ordinary bread crumbs because I didn't have any on hand. I made 6 breasts and you will need an extra teaspoon or so of olive oil to fully coat. I thought they tasted a little too basily for me. Its a good base recipe but I will definitely be adding some more herbs or something to this the next time I make it. My kids did enjoy this though.

This was a nice, mild flavored chicken dish that was easy to prepare.  I used freshly grated parmesan cheese which attained the perfect amount, not overpowering nor being insignificant in the dish.  For our specific tastes, I would add a little more jazz the next time.

It was great! I made this following the suggestions to use Panko breadcrumbs and softer parmesan and it was great! Very juicy AND crispy. I made one extra breast to have 8 splits total and used all the prep crumbs no problem. I served kicked up tomoato sauce on the side for one person in my group who HAD to have it with sauce.

I made this tonight and it was very delicious.  The chicken was moist and very tender.  Instead of the grated Parmesan cheese I used a shredded 3 Italian cheese made up of Parmesan, Asiago, and Romano. I took the advice of a few others and drizzled some olive oil over each chicken breast, topped it with some more of the dry mixture, and then sprinkled on a small amount of garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  Definitely will make again.

Per other reviews:  Used panko, two extra minced garlic cloves in the oil, added dry Italian seasoning, drizzled remaining oil & crumb mixture over top when done.  Really good for baked & not fried!  Served with store-bought marinara sauce & a side of steamed broccoli.

This was delicious. I used Italian panko in place of the bread crumbs and added some italian seasoning to the mixture. I found the proportions to be perfect. Nothing was wasted.

Very good, I used a little extra garlic (3 cloves instead of 1, could probably go halfway and just do 2). It was definitely a good meal, and not too much more work than your typical chicken cutlets! 

I also served it with a little lemon juice which really brightened it up and brought another dimension to the flavors.

Used panko bread crumbs, but otherwise followed recipe as written. Turned out very crispy on the outside, moist and tasty on the inside.

When i made this i was out of garlic so i didn't add that. To give the chicken more flavor i added some oregano and parsley and instead of black pepper i used lemon pepper it turned out really good!

This is by far the best chicken recipe that I have tried. People in my house who would usually barely finish one serving of chicken went up for seconds!! I am so impressed with this recipe. Thank you so much for posting it.

Made this last night!!!! Loved it!!!!!!! Best way to make chicken! i added some alfredo sauce to the left overs today and it was good (our chicken was a little dry so i needed something) but I think i like it better without. It was so easy to make and I loved it!

This was delicious!! I had 10 half chicken breasts, lots of hungry people! The only thing I did was add Emerils chicken rub to the oil and garlic and did 2 garlic cloves.  Had  to use a little more oil obviously, and added a tbsp. of seasoned salt and a tsp. of Italian seasoning to the Italian bread crumb mixture. Which I put in a freezer bag and used like shake and bake. I sprinkled a little left over crumb mixture not all just enough to give it a little more crust.  This got terrific reviews from everybody and there was only one little piece left over that my husband hid in the fridge for his lunch.  Tender and juicy and will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

SOOOO good!  The only changes that I made was to spray PAM to the top of the chicken before baking and I used chicken strips instead of whole breasts.  My pickiest eater ate 4 chicken fingers cooked this way!

It was good but not great. I felt like it could have had a little more flavor. I will make it again but add so me of my own seasonings.

I thought this chicken was excellent - it was uber-simple and I was surprised at how moist it stayed. My husband loved it and my two young children enjoyed it as well. I made three very large chicken breasts; the wet ingredients were just enough (would need to increase for more breasts) and I knew I would end up with lots of dry ingredients (but wanted to make sure I had enough). Will definitely be on rotation in our household - thanks for sharing!

This chicken was amazing!  I made this for my friends and family to have on Easter and everyone loved it!  My only comment is that I found the breading was a little too much--next time I'll skip the last step of sprinkling the remaining breading over the top of the chicken.

This is a really easy and quick baked chicken recipe - I've made it twice now and received compliments both times. My only suggestion would be to be sure to marinate the chicken for 30 minutes at least so that its more tender.

Excellent! Super easy too. I used a couple pieces of toast for the bread crumbs & divided it in half. 1 half I added about a tsp of seasoned salt & the other half I added a tsp of cajun seasoned salt. The cajun was the big winner. I used the shredded parmesan cheese, but  diced it up a bit smaller (not powdered). It will be a regular at our table for sure!

This recipe is simple but perfect. I serve these as is to the kids and add a mushroom wine sauce to the adults. I took a reviewers advice and cooked the chicken on a drying rack for 15 minutes per side and the chicken was so perfect, crunchy, and not a touch of sogginess that I'll never cook breaded chicken any other way again.

We love this recipe! I did use a few of the suggested alterations. I had to use more olive oil (4 Tbsp) and garlic (2 cloves), but had a lot of the bread crumb mixture left over.

WONDERFUL!!  I followed the recipe exactly but also added spaghetti sauce and provolone cheese (we were out of mozarella) like one review sugggested during the last 5 minutes.  It was so QUICK AND EASY and turned out so good!  My husband and 5-year-old son really enjoyed it!  Thank you so much!!

"That amazingly, delicious, wonderful chicken!" This was the exclamation heard when my older brother opened up the fridge and found leftovers of this chicken from the night before. It truly was delicious! The flavors mix perfectly and this recipe is definitely going into my book as a favorite! Thank you Karen!
On a side-note: I did end up using more garlic and oil than the original recipe called for... there just wasn't enough to coat all of the chicken.

Chicken must be the most unexciting food in this world. BUT...I have found Baked Garlic Parm. Chicken is the "cure".  So moist, delicious, tender yummy chicken!  Thanks for posting! Almost forgot, I used Seasoned Panko (4C Bread Crimbs) for even more crunch. OMG!

Really liked this except the chicken itself was a little bland,loved the breading though,I would reccomend just a little seasoning on the chicken,like salt or adabo.

Good basic recipe that is easy to adapt with additional seasoning!  I made a big batch and used the leftovers for sandwiches and a salad.

This recipe just seemed to be lacking something...it was ok but it wasn't great. Definitely needed salt and possibly more garlic. Will make it again but will have to tweak the recipe to get a more desirable result.

I made this recipe tonight and thought it was pretty delish considering the simple ingredients involved! It was quick, extremely easy and tasted surprisingly moist for baked chicken.  I used organic chicken breasts, more garlic and less bread crumbs.  Also had to bake a little longer- about 45 minutes for thicker chicken breasts.  Overall very good, I will make it again. :)

I received this recipe through an e-mail via allrecipes and was intrigued.  Was impressed by the rating/number of reviews and how easy the recipe looked.  I was super tired today and thought this would be a good day to try it out.  It was sooo easy to make...just had to add more olive oil/garlic (I used Trader Joe's jar of crushed garlic...delish & ooooh soooo convenient!) and bread crumb/Parm. cheese mixture which was fine.  

This is just simply the best!  Sooo easy, fun, & fast to make and comes out sooo moist and delicious.  Thank you for this keeper of a recipe!!!

Wow this was GREAT!  And the recipe is going into "the rotation".  I love a recipe that is quick, easy & made with items that I normally have on hand.  I used garlic powder in the EVOO instead of minced and used Italian Bread Crumbs and bonless skinless chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand.  It turned out wonderfull!

Excellent. I am always looking for good, but easy baked chicken recipes. This beats many I have found. The first time I just eyeballed the amount of parmesan cheese and it was just a tad too much. The next time I followed the recipe exactly and it was soooo much better. This is a keeper.
 Thanks for the post.

This was a great meal - I steamed and then fried broccoli with same ingredients, and put it all together with cheesy rice-a-roni. Very easy, fast. It could use more "oomph" in terms of spiciness, so next time I will experiment a bit.

I made this last night and I wish I had listened to all the other reviews and cut down on the bread crumbs. It was VERY tasty though!  1 cup is way too much for sure.  The chicken was moist and cut with a fork.  I did use a bit more garlic like someone suggested..overall, it's a keeper and I will make it again for sure!

Wonderful, flavorful, moist chicken.  I prepared this for dinner, and then my family didn't end up being home for dinner that night, so I put it in the fridge to eat the next night.  It was still delicious.  Served with roasted potatoes, this is a great, simple weeknight meal.  Thanks!

I absolutely LOVED this! So did the kids! The chicken tasted just like Olive Garden's Chicken Parm... minus the fried, processed part! However, I was a bit heavier with the spices- I was very liberal with the garlic and added oregano and Italian seasoning, but I always add more spices to everything I cook. Either way, this recipe was awesome- definitely a keeper!

I thought this receipe was great. Very easy to make. I did take a couple of suggestions and added a couple table spoons of Italian dressing to the oil and a little more garlic. I will certainly make this again.

This dish was so delicious and so easy to make! My husband, who usually likes to critique my dishes, for once had nothing else to complain about.  To make sure the chicken was cooked through, i baked covered with foil for about 20 minutes, then uncovered for another 20 minutes to get a crunchy coating.

Excellent!  I added about 1/4 cup of Bisquick to the italian bread crumbs to add to the breading,  used Kraft parmesan cheese and sprinkled a little garlic powder in there as well. I also increased the crushed garlic to 3 cloves. Very tasty and the chicken was very moist. A keeper!

Very good chicken recipe. Instead of dipping the chicken in the oil/garlic mixtures I dipped it in Italian dressing and then in the bread crumb mixture.

Made this tonight and the family literally ate it up!  Like so many others have said, it turned out so moist and juicy, much more so than any other chicken dish I've made.  I don't know what it was.  Followed the recipe exactly except used seasoned bread crumbs, 3 big chicken breasts, and McCormick's minced garlic (all I had).  This is my new fave chicken recipe :)

Absolutely awesome flavor-made this for dinner tonight. I did cover with foil for 20 minutes, uncovering for the last 10 min. I topped with shredded mozzarella & put under the broiler til melted. Will definitely make this again!

Excellent! The whole family loved it. The chicken was surprisingly moist. Many baked chicken recipes I've tried come out a little tough, but not this one. The only modification I made was to put in under the broiler for the last few minutes to give the topping a little crispiness.

This chicken was very good.  Moist and super easy to make.  I already had all the ingredients on hand so it was a nice throw together dish.  But not exactly super distinguishable from all the other breaded chicken recipes.

I used panko breadcrumbs because that's all I keep here, aside from that the only thing I did different was I used chicken that had been sitting in FF italian dressing (I was just going to bake it like that until I came across this), coated it with the coating and put on a rack to bake turning once so that it didn't get soggy. WOW.

The flavor was not good, and there were too many breadcrumbs on the chicken.  The chicken was not even slightly crispy.  I would not recommend this recipe.

This is a favorite. I make it all the time. I made it when my parents and boyfriend's parents came over for dinner and met for the first time. Both left with the recipe and my mom raved about it to my grandmother so she wanted the recipe too. This is great served with tomato sauce and whole wheat pasta or just with veggies and rice!

This was really good. I followed another reviewers advice and used stove top stuffing mix crushed up in place of bread crumbs. I used breast filets. The chicken was a bit dry but I think it's because I cooked it too long. Served with angel hair pasta, homemade marinara, and garlic bread.

I thought this was tasty.  Next time I won't top with remaining bread crumbs, because I thought that was too much.  Instead, I will top with extra parmesan cheese in the last 5 minutes.

I have two of the pickiest eaters in my house and this was a big hit! I used Italian style bread crumbs instead of plain and I also used precut garlic in olive oil (big time saver). My husband and son LOVED it! There was nothing left on their plates and even asked for seconds! I will be making this dish again and again!

Me and hubby love this recipe. We couple it with parmesan pasta roni and it's really good. The crust on the chicken is so good. Wish it was a little healthier, but it's worth it for the flavor!

Simple, but very good.  I have made this many, many times.  We prefer oregano over basil so we usually make that change.  Also, I made this once for company that needed a heart-healthy diet, so I reduced the Parmesan cheese to 2-3 T, and it still tasted great.  Obviously you can easily change the seasonings and/or the breadcrumbs for variety.  A keeper recipe for taste and ease of prep.

Great recipe.  I had large bone-in chicken breasts and it took 50 minutes at 400 degree.  Made just a few minor adjustments-used panko breadcrumbs, sprinkled leftover oil and crumbs on top, and then put a few half squares, small, of butter on top, to brown.  Yumm.

just ok.  I would recomend using something other than oil to coat the chicken before adding the breading to it. It made it kinda greasy, although the chicken didn't dry out at all.  I started with frozen chicken breasts and baked an hour.  Will use other recipe next time.

I'm not fond of breaded meats, but I knew this would present well for a women's dinner I was serving.  I made it exactly by the recipe except I had an extra breast so I needed a little extra olive oil; but the breading amount was just right for a light coating.  Very flavorful and tender!  Will definitely fall back on this recipe whenever chicken breasts are on sale!

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Rating 2 stars because the chicken had no flavor whatsoever.  Have a recipe very similar to this one from Paula Deen called Oven Fried Chicken.  Will definitely stick with that one because of flavor.

Very good!  We followed the recipe exactly, the only exception being that we added more garlic to the oil and topped the chicken with some mozzarella cheese.  Served it with some pasta.  Very tasty!  Will make this again for sure!

It turned out great, though I would just sprinkle the coating mix lightly over the top and in the last 10 min of baking sprinkle some extra parm on top.

Thanks for the recipe!  The chicken turned-out moist, tender and flavorful.  We didn't even need the salt and pepper shakers on the dinner table!  I will definitely make this one again.  (My husband, who rarely says much about what I make for dinner, commented twice about how good it was)

This was delicious. I used chicken tenders rather than breasts but they worked just perfectly. I baked them less than called for because I'm convinced that cooking chicken the full time will dry it out greatly.

This was so tasty and moist. I will never open up a package of shake and bake again. My three old loved her "chicken nuggets"!  This is a must try recipe, and with 2 kids running around the house I was able to put it together in about 10 minutes and place it into the oven.  Thanks for the great post and another way to jazz up baked chicken.

This was fabulous and I had to add it to my recipe box! I substituted Italian bread crumbs for plain. To crisp it up, put it under broiler for a moment or two before serving. My husband said this is a keeper! Thanks!

OMG! This was awesome!!!  I used more garlic than the recipe suggests and I increased the parmesan cheese.  I did lightly sprinkle some seasoning salt on the chicken before dredging in the oil and garlic. I also used thin sliced chicken breasts which I believe allowed the flavor to go all through the chicken.  I will be making this regularly.

This was very good.  I melted 1 cube of salted butter in fresh minced garlic (added more garlic than calls for)and warmed it.  Then rolled in the butter/garlic mixture, then in the parmesan/bread crumb mix. Added more parmesan less bread crumbs. Peppered it with coarse pepper.  Didn't sprinkle with salt because the butter is salted and the parmesan is salted.  It was delicious.

I didn't care for the flavor of this recipe much but I'm giving it three stars because the chicken came out very moist.  My husband enjoyed the flavor but I found the bread crumb flavor to be a bit overwhelming.  If I make this again, I will use more cheese and less breadcrumbs.

My girlfriend thinks that this recipe deserves 3 stars but I think it was better than that... She and I both agree that it didn't have enough flavor and that a bit more garlic would help a lot.  Also, the mix doesn't promote moist chicken.  Definitely watch it so that it doesn't dry out on you...

We absolutely enjoyed this recipe! My 23 year old son isn't very fond of chicken and normally asks if he can fix something else when I prepare chicken. He has enjoyed almost every chicken recipe I have made from this wonderful website....much to his surprise. I served this with some pasta and marinara sauce. OUT OF THIS WORLD GARLICKY GOODNESS!

This was a very fast and easy recipe. it was moist and good but you just need to flavor the chicken your way before you cook Everyone has their own style, but I think that you just need to find the thing that can really make this recipe POP.

You MUST cut the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese quantities in half.  You will still have plenty to spare.  Next day, cut up leftovers to use in a salad and was de-lish!

WOW!  This was a huge hit with my guests!  Everyone went on and on about how great it was.  I followed the recipe exactly how it was written (I used Panko bread crumbs).  After it was done baking I turned the broiler on and left it in for a few minutes to brown, and then topped each piece of chicken with mozzarella cheese.  I served over pasta.

This recipe was very good. I didn't change a thing and served it with a parmesan sauce over seasoned spaghetti noodles.

This was so good. The only thing that I changed was that I pounded out the chicken so it was thin, more like a cutlet. It turned out perfectly cooked following the recipe exactly.

I am in love with this recipe! I also LOVE the idea of cooking them on a cooling rack on a baking sheet! They came out so much better than ANY of my oven baked chicken has ever had!! The ingredients are pretty simple. Although I made this recipe to the exact ingredient next time I will replace the oil for egg whites and possibly not use ant bread crumbs or use Panko Whole Wheat Crumbs for a even crunchier texture. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Being a garlic-Parmesan lover, I used 10 finely minced cloves of garlic in several tablespoons of olive oil and matched the amount of freshly-grated Parmesan cheese with Italian bread crumbs.  I coated 8 chicken breasts very generously with the mixture and distributed all of the leftover minced garlic amongst the chicken breasts.  Baked as directed.  My kids said it was the best garlic-Parmesan chicken I have ever made. It was definitely superb.

This was SO good and so quick!  We didn't have bread crumbs on hand, so we used crushed up Ritz crackers.  We also used an "Italian blend" of shredded cheese rather than Parmesan.  Wow.  This is definitely a keeper!

These were so easy and tasted great! I used ritz crackers because I was out of my seasoned bread crumbs that I usually use and it was fantastic. I seasoned the chicken before coating it. Other than that I followed the recipe and this is a keeper in my house!

Excellent!  I did just use Italian bread crumbs instead of seasoning plan bread crumbs.  I also pound out my chicken.  Very yummy recipe.

I added a bit of onion powder to the oil/garlic mixture, and used about twice as much oil as called for. It turned out great! The second time I made it I used this recipe for a Chicken Parmesan base: cooked in an oven-safe skillet, took it out of the oven after 20 minutes, then transferred it to the stove and drenched it with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Turned out wonderfully.

Definitely needs more seasoning. I used some Italian seasoning and basil leaves, but felt it still needed more flavor.  used 2 chicken breasts split in two (four thin breasts) and halved all dry ingredients.  Used 1 garlic clove minced with 2 tsp olive oil. Sprinkled extra kraft parmesan on top.
Will make again. Goes great with parmesan butter noodles and brussel sprouts.

I tried following some of the suggestions by using less bread crumbs and oil- next time will just follow first directions. Was still very good, just needed a little more breading.

The combination of parmesan and garlic on the chicken was very overwhelming.  I wasn't able to eat more than a couple bites, I will definately stick with my basic chicken parmesan recipe.

This was super easy, and healthier due to the olive oil (vs. butter) so I will definitely use it again for my family (served it with a parmesan and olive oil angel hair pasta) but probably won't make it for company. It's not a wow recipe in my book, but pretty good.

This recipe was so easy. My hubby and I loved it! I had it for dinner and it was just as good for lunch the next day. I followed the directions precisely and was very pleased. I would say that the amount of breadcrumb mixture was  overstated. I ended up throwing away alot. I wish that I would have only used a 1/2 cup of parmesan and a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs...could have accomplished the same goal. Other than that, LOVED LOVED LOVED IT! Will make again.

Wow! This is so quick and easy. I really enjoyed making it, and my husband is scarfing it down as we speak. He loves it. I put a little herbamare in the bread crumbs and a touch of Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt in the olive oil/garlic mixture. Thanks for a great recipe.

I found this recipe so simple and easy to throw together on a busy weeknight!

I had nothing prepared for dinner and had to come up with something quick using only ingredients on hand. It turned out great.. only changes were using Italian style bread crumbs, baking for an additional 1/2 hr (bone in chicken) and topped with salsa and mozz. cheese for the last 10 minutes.

And I agree with the others.. this does make way too much of the breading. I used 6 large pieces of chicken and ended up throwing 3/4 of the crumb mixture out.

Excellent recipe! The chicken came out really moist and the flavors all went together wonderfully. I made it with fusilli, tomato sauce, and cheesy garlic bread, which went together with the chicken really well.

I would recommend getting smaller chicken breast halves in you can, though. I bought five large ones and it was almost enough for two meals [mind you, I made it for four people]. This also meant that it had to be in the oven for longer than 30 minutes as the recipe suggests.

But overall, this recipe is a keeper! : )

The dish was very good. I did do some things differently. I seasoned the chicken first with pepper, salt, adobo, and sazon. I also mixed the oil with garlic, and a dash of salt and pepper, and put it in the microwave for about 30 secs., so it can really blend together. I did not have any basil, so i substituted for oregano. I did not dip the chicken in the oil, but i did use a brush, which was perfect. While chicken cooking in oven, every 15 minutes i flipped the chicken so it would not get  wet at bottom. The chicken came out perfect juicy inside not dry at all and crispy on out. i had to cook the chicken for 45 minutes, due to the size of the breast. I also topped it off w/ a salad of mixed greens,  tomatoes, red onions, kalamata  olives and balsamic vinaigrette. From the words of my husband, "Baby, you got to make this again for my business dinner!"

I didn't have bread crumbs in the house so took a chance and made this without for a really quick easy dinner. It was AWESOME!! My boyfriend who puts Ketchup on EVERYTHING even ate it without the Ketchup this time. Definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight.  I boiled chicken thighs and then baked.  I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I substituted with Ritz wheat crackers.  My husband and 4 year old loved it!!!  Great with mashed potatoes. I will make this again.

This was such a great meal! My husband and I have been trying chicken dishes and this one takes the cake.  Very moist chicken (I used 2lbs tenders). I also added the salt and pepper to the oil/garlic mix. That way each piece had ample amt on each. Excellent!

Absolutely fabulous. My husband made this while I made a quick Alfredo sauce. We placed a bed of cooked wide egg noodles on a plate, poured about a half cup of alfredo sauce over the noodles and then topped it with the garlic parmesan chicken. It was fantastic. My husband stated that it could use some garlic salt in the parm mixture.

Great base recipe for this simple dish. I crushed stuffing mix and some French fried onions I had leftover in the pantry from Thanksgiving to make the breading. Added parm, garlic powder, and pepper. You can mix this recipe up any way you want and it will still be tasty and super easy.

My husband said this is at the top of the list of his favorite dinners I have prepared!  I followed the recipe exactly and found it moist, flavorful and easy to prepare.  A new regular recipe in our house.  Good for company or family fare.  Served with paremsan rice and steamed Tuscan veggies.  Went down well with the wee bit of champage I had left over from New Year - LOL.

Yummy recipe.  Mine came out very tender and juicy after I made a few minor modifications: 1. Pounded the chicken breasts to flatten out a bit. 2. Seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, garlic powder and Italian seasoning. 3. Marinated the chicken in buttermilk for about 90 minutes. (Even tossed a little spice in the marinade for grins.) 4. Blended the garlic cloves and olive oil together in a mini-food processor. 5. Used Panko bread crumbs. I definitely will make this again. We served with a side dish of noodles and alfredo sauce.

this was so easy and so juicy! I used panko bread crumbs in addition to 1 tblspoon of italian bread crumbs as I prefer the light crunch of the panko bc.  
This recipe is going to be in our normal rotation of easy weeknight cooking!

Have made this twice and it is SO good.  My husband loves it and he is so picky.  I pretty much follow directions exactly but have used breast tenders instead of whole breast both times and serve with whole wheat pasta and spaghetti sauce.

Very good and flavorful.  It was easy to make.  I made as is and wouldn't change anything.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 b/c this is very similar to Garlic Cheddar Chicken also on this site and I like it a bit better.

However, I think this recipe would be great with alfredo and noodles.  I will try that next time.  It's a keeper!  Thanks.

The flavor of this dish is very good. It is also very quick and easy to prepare. The only thing I didn't care for was that the coating never got crisp or crunchy. Soggy breaded chicken isn't very appealing. I followed the directions exactly. But still, I would make this again.

My husband loved this one.  However after reading all the reviews about adding salt I thought I should.  I was wrong, it would have been perfect with just a little bit more garlic though.  I loved how fast and easy this was to make.  One for the recipe box

I was surprised at how moist this chicken was.  Instead of bread crumbs I used Italian croûtons.  I also added parsley and garlic powder for more flavor.  Great with   Alfredo sauce.

This was good but next time I think I will add salt to the chicken before dipping in the oil/garlic mixture.  Also, I only used 4 breasts and needed to add another tablespoon of oil and garlic for the last piece of chicken.  Overall, a pretty good and easy recipe.

This was really good, and easy.  I actually marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for two days before making. That substituted for the oil/garlic step, and also added flavor and moisture to the chicken itself.

I served it with homemade spaghetti sauce, but it was just as good without.

A good breaded chicken recipe that is lacking some pizazz.  I served this with linguine and it was a bit bland.  I too had way too much bread crumbs left over but would rather have too many than not enough. However, next time I think I will try adding mozzarella cheese on the breasts and sauce on chicken and linguine.  However, it is a very easy recipe and the chicken was very moist.

This was very good.  I varied the directions slightly by omitting the olive oil/garlic mixture to dip it in.  Instead, I patted the chicken breasts & dipped them in flour (with a little salt, pepper, and a touch of italian seasoning), then dipped them in beaten eggs, then dipped them in the bread crumb mixture.  I also added a little bit of garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture.  Turned out great with the linguini and spaghetti sauce we had with it.  Very easy.  It doesn't get 5 stars because as one reviewer said, it wasn't "knock your socks off" good, but it was very good.

This was wonderful. My husband has wanted me to make him chicken parm for so long and he loved it(and he doesn't like baked chicken)! I added half a slice of mozzerela cheese on each breast, served with lingiuni and topped both with Marinara sauce. Will be making plenty more of this dish!

This is a family favorite!!!  My husband and kids devour it!!!  The recipie is perfect but I tend to let the galic infuse the olive oil for about 5-10 minutes before getting started and it adds alittle more flavor.

Pretty good, but nothing super spectacular.  I think it'd be best served with a red sauce of sorts because the chicken alone needed something.  I'll probably make this again, but add to the meal a bit.

Fantastic - the chicken was so moist, and tasty. I did use seasoned bread crumbs, and added italian seasoning to it. Instead of 1 clove of garlic I did 3 and warmed the oil/ garlic mixture in the microwave on low for a few seconds. I used 8 chicken thighs and had just enough oil and breadcumbs. This was soooo good.

Fantastic recipe! I used 7 skinless breast tenders seasoned with salt and pepper before dredging in the oil mix. 2/3 cup each of breadcrumbs and parmesean and I still had way too much left over. Added powdered oregano and cayenne to the dry ingredients. Baked 30 minutes, came out wonderful!

My fiance didn't really like this that much.  I thought it was decent... definitely serve with some marinara sauce because it's a little boring without it.  But, it's easy and it tastes pretty good with a little sauce on top.

This got rave reviews even as leftovers.  I changed one thing.  I was out of bread crumbs so I mushed up Aircrisped Wheat Thins (veggie flavor).  Worked great and added extra flavor

Very good. I served it with asparagus and tomato parmesean noodles. Needed to cook the chicken a bit longer than listed but all around it was great. Along with the other readers, this recipe leaves you with a lot of unused breadcrumbs. overall, it was great

This was definitely an easy recipe made for those nights when you really don't want to spend too much time in the kitchen. LOVE THAT! Only problem I found was that the chicken either needed to be browned in a pan first, or thrown in the broiler for a minute or two at the end to brown/crispen up the breading. Without that it was still fairly dry and mushy. Will make again, possibly just on the stovetop next time.

I just made this and it was excellent. I made alot more of the oil garlic mixture then called for(but I LOVE garlic) and also took another members advice and used a brush to brush on the mixture (I also added parmesan cheese to the oil.) for about the last 10 min I put on the broiler and it really helped crisp up the chicken. I think next time I will use more parm cheese then breadcrumbs...delicious.

This is a very easy and delicious dish.  My entire family loves it.  It's so easy, while it bakes I make a side dish and salad and dinner is ready in no time.  I like to let the fresh garlic sit in the oil for the day, it flavor's the oil better.

I made this for my roommate and she loved it.  It was easy and quick to make. I added a tsp. of parsley flakes and use equal parts bread crumbs and cheese.  We now call it Julie's Favorite Chicken after my roommate.

This was very easy to make.  I was in charge of cooking dinner for 12 people on a ski trip in a cabin and this was VERY easy to make.  I took the oil and garlic with me.  I took the breading mixture already mixed in a ziploc bag and a bag of frozen chicken breasts from Costco.  They thawed out pretty quickly and I baked them on a cookie sheet I brought with me.  It was SO easy.  Everyone loved them!  I served it with some spaghetti and garlic bread and we had a feast!

Excellent recipe! I modified it just a bit - I added a tiny bit of chicken broth to the casserole dish and covered with foil. It was sooo tender and flavorful. I also sprinkled mozzarella cheese on the top at the end. I will definitely make it again.

eh, it was ok. Maybe I did something wrong, but it did not turn out as expected. I will only make again if these are the only ingredients in the house and we are out of italian dressing to marinate the chicken in. Not a keeper.

This a great recipe. It was getting a little dry so 10 minutes before it was done I threw a 1/4 cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the dish. It was delicious, I spooned the drippings on top of the chicken.

I did not deviate from the recipe, and it was good, but not great. A little bland in my opinion, and husband said it was "okay". Not a bad dinner, but there are enough things I like better that I probably won't make this one again.

With one change, this is easily the best chicken! Delicious, tender, juicy...you'll be asked for the recipe.  The change:  I used homemade pesto mixed with a little olive oil to coat chicken (instead of oil & garlic). Try it!

I made this for my Bible Study and it was a big hit - Since I was making it for 10 but using small chicken breasts, I didn't use the suggested measurments, I just kind of estimated.  I also used about 4 cloves of garlic and used Italian bread crumbs to add a little extra flavor... I did have to cook it about 45 minutes but that could be because I had so many breasts in the dish.  Everyone loved and my husband even wants me to make it again!

This was absolutely delicious!!  We only used 2 chicken breasts, but halved the ingredients for everything else (and added 2 cloves of garlic).  The chicken was incredibly moist and juicy and the flavour was very delicate - not overpowering at all.  I think the only think I will change when we make this again is to add one more clove of garlic to the olive oil.

This recipe was quite good,I did use 3 garlic cloves instead of 1 and left the chicken breasts whole, I also found that the extra breadcrumbs were not nessasary a little to dry, I will make this again with a few extra spices,cheers

I made this last night, and my very picky 4 year old ate it.  I used lemon-herb chicken breasts which gave it more flavor.

Excellent & very tasty.  I covered with foil for the 1st 15 min, then I added a 2 tblsp of Ragu on each chicken breast & finished baking.

Great recipe.  Could have used a little more flavor (maybe more garlic?  I don't know...).  I didn't have enough olive oil so I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 canola oil.  Thanks!

Here is another review that changes the recipe a bit!  I note the changes because it allows me to repeat what I did when I first prepared this dish AND I view recipes as a starting off point when I head to the kitchen.  I took 2 boneless chicken breasts and cut them into chunks.  I mixed about a 1/2 cup gf seasoned crumbs and 1 cup of parmesan in a plastic bag and tossed in the chicken.  I let it sit in the fridge for about 3 hours.  Meanwhile, I cooked sliced garlic and onion in an oven safe skillet and set it aside.  I put mushrooms in the bottom of the skillet, put the chicken in and topped with the cooked garlic and onion and topped with the crumbs and cheese.  I sprinkled a bit of olive oil over all and baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  I'll certainly make this again with changes:  chicken thighs, halved mushrooms and a bit of broth/white wine in the bottom of the skillet prior to baking.  I also thought these chunks of chicken would be delightful in a sub sandwich topped with red pasta sauce!

This was one of the most bland, tasteless dishes I have ever made.  Followed the recipe exactly. 
Certainly won't make it again, and can't think of anything that would have improved it.  
Had LOTS of leftovers - everyone dived into their vegetable and rice accompaniments instead.

Delicious.   Meat came out very juicy and tender.  I baked the chicken breasts for 50 minutes instead of the 30 minutes as suggested in the recipe because they were quite large.   My husband really liked this recipe.

I made it with Panko (lower in salt) and I cooked it about 5-8 minutes longer and let it rest for about 10 minutes. It was really delicious and tender. The chicken breasts were sliced lengthwise. Delicious!

This dish turned out very well.  I marinated the chicken in the olive oil and garlic for an hour or so.  There seemed to be too much bread crumb mixture, but I just poured it over the top of the chicken before baking.

I added a little bit to this recipe, which may have made it taste above and beyond and make me want to keep eating it! I used fresh basil and added fresh oregano as well, used an egg wash instead of olive oil, added salt and the garlic to the dry ingredients, and brined the chicken. Brining chicken makes a huge difference and keeps it moist and flavorful after cooking. I also used thighs instead of breasts (because sales), but I don't know how much that contributed to the overall flavor.

my husband and I thought it was average. one of my three-year-olds really liked it. I did pound the chicken first, and it needed slightly longer than 30 minutes anyway.

It was not bad! I used crushed up rice crackers instead of breadcrumbs because my sister is on a gluten-free diet.

Outstanding! I cannot tell you how annoying it is to have to read through hundreds of 5 star reviews with other people rating their own recipes. This recipe stands beautifully on it's own! I like to marinate my chicken in buttermilk for a few hours before cooking, which makes it more moist, but absolutely not necessary. This recipe, exactly as written, is now one of my favorites. Thank you!!!!!

Did not make any changes and it was wonderful. Made double recipe and froze 1/2 of the cooked recipe. When time to fix it 3 weeks later I thawed out the cooked chicken bread wrapped on counter. When ready to warm for supper, I wrapped It loosely in aluminum foil and parchment paper  and warmed it at 350 for 35 minutes / even better than first portion. A definite repeat dinner at our house! Wonderful with corn on the cob!!!!!

I substituted the garlic clove with granulated garlic. The rest of the recipe seems to be geared to faster and easy,  this kept it all in line with the rest of the recipe. 
 I also substituted Pecorino Romano for the parmesan. This worked out better because of a more interesting flavor profile, yet  being an easy to obtain ingredient.

Been making this for about 5 years now, at least once per month. I make it exactly as written. It's great, just as is. I never seem to have any trouble with the coating falling off or being soggy so not sure why some  do.

Easy delicious recipe.  I did make a change, instead of using olive oil I used zesty Italian salad dressing and dipped the chicken breasts first then coated with crumbs.  For crumbs, I used half crushed garlic/butter croutons, and other half homemade croutons.  I had made an Italian baked potato medley side dish. I would change my side dish to a bed of ziti noodles and marinara sauce sprinkled with fresh parmesan.  I will be making this again.

There’s a lot of hate on this simple recipe, and lots of ideas to “soup it up.” My family enjoys it. I just use Italian Style breadcrumbs. I swear I’ve seen this same recipe that uses those.

I cut the recipe in half making 4 servings. I used Italian bread crumbs. I would not do that again, with all the basil and other things added, it made it overpowering. I will also cut the breading 1/2 again, there was too much and the chicken didn’t have a chance. I will update when I give it another try.

This was super easy (which is good, because I like easy), and delicious! Next time I’ll probably pound out the chicken breasts, but it was tender and flavorful.

It was very flavorful, juicy, breading gave it a nice crunch with each bite. I added shredded Parmesan cheese on top, which brought it all together.

This is one of my family’s favorite recipes. The kids and their significant others always ask if I’m making ‘that chicken’ when they come home to visit. You can hear a pin drop as they devour it!  I cut up & pound out the chicken so it’s tender. I put the basil & pepper in with the oil and garlic. I also dice up potatoes and either broccoli or asparagus. I arrange it around the chicken and you have a full meal. NOTE: I use a cookie sheet with sides. When cutting & pounding out chicken, you end up with a lot more!

This was very good! I did not have bread crumbs so I improvised with crushed Garlic Ritz crackers and the the flavor was AMAZING! ... Such an easy dish for a guy who considers himself a bad cook. HAHA!

I used 6 cloves of garlic and panku - additional herbs. Tried the rack under chicken but ended up taking it out at halfway as it wasn't getting a crunchy brown on the bottom. Turned out excellent. (used extra crumbs and cheese too ) thank you

One of the best ultra easy recipes I have ever made. I think even my husband could do it! And he doesn’t cook.

I used roasted garlic in a jar rather than peeling a garlic clove and it worked out just great.

I used this recipe as a jumping-off point and it did its job really well. The recipe required salt and more oil in my opinion (I added melted ghee) in order to coat it breadcrumbs better. Extremely simple prep and I will be adding this recipe to my staples. 

Some say it's bland but if you use good parmesan, olive oil, and garlic it should be pretty flavorful. Again, it's a good base recipe.

It was very tasty but the breading did not stick to the chicken and became "pasty".  Not sure how to modify it so that the breading becomes crispier.

I loved this recipe.  It was very easy to make and it tastes great. I served it over Rice Pilaf and everyone loved it.  I did read some of the reviews and based on what I saw I decided go just a little light on the breadcrumbs so that the chicken got a little more of the parmesan flavor.  It didn't come out as crispy as I was hoping but I think I used a little too much oil,  I suggest letting as much of the olive oil drip off of the breast before you add the breadcrumb mix.  I think it would help.

I didn't half the chicken and it still turned out great, just had enough crumbs left over for  probably 2 more breasts. The only thing I would really do different is put them on a pan to keep the bottoms from getting soggy, and maybe flipping it half ways through.

Well, ok as a starter recipie but I did tweak. Had some ham pieces left from Christmas. Slit the breast and stuffed it added some Gorgonzola in with the ham and then rolled and baked. Also marinated bereast for about 2 hrs in oil, garlic, salt and pepper.

A very good recipe, when you avoid some simple to do mistakes. Some of the common mistakes I saw in the reviews were:
- Mushy: If you flipped it during cooking, you would probably get a mushy crust top. Don't flip it if you want the breading to crisp! (AKA: Don't flip it, the recipe doesn't call for it.)
- Took longer to cook: Most likely, these reviewers cooked full chicken breasts, rather than halves. This could also lead to other issues. Cut thicker pieces into smaller pieces, so they will cook better.
- Ran out of... : As above with took too long to cook, these people most likely tried cooking too large of pieces of chicken. Though, I will note now that I found there was just the right amount of olive oil mixture for four half breasts, maybe five. So I do recommend a little more oil mixture for any more than 5 half breasts being prepared.
- Flavorless: These people probably did not add in enough herbs to their mixture. Use what style of breadcrumbs you like. I personally used what I had on hand, Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I have also found that I've always liked anything breaded like this to have half breadcrumbs and half Panko as I like a little extra crunch. These should not have had enough of a change to the recipe to make much note. (Also, add in any extra breading mix right to the top of the chicken before cooking.)

My only strong note might be, despite everything else being great, possibly to cook it at 375 degrees F for a little more browned top crust.

Followed directions exactly & ended up with the driest chicken in history. I would suggest 375F instead of 350F. That way the chicken cooks faster & does not have a chance to dry out.

I made a few changes, it's a trini thing, I used crushed corn flakes instead of breadcrumbs, and used baked the breast with Hunt's tomato paste spread on them with spicy seasoning.

This is our new favorite chicken recipe! We make it to top salads, with roasted potatoes, &/or anything else we decide to have with it. It's always the main focus of what's for dinner!! It's a must!!!

First of all, I appreciate al lithe wonderful reviews but I wanted to read reviews about this chicken exactly how the recipe says. I followed the recipe to a T, and there wasn’t enough olive oil to coat the chicken breast halves, 30 minutes was simply not enough time to cook the chicken and the breadcrumbs did not stick to the chicken as well as it should. I flipped the chicken over at 30 minutes because the bread crumbs still looked soggy, and most of it came off. Tasty though. Hence the 2 stars

I make this all the time.  I only had bread crumbs with Italian seasonings this last time so didn’t add basil just some pepper.   The only thing is they never brown. I placed them under the broiler( as someone suggested) for a few min.
Are there other suggestions to help them brown.  They are a family favorite and I serve it all the time to a crowd of 20.

Wicked Chicken Dinner!  A few modifications in my recipe. I used corn flake bread crumbs with regular bread crumbs and added Italian seasoning spices to the bread crumb mixture. I also used fresh Italian parsley in the mixture.  The chicken breast was lightly sprinkled with Montreal Chicken Spice before dipping into the oil/garlic mixture.  The chicken was tender and very flavourful.  Served with mash potatoes and green beans. Deliscious.

This was so much easier and quicker than dredging it in flour, egg and breadcrumbs.  Maybe healthier too.

I made it with a combination of grated Parmesan cheese and shredded, added a bit more garlic (I love the taste of garlic in my food) and it came out perfect.......and yes I will make it again.

Decided to try this and do something different, I did the olive oil and garlic, but I used minced garlic and I added extra olive oil 2 tablespoons didn't seem to be enough when I was placing the chicken in the bowl I also added extra garlic as I did have big pieces of chicken. I would just adjust the olive oil and garlic to the size of the chicken you need to coat. After coating it with the bread crumbs I placed it on the backing sheet and baked it, It was so moist and delicious I would make it again for sure.

I had to improvise a little with garlic salt and Italian style bread crumbs, and I decided to add a little bit of Rosemary. So freaking delicious, and pretty easy even by my standards! 10 out of 10!

Easy to prepare.  I used a sheep based cheese for dietary reasons so I am sure any grate able cheese would work.  The chicken breasts I used were not halved so after the recipe cooking time the chicken was not done.  Supposedly white meat chicken is cooked when the  temperature is 160^F.

Tasted great.

Easy chicken recipe! I put all the dry ingredients in a ziplock bag and coated the chicken that way. I feel like the chicken gets more of an even coating this way. The chicken was flavorful and so moist. Will definitely be making this often! I just need to make more next time so I can use the leftovers for salads or wraps :)

I love this recipe! The bread crumbs & cheese add crunch and flavor to chicken! I am gluten free, so I processed 2 slices of GF Bread in my mini cuisinart and it worked perfectly. This seems healthier than fried, but that was quite a bit of parmesan cheese!  Delicious and I'll make it again!

this was excellent after reading the comments i decided to do my own spin on it when i made it but to be honest i dont think it changed the flavor that much. i rubbed the chicken with soul seasoning and put a little ground oregano in the breading mix otherwise i did it per recipe and it was excellent

When I made it added cheddar and mozzarella cheese to the bread crum mix. I also added a dash of celery salt, garlic salt, and sea salt to the bread crumb mix. I added a little butter to the oil and garlic mix. To the oil mix I added a few more garlic cloves and a more oil because I ran out of oil mix after the second chicken. I adored the chicken!!

Made only 4 breasts, but did not adjust recipe size. I did not have enough parm. to do the recipe, so I used 1/2 low fat/moisture mozzarella and pulsed in bullet to make a uniform crumble. Then I added fresh basil that I had on hand. Baked as written, however took more than 40 minutes to cook completely (chicken was fresh and not very thick). Remember cook time may vary! Overall the taste was good and cheesy , but it could have used more garlic and maybe some heat from chili powder. Will probably make again with adjustments.

WONDERFUL!!!  6 out of 5 stars!!   This was so delicious!  I read other reviews that said it was bland so I did add some garlic powder to the olive oil.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Served it with green beans and new potatoes but would be delicious with pasta and sauce as well.  Everyone in my house liked it and said that they would like to have it again.  Was simple to make and wonderful.

It's super easy, most, and tender! Love it! The only things I did differently were to use more olive oil and garlic, and top each piece of chicken with a very thin slice of lime.

I used Panko crumbs which I toasted in a dry skillet until they were golden brown. I let them cool before adding the cheese and spices. This improves the appearance a lot.

It was good. Chicken came out moist and flavorful.  Only change I made was I covered it for the first 20 minutes to keep the chicken from drying out.  Then I uncovered it for the last 10 minutes  to crisp up the breading. My wife loved it!

My family and I did not care for this recipe.  We found it to be bland in taste and soggy on the bottom.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I made 6 chicken breasts and plan on making a chicken parm type dish with the leftovers.  Hopefully they will taste better if they are crisped up with olive oil and topped with marinara sauce and shredded Parmesan.  I’m giving 3 stars because it was easy to make and the chicken came out tender.  Thanks for the recipe but I don’t plan on making this one again.

This was a great go-to when my dinner plans fell through. Simple, quick and delish! The only thing I changed was using thin cut chicken breast because we are not fans of the thick type. Made 2 packages of 1 1/3 lbs each, baked for 10, then broil for 3 to crisp them up. Family of 4 with 2 teens, I have 3 remaining pieces...will add to salad for lunches!  Would be a great way to make a quick Chicken Parm with sauce, too!

Bad news. The bread crumbs added no flavor and the garlic overpowered the parmesan flavor.  I love olive oil but it didn't add any flavor to this recipe. I will go back to my old recipe which uses melted butter and grated parmesan cheese.

Making this as written turned out a soggy and bland chicken breast. There was not enough olive oil and garlic to coat 6 pieces of chicken only 4. I would suggest baking it on 375 for 25 minutes and seasoning the actual chicken before coating with olive oil and garlic and using seasoned bread crumbs for the coating.

Thank you so much for the recipe. I'm 16 years old and love to cook, and I finally got my parents to let me make them dinner. I made this recipe. I did everything pretty much the same, except I made a lot more bread crumb mix and oil mix and I put garlic salt and rosemary in with the breadcrumb mix. Thank you so much. And they loved it, too, so I might even get to cook for then more regularly.

Super easy and delicious recipe as written.  The second time I made it, I used thyme instead of basil, added a few lemon slices and butter to the bottom of a cast iron skillet.  I placed the breaded chicken on top of the lemon/butter combo, threw in a couple of sprigs of thyme and baked at 350 until done.  I was then able to use the drippings to make a thin-ish gravy/sauce.  Served with either mashed potatoes or rice - my family loves it!!

I had too much breadcrumbs & parm left over - so I need to remember to use less.

Excellent but yes, with changes.  Panko instead of breadcrumbs. A few dashes of Jane's Mixed Up Salt.  Increased temperature to 375 and added 5 minutes but that is probably just due to variations in ovens.  The family loved the flavor.

We were not excited by this recipe. Maybe they were a little big . 
 I had to bake an extra 20 minutes and I found them tough and boring.

This chicken was delicious! One tip - make sure you use seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain, I used Italian-style and would highly recommend. The only other thing I did differently was salt & pepper the chicken itself because I like to make sure my meat is very seasoned. It turned out SO juicy and flavorful, even better than expected. I served with a Parmesan broccoli pasta and it was a great combo. I will definitely be adding this in to my regular recipe rotation.

I made this as written. It was a good basic recipe that can be adjusted to one's own tastes. As some have noted, some of the crumb mixture was crispy and some was more moist. That didn't bother me at all. I tried it again a second time with a few simple adjustments. I used a bit more olive oil and added a tablespoon of butter, which I melted. I used my own dry breadcrumbs and added some Italian seasoning to it rather than just dried basil. It was delicious. Thanks!

Made the recipe as written, but after reading other reviews, I did use bread crumbs with italian seasoning, and I did add some shredded mozzarella at the end, and baked 5 extra minutes.  Otherwise, it was as written, and was super.  My husband loved it too.

I made this for the first time. It was really good. The only thing I would suggest is to not add the leftover bread crum mix to the top of the chicken like the recipes suggests, it wasn’t baked on the way it should have been and was kinda weird. But other than that, it was pretty good.

It was good but came out rather dry; I had to add more olive oil and garlic in order to cover all the chicken and had too many bread crumbs and too much parmesan cheese leftover.  It was tasty though.

Followed suggestions and added Montreal chicken spice and oregano. To shorten cooking time, I sliced the breasts thinner, for a meal in a hurry.

Turned out great for us. Only thing I would modify next time is to make more of the oil mixture and less of the breading mix.

Have made this recipe several times now and last two time I sautéed the garlic in the olive oiled which I thought gave it a bit more flavor.  MY wife who is a big garlic fan really enjoyed the Chicken as well

It was pretty okay.  Reminded me of shake n bake.   I added more pepper and some oregano.  The top of the chicken never did get very crispy.  Overall it's something I would make again when I have chicken and minimal ingredients in the house.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make! I added 1 cup of mayo to the breading mixture. Combining that with the breadcrumbs did make the mixture pretty thick and a little harder to put on the breasts but  was worth it. I will definitely make it again.

Loved this recipe! Made it for my dad and Aunt for a quick family dinner. I made as is except I only had 3 full chicken breasts instead of 6 halves. I just baked it longer. I got many compliments!

These came out great! The only changes I made were using half and half on breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese and I Heated up oil with a garlic powder with seasoning (I didn't have cloves of garlic) This way the oil really infused with the garlic flavor. Let it cool and then continued with recipe. HUsband was a little put off  by the fact that I didn't lightly fry them before I put them in the oven, but he loved how they turned out! Made them with homemade mac and cheese.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! Some notes: I salted and peppered my chicken breasts and marinated them in chopped garlic and olive oil for a couple hours prior. Then, I let the breasts get back up to room temperature before breading them with the breadcrumb mixture. I added some panko bread crumb to mine to add extra crunch. I baked the breasts on a pan with a rack because I was worried they would be soggy in a dish. They turned out amazing!!! I also recommend pounding the chicken breasts flat before cooking so they don't take as long. Our air chilled chicken breasts from H-E-B were huge so they took the full 40 mins. Definitely would make this again!

Made a single chicken breast in toaster oven. Used garlic olive oil and cooked for 20 minutes. Really liked it but I would have liked the coating to brown. Next time will cook in regular oven to see if that makes a difference. I like garlic; be prepared - it can be a strong garlic flavor.

This was super easy, but also super yummy. It was a big hit with everyone in the family. Chicken came out juicy and full of flavor from the garlic and parmesan. We paired it with spaghetti.

I loved this recipe - so easy to make! I read the helpful reviews before making it so I ended up adding salt and an extra clove of garlic to the recipe. I am gluten free so used rice 'bread' crumbs instead. It took 45 minutes for it to bake, however it was sharing the oven with other dishes. Will make again!

Only thing different was since it wasn't browned like the picture so I cooked 10 minutes longer. Still only one breast was tender enough.  I didn't think it had enough favor either, even my 12 grandson asked if it was just suppose to only taste like garlic.

I combine this recipe with The Best Parmesan Chicken Bake.  The result is delicious. I marinate the chicken in Italian dressing and refrigerate for a couple hours ahead of time. Bake for 35 minutes.

This recepie is not good at all! I'm giving 3 stars, because the chicken was OK, but the instructions... Oh my. I had to cook it for an hour, the breadcrumbs got sticky and lumpy, the cheese didn't melt and became crusty (I used the real parmesan, I should have added it at the end). I would give this recepie ONE STAR, but the dinner deserves three, so there you go.

its a great base for a recipe, although the breading has quite a bit of trouble staying on when its being moved, and also leaves a lot of oil in the mouth when eating it fresh. other than that, great flavor

My family loved this chicken recipe. Even my extremely picky kids. I thought the chicken was a bit bland, but since the family was so happy, maybe it was just me.
I had very large chicken breasts so I had to use more of the olive oil / garlic mixture. I used a three cheese blend for the coating , instead of just plain Parmesan. I also added some salt. 
Since the chicken breasts were so large, the were in the over for about 45 minutes instead of 30.

This was pretty darn tasty and super easy! This would pair beautifully with marinara and pasta, which we'll do next go around! The bottom of the chicken breasts came out a little soggy so next time I'll use panko as suggested and flip the breasts half way through baking. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great flavor, easy to make however couple of issues to figure out. First as others have said the bottom ends up soggy, juices from the chicken make sure of that, then the top wasn't as crispy as I would of hoped. Next time I'm thinking maybe of leaving the bottom of the breast un coated and hitting the top with the broiler right before taking from the oven.

Ive used this recipe over and over again. It works for breasts or tenders. I just reduce the cooking time to 15-20 minutes. The first time I cut the basil in half cuz I'm not a fan but you really need the full amount. It's not over powering. My family loves it

These were very juicy and flavorful. Served with wild rice first night . Served leftovers by   heating them up and added mozzarella cheese.  Added to the top of a big plate of spagetthi and covered with home made Marsala sauce. YUM!

I didn't take a picture I followed the recipe except when it was done baking I topped the chicken with garden style spaghetti sauce and 1 slice of provolone cheese. I served it with a dinner salad. I will definitely make this again. Yummy!!!!

We love this dish and like the recipe says it's quick and easy to make. I do pound the chicken breasts though so they cook more evenly and I keep a close eye on them towards the end of cooking time to make sure they don't dry out.

i think i'd leave it to chill after putting the breadcrumb and cheese mix on it so they stick to the chicken a bit more, but a delicious recipe, i will definitely make it again. My dad loved it so much i shared the link for the recipe with my syep mum.

I left out the Basil leaves and pounded out the chicken breasts till they were all an even thickness. I have occasionally used Chicken tenders too.. and only baked for twenty minutes. The Chicken comes out tender , Judy and delicious ! I make this once a week now! Thank you for this quick easy and delicious recipe!

This was good not great! I had to keep it in the oven longer as the breadcrumbs  took a while to get brown and crispy. The chicken was moist and hubby liked it,  but it was a little too bland for me.

Very tasty dish... I made this tonight for my wife and myself, along with some mashed cauliflower & carrot sticks. The only changes I made to the original recipe were in quantities. As I was preparing dinner for only two people, I used an 8"x8" pyrex pan for 2 boneless chicken breasts. I also reduced the ingredients for the breading mixture... time in oven was the same, 30 minutes @ 350 degrees. The chicken was cooked through and still very moist. Super pleased with how the dish turned out, we will surely be having this again.

Super moist and delicious!  I pounded the chicken breasts a little so it would be more like a cutlet and then  had to add more olive oil & garlic and bread crumbs & cheese to coat all of the chicken.  It was easy and my family loved it!

Followed the recipe and it was very good. Use a good quality parmesan cheese  for better flavor. I bet this would be good on fish fillets too. I did have to add a little salt on the chicken.

I made changes, I used Ranch salad dressing instead of the oil mixture.  It was great.  I have been making this recipe with my change for years.

Good and Easy!  I followed the recipe fairly closely only making a few changes based on the other reviews.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before dipping it in the garlic mixture.  I also added some Italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture.  After it was done baking, I topped the chicken with sauce, sliced mozzarella and a little fresh chopped basil in top then baked it for about 5 more minutes.  Only thing- next time I will cut the bread crumb mixture in half.

Recipe said to use the remainder breadcrumb mixture.  I did and that made  the dish dry.  I will make again and use less of the breadcrumb mixtures.  I was very good.

As written, it doesn't have a lot of flavor.  I added a bit more garlic and Italian seasoning and it still needed a little something more.  It also took 50 minutes to cook - not 30.

Delicious and easy...I cheered it up just a bit by adding about 1/4 tsp of ground red pepper and a tiny bit of chili flakes to the bread crumb mixture which gave it a little zing.  I also had some flaked almonds on hand and threw about a tablespoon of those into the bread crumb mix...

I took the advice of others and added more garlic as well as some oregano/salt to the bread crumb mixture. I had high hopes after reading all of the raving reviews but, sadly... this recipe didn't wow me. I loved how easy it was with very little clean up but, I would rate this as average.

I made it just as the recipe said.  It was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely make this again.  I needed less bread crumb mixture, and more of the olive oil.  Also, I used the jar of minced garlic.  I tried to get some of the juice, and I think it help infuse it into the chicken.  YUM!

Excellent!  Very easy to prepare.  I used extra garlic, boneless chicken thighs, and Panko bread crumbs.  I also added some salt.  This was very tender and juicy, and went great with some garlic/arugula pasta and a fresh salad!

I really love this recipe, have made it a few times now. 
Need more dipping oil than the 2 tablespoons noted, and i usually end up with way too much bread crumb mix so lessen that a little. 
I cook slightly hotter than recommended in the recipe to get the coating more crispy otherwise it can be quite soggy.

This is an easy and good recipe.  We did use peppridge farm stuffing instead of bread crumbs but otherwise followed the recipe.  It needs a bit more breading to stay on the chicken to make it more flavorful but overall it's good we will have it again.

Very easy recipe to follow and it was delicious.  The hardest part is chopping the herbs.  I made it twice in one week. The 2nd time I added more or the butter and breading mix to the dish while it baked to have gravy for our rice.  My husband and I loved it!!! I will definitely be making it again!!

I used all of the ingredients except the breadcrumbs and I pretty much just eyeballed them.  I mixed them all together, then dipped pieces of chicken breast in them.  Baked at 375 for 20 minutes.  Then turned oven to broil and added chicken to sliced rolls on a cookie sheet, covered with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese and broiled for 5 minutes.  Delicious baked chicken parm sandwiches!

This recipe was great. I didn't have quite enough parmesan on hand, but it still turned out really well. We used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs because they were cheaper. (Panko crumbs are tougher so that may also help with the sogginess other reviewers talked about.) We paired it with cheese tortellini, spaghetti sauce, and a side of broccoli. We also made extra breaded chicken and froze them individually, which has been really convenient. My husband loves this recipe so we'll definitely make it again!

The chicken that this recipe makes is a little bit bland, to be very honest with you, as I have made it without revisions once. That being said, I'd highly recommend beginning with these ingredients as a base, adding garlic powder or garlic salt (depending on how salty you'd like your chicken), dried minced onions, and substituting Italian herb bread crumbs instead of the normal ones. This makes for more flavorful chicken. Hope it helps!

I stuck to the recipe and it was very good.  Super easy to make.

I also added marinara and mozzarella to the top of two of the chicken breasts and that was a very pleasant addition as well!

Excellent recipe. I cooked the dinner around the requirements of this recipe reduced for 2 breasts (i.e., reduced chicken coating amt proportionally). I set the oven to 400 then put 2 baker potatoes in for 10 mins. I then reduced the temp to 350 and put two breasts in an oiled casserole in for 40 mins. I then put 2 servings of asparagus spears, oiled, peppered and seasoned with garlic salt, around the breasts, then put everything back in for 12 mins. Everything came out done perfectly for my wife and me.

I made this for my family, with two minor changes. Instead of whole chicken breasts, I cut them up into chunks and used croutons I put in my Blendtec and blended them. SO MUCH FLAVOR!!!  and made rice  and corn with it. It was a hit. My wife works nights so I made this on a night she was home and about a week later she asked for it again!

I was looking for a simple chicken recipe this evening and came across this. This is a very simple and delicious dish that you can dress up or down with your side dishes.  You could even serve with chicken gravy.  We had flavored rice and green beans to complete a simple weeknight meal.  Overall I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, although I didn't use pink

Awesome! I  can't remember if it says to use fresh garlic, but I used a zester and grated fresh garlic into the oil, I also used fresh Parmesan and had some in the sheet to make some crisps. I paired it with mushroom risotto, my husband loved it. I'll definitely make it again.

Very very good!  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly.  The only difference for me was a longer cooking time.  After the 30 minutes, it didn't look done to me so I added another 10 minutes and watched for the juice to run, which it did.  It was perfectly tender and juicy!  We all know different ovens behave differently, so just be mindful and make sure it's done before you pull it out.

I made this for my husband and 7 year old son and they LOVED it - you know it's good when they ask for more. The chicken came out moist, flavorful and the bread crumbs added an extra texture. I made a few tweaks given the review feedback - I used 4 tspn olive oil, 2 minced garlic, salt and pepper and also seasoned the chicken with a seasoning salt. For the crumb, I mixed Italian seasoning bread crumbs with panko Japanese style bread crumbs. It came out so delicious we've decided to make it for dinner with risotto this weekend with some guests. Thanks for the great and oh-so easy recipe.

I followed a few of the other reviewers tips: 1) pounded the chicken breasts so they were even thickness (mine were pretty big so they needed to be flattened to cook more evenly).  2) used fresh Parmesan. 3) added grated mozzarella at the end and broiled a couple of minutes - would still have been good without this step added, in my opinion.   I cooked at 350 for about 20 minutes and upped it to 375 for another 10 minutes, broiled for 5 w/the added cheese, and it came out beautifully moist and delicious.

I have to say, my hubby and son both loved it.  My 13yr old typically turns his nose up to chicken, but this time, he went back for seconds, and even told me he wanted leftovers the next day.  That is saying a lot coming from him!

Made exactly as written, with a side of couscous & broccoli.  The chicken breasts that I had were pretty thick, so I had to add another 10-15 min to the cook time.  Simple, tasty, basic chicken dinner.

It was okay. Barely enough olive oil for even four chicken breasts, was bland, and the recipe called for way too many breadcrumbs so the rest is thrown away.

This recipe is great for those who prefer non-spicy dishes.  But for those who prefer any spice at all, this recipe as-is tastes rather bland.

I suggest at least a dash of salt, but more pepper would also be good.

Made this for the station meal on my cook night and it was very easy. Next time I'll use more olive oil for the breading. It did take every bit of 40 minutes at 350 to be done, once it was it was juicy as all get out

I followed the directions exactly, the breasts were large so at 30 min. they were not close to being done.  I turned up the temp to 450 for another 15 min. They were great, very jucy and tender.  The dish needs a little something extra so I added some cranberry sauce and that worked.

Followed the recipe exactly except substituted panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs since that's all I had in my pantry.  Was yummy. Would make again.

Way too much bread crumbs and parm cheese. I would cut in half. You can always add more but once that chicken is dipped then in the trash the extra goes.

I always follow recipes to a T for the first time.  This recipe was fantastic with lots of flavour.  I allowed the chicken to marinade in the olive oil/garlic mix for a while (to absorb the garlic flavour).  The best parmesan to use is the REAL parmesan, not the commercial, flavourless kind, not naming any brands.  I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing! The first time I tried this recipe I followed it to the tee and couldn't get enough. The times since I made it I tweaked a couple things and it was still amazing. I now use Italian breadcrumbs, fresh minced garlic instead of store bought minced, and depending on the day I add a teaspoon or so of cayenne pepper or Italian seasoning, or whatever flavor spice I want that night. I also started to used boneless, skinless, chicken tenders instead of breasts so I have more chicken and for leftovers they work great in wraps/subs/or pasta. This is a have to try recipe for sure!!!!!!

I will make this again.  I adjusted the ingredients for just two people.  This was very easy to do.  I didn't add or subtract anything.  I did drizzle a bit of olive oil on top of the chicken before baking.

The chicken stays very juicy and tender.  I used Panko crumbs and also added a little onion.  The onion added a little pop to the flavor.  This is a go to chicken recipe for me!

It was very good, except I think I will take it out of the oven about five minutes sooner next time because it was just a little drier than I'd like.

I have made many versions of this recipe before that were very delicious but typically involved copious amounts of butter. This version replaces the butter with olive oil, which I was skeptical about, and the results are amazing! This chicken could not have been more moist and delicious!!! I did add a bit more olive oil and then scraped the remaining oil and garlic into the pan and added the rest of the bread crumb mixture on top of the chicken before baking. 30 minutes was right on the nose and it was just perfect!

I made the recipe as directed and I have no idea how others would have had their chicken bake the crumbs thoroughly. I had to fry the chicken when it came out if the oven to finish the breading.

I made a few changes. I used panko instead of bread crumbs and added hot pepper flakes and oregano to the panko. As suggested I turned t chicken half way through and cooked at 375 for 30 minutes. Very moist and juicy. I served with pasta and topped the chicken and pasta with shredded mozzarella. Will make again !

Absolutely delicious!!  Changed it up a bit thanks to some previously posted suggestions.  Easy clean-up when you put the chicken, olive oil (6 tbsp) and garlic (2 1/2 tsp) in a sealable bag - then put it in the breadcrumb mixture.  Used whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs and freshly grated Parmesan.  Baked 8 chicken breasts at 375 degrees for 40 minutes and they came out juicy and quite tasty.  Easy and quick recipe!  A must have in my recipe box now!

I just made this and am going to have to quickly jump on the the unfortunate 'modification' reviews -although mine is really not huge at all -I used cooked thai curry quinoa to coat instead of breadcrumbs since that was all I had. Otherwise came out pretty nice :)

Made the recipe exactly as written and it was just OK for us. Wait...I did use italian seasoned bread crumbs (gluten free) since I didn't have plain on hand. The ratio of oil to garlic for dipping the chicken breasts in was not enough. Scaled the recipe to 3 breasts and if I were to make this again, I would double the oil and garlic cloves and add salt and pepper to the chicken breasts or bread crumbs. Otherwise, this seemed more on the bland side (chicken coated in only bread crumbs) and very well could be due to gluten free bread crumbs--thankful they were italian seasoned and not plain. Regular (non gluten free) bread crumbs probably contain a lot of extra ingredients, such as salt or msg. Sorry, but this just wasn't for us in comparison to other similar recipes.

It was flat and very little flavor or texture. I expected more garlic/parmesan taste: did not get it. Furthermore, while the picture shows crispy, it is not! should have known better: baked chicken is not crispy chicken. This not a keeper for me.

Wow! Loved the fact that this was easy and made with pantry ingredients. I used panko crumbs which which gave it a  nice subtle crunch. Crumbs adhered nicely to the chicken. Could probably cut back a bit on the bread crumb/Parmesan mixture as I had a lot left over.  I sprinkled some of the residual bread crumb Parmesan mixture over the chicken but not all of it. Will definitely keep this recipe in the rotation. Good enough for company. Very flavorful.

I will def make this again.  I t was really good.  The only thing I might do diff is use egg to dip chicken in, instead of oil.  It was excellent with a side of spaghetti and was great on a sandwich.

Great starting point of a recipe.  Like others, I made some adjustments - adding Stovetop Chicken Stuffing to the breadcrumbs adds a lot to the taste.  Using more olive oil helps binding everything to the chicken breasts.

Six chicken breasts cooked in a oven-dish took 60mins to cook through.  The chicken was still moist and very tasty. 

Passed the "kid test" with flying colours!

The only change I made was that I used powdered garlic instead of minced and still turned out great! Quick, easy and flavourful!

Absolutely delicious!!!! I paired it with spaghetti, marinara sauce, mozzarella and broccoli on the side. So moist and flavorful. Definitely a family fave!

I cooked it almost exactly as directed. I just added a little bit more of a garlic oil coating before I breaded the chicken. I can't say anything else other then it was a perfect dish.

One of the first things I've ever cooked. It was easy to make and turned out pretty good. Ended up with a LOT of extra bread crumbs and made the mistake of putting extra on top of the chicken. The stuff on top crisped up nicely but it all fell off. Should've not added any extra so the stuff stuck to the chicken actually got crispy. Tasted great though.

3 stars as stated in the recipe, 4 stars if you marinate the chicken overnight in Italian salad dressing first and use seasoned panko instead.

I can't wait to make this again. Super-super-easy and quick. My husband loved it as well.

To my point...I took the one reviewer up on her suggestion and used the seasoned panko bread crumbs that I had on hand. I had no Parmesan, but did have grated Pecorino Romano. Unfortunately, I *totally* forgot to mix it with the crumbs before putting the chicken in the oven - so about halfway through the cooking time (when I remembered that), I sprinkled the PR on top of each piece. 

I don't do white meat (blah!), so used boneless, skinless chicken thighs - so nice and flavorful. I also was - don't ask me how - out of basil, so threw some poultry seasoning, salt and pepper in with the bread crumbs.

The chicken came out cooked perfectly and *so* good. 

NEXT TIME....I want to try the one reviewer's suggestion about using Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing mix instead of the bread crumbs. I will also try the other suggestion about baking it on a cooling rack and turning it halfway through to keep the breading crispy. But I will *definitely* make it again...

Finally, I agree with the negative reviewer's comment that the recommended amount of olive oil isn't close to enough. So use more!

This recipe itself is pretty. Took longer than 30 mins to bake.  Doesn't really have much of a flavor and textured weird. Definitely needs some revisions. Nothing to make again.

I'm not one for altering a recipe before I try it but my bread crumbs were old so I crushed up some club crackers to use instead. I doubled the oil and garlic as some readers suggested and it was just enough for 4 chicken breasts. I made a mistake and added the basil and pepper to the oil and garlic but it still tasted great and was very moist.

My husband and I loved this!  I had it the way recipe was written.  Husband is on low carb diet, so we used panko instead of bread crumbs for his.  He loved it!  We each tried both ways, I loved as written best, but the panko was very tasty.  He loved the panko but didn't care as much for the recipe as written.  We will definitely make again!

I made this using panko instead of bread crumbs, adding in salt and more herbs.  Hubby and son liked it.  I thought it still needed a bit more.  Perhaps next time I'll use shredded parmesan so that it will melt.  I used up all of the crumb mixture by pushing the mixture onto both sides.  A bit of mozzarella melted on top would be good.

A little bland as it is. It is rather basic. 
added some paprika and I used thinly chopped fresh basil Instead of dried , marinated on olive oil and garlic and basil for about 20 min. Baked as suggested. I sliced the chicken breast thinly so it cooked well. Placed on top of pasta with marinara and broccoli on the side. Wasn't bad. So gave it a 3.

Some of the most moist chicken I've ever had!  after baking as directed, I did turn on low broil for just 2 or 3 minutes to get an extra crispy exterior.  The chicken was literally fork tender and could have been cenjoyed without a knife at all. I will add some garlic powder to the breading next time (.5 tsp to start)  as the garlic flavor did not come through much at all.

Really turned out great. Getting tired of my old Chicken Parm recipe so tried this one. Had to substitute Italian Seasoning for the basil but still turned out wonderful. I also used organic chicken tenders and whole wheat bread for the bread crumbs. Very moist and tender - could actually cut the chicken with a fork. I offered a dill dipping sauce alongside which added a bit of flavor. Will make this again for sure.

I didn't like this when I followed the directions as is.  I should have known when the directions stated to first dip in olive oil instead of egg prior to coating with breadcrumbs.  Mushy coating and under-seasoned after baking in oven, and probably a lot less healthy because of the oil content.

I made it as written and my whole family loved it.  I made it with a side of farfalle with Alfredo sauce.   A really nice change from the ordinary weekly meals.  And super easy!!

I made this for my family and my parents. It was really good. I did get a lititle thicker chicken so it had to be cooked a little longer but it was really delicious. I should have put more cheese on it and more maybe more seasonings only because the chicken was thicker.

Delicious, juicy chicken. My only complaint was that it wasn't actually very breaded. Most of the bread crumbs were excess and just sitting on top

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was a hit! Very flavorful and just the right amount of garlic. I also made a garlic parm rice that I found on here which complimented it nicely. I don't think it needs any alterations.

Next time, I would add more seasoning and spices to the bread crumb mix. It was a little too bland for me. I like the crunch from the crust. Nice texture.

The chicken turned out moist.  Unfortunately, it was so moist that it was soggy.  The bread crumb mixture topping was not crunchy.  The chicken was swimming in oil/liquid.  I drained this liquid 2/3rds through the cooking time which helped.  The chicken I used was fresh chicken bought this morning.  The family still prefers commercial coating mix than this recipe.

No I just lessened the amount of bread crumbs, olive oil and parmesian cheese since I only cooked two chicken breasts. My husband loved it and he is very picky

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because I can't stand white meat. I took the advice of a couple of other reviewers and (1) used seasoned panko instead of bread crumbs, (2) added a little melted butter to the olive oil, (3) used a little more garlic, (4) baked it on a cooling rack so the chicken wouldn't cook in its own juices and get the breading soggy and (5) baked it at 375 for 30 minutes. The only thing I wouldn't do again is doubling the garlic; it came out a little too strong (and I like garlic). Other than that, it was a very nice recipe and the chicken came out incredibly moist.

First off didn't have enough bread crumbs but it covered well with the cheese then added thyme instead of the basil then out of the oven added lemon juice, turned out great and juicy :)

This was really yummy and easy to make. I used olive oil with garlic instead of doing it separately and it worked perfectly. Def will use tin foil next time though coz the chicken was a wee bit dry. So yummy though!

Made as directed.  It was good.  Moist and flavorful.  One issue was it did not get crispy on outside.  Maybe a quick 500deg broil would work in last 5 minutes of cooking.

Absolutely loved this.  I used Stove Top Chicken Flavor for the breading.  I crushed it a little in a plastic bag, added garlic powder, and basil and shook the chicken in the bag to coat.  I rubbed the chicken with garlic oil before putting in the bag.  Next time I may use a combination of melted butter and garlic oil.  I sprinkled all of the leftover crumbs on the top and it came out crunch and delicious.  Some of the best chicken I ever ate.  I did use a little extra parmesan.  I used the canned Parmesan.

This was an easy and delicious recipe! Followed almost exactly. I added butter to the olive oil dip as recommended by another reviewer and added crushed fresh garlic and microwaved for 30 seconds to infuse flavor. I also double battered (oil then bread crumbs and repeat). This is a keeper for sure! Served with a side of garlic Parmesan Brussels sprouts.

Very, very tasty! The cooking temp/time was perfect (always my biggest concern when cooking new dishes), and the chicken was wonderfully moist. I didn't have quite as big a problem with soggy breading as some people seem to have had. 

I will say this: This dish needs WAAAAAAY more garlic to use that word in the recipe title! I only made two servings, but knowing my personal taste I used the whole clove and topped the breasts with the leftover garlic/oil mix. I can't imagine how little garlic flavor there would be if I had made the full six servings! But hey, I'm a garlic lover, so I'm biased.

We liked this quite a bit. We did not have and don't care for dried basil so I used dried oregano instead.

Delicious! Kids and hubby couldn't get enough. Perfect just as is, however I did double the olive oil and garlic so I'd have enough for all the chicken. The only suggestion from my husband was that the breading could have been crunchier. I might pan fry it for a few minutes before I throw it in the oven next time I make it.

Really good and easy to make. Didn't burn the chicken crust if it's the right size and was cooked through and through.

With modifications for flavor, my husband and I thought this dish was very good!  I substituted Pepperidge Farm Herb Stuffing for the plain breadcrumbs and added 1 teaspoon oregano in addition to the basil leaves.  Used 4 tablespoons olive oil and 2 cloves of garlic.  I sprinkled salt and pepper on chicken breasts prior to coatings.  Also sprinkled garlic powder on top of dish before placing in oven.  I did bake at 350 F for 40-45 minutes.  Chicken was very moist.  Will make again!

A crowd pleaser, easy to make and delicious!
I had found another recipe that is just about the same as this one but uses melted butter rather than olive oil, so between that recipe in my memory and this one here,  it is a fabulously moist, and flavorful dish. I use herb seasoned bread crumbs,  or panko, lots of minced garlic, fresh parmesan cheese a must, and the butter, while decadent, really makes it mouth watering.

This was a very flavorful baked chicken breast.  I wish there was a little more crunch to the chicken.  I think  next time I will brown in a skillet and then bake.

Yummy! I had some really big chicken breasts, so I flattened them out with one of those tenderizer hammer thingys so they would cook more evenly. Turned out great!

I made no adjustments to this recipe except that I cut my chicken breasts in 2.  This was absolutely the best chicken parmesan I have ever had. It was crispy and deliciously tasty!  The only thing I would say is that my chicken took 45 minutes to cook even though it was cut in half but this might just be my oven.

I liked it but  As I was eating it there was a few things I noticed at times it was a little tasteless and at others the Parmesan Cheese had a taste that was too powerful so it kinda tasted like my husband and I were eating Parmesan cheese straight. By the end of the meal I had a few notes on how to make it better according to our taste because everyone has a different taste when it comes to food. I liked the recipe thought it was a good one.

For the amount of chicken breast I used, I only doubled the oil mixture; everything else was as the recipe noted.  The chicken was tender and delicious! Yes, I will definitely be using this again.

I followed the directions exactly, but I felt like I needed more flavor. So after the chicken was placed in the pan, ready to be baked, I sprinkled extra herb on top. I'm glad I did because it would have been pretty flavor-less otherwise.

Overall it was pretty good. It was not my favorite but good enough to make again.

Made pretty much as written, though I will say I had a lot of leftover bread crumbs, so I could have made due with fewer. I used 1 tsp olive oil for 4 half breasts - the trick is to drizzle it on top of them and then rub it over afterwards so it's an even, thin coat.

Overall, the chicken was very moist, but it was too salty.  I salted each breast before dipping in the oil as one reviewer suggested and I wish I'd skipped that step.  The parmesan adds a salty flavor so the additional salt wasn't necessary.  I probably won't make it again - something was a little off.

I read some reviews and chose the mayo rather than oil route........I can make parmesan chicken from scratch the old fashioned way but wanted to try a baked version to be healthier.

It is a disaster for my first attempt, the breadcrumbs are either soggy and not crisping up or they are crisping and sticking really bad, then when I try and turn the chicken over the breading pulls off....  :o(

Awesome recipe!  Not only easy, yet yummy. Made it a week ago with boneless chicken breasts & making it again right now, with chicken strips/Tenders, baking it at 350 for 20 min.  Followed the recipe exactly, with only 2 changes; doubled the oil & garlic amounts, since it wasn't enough to coat the pieces & used Tuscan seasoning instead of basil.  Karen thank you so much for sharing your recipe, this is a keeper in my recipe box.

I wanted to prepare chicken cutlets in a different way than pan-frying, so I looked up recipes and came across this one.  I made it and enjoyed it.  The next day, I sliced up the leftover chicken and placed in on top of salad.  Delicious!

I don't usually write reviews, but this was so easy and good that  I had to share. I followed this recipe exactly as it is with 2 exceptions. I used a little more than 2 tbsp of evoo and used more than just 1 clove of garlic. The key to this recipe is to bake it on a cooling rack set on top of a cookie sheet to catch the crumbs and extra oil. Turn them halfway and they will be crispy and not get soggy on the bottom. I also used organic chicken breasts. I've never made chicken that literally melted in my mouth! It was delicious!

This is an okay recipe, but I doubt I'll make this again. The flavor is okay, but nothing special (a bit on the bland side). It took almost an hour for the chicken to cook, so I think the projected baking time is off. I followed the recipe exactly as it's listed.

Followed the recipe exactly, but the breading didn't want to stick to the chicken. It was still quite tasty but all of the breading was just falling off. Seems like it needs egg added to get the breading to stick to the chicken.

This was fantastic!  I followed the advice to place the chopped garlic in some olive oil in the baking dish.  Place it in a low oven for about 10 minutes  to soften the garlic and flavor the olive oil.  Then simply roll the chicken breasts in the garlic oil, coat with the Panko crumb/cheese mixture, and return to the pan to bake. I did use fresh Italian four cheese blend with the Italian Panko crumbs.  I baked at 375 degrees for about 25-30 minutes.  The chicken was very moist and tasted great.

It turned out great.  I took the advise of the other reviewers and added 1 teaspoon of oregano, and also salted the chicken.  I used 4 teaspoons olive oil.  I found it took more like 40 minutes to bake.  I'll definitely make it again!

This chicken was so moist!  I didn't have as many chicken breasts as called for in the recipe, but I used close to the same amount of everything else (I reduced the amount of bread crumbs, and added another clove of garlic).  I had just enough olive oil to cover the chicken I had, so I think that if you are using the amount of chicken called for in the recipe, it might be a good idea to increase the amount of oil, as another reviewer had suggested.
Just a heads-up, by adding that extra clove of garlic, I overpowered the dish with garlicky-goodness.  After adding the garlic to the oil, I'd let it sit there for a bit while taking a phone call.  I didn't think that would make it too strong, but I was wrong (think vampire-repellant).  So even though I thought this chicken was great, it ended up being a bit too garlicky for my garlic-loving family.  My 8yo said it was 'too spicy'. 
I'm definitely going to make this dish again, just with less garlic...  :)  Thank you for this recipe!

I enjoyed this recipe, the chicken came out very moist and was tasty.  Followed recipe exactly and added 1 tsp onion powder and 1 tsp garlic powder to bread crumb mixture.  Also used Italian flavored bread crumbs and extra olive oil as 2 tbsp was not enough to dip all the breasts in.

I added some montreal chicken seasoning and it came out great. Unfortunately the bottom was soggy, so I will have to adjust that and maybe cook on a cooling rack as one person mentioned (smart idea, btw). Paired with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans and it was great. Will be making it again.

I added melted butter to the olive oil (about equal amounts), and I used a food processor to blend that with the garlic.  I used slighly more oil and garlic than was recommended to boost the flavor a little and to have a little more oil to work with when I was breading the chicken. 
-I used Panko bread crumbs and FRESH parmesan. 
-I pounded the breasts to ensure even cooking (I cooked them at 375 degrees for 30 minutes).
-Once they were done, I put a little tomato pesto on top of each one and covered that with slices of mozza cheese. I then put the pan under a hot broiler for a minute. 

THESE WERE DELICIOUS  I served them with Orzo pasta and Parmesan asparagus.  YUM!

I made this chicken today it was really good. I did it a little different instead of taking the chicken and dipping it in the oil I took the chicken breast in a bowl and added oil and garlic and mixed it up. I used a little bit more garlic. I also mixed panko and breadcrumbs together. I baked it on a baking rack and it came out great.

We like crispier skin. The timing didn't crisp it enough for us. I had to use crackers, so that probably is why it didn't crisp up. I also noticed there was a light blood on the plate, so would have to cook about 20 minutes longer

I don't like preparing food with chicken breast, cause didn't find the taste somewhat goes missing and end up eating just meat... plain white meat.  
This was amazing!! I read many reviews (at least 30) before i decided to make it.  
Prepared it as it said, and I add bit of salt to the olive oil along with some black pepper for more taste.  Follow the recipe and came out soooooooo gOOOOD!!  Would I make it again... oh yes!!!  Thanks for sharing it.

I only made a few changes after reading other reviews. I added butter (equal amt) to the olive oil and some oregano. Just before I popped into the oven I sprinkled a little dry Italian dressing seasoning on top.  Turned out real most and tasty.

Everyone loved this.  Perfect, flavorful, and moist.  I was out of bread crumbs, so my only substitution was crushed Ritz crackers.  I found it took at least triple the olive oil and garlic, but my pieces were large and I cut them into tenders, thus creating more area to cover.

Turned out great, you can substitute Italian Seasoning for the basil if you haven't got it on hand. Definitely works better if you butterfly the chicken breasts, rather than toss them in whole.

I made this. Very good. A different way of doing chicken. Am from the South Mississippi so am use to deep fried chiken. I used bread crumb (italian and garlic herbs). I also seasoned the meat. I used zesty itaial salad dressing to dip it in. We love flavor in my house. My Mom tried it. She said it is awesome.  Will make again.

I really enjoyed it. I am not a strong enough cook to change things in recipes much. The only thing I did different was use the Garlic and Herb bread crumbs. It had a good flavor and was not too dry. Also it was simple for me since I tend to be cooking challenged.

The breadcrumbs did not brown and he breading was very dry and unpleasant. 
----edit--- Wow, what? Someone edited my review without my knowledge. I keep copies so I know what I originally wrote.  Here is my REAL review.......
 I was intrigued by the breading method; a dip in oil then only dry breading? Didn't work for me at all. The breadcrumbs did not brown, I pulled them from oven and spritzed with some olive oil and that started to brown them, but by then they were almost done and I didn't want the chicken to overcook.  The breading was very dry and unpleasant to eat.  Also could not taste the garlic at all. I won't be revisiting this recipe.

Love this recipe! Super easy to make. I did up the seasoning a bit since I saw that some of the reviews claimed it was bland. I used twice the amount of garlic and an Italian seasoning blend in addition to basil (a teaspoon of each) and salted and peppered the chicken breasts before coating them in the garlic/oil mixture. I paired it with green beans and garlic bread for a delicious dinner. I'll definitely be making this again!

Followed the directions to a T. It was okay, I found the breading got way to soggy during the process. It had a good flavor but the sogginess ruined the experience.

I made this last night for the first time. I followed the recipe as written. I wouldn't change a thing, my wife and I thought it was very good. I let the minced garlic sit in the olive oil for about 30 minutes so the oil would pick up the flavor of the garlic, turned out great. I did 2 chicken breasts but used the same amount of ingredients, they turned out juicy and tender with a very good flavor. It is a keeper, will definitely make again

Yummy!  I had thighs so used those instead of breasts.  We don't eat bread so instead of breadcrumbs I used almond meal.  I added a couple of tablespoons grass fed cattle butter along with the olive oil.  I added about 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning to the dry ingredients.  This was so good and so easy.  Served with green beans seasoned with Italian seasoning and butter.

I ACTUALLY MADE IT ACCORDING TO THE RECIPE! It was ok. Breading was grainy and not crispy. Next time would coat with egg white before coating in crumbs, and put a thin layer of oil in the casserole dish to fry it and crisp it up a bit. Maybe the panko bread crumbs. But as-is, only passable. Served it with melted mozzarella on too and homemade spaghetti sauce over angel hair pasta with a salad

Just made this... I made it exactly how the recipe said except had to cook a little longer due to the size of the breasts. Turned out great! Might tweak alittle bit next time ... I feel it's important when trying a new recipe not to alter it until you give it a fair shot.

I made this lastnight. I went right by the recipe. It was delicious. I did have to cook the chicken longer than the 30 mins bc my chicken breast was slightly bigger. This is something I will be eating again. Great Recipe!!!

It was good.. It was pretty easy to make none the less. The oven baking just doesnt crisp it up enough for me.

I cut the recipe in half and followed the directions fairly closely. The bread crumbs weren't crunch enough and didn't have much flavor.

I read many of the reviews before I made this.   They really helped to make this a winning recipe that I made for a luncheon today.  I didn't have Panko bread crumbs so I rolled out garlic croutons, and that worked fine.  I marinated the chicken overnight in Italian salad dressing, with a generous portion of pressed garlic mixed in.  I used parsley, basil and oregano in the bread crumbs.  I put the bread crumbs in a bag and shook a few pieces of meat at a time to coat - so easy.  And very important, I cooked the meat on a cooling rack in a roasting pan.  Extra crumbs I used over the chicken and the rest I froze.   It was a hit.   The crust was crisp, the chicken moist, and it was FULL of flavor.  So marinate the meat, and be sure to use a cooling rack so the crust doesn't get soggy.   I put some mozarella on top after the chicken was done and let it melt in the oven for a short time.  Everyone, including my husband, loved it.

Towards the end of baking I drizzled olive oil over the chicken and continued baking longer. The olive oil drizzle created a crispier breading.

Definitely will make again.  Had to do substitutions based on what was on hand at home. - panko crumbs vs. regular crumbs and a couple thyme sprigs instead of basil.   I was also making roasted potatoes - so chicken was baked at 425 for 25 minutes and still turned out great.

Excellent dish. Not too heavy on the stomach like many fried chicken dishes. Not too salty or peppery. I would recommend being conservative on the usage of the excess bread crumb mixture before baking. We had more than an abundance of bread crumbs on our chicken tenders. Otherwise, the dish was simple, delicious, and memorable.

I made this with chicken tenders in order to divide more easily amongst kids without wasting. I used Italian bread crumbs and a little extra garlic, cut the cook time back to about 20 minutes, and they were absolutely perfect. We eat chicken often and this is the only recipe the kids have begged me to repeat. A definite favorite!

Very good, made exactly as specified.  Did need to cook the chicken longer and definitely needs salt.  Next time I will add salt to the dry ingredients and probably cook it at 375 for 30-35 minutes.  Served with garlic butter rice and sautéed zucchini and yellow squash for a yummy meal.

This dish was outstanding, a huge hit with the entire family...kids included!  Was so easy to prep & only change that I made was adding a packet of Lipton Dry French Onion which made it crunchy/textured. I removed tin foil the last ten minutes so it wasn't soggy. Made with a side of whole white potatoes cooked in olive oil, butter, salt, pepper, paprika & minced garlic. I have a large family to cook for & have Lupus so it's difficult to make dinners that take along time to prep so this was perfect it fed everyone, only took 10 minutes to prep & 30 min. In the oven. Definetly a favorite & a goto recipe on nights I'm not feeling well.

I made this tonight for me and my college kid and we just loved it!  It was very easy to make and came out moist and tasty!!  I did however add some season salt and Ms. Dash as I usually cook with both of these.  I also took the the leftover mix and poured over the chicken as the previous person stated. I will be making this again and soon.

I loved this recipe, it is my introduction to cooking continental dishes and I must say making this dish has encouraged me to keep trying, because I like the subtle and non messy flavors of continental dishes. However I did not use parmesan cheese and used whatever I had at  home, the prepared chicken did not have any salt added, so I had to use a sauce to have it with. Next time I am going to marinade the chicken with salt before preparing this dish

I made this recipe recently with one change.I used panko bread crumbs in place of the regular bread crumbs.  It turns out crispy and pretty as a picture.  This would be great company food.  I served it with an artichoke pasta and sweet peas.  Yum.

I figured my dad would eat just a little bit of this, being a picky eater. He loved it! Chomped down on 'em! Fairly easy to make, easy cook. I didn't use whole chicken breasts, I cut them into "fingers". Came out wonderful! I'll be making this one again!

Came out great!  I  added a little Italian dressing to the wash and sprinkled some crushed red pepper on top for a little extra zip.  Would definately make again.  Served with mixed veggies and pasta on the side.

Easy and yummy.  Added some herbs du provence.  Doubled the cheese and added some salt and more pepper.  Used skinless bone in breasts.  Adjusted cooking time for thicker breasts.

Served with brown rice quinoa mixture and broccoli.  Will make over and over.  Is so simple.

I made this pretty much as it was written.  It was just ok definitely lacking something, not quite sure what however. It was just kind of blah. I will try it again and tweek it a bit. Perhaps if I read through some of the reviews I will come up with my answer.  Not a bad recipe but not a real good one either.

Turned out very tasty! I would recommend flipping the chicken breast over for the last 5-10 minutes as the bottoms of mine were a little soggy. Will definitely make again.

This is a great basic recipe. I think if you follow it to a T then it will a tad tasteless. I used Italian style bread crumbs (all I had) instead of regular bread crumbs. I also didn't have fresh garlic so I used powder. Besides that I followed the recipe exact. I was surprised how moist the chicken was. Everyone loved it. I do suggest using Italian bread crumbs or adding extra italian seasonings. I'm giving this 4 stars because if it wasn't for the extra seasoning it wouldn't have tasted so good. Oh and you will need more than 2 tbs of olive oil. We will be using this as a regular base recipe. So much play room!

I made the way the recipe said and it came out pretty dry and the flavor was just o.k. definitely not great. It is a good concept tho, I will try again but instead of olive oil which sucked, I'll use mayo and mix the bread crumbs, parm cheese and seasonings ( I'll be adding extra spices since I like very flavorful food) together and spread on both sides. I think that'll keep the meat moist. For us in my family, nothings more unappealing  then dried out meat!!!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was on here. The chicken was delicious! I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs, fresh ground pepper, extra virgin olive oil, fresh grated parmesan cheese, and Kosher salt. The results were a very juicy inside with a light, crispy coating. I made a marinara sauce to go on top with noodles underneath. The recipe as is, is amazing. I don't think I would change anything other than the bread crumbs in the future just to see what kind of difference that makes. Very low maintenance prep and cook lets you focus on other parts of the meal!

Easy and good.  I love cooking when the recipes are quick and easy, especially on a hectic night.
I have made this recipe  several times and every time it turns out very good, moist and flavorful.  A great company recipe, no fuss and guaranteed lots of compliments.

Simple and tasty for what it is- I basically followed the instructions and just added seasoning that I know we like. This is great with pasta, over salad, etc. I baked it on a cookie sheet to keep it crispy and left it in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes- it was perfect. Thanks!

Made the recipe just as described & my family & I thought this was really good!  (Although admittedly my son does dip all of his chicken in BBQ sauce.)  My husband loved this too just as is.  Baking the chicken for 30 minutes was perfect - came out moist.  This is a quick & easy chicken recipe and I will definitely make again.  We had a side of french-style green beans & mashed sweet potatoes, but this chicken is so versatile, it would go with just about anything!

Made it tonight for the family, came out great. Everyone seemed to really like the crunchiness of the outside of the chicken but the fact that it stayed juicy inside too. Would definitely make this again. Thanks for the idea.

Made this a few times. Only changes are measurements. (I usually eye ball what it looks like I'll need.) Always great. Did use recipe to make chicken nuggets and my family loved it more than with breast of chicken.  Easier and more fun to eat that way, I guess. One of my go to's for sure.

These were very good.  It seems like there is way too much breading, but I followed the recipe and dumped the extra breading on top of the chicken in the pan.  So glad I did - somehow all the extra breading is used up and my kids ate these up, and so did my husband.  I think next time I make this I'll just spray the pan with Pam, sprinkle 1/3 cup of the breading into the pan, lay the chicken breasts on top and then cover with the rest of the breading mix and drizzle with some olive oil.  Easier and less messy way to fix it, and they should still turn out delish.

Delicious!  I also used Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Classic Stuffing instead of bread crumbs smashing them for smaller pieces. I also pounded the breasts before dipping in the olive oil mixture and added a 'touch' of cayenne pepper after they came out of the oven. Really really tasty! Will definately make it for guests!

I made it exactly as the recipe states. I used 6 rather large chicken breasts. The only issue I had was that there was no enough oil/garlic mix to adequately cover all 6 breasts. Added half again as much oil and garlic and it was enough. Suggest you make slightly more than called for.  
It is cooking now. I will add to this after we try it and let you know how it tastes.
It was delicious! Chicken was very moist and could practically be cut with a fork.  Be sure and cover it with foil. It did take slightly longer to cook. Prolly because of the size/number of chicken breasts.

I made this chicken and followed the recipe exactly. It was very very bland. I noticed the recipe doesn't say to season the chicken first, so as a preventive I used salt and pepper. 

I used seasoned Italian bread crumbs and at 350 for 30 minutes the bread crumbs barely gave a crunch. I'll admit I could definitely taste the Parmesan cheese and garlic, but that was it. (I actually added BBQ Sauce to give it some type of taste) 

If I were to change it any way it would be to make sure to really season the chicken, add panko crumbs instead and cook at 425 for 22 minutes. There are better chicken recipes out there. 

I won't make this again.

This was moist and flavorful. I served it along with garlic and butter new potatoes. I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I used Panko. I added a few seasonings, dried parsley, oregano and pepper to the Panko. It was wonderful. My bf loved it too. He cleaned his plate of two large pieces. The other thing I changed was the cooking time. Instead of the recommended cooking time of 20 minutes, I cooked it for 26 minutes because I wanted the crust a bit drier and crunchy. I will definitely make this again. Next time though, if I use Panko crumbs, I will add Italian seasoning.

The first time I make any recipe, I make it exactly like it's written.  I made this last night exactly like the recipe called for and didn't like it at all.  The chicken was very bland, and the coating was really soggy.   I would have given it 0 stars but my husband liked it.  I really doubt I will make this again though.

I followed the recipe pretty closely. Just added a bit more garlic and cooked it on a cooling rack so it didn't get soggy. This came out well and it was very easy! I agree with another reviewer: this is a base dish. I added sauce and served it over angel hair pasta. Easy, yummy dish. I'll make it again.

This turned out great! I did add a few more spices but not much and loved the way it was so moist and the crunch was great. I'd never seen a recipe that had you dredge the chicken in oil but what a great idea. My fiancé and I will definitely be having this again!

Made this exactly as shown and used half regular bread crumbs and half panko bread crumbs. It was very easy, quick and quite good. I will make this again.

The taste is great. Use enough oil in your pan to make the chicken crispy. I only lightly spritzed the baking sheet with olive oil and the chicken filets were a bit soggy but tasted great. I like mine crispy and will use more oil next time or will fry them in a frying pan.

Excellent! The entire family loved this including the kids. I used shredded Parmesan rather than grated which gave it a nice crispy top. Leftovers were great as mini sandwiches (using mini hamburger buns)

Absolutely wonderful. I recommend seasoned bread crumbs, though. I seasoned them myself with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning and it turned out great!

By far one of the best & easiest baked chicken recipes I've come across in a while. I made my own bread crumbs by dehydrating whole grain bread, and used fresh chicken tenders. Other than that, I made it exactly as listed and it was very yummy! I will be making this again & again! Great with veggies but will also be good with an Italian side, since it has basil, garlic & Parmesan in it. Excited to add this to my recipe box!

Honest to goodness, I think this is the very best chicken I've ever made.  It was falling apart and SO flavorful.  (I used chicken tenders because they were cheaper, and they worked well.)  There was a ton of breadcrumb mixture left over, and I was nervous about it burning on top, so I only put half of the leftovers on top and threw the rest out.  I don't know what I was thinking!  Next time, I'll use all of it.  Oh--and I used a can of chicken gravy, some simple boiled new potatoes, and corn on the cob to round the meal out.  I was lazy, but everything went together well.

It was great! The only thing I changed was instead of chicken I used cat fish and used a deep fryer, salt instead of garlic, thyme instead of basil, flour instead of bread crumbs, old bay instead of parmesan other than that a little more pepper!

Ehhh, just ok... something is wrong with the consistency of the breading here.  Would not make this again.  Family did not like it either.

Need to double garlic/olive oil, great tasting recipe. Make sure to use ALL of the bread crumb mixture because that is where all the flavor is, literally.

This recipe was well received but not raved about. I did make a couple of additions but nothing that would have changed my mind about the 4 stars. 

My additions: doubled the olive oil and garlic, pounded the chicken flat and added a tsp of oregano.
Changes: used a baggie for the bread crumbs, it is easier for cleanup. Add the oregano when you add the basil. Sprinkled the whole thing with garlic powder. Baked at 40 mins uncovered.

I absolutely love this simple chicken recipe.  i followed the recipe as written for 6 servings used on 4 chicken breast. love the turnout.  I have made this a few previous times and realized i like the parmesan cheese taste so i added more to bring out the taste and I love that i did that. Simple,  quick,  easy recipe!

This was a big hit with the family. The reason I'm giving it just 4 stars is due to all the oil. I think you could cut the oil in half and still have a great dish with fewer calories. I took my chicken out after 25 min and it was incredibly moist and juicy.

This is an OK recipe.  I set the recipe for 7 servings. I recommend using a little more olive oil then what the recipe calls for, you will run out.  The bread crumb coating was a little soft.  I'm not sure if this is a function of time cooked or heat to get it to be a little more crunchy.  I boiled my chicken breasts for a few minutes before I dipped them in the garlic and olive oil and then breaded them. Baked for 25 minutes.  The chicken was very tender and juicy, but like I said the bread coating was a little soft. I will try this again with some modifications to spice it up.  My kids liked it and that says a lot.

I used this on chicken breasts & legs. I omitted the Parmesan because I realized I had none after I chopped garlic & mixed my bread crumbs with seasoning. I added garlic powder to the bread crumbs for a little more garlic flavor. It turned out great. I use a very similar recipe for baked pork loin except I use Italian seasoning with the bread crumbs and mix it together with the olive oil. Pat the mixture onto the pork loin until it's coated & bake. It's amazing!!!

It was fine, the chicken was perfect and juicy, but it needs more flavor. Add a little more olive oil and some more salt plus a substantial amount of herbs de provence or something and this would be amazing.

LOVE this recipe. The chicken came out so moist. I added granulated garlic to the olive oil, but otherwise, used all other ingredients listed. Because the chicken breasts were thick, I baked 40 mins and they came out just right. I suggest serving potato salad with this meal. It's the perfect side dish. A garden salad and corn on the cob completed our meal.

I am going grain free, so was looking for parmesan chicken recipe and used this, omitting the bread crumbs, and adding Italian seasoning to the parmesan. It was very flavorful and the (natural) chicken was moist, juicy, cooking a bit longer in our oven. Poured Ragu chunky mushroom spaghetti sauce over just before serving. Will make this again!

Excellent recipe for easy, delicious chicken. My whole family loves this recipe and said I should make it at least once a week. TIP for cooking chicken: Always use a cooking thermometer. Take it out of the oven check the temperature, and if it's less than 160 deg F, it's not done. In fact for my palate, I like to get the chicken to at least 175-180 deg F as it's tastier. Higher than 190 deg F and it may become dry.

This was simple and very good. The only thing I did different was press the garlic through a garlic press to get more flavor from the garlic and I turned the chicken after 20 minutes and continued baking for 10 more minutes. The chicken was perfect and succulent. Thanks Karen.

I used peppridge farm stuffing instead of bread crumbs. I added in some lemon pepper and garlic salt to the dry mix. It was excellent. My daughter said it tasted like grandma made it- a huge compliment!

I'm new to cooking and I thought this was a good and easy recipe to try. I added melted butter to the oil mixture and used roasted minced garlic instead. Next time I will try marinating the chicken for a couple hours first that way the flavor soaks through.

WOW! This dish was absolutely delicious and moist. I doubled the recipe to have left-overs and it was wonderful. Not a lot to it but very tasty. I did add a little Italian herb seasoning to the breadcrumbs and used the Italian style breadcrumbs. It really was good. This is most definitely a keeper!!!

Just amazing!!  The only changes I made were to increase the oil to 1/4 cup to which I added 4 cloves of grated garlic.  (We absolutely LOVE garlic!)  I let this mixture stand for about 2 hours for the flavours to infuse.  The chicken was tender and sooo full of flavour. A definite keeper.

Made as directed, cooked 32 min in glass dish and came out moist and tasty. Sprinkled the remaining bread crumb mixture on and will likely leave that out next time. Thanks to OP and other reviewers:) EDIT: Has become my easy go-to chicken dish. Upped from 4 to 5 stars. Thanks again!

This was very good.  I used breasts and slightly pounded to an even 1/2 inch (they were big).  I marinated in Kraft Zesty Italian for 1/2 hour. Did not dip in any thing, rolled in Panko, Parmesan, Parsley, Lemon Pepper.   Cooked in convection toaster oven.  The last 10mins I poured the oil, garlic mixed with butter over and sprinkled with Paprika.  When tested and were 160 but not brown, turn on the broil for about 5 minutes.  Husband loved and so did I.  Served with mini potatoes which cooked with the chicken and sautéed asparagus.  While almost a new recipe, I would have never put all the together without the base recipe and other suggestions.

Very easy, quick recipe. I ran a little low on the oil mixture so I would double that next time and wasn't quite able to fit all 6 cutlets in pan.
cooking time was perfect

Love the use of Olive oil and garlic. I also use butter. I used 3/4C extra crispy shake and bake, 1/4C plain bread crumbs, 2/3C parm chz. It made a soft coating on the chicken with the olive oil, but was good. Could also try using crushed stove top as a coating.

Very yummy recipe! However; i did make some changes it to the original. First of all i marinated my chicken breasts with Tuscan Italian House dressing and milk to make the breasts very tender! I let them marinate for at least 4hrs. Second, i added 1 cup of Panko Bread crumbs and 1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain as the recipe called for. I also made 8 breast instead of 6 therefore i had to alter the recipe a bit. I used 5 cloves of garlic that i chopped then crushed - i find that it releases more of the garlic flavor this way- i then followed the directions on the original recipe... Just before putting them into the oven, in my household we like spicy therefore i sprinkled a little bit of Cayenne pepper on top of all breast also garlic powder, onion powder then a dash of  Rosemary! I did the 8 breast at 375 for 30 min, then turned them and did another 10 min. THIS WAS SPECTACULAR!! The parmesan and garlic sure make a great combo! And the Panko addition made this recipe the bomb since they were crispy on the outside but very tender on the inside! Just perfect. I have 2 lil boys and this was devour in minutes! TRY IT OUT

Made this tonight, and per following the directions, was very bland in our opinion. The chicken was a bit dry, although the crunchy topping was crunchy (didn't get soggy like others stated), it just lacked any flavor.  In the future, I will use 4TB oil, & minced garlic not from scratch. I think it would be better if chicken were dipped in oil, & then bread crumb mixture  (and add garlic to the bread crumbs, otherwise they do not stick to the chicken. .hence, the bland flavor).

I fixed this for dinner tonight.  My chicken was too dry.  Next time I will use a softer cheese.  Otherwise my family liked it and I will make again.

This recipe was easy and it tasted good. The chicken was a little dry and it took longer than 30 minutes for the chicken to be cooked thoroughly. I think I kept mine in for 45 minutes. I would definitely make it again but will try to season the chicken as some of the reviews suggested doing. I had sauteed green beans and marinated cucumber, tomato, and onion salad (used a recipe on this site).

I made this recipe twice it's absolutely delicious and very inexpensive and easy to make.
I did alter it a little bit by using more garlic as well as using Italian seasoning.
I also used panko with the bread crumbs for a little crispier texture.
The breadcrumbs were roasted garlic.
So good with couscous and garlic & olive oil green bean carrot blend..

I liked this recipe overall. I think that the chicken breast was a little bit dry from the inside. I think that it would be better with chicken drumsticks since they're not as dry. Next time, I'll do the recipe with chicken drumsticks.

I also added few dried herbs and increased the amount of parmesan cheese to 1 cup and used 2 medium size cloves garlic. Parmesan is already a salty cheese so I didn't need more. I used butter to grease, sprinkled a little bit more butter on the top of the chicken just before I put it to the oven. It took exactly 30 min to bake, juicy inside, crunchy outside... just perfect& yummy... Enjoy!

I made this last night! And it turned out amazing! I'm on a low carb diet so instead of the bread crumbs, I substituted it with pork rinds mashed up. It turned out super yummy and my roommates loved it too!

Delicious! Used crushed cornflakes instead of breadcrumbs with a little garlic salt. Salt/pepper the chicken before dipping in oil/garlic mixture. Needed double the oil and garlic to coat 6 chicken breasts (1.75 lbs). Everything else per recipe. Very moist and flavorful.

Very easy to make but I agree with others that seasoning on the chicken before breading would be better.  I also used Panko instead of bread crumbs.  Gave it a good crunch!

As noted in other reviews, I found myself wishing for more oil/garlic mix, and not needing quite so much of the breadcrumb/cheese mix. I also had to bake it an extra 15 minutes, probably because I used some really thick chicken breasts.

This was good. I needed more of the olive oil and garlic mixture to coat chicken (about double what recipe calls for). I had to bake for about 32 min. Next time I will leave off the additional breadcrumbs on top.

It was very bland. The chicken was also soggy. The bread crumbs were not crispy.

We really enjoyed this one, but like most, I made modifications.  I seasoned the chicken with kosher salt and ground pepper (light on the salt because of all of the salt in the cheese), and since I didn't have fresh garlic, I also seasoned with garlic powder. Always season your meat at least with salt and pepper before cooking.  I used Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs, which already has some seasoning as well.  I had to use more olive oil than two tablespoons, but I don't know how much more because I just poured a little more in.  It's not a big deal to add a little more.  I didn't have dried basil, but the bread crumbs might have.

My family really enjoyed this dish! I went a little heavier on garlic and black pepper,and added some chopped parsley after baking. This Is certainly a meal you can cook on the fly that has some real high quality flavors.

I used Panco seasoned bread crumbs and added a packet of True Lemon to the topping. The lemon flavor really gave it a zing! Will definitely be making this again!

I made this for my mom and sister, they loved it! I didn't have dried basil so when it was finished cooking I added fresh basil leaves. Also when the chicken was about half way cooked I flipped the chicken onto the other side. Overall everyone loved it!

While I think this recipe is delicious and I really enjoyed making it, the garlic oil AND bread crumb mixture proportions were off for six breasts. I ended up having to make lots of extra oil mix to cover my chicken, and I had WAY too much bread crumb mix, even after breading all of my chicken and putting some of the mix on top.

Another time I made this, I didn't have bread crumbs available and I substituted it with crushed, french fried onions. It ended up being delicious, and I'd highly suggest it.

Very moist, but not all that delicious, only okay.  For chicken breasts, too many breadcrumbs & not enough oil.  I put the garlic in the oil then removed & saved it.  I dipped the chicken in the garlic oil, coated bottom side of the chicken with crumbs, spooned some garlic on top, then pressed in crumbs.  I was thinking the garlic would stay in the dish or be unevenly distributed - or both.  :D  The crumbs didn't really brown, but that's to be expected without frying.  I'll make some marinara sauce & pasta to go with it tomorrow.

The recipe alone was okay. Was not enough oil for all chicken and didn't have much flavor in the end.  I add more oil, 2 garlic clove and some Italian style herbs. I also add 1 cup cheese instead of 2/3 and a little more pepper also 1 tbsp Italian herbs instead of just basil. Mmmm.

Very good recipe.  I LOVED that this was not an egg-wash recipe.  The kids were not too happy that the chicken was bathing in the sauce, but I liked it, and I liked how to do this chicken.  I will try again, with a mixture of the kids way, and this way.

I made this once when I was looking for something I could make quickly-it was one of those days. The family loved it. In fact, I was about to make another recipe tonight, and my husband requested this one instead. I will say that I keep thinking it needs more garlic than is called for, but you know what? It really doesn't. It's very garlicky just with the one clove.

Another household FAV! But, I do it a little different
I use butter instead of oil (not as healthy ;),fresh basil & season my meat with salt & pepper. I also slice my chicken breast to make them thinner.

I made just one serving (ah the life of a single girl!) and used PAM spray rather than olive oil (realized I was out!), and used regular Panko bread crumbs, but otherwise kept things the same.  Turned out great!  Easy to make, quickly done so I can eat!  Served it with salad and on top of leftover couscous.  Positive I'll make this again!

Was looking for a quick, healthy baked chicken breast recipe and this was exactly what I wanted!  It was so easy and the chicken turned out incredibly moist.  I lightly pounded the chicken breasts with a meat tenderizer and substituted with whole wheat breadcrumbs.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, I'll probably try adjusting the recipe by increasing the amount of olive oil & garlic and salt & pepper the chicken before dipping them into the oil mixture next time - but that's just personal preference.  My picky family loved this dish!  (I'm going to try using the leftovers for a chicken parm tomorrow night.)  It requires no flipping in the oven, minimal clean up and it's yummy - you can't ask for a better dish!

As this was just for my wife and I, the recipe was scaled back to use just 2 chicken breasts.  We used seasoned bread crumbs, and one garlic clove.  Otherwise prepared per the recipe. Very tasty.

My husband couldnt stop RAVING about this!!! He couldnt believe there was no skin. The breadcrumb parm mixture made it seem as if he was tasting skin. After coating chicken in breadcrumb parm mixture i realized i had a lot of this mix left so i added more on top of the chicken. I think this was key to the success and unbelievably tastey outcome. I also salt and peppered the chicken bf dipping in evoo mixture. Must try if u want to win the heart of your husband through this chicken! My husband couldnt stop talking about how good it was. Thanks so much for this simple yet AMAZING recipe.

Used panko instead of breadcrumbs.  Was good but next time use the breadcrumbs to see the difference

This is a good, easy recipe for nights when you don't have much time.  I used panko bread crumbs and fresh thyme instead of basil.  Like others I also needed more than 2 tablespoons of oil to coat the chicken though.  Will make again!

The proportions of olive oil and garlic in this recipe are way off, but the flavor is good.  I could see right away that there wouldn't be enough olive oil and garlic for 6 breasts. 6 cutlets, perhaps. 6 whole breasts? No. I had 2 large chicken breasts and used the recommended oil, but tripled the garlic. It still didn't have a strong garlic flavor, no worries there. (Hint for next time; cook the garlic in the oil first to intensify the flavor) I used ½ cup each plain breadcrumbs and panko, along with the cheese. I baked it in my Breville Smartoven on a raised rack for 35 minutes. again leading me to believe this was written for filleted breasts, not whole ones. The Breville normally DECREASES cooking time. I finished it for 3 minutes under the broiler to brown the coating, then let it rest for 5 minutes.  I'd like to find a way to make the coating adhere better. Dredge them in four before dipping in oil? use less oil, mixed with mayo? Let them chill for an hour? Still, the flavor was still very good and I'd make it again. Served with Pasta e Olio and Caesar Salad Supreme (both on this site) it was a garlic lover's feast. Fix the proportions and timing and it'll be a 5-star Master Recipe. As is, a novice would never get the desired result.

Tried this recipe this evening, and it was very good.  I took the advise of other reviews and prepared less of the bread crumb/parm mixture...  if, after you combine this bread crumbs & cheese mixture and it looks like there's too much, just take some out before breading the chicken...  that way if you've made too much you can always place the unused excess in an airtight container or ziplock, refrigerate it and use it another time, even when making meatballs.  I did use Italian style breadcrumbs and more garlic.

Excellent.  I made this when we had visitors, and everyone loved it!!  For the bread crumbs, I used garlic croutons crushed in the food processor, which helped keep the crust crunchy and not as soggy as regular bread crumbs.  Wonderful recipe!!

I loved how the olive oil kept the breading on the chicken even while cutting into it, it was pretty tasty. I forgot to add the basil to the mixture so I just added it on top once the chicken was baked and ready to go. My family loved it!

Not bad at all, I especially liked the garlic/olive oil combo which gave it a nice flavor.  I cooked this exactly as the recipe states, and kids loved it.  I wish it had a crunchier texture.  Next time i will marinate the chicken in the olive oil/garlic mixture for a more intense flavor adding some salt/ pepper as well.

This was delicious and very moist! I had to bake it about 45 minutes instead of 30 to get it up to correct temperature. This is a repeat dinner.

This was great for an easy weeknight dinner.  I kinda eyeballed all the measurements because I was only making 2 chicken breast halves.  I took another reviewers suggestion and put the olive oil and garlic in the baking dish and warmed it in the oven (less dishes to wash later). Next time I'll add salt and pepper and maybe broil it for a couple minutes to make the breading a little crispy.  I also had to cook it about 10 minutes extra because of the size of the chicken breasts I used.

I made this chicken and followed all ingredients and directions except I only had italian bread crumbs. It was not as good as I thought it would be. It also took 1 hour to cook. Next time I'll pound the breast thin and change up the ingredients.

Prepared this exactly as directions.  I used frozen chicken breasts and thawed them in the microwave prior to preparing.   However,  they were not completely thawed on inside,  so my cook time was longer (about an hour).  Family loved it,  I will do this again!

Even my 13yo, who doesn't really like chicken, loved this recipe.  I combined the olive oil & garlic (upped it for 8 boneless breasts) in a ziplock bag & then added the chicken.  I let sit for a few hours in the fridge.  Used italian bread crumbs and Belgiosio shredded parmesan cheese. Baked in oven at 350° for 30 minutes, then 375° for 15 more, since it wasn't cooked enough, according to my meat thermometer (new stove to boot).  Breading was perfect; don't know why some reviews had complained about it being soggy.  DH kept insisting how good the chicken was & even took the leftovers to work the next day.

Made this tonight and we loved it! Followed the easy recipe and the result was fantastic. (The only thing I changed was adding a tablespoon of sugar in with the olive oil.)  After placing the coated chicken onto the parchment papered cookie sheet to bake, I added the rest of the Panko/parmesan cheese mixture on top of the chicken pieces. Excellent dish and will be definitely a make-again!

Made exactly by the recipe. Bland chicken (there's no seasoning on the chicken beyond the garlic), and a mouthful of boring bread crumbs. It might be better with seasoned bread crumbs rather than plain (you have too much dry, flavorless crumbs for the amount of chicken) and with the addition of seasoning to the chicken--and maybe with some sort of wash (besides 2T oil) to make the crumbs stick to the chicken. But as written, this was not very good.

This recipe is amazing! It was so easy to make. I used more oil than the recipe called for (3 tbl). I also preseasoned the chicken an hour before with a little salt, pepper, and adobo. My boyfriend and his brother loved it. I served them pasta as a side while I ate it over zucchini noodles. Definitely trying this again!

I thought this was fantastic and so did my very, very picky kids!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe except I had to bake it an additional 10 min(I think my oven runs cooler).  The chicken was tasty and very moist.  Perfect and all my guests complimented me on it! It was super easy to make as well.

Love this recipe. It is a little basic, so I did as another reviewer suggested, and added a bit more Italian spice and spaghetti sauce & mozzarella cheese after 20 min in the oven. Served over spaghetti. I also used the recipe to bake pork chops (just left out the Parmesan because I was out). YUM!!

Very delicious. I did take the lazy way out...sprayed the chicken with olive oil spray and sprinkled with garlic powder before putting in the crust mixture. That was the only change I made and the chicken turned out beautiful. I will be using the leftovers in the chicken pot pie I'm making tonight.

My husband who is not a fan of chicken loved this recipe. His exact words were "it's a keeper".  I used Italian bread crumbs since I didn't have plain and I forgot to add the basil. But I figured it was a wash. I only made two breasts and I had just enough oil.  You would definitely need to use more if doing the 6 breasts.

Delicious! It made the whole house smell wonderful. I made some very minor adjustments.  I sliced the chicken breasts, as my family likes their chicken thinner. I really need lots more than 2 tablespoons of olive oil to coat all the chicken and I used lots more garlic too. I also very gently simmered the oil and garlic and then let it sit a few minutes for the oil to really pick up the garlic flavor. I made this recipe twice, once with regular bread crumbs and once with panko. My family preferred the panko style crumbs.Finally, I added some salt and pepper right over the panko coated chicken before putting it in the oven.  An excellent recipe.

Fixed this for supper it was awesome! Hubby was skeptical but said hey this is good lol I didn't mention the basil or garlic since he is finicky just added less lol . Didn't have dry bread crumb but didn't seem to make a difference with bread when I put it with the other ingredients in my osterizer. Thanks so much

I made this tonight. There's nothing amazing about it, but it's a simple, flavorful, and easy dish. I used Panko crumbs like others did, as that's all I really use these days. So much better, and gives recipes more crunch, texture, and a better flavor. I pounded out the chicken a bit to flatten it, and baked it at 375 for 30 minutes, turning the chicken after 15 minutes so each side would crisp up a bit. I'll make it again if I need a quick, healthy dinner in 30 minutes.

I found that  30 minutes at 300 F was NOT long enough for these to cook.  I cooked it an extra 10 minutes, and I still think it could cook a bit more.  Especially if you want that nice golden brown color the website achieved.  I liked the taste, however.  And as another reviewer mentioned, it is not enough oil to coat the breasts before dipping.  I did use boneless chicken thighs, however.  Now, I will watch the video clips, like I should have before starting :)

The coating was way too much, next time I will cut that in half.  But I definitely needed more olive oil.  I like the idea of using half butter.

Excellent, juicy, delicious, and fast!  I used a bit more olive oil and garlic than the recipe calls for, but otherwise stuck with the original recipe.  At 350 degrees, I set the timer for 45 min and it came out perfect.  SOOOO juicy that I cut it with my fork.  I would recommend for and easy fast delicious meal.

I've made this chicken twice this week. It is fantastic! If you want the chicken juicy and tender 30 minutes is more than enough time for them to cook. The chicken breasts I used were about an inch to an inch and a half thick.

I liked this recipe except I modified it a little because I didn't go to the store and sort of had to improvise.  I put olive oil and minced garlic in a bowl and then in the other bowl I measured out the grated parmesan, and I thought I had basil but didn't so I just sprinkled out a bunch of Italian seasoning, then a little garlic salt and a little pepper.  I thought I had bread crumbs but didn't so I took the left over bag of butter and garlic croutons and smashed them up really well and poured that in there.  I was a little concerned but everything turned out so well and everyone loved it!  It didn't taste like too much garlic either.  It worked.

Eh. Just OK. I think I will go back to frying my parmesan chicken. It was not crispy or terribly flavorful. I don't think it is a huge benefit nutritionally to bake it, as you still use olive oil in the recipe. The family ate it but no rave reviews here.

i was hoping the chicken would have browned a bit more but since i was going to serve this with sauce and cheese on it i guess it doesn't matter.. cut the recipe in half and used 6 boneless, skinless chicken legs and still had some of the breading leftover.. the flavor was good so no complaints from me.. ty for the recipe

The chicken came out great but only after it was cooked longer at a higher temperature. I followed the recipe to the "T", After the 30 minutes in the oven as the recipe suggests, it was still bloody. I Had to bump up the temperature to 400 degrees for another 20 minutes. I haven't made it again but will do 40 minutes at 375.

this was great, but i used large chicken breasts so the cook time was off.  added more garlic and also used parmesan and romano cheese to give it more flavor. turned out delicious though, and next time i plan on serving it with a pineapple avocado salsa.

Absolutely delicious! Although many reviews said how moist and juicy chicken was, I gotta say, I still had my doubts. But it's true, it came out very soft inside, and just a little crunchy on the outside. Next time, I will try panko breadcrumbs for more crunch. The only addition I made to the recipe - when the chicken was ready, I sprinkled it with shredded mozzarella cheese and put it back in the oven for a few more minutes. I baked the chicken at 365 for 30 min, and it was perfect! I can't wait to make it again!!!

The chicken tasted pretty good and was very easy to make.  Nothing spectacular.  I used 'trimmed & ready' chicken breast tenders for convenience.

This turned out really well.  I cooked the Chicken breast for 30 min. uncovered then covered it and cooked for 6 more min.  The chicken was tender & delicious!
Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This recipe is cheesier and less garlicky than Garlic Chicken (on this site). Personally, I prefer the other recipe because it warms the oil and garlic to deepen the flavor. I also use part olive oil and part melted butter. In this recipe, I don't think the dried basil leaves add anything.

An absolutely excellent recipe. Follow instructions as indicated (adjust ingredients according to chicken weight - I did for garlic, olive oil, bread crumbs and parmesan as my chicken was 2 1/2 lbs.

Extremely juicy! Overall flavor will depend on what/how much seasonings you add to breadcrumb mixture. I used basil, oregano, garlic powder, salt & pepper. Will definitely make again as it's quick as well as easy to change up with different herbs & spices.

I like it very much!  I will make this again.  I divided the recipe in half.  I butterflied 3 BSCB, used Panko and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I did bake it for 35 minutes though as the chicken was still a little frozen in the middle.  Chicken was tender and juicy and  wasn't over powered by the garlic or parmesan.

I made this chicken and it was wonderful!  So delicious I almost ate the whole thing.  I use Panko bread crumbs which didn't adhere too well but otherwise, very tasty dish.  I highly recommend.

This does for making dinner in a pinch. My husband really liked it though. I will probably make it again when in a hurry. It's nothing fancy though!

Super easy, super delicious. The light crust is so pleasant. We served these chicken breasts over plain pasta, and it was just perfect. Will definitely be making this again!

PS: I went overboard with the garlic (5 cloves, lol) and we couldn't get the garlic smell out of the kitchen for a whole day. Learn from my mistake - go easy with the garlic! I'm such a noob.

I've prepared this twice, using it as a kind of jumping off place for my own little touches. The firs time I used egg and a couple of tablespoons fresh cream to coat before the crumb/parmesean mixture, but kept the rest the same. Just today I prepared it again, this time using olive oil, freshly grated parmesean, panko crumbs and added ground italian seasonings to the mix rather than the basil. I also threw in a little extra rosemary. Both times, tho slightly different, it was great. So easy and everyone thinks it took me all day.

This was fast and easy and tasted as if I worked on it for a long time. I had to add a little  melted butter to the wet mix to get the breadcrums to stick better though. Thanks for the recipe and I may make it again :D

I prepared this pretty much as written, though I did add some salt and pepper to the chicken and then let it hang out in the garlic olive oil for a bit to which I added 1t of melted butter. It really is very good and as advertised, a quick, easy recipe that tastes great. The chicken stayed moist at the 350 temp, always a problem with boneless skinless chicken breasts and the bread crumbs browned nicely and did not burn. There are many ways to tweak it, but my point is it's a sound recipe.

Simple and yummy recipe! Use chicken breast and then cut up- we found this to be the most moist. Great leftovers too : ) I used on top of salad with a light dressing the next day - yum yum!

This was great.  I used Italian style bread crumbs and added a little salt to the mix.  Chicken came out perfectly cooked.  I served it over a bed of pasta with marinara sauce, but it could easily work with potato side dishes.

I had on hand organic chicken breasts that were thinned sliced and instead of bread crumbs, I used herb stuffing mix from Pep. farm(I crushed it more). I used more olive oil and garlic than the recipe called for and I also used equal parts grated parm and crushed stuffing (1 cup each). The 30 minutes in the oven at 350 was perfect. Nothing was soggy maybe because I used a thinned sliced chicken breast and the stuffing mix instead of breadcrumbs. I served it with just a spinach salad on the side (with almonds, balsamic dressing, dried cherries, little blue cheese). Easy healthy dinner!

Super, super easy. Love that it doesn't require a lot of prep or a lot of cleaning. I hate when people review a recipe according to their own tweaks but the only thing I did differently was I used panko instead of breadcrumbs b/c that's what I had on hand but I don't think this would alter it much. 

My main criticism is that the bottom of the chicken doesn't get crispy (which I suspected but I figured I'd try it as is before changing it). Next time, I'll put it on a rack of something so both sides get crisped. I'll also add some salt and pepper to the chicken b/c I found the end result did need a touch more seasoning. 

(Oh, and my 2 year old said it was "yum" so that makes it all worth it)

Very, very moist and easy. Didn't know you could coat with oil and then bread the chicken.  Much less mess than coating with milk and egg.

this recipe is easy and delicious.  Made it exactly as described and it was so good.  I did cook it for 45 minutes instead of 30 though.  Also, made some chicken thighs too --- they came out fine.

This recipe was perfect! I make baked chicken a lot but always by dipping it into the egg before coating with breadcrumbs. We had a crowd for breakfast and no eggs left. The oil & garlic is a good substitute. Thanks!!

hi!  i have never written a review before, but i just had to write this one!  this recipe was really great, and the family i cooked it for was very pleased.  it was my first chicken parm, and what a success!  i only did one thing different:  i added an egg to the olive oil for my personal preference.  i followed the rest as written.  the breading stayed on, the chicken was moist and tender.  i served it with home made tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese on top.  thank you for this easy, delicious recipe!

This was such a success! The chicken comes out very tender and moist; needless to say my friends were raving about it! It's also super easy and quick to prepare. I did make a few adjustments (added salt, and sage instead of basil) but other than that, I followed the recipe.

I did not have bread crumbs so I crushed Sundried Tomato Basil Wheat Thins, then added the seasoning.  It was tasty, but I did have to bake an hour. My only complaint, and it's will most breaded recipes, is soggy breading on the bottom layer.

Although the chicken was juicy and tender, found this recipe to be incredibly bland.

Very good! The recipe is wasteful.. So I would suggest halfing the breaking.. I also added some pepper jack cheese on top with about 5 minutes to go

My girls loved this! I did substitute with Italian bread crumbs, added more garlic (we're garlic feens), Just a pinch of basil leaves and I used Mexican Monterrey Jack shredded cheese instead. However, the original way or the substitued way is quite delicious!

Great recipe!  I didn't have six chicken breasts, but I did have two chicken breasts and 5 chicken thighs.  Used three cloves of garlic, but followed the rest of the recipe as stated.   My family loved it.  Keeper!!!

this recipe was good. i made it for the first time with frozen chicken and it came out a little dry but i think i cooked it too long (about an hr) I have a meat thermometer but i don't think its very accurate and that's no fault of the recipe. The flavor was very good. when i make it again i will leave the breading off the bottom (it didn't come out crisp on the bottom) and i would season the actual chicken breast. 
this is a keeper i will definitely make it again :)

followed recipe exactly, was so easy and flavorful.  the crust wasn't as crunchy as i'd hoped maybe do a lil broil at the end of cooking to crisp it. but overall very quick and good.  thanks for sharing.

The only thing I did different was I used dried minced garlic, 1/8 tsp = 1 clove. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly. Chicken was tender, moist, DELICIOUS! I will be making this again!! I paired it up with Uncle Ben's Chicken & Wild Rice...YUM! Thank you for posting Karen!!

Absolutely phenomenal! This was the very first thing that I have ever cooked...EVER! It was very easy and so delicious! I did tweak the recipe based on what some other users said (Panko bread crumbs, and marinating the chicken in Italian dressing). I can't wait to try this again!

Instead of using halving the chicken breasts, we cut them into strips. That messes with the time in the oven, so watch them. But they were good! Maybe add some salt to the breading?

Just did this and Followed more of the reviews using butter with olive oil and flipping the chicken halfway through. my friends and i loved it! used 3 stars because i didn't use the EXACT recipe. used a lot of mrs. dash and more garlic than the recipe called for.

Per the other reviews, this recipe makes juicy delicious chicken.  I followed as is EXCEPT I used crumbled Buffalo Wing flavored pretzels, of all things and did not use any cheese (I don't buy dairy).  
It was actually excellent.  I think I will try crumbled sun chips (salsa flavor is my fav) next.

My husband and I loved this!!!  I used egg whites instead of the olive oil to reduce the calories.  I also added more garlic because we love garlic and added some Italian seasoning.  It was awesome!  Our chicken breasts were thick so they cooked a little over the 30 minutes.  We will be making this again.

It was rather bland tasting... I should have followed other reviewers suggestions to season the chicken first. And the cooking time was way off. I pounded down very thick breasts to almost cutlets and 30 minutes was not long enough. I had to turn the heat up to 375 and cook another 15 minutes. Good base recipe and I'm one of those people who will rate a recipe AS WRITTEN first and not tell you all about how I changed this and that. It has potential to be a 5 star with some modifications. I might try this again with chicken parmesan.

I added a little chopped rosemary to the olive oil and garlic mixture and it was so aromatic and flavorful. It was delicious! It's hard to find a chicken recipe that isn't fried that my kids will eat, but this was definitely one of them.

The chicken was juicy and moist, but the bread crumbs made the whole thing tasteless.  I used Panko which I knew several other reviewers had tried.  I added some of the leftover breadcrumbs on top like the recipe said and I think that was part of the problem.  My family & I ate it but my brother complained and gave it a high 6.  Everyone else was too nice to complain.  I will not be making this again.

Have made this twice now - super easy and yummy. I find that breasts often dry out but with this coating stay really moist and tender.
Didn't change a thing and perfect as is!!

Delicious!  Used tenderloins (18 of various sizes) so needed to double the amount of olive oil and garlic "wash".  Breading mixture could easily be reduced by 1/4 and still be enough for this amount.  Cooking time of 30 minutes was still good.
UPDATE AS OF 20 NOV 2011:  Made this the second time...everyone still loved it.  This time I used breasts (four) and the original amount of "wash" was sufficient.  WAY too much crumb mixture...should have halved it.  Thirty minutes was enough but just barely because these babies were large!

Very easy and very tasty. I added a little onion powder and salt. I was curious about the fact that the recipe has no egg in it (I always use egg for breading chicken), but it turned out great with the added bonus of me not having to submerge my hands in nasty egg goop. :) I had to cook my chicken longer because I had very large pieces, but it turned out very moist and juicy and I'm wondering if the oil didn't have something to do with it. We will be making this again.

This chicken was ok. I pressed 3 cloves of garlic into the olive oil then marinated the chicken in it. Followed all other instructions. I will make this again, altering flavors to suit the rest of the meal. The flavor was good, just not spectacular. The key is not to over cook it. 30 minutes was perfect.

Fast and easy to make.  I doubled the garlic and used seasoned panko bread crumbs.  Also added a bit of cayenne pepper.  Turned out great and was an easy weeknight dish to prepare.

Excellent recipe, although I ran out of oil before I was finished breading the chicken and had to add more (luckily I use pre-diced, jar garlic).  Family loved it and asked me to make again, which I will be doing.

This recipe has too much bread crumbs.  It was a bit dry as a result.  With some adjustments it probably would be pretty good.  I added some pasta sauce with vegetables to make it better, and served it all on a bed of spinach.  I did not cook it with the pasta sauce, but added it after it was cooked.  Next time I will probably cut the bread crumbs down by about 50%.

i found it to be very bland.  I have a much better (similar) recipe that has a lot more taste.  The marinade is more of an Italian salad dressing with fresh lemon juice.  The rest of the ingredients were fine.  I will go back to my other recipe>

Easy and excellent recipe.  I would improve it by using 2 pressed garlic cloves in the oil.  And I would add oregano with the basil.  My husband, who does not usually like chicken, had two pieces!
A definite keeper...

Based on all the reviews, I was really expecting something spectacular. Unfortunately, this turned out really bland, despite my taking a reviewer's advice and adding salt and pepper to the chicken. I even dusted the coated chicken with garlic powder just before sticking it in the oven, but it didn't seem to help. This might be better with some tweaks, but as it is it didn't really have much flavor (and yes, I added the basil). I'm giving it three stars for ease of preparation and texture (use the Panko bread crumbs).

I made this tonight for my family along with my brother and 14 year old nephew.  My nephew loved it as well as my husband and brother (and myself).  I will be making this again.  The only change I made was that I used crushed stuffing because that is what I had on hand.  It was awesome!

I agree with everyone and will say this recipe was excellent!!!!! I added oregeno and crushed red pepper. It was really tastey. As my side dish, I made spinach ravioli with pesto sauce. It was a great hit. Once again, this was a quick and easy recipe any family would enjoy..

Man oh Man!! I made this three nights ago, and we are still talking about it! (That's sooo sad!!) lol  This is truly a wonderful recipe. I made my own bread crumbs, I just got a Ninja so I will chop or grate anything that gets in my way, anyway..made as directed only using more garlic. Baked for thirty minutes and they were divine. So flavorful, tender..I think I've been OVER COOKING chicken breasts for about forty years..I think this is how they are supposed to be. ANYWAY.. everyone should give this a try..you won't be sorry! Thanks for sharing!!!

This chicken dish was SUPER easy to make (perfect for beginner cooks)! The flavor was lacking just a tad for me (had to add salt), which is why I rated it four stars.  Served the chicken with shells & cheese, but would have been great with steamed veggies, too. I'll definitely make this again.

Great dish!  I was very impressed!  We were looking for chicken to eat with chicken Parmesan and this sounded easy and good.  It did not disappoint!  The only substitution I made was because I had run out of bread crumbs and used crushed ritz crackers instead.  Also I used whole chicken breasts and they were pretty big so I added 10 minuted to the cook time.  I checked the internal temp at 30 minutes and they werent quite there but were perfect after 10 additional minutes.  Will be making this again, very easy and my family loved it!

Turned out great.  I used plain bread crumbs, an italian herb mixture instead of just basil, romano cheese instead of parmesean (that's just what I happened to have) and a little paprika.  The chicken was very juicy and tender.  Even my 18 month old gobbled it up!  Pairs great with couscous.

So delicious and so easy!  Followed a few of the other suggestions and used fat free yogurt to dip the chicken in before dredging it in the bread crumbs.  Turned out terrific.  So moist!

Excellent. I agree that it's best with fresh grated parmesan. Also, I sprinkled more parmesan on top and let it sit for 5 minutes after I took it out of the oven. To die for.

This is a great, easy recipe.  I used Pepperidge Farm Stuffing Mix (ground up) because that was all I had on hand, but it turned out very good!  I added the pepper to the olive oil mix, and salted the strips before I put them in the oven.

My entire house smelled SOOO good while this was cooking everyone's mouth was watering and they were clambering around the kitchen begging to dig in. It did not disappoint either, it was (in the words of my boyfriend) DE-LISH-US! I made lots so there's even a couple pieces left-over (at least there was lol). Thank you for an AMAZING recipe!!

It has a very nice taste but the coating doesn't get crispy. I will add some panko next time, so there will be a next time. TFS

My husband and I loved it- it was simple and easy to do, and the kids even tried it!  If you are looking for a new chicken recipe, try this one, have a bottle of white wine ready and enjoy!  We are currently trying to figure out what is best to pair it with- plain herbed rice did not do it justice-

Amazing! Quick and easy and pretty healthy. I used mostly fresh Parmesan and a little grated. I used twice at much garlic and will do more next time. HUGE hit with the fam! And will become a regular addition to our meal plan.   I served with fresh green beans with sea salt and olive oil, a little butter and 1/2 spaghetti, 1/2 whole wheat spaghetti also with olive oil, a little butter and some Parmesan. Went very well together!

Great!  The only changes I made were to skip the garlic and instead add some garlic / black pepper seasoning to the bread crumb mixture.  I made sure to use Panko breacrumbs, and then after cooking for 35 mins (thick breasts) I put them under the broiler for 2 minutes to nicely brown the crust.

Delicious.  I used skinless bone-in thighs and cooked them bone side up.  Very moist and tender.  I served with cous-cous cooked with mushrooms & green onions. A green salad on the side made for a complete and healthy meal.

Great flavor but it didn't crisp up enough.  I will try to increase the temperature at the end or maybe sear it in a pan first before baking it.

Excellent! We used chicken legs and thighs for this recipe and although it took longer to bake, they were moist and very tastey. We look forward to another dinner with this recipe and will plan for it often if not weekly.

i love this recipe. Whenever I am making food for a  guest, I whip this out if I am in a hurry. Yum! My husband loves this one. I am a huge garlic fan so I always add 3-4 more cloves than suggested. Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

Great Healthy Recipe. I made it with chicken tenders and cooked in at 350 convection for 20-25 min. Cooked some penne pasta. Also simmered olive oil and garlic in a pan and added a large can of crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, and sugar. What a keeper.  Less mess, less calories.

double olive oil & garlic, add 1 t oregano, plus a spritz of oil just before putting in oven so it browns.  With that, served with pesto pasta, and a vegie, and it's a 5.

I let the garlic and oil sit for about half an hour, allowing the oil to be infused with flavor.  Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.`I had 4 large breasts and thought the amount of crumbs was just about right, with a little extra to sprinkle over top.  I found this recipe very flavorful.

Great recipe - thanks for sharing!  The only item I added was seasoning salt and pepper to the chicken breast before coating in the oil and garlic. I even paired down the recipe just for two, and it came out great. Served with rice dish and asparagus. The next two days the chicken was fantastic on a kaiser roll too!

I have made this many times and it is always great!  I also chop up more garlic and let it marinate in the olive oil for some extra flavor, and marinate the breasts in some buttermilk so they are extra tender

Very tasty and moist.  Added italian seasoning to the bread crumbs.  Used baggies to bread the chicken.  Made for easy clean up.

We cut this up into smaller servings and served with noodles and spaghetti sauce. We also used a dry spaghetti sauce mix as the spices which was really good. The only thing I would do differently is substitute egg or milk to adhere the breading. The oil does not keep it on very well once you start cutting into it.

I love it!!! This recipe is so easy to make and tasteful. I like the combination of garlic & cheese which I think added so much flavor. Will definitely make this recipe again. The only minor change I made was to combine everything in ONE bowl not in separate bowls as the original recipe has. Thanks for sharing.

This could have been atleast 4 stars  but the bottom of the chicken was very soggy. Perhaps it would be better if only the top of the chicken was breaded.Probably wont make this one again.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!  So tender and very tasty.  I didn't have any basil so I used Italian seasoning.  My husband and I just loved it and are now making this a regular dinner staple.

This is a keeper.  Super easy and very tasty.  I added some salt to the breading mixture and upped the garlic as well...I use the minced garlic from TJs and used about 2 teaspoons.  It was moist and delicious.  The kids and hubby loved it!

Very good! I added melted butter to the oil mixture and used Italian Seasoning to spice it up a bit. Pounded the meat to make it even and then at the end of cooking, broiled for several minutes. Will make this again and again, I'm sure!

This has become an every other week or so dish that I make for my husband and I. It's delicious, and especially if you dip it in a little ranch dressing. I also add more garlic than it calls for, my husband is Italian so when it comes to garlic, no limits. Recommend everyone try this.

This was very good.  The only thing I did different was do the olive oil/garlic (added extra garlic) mixture that morning and added my chicken to it in a baggie, so the olive oil really soaked up the garlic flavor.  It turned out very very good.  Oh yeah...also, instead of breadcrumbs, I used stuff mix, crushed up in the blender.  Made it nice and crunch.

This was okay, but not great.  I used stuffing mix as was suggested by others, but the coating was still rather dry, and the spice was over powering.

Very good and very easy.  I did as others suggested and put the olive oil, minced garlic, salt & pepper in a large Zip-loc with the chicken (I used 6 'tenders'), coated all the chicken, then dredged in the Italian breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mixture.  This worked great and was a snap to clean up.  I did have quite a bit of the breadcrumb/cheese mixture left over, so these quantities could be cut down some.  Otherwise, great recipe with great results.  Served with spaghetti for a traditional Chicken Parmesan.

I did not follow the receipe - I just winged it - and the ingredients were awesome!  Everyone loved it.  I sliced the chicken breasts in half so they would cook faster.  They were juicy and tender - just perfect!

The whole family actually loved this one.  I did the italian flavor bread crumbs and added extra olive oil and garlic with only 4 chicken breasts.  Really good taste for everyone.

This was delicious, healthy & easy to make.  I used powdered garlic & replaced the oil with egg whites to reduce the fat a bit.  This will definitely go in my regular rotation!

These were great! I'm a pretty inexperienced cook so I followed the recipe to the t and it came out perfect! My borfiend loved it and since I always have these ingredients on hand I see this becoming a regular in our home.

Fantastic.  I used a mixture of olive oil and margarine per another review and it was a little greasy so I don't think I'll do that next time.  Also, cut the bread crumb mixture in half - I had way too much.  Will make this again and again!

I thought the combonation of ingredients went great. I only had 2 to cook for so I had to eyeball the portions, added a little salt and we really liked it.  I think I'm going to serve it with some white rice with some sort of a white sauce next time. It's a little bit of a dry dish but again tasted great!

YUM! I just made this tonight and got rave reviews from my family! The chicken was very tender and garlicky, just like I like it. I added 5-6 cloves of freshly pressed garlic to the olive oil which gave it a nice Italian-garlic flavor. Next time I will decrease the bread crumbs as another reviewer suggested or increase the amount of cheeseas it was a tad bit dry on the outside. I will be making this again, thanks!

Great flavors and texture.  This is one of the best chicken recipes that I have eaten in a long time.  Added steamed french beans and broiled fresh tomatoes stuffed with goat cheese.  A weeknight dinner that could easily convert to special occasions.

I give this recipe 5 stars.  It was delicious, juicy and tender.  The only change I made was:  I used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of flour.  This will be a regular dinner for us now.

Good. Not as good as the fried version, but then fat makes everything better. (lol!)Made it as Chicken Parmesan with Marinara sauce over linguini. Since I discovered Panko, that's the only kind of bread crumbs I use. Because many people said this could be bland, I added one 0.7oz. package of Italian dressing and recipe mix (Good Seasons) to the bread crumb mixture. Not bland! Served with sliced garden tomatoes with fresh basil and fresh mozzerella. Yum!

Delish! didn't give it a "5" because I usually reserve the top rating just in case somthing better turns up.  But this was really good. I used organic, air-chilled chicken breasts that I cut thin enough to cook evenly and made a few changes, based on what I had - romano, panko, and dried Italian herbs - and cooked it in the toaster oven becuase it's soooooo hot here in Central Texas. Served it with a spinach, feta, red onion, mandarin orange, walnut salad dressed with creamy balsamic.

I read so many good reviews of this recipe and it was very easy. However, I had trouble with it cooking, it took quite some time and never did get brown. I used a stoneware 9" sq pan.

Great!  A super-easy weeknight dinner recipe.  I cut the breasts into half width to decrease cooking time.  There's more breading/chicken that way too, which is nice.  I substituted olive oil for the butter, added garlic powder and Italian Seasoning to the breadcrumbs and just a little grated parmesan cheese.  I baked them on a cooling rack, over a pan to catch the crumbs, but did not turn half way through.  The bottoms were not as crisp as the top, so I might do that next time, waiting to add the extra crumb/oil mixture until the cutlets are flipped.  Thanks!

Loved it!  I added a pinch of Italian salad dressing mix in the crumb mixture.  Also, I used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated, which for me worked just as well.  Super easy even for a not-so-accomplished cook like me!

I've been making essentially the same recipe for years and it has always been a favorite. I use butter instead of olive oil and add a tsp. dry mustard to the bread crumb mix. Awesome!

Pretty good.  I found the garlic pretty intense.  I am a garlic fan though.

This is very easy recipe, made 2 servings, used a little more garlic - only put some of crumbs on top and will not add next time as too dry, and for Weight Watcher - is 5 points and worth every poiny

This is quite a nice parmesan chicken. We added a bit a dash and extra garlic as to our taste. It is easy to make, and comes out tender and delicious every time.  It is easily a five star meal.  Thanks for sharing Paula Kamal

This recipe is awesome!  I used low fat margarine instead of olive oil and seasoned the chicken before breading it.  This will definately make our dinner recipe rotation!  Thanks :)

I made this a few times with italian seasoned bread crumbs and the powdery grated parmesan in the green can.  It was very good and easy that way.  But then last night I made this using crushed corn flakes to which I added my own italian seasonings and the grated parmesan that comes in the tubs.  It was fantastic!  So much crispier, and didn't get mushy on the bottom the way the bread crumbs did.

I thought this was ok, i made it using drumsticks and thighs might have been better made with breasts though. Not sure if I'll try this again.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make with ingredients most have on hand regularly.  I crushed up salad croutons for the bread crumbs which gave the coating a little extra garlic flavour.  Definitely will make this again.  Thanks for sharing Karen.

Delicious and quick recipie my boyfriend and I have enjoyed despite our hectic college life. For a better taste, replace olive oil with egg white, and top chicken with additional layer of parmesan before baking.

I cooked this chicken for dinner a couple weeks ago and it was okay. After all the great reviews I guess I expected it to be better. I also made it without reading a lot of reviews for it and quickly discovered (too late) that it called for way too much bread crumbs. It seemed to be missing something but couldn't figure out what.

Very tasty--used extra garlic and salt/pepper in dry mixture.  I had to bake for close to 50 minutes but very moist.  The only issue is that the bottom was a bit soggy but I don't think I'd want to turn over in the middle of the cook time.  Hmmmm....

This chicken was tasty. I used some Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic because thats what I had. I also ran out of bread crumbs so had to add some more with some more Parmesan. I also made some of the Really Creamy Fettucinne Alfredo from this site and everything turned out great! Definatly will make this again.

I actually was not impressed with this recipe after trying "My Mom's Parmesan Chicken." I also used the seasoned bread crumbs, but still found it to be dry and much less flavorful. Try "My Mom's" recipe for a much more moist alternative!!! Mmm, mmm!

This chicken was very moist and delicious.  I also used italian bread crumbs, as other members suggested.  If you are using thicker chicken breasts, it will take about 45 minutes to cook.  Try pounding the breasts thinner if you would like to cut cooking time down.

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing...I didn't have any basil leaves. Instead, I used a dash of Italian seasoning, and it still tasted wonderful. When it was almost done cooking, I topped it with tomato and sweet basil spaghetti sauce, mozzarella cheese, and sprinkled some parmesan on top and let it bake until the cheese melted. It came out wonderfully. The chicken was juicy, and had a great flavor. Will be a regular on my rotation.

Tasty, easy, good but not great.  I used panko instead of bread crumbs.  I sprayed the panko coating with canola oil and set the oven to broil in the last few minutes to give it the extra crispy crust that we love.  Four large breasts used all the oil and breading.  I also believe that the panko adheres better if you coat the breasts with a light flour then dip into egg.

My family loves this recipe.  I make this all the time.  I have made some changes.  I add a little more garlic and olive oil.  I also use flavored bread crumbs and more parmesan cheese to get the flavor.

absolutely amazing! I used Cheese & Garlic Flavored croutons as breading and it was fabulous. I still can't believe how tender the chicken was! This recipe is indeed a keeper!

Really moist.  Took tip from another reviewer & rubbed salt & pepper on chicken & let it rest at room temp for 5 mins or so while preparing/getting the other ingredients ready. Seemed to settle in & tasted good.

This is an amazing low fat, healthy meal.  There was a little bit too much breadcrumbs, so I double dipped everything twice and STILL had left overs.  The only thing that I changed was that I used fat free italian dressing instead of oil.  The italian dressing gave it some extra flavor and kept it really fat free.  enjoy!

Really really enjoyed this recipe. We eat alot of chicken so was looking for something different. There was not much preparation time and it was lovely on the outside and the chicken was tender on the inside. Really recommend this for something different with chicken!

This was a HUGE hit with my husband's family.  I did need to let it cook 45 minutes instead of 30 but that was the only adjustment I made.  A great recipe!

Yum! I liked this recipe a lot. I took Emma_Lou's recommendation and used pepperidge farm's stuffing mix and it was good. This is my new "go to" baked chicken recipe - perfect with mashed potatoes and veggies when you have dinner guests!!

YUM! My first recipe from this website and I was not dissappointed.  The only things I changed were that I added a dash or two of onion powder & garlic powder into the breading mixture, and instead of grated parmesan, I used shredded.  It's a tad more difficult to incorporate into the breading, but it gives it a really neat texture if you also pour the rest on top.

Thanks for the great idea and tasty dinner!

This dish is a favorite at my house. What I do to intensify the garlic flavor is use 2 large smashed garlic cloves and heat them in the olive oil in a small skillet. Make sure to remove the garlic before it browns and then dip the chicken in the olive oil. Really garlicy!

Tastes just like the chicken parm sandwiches I love.  I used chicken thighs because I had them on hand and 30 minutes in the oven made them perfectly tender.  Does anyone know the benefit to using olive oil instead of eggs?  I saw other recipe that used eggs prior to coating with the bread crumbs and I was just wondering the pros/cons of each.

We enjoyed this chicken. Quite good. I added string cheese but as you can see it did not melt very well. Besides that this recipe is a keeper.

Chicken was moist.  It went well with our leftover pasta and sauce.  I used italian bread crumbs and I thought it was very flavorful.

omigosh, this was so good. i thought this was the first time i followed this recipe, but apparently i had already reviewed it! this time around tasted so much better. i used 3 cloves of garlic, panko bread crumbs, added rosemary to it since that's all i had, and used thigh pieces cut in half. i baked at 350 for 35 minutes. what a great alternative to milk and egg batter. we love garlic, i may add more next time. i will also try topping with fresh parmesan and broiling for the last 5 minutes for extra crunchiness. i also want to try making popcorn chicken. thanks for the recipe, my 4 year old ate A TON!!

Definitely do NOT cover this dish, the breading ends up soggy. Flavor was nice, might add some marinara sauce and cheese next time for additional flavor.

Yummy!!!  I made this recipe according to the instructions and added a couple of extras. I put an extra clove of garlic in the oil and used italian seasonings from a grinder along with a dash of garlic salt in the crumbs.  I served it with prepared spahetti sauce and noodles. My son, who usually steers clear of chicken breasts, said that it "actually tasted good". I really enjoyed the recipe.

I just made this tonight and my family loved it!  It was quick and easy to make, a lot of the ingredients were in my kitchen already, not a lot of prep work, and came out moist, juicy and delicious.  I did have to use more olive oil than the recipe stated, and did have tons of extra breadcrumbs left.  I also lightly seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt, and used fresh garlic and shaved and grated parmesan.  The outcome was dee-lish!  Great recipe and now a part of our list of preferred menus.

I made this exactly as the recipe states except I added a little bit more fresh garlic.  This was ok, but honestly reminded me of a shake and bake.  The breading itself tasted great but the chicken was bland.  I think next time i make this I will first let the chicken marinate in the oil and garlic for a few hours and once breaded I will pan fry in some EVOO to get a nice crisp outside.

I think I must do something wrong when it comes to chicken and breadcrumbs... the breadcrumbs always seem to taste like sand to me.  I was disappointed with this recipe, but gave it three stars because I think I must have messed it up some how.

I made this for Fathers Day for my parents just loved this.  I will definitely make again.  I was never good at cooking chicken, but this was so so delicious and easy to make.

Good recipe! Very easy to make! I considered everyone's opinions and substitutions and here's what I did (and I only had approx. 3 T extra of the mixture left - which I sprinkled onto the chicken):

1/2 c of GOOD grated parmesan
1/2 c seasoned italian bread crumbs
1/2 t onion powder
1/2 t garlic powder
1/2 t italian seasoning
1/2 t ground black pepper
2 cloves minced garlic

I made sure 1.) mash the garlic into the oil - to release more of it's flavor into the oil and 2.) to rub the oil and garlic into the chicken breasts before I sprinkled the mixture onto them. It was delicious, moist and great with pasta and marinara sauce. Next time I make this chicken I'll partner it with alfredo! Delish!

I don't know why this one received such good reviews.  We've tried Garlic Chicken from this sight and loved it, so thought we would like this one also.   Definitely won't be making this one again.

UPDATE:  Tried again and used fresh grated parm but it did not melt. Best to use the powdered type instead. Still 5 stars for taste!
VERY delicious! The chicken was moist and very flavourful. This is the best Garlic Parmesan Chicken recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful chicken and very easy to prepare. I used Stovetop Stuffing and ground it to a powder. It added just the right amount of seasoning. Will make again.

This was excellent. I mocrowaved the garlic and the olive oil for about a minute. Then in another dish, I had breadcrumbs, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper - and parmesan flakes. I brushed the olive oil on, then dredged it in the dry mixture. I put it in a glass dish and baked it for 35 minutes. It was delicious!!  I really think the shaved parmasen adds to the flavoring! Thanks for the recipe!

I made a tomato sauce style Chicken Parm and used this recipe to prepare the chicken. I used both breasts and thighs (pounded thin), and the thighs turned out the best. I needed more of the garlic-oil than the recipe called for and used oregano along with the basil in the bread crumb mix. My family wants this again soon.

I'm not exactly sure If I reviewed this recipe yet, but I have to say that it is very delicious. My family and I love garlic, so it makes it extra yummy. The second time we made it, we did not have plain bread crumbs, so I had to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs - and it only got better. I have now memorized the recipe and I make it often! Keep cooking! ;o)

Tastes amazing! They breading didn't stick to well, but I'm willing to give the recipre the benefit of the doubt. That very well may have been my fault. Good recipe. Simple and good.

My kids never used to be such picky eaters, but all of a sudden they just are!  I made this recipe hoping I wouldn't have to ask them to eat 5 million times during dinner!  I got my wish because they chowed down!  They ate everything I gave them with out me asking them one time to eat, then asked for more!  We had one leftover chicken breast, in which they shared for lunch the next day!  It heated up very nicely in the oven!  Thank you!  This is a keeper and we'll make it often!

This was a good baked chicken. The coating was excellent but the chicken itself lacked  flavor, maybe adding salt to the olive oil/ garlic mixture would've helped. Overall a quick good meal. I served it with Jasmine rice.

I did change a few things to this one.  Instead of oil, I used one egg and about 2 tbs of melted butter.  I also added more garlic and Italian seasonings, per comments about it not having a lot of flavor.  It came out wonderfully, though I did have to bake about 10 minutes longer (and only cooked 3 breasts).  But, my BF LOVED it!!!  Thanks for another keeper!

Pretty good chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were nice and oist, and the breading had a nice flavor. However, they weren't amazing either; just regular chicken. I would make it again, though.

Quite good! Used the Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing as a another reviewer had suggested, but otherwise made according to the recipe. Very moist. I wil make again. Just needed a little more kick to give it a five.

This was terrific! I made this for my roommate and our boyfriends. The chicken was moist and delicious. I served it with mashed potatoes and a salad. I had to cook the chicken a little longer and I covered it with aluminum foil, but that's probably because of the high altitude. Thanks a great recipe!

my 12 year old made me promise to make this dish 100 million times!!!  
i must admit we love garlic so we increased the amount of cloves.  we also added more basil, pepper and added salt to the breadcrumb mixture.  this dish was soo yummy!!

My husband loved this. It was very tender and yummy.  I served over spaghetti using a mushroom sauce and it was fantastic. I will be making this again.

This is by far the best breaded chicken I have ever had. The first time I made it the bf raved, the second time I made it, I used powdered Parmesan instead of grated.  BIG mistake, WAY too salty, stick with the grated.

This one was okay. It needed a little something to make it less bland. Maybe a little salt. I'll definitely try it again but with modifications.

I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE RECIPE, THE CHICKEN SEEMED DRY WHILE COOKING SO I ADDED SOME BUTTER TO GET THE JUICES FLOWING. AFTER BAKING FOR 30  MINUTES THE BREAD CRUMBS ON TOP OF THE CHICKEN WAS TO CRUNCHY. NOT A FAVORITE WITH MY FAMILY.

This was mediocre at best. I added a cream sauce from cream of mushroom soup, peas, parmesan chesse, crushed garlic and milk. That was the good part and it is not even in this recipe.

Really easy and really delicious.  I don't like dry chicken so I usually check it at 20 min. to see how thoroughly it has cooked.  Then I check it again after  another 10 min.  The chicken is moist and juicy.

The chicken was very tender and moist.  Tips: Heat up the oil and garlic in the microwave for 20 sec to really bring out the garlic flavor. For faster cooking, bake at 375 then hike up the temp to 400 to finish it off. Saved me 10 min for 2 breasts.

I have a recipe that I have been using for a few years but decided to try this one because I didn't have any eggs available.  It was just as tender and tasty not to mention  easier to prepare.  I will use this recipe for chicken parm from now on.

This was easy and tastes good too.
I used italian seasoning and garlid powder since I had it handy. I combined it with a creamy sauce and noodles.

Besides some extra garlic, and warming the olive oil, I used seasoned bread crumbs and added some chopped pecans on top.

This was a big hit with my book club and so easy to make.

I thought it was wonderful. I'm new to this cooking thing so next time I make it I'm going to try something a little different. But as far as this recipe it was very good

Very good.  I made it with chicken tenders tonight and it was delicious.  I increased the garlic and olive oil as I had more pieces to dip and wanted more garlic flavor.  I also warmed the garlic/olive oil mixture in the microwave for about a minute to get the olive oil infused with the garlic first and let it cool before continuing.  Thanks for the recipe.

I thought that this had great flavor and was pleased - but I did make several changes.  First, I doubled the garlic and added 1 tablespooned melted butter to the olive oil. Then, after dipping in the bread crumb mix (which I added 1 tsp. oregano, and a pinch of salt) I browned the chicken about 10 minutes per side before baking in the oven.  After baking for 20 minutes, I added half a jar of marinara sauce and cooked for another 15 minutes.  Then, I topped each piece of chicken with some mozarella cheese and broiled for 5 minutes.  It turned out perfect and will definately make again!

This recipe is amazing!  I made it last night for 12 people and they all loved it.  Instead of plain bread crumbs I use garlic and herb, which I think increased the yumminess even more.

This chicken was easy and delicious! I had not even put it in the oven and my boyfriend kept saying how good it smelled. I added a little oregano based on what other reviewers said and that was it. Just perfect! One thing: I may not sprinkle the extra crumbing on top as it was not as crispy as I wanted it. Other than that, I will be making this again.

This turned out so yummy and looked wonderful on the plate.  It was so easy to make.
After trying a recipe as written I usually feel the need to "tweek" here and there, but not this one.  It's perfect just the way it's written.

This was good, and luckily I read the other reviews to learn the chicken was not seasoned.    it was super easy.  I used stove top stuffing and it make it much quicker since that was all I had handy.  Will definately make this again!

I made this dish the other night for my fiance and his friend (they are both Italian) and they loved it. I didn't change much except I put minced garlic and garlic powder in with the olive oil mixture and I think next time I will brown the top a little but all in all it was perfect. I served it with speghetti and garlic bread.

This was good.  Not "knock my socks off" good, but good.  Will make it again with spaghetti and red sauce though.  Had it with coucous and it left something to be desired.

Good with changes.  I had three large chicken breast so cut them in half and pounded out.  Marinated in Italian dressing for a couple of hours as recommended by another review.  Combined Panko crumbs and Italian bread crumbs for the topping--plus seasonings.  I did add as much of the extra crumb mixture before baking.  I didn't just sprinkle on top, I patted it into the breast.

This is very good chicken-I've made it twice already!  The first time I made it, I had to cook it for about 25 minutes longer than directed.  The second time I cooked it at 375 degrees for 40 minutes and it was perfect.  I didn't have garlic cloves on hand, so I used garlic powder and it still turned out great!  Thanks!

Fantastic recipe!  I just made this last night.  I did make some changes like adding oregano to the bread mix, and melted mozzarella on top.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

I made this exact, it was yummy, BUT it could use a little more flavor in the bread crumbs, I also used italian bread crumbs,and noticed it still needs more flavor. But yummy.

We enjoyed this recipe a great deal.  It was very easy to make (and quick!) and very tasty.

I had this over pasta with sauce, while my husband had it as a chicken parm sandwich.  After baking it, we put the chicken on a roll, topped with a few slices of mozzarella cheese, and broiled the sandwich for a few minutes.

We also baked the chicken for only 20 minutes, since we had three breasts.

Thank you for posting!!

This recipe is so wonderful!  I'm on a special diet (can't have the breadcrumbs), so I just use more parm cheese and basil, and I mince two garlic cloves for the oil.  My husband LOVES it...he asked me to make it twice last week alone!  Thank you so much!  Oh, chicken only needs to be cooked for 20 minutes.

Thank you, Karen, for sharing this delicious chicken dish.  It is very quick and easy to prepare.  The flavor is awesome and the chicken is very tender and juicy.  I serve it with pasta and a green vegetable and could not hope for a better meal.  My husband asks for it at least twice a month.

This makes a great chicken!  I served it on spaghetti noodles and then put a marinara sauce on top.  So good!  But the recipe does make a lot of crumb mixture and I had to throw out half of it.  Next time I would half the crumb mixture recipe.

Absolutely a great recipe!  So quick and easy, it leaves more time for me to play with my son.  My husband loved it also, he took the leftovers for his lunch the next day.  Will definately make this again.  Thanks

I doubled the garlic, but left everything else the same. I felt like it needed salt, and found the flavor much improved after adding garlic salt. The chicken was very moist, but the breading was a little mushy underneath.

This made for a easy and good weeknight dinner at my house recently.  I used crushed italian seasoned crutons for the bread crumbs.  Before breading them, I pounded all the chicken breasts to be thinner and to ensure that they were all about the same thickness.  Baked up great!

I tried this recipe out because it looked really easy- and it was! I actually made it with mozarella cheese instead of parmesan, because it was all I had, and it turned out just fine. Apparantly I made it with much thicker chicken breasts than the recipe called for, because it actually took a whole hour instead of 30 minutes. I was surprised how juicy it came out. It was a little bland on the inside however, so I'm going to try it again, but with marinated chicken instead.

Easy to make and tastes really good. I made this without any changes. My wife enjoyed this as well. The first thing I noticed about this was how moist the chicken turned out. I did have to bake a little longer because the chicken breast I had were thicker.

This dish is really easy to make and it turned out to be so good! But just a word of caution: if you use small chicken breasts, make sure that the cooking time is not too long as this will dry out the meat.

this came out very delicious.  I think my chicken breasts may have been too big cause I had to cook it longer than posted.  Which in the end, made it a bit dry.. but the coating of seasons was great!  Very simple and I didn't have to get any other ingredients.  Thanks!

My whole family gave this recipe the thumbs up!  I had more chicken breasts than could fit into a 9x13 pan, so I just made sure that I had enough oil (and pre-chopped garlic in the jar) to coat each piece.  Then I crushed 3/4 of a sleeve of Club crackers and mixed with a generous amount of Parmesan cheese and the spices.  Dry ingredients were put into a baggie and chicken pieces were coated easily by shaking.  Baked under foil for almost a half hour, then remove foil for the last few minutes to 'crispy' it up.  Looks wonderful, tastes delicious and is good enough to serve to company.

This chicken was great! I took the advice from others and marinated the chicken in Italian dressing hours before. I also used Italian bread crumbs and the chicken was full of flavor.

Clearly, this one is simple as 3-2-1...I sliced each semi-frozen chicken breast into 4 tenders, used only a shake or two of bread crumbs and lots of Johnny's Great Caesar Garlic Spread and Seasoning (mmmmmmmmmm), grated parm, the basil and some other spices and baked for a total of 26 minutes. Served it over tossed blue cheese salad with big fat croutons and a bottle of cheap red wine. Not bad!

When I made this recipe, I used bone-in thighs.  The flavor was great, but I thought overall it was too heavy and greasy.  The olive oil really stands out (and I used 4 cloves of garlic!) so next time I might try a lighter, but still healthy oil, like grapeseed.  I will also make it again, but with breasts next time.  The drier cut of meat might marry a lot better with the oil.  I gave the recipe four stars for the great flavor of the breading/oil combination and the ease of preparation.

i live with 5 other guys... and this was the most amazing dish any of them have tasted. So as my first review it's an easy meal that any palette will like. Fettucini alfredo makes a great side.

Very nice and tasty.  Recipe is easily halved.  Goes nice with some rice pilaf and green beans.  A quick and simple weekday dish.

These were really really good once they were cooked!!  I think maybe 400F might be a better temperature.  Chicken at 350F just never works for me.

This was simple and delicious! I was expecting the chicken to be dry and bland, but it was just the opposite! Great weeknight recipe for sure.

I did everything the way I was supposed to, but my chicken came out very dry.  What am I doing wrong?  I didn't overcook, because it was still pinkish 5 minutes befoer I took it out.

This recipe is so easy to make and my whole family loves this meal.  I like to pound out thick chicken breasts to make them a little flatter, and most of the ingredients are already on hand.  Excellent recipe!!

Very good for a quick & easy meal....and while it's in the oven for 30 minutes, it allows you to prepare your side dishes.  I used less bread crumbs and more parmesan than what the recipe called for and added about a half cup of broth to the casserole dish to keep it from drying out.

used crushed crackers instead of breadcrumbs, also added a bit of italian seasoning to the mix as well as salt. instead of oil I used melted butter. I have used both oil & butter and find the butter tastes better. Cover with foil & it is super juicy. Everyone loves it in my family!

A easy & tasty recipe!  I've made it twice and both times I seemed to have a lot of the bread crumb mixture left over, so I'll probably make a little less of that in the future...otherwise, it's great!

This is a very quick and easy and tasty recipe.  I scaled back the serving size to two and used chicken breast filets.  They were good and juicy.  It worked very well.

My DS and I liked it.  My DH and DD did not so it only gets three stars.  I thought the flavor was good but my daughter said it didn't taste right.  And she really isn't a picky eater.  My son is and he ate it.

A big hit.  Next time I am going to use stuffing instead of bread crumbs.  That way it should do the job of the crumbs and give a smidge of flavor.

This recipe is awesome!  I can't cook and this was so easy.  I used parsley instead of basil as it's what I had on hand.  I also used 3 breast with rib meat instead of 6 breasts.  Cooked with a meat thermometer until at poultry temp (~190 degrees) and then checked for no pink.  EXCELLENT!  Great reheats. Whole family enjoyed.

So quick and easy!! I added a couple of pre sliced jalapenos to the oil and garlic to kick it up a bit. I was amazed how good it tasted with it being so easy!!! I can't wait to make it again.

Great!  Juicy chicken (I DID use a digital thermometer so they wouldn't overcook), yummy coating.  Next time I won't add the extra breadcrumbs to the baking dish (just a little gritty).

Wow, I LOVE this recipe.  It's simple, easy and tastes fantastic.  It will be a repeat for sure.  I tend to use a LOT of garlic in my cooking.  I made sure there was a good bit of minced garlic between the chicken and the bread coating.  I am salivating just thinking about it.

My two boys loved the chicken (in the words of Alexei, "Delicious!"), however, my more sophisticated ;) tastebuds wished for something with a little more zest.  I will be making this meal again bc the boys loved it, but I'm not totally won over myself.

This was very easy and tasty.  I did put the extra breadcrumbs on top, but that was too mcuh, will skip that step next time.  I added more garlic and will add some more spices to the mix next time.  Will definitely try again.

i did not enjoy this recipe, although easy to prepare, it's flavor was odd, and it was very dry.  The coating did not adhere well.  My husband ate it, but said it wasn't something he would want again.
