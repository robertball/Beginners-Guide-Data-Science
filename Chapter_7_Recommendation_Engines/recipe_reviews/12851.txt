This is a great basic tuna noodle recipe.  However, I made a few changes I believe made it even better.  First, I cooked the noodles a couple of minutes less than the package calls for, so after baking they will not be overdone.  I added a can of mushrooms, and an additional can of soup (either mushroom or celery) to make it creamier and it set up fine.  I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp. because there is salt in the potato chips and sodium in the soup.  I figure eaters can always add, but cant take away.  I also added 1 1/2 c. peas to the soup mixture at the same time as the noodles, being careful not to mash.  I used Mozerella cheese instead of American.  And the leftovers are even better!  This is a keeper.

Hi this is Chris and this is my recipe. We're thrilled so many people like it and add whatever items that suit your family's tastes. We use the 98% fat free soups, 2% milk, and shell macaroni  because the sauce fills in the little cup shape. If we have fresh mushrooms we add a few. Couple Tbls fresh celery adds a nice texture. One son likes extra cheese so in one corner we put more there. Use the recipe as the base, add what you like, you can't go wrong.

This recipe is fantastic. I made 3 changes though. Instead of American cheese, I used 8 oz of shredded Sharp cheddar, I used reduced calorie cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom (my husband hates mushrooms) and I cut the salt in half. To be honest, you could probably get rid of the salt entirely since tuna and cheese are both pretty salty. My boyfriend does not normally eat or enjoy "comfort food" LOVED this recipe. A++, 5 stars, a real winner!

Awesome recipe!!!  I decided to make it exactly as written the first time and make any changes I thought it needed next, except I did use 6 slices of cheese instead of 4.  It is so perfect the way it is I would not change a thing!  I also used the 98% fat free soup. My hubby can be very picky and he had two huge servings, I couldn't stop eating it and my 2-year-old loved it too.  And it was so easy to make and impossible to mess up.  It will definitely be part of our regular rotation.  Thanks Chris, for posting this delicious, easy and inexpensive recipe!***UPDATE***When I re-heated the leftovers(and there were a lot), the potato chips got soggy.  Now I only top 1/2 with chips and add fresh ones before re-heating leftovers.

I loved this recipe, but I changed so much in it, I didn't give 5 stars because I almost made up a different recipe!  I used 1 can cream of mushroom, 2 cans cream of chicken, and 2 cups milk, since many said it was dry.  I used whole wheat egg noodles, instead of shells and cooked them for 5 minutes, so they were a little under done.  I added 1 bag of frozen broccoli florets (peas would be great also!) to the last 2 minutes of the pasta cooking, so they would thaw quickly.  I added 1 4oz can of mushrooms, 2 ribs of celery finely chopped, the tops of 3 green onions, 1 tsp of white pepper and garlic powder, and no salt. I used 8 slices of American cheese. Instead of using chips, I used the same amount of crushed croutons, which I microwaved with 1 pat of butter to coat before I put them on the casserole. I only cooked it for 20 minutes, then shut off the oven and left it for 10 more. It turned out wonderfully!

Usually, tuna casserole will come out dry (or mushy) if you overcook the noodles, or add too many extra things without adding extra liquid.

My two biggest regret making this dish is that I can't give it negative stars and it was a waste of two perfectly good cans of tuna.

We really liked this easy tuna noodle casserole recipe.  I used low-fat soups, skim milk, reduced-fat cheese, and crackers instead of potato chips, and it was delicious.  I also added frozen peas and a can of sliced mushrooms.  The recipe makes so much...as much as we enjoyed it last night, we have plenty of leftovers today.

Easy, great tasting casserole!  My husband said a total of 5 times how good it was.  
I made a couple of minor changes...I used a can of healthy select cr. of chicken soup b/c I didn't have cr. of celery and my cr. of mushroom was roasted garlic flavor(I omitted the crushed garlic).  I also added a small can of mushrooms and used seasoned stuffing instead of potato chips for extra flavor.  I did omit the salt, but will use a little next time.  Thanks for the great recipe:)

This was simple and great. I added 1/2 cup monterey jack shredded cheese, 1 box thawed frozen peas, a can of mushroom pieces and stems, and sprinkled Panko with butter bread crumbs over the top before baking. The family loved it.

This is a really good tuna noodle casserole...the cheese really adds a unique spin!  I didn't have any potato chips so I added bread crumbs, but the next time I will be sure to either have the chips or maybe even Ritz crackers...that would be tasty. *** UPDATE *** I made it again and added about 1 cup of cheddar cheese mixed in and it really added to the flavor.  I also didn't put the chips on, but the top started to dry out a little so I will probably put ritz crackers on top the next time.  When I tried it with potato chips (I've tried it 3 times now), the chips were soggy the next day and were gross.

It always cracks me up when people rate the recipe and say but here are all the things I changed.  Well, I didn't change anything and can tell you as printed, it is what it says it is.  A traditional, old-fashioned 1950's tuna casserole.  A little bland, but that is why we grew up with the salt and pepper shakers...lol.  My family of 6, including one picky rater, one teenager, two 2 y/o, and a somewhat tired husband after a long day at work all ate this without complaint.  4 of the 6 even said, "good dinner".  So, I will be keeping it around.  No, it's not gourmet...but it is good comfort food and we didn't have any leftovers.

I used bread crumbs on top... I think chips will be better so I'll try that next time.  Otherwise everyone liked it.

I halved the recipe and added a flavorful zip. I added all of the following to our edition: 4oz Velveeta cut into cubes, 2 cups uncooked elbow noodles, 1cup milk, 1 can cream of mushroom,1 can cream of broccoli (use your favorite cream soups), 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar-mixed in, 1 can tuna, 1 tsp. tomato basil seasoning, 1 tsp. onion onion seasoning, 1 tsp. garlic, 1 tsp. pepper, 1/4 cup Kraft Zesty light Italian dressing, 1 pkg frozen mixed veggies (gives the casserole a nice color too), added crushed townhouse crackers to the top and drizzled butter over the cracker crumbs and baked...de-licious! My husband loved it!! Very rich and creamy. With all the additions this was far from bland! Even by cutting the recipe in half we had leftovers for work the next day! You can just have fun with this recipe and make it your own. I would use this recipe just as a nice base for your personal touch according to your familie's likes and dislikes.

Great classic tuna noodle casserole. The exact way it should taste. Add extra can of cream of mushroom or whatever flavor soup--otherwise too dry. Also, I added about two cups chopped broccoli and extra cheese and used egg noodles. Used garlic powder instead--- was delicious! Will make again. Oh-- you can skip the step of heating everything before putting it into the baking dish-- the hot noodles warm everything (soup, etc.) and the oven makes it piping hot.

This was okay.  I think it may have been better if I didn't cook the whole package of noodles in one pan.  They were smooshy and lumped together.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom.  I don't think I will be making this again.  No one ate it and had to throw the rest out.  Big waste of food.  Especially since that was the last soup/meat/noodles we had for a week.

This was wonderful!  I used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup (didn't have Cream of Celery - yuck anyway), added a few defrosted peas in, extra can of tuna, used whole milk, topped with dried bread crumbs drizzled with melted butter.  So good.  If you really like yours with more creaminess, just add another can of soup and a bit more milk!  Typically I only give at most 3 stars for such a common dish, but this one deserved the 4 stars.

Absolutely horrible... for my diet! LOL  My only 2 substitutes were: two cans of mushroom because I didn't have any cream of celery on hand. I used Celerey salt instead of regular salt to make up for the missing celery taste.

It was the best tasting tuna noodle casserole I've ever had. My entire family gobbled it down!

Next time, I will try the low fat variety soups, milk and cheese.

I added peas, and it tasted just like my mom used to make! My husband had been turned off of tuna noodle casserole by his brother, who was married to a woman that made it 5 nights a week (can you imagine?!) so he was skeptical; after tasting it, he wanted to make sure there were enough leftovers so he could take it in his lunch!

Great recipe! The second time I made it, I added some shredded cheddar cheese to the mix, one extra 'cream of' soup and a small bag of frozen peas & carrots. Delicious!

I wish there was a way to comment on other people's reviews! Some people...

My husband gave this 10 stars!!  Because others stated the potato chips got soggy, I used crushed crackers and french fried onions.  Also, used cheddar cheese.  Going in the "make again file."

Meh.  This was okay.  I added frozen broccoli, another can of tuna, another can of condensed soup, some celery, and more cheese.  It was pretty bland, and I think without those additions it would have been even worse.  If you think you'll have leftovers, add the potato chips to the portions that you'll eat now - as someone else mentioned, they get soggy and gross in the fridge.

Good recipe.  Basic and satisfying.  I was looking for a recipe that had mostly pantry items and this did the trick.  You can make as is or dress it up.  I added frozen peas to mine and it was great.  Will make again.

Made this per hubby's request, as i am not a big tuna noodle casserole fan.  Used 2  cans cream of mushroom soup, and no cream of celery. Added mushrooms,  onions, and peas.  Didn't have chips so used crushed butter crackers mixed w/shredded cheddar cheese for topping.  Hubby and 2 yrs old liked it - so will be making again. To me, it tasted like tuna noodle casserole. :)

This is pretty good. The crushed chips overpowered it for me. The next time I used crushed crackers. That was more to my liking, but it is an easy basic recipe.

I made a few changes - used cream of chicken in place of the cream of celery soup, substituted cheddar cheese for the American cheeese, cut out the salt entirely, and used less garlic.  Overall a great base to start with as noted by others.  LOVED it!

Good hearty meal.  I used three cans of tuna, and could not think of using less. I also used two cups of frozen peas, and I will cut that down to one cup next time. To thaw the peas, I just simply added them to the boiling egg noodles (I like better than shells for this) for a couple minutes. Make sure you cook your noodles slightly less than al dente so that they are perfect after baking.  You will need 6 slices of cheese to properly cover and my preference is no chips on top. Finally, to help guard against drying out, I covered my dish with foil for the first 15 minutes of baking, then uncovered for the final 15 minutes so that the top gets that delicious baked-on crispness but leaves the rest moist.

DON'T prepare this one unless you're ready to eat the whole pan!!  My family doesn't care for tuna, but I doubled the recipe and there wasn't a spoonful left.  Excellent, easy recipe (not to mention delicious!)  Shame on you Chris!  I'll probably gain 10 pounds with this one! :)

I hated tuna casserole as a kid, but my sister made one recently and it was delicious.  This is the best one I found so far.  I omitted the salt; canned soups have a lot of sodium in them and so does cheese.  I added approximately 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas and used grated sharp cheddar cheese instead of the processed American cheese, which I don't care for.  Dad had 2 helpings and my oldest son had 3 helpings.  Thanks Chris for this easy delicous recipe.

I have made this for my family a few times now and each time they clamor for more. Than you so much. I do have to say I don't usually have cream of celery soup on hand but I so usually have celery so I add 2 tins of soup and a stalk of celery. I think it is about the same.

The cream of celery in this made it smell and (if I knew what it taste like this would be it) taste like dog food. So be sure to use cream of mushroom x2 with this. Also it would taste a lot better if you added cooked onion, mushrooms, broccoli or peas, and some more spices. The cheese should be doubled as well. The chips on top are nice though.

I thought this pretty bland, even after adding additional spices. However, I think it is better the next day, so I would actually give it a 3 1/2 stars.

This is the first tuna casserole I've made. I could not bring my self to use processed cheese or chips, I used marble cheese and crushed corn flakes. It was very good!

I made just a few minor adjustments.  I used wide egg noodles, added frozen peas, used about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and instead of potato chips I crumbled ritz crackers on top.  So easy to make and impossible to mess up.  This recipe is comfort food at its best.

This was perfect for a "mom's too busy to cook/bake" dinner!  Our not-too-experienced 11 yr. old daughter made this with flare!!  She also threw an additional 1/2 cup of french fried onions on top, because she loves them!  It was REALLY good!  (we also added about 1/2 cup sliced, sauteed mushrooms.  We omitted the soup + milk +spices in the pot +warm them up step...  Why dirty an additional pot?  She just stirred it into the drained noodles!  Came out great & only 2 dishes to clean afterward.  Smart girl, huh?)

Wonderful!  I used low fat soup, skim milk, and 2% milk american and instead of crushed potato chips I sprinkled 2% shredded sharp cheddar on top.  I also used penne pasta and added a dash of nutmeg and parsley to tuna mixture.  My family loved it.  Very comforting and filling.  Use fresh minced garlic for sure.  Excellent!

Awesome "homestyle" recipe.  Easy & delcious.  I used medium shell pasta and also added a stalk of chopped celery and a few sliced mushrooms (I pre-cooked in a Tbsp. of butter before adding).  I also added an additional 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup that I had leftover.  I split recipe into two square pans instead of cooking one 9x13.  I froze one unbaked for a future meal.  Kids ate it well and loved that it had crushed potato chips on top.

This was a very good recipe. My family like veggies, so I added some fresh, sweet, snow peas and a few chopped carrots. Even my 4 year old ate it, and she is a VERY picky eater! Thank you for the great idea!

This recipe was really good, but I altered it a little.  Used 2 cans of fat free cream of mushroom soup instead of one can cr. mush and one can cr. celery.  I also skipped the potato chips on top.  I will definitely make it again because it reheats really well for lunch the next day.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I made this dish with my Mom growing up so it has lots of comfort factor. I lost my Mom to cancer when I was 20. Now that I'm married with kids I am trying to recreate many of my childhood favorites. Since I can't remember many of her recipes I have searched online and this one is by far the closest tuna casserole to the one I remember except we used egg noodles as a child. Thank you for posting and helping me share a bit of my childhood with my 7&8yr old girls!

This recipe is so easy and was a huge hit- especially with the picky teenage boys. Thank everything. I used sharp cheddar rather than American cheese and I think it make it richer than it would have otherwise. I liked it.

This casserole was really good.  I skipped the salt and used bread crumbs instead of potato chips.  I also added frozen peas and it was delicious.  I used cream of broccoli soup since that was all I had in the cupboard.  It's nice that you can alter this recipe to your tastes and it still ends up tasting good.

used the basic recipe, but because of reviews, added pre-cooked onion and celery, topped with left over dried onion i had left over from green bean casserole recipe. Wonderful, served with broiled garlic bread.  Will make again, trying potato chips

This was good, I did alter the recipe a bit.  I added dried minced onion, and put a small layer of mozzerella cheese on top (really yummy). My boyfriend, who was aprehensive about tuna casserole went back for seconds!

I was feeling under the weather today and wanted some comfort food that wasn't going to take a lot of energy or effort to make.  I did make a few changes based on what I had in the house at the time. Used whole wheat pasta shells, added corn and peas, only used cream of mushroom soup, used real shredded sharp cheddar cheese (processed cheese just freaks me out) and instead of potato chips, used a light sprinkling of breadcrumbs.  Definitely made me feel a bit better (just something about making a casserole) and even though I halfed the recipe, still have a TON of leftovers.

I just made this last week and it went over pretty well. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used 2 cans of mushroom soup, halved the salt, used minced garlic and added 1 can of mushrooms, 2 cups each frozen peas and frozen corn. I used shredded Sharp cheddar instead of American and mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients. I didn't heat up the milk etc., just mixed it with the hot pasta. Used baked potato chips for lower fat. This recipe makes a TON, so plan accordingly. Leftovers hold up well too.

This was quite a pleasant tuna casserole.  Not fine dining for sure, but I don't think tuna casserole usually is!  I halved the recipe, using one can of cream of celery soup and shredded cheddar in place of the cheese slices and also on top instead of chips.  Also mixed in peas.  Will make again but may mix in some sour cream or an extra can of soup , we would have liked a bit more sauce.

Great recipe.  Used a lot f the review suggestions.  Added carrots and peas, the extra can of mushroom soup, and used crackers instead of chips.  I used rigatone for the noodles because it was what I had on hand.  It was really awesome how the sauce and peas managed to get on the inside of the noodles.  Tasted really great and my boyfriend just loved it.

This is delicious. My kids normally do not like tuna casserole but they loved this. I used the French Fried Onions instead of potato chips since others suggested the potato chips get soggy. Yummy!

HELP! I don't know what went wrong! I scaled this recipe for 8 people.  I used fat free ingredients and fettucini noodles.  When I mix the sauce and heated it, it was to die for delicious, but when I mixed it and cooked it for 50min; it was so dry and tasteless.  I don't know, could it have been that the noodles were to thick, and they absorbed the cream sauce? can anyone help me with this? I would like to try it again!

Delicious!  I only changed a few things, I added peas, mushrooms and an additional can of soup.  It was delicious! I'll be making this again!

This is pretty good.  I go crazy with the pepper and garlic, use real cheese instead of the processed stuff, throw in a cup of frozen chopped veggies, and omit the crushed potato chips because they go soggy the next day.  It's also salty enough without needing to add more.

This was excellent. My husband, a big tuna noodle casserole fan, gave it enthusiastic thumbs up. I added fresh thyme and used grated cheddar instead of American slices; I also used reduced fat soups and it still tasted great.

This is one of the moistest, tastiest tuna casseroles I have tried.  Even my picky 6 year old loved this one, and so did my teenagers.  This one also warms up well.

I also tried this one with a package of frozen egg noodles, for variety, and my family loved it.

I needed something quick to make.  Turned out really great.  I was out of potato chips and substituted bread crumbs instead.  Would make again.

I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of slices and cream of chicken soup because I didn't have cream of celery and french's onions on top because I didn't have chips.  My husband said it was the best casserole ever and even ate it for breakfast.

I'm giving 4 stars because the family liked it but I didn't.  It was too dry for me.  Next time I would add more milk or another can of soup.  Probably would use cr. chicken instead of celery soup, too.  I did add the regular potato chips, but I didn't like the flavor of them with the casserole.  I would probably use bread crumbs or panko with it next time.  I also think adding mushrooms would be delish next time.  I should have put chips on only half of it, because they did get soggy.  I also think sharp cheddar would be better than american cheese, because there would be more flavor.  I did add some freshly grated sharp to the tuna-soup mixture, to let it melt and flavor, but apparently not enough to make a difference in the entire casserole.  Adding the american cheese layer in the middle was a good idea, something I would do another or do with a cheddar layer.  I think some grated cheddar over the top would taste well, too.  Thank you for a recipe that can definitely be tweaked to suit individual and family tastes.  With some changes, it will be a part of our monthly rotation.

this is a GREAT recipe. I made it last night and everyone loved it, even my daughter who was a little skeptical at first about the cheese.
However I made a couple of changes, just for personal taste. I really don't like american cheese (sorry) so I used half mozarella and half mild cheddar cheese (grated) and instead of potato chips I used french fried onions

Delicious, classic casserole! The only thing I'll change for next time is the potato chips. They seemed to get soggy and add sort of a greasy, unpleasant texture. A simple subsitute of french fried onions (my favorite on tuna casserole!), or breadcrumbs should do the trick.

This is overall a good recipe.  I added additional seasonings after mixing the tuna with the soup to meet our taste as it seemed a little bland.  I mixed about 1 cup of shredded cheese to the mixture instead of layering as called for in the recipe as others mention.  I also added peas and onion, but the crushed potato chips on top made the casserole!!! I will be keeping this one for a quick weekday dinner.

A simple, quick, fantastic recipe.  I tweaked it to my family's taste; hubby loves peas (and I grew up with them in my tuna casserole) so I added a bag of frozen baby peas.  I used egg noodles instead of shells simply because it's what I grew up on so I prefer it.  We don't care for mushrooms, so I used 2 cans of cream of celery.  I also didn't have the garlic, so I omitted it.  I followed another reviewers advice and didn't use the extra pot, just added the stuff to the egg noodles and it was fine.  It turned out great!  My hubby had 2 big plates of it (so did I) and then my dad and brother took the leftovers home with them.  My dad later told me that he loved it.  We all thought the potato chips on top were a great touch.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!  I'll make it again and again!

I cooked this last night. The only changes I made to the recipe was that I added a bag of frozen carrots and peas and I also layered with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I turned out great; a simple dish that tastes great.

Great & tasty - as far as tuna noodle casseroles go.  My kids loved it and they can be picky eaters.  Try using Utz brand salt & pepper potato chips on top - it adds great flavor and a nice crunch!

As far as tuna noodle casserole goes, this one is good.  I used sea shell noodles, cut the salt in half, used cheddar instead of the processed stuff, and added a can of mushrooms and freshly sliced celery.  The celery stays crunchy, but I liked the crunch and I also liked the potato chip topping.

I grew up on tuna noodle casserole so now I don't eat it!  However, my husband loves it so I made it just for him and he loved it.  I left out the garlic and cheese because neither of us grew up with those items in our casseroles.  I did add some sauteed celery - now I have to make extra for my brother-in-law since my husband loved it so much!

I made this and it was great right out of the oven.  But then the leftovers were not good because the chips had become soggy.  I took off the chips and rewarmed the leftovers and it was good again.  My husband dosen't like tuna casserole so for me the leftovers has to be tremendously wonderful. I would leave off the chips next time and add some peas.

My husband and I both enjoyed this quick and easy to make recipe.  After the quick assembly, it bakes in no time because it's already warm (and assembly time allows the oven to heat up!).  Watch out, if you're a newbie cook like me, you'll probably use an excessive number of pots the first time, there's a lot to mix.  We did make a few modifications: added peas, substituted chedder for American, used breadcrumbs instead of chips (didn't have any, but will have to try), tri-color rotini instead of shells (we felt they really took up the sauce well), and used low-sodium soups (per another reviewer's suggestion; we tend to salt our food enough anyway).  He's not a huge fan of fish, but will eat tuna salad; this was a perfect amount for him, not too tuna-y, but still enough for me.  Make sure you keep the noodles al dente as they continue to take up moisture while baking.

I made a few modifications to the original recipe by using grated pepper jack cheese instead of sliced american and cream of asparagus soup instead of the cream of celery.  The results are exactly as promised...my only concern is the amount of sodium in this recipe.  I think next time I'll use low sodium soup and omit the potato chips.

Whole family loved it, even my daughter who is notorious for not liking casseroles!  I added some chopped onion & celery and grated sharp cheddar instead of the slices, along with an extra layer of cheese under the potato chips.  Definite keeper!

I actually only tasted this while I was making it and never got to taste the finished product, but it was pretty good!!!  I added extra garlic because it tasted a little bland.  Next time I'll buy the cream of mushroom with garlic in it.

Yummy casserole!  I am a vegetarian and added edamame (shelled soy beans found in your grocers freezer).  They are similar to peas but even better for you.  I also did 1/2 of the cheese mozzerella and the other half cheddar which was a nice variation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

A great recipe. Second time I made it, I used dried linguine, broken into fourths plus some frozen green beans. Had to use a larger baking dish. Still fantastic !

This is a winner! I used Extra Sharp Cheddar the second time around, & added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the soup mixture. Gave it a little extra punch!! We'll have this often.

This is just like the one I make, however I do not use the cream of celery or the garlic. I use a box of kraft mac and cheese, cream of mushroom, salt, pepper, (for my family that loves left over casserole) I use two large cans of tuna and two large cans of soup. Plus I add a cup of shredded cheese; whatever kind you like, we like it cheesy, and a can of peas drained and add last so they don't get mashed, then 10 minutes before its done add the crushed potatoe chips or what ever you have on hand. I have used crushed croutons, saltine crackers, ritz crackers,etc.  Play with it and you will find the flavor you like. Just remember that when using potatoe chips be easy with the salt because like someone else said you can always add not take it out.
Good luck and have fun with this. This is also a good recipe to start out teaching you kids to cook.  I learned this in high school during Home Economics class.

I loved this recipe, it took me back to my childhood.  My mom would make this dish but used egg noodles instead of pasta shells.  I loved using the pasta shells.  I followed the recipe only with very minor changes.  I added onion powder, parsley and a crazy salt mix instead of just regular salt.  My boyfriend loved it and I will definitely be making this again.  In fact, I passed this recipe on to a few co-workers who love tuna casserole!  ENJOY!!

This is a good recipe, however, it was a little dry for my taste.  Next time I will use three cans of soup or maybe a few less noodles.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as indicated. 

While it was good, it was FAR too dry for my taste and my husband agreed 100%!  When I re-heated it to serve the next day, I added 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of half-n-half. When I make it again, I'll add some half-n-half and cut the amount of shells in half.

My family loved this!  We usually buy the boxed tuna helper stuff and I decided to try homemade instead.  I am so glad I used this recipe!
I did add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup because I read a few of the reviews first that suggested that.  I'm glad I added it because it might have been too dry had I not.  I used an 8 ounce package of shredded sharp cheddar instead of the cheese slices.  And since I didn't have any garlic I used garlic powder.  
It turned out great!  I also didn't have potato chips so we didn't do that part of the recipe but I would like to try that next time because I'm sure it adds to it.  
Will definitely be making this again!

Very yummy!  After reading the reviews I added in some additional ingredients (can of mushrooms, splash of Worcestershire, onion powder, cup of peas) and substituted the cream of celery with a 2nd cream of mushroom.  The result was very good, will definitely make this again.

This turned out to be a great recipe! I skipped out on the chips and added mushrooms to the tuna mixture and it was great! 

Also, I live in a different country and let's just say the tuna they sell here is a little different.  When I got home and opened the can, it turned out to be tuna in a tomato sauce with onions! Because of the time, I had no choice but to use it and it turned out wonderful! It added a delicious flavor that every loved!

I'd give this only 4 out 5 stars because it had a few modifications. I used wide egg noodles and boiled only 6 minutes from other recommendations.  I added celery salt as a seasoning.  Also,  rather than American cheese, I used approx 1 cup of colby jack cheese; 1/2 cup in between noodle layers and another 1/2 cup on the top underneath a layer of bread crumbs. (I would have used chips if I had any, that sounds yummy!)  Overall, it turned out delicious and is the perfect comfort food.  I highly recommend!

Growing up my father would make almost the same excluding the cheese.  People always tought I was crazy for adding potato chips but its the salty and crunch that it needs!  YUMMY and great memories too :)

We make this recipe a lot.  I follow the recipe pretty closely, however, I top the casserole with breadcrumbs as opposed to potato chips.  I also use skim milk and healthy heart soup.  Great recipe!

The kids thought that this recipie was great, and they're not generally fans of casseroles, so that is saying somthing. I left the chips off of the top and instead topped with a little bit of mozzarella cheese. I don't know what it is about crumb-style toppings on casserole dishes, but my kids refuse to eat them *sigh*.  We liked this recipie quite a bit and will be making it a regular part of our recipie rotation. Yum!

Kids and hubby liked it. I added peas for colour and since they nest nicely in the pasta shells. I used bread crumbs instead of potato chips on top and grated cheddar instead of slices. All in all easy and good. Made lots too.

This is my all time favorite tuna casserole.  I always use chedder cheese instead of American just for personal preferance. Even my picky little 2 year old daughter will eat it.
Thanks for the great recipe.

My mom made this recipe for my 3 very picky sons and they loved it. The only thing she added was a can of stewed tomatoes with garlic and onion. She told me not to use diced tomatoes as only two of my boys like them and it's easier to serve those who prefer no tomato. I will definitely make this recipe as much as they like since I can pretty much swap out most of the ingredients for organic ones. Laughing cow cheese will work well.

Reading other reviews, I added 1 pkg. frozen peas and carrots, 1 extra can of tuna, 1 tsp of onion powder and used 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and egg noodles instead.  This made the dish less creamy but my boyfriend and I agreed it was better this way and more filling with veggies and tuna.  Also topped with a light dusting of the rest of the cheese and then sprinkled on plain bread crumbs and then French's fried onions, came out PERFECT!  I will definitely be making this one over and over!!

I opted for a topping made with buttered Kellogg's cornflake crumbs. This was fairly good, but I think egg noodles would have lent a richer flavor than the shells.

Comfort food at its best.  My new husband thought it beat his mom's!  WARNING:  This recipe makes a LOT of food.  I actually made it in two smaller casseroles and froze  one.  Awesome, easy and SUPER-fast to put together.  CHEAP too!

This was the best version of tuna noodle casserole I have tried. I followed the recipe directions but I added ritz crackers on top like another reviewer suggested and we all LOVED the taste. I also wanted to add that one of the reasons I think this recipe is so much better is the addition of the fresh garlic!

I would rate it 5 after my additions. I added 12 oz. shredded cheese (a blend of monterey jack, colby and mild cheddar)instead of sliced cheese and used 1 c. of french fried onion rings on the top instead of potato chips. Will never buy boxed tuna helper again. Boyfriend could not keep fork out of it.

I agree that this was a little bland and dry for my tastes.  It would probably make a good base recipe.  I would add some vegetables next time and probably cut out the cheese in the middle and just put it on top.

I've been making my mom's tuna noodle recipe for years, but not any more.  The combination of soups makes for a much tastier sauce and though I always scoffed at putting chips on top in the past, they really make a difference.

I made this after reading friend Suemck's review.  I get that hankering for tuna noodle casserole once every 6 months or so, and this one fit the bill nicely.  It was a change for me to use potato chips on top and I thought they added something interesting, however leftover, they were a soggy mess.  I used cream of asparagus and cream of roasted garlic soups, added a dash more milk as some complained of dryness and some mushrooms and peas.  I would normally have added some sour cream to the mixture but I was out this time around.  I would make it again, I am sure - it was quick, easy and above all, comforting.  Thanks!

This was hands down the best tuna casserole recipe I've tried. I used large elbow macaroni instead of shells and added 3 cans of tuna instead of 2. Also, instead of the slices of american cheese I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture while I was warming it up. I added just a little more salt and pepper (a few shakes of the shakers), and that was it! I'm not a fan of potato chips in my tuna casseroles, so I didn't add them. It's still VERY tasty and very good! It wasn't bland at all! It was great as leftovers also. It didn't dry up like the typical tuna casserole does. 5 stars!!

Great recipe! Got rave reviews from friends but didn't think the processed cheese added to the dish, hence the 4 stars. next time i'll try a different cheese or none at all.  And, I won't add the chips until about ten minutes before it's ready to come out of the oven, browned a bit too quick. Thanx for the recipe!

Yummy..I would not change an ingreditent, however I am not sure why you would need to heat the ingredients in another dish, just another pot to wash..the noodles were warm enough when I added them.

Following the recipe with a few changes, I sauted` little onion, green bell pepper,celery(about 1/4 c. each)and diced a clove of garlic in about 2 tsp. olive oil.  Cooked my egg noodles for about 5 min. added about 1/2 pkg of frozen broccoli (thanks to K.C review) the last 2 min.  I didn't have 2 cans of crm. of chicken  I had 1 can of cream of celery, 1 crm of chicken AND 1 pepper jack cheese soup. Mix the soups with 2 c. milk add noodles/broccoli, tuna,sauted` veggies, mix all together, pour 1/2 in a 9x13 dish, put 4 slices of cheese, pepper, then the rest of the noodle/soup mixture on that, I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs on top and drizzled a little butter over that, baked for 20 min @350 then turned the oven off and let it sit the next 10 min in the oven. (thanks to K.C)  Thank you Chris for a wonderful Basic comfort recipe.  I'm writing this while my husband is finishing his second helping and ooooohing and ahhhing over it.

A really good basic casserole recipe that can be modified based on your likes and needs.  I used 3 cans of chunk light tuna in water, decreased milk to 1 cup and added 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sour cream, mixed in 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar and omitted American cheese, added a 12oz package of frozen green beans, and used 12 oz whole wheat penne regate pasta.  Used low sodium soup and omitted salt, but that was a mistake.  It needs the salt for flavor and I added it when serving.  I put butter pats and bread crumbs on top.  All in all, came out creamy and hearty and tasty and I would definitely make it again.  I liked the consistency of the casserole and the flavor of the cream of celery/cream of mushroom soup mixed together.  You can feed a crowd pretty easily with this stuff.

I Liked this. This was my first tuna casserole recipe so I followed the recipe word for word the first time and thought that it was kind of dry. The second time I made it I added another can of cream of mushroom soup and frozen peas to the noodles (egg noodles) in the last 3 min of cooking. I did notice the the chips on top did get soggy when I tried to have some leftovers so maybe next time I will try some ritz crackers like the other posters suggested. My family really enjoyed the dish. Thanks!!!!!

This was good tuna casserole, not great.  I thought it was a little dry, I added peas and bread crumbs instead of chips, also I melted some extra cheese into the tuna mixture as others had suggested.  I also used no yolk egg noddles.  Next time I might try adding another can of soup to make it creamier.  And maybe another can of tuna, I didn't think there was a good ratio of tuna for all the noddles.  It's worth trying again though.

This was a very good recipe.  I used Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup with Garlic, which gave it a nice flavor, added peas, and substituted grated white cheddar for the American slices (and added it to the tuna mixture before baking).  I didn't bother heating the tuna mixture - adding it to the hot pasta in the hot pasta pot was enough to warm the entire mixture.  I used thick kettle-cooked chip pieces, which added a wonderful texture on top.  Finally, I used a 9x13" dish (actually 3qt), which gave it a great casserole-to-potato-chips ratio. :-)  I will definitely be making this again.

My family loved this! Even my picky four-year-old and one-year-old ate it up!  My husband loves tuna noodle casserole, but has never thought any of the recipes I found were "just right."  The only thing I will add next time is peas.  Yummy!

Wonderful basic recipe. I added 6 chopped hard
boiled eggs, l extra can of tuna and a little
Garlic powder. Just like my Mom used to make when I was a kid. My husband loves it. It's even
better the second day (if you have any leftovers).

It was o.k., but it was a little on the dry side. I thought it would be creamier. I made it with egg noodles, so maybe next time I make it I'll use smaller noodles and that will make a difference.

This was good, I guess Im just not a fan of tuna casserole.It had a very strong tuna flavor. I will give this recipe a second chance and make it again sometime using just one can of tuna and a bag of shredded chedder with the american cheese.

Loved it! I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so used a second can of cream of celery. And since I didn't have American cheese, I sprinkled shredded cheddar. This was a great recipe!

I made this casserole for my dad and I. I loved it, however he thought the potato chips were completely unnecessary and that they didn't add anything to the dish. It was great once I made a few tweaks such as adding a little more cheese and spiced it up a bit more. I would definitely make this again.

This was great! Followed exactly and the whole family ate it up! The only reason why it got a 4/5 is because it wasn't that great as a left-over.  Plan on feeding 4-6 and finishing it off so there are no left-overs :)

This is a great recipe! It is exactly like my mom's when I was a little girl. Times have changed. Our tuna comes in 5 oz. cans now and most people are horrified at the thought of putting chips on a casserole but I say Yay!! And Thank you!! It doesn't hurt to have the good stuff once in a while!!

Just made this today.  Switched it up a bit by using low fat soup and milk - and adding peas and used Ritz crackers on top instead of potato chips.  Yummy!

This recipe is great as is.  I do,however, add a can of mushrooms when I make this because my husband and I both love them.  I also add a layer of cheese slices to the top of the noodles before adding the crushed chips.  You will love this recipe!

There is nothing like a really good Tuna Casserole and we LOVE this recipe.  The only change we made to this is the potato chips.  We just love our ritz crackers.  We have not actually tried the potato chips yet because we don't ever buy them - but nonetheless, this recipe is one of my favorite american classics.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I made this for me, my mom, and my 2 yr old son.  We all loved it!! I made it with one gigantic can of cream of mushroom and used 3 slices of white american and about 3 ounces of shredded colby/cheddar.   (We were trying to save a trip to the grocery store).  It was just all sorts of goodness...just ate late night seconds, actually.

My kids aren't a fan of heated tuna so I swapped canned chicken breast instead and I also added frozen corn to this dish and everyone loved it.  Rarely do my children agree on a meal but this will be a regular in my house!  Thanks for a great weeknight recipe!

DH loves this! Here is what I do differently: Instead of cream of mushroom I use cream of chicken, don't need any salt the soup has enough! I used breadcrumbs for the topping instead of chips and added peas to the soup/tuna mixture. Oh and sometimes I use egg noodles. Thanks Chris for the great recipe!

Tuna casserole is both mine and my husband's favorite meal.  I decided to try a new recipe and followed the exact one.  We both liked it better than my own recipe....it was delicious.  Our son dislikes tuna casserole and he even ate this one.

Yummy, even for 6 year old and 18 month old! Used 2 cans of mush soup (didn't have celery), and mix of havarti and processed cheese. Threw in a can of mushrooms. Comfort food. :) Thanks for the recipe!

Another kid-approved meal that left them saying "you make the best dinners, mommy"! The only substitutions I made were out of necessity: I used Cream of Potato instead of Cream of Celery simply because I couldn't find the latter in the grocery store. I also used shredded Mexican cheeses instead of the processed American cheese. Finally, I used bread crumbs for the topping instead of potato chips. If anything, I would reduce the amount of salt it calls for. Otherwise, it was fantastic!

I made this with some alterations that made it scrumptious! first, I used wide egg noodles and only cooked them 5-6 minute till al dente.  I used 1 1/2 cans of milk, 3 good shakes of Lawry's Seasoning, 4 shakes of cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup monterey jack with jalapeno cheese. For the topping I skipped the potato chips and instead buttered 2 slices of wheat bread, quartered them, put them on top of the casserole and sprinkled garlic salt over all and heavily sprinkled parmesan cheese over all! Makes tasty, toasty little french breads!

A wonderful recipe.  It gets 4 stars instead of 5 only because it was a little bland when I tasted it before putting it in the oven.  I gave it a quick dash of seasoned salt and was very pleased with the result.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was fantastic!  It wasn't dry or bland, it was super easy, too!  I used shredded cheddar and added some fresh broccoli (which I cooked with the pasta the last 2 minutes it was boiling) other than that I made no changes.  Thank you for a terrific recipe Chris, my family loved it, we don't even have leftovers!!!

A solid four! Everyone enjoyed it and wanted seconds and thirds. There is nothing special about this but it's just good homecookin'. I love the addition of garlic and the American cheese works here. The recipe makes plenty, we have five in our family, and we had leftovers.

This recipe was really yummy.  I am a cheese-a-holic, so I added additional cheese slices to the top as well as tomatoes (just like mom used to make) and it was so good.  The chips did get soggy on reheats so I would halve the chips on the original and add more with each reheat.

Yumm!
I did sub in breadcrumbs for potato chips, added a 1/3 c milk, and use shredded colby/monterey jack cheese (not a fan of american cheese).
This was sooo easy and sooo good and made lots of food!
The husband asked me to "add this to our rotation" of commonly cooked meals. :)

Awesome! I  cooked the noodles and combined all other ingredients minus tuna and added 1/2 c peas, 3T sliced mushrooms, 2 T sliced celery and about 1/4 c cheese.  Layered this mixture, cheese, mixture and topped with potatoe chips.  When serving I used up all the toasted chips so they wouldn't get soggy & will top leftovers with fresh chips.

This is a very versatile recipe that deserves 5 stars everytime because it is so forgiving. Thank you Chris who submitted and Kates for your suggestions/variations. I basically added what I had in my freezer/frig. 
I used Campbell's fat free celery soup, and Campbell's low sodium mushroom soup, 8 ounces fresh sliced/chopped mushrooms, and the dredges of some Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar that I had on hand, 1 Tb of both Chipotle Seasoning and Basil, 2 cups soy milk (dairy intolerance), 1 cup of frozen chopped green/red peppers, no salt, no pepper (I'm not a fan), 1/4 cup grated low fat cheddar cheese with the crushed pringles I had on hand. 
This was a "5" from my fussy husband. The heat from the chipotle and the nice crust from the chips/cheese were great. If anything were to improve it, it would be going with Kates suggestion of using two layers of 4 slices each. Mmm, Mmm, good!

This was a really yummy extended family pleasing recipe.  I do agree that a few healthy twists were in order.  Adding fresh mushrooms, chopped celery & peas were a good addition.  Also, I agree that the salt could definately be eliminated.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I honestly dislike potato chips, but this was the recipe that I most "remember".  I left the top plain and it was still awesome.

Only modification, (chips withheld), was whole wheat noodles.

THANK YOU.

Very Good Recipe. Like others, I made a few changes. My family loves cheese,so instead of Cream of Celery, I bought the Campbells Cheddar Cheese in the can. I also added a 1/4 cup of sour cream and opted to use the Ritz butter crackers instead of potato chips. I was afraid that stored and reheated leftovers topped with chips would end up soggy. I used celery salt instead of the celery soup and added a blend of white cheeses and sharp cheddar cheese instead of American Cheese. It is a delicious meal. This is a forgiving recipe...I forgot to put in the garlic and it still turned out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe Chris. Have fun cooking!

This was easy and delicious.  I made some changes as everyone does to suit thier family.  I added two small cans of mushrooms and chili powder which gave it some kick.  I topped it with cheese soup by campbells and crackers.  It was really great and easy to make.

This recipe was really good! We couldn't eat it all, I hope it freezes well.  If you are planning on adding ingredients to this dish like a bag of frozen peas or extra cream of whatever soup... my only advice is to use a 3 qt casserole dish or larger.  YUM! Thanks,

Great recipe.  Would be even better with crushed Nacho Doritos on top and a little more cheese in the middle!

I'm not a huge fan of tuna casserole, but after making this recipe last night I may have had a change of heart. I forgot to put in the cheese, but it still came out great! I did add a cup of frozen peas and a bit of diced green onion to give it some color, and used egg noodles becuase that was all I had on hand. Also used sour cream & onion Pringles for the chips which added a bit to the flavor. Excellent recipe. Can't wait to make it again!

Excellent.  Just like I remembered it as a kid.  I added peas, and used 2 cans of healthy request cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery.

A great dish. Only complaint is I didnt love the American cheese in it. Parmesan would have been a better choice I think I also felt something was missing, so next time I think I will add a can of green pea's to add a little more flavor. Overall a great start to a great tuna noodle casserol.

It was yummy and easy to make. I made it with mazerola cheese and added green peas and came out very good.I also added chopped onion, my suggestion will be to fry onion before adding.

I substituted 1 cup shredded cheese for the slices, added garlic, chopped onion, chopped celery, frozen peas and topped with croutons instead of chips - really tasty! Thanks for a great base - and to the others suggestions!

I won a casserole contest with this recipe.  Who'd have thought to put garlic in a tuna casserole.  I used 3 cans of tuna and elbow macaroni.  Guess I won't have to buy tuna helper anymore.

This was pretty good, but we made it with light ingredients and I bet it would have been a "5 star" if we had used full-fat ingredients.

I thought this recipe was great! I added a few of my own favorites; a few cubes of Velvita fiesta cheese, a few spoon fulls of sour cream,and a can of peas. I also used cream of mushroom with garlic soup. I was out of chips, so I mixed cheddar cheese with french's fried onions and covered the top. I used salt, pepper, dill, and onion salt.I did what others said and mixed some of the cheddar cheese in with the sauce as well. My husband devoured most of it! I will definatly make this again!!

This was okay.  I added mushrooms & peas and used sour cream & onion potato chips for the topping.  My husband and his friends has second helpings, but they'll eat anything! LOL.  Seriously, next time I would stir in the chedddar rather than layer it for a more even distribution.

i've been making a recipe similair to this for years but decided to try this one for a change of pace. Glad i did. Loved the change of noodles (we used egg noodles previously) kids like the shells better. also really like the addition of cream of celery and garlic. added some onion powder also. didn't have any cheese slices so i used what little bit of shredded cheese we had. Will definitly add more cheese next time. Also really like the chips on top.my kids who are 5 and 8 also liked and they are picky eaters. Hubby even took for lunch today! will be adding to my recipe box! Thanks for sharing

I made this exactly as the recipe states, and it was pretty good.  No one was blown away by it or anything, but I think that may just be because we don't love tuna casserole.  The one thing I would change if I'd make it again would be to add more cheese.  The cheese was def lacking.  I used crushed Pringles on the top and I believe that made a huge difference!!

Excellent !! Just a little too much for an 8" X 8" baking dish.  I put 2 cups of milk in and topped with shredded cheddar then covered with crumbled town house crackers.  Very good, will make this again soon.

This wasn't my favorite recipe.  Nothing was particularly wrong with it, however there could have been more tuna it, you could hardly taste it.  It was definitely easy to make, but I don't think I'll be making it again anytime soon, it just wasn’t that appetizing.

Keep in mind, I'm not a big tuna fan.  I made this for my husband.  But to me, I could have just made tuna helper from the box and it would have tasted just as good.  Instead of doing the layers, I just put the cheese on top and then crushed chips on top of the cheese.  After reading other reviews of it being dry, I left out some noodles.  I didn't want to add the extra fat and calories of adding a third can of cream of something soup.  I won't make this again.  I'll use the boxed stuff.

Very good, made this last nite for my husband and a friend.  Used all cream of mushroom soup, shredded cheddar, and canned chicken instead of tuna (husband's personal preference)  Very traditional and tasty.

Very good recipe, but I used 4 cans of tuna, sharp cheddar cheese and 2 cups of frozen peas. About 10 minutes before it was done, I sprinkled 2 small cans of french fried onions on top, instead of potato chips. I filled a 9" x 13" pan, and my 25 year old son was eating it for 3 days. That is a very good indicator of how well it went over, as far as I am concerned. Thank you, Chris!

I really enjoyed this casserole dish. I used 2 cans of mushroom soup,1 can of celery and a little extra milk and it turned out great. I also used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the cheese slices, but didn't use enough. My daughter liked it but said to add more cheese next time as you couldn't really taste the cheese. My 5 yr. old granddaughter is a very picky eater but everything in this dish is something that she likes. She said she really enjoyed it and ate a big serving of it . This is a keeper.

I liked this, next time will add more cheese and mix in some veggies.  I used chips on half and bread crumbs on the other, but next time I will use Ritz crackers.

This is good, but not as exciting as I had hoped.  I halved the recipe, but kept the amount of cheese the same as the original recipe, and I felt it still wasn't very cheesy.  Also, it doesn't reheat very well; the chips get soggy.

I have made this several times and it always turns out good. I use shredded cheddar for the middle layer and some more on top. The cream of celery and garlic makes a nice change from the normal tuna noodle casserole.

We loved this!my family is very picky, a 7 & 3 year old, but my bubby is the worst-and everyone had seconds!I made alterations though, We used Cream of Chicken & Cream of Broccoli soups, We also added chopped water chestnuts, greenbeans, and corn...all we had were some american cheese slices, and shredded mozzeralla, but it was great..Added some sauted onions, and it was a feast! thank you so much!

I hate tuna, but I enjoyed this recipe.  I added peas, onions and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  I also found that for those who don't really care for tuna, diced chicken or turkey also work very well.  I will be making this casserole often.

This was yummy!  The tuna flavor wasn't strong and my family of non-casserole eaters each had seconds.  I topped it with bread crumbs instead of chips.

We are not big casserole people but my guy was craving some so I searched high and low for one similar to what he was craving and he said it came out just how he remembered but BETTER! Took the reviewers advised cooked the pasta for less time and also added an extra can of cream of celery with a bit more milk. My addition: a can of a love medley consisting of peas, mushrooms, and the tiniest pearl onions  and it was perfect!

My mom made tuna noodle casserole when I was growing up in the 1960’s & 1970’s, but never baked it in the oven. She would prepare it all in a large saucepan.

I cook now for just my husband & I since our 3 sons are adults, married & with children. So I cut the recipe in half.  

To avoid using 3 pans, I boiled the noodles (I use No Yolks brand), drained then mixed in soup, tuna, milk, black pepper, onion powder & garlic powder.  I used some shredded cheddar cheese between the two layer of noodle mixture.  Instead of using potato chips, I melted butter & stirred in panko bread crumbs & sprinkled over casserole. 

Covered with aluminum foil & baked for 15 minutes, uncovered & baked for another 15 minutes.  The casserole was somewhat bland.  Next time I’ll use 2 - 5 oz. cans of tuna, 1-1/2 to 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, more milk, a bit of salt, more black pepper, onion & garlic powder.

My husband does not like cream of celery soup & I don’t care for vegetables in this casserole.

Thank you Chris for the recipe!

It was very good. Would make it again. I added a sauteed onion and  2 celery diced to it because no peas were used. I would definitely use this recipe with my additions and add peas.

This is the recipe for tuna noodle casserole that I made 50 years ago with my mom and that I make for my daughter and her family.  Usually will switch out sliced cheese for shredded cheddar and if I ever have some other kind of shredded cheese from another recipe--I'll throw that in as a bonus--last night had about 2 Tblsp of fresh shredded Parmesan, and a little bit or Mexican Blend and they went in, as well as a bit of extra Cheddar.  occasionally will get government cheese from friends who visit food bank and that cheese cubed also works well.  Only thing I don't do nor did my mom. . .is to heat the soups, milk, and tuna together--I just add 5 minutes to bake time.  So glad I found this one.  
  You have heard of dump cakes cause I call this my Tuna Noodle Dump recipe--If I find dribs and drabs of cottage cheese, I'll add the rest of that. . . sour cream. . .same thing.  If I'm out of potato chips I'll crush some Doritos. . . crushed though only a handful. . .I added Tabasco sauce once for my son-in-law and granddaughter who favor spicier things.  Sometimes I add a tsp of ground mustard, sometimes garlic--this recipe should be viewed by the creative cook as a jumping off place.  But don't forget that recipes rely on ratios so if you add sour cream, mushroom juice from canned mushrooms, cottage cheese. plain yogurt, real cream etc.  that you need to make adjustments in other fluid added (milk).    Once used same recipe for a quick Chicken casserole by substituting about 1.5

I found this a decent base recipe. It turned out a little dry, so I'll probably increase the amount of milk next time. I also used cheddar instead of American cheese because that's what I had on hand. My husband and I liked it enough to warrant saving the recipe.

This is always good and hearty, even if lacking in a great deal of flavor. I used a large can of salmon instead, and also added a can of sliced mushrooms, a teaspoon of dill, and a splash of lemon juice. Topped with French's Onions instead of potato chips.

This was very good! I did most everything by the recipe and it was simple, fast and good! I added some sour cream and reduced the milk a little bit and I used crackers on the top instead of potato chips because I didn't have them.

My husband and I found this to be bland. I added some  onions and some peas. When I sampled my plate, I tried adding more pepper & salt, which did improve it some.

I've been looking for a tuna casserole that was close to what mom made. This is it.   I used 2 cans cream of mushroom and no cream of celery.  Exchanged pasta shells for no yolk egg noodles.  It was wonderful

Since my grandmother is allergic to mushrooms I switched out the soups... Well, I ended up using ingredients I had on hand, rotini instead of shells, chicken instead of mushroom, cheese soup instead of celery, powdered garlic instead of crushed garlic and added a can of Veg-All (drained).  All in all though it still turned out well and tasty. I will definitely be making this again. It's quick, easy, simple & cheap :-)

I used macaroni instead of noodles...I'd use noodles next time.  It didn't have enough sauce for kids, kind of dry. I'd add some mayo for tang and more sauce next time. Otherwise, I liked it okay. It just needs some tweaking for my family.

I made a few changes. I used 4-cheese Mexican blend, evaporated milk, a drained can of peas, 2 cans of cream of celery,and egg noodles. So I suppose I made a different dish.

A great base or just as it is.  I added different soups and cheeses the different times I've made it and it always turns out delicious.  No leftovers for sure.

OMG, this was excellent.  I made one change and that was because I didn't have Tuna, so I used Langostinos. I can't say anything except it was just wonderful.  Nice and moist and creamy, so thank you Chris, for a great casserole. Try it with the Langostinos, you will be surprised. TNT -Connie

I loved this recipe however I made just a couple of changes . I used large egg noodles not the pasta shells, and for cheese I used the colby shredded cheese and made a middle layer of cheese then topped it with more of the noodle/tuna mixture and topped it again with Cheese and Bread Crumbs. I didn't want the potatoe chips to get soggy , so this worked better for next day leftovers. It was perfect , now my family looks forward to this Tuna Casserole!!

This was edible but I won't make again. I think it is definitely a recipe to use if you have young kids which I don't. My boyfriend said it was alright but then he just ate one helping and neither of us touched the leftovers. The leftovers got tossed a few days later and there were ALOT of leftovers even though I cut the recipe in half.

Was okay, not great but ok. chips starting to go soggy within 1/2 hour of making it.  Used can each cream of chicken and cr. of mush, no salt, mozz-cheddar mix and 3 heaping T's of powdered cheese (the KD stuff). Will try again thinning sauce a little and adding ground beef instead of tuna. Will taste good with this sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

This was OK. Tuna flavor was too strong for me. Needs something tangy. Will try adding mustard and horseradish next time. Definitely a good recipe to build upon.

Try adding sour cream. I use a cup or more to my liking. Depending on how much I am making I use medium grated cheese throughout. I also omit cream of celery and milk. Sour Cream makes it very tasty. Maybe I will try the cream of celery.

My family HATED this recipe.  They refused to eat it. I made it exactly as it is written. I should have used half the amount of tuna or just canned chicken.  It was WAY too fishy! Should be zero stars!

This is the tuna casserole I grew up on except that we never had cheese or added salt.  I like adding american cheese--it's a great addition.  I have never warmed the sauce before baking.  I mix everything in the casserole pan.  Then, I dig a hole for the cheese and cover it up.  That way I don't need to dirty another dish.  When I think there might be leftovers, I only add chips to 1/2 or 3/4 of the casserole.  Usually my 3 kids help me eat this (no hubbie) and we lick the bowl clean.  I ever eat the crumbs from my bags of chips.  I save them for this casserole.  This is great with salt and vinegar chips and even tortilla chips.  The kids don't even notice the mushrooms in the soup.  I like this best with cream of mushroom soup.  If I have them, I'll add onions, mushrooms, celery and peas.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Very nice--I would have liked a little more creaminess, but altogether good.  My family loved the chips on top.

I used bread crumbs with 2 tablespoons of melted butter instead of the potato chips as people said if you had them the next day the chips were soggy. My son who is picky had 2nd's so this is a keeper!

It was alright. I think I may have just gotten tired of it after eating it so many days in a row (college student...). I added some onions and mushrooms to it because I had them around. I also added hot sauce when I was eating it because I like the kick. I'd make it again, but few and far between.

Great base.  I added zucchini, grated carrots and peas.  I used shredded mozzarella and parm. in the middle and on top with bread crumbs on top.  It was great and easy.  I will make again and try different combos.

My entire family, including my one year old, LOVED this recipe. I used butter crackers instead of potato chips because I just had a bad feeling about potato chips. Plus, I don't like all the grease in potato chips. This recipe is simple to make, easy to eat, and the chef could use ANY type of pasta desired. I like the shells because they trap some of the flavor inside. I used cream of chicken and cream of celery soups.

My whole family loved this. I tried this instead of my traditional Tuna Noodle Recipe because I think my original one was dry. I used less noodles and did the tiny corckscrew noodles. I also topped with French's Fried Onions because I didn't have any potato chips left. I also used only the 98% fat free soups because I can't ever taste the difference in casseroles. It was wonderful!!! Try it you won't be sorry.

OMG! I really loved it. It was so creamy and delicious. I just warmed the ingredients in he microwave instead of stovetop. Also, I used a combination of swiss and American cheese. My five year old loved it and kept asking for more!!

Ok, this was really yummy, BUT I did not exactly follow the recipe.  I IMPROVISED!  (the sign of a good cook, so I say :-)) I followed the proportion of pasta/soup/milk and the cooking method.  I added cooked broccoli.  I used garlic powder. I used shredded parmigiana cheese and crushed garlic croutons on top.  It was good, but I must say my favorite tuna casserole is the one my mom used to make with rice, peas, and velveeta on top!

I made this last night and it was delicious! I did adjust the recipe a little, so I could use what I had on hand and it turned out great. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup and only half a package of egg noodles. I also used garlic powder instead of minced garlic, but it still turned out great. I was surprised how well using sliced American cheese worked out, but next time I think I'll try some shredded cheese and probably add some peas. Great basic recipe though! The boyfriend and I gobbled it up!

Excellent!  Made it as stated (ingredients listed), only didn't add the chips on the top and only had colby jack cheese so I used that instead.  One thing I didn't realize it til was too late was mixing them separately.  I threw everything in the pot with the after I drained the pasta and it turned out great. Added peas too - kids loved it!

This is very good, but I did make a few changes to the recipe. I use rotini and cook it for about a minute or 2 less than what the package says for al dente. I cut the milk to one cup. Instead of crushed garlic, I used 1 clove minced. I eliminated the salt because the soups and tuna already have sodium in them. I add about 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the mixture before putting it in my casserole dish. Sharp cheese makes all the difference for a little extra zip. I tried it with mild once and it just wasn't the same. I top it all off with some bread crumbs that have been tossed with a little butter. This is one of my husband's favorite meals!

What a great comfort food! My boyfriend and I both loved it. The only substitutions I made were buttery Ritz cracker topping instead of chips and I had to use cream of chicken (2 cans along with the cream of mushroom) only because I didn't have any cream of celery on hand. It turned out great. Next time I'll add some sour cream to see how that tastes.

Very similar to my old standby.  No complaints at my house.  I use cream of celery and cream of chicken soups, omit the peas (hubby doesn't like them), sometimes add a little onion, add some cubed Velveeta in the mixture instead of cheese slices in the middle, if I have some.  Bake at 350 for 25 minutes then top it with a bunch of shredded cheese blend over top and bake an extra 5 minutes.  Yum!

Good recipe! Didn't wow me in flavor, but couldn't be easier to put together. I used two cans of cream of mushroom, and added chopped celery for crunch. It's pretty good cold, too! Only problem is that the potato chips get soggy. Thanks for this!

Nice flavor, but I used ritz crackers instead of chips for the topping & a lot of the pasta shells on the top of the casserole weren't cooked well. Quick and easy to make. Husband really liked the flavor.

first time to make a tuna casserole and it looked wonderful however the sauce was a pinkish color from the tuna and it was too pureed for my taste. My husband took one bite and my 2yr old son disliked it as well. Unfortunatly not a fan and wont be making it again.

Great recipe!  Quick and easy!  I added finely chopped onion and left out the milk.  I baked it in a 9X13 pan so I used a few more slices of cheese too.  I liked the crunch and the two soups together.

This is a staple recipe in my house. I had bad memories of tuna casserole with peas. I omit peas and use shredded cheddar, it's so good. Pretty forgiving recipe and nice comfort food.

This is a great recipe with a few must do changes so that's why I gave it 4 stars. Instead of cream of celery I used 2 cream of mushroom then put in 1 cup celery. I also used shredded cheese instead of sliced, but I added the cheese on for the last 10 minutes. I then put the chips on top of the cheese for the last 10 minutes as well otherwise it gets all soggy. After the adjustments though it is a great dish that my family asks for again and again.

I loved this recipes, but made a few changes---I added 2 cups of cheddar cheese, a bag of frozen peas, and a dash of Tony Cacecheri's.  The combo of the mushroom and celery soups were great!!!!

Excellant!  I used 1 c 2% milk, 1 1/2 c cheddar cheese and whole wheat crackers to tweak the recipe a bit.  No leftovers, ever.

I used foil-packed tuna- it has better flavor and texture- and shredded cheddar instead of processed slices. A classic!

This is one of my family's favorites!  They don't like celery soup so I substitute it with cream of chicken w/ herbs.  They absolutely love the crunchy topping of potato chips!  The cheese in the middle really gives it a creamy texture that we love, too.  Thanks for the recipe!  I've made it at least 8 times already!

This is a delicious and easy dish! I use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom because we HATE mushrooms, and instead of american cheese I alternate slices of cheddar and slices of pepperjack.

My family and I thought it was great! I took one of the suggestions and put a double layer of cheese in the middle and it turned out really well. I also put two cans of cream of mushroom soup. These were the only two changes I made to the recipe.

This was great! I got rid of the salt completely and used cheddar cheese. Instead of chips, I used french fried onion. It was delish. The comfort food I was craving.

My family liked this recipe a lot.  The only change I made was using 12 oz of pasta.  This made it a bit more creamier.  I think I will add some milk next time to make it even more creamier, and try Swizz Cheese.

I've been looking for a good tuna casserole recipe ever since my mom realized she lost her copy of our old family one. This one comes pretty close, but instead of chips we always used bread dipped in butter on top, so that's what I did here. I also didn't have cream of celery soup, so I doubled up on the cream of mushroom and added chopped celery, with a bit of celery salt (and thyme and garlic) to the seasoning. Turned out pretty well, except I needed more sauce because I used larger than called for noodles (used the large shells). I also used Mozzarella cheese and used about 8 slices, instead of four. Overall, this is a very easy to do, yet nice tasting still, recipe. Will definitely use it again!

This was very deelish... I added and extra can of cream of mushroom soup after reading a few of the other reviews and added a can of peas as well. I used mozzarella cheese instead and it was perfect. I wouldn't change anything else about this recipe. It smelled so good as I was mixing everything together to go in the baking dish that I couldn't wait for it to be done already. I have a large family & everyone enjoyed even the teenagers!! If anyone is looking for a tuna noodle casserole-this should be the one you choose!!

Pretty good tuna casserole. I cooked the whole 16oz of noodles and added them to the sauce a little at a time to make sure it didn't turn out too dry. I ended up using about 1.5 cups less noodles than called for.

Wow!  My family loved it!  I made two smaller casseroles (three slices cheese each), and used ziti noodles.  Didn't have the chips, so I used bread crumbs mixed with melted butter & parmesan cheese for the topping.  Thanks!

Like many others who have reviewed this recipie, I made changes. I used Ritz instead of potato chips for the crunch, I used layers of shredded cheddar instead of sliced american, and I added peas. I also used two cans of the mushroom soup because my boyfriend and I aren't big fans of celery. As far as the recipie without these changes, it was the best "base" recipie I've seen! I might even put my recipie with changes on here and give a little nudge to this one to show where I got my start! It turned out wonderfully, and with lots of leftovers because I was only cooking for two!

Very good tuna noodle recipe. Can add many different things to it. My family loved it at bible study last night. We made it exactly like the recipe. The chips we used on top were wavy/had ridges. I think next time I will use different chips.

I would never eat my mother in-laws tuna noodle casserole or any thing else with tuna in it for that matter until, I made this! This is the best tuna noodle ever, so creamy and yummy. We ate it for dinner and then for lunch a couple of days later it re-heated very well. I would highly recommend this recipe!

I thought this was good, however I did not like the chips on top.  I will substitute next time with maybe crackers.  Other than that this recipe is a keeper.  I also added peas to the casserole as well.

I made this exactly how the recipe is. Wasn't a huge fan of the Cream of Celery soup with it. I thought it was bland. I'll stick with only using Cream of Mushroom and add mushrooms like I usually do.

This recipe was VERY easy to make...although I didn't enjoy it very much at all. I think it was all the canned soups that ruined the taste. My husband is used to me cooking with fresh vegetables and homemade broths but I was quite surprised when he decided to go hungry that night.

I originally gave it 4 stars but I have to revise it and give it 3. It was okay on the first night but absolutely dry by day two. My husband kept eating it but I felt it was really bad as leftovers.

A few changes I made to make it a bit healthier and add some flavor... 

1. Whole wheat noodles (only 5 mins till they're ready by boiling!)
2. 98% fat free soups 
3. Soy milk 
4. Added mushrooms
5. Added chopped vidalia onion
6. Added frozen peas
7. Added about 1/4 cup of sherry cooking wine while in the saucepan stage
8. Excluded salt
9. Added another can of tuna 

...ok, 9 changes. But it was this recipe as a base! Anyway, came out really well. Highly recommended.

This is a great recipe as is and of course people should add to their family's liking however I don't think that the ratings should go for that...
I thought my mom was the only one who used Potato Chips to top this and mac n cheese and several other casseroles she made over the years and I always do the same...Even have some of my frineds doing the same...The Wise chips and the cheaper ones work the best because they are more oily...Anyway, Thank You very much for the recipe it is definately a keeper...

Good.  Nice flavor and very economical.  Mine was a little soupy, but I used spaghetti pasta instead of the recommended pasta...that could be why.

Pretty easy to do - I plan on adding peas next time.  It also seems like an easy recipe to double to stock up on leftovers.

My husband made this for dinner tonight, and it turned out pretty well, except the potato chips got kind of chewy. I would also have substituted the cream of mushroom for cream of chicken because I'm not a mushroom fan. We used egg noodles instead of the shells to make it more casserole-y, but I'm sure the shells would have been good too. This recipe made a lot for our little family of 3!

Sorry but I have to say I really didn't like this at all. To be fair, I have only had tuna casserole 1 other time, and I didn't particularly like it! I thought I would try making this for my husband since he likes tuna casserole.
Anyway, this recipe is incredibly bland to my taste (and I used  sharp cheddar cheese and extra garlic!). It may just be me, I happen to prefer very savory, spicy food which this is definitely not! Everyone likes different things, and I will say it was very simple and quick, but I would not make this again 

sdited to add: My husband tried it and actually thought it was tasty, so go figure! I might end up making it again after all!

This was great even without the chips...since I didn't have those.  I think it would have been even better with the chips to give it the crunch it was missing.

I've tried a few different variations of this recipe and this is the one I've liked the best so far.  I did add about 1/2 cup frozen peas and 1/2 cup sour cream and used 3 cans of tuna.  Leftovers were a bit dry, but overall a good recipe.

My husband would prefer that I add another star but I wasn't crazy about this recipe. I think it would have been better had I added frozen peas and uses egg noodles instead. It was still a nice, standard recipe that we will use again in the future with our alterations. (We also did not put the cheese in--not our thing).

I was really happy with how this turned out. It will be an easy, cheap, weeknight meal. I did add frozen peas and I sauteed my garlic first. I took another reviewers suggestion and only put the chips on half so that the leftovers would get fresh chips instead of soggy. I also only used 1/2 the salt and it was plenty. I didn't have the right casserole dish so I just used a 9x13 and it was fine but I used 6 slices of cheese so that it would cover the whole dish.

My mom requested I make one of her favorite childhood dishes, tuna casserole.  I made this one and it was a hit with both her and my dad!  It smelled so good while it was baking, I decided to try it and it was delicious!

I will make this again and again and again, if the rave reviews I received are any indication.  Thank you for submitting this terrific recipe!

Very good.  My mom made this when I was little, but I don't think she used the garlic.  I think it must be the missing ingredient to hers as this was much better.  I used the garlic salt and only half of the amount recommended and didn't add any table salt at all.  I also used shredded medium cheddar chesse and sprinkled about a 3/4 c or so on the first half of casserole.  After layering in the second half, I mixed the remaining shredded cheese (about 1/4 to 1/3 c) with the potato chips and sprinkled mixture on top and baked at 350 for a little less than 15 minutes.  Recipe is so easy on a busy night and the family loved it too.

This recipe was a good base start for a good casserole.  I changed quite a few things, but I like the base of this.  The cream of celery and mushroom is really good.  I'm not a fan of the american cheese in the middle, but I definatly like the crushed chips.  I also like to add some vegi's like peas and mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a pleasant surprize, tasty!  Made a half size with one can of soup, celery, half cup sour cream, and fried onions as a topper.  I also used the expensive white tuna since the cheaper tastes yukky to me.  This was good.

Edible but a bit dry. My husband is very hard to please and I ask him to rate and he said 3. He thought it was too bland, I thought it needed more sauce.

This casserole was easy to make and tasted good EXCEPT the recipe calls for too much salt.  Next time I will cut the amount in half or delete it all together.

In my opinion, Hamburger Helper's got nuttin on this recipe. I used half the suggested noodles(all I had), added a cup of frozen mixed veggies, and topped with crushed Ritz crackers and melted butter. I also used real mild cheddar cheese. Turned out excellent, great flavor! Had to work in the evening, so made in the morning for hubby and kids, as was disappointed to come home and find NONE left. Thanks for what will be a regular recipe in my home!

This recipe is excellent!

I made some changes, such as adding 3/4 cup fresh chopped mushrooms and skipping the heating step (I simply mixed the ingredients in a bowl and transferred to a baking dish).

I'll make this again...and again...and again.

I will make this recipe again as it was very easy and didn't take much time.  I didn't like the potato chip flavor and will use crackers instead.  It was a little dry and perhaps will add more milk.  I used rotini pasta as that is what I had on hand.  My husband liked it.

I modified this a bit.  I used 2 cans of reduced fat cream of celery, added 1 cup 
of milk, 2 cans of pimentos, and topped with 2-3 tbs. of breadcrumbs.  I omitted the cheese.  My husband loved it, I liked it.  You can also add 1 up of peas.  I used bowtie pasta, as I prefer it over egg yolk noodles.

I cut this recipe in half and so I only used one can of soup.  I chose the cream of mushroom.  I didn't like the recipe.  My mom's recipe calls for so much cheese in the dish, this just doesn't compare.

Used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup instead and 3 cans of tuna.  Didn't use the cheese.  Added fried onions ontop.  This was gobbled up by everyone even my 2yr old.  Will make again!!

This was good.  We ate it, and surprisingly enough my super picky 11 year old had two servings.  But I have had tuna casseroles that I liked better.  I used cheddar cheese, and put in some peas and carrots.

I used this recipe as a guide but did make some changes due to just lack of certain ingredients (milk namely), but the way it came out was excellent and I don't think I've ever enjoyed tuna noodle casserole so much..  I used water instead and extra cheese to make up for it and it was sooo good.

This was an okay dish.  I think I'll stick to my standby - Betty Crocker. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't something I'd make again either.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used Velveta instead of American cheese.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't think it was dry at all.  We used egg noodles and crackers.  The crackers weren't very good in it and I would use chips if I had them.  Thanks for the recipe, we will be using it again!

I modified the recipe a little, combining the most interesting ingredients from the tuna casserole recipes here.  Instead of American Cheese, I used Cheddar.  In place of the potato chips, I used French Fried Onions.  It's a great recipe that my whole family loves.  Thanks!

good recipe and good as leftovers, too. It needed something though- I thought it was a tiny bit bland. Added mixed vegetables instead of just peas and put ritz crackers on top.

This was great! Total comfort food, we added about another 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup to make sure it was creamy enough. Will definitly make this again.

Good recipe to use what's on hand.  I followed recipe and it seemed drier than I thought it would be.  Next time I'll add more cheese and veggies.

It was pretty good.  I added some sauteed onions and some frozen veggies (gotta hide those where I can for the kids!) and it was pretty good.  The kids loved the fact that there were potato chips on top!

Not great, but not bad.  I would probably make again if when I need a quick and easy recipe.

Excellent! Husband HATES casseroles and isn't thrilled about tuna, either. But he really enjoyed this and said he would eat it again.

I didnt put the chips on top, just added another layer of cheese. Also, I almost didnt put the salt (thought that there's enough in condensed soup) or garlic (didnt think it was needed) in , but ended up following the recipe exactly and it was the creamiest and most delicious tuna casserole I've ever had.

My husband ate half the pan for dinner, so I guess you could say he really liked it.  I made two slight changes to the recipe.  I added the cheese (plus 2 extra slices) to the soup/milk mixture and cooked it until it all melted.  I also added some chopped celery which added a nice crunch.  Will be making agin.

Great comfort food. Used 1 can cream of celery and 1 cup of fat free sour cream instead of cream of mushroom to make a little lighter. Also used shredded 2% cheese and topped with french fried onions instead. Delish! Thanks Chris
