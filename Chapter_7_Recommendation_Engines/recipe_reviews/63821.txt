I marinated it for 10 hours because I just didn't think you could get the most out of this dish with only marinating meat for 30 min.  Even the 10 hours didn't help infuse the chicken with real flavor.  The proportion of honey to lime was off and the chicken was so bland.

I used regular lime juice and marinated it for 2 hours... we really liked the flavor, but will definitely marinate it overnight next time to strengthen the taste.

I really liked this recipe. It was simple and super easy to make. The trick is to marinate the chicken for at least an hour or two. The key lime taste is great,  subtle & delicious.
Everyone wanted more!

Great recipe! I didn't have any key lime juice, so I ended up using regular lime juice...and then it turned out that I didn't have enough of that, so I ended up subbing lemon juice for the remainder. :P Even so, the chicken came out moist, tender, and juicy, with a great lime/honey flavor. I marinated the chicken overnight, and then grilled it for lunch today. It was wonderful, and my family really enjoyed it. Plus, it was super easy and quick to put together. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!!

I let it marinate overnight so the flavor really penetrated the chicken and it was very moist but for some reason the lime juice and honey didn't taste right together to me.  I thought the key lime juice was way too tart for this, maybe regular lime juice or lemon juice.

Great marinade!  I will definitely keep this recipe.  I couldn't access my grill due to a sudden storm, so I browned the chicken in some olive oil on the stove.

So this was okay.  It is important to use Key West Lime Juice, and not regular lime juice.  The Key West is stronger and will help with the flavor.  I took leftovers, shredded and it made a great chicken salad.  Will I make this again, No.  Do I think you should try it, Yes.

AWESOME recipe!  The only thing I did differently was that I used regular limes instead of key limes since I already had those on hand.  Otherwise - this one is WILL be on the table again!

I marinated this longer overnight. The flavor was good but chicken was tough possibly from the lime juice. I probably wont make this again.

It was pretty delicious. Me and my botfriend had it for dinner today. To make it more flavorful we took and extra 1/3 cup of honey and brushed on each piece of chicken after we grilled it.

Followed recipe - except I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours.  It was very juicy, but a little too sweet for my taste.

Nice, simple, and tasty!  I used the Key Lime juice as suggested (yes, it is different than regular lime juice) and this came out great! Thanks for sharing it.

This was a really easy marinade, which is the main reason I tried it.  Our chicken had great grill marks on it, probably in part because of the honey.  This  recipe was great, but like many said I would probably leave it overnight next time.  We only had it marinade for about 4 hours, and the flavor was still a little weak.  Overall, very good and will definitely make it again.

A tasty recipe.  In place of bottled key lime juice I used the juice from one lime and included the zest from the whole lime for extra flavor.  Replaced garlic with 1/2 tsp grated whole ginger root, added 1/4 tsp thyme and reduced honey to 1 TBS.  Marinated for about 2 hours

Used regular lime juice, and added a touch of Poultry season. Had to bake it due to the oddly cold weather.  Marinated for over 24 hours, and what a disappointment.  The honey lime flavor only "stuck" to the outside of the breast - didn't infuse the entire piece of meat.  Let alone the flavor combination doesn't really go too well with chicken.  Much better with a mild fish.

This was very good - I didn't have soy sauce so I used the closest thing I had - Worcheshire sauce.  I marinated it for about 8 hours and I had scaled it down to one serving.  

I cooked it on my George Foreman grill and it was very good - this one is a keeper.

I didn't have any key lime juice so used normal lime. Then I didn't have lemon pepper so used grilling seasoning instead.

We used 1T less lime, a large garlic clove, and a little more honey, then let this marinate for a little over an hour, flipping twice, before baking for 40 minutes (in the marinade) at 350 degrees.  Flavor was very good.

This was really good.  I used 2 chicken breasts and the whole amount of marinade.  I love grilled lime chicken, and the sweetness of honey makes this one really tasty.  It was super tender too.

Very good.  But like the other raters I agree about marinating this longer.  I will do so next time.  I also liked the very faint hint of garlic.  I served this to two people who do not care for garlic and they enjoyed it.

We found this to be extremely tart. The chicken was very moist which was nice but the honey didn't balance the citrus taste. I don't have a grill so I made this on the stove top instead, perhaps that was what caused the problem.

It was good but I would suggest marinating longer than thirty minutes... Much longer.

Good but not great. I did use key lime juice and marinated 30 min per instructions....didn't have a lot of flavor. Not a keeper for me.

I cooked the chicken on an indoor grill after marinating for an hour and it turned out dry and flavorless.

Was very tasty - marinated it for the afternoon and then grilled it. Will make it again!

It was awesome when I used boneless pork chops.  I added a couple fresh cloves of chopped garlic and I used more honey than called for.  The extra honey gives them a nice flavor and allows the chops to "crisp" up more when grilled.  I originally used the marinade for chicken breasts and they were wonderful.  I make extra marinade for dipping...

This is a fantastic marinade. I doubled the lemon pepper and sliced the chicken in half lengthwise to make a thinner cutlet. This really let the flavor penetrate though to each bite. I grilled only 4 minutes per side. This was wonderful cut up and added on top of a spinach salad with a citrus sesame dressing. I served this as an entree for a girl's luncheon and each woman asked for the recipe.

My daughter and I enjoyed it for dinner, but she especially loved it on a spinach salad for lunch the next day!

I used the key lime juice and marinated it for about 30 minutes. The flavor was excellent! This is a simple, tasty summer meal. I've added it to my rotation.

I made this on the fly, regular lime juice, honey, garlic and lemon pepper. It was great but I may leave the garlic out next time, the kiddos didn't like the garlic taste.

I was planning on marinading it for a few hours, but totally forgot until it was time to start cooking supper. I just kept drizzling a bit more marinade on the chicken as it cooked, and that worked really well. I cut down on the honey as my sister has gestational diabetes, but it was plenty sweet.

Excellent recipe! Tons of flavor for a chicken breast. Did a couple things different.  I made some extra marinate a applied to the chicken at the end of the grilling then squeezed on some fresh lime and served with some lime wedges and squeezed on more lime as I ate it. The marinate it self was almost asain but with the extra lime gave it more offers a key west flavor. Ill be grilling this up again.
