My husband I ate these before we could even sit at the table. Instead of steaming/boiling them, I pan fried them in coconut oil. I heated the oil to a medium high heat so the beans would blacken a little bit. Once they were cooked (but still crunchy) I added the garlic (which became brown and crunchy) and immediately put in the sauce. I let it cook for less than a minute and put them in a sport dish. For the sauce, I didn't have ginger so I used ginger powder, I omitted the sesame oil since I fried them in coconut oil and used agave nectar in place of sugar. This will be a regular side dish/snack at our house!

Great recipe as is!  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used a scant half teaspoon of dried ginger.

Just for fun, I added a pound of chicken and a handful of peanuts to make this a main dish.  I cooked the chicken first, then removed it from the pan.  I then cooked the green beans as described and added the chicken back in before adding the seasonings.  There was plenty of sauce to go around.  I added the peanuts just a few minutes before it was done.  We loved it!

Made a few substitutions. Added triple the sugar and used brown sugar. Added more pepper flakes. Missed the ginger. Added a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce. Was  a big hit with the family that are picky eaters.

No changes but I have doubled this recipe for guests. This is absolutely the best recipe for green beans if you need to add a little sass to your menu.
I make this for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Made as written and this dish was OK. Maybe my taste buds are off today, but I really wasn't getting enough Asian coming through in these green beans. I was also expecting more heat to come through and there was literally no spiciness in the end result of this dish. If I make this again, I would increase the red pepper or use something different, such as Sambal or hot chile oil. .Will try the leftovers tomorrow and update review if I feel differently.

The sauce was really strong tasting and not a flavor I enjoyed. The soy sauce  was overwhelming. Perhaps I did something incorrectly but I won't make it again.

This is fantastic as written. However I now add the juice of an orange to add a little extra flavor and leave out the sugar. I have to make a lot because everybody wants to eat it all.  Spectacular!!!

I like the idea that you can change the spiciness by adding more or no red pepper flakes.  We love it hot and the grandkids love it not quite as spicy !

Maybe something went wrong, but it took much longer than the time it said for the sauce to thicken up. In fact, it still had a thin consistency when I decided to just eat it how it was. The flavor, however, was delicious!!! I will definitely be making this again.

I made this as a side dish with Honey Baked Ham.  It was a big hit with everyone.  The only thing I changed was subbing light brown sugar for white.

So delicious!  I have a bumper crop of green beans this year, looking for good recipes to use them up.  This was terrific.  I used a fresh cayenne pepper (steamed with the beans) instead of the crushed pepper flakes, because I had that on hand.  Definitely five stars.
