I'm from New Orleans and have been making pralines since I was a child. The proportions of this recipe are about right, but it leaves out the most essential step, which is beating the mixture after it reaches soft ball stage until it develops a matte sheen. The texture should have tiny crystals. The pralines should snap when you break them, and melt in your mouth.

It takes some practice to know exactly when to stop beating -- too soon and you have a translucent caramel. If you go too long, the mixture is too thick to spread when you're dropping them.

Another trick is to not stir the syrup after it starts boiling to prevent early crystallization. If you're tempted to scrape down the sides, don't do it -- instead, cover the pot a couple of minutes and let the steam wash them down.

Also, we always used raw pecans, not toasted. A pinch of salt brings out the flavor of the pecans.

These pralines were awesome!  A word of caution to anyone who is not familiar with candy making:  when your mixture has reached the desired consistency/temperature, remove from heat and transfer hot pan to an ice bath.  Beat the mixture until light in color and thick, then spoon (using two spoons) onto a baking sheet lined with wax or parchment paper brushed with butter.  Let cool, then peel wax paper or parchement away from the pralines.  The ice bath part is important as if you just cool slightly and spoon out then you will have a runny mess, not the praline shape that is desired.  Other than that, this recipe was AWESOME!

I read a lot of the recipes and reviews and combined a lot of ides for this...and here's some useful info.  Iused 2 cups pecans - both chopped and whole. Toast them for 10 minutes on 300 for a crunchier praline, stirring once. 3/8 cup butter is 6 Tablespoons. Use whole milk or even light cream. Use 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Vanilla keeps its flavor best if stirred in after removing from heat.  The ice bath was great idea as it needed to cool to coat the pecans the best. 
Then I cooled them in the freezer so I could eat them right away because they were yummy.

I do not have a candy thermometer, so I let the mixture boil for 3 minutes.  I used buttermilk and did not toast the pecans--mine were pretty fresh; I've found that toasted nuts are needed when they are not very fresh.

Also,using a mix of broken pecans and intact halves seems to work best for me--I leave most of the halves intact to keep the flavorful pecan oils inside.

I am from Louisiana, and had never made pralines myself, as I could easily obtain them back home.  I now live out west, and have not been able to find them in my town.  After the expense of having some shipped from New Orleans a couple of months ago, I decided to try this recipe after having reviewed several different recipes.  I am really glad I did.  This satisfied my praline craving without having to wait for the FEDEX man!  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent and very similar to the Pralines at River Street Sweets in Savannah, GA. I did not toast my pecans. The best outcome seemed to depend on when I poured them out on the cookie sheet. The ones that I spooned out immediately were too flat and glossy. The ones that I spooned out after the mixture had cooled were too crumbly. The ones that I spooned out after the mixture had cooled for 2-3 minutes were the perfect consistency. I would recommend waiting just a couple of minutes, then quickly spooning them onto the cookie sheet. I will definitely be making these many times over the holiday season!

Wow! Just got back from a trip to Georgia and these ARE like the Savannah pralines!  On the advice of others, I used an additional 1/2 c. pecan pieces, chopped, and evaporated milk instead of regular milk (I heard somewhere that that is what they use).  I didn't bother toasting the pecans although I imagine they would add some nice flavor.  Still tasted good w/untoasted, so if you don't have the time to toast, I wouldn't sweat it.  I used a candy thermometer, and after it reached the soft ball stage, I took it off the burner, added the vanilla and stirred quickly.  Because the ice bath seemed a little too much overkill for some reviewers (and it wasn't setting fast enough for me!), I just filled the sink w/cold water and dipped the bottom of the pan for maybe 5-10 seconds.  I removed the pan and stirred the heck out of it, then used a small cookie scooper to immediately scoop the stuff onto the foiled pans.  I figured that if these are as sweet as some say, I'd opt for the smaller sizes.  They're ready almost immediately!    I love baking, but candies have always eluded me in the success category.  I am shocked that these not only turned out, but they turned out GREAT.

Terrific recipe! I made these to give away as Christmas treats, but they never made it to the tins.  They were devoured by my family in less than 48 hours.  The only thing different that I did was to put the pot(of praline ingredietns) in a ice water bath prior to spooning them onto the baking sheet.  If you do this, make sure you stir the mixture constantly as it forms quickly.  The ice bath helps the pralines to set with a smooth texture.

Excellent praline recipe. I have just come back from a trip to Savannah Georgia and brought River Street Sweets pralines home with me. My family loved them so much they begged me to make some pralines and I have to say, this recipe is very close to River Street Sweets. River Street Sweets pralines have a little more depth in flavor. I used light cream instead of milk. I let them sit 2 to 3 minutes before I poured them onto my cookie sheet. That seemed about the right amount of time...sooner and they would have been too liquidy and too much longer they would have been too hard. Next time I make these I will try using buttermilk.

This is a great praline recipe- I've never made them before and this was the first and will be the only
recipe I try! Relatively easy- I'd just note that if you don't wait for the pralines to cool down a bit before
spooning them out, they'll run all OVER the place and though they will still taste great, you'll have a real
mess on your hands....yum! Pralines rule!

It is a great Recipe.  I loved it very much.  I strongly suggest to toast the pecans regardless if they are fresh or bagged-  It does enhance the flavor or the Pralines.  Just a suggestion-  If you are looking for an adult twist- Mix in a 1/4 cup of bourbon and Whiskey in with the pecans.  They are a great bang for the holidays.  :)

These pralines are excellent.  I use exactly the same recipe which I got when attending a cooking class 20 years ago at the New Orleans School of Cooking on Decatur Street in New Orleans.  The instructions  in my recipe are to cook mixture to soft ball stage then remove from heat and stir until mixture starts to thicken and become cloudy.  Immediately start to drop candy by spoonfuls onto large piece of parchment paper working quickly before the candy sets.  Allow to cool before removing from paper.

I am from New Orleans and my dad made these all the time. The only thing I changes I made is, using heavy cream instead of milk. It makes them creamier, also my pecans were not toasted and you can use coconut too.

So easy. Just like River Street Sweets Pralines. Now I don't have to wait to go to Myrtle Beach every summer to have some pralines.

These are so wonderful!  Super easy to make.  I made these twice already - the first time I used the ice bath like others suggested but I think it cooled my praline batter too quickly so my pralines were crumbly and lumpy.  Second time I just beat for 2-3 minutes away from heat and they came out much better.  I added 1/2 tsp of salt and used half n half instead of whole milk.  Definitely a keeper - I brought these to work for a cookie tasting event, and they were gone before the event even started - they were that delicious.

I made this exactly as it calls for.  I lived in New Orleans for years and this recipe comes the closest to Aunt Sally's pralines!  At first I was afraid they were going to be the chewy kind, but once they set up they were PERFECT!  I stir mine continuously like they do at Aunt Sally's (last time I was there was a three weeks ago).  The only thing different I did was add more pecans but only bc I have a ton of them in my backyard.  When it started to boil I looked at the clock and added four minutes to the time.  It might sound crazy but it worked for me.  I wll post a pic too--it was taken RIGHT after I put them down on parchment paper, before they set up fully but I can assure you it didn't take them long to set up.

Way too many suggestions in the reviews, so let me make another one. I recommend NOT using the ice bath if you use buttermilk or evaporated milk. But if you do and it gets hard too quickly, put it back on the stove on low, add a touch of milk, and let it remelt before dropping onto the wax paper. It may have some crystals but you will save the recipe!

This recipe is okay, instead of milk I used 2/3 cup evaporated milk(makes them creamier) 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, and waited to add the vanilla til they we're cooling so you could taste it more.   I don't have a candy thermometer so I did the soft ball test. (put a cup or 2 of water in a bowl with ice cubes, let it get cold while cooking, then drop a small amount in ice water if you can form a soft little ball out of the mixture that flattens down when removing it from the ice water its ready!)   After cooking I put pan in ice bath, added vanilla and pecans, and constantly stirring, it will thicken up within a minute or two, then I spoon out on wax paper!  Yummy!!

Excellent recipe...I modified it a little based on other reviews.  

I mixed white sugar, brown sugar, butter, 1/2 c EVAPORATED milk, and 1/2 tsp salt until smooth and melted together before adding pecans. 

I stirred gently the entire time until it reached "soft ball" stage using thermometer.

Removed from heat and added vanilla and stirred 3 minutes off of heat.

Instead of using cookie sheet, I used cupcake tins for better portion control and perfection!!  These are a HUGE hit!!!

I just tried this recipe after flopping at another praline recipe. I also did the ice bath for about 30-45 seconds at the most while continuously stirring the mixture. After the ice bath I put the mix into a mixing bowl and let it sit for about 2-3 mins tops (like another reviewer). Then I  mixed it at med speed for about 1-2 minutes. They turned out perfect! I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  The only thing I would change is, I would add the pecans after mixing it in the mixer (if you do that part). They got chopped up and I like them whole.   Otherwise..deeelicious!! Very comparable to River Street Sweets.  FYI - a friend of mine who frequents River Street asked them what ingredients they used for their pralines... They told her canned milk. I'm guessing evaporated milk. Might be something to try for some extra richness.

Looking at all the positive reviews I must be the only one that is doing something wrong... After falling in love with the pralines at River Street Sweets I decided at $17.99 a pound I'd better find a cheaper alternative before I go broke. I did everything according to the recipe. I used butter milk. I didn't do the ice bath step most people were suggesting. I let it cool at room temp while stirring. It poured and set up like it was going to work. After it completely cooled I attempted to peel off of wax paper and it fell apart. I was able to get one complete piece off the paper but it crumbled in my hand. It tasted okay but it was very grainy. I may try it one more time but only an insane person does the same thing and expects a different result. Any advice on what I am doing wrong?

The ingredients were perfect.  Using the advice of users FRALTONY and kikinola, mine came out perfect the first time (and only time I have ever tried to make them).  My only additional tip would be to use Canter sugar (extra fine ground) instead of regular white sugar.  Great recipe!

My husband and I have talked about the Pralines from River Street Sweets ever since our weekend visit to Charleston, SC 3 years ago.  We live on the West Coast...I'm not sure they even know what a praline is out here.  Well, now I'm 10 weeks pregnant and had a sudden craving for Pralines. This recipe is great.  I did use 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup milk.  They so closely resemble River Street Sweets I'm not sure I'd be able to tell the difference in a tast test.  Did ice bath for a couple of minutes, and let them cool for a couple of minutes.  Came out perfect.

I made this after reading several reviews and made a few changes based on suggestions and the came out PERFECT!  1st of all use evaporated milk. Second do not use the cold water bath but rather after reaching the proper temp remove from the heat and continue to stir for a few minutes until the mixture begins to tighten up just slightly then spoon onto parchment paper. The texture was perfect!!

A candy recipe that worked! (Thanks for all the helpful hints in the reviews!). Here is something I tried that was such a huge hit, I thought I'd share.  Make the recipe according to instructions, remove from heat and stir, stir.  But before it gets too thick, pour over 3-5 quarts popcorn and toss until it finishes crystallizing.  Praline popcorn is even better than caramel corn!

The best!  I grew up in New Orleans and since I moved away Ive missed eating pralines.  These are the pralines I remember as a kid.  I used half & half and it came out perfect.

AH-mazing!!! I bought some boxed pralines from a well known NOLA bakery from another well known brand name discount store that were quite pricey for 4 pralines...but I figured if they were half as good as some I had when there then it was worth it and I couldn't get into too much trouble with 4 of them...;-) haha Well I'll never buy another again- this was my first attempt at pralines though I am a baker- not too well versed in candy but my father JUST gave me his mother's old candy thermometer so I was thrilled to use it and give this a shot. Thanks for the recipe but just as much thanks for the comments. I read every one believe it or not! Definitely missing a crucial step that it appears left some reviewers pulling their hair out and giving a poor review. You MUST let it cool down some WHILE stirring vigorously- I know it's probably an "art" as so many southern recipes are and you learn by doing over and over what it will look like when it's perfect but I tell you what- I think I was pretty darn close- gets somewhat opaque and thickens up a little. But a word to the wise- have everything you even think you will need within reach- I still ended up rushing when the parchment slipped off and I lost my smaller spoon into the mix when I set it down to fix it- too hot to get so had to get a new one... all ended well but that could have ruined the whole thing!:) My last two were almost too set up to "drop" nice and smooth! Used evap. milk and def. roasted pecans in dry skillet.

I couldn't have made this without KikiNola. I used almonds, almond milk, and Earth Balance to make it vegan but her tips about cooking the mixture were important!

PLEASE READ If you plan to use this recipe! I made these pralines 2 nights ago and it was a total FAILURE. I followed it precisely which was a MISTAKE.  After the mixture was  at correct temp I took off heat and proceeded to spoon out on baking sheet! I had I had a gooey sticky MESS that spread out all over the baking sheet and never set up! I should have read the reviews that recommended a cooling in a ice bath before spooning out otherwise you will have a ugly mess on your hands.

I've never tried Pralines but gave it a go.  For my taste, this was way too sweet so I won't make it again.  The only change I made was I added a 1/2 tsp. of baking soda (as suggested in a Martha Stewart recipe) which makes it creamier.

Boiled about 3-4 min. at a full boil. The first couple I took out of the pot were too thin, had to wait about 3-5 min. to let them cool down enough.  Didn't have a lot of ice, so I used a cold water bath.  They haze over when they start getting cool enough, and they look more creamy colored than a translucent caramel color.  They are great!

Love at first bite! The only thing that I would recommend is that ice bath, or letting it cool down for a few minutes before spooning it out. No need to change anything in the recipe! Thank you for sharing.

These were fantastic! I read many of the reviews and took their advice. I did not toast the pecans. I chopped the pecans. I used cream instead of milk. I beat the mixture for 3-5 minutes until it got really thick.  I used a candy thermometer. My first batch was perfect. My second batch was grainy. After reading online about this problem, I stirred the mixture too much while it was boiling.  Apparently, it's best not to stir it at all.

I was up till 1 a.m. making these.  Not the recipe's fault.  I don't have enough patience for candies.  They looked great when they were done but so soft I couldn't pick one up with my fingers.  I had poured them into mini muffin pans on top of a few chocolate chips, thinking the hot mixture would melt the chocolate chips.  It did but the chocolate wouldn't adhere to the candy and I couldn't hold the candy because it was way too soft.  I read that some people with the same problem dumped it all back in a pot and heated it up again to a little higher temperature.  I did but I heated it too much,I guess, and plus it now had chocolate in it.  This time I ladled out on buttered parchment paper.  The end result was exactly like dark chocolate Turkish taffy!  It doesn't taste bad but I won't eat it!  I learned an awful lot about candy while I was waiting for it to heat though!  
1.  The heating is not a cooking process. It's an evaporation process. You're trying to evaporate the water out. The amount of water in the candy determines it's hardness/softness.
2.  The most important ingredient is patience.  It takes a long time to get it to the proper temperature and at some point it plateaus,but pay attention because after the temperature starts rising again it goes up quickly!
3.  Chocolate burns at a lower temperature than sugar, so don't get impatient and jack the heat up because it's taking too long or you might burn the chocolate if it's in the recipe.
4.  Don't make candy late!

I am a southern girl and pralines have always been my favorite candy... Unfortunately not everybody makes pralines the same and they don't always taste good! My mom use 4 ingredients, white sugar, milk, butter, & pecans.  I cannot seem to duplicate her delicious candy and It's been a long time(like 20 years or more) since I made pralines but I ran across this recipe and decides to try it. It is a winner!!! I made the following changes... I used a small can of evaporated milk instead and I accidentally used dark brown sugar instead light brown sugar and they turned out terrific!!! Yum!!! I had to make another batch because they did not late after my sister and brother got a hold of them! This will be my go to recipe cause they're so tasty that anybody who eats them will say say "'Mmmm, 'vest ci Bon!"

I am from Louisiana and I normally don't make pralines because you can get them almost everywhere, but I moved to Iowa and they have no taste here so I decided to try this recipe. This is a great praline. It was easy and YUMMY. I added a half of cup of extra chopped nuts and made smaller portions then normal. If you make candy this is a recipe for you!!!

Sorry, I was disappointed in this recipe.  It was a runny mess and I wish I had read the reviews which explained about the ice bath.  I ended up having to pour it all in a pan and it just tasted like pecan pie without the crust.  I had hoped to give it as treats but ended up wasting enough ingredients for 2 batches.  Live and learn.

Spectacular!  I've never made pralines before, but I will never use another recipe!  These are great!  The first few that came out of the batch look like the ones in the picture.  I think I may have cooled the mixture too long before spooning it out, because the last ones don't look as pretty.  But they are delicious!  and the recipe was so simple.

These were sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly, and used the ice bath suggestion from a reviewer..and wanted to suggest to anyone trying this technique, do not let it sit too long in the ice- the mixture cools down really fast and made it way too thick and lumpy...not the nice glossy appearance I would expect for pralines. I think would skip the ice bath altogether next time. They were delicious anyway..thanks MARKR, for a great recipe!

This was my first time making Pralines and it was a success!  I made them for my husband who had mentioned over the years that Pralines were one of his favorites.  I have never had them before and after making them, they are a little too sweet for me (and I love sweets!).....but he loved them so I gave them 5 stars.  One change I made to the recipe after reading all the reviews was using evaporated milk instead of milk.  I was a little intimidated after reading about the ice bath, but after the successful soft ball test.....I placed the pan in cold water in the sink for a few minutes trying to cool it down.  I didn't think it was a big deal if the first ones were hotter and flatter....I just came back to those a few moments later and added more to the tops.  One thing I may want to try differently.....and this would be more for my tastes, not my husbands.  I would like to try either cutting back on everything except the pecans or adding more pecans.  I think toasted pecans with just enough coating to cover only the nut would be really good!

I read a lot of the reviews before I attempted this, and I suggest you do the same.  Candy making takes practice and this is an expensive recipe for your first attempt at it.  The portions of the recipe are good.  Couple of things I want to mention, I do suggest using light cream or half and half instead of milk.  Buy yourself a good candy thermometer.  Mine turned out best when I cook slightly past the soft ball stage.  I like the pecans toasted, even if they are fresh.  Toasting the pecans not only smells amazing, but it intensifies the nuts natural flavors.  I toasted in the oven at 300 for 10 mins. in a single layer on a cookie sheet or stone.  Like many other reviewers, I used whole and chopped pecans and I used 2 cups instead of 1 and 1/2cups of nuts.  I waited to add the vanilla when I took the pan off the stove.  I tried the ice bath and the mixture cooled too quickly to work with.  What worked best for me was to remove from heat, beat in the vanilla and let the mixture cool naturally for a couple of mins. so it's thick but not too thick to handle.

OMG, it worked!!  I can't cook for squat and this was so easy for me.  Now, I can make these at Christmas for gifts.  I'm so excited that it actually worked and I feel like a big shot chef! My family loved them and were surprised that I pulled them off.  I've actually gotten a few good recipes from this site.  Yay! (I should add that I HAD to buy a candy thermometer in order to pull this off as I couldn't deal with the "soft ball" mystery nonsense.)

I really liked this recipe. It was easy. I am a professional chef. I always heard that these were hard to make. I do not bake much at my current job. My wife wanted me to make these for her and they turned out great the first time, due to me reading the reviews the person from new orleans helped the most.The second time I over boiled and it turned into a strange brown sugar pile but I was able to bring them back by adding a splash of milk then returning them back the heat til they first boil again and they are just as good as before. Instead of dropping them on a sheet pan I dropped them into silicone molds heart shaped and coins. They turned out great. I would only want to experiment now with some different extracts.

Amazing but lacked the detailed instructions that were Key in these turning out like they are supposed to. Read a bunch of reviews and tried again...golden. :). MUST do the ice water bath immediately after it comes to temp, whisk to incorp air and cool down THEN pour onto Silpat to cool.

Easy recipe.  Take your time and stir and use a thermometer and it is fail proof.  I have had the best pralines in Charleston SC and this recipe is just like them.  I would also increase pecans to 2 cups.  Delicious!

These are so easy and quick to make.  Decided I would try the microwave recipe before did the stovetop one.  From start to finish it takes about 20 minutes.  Watch carefully when stirring and as soon as it looks like it would hold its shape, work very quickly with two spoons to spoon out the pralines.  It sets up very fast once it starts to cool and you cannot reshape once it is spooned out or it looses its sheen.  Made about six times for Christmas gifts and family gatherings but I only got about 14 to 20 pralines of a pretty good size.

These are just like the ones at the Savannah Candy Kitchen. You need to work fast when spooning out the candy if you use the ice bath method suggested by other reviewers. The candy hardens in the pan quickly that way.

I had never attempted to make pralines, but I am so glad I tried these!  They are delicious, just like in candy/fudge shops.  This will be a holiday staple for my family!

Easy and tasty! The texture is perfect. I don't have a thermometer so I tested in cold water every 30 seconds until it balled up like the directions say. My husband said it was almost too sweet for him to eat the whole thing so I would recommend making them small so you can eat as little or as much as you want.

Made just as stated in the recipe.  These turned out perfect, I did stir with a wooden spoon for a minute or two after pulling from the heat to ensure they set correctly.

Makes a delicious candy especially when you follow the advice of other cooks and use buttermilk in the recipe.  Make sure that you cook to the soft boil level and no further.  The ice bath helps cool the candy but you need to work quickly or you will end up with a gritty mess.  That's what happened to both of my batches.  The first half of the pralines look great but as the candy cools, it becomes gritty and difficult to work with.

Sooooo good!  Taste just like River Street Sweets in Myrtle Beach!  I used half and half instead of milk.  I added vanilla after I removed the mixture from the heat.  I also used the ice bath and the mix cooled very quickly and made it hard to get the bundles onto the wax paper. Next time I will allow it to cool on its own.  But the taste was magnificent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have never made pralines before and this recipe was easy to follow and produced delicious results.  I toasted the pecans first, I might add a 1/2 cup more pecans next time because there ended up being a lot of coating (not a bad thing of course).  I am going to sprinkle these on a pumpkin cheesecake.  Yum!

Pretty good Pralines.  The taste is exactly like the ones you would find in New Orleans.  Very easy to make however, when you are spooning the pralines onto the cookie sheet, be quick, as the product hardens quickly.

These are awesome and easy. I read a few reviews and used various suggestions. I used evaporated milk instead of milk, waited until after cooking to add the vanilla, stirred in an ice bath, and boiled for three minutes vs using a candy thermometer. My husband and I love them. I might have made them a little big. I only got 10 out of one batch.

Not having a lot of candy making experience, I was a bit nervous making this recipe.  It was so easy and SOOO good!!  I followed the advice of several others and used 2 c. toasted pecans, 1/2 t salt, and used evaporate milk.  I didn't have any ice on hand for an ice bath, so I just used cold water.  It turned out perfectly.  I'll definitely be making these again!!

Perfect - just like I remember from growing up in Texas. I am not an experienced candy maker and these turned out great on my first try! As soon as it reached temperature (about 3 minutes after starting to boil - I checked frequently with my electronic food thermometer), I removed the pan from heat and stirred briskly for a couple of minutes to let it cool and start to thicken a bit before dropping by the spoonful onto parchment paper (I did not do any ice bath as some other reviewers have done). Then I proceeded to nearly make myself sick scraping the leftover candy from the pan and eating it. :)

I make these pralines every year for the holidays, they are fabulous!  I stir and let mine cool for a few minutes, then pour into paper cupcake liners so they don't spread out so much.  Love to give as gifts, along with Remarkable Fudge.

Really great recipe (simple if you own a candy thermometer!).

I was out of vanilla however and substituted that for 1/2tsp of Almond Extract. 

Also, I did not use toasted pecans, just raw pecans.
I added them after the mixture was at temp. Then I mixed it all continuously till it stopped being glossy and started thickening. Then I put then on a sheet to cool.

Amazing.

These are so sweet!  But I wouldn't expect less from a praline!  I let mine cool almost too much sitting on the counter.  I barely touched the pan to the ice bath after cooling and they lost their shine and were ready to scoop.  They started to crystalize just as I was scooping the last two.  My batch made eight large pralines with some sugary goodness leftover!

I never made pralines because I thought it would be harder than making the old fashioned fudge.  I was wrong.  I just made these and they were easy and delicious.  However, I did didn't toast the pecans and I left it in the icewater a bit too long and some of them were chunky -- but still so tasty it was hard to stop eating them.

Here's my bit of advice.  If you do not have a candy thermometer, and this is your first time making candy, do yourself a favor and go get one before you try this!  I used the water glass "soft ball" test, but as a first-timer, I was unsure, and missed the perfect stage by a bit and ended up with sugar coated nuts that didn't stick together too well.  They are super tasty, though, and I am ready to head out and buy a thermometer so I can try again!

Omg, delicious!  When I die, I hope heaven has these pralines! 
I'm from GA, and got this recipe because another reviewer said it resembled the ones from River Street Sweets in Savannah (which are to die for!).  They do, and they're awesome!  The pralines at RSS are really expensive, so I'm super stoked that these taste almost exactly like them.  I will be making lots for holiday gifts, and this recipe is DEFINANTLY finding a place in my recipe box!

Not sure what happened but we tried this twice and ended up with a sugary mess. At least we salvaged the pecan to use in another recipe

I've never made pralines before, and I've always been intimidated by candy thermometers.  This was the most delicious praline recipe ever!

Wow, it sounds like most of you have a little different method of making pralines work for you. Being an inexperienced northerner, I followed the recipe amounts, with the following amalgamation of reviewers’ advice:

I followed the recipe to the tee. But pralines came out rock hard and ended up being a tooth filling puller

After reading the reviews, I tried transferring the mixture to an ice bath.  It cooled so fast it was impossible to spoon out, and turned into a crumbly mess.  Second batch, I just turned off the burner and stirred till it started to thicken, and used a small ice cream scoop to portion out.  I still had to be quick about it, but they were perfect.

The taste is right, but knowing the exact moment to spoon them out is going to take a few tries.  No need to use ice bath - a minute or so of stirring with a wooden spoon and it all suddenly started to get stiff.  If you can figure out that moment just before, start spooning it out onto your parchment quickly!  The first half are perfect (if not the perfect shape) but the last half started to get to that crumbly stage.  Worth trying again for sure and I'll get it right eventually!

Awesome recipe!  Just like they make in New Orleans!  Only change I made was to decrease white sugar to 1 cup and increase brown sugar to 1 1/4 cups.  This brings out the maple(y) flavor. I also did not toast my pecans, but only because I didn't have time.  They were still great! I will definitely be making more of these.

These were EXACTLY like the pralines I had in the French Quarter in New Orleans. I've been literally drooling about them ever since I left NOLA and I am SO happy that I found a recipe for what I've missed (and talked about) so much. I did a lot of research and looked at a lot of recipes to make pralines and although this was my first try, this is what I'd do again.I've never made any candy before and don't have a candy thermometer so I was nervous but these were super easy. As far as temperature goes, I used a meat thermometer (which went up to 220) and then after it maxed out, I used the soft-ball in ice method. It worked very well (I watched a couple of YouTube videos to help understand what I was looking for). As far as ingredients go, I waited to add the pecans until after the sugar mixture was boiling. I added the vanilla after I removed the mixture from heat. I did not place the pot in an ice bath. I simply removed from heat and continued to stir for about 3 minutes. I could feel and see the mixture thickening and glossing over. The first couple that I scooped out turned out PERFECTLY but by the last couple, the mixture had cooled down significantly in the pot so I'd recommend having your baking sheet directly next to the pot and moving quickly to get it out of the pan. The last couple still taste AMAZING but they're just a little messier looking. I was going to bring this to work for my coworkers but I don't think they're gonna make it through the weekend in my house.

Very easy, even when my NEW candy thermometer didn't work... checked a rough estimate temp with a meat thermometer, and it still worked.  Very good flavor- and since I'm physically disabled, and can't do the individual 'scoops', I spread them on a parchment lined cookie sheet, and cut them into even pieces the next morning.  They are great !

So authentic tasting and completely addictive.  I would also agree with those who add more pecans.  These are very sweet.  The stirring is important to get right.  I had to make a few batches before I really got it.  Now it is a family tradition.

Have never tried making pralines before or even eaten one for that matter.  I read most of the reviews and tips before trying this one.  First thing I did was buy myself a candy thermometer. According to my taste tester, they came out great!  I will be saving this recipe and making them again.

I really missed these after leaving New Orleans, and it is great to find such an easy recipe to make them. I find it is best to let the mix cool a few minutes before spooning it out, because I've noticed its always the last ones that I spoon out that set first.

The taste was good but the directions weren't. I did everything it said except i used walnut cause i didn't have any pecans and then poured it over the top of a cake. it was good but it was real runny and made a HUGE mess! i think that ice bath idea would've been real helpful.

Great recipe! I love the pralines from River Street Sweets and these come pretty darn close. My husband couldn't stop eating them! I will definitely make these again. I didn't use a themometer but followed the instructions using the cold water. It worked great. It was almost like making the candy that coats candy apples. One other way to tell that the mixure is ready is when you get a good rolling boil and there are big bubbles. The color darkens just a bit. Try this recipe. You won't regret it.

I am a huge fan of River Street Sweets in Savannah, GA so I made these pralines and they taste exactly like the ones from River Street Sweets!  Everyone in my family enjoyed them so much!!  I did use the ice bath and it worked perfectly for the exact consistency that I needed.  Great yummy recipe!

I used to live in Atlanta, and would buy pecan pralines for my mom for Christmas.  Then we moved, and now I can't find them.  A friend suggested this recipe - I was nervous since I have never made candy and am no expect chef.  But this recipe was fairly easy and DELICIOUS.  They taste amazing.  I used 2 cups of pecans (1.5 cups halves and 1/2 cup pieces), buttermilk, and the ice bath.  I bought a candy thermometer for the first time, and I'm glad I did.  I made the first batch as a test batch, but they're so good I'm bringing them to a party tomorrow.  I hope they last that long, and I don't eat them all first!  DELICIOUS pralines.

Very very good recipe! This was my first time to make pralines, and a candy thermometer and I don't get along, but it was easy to do by the water test. So very creamy, I used buttermilk instead of milk, and did the ice bath, poured 1/2, iced again and poured the rest. Awesome flavor, I will look no further, this recipe is a keeper to use over and over! Thank you for making pralines easy!

I prefer a chewy caramel praline, but my husband LOVED these.  I didn't even have enuff to give as gifts as planned b/c he pilfered them!  For awhile I had to hide them from him!!!  So needless to say they are yummy!  I substituted the milk for half and half b/c I didn't have any regular cow's milk.

These were fairly good, but not exceptional. I did not use a candy thermometer and I'm sure they'd be a bit better using one, as I didn't understand the pouring into water thing. I would also add more pecans next time as I love them.

This was my first attempt at making pralines and I was delighted with the results. We had just visited the French Quarter in New Orleans and I fell in love with their pralines. But these are not as creamy as theirs, a little more sugary. I did use Half n Half instead of evaporated milk so I don't know if this made a difference. I was very happy that they turned out on my first attempt. I cooked them to 239 deg which caused them to set up perfectly. Maybe I will never taste Pralines like the ones in Lousianna but I can hope.

it was okay - yet I think I added a bit to much butter, maybe a tablespoon or two more..they turned out rather buttery..I followed a reviewers advice of the ice bath for about half of them, but they weren't as good as the other half which were partially cooled and then spooned on the sheet.  It would also have been better if I had toasted the pecans first..but, they're still good! - for ice cream, cheesecakes, etc.   Nothing beats the old-fashioned Louisiana pecan pralines though - mmmmm-mmmmmmmh.

Great recipe!! To make it a little more killer on the sweet tooth, I added sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk.

Tastes great and easy to make. Use 1/2 cup heavy cream in lieu of the milk and it's simply divine!

Made it according to recipe, added a pinch of salt and some hot water when it got too  thick to pour into pralines.  They were beautiful and delicious; not crumbly at all. I'm trying them again and hope the first time was not a fluke!

These are delicious!  I made them similar to above but since  this was the first time I'd ever made them, I used  2t vanilla (it as actually an accident but it turned out great).  I used the ice bath method from one reviewer,  but it crystallized too fast.  I also used the beating method from another viewer -  which is beating the mixture after it reaches soft ball stage until it develops a matte sheen. The texture should have tiny crystals. The pralines should snap when you break them, and melt in your mouth.  I will be using this recipe again with my changes in the near future with my changes!  Oh, and I also used FRESH TEXAS PECANS!

Delicious, but fiddly and needs better directions.  If you ladle out the syrup at the top heat, it is runny and takes a crazy long time to set, if it ever does. You need to let it cool just a little first.

I've used this pecan praline recipe at AllRecipes many times because it has six ingredients, its quick and easy. The more times you make it the better you get at it, especially with all the pecans falling off the trees right now! I like how you put all of the ingredients in the pan at once and stir.
If you do not have a candy thermometer...drop a small amount of syrup in cold water, (double check and verify this) if a ball forms take it off the fire and start ladling onto parchment paper.  Yummy homemade candy in thirty minutes. A great gift to give someone in a tin. Yes, I would make it again!

Made these just as written, followed the suggestion of stirring until lightened in color and used evaporated milk. They are delicious and melt in your mouth.  I also waited to add the vanilla until the mixture came up to temperature and was off the heat so the vanilla flavor stayed strong.  Make these and you’ll have Savannah at home.

These are fantastic!  If you don't like sweet candy, this is not for you but Pralines are supposed to be sweet.  I followed the directions exactly (except I used 2 cups pecans and evaporated milk instead of regular milk).  I toasted my pecans on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes at 350 degrees first (just personal preference). I don't have a candy thermometer so I just watched for the soft ball stage.  Took about 4 minutes after it started slowly boiling.  Once  I removed it from heat, I just continued to slowly stir it with a spoon (3-4 minutes) until it thickened up enough to hold a shape.  Then quickly spooned them out onto non-stick tinfoil.  They turned out perfect!!  I got 26 medium sized pieces out of it but next time I think I will use a teaspoon and make them smaller bite-sized.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  It's a keeper!

As easy as advertised!  I agree with the reviewer that recommended “whipping” the batch after it reached temperature.  I stirred it aggressively for a few minutes to let it cool.  And I added a pinch of salt.

It was perfect but, I prefer without roasting the pecans. Next time I will just use fresh pecans. You got to be fast when laying them out once they begin to set.  I didn't use the ice, only stirred to cool

Just finished making theses. Do not use an ice bath in Florida. They harden instantly! Luckily, I put the pan back on the stove, added a splash of evaporated milk until it remelted, then took off stove, let it cool naturally for 2 minutes, voila, pefection!!!

I have been making these pralines for a few years now & this is the best & easiest recipe. Getting ready to make some for this year! Love pralines!!! I let them cool for about 2-3 minutes as other reviewers suggested instead of the ice bath. I have also been substituting evaporated milk for the regular like other reviewers suggested.

Tasted great but ran a bit at soft ball temp.   The Nawlin's cook is correct....needed to bead with a spoon a bit after it reached temp to form the sheen and crystalize.

This is my first time with pralines, I made these exactly how the recipe said, except that I did not have enough pecans so I just added a couple handfuls of walnuts, also I didn't have a candy thermometer so I just boiled it for 3 mins like one of the reviews suggested.

Once I finished I was skeptical about doing an ice bath, but it didn't start thickning for a minute or 2 so I decided to do the ice bath, worked amazing and set barley a minute after I poured them. they tasted fabulous, I will definitely we making these again??

Heated to 230 degrees.  Tried to make individual patties but  it spread into one big soupy mess.  So I refrigerated and scooped into little balls flattened them enrobed in chocolate; made turtles!!!

First time making pralines. They’ve always intimidated me but I finally remembered that I do, in fact, have a candy thermometer. Made all the difference in the world. They were a little grainy but I suspect that had something to do with my having to fine the right setting on my stove. Flavor was excellent.  These will be a regular part of the Christmas cookie trays from now on.

Delicious and easy, the only thing I did different was substituted heavy cream for the milk.  We prefer the added richness to the flavor.  I only make these during the holidays so we splurge a bit as we are skim milk drinkers.  My family loves these.

This is my first 'review' ever ... I love to cook but it turns out I am a terrible candy maker! Following the recipe with the help of the many tips by reviewers, my first batch was awful, hit that crumbly stage, not good when you are making Christmas gifts! 
I put sad little crumbly, grainy wads on a pan to cool, until I could no longer get the last half out of the pan, it had become so hard. I decided to add a new batch of ingredients to the remainder in the pan, and voila! It all melted into the soft ball stage, and by correcting my previous errors, I was able to come up with some pretty good pralines. So, emboldened by my success, I took the crumbly little wads from my first batch, put them in the pan and made a fresh batch on top of them with the same happy results. 
Morale of the story, don't give up if you mess up, just remelt and start over! Thanks for the recipe.

I used 1/4 c. buttermilk, 1/4 c. heavy cream (instead of milk) - these were melt in your mouth delicious! Agree with all comments to cool down a bit before spooning onto parchment paper.

Great recipe very easy to make.  Just be sure to stir constantly so it doesn't burn.  As other said, when you get it to the right heat/consistency remove the pan and place it in a ice bath to keep it from burning while you spoon it out.

The mix was good - but the recipe (instructions) are lacking. The timing of adding the ingredients is completely absent and the cooking temperature is simply wrong.

I made this and loved it!  I'm from Louisiana and know what good pralines taste like and this was good.  I must admit I had to make a few adaptations because I didn't have all of the necessary ingredients but it still turned out wonderful.  Instead of regular milk I used whipping cream.  I didn't have real butter so I used margarine.  I figured the fat in the whipping cream would offset the lack of fat in the margarine.  I didn't have regular vanilla, so I used vanilla, butter and nut flavoring.  In one of the other reviews, someone said stirring after cooking was key so I tried that.  I agree this gave the candy a  nice shine.  Instead of dropping them by the spoonfuls, I spread the entire amount onto the foil and let cool.  After cooling I broke it into pieces. I did it this way because I'm using the pralines to make pralines & cream ice cream.  Otherwise, I would have dropped the candy by the spoonfuls to make them come out prettier.  I will definitely use this recipe again but may try it using the original ingredients to see which I like best.  I tried one of the microwave recipes and it turned out horribly!

Delicious.  I roasted the pecans for 15 mins on 250, added 1/4 c. coconut, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp sea salt.  It was my very first candy-making experience, besides fudge.  I used the ice bath for about 2 mins and left the pecans and vanilla out until the very end.  It started thickening so quickly after adding the pecans, that I'd add them next time just as I was taking the pot off the stove, before the ice bath. I used evaporated milk and love the texture - not grainy.  Made them for Valentine's day, since we just got back from a trip to South Carolina and Florida where I had my first taste of pralines.  ( I wasn't too impressed, actually) Since my sweetheart has such a sweet tooth, I decided to give them a try, now I'm a fan.  There will be a next time to improve on this experience - Christmas for sure.

The mixture should cool for a few minutes before dropping spoonfuls on a cookie sheet.  I dropped mine right away and they ran together.  The flavor is still great, though!

I have no candy making experience, but these were so easy to make and came out perfect the first time. I put aside the vanilla to add when I removed the concoction from the heat, but I completely forgot about it. It tasted good anyway, but next time I won't forget it.
 I read the other reviews about using an ice bath and stirring the mixture for a few minutes. I just filled up the sink with a few inches of cold water and this worked fine. You can tell when it is ready to be poured out and you should do this quickly as it will start to set in the pan. 
The next time I make these I will use more pecans and be sure to add the vanilla.
My partner loved these and we at the whole batch in 3 days. I plan on making these as gifts for the office and to have around the house for the holidays. 
Thank you for posting!

My dad always used to be able to tell that magic moment when pralines were just about to harden, but I have not picked up that skill. After one failed test batch, for the next one I just stirred the pecans (double the recommended amount) right into the bowl. It wasn't pretty, but it made delicious praline-coated pecans!

I made it twice yesterday. The first time, I used a pan that was too big, so my thermometer couldn't be clipped on. It set up incredibly fast. I didn't even have time to add the vanilla. I think I overcooked it. The second time was perfect. I removed it from the heat sooner, cooled it with cold water while I stirred it so it could thicken slightly before scooping... I had JUST enough time to scoop it all out on the foil. The very last one was dry and crumbly because It had set up before being dropped onto the foil for formation... the real test will be my bf's reaction when I give them to him. He told me pralines were his favorite, so whallaahhh!!! Pralines!!!

yum.  Im not an expert on what pralines are supposed to taste like, but these are delicious.  Wonderful nutty flavor throughout and just a bit crunchy.

Definitely be prepared.  I cooked to 238 degrees.  Would likely stop at 235 next time.  Candy hardened quickly.  Wish I would have chopped the pecans but tastes yummy.

flavor was very good just what I have been looking for but I still need practice on making them with a thicker syrup so that it is not runny. This is my fault since I need to figure out how to properly use the candy thermometer.  I stopped cooking it where it said soft ball but it was still a little runny.  Also I would change the amount of pecans.  I had a 2 cup bag as it still was not a lot of pecans so next time I will get a bigger bag or pecans so the pralines will be full.  I am from Louisiana and always wanted to know how to make these.

I haven't made candy in at least 10 years but this was easy! I used more pecans and evaporated milk and it turned out great! No candy thermometer but still easy.  Took only about 10 minutes also.

They are excellent! Substituted half and half for the milk, and used coconut palm sugar instead of brown sugar. Very tasty. Used some when I made pralines and cream ice cream. This is the second pralines recipe I have tried, and this one beat the other (from Emeril Lagasse). A definite keeper!
