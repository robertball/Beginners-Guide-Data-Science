Very tasty.  I found that if the pork cooked a little longer (like a minute or two) than just till it surfaced, it made the flavor more robust.

This tastes awesome, but may be the nutrionally worst dish I've ever prepared.  For true pork steaks (cut from pork shoulder) and deep frying, the fat content is probably more like 150g per serving.

Delicious! The only thing I did didfferently was to soak my steaks in buttermilk for about an hour before cooking, this helps tenderize them and I just love the flavor. These are my family's favorite new way to have fried pork. Thanks.

LOVED this steak. I love pork steak, and I'm excited to find a great new way to make it. If you don't have all the spices, make it anyway. I didn't have cinnamon, tumeric or paprica and it still was wonderful. I can't wait to try it again when I have them all. I also used regular salt instead of seasoned salt and I'm glad I did. I think that a dose of Johnny's would have been too much. (It's saltier than table salt and has an artificial flavor I don't care for.) This was great!

This was very good.  My first time actually deep frying a pork steak, but the seasonings were wonderful.  Very tasty.  I served it with some kicked up peas, and some potatoes.

Has a nice texture and flavor.  I also dipped and soaked it in buttermilk before patting in the breading.  It was great and cooked fairly fast in oil.  Its good enough for company any day.  Its a great change.

Used Soy flour instead of all-purpose flour for an awesome low-carb dish...the soy flour has a bit of a different taste, but this is the only way I've tried it and we still loved it!

This is a great recipe, tried it two times so far and both times it turned out great, but instead of putting the entire pork steaks in I chop them up into little bite size nuggets, and they cook beautifully!

I really enjoyed the flavors in this, and like others before me I was a little nervous about the combination.  It was really flavorful, with the warm hint of cinnamon.  I cut the breading and spices in half for 2 large pork steaks, and still had some left over.  I pan fried these in oil rather than deep fry and it took a while to cook all the way thru.  I'll make this again with boneless cutlets... Something that will cook faster.  Thanks for sharing a great spice mix!

Easy and good flavor. I thought that some of the spices might over power. Not the case. The only change that was made was to leave out the basil because I was out. When fried pork is going to be made I will use this recipe.

This was very good! My sons who never eat anything ate this down and then asked for more. Not something that I will serve often just because it is so not good for you but is one for when the kids are at grandma's.

Delicious recipe! This crust is amazing! But the buttermilk soaking is a must! The little bit of cinnamon gives it an excellent taste. And the crust is so thick and crispy but the pork is so tender. I'll be using this batter for fried chicken as well!

Excellent! Very tasty and quite easy to cook, even though I thought it would be harder in the grease to tell if they were done or not.

Like others, I didn't have all the spices in my cabinet, but  tried it anyway at my son's insistence.   Everyone loved it!  Used previous suggestions of cooking it just a tad longer than "when it floats" and it was great!  Husband commented on how juicy it was.  Flavor was great, but I bet it would have been better if I had all the ingredients!

I used thin cut pork chops and my own spicy chicken flour seasoning. It's was crispy and tender. When grilling season is over  this is how I will cook pork chops from now on.

This was WONDERFUL!  I omitted the regular salt.  I felt the seasoned salt was very adequate.

This is incredible!  Tried it once and my boyfriend asked for it 3 more times in the next couple of weeks!  Huge hit! I've also used this recipe for chops.

This is an excellent deep fried pork chop recipie. Also easy to get right. I doubled the recipie and ended up with almost twice as much flower as needed. Maybe using number of pork chops rather than pounds (to better capture surface area) would be an emprovement. In any case delicious. I did brine my pork chops for a few hours before breading them and served with salad, mashed potatoes, and gravy. Everyone loved them!

Didn’t have the cumin but it still turned out pretty good! Cooked 6 of these for 10 minutes on each side...this was my first time actually cooking but I’m really proud of myself. Very easy for beginners!

It’s a good breading but it smells better than it tastes. Don’t get me wrong, it tastes good but it needs a sauce really bad.

OMG - I've made several times.  To die for flavor, that I actually crave.  Healthy?  No, not really...but so worth it.  I do put half of the recipe aside in for next time, as to not contaminate it all.  I've found plenty for two meals.

i loved this recipe.  i had all but one ingredient and it was delish. my daughterk even liked it.  a different  but very delishous tasting.
