When Hubs remarks “This is another of those dishes I really like that I’ll never see again,” you know you have something here!  (Except for family favorites I rarely prepare the same dish twice)  This is just excellent; a flavorful and satisfying comfort food that doesn’t bog down in an overload of spices or any processed ingredients.  I started off with boneless country-style ribs that I cut into small pieces before browning them in bacon grease.  I cooked the onion separately, a good long while before continuing on with the recipe, and used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder.  Given that I scaled this down to three servings (one pound of meat) for Hubs and me, it wasn’t practical for me to open up a can of beef broth for the small amount called for.  Red wine filled in nicely (I happened to have a glass handy :)  I used twice the amount of tomatoes called for (a full can for the 3-serving recipe I made) and in my view it was just right.  Rather than stirring the sour cream into the mix I gave each plate a dollop of it upon serving and when I make this again I’ll do it the same way.   I served this over buttered wide noodles and garnished it with chives.  I’m not sure just what made this so darn good, the bacon maybe or the sweet Hungarian paprika, but this humble dish was a real sleeper hit tonight.

Almost like mom's. I made a few changes to what I remember being in the dish as a child. I halved the recipe. Skipped the bacon and opted to use canola oil instead of the bacon grease. Sauteed onion, a few cloves of minced garlic, handful each of frozen diced green and red bell pepper. Added the diced pork (used a 1/4-1/2 pork loin roast, relatively lean) then tossed in the seasonings, including a beef bouillon cube for the beef broth. I also squeezed in a generous teaspoon or two of sweet red (bell?) pepper paste. Let it cook down until pork was nearly fully cooked. Added the can of diced tomatoes and water mixed with enough browned flour to thicken (this is the liquid part used combined with the beef bouillon cube to replace the beef broth). I let this practically come to a rolling boil and 'simmered' for about 30 minutes then added half a small container of sour cream and 2-3 generous shakes of Parmesan. Lowered the heat to a light simmer, just enough to meld the cheese and sour cream into the sauce. Served over linguine (not traditional, but that's all we had) and had the shaker on the side if anyone wanted extra cheese (you could say the addition of the Parmesan is an American touch/take on the dish). I'm half Hungarian, and this is comfort food at its best (for me, at least!). As a side note, there are two types of Hungarian paprika- The 'hot' being spicy, and 'edes' being mild (not spicy). It is still different from regular grocery paprika.

This recipe was quite good, I did add some cayenne pepper (1tbsp) as I had no Hungarian Paprika on hand. Hungarian Paprika is usually "spicier" than normal grocery store paprika

I have made this more than a few times, and every time it comes out delicious  :))) I follow the recipe exact everytime, sometimes I add more bacon because we love bacon in this house... I usually serve it over some sort of rice (white/jasmin/basmati) instead of the egg noodles but that's just personal choice  ;))  my bf loves pulled pork sandwiches, so when I buy a pork rib roast, I cook up the meat in my slow cooker.. I save half of the meat (about 3 or 4 Lbs), and shred it, and put it in a ziploc freezer bag in my freezer.. when I get the craving for this recipe, I just pull out the meat from the freezer and use that... I add it to the pot after I saute the bacon, onions, paprika... another thing I have done is with the left overs from this recipe the next evening, it is GREAT rolled up in a flour tortilla and baked in the oven with some extra sauce + cheese, as a enchilada! (I have added some black beans into the porkolt mixture and/or some kibblet corn, with the rice mixed in - not the noodles) is a really good way to put a spin on the leftovers... thanks for the great recipe!

This was a different recipe for us!  I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  I had to add flour to the sauce mixture because it didn't thicken up the way I would have liked.  Other than that it was a great recipe.  Definitely a weekend recipe for the all the steps and the amount of time involved.

I wanted something that wasn't beef or lamb stew, and something different from those styles. This recipe looked really interesting.
I made only a couple changes: first I had to lean it down to serve 3 people. Second I wanted to cheapen the cost down by using a lesser cut and cooking itnlonger. 
I kept the bacon at 5 slices, because we love bacon. Used 3/4 of large onion.
1/2 Green Pepper, 3/4 Red Pepper.
2/3 cup of broth was great for this quantity.
As for the pork I used 2 lbs. of pork butt; gristle & fat removed, and cut into 1 inch pieces, and I didn't change the seasoning.
I took the cook time to 3 hours to insure that the butt was tender and cooked through.
This was a excellent recipe that I had to gear towards my family and costs.
I made the Hungarian dumplings and let them cook in the sauce for the last 45 minutes.
Definitely a "keeper" recipe and will do this one again. Added to my Comfort Food recipe box!

Wow, thats all I can say-we LOVED this! I had only 1/2 lb lean pork meat, but with the bacon there was plenty of meat and flavor; I used peeled fresh tomatoes from our garden rather than canned and I had rich Labanese yogurt instead of sour cream. Oh, and I used two big cloves of garlic rather than powdered. Hubby just keeps raving about how much he liked it and I will make it again.

Porkolt = "roasted".  Since I love my slow cooker AND I'm trying to eat healthier, I decided to skip the stove method and add my own personal touches.  I omitted the bacon and bell pepper altogether (bacon for fat/cal content; bell pepper because my family detests), used fire roasted diced tomatoes and 2 large cloves of fresh minced garlic, dumped all ingredients into my 6qt. Crock Pot, used diced pork stew meat, stirred, and let it ride for 4 hrs on LOW.  I uncovered for 30 min. to let the sauce thicken.  I tried it without sour cream and then with.  It's absolutely delicious both ways but if you're trying to trim as much fat/cals as you can while still having a succulent meal, I'd say skip the sour cream - you really won't miss it.  Prepare to have your home filled with a mouthwatering aroma while it stews in its own juices.  We served it on quinoa as it's what I had in my pantry (not to mention the boost in nutrition).  This is can stand alone, however; you do not need a starch/filler.  The only thing it seemed to lack for me was spice which is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars.  I used authentic Hungarian Paprika and it gave a savory punch, but I like a little kick so next time I'll add a dash or two of chili powder.  So easy!  Can be frozen.  Serve with crusty bread and a big bowl of fruits/veggies.  Tastes even BETTER the next day.  Highly recommend - this is comfort food at its best!  =)

I honestly cannot say enough about this recipe!  It tastes just like Grandma's cooking!  I was surprised by how simple it actually was! It does take a bit of time but i assure you it is well worth it!  I did not reserve the bacon drippings (sorry Grandpa) to brown my chops or sautee the peppers in, I used a tiny bit of extra light tasting olive oil instead. Which made the prep time a little faster since I was able to do the chops at the same time as the bacon, onions and peppers.  However, I did leave a little of the bacon drippings in the pan so that the onions didn't stick.  Also, I added one fresh clove of garlic, minced, to the pot before simmering.  Next time I may up the fresh garlic and omit the garlic powder.  We LOVE the taste of fresh garlic!  This is 100% comfort food for any one who has grown up eating traditional Hungarian food!  Thank you SO much for this recipe!

This was delicious - those who found it bland were likely not using Hungarian paprika. I used even a bit more because our family likes things extra hot. I'm not sure why the directions feel so complicated, but it could be because the original recipe is a fairly large scale. I scaled down to serve 4 of us, and the whole thing was a lot simpler. Cook the bacon first, then in the bacon fat cook the onion/pepper (and garlic if using fresh), then in the same pan the pork chops. Depending on the size of your pan, the veggies and chops could maybe be cooked together, especially if you choose to cube before cooking. Then it all goes in the pot with the tomatoes/broth. Seems a lot simpler than all the back and forth described by the original recipe.

A big hit with my husband who is a kind, but discriminating critic of new recipes.  He enthusiastically gives it 5 stars as well. I used regular old American paprika, but recently found Hungarian and can't wait to try this again!

I made this recipe EXACTLY per the instructions.  This felt like it should be great based on the ingredients, but...this was bland and tasteless.  Not even my kids, who only eat non-spicy food, though it was a keeper.  Since there were several meals worth of leftovers and I hate to waste food, I added cayenne pepper to it and it was thereafter passable.  The cayenne pepper raised it to a 3 star recipe.  I would NOT make this again.

This dish was DA Dish! I skipped the peppers but it still turned out wonderful. I almost regretted adding the sour cream as I loved the sauce without it. As we are only two people, I cut the recipe in half..The leftovers were gone the next day!

we really enjoyed this recipe... it has a lot of zip without being overly hot.  I used paprika paste my aunt had brought back from Hungary and it worked out great. I also used a pork loin and sliced it up instead of using chops.  Great flavor and made really good leftovers too. Thanks!

wow what a great dinner! I made it easy by using precooked bacon and a left over pork roast. I first saw I paid the peppers and onions and added the bacon and pork with spices. However....this does not make 14 servings. it does feed a family of 5. Enjoy!

Delicious - I made this with pancetta instead of bacon and chicken broth (it's what I already had open) and cooked it on low for several hours in the oven, along with the pork chop bones for extra flavor.

I wasn't able to find the Hungarian paprika so I substituted regular paprika. I tasted good but could have had a little more "bite" to it.  Perhaps the Hungarian paprika would have added something more?  I would be interested to know what others had done. Despite it all, it certainly did clear off my family's plates in an awful hurry!

This is a good dish to train teen daughters on. It's almost foolproof and good enough to impress company. (wink, wink) You can cut the stewing time some by using thin cut breakfast chops, and I usually add a half teaspoon dried marjoram. You can omit the garlic, but it should be blessed with a half tsp (to taste) of ground caraway seed. DO not sub bad paprika. Nemes Edes (noble sweet) is the only way to go. Brands: King Red, Pride of Szeged or Papa. Or buy from a good dealer like Penzey's. HUngarians use banana peppers, I agree but I will sub green bells but not yellow, for their richer flavor. Beef broth is a bit heavy, some would prefer chick broth. Tomatoes: try fire-roasted or chef-cut. I use Red Gold. Can be served over (!) mashed potatoes, or with Hungarian noodles (csipetke, galuska, spaetzle) or, in a pinch, some farfalle or medium shells. The BP is, IMO, optional; I don't use it. Best bacon is uncured slab, but I think Hormel makes an uncured thin cut. I'm am making this tonight. I will go heavy on the bacon! This dish is VERY forgiving, so go for it.

I did not have pepper so I left them out. It turned out great even without them, but I will be putting them in next time because it sounds good.

I just can't pass up a great sale on meat, which is how this recipe came to be in our kitchen. $1.49 a pound for bone-in pork chops was just too tempting.  So there I was, with a family sized pack. I had saved this recipe awhile ago, and as I searched, it came up. First, I cut off the bones, which found new life in a lovely Tuscan ragu. Then, I set about making this recipe pretty much as written. The only changes I made were that I used fresh garlic to replace the powder, and only half of the yellow pepper, as the vegetable has no true fans in this house. It proved to be a wise move. The peppers could be tasted, but the taste wasn't in-your-face. I had carmelized the onion in the bacon fat, which added an additional layer of complexity. Cooked it low and slow, which allowed everything to meld.  I have no clue how anyone could possibly find this recipe bland. Done right, it's outstanding. The result is a well-orchestrated flavor, where everything retreats into the final crescendo of symphonic taste. Trying to stay faithful to the dish's Hungarian roots, I served it over fresh spätzle. The son-in-law had three plates.  Leftovers were just as good a couple of days later. Every recipe I have tried with lots of sweet paprika and sour cream is a winner, and this was no exception. This is comfort food on steroids.

I can't believe how easy and good this recipe is!  I've never had Porkolt before, so I can't say make comment on whether this is authentic.  Regardless, it is delish!  This is now on my regular rotation.  I look forward to making it!  Update:  I've made this recipe several times now.  The last time I did the fixings the night before and put it all in the crockpot.  The next morning I set the crockpot to cook on slow for 5 hours on low.  Just before serving, I stirred in the sour cream.  In another version, I had left over pork roast, cubed it and used the left-overs (Yum).  All in all, I really did not change the basics of the recipe at all except to lower the number of servings to 4 (1.5 pounds of pork stew meat).

It was really good.  I changed it up just a bit to improve the nutritional profile, without straying too far from the recipe.  It tasted amazing and I will make it again.  I also streamlined the cooking process to make it an easier dish.  I left out the bacon entirely and instead sauteed the onion and 4 cloves of garlic in EVOO.  Added the paprika and cooked that for a minute.  At that point, I added 1/3 cup of white wine and reduced that by 1/2.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients (save for the sour cream, which I reduced by the way by 75% without sacrificing taste.  In fact, it tasted phenomenal without the sour cream, as well, should you be on a cholesterol restricted diet), brought it to a boil then simmered for 90 minutes until the pork was fork tender.  I also used a red pepper instead of yellow.  You can go to Youtube or google this recipe and you will find that this manner of cooking Porkolt is very common/traditional.  Searing of the meat is not necessary!

I've made this dish many times. I LOVE it!!  Sometimes I'll substitute the egg noodles with rice for a bit of a healthier alternative, or I'll use "Acini de pepe"  tiny noodles. I also like to add a tablespoon of "vegetta" seasoning while simmering. I add a bit of Parmesan on top of each serving with a bun. YUMMY!!  :)

The changes I made were adding chilli pepper and pepper flake to make up for only having shelf paprika and 2/3 cup red wine.  I also didn't cook in separate pans, my great grandfather would roll over in his grave if everything wasn't together. We're cooking not dieting so no draining of fats. I stewed it all day, adding water when needed.  This dish is older than indoor stoves and should be cooked as if on a slow open flame. Amazing.

Really comfort food tasty - I have Hungarian heritage and didn't even have any Szedge Paprika in the house.  Had to use regular.  Used a boneless pork loin cut into cubes (cheaper than pork chops)  Used minced garlic.  Adjusted recipe for 6 servings.  Used a Dutch Oven on the stove, simmered for just over 90 minutes.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Was great next day for lunch as well.  Pork was fork tender.  Served over egg noodles as no time/energy for dumplings.

Made this tonight with a few changes and it was fabulous. I used cubed pork chops instead of whole, and ended up sauteeing the whole thing in one pan. Omitted the beef broth for a thicker sauce, and doubled the amount of bacon (because I needed to use some up!) I used authentic smoked Hungarian paprika, which definitely added the robust flavor that makes this dish so unique and flavorful. Definitely give this one a try!

I just cooked the meat right away, then added the onions and peppers, then the spices, tomatoes and beef broth. It didn't take anywhere near 90 minutes. Probably closer to 30 minutes from start to finish. It was good, but it seems to be close to a goulash. I would make it again.

This was very filling and good. The bacon made the texture a little odd, so maybe next time I will not include it... but it is definitely a keeper!

Delicious. I had to make do with what I had on hand and I skipped a lot of steps but it still came out great. I cooked the bacon then added the onion and sauteed in the same pot then browned the pork. I deglazed with a little red wine before adding the other ingredients. I used cream instead of sour cream and regular paprika.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I will make it next time with the right ingredients and I'm sure it will be even more delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe as a base as I was trying to use up left over pork tenderloin. Other than not having to sauté the pork, I followed the seasoning exactly and served it over rice.  Originally it was lunch for a girlfriend and myself (got raves) and as a left-over, left-over I served it to my husband a few nights later (more raves).  What an easy recipe and thanks for posting it - I will be making this one again!

I did not have bacon, so I made it without. It turned out very well. All seven people in our house liked it. I will absolutely male this dish again, next time i will put bacon in to see if it makes a huge difference. But any dish that satisfies all seven people in my house is worth making again.

I made modifications based on recommendations by reviewer naples34102. I made this as four servings, using 20oz of pork, an entire small yellow pepper, an entire small onion, and an entire can of diced tomatoes. I used sweet red wine in place of the beef broth as well. Served over egg noodles and topped with a dollop of sour cream and chopped green onions. My husband and I both raved over this one!

I cut the recipe and made for 2. It was actually enough for 3 nice servings. 
I have the Ninja Slow Cooker so I adjusted so I can do everything in one pan. 
I browned the bacon on high with the stove top setting. Removed it and let it rest and drain. Then I added 1 small chopped onion till it was almost translucent then added 1 pound of cubed boneless pork chops and chopped up bacon. Brown on high and then shift to medium heat. When all the pink was gone I added spices. 1/8 c paprika and adjusted garlic and pepper. 1 can diced tomatoes 1 can of beef broth. Reset the Ninja to the slow cooker low setting. 
It turned out marvelous.

I left out the onion (used garlic instead) and the peppers. Plus since my husband hates tomatoes I left those out and just used tomato soup. I also added mushrooms and corn.

I felt like it was missing something. I added salt, cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce. That made it more palette pleasing. I served it over mashed potatoes. I would make it again leaving out the bell peppers and adding the additional spices.

In a word...DELICIOUS! This is similar to a strogonoff, but with pork instead of beef and mushrooms. It is full of flavour - I didn't have Hungarian paprika, but did have smoked paprika which was very good. I halved the recipe for two of us, so there is enough left over for another meal. I pretty much followed the recipe, but instead of cooking the chops and then taking the meat off the bone, I diced the meat before browning, and then added it  AND the bones to the rest of the ingredients. I also baked it at 160C for 21/2-3 hours rather than cooking on the stove top, before adding the sour cream and serving with rice. The meat was beautifully tender. A squeeze of lemon juice over each meal would be the only extra I would add to make it even better. Take no notice of those who say this is bland and uninteresting. I think they must have missed an ingredient somewhere along the way!

As someone who makes Hungarian dishes daily, I would not make it as written. Paprika is too much in it, use wine instead of beef broth, NEVER use canned tomato, only fresh ones. As for the sour cream , it's a personal taste for everyone and would not add it but serve it on the side.

This was just "ok" in my opinion. Too much paprika, and it calls for too much pork. I also added a little more beef broth, and some portobello mushrooms, not only for their flavor, but also for their liquid. I will not be adding this recipe as a family favorite.

made this Sunday Family dinner, made to the recipe except used  trimmed country style pork instead of pork chops.  VERY tender since that is what I had on hand.  Good comfort food.    Big hit with all 3 generations.  Daughter in law asked for recipe.    Only thing, prep time took me longer than stated but that could be me.

We added this great Hungarian recipe to our recipe box, because it was easy to make and resulted in a nicely flavored dish. Although I believe the original recipe would have been good as well, I changed it a little bit.

As common in Hungarian cooking, I began by sauteing the onions on med/high in vegetable oil instead of bacon grease, stirring them frequently and making sure they didn't brown. I added a little bit of water during the process and stirred the onions for in total 10 minutes until they were soft.

I turned the heat to high, and when the onions were sizzling I added the cubes of meat together with the onion. For 5 minutes I roasted the meat while constantly stirring.

After that I reduced the heat, and stirred in the bell pepper until it softened. Stirred in the real Hungarian paprika, garlic powder, and pepper. Added the tomatoes with liquid and beef broth, and let it simmer for 2 hours.

At the end I added a pinch of hot paprika, to add a bit more kick to it, and omitted mixing in the sour cream and serving it separate instead.

Very good, we had a pork loin so we used that instead of chops.  The Paprika flavor was nice.  Thanks You!

I really liked it but the rest of the family just thought it was okay.  I halved the recipe which was just enough for a family of 4 and a little left overs.  I didn't have Hungarian Paprika so I used regular.  Fresh garlic instead of powder. Red instead of Yellow pepper and only 1/2 cup of regular sour cream.  Next time I will probably put it in the crock pot to make things easier.  I diced boneless pork chops before browning them in bacon grease and went a little heavier on the bacon!

This was delicious, but a tad labor intensive. My dad, who is from Hungary, always used chunks of pork and browned it that way, instead of using chops and then cutting them into pie es

Excellent recipe, thank you. I use pork loin cubed for stewing and brown that and add directly to the stock pot. Less hassle than chops and it works just as well. Like others I also add some cayenne since I don't have Hungarian paprika and it does need that kick I think. This is now firmly rated as a family favorite...I want to figure out the fluids for slow cooking next.

I halved the recipe because I am only feeding 3.
 I salt & peppered the pork before cooking it in the bacon fat.
I did add mrs dash onion & herb after tasting it. 
Family loved it & I will make it again.

Good and rich. Just cook the onions with the peppers with the bacon, there's really no need to separate like this. (I followed it the first time I made it). Pat the pork dry before searing it to get a good sear on it. I used tomato sauce since my family won't eat cooked chunks of tomato and it worked fine. After dinner, I added just a touch of cayenne pepper to the mix to give a little more zing because we all felt it needed a touch more flavor. Lastly, instead of cooking it on the stove, I sauteed/browned everything in a pan, added it to my Instant Pot, added the liquids, and cooked it for 30 minutes of high pressure. Once the 30 minutes was up, I started the water for the noodles and let the pressure naturally release. When the noodles were done and draining, I let the last of the pressure go, added a roux to thicken the sauce, added sour cream, and served topped with fresh parsley.
Overall good!

Made this just as directed with the exception of reserving the sour cream which was served on the side so everyone could add it to their liking.
Everyone really liked this dish, and the fact that I happened to make this on a cool rainy night made it even better. With some home made bread, this is real comfort food.
I will make this again.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I halved all the ingredients and used country ribs instead of loin. I made it in my insta-pot for 20 minutes, to save me time. I also used a corn starch slurry to thicken it. Served over egg noodles and it was amazing. This was so good I had to come write a review.  Try it, you won’t be sorry!

Good flavor but bland. If you can prep this in 20 minutes, like it says, then you are the flash. It takes more like 2 hours with all the chopping and cooking the bacon and browning the pork. Over all not bad

The flavor wasn't that strong but I think upping the spices would help. I'm not sure the bacon was needed, it got kind of lost with everything else.

Just as good as Grammy’s!  Yes, you can skip the sour cream, but please don’t. It adds a luxurious velvety feel that whispers “Magyar!”  I didn’t have bacon available this time, but I fried the onions in bacon fat (doesn’t everyone save this?) and greased my slow cooker with it too. I used canned plum tomatoes which I squashed with my hands. I think they taste richer than canned diced. Cut chunks of pork loin because I had one in the freezer. Served over homemade nokedli (recipe is on this site). Hungarian heaven.

Since sour cream is added to the stew, this is actually a paprikás, not a Pörkölt. The recipe was good, but not exceptional. First of all, please use fresh garlic, not garlic powder, if possible. I wasn’t a fan of the pork in this recipe and would have much preferred boneless, skinless chicken thighs (I will probably try this next time).

Delicious! Made this with boneless pork ribs (that is only pork I had) and cut the recipe in half (just the 2 of us. ) Followed prep as directed, then put into crock pot for 5 hours on low. It made enough for 2 suppers plus 2 lunches! Served over wide egg noodles with a side cucumber salad.  Next time will use pork shoulder roast and cook a bit longer for more tender meat. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 10 slices of bacon instead of 5, but it still came out perfect! I don't like super spicy stuff, and everyone was saying it would be spicy because of the paprika and bell pepper, but it was perfect. Not to spicy and definitely not bland what so ever. I added this dish to my dinner ideas and everyone loves it!

This was really savoury and great comfort food.  I sautéed and simmered everything in a really deep covered frying pan and added some goulash cream (Hungarian paprika paste) and parsley to the sauce.

I'm keeping this short cuz I've tried to write a post 3 times and it keeps getting deleted before I finish. I love ethnic comfort but this was a waste of ingredients...way too much paprika and I love paprika! I drained and rinsed my meat etc in hopes of saving this dish, but I was so bummed it just was a total turnoff, sorry!

I loved this recipe. I didn't change anything with the ingredients. I would caution anyone who wants to make it without Hungarian paprika not to do so. It won't turn out the way it's supposed to, and you'll end up giving this recipe an unfair review.

This was awful. My family tried one bite and the rest got thrown out. Followed the recipe exactly and found it inedible. Way too expensive to be this disappointed.

This was fine. Followed the other reviewers advise and added mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, but just kind of a bland. It was a nice change up, but was not blown away.

I cut the recipe in half (there's only 2 of us) and used a pork butt roast (cubed) instead of pork chops. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious. I'm definitely making it again.

We loved this! I am a simpler cook so the steps were challenging for me (versus "just throw it all together and stir"), but the final product was tender and delicious.  We are used to spicy food so my husband added a little shake of cayenne to his second bowl and liked that a lot.  This is a keeper in our book.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  Adjusted the rescipe for 6 servings. A few changes:  Did not use bacon.  Used boneless pork loin roast.  Browned pork, removed then cooked onions and garlic (2 cloves).  Added bell pepper (one), and also added 8 oz sliced baby bella mushrooms and a couple carrots.  Cooked a few minutes, added the pork back in with the rest of the ingredients.  Used one large can diced tomato with juice and about 1/2 can beef broth.  Added some cayenne for a bit of heat. Served over rice.

This was a delicious way to help use up some of a huge pork loin we recently bought! I cubed the pork loin for this recipe.  Rather than going through all of the extra steps and and using a pot and a skillet, I cooked everything in my cast iron Dutch oven.... First I cooked the bacon, then cooked the pork cubes in the bacon grease and set aside. Then cooked onions and peppers in the same pot I cooked the meat in, put all the meat back in, added paprika and garlic and other ingredients and simmered for the 90 minutes partially covered.  I used a combination of hot Hungarian paprika and regular because it is what I had. Used 1 and a half red bell peppers because we like them. I did make sure to add some salt and pepper at different stages throughout cooking.  The stew thickened nicely and I thought it was delicious without the sour cream, but added the sour cream anyway (a little less than called for) and was not disappointed!  Served with egg noodles but may try spaetzle next time! Thanks for a great recipe! :)

I had decided I am not as big a fan of paprika as I thought. I used the correct paprika but I still find the flavor not quite what I like. The paprika flavor was overwhelming to me. I liked this well enough and it was a huge hit with the family members, so I will make it again. The next time I make it, I may use 6 Tbsp of Hungarian paprika instead of a quarter cup. Hopefully that will make the difference for me yet still keep enough of the flavor that my family will still enjoy it. 

The only change I made from the posted recipe was to use another reviewer's suggestion of using pork ribs instead of pork chops. I also did not stir in the sour cream at the end but plopped a spoonful (or more) on the individual plates.

So. Good! So. Easy! I loved this recipe. I'll definitely be making this one more often.  The paprika and bacon are just the fininshing touches for a subtle smokey flavour that add to a robust cold weather home style meal.
Just made it again, used tenderloin, bite sized pieces, added bacon once it was just about cooked, browned both together  then followed the instructions as to how to add Ingredients, only thing I did differently was one pot! No draining, no separating. So. Good.

Good solid food. 
I made it with a half pound of thick cut smoked bacon, and added a teaspoon of smoked paprika, then served it over very thick sour cream mashed potatoes. 
No leftovers, the best compliment I can think of.

 This was amazing. it would have been less work on the prep side if I had used canned tomatoes but we had so many ripe from our garden I used fresh tomatoes. I also did all the ingredients except the bell pepper and sour cream the day before and put it in my slow cooker on low for 6 hrs. came home to a delicious fragrance.  I chopped the pepper and threw it in and put my water to boil for the noodles. By the time the noodles were ready the pepper was softened but not mushy. I did add a bit of Cornstarch to thicken as the slow cooker doesn't reduce and I only used 1 cup of sour cream. Again it was fantastic.

Flavorful recipe! I halved it and used fresh tomatoes. I did not like it with the noodles. Had pierogies and buttered bread on the side instead. Much better!

Very good! I only made a half batch because there's just 2 of us, but wish I'd made more.  I added quite a bit more paprika and a few dashes of cayenne because we like the spice, and it was just right.  I didn't use the sour cream while cooking, but added it as a topping on the servings. I think it could be used as an optional ingredient.

Hearty, flavorful and easy to make comfort food.  Not a list of difficult ingredients either.  The directions could use some revision to condense unnecessary steps, though.  Definitely going in the recipe rotation!

We really enjoyed this on a very cold day in May.  Comfort food at its best. I made a few changes.  Since it was just the two of us, I scaled it way down from 14 servings. I used two thick pork steaks and cut away as much fat as I could, one can diced tomatoes, mushrooms,   about a teaspoon of  spicy Turkish paprika for a little zip, and , and sour cream to taste. Served over noodles. I will make this again.  I also cooked this in the oven.

This was super-fabulous! I ended up halving the recipe since I was just cooking for my husband and me, but kinda wish I'd made the entire recipe so we'd have more left over to enjoy! I used half a package of bacon rather than 5 pieces since we're most certainly bacon lovers, cut up a 2.5 lb pork loin into cubes rather than using chops, and used the full bell pepper since we love peppers. Otherwise, we made the recipe as written and loved it...will certainly make this again!

I substituted one of the cans of tomato for an equal amount of hot salsa, added a few cloves of crushed garlic and tried it both with and without the pasta, and with and without the salsa substitution.  Very good either way but was a little bland for my taste without the salsa.  I'll probably make it again.

Made as per instructions, meat was extremely tender but next time I will increase the spices and skip the sour cream

Loved it - added a little paprika paste - used pork belly instead of bacon and then served over dumplings (nokedli) instead of noodles.. Served with cucumber salad 
(Tejfeles uborkasalata). Everyone loved it! Grandma would be proud ??

Yum!!  Very different flavor. I am used to beef stews and this was really good.  I cooked it in a cast iron pot and it came out perfect. Pork was fall apart tender and very moist.  Will have again.

We really liked this dish but I had to tweak the seasoning as it was really bland. I halved the recipe and used pork loin that I cubed. I streamlined the directions a bit to reduce the steps and finished it in the oven at 250 for 2 hours instead of on the stove. I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes for the plain, 2 tbsps smoked paprika, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 bay leaf, 1 pouch Beef Herboxo, 1 tsp Vegetable Better Than Bouillon and snipped dill on the end when I added the sour cream, I only used 1/2 cup and it was fat free. Served over egg noodles, next time will try with mashed potatoes. Very filling and hearty.

Wonderful recipe, didn't change a thing. Wait, I take that back, threw a splash of wine and some salt in there. Husband loved it. Will definitely be making this again.

I grew up eating this quite frequently. My parents are Hungarian. This recipe is pretty standard for Porkolt. I like to use beef instead of pork, I omit the bacon to save on fat, and I use fresh tomatoes and garlic instead of the cans and powder. Make sure to add plenty of salt and pepper. I like to go heavy on the paprika! And make sure to use Hungarian paprika, it makes a BIG difference. Pile it on a big bed of egg noodles with pickles on the side... mmm. My childhood in a bowl!

Of all the hungarian food I have tried, I've loved, but this will be on my bottom list.  It was alright for me.  There was that something missing that I can't figure out.

Delicious!  A different and very tasty flavor.  I like that it's a tomato sauce, but not too tomato-y, and adding sour cream to make the cream sauce is a great idea.  I'm cooking for 2 people, so I halved the recipe, and then only used 1.5lbs of pork and 0.5 onion.  I used the whole pepper and added extra bacon and broth.

Delicious even without Hungarian Paprika.  Used regular paprika, and will keep an eye out for the Hungarian variety next time I'm in a middle eastern market.  That likely will force me to give it 5 stars the next time I make it.
