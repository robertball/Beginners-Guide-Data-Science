I am the submitter of this recipe.  In the instructions AR left out to be sure and rinse the tortellini in cold water and drain.  If the pasta is not cool, it will melt the cheese.

I made this using grilled chicken instead of sausage and it was delicious.  Also used Italian dressing mix that had a small amount of balsamic vinegar mixed in with the white vinegar that the mix call for. Very Yummy!

I used this as my base recipe but was looking for a hot dinner dish so sautéed onions with the yellow pepper first, added the pepperoni & artichokes to the skillet along with:  1 Tbs parsley, 1 Tbs oregano, 2Tbs of the juice from artichoke can, 1 Tbs olive oil and 2 Tbs balsamic vinegar. Therefore, I did not use the Italian dressing called for in original recipe. Tossed with the hot pasta, sprinkled with the shredded Parmesan and served. We absolutely loved it!!

I prepared this salad the night before serving as a side dish, substituting green pepper for the yellow.  For the dressing I used Debby's "Italian Dressing Mix" from this website made up with EVOO and red wine vinegar, rather than the canola oil and white vinegar called for in her recipe.  The salad was great!  Even my Italian-background partner liked it, and he is very fussy about his Italian dishes.  This recipe is a keeper, and I'm sure I'll do some variations from the original recipe, too.

Made this pretty much as written for a potluck at work. Used a little less cheese, a yellow pepper and left out pepperoni. Added a little salt to make up for less cheese and no pepperoni. Looks great and tasted even better. Will definitely make again.

I used tri-color  tortellini for extra color and went sparingly on the dressing.  Guests can always add more dressing if they want.  I like to taste the flavors of the food, not all the dressing.

Also great with Kraft Sundried Tomato and Oregano dressing, mild Spanish Chorizo sausage, and feta cheese.

Great cool summer dish!  I didn't have tortellini so cheese ravioli was substituted.  Thanks for posting.

Very tasty.  I think I would prefer a creamy Caesar dressing, but that is a matter of personal taste.  I thought the Italian was a little tart, but that could also be the brand I used.

I made this salad to go with my Sunday chicken dinner.  I made it the night before to save me some time.  I did need the extra sauce.  I liked it because it wasn't swimming in dressing like some pasta salads.  It was very light.

I've used pasta to make similar salads in the past and while I thought the use of tortellini intriguing, we weren't sure whether we'd like it cold.  Needn't have worried as it was terrific!  I used compari tomatoes that's I cut into 8ths.  They did not fall apart, but I did everything before adding them, then was gentle about incorporating them.  I also made my own dressing, as I often do, using a basil infused EVOO and traditional balsamic vinegar.  Thanks Happyschmoopies for a recipe that is great as is, but can easily adapt to individual taste preferences.

I didn’t give it five stars because I really tweaked the recipe. I added red onion, chopped  carrots, snap peas, and I didn’t add the pepperoni. I wanted to be able to use it as a side dish for multiple  other meats. We are having steak on the grill tonight so I thought this would be a good side.  It is a great basis for a lot of pasta salads.

This tortellini salad is terrific.  I left out the broccoli since my husband hates it but other than that followed the recipe exactly and added cubed provolone.
