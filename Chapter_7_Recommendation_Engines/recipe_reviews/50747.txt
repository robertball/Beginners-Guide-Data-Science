Very good recipe, as good or better than from a restaurant.  I did not have wood ear or shitake and so I just sliced up some regular mushrooms... Also, like a few of the other reviewers, I did not use the bamboo fungus or lilly buds.  I substituted bamboo shoots for the fungus, but found out afterwards that bamboo fungus is actually a type of mushroom that grows on bamboo.  You can find it at an Asian grocery store - it is dried, looks like pasta noodles, and is called "long net stinkhorn".  Also, if you did not already know, to make the soup "crackers" that are served in Chinese restaurant, get some wonton wrappers (I found mine in the frozen section of the Chinese grocery store) - these thaw quickly and are doughy shavings that fry up very quickly.

Loved it. Really! Things I left out: wood ear mushrooms; tiger lily buds, bamboo fungus, tofu, white pepper, dried mushrooms, and chili oil. Things I added: entire package of shitake mushrooms (about 6 oz), a quarter cup of miso, about 6 oz thick Chinese noodles, Sriracha to taste, and some leftover water chestnuts. I think you could do almost anything with this recipe and it would work well... more veggies, add chicken (if you eat meat), etc.

I've made this several times now, and I think i've got it down...my version is NOT vegan as I prefer to add a beaten egg at the end...I always add some bamboo shoots which I cut into strips, and the tofu I use is already cubed...I leave out some of the more exotic ingredients (no tiger lily buds or bamboo fungus) but I include everything else...this is a really yummy, cold weather type soup that I will make again and again

It tastes just like the restaurant version and the lady at the Asian market who assisted me told me this recipe is very traditional.    The bamboo fungus is a MUST in this recipe and so is the white pepper.  It does make all the difference.  The bamboo fungus can be found in the dried mushroom section of the Asian market, because it's really a type of mushroom.  You can find all the ingredients for this recipe at your local Asian Pacific market with assistance from those that work there.  Will become a staple in our home.

This is a really neat recipe, thank you so much!  I changed it a little bit;  I couldn't find bamboo fungus, so I used chopped up bamboo shoots instead.  I have never used rehydrated mushrooms before, so I was really excited about that.  The texture came out just like the restaurant versions.  The flavor is a little bit richer, I think, and less sweet... I don't think most restaurants use the mushroom stock, but I cannot imagine having thrown it away!  Overall a great recipe, thanks again!

Best hot and sour recipe I've found yet!  Might have been my broth, but I found 3 tbs of soy sauce to be 1 too many.  Everything else was perfect.  I think the white pepper is very important, so would not recommend leaving that out.  Add sliced scallions before serving.  Delicious.

This is FANTASTIC. I didn't even have half of the stuff the recipe called for, but I wanted hot & sour soup because I am sick with a stuffy nose. So I used what I had, following this basic recipe, and wow! It's so good! Here's what I used: tofu, tamari instead of soy, rice vinegar (lots of it), veggie broth, water, black pepper, chili flakes, sriracha and the cornstarch. Since I was sick and didn't feel like putting it all in different bowls, i just sort of dumped it all in the pan. It came out sooooo good and cleared my nose right up!

I couldn't find dried mushrooms (of any kind), lily buds, chili oil, or bamboo fungus at our local grocery store.  So I substituted baby bella mushrooms and had to just leave out the rest since I don't even know what they are similar to.  Despite not being able to find a good portion of the ingredients this turned out very well.  My husband (who I was looking at this for) really loved it and wanted me to make it more often.  Next time I make it I will use low sodium soy sauce and if that works I'll try to cut back on it the following time too...the sodium content in this soup (and every hot and sour soup recipe I've looked at so far) is too high for everyday consumption.  I noticed that the non-vegan recipes for this soup include pork...the Chinese restaurants I've been to do not include pork in their hot and sour soup (at least not as far as I can tell).  So I was very glad to find a vegan alternative to the norm that is more like what we are use to.

Delicious! Followed recipe exactly (though it was not easy finding all ingredients and I live in Hong Kong!!!), with one excpetion. Left out white pepper, cuz husband doesn't care for it. I think it would make an excellent soup even better, so will likely sprinkle some in when I eat the leftovers. "Bamboo fungus" was extremely difficult to find because clerks were very confused. Once I showed my colleagues the other reviewers translation ("long net stinkhorn"), they used a tool to translate to Chinese and I brought that to the store, so try that if you have trouble.

Awesome recipe! I love hot and sour soup but have had a hard time finding a recipe that matches the restaurant soup.  I didn't use the specified amount of mushrooms as it seemed excessive, and I adjusted the seasonings at the end to fit my taste.  Very happy with the results.

Loved this soup!  Hot & Sour is one of my favorites.  I couldn't find the various dried mushrooms & fungus listed, so I used dried porcini mushrooms and dried white mushrooms along with half a bag (5  oz) of frozen shitake mushrooms.  The mushroom broth was very tasty.  Will definitely make again.

I tried this after having it at an Asian restaurant.  The base is right on although (personally) I may cut back on the red pepper next time.  My grocery store carried packages of exotic mushroom blend and I used that instead of the dried mushrooms/fungi called for.  I will definitely make this again and would serve to guests.

I have made this several times now and have made some definite adjustments for our tastes/budget.  We do not have an asian store near us nor the budget for the high end mushrooms/fungus/lily buds.  We just do a mix of baby portabello and regular white mushrooms approx. 2 cups sliced + 1 can of rinsed slivered bamboo shoots.  The chili oil is way too hot at 1/2 tablespoon.  4-5 drops is plenty hot.  We also omit the red pepper flakes and reduce the sesame oil to 1 teaspoon.  I add 1 whipped egg to the soup at the end when it is boiling (although I know this changes it from vegan--you can leave it out).  I add 2 Tbsp more cornstarch with 1 cup hot water as we like it thicker.  My husband loves this soup and I make it once a week now.  Thanks for the recipe!

Quick, easy, forgiving recipe that tastes much better than the soup served in restaurants. 
I made this soup 2 days ago and my boyfriend has talked about it several times since. He thought it was a hearty soup loaded with beef and chicken. He was shocked to learn it was a bunch of fungus without any meat lol
This recipe was a huge hit and I will definitely be making this often. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great basic recipe.  I add a tablespoon of hot and sour soup paste for additional punch.  As I like my hot and sour soup thick and heavy on fillers, I added a touch more corn starch and doubled up on all mushrooms, fungus and tofu.

I followed the recipe pretty closely and found that in the end I didn't need to adjust really anything, which surprised me as i am always altering recipes. I shared this  with a group of foodie friends and every single person loved it. I didn't plan ahead so i couldn't get ahold of the bamboo fungus, aka:  long net stinkhorn/veiled lady.  It is a mushroom, so bamboo shoots don't replace it but do make a nice addition regardless.  Here is what i did change:  I substituted a carton of fresh shitake mushrooms for the "1 cup chinese dried mushrooms"; a whole bag of dried shitake rather than the 4, I added only the cornstrach that was called for saturating the tofu (so I used only one tablespoon total) I added a whole bunch of green onions rather than the one lonely onion; i added half a small can of bamboo shoots and some bean sprouts to make it more of a meal.  And finally most importantly I added agave to balance out the hot salty spiciness of the soup, it also made it taste more like resturant style.  I didn't measure it out but I added it slowly at the end and kept tasting it.  Prob a tablespoon.  Everything else in her ingredients i followed closely, but with a heavy hand.  Don't skip the lily buds/ lily flowers.  I bought them dried at an international store.  i cooked them seperately in a pot with prob two cups of water and boiled it down to about a cup.  Add the water they cooked in.  The flavor is kind of crazy.  excellent.

The hardest thing about this was finding the ingredients, but SO well worth the search.  This is a top rate recipe, with excellent results for an authentic taste experience.  If not keeping it vegan, you can use chicken broth and stir in an egg at the end.  I did add sliced bamboo shoots, but that was my only deviation to the recipe.  About $15 in ingredients will make at least 6-8 batches of this lovely soup.  No more take out quarts of hot and sour for me!

Hot and Sour Soup has always been a "as you like it" style soup. I added an extra 1TBL rice vinegar to my recipe and this is a prime vegan recipe!

This was excellent!  I went to an Asian grocery so I had all the items except I used one type of dried mushrooms and white wine vinegar for rice vinegar. I also added bean sprouts and peapods. My daughter had never had hot & sour soup, ate about theee bowls. It was healthy and delicious. And I have enough bamboo fungus to make many more batches.
