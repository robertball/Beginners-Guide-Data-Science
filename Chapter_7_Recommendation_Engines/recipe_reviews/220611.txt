Wow, this was delicious! I left out the crushed red pepper flakes and the spice level was perfect for us. I served this over pasta but there was way too much sauce, so next time I will serve it with french bread for dipping. Thanks Valorie!

If prepared as written I can't imagine giving this recipe a rating higher than three stars. The shrinp would be swimming in butter (pun intended) if you used as much as directed.  Moreover, since the main ingredient in Old Bay is celery salt, I would strongly advise not using the full amount.  I used a little better than half the spice mixture called for and it was terribly salty. I'm glad I sprinkled it on the shrimp rather than adding it to the sauce so that I could get a better idea of just how much seasoning was being used.  This unquestionably was a great blend of herbs and spices (tho' I did omit the red pepper flakes in consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards) and the bacon, of course, made its own, wonderful and unique flavor contribution.  Back off on both the butter and the Old Bay (at least START with less anyway, and see what you think) and this is a solid four star dish.

This was a suggestion for Recipe Group which is how I came across a most flavorful new way to prepare shrimp.  I was only feeding two of us so I played with the quantities a bit, cutting the shrimp, bacon and butter to 1/3 and eyeballing the other ingredients.  I really wasn't sure about the mustard, but I used everything and it is wonderful.  You can taste each layer of flavor but nothing over takes the others.  I cooked the bacon and herbs in a cast iron skillet so instead of transferring it to a baking dish, I just made sure each shrimp was well coated and put the whole thing in the preheated oven.  It smelled so enticing!  I served it over whole wheat farfalle, but next time I think I will serve it over crusty French bread.  The sauce is too good to leave any uneaten.  Thanks Valorie, this is a winner in my book.

Absolutely beautiful. Perfectly seasoned (with unsalted butter) I had a package of real bacon bits I wanted to use up so I quickly crisped them (there was no bacon fat to speak of)and then followed the recipe. I added some simple crab stuffed pepperdews and some whole hearts of palm to the pan. I broiled for the last few minutes and served with lots of warm French bread to soak up the butter sauce. So naughty but so very nice! I'm going to take up jogging just so I can have this once in a while.

It seems like there's way too much butter in this recipe, is it just me?  I used half the butter and stayed true to everything else.  Served it over thin spaghetti, this was delicious!

I submitted this recipe, which I just made again at my uncle's request. I cut the butter to 1/2 cup. (Really doesn't need 3/4, looking back...) Was almost sorry to give Uncle the entire amount, it smelled so good! And thanks to the reviews, also bought him some French bread to go with the shrimp. Time to make some for my husband and myself!

Wow was this good! I made it with large shrimp and only used 1 stick of butter and 1 teaspoon of old bay. Served it with a yummy cheese baguette from the bakery and fresh corn on the cobb. I always make Paula Deen's fiery cajun shrimp but this was even better than that and we love her shrimp. The sauce in this recipe is to die for. Highly recommend this recipe.

Made this with 1/2 cup butter and omitted the wine, but it was really, really good!  We all enjoyed it, even our 6 and 8 year old.  We made it with penne pasta on the side, but realized that if you mix it all together it was so much better...definitely a keeper!!

We also cut down the butter & still loved it. The recipe doesn't mention that you need to have some good bread on hand to sop up the sauce after you've finished the shrimp.

This was fabulous!!! Used less butter as per the other reviews but followed the rest to a tee. Both my husband and I LOVED the shrimp.  He had rice as a side and I had salad, and we both mopped up the sauce with garlic bread.

Very good.  I didn't have any white wine and look forward to adding that next time.  This will probably be a family favorite.

This is amazingly delicious.  You might want to bear a few things in mind, though:  1.  That is way too much butter.  I'd suggest coating the pan w a tablespoon, but only if you use precooked bacon like I did.  I doubt you even need butter if you cook the bacon in the skillet.  2.  Adjust the spice based on taste--there is no need to use 2 tbs of Old Bay and red pepper flakes if you aren't a spicy food lover.  And 3.  If you use an oven safe skillet like I did, you don't need to dirty more dishes.  I have an oven safe skillet just for recipes like this.  I used 1 tbs of Old Bay, 1 tbs margarine, prawns, left out the red pepper flakes, and used Marsala wine since that is what I had open.  This turned out fantastic.  I loved it!  I served over pasta with bread, but as others have said, the sauce is the best part, so you'll want some crusty bread with pasta or rice for this--something that will absorb the awesome flavor of the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this while on vacation in North Carolina, everyone loved it. If you like your food a bit more spicy, you can go heavy on the crushed red pepper.

Made this for supper tonight for my husband and myself.  Halved the recipe, and used about 1/4 cup of unsalted butter. Didn't have any wine or seafood seasoning. Added two pinches of celery salt to the onion mixture whilst cooking.  Also, didn't have any raw shrimp, so used cooked and skipped the baking and just tossed the shrimp in the pan to heat them through after the onions were cooked. I served it with spaghetti (finished the spaghetti in the pan with the shrimp).  Was great!! A new fave.

Very delicious. Only used one stick of butter (1/2 cup). There was plenty of juice after it was all cooked. Matched it with some mashed potatoes and pan seared asparagus. Yum.

Super yummy, soaked up the sauce with bread. Spices seemed a little raw to me, maybe I should have toasted them longer? I used dry vermouth instead of wine also. Yum. Thanks.

Super yummy!  Only used about 3/4 of the butter it called for.  Used all of the Old Bay it called  for.  Doubled the basil, doubled the red pepper flakes.  Super yummy!  Soaked it up with bread, as suggested.

I've made this many times - one of our family faves!  I make it spicier when it's just my husband and me, and I've served it over pasta, rice, and even over a bed of spinach.  It's even good alone!

Everyone I have served loves this dish! I use extra large shrimp and peel.  I use a cast iron skillet for bacon and other ingredients. One stick of butter is plenty, then add shrimp. Pop all in the oven and bake the shrimp only for 10-12 minutes since the pan is heated from the stovetop.  I usually serve with toasted crusty bread right out of the skillet. I don't even think I need to wash the pan!  All of my guests scoop up every last bit of the sauce. I have used many different blends of chili powder from New Mexico, Ancho, and others.  All have been delicious!
