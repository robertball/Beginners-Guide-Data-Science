Very yummy and moist french toast - We didn't even need any butter! I had cinnamon applesauce, so we used that, and I substituted pumpkin pie spice for plain ground cinnamon, which was very tasty.  I must agree that this recipe makes more than six slices of french toast - I think I made 10 slices before running out of liquid, so plan accordingly.  Also, be aware that the high sugar content of the batter makes it susceptible to burning, so keep a very close eye on the cooking toast; I found that medium heat worked best for me.  Enjoy!

Very quick and easy to prepare.  The taste was nice, but the bread was too soggy so next time I would cook it longer and use less cinnamon (about 1/2 what the recipe calls for).

This was pretty good! I read over some suggestions & reduced the milk to 1/2 cup & that worked nicely. I used lite cinnamon applesauce & had no problem with the bread being soggy. Next time I'm going to increase the cinnamon as the taste wasn't as strong as I prefer. I also used Splenda & whole wheat bread. Overall, a great recipe & thank you!

My family loved this recipe.  I would never make french toast the old fashion way again.  My 2 year hardly took a breath between bites!  I used cinnamon applesauce because I had no cinnamon and used 1/2 a cup of milk.  I had no mixture left.  They were a LITTLE "soggy", but not enough to make a difference.  This recipe is a great way to get your kids to eat whole wheat bread too.  I also sprinkled some allspice on top.  I would recommend this recipe.

wow, this french toast is just fantastic! i followed the recipe as written, using natural applesauce & thick cut, day old challah bread. i like to fry mine until well browned then put it on a rack in a 250 degree oven for 5 - 10 minutes. that helps to firm it up a bit. we served this with maple syrup & sauteed apples. what a treat! thank you joan, i wish i'd found this recipe earlier. you should've put it under the brunch category instead of in the bread category. thanks again!

Mine were also very soggy and not very good. I was so hungry that i did eat one of the 2 pieces though. I also used the apple sauce for my syrup.

made this for dinner with some quick-browned sausage patties, and it was perfect -- not soggy, and just the right amount of dipping mixture. the only thing i changed is that i added a bit of nutmeg to the egg mixture. wonderful!

Found this to be quite delicious! 

I used soy milk and fresh multigrain bread. 

My one piece of advice - the more soft/fresh the bread is - the less you want to soak the bread!

My first slice broke in half because it was too weighed down by the heavy mixture - VERY moist. 

But I salvaged it in the pan, and it came out great. 

Served with warmed maple syrup :)

MMMmmm. This is one good recipe! I usually wake up before the rest of my family, and they are all cap'n crunch and cocoa pebbles people anyway, so I often scale brunch and breakfast recipes on this site down to serve one and make them for myself. This french tost is some of the best that I have tried. Nice and moist, and the applesauce gives it a subtle flavor. Will make again, defenetly.

This is soooo good and easy to make. The first time I made french toast as a child, i ended up with fried toast with eggs on it. Because this recipe does not use alot of eggs, that wont be a problem on this one.  Yes, the french toast is very soft, I reduced my milk a little, as suggested by other reviewers.. I also used cinnamon bread (and reduced the cinnamon) and chunky applesauce.. because most of the applesauce was left in the bowl (the chunks) the french toast came out not too sweet... and I fried it in butter...

This was great!  My three year old loved it - I had to stop her after 3 1/2 pieces!  Of course, the fact that I made it with Panera's raisin cinnamon bread could have helped as well...  I also used Silk soy milk instead of regular milk, and used strawberry flavored applesauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Well I did what people suggested, reducing the milk, adding more cinnamon, and reducing the applesauce and it came out .... nice but not great.  It was still a little soggy so next time I try Ill reduce the milk to 1/4 of its original size and I cant really taste any apple so Ill keep the same amount of applesauce in.  Ill have fun experimenting with this one.

This recipe doesn't taste much different than regular French toast but it is a lot moister.  Next time, I think I will try it with apple butter instead of syrup.  The batter was easier to use and a lot less "eggy" than the traditional batter.  Since other reviews complained about sogginess, I reduced the milk to 1/4 cup.  It was the perfect consistency for me.

I found this recipe to be really soggy. We had to end up using a lot more bread than the amount listed. Overall, I don't think we'll use this recipe again.

I've never made French toast, much less Applesauce FT, but now I'm a hero with the kids, I did miss one of the ingredients (the milk) which made a difference.  It will be less mushy if you use less or no milk, otherwise an excellent recipe!

My very picky seven yr old daughter LOVED this new twist to French Toast and I loved it even more. Can't taste the applesause but the results are amazing. The edges are crispy with a fluffy center, just let it sit in the pan on low with a lid to prevent soggyness.

I thought this was a great, EASY recipe for French Toast. The applesauce makes it moist with just a hint of its flavor (I also use applesauce in my cake recipes because it makes them moist without having to use a lot of oils).

My kids loved this recipe.  I am going to try adding more applesauce the next time though.  I had to triple the recipe to feed my family and I didn't think there was enough apples, however my kids begged for more.

I made half a batch for my husband and I, I think it would have coated 5 slices of bread but we only needed 4.  I used the extra applesauce as a topping along with a little bit of syrup, I really liked that.

We really liked this french toast, but it didn't really taste any different than the french toast that we usually have without the applesauce.  I used Texas Toast to make this and doubled the recipe because I was feeding 5 hungry people.  It was enough batter to cover 14 pieces of bread that were all gobbled down.

I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I added only 1/2 cup of milk, 2 tsps. cinnamon and I only dunked the bread.  I made with whole wheat bread and this was so yummy!

I made a double recipe of this. I can't say that the applesauce really added anything to this recipe. I used my homemade sauce which was a little thicker than normal but that really didn't matter. It was good but like I said, it didn't really make that much of a difference. If I do this again, I might add double the applesauce called for in the egg dip OR I'll just serve the sauce over the top. NOTE: My applesauce had apple pie spice and brown sugar already in it, so I skipped the added sugar and spice.

Very good, quick and easy.  After reading reviews, I used only 1/2 C milk and extra cinnamon.  I had enough to cover 8 slices of bread.

This was really good.  Did experience the problem of soggy bread, but next time I think I'll use a french stick cut diagonally, and that should hold together better.  Also didn't have any apple sauce so used apple syrup to get the flavour and it gave just a nice little hint.  Might use a little more next time to get more of a flavour.

These were really very good.  I used less milk, as others had suggested and more cinnamon for added flavor.  I also chose to use slices of homemade bread and dunked them instead of soaking them in the mixture.  Had a great meal - and let me suggest using the Sauteed Apples recipe from this site as a nice topper to your french toast!

This french toast was very tasty however it was a little to mushy for my taste.  My little one didn't like the texture, so she wouldn't eat it either.

We loved this version of french toast! It turned out very well for us! I used 1/3 cup evaporated milk (only because I had some leftover in the fridge that I wanted to use up).  We really liked everything about about these! Unlike other complaints, they weren't soggy at all. Would make this again.

I'm not a huge french toast fan, but this applesauce makes it good enough to eat.  Another reviewer had said they used pumpkin pie spice, which I used in addition to the cinnamon (I also added vanilla).  I didn't measure, but just estimated, but overall, a great change up!  Although its not amazing, this is the recipe I'll probably make from now on.

Quick, Easy and YUMMY!!!  I reduced milk to 1/2 cup other than that, didn't change a thing!!  Was a tiny bit soggy so next time I think I'll buy whole wheat bread and try it.  Up the nutrition too!!

I liked this recipe a lot more than I thought I would. The flavor is really good and made french toast interesting again. I used only 1/2 cup of milk though and might use a little less next time. I also used whole grain white bread. Will be making this again real soon.

Made this for my son last week.  He wasn't feeling well and wanted French Toast for lunch.  I found this and decided to try it.  It turned out pretty good.  I tried to dip it really quick but it still ended up a bit soggy in the middle.  He loved it and there was enough to put in the fridge for the next morning.  After it was reheated the sogginess went away.  It was just as good.  Thanks for the nice change.

The recipe was very moist and I had to be careful transferring the bread from the dish it was soaking in to the pan.  I may add extra eggs or decrease the amount of milk next time.  The applesauce added a nice flavor. Very sweet. My family enjoyed it but thought they preferred their "normal" french toast.

Very, Very good recipe.  We made it with Panera Bread Co. raisin bread and it was soooo good.  Light apple sauce taste, not overpowering.  Will definitely try again.

This was an okay recipe.  The french toast ended up being too soggy and too mushy.  Not your traditional french toast.   ADVICE: Use 1/2 cup of milk to get better results

I used a little more applesauce (1/3 c.) and a little less milk (2/3) and 1 T. brown sugar instead of the white.  Used slipper cibotta bread cut thick (1"). It made 8 pieces.  Everything else was the same.  I cooked it on an electric griddle at 350.  Served it with applesauce on the side and warm maple syrup.  Powdered sugar and a fruit syrup would be really good with this, too.

There are defiantly better ways to make french toast. The recipe was too bland for me. It is a creative idea though, & b/c I do not like to waste food I did finish it, but I do not think I will be making this again. Thank-you for the recipe.

So easy!  Big and little loved it!  I used fresh wheat bread and broiled under the broiler for above 5 minutes to make it hard.

I served this to guests for a fun "breakfast for dinner" with sausages and scrambled eggs!  Everyone loved it!  I added an extra egg because I like my french toast "eggy", plus a dash of nutmeg, and after browning I put on a rack in the oven at 250 degrees for a few minutes.  Very moist and flavorful!

I was skeptical at first-applesauce in my french toast? But my, oh my! This is FANTASTIC! The most flavorful french toast I have made. We'll keep this one!

Simply delicious!  I didn't add the sugar though, because I thought there was plenty between the applesauce and maple syrup.

very easy to make. any tips that i may have is to mix up the egg batter before you dip your bread in.  that way the applesauce will not sit at the bottom of bowl.

Pretty good! I made it with whole wheat english muffins, which was probably why I couldn't taste the spices as much. I added nutmeg as well.

I used leftover store-bought cinnamon-raisin bread.  The flavour was good, but the bread stayed rather soggy - I almost burnt a piece trying to crisp it up a bit. Perhaps I will trying soaking the bread less as others suggested.

This was a great recipe!  I followed the suggestions by other people and cut back the milk to only 12 cup so that my bread wasn't too soppy.  I also added extra cinnamon and used natural (unsweetened) apple sauce.  The sweetness was perfect when I did it this way.  Thanks for sharing!

Took the advice of many others - don't soak, just dip the bread (to avoid sogginess). Used a little less milk and used cinnamon applesauce. OMG - my boyfriend and I loved these this past Sat. morning! These will go into my regular french toast rotation!

Ordinary french toast, but it is nice and moist.  Just don't let the bread sit too long - and you must use good bread, not just "Wonder Bread".

I liked this, but it didn't taste much different than regular French toast. It was maybe a little more moist, but not much. I would maybe cut back on the milk a little bit, as I had batter left over, but not enough to cover another piece of bread. I ate this with syrup, so I left out the sugar. I liked the idea and will probably try it again--I'm thinking maybe a flavored applesauce would be better.

Yummy! This recipe was delicious! I used raisin bread for this recipe and my family loved it! No need to use the sugar if flavored bread is used. Thanks for a great recipe! See my photo that I uploaded.

Was definately too thick. I changed it up a little to be more organic and healthy for my kiddo.
1 cup buckwheat pancake mix
1/3 cup oats 
1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce
I used honey instead of vanilla
added Rice milk to a more common pancake consistency.

using a 1/3 cup measure it made 8 pancakes.
