This recipe is awesome!  Being a cake decorator by trade, the ease and denseness of the cake is ideal for weddings.  So many ask for the recipe... but I keep it a secret!  Too good to let go!  Besides, would you want to admit you cheated?  :-)

I used to make poundcakes in mini loaf pans for everyone at Christmas.  Each pound cake recipe made three small cakes.  This year I was looking for a way to cut down on the cost, and tried this recipe.  I added 1/8 tsp. of mace, which really adds to the pound cake flavor.  The cakes are absolutely delicious.  Also, the recipe makes four small cakes instead of three.  This is great!

Excellent flavor and texture! I've been trying out several recipes for wedding cakes and so far this is one of my favorites. Very moist!

Good texture. Other than that, just a glorified yellow cake mix cake.

Sorry, but this cake did not go over big in my house. In all fairness the cake came out good but it's just not the typical pound cake that we like. It was too spongy, where we like a more dense type pound cake.

Very moist and delicious cake.  I added 1 T. poppy seeds and I used 1 tsp of almond extract in place of the butter extract and baked them in small coffee cans for Christmas gifts.  If you use coffee cans, they need to be clean and then greased with shortening and flour.  Only fill them 1/2 full and bake for about 45 min.  It makes 3 small coffee cans per recipe....also, cool completely in coffee cans before removing. Wrap in saran wrap and then colored tissue paper, gather at the top, and then use curling ribbon to tie off. Very nice gift for any occasion.

I needed a recipe to bake a sheet cake for a birthday party.  I baked this cake and baked another cake from scratch.  I conducted a "taste test" with co-workers and this cake got every vote!  It is so light and has a wonderful flavor!

Absolutely fantastic!  My coworkers love it; it also makes a terrific base for coffee cake, or substitute rum for the water, and you have a rum cake worthy of RAVES!  (My coworkers couldn't get enough of this!)

I used this to make a layer cake that I covered with buttercream & then fondant.  It was a nice dense base for the fondant and tasted so delicious.  I used a chocolate cake mix and french vanilla pudding-just what I had in my pantry.  Omitted the butter flavor & used 2 tsp. vanilla instead.  Everyone raved about the cake. EDIT: Also made 3 different flavors of cupcakes: vanilla, lemon & chocolate.  Use ice cream scoop to place in liners as it is very thick.  So good with Best Buttercream Frosting (from allrecipes, of course):)

This in no way resembles a pound cake, but then I didn't really expect it would.  It is more fluffy than dense - not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not pound cake.  I used Bailey's Irish Cream for the water and a French Vanilla cake mix because I so wanted to drown out that obvious cake mix taste.  I eliminated the butter extract.  This passed in terms of making some quick and easy cupcakes but still, it is just a doctored up cake mix cake - average, not excellent.

Great recipe!  Very similar to my basic vanilla cake recipe that I use for my customers.  I used Lemon cake mix and substituted lemon extract for the other two.

Great and easy recipe!  I am also a cake decorator by trade, as another reviewer, and this is one of those multi-purpose recipes you can use for many different types of cakes.  It works great for any layered cake and especially for wedding cakes as it is dense enough to hold up in tiers but still has a nice crumb to it.  I made cupcakes with it tonight.  Be aware that this recipe will not give you cupcakes with a nice, rounded dome on top.  Because of the pudding in the mix the cupcake is going to have a 'flat top' or maybe a slight dome.  So if you're wanting one that rises super high and is very light and fluffy, stick with just the basic box mix recipe, or go with something like a White Almond Sour Cream Cake (mixes a cake mix and extra sugar and flour along with a cup of sour cream).  But if you need a cuppie with a flatter top for decorating purposes (Edible Images, etc.), then this recipe is perfect.  You can mix and match so many flavors of cake mix, pudding mix, and flavoring.  I like using white cake with white chocolate pudding mix and almond and vanilla flavoring for wedding cakes.

This is delicious! I used French Vanilla cake mix (cuz that's what i had on hand) and almond extract instead of butter (again, cuz that's what i had on hand). Also, I took vanilla icing and added some almond extract and allspice to make an icing on top. It's sweet but very good, especially warm! yum Next time I will make sure to have the right ingredients and try it that way. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I used this as a base and tweaked it to our family's personal tastes:) I used the yellow cake mix, but substituted butter for the oil, orange juice for the water, and pistachio flavored pudding mix. I think its also a must to use room temperature eggs--it gives it more of the pound cake texture. Its good plain or drizzled with a simple icing of powdered sugar, a pinch of cinnamon and water or milk!

This cake is so moist and absolutely delicious!!!  I used Duncan Hines classic yellow mix and french vanilla pudding and I'm telling you, this is my new favorite cake!  I didn't even frost it-just sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top and we all loved it.  As others have said, this doesn't have the dense consistency I expect from a "true" pound cake.  But it could not be easier, and the cake-mixy flavor is disguised very well, in my opinion.  Try this recipe the next time you want a yellow cake-you won't be disappointed!  I will make again and again--thanks so much for this recipe!

Cake had a good taste (very dense and moist) and had a great consistency for decorating.  As it cooled, the tops flattened a little making the layers sit very evenly - I made a double layer round cake.  My only complaint is that the edges were quite crispy and tough.  I used high quality baking pans and was careful not to overbake the layers.  Maybe the temperature was a little too high?  Next time I'll try baking at a lower temp.  There will be a next time!

I love this recipe! I have used it for wedding and baby shower cakes with sweet success. Any cake mix flavor works. It turns out very moist and heavy, great to decorate with. I highly recommend this to anyone!

Oh my goodness this is a good cake!  I couldn't find a yellow cake mix (I live in Canada - maybe it's an American thing?) so I used a French Vanilla one and used vanilla pudding mix.  I served it with strawberries and whipped cream and it was excellent.  IMO it's much better than the traditional pound cake!

This cake is fantastic!  If you are looking for a traditional heavy pound cake this might not be the recipe for you.  However, this cake does have a substantial texture to hold up to the liquid from fruit toppings without getting soggy.  I made mine in a Bundt pan (40 minutes bake time) and served it with strawberries.  I plan to try it this weekend in a petit fours recipe from Family Fun magazine.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

This is the best pound cake!  lt rises beautifully, and is as moist as can be.  Be careful, I made it twice, and it was done in 35 minutes.  I suggest setting your timer for 35 minutes.  I also suggest Cream Cheese Frosting II on the cake, it is a fabulous topping.

Good cake, but NOT a pound cake!  It was easy and a good alternative for recipes with fruit and whipped cream over cake (shortcake type recipes), but lacks the true pound cake texture.  I probably won't make this again.  Sorry.

This pound cake looks and tastes great! I added about 1/3 cup ground almonds and 2 tablespoons of fresh squeezed orange juice, and omitted the butter flavoring. It was delicious. I cooked mine in three mini loaf pans.

Delicious and moist!  I could not stop eating samples!  I used Golden Yellow Butter cake mix and used 2 tbsp. of real melted butter instead of the extract.  Also used Banana Cream pudding (because it's the only package I had).  Baked in a a bundt pan for about 40 minutes in a convection oven at 350 degree.  Not too much banana flavor and again, delicious!

I can't make this too often because when I do, I can't stop eating it! Normally, I find pound cake too dry, but this is so wonderful and moist!

Left out the butter extract and instead just melted two tablespoons of butter and added it. My mixture was very thick so I increased the water by 1/4 cup. This is a no-fail recipe and very easy to prepare.....Even easier to eat!

This cake is delicious. I followed another user's example by adding 1 T. poppy seeds and using 1 tsp of almond extract instead of the butter extract. I love this recipe. It has good flavor, despite the fact that you can still tell it's made from a box. It's so easy, too! Thank you for sharing, Tina!

it was not a very "heavy" cake as i would expect from a pound cake, but it tasted good, although you could definitely tell it came from a mix. if you like processed "sara lee" type cakes, you'll like this recipe. the texture and taste improved the day after it was baked. it became more dense and pound cake like. though it was not what i was expecting, i will be making this recipe again.

Very good cake but not the same density as real pound cake.  I will make this one again but continue my search for a good pound cake recipe.

I needed a pound cake for a strawberry trifle that I was making.  After viewing many, many on this site I decided on this one.  So glad I did!  It was excellent - moist but firm and people were going back for seconds of the trifle.  Thank you.

Incredible recipe!  I used white cake mix and white chocolate instant pudding and 3 tablespoons melted butter.  Perfect for a firm cake to decorate. Trust me!  Use this recipe!!

The taste is very good, but the appearance was slightly laking. It sank in the middle. This recipe works well with any flavor cake mix. I like to you it as the base for my Luau Cake. Delicious!!!!

I made this for a birthday cake.  Every loved it and couldnt beleive it was a box cake mix.  I did two layers, the first layer i did a yellow cake mix with vanilla pudding and the top layer i made it with chocolate cake mix and chocolate instant pudding.  Both layers really held the fondant on nicely and was not crumbly at all....it cut very nicely.  I was also able to make the cakes 4 days earlier and just froze them...they unthawed quickly.  thanks for the recipe!

Tina...thank you.  I made this over the Thanksgiving Holiday and it was a big success.  Everyone who tasted it thought it was made from scratch. I took some liberties and addeed some other flavorings to it.  I'm making it today for my husban and again for a bridal shower at work.  Thanks it is a recipe I will use over and over again.  

P.S. This is the best Pound Cake I've ever made.

good tasting cake, just sweet enough so that no icing is needed. Only one draw back, husband took a bite and could tell it was a box mix, but that did not stop him from eating it. :) A good cake to have on hand for passing around. Thank you for the recipe.

This cake is perfect!  I have made it twice, once with French Vanilla cake and pudding and it was good with a fondant on top but the fondant made it way too sweet.  It was better with White Cake and Vanilla pudding and replacing the butter extract with almond extract....tasted alot like an almond poppy seed muffin without the poppy seeds.  I tripled the recipe and baked it in a half sheet cake pan...it is perfectly level and moist and dense and wonderful...used whipped cream frosting and BAM!  Everyone loved it...freezes well and stays very nice in the fridge for several days.

This cake had good flavor and a nice texture.  Baked it in a 9x13 pan and it really pulled away from the sides, so presentation was not great. Wonderful with chocolate frosting.

When prepared as written...not *quite* dense enough to be a pound cake that would be suitable for heavy-duty carving and such, but great to stack as a wedding cake. Be sure to refrigerate overnight before decorating!

I used a butter cake mix and did not use the butter extract. This comes out much heavier than a regular cake and has good flavor but not really a pound cake.

I have made this a few times it's a hit in my house and doesn't last more than a day !!! I made it with white cake mix and split the batter into two pans one with chocolate chips inside and the other with fruit both were delicious ... Easy to play around with the flavors... All in all easy,yummy, and the family loves it infact the hubby said it's the best cake I ever made and that's a huge compliment as he usually does not like my cake thanks for the recipe its enjoyed by our family :-)

I've been looking for a poundcake recipe made from a modified cake mix...this is it.  Easy to make. Pulling this out of the freezer and cutting the cake to my shape made me feel so 'professional'.  Filling used was fresh sliced strawberries and 1/2 can of lemon meringue pie filling.  Used a buttercream frosting.  Hit of the party.  Looked good and tasted great.

I changed up the recipe a bit and it turned out fabulous.  I used butter cake mix, instead of the yellow.  I then only added 2/3 oil & 2/3 water.  I did add 1 stick of real butter.  The cake turned out like a cross between cake and pound cake.  I served it as a base to my version of strawberry shortcake.  I used all sorts of different frozen fruits, mixed together in a bowl w/Splenda most of the day.  It made it's own "syrup" which of course the cake soaked right up.  The dessert was great.  We had people over for dinner and everyone loved it.  I will make this recipe again whether I'm in a pinch or not.  It was good.

My second review--my sister asked for me to make her wedding cake with this recipe.  She's been raving about it to all her friends!  I like to use Cheesecake-flavored pudding mix for any flavor of cake mix.  It doesn't give it much cheesecake flavor, but makes the cake mix flavor much richer.

I made this cake for my dad's birthday and it was so moist and delicious. I didn't use the 9 x 13 pan though, I used two 9 inch circle pans and baked them at 350 for about 35 minutes. I sliced the cakes horizontally and made it into a strawberry shortcake layer cake  with vanilla pudding, cool whip, and sweetened strawberries. It was delicious.

I made this cake for my parents' 30th anniversary party.  Everyone loved it!  It was truly scrumptious.  The yellow cake mix with french vanilla pudding was the best, but the chocolate mix with chocolate pudding was good also.

I made this cake for a block party with lemon cake mix and lemon pudding mix--doubled in a 16 x 4 loaf pan. I drizzled lemon icing over it. It was delicious and a big hit!

This cake was unbelievable.  My mom went out and asked me to make a pound cake.  After she left I realized we had no flour and no butter!! It was to late to go to the store so I came on line and found this recipe.  The next day at my grandmothers party everyone was so impressed by my pound cake!!  It was way to easy for all the praise I got!!

Lighter than a pound cake.  Great with or without frosting.  I like to use a pudding frosting, but this cake was Great without it.

I have been looking for this recipe for such a long time.  My mother use to make this exact recipe, but I was never sure how she did it.  I have one of her poundcake tins, and I wanted this recipe to make use of it once again.!  I love the denseness, yet spongyness of the cake.  It is wonderful warm, or cold.  I used lemon extract and vanilla extract (what I had around).  My mother used these extracts as well.  They give it a fresh, clean, and bright taste.  I used butter to grease the pans.  I light crust forms which keeps the cake moist for days...  so thank you for this recipe.  Something I will use, over, and over again !  So easy to make too !!

This is a GREAT alternative to the heavy pound cakes. Of course it is not going to be as dense as a traditional pound cake becasue you are not putting in as many eggs and butter, but it has great flavor and texture. I used a lemon cake mix and melted butter instead of oil, removed the butter flavoring and used lemon extract. It was baked in a bunt pan and I poked holes in it after it was cooled and placed a lemon glaze on the top. I have already been asked to make another one within the next 2 weeks for a birthday.
I have been requested to make this cake for 3 years in a row now every October.

This is addicting once it's finished.  Can't keep it around!  I've made it with both the yellow cake recipe and also w/chocolate for a twist.  Both great.

Did not care for this at all. Wish I'd paid more attention to the negative reviews, but I was almost out of eggs, and this one only needed 4, so I figured I'd give it a shot. 
It was really greasy (not buttery or moist), not very flavorful (in spite of adding extra vanilla and butter extract after tasting the batter), and the texture wasn't very good. It was not moist, dense, or tender as a pound cake should be.
Would have given it just one star, but it didn't taste BAD, just not great.

I have made this several times.  The first time being the best ever.  The 2nd and 3rd time I made this the cakes are spongy.  Any suggestions what I am doing wrong.  If I can get it right again it was a very dense and great tasting cake.

Needed to make a trifle.  This recipe is quick, easy, can be made mostly with ingredients I keep in stock, and offered a delicious inexpensive alternative to the expensive store-bought, frozen pound cake.

Flavorful cake, great texture. Substiteded 2 tsp. vanilla for the butter flavoring. Cake looked beautiful when it came out of the oven, The cake fell a bit & then I baked another cake & placed it on top of the 1st cake. I iced it w/ the Magnolia's recipe for vanilla buttercream frosting,

I made this for my niece's three tier wedding cake.  Sliced each layer in half, filled with strawberry preserves, crumb coated it with buttercream, chilled, and covered with fondant.  It was my first attempt using fondant and the cake was so beautiful my niece cried.  The flavor was awesome and everyone loved it.

So disappointed. Great taste but I made 4 cakes, different sizes, convection and regular bake and there is no way these were suitable for wedding cakes. Cracked tops, fallen middle, raw looking insides. Went back to a tried and true and wish I hadn't wasted my time with this recipe.

Well, I did not have any butter flavored extract, but I had a brandy flavored one I used instead. Also, I followed another reviewer's advice by adding a liquor instead of water, and what I had was a caramel one. I also made a sauce to drizzle on top after it baked. It was 1/2 c. of butter, 1 c. sugar boiled together, then I added 1/4 tsp. of the brandy flavored extract to 3/4 c. of the carmel liquor and dumped that in to simmer for about 5 minutes or so. (Got that idea, of poking the cake, pouring on the sauce and returning the cake to its pan for 20 minutes before inverting it again, from another recipe on here.) It reminds of a pound cake, but sort of like a glazed maple donut you get from the bakery. My husband said it reminds him of butterscotch candy this way. I will definitely be experimenting with this wonderful base recipe for yellow cake mix. It came out wonderfully moist and seems easy to transport with that glaze, too. Thank you for posting this, Tina.

Hmmm.... the cake got such good reviews, it confuses me that the one I made with this recipe didn't taste very good. It was easy to make, baked really well, looks really good, but tastes like eggs and oil.
