We loved this.  It's a very mild side dish that isn't going to interfere with any other part of your meal, but it's almost creamy and just loaded with flavor.  Thanks lyss8 for a special new side dish that presents itself very well.

I'm vegan so I substituted cashew cream and I added dried cranberries. Very yum!

I made this for Christmas dinner, but wished I had made our weeknight staple of Simple Roasted Butternut Squash instead.  Less is more with butternut squash. This got tossed out.

I was looking for a different recipe for squash and used this one.  It was very good but I think it needs a little something for more flavor. I think the next time I make it I will try adding some nutmeg

This is my new go-to! My husband requested that I make this at least once a week, and he isn't one for recipe redos! I actually forgot to add the sage the first time I made this, and it still turned out really well.

Good recipe. I added a little more butter for more flavor. however, the butternut squash makes this dish moist enough. Well received by my guests.
