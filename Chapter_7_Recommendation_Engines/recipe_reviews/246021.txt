Classic puttanesca, just gluten free. No need to change a thing. If you're not a fan of anchovies, please don't leave them out. The dish doesn't taste like fish at all, it simply gives an Italian umami flavor that is irreplaceable. You won't be sorry!

Bit too salty for me, with both anchovy and olives.
