This was such a hit with my boyfriend, we both enjoyed it so much! I just thickened some milk instead of using that Philadelphia business though.

This was awful. I love all the ingredients but it didn't work out together for me! The addition of the Cooking Creme is what didn't work. I followed the directions to a T.

I made this with my boyfriend and he wouldn't touch it. I tried it and i pretty much had to put the whole thing of Cooking Cream in it, it was so bland. I did have to alter the ingredients a little. I put zucchini, mushrooms and red peppers in it. I also put a little salt and pepper, but apparently not enough. If I ever make something like this again, I would probably choose a completely different recipe.

Ok so most recipes are made to adapt to your own taste. I read this recipe and found it a good starting point. I’m rating it on that merit.  The changes I made were I added mild Italian sausage browned,  8oz of cream cheese.  Kept the cheese blend which was really good, the onion.  Of course here in New Mexico we add green chili to everything, so added 3/4 cup diced fresh roasted green chili,  mmmm,mmmm. And changed the pasta to orichi, since I didn’t have rigatoni.
Husband loved it,  leftovers even better

I modified the original and it was good, kids enjoyed it. I added kielbasa and a diced red pepper; omitted the crushed red pepper and croutons; seasoned onion and squash with salt and pepper.

I loved this dish a lot. Next time I make it I am going to add more butternut squash because it is so yummy.

It was pretty good. I have never eaten butternut squash and I found this pasta dish to be a little too sweet. If I make it again I think I will spice it up with some chilies or spices and also add some ham.

I added fresh mushrooms to the zucchini 10 minutes before zucchini was tender.  I also added chopped chicken (pre-cooked) when I added the cheese.   The family absolutely loved this dish and asked me to save the recipe.  I also used regular cream cheese instead of cooking creme.

I used this recipe as a starting place. The squash and the cream cheese made a good "sauce" after I roasted the squash and then heated it up all mushy with the cream cheese. I added a fried onion to that too, and some garlic powder -- just a touch. When I rolled all of this sauce over the noodles, I thought something else was needed, so I added about 1/2 cup of jarred tomato sauce, then sprinkled some cheese and some bread crumbs over the whole thing. It was a good meal. Got some veggies into my kids! I'll do something like this again, and appreciate the starting place.

This was very, very easy and my family loved it.  I think the original recipe was tweaked and improved because some of the negative comments reference "cooking creme," which does not figure in this recipe as it currently displays.  It's a meatless main dish, so you can add tofu or cooked chicken or pork if you like, or else you can serve it as a nice side dish.  I particularly liked the way the onion carmelized in the oven!  Thanks!

Family enjoyed it.  Was unable to find Kraft cheese with the philadelphia in it.  Also couldn't find Orig Cooking Creme so I used the garlic flavor.  Made it just as written otherwise and will had more cooking creme & cheese to next time.  Need it creamier for my tastes.
