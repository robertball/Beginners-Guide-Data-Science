Yum!!! I prefer the squash roasted. Split the squash in half, salt & pepper and put 1 TB butter in before roasting 1 1/2 hours. Pour the juices out into soup pot before cutting so you don't lose the liquid. It was great as it was, but the heat was minimal. I will make again with more jalapeno so I can try it with sour cream. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Totally vegetarian. Increased the coconut milk to 1 cup and added 1 cup of vegetable broth and sauteed the the onion in olive oil.   Very good soup.

I roasted the squash first.  Since I didn't have any jalapeno pepper, added Tumeric and a little paprika.   Gorgeous and very tasty!

Really good.  I used fat free evap milk and lite coconut milk and it was still plenty rich.  I didn't bother with the sour cream.  I'll keep this recipe as my go-to butternut squash soup recipe.  Yum

Yummy. This had a Thai flare to it and was oh so good. You have to like ginger as the ginger and Thyme are strong. I love using coconut milk and that added to the flavor. I skipped the garnish and served with whole grain crackers. I will make this again and again

I loved this soup! I needed more chicken broth to boil the squash in it. Maybe I had a larger squash? We like our food on the spicy side, so I added more jalapenos and some cayenne pepper. Very rich and creamy tasting. Didn't need the sour cream... but spinkled some croutons on top for some added texture. Will make again.

Very good!  Like some of the other reviewers I roasted the squash before adding it to the soup base.  I also used evaporated goat milk as this was for a friend of mine who is lactose intolerant.  I think the one jalapeno was just right; there is just a small amount of heat with each bite and we were serving this to kids.  If I were to make this again for adults only I would probably add another jalapeno.

This was pretty good. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I replaced it with 1/2 cup of coconut milk. I also added 2 jalapenos for extra heat!

This was outstanding! I did cut the squash in half and roast it at 375 degrees for 1 1/4 hour until soft. Used 1/2 c. skim milk and FF evaporated milk. Only had jarred jalapeno pepper sliced and should have seeded those. My husband said it had the right amount of heat, but it put me into a sweat, so will seed the next time. Forgot the thyme, but will add next time. This is a soup that will warm you to your toes in the winter! Served with crusty bread, but croutons on top would be even better and then serve a green salad. Goes to my favorite file.

I roasted the squash with two jalapeños, a shallot, a few carrots, and thyme. I sautéed crushed garlic with the onion and two additional jalapeños; seasoned with curry powder, allspice, and nutmeg; then added the roasted vegetables. I used low fat condensed milk and light coconut milk. I omitted the ginger and extra sugar (which I agree is completely unnecessary). I did enjoy the addition of sour cream, as the extra jalapeños made it quite spicy, but would leave off the additional thyme next time. I think the thyme would have been a better addition had I left in the ginger. This is a great recipe and using coconut milk is a smart idea.

Excellent!!!!!  Made to serve before Prime Rib on Christmas.  I microwaved the squash to cut it, then roasted it in the oven before scooping out into the soup pot.  Next time I'll use an extra Jalapeno for sure.  I added a few teaspoons of jalapeno sauce to taste to the pot (triple batch), which 3 of us agreed it needed.  The sour cream on top was pretty but not necessary.  LOVED this recipe and can't wait to make again!!!!!!

Beyond delicious. Halved the squash, and roasted with a dab of butter and salt/pepper at 375 degrees for 1-1/4 hours. Threw in 1/2 red bell pepper and a large carrot since needing to use up. Didn’t de-seed the jalapeno as we wanted the soup to have some kick (davey’s personal recipe only dices the jalapeno so seeding it is likely an AR edit; probably why a number of reviewers think it lacks heat). Omitted the sugar. Added several splashes of sauvignon blanc, 1 teaspoon curry, and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. Will double this recipe the next time. Thanks, davey, for sharing a superb recipe.

YUM!! A very rich and delicious soup. I had to add a little more broth since my squash was a little large. I also added a couple splashes of dry white wine. To save on fat calories I substituted fat-free evap. milk and light coconut milk. It is still very decadent. After it was done and blended I added a little more fresh ginger and some sriracha. One jalepeno wasnt quite enough for our taste. Didn't feel it needed the sugar or the sour cream. We don't usually care for the sweetness of butternut squash soup so this was a great alternative. Will definately make this again and again!!!!

My kids LOVED this soup, but i did leave out the jalapeno and substituted the fresh ginger for powdered ginger.  I think the coconut milk adds a smoothness and less white sugar is needed, if any at all. Will make again because it was easy and quick! For added spice, i followed a reviewer and added sirachi for kick or Tabasco sauce. Enjoy!

This was fantastic!! It will definitely be my go to butternut squash soup recipe... good enough for the fanciest dinner party! Due to not having some things on hand I made the following changes:
Omitted the milk and used a full can of coconut milk
Omitted the sugar (just my taste)
Used about 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth 
Didn't have the jalapeno, sour cream or thyme so didn't use them. It was phenomenal without though.
I finished off each bowl with a squeeze of fresh lime juice and it really took it up a few notches. The acidity cuts the sweetness of the squash and gives it another dimension of flavour.

I am amazed no one has said this but...I gave it 4 stars due to the richness.  Far too much milk.  I would cut the amount of milk added in HALF and even then it would likely be very rich still.  Will make again with the adjustment and let you know how it goes.

Easy & delicious!  We like really spicy foods...so I used 4 jalapenos with seeds & it was great (still not all that spicy but very flavorful).  I omitted sour cream cuz it's already very rich.  Don't skip the fresh thyme on top - it added really nice flavor.

SO GOOD!!!!! I was trying this recipe out to see if it would be fit for Thanksgiving. I made a double batch last night, and my family DEVOURED it. It's probably the best soup I've ever made. I will definitely be making this again, probably later this week.

First time I've ever made butternut squash soup and I have to say the results were fantastic!!  It was also very easy, just a little time consuming but it was definitely worth it.  Followed the recipe except I left a few seeds from the jalapeno just to make sure it had an extra kick, and it sure did!  Can't wait to eat up all the leftovers during the week.

My husband would never dream of ordering soup at a restaurant. It's not his thing, and he hates paying for something he's usually disappointd in. I tried this soup after reading through the reviews, and he was AMAZED. He took leftovers to work and told me he almost cried it was so good. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, what a really delicious soup! I did roast the squash, only because it is so much easier to work with after roasting.  Cutting the raw squash in half is difficult, let alone cutting into cubes! I used 1 1/2 jalapeno peppers, perfect bite and low fat evaporated milk.  I did not serve with sour cream, the soup is so creamy you really don't need it.  I will taste before adding the sugar next time, I don't think you would need it, but...? Very good and is now in my recipe box!  Thanks Davey for the recipe!

Holy molly!  This is one of the best things to come out of my kitchen in a long while.  It's got some heat, but WOW!  The flavor is fantastic.  Coconut milk and fresh ginger makes this recipe.  I used EVOO instead of butter and used just a few tbsps.

This was my favorite butternut squash soup yet! The Asian flair was awesome. I'm not sure it's appropriately named, though.  I didn't really have a kick and I doubled the amount of jalepeno in it. You'd probably have to add some cayenne if you want it spicy. But I like it how it was, more mild. I cut back on the ginger just a touch and it was a good amount. Then I used cream rather than the evaporated milk and simmered about 1/2 tsp dried thyme leaves in the soup because I didn't have fresh. Garnished with sour cream and cilantro leaves (cilantro is nice with thai flavors).

This is by far the best butternut squash Ive ever tasted including out at nice restaurants. the jalapeno adds delicous spicy flavor. I made this for a dinner party and my friends all raved about it all night. To make it a little fancier I put the following toppings on little lines on top of the soup: sunflower kernels (hulled of course), sour cream, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary. yum yum

i liked this, but thought the ginger was far too over powering - perhaps mine was particularly potent - but i will be using less next time.  there's enough promise there, though, that there will be a next time.

Soup is delish and I will with out a doubt make it again.  The only thing I'd somehow like to change is the fact that it has a slightly gummy/chalky consistency.  Not sure what ingredient might have made it this way.  Either way, it was a huge hit and I ate it for lunch all week!

It was the best soup I've ever eaten. The modifications I made...
- Cut and cubed butternut, coated w coconut oil and roasted at 350 degrees. 
- I had no evaporated milk but google says a good substitution is 3/4 water mixed with 2/3 powdered milk to equal 1 cup evaporated milk. They're the same thing! 
- I added an extra jalapeño pepper to sauté. I used coconut oil to sauté instead of butter.
- I added paprika powder and turmeric powder after the milk and coconut milk was poured in and mixed along with sea salt and pepper. I let it cook a little longer to allow flavors to meld then puree. 
- No need for sour cream! 
- For a diary-free soup - it is totally ok to increase the coconut milk and eliminate the evaporated milk. It'll still taste delicious!

I'm big on using as few ingredients as possible...and what I have on hand (6 for this recipe). My simplified version turned out great!  

PreStep1. I started baking the squash before even finding the recipe: In eighths, facedown in 1/2 cup of water at 350 for 30min. I'd probably do it their way for ease next time.
Step 1. Only added butter, onion, and 1 tsp of ginger because that's all I had. Created 'broth' out of 14oz water and some beef boullion.
Step 2. Skipped all the ingredients added in Step 2. Scooped the soft baked squash out of its shells and blended with one chilpotle pepper packed in adobo sauce (sm can), pepper and a lot (~1.5tsp) of salt.  No garnish.
Fantastico!!! (3 adults loved, too spicy for the kids...might try 1/2 a pepper for them.

This was just delicious!! We love spicy food and I was expecting this to be a little spicy, however it wasn't, so don't be afraid to try this recipe as is if you're not into spicy foods.
The flavourings in this soup certainly didn't overpower the wonderful butternuttiness and creaminess of this soup, but they did give the soup a wonderful depth of flavours.
Next time I'll add an extra jalapeno though.

Very good rich creamy soup. I roasted the squash as others had done. Caramelized the onion, jalapeno and ginger just a bit first, then added the broth, canned milk (no coconut milk to try) and cooked squash. Still simmering but I don't think I will need the sugar. I was a bit anxious about the jalapeno but cannot detect any hotness yet, we'll see after reheating.

Very good and very filling, though when we ate it that first night we didn't think it had much of a kick.  It most certainly did a couple of days later when I finished the leftovers!

I wanted this to be better than it was. Used roasted squash, but found it too plain for my taste. I added a bit more thyme & added some curry powder in the hopes to bring the flavors out, but it still just seemed . . . kind of boring. Not bad, just uninteresting.

This is excellent!  It provides a great base for carrying other ingredients you might like to add, too.  I already had roasted squash on hand, omitted onion and jalapeno, because I didn't have them.  I also used 4 oz of heavy cream + 8 oz of skim milk in place of evaporated milk.  I ended up adding about 1/8 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp white pepper and 1 tsp sea salt to achieve the "kick".  In place of grated fresh, I chopped up crystallized ginger.  So, I pretty much used a different set of ingredients to achieve something similar, but it's what I had on hand!!!

I doubled the recipe but made some changes. In a double batch I used one Jalapeno, 1 tbsp crushed red peppers, 1 can evap. milk, one can coconut milk, 1 32oz box of organic chicken broth, and NO sugar!
I pureed only 1/2 of the soup to allow for texture. 

Oh is it good!

My husband, who does NOT like squash LOVED this soup!  He asked me to make a double batch next time.  I did roast the squash before making the soup.  It was easy to scoop out the flesh of the squash.

Great recipe!  I didn't have the recommended milks, so I used half and half.  I also didn't have the sour cream, so I passed. Such a hearty seasoned soup without a heavy squash taste.  Because we enjoy heat, we doubled the jalapenos.  Highly recommend.

This is awesome!!! I used to be a picky eater and never would have dreamed of trying something like this.  I'd sure be missing out!  The second time I left out the sour cream, because I don't think it really adds anything to the soup (except fat!).  I used dried thyme.  Use a lot-it totally pulls the soup together!

Great flavor a little thin for my liking and I don't think the flavor wouild have been near as good if I hadn't roasted the squash with olive oil, salt, and pepper instead of boiling it.  I also don't think I could have ever gotten it peeled in order to boil it because I almost didn't get it cut in half.  I would make it again though.

Great soup!  Coconut milk can overpower so be careful on the amount used or you will have coconut milk soup with squash.  However, coconut milk lovers may prefer the latter!

I was cleaning out my fridge and had a lot of roasted butternut squash, some chopped apples, two jalapenos, sliced onions from a turkey dinner the beginning of the week. I thought of squash soup and seeing a receipe that used all my leftovers was amazing and then looked in the cabinet and actually had the evaporated milk and coconut milk too!  It was meant to be and was fabulous, my husband and I both LOVED the spice!!  I used the apples too, didn't want to throw them away!  Will definitely make this again!!  A great change from squash soups I've had in the past!

I've never had a squash soup until now, needing an excuse so that I could eat squash without my roommates throwing a fit. So far its been a hit several times with both my friends and myself. As always I did a little of a spin off sense I can't leave a recipe as is. When going about making this soup I'll use a whole can of coconut milk, 2 jalapenos, about 1/4C finely grated ginger, and a little cayenne pepper if it needs a little more "kick"!

Excellent, hot and filling soup for a cold day.  Very flavorful.  Made it several times with raving reviews from my family.  I substituted maple syrup in place of the sugar, and red pepper flakes in place of the jalepeno pepper. In addition, a couple cloves will give this a nice smoky flavor.  You can also use a scotch bonnet (half-a whole one is too much) in place of the jalepeno.

This was a delightful surprise. I randomly grabbed a butternut squash from the market not knowing what I would do with it looked up some recipes and found this. Something that I noticed was that the sour cream seemed to bring out a lot more of the sweetness of the soup. Also my husband made the suggestion to add a bit of ham to it and it was AMAZING :-)

I don't even like soup, and this is the best meal I've had in ages.  A bowl of this and a loaf of crusty bread makes a fall evening sing.  (Husband thought so, too, and he's a dedicated carnivore.)

This is a healthy soup with a few changes.  I placed the squash, jalapeno, carrot, and onion on a foil-lined pan and sprayed with butter spray before placing in the oven at 375 to roast until brown. Then mashed and simmered with the broth about 30 minutes.  Used non-fat evaporated milk and low fat coconut milk and used my stick blender after cooking down five minutes or so.  Did not garnish and did not feel it needed any, really.  Used two jalapenoes and next time will leave in some seeds, as it was not spicy at all but still quite good.  Thanks for sharing!

so yummy, a little bit sweet and spicy!  i made a few minor adjustments for what i had and it probably came out less sweet than the contributor intended:  a dollop of thai chili/garlic sauce for the jalapeno, 1 full c. coconut milk and no evaporated milk, fresh thai basil for thyme. skipped salt (enough in broth), pepper and sugar.  i also crushed a couple cloves of garlic in when i was sauteeing, because i put garlic in everything, period.  perfect spice for us, we both used the sour cream.  will make again.

Amazing!  I did not have time to roast the squash like a lot of other people and I used skim milk and grated coconut instead of the coconut milk and dehydrated milk but it still runed out soooo great!!!

Loved this soup!  I had squash soup years ago and had been looking for a good recipe and it fit the bill.  I also got to use the new stick blender from my sister and it worked perfectly...a lot less trouble than using a blender!  I'm going to try adding shrimp and see how that tastes, too!

Loved this soup just the way the recipe is! So velvety and tasty! I will make again and again. Better than the curried butternut squash recipe! Thanks so much. UPDATE: I have come to omit the sugar, as the coconut milk makes it plenty sweet. I also use slightly less broth as is creates a thicker soup, which I like. I usually use two squashes, and double everything but the evaporated milk (still use 1 can) and use 3 cups broth,. I roast the squash  ahead of time, as they provide excellent flavor as they caramelize in the oven. I refrigerate the squash if I make it a day or two ahead of time and it makes the soup a quick meal then! Still one of my all-time favorites!

My guests lapped this soup up! It is very flavorful, but a touch sweet for my tastes. I'm going to increase the ginger and add some chili's to it next time to try to cut through that sweet, sweet flavor. It is good. Don't hesitate to make this per the recipe!

This recipe truly is 5 stars!!  I did not roast my squash, but followed the recipe.  I did bake my squash for 15 mins on 400 degrees to make it easier to peel and chop.  Then I only simmered for 15-20 mins.  This was not too spicy in my opinion, just the right amount of kick.  It only needed a dollop of sour cream on top and I sprinkled dried thyme as well.  Served with homemade breadsticks.

This soup rocks! The hot hits on the back end of the taste.

Spicy with a cream sauce is always muted, so this recipie goes in the sweet, hot category.

I have a hand mixer, so the job was relatively easy, after getting the squash cut and mixed.

Try this. With a little bit of effort, you will get a wonderful and different soup.

Not for the faint hearted in the kitchen, or the people who like bland.

I actually made this soup in October for my coworkers, and it was fantastic.  I had about 4 cups left, and I froze it just to see how it would do.  Pulled it out of the freezer yesterday morning and had it for dinner last night.  It was still amazing!!  Thank you for such a great recipe.

I used this recipe as a base for a really thick stew of veggies that were about to go bad. I baked the squash ahead of time, then blended it with the listed ingredients, using 1 can of coconut milk instead of evaporated milk + coconut. I then let it simmer with potatoes, leeks, and portabella mushrooms and thinned it a little with milk.

A big hit with the family but Didn't get much kick. Reading reviews I would also add another Jalapeno pepper for more heat. Next time will omit the white sugar. Coconut milk gives it plenty of sweetness. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I didn't have jalapeños on hand, so I used a dash of cayenne. I also used brown sugar instead of white, and added a generous dash of cinnamon. Didn't have the coconut milk on hand, but I did have some apple juice, so I substituted there too. I look forward to trying it with the coconut milk. I garnished my bowl with roasted walnuts and fresh parsley. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

There is a reason this is a 5-star recipe.  Its really good.

You HAVE to roast the squash first.  cut in half, put cut sides down into a baking dish, add a bit of water and bake at 350 for an hour. 

i followed the recipe exactly, but only used half of a jalapeno, as the one i had was HOT.  

my family raved about this soup.  definitely a keeper.  it tastes like something you would find at a super elegant restaurant.  

well done davey!

Delicious!! I adjusted the following: used my homegrown buttercup squash instead of buttercup; roasted squash as recommended in reviews; LOTS of ginger and jalapeno; added a bit of celery in with them at the beginning; omitted the sugar; added a healthy tsp of green curry paste. Kept the sour cream and thyme. Perfect!

My family and friends LOVED this soup this Thanksgiving. No one could figure out it was made with squash! And they certainly couldn't guess the coconut milk or ginger. But it was a huge hit! I don't own any sort of electric mixer or blender to puree this, but I had hand-pureed a bunch of butternut squash for pies and cakes so I used some of that, and for the onions and ginger, I just minced it. I don't think the onions interfered with the texture too much, though I'm sure it would be fantastic pureed too. I also didn't have any thyme so I skipped that. This was just an amazing soup that I will definitely be making again (we still have some squash puree in the fridge!). Thanks a bunch for this wonderful recipe!

Family enjoyed this for Thanksgiving.  Used only about 8 oz of evaporated milk because it was what I had (didn't want to open another can).  Definitely will make again.  I think next time I would add at least another 1/2 to another whole tsp of ginger.  Thanks for sharing.  Oh definitely needs salt so don't forget to taste.

Fantastic!  I made this lower fat by using fat free evaporated milk and light butter...  I will cut out the sugar on the next batch. **Made this again and tried to cut out the sugar, but not a good idea. 
This is the best butternut squash soup ever...thanks for the recipe!

This soup was amazing!  My first time ever having or making butternut squash soup.  The only thing I did different was I roasted the squash at 400 for 30 min. after drizzling with a little butter and sprinkling with kosher salt.  It warmed the house and created a terrific aroma.  After roasting, I boiled with the stock as described in the recipe for 15 min.  Friends and family loved it.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used EVOO instead of butter, added some carrots that I needed to eat, and used Greek yogurt with chopped green onions instead of sour cream and thyme for topping.

Amazing recipe.  I love the kick but would definitely add 2 jalapenos next time (was very mild with just 1.)  I used heavy cream in place of the evaporated milk only because it's what I had on hand (and it was delish!)  I also like Dried Apple Chips on top for garnish.   Going in my recipe box.  Yum-O!

Excellent soup! The ginger was a great touch. I made a few modifications. Instead of roasting the squash in the oven, I just sauteed the squash and then covered on the stovetop with a 2 tablespoons of oil for about 10-15 minutes until they were tender (I cut it into small cubes so they cooked easily). Separately, I sauteed the onions, ginger, chili pepper, 1 clove garlic, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg, 3/4 tsp dried thyme and then added the cooked squash and let saute for another 5-10 minutes. I added chicken broth until it started to boil and then added one small diced apple. I let simmer on low for about 20 minutes (just so the flavors would develop and blend in together). Turned stove off, added 1/2 can low-fat evaporated milk, mixed, covered, and let stand for 15 minutes. Then, removed bay leaf and used immersion blended to make soup. I did not add coconut milk, sour cream (though offered as garnish), sugar, nor did I use butter. It was excellent!!!!  Oh, and I also added a little bit more cayenne pepper for added heat!!

I halved this recipe and though it was delicious I was missing the kick of the jalapeno and the flavor of the coconut milk.  To make up I sprinkled cayenne pepper on top. Next time I may do as others suggested and use more coconut and less evaporated milk as well as throwing in a few jalapeno seeds. There will definitely be a next time!

yummy!I added a sweet potatoe and an apple that needed to be used up.I cut everything up and simmered all the vegetables in the broth until tender,then I put it all in the blender until smooth.It was thick,so I added some water to get it the right  consistency and then added 2% milk and unsweetend coconut milk( I used a little more of each) and so I added brown sugar( brings out sweetness aand gives flavor),  1/4 t. nutmeg along with fresh ginger  from  tube and 1/4 t. ground  thyme, as that is what I had on hand - the flavor is wonderful. I only used 1 jalapeno as I felt it  didn't really need more but does add flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly and my soup came out a little thick. I had to add extra water while the squash was cooking and coconut milk at the end.. Overall, pretty good

awesome soup! i didn't roast the squash before hand, but i might have let it boil 40 minutes as opposed to 30 (wasn't really watching the clock); it cooked beautifully. i also threw in some garlic.
agree with previous reviewers that a second jalepeno would have been nice, but i used a good amount of fresh ginger, and a dash of cayenne pepper as well.
i ended up adding the whole can of coconut milk on a whim (the soup is super creamy), and added some curry as well, which plays nicely with the flavors. i used no sugar (the sweetness is perfect already), and the sour cream isn't really necessary.

Amazing! I used brown sugar rather than white. Doubled the chicken broth. Used fat free evaporated milk and light coconut milk.  Added into the mix 1 lean ham steak cubed (shortly after adding milk) and a packet of quality chicken bouillon seasoning for a little meaty-ness to slightly offset the coconut milk. Perfection!

I just made this soup.  I used extra broth as I too had squash that wasn't covered.  I added sriracha sauce and some cayenne pepper as I didn't get any heat before that.  Well, as it cooked it got hotter.  I guess I made it too hot as the kids complained.  Oh well, be careful adding any extra heat if serving to ids.  Still have to wait and see whether my finicky husband likes it.

I love this recipe for the perfect sweet and savory combination.   I made this with 4 acorn squash, added 2 tsp of salt, and I replaced the thyme with spoked paprika.  I saved big dallops of sour cream for garnish rather than adding to the pot.  Next time I may add a couple boullion cubes rather than the salt for that extra layer of flavor.    Yummee!!

I live in the PNW, this year my squash harvest came with a surprising butternut (all the sproutlings look the same at the ACE where I buy them so I sometimes get surprised with what I think I am planting!).  This recipe is delicious!  I used 1 medium and 2 small butternuts, ended up added 1 tsp of salt and had to had 1.5 cans of the chicken broth to cover the squash.  I let it simmer down to thicken and just mashed the squash with a potato masher after it had cooked the 30 minutes.  So YUMMY!  Will be making this with my garden fresh peppers, onions and squash every year.  Thank you!!

Excellent!  I added two cloves of garlic to the onions, ginger and jalapeno, and my butternut was already cooked (roasted and mashed the other night).  Used homemade chicken stock and a whole can of lite coconut milk, omitting the evaporated milk.  I also omitted the sugar.  Delicious and very pretty!

Wonderful!  I had three old, hard butternut squash from my mother-in-law's garden, and decided to test this recipe.  I'd never made squash soup before (is it always so hard to cut and peel?) but this was fabulous!  I roasted the squash in butter first and I added more sugar because I had more squash, but other than that, it was prepared as written.  Don't leave out the sour cream, it really adds to the flavor.

I made this soup with 2% evaporated milk, fat free sour cream and lite coconut milk and it was very creamy and delish!  I also added 2 carrots, did not take the time to roast the squash, just boiled, and the emulsion blender worked like a charm!  I will make this for guests in the future and also try freezing for easy reheating later.

I used two jalapenos (hot ones!) and a 2.5 to 3 lb squash. I also used the vegetarian recommendation listed - olive oil instead of butter to saute the onions and jalapenos plus 1 extra cup of broth (used veggie broth this time as that is what I had) and 0.5 cup more of the coconut milk - and eliminated the garnish. It does have a kick to it! I find many butternut squash soups tend to be a little bland, but this was very nice. Thanks!

Delicious! Next time I make sure to have fresh ginger on hand--had to use ginger powder. Kicked it up a little with paprika and mustard seed powder for a bit of extra warmth, since I was also using a green chile pepper instead of jalopeno. It really is a versatile recipe! My picky husband loved it even though he usually is not into meals that look like baby food. Oh, and the crunchy blanched pieces of broccoli for garnish, cut small, into the plate they go right before you serve. Definitely a keeper!

This soup is delicious! Perfect for fall. I also roasted the squash beforehand, used 2% evaporated milk and low fat coconut milk and the richness is perfect. No need for sour cream! I'm not known for being the best cook but anyone can do this. Enjoy!

This recipe is great!  I nice variation on the usual bland squash season.  I omitted the evaporated milk and used whole milk: it is creamy and delicious.  I like to crumble tortilla chips in mine: delicioso!

Soup came out wonderful. I followed the suggestion of others and baked the squash. I also held back on about half the ginger/chile pepper. The thyme is a nice touch; I just sprinkled a little on at the end. I didn't use any Sour Cream because I thought it was creamy enough already.

Very tasty!  As others have done, I roasted the squash instead of boiling.  Very good as is, but even better with some curry powder or cumin added.

Wow!! I don't often cook with butternut squash, but this soup was easy to make and came out amazing! As others suggested, I roasted the squash first, and I also used green chillies as I didn't have jalapenos. Perfect combination of sweet and spicy, it was a huge hit! Definitely making this again!

My boyfriend and I both loved this. I made everything lo-cal: used fat-free plain yogurt instead of sour cream, light coconut milk, and actually canned, diced jalapenos. Everything turned out delicious (and spicy). This recipe is a keeper.

MMMMM, excellent!  We really enjoyed this one a lot!  Used light coconut milk and 1% evaporated milk.  I opted to leave out the sour cream and fresh thyme at the end...don't think the sour cream especially is necessary, personal preference.  Did not have any fresh thyme!  Loved it and will make again for sure.  Went wonderfully with some Cheddar & Jalapeno biscuits that I make, yummy!!

Made a double batch.  Followed advice on the cumin and I may have used a little more fresh ginger (eyeballed it).  I will serve with Rooster sauce (chile sauce) and cilantro, maybe a dollop of sourcream.  My husband has an excellent palate and he called it cuisine, so "Done!"

Really enjoyed the flavor of this - the texture was quite thick (not bad, though).  I may add a bit more broth next time to see what it's like a little less thick.  I followed the recipe as it was written for the most part, except my sqaush was about 2.5 lbs and I added some red pepper flakes. Used light coconut milk vs. regular it was still good!

Amazing, I forgot the thyme I was too hungry used slightly less ginger, and greek yogurt instead of sour cream (I do this with everything never use sour cream any more), and I  used cubed squash from the store. I also used my Nutri Bullet. So delicious!

I used only the coconut milk because of a lactose issue, it was perfect.  And amazing! I didn't have any jalopenos on hand, so I added a dash of cayenne.  I bought the cubed butternut squash at the grocery and threw it right in the pot with the broth, onions and ginger, in about 20 minutes, I used the stick blender and voila! Thank you so much for this fast, easy, awesome recipe! YUMMO!

So good! Almost more of a dessert given the sweetness. I had to add almost twice the stock to cover the squash, but other than that I made the recipe as is. I think next time I make it, I'll use two jalapeno's, as I didn't really taste it in this batch. I really don't think I'd change anything else.

I really loved this soup. It was really easy to make and is delicious. Instead of adding evaporated milk and coconut milk, I added only the can of coconut milk. It was an experiment since I'd prefer not to open two cans and not use all the contents for a recipe. I didn't miss the evaporated milk at all and the coconut milk made it sweet enough that I omitted the sugar too.

Great starting point. Left out the (bizarre) coconut and evaporated milk and used 1 c regular milk instead. Jalapeno seems an odd choice with butternut squash, so I substituted 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, and 1/4 tsp each turmeric and paprika. Cooked the onions longer than called for too, and added the thyme to the sauteed onions. The resulting soup had a nice earthy spicy flavor, without the bite of jalapeño.

I used Sunshine Squash instead of Butternut, since I had it on hand. I skipped the sugar, sour cream, evaporated milk, and butter. Instead, I sautéed my onions in 1 T. coconut oil and used a full can of coconut milk. I ran my hand blender around the batch after it was done cooking. Moo-AH! It was magnifique!

I'm not a fan of squash (of any kind) but this recipe is absolutely amazing!! The onion and jalapeno "kick" make it. Thanks for the tip about roasting the squash first because it was a bear to peel. Definitely a keeper!

I really don't think there is any way I could improve on this recipe.  It's absolutely delicious and it's incredibly easy.  It's possible to make it in a pot, in a slow cooker,  or, if you're like me, in a rice cooker in Asia.  I have made this recipe three times now, over the space of four years, and just pulled it out this week because I remembered how delicious it was.  I have used both squash and pumpkin to great success, and usually use red pepper flakes instead of fresh peppers, because fresh peppers are hard to find here and I HAVE red pepper flakes.  In any case, it's delicious, and whether or not you have a blender (I don't) it's good smooth OR chunky, especially if you like texture in your food.  My Russian friends are huge fans too.  There's something they love about soup with a big dollop of sour cream in the middle.  Enjoy!

Wow! Took Sandi's advice and roasted it for over an hour at 425  along w the peppers(2) and onion (30 min for those).  Skipped evaporated milk but did whole can of coconut milk. Very satisfying.

OMG - this was SO VERY good!  I must've had a larger squash as I needed extra liquid to cook the squash in.  Then poured off quite a bit, before adding in the coconut milk to make a thicker soup.  After several tries, found about 1-1/2 jalepenos work best - not too hot, not too tame.

SO GOOD. Texture was awesome.  Almost frothy right after blending. I omitted jalapenos (didnt have) & added cumin, curry, garlic, cayanne, & nutmeg to taste to give more depth in flavor.

Great recipe, easy to make ahead and just add milk when rewarming.  My daughter made for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a hit!  Used nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Delicious.  Will make it often!

WOW WOW WOW. Have made this three times now. I eat it until I can barely move. I never add the sour cream or thyme at the end and it doesn't matter. This is a KEEPER.

This soup is so good.  I didn’t have coconut milk and didn’t want to use evaporated milk so I used almond milk.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and I omitted the sugar.  The soup was creamy enough as is so I also omitted the sour cream.  I know I made some changes but I think the soup would be five stars without the changes.  I will make again.

Oh So Good! This soup was delish! I did add a little cayenne and sage since we like these. All recipes say to puree it . It tasted so good I skipped that step.I also roasted the squash and onion.I really did not think my husband would eat it. To my surprise he went back for 2nd.'s. This will be a family favorite. Thanks for sharing.

I JUST finished making and eating this incredible soup.  I used Tabasco since I didn't have jalapenos on hand.  I also used Simply Asian ginger seasoning because I had no fresh ginger available.  Since I prefer my soups on the chunky side, I just used a potato masher in the pot to break up the squash a bit.  My husband and sons loved it as well.  Throughly comforting and enjoyable on a brisk, autumn day!!!

Best soup ever!  My family was skeptical but they all went back for seconds! I did alter it a little.  I used one 4oz can of chopped and peeled green chiles instead of jalapeño, I baked 2 butternut squash instead of peeling and cubing it (cut in half, remove seeds, face down on cookie sheet for 45-60 mins at 350 degrees), and used 2 cans of chicken broth.  I did not use ginger as my family doesn't like it. After tasting it, I didn't use sour cream or thyme.  It was awesome as is!

Great soup! I made a few changes based on some of the comments: i roasted the squash first with a little butter, salt and pepper, added double the frsh ginger, 1 tsp red pepper flakes and 1/2 a cup fat free yogurt instead of the evaporated milk. I used my own chicken stock which was heavy on the thyme so I left it out of the soup. I also used splenda instead of the sugar. Garnished with crackers and sour cream. yum!

I love this soup! I takes longer than 15 minutes to prep b/c the squash is not easy to peel/ cut. That being said, it is worth every minute of work for the finished product. I add 2 red bell peppers, red pepper flakes and extra coconut milk. It is really great on cold fall and winter nights :)

I use powdered ginger to taste and extra jalapeno.  Usually I also leave out the sour cream, and sometimes if I don't have evap milk, I'll just use a little whole milk instead.  It's creamy, spicy, smooth, and DELICIOUS!  I love it!

After reading some of the reviews I chose to roast the butternut squash.  I only roasted it for 30 minutes at 425 & it turned out perfectly.  I used 2 jalapenos and dry ginger-about a 1/2 tsp.  I loved it but felt the heat could have been stronger so I added some cayenne pepper. I did not even try the sour cream. I will play around with the spices a little maybe curry powder? I think you can do many things with this soup & it is delicious as it written.  Start there & add what fits your personal tastes!

Wow!! Awesome!! I modified the recipe to fit my Paleo lifestyle and added a little more kick!! I used coconut oil instead of butter, used 1 can of coconut milk instead of using evap milk, added 2 carrots instead of sugar, eliminated the sour cream, added 1 tsp. hot curry powder then just some fresh herbs from my garden, tarragon, basil and oregano, about a Tbl. each. It took a little longer to cook because of the carrots, next time I will chop them smaller so it will take less time. It was AWESOME!!

Oh my goodness!!!! WOW!!! Loved it. I roasted the squash, onions, and garlic first. I did omit the jalepeno just because I have to little mouths to feed. The 6 yr old wasn't a fan but the 1 yr old loved it. My husband and I both...well...scraped our bowls (embarrassed face). Oh and I put a dollop of Thai green curry paste into our individual bowls. It was sooooo wonderful. Thank you so much!

This recipe has been used a few times by my husband and I with great results. The only change we make is subbing out the coconut milk and sugar for a bit of almond milk, since that's what we have on hand. It really doesn't even need the sour cream. This is a delicious soup that is packed with nutrients!

This soup is fantastic.  Like many other reviewers, I omitted the evaporated milk and sour cream--mostly because I didn't have them on hand.  I just substituted a little more coconut milk and a little more chicken broth.  It was still gloriously creamy and the jalapeno gave it the perfect amount of heat.

Made as part of Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. I toasted some almonds with cajun seasoning and it tied everything together. Not too spicy for anyone.. however next time I make it as a family meal I look forward to added a little more kick!

Best soup EVER! to make things easier, I use the peeled/seeded squash from Costco and use jalapeños in a jar, and grated ginger that comes in a jar too. Saves lots of time in prep! Oh, really don't forget the sour cream and thyme...it's the perfect topper and looks great too!

Awesome recipe! Perfect blend of flavors! For personal preference, I sauteed the onion, ginger and jalapenos in olive oil, omitted the sugar, and used two additional jalapenos for more heat. Also, I used two butternut squashes. I roasted the first one and pureed with the rest of the ingredients, prior to adding the coconut and evaporated milk. I chopped the second squash into bite sized pieces to add texture. Seriously awesome stuff. Can't wait to make it again!!

I love butternut squash soup, but I have never made it.  I followed this recipe exactly and I thought it was quite good.  I liked the addition of ginger and the jalapeño.  My husband thought it was to rich, but he did like the flavor.  This was easy to make.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent soup...perfect texture & taste with a beautiful presentation as well!! I used half fresh apple juice and half chicken broth, and cut down a little on the sugar. It was perfect. Next time, I'll add another jalepeno...I like it HOT!

This soup was amazing. The only small changes I made was I baked the squash and scooped it because it's just easier that way. I also added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, and about a teaspoon or so of curry powder. So tasty!

Lovely soup.  I also roasted my squash first to deepen the flavour. I try to keep the fat down so I used fat free evapourated milk and I omitted the coconut milk and added more fat free chicken broth and a little greek yogurt. I will definitely make this again and again.

I've been making this for years but now do a vegan version- olive oil instead of butter, vegetable stock instead of chicken, and all coconut milk rather than evaporated. I actually prefer the vegan version! I also prefer leeks to onions. So, so good and easy to play with as the description suggests.

I made this and have a few times since.  I tweaked it a tiny bit after first try according to my family's tastes.  Some are finicky.  I put spices on the table for those that are a bit more adventurous, lol.  I personally loved it exactaly as it was.  But most soups are my weakness, lol.

This soup turned out good. It goes great with grilled cheese. I was out of coconut milk and evaporated milk the first time I made it, so I used almond milk for all of it.  It turned out good. The second time I had the right milks, and the coconut milk does taste better in it. I added another jalapeno the second time because it didn't have enough "kick".  It would be great even spicier, so next time I'll add a habanero or ghost pepper.  I presently have a lot of kabocha squash, so I'll be trying it with those since they are interchangeable with butternut.

I have made this recipe numerous times, and though I have tried others... This by far my favorite!!! Since I’m vegetarian I just substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth. It’s a hit with all I serve it to.. yummy!

Very tasty soup. I made vegan style with extra coconut milk and veggie broth. I agree it can use extra kick with 2 jalapeños and a dash of cayenne pepper. Also added paprika ,coriander, and 2 tbsp sherry.

If I could give this more stars I would!  This soup is rich and decadent!  I followed the suggestions of others & roasted the squash versus boiling it.  Add crusty bread & you've got a meal.  I'll definitely make this again and again and again!!

Enjoyed the soup but found it too creamy for my liking. Will cut back on the coconut milk next time. I used 2% milk instead of evaporated milk.

This  soup has Rock Star Status!  I used the entire jalapeno because we like spice.  The only other change I made was to use enough chicken broth to cover the vegetables before simmering.  We will definitely be making this again!

Delicious! Halved the squash, cleaned out the seeds, put 2 tsp butter in the pitted out area of both halves. Sprinkled with paprika, thyme, cayenne, and ginger to taste. Roasted the butternut squash on 375 deg F for 75 min. After the butter melted, used a grill brush to coat squash with the butter. Diced the onion but also added a diced red bell pepper and used 2 jalapeños. Sautéed with a tsp of butter and added half the can of chicken broth. Once cooked thoroughly, added the butternut squash and remainder of the chicken broth along with the evaporated milk and coconut milk. Brought to a boil and added salt and pepper to taste. Puréed in the blender then added back to a clean pot and simmered on low for another 30 min. Served with sprinkled paprika and thyme as well as a "dollop of daisy".

Made it as the recipe called for, with the 1 exception of modifying it per the most helpful review: I roasted the squash with butter, salt and pepper, for about 30 minutes at 350. It ended up being more colorful that way. It was very creamy and thick, so next time I'd make it healthier for my waistline with low fat milks. Spicy and delicious,  this one pleased all those who tasted it.

This is a wonderful soup.  I added twice as much garlic and ginger and 3 jalapenos.   The best thing I did was replace the sugar with 2 tablespoons  real maple syrup which added a really nice sweetness and flavour.  All of my guests raved about how good this was.

Roasted the squash to keep flavour (seasoned with pepper and raw sugar), used 1 cup of coconut milk and no sour cream or condensed milk. This went down a treat in our house. Will make again and play around with the ingredients.

I made this recipe for Canadian Thanksgiving since I already had all the ingredients, all of my guest were asking for more soup, we thought it was delicious and so easy to make. I added a bit extra stock and only coconut milk, the soup was just perfect, my husband wants me to make it again. Loved it. Thank you

I've tried with and without the jalepenos and they're a bit too spicy for me. We just got a Trader Joe's in our area and they sell the cubed butternut for $1.99. It makes it so much easier and other stores sell it cubed for a lot more. I also found coconut milk there for a better price than any other place. Love this soup, it's one of my favorites!

Substituted 2 acorn squash instead of butternut. Was anticipating soup to be a bit thicker, so would either add more squash or reduce liquid volume (perhaps skip use of evaporated milk and just use coconut milk). Nice "kick" and flavour.

I roasted the squash before adding.  I absolutely love it!  The heat is just perfect.

I followed the recipe almost to the letter, except I added 1tsp of curry and I used 1tsp cayenne powder because I didn't have a fresh jalapeno. I didn't puree it, as I rather liked the chunkier texture. This and some crusty french bread will make for a stick to your insides comfort dinner on a blustery, winter night. Loved the flavor and the texture!

My family loves this recipe!  I've made it just as stated, as well as changed out the coconut milk with whatever I had on hand.  Loved it every time.  I double the recipe but not the jalapeno to keep the spice level down a bit.

This was amazing!!! I only changed a couple things. First off, I didn't use a chicken broth, I had chicken bouillon from epicure that I made into a broth. I made a little extra because I didn't have condensed milk. Instead I used a whole can of coconut cream instead of a half a cup of coconut milk. I also roasted the squash in olive oil for about 30-40 minutes already cubed up and at 350*. My last alteration was because I didn't have a jalapeños, I used some hot peppers from our garden. With the way everything cooked down, I didn't even need to purée. I whisked it while it simmered and we love having little bites of garlic/onion/pepper pieces in our soups. Everything was chopped so fine anyway so I don't think you need to Purée it unless you want to make it completely smooth. It was very smooth even by just whisking it. Very excited to have leftovers at lunch tomorrow! And you can toast the seeds in the oven at 250* for about 30-40 minutes (until crispy) or so with olive oil and salt (and pepper)... Just as yummy as pumpkin seeds! So glad I did it!

Sooooo good! I start by baking the squash in the oven. Saute onion, garlic,grated ginger and habanero(because I like the soup spicy)in coconut oil. Add cooked squash and all ingredients to the pot and smooth with the immersion blender. This soup is a staple in my home, thank you for the recipe!

This is going to be my new go-to butternut squash soup recipe. My modifications:  Used two pre-cut packages of squash and roasted them with a light coating of olive oil, garlic salt and white pepper at 400 degrees for about 45 min before putting into pot. I accidentally bought creme de coco instead of coconut milk so I used about half of what the recipe called for to manage sweetness. I used two jalapeños instead of one and use fresh ginger (don't substitute this!)- it was a hit! No need for sour cream, but add some croutons for crunch.

Yummy! I used a whole can of lite coconut milk and skipped the evaporated milk and sugar.  Not as spicy as I wanted (I know jalapenos can vary greatly, so no surprise), so I added a little cayenne to the mix.  Really beautiful, easy, and delicious.

4.5, next time I will dice the jalapeno rather than placing them in a food processor.  I listened to the other reviews stating they needed more heat.  This definitely helped but too spicy for me.

If I would have read the reviews and Roasted the squash, my experience would have been easier. I highly recommend cutting open the squash and cleaning out the "innards" before roasting. Rubbing olive oil on the exposed meat is always a good idea. I cooked the Onion, Jalapeno,Ginger mixture overnight, in a slow cooker. The complex flavor opened the sinuses!

I made the recipe as stated but left out the jalapeno since I have younger kids. I tasted it after it was all prepared and it just felt like it was missing something - it was a little bland. I added in some salt & pepper and nutmeg and it made this soup perfect. My husband didn't like it but the kids did.

Creamy deliciousness with the barest hint of the jalapeno to offset the natural sweetness of the squash.  Will definitely make it again!

Great Recipe and different from the typical "sweeter" butternut squash soup recipes that add pear, etc. I doubled the recipe but still only used 1 jalapeno and it was plenty hot and spicy.  Might have been waaaaay too hot if I would have added the second one.  Definitely making it again.

I tried this recipe as is and loved it! I had froze 1/2 of the recipe. I decided to try something new for leftover turkey from Christmas and defrosted the soup, added the turkey and heated it up. The flavors blended beautifully.

I have never had butternut squash before, but had purchased on and decided to try this recipe.  Although there was great flavor as I added more peppers to make it spicier.  This is a very rich soup and would be great as an add to a sandwich or salad.

This is a great recipe!  I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg right before I added the chicken stock.  I've cooked this a few times and this last time I didn't have any jalapeño so I just added cayenne peper and it was just as good.  I also don't add sour cream at the end and it's great! My boyfriend loves this soup...

Love this soup.  We get the cubed squash from Costco and then use two packages to double the recipe. No need to roast that way and really saves time.  I mostly use red pepper flakes instead of the jalapeno becuase that is what we have on hand.  Usually I'll saute up bacon and then some onion and red pepper in a little bacon grease and add it to the blended soup but it is good as written too. I only blend about 1/2 the soup because we like it a little chunkier.  A little glug of wine at the end never hurts too!

This soup is just incredible! The coconut milk adds a subtle sweetness to it. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely make it again!

love this recipe.  I follow the directions for the most part, but bake my squash first (350 around 60 minutes or so).  Helps to cut down the time actually making the soup.  It turns out perfect every time.

Overall pretty good.  I made with large jalapeno and 1/4 of seeds and it had a bit more then a little kick.   In retrospect realized that while I like spicy food I didn't like spicy soup.  Was not sure about the sugar so added about 3/4 tbs and it was little sweeter then I like.  Can taste the coconut quite a bit but the ginger is sublte, so may add more.  Taste is a bit one dimensional I feel like a little acid would be helpful, but haven't figured the best way.  Also some garlic might be a nice addition.

This soup is fabulous!  I substituted Light Coconut Milk, Fat Free Evaported Milk, and Fat Free Chicken Broth and it is still wonderful!

Great flavours in this soup - definitely not your traditional butternut squash soup.  Hubby loved the taste.  Will definitely be making this again!

Loved this! I wasn't so sure about it at first since I've never had a butternut squash soup but now I'm a BIG fan. Great for a cool fall day. Mmm.
