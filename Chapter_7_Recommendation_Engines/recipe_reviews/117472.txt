Very good recipe!  To make it a little easier, I added the rice, soy sauce and seasonings without removing the meat and veggies from the pan.  After the rice is warm, move everything to one side of the pan, then cook the eggs on the other side.  After the eggs are cooked, stir everything together.

This was my second attempt at fried rice (the first was 20 years ago and it didn't go well - I didn't remove the pan contents before throwing the egg in there to scramble so it was a mess, lol.)

Anyway, back to the review....I doubled the recipe for a family of 4 (2 adults/2 young kids; so if you're feeding teenagers, you may want to triple this recipe.)  I had a couple pork chops that had been grilled two nights before so I cut them up for this recipe.  I also used plain 'ole soy sauce cuz I love the stuff, but went "light" on the amount I used in the pan and just added on more once it was on my plate!  I bought a bag of frozen pea/carrot blend instead of fresh, threw in a handful of bean sprouts in lieu of broccoli, and everything else was the same.  Will definitely make again!  It was very good!

We loved this! I was looking for a cheaper recipe because my husband & I are kind of tight now. This was definately a keeper. It was not only cheap to make, but VERY good. Every night I ask my husband (we got married 3/29/08) how dinner was on a scale one to ten. He is always wonderful & loves everything I make, but he said he was never going to give a recipe a ten. He was going to save the ten for the recipe that was ASTOUNDING. This recipe got the 10. =) I add celery sometimes & we love the peas & carrots in it too.

This was pretty good.  I used leftover pork tenderloin and rice from last night.  I used a little more veggies and meat than called for.  Also, like another reviewer suggested, I left the meat/veggies in when I added the rice and sauce, pushed it aside when warm, and scrambled the egg before mixing it all together.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was excellent!  Who knew you could make such good fried rice at home??  I used sesame oil instead of the butter ... it just seemed more suited to an Asian dish.  I also left out the broccoli, but added more peas and carrots to make up for it.  Next time I may add baby corn and bamboo shoots.  Great recipe!

Loved it!  Yes we tweaked it:)  The recipe was set for 2 servings, so I changed it to 4 servings.  What we (husband and I) did was left out the broccoli and the peas (hubby is picky) only used 1 green onion and 3tbsp of canola oil instead of butter.  Also we used Basmati rice, 1/2 tsp of garlic pwdr, 1tbsp sesame oil and 1/2 tsp of salt.  Oh and we left everything in the wok as we cooked.  This was incredible and we already have made it several times!  Thank you Peggy!

This was far better than the take-out we have been getting.  YUM!!  I will definitely be making this for my husband & daughter again!

I made only minor modifications:
    * 1 (6 ounce) chicken tenderloin, cut into pieces
    * 1 cup frozen peas & carrots
    * 1 green onion, chopped
    * 2 tablespoon butter
    * 2 egg, beaten
    * 3 cup cold, cooked jasmine rice (was 1 cup uncooked)
    * ~2 Tbsp soy sauce
    * garlic powder (to taste)
    * ground ginger (to taste)

Very good! I left out the broccoli (personal preference) but kep everything else the same. I would like a little stronger flavor so next time I'll add maybe 1/4 more of the soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. Overall though, really nice. It got better as it sat. :)

We loved this recipe!  We had no broccoli or peas on hand but we substituted those for yellow bell peppers, celery and corn.  This will definitely be made again.  A great dish when you don't know what to make because most things are on hand.

This is a great starter recipe.  Lots of possibilites!  I used leftover pork loin and sauted in sesame oil as others have suggested.  I also used fresh ginger.  It was very good!

Along with everything else, I used frozen broccoli chops and some cooked but unseasoned pulled pork meat I had frozen. I pre-cooked the broccoli, peas and carrot shreds in the microwave. I guessed at the exact proportions making more than the recipe called for. Though it was good, even the recipe amounts seemed a bit heavy with the veggies (and mine with the pork as well) to the rice proportions. I guess homemade should be loaded. I covered this to keep warm in my cast iron skillet while I finished cooking other stuff and it seemed to steam more than be fried. Mine was very moist and pretty rich for fried rice. I blame my pork to some degree. The pulled Boston butt being a fattier meat than the loin would have been. As the recipe mentions it is good base recipe for chicken or shrimp too. However, restaurant style always seems drier, with more rice and only a few veggie accents. I would make this again but probably as an Aisan inspired, skillet entrée and not so much a sidedish. I know you can scale, but this recipe would be better written in family style or pot luck size proportions.

Delicious...I always add bean sprouts, the reason this recipe I gave it 4 stars, it really needs the bean sprouts.  They are one of my very favorite ingredients in fried rice.  I left out the broccoli and added green onions.  I also doubled the recipe.  I thought this made just enough for me and my husband with a little left over for a snack later.

This was a great way to use up leftovers! I used left over pork and left over brown rice.  I added red bell peppers and subbed sugar snap peas for the frozen peas.  I also added napa cabbage and added some sriricha at the end.  I also used fresh garlic and ginger.  Thanks for the great recipe

Wow, easier than I would have thought.  I used brown basmati rice, substituted a 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil for some of the butter, used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and replaced the broccoli with bean sprouts (which I would add at the end, with the rice, next time, since they do not really need to cook).  Great flavor!

My husband liked this better than our local chinese buffet and my kids ate it up!  All the ingredients in this one are perfect, however I cooked it the way I wanted and it turned out delicious.  I added lots of regular ground pepper.  No leftovers.

I've made this recipe several times, always using leftover pork roast.  Most of the time, I don't have the rice prepared ahead of time, and it still comes out great even with freshly cooked rice (I use jasmine rice).   I don't eat peas, so I pretty much put in whatever veggies I have laying around, which usually amounts to carrots, onions, celery, and cut up string beans.  Since I'm using already cooked pork, I just do the veggies first, push them to one side of the pan, cook the egg (which I personally like to add a little milk to, and I use 2 eggs because I like a lot of egg) on the other side of the pan, then when that is cooked, I just mix it all together with the the soy sauce, etc, and throw the pork in to warm it through.  This is so delicious my whole family can't eat it fast enough!

Great recipe, but I've never made fried rice I liked without using a bit of oyster sauce. Have no idea what's in it, (probably MSG) but it gives it that extra kick.

I love this recipe!  Because I hate broccoli I substitute chopped celery for the broccoli - other than that I make it as written.

This was delicious! I used leftover grilled pork loin cut into small cubes, about 1.5 cups of frozen peas & carrots, threw in some bean sprouts, and elminated the broccoli. I also used instant white rice (new mom, always in a hurry!) and it was quick & SUPER yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

Great way to use up your leftover Christmas ham. I boiled off the stray pieces from the ham bone and cut up the rest of the leftover ham to use in this recipe. The ham broth I used to cook the rice in for the fried rice. I used real garlic, carrots instead of peas and doubled the recipe. Out of the whole batch, a small bowl remains. Noms. I served this with Michelle's Roast Chicken.

this was fairly easy and quick and a nice way to use up the pork loin i had but it lacked some pazazz and i even added 3 cloves of minced garlic in the beginning saute part.  it also seemed a bit on the dry side.

FABULOUS!   I had leftover porkloin from the night before and it turned out to be the perfect dinner choice for it.  I didn't make any changes and my kids thought it was better than our local chinese restaurant.  THANK YOU!!!  It was SO easy it is definitely one of my new favorites

This is a great recipe! It does not need changing at all! I made it 2 weeks ago the same way as described, and tonight I used shrimp instead of pork, and used a bag of frozen peas and cut carrots along with the green onion. If you do this you may want to drain the shrimp mixture, as it tends to hold water if you used defrosted frozen cooked shrimp.  Thanks Peggy!

Awesome!  My fiance, who doesn't like "stir fry," really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe almost exactly - using fresh veggies instead of frozen, peapods instead of frozen peas, and a two-serving packet of Uncle Ben's 90 second brown whole grain rice.  I cut pork from pork chops, and it turned out A-OK. (Next time, I'll try shrimp!)  I thought that I would throw a bone to my fiance and pick up a jar of gravy.  The dish is good both with and without it.

I doubled this recipe and had to make several changes to make it tasty.  Added seasoned rice wine vinegar, fresh ginger, and garlic which HELPED A LOT..........I cooked rice and chilled it...used 3 eggs because I do like extra egg.  I was nervous because I didn't have low sodium soy sauce and I don't care for salt....Could have used more onion, but my husband liked it.  So I'd make again.  I didn't want porkchops and this was a different alternative when served with spring rolls.

This is a great recipe but I suggest using Chinese BBQ pork instead of pork loin if you want traditional pork fried rice.  It is available pre-cooked at any market.  Also, as other reviewers said, it is imperative that you use cold cooked rice or it will turn out very mushy.

This was alright for my first time making fried rice.  It seemed a little bland, so I added more soy sauce, which made it more flavorful.  I also substituted ham for the pork chops.  I'm thinking my problem was cooking the rice just before frying it.  Next time I will try and use day-old rice, as suggested by other reviewers.

Followed this recipe exactly except omitted the broccoli and it was good. I feel like it was missing something.... I would definitely make this again but maybe add some sesame oil or oyster sauce? Thanks though- it's a fantastic base recipe.

Fantastic flavor.  Like others, I doubled the recipe and used sesame oil in place of the butter.  I also  used fresh garlic and fresh ginger since I had some on hand.  My husband, who says he doesn't like Chinese food and would never eat it, loved this recipe.

I make this rice without the pork in it and usually double it to serve over several nights as a side dish.  Its great but sometimes the ginger is a bit much, so I use a bit less than called for, especially if I double the recipe. I also use a few more eggs than required to add more flavor.  Thanks!

Very good, perfect for two people. I did add a little sesame seed oil and minced garlic, but I thought all the ingredients were very proportional.

This was very good.  I did use leftover pork and I finely chopped the broccoli.  I used half of a white onion finely chopped since I didn't have green onions.  I also added a few cloves of garlic minced.  It seemed like a lot of meat and veggies for a little amount of rice, so I doubled the rice and then doubled the seasonings (soy sauce, ginger and garlic powder).  It was very tasty and can be adjusted in flavor to your taste with the seasonings.  Very easy as well.  It will definitely be something I'll make again with leftover chicken or pork.

Great recipe!!  I often do a pork tenderloin on Sunday evenings, and this is a quick & easy way to make use of the leftovers.  Everyone loved it!  I added 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper to spice it up and threw in a handfull of bean sprouts and cashews while cooking the veggies.  It's a keeper!

Its good to use day old rice too, if possible.

Wow! this was really yummy and very easy to make. The garlic and ginger went extremly well together. I did use less soy sauce and omitted the brocolli, it just did not seem to fit. Instead I added some celery, onion, and green pepper which seems more like what you would get at a resturant. I also made some sweet and sour sauce to mix in the whole thing and it was really good. This was so much better than what you would find in the freezer section of the grocery store. I actually made this for lunch with a left over pork chop from dinner the night before. It was a nice change from the sandwhiches I usually make. Great recipe, nice flavor.

I searched all the fried rice recipes before deciding on this one. I was not dissapointed. In fact, I was pleasantly suprised:) I even included the ginger which I'm not a fan of but it added a nice touch of flavor.The only things I did differently was I used more butter when frying which I did on my pancake grill..worked like a charm! I added bean sprouts also. When I combined all ingrediants, I fried on my pancake grill until golden brown....added green onions at the very end....so yummy! Thanks for a fried rice recipe I will use again,and I'm very picky!

We thought this was good.  It seemed a bit heavy on the soy sauce though.  If I make it again, I'll cut back on it a bit.

This recipe was just OK... rather bland. I'm sure I'll make it again, but will probably add teriyaki or oyster sauce to jazz it up.

A little bland.  Could use something extra. 
I think it would be good with some chopped fresh ginger root and chopped garlic instead of the powders if you have the extra time. I make a similar recipe: thai peanut chicken, they taste a lot alike so perhaps you could throw in some cayenne pepper to spice it up like that recipe.

Great way to use leftover pork! I thought it was great, but 5 year old didn't like it even though he loves fried rice when we get Chinese take-out. Go figure.

YUM...created this meal from leftovers...ham instead of pork loin.  Had some leftover spinach.  Added it to the recipe and voila!  Such a great dish created from what I had on hand.

I do not usually make oriental foods, but this one is easy to make, easy to adapt to what vegetables and meat already in the refrigerator and loved by all. This recipe has good flavors and is a good recipe to keep and make again.

This is a great fried rice! I found it searching for a way to stretch and use 2 leftover baked chicken breasts. What I love is that I had everything on hand, with an exception or two. No broccoli but a bag of mixed carrots, peas and corn worked just fine. I added a little more ginger, and fresh garlic and some sesame oil (which I think really gives the authentic flavor). The chicken had a kickin chicken spice on them and it was delicious and my husband was impressed!

Excellent recipe! I cut my pork into thin small strips (about 1 inch long) because I don't like big meaty chunks. I think this turns it into more of a perfect oriental side dish, but I will eat it by itself. I used a little bit of teriyaki sauce in place of just the soy (my teriyaki has sesame seeds) and I think that made a huge difference! Great recipe as is, or to personalize! Thanks!

This was a very good recipe!  I did use chicken instead of pork just because of our preference.  I also bought the bag of carrots and peas blend in the freezer section. This really was a convenience.  I let it simmer on low for a while so that the vegetables would be tender.  I dont like crunchy peas!

I used some leftover pork in this.  Even though it said it served two, We had plenty leftover, eating an egg roll on the side.  I will definitely make it again, trying different meats or even tofu.

I marinated the pork for about 1/2 hr in soy sauce, fresh ginger and fresh garlic.  I used a couple country style ribs, cut up.  It's the end of the gardening season so I cleaned out what was left in the garden and added it (Japanese eggplant, green pepper, red onion, brussel sprouts.)  I think any veg would be great in the recipe.  I like my food a bit more salty - so I needed a bit more salt.  It was great!

Wonderful, easy recipe.  I used pork chops because I didn't have pork loin, but it was still delicious.  I will use this recipe again.  I did make sure I used the cold rice and it turned out almost as good as the restaurant rice I get :)

very tasty! We didn't have any pork, so I substituted chicken breast and added frozen vegetables along with carrots and 3/4 of an onion. Omitted also  the ginger and the garlic power (hahaha, it sounds like another recipe altogether! Sorry). Still wonderful! Thank you!

So simple to make, messed up my rice twice before getting it right, that was the hardest part! I cut up boneless pork chops and used them in the skillet. Everyone had 3rds on this dish, we are all even eating it for lunch the following day!

This was absolutely the easiest recipe I have ever made!  Simple and straight forward perfect!  I used left over pork loin roast from sunday dinner and the veggies from that dinner as a hot topping over the rice. I didn't have any cold rice so I just made fresh rice and used that instead.  I also subsituted bacon grease for the butter.  basically I just a bunch of left overs and (well except rice) and watched it vanish.  Even my picky kids had thirds with the veggies! very good recipe Thank you!!!!

I thought this was really good. I used some leftover pork tenderloin and some of the cooking juices to make it even more flavorful.

This was great and super easy to make.  I did as others had suggested and just made everything in one skillet, pushing the other veggies aside to cook the egg.  I didn't have green onion so next time I think I'll saute regular onion in the mix, and I think I will cut the pork cubes up smaller.  It was a great side dish to our pork chops though and awesome served with roasted broccoli!

This by itself was just okay.  I made the recipe as is, only using bacon fat instead of butter.  In the end I found the dish to be really bland so I added some extra of all the spices & soy sauce, in addition to about a tsp of sugar.  After that I thought it was a solid 4 stars.

I gave this 5 Stars because I thought it was the best stir fry I ever made. I used some pork chops that Denny cut off a large Pork Loin; used frozen corn, green pepper, carrots and green beans from our garden; used fresh broccoli, onion, celery and garlic; used about 2T of chopped frozen Red Hot Chile Pepper, was very spicy, but yummy! Because I had so much food, I used more than double the cooked white rice and seasoning. Pushed veggies aside and cooked egg in pan like others said to do.

This was very good eventhough I made a mistake.  It calls for COLD cooked rice.  I didn't realize that until I was ready to stir in the rice.  The recipe had to sit while I cooked the rice and I used it warm.  It still tasted fantastic but I know it will be better next time.  This is a keeper

This is fantastic! I used some left over pork roast, left out the carrots and used some frozen veggie mix with peas, lima beans and threw in some corn niblets (frozen) I used Sesame oil to cook in, did the egg first and took it out and chopped it up after everything else was cooked and thew it back in. I also used real garlic and added some rice vinegar. I just added all the leftover rice we had and it was more than asked for but that didn't make a difference. Served with Stir-fied veggies and some vietnamese spring rolls a friends mom had made and it was the perfect chinese style meal with less sodium and a much cheaper price. Will definitely make again!

This was very easy to make and was surprisingly excellent!  I made it as directed except I ran out of soy sauce and substituted some teriyaki sauce, which was quite good.  I doubled the recipe and we ate so much it only fed 2 adults and an infant with about 1/2 serving left over!

Very good! I used some left over pork from the night before, cut it up and used it with the recipe. It tasted pretty much like restaraunt style pork fried rice, which is all my husband orders when we go out, so he approved:)

Easy recipe!  I adjusted it as Lisa Beth suggested.  I really wanted to use up what I had on hand, and didn't add bean sprouts but it would have been that much better.  I don't like spicy, but if you do the suggestions about adding cayenne or a spicy pepper makes sense.  I made it with shrimp, and sauteed jarred garlic and ginger in the butter before adding the first ingredients.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious! Like others I moved everything to one side, cooked the egg in the same pan, then mixed together. A perfect use for leftover rice that sure doesn't take like leftovers. Will also try with chicken and/or shrimp.

This was a big family hit.  SUPER easy.  Used leftover teriyaki pork ribs and a little green pepper instead of the broccoli.  We'll be making this often.
4x recipe fed the 10 of us with little left!

I made this a little bit easier by using a frozen bag of mixed veggies.  I also liked an extra egg or two and a teaspoon of oyster sauce. Otherwise a great recipe.

This was pretty good. I was baking pork chops when I found this recipe, so after I completed the rice I just added the pork chops to it. I think I would like this recipe better with the addition of another egg, and something to kick it up a bit. Thanks for sharing with us!

This was absolutely perfect!  It tasted just like it came from the restaurant (maybe even better!) and was very simple to make.  We didn't have to make any adjustments.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Thumbs up from the two picky eaters (hubby & son), so this is a keeper!

It's not bad.  A little bland.  Needs a hot pepper.  Otherwise, okay.
