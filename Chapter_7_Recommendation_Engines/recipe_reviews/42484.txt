I'm not much for microwave cooking so I cooked this on the stove and then put it in the oven to brown the onions on top.  It was very good.  Thanks.

Goodness! Even better for lunch the next day. It was very delicious. Instead of processed cheese spread, we used nacho cheese sauce and it was fantastic.

This was very easy.  I used a cup of cheddar/jack instead of recommended cheese.  It turned out fine. Like the onions on top.

Very good and fast side dish!  We all enjoyed this one! Made this with a broiled chicken dish also found on this site and dinner took me a total of 20 minutes...one in the oven and one in the microwave!  Didn't change a thing! Thanks T.O.H!!

This side dish was awesome and so easy.  I used the low fat cr. of chick soup, no onions or celery, fresh broccoli that I steamed and then I used a mix of shredded cheddar and mozz. cheese.  Loved the topping of the french fried onions and the fact that it was done so quick in the microwave.  I will make this again!

My family loved the recipe and it was polished off in no time.  I would definitely make it again.  I used Velvetta instead of the jarred cheese, but i don't think that altered the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

The mix of ingredients was great. A fast, weeknight dish that got veggies into my kids.  I used fresh broccoli (a bag of Broccoli Wokly) and a cup of Mexican Blend cheese.  I did not have instant rice either, so I cooked 3/4 cup of regular rice.  I cooked the bag of broccoli in the micro for 3 minutes, then added it to the can of soup, milk, pepper, cup of cheese and the cooked rice. My hubby won't eat onions so I crumbled a few Ritz crackers instead on top & threw it in the microwave for 5 minutes.

This was delicious.  The only change I made was I substituted 3 slices of American cheese instead of the cheese spread only because I didn't have it on hand.  It worked out fine.  I added a little more milk.  This is a keeper.  The next night I added some leftover chopped chicken and heated it up and had a toss salad.  YUMMM

Good stuff. Even my daughter who hates broccoli ate this and loved it. I didn't microwave, but instead used regular rice (not instant). I made the rice first. I sauted the onions and celery and mixed with the other ingredients in a sauce pan. Once sauce and rice were done I combined the two in a baking pan and added paprika, season salt, pepper, and french-fried onions and baked for 30 minutes at 350.  The onions toasted on top and I mixed it half way through and added more onions on top. We love onions. This was so good.

My family loved this. I made as directed up until I put the French-fried onions on, I finished it off that part in the oven. Other then that, the recipe worked great, I did do the 2nd step for 14 minutes and stirred the mixture in the bowl and put back in the mircowave for 6 more minutes because the rice on top was still crunchy. And that seemed to help it. Other then that, no complaints and there was only one serving left from the batch. Thanks very much.

Will definitely make again. Finished in the oven for 10 minutes at 350. Also used a stick of velveeta instead of the jar.

This was super easy! Made this for niece who thinks broccoli rice should be in a food group of its own!!  We used 3 cheese slices because she doesn't like cheese spread or velveeta and it worked out great.  I did need to add a little extra milk.  I made it as written first then added a little extra just to suit our tastes.  I will make this again!

I added almonds half way through the final cooking stages to add a little crunch to it. It was fantastic! I also used real cheese and not a spread, which had a sharp taste to it, and was healthier than a processed spread too!

My crew loved it! I had to make a few adjustments with what I had on hand: 1c+ shredded cheddar cheese (we love cheese), cream of celery soup and I omitted the onions and celery (didn't have).  It was a yummy change! Kids are 12, 6, and 3.. my 6 year old was suspicious, but he ate it up!

This is delicious! I have found that you can substitute 8 oz of velveeta and it still comes out great.

I thought it had way too strong of a rice taste. I used brown rice, which is all my mother had on hand, so maybe that's why. I'll try again w/white rice sometime and see if it's better.

Very good flavor.  Will make again but next time I will cook the rice as directed before putting in the dish.  It took so long in the microwave that our steaks were cold.  We also didn't care for the onion ring things on the top so we will completely omit them.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  It was so tasty and easy to prepare.  It is nice that it is cooked in the microwave and didn't heat up my kitchen.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.

Suprisingly yummy. My husband hates rice and he even liked it. I added lots of pepper.  My only concern is that it is not very healthy.

I love me some broccoli and this dish was great!!! I had this at one of those all-you-can-eat restaurant but theirs did not have the fried onions, but this taste just like it came from the restaurant.  The only thing I would do the next time is add more cheese.   I will definitely do this again, and this is a keeper.

made this with grilled lemon herb pork chops and it was delicious and easy (the perfect combination!)  Followed the recipe exactly except put it in the oven after topping with the onions to make sure they didn't get soggy.  Will definately make it again soon

Yummy, yummy.  I wanted something for those deadly fried onions and this did the trick.  I, too, used nacho cheese as I don't keep Cheez Whiz on hand.  I used less than called for (or more rice and broccoli) so it was thick but still good.

We loved this recipe!! The only things that I had to do differently was to used long grain rice because I didn't have any instant, therefore I added an extra cup of milk. It was nice and creamy and didn't dry out at all! I also stirred it frequently! Wunderbar!!!

I was a little worried about this one but, it turned out great. I used 8oz of velvetta cheese instead of the jar process. I didn't use the celery (only because I don't care for it). This was a quick, easy dish to make and went over very well at Thanksgiving. I was told I might have to go home and make some more of it!

Went to make this and found out I didn't have the cheese on hand and the only thing I could find at the store was a medium hot cheese jalapeno dip. The peppers gave it just a hint of spicyness that my family loved so it turned out to be a GR8 hit after all.
 You can also substitute cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken and it still is a tasty side dish

Awesome recipe!  I steamed the broccoli ahead of time like suggested.  The only thing I would change for next time is I used Velveeta cheese like someone else suggested and I felt like it came out too thick.  I will try using real cheese next time.  Other than that it still tasted great!

We used chopped, leftover wheat spaghetti & leftover cooked brown rice and Colby/Jack cheese instead of processed goop.  It was delightful.  I vamped it up to feed my 6 people family & used a honkin' can of cream of Chicken soup & doubled the other ingredients, except the cheese.  Microwaved it and then broiled it for a couple of minutes to get the onions crispy.  My husband forwent the broiled chicken breasts I made & said, "Just more of that broccoli stuff!"  Mmmm!!!  Kids oved it!  Four stars because the broccoli was a bit undone, too crunchy.
