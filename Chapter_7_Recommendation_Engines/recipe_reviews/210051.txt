This is delicious soup, but I did have to make some modifications. The recipe, as written, really doesn't call for enough liquid to cook the rice.  I both added liquid AND decreased the rice to one cup. I still needed to add more water before serving as it was no longer really soup. I also added several beef boullion cubes for more depth of flavor.  My stewed tomatoes were very large chunks, so I chopped them into small pieces. I was fresh out of caribou, so I used white-tailed deer venison (plentiful in my area). Thanks for a tasty recipe.

I wish I can give it two ratings, one for directions and the other for taste.
The directions are VERY POORLY written, I followed it to the "t" and ended up with a rice "glop."  And way too much rice.
The taste of the "glop" that supposed to be a soup was good.  Kind of remind me of what I had at home in the past.
I DIDN'T LIKE THE DIRECTIONS!!!

This was very good. I used caribou and bear. Used 1/2 naturally cultivated wild rice and 1/2 brown rice. Loved the earthy flavors with the wild game.
