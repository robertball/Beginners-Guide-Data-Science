Hmm, I did not care for this. I can see me loving something like this, if it was Depression Era time. It honestly, tasted like what it was water, sugar, and tart apple peels. Making homemade apple juice or cider can be done very easily with a small counter top juicer. It tastes so much better than the store if you have not tried it. Plus, it is just pure apples. The whole point of apple juice, if it is good, is it doesn't need any sugar. I just thought I would test this recipe because I had some peels and apple cores from an apple tart recipe. I guess my apple scraps will continue to go into the compost pile as usual.

This is a great idea to use up the bits you would otherwise waste and I suspect that the apple variety used makes a huge difference, but I used the cores and peels from 4 pink lady apples in 4 cups of water and it tasted quite insipid after an hour of simmering and definitely didn't need any sugar.  I ended up leaving the pot to sit overnight and it was like slightly diluted juice in the morning.  I'll make this again, but with a higher ratio of peel to water for a really appple-ey flavour.

The concept of this recipe is great, especially because I hate waste and it gives me an opportunity to use up all the scraps from apple pies, etc BUT we did find it to be a bit sweet so what I did was add some lemon juice to bring down that sweetness a bit. Of course that may have just been because of the apples I was using (red delicious) and will vary from apple to apple and time of the year. Ours also got a much rosier color than that of the one displayed in the picture which was very pretty in our pitcher at our fall party. ;) Hope this helps!

I made this & it was absolutely amazing! I used the peels & deseeded  cores from 4 Suncrisps (yellow) & 2 Honeycrisps (red) apples. I did the 5 cups of water & reduced the sugar to about 1/4 cup (as these apples tend to be very sweet already).  I cooked the peels & cores on high for about 45 mins & then strained everything from the juice several times in order to get the juice as pure as possible. Then I added the sugar and mixed until dissolved & let it sit for about 10-15 minutes to cool.  I then poured over ice & served it to my family who all loved it as much as I did! We do the whole apple picking thing every year as a family & I make homemade applesauce & pies & usually throw all the cores & peels away....well no more! Going forward I will be using them to make this delicious apple juice for my family! ????

I made mine a bit different than this recipie called for. I just cut all my little apples up and threw them into a boiling pot of water. I used little apples my mother in law gave me from her apple trees. Unfortunately It took much longer to boil than expected, and it only made a little bit of actual juice. Wasn't really worth the whole Hassel haha. But it was fun to try out. I diddnt add any surgar to mine either. luckily my little batch was pretty sweet without surgar.

Apple juice is not only delicious; it also offers you a great selection of different health benefits. Green apple juice benefits have been discussed in various texts however the fact remains that many of us donâ€™t add these to the daily diets as directed. Really fresh kind of a juice, the green elements causes it to be feeling like a salad juice, very good like a morning juice.

I loved it! Kids loved it! The only things I changed: 1) I lowered amount of sugar which I do with store bought juice by watering it down anyway. Kids are used to not so sweet juice. 2) I drained (filtered) the grainy apple and sugar particles. This made the juice I served the kids completely liquid free of any bits of anything. It comes out white at first,  but if you let it sit , it eventually gets darker in color due to oxygenation, just like a normal apple would. Still delicious! Thank you for the recipe !!!
