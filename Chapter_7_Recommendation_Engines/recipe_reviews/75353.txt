Great recipe!  My husband and kids gobbled them right up.  I made a couple adjustments - substituted blueberry applesauce for the vegetable oil and saved a ton of calories.  I also used 2 egg whites instead of the egg.  I will definitely make these again!

Great muffin recipe.  I omitted the wheat germ and added 1/4 cup of oatmeal.

My family really enjoyed!

Excellent recipe.  I substituted Splenda baking for the sugar and used applesauce for half of the oil and it tasted delicious.  Super moist.

I used half strawberry/half rhubarb in this recipe as that's what I had on hand. I only used a tsp. of baking powder and I added vanilla. They smell wonderful. I plan on baking them now and letting them sit out until breakfast tomorrow. Oatmeal muffins always taste better the next day.

I love this recipe. I use all whole wheat flour, brown sugar, pecans instead of walnuts, skim milk, 50% reduced fat becel margarine instead of oil and I throw in some cinnamon/allspice into the batter and omit the brown sugar oat topping. This is my new favorite muffin recipe for sure.

These muffins were great.  I used old fashioned oats,  replaced half of the oil with banana mixed berry baby food and used half whole wheat flour.  The result was a very tasty muffin.  Thanks for the recommendation Dish!!

I used a bag of frozen mixed berries, and substituted in 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  Otherwise made as written, and they were great!  My daughter needed snacks for her dance rehersals, and these gave her the energy to keep on her toes!

I have made these twice now and our family really loves them.  I used applesauce for 1/2 the oil and omitted the crumb topping.  I love how healthy these are, a great alternative to the every-day blueberry muffins.

These muffins were a big hit in my family.  I made them according to the directions, but just swapped the oil for equal parts applasauce.  They were incredibly moist and filling.  Excellent for breakfast or snack time.  I liked that they have wheat germ in them and my kids that they tasted like a treat.  I would love to try them with whole wheat flour sometime to see if it alters the recipe significantly.  I used frozen blueberries and they worked perfect.

These are really good!  I used old-fashioned oats and half whole wheat pastry flour.  I also subbed half unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and used grapeseed oil.  Made these with blueberries we picked ourselves.  I cut the topping amount in half (thought it would be too much) and it was just perfect.  My 4-year old daughter loves these!  Check the muffins a few minutes early; mine were done when I checked 2 minutes early.

Very tasty muffins! I used organic coconut oil as it is healthy oil in place of vegetable oil and drizzled a bit on top of each muffin after I added the oat/cinnamon topping to hold the topping on a bit better...and it worked wonderfully!

Great recipe!  I expected a heavy and unappealing muffin based on the reviews, but it wasn't at all.  Muffins were light and the topping was delicious.  I used strawberries from our garden that I thawed from the freezer and added in.  The only change I made beside using strawberries was that I was out of walnuts so I substituted sunflower seeds.  I will absolutely make these again.

Delish! Used thawed blueberries (that we picked last summer and froze), made the flour a combo of 1/2 all-purpose white and 1/2 whole wheat, made the sugar a combo of 1/2 white and 1/2 brown, and made the oil a combo of 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 applesauce. Muffins were perfect consistency to spoon into the tins. I only had to bake mine 17 minutes and they were just right. I would definitely be sure to add the nuts (I used walnuts) just to add more texture, but that's just personal preference. Not super-sweet, but they tasted much better than just "healthy" even though they are! Looking forward to freezing most and then using them as quick breakfasts on the go!

I made a few changes.  Used half whole wheat flower, half AP.  Skipped the nuts.  Used 1/2 cup applesauce, plus 1/4 oil.  I doubled the blueberries & used frozen.  I skipped the topping.  I didn't have quick oats, so I soaked regular ones in the milk before using them.  I think this accounts for the chewy bits/spots in the muffins.  They also didn't need 20 minutes to cook.    The muffin texture is really nice and soft not heavy, even though they don't rise much.  The muffins are tart because of all the berries, and I'm glad I sprinkled raw sugar on the tops to balance it out some.  Next time I'll definitely make sure I have the quick oats.

Following others advice, used 1/2 wheat, 1/2 all puropose, 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil, omitting nuts & using strawberries (mashed 1/2 left 1/2 chunky). These muffins are outstanding!!  Especially with HONEY CINNAMON BUTTER also from this website!

These were just "okay", but I'm not giving up on them yet.  The topping made the muffin tops taste really good, but the muffin itself was very bland and a little dry.  I'm going to try them one more time, adding more sugar, some vanilla, and a little applesauce for moistness.

I made these yesterday and they were very good. I didn't have any wheat germ, so I used an additional 1/4 cup oatmeal in it's place. I had some huge blackberries in the freezer and added those to the muffins instead of blueberries. And I used pecans instead of the walnuts...personal preference. The topping is a nice added touch. They turned out beautiful and something that I would serve to guests at a brunch. I might try the batter in a 9X9 baking dish and serve as coffee cake drizzled with vanilla glaze. My husband LOVED these.  Next time I will try the recipe exactly as listed including the wheat germ. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Yummy!  I used 1 cup WW flour and 1/2 cup white flour, cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, used 1/3 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil, added slivered almonds and walnuts (did not have enough walnuts), and used fresh raspberries.  For topping, I mixed 1/3 cup oats, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tbsp lemon juice, mixed, and poured over the batter after divided into muffin tins.  The muffins turned out moist with a crunchy topping and not too sweet.  I had to bake them for at least 30 minutes at 400F.  The end result is a nearly 100% whole grain, low sugar, low fat delicious meal on the go or snack!

I love these muffins!  I used a cup of mixed frozen berries--yum!  Also made a few changes to the basic recipe:  halved the sugar, used equal amounts of all-purpose and whole-wheat flour, replaced half the oil with applesauce, and halved the amount of topping.  Delicious!

These muffins are great! I did make a few small changes though: 1. added 2 ripe mashed bananas  2. added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla  3. added brown sugar directly into the muffin mix  4. did not add streusel topping  5. used old fashioned oats instead of quick oats  6. omitted wheat germ (not a big fan of it) 7. added about 1/8 cup more of milk (batter seemed very dry at first) This recipe is a keeper and extremely adaptable for practically any fruit...not just blueberries. Will try again with strawberries and with apples. Thank you for a great recipe!

I was so excited to make these based on the great reviews but then so disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I ate 3 of them! But my family was so underwhelmed. My picky 12 yr old took one bite and wouldn't have any more. They were heavier and denser than I'd expected and I think that's the issue with kids. One note - I didn't use quick cooking oats, it might make a difference to use those instead of the regular. The flavor was great for me but with that response I won't make them again unfortunately.

This has been a wonderful breakfast muffin!  I add a whole cup of oats instead of the wheat germ.  Frozen fruit seems to work best as it seems to hold when mixed into the batter.  Because it asks for so much baking powder it is best to us a baking powder that doesn't have aluminum (like Rumford).  It makes a huge difference in the taste!  Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I put the nuts on top of the muffins instead of in the batter. It made a lot of topping, so I didn't use quite all of it. YUM! This is a really good recipe!

These are my favorite blueberry muffins and I have tried a bunch.  Instead of wheat germ I added extra oats and some flax seed meal.

I used white whole wheat flour, vanilla sugar, and 1/2 cup applesauce (reduced the oil to 1/4 cup. I accidentally forgot to put in any egg at all. But these came out beautifully! Very light and flavorful. I'll make sure I forget the egg the next time I make these.

Excellent!  I substituted ground flax for the wheat germ. Also added more blueberries the second time at the request of my daughter. I made a batch of these everyday for three days straight. Kids loved them so much, I could never keep enough around for lunches the next day!

yummy!  Substituted some applesauce for some of the oil, used mashed bananas and chopped apples since I didn't have any berries.

These were absolutely excellent! I did make a few modifications - I omitted the wheat germ, used brown sugar in place of white sugar, used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil, and used 2 egg whites in place of the whole egg.  These were very tasty - will make again!

I made these exactly as directed, and they came out wonderful!  I would dare say these are the best muffins I have ever had!  Next time, I might try cutting the sugar a little.  As I said, they tasted great as written, but I have been trying to cut sugar where I can.  Thank you for posting this recipe!!!

This is a great base oatmeal muffin recipe and you can really substitute any fruit for the berries.  I used sweetened dried cranberries and replaced the flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  I also used applesauce in place of oil.  Came out a little dense so I will probably add some oil next time but the muffins were delicious and hearty.

These did not turn out at all! I bake a LOT and don't get fussy about exact measurements...perhaps it finally caught up with me because I've never thrown out an entire batch of anything before!

These were awesome!! I followed the recipe as stated but used 2 cups of fresh blueberries. Even though these have wheat germ and oatmeal in them my family gobbled em up. A tasty treat that isn't so bad for you is a winner in my book!

Yummy! These are great. I added 1 tsp of vanilla. I didn't add the topping because the batter tasted really good on its own.

These are delicious!   Although, I changed the recipe so much that I can't even be sure they could be considered the same :)  I used 1 cup of oats and omitted the wheat germ, used raspberries instead of blueberries and sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  Instead of vegetable oil I used 1/4 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of unsweetened organic applesauce.  Oh, and I used whole wheat flour.  Deeeeeelish!

Delicious! I used steel cut oats, which give a nice texture, and subbed apple sauce instead of oil. I cut down on the sugar, I could easily have halved it. They are not only yummy, but super quick to make as well. I will definitely make these again!

These muffins were extremely good! Upon making the recipe i realized i did not have quick cookies oats so i used steel cut oats. I wasn't sure how they would work since they have a slightly different look and texture but they worked out perfectly and added lots of fiber to the recipe! I used frozen mixed berries instead of just blueberries and 3/4 applesauce and vanilla fat free yogurt and 1/4 cup of olive oil. Instead of oats in the topping i used granola. I will definetely make these again!

I just made these muffins and they were sooo easy to make. I used a 2 cup measuring cup to mix the milk, oil, egg and I added 1tbsp vanilla and mixed it up before adding to the dry mix. I also added 3/4 cup frozen blueberries and 1/2 cup fresh strawberries. I like alot of berries in my muffins. I think after tasting them I might add some bananas to it next time to add a little more sweetness. Both my girls like them as well, there a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy and healthy! Just a few changes: I used all whole wheat flour and old fashioned oats.  They turned out great!  I may omit the topping next time... not really needed.  I will definitely make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

Used whole wheat flour and oat bran for the wheat germ. I also cut down the oil by half and used 1/4 cup pumpkin puree. Added some raspberries to the blueberries. Moist delicious muffins.

Amazing!! I followed some other reviewers and swapped wheat germ out for more rolled oats, sugar out for brown sugar, and applesauce for vegetable oil. I also used whole wheat flour for a cup of the all-purpose flour. Finally, I added about a 1/4 tsp of both lemon zest and vanilla essence. I didn't have any blueberries so I used frozen mixed berries and crushed them first with the back of a cup measure to make the strawberries smaller. The result was incredibly sweet and delicious muffins appropriate for feeding to my one year old! In fact, I'll probably eliminate the sugar altogether next time because the fruit makes it so sweet! These won't sit around long in my house...

I really like this muffin. I took the suggestion of other reviews and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I didn't have everything but I used what I had on hand. Next time I will cut a little butter into the topping to get it to caramelize a little more.

The taste was all there, but I would make some tweaks to cut down on calories.  I cut the flour down to 1 cup, the sugar to 1/4 cup, and the oil down to 1/4 cup.  I did not use the topping it suggested.  I ended up with 11 muffins, so I just filled the last cup 3/4 full with water, which kept them moist while they were in the oven.

I make a very similar muffin to this one on a regular basis.  I do like this recipe but find that soaking the oatmeal in the milk for about 20 mins. gives a moister texture.   Other than the above no problem.

Overall a good recipe. Used fresh raspberries and got a nice, tasty muffin. I do agree with some other reviewers that the topping was the best part of the overall taste. Will try again and make some of my own refinements.

Very nice muffins.  I made 6 jumbo muffins with this and baked for 30 mins; there really isn't  a ton of batter to make more muffins.  I believe the submitter who says it only makes 12 muffins!  I left out the walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe, and these turn out to be a hearty, blueberry muffin with more substance than most.  Hubs and I both liked them.  Thanks for the recipe!

The batter was the perfect amount for 12 muffins, but the topping was much more than needed. You can definitely use less than half of what's in the recipe for the topping and there will still be some leftover.

Delicious!  I added a 1/4 cup of flax seeds, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup of water and decreased the baking powder to 1 tsp.  I put coconut on top with a few almonds.  Coconut and almonds got toasted while baking and they were really good.

These were just okay.  I used fresh raspberries and followed the recipe exactly.  The topping was dry and made a mess, I should have added some butter to it.  All in all, they were edible, but I will not be making these again.

I made this just as written, with the exception of using frozen raspberries that had been defrosted and drained.  They turned out amazing!  Will definitely be making again!

Great recipe! Very moist! I tweaked it a bit to make it just a bit healthier.  I substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour. I decreased the white sugar to 1/4 c and added 1/4 cup agave nectar (Madhava brand). I used grapeseed oil for the oil. I omitted the sugar topping.

My husband and 4 year old son love these muffins. I substituted whole wheat flour the second time I made them and didn't even notice the difference. These are a delicious wholegrain alternative. Yum! Another plus - one muffin kept me full until lunch time!

I made these march 5th 2010. I left out the wheat germ but didn't substitute anything. They lacked structure and crumbled out of the pan and into a bowl. On some muffins I left off the struesil and liked them better. Overall good texture and flavor.

These were very good. Served them at a brunch on Christmas Eve day. Did not have wheat germ - subbed ground flax seed. Worked beautifully. Will make again.

Loved these. The only change I made was to substitute whole wheat flour for the wheat germ, as I had no wheat germ. I thought they were so healthy tasting. Loved the combo of ingredients.

These were just okay. I think next time I'll skip the oatmeal part of the topping and just do the brown sugar and cinnamon. These also didn't raise very well. They just kinda stayed flat and low in the muffin cups. The flavor was okay...nothing to get excited over. I like that this is such a healthy recipe (I substituted plain yogurt for the oil making it even healthier) but I just didn't like how it came out.

Delicious! Made a few small substitutions, but followed recipe pretty closely. Subbed 1 cup of whole wheat flour & 1/2 applesauce. Left out the walnuts 'cause I'm not a big fan. Also, baked for only 17 minutes. Thanks for sharing!

These muffins turned out pretty well. They were a bit messy, but tasted pretty good. They needed some brown sugar IN the muffins, the muffins themselves are slightly bland; they just need some sweetning. Other than that they were great and I will make them again!!!

I don't know what I did wrong with this recipe but the muffins turned out very dense (yes I added baking powder). I did add a bit more oatmeal, so maybe that was the problem?? Also I apparently didn't prepare the muffin cups properly because the muffins really stuck to the cups. I'm not sure that I will attempt them again. I didn't want to rate the recipe bad because I believe it was "operator error", not the recipe ; )~

I used 1/4 cup oil and 1 ripe banana also 1/2 cup off orange juice. I used extra oats in place of wheat germ and I made mine with frozen blueberries. I had no problems with this reciepe. It was super easy and they are very delicious.

These are terrific!  I made them into 6 jumbo muffins and next time will reduce the heat to 350 as the have to bake longer.  I also put in more than 1 cup of fruit, probably about 1 and a half.  I used half fresh blueberries and half fresh strawberries.  Once they were done in the oven I put some raspberry jam in a piping bag, inserted the tip into the center and squeezed some filling in.  They taste like Tim Hortons Fruit Explosion muffins.  Wonderful!!!!

The muffin is good, I'm not a fan of the topping. It made it too dry and was REALY messy for eating. Next time I'll just leave it off. Otherwise, yum.

I really loved this recipe! I actually substituted oat bran for the wheat germ because I didn't have any on hand, substituted a half cup of whole wheat flour rather than all white flour, added about a teaspoon of orange peal, substituted craisins for the blueberries,  and added a dash of cinnamon. I still put a little cinnamon sugar on top too. It was excellent!!

Great Recipe. I made this because I was looking for a muffin recipe that used wheat germ and other things I had on hand. I did adapt it a little based on what I had on hand. I omitted the walnuts (didn't have any), and used raisins instead of blueberries. I used a mixture of AP flour and Bread Machine flour instead of only AP, because I didn't have enough. I also used 1/2 plain applesauce instead of the oil. This is a great base recipe for a muffin. I think any type of dried, fresh or frozen fruit would work well. Just dice up about 1 cup of the fruit. If it sounds like it would be good in a muffin, then it would probably be good in this recipe! The only negative thing I have to say is about the streusel topping. First of all, you could probably  cut the measurements in half, because I sprinkled A LOT on each muffin and still had a lot left over. And also, because there is no butter or other binding agent in the topping, a lot of it fell off the muffins after baking. Maybe stirring some melted butter into the topping would help it stick better. But the topping did make the muffins look pretty. Thank you for the great recipe. My two little ones are muffin lovers and they get so excited when I make muffins!

Really delicious recipe.  I did make changes, but only because of what I had on hand.  I used oat bran instead of wheat germ, and instead of milk I used a combo of vanilla yogurt and soy milk.  I also used a little less sugar in the batter and more raspberries, and I used a combo of wheat and white flours.    I also added some butter to the topping to make it stick better.    Will defintely make these again - have great texture and really nice taste.

Other than substituting half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce, I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. My muffins turned out moist and delicious and my family loved them too! Thank you for a new breakfast recipe.

Made these this morning for brunch with fairly minimal changes to the recipe.  
- substituted Truvia baking blend for the sugar in the muffin batter, but used sugar in the topping.  
-  used half all-purpose and half whole wheat flour.
- mistakenly thought we had no walnuts, so used pecans.

All of us thought they were extremely yummy.


Note for next time -- I will make only half of the topping recipe, as I used VERY generous sprinkling on the muffins, and we still have quite a bag of leftover for whatever use we can find this week.

Very good. i will make again. I used almond flour instead of wheat germ andused  old fashioned whole oats, and coconut oil instead of other oil. It was pretty dense and putting in pan, I kind of doubted it. And they are dense and good. I used frozen berries and did not defrost, I didn't know what would be better, soggy or cold. Thx to the person who suggested this recipe in her review of a  similiar recipe. I agree the crispy outside and soft inside is good.

These were very “healthy” tasting muffins. The recipe worked well and would be great for something you might eat on a daily basis but definitely throws you for a loop on taste if you’re expecting a sweet breakfast item. I think this would be a 4-5 star recipe if listed/presented as a healthy muffin alternative but fell short of expectations for standard muffins.

I added chia and flax powder for wheat germ and used one cup of blueberries, strawberries and pear mixture for blueberries.cooking in convection over so shorted time by 2 minutes.  Also used silicone cupcake wrappers.  Very tasty.  Might add a tad of meted butter in topping next time as was quite crumbly but otherwise delicious.

I made exactly according to the recipe. Very delicious.  Only reason for 4 stars is that I would have liked them to be more moist but I'll still make them again.  And next time I'll add a little butter to the crumb topping so it sticks better.

Made it. My second time making muffin. I didn't use wheat germ (I just heard that ingredient here) and I'm not really sure I use the same cooking oat. Don't do sprinkle at last step, maybe later should do to make it more pretty. It taste good?? I guess??

4.29.17  Never, ever did I think I'd be saying this, but I think they need just a bit more sweetness.  I did run out of quick cooking oats, so I had to substitute old fashioned oats for part of this recipe, but the texture of the muffin was light and just about perfect.  I did try to lighten the recipe a bit by using Egg Beaters® and Truvia® Baking Blend (maybe that had something to do with the sweetness mentioned earlier), and I think these subs worked OK.  Had some blackberries in the fridge that I bought on sale last week, so I used them for the muffins.  This was a yummy Saturday morning breakfast, and I definitely would make again.

Applesauce for oil (I ran out) and soy milk for cows (I'm dairy free). Frozen berries because that's what I had on hand. Very moist!

I subbed Greek vanilla yogurt for the oil - I personally like the flavour a lot but otherwise this recipe is below average...quite bland ever tho I added cinnamon to the batter.

Yummy muffins!! My husband raved about these muffins and just kept eating them. I didn't have any wheat germ so I used 1 cup of oatmeal instead of 3/4 cup. I also substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil. This gives it a little coconut flavor, which we love.

These muffins are a keeper for something different, with oatmeal and wheat germ. I did as others stated put 2 tbls. butter in the topping, gave it a crunch and kept it together. Did the applesauce and put raspberries in them so put little more milk ( which I did silk) so the berries would not crush, for the batter was a little thick . Turned out very good thanks for the good eats.

These are good.  I used 1 cup of oats and no wheat germ.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil.  Didn't want to chop nuts so threw in some dried cranberries.  Only problem I had was that I used cupcake liners and they stuck to the paper.  The second batch I sprayed the liners with Pam.  Haven't tried getting them out yet.

These were very bland to us. I try to make my muffins on the healthier side, so I substituted whole wheat flour for the AP flour, applesauce for oil and bran for the wheat germ.  They were ok, but we're very tough and had very little sweetness.

This recipe deserves a review! Easy and delicious! I was out of wheat germ so I substituted ground flax meal. Also, instead of the oil listed I used half apple sauce and half coconut oil. The topping is a must!

Super healthy, but turned out pretty dry & not sweet enough. Perhaps will try again with more sugar for  breakfast or snack.

I made some substitutes and still had tasty results. I added a toddler pouch because I ran out of apple sauce. It was a purée of carrot, apple, sweet potato and cinnamon so I think it added flavor. I used steel cut oats and raw sugar. The berries was a mixed bag of frozen berries thawed but I did measure.

No wheat germ and I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat plus used pecans for the nuts.

These were wonderful.  Went to the farmers market this weekend and had a c. of wild raspberries and 1/2 blueberries.  Used 1/2c. wheat flour, other than that exactly the same! Yum

Made once exactly like recipe, turned out good but was curious to try the changes recommended.  So, the next time I subbed apple sauce for oil, less sugar  and frozen mixed (blueberry and strawberry) berries. Added bit of vanilla,  2 Tbsp ground flax instead of germ, and added a Tbsp of chia seeds.  So awesome---- best ever.

Delicious.  I made only a few changes.  I didn't have wheat germ so I used a full cup of oatmeal as another user suggested.  I used a bag of frozen berries from trader joes (very cherry blend) and they turned out great.  My only suggestion would be that if you use these berries to chop them into smaller pieces and let them thaw first.  They made the batter REALLY cold and I had to extend the baking time because of it.  

A few people said they left off the topping, but I would suggest using it.  It really makes them look beautiful.

Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I changed the 1/2 cup oil for 1/2 cup of applesauce instead.  Used frozen blueberries (not thawed). Did not add walnuts because I don't like them. Result - very good.  Very very good.

Yum. Because of what I had on hand, I used a bag of frozen mixed berries, and a smashed banana to replace some of the oil. Made a great breakfast-to-go that the kids loved.

Turned this into a loaf instead of muffins, and it was SO GOOD!  I had to turn the temperature down to 350 but that may just be for a loaf.  
I was out of wheat germ so I used flaxseed meal instead, and I don't think that changed the flavor much.  I also used whole wheat flour because that's all we ever use.  My 8-year-old and 2-year-old loved it, my husband and I loved it, and I love that it's so healthy with the smaller amount of sugar and the whole grains :D

I made a version of this recipe today, to freeze for an upcoming bazaar. I didn't have blueberries, so I used frozen raspberries. I didn't have wheat germ, so I used ground flax seed, (that could easily be an optional item). The topping really makes these , not too sweet, muffins, outstanding.  I made a double batch and ended up with 22 muffins. This is definitely a keeper! Hopefully they will freeze well.  They were nice and moist, delicious!

These were DELICIOUS! I used blueberry pie filling and cut back on the sugar. They made the muffins a greenish color, but the taste was amazing. We like our oatmeal a little finer, so I either give it a chop or pop it in a blender/food processor. Yum Yum Yum...

These muffins were so easy to make my toddler and I whipped them out in less than 5 minutes.  Unfortunately they didn't have much flavor.  I will make them again, but will add vanilla and cinnamon (or lemon zest)to the muffin batter.  The topping was good, but didn't stick to the muffins very well after baking.  Think I'll press down on the topping before baking next time. They have the potential to be great...with some tweaking.

I thought this was good, but I also made some edits. I omitted the wheat germ and in place used wheat bran. I omitted the oil and in place used applesauce and 1/2 smashed banana. I baked 30 minutes in convection oven (perfect time) using my silpat muffin pan. Muffin was moist. The topping was yummy (my kids will probably eat the topping first, and if the blueberries were not baked inside the muffin, they'd probably leave the rest). Might try again.

Very tasty! I made a few modifications by using coconut oil rather than vegetable oil; almond milk instead of regular milk; ground oatmeal instead of wheat germ; pecans instead of walnuts; and a mix of blueberries and raspberries. Family enjoyed them! This is a keeper!

I just made these and they are delish!
I did make a few changes: I never had any reg sugar so I used brown sugar (which I like more with oatmeal anyways). I also never had blueberries so I used frozen raspberries (which I like more also :) to Finally, I omitted the topping to make them a little healthier and they were still plenty sweet!
I will def make these again and probably with my substitutions :)

I did not have wheat germ, so I used an additional 1/4 c. oats as a substitute. I also did not have regular milk, so I substituted evaporated milk and water (half of each). The muffins came out just okay and I do not believe it has anything to do with the substitutions I made as they wouldn't affect the flavor. They were rather plain and dry.
20 min at 400 degrees is way too long. I baked for 17 min and they were still dry. The topping crumbled off the tops of the muffins. I don't think I would make this recipe again.

Excellent recipe! Perfect texture and moisture..substituted wheat germ for oatmeal,  used mixed frozen berries, also a great trick I used was taking a squeeze pack of Mott's strawberry applesauce in the same measuring cup as the vegetable oil to measure 1/2 cup.

These are not very sweet and quite filling for a muffin, but kind of blah and lacking much flavor.  I used chopped almonds instead of walnuts and all quick oats because I don't have wheat germ and didn't do the topping.  My kids loved them.I added vanilla as well and they still didn't have to much flavor.  I used freshly picked blueberries.  I didn't change the oil or anything for something healthier like I usually do and they still need some help somehow.  I won't give  up on it and will try again with the topping.  Maybe that is what it needs, but how I made them this time, I wasn't super impressed.

I did not like the taste, it was like cardboard.  I followed the recipe as it was written with the exception of substituting the applesauce for the oil.

Wish I had read past the first page of reviews bec I agree with many that rated it 3*s - this was just ok.  I substituted apple sauce for oil as many suggested and used strawberries in lieu of walnuts bec of nut allergies in my household.  The wheat germ gave it a nice texture, but they were pretty bland overall, especially if you didn't come across a bite of fruit or 'streusel'.  With all the many excellent healthy muffin recipes on this site, I won't be making this again.

I made quite a few changes to this recipe, based on the ingredients I had on hand. Since I didn't have wheat germ I used a whole cup of oats, a little less than half a cup of sugar, and swapped oil for applesauce. I also used mixed frozen berries (raspberries, blackberries, blueberries) and heated them up in the microwave for about 45 seconds beforehand.  Rather than mixing in the walnuts, I saved them to put on top prior to baking, and it turned out very pretty. My boyfriend and I could both do without the crumb topping, as it was a bit overkill. Overall though they are very tasty, just be careful not to overmix or they will be dense!

These were just okay.  I think the topping definitely needs to be cut in half.  They just seemed bland to me, especially if you got a bit that didn't have any fruit in it.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I altered the recipe, and I think it would have been pretty ordinary if I hadn't. I add 2 tsp vanilla, reduced the oil to 1/3 cup, added 1 shredded/peeled apple, used an extra 1/4 cup walnuts, and a generous shake of cinnamon. To make them more healthy, I used evaporated cane sugar instead of refined sugar, and omitted the topping. These are particularly fantastic while they are still warm. Great recipe.

Delicious muffins! Made with fresh blackberries picked in my yard. Recipe yielded 15 muffins for me. Omitted nuts, used 1/2 cup organic applesauce in place of oil, as other reviewers suggested. You don't need *nearly* as much topping as listed...I suggest 2T each of oats & brown sugar. Just a light sprinkle will do. Thanks! Will definitely make again.

The crumb of the muffin was good; they rose nicely. Honestly not that impressed with the overall flavor of the muffins. Will search for a different recipe next time.

good recipe. i made it into a loaf instead of muffins. i would have preferred a little more sweetness...so next time i might add some more sugar. and instead of one berry..i added a cup of frozen mixed berries and it turned out nice. i did not have wheat germ and used muesli just for more texture and goodness. the texture was very soft...maybe a little too much but it was still tasty.

A little bland for my liking but it is a good recipe. Next time I will add cinnamon to the batter too not just on top. And watch a little closer I think I over cooked a bit.

I made this recipe with a few small changes - I used 1 c. all-purpose flour and 1/2 c. oat flour, 1/3 c. applesauce and 1/8 c. vegetable oil, and baked for 22 minutes.  My husband and kids devoured them!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These muffins are superb!  I was really impressed at how good these tasted.  I didn't have any walnuts so I subbed half whole wheat flour and added a couple of tbsps of ground flax.  I also used applesauce instead of oil.  If you want an everyday healthy muffin these fit the bill. (if you want to treat yourself "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" are great).

Good recipe....even better with a few changes to make it more healthy...used whole wheat flour instead or white and use applesauce instead of oil...they become lower fat without lowering the taste!

This recipe was amazing.  I did have to make changes because I am allergic to walnuts so I didn't put them in.  Also I am allergic to egg so I put in 1/4 cup of applesauce instead.  I didn't have any wheatgerm so I took anothers advice and put in oats instead.  I also substituted drained canned peaches cut in chunks instead of berries also because of allergy. These are THE BEST oatmeal muffins ever!!  THANK YOU!!

These were excellent muffins.  The only caveat was that they fell apart easily when eating them but that could have been do to my modifications.  They were definitely moist and delicious however.  I used 3/4 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup bread flour instead of 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, subbed 1/2 cup ground almonds for walnuts.  Kids and mom loved them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent muffins! I omitted the nuts, and frozen wild blueberries versus fresh, and they worked great. I also pressed the topping into the muffins before cooking - as  others suggested. I wrapped them individually in plastic wrap to send in care packages, which helped the topping stay on. Thanks again!

Good muffins.  Only thing I changed was I didn't add the nuts.  The topping didn't add anything, and it didn't stay on very well.  Next time I may just use a regular strusel topping or none at all

Good but nothing really special. I did use 1/2 cup of wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour. I would definitely recommend using fresh instead of frozen blueberries. I thought they were a tad sweet as well. Just personal taste. Did not finish them.

The taste is a 5,but the topping is a 1.  The topping does not stay on the muffin, probably due to the fact that there is no butter in the topping. Eating them is a crumbly mess. I halved the recipe (used 1 egg) and using a 1/3 cup measure, got 4 jumbo muffins. These are good enough to make again, but only if adding butter to topping mix.

Very good muffins.  I skipped the walnuts and used Craisins instead.  I doubled the recipe except for the topping ingredients.  There was easily enough topping for 24 muffins.  Will make again!

This recipe was a hit with one of my singing groups. I made it with raspberries and we had them for our break. Several people took home some of the extras for their breakfast the next day.

They were a little drier than I expected, but still quite good.
