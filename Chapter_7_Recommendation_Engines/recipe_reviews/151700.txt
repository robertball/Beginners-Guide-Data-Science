This is a great creamy beer cheese soup that can be customized to anyone's liking.  Sometimes we top this soup with cheese, sour cream and bacon.  Other times with cheese, pico de gio, and green onions.  NOTE:  There is an error in the recipe.  It says 1/4 cup cornstarch and I believe it was meant to be a 1/4 teaspoon.  Past that, it is a great recipe we have and will continue to make.  Thanks stopping the years of searching for our perfect cheese soup recipe!

Followed the recipe with the only change being a substitution of evaporated milk for the half and half (a substitution I make frequently).  We couldn't eat it.  I tried to doctor it up to make it edible for us and only ended up wasting more ingredients.

Very easy to make with little mess in the kitchen.  Needed a little more zing, so I added a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Really nice!

This was super simple and I enjoyed it. I did however think it needed a little something more and so I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and that did the trick. I think this would be even better topped with some bacon and green onions but all I had was red and yellow bell pepper. Go Chiefs ;)

Followed the directions, and the soup turned out great!
Not a huge beer flavor, so next time I will be going with a more pronounced beer instead of a can of macro beer-water.

For those of you that have difficulty with this recipe, follow it. Don't sub ingredients, and watch the temperature. You can't just throw everything in and hope it turns out.
