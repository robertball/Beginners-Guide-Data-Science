Rice is not kosher  for Passover for most American Jews, who are Ashkenazi (Eastern-Euopean/German descent).  Only Sephardim (Spanish/Middle Eastern) Jews are permitted to eat rice on Passover.  This recipe sounds good for after Pesach!

This sound soooo good. I am not Jewish, but love matzo ball soup and this looks like a real winner. Thanks for sharing this recipe!
