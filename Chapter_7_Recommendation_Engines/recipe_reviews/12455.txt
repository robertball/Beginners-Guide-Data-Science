This was fabulous.  I made 4 because I has so much zucchini.  I gave 3 away.  Everyone raved!  I got 12 out of 10 for the pie.  I modified it by adding 6 cups zucchini and doing a streusel topping instead of a second pie crust.  The streusel topping is 1/2 c. butter, 3/4 c. four, 3/4 c. rolled oats, 1/2 c. br. sugar and 1 tbls cinnamon.  Mix until crumbly.  Follow baking instruction.  Magnificent! I will make this again and again!  Thanks for yet another wonderful zucchini recipe!

This tastes just like apple pie!  I tried skipping cooking the zucchini as another rater mentioned, but I will definitely cook them next time to get the texture right.  I also used a crumb topping from another recipe and it turned out great.  We'll be using this often since I have so many zucchini from my garden this year.  And, I'm guessing I can put the pie together and freeze it to bake later, so I'll try that next.  Thanks for a great recipe that uses a lot of zucchini!

So awesome. It was kind of freaky sitting there eating a pie that I KNEW was zucchini, but tasted just like apple pie! My four year old insisted that they "turned into apples." :) I used the crumb topping from an earlier review, because I like apple pie with crumb top crust. Y-U-M-M-Y!

1ST RECIPE I HAVE RATED -  EVEN THO I HAVE TRIED OVER 100 "AR" RECIPES.  USED 1CUP MINUS 2 TABLESPOONS SPLENDA INSTEAD OF SUGAR...ALSO USED 6-7 CUPS ZUCCHINI. ALL ELSE AS WRITTEN.  USED HUSBAND (DIABETIC), GRAND-KIDS, GREAT GRAND-KIDS, NEIGHBORS, AS TASTE TESTERS AND NONE KNEW IT WASN'T "REAL" APPLE PIE. NO ONE WAS MORE SURPRISED  THAN I AT THE EXCELLENT FLAVOR. ADDED BONUS WAS HOW WELL IT HELD TOGETHER AND CUT INTO PIE PORTIONS WITHOUT BEING RUNNY OR FALLING APART.  P.S..cut  the zucchini long ways, then slice (not cube) so the slices even LOOK like apple slices.

Oh. My. Lord. Seriously unbelievable. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO TRY THIS RECIPE!!! Better than any apple pie or chocolate pie or berry pie I've ever had. Used French Pastry recipe for bottom crust and suggested crumble topping for top crust. Wow. Im still stunned by the result.

This recipe is great. Yup, just like apples. I didn't bother boiling the zucchini and it still came out great and saved a step. I did add a little extra flour as the first time I made it it was a little runny but it wasn't runny as soon as it cooled completely. I also added more zucchini for a fuller pie. An EXCELLENT way to use up zucchini

I am not the world's best pie baker, but even I managed to come up with something that tasted good with this recipe!  I also love "forgiving" recipes, and this one is.... I started the zucchini before I went to get the recipe, and never seeded them - just peeled and sliced!  Ha! It still worked great. I would cook more zucchini than you think you will need - they surely do cook down!  What I thought was enough for 2 pies only did one. I used the frozen pie crusts. The top crust looked a little ragged since I had trouble getting it off the tin! (But then, most of my dishes look ugly & taste great, & this pie was no exception! ha ha!) We never told my motherinlaw what it was. She gave it rave reviews, and thought she was eating apple pie. It tastes wonderful, is easy enough for even non-pie bakers to make, and is another way to use zucchini. (Our family loves zucchini all ways, so every recipe is welcome.) Definitely worth your time to try it if anyone in your family likes apple pie! 5 out of 5 liked it here, with only one comment from my son, who preferred less cinnamon (I think I mis-read it tho - the amount is fine in here.)  Have fun!

Very good!  I used 6 cups of zucchini and made a lattice top.  I like it as well (if not better) than apple pie!  It's a great solution if you have tons of zucchini to use up like I do!  No one can tell that it is zucchini unless you tell them!

From the very first taste, this became my family's favorite pie. Nobody would ever believe it contains zucchini - as everyone says, it tastes just like apple pie - only even better!!

my 86 year old aunt is in a nursing home in indiana and told that one of the ladies there used to make zucchini pie. my first reaction was no way! having a huge garden and have tons of zucchini i decided to search the net for a recipe and found this one! oh my goodness. everyone thought that it was apple! i did do a couple of things a little different. because i was using a big glass pie plate i used 4 cups of zucchini, and a bit more flour. also, i just cooked the zucchini 2 minutes so they wouldn't be mush in the pie. they were a tad crisp just the way that i wanted!

This is difficult to rate...it tastes like apple pie, but I wouldn't make it again.  I'm happy that I made it once, it was interesting and I would recommend it for that reason.  Otherwise, if I want to eat apple pie then I'll make it with apples.  Nevertheless, thank you for the experience!

I have a friend that HATES zucchini.  I bet I could make something he would eat and LOVE.  This pie was the ticket!  He never knew he wasn't eating apple pie, until after he finished.  My family also loved it, even the veggie hating children. I didn't change anything in the receipe and it was delicious!

This was an awesome pie. We also like a zucchini cobbler recipe from this site, but this pie has much better leftovers. The cream of tartar flavor was a bit noticeable in the resulting pie, but my husband didn't mind it. I might boil the zucchini in lemon juice like the cobbler recipe next time, and reduce the cream of tartar a bit. But it was luscious and satisfying. Note: Use young zucchini, not the giant mother-of-all-zucchini that evaded harvest. The big ones are a little stringier, resulting in a slightly off texture.

My husband was VERY SKEPTICAL.  He thought this was so good, he even liked it better than a regular apple pie.  I was quite surprised too.  Couldn't believe it could really taste like apple pie.  This recipe deserves more than 5 stars.  Next time I will make 1-1/2 times the filling as we like it thicker.

Oh. My. Gosh. This tastes soooo much like apple pie.  My kids didn't know that it wasn't.  We have had so much squash and zucchini that I just wanted to find another way to use it up and this was a great way to do that! I made it exactly like the recipe said.

So i was CRAZY excited about this recipe.  My dad brings home these HUGE zucchini's and boy was I tired of baking countless loaves of bread!  I saw this and HAD to try it.  I fooled a few members of my family who really thought it was apple pie.  Definitely tastes like it.  However, i gave it 4 stars because i felt the creme of tartar was a half tablespoon too much and i felt there was too much cinnamon but everyone felt it was okay.  Other than the tartness, it was AMAZING!!!!  You definitely need to make this.

I have another recipe that a friend gave me 8 yrs. ago. Instead of boiling the zucchini you cook it in the lemon juice and it gradually beginning to look like sliced apples then add sugar and spices. I have prepared it without the crust in place of cooked apples along side pork chops. My grandchildren asked for more apples.

My husband thought this was apple pie until he found a zucchini seed. (I didn't seed the zucchini)  It was absolutely great!  I've made it twice now and the whole family loves it!

Made with a crumb topping and only used 1c sugar. Next time I will use 6c zucchini, pie wasn't full enough. Nobody could believe it wasn't apple... even the zucchini HATERS. Definitely will make again.

Wow, this a great recipe and a wonderful way to use those large overlooked zucchini hiding in your garden. I have made it many times and NO one can believe it is not apple. My husband said it was the best apple pie he had ever eaten before I told him. In order to cut down on some of the calories I have begun using a crumb topping instead of the top crust. It is fantastic either way. Make sure you don't forget to cook the zucchini first. I forgot the last time and the zucchini was crunchy and not nearly as good.

DELICIOUS!  I made it this morning and served it to my husband and mother-in-law tonight.  My mother-in-law commented that they were delicious tasting apples and my husband raved about the pie.  Then I told them it was zucchini and they couldn't believe it!  Next time I will try pre-baking the bottom crust first because it was soggy but overall - fabulous!

This pie is really wonderful and tastes exactly like apples!! It is almost like a fun prank to pull on people when you tell them it isn't apples - they will not believe it!  I decreased sugar to 1 cup and added at least 2 more cups of apples and it was perfect!!!

This pie is awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  My husband says it is his 2nd favorite pie ever - second only to his grandmother's famous lemon meringue pie - and that is quite a compliment.  I will make this again and again.  It is delicious and very easy to put together.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

First thing I'd like to say is the texture is exactly like a cooked apple.  Remember to peel the Zucchini, and take the seeds out (you can reserve them for a spaghetti sauce).  I didn't one time, cause someone said they didn't notice them, but I personally did.  They were mush.  Yucky.  I may decrease the Cream of Tartar just a TOUCH still, but not much.  You need quite a bit for a pie this size to give it that tart taste apples have.  I would personnally add more sweetner.  For those who like a brown sugar taste you could always try adding 1/2 a cup of raisins as well.
Biggest tip I can offer: cut the zucchini thin!  1/4 inch pieces. It's a bit more labour, true, but the inside can retain a "veggie" flavour if the pieces are too thick, and the idea is to trick your brain into thinking it's apple.  I've done the thick pieces, trying to mimic the chunks of apple I'd put into a pie ... it's not worth it.  You won't know the difference if the pieces are smaller.  They'll just look like apple that's been chopped a bit more.  Texture will still be retained.  And ... it'll taste like apple all the way through.

I do NOT like vegetables!  And this was the BEST pie I have ever had! 
 I kept serving it to people, then telling them it was zucchini instead of apple.  They didn't believe me!   :-)
Used crumb topping.  Sliced the zucchini to look like apples.  
Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I think you could make this "apple" pie with any bland vegetable, because the taste is provided by the lemon, sugar and cinnamon. The advantage of the zucchini is that it looks like apple slices and retains a good texture, even after boiling and baking, which surprised me.  Once boiled, the zucchini is almost tasteless.  So it is a great way to use homegrown zucchini, especially those large ones. I used 6 cups zucchini. I think 8 cups might be better. I also did not use a bottom or top crust, but used the streusel topping for the top (much quicker). Baked for 30 minutes.

I went out and bought zucchini for this recipe, and after making it I see why everybody is saying the its great for those with too much zucchini on their hands. It was good, but I left my recipe on the counter, and after my family saw that it was a vegetable they wouldn't hardly try it! Next time I'll just use this recipe with other fruit :)I used 5 zucchini and leakylou's suggestion for a crumble on top, which was the perfect addition. With the crumble, I would reccomend cooking it about 35 minutes.

OH. MY. GOD. ok. This is *the* biggest lifesaver...its seriously so good. I'm actually on the South Beach diet, but my fiancee is notttt...i made this with splenda and no crust (like baked apples) and it was AMAZING! I personally suggest halving the lemon juice if u do this, but man oh man is it yummyyyy! I put it on a ritz cracker w a little cool whip free for a guilt free snack.    ps: my fiancee hates zucchini. pps: he ate half my "apples" with ritz and fat free ice cream ppps: he wants more.   i can't rate this high enough. As an allrecipes addict, this is BY FAR my fav recipe yet.

Though I've been a member for 3 years, this is my first review--this pie was *that* good!  I used 6 cups of zucchini and a 1/3 of the streusal topping that another reader suggested.  This came out amazing--my super-skeptical husband enjoyed!  Thanks so much...

I keep having to remind myself that I baked this pie with zucchini and not apples. It is impossible to tell the difference. I used the struesel topping as per another users rating, and prepared my own pie crust and it was the best pie I've ever tasted! The best part is that my husband is allergic to apples... not zucchini!! He gives it 12 out of 10 as well! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!!!!!!

I registered with Allrecipes.com JUST to rate this recipe.  I've made it twice, and it's my first attempt at making any pie whatsoever.  It turned out with MAJOR reviews from both occasions (most recently, Thanksgiving).  It tastes JUST like apple pie, but not as overtly sweet or fruity as apple usually is.  Amazing.  Make this pie!

This recipe is fabulous.  I served it to my family saying it was apple pie and to my surprise no one thought it was anything but apple pie.  When I said it was zucchini no one believed me and my doubting daughter even made me show her the zucchini peels to prove it.  Believe me, it's that good.

This was pretty good.  I had to use up some sad looking zucchini's in the fridge, so I whipped this up.  I didn't have a pie crust, so I just put in a small baking dish and put some phyllo dough on the top.  For sure you can't tell these aren't apples.

This taste just like apple pie! Apple pie is a favorite at our home and I was shocked that a zucchini could mask itself into tasting like an apple. I was hesitant but glad I tried this recipe.

I didn’t have an extra crust so I made a cinnamon crumble topping. This was SO GOOD and had perfect texture, and you’d never know it did not contain apples! The texture is what I prefer for apple pie, but it takes a lot of time to get that consistency with apples... I will be making this instead of apple pie in the future!

4 stars ONLY because I changed it a bit, but for what it is definitely five stars! Couldn’t tell it wasn’t apple pie. Definitely use a lot more zucchini than called for. Was a little runny even after adding extra flour and a little cornstarch, because I always do,( hate runny pies) I also let it cool for about 6 hours, so that wasn’t the problem, However it was DELICIOUS! My brother asked me why I didn’t make it yesterday instead of the zucchini cake, he thought was gross, when I told him it used the same thing he was a little confused, and asked if the cake had apples, I said no, the pie is zucchini! He thought I was joking. He LOVES apple pie, and thought it was the same as always.

I've made this quite a few times and even people who say they hate zucchini with a passion, can't tell, and I haven't the nerve to tell them! I've substituted Splenda for the sugar but it makes a more watery pie, but not objectionably so. I only boil the zucchini for 2 min and then taste a piece. and if it's tender crisp, I quickly drain it and plunge the zucchini into an ice water bath for 5 min. Then I just let it sit in the strainer until I'm ready for it, so I can make the zucchini first and not worry about interruptions later. I mix the remaining ingredients together and THEN add the zucchini, stirring to coat, because the zucchini adds some water. If I didn't make it myself, I would never believe it wasn't apples.

This is a great way to utilize your extra zucchini.  We made zucchini cobbler as well, but the pie was everyone's favorite.  I will make this again when I have extra zucchini.  My kids liked this pie too!

This is amazing. If I had not have made this I would have sworn it was apple pie. Really do not like to bake so used a premade frozen pie shell and made the crumb topping also. Great way to use up the zucchini bounty.

Easy to make and tasted great. My family loved this pie. Great for the summer when all the zuchini ripen at the same time. Try this recipe you won't be disappointed.
