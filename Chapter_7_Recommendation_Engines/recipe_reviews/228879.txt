I loved this recipe! I was house-sitting so I only had ingredients that I could find.  I used fat free half-n-half instead of milk and whipping cream, crushed ritz crackers instead of panko, shredded parmesean cheese instead of cheddar, and didn't add pepper or cinnamon.  It was still wonderful, but will add cinnamon next time.

This has the potential to be a great way to serve sweet potatoes IMO.  I used 2c 2% milk, 1c 10% cream, 1t cinammon and twice the amt of gratin mix. Next time I will  up the spices even more and maybe add a bit of sweetness.  A difficulty I had with the recipe, and many others that ask for a number of apples, potatoes, onions etc, is that I don't know what that really means.   I used 1.1kg or 2.5lb sweet potatoes which was just right.

We had this tonight as a side dish to a beautiful rack of lamb and, honestly, this was a huge disappointment.   I scaled this down using the "change servings" feature on this site.  Followed the recipe to the letter, except for using half-and-half instead of whipping cream.  There was not enough liquid to even finish cooking the potatoes in the oven.  I ended up adding more half-and-half, more milk, and even more cinnamon and nutmeg, but it still didn't have a lot of flavor.  Sorry for the bad review, Jill H, but this just didn't measure up to an au gratin dish in my opinion.  Not sure what went wrong, but I won't be making this again.

I did not care for this recipe. I couldn't get the sauce to thicken for the life of me. Tried it twice. Instructions are scarce.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the way this recipe turned out.  It lacked the flavor I was looking for.  I may try again and make a few changes, because the concept of Sweet Potatoes Au Gratin sounds absolutely delicious.  Any helpful suggestions would be appreciated!
