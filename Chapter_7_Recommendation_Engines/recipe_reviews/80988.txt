These taste just like the old-time red patties! My mother is a "professional" at candy-making, so I tried some of her tips...Do not add the peanuts initially -- only the sugar, corn syrup, milk -- stir constantly over medium/med-high heat until candy thermometer registers around 240 -- or firm, soft ball forms when poured into ice water.  This takes about 12-15 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir in butter, vanilla, red coloring. Stir in peanuts, drop immediately onto greased pan. Sticks horribly to waxed paper! I found Planters red spanish peanuts and they were great in this!

Well, I was the brave one who decided to try this recipe first since I love to try new things. I have to admit that mine didn't turn out. The problem is that the recipe gives a range of what you should cook the mixture to. I should have known better, but being impatient I only cooked it to 234 degrees. In order for the candy to set-up properly into patties, it has to be cooked to 240 without stirring. Consequently, I poured the entire mixture into a jelly roll pan and have a large pan that I can eat with a spoon. The taste is excellent, and I may even try it again sometime, but I'll be sure to cook it to 240.

These were amazing BETTER than the store bought!!I did make a couple of changes from the original recipe.I boiled mixture till it reached 250-and I waited to add peanuts with the butter,vanilla & food coloring.And instead of making indivdual patties I greased 3 aluminum pie plate tins and divided mixture between them.They turned out GREAT!!!!

Thanks for posting this recipe. I have been making these for almost 20 years. I use half and half instead of evaporated milk. I will try the evaporated milk to see if I like it better. Also, instead of just pouring these out to cool, I let them cool down about 10 minutes, then stir them until they seem to lose their "sheen". At that point, I quickly spoon them into portions. It is labor intensive, so be prepared to stir, stir, stir. You will be rewarded.

The taste of this receipe is great, Just wish they would have set better.  I cooked them until 240 deg and they were more like peanut taffy.

the most important bit of information was left out...After you stir in the butter, vanilla & food coloring you need to beat by hand until it gets thick. My first batch I did exactly as recipe said and had to throw it out. Then a consulted a friend and they told me that you had to beat and beat and it would thicken up and it did !!!

I amde these and the taste was very good. They did not become rounds as I was expecting but stayed rather flat and I did cook all the way to 240. Also tehy stuck to the paper and wouldn't come off. My kids didn't care but I wasn't too pleased.

This recipe has extrememly TOO much vanilla extract in it. That is all we could taste. =( I think that 1/2-1 TEASPOON would be sufficent. I also recommend cooking it to 244-250 degrees. I will try this recipe again, but definitely with those revisions.

I think I'll give up. Two batches that were both utter failures. The first I followed the instructions as listed here. You'd need a spoon to eat it. The second I followed what many said about heating to 250. The second weas better, but still more like gooey taffy than the "gas station peanut patties" I was hoping for. I'll continue seeking that perfect peanut patty recipe.

This recipe is the best I have tried,except I had to cook it to 250 degrees. Also as a helpful hint put them in foil cupcake  baking cups. It keeps them all together instead of spreading out eveywhere.Be sure to spray the cups with PAM.

I was very happy with the taste, but it stopped there. It may have been the humidity, but hours later mine were not completely set and I could tell the first batch was gonna stick to the wax paper,(and my table) so I sprayed the next row of wax paper with PAM. That kept them from having to be pried off my table top, but the paper still stuck to the back. IF I ever make them again, I will  use a candy thermometer and not the cold water method and I will have to figure out something else to put the hot candy on.

Soft ball stage is 250 degrees, I highly recommend a candy thermometer. Increased butter to 2 tablespoons which is the only thing I remembered from an old family friend's recipe, other than pouring the completed mixture in the mixer bowl and beating it well before spooning it out. She also would butter an 9x9 square baking pan, pour the mixture in and let it cool, then slice in squares like fudge.

I followed the directions exactly, cooking to a soft-ball stage on the candy thermometer.  They did not set.

I have read another recipe and they didn't add the evaporated milk in their recipe.  What difference does it make?
I gave it four stars because of the other reviews.

Definitely NOT pink peanut patties.  More like caramel patties.  As such, they set up fine and taste good, but not what I was looking for.

This is the basic Peanut Brittle recipe just made with milk instead of water. Don't add the peanuts until the mixture reaches near 230 degrees. Then add the nuts and bring the mixture back up to 230 plus and continue to 240 or a little higher. he nuts will be stiff and will take several minutes to mix them well. They will cook in the time it takes to bring the temperature back up. Can add flavoring and a little more butter if desired. What happened to the Peppermint flavoring?

This recipe got good reviews from the family.  It has a creamier texture than the store bought ones.  I tried to cook it to 250 as some reviewers suggested but only made it to 240 and as a consequence I think I may have cooked it a little to long.  It had really good flavor even though some patties were dry.

Great recipe. I grew up in Texas where the ubiquitous red peanut pattie is everywhere. This is a very good recipe that comes very close. I modified the recipe by replacing the corn syrup with a 3/4 cup white sugar, and 3/16 cup of warm water mixture as my family members are allergic to corn.
