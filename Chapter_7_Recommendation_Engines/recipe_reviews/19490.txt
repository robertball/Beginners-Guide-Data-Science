Yumm. I have made these crabcakes many times and I have made some changes to the recipe that I think work better. In ingredients I used 2 6oz. cans crabmeat, 2 eggs, 6 oz. (approx. 20) ritz crackers, and 1/2 tsp. Old Bay seasonings, and only 1/2 cup breadcrumbs. Everything else I kept the same. I did not saute my green onions in oil, but followed the rest of the recipe the same. I would reduce the amount of oil in pan for frying. I serve with aioli. This is the best recipe I've found: 3/4 cup mayo, 3 cloves minced garlic, 2 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice, 3/4 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Stir all together, and chill. GREAT!!!

These are turning into one of our favorites!  I've made them a number of times and have done some tweaking to the recipe.  I use just one sleeve of reduced-fat Town House crackers, and I combine them with the green onions, black pepper, and some garlic powder in the food processor.  I use two 6-ounce cans of crabmeat, and one tablespoon of Dijon mustard instead of the dry mustard.  

Also, I use reduced-fat mayo, and I always put in double the cayenne, as well as fresh pressed garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I then coat them with cornmeal and bake them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes, or until they're warmed through - a lower-fat alternative to frying.  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you for this recipe.  These were the best crab cakes I've ever made.  I did change the recipe a little bit.  I had leftover dungeness crab, about 16 oz.  I added 1 sleeve of crushed 4 oz. toasted club crackers.  I added a bit more old bay since I am from Maryland and we M'landers like O'lbay.  I added extra garlic powder, but next time wouldn't add so much.  I used 2 eggs and about 1/2 cup of mayo.  I made these in one of those aluminum tins that you get muffins in at the grocery store.  4 muffins to a tin.  I sprayed with butter crisco and then lined the tins with the breadcrumbs.  I then just put the scoops of crab mixture in each tin (lightly, didn't pack down), then topped with more breadcrumbs and a final spritz of the cooking spray.  I baked for about 1/2 hour at 350.  WOW...these came out great except for a little too much garlic on my part.

I also made an impromptu aioli sauce by just sweating about 2 teaspoons of (purchased minced garlic) in the same pan I made the green onions in.  I put this in my mini food processer with about 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cut lemon.  Wowee.....wonderful!!!

LOL...I made fresh asparagus on the side.  What a wonderful, wonderful meal and I still have 2 huge crab muffins for tomorrow!!  Thanks again! I'm sure they will be smelling me at work tomorrow.

Finally an easy and delicious crab cake recipe!  I made the crab cakes for our Italian Christmas Eve Fish dinner and everyone LOVED them.  I quadrupled the recipe (used 4 cans of crab meat) and got about 20 crab cakes out of it.  I also only used 2 and 2/3 sleeves of Ritz crackers and added fresh chopped parsley for some more flavor.  I also breaded the cakes with ground corn flakes instead of the bread crumbs and they came out nice and crunchy!  The cakes were great, but the aioli sauce made them the hit!  Here is the recipe again: 3/4 c mayo, 3 cloves garlic minced, 2 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper Mix all together and chill.  I would reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp though next time since it seemed a bit too salty for my taste.

With a few adjustments suggested by others these were the best I've had.  I used two cans of crab and one sleeve of Ritz.  I added fewer onions, but also some minced red pepper for color.  Served them for some extra special friends and they know good food when they taste it.  An instant classic. p.s. if you don't want to invest in buying Old Bay or don't have the room in the spice cabinet, just look at the ingredient list; you probably have most of them in your cupboard already.

I am a huge fan of crab cakes, and these were fantastic. They are one of the few crab cake recipes that I have enjoyed with canned crab as opposed to fresh. All of the spices mixed very well together, but if you arent a fan of cayenne pepper I would cut it down to a 1/4 teaspoon. I used 4 oz. of crackers and fried the crab cakes in butter instead of oil. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. I do recommend using less crackers, and frying in butter instead of oil. I got a better consistency and crispness that way.

These are WONDERFUL!  There seems to be a typo in the recipe, however. You do NOT need 4 cups of vegetable oil to fry them in, a half cup will do just fine.  Also, the recipe doesn't say to add the fried scallions, but obvously you do. 

I only used 1/4 lb. of crackers, because 1/2 lb. seemed like a LOT... and they turned out just great.  I'll probably try them next time with the full 1/2 lb. just to see, but they were wonderful as they were.  I served these with a tangy sauce made from fresh lime juice, sugar, fresh hot chiles, and salt.  DELICIOUS!  I don't like seafood typically, and I was fighting my fiance for the last one.

I used maybe 3 T. of saltine cracker crumbs and I would have been happy with even less.  I used the green part of the onion only, and didn't precook it.  I added minced red bell pepper for color and  flavor interest. I cut back on the cayenne pepper sigificantly as well as the ground mustard to 1/2 tsp. and the garlic powder to 1/4 tsp.  I mixed up all the ingredients but folded the crab meat in  last, so as to preserve the nice chunks of lump crab meat I used.  Crab cakes should have minimal spice and just enough filler to bind the mixture.  Once mixed I refrigerated the mixture for about half an hour for ease in forming it into cakes and for the crumbs to totally absorb the egg. Once formed into cakes I refrigerated the crab cakes another couple of hours before frying them in vegetable oil, not olive oil.  I served them with "Garlic Aioli," also from this site.  Five stars with the above modifcations to suit my taste.

The best! I can't count how many compliments I get on this recipe! I sauted both green & white onions, as well as a little bit of garlic. I also added a bit of the Old Bay seasoning into the breadcrumbs when coating the patties. And as per the other reviews, I usually double the recipe, because people are always fighting over the last one! This recipe is surely a keeper.

I love crab cakes and now my own crab cakes are my favorite.  I can never stick to a recipe, so I added to this recipe and combined a few ingredients from "Maryland Crab Cakes and III" , but it was great.  I used bread crumbs and corn meal instead of saltines or crackers, I added green onions and some other spices, but it was great!  I served it with "Trader Joe's" tartar sauce and everyone flips over them!!

Wow!!! I took a chance and made this recipe with fresh Dungeness crab (a real budget splurge, but worth every penny).  It was fantastic!  I didn't have quite as much dried mustard on hand as I thought, so used a little yellow mustard, along with the last of the dried.  I simplified the preparation by chopping the green onion in the food processor with the crackers.  It eliminated the slicing and frying step, as well as cutting back a little on the fat content.  I was concerned about the cayanne pepper being too spicy, so only used 1/4 tsp.  It was perfect for us.  This recipe is a real "keeper"!

Better than restaurant quality!  How many times have you gone into a restaurant and ordered crab cakes only to wonder, "where's the crab?"  This is ALL crab!  It's fantastic, thank you Rod.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and increased the Old Bay from 1/4 to a 1/2 t, and from 1 egg to 2 eggs.  I also used 21 crushed Ritz crackers (20 wasn't enough, it was a little too wet).  The rest of the ingredients I left the same.  I used a 1/3 measuring cup to keep the crab cakes the same size and I ended up with eight restaurant size crab cakes. Thank you again Rod for sharing this delicious and easy recipe with us. I also served this with the garlic aioli that keeps coming up on this recipe: Mix the following ingredients until well combined- 3/4 c mayonnaise, 3 cloves pressed garlic, 3 T lemon juice, 3/4 t salt and 1/2 t pepper.  This is a really excellent aioli to accompany the crab cakes. ~~~Update- I've now made this four times and had rare reviews, thank you again Rod for a fantastic recipe.  Today I tried the recipe with canned wild Alaskan Sockeye salmon.  It was just as good as the crab.  If your family doesn't like salmon, this is a great way to introduce it to them.

After four crab seasons of searchin for the perfect crab cakes I think we have a winner! Wow!  these can be a meal all in themselves.  Sooo good.  The aioli recipe given by the first reviewer on the main recipe page really puts this recipe over the top.  This isn't my recipe but I'll repeat to save you time in looking for it. 3/4 c mayo, 3 cloves garlic minced, 2 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper  Mix all together and chill.  Try it you'll love it :)

Ok, these were DELICIOUS. I made a few minor changes. I used sweet cream butter instead of oil to saute my green onions and I threw in some garlic as well. And instead of using canned crab meat, I used the meat from a whole small Dungeness crab and left it pretty lumpy. I also only used 6 ounces of crushed crackers instead of 8 because I don't like our cakes too dry. Finally, I fried them in 50/50 butter and oil. In all I ended up with 8 crab cakes which was more than enough for me, my husband and my 4 year old (who ate 2 by himself). I actually just ate the last two for breakfast, I couldn't help myself. :) They were scrumptious and I will be making these again real soon.

I love crab and these crab cakes were so awesome! My BF gave this a 10+++. I bought the lump crab from costco-chicken of seas lump cake $15.99. The first thing I did was cook the green onions with a little minced celery. I took it easy on the cayenne pepper, used fresh minced garlic, coleman's dry mustard. I added a little fresh italian flat leaf parsley and fresh dill. I mixed everything well before adding the crab meat. I gently molded in large patties. I chilled 6 patties for 45 minutes before baking at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. I try not to fry in oil. These crab cakes are so Yummy!! The only thing I would do different is to ease up on the amount of salt. I also served these crab cakes with, "Mustard Cream Sauce," and "Garlic Aioli," also found on this website, to compliment these crab cakes. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very tasty.  I baked in the oven and put the bread crumbs in the bottom of the muffin dishes. Thanks to the person who made the suggestion.  Also I left out the cayenne and garlic powder.  Just added the old bay and it was very tasty.

These were really very good. I did as a few others did, and put them in the oven on 350 for about 30 minutes. 15 min per side. I added additional cayenne, which put them a tad on the hot side, but that was my bad, not the recipe. The recipe was great! I used 3 cans & got 5 really big crab cakes! Thanks for a terrific recipe!!

I made these for a family party & it got RAVE reviews!!!  Everyone LOVED them!  I used some of the changes suggested by others such as using 2 cans of crabmeat, 2 eggs, 1 tbsp dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning, & didn't saute the onions.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt, & 1/4 tsp. pepper to the mix.  I served them with chilled homemade aioli: 3/4 c. mayo, 3 cloves minced garlic, 2 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice, 3/4 tsp. salt, & 1/2 tsp pepper.

So good!   I followed the recommendations of others & used 2 (6 oz) cans of crab meat, and less oil for frying (1/4 C is plenty!) The only problem I had with these is that they are fragile and fell apart when I tried to flatten them into patties.  I solved the problem by rolling the finished mixture  into a ball (about the size of a golf ball if you want cakes about the size served in restaurants) placed the ball in the center of my bread crumb plate spinkled bread crumbs over the top and then smashed them into patties. Worked perfectly! The best thing about these is that they are great the next day too, just pop them in the oven @ 425 for about 5-7 minutes (turning once) Thanx Rod!

I feel bad giving these such a bad rating.  I wanted them to be good and I love crabcakes but I followed this recipe to a T and I couldn't taste the crab at all they just tasted like mushy ritz crackers.

Sorry. I tried to like this. I double checked the recipe and maybe I was the one who made a mistake, but this was awful. I expect crab cakes to be moist and packed with crab. Mine were buttery, thick, salty, dry, and there was no taste of crab.

Thoroughly  enjoyed these!  Since we need to eat gluten free, I used some garden flavored rice crackers that i ground in my food processor for the filling and the coating.   They turned out great.

This crab cake recipe ROCKS!  I made them for a recent Caribbean theme party and they disappeared instantly -- made little tiny ones to serve as hors-d'oeuvre.  Received absolutely RAVE reviews. I altered the recipe by increasing the amount of crab and reducing the amount of crackers and green onions. Here in Canada, I used Ritz crackers instead of 'Buttery crackers'. Thanks Rod! Thank you also to all the other reviewers, whose comments persuaded me to try them in the first place.

Super delicious. I changed it up a bit. I used 8 oz. fresh crab meat and 8 oz. imitation lobster chunks. I used minced garlic rather than garlic powder, a good squirt of prepared mustard and rather than 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, I only used 1/4 tsp. i also omitted coating the patties with panko or bbread crumbs. They fried up just perfect. I used an ice cream scoop to make uniform patties and it yielded 8. These are terrific, I will definitely make them again.

I'm sorry, but I was not a huge fan of these. I followed the recipe and found that they fell apart very easily in the pan and had a strange taste (I am attributing that to the meat - I think next time I will use fresh crab meat). I also tried with flaked krab and found the same thing. My husband is a huge seafood fan and even he noticed a weird taste to them.

My husband and I are big seafood eaters and these were the best crab cakes we have ever had.  I put the extra uncooked crab cakes in the freezer to enjoy for a quick meal or treat at a later date.  2 thumbs way up!

Best crab cakes I've had, these were great! I doubled the recipe, using a medium size cookie scoop 2 scoops made a 3in diameter 1/2in thick crab cake, ended up with 19. Used butter club crackers, 1 2/3 sleeves (18oz box) for the doubled recipe. Recommend starting with half the bread crumb coating, I threw a lot of it away. Used half bread and half panko (was low on panko) and 5 6oz cans of crab meat. Used the olive oil to fry the green onions, scooped them along w/the oil into the batter. After making them I put them in the fridge for an hour on a wax paper lined cookie sheet, they were nice and firm and held together perfectly while frying. Used vegetable oil to fry them (less expensive) and they turned out great.  Served with Remoulade Sauce from this site.  They reheat well in the oven if you use the Panko crumbs. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were delish!  Used 4 cans (4oz dry) crabmeat, 2 eggs, 20 ritz crackers and a little more old bay.  Everyone raved about them.  Definitely serve with the Garlic Aoili!

This was an easy recipe that is impossible to ruin.  I did not have 8 oz. of crackers - - 4 oz. works just fine.  If you are using canned crab, however, squeeze out as much liquid as possible.  I did not have garlic powder but garlic salt works nicely.  I would suggest that the egg is whipped with the mayonnaise, spices, seasonings and onion to get evenly distributed flavors and then add the crab and lastly the crumbs.  

I like my crab cakes well done and the 1/2 inch size cooks easily and and are crispy.  They also hold together well.

I like a slightly more seasoned crab cake.  Next time, I will add more onion and also a very finely chopped 1/2 stalk of celery to the sautee pan.  Finally, I would also suggest additional Old Bay seasoning to taste (my favorite).

One word, WOW!  I made this recipe with only a few modifications...I took others advice and didn't saute the green onions.  I chopped them along with the crackers in the food processor.  Additionally, I added fresh chopped garlic, a little white pepper, and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce.  These crab cakes were to die for!!!

This is a great recipe!  My whole family loved them!  My 6 year old kept asking for more.  In addition to all the listed ingredients, I added chopped celery to mine, used two cans of crabmeat instead of one, and used 1/2 the amount of crackers.  They turned out just great!!

The best crab cakes I've ever eaten.  Substitutions include:

1/2 carmelized vidalia for 6 sauteed green onions
1/3 lb Club crackers for 8 oz Ritz (probably the popular choice)

I also shook the cayenne a couple of more times.  I tend to do that with my spicier ingredients.

DELICIOUS! I used two tablespoons of mayonnaise instead, and fried them in garlic butter (6 tbsp) after coating them with panko crumbs mixed with freshly grated parmesean cheese. My Fiance' wanted to propose again! :) Try this sauce!! : 1 cup of sour cream, 2 tbsp thousand island dressing, 6 drops of tobasco and two drops of lemon juice. SO YUMMY!

Turned out fabulous!!! Also, super easy! I do add more mayo to my liking. I also tried this as is with canned boneless skinless salmon and made the best salmon cakes ever!! Thank You for this recipe. I have made crab cakes at least 5 times and even took them in for a potluck. Unfortunately they were left over but they still got rave reviews!!!

Really sorry, but I'll stick to my own recipe from now on.  Living very near Puget Sound, DH and I catch our own Dungeness and we prefer CRABBY crab cakes.  I read the reviews and cut the crackers down by more than half... and still got cracker cakes, not crab cakes.  Even the Old Bay and cayenne got lost in the crackers.  I ended up boiling up the shells I had just picked with a little water to make crab stock... then added it to the mix and poured it by tablespoonsful into the pan where it firmed up as it fried.  They came out crisp and golden, but with very little crab flavor even still.  If you want true crab flavor, try something with less binder.  These are seasoned cracker cakes, not crab cakes.

My mother is in constant search for a good crabcake. With a few modifications, this recipe totally won her over! I used 16oz. of crabmeat (special, not lump), 2 eggs, and halved the crackers. I even used light mayo and they still tasted great. Made them the night before, breaded them, and they sat all night in the fridge. Browned perfectly in the pan. Thanks for the fabulous start to something that will remain in my recipe box for a long time!

O.K. I'm not going to rate this one because I made a huge mistake which happened to turn out just fine. While I was making these as an appetizer for Christmas Eve, I noticed that once all the ingredients had been mixed together, it was very dry and wasnt sticking together. After quickly glancing at the recipe, I poured 1/2 cup of oil into the mixture, then realized what I had done. Well, my first thought was too throw it all out but then I decided to just brown them on a very hot non stick pan. Now I personally did not try these, but I did double this recipe and none were left over! Everyone said they were terrific!

I sauteed chopped onions and peppers(no green onions in), used less than half the crackers, doubled the mayo, & since no bay seasoning, added some basil, celery seed, parsley, dill weed, lemon juice & a good dash of worchershire sauce. I eased up on the cayenne pepper slightly, & mixed everything well B4 adding the lump crabmeat gently. Only needed half cup of bread crumbs. Delicious, crabby, flavorful, & moist!! (Didn't even use a condiment!!)

These crab cakes are absolutely wonderful.  I took the advice of the other reviews and added an extra can of crab and only half the amount of crackers.  I love garlic, so I used the new butter and garlic ritz crackers and it was the perfect touch.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I had to tweak this quite a bit (and make these twice), but I think I like what I ended up with.  I used only 1 tsp. oil to sautee the green onions in, 3 cans crabmeat (otherwise, I wouldn't have ended up with many crab cakes), 2 eggs, 2 Tbl. mayonnaise, 1 tsp. *fresh* garlic, 1/2 tsp. Old Bay, 1/4 tsp salt (canned crab usually has salt in it), 1/2 tsp. pepper, pinch of cayenne (I don't like things spicy), plus I added 1/2 Tbl. olive oil to the mixture to make it more flavorful and moist.  I served them with "Mustard Cream Sauce" from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe came out to be delicious, I definitely would recommend it; however I took the advice appeared in many ratings -- that you need just half amount of the crackers.

Every store I went to today was sold out of fresh dungenous crab and I was craving crab for a large family dinner for New Years day.  I thought of crab cakes, and bought 12 ounces of lump crab meat. (enought to double this recipe) and went searching for a great recipe that did not use much mayo, (ick).  I tried this one and followed some of the commenters tips about red peppers.  Other then that I followed the recipe exactly.  Fantastic. This is now my go to recipe.  I did not have cayenne so I added some Franks hot sauce.  These are really, really good.

Amazing!  I made a few changes as suggested by other reviewers.  Instead of sauteing the green onions, I just cut them and added them to the rest of the bowl with the other ingredients.  They will cook once you start frying the crab cake.  I also added an extra egg.  The first time I made this, the crab cake fell apart when frying (because I only used one egg). The extra egg helps the crab cake stay together.  Besides that, did everything as the recipe stated.  Try it out, it's delicious!

Without a doubt, theeeee best crab cakes ive ever tasted. Not just made, but tasted! WOW I was shocked that these were something I made. The recipe definitely does not make as many as it says, maybe about half. I doubled the recipe and got about as much as the recipe said it would make. I will make these over and over again!

The very best crab cakes I have ever enjoyed. This is a must recipe...thank you.   Use the Panko breadcrumbs and don't cut the expense....it makes a difference. We are hooked.

I am sorry I thought this recipe was pretty bad. All we could taste was ritz crackers?? I don't know if it was the brand of crab I used or what, but these were bland. Definately will not be making again.

Really good! We don't have Old Bay so I improvised with a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper flakes and 2 dashes of ginger, paprika.  Also used Ancient grain crackers.

FABULOUS!  I am kind of a crab cake snob and these really rate high with me!  I used less oil to sauté the green onions, but then needed to add another T of mayo to get it to bind.  It also helps to let it sit a while for the cracker crumbs to soften to make molding the cakes easier.  Other changes I made:  I used less Ritz cracker crumbs...probably about 1 1/2 sleeves, 1/2 tsp of Old Bay, and I definitely think the Panko crumbs add a lot for the coating.  The aioli recipe that some reviews included was great too!  We also served the cakes with Thai sweet red chili sauce.  Really, really good and definitely a keeper!

Very good crabcake recipe.  Made a few modifications - used 2 eggs as it didn't seem to clump together enough with 1 egg, and also baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes instead of frying.    Also sauteed the green onions just using Pam instead of oil to further cut down on calories.  Turned out great.  The cakes won't brown as much with Panko bread crumbs and baking vs. frying but otherwise very good.

I used flake-style crab-flavored fish product (not canned), and added an extra egg.  I think Panko is key, they were very crispy and delicious!  I wasn't expecting much from my faux-crab, but this recipe made it quite tasty!  I will definitely be making this again, because it was a hit with my picky husband.

Great recipe.  I used 1 cup of shrimp(roughly chopped) and 6 oz of canned lump crab meat.  In addition I used spicy mayo, and a little more cayenne pepper, which added more kick to the flavor.  I also followed the advice of in the other reviews and used 1 1/4 cup of crackers.  Loved it!

This was my first attempt at crab cakes, and I was very pleased with this recipe.  I followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers and used less crackers, about 6 ounces.  I think next time I will scale back even more on crackers, to let the crab really shine through.  I also used less oil than the recipe called for to saute the green onions, and more Old Bay seasoning.  That stuff is the bomb.  Served the cakes with store bought remoulade sauce, which was yummy.  As a side, used the recipe on this site for creamy macaroni and cheese and it was a very memorable comfort food meal.

A very good recipe, although fairly heavy on the cracker crumbs to crabmeat ratio.  Using the suggestions of previous posters, I used 8 ozs. of crabmeat, used 2 eggs instead of 1 egg, used only 4 ozs. of crackers, and cut the cayenne pepper by half.  I eliminated the oil at the beginning of the recipe and instead just ground up the onions in the food processor along with the crackers.  I did coat the crab cakes with bread crumbs, but I think I'll skip that step the next time.

Excellent!  A huge hit at T'giving!  I used 1 can lump crab and one cup of fresh lump crab, with one sleeve of Town House crackers.  I also added very finely diced sauteed red pepper instead of the scallions.  I made the cakes small and this helped them cook better.  Delicious.

These crab cakes were awesome.  My family loved them.  They had just enough bite and were fairly simple to make.  I also halved the amount of crushed crackers and I had to use an extra egg but they were still wonderful.  Next time I may add a stalk of chopped celery for cruch.

Overall a good recipe. However, being from Baltimore I do modify. I only use the panko and not the cracker crumbs too otherwise it's too much filler. And of course we use fresh crab meat. Plus I like mine a little more flavourful so use a couple of teaspoons of the Old Bay along with the cayenne and garlic powder.

I've made these several times and everyone loves them.  Just a couple of adjustments--I fry them in a mixture of olive oil and butter, and when making for my husband, I cut back on the cayenne as these pack quite a kick!  I looked up a recipe for aioli (garlic mayo) on this site, and that is all we serve with them now--no cocktail sauce needed.  Really delicious.

You don't need as much oil when cooking, other than that they are GREAT! Had a christmas party with over 25 people and not one left at the end of the evening.. and I made a lot.  People still talk about them!

I used 8oz of crab meat and half the mayo, it came out delicious. It was enough to make 4 very nice sized crab cakes:} Thanks!

Followed this almost to the T except I only used 3 green onions since it was all I had. 6 would have been perfect!  I used panko and instead of dry mustard I used real mustard.  Very moist and flakey.  I like to make them more round then flat as it makes them easier to turn without falling apart.  Rivals some I have had in restaurants.  I also made a garlic aioli that went perfect.  Next time I will try and mango salsa.  Yum!

I made these last night for our New Year's Eve dinner. I think the spices and amount of filler was just right, however, with using canned crabmeat, the texture was off for me. My husband didn't seem to mind and ate his and mine, so I'm sure this is just down to preference. Next time I make these, I will use lump, fresh crabmeat. Other than that, the cooking time was perfect and they turned out a beautiful golden brown. I also used half oil/half butter to fry my cakes, which I think helps with the taste. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Great, easy recipe.  I cut down the amount of crackers and panko though because the amount listed seemed a bit much.

Excellent - Make these low carb by using 1/2 cup almond meal in place of the crackers and skip the breading - they fry up nice and crisp without the breading, moist and yummy inside. I usually make a caper sauce to go with savory croquettes, but these don't need it.

Sorry, but I did not care for this recipe!  These were very bland, way too much cracker and just....plain.  I thought I misread the recipe, but....alas, not.  Don't understand the raves for this. All I could taste was cracker and onion.  Even the cayenne was lost, and I added 1/2 again as much because we like spicy.  It did have a nice crunch though.  Even after soaking up all the oil in the pan! Won't even tweak this recipe; sorry!

These were delicious. I didn't saute the green onions first (instead, I ran the green onions and one sleeve of reduced fat Ritz crackers through a food processor). I also used a tbsp of dijon mustard instead of the dry mustard and doubled the cayenne pepper. Finally, I used 2 eggs and extra crab meat. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I ran out of time to make aioli, and the crab cakes alone were a little spicy (thanks to the extra cayenne), but they were still delicious -- and with a cool sauce to dip them in, they would have been perfect.

I had some left over dungeness crab (boiled in Louisiana crab boil seasonings), so I used that instead of canned crabmeat and omitted the Old Bay and the extra salt.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  My husband gobbled it up.  Great stuff!  Best crab cakes ever!   Thanks for such an excellent  recipe.

Long time crab cake lover, first time crab cake maker. These were really delicious! I used freshly picked blue crab and added a little fresh parsley and fresh lemon juice. Also, ditched the cayenne and added more Old Bay. Baked for 30 min at 350, as per other's suggestions.

This recipe was my first attempt at crab cakes, and it didn't disappoint!  I made these for a girls night in, and everyone loved them!  I followed the exact recipe-the only adjustment I would make is to reduce the amount of cayenne pepper by at least half.  It was just a bit too much heat for us. I would also recommend refrigerating the crab cakes for at least a 1/2 hour before cooking to help them stay together.

This was my first time making crab cakes and it was a hit. I did follow another reviewers advice and baked them at 350 for 20 min rather than frying. I used one sleeve of Rits crackers and sauteed some white onion with the green. I didn't have Ol'Bay seasoning so I used my favorite season all, Head Country. I plan to experiment with this one a bit. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! The two things that I liked the most was the use of panko and the fact that they were not over "mayo'ed". The only tip I have is to add the crab meat last and fold it in gently. This will help keep the crab chunky.
thank you for the recipe.

I made these for my husband's birthday (crabcakes are his favorite) and he LOVED them. I'm a vegetarian and it was hard for me to cook without tasting in between, but they turned out pretty good based on my hubby's opinion! 

I mixed all the non-crab ingredients together and then divided the result into two and put them in separate bowls. In one, I used the normal crab, but in the other, I used mashed Northern White beans so that I could eat them--it was fantastic! Tasted like a really good bean burger.

These were great.  I will for sure make again but use fresh crab meat not the stuff our of the can.  I thought it could use more crab in them.  My hubbs and son really liked these too.  I served with Aioli sauce and corn with a green salad.

I've made this recipe twice and the crab cakes came out perfect both times.  I made one small addition of coating the patties with egg first then in the panko crumbs (Panko is better than breadcrumbs).

Instead of making crab cakes, I used this recipe as a stuffing for a seafood dish I was making.  I did add 1/2 cup of shredded colby-jack cheese, and half of a fresh cubanelle pepper, finely diced, for a little extra flavor and crunch.  I intended the pepper to be poblano since I like extra kick but the store did not have any.  I would definitely make this again, either as a stuffing or as crab cakes.  Excellent!

I halved the recipe and made 3 large crab cakes.  I used a 6 oz can of lump crab, dijon mustard instead of dry, about 6 crushed saltines and fresh garlic instead of powder that I sauteed with the green onions.  I kept the 1 egg.  I made the mistake of adding the panko to the mixture instead of coating the outside, but they still turned out really good!  I did not make the aioli as my preference is cocktail sauce.

Yummy! I was leery about my ghetto can of crab (99 cent store special) so I threw in about 8 finely chopped frozen prawns and improvised a bit -- Tabasco-flavored Cheez-its, saltine crackers & bread crumbs, and I skipped the salt & cayenne. No dry mustard. It was amazing!

We loved this.  Really really delicious.  I used prepared mustard, since I didn't have any dry, real garlic instead of garlic powder, and I upped the cayenne.  This is one of those recipes that stands up really well to adjustments based on personal tastes, but is perfect as it is.  I fried half of them, and then baked the other half at 350 for 30 minutes as another reviewer suggested.  The fried crab cakes were definitely prettier, but the baked ones tasted just as good and were less fattening.  Oh, also topped them with aioli - mayo, lemon, paprika, salt.

I've become "famous" for these crabcakes - they are absolutely delicious and now a Christmas tradition that friends and family request!  We do substitute fresh crab legs and shuck them ourselves which is a much better texture than canned meat.  Also I don't use the breadcrumbs to coat the cakes.  Best when made "burger style" and not pattied or handled too much, these are fantastic.

Fantastic. Even though I slightly overcooked the bread crumb coating while frying, my husband has not been able to stop raving about these. I tried them with the fancy crab but will try the lump crab next time, just to see if I can really emulate that restaurant quality and texture. I took the advice of one reviewer and added a little bit of the Old Bay Seasoning to the bread crumbs - liked the result. Served the crab cakes with aioli - mayo, minced garlic and lemon juice - this really made them a great dish. This will be on the regular rotation here. Thanks for a great and easy to make recipe.

I used an 8oz can of special crab meat, a 4oz sleeve of Townhouse crackers, 2T mayo and everything else as written to make the perfect crab cakes. The search is over!

I'm sorry to rain on the five star parade, but this recipe honestly doesn't deserve it.  I didn't realize, until I looked at my box of crackers, that 8oz is almost two sleeves!  Two sleeves of crackers and one 6oz can of crab (which is about the size of a can of tunafish)?  Well, I decided against using the entire amount of crackers and then wound up with only two (not four), medium-sized crab cakes.  Other than that, I followed the directions as stated.  Still, I could not taste the crab.  Don't get me wrong, they actually do taste pretty good.  But they do NOT taste like crab cakes.  If you are considering using this recipe, I recommend going with some of the suggestions on the other reviews that rated five stars.

Very good; I used 2 cans of crab, 2 eggs, and only 20 crackers total. I didn't bother coating the crab cakes in breadcrumbs, and fried them in a mix of olive oil and butter. They browned beautifully, and tasted great with just a squeeze of lemon juice. Next time I make them (and there will be a next time!), I'll serve them with a sauce too.

These turned out very good, especially following the aioli recipe given in the reviews.  (Don't use Miracle Whip for that, though--make sure it's mayonnaise.) I also took some of the advice given and added two cans of crabmeat instead of just one, which turned out well.  I wish we could get fresh crabmeat here, though, as the flavor was a little "fishy" for my tastes with the canned stuff.  Overall, very good and simple!

Just let me add my five stars. This is really good. If you are using packaged imitation crab meat as I did, I suggest squeezing well to drain and then chopping into smaller bits. Thanks...

I made these last night as a special birthday dinner for my fiance and they were quite good. I like the idea of using Ritz crackers combined with bread crumbs. Didn't have Creole mustard so just used regular dry mustard. One other change, I love lobster and crab together in a cake, so added a bunch of fresh lobster meat. Prep was a little longer as I cooked lobsters first then picked them, but worth the extra work. (Here in Maine, lobster in the summertime is quite reasonably priced so I can afford this on occasion.) Use fresh crabmeat as well. One last note, I served these with a creole remoulade and herb salad. I got the remoulade recipe from this site. Just do search for "remoulade" and it should come right up. Very nice meal and my fiance loved it. Even better the next day as leftovers!

Great recipe.  My changes:  Doubled the crab.  Used real garlic.  Put the crackers in whole, and crush them as you mix them in so they don't completely disappear.  Added a dash of worcestershire sauce and a dash of hot sauce.  Didn't coat them in breadcrumbs and baked them at 400F for 15-20 mins instead of frying.  Thanks for sharing.  Will make these again... often!

These crabcakes were just okay.  Firstly, they didn't yield much, I followed the recipe and ended up with three cakes.  Thankfully I was only cooking for one.  Secondly, these crabcakes were short on crab.  Although the taste was better than anticipated, I would add more crab, probably double what is called for.  I did like the taste of the ritz crackers which were a nice tasting filler.

I enjoyed the crab cakes,but I found that they didn't stay together real well. So the next time I will try a extra egg and I think for anyone not like a lot of zing may want to cut back on the cayenne pepper. I also added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. All and all my family did like it and will use again.

I, like other reviewers, added 2 cans of crab. Also another egg (2 total)..and I chopped up the green onion in my mini chopper so they were super small and didn't cook them before adding to the mix. Fabulous results and dang good recipe! I cooked them in my cast iron fry pan for super results! The kids loved these "crabbie patties"!

Just changed a couple of things...only added 6 ounces of crackers to FOUR cans lump crabmeat and doubled all the spices, mayo, eggs and green onions.  After the mixture sat in the fridge for a couple of hours, I formed 20 small cakes (for appetizers), dredged them in the bread crumbs and broiled.  Served with tartar and cocktail sauce...everyone RAVED!!!!

My husband has made this recipe several times and is always asked for the recipe.  He said it is very easy to make.  Served over spring mix lettuce.  We had crab cakes in a fancy restuarant to compare and these were by far much better.  They have now become part of our Christmas Eve appetizer menu.  Thanks

As other cooks have stated: this recipe has way too much filliing. Too much cracker crumbs and bread crumbs. I used more crab than the recipe called for and that is the only thing that made it worth eating. I'm sure there are better recipes out there.

Turned out pretty good! I made a couple changes. Doubled the crab as many suggested. I also used Wheat Thin crackers instead of Ritz to avoid trans fat. The Wheat Thins don't crush as well, but it didn't matter in the end because they soften as the cakes cook. Instead of sauteing the green onions in oil, I just cooked them in the microwave with a touch of water on high for ~1 minute. I served them with a quick version of aioli-- roasted garlic crushed and mixed with mayo, a touch of lemon juice and dijon mustard. Yummy!

These were a hit for dinner last night, served over a bed of caesar salad with pinot grigio and candlelight on my front porch!  I halved the crackers and used fresh crab.  The spices are so tastey!  I also grilled them hoping to make them lower in fat but I thought they were slightly dry.  Next time I will try baking or make a sauce to go with them.  Thanks Rod!

I used the suggestion by a previous reviewer and since I did not have Old Bay added some basil, celery seed, dill weed, lemon juice and worcheshire sauce, also reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/4.  I had imitation crab and put everything in the food processor, pulsed a couple of times, shaped and coated the patties right out of there, thus I dirty nothing else but the skillet.  Great taste, husband and kids loved it.

Thanks for the great recipe!  I used less crackers and imitation crab meat, and they still came out really good.  I served them with a horseradish mustard.  I will be making these again, thanks Rod!

These were great!  However next time I would use more crab and less buttery crackers.  Otherwise they were quick, easy and really flavorful!

Next time, I most definitely would use 2 eggs, double all the spices and use only one package of Ritz crackers, or less. It came out bland and was super breakable with the original recipe. I may try this again but most definitely need to tweak it.

It was OK..I guess there is something about the taste of can crabmeat. I did make a mistake of double breadcrumbing it. And I also baked it. Maybe next time, I will try it with more crabmeat and frying it, rather than baking it.

I have been trying crab cake recipes for 25 years and THIS is the one that beats every crab cake I have made or ordered in a restaurant.   First the appearance. Visually this was a perfect crab cake.  Passed that  test with  flying colors.  The texture is also excellent and taste was outstanding.  I also grilled a rib eye steak for surf and turf for a special Friday night dinner.  My husband enjoyed both but I only only had eyes for those crab cakes which I served with aioli.  Marvelous.  This is only the second recipe I have rated in 25 years.  My search for the perfect crab cake is over.  Last thought.  I did let them rest in the refrigerator 15 minutes between panko dredging and frying.

The cakes will hold their shape if you roll them in panko and chill them for about 30 minutes before cooking,  otherwise, they spread out to a pancake.

I've never had (or made) crab cakes so I don't have anything to compare it to but these were good.  I followed some of the recommendations and used Dijon mustard instead of dry and 2 6oz cans of crab meat.  I think next time I will add extra Old Bay & Garlic, but I tend to like strong flavors so I didn't downrate the base recipe as it is good as is.

These were awesome! I made half the recipe for two and it made 5 cakes. Otherwise I followed the recipe except for some confusion on the crackers. I wasn't sure how many Ritz crackers would make 8 oz. - and I needed 4 oz. The entire box weighed almost 16 oz. I couldn't see adding an entire sleeve. I crushed a few and ended up and kept adding until it looked right - not quite half the sleeve. I served with aioli. My son wants them again tonight and my husband was annoyed he missed them because he was out of town.

You just have to half the amount of crakers, add some seafood boil, i used regular mustard instead of dry...i believe that is about it. OMGOODNESS they were the best i have had. I really thought they would come out too bready or not seafoody/crab taste. I also used half real dark chunky crab meat and half imation flaky crab meat. You couldnot even taste the difference!!!
Instead of doing 10 servings i did 5. I used 17 crakers and put in my bullet blender. oh and i used a whole egg. I hope these sub's work for you...GOOD LUCK!!!
I so will be making these again!!! made 7 but could have made more if I hadnt made them as big as i did.

These are the best crab cakes I have ever made.  I served them on hamburger buns with a little mayo , lettuce and tomatoe.  Makes a great lunch or dinner with a side of cole slaw.

Great recipe!  The only thing that I changed is that I used snow crab legs vs. canned crabmeat.  Shell them while they are still almost frozen and chop.  16oz of crab (as the recipe calls for) is about 2 1/2 snow crabs or 5 clusters.

Wonderful recipe!  I used fresh Lump Crab and added a little lemon juice.  I can't wait to try it with the Planko but I didn't have any so I used Italian bread crumbs.  I also didn't fry but put them in the broiler on a pan covered with Aluminum foil with coated in EVOO for about 5 or so minutes on each side.  My baby LOVED it better than our favorite Crabcake restuarant.

I just made these and the recipe made 6 large cakes. I will say that they came out a little dry and I followed the recipe exactly. I am not an experienced cook so the problem may have been me. The wife said that I should have cooked them a little lower heat. I liked the taste very much but my wife thought the cayenne was a little too heavy for her. All and all it was a good experience for a new cook. *I will try a little more mayo or an extra egg next time I think. Thanks!!

I had never made crab cakes before, but after buying some from Sam's club, I decided I could probably come up with something just as good...this recipe is what I tried.  The only changes I made to this recipe was to change some amounts and add some finely diced Red Pepper...I didn't really measure...just added small amounts until the mixture looked right to me. And as reviewer Jen recommended,  I used two  6-oz cans of crab meat, added 2 eggs, and used approx 20 Ritz crackers. I also used 1/2 tsp of Old Bay since I doubled some other ingredients.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of Panko, which I mixed with a tiny bit of flour.  I also made  the Aioli Sauce that a lot of reviewers were recommending except I only used 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice as I am not really fond of lemon flavor (except in sweet things).  Might not have made any difference at all...lol...but I did it anyway. We really enjoyed the crab cakes..they were deliscious!! A couple people even asked for the recipe when I took one for lunch the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will be using it again and again.

Loved this recipe.  I was a little short on canned crab meat, so I added a sauteed pollock fish filet.  I also added some sauteed diced red pepper.  Delicious!  Will be making these again.  I might add some diced shrimp the next time.

The best crab cake I have tasted.  I think that I will cut back to 1/4 of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Just a wee bit too spicy for me, but other wise like I said the best I have tasted.  Very flavorful.

I made these for my Dad bday dinner and they turned out excellent. I never use exact measurement on spices but these seasonings gave me a great guideline and place to start!!! I also added minced garlic and white pepper for more flavor. I would recommend putting the cakes in the refrigerator before cooking them on the skillet.Thanks for this recipe. I will make it again and again!!!

I made them yesterday, simple, and tasty. I will make them again. I baked them for about 20 minutes at 350 and broiled them another 2 minutes for a crispier top.

Great recipe!  The first time I tried this, they didn't turn out as well.  They crab cakes weren't bad, but they didn't taste quite as I had expected.  Either way, I gave it another try and they turned out great!!  I will definitely be making these again.

i did exactly as the top reviewer Jen did with the crab cakes and it worked brilliantly. made her aioli  as well (that took a big 2 mins to make) used dijon instead od dry mustard, minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and served w fresh salad. WATCH the crab cakes once you put them in the hot oil. abt 2.5 mins a side. they cook QUICKLY!! also expect a little bit of heat from them, but the good "warm you up" kinda heat. yum - 30 minute meal!! made 4 large cakes.

Only change I made was replace the garlic powder with roasted garlic into the mixture.

This is a very good recipes and easy to make.  Followed the recipe for the most part only changed some of the spices.    Used Old Bay Blackening Spice, ground white pepper and the cayenne.  Added chopped shallots to the green onions.  Used fresh cracked Dungeness crab.  Also used a little more mayonnaise and two eggs for the binder.  Using hands place a small ball (palm sized) between hands and flatten and round edges keeping even thickness.  Cover second plate in Panko crumbs.  Take the crab cake and press into crumbs and coat both sides.  Cook using olive oil.  In a non-stick pan drizzle olive oil and heat to shimmer.  Add three cakes at a time browning each side.  Approximate cook time 2 minutes per side.  While cooking one batch you can prep the next cakes to cook.  This is a fast and easy recipe.  Nicely spiced and not over powering distracting from the crab.

I always make a recipe the first time exactly as written and then will modify if necessary.  We enjoyed the flavor of these crab cakes but thought there was too much "filler" overpowering the delicate flavor of the crab.  The next time, I'll try 6 oz of crackers, and who knows, that might even have to be reduced to 4 oz. to suit our taste.

I don't care for seafood, but my husband said these were as good as any he has had in a restaurant.  I made a couple of alterations:  double the mayonnaise, add 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper, add another egg, and add 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce.  I served it with garlic aioli.

The panko crumbs were a dud. It makes the cakes crusty like fried chicken, which while sounding good in theory doesn't work for the delicate flavor and textures required for crab.   I'm happy to say mashed crackers worked well. I used a package of Ritz and about 6 buttery toll house, just to mix things up. It was a delicate mix between moist and dry, so I added half of a scrambled egg to the mix to balance it out.   Next time I'll just steer towards a different recipe that respects a delicate crab.

I made a few modifications, but these turned out great! I took the advice of another review and only added 3.5oz of buttery crackers, and added two eggs instead of one. I didn't have dry mustard, so I used about one teaspoon of regular yellow mustard and it was delicious. I only used 4 green onions, and also sauteed a stock of celery (finely diced). I used fresh crab meat instead of canned. It was fabulous! I served it with garlic aioli. YUM!

I used Canola oil, it's what I had on hand, I did not saute my gr onions, didn't have time. I used imitation crab, I love crab legs and wouldn't usually use fake crab for cakes.....but....it's what I had. I used prepared mustard, Club brand crackers, no salt or pepper and seasoned bread crumbs.  Once again, it looks like I created my own recipe, but I use what I have so I don't have more ingrediants that I have to use up.  Anyway.  This turned out delish.  I threw the immitation crab in the food processor and removed, then the gr onions and removed, then the crackers and removed.  I mixed all the ingrediants together, patted them out, rolled them in the bread crumbs and refridgerated them for a couple hours so they didn't fall apart.  The extended fam like these, my 2 yo "complained" they were "too spicy"  I served these with Garlic Aioli sauce, found on this site.  Repeat recipe

Great Recipe. It was too dry so I added 1/2 cup of prepared horseradish sauce! Yummy! Next time I won't roll in breadcrumbs before frying as it is just a little too much breading for my taste. Perfect!

Very very tasty and so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it.  The only change I may make next time is adding more crackers to the mix as it was on the wet side, but that's just a matter of personal taste.  Will definitely keep this one and make again.

So quick and easy.  Only mistake I made was having someone else "drain" the crabmeat for me...and the crab cakes came out a bit wet and were a difficult to make into patties.  I will definitely try this again!  Did not have old bay seasoning so I added extra garlic powder and whatever spices I had on hand.

I've made these several times using Dungeness crabs.  My only change is to not saute the onions, and fry them in butter instead of oil.  I can taste a big diffeence.  This is a great recipe!

This was my first attempt at crab cakes and they were demolished with rave reviews! I followed the recipe as stated except i used minced garlic and sauteed the garlic with the green onions.  I also added some celery and yellow onion, just a little of each.  They were amazing! Thank you for the great recipe!

These were very good!  Very simple with lots of flavor.  We had boilded snow crab legs the night before and couldn't quite eat them all, so we used the leftovers to make these.  Served them with a remoulade sauce.  Tasty

Yum Yum Yum!  I listened to the other reviews (thank you!) and put only 2 ounces of crackers. From my point of view, 8 ounces is way too much. Enjoy!

This was a huge disappointment! I love crab cakes, and was thrilled to make these. They were more like cracker cakes than crab cakes. If I decide to attempt these again I will doubt the crab (at least) and still cut down on some of the crackers...

I have another crab cake recipe that has some good tips -- first and foremost - use good crab! If you can't find (or don't want to take the time) for fresh crab meat, Phillips brand (black can w/ red writing - I have found it in Costco)-a 16 oz can and use it all! - is the best canned crab. Starkist is awful and will ruin crab cakes. The other secret is to shape the cakes and then put them in the fridge for several hours so they don't fall apart when you cook them - I usually make them in the morning, put them on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet, and refrigerate until I'm ready to cook them that evening. In some of the other reviews, a mixture of oil and butter (the other recipe I have recommends clarified butter, but I'm too lazy) is recommended -- I agree that makes a huge difference! OBTW, my "other" recipe calls for 1 cup of fine (fresh) bread crumbs mixed in to the crab mixture, and 1 cup for coating the cakes (4-5 pieces of bread chopped into fine crumbs in a food processor).

Great seasoning if you halve the cayenne, but WAY too much cracker crumbs. I was already into it when I realized how much 8 oz. is. If I'd known, I would have found a different recipe.

Great recipe, doesn't need any changes at all! The only thing I did different was that I flash deep fried them in a deep fryer at 360 degrees for a minute and a half instead of cooking them in oil over the stove - success!

I followed the recipe exactly as instructed and I think they are fantastic!!! There is no reason to tamper with this recipe they were a huge hit with my husband and brother and me!!!! I loved these so much I made them 2 days in a row. The seasonings really gave it an extra kick and i love kick! Love these crab cakes will definitely be making them again in the future.

This is a great recipe. I read some of the other reviews and cut the cayenne pepper some because I can't handle too spicy. I also substituted low-fat crackers to help out with the nutrition facts on this one. They were really great, and my husband couldn't stop saying how great they were. It's nice to be able to make these at home instead of spending fifteen bucks for two at a restaurant. I will definitely be making these again! What a great ending to a great day!

These were a hit!!  I used sweet onion (sauteed w/heaping tsp lobster boullion) and minced garlic (I also used 8oz imitation crab as we're on a budget- didn't have real crab on hand.) - and I sprayed with a bit of olive oil, baked at 425 for approx 7 min on one side, flipped for another 7-8 until golden.  I will make again!!

This is the best crab cake recipe.  I love it and so does everyone who eats them.  I use panko bread crumbs on the outside and it makes a BIG difference in how crispy they get.  SO GOOD.  If crab wasn't so expensive I would make them all the time!

I made these crab cakes the first time and made a mistake on the recipe.  They were awesome!  For those who mentioned that they don't taste crabby enought, do what I now do every time.  Leave out the crackers all together, drain the crab meat REALLY well (press water out with paper towels if needed) and let the crab meat soak up the seasoning/egg/mayo mixture for about 10 minutes. Then create the patties, coat in bread crumbs and pan fry as directed.  For 4 servings you will need to double the ingredients (except for the unnecessary crackers and the bread crumbs for coating).  So much better, less doughy and salty too!

These were great.  I only made 2 slight changes.  1st I soaked the breadcrumbs in the egg/mayo to soften them up a little.  And for the other set of breadcrumbs (the coating), I used Panko.  They came out delicious!!

I never liked crabcakes before, but decided to try these (I really liked the use of Old Bay seasoning and just about doubled the amount recommended). These are surprisingly easy to make and so very tasty!  The aioli sauce is a MUST - it really accentuates the flavor. I've made these with both canned and frozen crab, and I will make next time with live crab - it should be ridiculous!

This recipe was wonderful!  A lot of crab cakes have the super fishy taste, but these ones had just the right flavor.  I definitely would recommend cutting down on the crackers, as it causes the crab cakes to be very dry and crumble when you are cooking them.  I added a couple tablespoons of olive oil to the mix to moisten it more.  Also -- make sure you brown them enough, as it really makes the flavor!

This recipe was excellent! I do recommend alittle more Old Bay, however. In addition, I thought the 8 oz. of crackers a bit too much. I only used 5 oz', and it was plenty.

Other than that, these crab cakes are some of the best I have ever had, and I know my crab cakes.

I just made these, and they sure are tasty!

Just two things. First, I would *greatly* reduce the amount of ritz crackers added to this. If you doubled her recipe, you'd have to add one WHOLE BOX of ritz crackers. I just made the recipe with triple the ingredients except for the 8oz (Two sleeves!)of Ritz crackers, and I still think it's too much.

I found it hard to mold them into patties that wouldn't fall apart, so I fried half of them, and baked the other half in a muffin pan like another poster mentioned.

I made them too big in the muffin tin, so they're more like crab muffins. I liked the taste of them better when they were fried.

These were good.  I followed some advice from others and used 2 cans of crab (1 lump, 1 fancy white).  I only used 1/2 a column of crackers and ground them up with green onions in my food processor.  I cut back on the cayenne but added some hot pepper sauce and some Worcestshire sauce.  They were just perfect.

Per other reviews, I added an extra egg and another can of crab meat. I doubled the seasonings because of the extra can of crab. I like to squeeze fresh lime over my crab cakes before I eat them.

I've made this three times in the past month, and it always gets raves.  I doubled the crab meat per the suggestions of other reviewers.  I also used about 2/3 sleeve of Keebler club crackers, and substituted white onion instead of green onion because I had it on hand. Delicious!  The cayenne gives it a gentle kick that makes it special.

These are my and my husband's favorite crab cakes ever! I do make a few changes, just because of personal taste. I use 2 cans of crab instead of 1, decrease the garlic powder by half and increase the Old Bay to 1/2 teaspoon. When frying the crab cakes, I like to add about a tablespoon of butter to the olive oil for extra flavor. So yummy!

Great recipe but I would also agree with other reviewers that there is way too much breading and I still used only a half a cup of breadcrumbs.  Kept the rest of the ingredients as written.  If it was not for that, I would definetly rate this recipe a 5.  I would do everything the same next time I make, but next time I will double up on the crab.  The taste is wonderful but it needs more crab taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I've been waiting for a recipe like this for a while.  It is fabulous!!  I found LUMP CRAB IN THE FOIL PACKETS like tuna comes in in the seafood cooler of Wal-Mart for around $5 per pack.  We used 2 packs, 1 sleeve whole wheat ritz crackers & no bread crumbs.  The pack crab is so worth the additional $3 per package.  There is no draining involved.  We made tartar sauce with a little mayo, sweet pickle relish, Old Bay, and lemon juice.  It was better than crab cakes I've paid big bucks for!!

This recipe was wonderful.  When I made the recipe as listed, it seemed too dry to make cakes so I added an extra egg.  It turned out delicious.  I would add extra crab in the future.  All four of us-- including sons age 4 and 2-- LOVED this recipe!!

Didn't have any crab on hand, so I used leftover shrimp which I whirled in the food processor and continued with the recipe. I replaced the crackers with bread crumbs and coated the cakes with flour. Thanks Rod, we loved it!

Made this recipe last night.  Wonderful!!  However, since I was using 1# of backfin crabmeat I used 2 Tbs of mayo and a heaping 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay. Also, as many others used only 4 oz. of Ritz. Used Panko breadcrumbs instead of reg. crumbs.  This is definately a keeper. This made 6 good sized cakes.

These were great, but you definetly have to use 2 cans of crab meat if you want to have 4 servings!
I also added chopped fresh red pepper for color as well as taste, more cracker crumbs and more mayo. Use your judgement if you're an experienced cook....They are scrumptious!!!

This is by far the best I've ever made, I did leave out the bread crumbs, and I used Ritz Crackers (half of the original amount).
My 13 month old daughter loved them. You got to try these........ Great job Rob!!!!!!

I made these and my family love them… I knew right off the bat that there were too many crackers so I used about 3/4 of the amount… Next time, I would even cut it to half. I also put 2 teaspoons of old Bay in leu of any additional salt and pepper because we love Maryland crabcakes. When I pulled the crabcakes from the pan, I sprinkled some additional old Bay on top. They were delicious and I will definitely be making them again!

They need a little more of the spices added to them. The second time I made them I used the air fryer. Still very good!

This recipe is amazing....especially paired with the Sriracha Aioli Sauce on this site. My kids even love this recipe and they are so picky...we call them Krabby Patties though so they dont focus on the fact its actually Crab....LOL. Great bonding time forming the patties out too.. Definately a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe doesn't say to use lump crab meat, so I just used the regular canned crab (the fine stuff).  This recipe does not work for that.  I used less that 1/2 the crackers and that's what these "crab cakes" tasted like--crackers!  I wouldn't use this recipe, again, unless I had lump crab.

My first time making crab cakes.  it went well.  I love looking at reviews and taking the ideas putting them together.  my changes: I didn't have Ritz (used Saltines)however instead of the Mayo I used Miricle Whip this helped because the Ritz have a sweet taste so the Whip did double duty.  I didn't have mustard (lost the new bottle nor Old Bay (I'll get it next time.  I eliminated the salt because of the saltines.  Otherwise this was a good first start.  thank you to all of the other reviews they are most helpful.

I was surprised that canned crab could taste so good. I used one 6 oz can lump and a 6 oz of white. I left the white crab meat in chunks. 
I used a little less than half of the crackers. The panko adds a nice crunch. Good recipe!

This was SO good! I did not have any Old Bay Seasoning and the taste was still great. I did refrigerate after mixing and again after forming patties. I added one additional egg because I thought it looked a little dry and would help with holding together. Served with Garlic Aioli. I would definitely use the real crab meat and not attempt with the imitation. Can't wait to make again!

Love, love love this recipe.  I do reduce the Ritz crackers to one sleeve and double the mayo, but everything else is the same and they turn out great every time.  The Panko adds a crispy crust.  Thanks!

I did make some changes per other suggestions, and they came out fantastic! I used two cans of lump crab meat, two eggs, and two tbs of mayo, and the rest of the recipe ingredients remained as written. I don't know why some people say 8 oz. of crackers is two sleeves, it was only one sleeve for me and it worked out perfect with the added crab and egg. I think they definitely would have been too dry if not for doubling up on the wet ingredients, though.

Outstanding recipe!  The flavors were awesome.  Best crab cakes I've ever had.  At first I was scared of the long list of ingredients, but it really wasn't that bad and went pretty fast up until the frying.  The first batch I accidentally fried in sesame oil and those were the best, but not sure if sesame oil is really a good choice for frying.  ??  I can't wait to make again.

Everyone in my family liked them. They are very tasty and they had the right amount of crab. As many reviews suggested, I used 2 eggs instead and they held together nicely. The Panko bread crumbs gave them a nice texture. I will definately make them again.

Turned out very well.  Very rich, made a few changes, added flour to the outsides as well as normal bread crumbs before frying, and skipped the mayo but used wet mustard instead.  Next time I am going to use more onions, less and healthier crackers, and perhaps bake them but DELICIOUS!

Too cakey according to my crab cake-obsessed husband.  Flavor was good though, and they held together well with an additional egg.  Still searching for the perfect recipe.

I had the opportunity to study in South America and was looking for a recipe similar to one at a restaurant back at home.  I made this to let my host family know exactly how I like my crab cakes, with a vodka sauce and ravioli.  They had me make it at least five times over for friends and relatives and boasted about how gourmet the dish is...South America loves your crab cakes!! XD

I had never even eaten crab before I tried these. They were fantastic! I used the garlic aioli recipe on here, but my lemon juice was expired and putrid so I just used garlic and mayo. Delicious. YUM YUM YUM

I don't like Crab so I made these for my fiance as a treat. He doesn't like onions so I ommited them and used onion powder and I didn't have Panko on hand so I used italian premade bread crumbs. Also I used fresh crab from the seafood section of the grocery store (although it take a little more time to make since you have to clean out the bones of the crab). He loved them and they have a little kick with the cayenne pepper! Will def make again.

Well, it was my first time making crab cakes.  I did read other reviews - especially the bad ones and I am glad I did.  Yes, I had to cut back on crumbs and increase the quantity of crab as explained by bad reviews.  Also, the flavor was very bland and I thought it needed more spice/heat - but then, my family eats very spicy food.  Overall they were fine, but not great.
Also, don't replace panko bread crumbs with regular ones....panko gives the best crunch!!

This is the best crab cake recipe I've ever tried. very flavourful and tender. I suggest giving the canned crabmeat a very good compression, to drain all the excess water out. It will make the egg work better in binding the patties together.

Great recipe. We liked it better cold, with a sprinkling of lemon juice.  It would also make a great wrap (with romano letucce and avocado).

So easy and so delicious. Careful with the cayenne pepper, I halved it and it was still a lil too spicy for me. I didn't use as many crackers, just whatever I had left which was almost a full roll. I also added an extra egg to help the mixture come together.

These were amazing! Simple to prepare, fast and easy to cook, and delicious. There's no need to saute the green onions first; just chop them up and add them right to the mix. Adjust the cayenne pepper depending on your tolerance for spice - I like spicy foods but 1/2 teaspoon might be too much for some people.

I had never made crab cakes before, but this recipe was very easy and DELICIOUS.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I used lump crab meat from the seafood section at the store.  I went a little light on the green onions (just personal preference), and heavy on the cayenne pepper and Old Bay.  I used one sleeve of reduced fat Town House crackers.  I didn't measure the olive oil, just used what looked appropriate.  I served the crab cakes over a bed of bagged coleslaw with a lemon wedge and tartar sauce.  I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again.

This was my first time making crab cakes.  I took advice of other reviewers and only used 4 ounces of buttery round crackers.  I also added in an additional tablespoon of mayonnaise to help cakes form better.  The whole family loved them!  Next time I will try to make a spicy sauce to go with them.

After pulling fresh dungeness from Puget sound waters, I was in search of an easy but delicious recipe for crab cakes. I'm sure our fresh crab had something to do with it, but this recipe is a keeper. As good as the cakes I've had in Seattle's best seafood restaurants. Now, if only I could get someone else to crack crab!!

They were pretty good! Even better the next day.  Be careful since it says salt to taste, I forgot some of the other ingredients contribute salt, such as the crackers,  dont just give it a shake, taste first.

I loved these a lot with very few changes to the way the recipe is written. I also used just one sleeve (4 oz)of Ritz,crushed them in my mini food processor and thought it was just right. I omitted the green onions altogether and doubled up on the Old Bay. I got 12 good sized cakes. I put them in the fridge for a little while to set up before frying and they turned out great!

this was super tasty. just as good as the ones at any high end restaurant.  However, i put more onions to taste and flattened the crab cake more prior to frying. that way it fries thoroughly!

This was a great recipe. If you prefer a crab cake that is more crabby than cakey, this is the recipe to use. As always, I would recommend using the real thing rather than canned crabmeat. I also ended up adding a little water (maybe 1/4 cup) to make the mixture more cohesive. Very easy to make, and very delicious. Try it with a good remoulade recipe!

So easy and really good.  My husband said they are the best he has ever had and he is not one to hold back when something I make doesn't work.  We put them in a sandwich with aioli and it was awesome.  Making them tonight for husband's grandfather and he is a crabber so it will be interesting to see what he thinks.

ok, usually i do not eat or like seafood but after making these i am converted. these were delicious and amazing and easy. i was hesitant because i have never cooked with crab or used bread crumbs but they turned out simply delicious. I followed the advice of other reviews and made aioli sauce to pair with the cakes and the two together was like heaven. i highly recommend making both. i will be making these again very soon.

This was my first time making crab cakes and I was pretty pleased with myself! I put about 12 Ritz crackers in a Ziploc sandwich bag and pounded with a meat mallet. I made sure to squeeze out all the liquid in the canned crab by taking an amount of crab that could fit into my palm and giving it a good squeeze. I used an additional egg in my mixture, coated the patties in panko and used approximately 2 tbsp of olive oil to fry until golden. Served with garlic aioli.  Will make again!

Very good. This was my first time making crab cakes and I was very happy with the results. I used the fresh 16oz tub of backfin crab. I modified the recipe a little, for my own liking. I used whole wheat Ritz crackers, about 3/4 of the tube and ground it up with some fresh-frozen chives and dried parsley (didn't have fresh). I couldn't decide between mustard powder and prepared dijon, so I used both.  I used 1/2 tspn of garlic pwdr because ours is very strong. I omitted the cayenne and added a little smokey paprika. I added a healthy dash of Worcestershire sauce. I coated a couple of them with Panko bread crumbs and left the others plain since the other recipes don't call for coating with breadcrumbs and I wasn't sure which way to go. Around here in MD the really frown on using much bc at all. My husband and I both thought they were better with the Panko crumbs. They make a nice crunchy crust. The ones without them formed a crust too, but it crusted the crab meat and we think it's a waste of the goodness. I read other reviews from people who made these but baked them. I think next time I'll try doing that. Although, they cam out nice and crispy - perfect-not greasy, pan frying in a small amount of extra light (delicate flavored) Bertoli olive oil.  I have also never fried anything  before and was glad they weren't greasy.

I was disappointed. :( I wanted these to wow me since everyone else loved them, but no way.n they are too dense with crushed crackers and it takes away from the flavor of the cake (and I even upped Old Bay and Cayenne). I will make then again, no time soon, and take the recommendations and use ONE sleeve of crackers not two(8 oz.).

This is an amazing recipe! I made my own rendition after reading through the reviews. I swapped out things like crushed garlic cloves, dijon mustard, wheat ritz and breadcrumbs. The spices and cayenne make this recipe gold!

Loved it and so did my family!  The only thing I changed was I added a 1/4 cup of finely chopped red and green pepper that I sauteed with the green onion because I think everything looks more appetizing with a little color.  The panko bread crumbs were perfect for a crisp coating on the outside.  YUM!

This recipe is the best yet , though I would use fresh crabmeat. I came across cakes that were made with shrimp instead of crabmeat on gourmetdistrict.com. that were quite the same taste.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! My first time making these crab cakes, and they were EXCELLENT! I doubled up on all seasonings, because I like my food highly seasoned and flavorful. The cakes came out perfect! This was my 1st 5 Star Rating on this site.

These were really good-my boyfriend LOVED them :)  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand and a few personal preferences. I added more green onions than were called for, just because we love them so much, and fried them in butter instead of the oil. I also used dejion mustard instead of dry mustard and chili powder and paprika (I didn't have cayenne pepper or dry mustard). I also put some of the spices included in the recipe in the bread crumbs as well. Delicious!

I love this recipe. I have also substituted tuna instead of crab. works great!! Beware of using too many crackers, or it will taste like a fried townhouse cracker!

Thank you for this recipe, it is wonderful!  I love to cook, but for some reason I always thought crab cakes were something I wouldn't be able to do right at home, thus they were always something I would order if we went out to eat.  Now I don't have to order crab cakes out anymore!  These are some of the best crab cakes I've had, hands down.  We had them on New Year's Eve and they were fabulous.    I served them with a lemon wedge and spicy mayo (siracha mixed with mayo, yum)!

I use this site quite alot and never usually write reviews, but I made this yesterday to bring to my bf's family for an Italian Xmas Eve dinner and it was a hit!   I followed the recommendations from other reviews and doubled the crabmeat while using less butter crackers because you're also rolling it in the unseasoned bread crumbs so you dont want to lose the taste of the crab. Also didn't use as much cayenne and that was perfect because you got a little taste of it at the end but not to much that it overwhelmed you. Since crabmeat is a bit pricey and since I was multiplying this recipe by 6, I mixed it up and got pink crabmeat, fancy white and lump in equal portions, the pink crabmeat is the lowest quality but I think it helped with the consistency of the cake.  The garlic aioli was good and easy to make, just used mayo, lemon and roasted some garlic. Another good sauce we tried was mayo and roasted red peppers blended together.   We also made the cakes alot smaller for appetizer sized portions and that helped with ease of cooking, I was worried it would be mushy inside but they were simply marvelous...thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.

What a great recipe! Easy, fast and really good flavor!  I didn't have the green onions, so I sauteed some yellow in a tab of butter.  A fave in the house!

Made these yesterday and they were so yummmm. I did follow others advises and made a few changes. I did not saute the onions. Used normal mustard instead of dray since i didn't have any. Used a a bin of Phillips crab mean 16 oz, 2 eggs instead of 1, 16 Ritz crackers since i really didn't want to add too much, omitted the cayenne pepper and coated them with a bit of panko before frying. Came out perfect. I made 8 good size cakes.

I loved this recipe!  I've made crabcakes before, but never one where you breaded them after mixing (typically the ingredients were all mixed at once).  This made all the difference in the world.  I served this with some fresh homemade guac, but preferred them alone.  Delicious!

My 16 year old is a crab cake fanatic, so I knew that this recipe was a winner when he gave them a big thumbs up.  Taste just like restaurant cakes and so much easier than I thought they'd be.  Delicious!

8 oz of crackers is two whole sleeves. I believe it should read two cups? Which would be too much. I didn't read any reviews that noted this discrepancy. This ruined a can of crabmeat.

Yum! I made a few tiny changes.  Used frozen imitation crab meat and threw it into the food processor.  Also chopped onion in food processor instead of sauteing.  And i stretched it with some sticky rice.  Didn't cover with crumbs.  And i served it with a mayonnaise-lemon sauce (lemon juice and zest with old bay seasoning and cayenne).

This is a great crab cake recipe.  If you truly want to taste the crab this is the recipe to use.  I have also used precooked shark instead of crab and it was fabulous.

Made a few adjustments and followed Top Reviewer (Lucky/Sami)'s recommendations:  2 6oz. cans crabmeat  2 eggs 1 sleeve of ritz crackers 1/2 tsp. Old Bay seasonings   All other ingredients, I kept the same. I did not saute my green onions in oil.   Next time I make these, I will not coat the patties in bread crumbs as using one whole sleeve or more of Ritz crackers gives it the coating it needs to be pan fried.  These were good!

These are a winner.   I upped the crab and cut the crackers, and made the cakes about 30 minutes before cooking so that I could chill them in the refrigerator.  I serve them Benedict style, on greens and topped with a poached egg and hollendaise sauce.  It's a nice contrast and the egg and sauce help counter the spice.

These should have been called "cayenne cracker cakes."  I even cut the cayenne way back and it still drowned out the delicate crab flavor and the fun Old Bay flavor.  There was also nowhere near enough crab meat.  I respectfully suggest finding another crab cake recipe.

double the crab, use tha panko instead of bread crumbs, add the butter as others have suggested along with the olive oil, don't add the Bay seasoning (unless you are a major fan), and you will have the MOST AMAZING crab cakes EVER!  The aoli sauce of mayo, lemon, garlic, s & P, and a bit of sambol olek was out of this world.  These are better than the Metropolitin grill, downtown Seattle, and any cake we've had in Maryland.  Easy and delicious!  (yes, I had fresh crab)

This recipe is by far one of my fav's on this site.  I did follow the modifications listed by Lucky/Sami and it was great also the recipe for aioli sauce (which is now my favorite) is a must for these cakes!!

Love this recipe!  It's so yummy and easy to make.  I've made this for my boyfriend and he loves it.  Although, one time I made an error in the prep that actually worked well so I do ti all the time:  I MIXED in the breadcrumbs with the crab mixtrue instead of coating the patties.  I like the fact that the coating was not heavily breaded, and the flavor is phenomenal.

This recipe was really good and simple to make! I added a 1/4 diced red bell pepper for extra taste and some color. I sauted these with a couple Tbsp. chopped onion(didn't have green onion at the time) and a couple cloves of garlic (instead of the garlic powder) in about 1-2 Tbsp. olive oil. I only had 1/2 sleeve Ritz crackers so I added 1/2 sleeve Saltines and it worked fine(two sleeves seemed too much for me). I also substituted 1 Tbsp.Dijon mustard for the dry mustard and increased the Old Bay and decreased the cayenne pepper for my taste. I do suggest letting the crab cake mixture sit in the fridge for at least 15-20 minutes, they hold up better and are easier to fry. I left out the bread crumb coating and just fried them as is in a mixture of 1 Tbsp. butter and 3 Tbsp. olive oil. The butter added a bit of richness. I really loved how the red bell pepper enhanced the flavor, I highly recommend adding them. I served it with a homemade aioli. These crab cakes rock!

My husband and I thought these were very good. We used imitation krab and panko bread crumbs for the outside. The only problem we had was keeping them from falling apart before they hit the hot oil. Once they started cooking, they were fine, but it some of them almost didn't make it that far. We added a tablespoon or two of flour into the mixture and that seemed to help.

I made these for my husband and he said the flavor was good, but there was too much filler and breading on the outside.  He prefers more focus on the crab, less on the crackers, bread crumbs, etc.

I'd like to give these 5 stars for flavor and 3 stars for texture.  I will absolutely use this recipe again because the spices were excellent with the dippin' sauce everyone's talking about.  However, there wasn't enough crab and there was way too much cracker filling.  I'd double or triple the amount of crab and use perhaps 1/3 to 1/4 of the cracker crumbs.  I used a can of Trader Joe's crab and I highly recommend it.  It had nice chunks of meat - not stringy stuff like some canned crab brands.

I love crab cakes, have eaten them at restaurants across the US, and think these are great! I made a few simple changes that really jazzed them up. I added a 3oz pouch of lump crab meat, only used about 10 Ritz crackers, added the juice of half a fresh lemon, two tablespoons of capers, and some extra Old Bay and Red Pepper. I was out of dry mustard so I used some prepared brown mustard. I was also out of garlic powder, so I substituted garlic salt and left out the table salt. I made a remoulade-esque sauce by processing mayonnaise, fresh lemon juice, capers, and some old bay to taste. Delicious!

My family and I loved this recipe. I also opted for minced white onion instead of green. I got a little carried away with the cayenne but it was terrific. I made in on my GF grill with some homemade tartar sauce and served these cakes with mashed yukon golds and green peas. A nice simple, yet yum, meal!

WOW!  These are superb!  I agree with others that the crakers make them taste so good with the crab.  I made the "basic beurre blanc" to go with these and they were heaven!!  I only added a tad more Old Bay & used yellow onions instead of green but other than that follwed the recipe!  DELICIOUS!  **update*** made these again for the 2nd time, they are fool proof and very quick & easy to make, I pattied these up larger then before used a can of backfin meat, a can of special, and a tin can of crabmeat (by the tuna)....still tasted great!

I wish I had read some reviews before making these. With 8oz (2 sleeves) of ritz crackers - way too many crackers. My wife described these as tasting like "already chewed crackers fried". They probably would have been ok with half the crackers, but honestly I would have done just as well or better with the recipe on the Old Bay box or even the one on the crab package.

Like most people, I modified the recipe liberally.  That said, my result turned out FANTASTIC, and I owe it all to this recipe for getting me started on the right track.  The green onions really set this recipe above the other crab cakes.

Made this for a potluck this year, and these crab cakes were a big hit!! Did not saute the green onions in oil, but mixed it all together along with the egg and crab mixture.  Great with garlic mayonaise sauce.

I have to say that the flavor was good, but not great.  There were FAR too many crackers.  I even used two cans of crab and one pouch (if you see them in the grocery store, get the pouch!!! its jumbo lump and tastes as close to fresh as you'll find). I would make these again, but next time i will half the amount of crackers.  Like someone said, these were very good "cracker cakes".

Added lots of old bay seasoning, might have been too much.  Didn't use mustard, and combined it with some fake crab meat.

Wow!  My husband was so impressed - they were far better than most we've had in restaurants.  I did follow the advice of others and added a 2nd can of crab.  I used one can of shredded crab and one of lump crab.  I also accidentally used about half the amount of cracker crumbs - and I was happy with the results.

This is a great recipe I cut it in half. I only had Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used those instead of ritz crackers.  I also used about 1 T. minced onion and bell pepper.  I can't wait to make this recipe again.

Not enough crab taste....to much cracker taste! My husband and I order crab cakes at EVERY Restaraunt we go to that serves them...so I consider ourselves to have pretty good taste. I made 6 servings and used 1/2 of the Ritz crackers the recipe calls for and it was still to much "fill" I would suggest adding more crab meat and onions rather than bulk up on the ritz. Overall this recipe was "ok" but I think next time Ill try a different one. However the "Crab Cake Sauce" was really good!

The hot pepper and garlic overwhelmed the delicate crab.  I tried again using half the pepper and garlic.  I used Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  Very good base recipe.  They held together well while frying. Tune the spices to your liking.

Came out a little dry.  Granted, I did make a lot of modifications.  I broiled instead of fried, and used only one sleeve of ritz crackers for 16 oz lump crabmeat.  Doubled all the other ingredients.  Left out the breadcrumbs.  Probably could have used more mayo.

Delicious!! My husband said these are the best crab cakes that he has ever eaten. I made three changes...I used less crackers, an extra can of crabmeat & some lemon juice.

This recipe was a big hit!  I made these for Fathers Day, Doubled the recipe and used a few tips that I found on the site here, like doubling the crab meat, was well worth it.  My Gavone Brother scarfed down 6 of them!!!  And he doesn't eat bad food!  I did bake them, came out wonderful, crispy and everything.  Just spray your pan with some olive oil, and spray the cakes with it as well.  Also spray on the flip, 15 mins per side. Thanks for the Great Recipe!

I mostly followed this recipe. I forgot and mixed in the bread crumbs, but I had some seasoned stuffing mix that I crushed and added to the outside before frying. It was scrum-deli-icious!!!

11/17/08 - Just made this again and again I mostly followed the recipe. Still 5 stars!

I think these crab cakes are wonderful!!  I did change it a bit, and used only half or so of the amount of crackers suggested.  I tried both versions of reviewers with/without bread crumbs.  For my personal taste I found I like the bread crumb coating better. I also added less cayenne, because I did think it over powered the crab flavor.  They fried up beautifully and  reminded me of these crab cakes I had down in NC at the Annual Seafood Festival. Give this recipe a try!!

These were good and very filling!  I bought jumbo lump canned crab.  It's more expensive, but results in a great dish.

I love these crab cakes!  I double up on the crab and use two cans and this makes them extra tasty.  Also, I am sure to buy the highest quality canned crab I can.  I tried adding extra old bay one time but we found it too spicy.  These are so easy to make and taste so good!

OK hands down the BEST crab cakes I've ever had where of course in Maryland. But these are so outrageously good they come a close second and so quick and easy to make!

Fantastic!!! I am a total novice in the kitchen and this recipe turned out awesome!
I read many of the reviews and did a  little tweaking based on their suggestions.  I used 2 cans of crab, 2 eggs, 2tbsp Mayo, 1 sleeve of reduced fat Ritz (its a little more than 8oz, but it's really to just grab the sleeve and crush... no measuring) I also added more Old Bay than it called for ( I figure the M'Landers know their crabcakes)
I coated the patties in breadcrumbs,  sprayed butter flavored PAM on each side then baked them in the oven at 375 for 15 min per side, spraying again with the flip. I served them atop a spring green salad and got rave reviews! I don't think you lose any flavor or texture by baking, instead of frying so this is a good option for dieters. Thanks to all who contributed.

My boyfriend and I have tried making crab cakes before and were extremely unsuccesful so we were hesitant to try these.  They turned out FANTASTIC!  We made enough for leftovers, but there were none.  We baked them as other reviews suggested and also made the lemon aioli.  Served on a bed of spring salad mix.  Inexpensive and delish! Thanks!

These were tasty though we thought there were just too many crackers in the recipe.  It made for a VERY mild crab flavor.

These were really tasty!  I followed the recipes exactly with the exception of using only 4 oz of crackers (I like less filling) and 1/2 c of bread crumbs.  I especially liked the extra kick from the cayenne pepper.  Thanks!

I only had a 16 oz can of phillips crab meat on hand so I had to change up the recipe a bit.  I only used 20 crushed butter crackers, and doubled everything else.  Instead of bread crumbs I coated the outside of the crab cakes with crushed corn flake crumbs ans when frying i added a little butter to the oil.  These crab cakes turned out nice and crispy on the outside and very very good.  My guests tonight raved about them and all asked for the recipe.  I served the crab cakes with the sauce that lucy (top reviewer) recommended in her review.  THe sauce made these crab cakes awesome! Thanks Lucy!

Delicious! Thank you so much for this recipe. We did not have green onions on hand but we love red onions so used them. Nonetheless, they were great. I just added the crackers until the were a perfect molding consistency, don't know how much. That would be my advice. 8oz seemed like alot. Thanks again!

I love these crab cakes. I like to have them in the morning with toast. They are also a great appetizer or a great main dish. My boyfriend and 2 year old also love them. No changes needed for this recipe. It is perfect just the way it is written.

These are so yummy and easy.  One change I made was to finely dice red peppers and saute them w/ the green onions.  I also cut back just a bit on the cayenne pepper.  I also didn't have dry mustard so I used spicy brown mustard that I already had.

These are excellent! I modified the recipe slightly by coating the cakes in corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs, that gave them a nice golden color. I also skipped the cayenne pepper and garlic powder and added 1/2 tsp of low salt Old Bay instead. As far as the crackers I used 15 reduced fat ritz and 10 saltines. I attempted to only add one egg but after mixing, the mix was a bit dry so I added another one.  Oh and last but not least I used one 6oz can of lump crab and one 6oz can of fancy white crab. As other reviewers pointed out these don't need  as much oil to cook in as called for, just coat the bottom of the pan with olive and oil and add a Tbls of butter. Great crab both myself and my husband loved them!!

So so so SOOOOO good!  Thanks - this is definitely one of the best recipes I've tried.

I doubled the crab and halved the crackers.  Probably only used 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs.  Out of Old Bay so I used cajun seasoning.

Thanks again!!

Beautiful and crispy! My 1st attempt and we cleaned the plate.
I added chopped fresh garlic to the seasonings, and used real mayo and egg beaters.  Added a ton of spice (Salt free) but needed more kick.  Next time more seasonings of pepper and perhaps some thyme!  Oh used fresh claw crab meat too! YUM!!!!

I made these crab cakes with the variation of using dry stuffing mix as a binder. Also, I chilled the mixture before I dipped them in the bread crumbs. They held together fairly well by doing this. I made a honey mustard sauce for dipping.   Yum Yum.  My fussy husband loved them.

As a life long seafood lover, I'm sad to say these are not good crab cakes.  The recipe should call for 4 ounces of cruches crackers.  8 ounces is more than way too much.  I could not taste the crab at all.  I used 1 6 oz. can of lump, and even another 6 oz. can of regular crab meat.

Fantastic!  We gobbled them up.  I did not have any cayenne so I used chili powder.  I also used fresh garlic instead of powder.  I reduced the crackers - just didn't have enough, and I feel like I didn't need more anyway.  I think next time (and there will be many next times) I will fry them in veg. oil instead of olive oil.  I tend to get olive oil too hot for this sort of dish and the bread crumbs come out a little burnt looking.

We loved these. Forgot the green onions and didn't have enough regular bread crumbs, so I added in some panko. I also used a mixture of fresh lump and fresh claw crab. Very good! The crackers in the mix add a nice flavor, I think.

These were pretty tasty. I doubled the batch, as per other reviews, and my cakes came out a little dry. And, we made 2 batches. The first batch we used the bread crumbs...the second batch we did not use the bread crumbs and the second batch was much better. They browned better and overall tasted better than the ones with the bread crumbs. We will make again and add more cayanne pepper...thats for sure!

Pretty good!  I didn't have any cayanne and that's probably why I thought it was in need of some spice. I will definately make these again and be sure to add the cayenne. I like the use of the butter crackers, Yumm!

We love these! I followed the other suggestions: more crab, less crackers.  I used 2 eggs, which seemed to hold it together better. Also, we found flavored breadcrumbs just for seafood -- we like lots of flavor, and this worked well.  (On my latest attempt I sauteed the green onions but forgot to add them. We used them as a topping and it tasted fine.)

When making this I would up the serving size--the recipe posted does not make that much. I used two cans of crab and up all the ingredients and still only got six crab cakes. Taste very good though, just wish I had more.I made these with a green bean casserole(my own I will have to post it--its with swiss cheese) and garlic bread. And I made this doulbe layered pumpkin pie for dessert--YUM!!

Fantastic recipe!  Easy to make and absolutely delicious.  If you can't make aioli, these are tasty enough that just a squirt of lemon adds the perfect flavor.  Thanks for posting!

Great crab cakes with minor adjustments to this recipe: I used twice the amount of crab meat and half the amount of ritz crackers. I used about 1.5 times the amount of spices to compensate for the addition of crab meat. REALLY YUMMY!

I really loved these!  I doubled up on the crab and didn't have any Ritz crackers on hand so I just used 5 oz. of crushed soda crackers.  Also I didn't have any Old Bay...we don't have it here so I just ommitted it all together and it still turned out wonderfully.  I only wish I would've made more since I only got 4 patties even after doubling up on the crab.  Awesome!

I made them exactly as the recipe instructed, and they fell apart and only tasted of the filler. I then remade them, following the suggestions of other reviewers: 2 eggs, 2 cans of crab meat, 1 sleeve of low salt saltines, and that made all the difference. They were delicious!

This recipe is amazing.  Tried it with fresh and canned crab meat and tested both at a party (without telling people which was which) and it was unanimous, everyone suprisingly liked the canned (and it is less expensive). The fresh was too fishy and strong.  Served it with the wasabi-jalapeno sauce and it was a huge hit.

I can't believe I've been paying for $15 for 4 crab cakes. This is way too good to be given out in the open. I made these and was a big hit. This is a keeper!!!

I added half of the amount of the immitation crab from the real crab meat (my suggestion) if you have a big family to feed. Still the same taste and adds a little body to the cakes. Just don't over chop the immitation crab.

Way too good!

We really thought these were TERRIBLE.  Other than I used fresh crabmeat, I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  This had way too much cracker crumb to crabmeat. They were spicy but otherwise undistiguished flavorwise.  Wish I'd used another recipe.

Very good!  I would try not to use canned crabmeat, though.  Canned is just too harsh.  I used vacuum-packed imitation crab and it was great in this recipe.  When I was frying the cakes, my 15 year old daughter gleefully shouted from the other room "It smells like a tuna-patty melt!".  She loved the crab cakes and she's a tough one to please.  This is a keeper!

Very, very good!  Made with frozen crab.  We used half the crackers this time and will probably further increase the crab meat and mayo a little next time we make it.  Served with a Remoulade sauce by Paul Prudhomme.  Wonderful!

These were very good, I think that how good they are depends on the quality of crab you use.  I used canned "fancy lump meat"  The chucks were big and I tried not to break them up too much.  I doubled the recipe, used 10 crackers, 3 cans of crab, 2 eggs, double all the spices except the cayenne.  The patties were hard to form, they were very loose and wet, so I added a few scoops of bread crumbs to the mix, just enough so I could form the patties.  Once I fried them, they were DELISH!!  I will definetly make these again.  I like my crab cakes with big chunks of crab, so I might try a higher quality crab next time, but the spices and flavors were excellent.

This was our first time trying our hand at homemade crab cakes. These were really good ~ a little too spicy for the kids, though. I agree with the last reviewer, there seemed to be more *cracker and breadcrumb* flavoring and texture. This we can fiddle with the next time we make them. Otherwise, they were really good! :o)

The only reason that this recipe gets a 4 instead of a 5 is that I tasted more of the crackers than the crab.  Other than that, it was great.  The family liked it, and that's all that counts.  I served with steamed brocolli and the shrimp and crab bisque from this website.  Surprisingly, the bisque made for a nice topping for the crab cakes.

Excellent!!  Doubled the recipe and used two boneless chicken breasts, shredded, instead of the crabmeat.  Did not use Old Bay seasoning because didn't have any.  If you are sensitive to spicy food, definitely use less cayenne pepper.

These were very good!  My husband even called them "restaurant quality".  They really were easy to make and I used one can of crab and then a cup of lump crab meat from the seafood area of the grocery store.  They were great and I served them with a "mayo based" roasted red pepper sauce, very good recipe!  Thanks!

These turned out really good.  I think I overcooked them a little, but still they were good.  I broiled them instead of cooking on the stove top, figured it would be a little more healthy.  My husband really liked them too.  Thanks for the recipe!

My first attempt at crab cakes and they turned out great! I was a little skeptical about the canned crab meat but I used it because the grocery store didn't have any fresh. Still they turned out great. Next time I will cut down the cayenne to make them a little less spicy.

It was first crab cakes i ever made, and everybody loved it. I read other reviews and decided to double recipe. Well, I ended up with about 20 5 inch in diameter cakes. And yes, I would use half size of crackers. I have people coming over tonight for dinner and guess what I am going to make for dinner? My crab cakes:)

yum! without a doubt the best crab cakes my husband and i have ever tasted.  out of necessity, i substituted saltines for ritz and red onion for green.  i also added extra cayenne.  i did use the same proportions, unlike many of the reviewers.  looking forward to trying out the extra crab variation!

We did not like these at all. I threw them all away. I'm not sure exactly what it was. I think part of it was the canned crab, I should have used fresh or frozen. Also I did not like the bread crumbs on them. I will never make these again.

This was a GREAT recipe!  I also made the aioli sauce to go with it (also from this site).  Served with tossed salad and rosemary roasted potatoes - HUGE hit.  It only makes 4 cakes so you might want to double it.

Great! The only things I changed were to not saute the green onions (I like them a little crunchy) and doubled the garlic (personal taste). It was my first try at making crab cakes, so it was a perfect intro/base recipe.

Really loved these. Did not cook the green onion beforehand. Might add some chopped jalepeno next time for a little kick. Served on top of fresh spinach with a lemon wedge. This will be my go to in the future.

Really delicious. Used frozen Dungeness crab from last trip. Used breadcrumbs from gluten free bread. Didn’t have crackers so used more crumbs.  Had to add an extra egg to get everything to stick. 
Going back to sea the day after thanksgiving to get more crabs!

He ate them all and burped.  Good stuff.  I happened not to have Old Bay on hand today, so just threw in some paprika, pepper,  and extra green onions.  All good. I think next time, I'll add an extra egg though.

Very yummy recipe! The only thing we changed was adding some sweet pepper and lemon zest.  We will
make  these again. The cayenne was just right for our family.

ive never made crab cakes before and although i didn't have green onions old bay or mustard they turned out great! i didnt have a problem with them falling apart either! i just added a little more mayo and a bit of cocktail sauce..i used garlic salt, pepper, onion powder, parsley, and webers n'orleans cajun seasoning and although they didnt have quite as much flavor as im sure they would have with all the ingredients im impressed with my first go at making them! thanks for the recipe!

It's in the fridge slaking until supper.
I keep reading about Garlic Aioli. Do you dip the crab cakes in it or pour it over them?

I saw this recipe in the AllRecipes magazine and decided to make it. When I was mixing the ingredients it felt wrong - too much cracker to crab, but I went ahead and followed the recipe as written. The result was a cracker cake and no crab flavor. My husband wouldn't eat them and we ended up dumping them. Afterwards, I read reviews on this site and noticed many cooks decreased the amount of cracker, so I wish I had read the reviews first because it might have been a different outcome. But the recipe as written is not good and I'm surprised that anyone thinks so unless you like cracker cakes.

Yum! Didn't sauté the green onions and ended up using another egg but these were delicious. Also made a quick aioli as recommended by another user and it paired perfectly.

These were awesome. Friends said they were the best crab cakes they ever had!  I did cut back on the town house crackers because I don’t like a lot of “stuff”in my crab cakes.  Plus I also added just a little bit of diced red pepper. YUM!  I made a sauce with mayo, fresh lemon juice, sweet paprika, old bay, cayenne and capers

I loved these! Made these without the mayo.  I swapped out mayo for 1 cup heavy whipping cream and a stick of butter.  I melted the butter and added the cream over medium heat until the mixture started to boil.  Reduced the heat to a slow simmer added green onions and celery and cooked until liquid thickened some.  Let the liquid cool for about 5 minutes then I added it to my bowl with the other ingredients except the panko.   I folded the liquid in the crab mixture and then added the panko.   Very Very good.  probably the best crab cakes I've had.  Thanks!!!

Made exactly as written and they were great. Found a really simple aioli sauce recipe in the reviews which kicked it up to amazing. 1/2c mayo, 2 cloves of garlic smashed, 1 1/2TBS fresh lemon juice and 1/2tsp S&P. YUMMM!!!

Is tasty, but I found it too much work for the payoff. It falls into my eggplant parmesean category - too many steps and is usually same quality as a decent restaurant.

My family, who were previously not enthusiastic about crabcakes loved this recipe. Easy, quick preparation  with a great reward in flavor. 
I had to promise I would make them again.

I tweaked it quite a bit based on review so my rating is based on the changes.  I used 1 package fresh imitation crab meat, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup mayo, 1 tbsp dijon mustard, and 6 ounces Ritz crackers, which is a lot, 8 ozs would have been way too much.  I baked them in the oven at 350 for 30 mins flipping halfway through.  they came out great this way

I served it with the recommended aioli on here - 3/4 cup mayo, 3 cloves crushed garlic, 2 1/2 tbsp lemon juice, salt & pepper to taste

Follow the recipe! I made a couple of tweaks just to suit our taste. Like added orange bell pepper, cajun seasoning, and refrigerated the patties for about 45 min until I was ready to fry them. This helped the stiffen them so they didn't fall apart.

These were simply the most delicious crab cakes I have ever made. They were full of flavor and a big hit with the family!

These are amazing!!! I hate crab cakes that hardly have crab and a whole lot of extra bread and veggies. These are full of crab. One addition we added a TB of minced garlic bc bammmm who doesn't love garlic!  I might add we used 27 blue crabs we had caught just the night before! Worth every second spent catching, peeling, and cooking them

These crab cakes are as good as the best on the east coast.   I was in a hurry, screwed up, and added the bread crumbs to the main mix.  Didn't hurt a thing, wonderful flavor and crispy texture.  Otherwise I followed the recipe verbatim.

It had a little too many crackers and make sure you use a extra large egg. If you use a medium egg try using two. It was just not moist enough to not fall apart. Very tasty though

These were delicious. I'd add just a little more liquid as the last couple came out a little crumbly.

I made these today. Had some problem with them falling apart, but once I added it to the breadcrumbs, they stayed together well. Also I used corn flakes instead of the crackers. They were delicious.

Was great!  I chopped up celery, red onion, red and green pepper to sauté with green onions and added to mix. I used grey poupon Dijon mustard and browned cake in butter and olive oil.

Great recipe, I used 2 6 oz. cans since I could not find 16 oz. can. I like the fact that the flavors are mild. Crab cakes in restaurants are often too spicy for me and this is perfect. What really makes this great is the aioli sauce that another reviewer posted. I tried these both in the oven and in a skillet. The ones in the skillet were far better, the ones in the oven were gummy and fishy tasting.

My daughter said, they deserve a 10 out of 5, lol.  I agree they are Great, but I would cut back on the cayenne just a bit.  My homemade tarter sauce and my Southwestern Bean Salad did help the heat, so I did really enjoy them.  Looks like I'm making them again on her birthday.

These were very good and easy to make. I used two six ounce cans of crab meat and 20 Ritz crackers. My husband and I both agreed that the cayenne could be reduced to 1/4 teaspoon and that fresh lump crab would have improved the recipe.

I have never made crab cakes on my own before. I have always loved crab cakes but I have never had GOOD crab cakes but for a few places. With that and a hankering and no desire to get dressed up I faced my fears and found this recipe and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy and tasty they were! My husband and I both enjoyed them. I would make these again anytime! Actually, I plan on making them again this weekend for friends! :D

I REALLY liked this recipe. I made it pretty much as written, and perhaps the only change I would make is tone down the cayenne pepper a bit. I used a couple cans of better quality crab meat(usually found near the meat/seafood department in our grocery stores). I like the fact that the crab cakes are moist and not all dried out. Very yummy.  Will definitely make again!

I used a cookie scoop to form the individual cakes.  This made a bit smaller cakes and more of them.  I ended up freezing some of them and taking out only what I need for a meal or appetizer.

I thought this was an easy and fantastic recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used slightly less crackers (40), and a little more old bay seasining. I did  find the oil for frying was excessive, so used far less, and just under 2/3 cup of Panko crumbs was more than enough. The one tweak I will definitely use next time is another egg. I think it's needed for better binding

Great recipe!! I added chopped red bell pepper and also grated parmesan cheese (small amount to taste). These are better than any I've had in restaurants.

I made this recipe exactly as listed.  There are only two of us so I made half a recipe.  He said I should have made a whole recipe.  Even our little dogs loved it.

Excellent with one exception: Cayenne needs adjusting. I reduced the cayenne pepper to just under a 1/2 teaspoon and should have cut it back even more. The flavors are nicely balanced and work well until the cayenne kicks in, so I'm thinking a pinch under 1/8 teaspoon should do the trick.

Easy and very good. I used 4 cans of Bumble Bee canned crabmeat (6 oz), 2 eggs and one tube of Ritz crackers.  I served it with the Garlic Aioli from this site and it was very yummy!!

Tried this recipe today and loved it! I did not cook the green onions and (living in Alberta, Canada) we don't seem to be able to get Old Bay so just used some cajun seasoning instead. Also, I baked them in the toaster oven at 400 for 15 minutes and then broiled them to brown the outsides. The result - delicious! I really like the speed and simplicity of this recipe. Will be doing them again for sure.

Followed recipe exactly, delicious!  A little too much cayenne pepper, a little too spicy, will adjust next time.  We'll be making these again soon!

Wow. These came out great! Follows another reviewers recommendation to change up the ingredients a bit, so this is what I did. I didn't saute the green onions, used 2 cans crab meat, 2 eggs, and upped the old bay seasoning to 1/2 tsp as well. Also, I used about 16 Club Crackers, regular mustard, and regular bread crumbs. Everything else I followed according to the recipe, it yielded 9 medium sized crab cakes. Serve these with Garlic Aioli (also found on this website). Delicious, and definitely worthy of a repeat!

The only tweak is that I didn't saute the green onions - I don't think that's necessary.  Served with a sauce made of mayo, garlic and lemon juice.

I have been craving crabcakes for ages.  I have always wanted to make them but never found a good recipe until now!  It was so easy to make.  I doubled the recipe and it only made 15 crab cakes.  Next time, I will triple the recipe.  Easy to make and so delicious.  I am looking forward to making these again.

Tried this recipe and we LOVED it.  Excellent flavor and the panko added a nice crunch.  Used for Crab Cakes Benedict with poached eggs and blender hollandaise. PHENOMENOL!  My go to recipe..we have tried more than a few.

We loved them!  Followed the recipe - don't think we would change anything next time.  We paired them with Parmesan & Herb Potato Wedges and sautéed Green Beans with Garlic, Red Pepper and Lemon Zest.  We also made an aioli - used mayo, sour cream, lemon juice, garlic, cayenne and siracha.  Yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really like this recipe- I just made it using ingredients I already had: replaced the scallions with about 1/3 of a med. spanish onion and adding 1/2 lb of 'Sea Legs' (pollack) to 2 tuna-sized cans of crab meat. Added more Cayenne and they were great- the kids loved them, too (including our neighbor)- All quickly disappeared!

These were okay - just okay.  A bit too much mustard and the crab flavor was a bit hidden with all the cracker crumbs.

I never made crab cakes b/4 trying this.  My family loves them.  I have to double or triple the recipe.  I also add 8oz of imitation to 16 oz of real crab meat, and get about 10 good sized patties (good for a sandwich the next day).  I use Waverly Wafers for the cracker meal, and roll in italian bread crumbs.  YUM! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I will never make another!

These are wonderful.  Just perfect for my taste.  I mixed canned crab with fresh real crab and that made them delicious.

These were good but I felt like it could have used a bit more flavor and I followed the recipe pretty exact.  I also had the best crab cakes in the world at a wedding recently so no crab cake I eat after can compare.    I will still make these next time and I'll try using higher quality crab meat...maybe that'll help.  I just used the canned ones for this recipe.

Great recipe, the measurements are perfect, just the right amount of heat from the cayenne.  I made a simple mayo with relish, Old Bay and garlic powder...wonderful topper!!

These are the best crab cakes I've ever had. They have a wonderful texture and a great spice. I followed some other reviewer's suggestions and used 2 6oz cans of crab, 2 eggs, and 20 Ritz crackers. I also cut the cayenne, but that's just my preference. They turned out really delicious and I will be making these again! (They taste even better with aioli. Yum!)

This is a good basic recipe.. I GUESS, if by basic I mean giving me a rough idea about what ingredients go in a crab cake. Now, I ain't a fancy city chef who needs to use words like "filler" and "fold in", but I will say that this recipe is relatively flexible, and that half a pound of crackers to less than a pound of canned crabmeat is really pushing it as a poor man's crab cake. I cut down on the crackers by half and added another egg, and it makes for a fairly decent snack.

I thought these were pretty good, but we only carry 6oz cans of crab so I had to use 2 cans.  Even with following the directions, I found the mixture a bit soft, so I added some bread crumbs to stiffen the batter.  My daughter loved them; and she hates crab cakes.  That says something about this recipe.  I was a bit disappointed that I only got 5 crab cakes out of my batter..... I will be using this over and over again.  I'm wondering what they would be like if I used the imitation crab to cut the cost so I can make more.....  I'll give it a try and let everyone know.

Very good!  Didn't have green onions, but they were tasty anyway.  I think the 1/2 cup of oil is a little much, I used a lot less but they still came out good, and less greasy!  Will try it again at my next summer bash!

WOW!!! My husband and I eat at this great seafood restaurant in Scottsdale and they have the best crab cakes.  These are EXACTLY the same.  I love that it is all crab and buttery crackers.  I like tartar sauce so I mix my own. 1c mayo, 1or2 TBL spoons of each diced dill pickle,onion,lemon juice.  It's the perfect match!

these were amazing! I just made these and it was my first time ever making crabcakes! I followed the instructions mostly.. I used whole grainy mustard instead of dry, and less crackers (may not need any next time).. used extra old bay like two small teaspoons.. maybe a little extra mayo since I really like it and I found that using a little extra mayo and mustard resulted in not having to dip in any sauce!!  I fried them in half butter half oil and they blew me away!!! I made four large ones and I ate all four easily!!

These crab cakes were really good but a little cry. We did use real lump crab and that was really tasty. Next time I'll try and use more mayo just to make sure they're not dry but overall these were pretty good... not as good as Maryland crab cakes though.

These are the best crabcakes I've ever had. I only had 12 oz canned bumblebee crabmeat so I used a little less townhouse cracker crumbs, but other than that I made the recipe as is. Thank-you!

This was my first time making crabcakes ever from scratch, and I was so pleased with the result...and hubby loved them!!!  I did make some alterations based on other reviews though.  I added about 1/2 cup mayonnaise, little more bay seasoning for some added kick, and I didn't saute the onions (to save time & it didn't disrupt the flavor at all).  I also used low fat mayo & baked these at 375 degrees 15 minutes each side (much healthier this way!)

Great recipe!  I used a combination of butter and olive oil to fry and I added 1/2 of a large red pepper to the mix and used a bit more cayenne.  Everyone loved them.

these were simple to make and yummy. I changed a few seasoning choices -- added basil, garlic salt, garlic powder, seasoning salt, cayenne pepper and didn't use the old bay seasonings. used whole wheat ritz crackers and plain bread crumbs. This was sooo good. Thanks for the recipe! will make again.

Really awesome!  I didn't have any crackers, so I just used some extra breadcrumbs.  The only thing I would change is to cut down on the red pepper a little.  I also made a creole mayonnaise for dipping.  Wonderful!

Cracker cakes is what these were called.  Maybe with a LOT LESS crackers this would be good.

Great recipe. I had no idea crab cakes were so easy. I have made this a number of times over the past month, and I change things around according to my mood, but the original is very good and definitely worth a try!

I made these tonight for dinner, served up on top of a light salad.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written - other than used a little more crab meat and panko for the bread crumbs.  I love how easy this was to make and my husband couldn't stop saying how delicious it was.

First of all I would like to say that this recipe was amazing! There was a couple things I had to change to make a little better. First off you dont need so many crackers. I used about 3/4 of what it told me. You dont want it to have too many crackers in it otherwise you cant taste the crab as much. Anothers thing is to add some garlic and you LOTS of mustard. You can add some more mayo if your crab cake is a little to dry. The last thing I would have to say is go with the expensive crab meat. It doesnt really matter how fishy your crab is to start of with. You change it alot by adding the cracekr crumbs and seasoning. Over all the recipe was amazing! And it felt like I was sitting at the pier eating them. This recipe is definately going to be a keeper.

My husband grew up in Maryland he considers himself an conosieur of sorts when it comes to crabcakes. He said - hands down this is his favorite! I used a 12 oz. tub of real bluecrab chunks and followed th recipe to a tee. The sauce is so delicious. My hubby preffered good ol vinegar and lemon. Thanks for the recipe. Will be a staple in our house  :)

I will definitely be making these again.  I didn't have dried mustard so I used a squeeze of dijon and I didn't have Old Bay but I had Lawry's seasoning salt and it turned out fine.  I also did 1 cup crushed crackers (8 oz = 1 c), I dont think that is 2 sleeves but I could be wrong.  You don't need a half cup of oil, just maybe enough to just coat the whole pan.  Let the oil heat up a bit then drop them in (beware of splatter!).  When I make them again I think I may try to use a tad bit more crab also.  I served them on a bed of mixed spring greens and a side sauce of spanish brava sauce mixed with may.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have messed up plenty of crab cake recipes and by far this is the best and easy to prepare.  I used the eight serving recipe and I used only 6 green onions with one sweet onion.  I used one 3/4 pack of ritz crackers. I served this with a nice salad. My fiancee was really impressed.  Bravo and thank you for sharing....

1st time for me to make crab cakes from scratch.  Used recipe as a guide and the cakes turned out delicious. I did have to substitute what was on on hand for some of the ingrediants: Club crackers instead of buttery round Prepared mustard for dry Italian seasoned bread crumbs  Real chopped garlic instead of garlic powder

I followed Lucky/Sami review practically to the T and my dinner guests were blown away!  I did add a pinch of wasabi powder to the aoili and my husband almost licked his plate.  I also made these into smaller cakes, so people could use their fingers to eat.. everyone was very impressed how "crabby and not too cake-like" these were.

I followed Top Reviewer (Lucky/Sami)'s recommendations and these were excellent. Had to use more than the 20 crackers he/she suggested though. I also used her recipe for the aioli and it was perfect. The flavor will develop as it rests in the refrigerator, so make sure to make it ahead.

These were so good.  I used fresh crab meat.  I also used fresh garlic ( 1 clove) which I cooked with the green onions.  I did put them in the fridge for about 2 hours before cooking  then shaped into cakes right before cooking.  I also used less oil to cook them in.  They came out perfect

Wow so good! I made them with imitation crab because my husband is deathly allergic to shellfish.  I made the aioli that other users had recommended and it was perfect.  I will definitely me making these again.

So, I sit in traffic for 2 hours today to get home (thanks ADOT) and I have a hungry man who went quail hunting (2 birds).  I need something to fill his belly and no one wants take out.  I have a 6oz crab can in the cupboard (I'm like old Mother Hubbard right now)  I make these and guess what?!  They are great.  I topped with a fried egg (try it you'll like it!) YUM!  Thanks for sharing!

Sorry, but these weren't that great.  Something was missing in the flavour.  Granted I couldn't find the Bay seasoning but did my best to recreate the taste of it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was really good.  I may add fewer cracker next time just because I think it could have been a little less dry but overall it's a winner.

I read the reviews, and ignored the bad ones because so many were great.  Maybe its because I used canned crab?  I even made the recommended modifications by so many reviewers by increasing the crab and decreasing the crackers.  My husband and I tasted the first one while the others cooked.  They were so bad. Terribly disappointed!!

Ididn;t even have all the ingredients (Old Bay Seasoning, Buttery crakers, and dry mustard) Instead, I used regular mustard, all purpose seasoning, and saltines, and they still turned out amazing, not dry at all, and the fried green onion gives them an amazing flavor.This is the best crab cake recipe I ever tried, thank you

These crab cakes were delicious, very moist on the inside and crisp on the outside. I added a little extra Old Bay and some fresh lemon juice for some added punch.  Yummy!

I've made these 3 times since finding this site, and I will make them again. Last time, I didn't have enough crackers so I used a combination of crackers and bread crumbs. Delicious. Just really good. I always seem to make too much, but that doesn't ever seem to be a problem.

Great recipe! I made it with fresh crab we had left over from a crab boil and they were fantastic. I'm sure we had much more than 1 can's worth of crab (which is what the recipe calls for), but for me the recipe made almost 10 crabcakes - delicious!

Wow these were good! I added some cilantro to them since I had some in the garden, and next time I make them I might add some red pepper for color! I let the crab cakes sit in the fridge for a bit before frying which I think held them together a bit better too. I used the following aioli along side...awesome!  6 tbsp mayo sambal oelok (chili paste) as tolerated 2 tbsp cilantro 1 garlic clove minced  4 tsp lime juice salt and pepper to taste  I should mention that I used 8 oz crab meat and about 10 ritz crackers!

I loved these crab cakes!!  I've never made them before and thought they came out great!  I used 8 ou of lump crab and would try to use fresh as opposed to can, if you can get it. I also only used about 2/3 of the crackers as I that seemed to be enough.  I also did not coat with breadcrumbs as there was no need in my opinion.  I used the garlic/mayo dipping sauce mentioned in further down in the reviews.  So easy!

Update: I also bake these at 350 for 20 mins.  And I make small ones, as I use them for a passed appetizer.

Excellent recipe.  I used fresh crabmeat that I picked myself.  I thought the cracker crumbs gave these cakes a wonderful light buttery flavor, and were not a heavy filler like breadcrumbs.  Just right to hold the mixture together.  These also cooked up very light and golden brown.  This will be my go-to crabcake recipe from now on.

I love crab cakes and these are spicy!  I love it!  I didn't change anything except I don't saute the green onions and I usually make about three times as much as this recipe so my friends and I can eat it with ketchup or soy sauce and rice!

This was really good.  I used imitation crab meat instead of the real stuff and it still turned out really good.  I think next time I will omit the green onion though.

This recipe is definetly great. I added another can of crab because more is better :) i also needed to add a bit more mayo and i use panko breadcrumbs. someone posted a recipe for a great aioli below with mayo, garlic, and lemon juice. it was excellent with the crab cakes! i omitted the cayenne pepper because i am sensitive to spicy food. i also used 25 ritz crackers..almost a whole sleeve. i never sauted the green onions either, i just put them in raw..just as good.

I totally agree with the other reviewers. This is a great basic crab cake recipe with great flavor EXCEPT it calls for WAY too many crackers.  I made them several times before reading the reviews and couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong.  Now I do what others suggested -- twice the crab and half the crackers.

I made this today and really enjoyed the taste. I only made 2 so reduced the ingredients, however, I dont feel that they had enough substance, a little limp. I crushed 10 ritz crackers. Maybe I need more? Panko bread crumbs were a good way to go.

I use this recipe all the time, but the amount of crackers called for is way too much. 8 oz is two sleeves. The recipe actually calls for more crackers than it does crab. I start with about two ounces, half a sleeve and keep adding till it looks right. Otherwise, everything else in this recipe and the instuctions are great. I dredge them in flour instead of breadcrumbs, just a personal preference.

Delish.  Followed the advice of others and doubled the crab.  Eliminated the crackers and added the flour/bking. powder/sherry combo previously recommended.  Refrigerated after combining.  Fried in cast iron skillet.  They are soft when first placed in skillet, but they do hold together.

I followed the recipe exactly and there was still too much filler.  Not sure what I'm looking for but I wanted to taste more of the $15 worth of crab that I used to make 7 cakes.  ouch.

My first attempt at crab cakes and for not working much w/ seafood these were good. I think I will try fresh crab next time. Something wasn't quite right though, I couldn't figure out what 8 oz. of crushed crakers would be maybe that's where I went wrong?? Too cakey? Not sure, I'll work with this recipe to get it right.

I agree with other users that these tasted like crackers and bread crumbs, NOT crab cakes.  How can so many people think these taste good?  I order crab cakes all the time and these have been by far the worst.

I gave four stars because these were really good. A few things:  I put too much salt in them..and I love salt..so i would recommend that you watch out for that.  I used the can crab which i liked, but i'll try it with lump crab.  I made this with a homemade sauce--thanks for the recipe..i'll make these again soon.

I made mini versions of this recipe and served it with a sauce at a wedding reception that I catered and they were the biggest hit on the buffet. The only thing I changed is that we used imitation crab so that everyone could eat them. Everyone raved over the recipe and I've already been asked by a dozen people to make a tray for them.

Exellent.  I modified the recipe a bit which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I added mayo, mustard, celery and onion.  I also added some cornmeal and bread crumbs.  Delicious.  I made them for my husbands family and they were all gone instantly.  Everyone loved them.

I hope that it was just me, but I didn't care for these.  My husband liked them though.  I used a 15 oz can of crab, so I tripled the rest of the ingredients except the Old Bay.  I think I made the cakes too big, but otherwise did everything else right.  I fried them in some oil with butter, but I just couldn't get past the texture, probably due to the size.  I only made them for my hubby's birthday, but I don't know if I'll do them again...but that is because of my own tastes!

These were fantastic! To make them more flavorful without adding salt (we eat low-sodium), I used 2x the crab meat and green onions, nixed the salt and pepper, and a little extra Old Bay. Savory and delish! Also, after sauteeing the green onions I just dumped everything together in the food processor. It made very smooth cakes that held together well because there were no lumps, so nothing fell apart in the pan.

Very good.  We left out the bread crumbs as other suggested.  There needed to be a little more crab flavor in our opinion.  Still a very good recipe. Now we need to find a good crab cake sauce.

Pretty good recipe-My mixture was a little dry, added a little more mayo.  Next time will not add cayenne pepper, took away from the sweet taste of the crab-the Old Bay and garlic are enough seasoning.  Also, will not roll in bread crumbs-mine were a bit "dusty", prefer the way I'm used to-without bread crumb coating.  Husband loved them, will definitely make again!

My husband doesn't like crab cakes and he loved these.  They are very filling.  Easy to make, followed the directions to a T.  Made Remoulade sauce a la New Orleans from this site also and it was a great sauce for these.

Changes I made: used two egg whites, reduced fat mayo, 1 sleeve reduced fat ritz crackers, seasoned whole wheat breadcrumbs.  I would slightly increase the Old Bay seasoning next time.  Baked at 400 degrees, 14 minutes each side, Pam Cooking spray.  They taste pretty good for a lower fat version, but I would stick to original recipe for guests.

Great!  What I did was to cut the recipe for 1 person (which was still large) then I made these for lunch using imitation crab before making for dinner. Even with the imitation crab it was still really good.  So since they passed the test I made them for dinner and the real test a very picky husband!  He loved them.  I took the advice mostly of Lucy and doubled the crab meat, etc and added 1t of worsteshire sauce, and made Lucy's aioli.  My husband said we never have to buy crab cakes again. I agree. Thank you Leslie and Lucy for a great recipe.

I did not prefer this recipe.  There was more of a cracker taste than the crab itself.  will use less cracker and more crab next time.

These were really good, which is saying a lot since I don't care for any kind of seafood for the most part. I only made them on the request of my husband, who loved these as well! I suggest using 2 cans of crab and do not add any salt to this. I REALLY doesn't need it.

Good recipe, although the next time I make it I will add a little bit more salt coz I only added a pinch of salt. I didnt have bread crumbs, so I used crushed saltine crackers, still turned out good. Will make again. Thanks

I wish these tasted as good as they looked. I followed the recipe to a tee and I thought they tasted very "bready". I am going to try a recipe with more crab in it next time.

Yummy these are the best. I use one sleeve of Townhouse crackers.  Also, I don't use 1/2 a cup of oil.  I just put enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I added salt, but it wasn't really needed.

Easy, great taste, and you can bake instead of fry to free up your hands if you are entertaining (see another review's tips on the baking)! The green onion was too strong for me, but otherwise these were great and made me look good!

I used lump crab when I did these. Not enough crab in them for our tastes. The flavor was fantastic tho! Next time I will double the crab. I paired this with some cole slaw & corn on the cob. Very yummy!

this is one of my favorite recipes in my recipe box on allrecipes. These were so awesome!! I made it just like it was written, except I forgot to buy green onions so I had to use yellow onions. But still, totally awesome. Will definately be making these for years to come.

These were the best crab cakes I have ever made!  I had to used saltine crackers instead of the buttery crackers because thats just what I had.  They browned up beautifully and tasted great!

While these crab cakes are ok, I don't think they are the best as it seems to have to many fillers and not enough crab meat. Between the crackers and the breading on the outside, there is a recipe on here that  much more crab meat and less fillers.

Excellent flavor & easy to put together.  Serves 4 means 4 cakes, with 2 cakes as a single serving.  I don't like alot of filler, so I only used about 10-12 crushed butter crackers.

This is a great recipe.  You definitely do not need 8 oz of crackers.  4 oz is plenty.  I used 2oz of crackers and 2oz of panko.  Also, I cut back on the cayenne pepper.  They had a wonderful flavor. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Absolutely the best.  So easy and delicious.  I received raves from my guests.  A couple of miner adjustments:  3 cans crab, 2 eggs, and 1 full ream of ritz crackers.  These turned out just as good as any restaurant.  AWESOME!

There is nothing I would change about this recipe.  I made it last night for dinner and my husband absolutely loved them.  I doubled the recipe and he took the left overs for lunch today.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I usually have to go to downtown Chicago to get crab cakes of quality, but with this recipe I can make my own.

After reading the reviews, I made some adjustments.  I halved the amount of cayenne and crackers, and doubled the amount crab meat and Old Bay seasoning.  They were excellent!

After reading the reviews I only used 4 ounces of crackers, increase the spices also adding some blackening seasoning.  I used Garlic & Herb bread crumbs with some Panko bread crumbs mixed in for extra crunchiness.

I love crab cakes and this was my first time making them and it was a hit!  I used fresh lump crab meat.  It is easy to come by down here in Louisiana. Can crab meat just doesn't sound appetizing.  Thank goodness I live here!!

Pretty good recipe.  I did add more spice as some users recommended to give them more zip and served them with cocktail sauce.  My husband loved them and has requested them again.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good. We do not like spicey food at all, so we just omitted the Cayhanne and we had no Bay Seasoning. We had Wheat crackers instead of buttery and they worked perfectly. We used the left over king crab from New Year's Eve. We also had no dry Mustard (I was out of a lot of things) so I used regular mustard because the mixture was a bit dry and this added some moisture.

WAY too many crackers, even for me who likes a "breadier" cake.  It was also very bland.  The only thing that gave it any flavor was the oil it was cooked in.  If i ever made these again, I'd reduce the crackers by at least half and double up on the spices.

So good! Added minced sweet onion (not sauted, instead of the green onion) and like someone else suggested a splash of hot sauce.  Made four medium sized patties which were great for an appetizer, would at least double the recipe if i were making it for a meal.

i made this crab cake a couple weeks ago...the cakes came out well, but there are some changes that i made.  I used only one sleeve of crackers and two cans of crab meat.  The next time i use this recipe i will consider using LUMPS of fresh crab instead.  but overall this recipe is good...

These were delicious! I cut down on the crackers and bread crumbs and used a little less cayenne pepper. They still had a good spicy taste though.

this was my first time making crab cakes, and these were DIVINE! They were a bit crumbly when I put them together, so it was a bit difficult to cook them, but next time, I'm going to bake them, so they can be a bit healthier.

I used this as a basic recipe and took the advice in other reviewers and added my own personal touches. Delicious! Made these for a party (shaped them smaller) and only got to try one! Even better the next day! I used both canned and imitation crab, doubled the Old Bay, added Old Bay Lemon and Herb seasoning, reduced the crackers, gave it a squeeze of Honey Dijon mustard, and used Italian style bread crumbs. I will be making this again!

Crab cakes were a hit and all the guests said they were a keeper.  Added one more egg and doubled the old bay seasoning.  They cooked fast so watch them.  Next time I'm going to add a little more seasonings.

This is a good recipe but I like 'em crabby so I tripled the crab, doubled the Old Bay, added an egg and some finely chopped green and red pepper and celery.  Also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs to coat.  Yummy.

This recipe is wonderful.  I made this twice over the Christmas break.  Everyone couldn't believe they were mine.  I did follow the other suggestions and used Wheat Thins instead of Ritz.  I also used canned crab and imitation together.  I couldn't find Old Bay Seasoning here in Toronto, Canada so I used a mixture of dill weed, basil and lemon.  I am going to make it again as an appetizer for my March Break Luncheon with some teacher friends.  Thank you so much for the great recipe.

I made these crab cakes for dinner (for myself)last night, and I liked them.  They were spicy though.  If you like spicier ingredients added to your seafood, you will love these.

I followed others who said to add 2 eggs instead of 1, and double the old bay beasoning.  I thought the filling was a little wet after mixing it together, so I added a 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs.  They came out very nice.  I had no cayenne pepper on hand, so I substituted red pepper in its place.  

Thank you for a nice recipe!

I made this crab cake recipe for Xmas to go with prime rib.  My sister, who is a tough food critic, loved it.  While I was worried that the crab cakes would have too much filler, I was pleasantly surprised that they were quite meaty.  

I have saved this recipe for future family get togethers.

This was good, but next time I will omit the cayenne seasoning and double up on the Old Bay seasoning. It was slightly spicy, which is fine, except we are Marylanders and prefer the Old Bay taste.

WOW! The only change I made was using Old Bay Blackened seasoning instead of regular. I also put some of it on the outside of the crabcakes after the bread crumbs to make them look like blackened crabcakes. They were a HUGE hit & I could barely believe I made something this good. I used Phillips crabmeat, & I  imagine this made a big difference. I would never use another brand for ANY recipe, ever.

I didn't use the full amount of crackers, but this recipe had too much breading for our taste.  I served these with a jalapeno-wasabi sauce (from this site) and the taste was generally good, but again, too much breading.

This was my first attempt at making crab cakes at home, and I must say I'm glad I tried this recipe.  My husband absolutely loved them.  He said they were the best crab cakes he's had.  The only modification I made was using fresh crabmeat.  They were excellent!

These were restaurant quality!  I used crabmeat from the seafood department, and I completely forgot to add the egg.  The crab cakes were still delicious!  Also, I chose to broil mine to cut down on the fat.  Delicious!

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!! The ONLY modifications I made to this recipe is to add two cans of crabmeat and two eggs. I also didn't have any Ritz crackers on hand, so I just substituted 
4oz of Club crackers and 4oz of saltines. Still GREAT!!

We are from Maryland and LOVE crab cakes.  This was my first attempt at making my own and they turned out PERFECT!  My husband said they were the BEST he's had here in Phoenix, and comparable to what we are used to back home.  I did substitue LUMP crabmeat in place of the 6oz canned variety...any self-respecting Marylander would do the same!  (o:  Thanks!

Very flavorful.  Next time I'll take it easier on the Ritz and heaver on the crab meat.  Also a little less cayenne and another egg.  Other than that, these are too easy to make and adjust to your own liking, Great recipe!!!

This was yummy! I will definitely make this again. Like others, I used 2 cans of crabmeat and 2 eggs, but I kept the rest of the ingredients pretty much the same. I also baked them instead of frying them.

These were great! I added an extra egg so the mixture would stay together...I doubled the Old Bay (1/2 tsp instead of 1/4 for extra kick). Next time I'll try adding a lil extra crab meat...but overall fantastic and simple recipe!

These were very good but I had to make a few changes.  I took others recommendations and increased the crab meat to two cans, cut the crackers in 1/2 to 4 oz. and increased the eggs to 2.  I didn't have any green onions so just used regular sweet white onions.  Good, but I'm sure the green onions are better.  I also didn't have any butter crackers on hand so just used saltines.  I was also out of cayenne pepper and just used cajun seasoning.  I did not add any salt, there is enough in the other ingredients.  These came out well, but I want to try them with the green onions and butter crackers, they will probably be even better.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I found these to be very good, but my husband wasn't crazy about them.  I used imitation crab meat instead of canned because he prefers imit.crab.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is.  He asked me not to make this dish again because "it's a waste of crab".  I don't agreee with that statement but I'm giving both sides.

Seasonings were great, as was the texture. However the amount of crab meat specified was woefully inadequate. I would double the crab meat, at least. And decrease the crackers from 8oz. to 6. Otherwise, good. I'll make again, but with these changes.

Very good.  I thought there may have been too many crackers though, and may either cut down on them or add an extra can of crab next time.  I needed 2 eggs to get the mixture to stick together, instead of just 1 as the recipe calls for, but they came out great!

I was not blown away by these, they were good but not great.  I've had better in retaurants but I wouldn't say that they were terrible like some other reviewers have.  I did use fresh crab meat and think that this is important for this recipe.

This recipe was just ok...probably won't make again.  It would probably be better with frest crab instead of canned crab.  And there was some spices that just didn't taste well together.

The crab cakes were very good.  I took the advice of others and used two cans(4.25 oz.) of crab meat and also used 1/2 the amount of the Ritz Garlic & Butter crackers.

My husband said he felt like we were eating a restaurant meal.  They were excellent.  I used the reduced fat Ritz.  Maybe 1 1/4 sleeves.  I used about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and only enough oil to brown them a little.  I'll try more and/or better crab next time.

Great recipe!  This was the first time I ever made crab cakes and they were so yummy.  Even my very picky 2½ year old daughter loved them.

This recipe was delicious!  I didn't have any breadcrumbs or buttery crackers, so I had to improvise with stuffing croutons (I crushed)and graham crackers.  It still turned out great!  The recipe does not make large cakes, so next time I will add a bit more.  It was fabulous on a bed of spring greens coated with oil and balsamic vinegar.

I made these for a group of my friends as an appetizer, and they absolutely LOVED them.  Easy to make, great spicy flavor!  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Good flavor.  I added some onion powder, paprika, and cumin instead of the Old Bay.  My one problem was that these were really dry.  I added an extra egg to help the batter stick together.  I was using club crackers--maybe those were the wrong kind.  I'll try this again with another can of crab and different crackers.  Turned out okay, but really needed a sauce because they were so dry.
