This is not a bad bar cookie.  I liked it.
My input would be:  How do you get 48 cookies out of a 9" pan?  We got 16 cookies.  48 would be crumbs only.

These are very yummy! Not really cookies, a kind of cross between biscuit, cake and bread. I think maybe there was a typo in the recipe that they corrected as when I came across this recipe it says 18 servings, which was perfectly reasonable. I added 3/8 teaspoon of cinnamon which made it even more yummy, and reduced the sugar slightly as the dates made it sweet enough. Also, I didn't "roll between palms", just cut into bars and let cool.

Try this recipe! You won't regret it!

I thought these were really delicious!  I was suprised!  The only reason that they don't get five stars is because they tasted just a tiny bit eggy still.  I really want to try this with cranberries and pecans or raisins and walnuts.  yum.

Also, I added in spices and vanilla to give extra flavor.

Lastly, I wasn't able to whip the egg whites to stiff peaks, but I guess it didn't matter?  The instructions about the egg whites were a bit confusing.

The cookies had a hard top that crumbled and did not roll into logs.  The taste was good, but they looked terrible.  I agree with the other cook, How would you get 48 cookies out of this recipe ??
