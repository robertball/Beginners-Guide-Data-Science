This was an excellent recipe.  Here is how I adapted it.  I cut down the butter to 2 T.  Instead of the water and seasoning I used 1 14.5 ounce can of chicken broth and 1 pint (8 ounces) of heavy cream (instead of the milk).  Oh, and I added 1/2 t. salt.  Thick and yummy!

Excellent recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used a can of chicken broth instead of the water and eliminated the boullion granules.  I didn't have any thyme, but no one noticed a lack in flavor as a result. I accidentally overly browned the butter when I was cooking the onion in it, so my filling was a darker color than it should have been. Even with the butter mishap, my family loved this recipe and we will definitely use it again!

This recipe is great. I used chicken broth instead of water, and i add a potato too during the onion and butter process. My family loves it. I also put the mixture in individual ramakin's and then put prepared pie dough over top. Delish!!!

Great recipe.  We loved it. I would maybe use cornstarch (corn flour for those in the uk) instead of flour next time to thicken it a bit more.

We made 2 and put in the fridge for later in the week.  Going to have it tonight and reheat it in the oven.

Great recipe! It was simple and was soooo good. i used the advice of others and used the chicken broth instead of water and it added o the flavor, it was great. I let it stand for 10 or 15 minutes after taking it out of the oven, so the pie would thicken up a bit, and it turned out great, I mae it tonite for my date and he loved it too, what a great recipe, highly recommended to anyone!

This was a huge hit with my family! My husband ate about half the pie, and finished it the next day. I accidently used a tablespoon of thyme, and it still turned out awesome! I will be using chicken broth to add a bit more chicken flavor in it. Easy to make, and will be making again and again!!

Quick and easy meal that is much more healthy and tasty than the frozen kind.  My small family devoured half of the pie and then my husband ate the leftovers for lunch the next day.  He thought the reheated pie tasted even better.

Excellent and easy to prepare.  I did not use the Herb-ox bouillon but substituted chicken broth for the water.   Only complaint was that it was a little watery when we first cut into it.  After a little time, it thickened.  The whole family loved it!

Very tasty, but I never have leftover chicken, so I made it with fresh chicken.

Honestly, I am shocked this recipe got so many 5 star ratings. If you make the recipe as it is, it isn't all that great. I followed the recipe and it was very bland. Most people used heavy cream as opposed to milk, which is what the recipe calls for, and maybe my results would have been different had I done that. Salt and pepper were definitely needed as well. I let it rest for 15 minutes before cutting into it and the inside was just soupy. It ran all over the plate and into the empty space in the pie dish. I believe reviews should be given for the recipe as it is, not on how much someone changes it to make it a 5 star recipe. This is not a very good pot pie. I think a Marie Callendar's frozen chicken pot pie is a lot better and without all the work.

This tastes SO much better than those frozen pot pies! It's super easy, but tastes like it took all day! I left out the pimentos and added some extra seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic) and it was delicious!

This pot pie was so good! Even just the filling alone is a great stew, and I added some cooked potatos which made it even better!

My family loves this chicken pot pie recipe.  It isn't too hard and I usually have all the ingredients right on hand.  I make my own 10" pie crusts and it turns out great!

This is a wonderful chicken pot pie. I took the advice of another reviewer and added chicken broth and heavy cream and eliminated the bouillon and water. The pot pie will thicken the longer you let it cool, which takes a long time. Approx. 40 minutes. Will definetly make this one again.

This is a very delicious and easy pot pie recipe... it was so good in fact that my family made me make them more the next day. My family (hubby, sisters, brothers,neices & nephews,& friends) are very picky about what they will eat and they gobbled these up. I used heavy cream instead of milk and it came out thicker.

Very yummy. It came out a little soupy the night that I made it, but when warmed over for lunch the next day, it was perfect!
