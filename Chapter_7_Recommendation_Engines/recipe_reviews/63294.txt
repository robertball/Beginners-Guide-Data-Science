Great recipe!  I added 3 cloves garlic and 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning as another suggested using seasoned tomatoes and it was great.  I also just went ahead and squeezed that lemon right into my tomato mixture. And, oh yeah, added a diced onion also...so did I invent a new recipe or am I rating the original?? At any rate, the base of the recipe was not my own but I like to tweak everything with lots or garlic and onion.  I also didn't know whether to cover with foil or not so I followed my normal baked fish recipe and covered with foil and baked for one hour (my fish was almost 6 lbs.)  I peeked in after 45 minutes and found a little more water than I wanted so I uncovered it and it reduced nicely as we eat it with basmati rice and salad so we like a little sauce to put over the rice.  I am trying to incorporate more baked fish in our diet and my whole family enjoyed this fish.  Thanks!

This was our first time making trout. We decided to try this recipe for it's simplicity. The taste was wonderful! The only changes made were that I had used a fresh tomato and added a little more of the wine. Very good. Thanks!

What a quick and easy recipe! I made it even easier by using a can of seasoned diced tomatoes- just drizzled the fish in olive oil/pepper, topped with the tomatoes, and baked. I had 1 lb of trout from the grocery store, so 1 14 oz can was plenty. Also, it was cut thinner, so 30 min was a bit too long, will shorten the cooking time by 5-10 min next time.

This recipe is great. First off, I love Rainbow Trout, so that could be part of it. I don't like the taste of white wine at all so I opted for fresh squeezed lemon juice instead. Also, I didn't have fresh parsley so I sprinkled a little Italian Seasonings on top of the tomatoes. And to avoid having to "baste" the fish during cooking, I cooked it en papillote (wrapped in parchment paper). This allowed the juices to steam the fish and keep it moist without me having to keep opening the oven to baste (which lowers the temperature). Great job with the recipe, Marilyn! :)

This was very good.  My 4 year old loved it.  Very moist... The only thing I did different was use the diced tomatoes with italian seasoning and used white zin for basting. A+ Will use again

Moist and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.  Was concerned about the dish being watery like what one reviewer stated so I patted my 2 1/2 lb. trout with a paper towel & drained the seeds out of the fresh tomatoes that I used, and I also did not baste it with wine.

I made this recipe with a couple of trout filets.  I made the tomatoe mixture with cherry tomatoes and put that in the pan first.  I put the fish on top of the tomatoes,  skin side up, brushed it with a bit of olive oil and broiled it at the end so the skin got crispy, mimicking a dish I had at a restaurant.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe, my second attempt to cook some great fresh trout I caught in New Zealand. Loved it, very moist and full of lovely flavor. And also it is so easy to make even in a camp site, trout fresh out of the water. Nothing can beat that! The only thing I find is a little bit annoying is it's too watery. I must have done it wrong or something.I will try to make it next time I go fishing. Hopefully I will get it just right! Thanks for sharing this great trout recipe!

I used cilantro instead of parsley.  Flavor combination of fish with diced tomato & seasoning mixture was good, but the whole thing was a bit too watery for me.

So simple yet delicious! Didn't really believe the great reviews as thought it was too easy, but they were right! I bake trout quite often, and never thought of doing it with tomato. Thank you! Served with fresh veg and cous cous which soaked up the lovely juice and flavour. Will do again. Lots.

If you happen to have leftovers, this recipe tastes even better reheated in the microwave the next day!  Be sure to reheat 5 minutes at 50% power for best results.

really easy recipe and turned out really well. It was quite watery in the baking dish though. I also substituted cilantro instead of parsley which I thought was really good.

have to be honest here.  after reading this i was thinking it would be mushy, but have to say it was very good.  made exactly as written with the exception i used 4 boneless/skinless trout fillets and italian stewed tomatos.  lifted fillets out of pan with spatuala to drain juice. cooked 35 minutes and they were firm and flakey.  will be a keeper.  side dish boiled white rice in a bag.

I used fresh, chopped tomatoes and added some black olives as well.  The fillets came out perfect and the kids gobbled them up.  I'm making it again tonight but I bought more fillets this time!

It was okay.  I might or might not make it again - but then we don't have trout very often.  I did not like the overpowering wine smell and wish I has listened to another reviewer who did not baste with white wine.

DELICIOUS!!! I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this dish. I followed the recipe exactly and it came wonderfully. The fish was cooked perfectly, and even the next day the leftovers heated well and were still tasty. So glad to have a fast recipe for trout now that it's trout season and I have a freezer full of it!

I omitted the wine (none around) and made this with 2 trout. I made sure to drain the tomatoes well so it wouldn't turn out soggy.

Delicious!!! I didn't bake it, instead in a skillet on the stove top with a lid.  It was very moist and full of flavor.  Served over cous cous with a glass of white wine.  Successful meal from the first fish caught ice fishing in 2011!

While this recipe did indeed cook a decent trout, that's the best I could call it: decent. The tomato mixture itself was delicious but the trout was a little dry and didn't absorb the taste of the tomatoes very well. I had high hopes for this recipe and was pretty disappointed.

LOVED this recipe! I used skin on trout fillets instead of a whole fish and baked sealed with foil for the first 40 minutes then uncovered for 15 more minutes basting frequently. I added the white wine and lemon juice at the outset. Everyone RAVED over it! I am really looking forward to trying it with a whole fish. This recipe could be used on many types of fish. THANKS!

Was very good, but I think a seafood mixture would do even better than trout.

I made with Italian dice tomatoes and added dried parsley. I didn't worry about basting with wine or adding extra garlic. I otherwise made it according to recipe (did not cover), and it was delicious. We will definitely have this again.

A++ in my books for simplicity and flavour.  All the other reviews were right on the money.  I only did a single filet and so I diced a whole fresh tomato rather than a can of tomatoes.  This is a very heathly, wholesome meal with a lot of flavour.  Pair with vegetables of your choice and you have a perfect, low cal, low fat, nutrient packed meal.

I'm always looking for easy low calorie ways to make fish. This is a winner. I used filets and didn't bother to baste.  Served it with cous cous as someone else suggested and it was excellent!

The recipe was definitely very easy to make. I personally didn't love the flavors, but one of my guests couldn't get enough of it.

Delicious and super easy. We used Blue Ridge Mountain Trout and fresh parsley out of the garden for the farm to table feel. I would encourage the tomatoes to be crushed fresh if you have them, otherwise the Can works. I made sure to towel dry the trout before sticking it in the oven. I did not use white wine based on the reviews and my personal experience, but rather added a little more lemon juice. Once in my dish, aluminum foil over the top for 35 minutes and done. I could see pouring the juices and tomatoes over rice for a side dish but we had the salad and fresh fruit for tonight. Big hit with the husband, 7 year old but the 3 year only ate 1/2 and wanted ketchup. I’d still say a win!

Very easy prep, cook and clean. Desperate to use garden zuchinni and squash, I diced up one of each, and mixed them in with the tomato mixture, with delicious results.

This trout recipe was awesome! I've never had trout with tomatoes in it and it was delicious! For my recipe tonight I modified the recipe a bit, I used: 4 Roma tomatoes, a handful of cilantro, 1/2 of a red onion and salt & pepper to taste. It came out super yummy! I'm totally going to recommend this to my mom!

This dish was easy to make and I followed a couple of suggestions and used fresh tomatoes with italian seasoning instead of canned tom's and added more garlic.  Grocery store did not have trout available, so I tried it with snapper and it turned out great!  The family said keep the recipe so we'll make it again!

This was super easy to make, very tasty, and super lowfat.  I'm on weight watchers and this fit in nicely to my points range for dinner.  I chopped 3 fresh tomatoes, added  1/2 chopped onion, and a  de-seeded jalapeno pepper which gave great flavor.  I realize I don't know how to debone a fish very well so we ended up spending a lot of time picking out bones.  Would make this again.

My husband and I love to fish, I made this the first weekend of trout and it was delish!!  Very tasty and super easy.  I plan on using this often as long as the fish are biting.

WONDERFUL RECIPE! We loved every bit of it and the guests were thrilled as well :)

Made it again but since kids were eating this time I used fresh lemon juice in place of the wine ;) Just as great!
