I'm sorry - but I tried this recipe last night - very excited, because I THOUGHT 
it sounded like my moms recipe from years ago which I lost! Well sadly, it did 
not even come close! I have used may recipies from tis site to make wonderful 
dishes from appetizers to desserts - all successfully! This is a fiasco - not only did the THICK batter resemble cookie dough, and taste like 
wallpaper paste, but I also burned out my electic mixer... I am VERY dissapointed.
I am sorry - truly.
P.S. Could there be an error on the recipe ingredients? If so - that could explain 
why mine was so terrible! (I followed directions and measured accurately!)

i think this recipe is really good because it only has 5 ingredients which you can easily find at home! i did this at school and it turned out perfect, actually better than i thought it would! if a 13 yr old can do it it must be easy lol. :)

This was the worst recipe I have ever gotten off of the website.  I had to quick come up with something for a funeral dinner so I thought I would make this because it was quick and sounded like it would be good.  I couldn't even serve it.  I don't know if there was ingrediants that were left out of this printing or what but I will never make this again.

Despite the mixed reviews I decided to try out this recipe. I tweaked it a bit and ended up with a chocolate chip cake/bread loaf. I did 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup oil, 2 1/2 cups flour, 4 eggs, sugar, and some vanilla. I mixed it all in my stand mixer and added milk to reach a cake batter texture. I also folded in chocolate chips. I baked it in a loaf pan. It came out dense and the cake part was a little bland. All in all it was OK, a little dry. Maybe good if served with pudding, custard, or fruit sauce. Would only make again if in a really tight pinch.

it was really nice with some icing on top. I think i done well for a teenager cooking this. i will be cooking this again. people say it's too dry but why can't you just add what you want to it? I found it great because i didn't have to go out to the shops to get extra ingredients. I was really happy.

I have tried this recipe before, but forgot how it turned out. Today I decided to try it again and after I had mixed it all up I checked the reviews to discover a bad rating. Mine was wonderful! BUT I changed the recipe a bit. TIPS:
Add 3 tbs. milk for better texture
Add melted white chocolate almond bark
Cover in white frosting!
I know the recipe is bad, but with a few changes it is delicious!

I've made this cake twice to make strawberry shortcake. I love it. It's just right for fruit, not too sweet. It has a teacake taste to it. Both times that I made it, I used canola oil instead of the butter to reduce the saturated fat and it still turned out great.

I have just used this recipe, Instead of using less flour, add apple juice to get the consistency you prefer. It's just common sense, recipes are a guide, you don't have to follow them as if it were law. I also made this recipe, leaving out the fruit and choc chips, instead added a can of chopped pineapple with it's juice from the tin, came out perfect, oh and I added cinnamon as well. The easiest and most adaptable cake recipe I've found online. Cheers for sharing!

I have just put the cake in the oven, but I did realize that there wasn't enough wet ingredients so I added both sour cream and some milk.  I am sure it will be fine, but the original recipe's proportions were a bit off..

I registered here simply to comment on this recipe. I could not believe it! There is no way no matter how precise you are with the measuring of this recipe that you will get a cake using the instructions exactly as they are listed here. I had to tweak the recipe so that it would be at the least the consistency of cake batter. Based on the other comments I am scared to see what it will taste like once it is our of the oven. We'll see.

Very satisfied with this recipe.  A little dense, kind of like a shortbread.  I needed a quick cake that used only four eggs.  On a gamble, I baked it in a decorative bunt pan, swirled in some mixed berry jam for a marble effect, and it turned out great!
