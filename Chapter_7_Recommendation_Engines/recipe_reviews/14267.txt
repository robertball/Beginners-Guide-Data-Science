Nothing could be quicker than this and so much better than store bought.  The one thing I find with store bought is it's just too sweet - you can control the sweetness yourself with this one.  I didn't cut back on the sugar the first time and found it a tad too sweet - so I added some dry powdered mustard and more black pepper to overcome that. I also used all buttermilk (making my own out of 1/2 cup milk - l/2 tablespoon of white vinegar - let sit for 10 minutes). By the way - the longer your coleslaw sits the runnier it will get because the cabbage leaks out water when it is mixed with the dressing - which is a good thing - you are getting the taste of cabbage.  The longer it sits the more flavorful it becomes. I always try to make coleslaw way in advance (as much as three days).  You can always transfer it to another bowl before serving to get rid of the excess juices if you like.  My fellow cooks - think about it - do you think that KFC and stores are preparing their slaw one hour before our purchase???  Thanks submitter - its a keeper and really nothing has to be changed - my minor change of now just using a tad less sugar and all buttermilk is just a matter of preferance.

Very good.  In order to prevent the slaw from being runny, I usually put the salt on the cabbage & carrots to let some of the water out of them for about 1 hr or so and drain it before mixing other ingredients.  Result: less runny slaw.

This recipe is a GREAT one! I have made it many times. I found a similar recipe in a cookbook by Todd Wilbur (Top Secret Recipes). In the cookbook this recipe calls for 8 cups chopped cabbage and 1/4 cup shredded carrots, everything else is the same. This may help if you are making your own mix. He also states to make sure to let cole slaw sit at least two hours before serving. Happy Cooking!!

Wonderful recipe. I use half the cabbage and the let it sit for twenty four hours, for the flavors to mix. Prior to serving I take the unused cabbage, soak it in ice water for half an hour then after draining it I put it in the spinner to dry it out. Then I fold it all together, and serve. This gives you the Flavor, and the crunchiness. Nector of the gods.

Excellent!!!  It does tend to get runny if stored, so I make the dressing and keep it in a separate container, mixing just enough cabbage and dressing on a meal by meal basis when I need it.  Dressing keeps well for about 5-6 days...in fact it gets better with age!  Really wonderful!  Also, if you don't have any buttermilk on hand, you can buy the powdered buttermilk (Sago is one brand I have found).  Perfect when you need only 1/4 cup!

YUM!  This is very good.  I didn't have any buttermilk on hand, so I used 1/2 cup of milk, 2 tbsp. of white vinegar & 3 tbsp of lemon juice (common subs).  I'm sure it altered the taste, but this was still YUMMY!!  Thanks Marsha!!

Just like the title says, this tastes like the real thing. If you love coleslaw (or even just like it), be sure to try this recipe.

Outstanding! I made this for a crowd of picky eaters and they loved it. I did cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and I used apple cider vinegar because that's what I had. Several reviewers have mentioned that this makes a lot of sauce so I used 3 lbs. of coleslaw mix with a double batch of sauce - perfect!

with minor adjustments to suit my tastes, this is hands down THE best coleslaw... EVER.  I've made this countless times and every time everyone raves and my kids ask for seconds and even thirds (weird!).  I decrease the sugar to a 1/4 cup and leave out the milk- I hate soupy coleslaw and it just isn't necessary.  Everything else I leave the same (using light mayo- Hellmans/Best Foods), and sometimes forget to add the onion.  We love to eat it both freshly made (crispier, yum) or up to 3 days old.  The longer it sits the more the salt will draw out the water from the cabbage- I ust pour off the excess water before stirring.  Delicious!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

You're not kidding, This is Finger licking good. Mine was not runny although after reading other reviews I did the following: Added a little more mayo to the mixture to thicken it a bit and didn't use all of the sauce in the coleslaw.  I did let mine set in the fridge for couple of hours. *NOTE* for the one who said it wasn't creamy enough----You MUST use buttermilk

Excellent slaw, Marsha! I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and used 3T tarragon vinegar rather than white wine vinegar and lemon juice. You get the same kick with less pucker. I used head cabbage and pulsed it in my kitchen aid because I like the bits of cabbage to be more rice or orzo size. This is a keeper!

I am giving this 4 stars due to the fact it gets a little runny as everyone already knows but you can fix that by replacing the milk and buttermilk with sour cream. The sour cream is thicker and holds to the slaw while still giving you the "tang" that buttermilk provides. I do add my favorite spices but this is excellent with BBQ pulled pork!

Noticing a number of reviews that commented on the runny liquid of the slaw, I did two things to avoid this problem:  (1)added a little more mayonnaise to the mixture to thicken it a bit and (2)didn't use all of the sauce in the coleslaw.  I added a little bit of sauce to the coleslaw at a time until I reached a good consistency.  Then, I periodically stirred the coleslaw to ensure I didn't need more liquid.  End result was that I had a good 1/2 cup of liquid that I didn't use, making the coleslaw less runny.  Excellent recipe.

I cut back on the sugar a little, but otherwise it was great.  I like adding some small chunks of apple (spartan) with the skin on it gives the dish some nice colour and some different texture.  The kids really enjoy the salad with the pieces of apple mixed in.  Will be one of the classics in my book.

To me KFC is the best coleslaw and every other slaw I've tried has fallen short.  This was EXACTLY like KFC and it was fantastic.  I doubled it and took it to a barbecue and there were hardly any leftovers!  Several people commented on how tasty it was and went back for seconds.  I let it chill 2 hours and the onion flavor was very strong, but the next day it was perfect.  Next time I would either make this a day in advance, or else use half the onion if serving the same day.  If you want to duplicate the Colonel's recipe at home, this is it (much cheaper too)! If you don't like it so runny, with the amount of dressing this calls for, you can easily use double the cabbage mix and it turns out great!  However if you eliminate the buttermilk I would suggest compensating with a little extra mayo which makes it a lot creamier.  If you need another excuse to buy a quart of buttermilk I would suggest pairing this coleslaw with Breaded Chicken Fingers from this site, which calls for a buttermilk marinade :)

I forgot how good homemade coleslaw could be!This recipe is sweet, but also has some tanginess to it.  The only thing I didn't like is that the dressing is watery and runs through the coleslaw to the bottom of the bowl.  The second time I made this, I thickened it using 2 Tbsp. of vegetable oil.  The vegetable oil makes it creamier and it coats the slaw better.

This was delicious. But as others have noted, the dressing is VERY runny.  I will make it again, but I will gradually add the milk and buttermilk to see if I can make it a bit creamier and not quite so runny. It appears to me I could reduce the liquids by half and it would help.

This is an okay recipe.  The only problem that I continue to run into is that the coleslaw ends up a bit more soupy than I would like it to.  Perhaps cutting back the amount of liquid could prevent this from happening.

Here's my 25 cents: first of all - made day in advance. I happened to find a really small inner head of cabbage (1 lb) and used my Moulinex to shred it along w/the carrot. I had a bit over 4 cups of cabbage, but I used entire dressing amounts. I guess because I had shredded the majority of inside of a cabbage, I didn't get much drainage of juice after salting...so...I rinsed it and let it dry on a tea towel. Anyway...I didn't use plain milk at all, only buttermilk.  I did use suggestion by DIZ re: added a tsp of olive oil and whipped up dressing with immersion blender. Next day my slaw was very 'tight' so I added enough milk to loosen it up a bit. I did add celery seed and onion powder as well. At first taste it wasn't anything special but next day it was just what I was looking for. I did reduce sugar slightly (personal pref). I usually make coleslaw for pulled pork or BBQ chicken sandwiches so I don't need large amounts. 1/2 the slaw with entire amounts for dressing worked out perfectly for me. Not hard to tweak for personal tastes but really needs time to marinate for best flavor. I like it!

I followed the recipe and the results were outstanding! I usually just buy the coleslaw dressing in the jar and mix it with cabbage and carrots- but never again. I may try to salt the cabbage to let some of the juices out beforehand, as a commenter posted, but other than that i wont change a thing.

I used less sugar, no milk ( used Miracle Whip light, didn't seem to need it?) and added celery seed.  Very good, used to top BBQ sandwiches.

For those of you familiar with Lucky Wishbone, my husband loves their coleslaw.  When he tried this one, he said it wasn't Lucky Wishbone, but it was just as good.  I added a little extra pepper because I like the kick it gives it.

Very good coleslaw!  I did have to modify slightly using what I had on hand, subbing with apple cider vinegar, onion powder, and omitting the regular milk..using just the 1/4 c buttermilk.  I used the Tri-Color coleslaw mix that I pulsed a few times in the food processor to get a finer texture and also added a little celery seed. Was soo good!

Made my own buttermilk per other directions, but other than that followed the recipe to a T.  The taste was wonderful, yes it tasted a bit like KFC, but actually much better! It turned out really soggy (as I made it the night before) but I just used a slotted spoon to transfer it to the serving bowl.  This fed 4 people at our house- everyone had seconds.

Great recipe!  If I can offer a suggestion; to stop the watery-runny salad, a few hours before you make it, put the cabbage in a strainer or the strainer part of your salad spinner(with a bowl or deep plate underneath) sprinkle the cabbage with TABLE salt, toss and let sit to drain.   After 2-3 hours, taste the cabbage - if its too salty you can add a little water to rinse, then pat dry or spin the cabbage in your salad spinner.  If its not too salty then just spin or pat dry the cabbage (to remove any remaining water).   This removes so much of the water!  You'll never suffer from watered-down dressing again!

This is really good coleslaw.  I let it rest for 4 hours before serving.  I'll never buy coleslaw from the deli again.  Between this and Creamy Spiced Coleslaw from this site it's hard to decide which to make...........

This is a great slaw recipe! Have made several times, and my husband who is very ,very picky even liked it. The only fault I had the first time I made it was the end result was to runny. The secomd time I decided to ommit the buttermilk and use half the milk that the recipe calls for. I only had regular white vinegar on hand, did not use any lemon juice. Trust me these minor changes did not affect the taste of this great tasting recipe! * NOTE: The cabbage and carrots will lose water, the sugar will also break down into liquid form. The second batch was perfect, not runny, and oh so delicious!!  Thanks for this flavorful recipe it is a keeper!

Better than any restaurant I've been. Substituted red wine vinegar for the white.  Nice update to original. Would serve this to anyone.

This is very good.  I cut the sugar and oil in half just as a personal preference.  My mom has always been the "cole slaw queen" in our family.  Now, she always asks me to bring this to our family functions.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a keeper.  However, I adjusted it just a little.  I omitted the milk, added garlic powder, used apple cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar, and used Splenda instead of sugar.  We loved it!

Broccoli works better for Hubs than does cabbage, so I substituted a packed broccoli slaw mix.  I used Splenda rather than sugar, half the amount called for, and that worked out well for me.  The flavor definitely melds and improves as it stands, so I deliberately made it today for dinner tomorrow.

This is probably the best coleslaw I have ever had -- homemade or in a restaurant. One caveat. I made it in advance of a party, but tasted it immediately after dressing the shredded cabbage. I much prefer the "crispiness" of the just dressed slaw vs. the more wilted version you get after an hour or so.

Great coleslaw recipe! I left out the buttermilk since I didn't have any and it tasted exactly like I expected it would. ETA: I made it again without doubling the dressing and using buttermilk: it's so much better that way! Don't change an iota and you'll get very close to the real thing! Some people complaint the coleslaw turns out soupybut isn't is runny at that "particular restaurant mentioned in the name of the recipe"?

Simply delicious.  I read some reviews, and left out the milk.  But after the first chill I tasted it and added the same amount of sour cream.  That gave it the mouth feel I was looking for.  Also, next time I think I'll cut back on the vinegar, about a third off I should think.  Sugar and salt quantities were right on.  Thanks for a great recipe!
For those wanting to chop their own, this is what I used: 1/2 head of green cabbage, 2 carrots, 1/2 green bell pepper, all sliced or shredded thinly.

This has an excellent flavored dressing. I have searched for years trying to get the flavor this recipe has. I did add some green pepper, shredded carrot and celery seed, plus my husband likes a little horse radish added. This will be a favorite.

This was okay.  Not the best I've ever had (not "zingy" enough), but a solid recipe and non-offensive.  It does get a tad runny; just drain some of the liquid off.

This was pretty good slaw. I found the dressing just a touch too tangy and I think I would cut back on the vinegar next time, but no real complaints about this. I didn't have the buttermilk, so just increased the milk and the lemon juice a little. Not bad at all.

This is the best coleslaw. I made it for the first time in March and I have probably made it ten times since. The only change I made was to use only 2 tbls. of sugar. Great recipe.

A couple of minor changes make coleslaw lovers out of 2 members of my family. A little extra milk and buttermilk and a little less mayo and substitute pineapple juice for the lemon juice. I also increased the black pepper, just because i like it.

Tried MANY recipes for Cole Slaw before.  They were either too mayoie or sweet.  This one has a nice blend of flavors.  I used Hellimans Lite Mayo, low fat buttermilk, and skim milk.  It was lower in fat, but not in taste!

I brought this to the 4th of July party (we have over 30 in our family) and all of the adults loved it.  My husband is a big fan of KFC slaw and this tested out well with him.  I made the dressing a couple of days ahead to let the flavors blend together and then I mixed it together when ready to serve.  I had some left overs (I made a double batch) and ate some of it two days later and found the slaw still crunchy and just as good when freshly mixed.

Another well planned recipe from allrecipes from somebody that knew what they were doing.  Bland?  No way.  I can't imagine a simple cole slaw recipe offering any more flavor.  Yes, it was a bit soupy, but that's not a problem for me.  One wants the cabbage to be covered liberally with the wet ingredients. Isn't that where the FLAVOR comes from?  Sweet, but creamy.  Simple, but complex.  This one will be in regular rotation at our house.

This is a really good recipe.  You can use  skim milk with no consistency worries.  I also used reduced fat mayo and did not taste the difference.  I highly recommend that you keep the dressing separate, and mix what you need when you want it -- this will keep the dish from getting soggy.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is the best coleslaw I have EVER tasted. I didn't change a thing and it was great.  I didn't use the prepared coleslaw mix and I made more than the 16 oz. I had to make extra dressing to make it creamy.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Its ablsolutely delecious. WOW!

YUM!!  This coleslaw is wonderful!  I made a batch for a cookout we had this weekend and I made another batch for Father's Day.  It was a hit at both gatherings.  I made it exactly like the recipe said and then threw in some blue cheese crumbles. Tastes just like the blue cheese coleslaw at a popular local restaurant.

I tried this recipe on my husband (a notoriously picky eater) and he loved it!  This is a recipe box keeper for sure.  The only thing I noticed was that my coleslaw had quite a bit of liquid in the bottom of the bowl.  Anyone else have the same thing happen?

I've tried several "restaurant knockoffs" but this is the best. I could have eaten the whole container. Will definitely make it again and again and again.

This is okay but not quite up to what was expected given its overall high rating. Something in the flavor seemed slightly off . . . perhaps the lemon juice was a bit overpowering but just not sure if that was it. Having made “Dave’s Coleslaw” (recipe on this site) the week before, that made for a tough comparison as it was better suited for our tastes.

I used Kevin's suggestions 3# bag to a double batch of dressing and it worked out well to make a large bowl.  Also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and tossed in a bit of extra lemon juice (1 fresh lemon's worth)Good as is.   Personally like celery seeds and a bit more onion next time

Excellent coleslaw!  I let it sit for about 1.5 hours and the flavour was awesome!  I think next time I would take the advice of others in letting the salt soak up the moisture as the salad was quite runny.  Very good salad!!

This coleslaw is very good! In addition to the pre-packaged coleslaw I added more grated carrots. I minced 2T of Maui Sweet Onions and followed the rest of the ingredients and directions for this recipe. I let this marinate for 9 hours and it was worth waiting for! It is very creamy with a sweet and slight "tang". It is flavorful with the right amount of seasonings. I like the sweet crunchiness in every bite especially the sweetness of the onions. This dressing really needs to marinate all day or overnight because it does make a world of difference in taste. The longer the cabbage, carrots and onion sits in the dressing, the more flavorful the coleslaw. We all enjoyed this alongside our dinner. I served this on top of, "BBQ Chicken Sandwiches," also from this website.

I doubled this recipe so i could take it to a potluck with the neighbors.  I used the BIG, giant bag of coleslaw mix from Sam' club. I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted sour cream. I added celery seed as I just like the way it looks in slaw! Also added extra kosher salt to my taste.

I omitted the buttermilk altogether as I didn't have any and didn't want it to be too runny and used a bit less sugar. Altogether pretty yummy.  I do recommend letting it sit for a  few hours for best flavor.

After I started making it I realized that I didn't have all of the ingredients like I though...so I improvised. I used half a head of cabbage (for 4 servings), dried onion flakes instead of fresh, half and half instead of buttermilk, and distilled vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I made the rest as is and added approx 1/2 teaspoon of dried mustard. It tastes awesome! We are eating it with a pulled pork recipe from this site "Slow Cooker Pulled Pork  
By: Livie's Mammy."

As coleslaws go, this one was one of the best I have made.  Sweet w/light onion flavor and the dressing was fairly thin, not too thick.

LOVE THIS!!! Just perfect! Except for the sugar. Half the amount is sufficient. I have been omitting the MILK, because the salt releases liquid from the cabbage. Lately, SOUR CREAM is what I have been substituting for the milk and buttermilk. Amazing. A few dashes of celery powder/salt is the final touch.

This was very, very good. My only alteration was to omit the onion, as we are not fans. I did add a sprinkle of onion powder just to give it a faint taste, though. Very good, and is the absolute closest I've had to KFC's (the only coleslaw I like). Thanks!

This coleslaw is the best!  I have made it several times and the only thing I change is I add apple cider vinegar and about half the amount it calls for.  I don't like much of a vinegar taste.  I was actually surprised at how it holds up.  It doesn't make the veggies soft, they stay real crunchy!  Even a day later the vegetables still have a crunch to them!  The sauce seems really thin at first when your whipping it up but just let it refrigerate for awhile and it turns out sooo creamy!  Its good both ways...to eat it a few hours later where the sauce is creamy or eat it right away with the sauce a little runny.  Excellent and the best!

Excellent recipe!  My only alteration was to not use the milk, as the cabbage will wilt and release some liquid from the salt.  I think it makes it less runny.  But a great combo of remaining ingredients.

This was really good. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I made a few changes (for the better I think) I omitted the onion, used sour cream in place of buttermilk to keep it creamier and less runny and I also added roasted sunflower seeds and chopped apple - a must to any good coleslaw I think. It got rave reviews at a family dinner last weekend.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I'm sure I would have loved it if I had followed the recipe exactly.  I love sweet coleslaw and I chose this recipe because one of the reviewers said it reminded her of Kentucky Fried Chicken's cole slaw which I adore.  I made the mistake of reducing the sugar that another reviewer suggested.  Had I followed at the recipe as written, it would have been perfect.  I personally did not really care for the onion flavor; my husband loved it.  I would suggest tasting it before you add the onion; if you love it as is, don't add onion.  I don't think you need it.

This recipe is great.  The only changes I made were to reduce the onion and leave out the milk but still add the amount of buttermilk that is called for in the recipe. I also let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.

 For the one review that said the coleslaw wasn't creamy enough, it is because you didn't add the buttermilk, that is what makes this recipe, you can't really leave it out.  

I made this for a BBQ last Saturday and all the guys raved about it.  This is the only recipe I am ever going to need for coleslaw.

This is the kind of recipe that rounds out a delicious grilled meal. Everyone should have this recipe in their repertoire. There is nothing mind blowing about it -- just a respectable homemade slaw that everyone will enjoy. Superior to store-bought dressings for coleslaw and way better than what you can get from the deli.

My husband and I love coleslaw, and now we can make it at home!  We've made this recipe several times.  We don't normally have buttermilk on hand, so we use lemon juice to sour regular milk.  The first time we made it, it was a bit too lemony, and we just had regular vinegar on hand.  The second time used the white wine vinegar and halved the lemon juice.  This time it was perfect.  This is a keeper!

I made this for my family of 6 and they loved it! Even the non-coleslaw eaters were begging for more. The dressing is creamy and the proportions seem to work exactly right. I did not have buttermilk and instead substituted the correct proportion of milk + vinegar (learned about this on the food channel) and it turned out the same. DELICIOUS!!!

Oh my seven of us for lunch and not a scrap of this left when we finished. One adjustment I will make next time though is to reduce the sugar as it was a little bit too sweet for me and my daughter but nobody else seemed to have a problem with it. Many thanks

I made this just like the recipe stated except for...I did not add salt, as I think this is what makes it "soupy".  It does not affect the flavor at all.  I only used 2 tablespoons of splenda, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and almost 3/4 c. mayonnaise.  My husband absolutely loved it and he is giving it a definite 5 star rating.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Great coleslaw dressing!  A teeny bit watery after sitting for a few hours.  Next time I will omit the 1/4 cup milk to thicken it up a bit.  Might also reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.

AMAZING! had to make it diabetic, so substituted sugar for splenda, and instead of using milk and buttermilk, just used a cup of light miracle whip.

i don't even like coleslaw, i was just making it for a cookout, but this was incredible!

This coleslaw was really good.  I did not change anything.  I had to make dinner for a professional caterer who was recuperating from surgery and made this coleslaw for part of the dinner.  She said it was the best coleslaw she ever ate!

very very good and creamy. the amount of dressing was good, and increased over time. like others said just used a slotted spoon. i used a little less sugar because of my own taste. this is wonderful with the north carolina pulled pork on this site.
it is better after sitting overnight in the fridge.

Okay, when I have a taste for coleslaw this is what I want! It is excellent. I even forgot to add the lemon juice and it was still awesome. I did make a few alterations, though. Since I didn't have a package of coleslaw mix, I used a grater to grate enough cabbage to make about 4 cups. I also added 3 small carrots, grated. And to make it low fat, I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and I used Miracle Whip instead of the mayonnaise. Also, I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1/4 cup 2% milk and 1/2 tbsp vinegar. Despite all these changes this is still the BEST COLESLAW I'VE EVER EATEN!!!!!!!

I love this coleslaw TOO much. It is is perfect- creamy, sweet, and a bit tart. It was so easy as well.  This is going to become my *secret* recipe for coleslaw!  

note: we do not like onions so I left them out and it was still delicious.

Mmmmmm...this recipe was so good, and I don't even like coleslaw!  Instead of a bagged mix I grated two carrots and used 1/2 head of fresh farmer's market cabbage.  I also used miracle whip and splenda to cut back the calories and fat a little.  It does get juicier after a day in the fridge - I personally like it a little crunchier, but it tasted fine even after it was a little soggy.  Great recipe, perfect for using up the leftover cabbage and SO much better than the stuff you buy at the deli.

We loved this slaw!  I was a little hesitant when I saw how thin the dressing was, but I was happily surprised when we sat down to dinner.  I sliced the onions on a mandoline, so they were paper thin and other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the recipe!!

very good, easy to make.  I left out the buttermilk and added a 1/3 cup milk instead of 1/4 cup.  I also used a little more than a 16 oz package of coleslaw mix.

We thought this was too sweet and didn't like the addition of the buttermilk.  I will use this as a base recipe, leaving out the buttermilk, use only 2 tablespoons of sugar and add some garlic powder and celery seed, 2 tablespoons of vinegar and no lemon.

I tried this as listed and my husband thought it was KFC. Now we're trying to cut carbs so I subbed
Splenda for sugar and heavy(whipping) cream for
the milk and buttermilk and it tastes just as
great-also not as watery. This is really simple to
make, too.

The flavor was excellent! As suggested by others, I used just 1/4 cup sugar and added celery seed. My only complaint is that the dressing was very runny. But, once I switched to using a slotted spoon, that problem was taken care of. I made a big batch for a cookout this weekend and got loads of compliments.

This is the best recipe and so easy to make! I have to make it for my boyfriend at least once a week! When we have KFC sometimes, I have to make this recipe instead of ordering their cole slaw.
This is a keeper!!!

I always make this slaw the night before - it gets a lot more tender. It can get a little soupy though, so I just serve it with a slotted spoon, or strain it into a fresh container.

When I was mixing up everything, started having doubts about the recipe.  Boy was I wrong!  This cole slaw recipe was WONDERFUL!  My husband is picky about not wanting too sweet of taste.  He LOVED this!  I've never made cole slaw...he kept asking me-- are you sure YOU made it and didn't buy it pre-made?  What a compliment!  Followed recipe as written and would highly recommend this recipe!  I did make it in the morning and left it all day in the refrigerator.  Think that probably improved the taste.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!  Now one of our fav "go to" recipes :-)

Make this all the time.  Found it got really runny so I replace the buttermilk with a 1/4 c. of sour cream.  I also up the ground pepper amount cause we're pepper people...but this is a hot every time!!!

Pretty darned good.  I, too, thought it was a little sweet but since we are using it mainly to top off some tangy pulled pork sandwiches it adds a nice flavour.  If I were making this a strictly a side salad, I would cut back just a little on the sugar and perhaps add a little more vinegar.  But this recipe DOES deliver as advertised.... tasted like popular restaurant coleslaw.

I usually read the reviews and then decide on where I'm going to go with the recipe. It was made as written and was excellent. The recipe didn't say dried or fresh minced onion. I used fresh red onion. Made my own buttermilk. For a half cup ( recipe calls for 1/4 cup ) put a half tablespoon vinegar into a half cup of milk and stir well ). It's the best from scratch made slaw I've ever made.

I am not a fan of coleslaw but I made this for my husband. He loved it; said it was the best he's ever had. I let it sit for 24 hours and it was a little runny but nothing a slotted spoon couldn't fix. I will be making this again.

I loved it and it is so easy.  I did have to change just a little but nothing major.  Didn't have white wine vinegar so I used white distilled vinegar.  No buttermilk but I made my own w/ milk, lemon juice and vinegar(let it sit at least 10mins to set). I wanted some celery taste so I added celery salt and left out some of the salt.  So many said they had to let it sit for at least 2 hrs (which it does get better with age) but it is still delish just after making if you don't have time.  You could leave out some of the milk so there isn't so much liquid but we like it that way.  I WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN!

Perfection! I followed the recipe exactly except for eyeballing the  black pepper and onion. I also didn't use 1/3 cup of sugar....I did about 3 heaping tablespoons of sugar instead (1/3 cup is about 5 heaping tablespoons, so I cut it by a little less than half). I let it sit several hours in the fridge while I made my honey barbecue shredded pork for sandwiches in the slow cooker, then I had this and baked potatoes for the side dish. It made a great meal!

This was really good.  I did make a couple of changes to help it be a little healthier and cut out all the sugar.  Instead of sugar I added 2 packets of stevia, and instead of buttermilk I added lowfat, plain Kefir.  That took the sugar out, lowered the fat, and added probiotics.  Tasted great!

This is the best creamy slaw which has ever graced our table!  CHANGES? - We do use yogurt or low-fat sour cream instead of milk so the results are not runny at all.  Adjust salt and sugar to taste when stirring this up instead of worrying about finding the 'just right recipe'.  LOVE THIS AS IS - LOVE AS TEX-MEX: FOR 'TEX-MEX': SUB some LIME JUICE FOR VINEGAR, SWEETEN TO TASTE TO BALANCE IT OUT - WE INCLUDE 'TAMED' JALAPENOS--- I love a vinegar & oil slaw, but when I want a crowd pleaser, this is usually it, because most people I know, like my husband, prefer a creamy coleslaw!

I make this as written except halving the sugar because we find it too sweet, but that's just our preference. I use vegan mayo and skim milk(also to make the buttermilk).  We usually make a vinaigrette dressing so this is kind of a special treat. Much of the sauce tends to end up in the bottom of the bowl so I use a wider, shallow dish to keep more of the veggies marinating and then stir before serving.

This is my go-to slaw recipe - it tastes so much better than anything store-bought!  I think next time I make it, I am going to try some of the reviewers' suggestions - salt the cabbage and carrots to let some of the water out, and keeping the dressing and slaw mix separate and mixing only as much as needed at a time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I made it to use on some sandwiches. Out of preference I did cut the sugar in half, even though it wasn't much compared to some coleslaw recipes, and the lemon juice back about a Tblsp less. I didn't want it too sweet or tart. It worked well for what I needed today. Thank you

I have made Coleslaw a long time ago and it was pretty bad so I figured I would try this recipe out due to such high reviews. I used the bagged prepared coleslaw and made exactly what recipe calls for. I thought it was delicious and will definitely be making this again as a side dish. I have to try the coleslaw at every restaurant I go to and this is a recipe that contends with some of the best ones out there. Thanks for sharing!!

My favorite coleslaw recipe, so far.  I've tried several since I started liking coleslaw.  This was by far the best.  I made it as directed and I didn't find it to be runny at all.  I really thought it would be; I've never made a recipe with milk or buttermilk.  My mom doesn't like sweet coleslaw and she said the sweetness level was perfect.  I probably added just a little less sugar than called for.

The only improvement I can suggest to this slaw is to run the cabbage/slaw mix thru the food processor to grind it up into smaller pieces if your grocery store does not sell it that way (mine does not), makes it that much more delicious and like the chicken restaraunt slaw so many love.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make it again and again.

it's a really great and yammy recipe. I changed it just a little bit - because i dont like the taste of mayo that much i use light mayo and mix it with Yogurt 3/1. And i really love the taste of orange in coleslaw i mixed Lemon juice with orange juice 1/1. I also added poppy seeds into the dressing. Came out great! Thank you for sharing!!

I made this as specified/except I used 1/8 less cup of milk and put that 1/8 on the buttermilk side is all. OK I took others advise to only mix this 1 hour before eating.. MISTAKE PEOPLE! I mixed the base up 6 hours before and let it set in the fridge WITHOUT the coleslaw in it.. But here is the MISTAKE. If you don't mix it together 6 hours before it is not going to break down like it should so you coleslaw will taste dry. SO TRUST me MIX it all together 6 hours before hand. After mine set in the fridge for 6 hours it was PERFECT! So I strongly suggest to mix it ahead of time. This IS my NEW coleslaw recipe! TY so much for sharing it! LOVE it and it was a big hit with my coleslaw making mother. She asked for the recipe!

This was a very good recipe! I shared it with my whole family. I did hold off on putting the dressing on until just before serving - because I did not want it to be too runny. I also added some hot sauce to the mix - just for a little kick and wow was it AMAZING. This one will be made over and over!

Didn't knock my socks off - but - was a great addition to the "Slowcooker Buffalo Chicken" sandwiches I made for a family get tog. I prefered it on top of the sandwich much more than eating it alone. I followed the recipe with the exception of using all buttermilk and let it set in the fridge for about 30 hrs. Will try the leftovers today and see if I like it better. Don't take me wrong - I did appreciate the recipe - I think I'm just not a big cole slaw fan. BUT I would make it again for ontop of a hot sandwich! Thanks

I use the store-bought angel hair cut coleslaw mix. I only use 1/2 the bag, use regular white vinegar, I grate onion & carrots into it & it's GREAT! I've been using this recipe for well over a year and everyone says it's EXACTLY like KFC's, some even say it's better! :)

This was really good!  I usually alter recipes so here is what I did:  I put all of the ingredients except the vegetables in the bowl of my food processor along with some fresh parsley and I substituted Splenda for the sugar to lower the calories.  With a cutting blade I pulsed them until smooth and added the onion and pulsed it a few times.  Then, using the shredding disc,  I shredded half a head of cabbage and a carrot over the top of the dressing.  Pour into a bowl and mix.  So easy and tastes much better than the ready made coleslaw mix!  I loved it.

This coleslaw goes great with my Hot and Spicy Ribs and Carolina Pulled Pork.  Every time I have made this it gets rave reviews.  It really does taste a lot like the Colonel's coleslaw.

I really wanted to love this. It's more of a 3.5 star recipe---good, but not The Best EVer. The dressing is just too thin for coleslaw. The buttermilk adds a nice flavor, but between the buttermilk and the milk, the coleslaw was swimming in liquid. I only used half the dressing (saved the rest for another day), but it was still so soupy. The milk is totally unnecessary, as it contributes to the wateriness, but adds no flavor. I'd leave it out. Also, the dressing could use something more. Needed just a touch of zip, perhaps. Anyway, it was good enough, but I'll keep looking for "great."

My family enjoyed this cole slaw (even the one claiming not to like cole slaw).  However, I jumped the gun on the amount of dressing, it didn't look like enough so I doubled it, forgetting the water in the cabbage would cause it to be more "juicy".  So by all means, follow the recipe as far as the amount of dressing to use.  Here are the minor changes I made, instead of minced onion, I used grated onion and instead of regular salt I used celery salt. I would have given the recipe five stars, however, I don't think it holds up well in the fridge after the first day, so I don't recommend making it too far in advance or making much more than needed.

YUM! We loved this coleslaw. There was a lot of dressing at the bottom of the bowl, so I might cut back on that next time, but the flavor of this coleslaw is perfect! I used fresh cabbage, carrots, and red onion since I had them on hand, and it turned out great! Perfect for burgers, bbq sandwiches, brats, or sloppy joes. And we love them all with a side of slaw, so this recipe is a keeper! Thank you!  :)

Perfect sweet creamy coleslaw. It tastes best after it sits for 1 hour in fridge. I noticed the next day the leftover coleslaw had to be drained it was watery. I have made this coleslaw three days in a row and I still love it. The recipe is so easy and can be adjusted to suite eveyone's taste.Less sugar or 2% milk it doesn't matter it still tastes great.

I Love, Love, Love this recipe!!! It is sooo hard to find good coleslaw ( or even eatable) at restaurants. I've never been a huge fan of KFC's slaw either, this recipe is PERFECTION. Everyone raves over this dish when I make it. I take it to all the cook-outs and family get togethers now. I am the Queen of Coleslaw thanks to this recipe. I highly recommend making this the same day you plan to serve it, as the flavors change when you refrigerate it overnight. I always add extra carrots to mine, the bags of mix never have enough carrots in them + organic baby carrots are so sweet and delicious. I usually use Hellmann's Canola Mayonnaise because it's cholesterol free and no one ever notices! I sometimes use half and half instead of milk (depending on what I have on hand) but you can even omit the milk and just use all buttermilk. Many thanks to Marsha for posting this recipe.

Every one raved at the potluck.  Add the dressing at the last minute, it got watery once it sat for a while.  My other reccomendation to to make plenty of this if you are taking it somewhere.

Really nice and creamy coleslaw.  I didn't add as much sugar as called for (personal preference).  We don't have "slaw mix" over here, so I just used grated cabbage--no big deal.  It was nicely seasoned.  Thanks for this recipe; would make again.

Simply divine..... for buttermilk I used about 1/2 tsp cream of tartar and 1/4 C of milk and let it sit for 15 minutes, and I used red wine vinegar instead of the white it calls for. This is even better than KFC if that's possible.

This is the best coleslaw ever!  I followed the recipe almost verbatim, except I chopped up the cabbage myself, I added a little crated carrot, and I used all buttermilk (or, rather, milk with vinegar which I then let sit), and I used lite mayo.  It turned out amazing!  I've made this so many times since I discovered this great recipe!  The first time I made it, my husband said it tasted like KFC's, and I thought he was joking, having seen the recipe reviews I had left open on the computer as I was making dinner.  Of course, he hadn't.  This really does taste like KFC coleslaw.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It's PERFECT! I had never made coleslaw before and i was surprised at how authentic tasting it turned out! As another reviewer said, it tastes better than KFC coleslaw. Just the right amount of light sweetness and not too much tang. For the 'coleslaw mix' I used 1/4 carrot to 3/4 cabbage so the sweetness of the carrot didn't take over. I also added double the onion because I really like onion. Thank you for the fantastic recipe!

My husband and father in law loved this--I'm not a coleslaw person.  I shredded green and red cabbage as well as the carrots.  Thanks to previous reviews, I used an 1/8 tsp of celery seed and 1/2 tps onion powder.  I also used low fat buttermilk and used it in place of regular milk as well.  I did not use onions, but plan on trying that next time.  I will make this again, thanks Marsha.

This is my favourite recipe for coleslaw. I always grate my own vegies rather than buying the store bought packet.  The coleslaw always tastes better the next day but it does become watery.

This is the best cole slaw ever!  I always follow the recipe exactly as it is, however, the other day I really wanted to make it and I had no buttermilk so I doubled the milk. (My husband didn't even notice that it was slightly different.)  It was still really good, but I would prefer to follow the recipe and use buttermilk.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!! My only complaint is that the coleslaw cabbage itself (the pre-shredded cabbage in a bag) was not fine enough. But that has nothing to do with the recipe. The dressing for this is soo good. I made the dressing the night before and kept tasting it right out of the bowl. I tossed the coleslaw with it an hour early. But we had a little leftover and today it is so much wetter and better. I might toss it earlier than an hour before next time. Definitely a keeper. Just have to find a smaller shred of cabbage.

This is handsdown the single best recipe for coleslaw ever (tastes very similar to KFCs).  The only changes I made were to omit the buttermilk (because several reviewers complained about the slaw being too watery), increase the mayo to 2/3 cup and use only 1/4 cup of sugar.  Also, letting the slaw sit overnight really helps the flavors merge together.

I gave this 5 stars because its the best coleslaw I have ever made.  Instead of buttermilk [didn't have any] I used sourcream and it was awsome.  People who don't like coleslaw said it was the first one they liked.

Love this.  I followed it to a T.  Use the buttermilk, it's worth it.  I make this like every week and keep it in the fridge.  We munch on it all week long.  I swear it gets beter with age.  My hubby can't get enough.

This was a great coleslaw recipe.  The buttermilk with the white wine vinegar makes a delicious flavor.  I adjusted the vinegar to my liking and added more salt and pepper and didn't add in all the sugar.  I always wondered how restaurants make their coleslaw and now I know.  So creamy and yummy.  Will be making this again and again.  There are so many good add-ins to try...pineapple chunks, dijon mustard, paprika etc...

I've been looking very long for a good coleslaw recipe, and I do believe my search is over! Made this for my family, served five of us very generously; no leftovers since we polished off the whole bowl in one go! We forgot to add the extra milk, just had the buttermilk and followed the recipe as is...so yummy. Thanks for sharing Marsha, we'll definitely be making this one again.

Perfect!!!  This is the taste I have been trying to find for years.  I'm throwing out most of the coleslaw recipes that are cluttering my recipe box except for a few that are a little different, such as adding pineapple, apple, cheese, broccoli, bacon, etc.  This is the one I will be making most of the time from now on. I buy the 16 oz. bag of coleslaw mix and make the full recipe for the 16 oz. bag.  Since there is only two of us, I only make as much as we need for a meal, storing the sauce in a seperate container for future meals.

This is the best coleslaw. It disappears quickly when I make it. I usually didn't have any buttermilk on hand, so I use 1/2 cup of milk, 2 tbsp. of white vinegar.

Update: After all these years I am still making this coleslaw. Again, I never seem to have white vinegar. Instead I used 1 tablespoon apple cider and 1/2 tbsp white wine. Don't pass this recipe up! If you find that it is getting 'soupy' either add more coleslaw or drain some of the excess liquid. Original Review: I am such picky coleslaw eater...i like sweeter coleslaws and I am so happy to have found one! I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and a few splashes of red wine vinegar. Try this recipe, you will love it.

Good recipe! I love sweet coleslaw, but this was a little to much even for me. First time I made exactly according to direction. The second time however, I made 2 changes. I reduced the sugar amount and the second was adding 1/2 tablespoon of celery seed. Either way this recipe makes a great coleslaw. TY and I will be keeping it for future use.

(I made this about 3 months ago)Im a cole slaw freak! So I decided to make this and it was really good. I didnt change a thing about it. Make sure to let it sit at least 2 hours. I let it set all day being that I was re-doing my house. I made it in the afternoon and then had it later that night with steak! Will make again!

I didn't even like coleslaw. I made this because my mom wanted me to bring some over for dinner. Not only did everyone love it, but I now crave it!

This coleslaw is Delish. I am so tired of a heavy mayo colelaw and yes it is just like the food chain great coleslaw. I left out the 1/4 c buttermilk and did not miss it at all. I think next time I would add a little celery seed; just for old time sake. I find it taste better the second & third day after I make it. Fabulous recipe!! THANKS

The best coleslaw recipe I've tried so far. And it definitely tastes very similar to a certain fast food chicken joint's coleslaw.  However, I found the dressing to be a bit too sweet. I ended up adding an extra 1/2 tsp of vinegar and a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce, and it turned out delicious. This definitely tastes better after sitting awhile in the fridge. I like to make it in the morning or afternoon and serve it at night for dinner. It  tastes even better the 2nd day in my opinion.

I am not a big fan of coleslaw, neither is my boy friend but this was the best I have tasted.  I followed some of the other tips, like adding celery seed, and it gave it a very fresh taste.

This is an awesome basic slaw recipe. I added celery seed like many others but I also added a can of drained mandarin oranges and 1/2 c. of crushed pecans. I used sour cream instead of buttermilk and apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar only because I didn't have the other. This was my first attempt at coleslaw and everyone gave rave reviews! Amazingly easy!!!

I thought that this was WONDERFUL!! Just like I used to get from my old-southern grandmother when I was growing up. I did leave out the milk and used Bulgarian buttermilk (whole milk buttermilk)....It was wonderful! My kids and I could not get enough of it...I ate it right from a bowl for a snack....and as I just made it again, I think I ate about half of it before I put in the fridge for tomorrow....goes great with baked beans and brisket for new years!!!

We LOVED this recipe too! I didn't have white wine vinegar, but my apple cider vinegar worked well as a substitute. Next time I might add more coleslaw mix to eliminate some of the "soupiness," plus, that will make more for leftovers!

This was so easy and so good.  The only change I made was to reduce the sugar from 1/3 cup to 1/4 cup, and it was creamy and good.  I had made a spicy pepper roast, and the coleslaw toned down the "hot" in the spices.  I'll make this dish again soon!

EXCELLENT!  My husband and I practically ate the whole bowl with dinner last night!  I used all buttermilk and Splenda instead of sugar.  It was fantastic!  While it was a little "soupy", WHO CARES!  The taste is what counts, and you can always add extra slaw.  Can't wait to finish it off tonight!

I changed a few things (used cabbage/carrots that I finely chopped, increased sugar), but it was WONDERFUL!  You really need to let it set and chill for more than an hour - at least 12 hours.

I was pretty disappointed. I had to drain this after I made it, despite adding extra cabbage, and it was still soupy. It was mayonaisy like there was no sugar and just overall bland. I let it sit overnight. I didn't think it tasted anything like any restaurant I've been to. If so, they need to find a different slaw recipe. I think the vinegar based slaw is much better-sorry

This recipe is really good!  I add more pepper than it calls for, because my husband likes it a little spicy.  I would suggest letting it sit for more than an hour.  In fact, if you can let it sit over night, it really soaks up the flavor and tastes alot better!  Super recipe!

The flavor was O.K. but after sitting for a couple of hours, it turned too runny for my taste.  Unfortunately, I took it to work for a potluck and not many tried it.

Used the recipe as a starter, but wanted non-dairy so substituted just less than 1 cup mayonaise, omitted the milk and sour cream, and minced fresh onions instead of prepackaged. I also used 1 tbsp white vinegar and a few splashes of white cooking wine instead of white wine vinegar.

I found it very sweet to the taste, so if you are not fond of overly sweet slaw, either decrease sugar to 3 tbsp or add extra lemon and vinegar.

Overall a very good recipe!

Finally a easy recipe for a good cole slaw. I didn't have prepackage slaw. So I sliced my own cabbage very thin and added shredded carrots. Turned out great. I did let it marinate overnight. For a much better taste.

I wasn't unhappy with my old coleslaw recipe, but this one had so many great reviews I just had to try it -- now this is my recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, then decided it needed more dressing, so I made another batch. It was a little bit soupy, next time I'll omit the milk and double the buttermilk.

Delicious!  My husband said it was the best coleslaw he ever tasted, I agree!  I used a half cabbage I had, shredded it finely and added a couple of grated carrots, instead of the package.  I used rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and used the suggestion of milk and vinegar instead of the buttermilk since I didn't have any. I let it chill for 3 hours. Turned out great, the sauce was a little watery, nevertheless the taste makes this a five star recipe.

Well, this recipe sure is an old favorite!  This is definitely the recipe I recommend.  It's both sweet and sour, so just about everyone will love it.  I like to process the coleslaw mix in a food processor until it's chopped finely.  If you don't have any buttermilk, don't let that stop you--simply substitute sour cream, or add a quarter of a tablespoon of vinegar to a quiarter cup of milk and let it sit for five minutes.  Classic!

WONDERFUL RECIPE!!  Made this last night and today I could not stop eating this coleslaw!!  It was very, very good.  I used low fat mayo and it turned out fabulous.  I also added some of the vinegar to skim milk to substitute for the buttermilk.  Thank you for the recipe!

This coleslaw is delicious. It's better if it's been left in the fridge for about two days. I just use shredded cabbage and grated carrots instead of the coleslaw mix and I use apple cider vinger instead of white wine vinegar. In addition, I use evaporated milk instead of butter milk. It still comes out perfectly every time. Everyone loves it!

I am a cole slaw lover and this was very good. Yes, this is a watery sauce but very tasty. Use a slotted spoon and think about all the calories you left in the serving bowl--- that should make you even like this recipe better!

This is the Best Coleslaw hands down. I have made it so many times its very easy and extremly tasty. My husband and my inlaws which aren't coleslaw eaters all eat it. It's very creamy and has the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Being from Maryland Coleslaw is a must next to Hot Steamed Crabs. So I have spent a lot of time finding a good coleslaw recipe and this is a keeper.

This was really good but a little too sweet for my taste.  I will make again with less sugar.  I did add a little celery seed.  I have been looking for a more flavorful cole slaw than mine and I found it.  Thanks for sharing!

Maybe I simply don't like coleslaw - but I didn't like this at all.  I tried it because it really looked like it would be good, and it was certainly easy.  I usually like mayonnaise/vinegar dressings, but I couldn't even finish eating a single serving of this.  Sorry!

I loved this slaw. Did not use any milk at all as I knew it would be too soupy. I also made it in batches so that the coleslaw was crunchy for my BBQ pulled pork sandwiches. While tossing the dressing in with the cabbage mix I would then sprinkle celery seed in to it. I quadrupled this recipe as I was feeding 50.  Perfect amount. Added an extra cup of mayo (Best Foods) to the sauce recipe and it was pertect. As the slaw sat it would juice up which is normal. Glad I didn't use any milk or buttermilk. Will be making this again. Flavor is spot on!

This was very good, especially after it sat overnight.  Next time I may try a bit more sugar as I do like my slaw sweeter.  I did add some celery seed.

Perfect coleslaw! I made my own coleslaw mix but that really didn't add too much time- cabbage/celery/carrot. Great doubled but DO NOT double sugar. 1/3 c is enough even when doubled. I'm glad I tasted before adding any more sugar. Thanks for the recipe! It's a favourite.

I've made this recipe at least 10 times now. I followed another reviewer's advice and substituted sour cream for the milk and buttermilk (it gives the tang of buttermilk).  The sauce is creamy and as it sits, it gets a little more juicy from the cabbage. This is my Go To coleslaw recipe. Oh, instead of grating an onion, I use dehydrated. So much faster. This recipe is best without using light mayo. Please don't substitute Real Lemon juice (in a bottle)it has a bitter undertone.  Use a fresh lemon.  The slaw has a distinct hint of lemon that makes it very fresh tasting.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.

OMG this is the best! Had to substitute lime for lemon. It only made it better! The family loves it the way it is but i am going to cut back on the sugar the next time.

This recipe is easy to make and absolutely "deelish".  I didn't pour all of the dressing mixture on the slaw mix (used about half of it or enough to coat).  Save the remainder if others wanted more on their coleslaw.

Family Favorite!  I have made this both with the pre cut packages and with fresh shredded cabbage, both in double batches and it is amazing both ways. The finish product after sitting in the fridge is very milky and runny, but we like it that way ... I would suggest to someone who doesn't to only mix half of the liquid in and store half to add as needed and also to cut back on the regular milk just a tiny bit.

This was a huge hit. I used 4 bone-in chicken breasts, cooked on low for 6 hours then shredded them an hour before serving. I also used another users suggestion and toasted the bun with olive oil and garlic salt. I didn't have the sweet baby rays honey bbq sauce but I had regular sweet baby rays and added about 2 tbls of honey. I also made a coleslaw to put on top. I will make these again!

left out the vinegar, buttermilk and used pineapple juice in place of the lemon juice. It was delicious and not too liquefied how some people said. Probably because i did not use buttermilk or vinegar.

I made it according to the directions, it was delish!  For a larger batch I would use 2 bags of slaw mix and make 1 1/2 times the dressing.  It was a little runny, but I'd prefer that to having it be dry.  It was a big hit with my family.

This was pretty good, but a tad on the sweet side for me. I'd cut back on the sugar next time. I could also really taste the lemon in it maybe because I used the bottled stuff instead of fresh. Our guest really liked it.

This was good coleslaw. I did find it a bit on the sweet side, but really enjoyed the flavour that the white wine vinegar added. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I'm not satisfied that this is the best coleslaw recipe out there - it is much better than anything store-bought though!

This was fantastic; just like the coleslaw at KFC but without the harsh, chemical bite.  I stuck to the recipe exactly with the exception of shredding my own cabbage and carrots.

Great Recipe! Made this last week based on 4 servings so making it again this week.  Didn't have all ingrediants so made a few substitutions-sorry!  Instead of buttermilk I used TJ's greek honey yogurt, and instead of white wine vinegar used applce cider vinegar.  Also added some golden raisins.  Turned out great!

tried making home made coleslaw many times without much success.. and finally have a recipe that my family raves over.  I've used a bit less sugar but everything else is the same.  Won't make it any other way! Thank you.

Really, really good dressing.  But for me, the veggie portions were off.  I used  a large head of cabbage and 2 large carrots that I shredded - which amounted way more than 16 oz and it was almost perfect for our taste.  I also used half a very large onion and a teaspoon of celery seed.  It was the best home made coleslaw I have made - and I have made a ton from this site!  My honey told me this one was a keeper.

Good recipe.  I changed just a few minor things.  I used Celery Salt in place of reg salt as well as about 1/2 of a red onion.  Definitely needs to chill about 2 hours, longer is better.  I like it and so did my picky family.

At first taste, this seems a bit off, but letting it sit really helps the flavors and textures come together. Love this recipe, but it needs to sit ATLEAST 2 hours!

This recipe deserves 4 stars because it gave me a great starting point for my coleslaw.  Upon reading a lot of reviews I decided the recipe might not be perfect for me so I modified it a little bit.  Hope this is helpful for those of you who prefer a creamier coleslaw (that does not get too watery over time).  I also reduced the recipe to 4 servings. 

The first thing I did a couple hours before I wanted to make the coleslaw was to salt it with table salt to help extract some of the moisture out of the coleslaw (do this in a strainer).  When I was ready to make the coleslaw I patted it dry and put it to the side.  Next I mixed the following ingredients together to make the dressing:  I omitted the onion (optional), and added 1/4 cup mayo, 2 splashes (I eye balled it) of milk, 2 tablespoons of sour cream, 1 teaspoon of white wine vinegar, 1.5-2 teaspoons of lemon juice, ground black pepper, and about 2 tablespoons of sugar (I did not add more salt since I salted the coleslaw in the first step). Feel free to give the dressing a taste and make changes as needed.  Mix the coleslaw and dressing and let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour.  Delicious!

Really delicious, simple coleslaw. Easy to whip up for a summer meal. I definitely like using the shortcut of pre-cut coleslaw... my mix had broccoli, carrots, and red and green cabbage.

Best dressing for coleslaw yet!  I used a head of cabbage run through the Kitchen Aid shredder attachment, so felt the dressing wasn't quite enough. Doubled it, and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a good no-frills coleslaw recipe that doesn’t disappoint.      The only changes I made were to use cabbage and I also added green onions instead of the regular onions.   I did sprinkle the cabbage with the salt and let it sit to draw out the moisture before adding the mixture.

Excellent coleslaw.  Made this for St. Patrick's Day along with Reubens.  This slaw has a nice creamy taste and the leftovers were still good the next day.  Thank you Marsha for submitting this recipe.

Ok my husband will only eat KFC coleslaw until I made this.  However the slaw at KFC is chopped up into very tiny bits.  So it was a true labor of love for me when I decided to cut my cabbage the same way.  The dressing however is perfection. I even used all milk with no buttermilk and it was fantastic.  I think even the Colonel would  be jealous.

I dont use a pre-cut mix.  Cut up a medium head of cabbage and grate a few carrots..cheaper.  This recipe is not too sweet or too vinegary. Great for a summer BBQ.

This is creamy goodness!!!  OMG, this was soooooo good.  I cut the recipe in half though, as it was just the two of us.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I used the half and half I had on hand instead.  I also used white vinegar as I didn't have any white wine vinegar.  I also used red onion which really added a kick to it.  I added salt black pepper, dry mustard and sugar to taste and it was so good.  Next time I will probably add a couple of pinches of cayenne pepper to give it some spice.  This is definitely a keeper.

This has excellent taste!  Most cole slaw dressings are blah, but not this one!  Unfortnately, I didn't have buttermilk on hand, but the vinegar and lemon juice added to milk did the same thing.  I only added as much milk as was called for even without adding the buttermilk.  The consistency was quite good and the dressing had a nice balance of tang! I did presalt the cole slaw, let drain for a good hour, then rinsed and let drain for a while to keep the slaw from becoming too wet.   I used the slaw on top of the barbecued pork sandwiches listed on this site.  I will use this recipe many times (and I'm not a cole slaw fan!). Thanks for a great recipe.

I new right away I would not like the lemon juice so I cut it down to 1tablespoon. I also cut out the milk as suggested because it was too watery. Overall very good, but I did not enjoy the lemon still.

I could only find 12 oz bags, and used 2 bags. I probably didn't adjust the dressing correctly, so that is my fault. Next time I will probably decrease the onion a little. Other than that, I really enjoyed the flavor.

Loved it! I have been looking for this recipe for a long time, and all of the ones that I come across need ingredients that I don't have in the house! I used others suggestions on how to make buttermilk, and it worked out well. I loved the lemony flavor! I had KFC's the other day, and have had a taste for it ever since, I am so glad that I found something so similar!

I added a little more vinegar but that's only because I love vinegar..  This is great as is!  Love this slaw.

This was really good, however, I think you could do without either the milk or the buttermilk.  I did use the packaged slaw because that's what I had but there just seemed to a little too much liquid that settled at the bottom after it sat for a bit.  The flavor was great and I would def make again.

This is the perfect coleslaw recipe!  I've never been a fan of coleslaw, not even from restaurants.  We made corned beef brisket for sandwiches this weekend and had friends and family over.  It was also my first time making corned beef and the only way I liked it was with this coleslaw!  The only thing I did wrong was not double or triple this wonderful recipe.  Everybody loved it and wanted more.  I also considered shredding my own cabbage and carrots b/c I hate bagged salad, it seems to have a strange taste.  But, I was running short on time and just grabbed the coleslaw mix and you couldn't even tell.  I am making this again tonight and can't wait for the next get together.  Fast, convenient and taste fantastic!

I have been meaning to rate this recipe for a long time. I make this exactly as is, but many times double the recipe for cook outs and family events. Everyone loves this recipe and it is super easy. We have been enjoying it all summer long. Thanks!

I got a cabbage in my CSA box and didn't know what to do with it, so I made this - I just chopped the cabbage and grated some carrots instead of using a pre-made salad mix.  I used sour cream instead of the milk and buttermilk.  Also, I used red wine vinegar instead of white wine because that's what I had.  Pretty good with cold roasted chicken.

My family loves this recipe. It has great flavor and is very easy to make. I put the coleslaw in a food processor with the blade in and shredded it fine. It is great and almost melts in your mouth.                  Marge

Excellent! Made this for 4th of July. There weren't ANY leftovers. It does make a lot of dressing but next time I'll just add more cabbage. If you have time, shred your own cabbage. It tastes so much better. Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good recipe, I made it for family cookout and everyone loved it.  only complaint is that the recipe makes too much dressing, cutting the recipe in half would probably be plenty.

Nicely sweet, but not too much so; nicely creamy, too. I made this to put on Carolina-style hot dogs, but I can see it on a pork-and-slaw sandwich, or at any barbecue. Really nice balance of flavors and crunch.

Dang! This is good stuff (and it tastes almost exactly like the REAL thing!)!!! My bf even liked this... WOW! Made a half batch to go with Pulled Pork for Sandwiches by KMB233. I made this around 8 PM the night prior and we had some the following evening (so it sat in the fridge for nearly 24 hours). I used Pearson's homestyle diced coleslaw mix since my local KFC's slaw is also diced, not shredded. To my surprise, the cabbage was still crunchy despite other's warnings about it becoming soggy. I think I'll like this even better after it sits for a few days as I prefer a little less crunch (if it lasts that long - lol!). My only change for next time would be to add a tad more sugar. Other than that, this is pretty much right on! Bravo Marsha :)

This is a nice coleslaw recipe.  My family enjoyed it.  The only change I made was to make my own 16 oz. coleslaw mix by shredding half a head of regular cabbage, a quarter of a head of purple cabbage, and 5 baby carrots.  I made this the night before and it turned out great.

I pretty much made this as written., but I added a little more salt, and a splash more of vinegar. Plus I put about 1/2 a tsp. of celery salt [didn't have seed] a a tsp. of horseradish. Good stuff.

This was just okay. I guess it does taste kind of like the chicken place, but it was kind of weird and lemony and too sweet. I'll keep looking for a keeper.

MMMMM, this stuff is sooo good! And addicting! I could eat the entire thing. I am watching my weight though so i do make a few modifications but it still tastes amazing. I use all fat free milk (no buttermilk), Splenda instead of sugar and i use only 1/3c light mayo. I usually end up using a little more cabbage mix as well. YUMMY! Great way to get in a few veggie servings!

WOW!!!  I always get rave reviews when I make this.  I had little old ladies begging for the recipe.  To get the extra water out of the cabbage wilt it using salt and allow to drain in a colander for a few hours.  There is too much dressing so don't pour all on it at once until you have mixed it up and determined if you have enough.

excellant dressing. the first time i made it, it was a little runny, due to the fact we only have 1% milk in our house. the next time i used 1/2 and 1/2 coffee cream and it turned out perfectly.

Just like KFC!  Instead of the bagged mix, I just chopped up two heads of cabbage (minus the cores) and a large carrot as fine as I could and then doubled the sauce part.  Went very well with BBQ pork sandwiches (from the crock pot).

This is pretty good although I really thought it could use some more zip.  Next time I think I'll decrease the sugar a bit and add a little more vinegar...maybe some horseradish too.

Great coleslaw.  Tasty and easy to make. One note: I chopped one head of cabbage.  The amount was fine, but I would shred the cabbage next time.

I will use this recipe for many years to come.  I loved the flavor of the dressing; it's perfect.  I did think there was more dressing than needed for the 16 oz. bag of cole slaw.  I might omit the 1/4 c. of regular milk to cut down and also thicken up the dressing.  Next time, I'll add celery seed (I love that at restaurants).  Thanks so much for this keeper!

I made this for the first time yesterday for a family dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, and everyone loved it. It had wonderful taste and reminded me of my favorite restaurant coleslaw. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is a good basic recipe but it needs a few things. I added a few pinches of celery seed, a squirt of deli mustard, some chopped fresh parsley [this is a must] and some chopped red pepper. It was really delicious and colorful.

I am so picky about eating coleslaw but I loved it after trying it...Tasted very close to KFC's coleslaw. I didn't have any lemon juice so I just left it out. Yummy!!!

Pretty good, made as directed but we felt it was missing something but not sure what.  Goes together easily and quickly and we used it on barbecue sandwiches. I think served alone as a side dish I would have had to tweak it a bit. Coleslaw is a highly personal taste though! Thanks for posting!

Perfect slaw!  I used splenda instead of sugar and omitted the buttermilk (i didn't have any).  I mixed everything together as directed but added a little more milk to obtain the right consistency since I didn't have buttermilk.  It worked perfectly!

I made this the first time and the taste was great; however, there was way too much liquid at the bottom of the bowl. I made it again for a family dinner a few days later and left out the milk. The taste was fantastic and the liquid consistancy was perfect!! Best coleslaw ever in my opinion!

Made this for a cook out side dish. Great coleslaw. I didn't have white wine vinegar or buttermilk so I used balsamic vinegar and regular milk. It was still delicious and everyone loved it.

I tweaked the recipe just a bit and it still turned out amazing! Instead of raw onion I just added a little sprinkle of dried onion flakes and used Onion salt instead of regular salt. Also, I found the longer you leave in the fridge the better. I made some for a party and there was a bit leftover so I had itwith lunch the next day and it was so much better the day after!

The taste was great but there was way to much dressing for the amount of coldeslaw. I had to drain some off. Next time I'll cut the dressing ingrediants in half or add another bag of slaw.

Excellent Slaw, just like my favorite KFC salad.  I don't understand the complaints about the soupy consistancy...that's the way its supposed to be!  Make this, you won't be sorry.

I used apple cider vinegar.  I also added about a tablespoon of dijon mustard and a half a teaspoon of celery seed.  This was a really good recipe.  The only problem I had was after sitting in the fridge for a couple of hours, it became very watery.  I had to soak up some of the water with paper towels before serving it.  Otherwise, a fantastic recipe.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this didn't turn out as good as I was expecting. I didn't have any onion or white wine vinegar, so I used a little onion powder and some regular white wine. I honestly don't think that was the problem though, because the reason I disliked the taste was that I found it much too sweet. If I ever make this recipe again, I think I'll leave out the sugar entirely.

This was pretty good.... on the first day. I don't recommend using onion (although it tastes good on the day you make it) because by the next day it becomes way too strong and over powering. I'm very picky about cole slaw, but this one I will make again.

I was excited to try this recipe, and I liked the first bites, but in the end, I didn't really care for the coleslaw.  It was too watery, and the taste wasn't right for me.  I think it had too much sugar for my taste, but even then, soemthing wasn't quite right.

I made this the other night as a side dish for dinner and we thought it was ok - but the dressing was very thin.  We prefer a bit of a thicker dressing, so if we make this again, we may tweak the dressing a bit to more suit our taste.

really good. it probably makes too much sauce, and oftentimes i don't have buttermilk for it, but it's always good. it's crucial to let it sit for a few hours before serving. eating raw cabbage has gotta be healthy.

Very good, I used red wine vinegar since I didn't have white and it was fine.  The buttermilk is a great, tangy addition and was enough liquid without needing the extra regular milk.  I also find shallots imparts a nicer, mellower flavor than onions.

Does taste just like the cole slaw from that famous fast food chicken joint. Doubled the sauce recipe because it was just too good.  Made the dressing the night before adding vegetables, so  sauce ingredients could blend together.
Next morning, I shredded a head of green cabbage, 1/3 head of red cabbage, a carrot and a little bit of green pepper and mixed with cole slaw dressing.  I did not use the 1/4 cup of milk and it was not missed. Probably would of made dressing too runny.
This is a fabulous dressing!

Made this today since Ive been craving coleslaw but hate to drive across town just to buy some at the chicken joint. This recipe is so close to the taste of it I can now make my own coleslaw at home. I made two tiny changes to my taste but thanks for the basic recipe to use. I just hope I can wait a few more hours till I serve this for dinner with out picking at it some more. This is a 5 star recipe thanks Marsha

Wow!  This tastes just like KFC's coleslaw.  The trick is to chop the cabbage just like KFC and to chill the slaw well before serving it.  I have made this numerous times since printing it 4/2006.  I have even made it w/ equal to cut down on calories.

I've made this many times for picnics, BBQs, etc.  It's always very well received.  I'm asked for the recipe whenever I bring it somewhere.  People often note how similar it tastes to that famous fried chicken chain's coleslaw!  My only change is to use half of the minced onion.  The full amount is a bit much for my family's tastes.

This is very good. I  used light mayonaise (Hellman's) and this came out really well - didn't taste "light" at all, so I can imagine how it would taste with full-fat mayo. I also omitted the regular milk and added a little extra mayo and buttermilk (maybe one tablespoon extra of mayo). After letting it sit for a couple hours, the amount of liquid increased, so I think I'll definitely leave out the regular milk in the future. The only other adjustment that I made was that I used a little less sugar, but that's just the way I like cole slaw and added a couple drops of hot sauce. Also, this definitely gets better after it sits for a while. I found that I liked it best the next day. I used this on homemade pulled pork sandwiches (recipe on this site) and they came out SO good! This was the perfect cole slaw to compliment the pulled pork, vinegar, and hot sauce sandwiches. This was also really good to eat on its own. I will definitely make this again, it was SO easy, too! Thank you for the recipe.

I never knew I could make cole slaw so good at home!  I used grated red onion and it gave it just the right amount of kick!  I served it with BBQ brisket and I can hardly wait to have the leftovers on a brisket sandwich for lunch!

Hmm...don't know where I went wrong with this one.  The picture has carrots in the coleslaw - I got cole slaw mix but it was just cabbage?  Maybe that's what it is.  It is definitely missing something.  Perhaps I should have put all of the sugar called for instead of only 1/4 cup?  It has potential but I was disappointed.  10/16/06: I'm editing this because I decided to put more sugar in it which made it better.  My boyfriend swears that there isn't any onion in the KFC coleslaw and he refused to eat it because he immediately tasted the minced onion.  I think it's great though.  Changing this to a 5 from a 3.

Ok, it has been about two months and my boyfriend is still asking for me to make this again.  The taste rivals that of the "fried chicken" chain and it is soooo good!  If you like coleslaw, you will love this recipe. Made exactly as written!

This is a great cole slaw recipe.  I found the texture perfect - not too creamy and not too soupy.  I did cut back on the sugar and only put a fourth a cup.  I also added about a half teaspoon of celery seed and it turned out perfect.  Will definately be making again.

Made this earlier today for our evening cookout. This was delicious! After reading previous reviews, I decided to cut back on the liquids, milk, buttermilk, vinegar and lemon juice; each. This really worked out well. It was still a tad "soupy" but not bad. I just stirred and then served with a slotted spoon. Excellent "tang" taste and I am glad that I gave the dish time for the flavors to meld. Thanks for a great recipe!

My boyfriend said this one is a keeper.  I did make a few changes according to his tastes, though.  I added more sugar, plus green onions.  Also, I snipped the coleslaw mix into smaller pieces with scissors, which made it even more similar to restaurant-style slaw, I am told.

My husband and four year old son love this; I like it enough to keep making it, but it's not really what I'm looking for.  I made it using sour cream as another reader suggested.  It's tangy, which I like, but it's really sweet.

We are Cole Slaw freaks and have been looking for just "the right" combo of ingredients.  This is it!  Nice and creamy, not too sweet.  Didn't have buttermilk, so used sour cream in its place and probably a little more than 2 T. of onion but that's how we like it.  This was THE recipe we've been looking for.  Will make only this one from now on.  It was perfect.  Thanks!!!

This was wonderful. Coleslaw is like potato salad to me. Very rarely is it good when buying it out, either at a deli or restaurant. And I don't like those packets that you get at the grocery store. I left a lot out, only because we don't like a lot of stuff in our coleslaw. I only put in about 1/2T onion, a little salt, no milk, vinegar, or lemon juice. I used the substitute for the buttermilk with lemon juice in it. It was perfect for us, and my husband loved it. Thanks!

I made this to go over and/or with BBQ Beef Sandwiches on Superbowl Sunday.  Unfortunately, I forgot to take it out of the refrigerator until the night was over.  But everyone taste tested it and took some home with them.  A few days later I was receiving rave reviews and my father (who doesn't cook) asked for the recipe!

This is the BEST cole coleslaw ever! I've made it twice now and both times it was fantastic. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, but added some finely diced jalepeno to half the recipe (for a little kick for my husband) and both versions were out of this world. The second time, I only had about half the sugar and no lemons but it was still terrific, altough, the lemon does really add to the flavor. Thanks for the great recipe, I had been looking for one for years!

Fabulous! I don't need to say another thing, but I will. Simply fabulous. THE coleslaw recipe. I made it to serve with "Original Homemade Italian Beef" sandwichesfrom this site. The beef isn't done yet, but the slaw is outstanding.

Fantastic.  Tastes just like the Colonel's used to.  I didn't have fresh onion, so I substituted 1-1/2 Tbsp. dried minced onion soak in 2 Tbsp. of water.

Made recipe exactly as instructed and received many compliments. I agree that it's a bit "soupy" but the flavor is perfect.  Will add to my list of "favorites."

Excellent!  Tastes just like KFC's.  The only thing I did differently was use red wine vinegar since that's all I had on hand.

Outstanding! The ONLY way cole slaw should be made, according to my family! I bought the prepackaged slaw mix and ran it through the food processor a tad bit just to get it minced a little better. I used buttermilk throughout the entire recipe rather than plain milk. Delicious!

Always a crowd pleaser.  It's better if chilled 3-4 hours before serving.  Also, it gets a little "runny" so I try to empty most of the liquid prior to serving.

I stopped eating coleslaw since I had a hard time finding one that actually taste good.  This recipe was easy to make and had an awesome taste.  I followed the advice of others at this site and used  3/4 c of Miracle Whip.
Yummy!!!!

This was great coleslaw.  I did serve with  a slotted spoon to avoid excess sauce from going onto the plates.  We served it with pulled pork sandwiches, and everyone loved it. I accidentally left out the onion, but most people appreciated that fact.

This was EXACTLY what I wanted it to be!  I didn't use the onion, and I just used 1/2 cup NF milk instead of buttermilk. I also substituted English Style Malt Vinegar.

Awesome.  Make this in the morning and it's perfect for dinner that night.  I add a little less than the 1/3 c sugar and about 1/2 tsp celery seed.  Best recipe for coleslaw I've found.

Made this last night. My husband & I really enjoyed it, but next time I will cut the amount of sugar in 1/2-it was a little too sweet for my taste. I think with less sugar it would be PERFECT!!

I have finally found a great coleslaw recipe!  I first made this with Miracle Whip Salad Dressing substituted for mayo and sour cream substituted for buttermilk.  It was disappointing so I bought the mayo and buttermilk and it was great.  I think the most important thing is to use mayo, not salad dressing.

This was great. I didnt have buttermilk; I used n/f sour cream instead and it turned out great.  My husband thought it was great.  I thought it was a little sweet, so I might cut back the sugar next time.  I will definitely make it again.  Oh, and I thought it made plenty of dressing.

This has become our new family recipe for coleslaw.  I use freshly chopped cabbage instead of the packaged stuff.  Red cabbage is a nice addition for even better nutritional benefits.  I usually add chopped carrots too.  It has such a delicious flavor and will keep for a few days in the refrigerator.

Excellent recipe!  We prefer Cole Slaw to be less sweet, so just added 1/4 cup of sugar. Perfect!  Thanks for a great salad, Marsha!

Easy and delicious!  I didn't have buttermilk so I used plain yogurt and it was great.  (I often do this as a buttermilk substitute.)  I also added thinly sliced red bell pepper.

I don't usually like cole slaw at all, but I was making ribs and having guests over so I wanted to make some.  THIS WAS SO GOOD!  Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again!

I have finally found a coleslaw recipe that my husband will eat.  I also substituted yogurt and sour cream for the mayonnaise last time I made it, because I didn't have enough mayo.  It was just as delicious.

This was delicous!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and mixed milk with lemon juice instead of buttermilk and used splenda instead of sugar and this came out great!

Good.  I used a slotted spoon to serve, because there is too much sauce.  Next time I will definitely prepare this about 3 to 5 hours ahead of time, 1 hour is not enough to let the sauce soak up into the cabbage.  I used rice white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because that was all I had on hand and it tasted fine.

Good! I made this using Miracle Whip and rice wine vinegar in place of mayo and white wine vinegar. I also left out the buttermilk. I made a smaller batch for the smaller amount of coleslaw mix that I had. It was pretty good, maybe a tad too sweet. I added a little more vinegar than called for. I love coleslaw- will make again. Very easy.

I used Splenda instead of the sugar and 1/4 c nonfat sour cream with 1/4 cup mayo instead of the 1/2 cup of mayo called for in the recipe.  I shredded my own cabbage,carrots and onion for the mix part. This is the very best coleslaw dressing recipe I've found and I've been looking for a good one for 30 years!  Thanks be to Marsha!!!!

my family loved this! amazingly well-balanced flavor rivals a NYC deli. A bit much dressing for a single bag of coleslaw especially if you let the finished product sit - next time I will buy a second bag and mix some extra in right before serving to add a little crunch and pick up the extra dressing. BTW, I left out the buttermilk and it was still terrific! Enjoy!

This is by far....the very best coleslaw I have ever had! It was rich and creamy. I only used a 10 oz package of coleslaw and I did not find it to be runny...at all. I honestly could have sat there and ate the entire bowl....it was that good. Only problem is....hubby wanted the left overs for lunch today :( Good excuse to make it again really soon. You have a winner on your hands Marsha....thank you!

This is it---THE coleslaw recipe I've been looking for.  Other than cutting the dressing in half, I didn't - and wouldn't -  change a thing.  It's perfect!  I no longer need to drive thru KFC to have GREAT coleslaw at home.

THis was an EXCELLENT recipe with one huge change:  I would DOUBLE the package of coleslaw mix (cabbage).  It had a great taste, but there was just WAY too much dressing.  You could easily half the recipe for the dressing or double the amount of coleslaw mix.  Very good, though.

This recipe is easy and I like the slightly sweet taste. I used the exact recipe but put the whole pkg of coleslaw mix in my processor to cut the shredded cabbage into smaller pieces. I will search no more for the perfect coleslaw. Thank you Marsha.

Tastes EXACTLY like what you would get at the deli. I couldn't believe how good this coleslaw was. I added more buttermilk simply because I love cooking with buttermilk, but I couldn't believe I had actually made coleslaw that tastes just as good, if not better, than restaurant coleslaw. PERFECT!

Excellent coleslaw recipe Marsha!!  I made a triple batch of this for a party and it turned out GREAT!  I substituted regular white vinegar for white wine vinegar and used 2 parts mayo 1 part miracle whip and it turned out wonderful.  (I ran out of mayo and had to finish with mircle whip.)  It was a little runny, but the flavor was wonderful so that didn't even matter!  Thanks for a great recipe.  This one is a definate keeper!

Excellent recipe.  But, since I don't like sweet cole slaw, I used about half the sugar.  Served it at a BBQ and everyone liked it.  Just right!

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. This was great. I took another reviewers advice and bought the powdered buttermilk. My husband thought the coleslaw tasted better the second day after the ingredients had a day to marinate. My search for the perfect coleslaw recipe is over. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Like many others, I have been looking for a creamy coleslaw with more flavor than KFC.  I really liked this.  I used 1/2 cabbage and 1/2 broccoli/carrot/redcabbage slaw in the produce department.  Also added diced red pepper for more color.  I liked it very much and will try some celery salt next time.

Yummy.  I thought I followed this recipe to a "T"; well almost, I added about 1 tsp of celery seeds and I noticed today that I forgot the lemon juice. My husband and I thought this was BETTER than what you would get in a restaurant.  Thanks Marsha!

This is really good coleslaw, but I felt like it needed something. I added some hot sauce to give it a little kick and that helped. I wonder if a cider vinegar might also help.

This is a great recipe.  Because I was reducing it greatly to just make one recipe of slaw, I started by using 1 part mayo and 1 part milk (I also didn't have buttermilk).  Then I added the sugar, salt, and vinegar to get the right taste for me.  I didn't have lemon, either, but the white wine vinegar worked great.  Finally I have a coleslaw recipe I can enjoy!  Thanks, Marsha

I have 3 or 4 coleslaw recipes that I switch back and forth between, but this is by far the most delicious and the new favorite.  I mixed red cabbage into the green, didn't have white wine vinegar so substituted rice vinegar, and used a red onion and a little bit of shallot. Very very tasty and it didn't last long - probably better to double the recipe next time.

This was excellent.  I added a teaspoon of celery seed...a common addition to cole slaw, and it added to the flavor. I agree with other reviewers that it ends up with too much liquid, so I added extra cabbage mix.

This is the best cole slaw. It's so easy to make, too. I'm really not a cole slaw  person, but maybe I am now! My hubby is a cole slaw  eater & says it's the best he's ever had.

Really good coleslaw.  I used apple cider vinegar because that is what I had on hand -- and that's what I use in my own coleslaw recipe.  This is quite good.

Tastes just like my favorite restaurant coleslaw.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will experiment with the white wine vinegar and lemon juice amounts to get just the right amount of tang for us, but I could make it exactly per recipe directions and we would always think it's the best.  Wonderful!

I made this for guests, and they raved the best coleslaw ever.  I personally would decrease amount of sugar.  I also substituted  half splenda for sugar, so that may have been the reason for sweetness.  This will be my new permanent go to recipe for slaw!

This is the BEST cole slaw recipe out there! Even my cole slaw  conisuer  husband says so! I have made it 3 times in one month because we can't get enough. I did cut back on the sugar to 1/4 and added 2 Tablespoons of the vinegar. Thanks for sharing!

This is excellent.  I like a soupy coleslaw, so I always add just a little more milk but other than that, this is very tasty.  I also sub the white wine vinegar for regular white vinegar mostly because that's what I have on hand and it adds the right amount of tang.

Made this for our Memorial Day cookout. They loved it. 
I would cut down on the liquid slightly.

I used green onions, added Dijon mustard and minced red pepper. I also cut down the sugar to probably 1/6 - 1/4 cup. Deleted the lemon juice. So delicious!

Excellent dressing. I didn't have buttermilk, but it still tasted really good.  I would use the dressing for other salads.

Excellent slaw!!!   Growing up, the slaw served at home was always on the sweet side.  It's just my preference, but an onion  basted salad is more to my liking.  This is the absolute closest to KFC slaw I've every had and really, really like it.  No changes, just plain enjoyment!

I made this using the suggestion of creating buttermilk by taking 1/2 cup regular milk and mixing it with 2 Tablespoons  vinegar and 3 tablespoons lemon juice.  The dressing was so good but I only used half of it to keep it from being runny.  I also used frozen chopped onion and that worked out well.

That’s exactly EXACTLY like KFC’s cole slaw in everything; consistency, color, taste, EVERYTHING . I put it in the fridge for less than an hour and it still came out with that special cabbage water we all love. I was amazed when I tasted it, I’ve been tryna make a copycat of KFC’s coke slaw for a while and only this recipe worked with me. Thank you AllRecipes. I trust you and that’s the first time I write a review here

I shredded my own cabbage and used shredded carrots. It was a hit! After I shredded the cabbage I salted the cabbage and let it sit for 20 minutes to get rid of some of the water and it was less liquidy than the last time I made it.

Followed recipe and everyone seemed to like.  Let marinate for several hours before served which brought water out of cabbage so needed to drain off liquid before serving. 
When make again would leave out onion, over powering,  and cut sugar just a little....need some to counter acid of buttermilk and lemon.

This was a great recipe. I like how you control the sweetness yourself and gave a lot of crunch

Made as written, but reduced sugar per other cooks. I've always had to add salt to cole slaw, because it is usually too sweet. The second time I made it I replaced the milk with sour creme to get rid of liquid at bottom. It was slightly more tangy and perfect for me.

Pardon my french, but f*** kfc coleslaw, I'll be using this from now on. I stopped eating there awhile ago, but missed their version. I won't miss it anymore. The only thing different I did was use fresh cabbage and carrots. I don't like using packaged stuffs. It's really amazing.

I made this salad using  1/4 cup of white sugar, 1/4 cup milk and no buttermilk.  All the other ingredients were as written.  I made it 3 hrs beforehand and refrigerated it.  The consistency was excellent.  My church friends enjoyed it on their pulled pork sandwiches.  My husband loved it the next day.  It did not get runny at all.

This is my first negative review and recognize it may just be a matter of taste.  Maybe this should be called "Cold Sweet & Sour Cabbage Soup?"  I think the problem is that there was too much acidic (lemon juice, vinegar) and it doesn't work to offset the sour with buckets of sugar.  Additionally, it was soupy before the cabbage broke down down due to the volume of liquids, including milk & buttermilk.  It was very sweet.  It was very tart.  It was very soupy.  I think the recipe would need reworked completely to overcome the issues.

We've used this recipe quite frequently for coleslaw.  We use all buttermilk as suggested by an earlier reviewer.  We also only use half the amount of sugar called for.

The cole slaw turned out great. Changes I made - used half the sugar the recipe called for, used more buttermilk and less milk. Next time I will use all buttermilk and skip adding the regular milk. I also added a bit more mayonnaise since some of the reviews mentioned the sauce being too soupy.  The cole slaw wasn't runny at all, even after a couple of days the consistency held up fine.  I also added  celery seed.

This is awesome coleslaw!  I had to make a couple of adjustments, due to a lack of ingredients.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I left that out.  I went a little further with the onions, b/c I like onions so well.  I also used regular white vinegar.  Wow, is this good!

A simple recipe that is delicious.  I got adventurous and shredded my own cabbage and carrots.  I didn't have buttermilk so used the tip on making your own (adding white wine vinegar to milk and let it sit) and that worked out well.  However having said that I want to try using buttermilk next time to see if there is a difference.  I liked the idea of going all buttermilk vs using half milk and half buttermilk.
Will definitely make again maybe getting adventurous with some raisins or walnuts or celery seeds

This is a great, simple slaw recipe. I 86 the milk because it makes the dressing too running for my taste - I like the dressing to have a little "stick" to the cabbage and onion mix.

Goes great with smoked meat!!

I was trying to use up the leftover cabbage I had in my fridge from St Patrick's Day so I decided to give this a shot. For the "coleslaw mix" I used half a cabbage, three carrots, and an apple. I didn't add any onion and omitted the sugar, with the hope that the apple would add natural sweetness. It turned out wonderfully! It had a nice tang and the mixture of vegetables was delicious. This will be my go-to recipe for coleslaw from now on.

Sorry my last review was not finished. It made too much dressing for the cabbage, but the the flavor was excellent! Next time I'll add the dressing just before serving. Also I made finely  diced cabbage. Like my wife's favorite fried chicken restaurant. Recommended!

very delicious and I love coleslaw, among the best I've had before. I didn't use the store bought mix, I doubled the cabbage, cut it and the carrots up thicker than usual. Added cucumbers, I doubled the mayonnaise, didn't have the buttermilk, but that's easy to substitute for, next time I  would decrease the sugar

Quick and easy to make.  I did make very small change, less sugar (1 tbsp) and more real lemon juice, (2 oz).  By far best coleslaw I have made, thanks for receive. Even better next day.

Used stevia instead of sugar (half as much) . Added some celery salt to taste. Used regular skim milk instead of buttermilk. Trying to cut out some calories but this is a great recipe!

Very good.  I also threw in some unsalted peanuts I was trying to get rid of and they added a nice crunch.

This cole slaw recipe was very good! The only thing I did differently was I didn't have buttermilk but it turned out great. I would make this again!

I love coleslaw, but am often disappointed in restaurant or homemade coleslaw recipes. This recipe is great! Also, super easy to make. Best to make 1-2 days ahead of time to bring all the flavors together.

This is my GO-TO coleslaw! I love love love this recipe. I typically put the pre-made coleslaw mix in my Ninja and mince it down to taste more like "that restaurant chain's coleslaw."  The only change I make is every so often I will switch out the white wine vinegar for ACV. Depends on how tangy I want it, but the recipe itself, just like it is, is DIVINE...

My finicky adult children wanted a restaurant style coleslaw and this was perfect.  Not too sweet and not too tangy but it can be adjusted to any taste. Its the beginning of a beautiful relationship!

This is a great recipe.  I usually used the Maires coleslaw mix for my slaw. Never again... I did add 
3-4 grated carrots to the 16oz closelaw  mix. For more color .  Excelkent   recipe . It's a keeper. No more bought  dressing.

5.28.16  Didn't use packaged slaw mix, just cut up some cabbage and carrots (really cheap this way).  I skipped the milk, just used buttermilk, and cut back on the sugar a bit (personal taste).  Good topper on some BBQ sandwiches.

Made a couple of changes bc of the  way our family eats. I added a little less sugar and rather than buttermilk, I used plain low-fat yogurt with some skimmed milk added to make it smoother.  And Marsha is right! This is just like the take-out kind!

I've made this a number of times, sometimes using buttermilk and sometimes souring my own milk. It always gets compliments. I have added an extra bag of coleslaw mix because there is so much dressing which is noticeable after it sits for a couple of hours.

Very easy and very good recipe!  Like most of us,  I try to make it my own.  I add minced garlic,  garlic powder and adobo seasoning to give it a little more flavor.  This recipe is like a good soup or chili.  The longer it sits,  the better it gets.

Made this for a soul food pot luck at work....it was a hit!  My husband love it too.  I doubled the recipe and it worked just great. Not too much onion or pepper, but enough for flavor.  I will be keeping this in my tool box.

I used 2 pretty good size heads of cabbage instead of precut shreds. This was maybe a little too much cabbage for the amount of dressing made. so maybe if you're using fresh cabbage use 1 1/2 heads of cabbage. Mine wasn't soupy. I made it early in the morning so it could marinate all day. This had a really good taste to it! Everyone at our church dinner enjoyed it. Will surely be making this again and again.

I always hated coleslaw,  except for KFC's. This recipe is always a huge hit,  even with my kids and my nieces and nephews.  I make it pretty much the same, except instead of using white vinegar,  I use tarragon vinegar.  I think it's pretty easy to find,  since I found it at Fry's. Pretty sure Kroger would carry it as well.  The tarragon vinegar really makes the difference in making it taste like true KFC coleslaw.

I love this recipe! I get compliments every time. I use some alterations: I dice an apple instead of the onion, I substitute apple cider vinegar for white vinegar, and I eliminate the buttermilk completely. It has a sweeter taste, and is less liquid-y like most people on comments dislike.

I halved the recipe using half a bag of shredded cabbage. I took the recommendations of many and halved the sugar, and it was a good call. I also added one shredded carrot, and a little celery seed and garlic powder. Since I didn't have buttermilk, I added extra milk. Seems very good now, but I'm sure it will be better after it stands a bit. It is really better than some of the store-bought stuff.

I don't usually like coleslaw but this is the exception. I did cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and used champagne vinegar instead. I've gotten many complements. Thank you for making me look like a slaw aficionado!

Excellent! I have tried many recipes trying to avoid the load of mayo. And finally... this one is IT! The dressing has the right balance of sweetness and tartness. As another reviewer did, I mixed it with the cabbage at the time of serving, and it's just right. Approved by my youngest son who only likes the coleslaw from Popeye's. Thank you so much for sharing Marsha.

I love this recipe! I add celery seed and celery salt instead of regular salt. I also add poppy seeds and all buttermilk, not a combination of milk and buttermilk. No more store bought dressings for me!

Made with a 10 oz bag of coleslaw because that's what I had and just poured off the bit of extra sauce. This is super easy and the best coleslaw I've ever made

I never made coleslaw before, although I love it.  This was delicious and so easy to throw together!  Next time I think I will buy a finer shred of coleslaw mix or use my food processor to make the cabbage slices finer.  But the dressing was the perfect combination of sweet and tangy for our taste.

Very simple and quick -exactly what I was looking for. I followed the recipe exactly except I shredded my own cabbage and carrots.  This one got the hubby's stamp of approval.

This is very tasty. I skipped the buttermilk altogether I don't like the slaw to be watery.  I watch the milk I add less the 1/4 cup because you will find that once everything settles it will be creamy enough. I always try recipes a couple of times if I like them. This is one way of making the recipe to fit your taste.

This is a really great recipe, but what really makes it perfect is a couple of spoonfuls (to taste) of prepared horseradish. I usually use about two soup spoons worth. Horseradish gives it that bite that makes that popular restaurant coleslaw we all love so great. I also just use the buttermilk and leave out the milk. It doesn't need it. Thanks for a great place to start Marsha!

I was looking for a way to use up a half head if cabbage.  So I finely shredded the cabbage and added diced carrots.  Then followed the remainder of the recipe.  Very good !

I tried it and loved it!   It's the first coleslaw dressing that I've ever liked!   I'm not a fan of sugar but have to admit that in this recipe it works.   This will be my "go-to" coleslaw recipe from now on.  Way to go, Marsha! - Suzie Smith, Oneonta, AL

Let me preface this by saying I hate coleslaw. At least I thought I did and so did one of the guests I served this to. But my goodness, this is a killer recipe! I omitted the onions because this recipe was to be served over Slow Cooker Pulled Pork with thinly sliced onions as an additional optional topping. I also thought it'd be safer for my picky kids. My eldest ate it straight out of the bowl, just couldn't get enough of it. Heck, even I ate it straight from the bowl! Yes, the recipe is runny but just use tongs to serve and you're fine.

Perfect! I'm not a coleslaw fan but I made this for my husband and sister who both love their coleslaw and I was so surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Everyone who ate it raved about it. It's the best coleslaw I've ever eaten. It's not too sweet, not to tart, not to mayonnaise-y. It's a keeper!

This recipe was delicious! Made it twice this weekend, for two different parties. The first time, I subbed the sugar with truvia (less than 1/4 c.) - it was a bit too sweet. The second time, I left it out altogether, and it was fantastic!! Fresh and vinegary - it was a hit with everyone! I agree with other posters that you can cut down on the amount of dressing, maybe next time I will double the cole slaw and onion mix! I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks!

Have to say, this is one of my favorite coleslaw recipes.
It's so quick and tasty, it's a great side dish for any table.
The only thing I changed was (only added half the sugar recommended).
A must try!!!!!!!

In response to the soupy coleslaw problem I have found that dry buttermilk is a better alternative. Instead of a 1/4 cup wet, dry still gives it its flavor but mixes with the mayo and milk to give a good coating to the cabbage.

LOVE this coleslaw!!! After reading several reviews, I added 1 Tbsp celery seed, 1/2 t. dry mustard and used all buttermilk instead of adding milk. I also sweetened it with Splenda.

At the suggestion of my niece, I made this particular cole slaw dressing to go along with some BBQ ribs.  It was delicious!  My guests loved it, too.  My niece suggested that I just add a little milk at a time to avoid having too much liquid in the salad.  I added the 1/4 cup buttermilk but eliminated the 1/4 cup milk entirely.  It still had extra liquid, but that was easily drained by serving with a slotted spoon.  I also added a teaspoon of celery seed and substituted a shallot for onion.  Yummy.  This recipe is a keeper and the only one I will use for my cole slaw in the future.

This really is a fantastic cole slaw recipe.  It's easy and my go-to recipe.  I follow exactly as written but do make my own buttermilk by adding white vinegar to regular milk.

I have to agree 1/3 Cup is too much sugar. 1-2 teaspoons should be enough, sweeten it to your liking if you use less vinegar, you do not need all that sugar. I have been making my own coleslaw for about 35 years. I use mayo with a little sour cream, no buttermilk or lemon. The KFC and most grocery store coleslaws have High Fructose Corn Syrup in them- I have not eaten that slaw since the 70s but at least they used sugar then and not HFCS. You can even see the syrupy texture in some of the store bought slaw. Yuck. This is a very good recipe, a little too sweet but it is still very good even if you do not have the buttermilk or lemon on hand...thanks for sharing this recipe

Normally restaurant-style coleslaw is way to sweet for our tastes, but this is a must on this site's Southern Pulled Pork Sandwiches.  The combination is sooo much better than restaurants!  I'm so glad I found this recipe.

This is okay...not quite what I was looking for.  Left out the onion; didn't have (or make) buttermilk.  Mis-read the measurement for the lemon juice; used teaspoons instead of tablespoons.  The flavor was okay but I think next time I will use more vinegar or less sugar.  Reading the 'most helpful' review by Aspiring Chef Rita:  "by the way - the longer your coleslaw sits the runnier it will get because the cabbage leaks out water when it is mixed with the dressing - which is a good thing - you are getting the taste of cabbage. The longer it sits the more flavorful it becomes "  and trying to figure out the science of coleslaw, I wonder why use that much milk/buttermilk?  Seems this would make the dressing thinner.  What does the milk add?

Excellent!  Used green onion in this slaw....I highly recommend that you make this the day before serving because it let's the slaw wilt and all flavors come together .....will make a double batch next time since my family inhaled this tonight. Served with grilled marinated turkey tenderloins. One last note: I used low fat mayo and skim milk and this was still creamy good.

One of my top 5 favorite cole slaws to make. I always forget to remember to add extra buttermilk and lessen the milk, though. The extra buttermilk makes it that much better, in my opinion.

This is a great slaw.  I made it for Easter last year and people were telling me it was like their mom made, etc.  It was a real hit and very easy. Thank you Marsha I've been looking for a good coleslaw recipe.

I've never liked coleslaw until I tried this one.  I had a party and a friend brought this over.  It was such a hit.  I wish I had been able to claim I made it - next time I will!

Really delicious. I took this to a pot-luck and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe which was the right amount for a medium-size head of cabbage. I eliminated the milk, but did use the buttermilk.

Tweaked it a little based on the recommendations of another reviewer - eliminated the milk and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup...DELICIOUS! Creamy, but still nice and tangy...an ideal combination. In fact it was so good I served it at a tree trimming party for 60 today and people were begging for the recipe! And, unfortunately, there was nothing left over for me to bring home...

This was my first attempt at homemade coleslaw. I followed the recipe exactly except for having to make my own buttermilk (milk + vinegar). I accidently poured too much buttermilk (double what the recipe called for) so although my coleslaw was a little tangier than it probably shouldve been, it was still good.  I would definitely make it again - taking more care with the buttermilk.

This is a really good coleslaw. I leave out the 1/4 cup of regular milk though. Tends to be too watery with it. Just a personal preference.  :o)

Very tasty! I also used less sugar (only 1/4 cup)  but followed everything else exactly and the result was perfect! This was my first time making coleslaw but will definitely not be my last with this recipe:)

I really like this.  I used closer to a half a cup of vadalia onion.  But, I love onions.  If you don't buy the coleslaw mix with carrots, you might consider adding carrots, too.

I made this coleslaw for a 4th of July BBQ and it was awesome.  A real keeper.  I did cut the sugar to a little more than half of the 1/3 cup required, and I thought it was just right.  Everyone loved it.  Next time, I will double the recipe, as it went really fast.

This is my new coleslaw recipe.  I loved it and so did my husband.  I added a half a teaspoon of dry mustard but other than that I followed the recipe.   I disagree with the reviewer who said cole slaw benefits from sitting up a few days.  Slaw gets slimy as it ages.   I used to work at KFC and whenever the manager made fresh cole slaw we would all eat it.   I can't speak for all cole slaw recipes but I have lived in the south my whole life where slaw is served fresh.

I'm giving this a 4, because of a change.  I didn't have white wine vingar, so I used apple juice.  Once it was all mixed together, I tried and it was sweet.  I let it chill for 5 or 6 hours and it was great.  We loved it.  The falvors got all marry and blended in very well.  It is a keeper!!!

Delicious and I used rice wine vinegar, still came out great.  Made again, had to use Greek yogurt in place of the buttermilk.  Put together in the morning to serve at dinnertime. Added bits of chopped green pepper.

Very good.  Next time I'll use a little less sugar.  Definitely better the next day.  We used this on Reubens.  Thanks for the recipe.  Also, I've never used bagged slaw before and it was fine and easy.

This has become a staple in our home, served along with the pulled pork sandwiches. I always shred my own cabbage, and add a carrot or two - shredded - for color.

This was very good and easy to make!  We used prepared coleslaw mix.  We didn't have any buttermilk, so we used a little more milk.  It was very good!!

Great taste.  I did add a little more sugar due to my family liking it a little sweeter, but otherwise followed to the T.

I've been making this for some time now.  It's a very good recipe as is.  To those who think it's too runny the next day, try mixing it up again to redistribute the dressing.  Also, keep in mind that not all dressings are thick.  The buttermilk gives it a nice tang along with the vinegar (I like rice wine vinegar--mild) and the lemon juice (which really brightens the flavor).  All in all, my favorite cole slaw recipe.  Thanks, Marsha!

Aweeesome!  Great flavor, it was sweet, tangy and yes I have to admit it, a bit runny but not enough to ruin our meal.  I'll be making it again for sure.

I changed the servings for this to 30 because I was making it for a baby shower at work. Everyone said it was good, but there was a lot left. I would like to try the original recipe.

This is a great coleslaw recipe. The only thing I sometimes change is the prechopped slaw mix. To me, chopping up the cabbage yourself makes for a much better tasting slaw. Not as fast or convenient though. Thanks for the great keeper recipe.

Really good hubby loves it with a little extra sugar...you can totally skip the buttermilk as it can be expensive most of the time & if you are short on time you can pop it in the freezer to set for 30 mins or less and it's like it was chilled for an hour or two.

Perfect recipe!  I have made this numerous times.  When I have the time, I like to chop the cabbage myself and shred the carrots instead of buying the bag of shredded veggies. I mix the dressing and chop everything the day before I need it and mix it all together just a little while before serving.

This was very good. I made the dressing ahead of time and mixed it in about an hour before serving. This allowed me to add the dressing to taste and also the cabbage was nice and crunchy.

Really good basic recipe. Good as is or to play with to meet your tastes.   I shredded my own mix -- red cabbage (half head), green cabbage (half head) and carrots (couple).  Also I halved the sugar and it was plenty sweet - but I don't like mine very sweet though.  Also, put in a touch of mustard powder and minced garlic.  For me the mustard powder eased the sweetness of the sauce.  Enjoy!

Delicious recipe.  I made the dressing the night before in Mason jar and left it in the fridge for the flavours to meld.  I then added another dollop if mayo before I dressed the cabbage mix.  Again, very delicious mix of sweet/sour and creamy, but not a sickly creamy.  Just right.

This was great!!! I substituted soy milk for the regular milk and buttermilk to make the coleslaw non-dairy. You would never know that I substituted! I also added some craisins (dried cranberries) on a whim. It tasted awesome! We couldn't get enough.

Great slaw!  I cut out the buttermilk since I didn't have it on hand.  I also cut down on the sugar to a little less than 1/3 cup because I didn't want it too sweet.  This turned out great....and I will continue to make it w/o the buttermilk, for me it is not needed.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  I omitted the onion because I didn't feel like chopping it up (it was late at night).  It was still great though, next time I will add it.  I also used splenda in place of real sugar.  Those are the only changes.

We've got a winner!  I sampled it before I allowed it to chill and it was great.  Can't wait to have some once the flavors have had a chance to blend together.  I ran out of lemon juice after about 1/2 T, so subbed lime juice for the remaining amount. Based on other reviews, I reduced sugar down to 1/4 cup. I also upped the amount of black pepper just due to preference.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

VERY GOOD!! I doubled the recipe and cut up my own carrot, onion, and cabbage.  I'd have given it 5 stars but I left out about 1/3 of the lemon juice. Will definitely make again!

This is going to be my staple recipe for simple, tasty coleslaw.  I added about a teaspoon more of the white wine vinegar for extra tang, and used light mayo with great results.  For the best flavor, I would chill for at least 2-3 hours.

This is the best coleslaw I've ever eaten; excellent balance of flavors!  I added about 1 tsp. of celery seed.  I will probably leave out the 1/4 c. milk next time since the dressing was rather thin even before I mixed it with the shredded cabbage & carrots.

This recipe was divine. Best coleslaw I have ever made. I shredded my own cabbage along with some carrots and green onions. I let it sit for an hour and served it with pulled pork off of this site. I can imagine the would be even better if it were to sit over night. I will never buy coleslaw from the store again.

I left out the butter milk because I didn't have any, and substituted more white vinegar in place of the lemon juice.  Very tasty!

This recipe is awesome.  I make this all the time.  I leave out the minced onion, but make everything else exactly as the recipe says.  Except, I never have buttermilk on hand, so I make my own with milk and lemon juice.  This coleslaw is delicous!  I used to think I didn't like coleslaw, but this recipe changed my mind!

I thought the taste of this coleslaw was amazing, but next time I would use mayonnaise instead of Miracle-Whip because it was really sweet! There was also too much sauce for the amount of coleslaw, so you might add another 1/2 bag of coleslaw if you don't like it runny. Otherwise, great recipe- thank you!!

This coleslaw is excellent! I cut up my own coleslaw (.5 Small Green Cabbage; 2 carrots; .3 Small Red Cabbage) and added some cranberries and sunflower seeds. Yummy, it's just like my favorite coleslaw at the restaurant!  Enjoy!

This recipe was pretty good, I didn't add the onions (don't like them) and used low fat mayo (I usually use fat free for coleslaw but didn't have any).  I didn't add any milk or buttermilk, which is a good thing or it would have been way too runny!  The consistency was perfect without.  Next time I'll probably use half the amount of lemon juice and vinegar as it was a bit too acidic and I may add a little more sugar.

That was my first time making coleslaw, and it was really, really good! I shredded about 1/2 a head of cabbage and 1 carrot... turned out to be about 2 liters of slaw, which was perfect for the amount of dressing.

This is a winner. My husband says this coleslaw is better than at many restaurants he's tried. I pair it with pulled pork sandwiches & corn on the cob. Always a hit at my house.

Excellent. Nice and creamy. Suggest that you let it sit in the fridge for at least 4 to 5 hours to concentrate the ingredients.

This is so GREAT! The only thing I do different is just a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon. I don't really prefer to taste the lemon in my coleslaw. Other than that this recipe is very yummy! Thank you!

Fantastic KFC coleslaw!!  I left out the minced onions (personal preference).  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used regular milk (note that skim milk works fine in this recipe).  I left the sugar amount as is, but would decrease it to 1/4 cup (as others suggested) for next time.  I thought this was way too much dressing (I combined everything & let it sit overnight), so next time I will double the amount of coleslaw.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Made this last week in search of a specific coleslaw recipe I had in a restaurant last month. It was pretty close to what I was looking for. Was a little too much dressing for the 16 oz bag, in my opinion. The onion gave it a nice flavor, though, and hubby gobbled it right up. I would definitely make it again, but not before I find the slaw that I'm dying to replicate.

So great!  Have made this twice in two weeks and took a double batch to a 4th of July party.  My husband says this is the best slaw he's ever had.  It's really good.  the first one we ate right away, the second one was in the fridge for all day and it really didn't taste much different.  I added celery seed and it made the whole salad.  Will make this many more times to come.

Thank you Marsha for the best cole slaw recipe I have ever made. I have taken the advice of others and only put the dressing on when ready to serve, and the dressing does get better the longer it sets. Hubby took it to work and the daughter got ahold of it and licked the plate clean. She asked what store he got it from, he said Mom made it. I will be giving her your recipe. It's a keeper :)

This is one of the best coleslaw recipes I have ever made.  I was even asked what store I purchased it at.  I put only 1/4 cup sugar in it, and I used 1/2 cup milk with the 2T. lemon juice instead of the buttermilk.  Everyone loves it.

This makes the best coleslaw!  I never have buttermilk so I leave that out & make up for it with more milk, half the amount of sugar & it is fabulous!

Not too bad, however, not what I was looking for. I like a slight 'tang' to my coleslaw dressing (and am used to getting this in restaurants), but this had too much. It was very creamy though. I will make again, but reduce the lemon juice and vinegar next time. When you first pour the dressing on, it seems like there's not enough, but after it chills for an hour, it develops into that creamy consistency you're used to.

I don't really care for coleslaw, but my husband loves KFC so I made some of this for him.  He loved it and his only comment was to maybe cut back on the vinegar a little bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

This will be my number one slaw recipe!  I quadrupled this recipe because I had a two cookouts to go to over the weekend. I didn't add the lemon juice because I didn't have any and also because I've never used lemon juice for slaw before.  I do think it would be a nice accent and will try it next time.  I chopped the bagged slaw mix in the food processor to make it less chunky and easier to spoon over a hot dog.  I only used about 75% of the sugar, and the sweetness was just right for my taste.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I am not a cole slaw eater, but my husband is so I made this part of his Father's Day dinner.  He is used to the store brand cole slaw, but I wanted him to have a special dinner with marinated steak (soy sauce/ginger marinade found on this site), slaw, and grilled corn.  Wow! He LOVED it! I used two 10 oz. bags of angel hair slaw, and had plenty of dressing for all of it.  I also left out the onion (personal preference), but pretty much followed the recipe exactly.  All of the kids ate it, and said "wow Mom, YOU made this???"  Wouldn't change a thing, and will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Good. I added some purple cabbage to this and used poppy seed dressing instead of the mayo and milk/buttermilk. I also used balsamic vinegar. Most of family are not fans of coleslaw and this was a big hit for our family.

Really good. To lighten it up, I used mostly nonfat yogurt instead of the mayo, then added the vinegar to taste since yogurt's pretty tangy. I swear, you won't miss the mayo!

My husband loved this, reminding him of his grandmother's coleslaw (as long as I shredded the cabbage very thin).  I prefer a less creamy, sweet slaw, but for those who love theirs sweet and creamy, this is definitely the right recipe.

Very good! Everyone loves this one. I did alter it some though. I didn't use the milk & I doubled the mayo (I use the olive oil mayo) then I added an extra tablespoon of the vinegar since we like more tang.

I took some suggestions from others.  Had no buttermilk so added slightly more milk, instead of onion used 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. of onion powder because our family does not like to crunch into an onion.  I put mix in a large baggie and put liquid mix over it, sealed it and shifted it around until mixed well-wonderful, best i have ever had.

Excellent!  So much better and cheaper than store bought.  Make sure and let it sit a while in the fridge before serving and remember that it shrinks quite a bit too.  We served it with BBQ pork ribs and it was delicious!

This was very good although I felt like it had a bit too much lemon juice when I first tried it.  Once it sat overnight the lemon flavor subided. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used 1/4 cup milk and 1 1/3 tsp. cream of tartar.  And I just noticed that I completly forgot the onion but it was good anyway.

Thought this might be the one, but no way. Why is sugar and vineger put in every cole slaw recipe? If made with sour cream and mayo instead of buttermilk then it doesn't become so 'drippy'. Down South sweet cole slaw on Bar-B-Q just doesn't make the grade. Sorry

Very good!  Did not change a thing.  I was worried it had too strong of an onion flavor, but the longer it "marinaded", the less it tasted oniony.  I would have it sit for at least 15 hours and as it starts to juice more, I would just move the slaw into another serving bowl, if you don't like it too runny.

Wow! This is a hit!  I changed up the dressing a bit. I left out the minced onion and added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. onion powder because I have family that can hunt out the tiniest piece of onion. They loved it!  I made up the dressing and stored it in the fridge in a jar.  It's ready when I am.  This is a hit for potlucks too!  All raves and wanted my 'secret' recipe.

This recipe was awesome. I used green onions cut very thin instead of white onion. I also cut the sugar way down and left out the milk, only using buttermilk. I let the dressing sit seperately in the fridge, from the cabbage/onion mix. I mixed all it together an hour before serving and added 1/2 can of drained pineapple cut in small pieces. I didnt notice any runniness and everyone went for seconds and thirds.

This is a great recipe! I also used splenda and increased the white wine vinegar to 2tbs. I shred a whole cabbage and add the dressing when I am ready to use the cole slaw as there are only 2 of us. Sometimes I add onion and green pepper, for a little different flavor which we really enjoy.

Very good. There was a little too much liquid after it chilled, so next time I will cut back a little on the lemon juice or vinegar. But overall excellent - tastes exactly like what you would find at a restaurant!

None of us liked this at all.  I was expecting something like KFC's coleslaw - not even close - flavorless - sorry

This tastes just like the coleslaw you would get at a restaurant. I had to use Miracle Whip becuase we were out of mayo, but I'm sure its just as good. I am so happy I found this recipe, thanks!

Since made this for Easter dinner last year, I am asked to make it for each family picnic and holiday dinner!  If I am making a big batch, I use three bags of coleslaw and double the dressing ingredients.  Also, I use red onions.  Turns out great.

I have looked for a great coleslaw recipe for a long time.  Nothing comes close to this one.  Very good and as close to restaurant quality as you can get.  I always get compliments when I make it.

I doubled the onion and put it in my small food processor to puree seeing as my husband doesn't like the onion texture.  When those were small,I added all the other ingredients for the sauce and blended until the sauce was nice and smooth then poured over the coleslaw mix.  I gave it three hours in the frig stirring every hour.  Served with pulled chicken sandwiches, it was perfect.

My husband is very picky about his coleslaw and he thinks thisw is one of the better ones he has had. I don't really like coleslaw but I like this one. The only thing I change was put only a little onion. I have friends that don't like onions.

I made this to serve along with pulled pork sandwiches.  I have to say that I liked it.. but not enough to give 5 stars.. I feel like there was something missing.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I didn't add that.. but I used all of the other ingredients.  I might cut back on the sugar next time.. it was wayy to sweet.  I like something with a little more vinegar taste.  I might make it again.

I've made this at least 5 times this summer, without changing the recipe at all. I was never even a big coleslaw fan before. I love the tangy flavor. It's quick to throw together while the baby is napping. Be sure to let it sit in the fridge for at least a few hours before serving.

Liked the addition of buttermilk. I have been basically making my coleslaw this way for years, except for buttermilk, so it added nicely. I use only 1 tb of minced onion and use 1/4 cup of Spelnda instead of 1/3 c sugar & lite mayo.

Great and very simple! Have been looking for a good coleslaw recipe and found it with this. I did not have butter milk so I used evaporated milk instead and added a TBL spoon of lemon juice to that let it sit for 5 min. then followed the recipe. It was great.

Fabulous!  I followed another's advice - made the sauce the day before and refrigerated separate from the slaw until 1 hour before serving.  Had one kid eating it straight from the container even after dessert!

we doubled the recipe for a family gathering, and it was perfect!
instead of using a bag of veggies, we shredded 30 ounces cabbage & 2 ounces carrots.  it blended up perfectly & oh so delicious.  thanks for the great recipe!

Basic Creamy Coleslaw. Can't get much better than that. This is enough dressing for 2 pkg of coleslaw though unless you like it really thick.

This coleslaw is excellent!  I made it for my husband when we cooked out for Memorial Day and he loved it. The only thing I did differently was to add a bit of sweet pickle relish to the mix. I always like to do that for a little extra "kick"  :-D

Out of this world cole slaw. I buy the bag of ready slaw and only make three adjustments; more on onions, pepper, and add parsley to the dressing. Everyone LOVES this recipe and they go on and on about it. I have made it about five times and making again today for tomorrow to go along with the beer butt chicken I am making off of this site as well (I give that one a five star review as well!) Yummmmm!

The dressing tasted great, although we only used about half the amount called for and still felt it was plenty.  Missing some celery seed, but otherwise very nice.

Yummy.  I didn't have buttermilk and didn't substitute anything for it-just left it out.  I added the onion to the dressing and let the dressing sit a few hours and mixed it with the slaw right before serving.  Also, used light mayo, and misread the ingredients so used white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  ALSO added a little celery seed because I like it, but that's a personal thing.  I liked it better the first day right after mixing everything together, but it was good as leftovers, just runny like everyone else said.  We only got four servings out of it so obviously we liked it.

I must say this recipe was great!! I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and used splenda instead of regular sugar. I couldn't believe the taste. I've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. My family couldn't get enough of it. Thanks Marsha!!

If you close your eyes, your mouth will convince you that you're eating the same famous coleslaw that is finger licking good.  Really!  I didn't think it was going to even approximate that recipe, but it is virtually indistinguishable.

Everyone loved the cole slaw. I only used half the amount of onions as recommended by other people.  I made it about 3 hours before I served it.  It did have a pool of juice at the bottom of the dish but no one seemed to complain that the slaw was too soggy.  They loved the taste.  Would definitely make again.

There are only two coleslaws I really LOVE.  KFC comes in first place with Bob Evans a close second.  This tastes exactly like KFC!!! I made this the night before serving.  I was going to hold off on putting the onion in until just before serving per another reviewers suggestion that the onion overpowered the slaw after an overnight stay in the fridge.  I won't be adding the onion at all.  It does not need it!  Thanks Marsha!  This is AWESOME!!!

This recipe was okay...I didn't have the buttermilk so didn't add it, but it was already very runny without it.  I think it's personal preference, but we didn't really like this one. Not creamy enough??

This recipe is one of the best I have ever tried. The only thing that I added, was 1/8th tsp. of celery seed to the the basic mixture for(8) servings. Obviously, this will need to be adjusted according to the amount of servings desired,however, the addition of the celery seed gave it that extra pizzaz. I tried this at a recent get together with about 25 family members and friends, and it was the rave.

Absolutely loved it! Best ever! I think it should call for 2-16oz bags of coleslaw though. It definitely gets runny after a bit. I used seasoned rice wine vinegar instead of white wine.Also, I thought about lessening the sugar but I didn't and thought it was fabulous. This is a keeper!

Yes, this is it.  This is definitely restaurant quality.  Oh my goodness it is the best by far.  I used fresh onion as other reviews suggested.  Reduced the 1/3 cup sugar to just a tablespoon jsut beacuse I don't care for a very sweet slaw.  This one is going to be a mainstay in my recipe file.  It does tend to get runny as it sits in the fridge as a leftover.  So who cares, just eat and enjoy!

Simply the best!  I used fresh red cabbage. Finely chopped celery - 1/2 cup. Absolutely no milk. 1 T minced shallot. 2 T lemon juice. Sprinkled the finished salad with name brand seasoning salt.
Definately chill for an hour or overnight!

Goodbye store bought cole slaws!

Thank you so much Marsha!

Sooooo Good!!! I did not have buttermilk but looked on my cookbook substitution page and made my own (easy) did not have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar, just a couple splashes and this was awesome I went out and bought the white wine vinegar so I can make it with that next time. Thanks for the great recipe

This was exactly what I was looking for.  I made this the first time as written.  The second time I omitted the onion, as a personal preference.  Without the onion, this is the perfect slaw recipe.  I served this with an eastern carolina bbq recipe from this site as well as corn bread and baked beans.  Dinner was absolutly delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This turned out wonderful!  I made it exactly as the directions state, with the exception of the vinegar.  I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar as suggested by another person in their review.  And they were right, the red wine vinegar does not alter the taste at all.  I will definitely make this again.

Really good, followed the recipe exactly. Turned out to have a little too much onion flavor for our tastes. Definitely will keep as a staple recipe...just with reduced onion.

Thanks Marsha for a wonderful Coleslaw.  I made this with no changes except I didn't have any white wine vinegar so I substituted it with red wine vinegar.  This did not alter the taste at all.  I will be making this again.  I made this to go on top of my BBQ Pork for Sandwiches on this site submitted by KK.  Wonderful.

Hmmm...this recipe wasn't particularily my favorite but my boyfriend really liked it.  I cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup, plus I added 1 tablespoon of celery  seed.  I thought that it had just the right amount of sweetness but that it was still lacking  a little something.

sorry, I wasn't particularly fond of this recipe.  It tasted too bitter and sweet for my tastes. Also, it seemed a bit runny.

Phenomenal. This was my first and last try experimenting with coleslaw recipes. It was exactly what I was looking for and I'll  never need to look for another again! A definite winner with everyone else who tried it, as well. :)

Best Coleslaw I've ever made. I did add a Tablespoon of celry seed and used onion powder instead of the minced fresh onion.  Definately the only coleslaw recipe I'll ever use..and will make it often!!

Mmmmmmm!!!  This is awesome and a very versatile and flexible recipe.  I did a few things different and it came out great.  I used a whole head of lettuce, decreased the sugar slightly, omitted the lemon juice and buttermilk, and added some celery seed.  I think the celery seed is key, it wouldn't taste like real coleslaw without, so that is why I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5.  It was perfectly sweet and tangy and creamy.  I took it to my boyfriends' parents' house for Easter and everyone was raving about it.  His dad is supposed to be the coleslaw king, and his mom whispered to me that it was better than his, but don't tell him!

Perfect basic coleslaw. Just the right balance of creaminess, sweetness, tartness and crunchiness. I added about 1/2 tsp. of celery seed for flavor.

Excellent.  I used all buttermilk, just because.  Why anyone would even compare this to KFC is wierd.  The two tastes are planets apart.

I put a little bit more onion (about a teaspoon more) but that is all I changed. Followed the recipe otherwise. Came out perfect! My boyfriend loved it.

Loved it. I made this the night before I needed so the dressing had time to marry with the coleslaw mix. Wonderful. I used mine to make chili slaw dogs. The only thing that's bad about this recipe is that my husband sometimes like slaw (finicky taste buds) and my three boys just don't eat it. So I'm stuck with a big bowl of coleslaw that I have to devour all my myself. Well. . . more for me. Thanks for the recipe will make again when we have our annual family BBQ day.

ok, we have made this SEVERAL times. I do not use the onion, use SPLENDA instead of sugar, and do not use the milk. The buttermilk and mayo is enough. Another thing that my husband requested was to add more shredded carrots to it, and slivered almonds.

This isn't the best coleslaw I've ever tasted, but it's certainly the best coleslaw I've made myself! I wish I'd omitted the milk - once I'd added the mayo it was way too wet, and I didn't have anything else to add to my slaw mix. I threw in a little celery seed because I like the flavor. This is definitely better the next day. Good recipe. Thanks, Marsha!

This was a great recipe for traditional coleslaw.    followed the recipe almost exactly. was the PERFECT blend of sweet and tangy. at first the recipe didn't seem like anything great - a little bland actually, but when i mixed it together - IT ROCKED!  6 hours later in the frig and it was a 5 star. Wasn't too creamy or heavy either, which was great.  It's simple, and it's good.  (I did add a little more onion - sweet vadalia - than the recipe called for. and you could taste it.  but we love onions so it was great!)

Simply Wonderful! I took this to a party and it was a hit!!! I used light Mayonnaise to save on the calories. I did notice that it was a bit soupy (like other reviewers commented on) so i added another cup or so of shredded cabbage to make it less soupy. I will definitely make it again. Thanks!

This was good coleslaw.  I omitted the onion because I do not prefer onions in coleslaw.  The dressing was good however after sitting for a couple hours the slaw was a bit soupy.  I served with a slotted spoon.  You could easily add more cabbage/slaw mix to make it less soupy.  Overall though the flavor was good.

I found this recipe because I was having a mayo craving and knew I had some packaged slaw mix.  Overall, it was Awesome!  I bumped up the amount of dressing a little - 1/3 of milk and buttermilk, and a healthy 2/3 of mayo. Didn't have as much lemon as called for but added what I had. Left out the onion and decreased the sugar to about 1/4 t. Substituted white vinegar for white wine. Added a little garlic powder and Lawry's Seasoned Salt.  Then proceeded to attack the salad before it had even set its full hour.  Fabulous!  Wonderful! I'm saving this recipe!

I love coleslaw and much to my sadness, was never able to make a good slaw. Marsha, you've earned my eternal gratitude by changing that! This was terrific. I used red wine vinegar because that's what I had on hand and its soooo good! Next time, I'm gonna sneak a bit of broccoli slaw in and see if I can get it past my picky granddaughter.

This is the only coleslaw recipe that I have made where it actually tasted really great. All of the other recipes I've tried had too much vinegar. This one is just right. No leftovers on this one, which never happened before!!

Wonderfully creamy - a nice blend of flavors. I substituted plain low-fat yogurt for the buttermilk and it still had great flavor and consistency.

The name of this recipe fits it perfectly.  It tastes just like the slaw you would get in a restaurant.  The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I didn't think the recipe made enough "dressing"--it seemed a little dry.  (This may be a "mid-western" preference.) I've made it twice now--the first time I doubled the dressing and it was a little soupy so I just drained it, the second time I did my best to make one and a half times the dressing.  I also added celery seed the second time and it came out perfect.  As other reviewers have noted the slaw tastes better after it's been in the fridge overnight so don't hesitate to make it ahead.  Really great flavor and definately added to my favorites list.

This is the first time I've ever made anything from here and the first time that I've ever made coleslaw.  I don't even like coleslaw.  Well I do now!  I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I got rave reviews but no leftovers!  Thanks!

This is a really good coleslaw, however it does not taste like it is from a restaurant. Still taste great I recomend giving it a try. I did not have any buttermilk so I substituted a 1/4 cup of sour cream. Next time I will make with the buttermilk perhaps that is what gives it that restaurant taste.

I was cooking for a friend who requested coleslaw with dinner and since I don't care for coleslaw, well I didn't have a clue what it took to make a good batch. So out to Allrecipies I go and boy did I make points with this one. It's nice when you get asked for the recipe you used to make something you don't even like, ha!

I think this coleslaw is great! I only had a taste of it when I made it last night~ I plan on having it with dinner tonight. I did add a little extra mayo to make it a tad creamier, and used only buttermilk. Yummy!

Sooooooo good. My hubby isn't a huge coleslaw fan and he liked it enough to have two servings! I love coleslaw and this is one of the best I've tased. I made it the night before and so it was really cold and the dressing had time to really soak in the cabbage. It was fabulous!

This coleslaw was surprisingly sweet.  I made it with packaged brocolli coleslaw and served with marinated chicken and fries.

After this sat in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, it got a bit liquidy.  I was a bit surprised, but I just served it with a slotted spoon and was pretty pleased with it.  I will definitely make it again.

mmmmm!  i'm a coleslaw novice, and this was a great first recipe!  i've heard that it also is good to add a bit of celery seed and garlic powder for seasoning, but also is good as recipe is written.  a friend of mine for dinner cannot stomach onions...ever...and this was just as good when i omitted the onions.  was particularly good with the freak'n good ribs recipe.  yum!  will have to make for my next family grill-out...excellent...thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly, except, I only used about 1/3 of the dressing.  Was still a little runny, but taste great.

this was good, but i think needed more zing. next time ill cut the sugar to 1/4 as suggested and maybe up the vinegar as well. i made it with purple cabbage, yellow pepper, green onion and some califlower. colourful and tasty.

made with our smoked pulled pork at my daughter's graduation party.  The buttermilk is a great touch.  I also added a couple chopped green onions and some celery seed.

Delicious! I am not a coleslaw fan, but this is a very good recipe, very creamy.
I made it for a family dinner yesterday, and it was a big hit. I will be using this recipe from now on.

Really easy to make and the lemon/vinegar gives it a tart flavor.
