My husband & 4 boys loved it! It's a good,quick,cheap meal for a family on a budget. I got pre packaged Cole slaw & broccoli slaw. We also sprinkled sesame seeds on top. So many textures & colorful. So I only had to cut the purple cabbage & I grated the carrots. Super simple & low carbs. 
Def. making again & added to my favs. Folder.

This is really, really good-and yes, it is addictive. I messed with the veggies, using snow peas and bean sprouts and I didn't have any red cabbage so I doubled the green cabbage. I also added hot peppers. I used marinated steak that I had sliced super thin instead of ground beef (didn't have any on hand). The "sauce" is pretty darn tasty. The addition of the lime and cilantro is key here. Adding all the other veggies though, I think, kept it away from being a "slaw" and more a stir-fry-still good but I veered it away from its original intention. The taste is addictive, refreshing and crisp. It served nicely with a cold beer. Thank you for the recipe.

After reading the reviews, I did use less cabbage, more beef, more ginger and aromatics, and some sugar. I added blanched sugar snap peas, and I really liked this dish! Great for bento box the next day... I had to hide some to make sure it survived until then! I really liked the versatility of this recipe. It does help clean out the refrigerator of veggie tidbits.

I added 1/4 cup sake, 3 tbsp mirin, and 3 to 4 tbsp of honey to the soy sauce and sesame oil; this remedied the very much needed sweetness punch.  I increased the ginger and garlic to 4 tbsp.  I also used 2 lbs of thinly sliced beef.  I kept the cabbage amounts the same.  The cilantro and lime hits are a must at the end.  I bet those who say that they feel something is missing probably skipped the fresh cilantro and lime juice.  It really does make a difference.  I will likely add cayenne to it next time as we love heat around here.

Made this tonight as instructed but only used green cabbage   as they were out of purple.  Next time I will buy a bag of pre-cut coleslaw so it has both. I used about 1/4 cup gluten free tamari soy sauce since that's what I had left and used Trader Joe's Coconut amminos for the remaining amount, which were really good and had a hint of sweetness with the savory flavor of soy sauce without the soy. Highly recommend it. Also used Trader Joe's sirracha sauce for the hot sauce called for. Added quite a bit since we like it fairly spicy. Definitely add the fresh lime juice and cilantro as called for, as it boosts the flavor. I also added some sesame seeds and liked that addition. My husband thought this was great and said he'd eat it again for sure! It's a winner a our house

This was good - I made it with left over cubed white turkey meat from Thanksgiving but I don’t think that detracted. It does need some additions I think. I didn’t have cilantro which would definitely make it better. I didn’t want to add sugar because not everything I make should be sweet, but I can see how that could help. Wolfgang pucks Chinese chicken salad has what I think is horseradish- sounds gross but it works! Green onions, sesame seeds, more garlic - tahini? This is one to play with.

We loved this recipe. It makes a lot so we only used a quarter head of each cabbage and julienned the carrots. It sounded like an unusual recipe, but the floors are wonderful!! Also doesn't hurt there's no carbs, gluten or dairy.

I made the recipe as written.  It is just an Asian stir fry with a really bad sauce  (just soy and sesame oil) and ground beef .  Don't waste your time.  There are too many great recipes out there.

Super yummy! I've made this twice now, and the first time I chopped onions and sauteed them with the garlic, and I actually liked it better with the onions. Will definitely make it again!

I loved this dish!  Made it with ground turkey and used 2 bags of a  shredded red cabbage/green cabbage mix with carrots.  Added a habanero pepper  in lieu of hot sauce.  Everything else was the same (and no sugar).   As the name says, I found the flavor addicting and it was only with great will power that I limited myself to one helping.

I am giving this five stars because it is so easy to make it your own. These ingredients are a great base to add lots of flavors to or just enjoy "as is". I added ginger, turmeric, curry, and a handful of other spices. I left out the beef and used just the veggies as a filler for chicken tacos. It was also great as a side dish on its own. We will definitely be making this again!

My husband won't TOUCH cooked cabbage however he loved this and had seconds!  SO DID I!  The only change I made was to add a little Splenda to it.  This is delicious even though I wasn't sure I was going to like it.  Boy did we ever like it!  Addictive is a great description!  Be sure to put tons of chopped fresh Cilantro on top of each serving, too!  I am going to make this for company soon.  They are on a low carb diet and this fits the bill!  Absolutely wonderful!

Oh my gosh. I took other reviewers advice and added more ginger and garlic but otherwise mostly kept it the same. Got regular soy sauce instead of low sodium so I didn’t add salt or pepper. It made me giggle when I tried the end product. Like many others said don’t leave out the lime. It is the glue of the recipe. It won’t taste the same without it. Fantastic and yummy

I thought this was ok/good. I don't think it was 'addictive' or stand out as that title indicates. the 'sauce' was only ok. I've made other stirfrys (which is what this resembles if you use the pre shredded cabbage bag) that were better and the sauce stood out more.  I made this as specifiedv but with sliced beef instead of ground beef. I added sliced mushrooms, sugar snap peas and used a bag of shredded coleslaw mix to save time (as suggested by another user).

So, in our house we try to incorporate meat substitutes into our diet often and I just made a half recipe of this using everything according to recipe (I hope sriracha qualifies as "hot sauce")but the beef, which I substituted for soy mince (reconstituted soy that has the consistency of ground beef). 

I can see how this is an amazing recipe, but I already give it 5 stars with our vegetarian version. The veggies were crunchy and tasty, the lime added an almost sweet zing to the pepper that was very refreshing ans surprising and you really MUST eat this out of a bowl. Why?

Because then, at the end, you get the treat of having all that tasty meat in sauce to just scoop and gobble up. It was great with soy, with meat it must be insane. 

Thank for this, sharing with the whole family!

Edible but not tasty is what my husband says. The only flavor it had was something peculiar. Perhaps we are not used to sesame oil.....? Will never make it again.

I am giving this four stars; my husband says three. I followed one reviewer's advice and used coleslaw mix and broccoli slaw. Very little chopping to do that way. It was quick and easy to put together. I would make it again. Next time I plan to add green onions. It seemed to be missing a little something.

I will probably make this again and use olive oil instead of the sesame oil, which was overpowering. I will also add a tablespoon or so of vinegar and maybe a teaspoon of coconut sugar. It seemed like it needed some tangy-ness and sweetness. I also didn't like the texture of the ground beef paired with the cabbage, so I might use thin sliced beef roast next time.

I needed a bigger skillet so I cooked only half the needed cabbage. Without the reduced sodium soy sauce, it is salty, but still very tasty. The ginger and garlic blend well for this recipe.

Definitely a keeper!!!  My only substitution was Coconut aminos in place of soy.  Took longer to cook than noted, about twice the time but it's so quick it wasn't annoying.  I started to eat without the lime and cilantro, then remembered.  For me it kicked it up to the five stars, I will always add them.  My husband preferred with just the lime, no cilantro.  Thank you for an easy, delicious meal.

Everyone liked this!  It was easy and delicious.  Added some green onion and white onion because I already had it cut and added extra garlic.  Have to have the cilantro and lime.  They MAKE this dish.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as is.

I didn't have quite a pound of meat but stuck to the rest of the recipe.  Easy, fast, tasty. That means 5 stars in my book.

The recipe is very adaptable for different tastes - I used a broccoli/carrot/kale slaw in combination with a packaged cole slaw and added some red pepper flakes and green onions to the condiment options. Such an easy and delicious meal!

Excellent lo-carb recipe. Followed recipe on the first go round. Next time I would cut back slightly on the soy sauce. Also, I shredded cabbage a little too thin. Next time I would  go a bit thicker to give it more body. I think ground pork, ground turkey or thinly sliced steak would be excellent as well. Maybe a use for leftover beef roast? Delicious!

This had a completely different flavor from anything I ever tried before. Hubby and I agreed it was good, but not something we plan to make again. I do wonder if differences in sesame oil account for the varying reviews on this recipe. I used the very dark and flavorful sesame seed oil I had left from another recipe. I know that in the past the flavor overwhelmed me, so I cut it in half for this recipe. I also felt like I lost some of the garlic and ginger flavor when I drained the hamburger grease, so I added more garlic and dried ginger (although I started the recipe with fresh ginger). I agree with everyone that the cilantro and fresh lime really enhanced the flavor. Hubby added a little brown sugar to his serving after trying it, and I drizzled honey on my serving. If I were to make this again, I would cut back even more on both sesame oil and soy sauce, and I would add honey to the mixture. I would also probably experiment with using flank steak instead of ground beef.

This recipe was very good! It tasted even better the next day. The only change we made was the dash of hot sauce. My husband put in about a teaspoon of chili paste. It wasn’t overbearing. It gave the recipe a nice flavor without being too spicy. I will make it again!

Easy, quick and delicious.  I used one package of  Cole slaw to save time.  I think the next time I make this recipe, I may add a can of water chest nuts and some roasted sesame seeds.  Overall, great recipe!

Not for me. I thought the hot sauce and the soy sauce didn’t go together. Maybe if I had used Chinese chili sauce instead it would have been better, but the recipe didn’t specify a type of hot sauce. I was glad I drained the hamburger grease before adding sesame oil. Even still it was a bit greasy. It was okay but not something I will make again.

I gave this five stars but it needs something.  I actually liked it better after it had cooled off.  Seems like there was too much cabbage and too much soy sauce.  May take some of the other reviewers advice on add-ons but this was pretty good.  Thanks for sharing!  Will make it again.

Okay, it's a really great idea and I will use the beef and veggies as a base but the sauce was WAAAAAYY too salty even though I used the reduced sodium soy sauce and didn't add any additional salt.  Next time I will half the recipe on this site called Simple Teriyaki Sauce.  It is a nice mix of water, soy sauce, garlic and ginger, brown sugar, honey, and cornstarch for thickening.  I will still keep the cilantro and lime, but will add green onion and sesame seed as a garnish.

Now that I eat Keto (LCHF), I made a couple of adjustments:
Skipped Canola and subbed Coconut oil.
Used 1 Lb. Ground Pork for a more typical flavor
Used Sambal instead of hot sauce.
Used Coconut Aminos in lieu of Soy Sauce.

This is a the best quick and easy, one skillet Keto dinner!  My non-keto family loves it too!!

Family loved it!!! I had left over Beef tenderloin which I sliced into thin strips instead of ground beef.   Followed the directions for the sliced vegetables and stir fry.  Used  package coleslaw mix.  Once the veggies were tender I handed the beef and heated it through.  Added the sesame oil, soy sauce and lime.  I was delicious.  New family favorite

Delicious! I made this with ground turkey instead of beef, and added 2 minced Bird's Eye chili peppers to the garlic/ginger mix which gave it just the right amount of kick for me.  My cabbages were quite large, so I stopped shredding when my wok was full. I'm not much of a salt fan, so I might try it with less soy sauce next time, as even using low-sodium tamari, I found it a bit on the salty side.

Tonight surprise.  Unexpected company.  Low and behold I had all of the ingredients necessary to make this spicey burger dish.  Each and everyone of our guests left their plates clean.  I am so pleased I had enough burger to double the recipe - cabbage from the weekend market was just waiting for this dish.  Yes I made changes - I doubled it.  I will make this dish again but probably not necessary to double it.  Thanks for this one easy to make - tasty  - healthy and filling.

The cilantro and lime are absolutely necessary for this recipe. I used 4 TBSP each of minced garlic and ginger (I used ginger paste since that's all I had on hand). That being said, it's still missing something, but overall, it's a decent recipe.

I made the recipe for a family Sunday dinner. Everyone kept going back for more. I put in extra garlic and cilantro.   I squeezed the lime on the dish before I served it. It was a hit.

Made it 2 times in 2 days!! I used Chinese cabbage with regular cabbage. I used a mix of ground pork and velveted steak. Added a lot of garlic sriracha and a lot of Thai garlic chili sauce. Soooo great.

We loved it and will definitely make again. I used venison instead of beef, tahini instead of sesame oil, tri slaw mix instead of cabbage and carrots, lemons instead of limes, and used a mix of jalapeno and bell pepper. Omitted hot sauce and cilantro. The boys added peanuts to theirs.

This was a very good recipe.  I made it according to recipe but just made a bit more sauce as I added some bok choy.  I also added more bell pepper, purchasing a pre-cut up cup of mixed green, red and yellow bell peppers.  I also added them to the garlic and green onions and sauteed a bit before adding the slaw and bok choy.  

There is a slight kick from the combo of the Cholulu and the fresh ginger.  Next time I will add even more slaw.  My husband really liked it and it is very healthy and I see as other reviewers have commented, that there are a lot of things you can do with this recipe, especially given the great sauce.

This is delicious and easy! Definitely use an extra-large skillet or wok. I added more garlic, ginger, sesame, and cilantro because we love strong flavors. The cilantro and lime are absolutely necessary. Someone more experienced with Thai cooking might want to experiment with adding other ingredients, but it was a perfect weekday meal.

Great family favorite recipe! I made almost as written - I didn’t add the sriracha to the sauce, I added it to those plates that like it. It’s a wonderful base that can be changed based on what’s you have on hand. I’ve substituted the kind of beef and added more, added sesame seeds for garnish and switched up vegetables and it always gets eaten up.

This was very different for us, but very good.  I used a bag of coleslaw mix which made it very easy.  It seemed the ratio of coleslaw to ground beef was a little too much, but of course, the coleslaw cooked down a lot.  I think next time I would increase the ground beef a bit.  I wasn't sure if hot sauce was actually "hot sauce" or Tabasco.  We used "hot sauce" and needed to add some  when we served it.   Will certainly make again.  I served it with rice, but probably didn't need to.

Too salty! I used less than a 1/3rd cup of light soy sauce. Next time I'll add it little by little and taste as I go. It could've turned out really tasty. I'll also add more garlic and ginger next time.

I did not care for this recipe. I made it with equal amount of tenderloin cut in small pieces. I also should have used prebagged slaw bc I spent a lot of time chopping this. I tasted and started adding. I wanted more acid, so added apple cider vinegar. I doubled the fresh ginger, and wish I'd have used exactly half of the cabbage.
