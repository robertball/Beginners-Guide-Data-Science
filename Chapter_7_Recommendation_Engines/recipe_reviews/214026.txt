This recipe was so easy and moist.  My whole family loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I added the juice of the zested lemons.  It's in my recipe box now.  TASTEE!

Just watch the salt, my leg of Lamb was 2 1/2lbs so I reduced the amount of salt and pepper.  Other than that this was a really good recipe...yum

Oh, this was so good.  I thinly sliced and caramelized the onions instead of putting them in raw.  Cooked the lamb longer and slower - used an electronic thermometer probe to 150, then turned off the oven and let it finish for about 20 minutes.  Made a gravy with the juices cut with chicken broth - added herbs and a bit of montrachet goat cheese to the gravy.  The family is begging me to do it again.

Perfect. I could only suggest the addition of 2-3 fresh mint leaves to the paste.

I made this recipe for Easter Sunday, and it was delicious!  Even cautious lamb eaters had second helpings.

This was wonderful.  We had just come back from an extended vacation and I only had time to let it sit in the marinate for overnight out on the counter as the leg of lamb had been frozen.  Also, no stores were open on the weekend of Easter here in Europe so I used my dried herbs and it tasted great.  The best part, instead of making gravy I used the juice and spices from the pan to make my mashed potatoes.  Wow!  They were a real hit.

Have made this recipe for my family twice now and they cannot tell me enough how much they love it!  Last time I did not have enough parsley so had to sub in cilantro and dried parsley and it was still amazing. I believe the key is the soaking and marinating for 24 hours prior, then making sure to allow the lamb to come to room temp (1 hour) prior to the second slathering of deliciousness and roasting. Bravo and Yummmmm!

Loved it! the cooking time was a-bit off, but I am at high altitudes so it's to be expected. Very moist, with good flavor.

Delicious and easy! Used lamb chops instead of lamb leg. The rub was a little too salty for us, but we'll just cut back next time

Since I've never cooked lamb before, I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was delicious.  My husband never orders lamb but has now requested that I make another leg of lamb for his birthday.

This recipe is amazing!  Made this for my family last night and they absolutely loved it.  Marinated a boneless leg of lamb for 24 hours and butterflied it and cooked on the grill for about an hour and it was perfectly medium rare!  I wish I took a picture it was gorgeous.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, along with the usual turkey.  I didn't change a thing, but I had to double everything for a 11 pound leg of lamb. I liked the tip about the thermometer as every roast cooks a little different. I used sweet onions, and would advise anyone else to do the same.  Everyone raved about this recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing, and I will likely be making this again for the next holiday!

Very tender and moist. We cooked until the roast reached 130 degrees. We like our lamb med. rare. Then we let it rest for ten minutes which continues the cooking process. We adjusted the amount of salt and pepper to 1 T of each. For us, this was plenty. We love the flavors of the coating and would not change a thing more. Thanks for a delicious roast. I know what I will be making for Easter and other times as well!

Great recipe. I used a 6 pound boneless roast (after bone was removed, and put aside), and doubled everything except the salt and pepper (way too much here). I put some lemon juice in the marinade too. Made a gravy with the drippings, flour, and beef stock.

Served with roast fingering potatoes and baby carrots with brown sugar and Dijon mustard. Yum.

Made a stock with the bones (after roasting them), and looking forward to a lamb and lentil soup.

My family tradition is lamb with mint vinegar. That is good but this recipe is great.

I made this for Easter dinner but I doubled everything as suggested for a whole leg of lamb. It seemed like way more marinade and paste than was needed but I did it that way anyway. The outcome was just so so. All the onions on the bottom burnt to a crisp. Also, I had no idea how long the whole roast would take to cook. I had to estimate and my guests were left waiting for half an hour.  Also, it would be nice to mention what to do with the string- thing that the roast comes in. Take it off right away? Leave it on for roasting? I left it on and the whole crust part fell off as we were removing the string to eat the roast. Also, are you supposed to eat the crust?
