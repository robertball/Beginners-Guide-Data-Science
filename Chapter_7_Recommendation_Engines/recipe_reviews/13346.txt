I am an Appalachian "kid" and bean soup was a staple in our family. Here is a little trick I learned.  Cover your beans, nothing else added, with cold water, and bring to a solid boil for about 10 minutes. Remove the pan DON'T DRAIN and SET THE PAN IN YOUR SINK. Throw in about 1/4 cup baking soda, (in the hills it's a handful) and stir like crazy until the foam that will appear disappears, (don't worry if the foam looks green). Drain and rinse very well in cold water to remove all the soda flavor, then start recooking according to the directions.  Doing this, you won't have to soak the beans, it cuts your cooking time, and removes maybe not all, but most of the "gas".  More soda, less gas.  The reason for setting the pan in the sink is that it will foam quite a bit and could go over the sides of your pan.  BTW, never used a bay leaf in my life for bean soup.

I boil the beans in enough water just to cover them 2x, discarding the water both times.  It gets rid of the "gas" without adding extra sodium that using baking soda provides.  Then I add enough water for the recipe, bring the beans to a boil, and add the ham bone, or ham hocks, or fried & crumbled bacon if I have no ham.  Simmer until beans are just tender.  Add the carrots and celery, and also try adding a coarsely diced green pepper; cook about 20 minutes more.  Meanwhile, I dice the onion as finely as I have patience to do, and fry it up in bacon grease.  When it's tender, I add a mixture of flour (about 1/4 cup), paprika (about 3 TBLS) and lots of black pepper. Add this to the soup, and stir and stir - the flour will just barely thicken the soup. This soup gets raves.  Contact me for canning instructions.

I really liked this dish, but I did change a few things.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used about 5 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water (I omitted the salt altogether).  I followed the recipe directions for the beans and they turned out great.  I increased the amount of vegetables though and would probably increase to about a cup of each in the future.  Once the soup was done, I removed about 1.5 cups of soup and pureed it with my hand blender, added about 1/4 cup ketchp and added that back to the soup.  The ketchup added really great flavour and the puree gave the soup a really nice consistency.  Apart from adding more vegetables, I will increase the liquid for this soup next time as we did find it a bit more "stew" (rather than soup) like.  Great recipe, thanks!

I soaked my beans overnight, like I always do. I put all the ingredients into a slowcooker, set it on low and at dinnertime we had bean soup like I remembered! I grew up putting ketchup in my soup and eating it ladled over thick slices of homemade bread! YUM

Very good recipe.  I thought it was missing something so I did add what my father made when I was young.  He used to add ketchup, much like a couple of the other reviewers mentioned.  Instead, I added a large can of whole tomatoes.  Also, I added about four diced potatoes right near the last 40 minutes.  Potatoes make it thicker, which I prefer.  I also omitted the salt.  Very good with cornbread.

This is very similar to my recipe for bean soup and it's excellent! The only thing I do differently, is that I cook everything together, rather than adding the veggies later and cook on low for 5-6 hours.  Just before serving, I add 1/4 cup of instant potato flakes to slightly thicken the stock. Don't forget to remove the bay leaf before serving!

I will adjust my review in a few days after I have made this but first I must respond to the reviewer who claims that adding baking soda to the beans will reduce the amount of gas they will cause. That is NOT true. Adding baking soda (aka sodium bicarbonate) reduce the amount of time beans need to soak but no more so than plain old table salt (sodium chloride). The gas from beans occurs when bacteria in your intestine consumes the naturally occurring sugars in the bean. The only thing you can do to minimize that while cooking is to be sure to thoroughly drain and rinse the beans after their initial soaking in hot water to remove any sugars that may have leached out of the beans into the cooking water. If that's not enough, then take some Beano before or with the first bite of the meal. That will stop the bacteria from breaking down the sugars. I know this because I'm a pharmacist.

Right after cooking, the soup is pretty bland. Much better after it sits in the refrigerator overnight. I think adding chicken broth, garlic and/or liquid smoke would help make recipe more flavorful.

I've always made my ham and navy bean soup this way, with the addition of a can of diced tomatoes or of plain tomato sauce (if the kids didn't want tomato chunks). Season to taste. sometimes I add a bit of thyme as well. Kids always like it and it's a nice hearty soup for the winter.

This was wonderful soup! Next time I will soak the beans overnight, as I had to cook it about an hour longer to soften up the beans more.  Great recipe!

As others recommended, I used the baking soda method for the beans.  This recipe was a great base for spicing up!  I used 2 whole medium onions - chopped and a whole cup of chopped carrots (didnt use celery as I don't like).  I increased the water to 7 cups & chicken broth to 5 cups.  I used 2tbsp of minced garlic, 2tsp of ground cumin, couple shakes of black pepper & 1tbsp diced jalapenos.  Lastly, after pureeing half the soup, I simmered for an additional hour.  This came out wonderful & the family loved it!!!

Following some other reviewer's suggestions, I made the following changes/ additions: used 4 c. chicken stock and 3 c. water, 1 c. each of carrots and celery. I soaked the beans overnight and then let it all cook in the crock pot all day on low. It's the most delicious soup I've ever made (and I'm 70 years old, so have made more than a few soups!) - Thanks for sharing, Pat!

WOW! Outstanding soup! I grew up on Campbell's Bean & Bacon, but will not resort to that again. The flavors of this are much more complex and satisfying. The baking soda trick was GREAT -- be sure to rinse off the beans with cold water a couple times.   
I made the following alterations: 
After cooking the beans, I put them and the remaining ingredients into a crock pot and cooked on low overnight. I used two smoked ham shanks instead of a simple ham bone, and used diced smoked turkey kielbasa in place of diced ham. I sauteed the veggies in a little olive oil before adding to the crock pot. Used good, rich chicken stock instead of water and did NOT add any salt.  A couple good shakes of Tabasco added the necessary balance.

I took some of the other reviewers suggestions when I made this recipe. I did take Barb Maxwell's advice and did the soda trick and I also used half chicken broth instead of all water. I did NOT have a ham bone but I did have a package of smoked ham NECK bones that I used instead. I thought this turned out really well but I think it could use something......something I just can't put my finger on. Garlic? Maybe another bay leaf. I'd like to play with this recipe a little.  Next time, I'd definitely increase the carrots and celery. As is, good starter recipe.

Very good, a sure keeper for when you get your hands on a ham bone.  If you want to thicken it up some, add some extra beans, and then when  you are done simmering, use a wooden spoon and mash some of the beans in the pot, this will thicken your base.

Soup was great.  Of course, I modified slightly.  Used 1.25 cups each carrots & celery, a whole diced onion.  2/3 of a large meaty smoked ham shank, omitted the diced ham as it was not needed.  Soaked overnight, drained soaking water and added 4 cups chicken broth + 3 cups water.  Although there was not much added salt, I would omit it next time as the ham shank added the correct amount without adding extra.  Used much more fresh cracked black pepper that called for 10-15 turns of pepper grinder.   Smashed about 1/2 the beans with a potato masher at the end for better texture.  DELICIOUS!

Always rinse the beans after soaking- can give a stomach ache or gas is you're sensitive.

These are the exact ingredients I put in my navy bean soup. Except I never add diced ham. I just use the ham bone to flavor it. A dash of garlic powder and boullion powder is also a nice touch. And, to make it even easier on me, I soak the beans overnight and then in the morning I put them and the rest of the ingredients in the crock pot. If I don't have a ham bone I will even make it vegetarian and leave it out. This is a very affordable and comforting soup that's great in the cold winter.

I started with this recipe and made a few changes.  First, my store didn't have navy beans, so I used great northern beans.  I took the advice of others and use 4 c. chicken stock and 3 c. water.  I also didn't use a ham bone.  Finally, I added 3 c. diced ham and 1 c. each of carrots and celery.  This was just the right amount of ham and veggies.  I soaked the beans overnight, then let it cook all day in the crockpot on low.  Turned out great!

This is very much like my usual recipe.  I do soak my beans overnight.  I add a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatos and a couple of fresh sage leaves (julienned) about an hour before serving.  Bean soup with sage is a natural combination.  But the big difference is that I make ham stock (just like chicken stock, but with a ham bone).  Skim the fat off before freezing, and keep it in the freezer for just such a recipe.  That way I can omit the stringy, fatty bits in the soup.  I add ham back into the soup so I can control bits of fat.  I sometimes add a bit of dry white wine (1/2 cup) at the end, if I feel like it.  Gives a nice boost of flavor.

My husband and I loved every spoonful of this awesome, awesome, awesome soup! I used smoked turkey meat because I didn't have a ham bone, and omitted the diced ham since the smoked turkey meat was enough. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of onion powder (didn't have a fresh onion) and used 3 bay leaves instead of just one. Because this recipe is such a terific base for a variety of bean soups, the changes I made still resulted in an outstanding soup. We'll enjoy this soup many times this winter.

Great recipe, especially after it sits a day.  I added a little minced garlic and a little more water.  I have always liked drop noodles in my thick soups, so I added some when the soup was almost done.  I  don't really have a recipe for drop noodles, because I just throw them together, but if you ever made noodles from scratch, I am sure you could use that recipe. But, after you make the dough, instead of rolling it out and cutting into noodle strips, you just take the ball of dough and use a teaspoon to cut off little peices of dough and drop them into the soup.  They cook almost instantly, but I usually wait and let them boil for 5 to 10 minutes. They float when they are done.

This was the first time I made beans and it was really great! I omitted the carrots and celery (not much a fan of either) and added a little brown sugar and liquid smoke. I will definately be making this again!

We always scoop out a cup of beans and mash them and then re-introduce to soup (well, hello there, beans), this extra thickening makes it uber-delicious.  And if you grew up poor, like we did, you will put a big fat slice of bread in the bowl before you pour in the soup.  None of us starved!

My mom grew up in WV and this recipe is authentic. Make sure to rinse the beans after they soak! Don't add the salt 'til the end, you may not want it. I used 4 cups no salt added chicken stock and 3 cups water. You *have* to serve this soup with cornbread (I bake mine in a cast iron skillet), and you can use ham hocks if you don't have a bone. :) Don't forget to mash some soup up against the side of the pot.

WOW!  This is truly a sensational soup!  I had left over ham with the bone in the freezer and have always wanted to try a bean soup and I'm glad I chose this one!  The recipe is really easy to follow.  I soaked my beans over night and washed them in baking soda before cooking them.  I added 8 cups of water with 4 cups of chicken broth.  I also added 3 potatoes and finely chopped the onions and the celery because the kids will eat them only if they can't really see them.  Having soaked the beans overnight, they cooked quicker so next time I won't cook for so long.  I pureed the potatoes to make the soup a little thicker and added my carrots towards the end because I don't like them mushy.  I also added about a tablespoon of pureed jalapenos for a little kick.  No ketchup or other spices needed for me! Served with a crusty Italian bread and delish!

I used someone else's suggestion of the boiling & baking soda thing.  I then put everything in a crock pot and set it in the fridge overnight.  I cooked it on low for about 10 hours.  I filled about half my blender with the soup and blended to make the broth thicker.  This was really good and the first time I've EVER gotten bean soup to work for me.  Next time though I'll add the ham at the end and add a bit of salt (I didn't add mucg salt for fear it would be too salty with the ham and the ham bone).  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very tasty soup and a great way to use the leftover ham.  I added more vegetables as the amount was not ample.  My son asked for the recipe since they too thought it was delicious.   The simplicity of the recipe is because all the ingredients have their own wonderful flavor, good for anytime.

I thought this recipe had great flavor.  Next time I make I would probably omit the cubed ham as I didn't think it really need it, got enough ham scraps and taste from the ham bone.

good soup,  One thing my mom always did at the end and her mom too was add a little vinegar.  It added a lot of flavor.

Followed ingredients as provided but used chicken broth instead of water and used crock pot. EXCELLENT and EASY! Soaked beans overnight. Cooked in crock pot for 4 hours and soup was done by lunch. Soaking is not necessary if you can cook in crock pot longer. Boyfriend said this was a "10". Cooked this for the 2nd time last night. Cooked in crock pot on high and did not soak beans. Soup was done in 5 hours.

This Bean Soup recipe is da-bomb!  I took the advice of Barb Maxwell, the Appalachian Kid and boiled the beans hard for 10 minutes followed by the baking soda to reduce gas.  Will try this out on the boys tonight and see if it works.  The better the ham bone, the better the soup.  Honey Baked ones always turn out best.  I added some thyme, garlic and Cumin, + a can of diced tomatoes. Delish!

So very good....made this in the crockpot with a leftover ham bone and a bag of navy beans that had soaked overnight. So warm and filling...as this cooks, the beans thicken the soup and slightly break down. Hearty and perfect on a cold day. And very easy to make. Thanks!

I have made a similar recipe for navy bean soup, however I never heard of the baking soda method and I'm eager to try it.  I would state that it is a good idea to "test" the ham before you put it in the recipe.  Some hams have more salt than others. If your ham is salty, cut back on the table salt in the recipe or use water as stated in this recipe.  If it's rather bland, use chicken broth/stock before adding table salt, it will add more flavor.  Another tip...if you would like to refrain from using pork products for this recipe, I suggest using smoked turkey legs in place of the ham bone and ham meat.  You may want to use chicken broth in place of water though since most smoked turkey legs have half the salt of ham bones or ham hocks.

Barb Maxwell, you are a genius!  I have never, EVER had any luck cooking with dried beans, but that baking soda trick works!  DH loves Campbell's Bean & Bacon soup, and this is very close (personally, I thought it was better, but maybe that's because I made it...?).  I added a couple cubes of chicken broth to up the flavor.  Yum!!!

Minus 10 in Minnesota - thumbs down. This recipe - thumbs up! We followed the recipe as written with the exception of using a carton of chicken broth in place of 4 cups of water. Delicious - simple and elegant. Thank you Pat Keene.

This soup needs a ham base or chicken base for fuller flavor. Once added we liked this soup very much. I also have never soaked beans. I put everything in the pot to a boil then lower heat to simmer and cook for about 2 1/2 hours. Great on a cold winters day!

I made just as the recipe stated and my dad loved it. He had been bugging me to try and make bean soup for months. This was a simple recipe. I found it a bit salty and will be adding another bag of beans and more water to the leftovers but that was the ham and not the recipe as other then the salt on the ham I didn't add any. I did end up using a good bit of black pepper though.

great base recipe!  I had a ham bone to use, which I'd never done before, but the only beans on hand were red beans & kidney beans.  I used red beans and it still turned out delicious.  Kinda reminded me of the ol' campbells bean'n bacon soup, texture-wise.  Better the 2nd day!  Otherwise, kept spices the same and found it plenty salty with just the ham!

This soup is GOOOOD!!  I didn't make the soup with the soaking water, rather replaced it with fresh cold water.  I threw the carrots, onions, bay leaf and celery in at the beginning, added a few peppercorns and another tsp of salt, then cooked for 1 1/2 hours.  Also added a couple tablespoons of instant brown rice at the end, just to thicken it up a bit.  This will be good tomorrow when the temp outside is a high of 20 degrees!!  Thanks!!

Very simple with beautiful flavor. Like other reviewers, I used chicken broth and increased veggies from half to a full cup. I also used a total of 5 bay leaves, added thyme, and a pinch of savory. I did not have a ham bone, so I just threw in two strips of uncooked bacon for the flavor and fat. (I did use the diced ham.) I omitted the salt since it was in the broth. I threw everything in the pot brought it to a boil for 10 minutes and then low simmer for 1 hour with lid on. After, I took the lid off and let it cook down for added flavor for another 30 mins. Oh before I forget, I just soaked the beans overnight.

We really liked this recipe.  I cooked mine in a slow cooker for about 6 hours on low and an hour before serving it, I used a potato masher to mash half the beans to make it thicker.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe base.  I used a variety of beans and instead of ham bones I used smoked turkey wings which gave the same smoked effect.  Also added 2 sprigs of thyme leaves.  Also, instead of water I used two quarts of chicken broth.

I'm so happy I took a look at the Custom Version saved by "IAFoodie". I have used their method several times and skipping the overnight soak is such a time saver and it really does work. The soup is perfect every time! I skip the vegetables and always use the leftover ham/bone from the Honey Baked Ham we serve on Holidays. Just add a lot of black pepper and everyone here loves it (even the kids!).

I have used this recipe for years and here's what I do to enhance the flavor.  I always buy 1 pound of kielbasa and cut into small pieces and add to the soup.  I also use 2 cups of chicken stock in exchange for some of the water needed.  Try it.  It's DELICIOUS

I thought this was wonderful, however, I did replace 1/2 the water with chicken stock.  I also mashed some of the soup with a potato masher to thicken it a bit.  Very good!!

I have made this soup a couple of times now and almost everyone always loves it. I only gave it 4* because I changed a few things: used 5 cups chicken broth and enough water to cover beans, used mixture of Great Northern, Pinto and Kidney beans (soaked overnight); omitted the salt and onions, used 2 cups each carrots and celery, added 1 can diced tomatoes, added 2 T. of minced garlic, 1 tsp. of liquid smoke and 2 bay leaves. I also just threw everything in the pot, brought it to a boil over medium heat, reduced the heat and simmered for 6 hours. Right before serving I stirred in about 1/2 cup instant potato flakes to thicken it up a bit. With these changes its a great soup. Also keeps well. Thanks for posting and to all the other reviewers for their suggestions.

I have been making this soup for years now, and it always turns out great. I think this is the best bean soup recipe I've ever found. I always add some extra carrots because I love carrots. I use the baking soda method suggested in a review by Barb Maxwell, and did not add the salt the recipe called for because other reviewers suggested that the baking soda added too much sodium. Sometimes I use a ham bone, and sometimes I get ham hocks. Both work well.

This is a hearty soup and a great place for a leftover ham bone. We like our soup a little thicker. My only suggestion is to use an addition 1/2 cup of beans, puree them in a food processor and add back to the stock at the end.  Yummmmmmmmmmm !

I made this soup last year for our family Christmas party with some beer bread, which you can also find on this site (Beer Bread 1 to be exact).  I did soak the beans overnight rather for the hour the recipe calls for.  I also doubled the recipe to feed everyone.  It was a big hit.  Definitely what you expect a bean soup to taste like!

I made this soup with the leftover ham bone from Christmas.  I will do this every year!  It was so simple and exactly what I was aiming for, a copy of the soup I order at the Coney Island Restaurant!

Very tasty, my kids and husband loved it. Used the soda method, and it worked like a charm. A little watery, will thicken it up next time.

An excellant recipe! The same one i had for years and lost. Upon seeing it it brought it all back. The best! I did change a little though. Used 10 cups water and added an extra ham hock and bay leaf. Full of flavor!

I'm sorry to say this was a very time-consuming recipe that was definitely not worth the time and effort. I really thought it would taste like my mom's cooking as I remembered her making this dish and loving it as a kid. Not so. I used a nice big hambone and followed the directions carefully. The result was bland, bland, bland. Fortunately my husband will eat anything, so leftovers got frozen and he ate them for lunch. I won't make it again because I don't have a clue how to make it better.

I thought it was great. I only changed a few things since I have been on a diet and didn't want the extra fat from the ham bone. 
1. I used lean ham steaks and cubed them.
2. I used pearl onions for their flavor.
3. The last thing I did was a 1/4 cup of diced Hatch chili's, 1/2 Hot and 1/2 mild.
My version of Pat's Soup is still a work in progress. Thanks Pat

Tasted much better after a night in the fridge... Immedately after cooking it was a bit bland, but the flavors mixed together nicely after a little rest time in the ice box.

This is one of my favorite soup recipes!  The only ingredient I modified is the salt.  The ham and ham bone add enough saltiness for my taste.

You must add other spices to give this soup any flavor.   I added some garlic, chicken broth, and thyme as well as a couple potato's to thicken it up or it is runny.  Just cut up a big potato  (I sliced one in half) and put it in until it was soft.  I took it out mashed it up and put it back in did the trick to make the soup thicker.  Without the additional spices it didnt taste like anything.  It also needed more carrots and celery.

This has been my basic recipe for 50 years and came from my southern cooking grandmother.  The only additions to this recipe are two heaping tablespoons of minced garlic, 1 each of beef and chicken bouillon cubes and a touch of cajun seasoning.  I soak the beans about 4 hours with the hock, bay leaf and bouillon then add the onion and carrot (1) before putting the heat under the pressure cooker.  30 min at 15# then into a crock pot for 4 hours.  While very hot I add two big tablespoons of instant potatoes for thickening and a touch of potato flavor.  Yum Yum.

Very healthy and very good. I left out te ham. I added a package of frozen spinach. And I used vegetable stock instead of water. I doubled the carrots and celery. I still feel like it was missing something. But adding the spinach was a big improvement. Next time I may add a can of tomato paste....

I used some chicken base in the water as others had said broth made it better, and wound up adding a bit more water and carrots and celery.  I got a ham bone from Honey Baked Ham and the soup was great!  Definitely the best white bean soup I've ever made!

I gave it 5 stars even though I modified original recipe by using chicken broth instead of water and just one smoked ham shank instead of the ham bone/diced ham because it turned out just absolutely fantastic!  I did use immersion blender slightly to thicken soup up.  Really really yummy on a cold night.  Used bread to wipe bowl clean yummy.

Wonderful soup!  I substituted 3 Cups of beef broth for 3 Cups of the water.  Also used two pork hocks in place of the ham bone because I didn't have one of those.  Also put in 1/4 cup ketsup as suggested by one of the reviewers.  We will make this again for sure!

I took some of the other reviewer's suggestions and doubled the veggies, pureed some of the beans and added them back in after they were cooked and did not use the bay leaf.  I used 4 cups chicken broth and then 3 cups water and I think it came out pretty good!

My only problem was that I soaked the beans overnight, then cooked them all day on low in the crockpot and they still were not done in time for dinner.  We had to cook them on high for several hours and then put them back in on low the next day and on the second day they were finally done.  I think next time I'd either start off cooking them on high and then switch over to low or use the baking soda method others used.

This soup was excellent, although it took longer to cook than suggested.  May have been because I used slightly larger beans than navy beans.  Should have used "small white beans" b/c I couldn't find Navy beans in the store I stopped at.  I used the ham from "Slow Cooker Ham" on this site.  Wonderful.  My dad also added a bit of cabbage to his soup when he made it to thicken it up a bit, and it was excellent as well.  I also used 6 cups of chicken broth and one cup of water.

My mom made this a year ago so I followed suit.  I now have my 2nd pot of it on the stove.  Although the ingredients appear simple, the taste is superb! If you like a thicker consistency, try using a potato masher to mash some of the soup to thicken.  I also add a pinch of sugar, salt & pepper to taste and a dash of liquid smoke.  Enjoy!

Ham and bean soup was something my mother always made when I was growing up. Since moving out, I've missed things like the smell of her cooking. But since we're so health conscious, and don't eat pork, I tried things a little different. Chicken thigh meat instead if ham, low sodium, and fresh bell peppers. Red pepper flakes are delicious too if you like it spicy!

The beans turned out wonderful.  I followed the recipe for the most part but I made some modifications.  I did 4 cups water and 4 cups chicken broth.  I doubled the veggies...but I also added some additional seasoning (along with what was added already) to zest it up a little.  I added 1 can of diced tomatoes (Italian style), 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp garlic pepper and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  It was delicious.  All 4 of my kids loved it.  Serve with warm corn bread!

This was just like mom used to make. Well, with a few minor tweaks. I did drain and rinse the beans first.. I didn't need all that ham, just the ham off the bone. I added canned tomatoes that I had chopped finely WITH the juice. I also added one clove of garlic, and a lot more pepper, and just a touch of cayenne pepper, touch of ground cloves, and I used chicken broth I had left over for half the liquid. It's cooking now and I'm thinking about adding some thyme too!!  Very good starter recipe to add your special touch to.

I had to take some beans out to fit everything in my pan, but it seemed like a better amount anyways.  Everything else was on par with the recipe and it was great.  I soaked my beans over night out of convenience.  Will make again!

This soup tasted wonderful.  I will definately use this recipe again.  I used a slow cook method, (after the overnight bean soaking.) I also replaced half of the water with chicken broth and added a little garlic, but didnt use a bay leaf.  Excellent !

I was looking for a way to use a very meaty hambone that didn't include split peas and found this recipe.  It was easy and very good.  I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and stirred baking soda into the beans.  That's a neat trick, thanks! A very flavorful soup that re-heats well.  I think I will serve it with corn bread next time.  Now there's a rib-sticking meal. Thanks again!

I followed the directions except pureed some beans at the end and added 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup brown sugar as other suggested.  Oh - and doubled the veggies.  Was really good, will definately make again.  **UPDATE 3/23/09 - this soup has become a staple in our house.  I follow step #1, then throw everything in the crock pot (either on low or high depending on how much time I have).  I have used bacon or sausage instead of the ham omitting the ham hock and it turns out great.  I am making it again today!

This was excellent and filling.  I did add chicken broth instead of water, and I let it cook longer at a low heat.

I tried this recipe and I am sure it would have been fantastic but...I tried another reviewers tip and added the baking soda to the beans after they boiled. I thought I followed the directions but I dont think I rinsed the beans well enough after adding the baking soda. My soup turned out extremely salty!  It ruined it. I think this was my mistake so rinse rinse and rinse again so you dont make the same mistake I did and ruin a good pot of soup!!

I did a few different things.  I did the baking soda trick summited by barb maxwell, and no bay leaf, and added garlic powder.  I alos added potatoes alone with the celery and carrots and put it all in the slow cooker on low for 8 to 10 hours. Adding the veggies about 1 hour before serving.  My family could not get enough of it.  It was great.

I really liked this soup. Served with some warm cornbread, it makes a satisfying meal on a cold winter night!

Great taste! I added cubed potatoes, 1/4 cup tomato sauce and spinach. The family liked it. The perfect meal with homesteader cornbread.

The 2nd time I made this recipe, I used a mixture of red kidney beans & black eyed peas. I also added 1 tsp of cumin powder & 2 tbsp of chicken bouillon powder. This was made in the crock pot. This is now my favorite bean soup recipe.

This was delicious! I was looking for a recipe for bean soup that I had at a restaurant that was awesome- and this was very close! The only thing I changed was the bay leaf- I did not have one so I left it out and couldn't tell the difference. I also made this in the crockpot and cooked it on low for 12 hours. Very delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I only had canned Navy beans so I pureed half of them and kept the other half whole. I then stirred them into the soup after I removed the bone. I really enjoyed this recipe. It's a nice light and tasty way to use my left over ham. Thanks!

I used a 20 pkg. of mixed beans, used the baking soda tip and 6 cans low sodium chicken broth  along with 1 cup water.  Still was a bit salty, but everyone loved it.  My first attempt at home made soup!

it was great - i thought the texture was nice and thick.  will make again when i have a ham bone but will not add the called upon salt (seemed just a little salty).  the ham seemed to salt it up enough.  I did add extra carrots and celery and ham.  As someelse recommended here, i served it with cornbread - what a great meal and just as good on day 2.  next time i have a ham bone, i will double the recipe.

This is such a great "traditional" bean soup.  I used the baking soda quick soak method mentioned by a previous user (it worked like a charm) and added ketchup for color, texture, and a little flavor.

Cooked beans as stated in review dated 5/23/05.  Omitted salt, ham bone, and used turkey ham---didn't want it to become too salty for my liking (I always omit salt from recipes).  Light & flavourful.  Not 'heavy' so would probably be good for 'soup before entree,' and has pleasant flavours for a very basic, and simple soup.

Very good.  I soaked the beans with the ham bone.  I also used red beans because that is what I had in the house.  I also seasoned with whole cloves and ginger.  Yummy.  Will make again.

Yowzie, this is a keeper! I made it almost exactly as the recipe states except that I added everything to the beans at the same time. I am hanging my head in shame, but I had thrown out the ham bone before I decided to make this. The ham itself gave it lots of flavour though. I had not presoaked the beans overnight so I did the quick soak thing. They did not soften enough, so I simmered the soup all evening (adding a few cups of chicken broth) and then we had it for dinner tonight. Worth the wait. Thank you!

Fantastic!  I substituted Northern White beans because my store did not have navy.  As others suggested, I used 4 C chicken broth with 3 C water, and I cooked in the slow cooker for 7 hours on low. Easy and delicious!

I make this every year  with leftover Easter ham.  I leave out the ham bone. I don't like the gamey, marrowey flavor it imparts. I just add diced leftover ham which lends a ton of flavor. You don't need to add any extra spices, except for the bay leaf, salt and pepper in the recipe. The ham has all the seasoning you need. I use all of the leftover meat from the ham, I don't measure. Towards the end of the cooking time I take a stick blender or potato masher and mash up a good 10-20% of the beans to give the broth a rich hearty flavor and texture.

I think this is a great recipe, but it definitely needs seasoning. I added parsley, basil, oregano, thyme (1 tsp. each) and 1/2 tsp. Coleman's mustard and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. I shredded the carrots and 2 potatoes as the potatoes thicken it up. When done, 30 minutes before serving, I added 2/3 cup sour cream. Yum! 

The other thing that I changed were the beans. I had several half-bags of different beans, (kidney, navy, pinto and another small bag of mixed, dry veggies/beans) and it was fabulous!

Oh yes, someone mentioned using soda, which works great, too, but my grandma used to put salt in her beans when she soaked them overnight. It was the easiest way to ALWAYS get the beans done properly, as sometimes the skin seemed tough. Amazing what 3 tsp. of salt added to the cold water did.

I didn't modify this other than using chicken broth instead of water (didn't add any extra salt then), and I used the fast boil/baking soda method to shorten the cook time.  My 3-year-old had thirds!  This is the one who doesn't even eat dinner usually!  I thought it was super easy and tasty.  Will be making again!

This is great just the way it is written!  My preference is a country or Smithfield ham bone/meat, but realize that they are not available everywhere.  To put some of the ingredients that others suggest, ketchup, brown sugar, liquid smoke, etc., you must be kidding or from western PA like my husband who puts ketchup on everything.  Please rate a recipe as written or post your own version as a separate recipe.  Being a southern girl, this is the way to prepare navy bean soup!

This is a great recipe very similar to what my mom made while growing up.  I would never use chicken stock or add tomatoes, however when eating a bowl add a teaspoon or two of malt vinegar, homemade garlic bread on the side makes a great meal.

Very good!  This was my first time using my leftover ham bone from Christmas dinner and soaking the dried beans as well.  I used great northern beans and it turned out fabulously!  I would not add any salt next time as it was plenty salty due to the ham.  Also used some Swason's Flavor Booster and that probably increased the saltiness as well.

After years of searching for a great bean soup recipe, I've finally found it!  The first time I made this, I used diced ham.  It was good, but the second time I made it, I used 4 slices of bacon instead.  That's the one I prefer.  I put the bacon in raw and took out the large pieces when it was done cooking.  I also added just a touch of brown sugar.  I put everything in the crock pot on high (about 4 hours for navy beans and 5-6 hours for great northern beans), and didn't need to soak or precook the beans at all.  If the beans start looking dry, just add a little more water and they'll be fine.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Used mixed beans, 2 bay leaves, and a dash of savory. Kept everything else the same. It was very good!

I have been bean soup impaired for many years til I found this.  I used the trick with the baking soda.  I did cook this longer.

This was great bean soup.  Our Church did a pig roast last weekend and I used one of the ham bones for the soup.  I also added some of the left over pulled pork in addition to ham cubed.  It turned out great.  I did double the recipe to make a larger pot.  Excellent over all.  Thanks.

This soup came out good although I think It needed some kind of tomato product. After if was done I ended added a small can of tomato sauce because that was what I had on hand.

This tastes like what my grandma used to make! I substituted chicken broth for the water, did not add the salt, and cooked it all in the crockpot for 8 hours. 1/2 hour before serving, I pulled out a cup of soup and blended it, then added it to the crockpot to thicken.

A great soup ! I omitted the celery, added some fresh sage and mashed the finished soup with a potato masher so that the crushed beans thickened the final product. Kept really well in the fridge and tasted even better after a couple of days.

This turned out great. Just like MUSIC_MINX, I boiled the navy beans twice and discarded the water. Also, I used a ham hock, since I reduced the serving size to 4. I’ll be making this again. Beans are so good for you! Thanks for the recipe, Pat.

I know it's "bean" soup but I thought there were too many beans in it.  Or not enough other stuff.  I would definately double the vegies.  Otherwise good.

This soup turned out very flavorful. I did replace about half the water with vegetable broth. I also added a little dry mustard, marjoram and fresh thyme.  My boyfriend kept raving about the soup.  I definitely need to make this again soon!

Doubled the recipe for this soup, which was very good.  Kinda messed up my measurements which mostly went by my taste.  Had a huge hambone with lots of meat, tried the baking soda trick, that was cool!  Doubled up the veggies and added no salt, just boullion powder to taste and pepper.  I made the extra to freeze for lazy days.  I wouldn't have minded some tomatoes or tomato sauce but loved this soup.  Served with beer bread from this site.  Nice wintertime meal.

I've never had bean soup with carrots and celery, however, most of the recipes called for it, so it must be a normal thing to do :)  I took suggestions from the previous two reviewers and did the baking soda soak method and added ketchup to the soup.  The baking soda method worked perfectly.  I've always added ketchup to my bowl of bean soup and hadn't thought about just putting it in the pan!  The color was more orange than rich, due to the carrots... but very good none the less.  This one is a keeper!

Excellent Recipe to START with.  I needed a lot (4 Tb more) of salt than called for.  I also added 1 1/2 Tb of ground Corriander to add a sweet wonderful flavor to it.  Note:  if you're trying to cut down on the fat grams, make sure you take out the bone after 1 1/2 hours to cut off excess fat.

This was fantastic!  It smelled so good while it was cooking.  Great to make on a cold Winter day. I diced the carrots and left out the celery (I just don't like it)  added a dash or 2 of liquid smoke,  Served it with Cornbread. Will make this again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Hubby loved this.  I soaked the beans overnight and discarded the water.  I used 3 bay leaves as suggested and a lot more carots, celery and onions. More water also.  I also added pasta.  Very good. I usually make split pea with the left over ham bone.  This was a nice change.

I had memories of flavorless bean soup made by friends and family when I was a child.  My husband loves it, so I used this recipe to make it.  It is delicious!  I changed the water after initially cooking the beans and used 8 cups of water.  I put in 4 bay leaves and added the onion, carrots and celery right away.  Cooked until it was done and then stored in the refrigerator over night for dinner the next day. No need to thicken it. I'll definately be making this again!

I didn't have a bay leaf and my local market had carrots that looked like they had been there for two months, so I left out those ingredients and added extra onions and celery. I also added a bit more water than the recipe called for. Still, it was the best bean soup I have ever eaten. My hubby loved it too!

It turned out great! I used some suggestions for flavour and baking soda to help remove gas from the beans, also changed the water and used homemade vegetable bullion, minced an entire onion, added 2 garlic cloves.
Will make again

It was amazing! Like Campbell’s bean and bacon soup. I made it in the crockpot. It soaked all night and cooked all day on low. Salt to taste. Turned out great

Great for beginners! I made a lot of changes (adding Worcestershire and garlic) and it was awesome. Thank you. (Had a bunch of beans from the food bank but don't like beans lol)

Have this soup for years but I don't add carrots or celery as the grands don't like them. Never use broth or stock. Add lots of pepper and garlic of course some salt. Don't soak beans just start first thing on the morning and let it cook all day. Very good with corn bread!

This is an excellent copy of my Grandmothers bean soup. Very simple and easy. You may have to adjust the amount of salt depending on the saltiness of the ham your using.

I made a few changes in this recipe.
First of all I used 4 large ham hocks that were smoked. I simmered the ham hocks in 8 cups water with two bay leaves for 3 hours. In another pot I boiled the beans two packages for 10 minutes and then repeated the process one more time , draining each time. After removing the ham from the ham hocks I also added more ham that I had in the freezer from a previous ham that I had cooked. Add your miraqua and the ham to the pot that you cook the ham hocks in then add chicken stock. You will find that there is more flavor in your broth and your bean soup will taste wonderful. Salt and pepper to taste.

I used pinto beans,"all I had"and a ham bone and drippings from when I heated the ham.Added about 3/4 lb. ham pieces 1 cup carrots,1 cup celery,1/2 onion. 2 bay leafs and 1  cup v8 was a little thin so mashed up a 1/3 cup of the beans. Season to taste. Will make it agin the same way. I do not soak my beans. I rinse them in cold water and then just simmer until tender that's when you add the v8. every thing else all goes in the pool right away.

Excellent!! Only change I made was using stock instead of broth. I also thought it had too many beans for our liking, so I took out about a third of them, otherwise, made as written. Hubby even loved it and he's picky! Thank you for a great recipe for January!

I read previous reviews andI boiled the beans for 10 minutes, took to the sink, added a handful of baking soda and stirred. I rinsed the beans thoroughly, added a quart of chicken broth, increased the vegetables to 1 cup and added a chopped clove of garlic. When done, I puréed 1 cup of the beans and added 1/4 cup of ketchup. Superb, especially served with a little cheddar jack on top!

I used Barb Maxwell's "Appalachian" advice with the baking soda... that was excellent. I used 3 small ham steaks from a  butcher and just the bones from those steaks. I trimmed most of the fat but each steak had a rim of "rind" which i threw in while cooking. I used half water and half chicken stock. In the end I probably had more like 3+ cups of ham in it overall This is a very flexible recipe. The pot is still on the stove and I think it's excellent but will probably be even better tomorrow!

When I was making this recipe I was a little unsure if it would have enough flavour, boy was I wrong. The first night we made it we ended up not cooking it long enough. The next night we cooked it more until the meat fell off the bone. Sooo good.

This was a basic Bean Soup Recipe that we just loved. I used chicken broth instead of water. I put a little more ham it in than specified. I agree with others - it's even better the next day. When I make it again, I'll double the recipe and freeze what's left. I will make it again!

Best Navy Bean Soup ever. My husband made this soup this AM after soaking the beans in water over night. He dumped that water out, then covered the beans with fresh water, boiled them and then rinsed them with cold water, doing this twice. This is to cut down on the gas that beans produces, especially at our Denver altitude of 5280 ft. He then made the recipe as stated but did use a ham bone and 4 cups chicken broth and 3 cups water. All was put in a crock pot on High for about 8 hours. Again that is because to cook dried beans here, they have to cook longer so adjust your time and temp. This is without a doubt the best recipe we have tried or eaten. Thanks so much for this great recipe.

This Ham and Bean soup recipe is wonderful! I made it as is and it was so good, I made it again a couple of days later!

I wish I had had the beans called for in the recipe because I know it would have been even better. It was really good, but I had to use black beans and pintos because that was what i had. Instead of water I used chicken stock. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I will make this again sometime after a trip to the grocery.

This should come with a warning"Highly addictive". I use a 16 bean mix, did the suggested boil twice and let sit for an hour and added chicken base to the water.

This soup was so good. I did what another person here stated, and i added about two tablespoons, or less, of flour and it thickened it up some. I should have mixed the flour with some water or something, because, at first, the flour created some lumps that i had to try to break them up. I added two ham hocks, and i usually make more than the recipe calls for. Very yummy! Thank you so much for this hearty, healthy recipe!! And thanks to all recipes dot com for teaching me how to cook. If it wasn't for all of the ratings and tips for each recipe, i would be lost.

Great recipe! The better one on here as far as 'soup beans' go. I did change the recipe a little. I tend to slow cook and the style of ham as well as the way it's made makes a difference. I used celery salt instead of celery and no carrots. I cooked over 4 pounds of beans so I used a whole yellow onion. I even diced pineapples from the ham and added them to the mix. Talk about feeding an Army. Love it! GREAT JOB!!

To the base recipe I substituted low-sodium chicken stock for half of the water, added one large clove of garlic, crushed and one 14.5 oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes. I also like a little vinegar in my bean soup as well as a little heat, so I added a bit of hot sauce. It turned out great and had several layers of flavor. Will definitely make again.

Great tasting soup, but I made a few modifications. First, I used canned Northern Beans, not dry, to save some time. I boiled and simmered the ham bone alone in the broth for 30 minutes. Then I added everything to it, all veggies at the same time, and added one clove of garlic. Boiled and simmered everything together for another 30 minutes. Comes out tasting great.

To those that say it was bland, a good quality ham makes a big difference. I smoked mine and my soup was outstanding. I also ignored the bay leaf and used more ham than it called for.

I'm very happy with it. I pretty much just used this recipe as a guide. For the beans, I just used what I had, which was Pinto. Instead of using hamhocks in it, I just put some bouillon cubes (I put no meat in this soup). Since my boyfriend doesn't like celery, I substituted with some potatoes. I'll probably continue to use different things and adjust to my liking.

Loved this soup!  I used chicken broth, added a can of crushed tomatoes and garlic.  I also fried bacon with the vegetables.  Than made a roue(equal parts butter and flour) to thicken.  It was incredible!

We really loved this recipe. I fixed it as written except I used less beans and substituted half the water for chicken broth b/c I Did NOT use the bone. I cooked it in my new electric pressure cooker which i love. Just put it all in, program it, and it comes out perfect every time. Such an easy way to cook dried beans! Will be fixing again but will use the full bag of beans as written next time!

After cooking the beans, added a few cups of chicken broth as there was not enough liquid.  Adding pepper as I served it made it perfect!  This is definitely a go to recipe!

I let my beans soak overnight instead.  And I add two ham hocks instead of one because that is the only way I can buy them around where I live and it turns out great each time.

This is an excellent recipe - I added bits of bacon in addition to the ham (if it is handy). This is the first time I tried a recipe with veggies. Also and since my family likes the thicker soup I add the water, boil them down, add the water and boil them down the second time.  A favorite at our house.

Yummy! Used four cans of rinsed white beans instead of dry and an reserved ham bone. Added extra carrots, another bay leaf and three Yukon Gold potatoes diced small. Used a combination of chicken stock and water and added extra ham since my hambone did not have enough meat on it.

A great "comfort food" kind of soup!  I did increase the veggies and added about 0.5 tsp cayenne pepper for zip.  We loved it and will definitely be making it again.

This was good and easy.  My husband ate most of it in two days.  He likes it with some tabasco sauce (pretty tasty).
