I made this for an elderly Swedish gentlman that I do caretaking for.  He loved it and with his background he knows good pastries!  He said it was the best!! 
I personally loved the crust.  The almond paste can be a little tricky to locate and expensive, but it really enhances!

Holy smokes this was a good recipe!  I wish the site would correct the spelling as this was a marzipan cake (not mazarin) and I almost didn't find it, but it was well worth the search.
