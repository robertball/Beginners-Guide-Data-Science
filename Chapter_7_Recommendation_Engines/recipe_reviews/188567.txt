I've made this twice and discovered two very important parts of the recipe that you can *not* overlook:  1) Use fresh strawberries or your own frozen. Commercially frozen doesn't interact as well with the Jello for some reason. 2) MASH the strawberries.  The juice has to be released or there's nothing to break down the gelatin and you get a very unpleasant texture on the top of your cake.  If your strawberries aren't very juicy, sprinkle a little sugar on them before mashing and let them set for an hour or so - the juice will come out.  The cake by itself is pretty, but it does need whipped cream or ice cream (heat the cake up slightly) to finish it off for eating.

OK, first of all. OMG, this cake was SO good. I just got done making it, not only is it freakin' gorgeous as it is fresh out of the oven, it -tastes- amazing. It's moist and delicious. The jello trickling throughout the cake was awesome. I'm totally in love with this recipe. It's incredibly simple too! I made a few changes ONLY and only because I really wanted to try this and didn't have exactly what you called for. I replaced your strawberries with frozen (thawed) strawberry slices I had on hand. I also didn't have strawberry jello, I used what I did have; Raspberry. I love how this cake has marshmallows in it. I wasn't sure how that was going to turn out but as it is, it adds crunch when you're not expecting it. Sooooo yummy. This cake was again, super easy to make and loads of fun. Each step from placing the strawberries to pouring the cake batter was neat. I smiled the whole time in excitement to try this cake. I just had the first piece and I give you 5 stars.  :) Thank you for sharing this with the world.

Wonderful!  I add about a cup extra of mini marshmallows, cut the cake in half and stack it to make a "layer" cake, then spread whipped cream around the sides.  We've made this four times over the past month, and people have raved about it every time.

This cake is awesome!!! I've made it twice now. The first time I made it it was for my boyfriends Mom's birthday!!! Talk about pressure!!! I made backup cupcakes in case the cake didn't turn out well. NO ONE TOUCHED THE CUPCAKES! Everyone LOVED this cake! I made it exactly as directed and it was awesome. I used a non stick baking pan and made sure to let it cool for twenty minutes before turning over on to a serving dish. I served slightly warm with French Vanilla ice cream and today my boyfriend and his sister requested it for dessert and once again it was great! Thank You for the great and easy recipe!

Super delicious! I was surprised at how the marshmallows combine with the cake mix and you cant really tell they are in the ingredients once its cooked. I expected this to be overly sweet but it wasnt! I used fresh strawberries that I sliced into thin strips. Next time I will add more strawberries though, not enough for my tastes.

This cake turned out BEAUTIFULLY. This was my first attempt at an upside down cake and I am so pleased with the result. I made a chocolate ganache and dipped the extra strawberries in it for the side. Then I drizzled a thin amount of the ganache lightly over the cake. Thank you for the recipe; my family and I love it. I will be sure to make it again!

This was so easy, about as easy as it gets, and super delicious!  We liked this better than my regular strawberry shortcake recipe.  I followed the directions to a 'T' and it came out perfect.  I made this the night before and refrigerated overnight after inverting it onto a serving platter. My kids and husband as well as a few others said they could eat this everyday.  I want to experiment trying other berries.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful and easy recipe.

Took to a potluck and got lots of requests for the recipe. Easy to make, quick except for baking time, not to expensive. Will definetly make again and next time I may add a can of drained crushed or tidbit pineapple to the strawberries. I used a glass casserole dish and it stuck pretty good so I just left it in the dish and served with a large spoon, it looked yummy. Would be great served warm ala mode. YUM

Great recipe. Always get requests for the recipe. Theres room to modify and play around with the taste too. Play with the variation on jello flavors and fruit toppings! Delicious!

Great recipe -Delicious cake.  Made a few changes tho-  As many reviewers stated they did not like the artificial and occasionally overpowering flavor of the flavored jello.  I used 1/2 pkg of a 3 oz strawberry daiquiri jello and 1 full packet of UNFLAVORED gelatin.  This kept the natural flavor of the strawberries the prominent taste as opposed to artificial jello flavor.  I also sliced the strawberries after I tried mashing them.  I did not like the appearance as well as the sliced look.  I used egg beaters in the cake mix as well as swapped fat free mayo for the oil in order to eliminate fat and calories.  BEST TIP: place a DOUBLE layer of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan.  Let the cake cool completely in the refrigerator then turn the cake out of the pan.  Remove the parchment and--- viola! Perfect cake! I will make this again but without the marshmallows- I am not sure just why they are needed.  The cake is sweet and the strawberries have jello added - seems a little unnecessary and might make the cooking time more accurate if omitted.

I made this cake for "my Mother's Day" dessert and it was wonderful!  Since it was for a special occasion and the first time I tried the recipe, I did not try to turn it out of the pan. Nervous it wouldn't come out right. lol  Just chilled it and cut it and we topped it with aerosol can whipping cream. YUMMY! Will be making this cake many more times for special meals, since this family does not need the calories or sugar. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I made this in a such a hurry today while multi-tasking that I forgot to add the marshmallows atop the strawberries!  Next time, I'll try to get everything together before I start!  It was still delicious with a dollop of whipped topping though.    My personal notes...for fear of it sticking to the bottom of the pan, I did spray it first with cooking spray.  An entire carton of fresh strawberries yielded exactly the 2 c. after mashing.  I subbed B.C. Golden Vanilla cake mix for the Yellow and used only a SMALL (3 oz) box of gelatin.  That seemed to be plenty to me.   Will be making again soon... hopefully with the marshmallows!  Cool, delicious summer dessert, or any time.

UPDATE:  I made it again... this time WITH the marshmallows!  It was even more delicious!  The strawberry topping does tend to stick on the pan even after spraying it, but it is fairly easy to repair.  Maybe, next time I will try the Yellow cake mix, but I don't believe the "Golden Vanilla" can be beat.  Don't forget the whipped topping! Very easy, highly recommend.
UPDATE #2
I have made this cake 4 times in a month, last time using fresh blackberries and Blackberry Fusion jello....was just as delicious!  Thanks for a wonderful and simple dessert recipe!
UPDATE #3
The summertime fruits are abundant right now and I just can't stop making this cake!  I just finished one using fresh peaches and Peach Jello.  I sweetened them with a little sugar and added 1. of cinnamon before sprinkling on the Jello.

This cake was absolutely fantastic!  It was so easy to make...my daughter and I tag-teamed the prep and we put it all together in about three minutes.  I can see this becoming a summer staple here at home as well as my next potluck contribution at work.   I was a bit apprehensive about using frozen strawberries, but everything turned out just fine.  The only thing I did differently was to add a tablespoon of sugar to the berries during the mashing process as they were rather tart.  Perfect...the cake turned out not-too-sweet with the just the right amount of tartness.  Thank you so much, parealtor313.

I made this cake today for my Aunts birthday along with a Pineapple upside down cake... This thing went SO FAST! It was so good! I made no changes except I used a bunt pan. I was really afraid it would over flow and it almost did... too many strawberries but it was PERFECT! Awesome cake! Thank you!

This was a really interesting, fun recipe. I started to panic as I was sprinkling all that jello powder on my fresh strawberries. I almost stopped with half the packet but I wanted to follow the recipe so I forged ahead. I wasn't sure what it meant by crushed fresh strawberries. I started to mash them but that just looked like it would be a sloppy mess so I decided to very thinly slice my strawberries. The marshmallows basically disappear into the cake, you'd never guess there were three cups of marshmallow in there. I sprayed my glass pan with Pam, waited the five minutes to invert it and then had no problem with it sticking to the pan. It slid right out. When I served this cake warm, I couldn't get neat slices out of it, the top was too runny. However, after sitting in the frig overnight, I was then able to get neat slices and I thought it was definitely better the second day served cold and with whipped cream. My husband loved this and my strawberry-loving son and I both liked it but we agree that we like other fresh strawberries cake a little bit better. It's definitely good and worth a try. My criticism, I guess, is that I used a big carton of beautiful fresh strawberries and, after adding all that jello powder, the fresh strawberry taste is replaced somewhat by a slight artificial, jello-y taste. I'll make it again but I think I will try adding half the amount of jello and see what happens. Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy super delish cake!  I baked in 2- 9inch layer pans for 27 minutes and cooled for 15 minutes then ran a knife around the edges before removing from pan.  I had no problems with the cake sticking.  Thanks for the new family favorite!

Yummy in my Tummy!!! This was super easy and everyone loved it! I used fresh strawberries (sliced w/added sugar). I'm not a fan of marshmallows and wondered how they would affect the end product, but went ahead & followed the recipe. Couldn't even tell they were there! Which was fine, It tasted delicious! I made mine in a bundt pan and   baked for right at 50 minutes. When I poured the cake batter in, it was right up to the edge of the pan and I thought it would probably bake over (so added a cookie sheet underneath). To my surprise it didn't overflow at all! Once the strawberries & marshmallows cooked down, it was all fine. Also, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but I've had three pieces of this cake so far. Like I said, Yummy in my Tummy!

I was alittle disappointed in this cake...not enough strawberries, but perhaps I should have measured the strawberries after I crushed them not before?  Perhaps I will try again with more (or other fruit) and maybe even try a chocolate cake mix.  I was interested to see another similar recipe on this site with same ingredients but reversed directions (marshmallows on bottom of pan, cake mix in the middle and strawberries on top...and the cake reverses itself in the oven!)  Might try that too!

Very good cake!  I made homemade whipped cream to go with it, but I think it tasted good even without it.  I used 2 pounds of strawberries, smashed well.  Followed the directions exactly.  45 min of bake time in my oven.

I was a little scared about this recipe as I've never heard of putting in gelatin and marshmallows in a cake. I used a springform  pan so I could remove it easily. half way through baking the juices started coming out of the bottom! I would suggest putting a pan underneath to catch it all. also a little more then half way through it looked like it was done as it the cake was browned but the middle was pretty liquidity. i ended up taking it out thinking it was done then I figured out it wasn't and baked it for about another 20 mins. the cake turned out fantastic! I am defiantly going to be making this one all summer long. oh I have another recommendation, make this the day before and keep it in the fridge, in the pan. its better on the colder side:) and it will keep its shape when you serve it.

Had to try this during berry season.  So good & easy! I greased my glass baking dish very thoroughly.  Mashed berries with a little sugar and let them sit while I prepped everything & mixed cake (I used a Betty Crocker yellow cake mix)  I only used one box of gelatin as it looked to be enough when I sprinkled it over berries.  Skipped marshmallows - didn't have any & figured it would be too sweet for us.  Baked cake 40 min. cooled about 10 min.  Turned it over & it was beautiful!  Everyone raved and between 4 adults we ate more than half OINK!  Next time I will double up strawberries and gelatin for a thicker berry topping.  I like this better than our favorite short cake recipe -Thank you!!  Note: I made this a second time and sprinkled one-3 oz. strawberry jello over mashed berries and let that sit while I mixed up the cake.  Spread berry mixture in baking dish and sprinkled second 3 oz box jello over.  Topping came out even better than first time!

Very light and moist cake.  Served cold with lite cool whip.  Used sugar-free jello to reduce calories.  A big hit at family dinner on Mother's day.  I will make this again and again.  FYI 1# of strawberries = 2 cups crushed.  I pulsed them in the food processor to large chunks.  Very easy and fast dessert to make.

I did not like this at all. The crushed strawberries turn into jam in the oven. The jello and marshmallows don't do anything but make the cake too sweet. Not only was the entire cake too sweet, but it also does not look very presentable. I would not be proud bringing this to a party. I will never make this again.

This cake was so good! I used whole frozen strawberries which I thawed, quartered some, mashed some, and added a bit of sugar to draw out the excess water. I poured off about a 1/2 cup of the liquid, stirred in the jello and used only about 1/2 the marshmallows because I didn't think it would all fit into my bundt pan. I greased the pan heavily and used a drip pan to catch the drips which inevitably happened with so full a pan. The baking time was longer since I used a bundt pan (about 1 hour and 10 minutes at 350°) so I placed a sheet of foil over the top towards the end of the baking time to prevent over-browning. Once turned over it went straight into the fridge to set.  It turned out beautifully and held together just like a picture when served! FABULOUS!!!

I've made this a few times now and the latest for 4th of July.  I lightly sprayed a glass 13x9 pan with cooking spray.  Doubled the strawberries and used an egg slicer to help chop them up and mashed about half, then mixed with fat free strawberry jello before spreading on the bottom.  Instead of oil in the cake mix I used applesauce to cut some calories.  Then I served it with lite whipped topping and sprinkled with fresh blueberries.  This was my red white and blue dessert - fabulous!

I made this last night to use up some strawberries. I brought it to my husband's work straight out of the oven and it was completely gone before the pan even cooled. I'd call that a success! I don't usually care for box cakes but this recipe improved the taste tremendously. The only thing I changed was the flavor of Jello. I only had cherry on hand but I think it added a nice tartness that balanced perfectly will the sweet cake and ripe strawberries. The marshmallows added that chewy, crunchy edge and bottom. YUM! Will definitely make this again and play around with different flavor combos.

I was so excited to try this, but what a waste of perfectly good strawberries!  I knew as I poured all that super sweet gelatin mix over my gorgeous berries that something was just wrong.  Way, way tooo sweet and not pretty at all.  Made it for Memorial Day w/e picnic and everyone, including me, chose my friend's sweetened strawberries and home made poundcake over this mess. So sweet, tasted like strawberry preserves.  Not a keeper for us.  Sorry...

I was hesitant to make this cake after reading some of the reviews, but am glad I did go ahead and make it.  I had absolutely no problems with the cake at all.  I thought it had wonderful flavor, without whipped cream or ice cream.  My family actually preferred to eat it the next day after it chilled in the refrigerator.  I had no problems with the cake sticking to the pan, no problems cooking it, and it looked really pretty.  My cake looked just like the one in the picture!  Yummy!

This cake is even better than the 'better than sex' cake!!!!!!!  We used white cake instead of yellow, and only the pink mini marshmellows... after just one bite this cake moved to my all time favorites list.   Its fast simple and easy to make, and tastes GREAT.

This is a GREAT cake made as is. Next time making it use blackberries with blackberry jello or my absolute favorite is raspberries with raspberry jello. Tonight I'm going to try fresh yellow peaches and peach jello. This cake never fails and it is quick, easy and amazingly good!!

Yum! This really surprised me. I thought it might taste really artificial with that ingredient list, but everything came together and made quite the delicious dessert. Tastes great right out of the fridge; a perfect sweet for a BBQ. Thanks!

Unbelievable cake... I can't say enough good about this recipe.. The only thing I did different was use a Bundt pan, lightly crush 1 cup of FRESH strawberries and 2 cups of sliced FRESH strawberries. I also toss my strawberries in the jello  then spread in the bottom of a geased and floured Bundt pan.. I then followed as described in recipe.. Let cool for 20 minutes and poured out on serving plate... No sticking at all. Cake was BEAUTIFUL... I put in refrigerator for about 2 hours before serving.. Not on piece was left. My family is still talking about it.... YUMMY

This cake is amazing!I used freshed strawberries and after I chopped them up, I put them in a bowl and sprinkled a little sugar on them. To crush them, I used a small biscuit cutter and went to town. Worked great. I used big marshmallows and cut them into fours because that's all I had on hand. I baked into a bundt pan and the marshmallows float to the top and make an awesome crunch crust. I also used a 3 oz raspberry jell-o and French vanilla cake mix.

This is amazing!! I used strawberry/bannan sugar free geltin (by mistake-it was late), but it was great. I made the cake in a 9x13 pan and then cut it in half and stacked it. I put cool whip around the sides and it looked great. Everyone loved it!!

I made this in 2 8" round pans.  After cooling, I stacked them like a regular cake and "frosted" it with Cool Whip.  Very good, so fresh, and easy.  Making it again next week in large quantity for 60 people.

It lacked presentation and not pretty at all! We ate eat it so as not to waste the ingredients.I agree with one of the reviwers that it was a rubbery consistency due to the addition of the jello. It got soggy really quickly. It tasted like a boxed cake with cut up strawberries on it. I ended up putting some cool whip on it to dress it up a bit and added some nuts and fresh sliced strawberries on top to jazz it up a bit for presentation. To me, it is not worthy for company presentation. with so many other great recipes out there, I wouldn't bother with this one. I'm not sure why it got such outstanding reviews.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It looked and smelled excellent, the cake part baked very nicely.  The whole thing came out of the pan perfectly.  Too bad the stawberry part came out as a layer of rubber.  People ate their pieces, but no one wanted seconds.

So quick and easy! The small ingredient list makes it nice because all of these items are already stocked in the house. Nice to make at the last minute for company. I auctioned this off at the church bake sale last year and the highest bid was $32. Nobody even knew it was from a boxed cake mix!

I've had this recipe in my box for quite awhile anticipating it. I was disappointed. My SIL said it best..."it tastes like strawberry jam on cake" would have been better off just making a poke cake. It was edible, but nothing special. It was just as pretty as the picture and came out of the pan perfectly. I served it slightly warm and with vanilla ice cream as suggested...still, it was no ones' favorite and we all love strawberries. It wasn't a hit with our family. Sorry.

I forgot the gelatin the first time around as I was rushing around getting 10 dishes ready for a party...it was STILL great!  Made it a couple times now both ways (with and without the gelatin).  Lots of "mmmmm's" from guests!

I used Duncan Hines Pineapple supreme cake mix and added a large can of crushed pineapple drained to the Strawberries, to make the 2 cups needed. I used tropical flavored jello 3 oz size. When making the cake mix I use the juice from the pineapple in the cake mix instead of the water. I made it in a 9 x 13 cut it in half to make a layer cake and frosted the sides and in between the layers with a whipped cream frosting. Absolutely delicious! Will make this a again

I made this for one of my Easter desserts.  It was very moist and the taste was great.  I do agree with the previous review that the cake was not all that attractive.  But since the family really loved it I will definitely be making it again.

*Drool* Served this cake at a party last night w/ additional fresh strawberries and whipped cream for garnish, and it disappeared fast! I let my strawberries sit under a sprinkle of sugar til I mashed them w/ the back of a fork. It didn't occur to me that I had the 3 oz. packet of strawberry gelatin instead of the 6 oz. the recipe calls for, so I'm not sure if that changed the end result all that much, but either way, the strawberry, the marshmellow ... the cake, OH MY! Can't wait to try this cake again w/ a different combo of fruit to gelatin flavor!

AMAZING! although i only used about 4oz of the 6oz package of strawberry jello. I also made this in a bundt pan and it looked beautiful. I garnished with some stripes of chocolate ganache and filled the center of the bundt with choc. covered strawberries. I brought it to work for a retirement party and no one wanted to cut into it because of how pretty it looked!!

Don't expect this to look like a strawberry shortcake.  The baking process will darken and soften the berries.  I have tried it with and without the marshmallows...both ways were wonderful.  The marshmallows gave it a richer, heavier texture.

I expected so much more with all of the reviews! I agree with another reviewer who said it tasted like strawberry jam smeared on a cake.  It was really gooey, almost gummy....the texture wasn't good.  I won't be making again.

Great recipe!  I used chocolate cake mix instead of the yellow mix and it came out beautiful. Very tasteful!   Chocolate and strawberries are a perfect match. I prefer to eat it warm instead so the gelatin is melted.  Next time, my family wants to try it with the yellow cake mix.

This is too cool!  It stayed moist without being soggy, but it's best eaten warm.  I didn't have any problems getting it out of the pan, and I followed the original recipe.The Jello adds a nice tang to strawberries that might not be perfect---- and marshmallows???  WHO KNEW!?

This was a perfect recipe for my fresh strawberries I just picked. My husband loved it! I had some when it was warm and after it was refrigerated, I love it both ways. This is definitely a WINNER!!

I am no baker and I made this cake today with stawberries we picked from a local farm.  It was terrific but  I made some changes and will make more in the future.
1. add more berries
2. use 1/2 flavored and 1/2 unflavored gellatin all strawberry is too sweet for me.
3. I will be adding some lemon zest and 2 minced basil leaves to the strawberry mixture for brightness and complexity.
4. Because i always have issues getting things out of the pan, I lined the bottom with parchment paper and it tipped out perfectly. 

This will probably ebcome my new go to for potlucks when I need to bring a dessert.

Having followed the recipe exactly as written, the strawberry layer was rubbery as was the cake. No amount of RediWhip could overcome the fake strawberry taste of the jello. There has to be a better made-from-scratch recipe for a strawberry upside down cake.

I mashed strawberries with potato masher. Strawberries were very watery. Had to cook well over 50 minutes to cook centre of cake. When I turned it out it was no pretty and sloppy. Served it in bowl by cutting up cake and placing in large glass bowl and layering it with cool whip. Looked like a triple. Tasted nice.

I really liked this cake because it was so easy to make with really nice results. My husband and I don't eat cake often, so I made two smaller cakes using 8" round cake pans. They only had to cook for about 35 minutes. I was able to share them with my neighbors at a weekend gathering and with my co-workers on Monday morning! I might try to make individual cakes using my muffin tins next time.

This is a great idea, but i dont know WHY you would use marshmallows, DONT! I did, and all of them "floated" to the center of the cake, making a big goopy un-bakable center. I then scooped out the entire center of the cake and finished baking it. Had I not done that the entire cake NEVER would've finished baking. It was alright, but I dont think I'll make it again.

This was visually unappealing -- could NEVER take this to a function! Taste was acceptable.  It tasted like strawberry jam smeared on a cake. Won't make it again.

I really loved this cake. It was so simple to make and tasted so delicious.  The only changes I made was I only used a 2oz. of strawberry Jello which was what I had on hand and used White Vanilla Cake mix also what I had on hand. Since some of the other reviewers had issues with sticking I lightly sprayed(very lightly) my glass pan. It came out very easy after cooling.  My family really loved this cake. It's already been requested again. Next time I may try a bundt pan.  Thanks for sharing!!

Made this exactly as written. I had no problems getting it out of the pan or with the cooking time. I do think the next time i make this i will add alittle bit of sugar to the strawberries b/c it was a little bit tart.

I'm averaging the score to 4 stars based on my thoughts and those I served it to. I really liked the idea as a way to use fresh strawberries and have been wanting to try jello in a cake for awhile. However, I just didn't care for the taste/texture. My husband and in-laws both liked it though, hence the 4 stars. The reviewer who recommended macerating the strawberries so that the gelatin woud dissolve had a great idea. My only other point is to recommend that the cake cool for at least 10 minutes before flipping it onto a serving tray.

This was easy and so good. Everyone loved it. I do not usually make anything from box mixes, but I decided to try this. It has a great flavor. Wonderful if you are in a hurry. I will also try it from making my own cake, but in a hurry this is hands down the best.

This reminded me of a strawberry shortcake all in one! We also live in FL, and have strawberries galore, so always looking for recipes. I also sliced my fresh berries & sprinkled with sugar overnite for more sweetness and juicy berries to mash. I cut recipe in half using jiffy yellow cake mix which makes just one layer, and used one round cake pan. Will make this again!

I made the cake last night.  I followed the directions except I used frozen sliced strawberries instead of fresh.  The family loved it!  I had no problems and it came out perfect!  It even looked pretty!!!  It will be a staple in the dessert rotation.  Looking forward to including it in the job's potluck in a few weeks!

Wow this wasn't what I expected,  i was unsure how it was going to turn out, but now I am glad I made this.   What surprised me the most is that the marshmellow kind of disappeared into the the cake but gave a fantastic taste.  I ended using a whole bag of marshmellows too.  will make this one again thanks for a great recipe

This was good but I like Blueberry Bottom Cake (on this site) a lot better. Very similar recipe, using blueberries instead of strawberries. I use a white cake mix and I sprinkle 1 cup sugar over the berries, sprinkle raspberry gelatin over the sugar, marshmallows over the gelatin and then pour the cake mix batter. I also top it off with fresh whipped cream.

Amazingly Great Cake. This has become my standard, "go to" cake recipe for special events.  Everyone clamours for it AND the recipe.  The only changes I do is use two cartons of fresh rasperries and one carton of fresh blackberries.  Definitely sprinkle the berries with sugar for one hour before mashing to bring out the juice!.  I also use Rasperry jello in stead of strawberry.  I cook it in a 10" springform pan for 50 (ish) minutes and visually and tastewise it is amazing everytime.

You CANT STOP EATING IT. Wow. It looked like a crazy fool mess when I was assembling it, I thought it would be a total loss. Boy was I wrong. Like a strawberry Twinkie only hot and fresh! Here are my modifications and they're spot on! I used Vanilla cake mix, I added an extra egg and a packet of vanilla pudding mix to the cake AND added white chocolate chips into the batter. I used strawberries with sugar on them but sliced them instead of mashing them and I also added pineapple rings! INSANITY!!!!! The taste!!!!!! When it came out of the oven I put more white chocolate chips on the top with some added chocolate sprinkles and then they all melted so I smeared them with a spoon and it formed a crusty solid chocolate topping. 

Yum. You HAVE to make it with the extra pudding in the cake mix. 

Also, it's a messy cake and if you're worried how it looks then don't flip it out of the pan. Do what I did and leave it in the pan and add the chocolate chips to the top because when they melt it looks awesome and like icing only better. We served it in the pan like that as a strawberry-pineapple bottomed cake and it was gone in less than a half hour and four people wanted the recipe from me. Sweet.

I LOVE this recipe! Have made it several times and it is always a hit! The one think I do is add a couple of teaspoons of brown sugar to the berries while I prep the cake and ever since the 2nd time I've used lemon cake mix...just like strawberry lemonade. :) I also have used different flavors of jello (whatever is on hand) and actually have used unflavored the last time and will again this time as I forgot to buy the jello. It will still be fab!

My family went nuts over this. I used 3 cups instead of 2 of the strawberries, 2 didn't fill my pan. Otherwise I followed exactly and it turned out amazing. Great easy recipe.

Wow!  We loved this.  Made for my MIL to celebrate her retirement.  I made it exactly as written except that I only had a 3 ounce box of gelatin.  It worked out perfect!  Very easy to turn out of the cake.  The leftover cake was ever better the next day.  Very moist, delicious cake.  My husband has already requested it again!

This was okay.  I excpected a little more taste.  I would have made my strawberries in bigger chunks, because they almost dissapeared after cooking.

This was a very simple, very sweet recipe.  The marshmallows blend in with the sauce and you cannot even tell they're there!  I crushed my strawberries a bit much, so they totally dissolved the marshmallows during cooking, therefore I did not have the crunch others have mentioned.  It was really very good, and a nice change.

Made this for a 3rd of July party - everyone loved it, it was just okay for me.  Not sure what the marshmallows add.  I would make it again, but I prefer my strawberries in a trifle.

Awesome recipes - followed directions to a T - the marshmallows add a little crunch to it that makes it even better - almost tastes like a Rhubard cake - and SUPER easy to make!!  Thx for the recipe!!

With a few adjustments, I thought this cake was delicious.  I sliced the strawberries instead of crushing them, omitted the marshmellows, made a yellow cake from scratch and baked for about 40 minutes.  After letting the cake cool completely, I turned the cake over and topped it with an additional 2 cups of fresh sliced strawberries and put it in the fridge.  Serve cold with cool-whip!

Using fresh strawberries whenever possible is a definite plus. I had no problem with the cake releasing; Only a couple of tiny bits stuck to the baking dish and the spots on the cake were easily filled by smoothing out the strawberry topping. I liked the sweetness balance of this recipe. Despite my prediction when the ingredients include marshmallows, I didn't find this overly sweet at all. If this lasts in your house it's even better the following day as the strawberry topping will seep a little into the cake. It's wonderful with a dollop of whipped cream. A really nice recipe parealtor! Thanks for posting it.

I don't know what I did but the cake got stuck in the pan even after completely cooking. It still tasted wonderful we just scooped it out in bowls with ice cream.

This cake turned out lovely as can be!! I followed the directions, but I did not use fresh strawberries, sadly our area didn't have any, but I used frozen and defrosted them, mashed them, and the cake still turned out beautifully! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This is an easy and fantastic recipe when strawberries are in season.  I used a bundt pan and had to place a pan under it in the oven as the mixture over-flowed.  No matter, it turned out of the pan easily and received RAVE reviews from my neighbors.  Thank you for sharing!

This was very good, although not as good as "Strawberry Angel Food Dessert".  I made this because I was curious what happened to the marshmallows.  They disappear, and the completed cake has a nicely flavored strawberry puree taste and texture.  I only gave this 4 stars because I felt the flavor of the gelatin was kind of strong and a little artificial.  Still, a very easy, pretty dessert, and tasted great with whipped cream on top.

Yummy!  It's a very sweet, dense cake.  I made it as a Bundt, and the color was beautiful.  We served it with cool whip, which was perfect.  Frosting would be sugar overkill.

This was delicious!! I made fresh whipped cream to go along with it and my husband said it was amazing!!!  I did let cool in the pan longer than 15 minutes because when I ran my knife around the edges I could still see liquid and was afraid the strawberry mixture would fall out everywhere if I flipped it.  It probably cooled for 45 minutes or so...I had the time lol.  Then went straight to refrigerator to chill! YUMMY

This was delicious!  Had it with cool whip on top.  Not so hot without some sort of topping, though.  Once we ran out of cool whip it wasnt so awesome, but vanilla ice cream was a wonderful substitute.

Love this so easy and so moist.  I combined the strawberries with the jello before pouring in the bottom of 2- 9" round cake pans.  Let cool completely and layered.  I added the whipped cream cream cheese frosting around the bottom and top and chocolate dipped strawberries on top.  Yummy!!

I made this cake today and was very disappointed.  I do think there is too much gelatin mix. The cake tastes more like jello. If I were to make this again, which I do not think so, I would use less gelatin.  The cake was too sweet for me.  The strawberries were not the prominent taste. I would suggest if anyone makes this, to slice the strawberries and place them as you would with a peach or pineapple upside down cake.  It would make a better appearance.   I will not make this again..

Yum!!  I baked this in a bundt pan and it turned out beautifully.  I served it with whipped cream.  It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be so the whipped cream was a perfect accompaniment.  Definitely a keeper!

This is an awesome recipe.  I used a French Vanilla cake mix, and maybe just a handful more of marshmallows, I did follow the recipe and everything turned out perfect.

This was excellant!  I followed a suggestion by another reader and let the strawberries sit for a while after adding a little sugar. I used about 1 1/2 pounds of strawberries. Also, I used only a 3 ounce box of jello, all that I had.  Still turned out very good.  My husband loved it!  The kids devoured it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Everyone in my household loved it!  Followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding a bit more strawberries (chunky-crushed with some sugar to release the juices), 1/2 cup more of the marshmallows, and also ended up baking the cake for just about one hour.  Served it cold with real whipped cream.  Next time will try serving it warm with some vanilla ice cream.  This is our new favorite "strawberry shortcake."  Thanks so much for a fantastic, fun to make recipe.

I used two 9" Bakers Secret non-stick pans. Spritzed the bottom and sides lightly with non-stick cooking spray (just to be sure that it wouldn't stick). I covered the bottom of each pan with sliced strawberries, sprinkled 1/2 of a 3 oz. box of strawberry Jell-O on the berries in each pan, and layered mini marshmallows on top of the berries in each pan. Used Pillsbury Moist Supreme strawberry cake mix, dividing the batter evenly between pans. Baked 31 minutes at 350, let the pans cool on trivets for about 25 minutes, ran a knife around the edge, turned out one layer on the cake plate, turned the other layer on top of that one. Let it sit in the refrigerator for several hours and then frosted the sides with some home made strawberry cream cheese frosting. Put back in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, it was ready and was terrific. (I like cold cake....and I like strawberries, as you can tell.) Absolutely no problem with sticking. Don't panic if the cake doesn't turn loose immediately. It will. Also, don't be alarmed when you see Jell-O/juice bubbling up the sides of the pans when baking. That's normal.

Very tasty. Used raspberry gelatin, and I agree, 1/2 box would probably do it, and whipped cream or ala mode (ice cream) would make this dessert complete--or else you need to wash it down with some milk. Appearance: who cares! I didn't invert it until 1/2 gone, and 2 hours later, to put into fridge. I didn't grease my dish, either, and it came out fine. I didn't have mashmallows, but tried using marshmallow creme. It's difficult to spread over the strawberry/jello mixture, but if you let it sit, even the globs spread on their own. The strawberry/jello sat while I prepared the cake batter. By the time it was poured on, all the dry granules of jello had absorbed strawberry "juices". I used french vanilla cake. The marshmallow creme (even though I tried to spread as best I could) rose to the top of the batter, where I got brown-er spots. Of course when you turn it over, nobody would have noticed anyway - but this was for my family, and they all liked it. I would make it again for my mom (made it for myself for mother's day).

I couldn't get the center of the cake to cook.  I see that another user had this same problem.  I finally had to take it out of the oven because I was afraid that the outside edges of the cake would over dry and maybe burn.  I am rating it 3 stars because the outside edge of the cake was good but we couldn't eat the center.  I probably won't make this again.

I've been a fan of this site for several years and have used many, many of its recipes.  Some have been wonderful, some not so wonderful, but this is the most disappointing recipe from "allrecipes" that I have ever made.  The cake looks just like the picture and smells nice.  However, that is all I can say good about it.  The Jello gives an overpowering nasty, artificial taste to the cake and I regret the waste of my ingredients especially the fresh strawberries.  I cannot think how this recipe can be salvaged for my family, so I will not make it again.

Not the most beautiful cake, but was delicious. After reading reviews,  I used about 3 cups of fresh strawberries, crushed them and sprinkled  a little sugar on them to get thier juices going. I sprinkled a 3 oz box of strawberry jello over them and strirred it all together. I made sure I sprayed pam in my pan and everything else I did the same. After letting the cake cool down for an hour I turned it over and had no issuses. Served with whip cream. A keeper in my house.

This is just unbelievably good!!! It was my first upside down cake, I did not have a non stick pan so i used a glass one. I was worried that it would stick but i coated it very lightly with butter and let the cake cool for 20 min and it came right out! perfecto! I would recommend using about a cup more of strawberrys if you want a real fruit taste! but This will turn out great if you just follow the recipe!

This is a VERY good cake!  I used frozen (thawed) strawberries because I can't get decent fresh ones this time of year.  The only change I had to make was to chill the cake after it was finished baking it because otherwise it would have been a sloppy mess if I tried to invert in on a platter.  I chilled it for a couple of hours before serving and it turned out perfect.  I used a Better Crocker Butter recipe cake mix...yum!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this following the recipe, but I baked in two 9 inch pans.  I had to monitor the cake with a toothpick.  This cake is a yummy alternative to Pineapple upside down cake.  Yummy and I would make this again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This recipe is super easy to make and comes out delicious! It's not a super sweet cake which we love because it allows the sweetness of the strawberries to be the focus point.  I was pleasantly surprised at the way the marshmallows melted and rose to the top of the cake and still didn't overpower in any way with their sweetness. I used sugar-free jello and it worked perfectly and lent an extra zing of  bright red color to the already ripe strawberries. I also added a dash of strawberry extract to the cake batter  thinking it would add another layer of strawberry taste, but honestly it was barely detectable, so I won't bother doing that again. Also flipping a cake from a 9 x 13 pan, while doable, can be a bit daunting, so next time I'll use multiple smaller pans.  This will make flipping and storing easier.  This recipe could be used for any kind of seasonal fresh fruit - just imagine using apples and cinnamon, pears with ginger or cardamon, peaches, berries - you can let your imagination go wild with this recipe. Thanks for sharing this one!

I just made this. I didnt use any marshmallows being that I had none. I used betty Crocker yellow cake mix and I crushed the strawberries. I baked in a loaf pan.  I checked it while it was baking and I was scared because the juices ran up the sides and the center of the cake wasnt done after 45min. I left it in for an additional 20min. I didnt eat it yet its still sitting out. I am hoping that it comes out pretty good. My huaband doesn't eat cake but im hoping he tries this with me and he likes it. 
I will try it again maybe next weekend.

This was simple and DELISH!  Not very attractive on it's own, but looks refreshing and appealing when individual slices are served on plate with generous spray of Redi Whip & fresh sliced strawberries.  I subbed strawberry flavored marshmallows torn up into small chunks and used sugar free strawberry jello.  Wonderful, moist cake that everyone ate and enjoyed.  It was so good no one touched the chocolate covered strawberries I served with the cake...several people went back for seconds  Wonderful cake for any time of year...thx parealtor313!!!

I made this recipe with no problems. I used 1 whole carton (16oz) of strawberries and mashed them to make a little 
over 2 cups. I also arranged sliced strawberries on the bottom before adding the mashed strawberries so it 
could look pretty when I flipped it over (didn't really make a difference, oh well). First I placed the sliced strawberries and sprinkled it generously with the jello, then I poured the mashed strawberries and added the rest of the jello, 6oz does look like alot, but it was perfect. Then I let that sit and marinade while I made the cake mix. Not sure why I needed to add marshmallows but I used just 1 cup not 3. Overall, very good. Served it with ice cream.

I've made this cake several times now and it is a HIT at my house.  I make it in a pan that I don't have a serving plate to invert it on so I leave it in the glass pan.  Maybe doesn't look as good this way but it sure as heck tastes WONDERFUL.  Made it just as the recipe calls and it is sooo good.  Since then have experimented some and they are awesome also, so this cake does give you the opportunity to make it "your own".  Try it if you like an awesome refrigerator cake with fruit, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe would have been good if it didn't require all that gelatin.  I ate once slice and broke out in hives for 5 days.  I am not or never have been allergic to strawberries.  I have even eaten them afterwards to see if maybe I developed an allergy.  Beware...the gelatin is too much

Yummy! This cake was easy to make, tasty, and looked pretty when I turned it out onto the serving platter. I used about 2 1/2 cups crushed strawberries and only about 3/4 of the jello... I was a little hesitant to use the whole thing based on some of the negative reviews, but next time, I'll use it all! (Maybe the negative reviewers used jello pudding mix, and not gelatin?) Some of my strawberries weren't as ripe, so I crushed those first and put them in a separate bowl with a little bit of sugar. Those went in the fridge to sweeten up a bit while I crushed up the rest. I couldn't tell that any of them weren't as ripe this way! After baking and turning the cake out, I used a small spatula to spread some of the strawberries around the sides so it looked frosted. We love this cake, and it tastes even better the next day when it's had time to chill in the fridge! TIP ON MASHING: I cut the strawberries into quarter chunks. Then I used the bottom of a stainless steel measuring cup and smashed them on a cutting board - worked great this way.

WHAT A MESS!!! The only reason it gets two stars is for the flavor which is quite good. But the berry-jello mix didn't set and it ran all over the plate when I turned it out. Would have been better off leaving it in the pan and spooning it out. For my money, I'll stick to a good old Strawberry Shortcake!

WOW!!  Every strawberry season I hunt for the perfect strawberry dessert and have yet to find it, until now!  This was the most delicious strawberry cake I have ever eaten and by far, the easiest and quickest to prepare.  Followed the recipe, although I did not measure the strawberries, I just filled up the bottom and I used a bundt pan.  Soooo good!!!

How wonderful!  I would suggest, however, putting it in two cake pans instead of a 9x13 unless you have a platter that would handle that big a cake once you turn it upside down.

This cake is fun and easy to make and it is soooooo scrumptious!  I was worried that it would stick to the pan, but I let it cool for the recommended 20 mins and it came out fine.  Highly recommended!

This was delicious! I used a bundt pan, so I cut back a bit on the gelatin mix and marshmallows (just eyeballed both). I chopped up a whole pkg. of strawberried and then lightly crushed them w/ my potato masher...worked perfectly! Great flavor and we didn't find it 'artificial' at all. Will def make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was yum. I suggest using raspberry Jello, rather than strawberry to minimize any imitation strawberry taste. I used a white cake mix (Duncan Hines Pudding in the Mix) and it was very moist and tasty. I understand what people are saying about  a "rubbery" consistency, but that goes away if you warm it slightly , which makes it perfect for a la mode! Super easy, and I even subbed a few frozen strawberries because I was short on fresh ones.

I really enjoyed this cake. It came together very easily! Only thing I would do differently is let the strawberry sit in a little sugar for awhile to bring out the juices. I will definitely make this again...Thanks for a great new recipe!

We love this cake!  I made this for my husbands picky eater cousin's birthday.  We couldn't stop eating it.  Everyone loved it!!!  Even my husband who doesn't like to eat sweets.  He said this is the best cake I've ever made =)

I read the other reviews and followed a few of their suggestions.  I only used 3 oz. package of the strawberry gelatin mix.  After I crushed the fresh strawberries with a fork, I put it in a bowl, added a tablespoon of sugar and all of the 3 oz. gelatin mix.  I let it sit while I made the cake mix.  I used buttercake and it was delish!  I also used parchment paper so I didn't have a problem transferring it on a serving tray.

A fun and great tasting recipe. I only used one small 3 oz. box of strawberry gelatin with fresh strawberries and this turned out very delicious and perfectly sweet.  I was surprised that it flipped so easily out of the pan.

This was really good! I used fresh strawberries cubed and sprinkled some white sugar to help draw out the juices.  I also used a sugar-free strawberry jello a french vanilla cake mix.  I used a bundt pan and it turned out nicely! I used non-stick spray and dusted with flour.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. I was scared about using an entire package of jello but it really worked well! I used three cups of sliced fresh strawberry's and three cups of mini marshmallows other than that I followed the recipe to a "T" I was really worried it would have the weird fake strawberry taste from the jello but that was not at all the case. This recipe is amazing and taste wonderful and so simple to make!!! Also it only took 40 min to cook and I let it rest in a greased glass pan for 15 min before inverting and it came out beautiful!!!

I have used many great recipes from this site, but this one was a huge zero. The marshmallows in the recipe were noticable and unappealing. A 6 oz. pkg of jello is way, way too much to sprinkle on. This cake was too sweet, and as another reviewer wrote, it was such a waste of delicious fresh strawberries.

Very refreshing and light. Got carried away and completely pureed the strawberries.  It still turned out beautiful and delicious.  Could not taste the marshmallows at all (good thing for me, b/c I don't really care for them).  

I may try to make this with an angel food cake next time just to lighten it up even more.  

Served with vanilla bean ice cream, but would be great with whipped cream on top too.

I didn't feel this was an improvement on regular old strawberry shortcake....a lot of extra sugar, calories, and chemicals without any extra taste.

This cake was a hit at my "4th" of July Barbecue (held on July 3rd).  Went faster than my cheesecake.  Lined the bottom of the pan and absolutely nothing stuck to the bottom.  It is beautiful when finished and released from the pan.  Topped mine with blueberries and piped on a touch of whipped cream - a new take on red, white and blue cake.  My guests LOVED it!

Couldn't be easier!  It seemed strange to smother those pretty strawberries with powdered gelatin mix and marshmallows, but it all works out in the end.  I used fresh strawberries and followed the recipe exactly.  My sister-in-law tried this recipe first, so I knew it was going to be good!  I took it to a family function and it was a hit.  I definitely recommend serving this with whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream.  Delicious!

I made these into individual cakes using a muffin pan. The only fault was I had to almost double the strawberries. All in all they were delicious.

This was DELICIOUS!!!  I was a bit skeptical about the purpose of the marshmallows but whatever they do, it's worth it!  SOOOO moist and not too sweet!  I made for a holiday gathering and everyone was obsessed!  Great recipe!

This was very good. Next time I will omit the marshmallows as they didn't seem to add much to the cake and I would like to cut some of the sweetness.  Cake mixes are already plenty sweet for my taste.  I used frozen strawberries and added about an extra cup, which was delicious. I used chocolate fudge cake mix, which worked well.  Will make again.

This was very tasty but I only gave it 3 stars because I really didn't see what the marshmallows and the jello added to the recipe...In the end I thought they were a giant waste of ingredients I've made this for years with rhubarb and this would have tasted the same just by mashing the berries and adding a bit of white sugar on top.

delicious cake - ONLY problem was when I turned it upside down, it did not release from pan - strawberries stuck to pan ! Next time I will spray pan with cooking spray first. I got it out best I could, and put half on top of half and did the "coolwhip" coverup - everyone loved it

I made this for Memorial Day company. When we came inside for dessert it was very refreshing because it was cold from being in the refrigerator. Got rave reviews from everyone. Will definately make it again. Served with cool whip on top.

MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS CAKE!  I too used frozen whole strawberries (thawed) and they worked just fine.  I also added extra marshmallows.  According to my husband, this is the best cake I ever made!  I will experiment with different fruits in the future just to see how they work out.

This was a wonderful cake and my guests loved it.  I took the advice of a reviewer and lined the pan with parchment paper and I also thinly sliced several strawberries covering the bottom of the pan and then spread the crushed strawberries over the slices.  When I turned the cake out of the pan it was quite attractive.

This was not visually attractive at all so I topped it with a pretty whipped cream topping & served it to a group of Cancer Care Personnel.  They rate this a very high 5 star & said it was scrumptious!  Thanks for sharing!

This is an amazing recipe. I followed the recipe pretty much as written. The only change I made was I put a layer of sliced strawberries down first then put the crushed on top of them. I only had one problem with this I think I needed a deeper pan because the cake mix overflowed in my oven and made a huge mess. I plan to make this for a a cookout we are having on memorial day. Thank you so much for this amazing cake!!!

Made this for my son's graduation reception and everyone raved! I took the advice of making sure the strawberries were juicy and added another cup of marshmallows.  None left at the end of the evening.  Will definitely make again.

I love, love, LOVE this recipe!  So quick & easy to make and tastes sooo good!   I jazzed it just a little with french vanilla cake mix....double the strawberries and I added about 1/4 cup sugar to the strawberries along with the gelatin and mixed together as I chopped.   Everyone fell in love! ;o)

I followed all directions on this cake and the topping got stuck to the bottom of the pan :(  I even used cooking spray to keep it from sticking.  It smelled delicious and tasted good but looked terrible, more like a crumble than a cake.

It is possible that I am unfairly giving this recipe 4 out of 5 stars because I changed it, but I don't think the changes I made affected it that much. With that said, I made the following changes based on what I had: frozen, thawed, smashed strawberries, one 3 oz. package of strawberry Jell-o, and a funfetti cake mix instead of the yellow. The cake flipped nicely. It would probably have been a better idea to not have smashed the strawberries so much. The additional 3 oz. of gelatin would have probably kept it gelled better.  The cake had an okay flavor, but next time I think I will stick with a simpler strawberry short cake.

I made this as is but it needed a little more to it. I made vanilla pudding using a 6 oz box and then a tub of cool whip. I mixed the two together and then layered the cake between the cool whip/pudding mixture with more strawberries. It was delish!

Absolutely wonderful!  I made this for a family bbq, and it got rave reviews!  I was repeatedly asked where I got the recipe, and if they could have copies.  It turned out moist and refreshing; as an added bonus, I served it with a side of cool whip.  I will be making this again and again.

I used unflavored gelatin and didn't get the "artificial" strawberry jello taste some reviewers complained about.  Cut the strawberries into very small pieces - found crushing was kinda hard - and made it in a springform pan that I put foil around so nothing would run out.  Also used traders joes white cake mix - perfect size and it was really good!  Thanks for the great recipe - will definitely make again!

Loved it?  Very easy to make..I used white cake mix since I didn't have yellow.  It reminded me of a recipe my mother made that called for strawberry and rhubarb but Im sure you can add it to this recipe also.

This was delicious! My toddlers had fun mushing up the strawberries and spreading the marshmellows.  We used Raspberry jello-- it complimented the cake very nicely.  We also topped it with homemade strawberry frosting.  Will definitely make again!

While i was really excited to try this and it didn't taste bad, it didn't look appitizing when flipped out of the pan. I covered it with some whipped cream and my kids gobbled it down but when they ask What's that and wrinkle their noses because of how it looks, it kinda takes the wind out of my sails when I went out of the way to make a special desert on a weeknight. Plan to cover it up when you flip it if you want people to be excited about it... whipped cream worked great here.

This was good.  Made several small cakes by dividing up the ingredients, two 9" rounds and one 5" round.  We ate it both warm and cold the next day and it's good either way.

I made this over the weekend and it was excellent!  I got rave reviews from all who ate it.  I sliced fresh strawberries and sprinkled some sugar on them, then let that sit for an hour before mashing them.  It was so so simple!  If you love strawberries, you should definitely give it a try!

This did not turn out at all.  I followed the recipe and when I tried to turn it out on my foil lined board it all bunched up into a big glob.  I spooned it into a serving dish (there was NO cutting it) and served it in a bowl with some cool whip.  My hubby took one bite and said, "what is this???".  Needless to say, I won't be making it again.

This cake turned out ok.  My family enjoyed it a lot.  I personally thought it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I also decided to top it with some whipped cream as the cake did not 'look' pretty.  I think I'll stick to the pinapple upside down cake!

I have made this same recipe with rhubarb, instead of strawberries.  Sprinkle a cup of sugar along with the jello over the rhubarb.  This is my family's favorite way to make shubarb

I am not sure what happened but i couldn't get the center of the cake to cook. After over an hour of cooking it at 350 and putting foil around the edges to keep if from burning it was still raw. I am still rating it 3 stars in the off chance it was something I did. Everyone else seems to not have had this problem.

I would recommend waiting more than an hour before serving because an hour or so after baking I had the first bite and was disappointed because the strawberries tasted bitter and they didn't take form but were runny.  But a few hours later and my family all took a slice and the strawberries held together beautifully.  They all raved and loved it.  My husband even had seconds, and I was suprised when he said "I don't like it, I love it!" So I had a slice later and found that it was really good and didn't have that bitter taste that i noted earlier.  The day after and I'm having my another slice and it honestly tastes better than yesterday.  I will make this again soon.

What an interesting and delicious cake - my husband loved it and had two huge pieces with just a bit of whipped cream on top.  Followed the directions exactly and it was perfect.  Although I used strawberries I think it would be great with raspberries too.

This was "okay".  Appearance was not very pretty.  The taste was that of a "jello" cake, so not very unique.  Sorry, I won't make this again.

I didn't use a box cake. I used "Lemon Gold Cake" from this site, replacing some of the lemon-ness with extra berryness. And this dessert was still wonderful. We ate it warm. It was gooey and fluffy and very good! I will definitely be making this again. (Oh, and I made it in an angel food cake pan which required longer baking, after lowering temperature after 40 minutes, but it still was great!)

So good! I used some leftover strawberry flavored marshmallows from easter for this, I really couldn't taste them though so next time ill use more (or maybe spread a layer of marshmallow cream over the strawberries). I think ill aslo mix the packet of jello in with the strawberries rather than sprinkling it over the top of them since some of my strawberries kind of fell off & away from the cake. I used a glass pan for this & I was worried it would stick because it seems like everything sticks to my glass pan, cooking spray or no cooking spray, so I set my glass pan on top of a cookie sheet while baking and I had no trouble with the cake sticking! I let mine cool for about an hour before I flipped it over and it came out of the pan beautifully! Id also like to try this with lemon flavored jello for a strawberry-lemonaid flavor during the summer. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I had such expectations for this recipe. Sorry, this was just ok. I let the cake sit out 15 min. before flipping the cake (like the recipe said) and it stll stuck to my Pyrex. I even used Pam before adding all the ingredients in the Pyrex. Not really the prettiest, yummiest or impressive for company, so I probably won't keep this recipe. I do, however, highly suggest adding Cool Whip on top when serving.

I know a lot of people said this was rubbery but I've made it twice not and it was perfect each time. the strawberries came out more like a jam. Everyone who tried loved it. So I made it again for a potluck. Plus it's very easy to make. I used fresh strawberries and crushed them with the bottom of a cup. Maybe those who had trouble with it being rubbery made it with frozen strawberries.

Really tasted good.  It seemed a little too moist but honestly no one gave it a chance to cool so I don't know if it would have set up enough to invert or not!  I guess it doesn't matter since everyone enjoyed it so much!

Okay, so here's the thing... I've made this recipe twice, with differing results. Confessing now that I didn't follow the recipe  completely, either time. No marshmallows (yuck!) and only used one 3oz box of Jello powder. The first time was the more successful. I rated it as a five. Problem was, I didn't have strawberries, so used fresh raspberries & raspberry Jello powder, which I prefer. It turned out beautifully... light, moist, yummy and pretty to look at when turned onto the serving platter. Used a fluted fancy bundt pan and garnished with fresh raspberries and whipped cream to serve! So it was with great confidence that I set out to have a similar result today with fresh strawberries and strawberry Jello powder. Let's just say, I now know why the recipe calls for 2  3oz boxes of Jello powder and a layer of marshmallows btwn the watery, mushy strawberries and the cake batter; overkill on the sugar notwithstanding. ?? When I turned the cake out onto the platter, the strawberry mush went everywhere and the cake seemed to have been eaten away in parts. No pretty fluted pattern this time. just a messy volcano look. Tasted okay but a bit bland compared to the raspberry version. Will use this recipe again with raspberries for sure and will try peaches, blueberries or maybe even cherries. Have learned my lesson: if I try strawberries again, I'll slice them and possibly add about half of a second box of Jello powder.

I made a few adjustments to this recipe based on other reviews.  I quartered the strawberries, sprinkled with brown sugar and allowed them to macerate before smashing them with a potato masher.   I made a bundt cake and it turned out beautifully. After placing the prepared strawberries into a greased bundt pan, I only used 3oz of jello (sprinkle).  This allowed the juices to run down the sides of the bundt cake after it was inverted.  Using more jello would have thickened the strawberries too much.  This is not a sweet cake, but for my family's tastes, it was delicious and so quick to prepare.

Made this today with my 10 year old baking buddy. It was so easy and delicious. Others said the jello didnt mix when there is not enough juice from the strawberries. To fix this I stirred the jello into the crushed strawberries then poured it in the pan. It worked perfectly doing that.

Changes I made  are due to being a diabetic. I  used a sugar free yellow cake mix and added 1 small box of sugar free instant pudding powder. I also substituted the 1 cup of water with pineapple juice from large can of crushed pineapple.
I diced half of the strawberries in a bowl and stirred in 3oz of sugar free raspberry jello because that was in my pantry. Let that sit for 10 minutes then stirred in drained pineapple.
Layered other half of strawberries in quarters over parchment lined 9x13 inch pan. Poured pineapple, strawberry, jello mixture on top of the strawberries.  Poured mixed cake mix following box directions with my addition and substitution, over that topping. 
Baked 15 minutes more after the center of cake rises. It was perfect. We ate the first piece warm. No marshmallows used. I forgot the whipped cream. Still good. Topping was of smooth glaze consistency, not thick, not rubbery not grainy as others stated. Will bake again using peaches,cloves, and cinnamon.

Followed recipe other than the yellow cake mix, because I prefer white cake mix, and served while still warm. Was excellent. Thank you for sharing. Definitely kid approved.

Tip for those who haven't had to flip a cake before..  Cover the top of the baking pan with the tray and flip together, then lift the pan off so you don't break the cake or make a huge mess, and make sure you spray the pan before cooking. Also, I didn't have a tray big enough. I wrapped a cutting board with foil to use instead. Worked perfectly.

I was hesitant to try this.  It seemed that people either loved it or hated it and I wasn't sure about the combo of ingredients.  But a quick and easy dessert was too easy to pass up, so I ultimately gave it a try.  Boy, am I glad I did!  It was a hit with my family.  I did make a few changes -- I used two 14 oz. bags of sliced frozen strawberries in place of fresh.  These had no sugar added and were strictly the fresh/frozen strawberry slices.  I sprayed my 13x9-inch pan with non-stick cooking spray and dumped the thawed strawberries into it.  I didn't read the instructions very well and ended up buying a small box of jello.  That turned out to be plenty.  I probably used closer to 4 cups of marshmallows over the top as I wanted to spread them evenly.  I used a DH yellow cake mix and added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to the batter, then poured it over everything.  I baked it for a little over 40 minutes (43? I think) and let it cool in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting.  It came out beautifully.  We served it warm with vanilla ice cream on top.  Quick, easy.  I'll be making it again!

I decided to try this cake but I also have an abundance of rhubarb so I took one large stalk and cut it into small pieces and mixed it with the crushed strawberries and continued as directed.  I also used a little bit smaller pan because one of you said it came out too thin.  It was perfect!  The rhubarb gave it  a delightful tang!  It was so quick and easy.  I will probably make it again in the winter using some of my frozen berries and frozen rhubarb for a taste of springtime!

Good recipe, but a little too sweet for my family.  I will use chopped rhubarb in place of the crushed strawberries in the future.

This photo is misleading. When made in 9X13 pan the cake is lots thinner. Wish I would have known this. There is so much wet product that is too hard to serve at the gathering  I made it for. I made the cake just as you wrote it.

Was looking forward to making this when I discovered I didn't have yellow cake mix, but did have chocolate.  Used that, adding chocolate pudding and some chocolate chips.  Sliced up some frozen strawberries and sprinkled the jello mix over them as they thawed and it created a juicy strawberry slurry that oozed deliciously over the chocolate base after inversion.  Yummm! I still want to try the original version too, but this is a keeper!

I served this at a neighborhood cookout yesterday, thinking the kids would love it.  I had a bunch of strawberries getting ripe in my fridge and thought this was a perfect recipe to try. One neighbor said it reminded him of a rhubarb cake he'd had as a kid, and the recipe sounds very similar.  I only used half the pack of strawberry jello and don't think the artificial flavor was overpowering, however, like some reviewers have said, the topping was rubbery and that was distracting.  It tasted good- went well with whipped cream- and I altered the normal box cake recipe (from the Cake Doctor book) which made the cake super moist, but I'm not so sure I love how the strawberry topping turned out.  The kids did like it, but probably won't make it again.  I was hoping it would have turned out more like pineapple upside-down cake with more of a fresh strawberry kick, but the jello/marshmallow topping wasn't as great as I thought it would be.

This cake is incredible, and my guests LOVED it! I made a couple of adjustments. To the batter: I microwaved a 2 cup measuring cup full of chocolate chips with 1/4 cup water for a minute, stirred and then blended into the batter. I added 1 cup more marshmallows and baked the cake in a 10" X 2". It took about 1:5 minutes before the knife came out mostly clean, but I served it hot with a pile of whipped cream. Next time I'll try it with ice cream! The top (which becomes the bottom) was crunchy while the center was like chocolate lava cake- moist and delicious!!!

I tried this recipe and was quite pleased! only thing I recommend is measure the berries after you mash them and I also added more marshmallows and more strawberries and another thing I did different was to use my own cake from scratch! I used the recipe for Classic yellow sheet cake from Americas Test Kitchen Baking Book, as I am not a big fan of Box cake mix.

We were not impressed at all with this recipe.  I thought this recipe sounded good & because of the high rating I already purchased all of the ingredients before I read some of the negative reviews.  I wish I would've read them first but honestly, because of the high rating I would've more than likely still proceeded with it. The gelatin gives it a strong artificial taste that over powers the taste of the fresh berries.  Based on other reviews, I onky used 1 pack of gelatin.  I would think that using 1/2 of a pack would be more than enough! Because even using 1/2 it still seemed like too much! I could not imagine sprinkling double that in this cake!  That is over kill!  As for the marshmallows, I'm really uncertain on what results.  I. I they were supposed to have in the cake because you would never notice they're in there at all! They dissappear during baking! I greased the pan really good with crisco (because of all the reviewers saying they had major problems with the cake sticking) and I didn't have the slightest difficulty, the cake slid right out!  The cake tasted awful & I hate to say it but I don't think there's any way to tweak it to make it better.  There's no way I would serve this to anyone. It was unedible after baking but like some of the reviewers said if you cool it in the fridge & later eat it cold with whipped cream it is ok.  We did that so it wouldn't be wasted.

Loved this cake. So did everyone else! I WAS wondering what did happen to the mini marshmallows when it baked... :-) Being that they disappear, why put them in there? I didn't taste them, hmmm. Anyway, will be making many more times! Even picky honey liked it.Very tasty & fresh. A step-up from just the pineapple that everybody is used to.

This was a great recipe! Grown-ups and kids alike love it. I made it with a combination of Strawberries and blueberries for a Memorial Day cake and today, I am making it for the 4th of July with blackberries and strawberries. My only complaint with the recipe is probably my own doing - the center of the cake didn't cook through very well, so when I make it today, I will do it in 2 round pans instead of the big 9x13. I am hoping that solves my issue.

I just made this last night and brought in to work... Absolutely fantastic!! My coworkers devoured the whole cake in less than an hour! I used 3 cups total of strawberries and 1/2 cup more marshmallows based off of some other reviews here. Definitely will be put into my "favorites" cookbook! :)

Love this cake, have made it a few times now, I have Celiac and cannot tolerate gluten, so I used a gluten free yellow cake mix, turned out great, I also used 3oz of strawberry gelatin, and have added dry cook and serve pudding (I did not really notice a difference, but may add extra jell) last time I made it I forgot the marshmallows, so maybe the pudding was a good idea that time;-) ... anyway it was also great without the marshmallows, maybe a little more tartness, which I liked! Have one in the oven now with Raspberry pie filling and chocolate cake... we'll see LOL!

I decided to make this for a BBQ we were having at our house.  I read through the reviews and took the advice of those who cut the jell-o to 3oz., sugared and added more strawberries.  It turned out pretty good! Everyone seemed to like it.  My only gripe is that it was a little messy when first done.  We dubbed it Murder Cake, and Blood Cake (LOL) due to the strawberry goo mess I made when trying to flip it out of the pan.  But I left it in the fridge over night and it settled quite nicely.  I will definitely make it again.

I thought this cake was delicious. The fresh strawberries made it all the better. Used strawberry banana jello instead of strawberry because it was all that I had. Tasted great. Very moist. (Also used butter cake instead of yellow cake mix)

My kids and I made this tonight.  I took other reviews and used 3 oz of gelatin.  I also added a little sugar to strawberries while I made the cake to bring out more juice.  My cake cooked in 30 min.  Kids really liked and so did I.  We added whip cream to top.  Could not really taste the marshmellows.

I just made this for a fussy crowd & it was beyond a hit! I was very Leary about putting on so much strawberry gelatin and I'm not a marshmallow fan but I followed the recipe exactly anyway. It's a keeper! I also took a suggestion of cutting the cake in half for a layer cake and covering well with cool whip. I added halved strawberries on the top for decoration and it was beautiful!!!

We loved this cake! Just because you can never have too many strawberries, we added a few extra. Make sure to crush the strawberries well so the jello will mix! Also, we thought it would be fun to decorate the cake with frosting bags, and vanilla ice cream compliments the cake well! This cake is a great cake to make with your family and friends, because it is an easy cake to maintain, and it will always be fun to see the layers! All in all, super easy cake to make.

This is the only recipe I have ever rated on this site, but I just have to say that my family/friends LOVE this cake.  It is SO easy, and SO good!  I didn't change anything....  We like it hot out of the oven, or cold out of the fridge!  Don't forget the whipped topping!

This recipe is fantastic!! I used fresh strawberries and crushed them in the pan with a slotted spoon so I'd have the juice.  I used while cake mix with pudding in the mix.  Put the batter together using the directions for lower cholesterol (1/2 egg substitute, 1/3 c. oil, and 1 1/2 c. water).  All I can say is that EVERYONE is fighting over this cake it's so good!!!! Warm or cold!!  Do yourself a favor and make this cake ASAP!

I've made this cake about a half a dozen times.  It's sooooo yummy.  I wish I had enough people to feed to justify making it more often.  The only caution I have is that it seems to take mine over an hour in the oven before it's done.  My latest is in the oven now.  I used strawberry cake mix for a Valentine's Day Special!

Tastes amazing! I made multiple desserts today and used up all of my 9x13s. I used two 9' circle pans and while the cake layer was a bit thinner, the taste was still amazing!

Easy delicious recipe!  I made this with fresh picked strawberries I pulsed in the blender until there were just a few chunks left.  Took it to the pool to have a dessert and topped it with whipped cream.  Everyone asked for more!

It was DELICIOUS. The only thing I did differently was I mixed 1/4 of the strawberry gelatin in with the cake mix instead of on the crushed strawberries.

The cake was extremely easy to make, came out looking very pretty and tasted good. I made it for a friend's birthday and everyone enjoyed it. The reason I give this recipe only 3 stars is because it does, understandably, taste like a box cake. I will make this cake again only if I'm  very short on time. The slight change I made was to mix some of the gelatin powder in with the strawberries as I was crushing them and to reduce the total amount of gelatin powder by about 1/3

This seemed like kind of a crazy recipe, with the marshmallows, jello, etc.  I enjoyed it, and would consider making it again, although it was not a pretty-looking cake at ALL.  Still, it was moist and pretty tasty.

I'm reviewing this as someone who bakes a lot. The cake tastes like a box cake mix and the fresh strawberries are wasted. Save your time and money and use frozen strawberries.

The only things I changed were to do 3 oz. of the gelatin powder (all I had), and I baked it in a bundt pan for about an hour....SOOOOOO moist and delicious!  I thank the marshmallow and strawberry goodness for that!

My strawberries were really runny. It had a good flavor though. I followed the directions of the recipe. Next time I think I will just slice the strawberries. It is really good with rhubarb, which is how my mom made it while I was growing up. I will make this again.

Loved it! My whole family did! SUPER easy quick cake. I only had orange jello and it worked perfectly! I used a non stick bunt pan and it was so pretty, and came out easy! Would be even better with some whipped cream on top! Thanks for the recipe!

I made mine in a bundt pan with blueberries.  2 cups of smashed blueberries was fine for the bundt pan, however would need to double for a 9 x 13.  Also, I only used 3 oz of blueberry jello, and again if I made it in a 9 x13 the 6 oz would have been my choice.  Awesome desert!

The cake was good but the topping is overdone for me. to tart. Next time I make it, I will only use 3 oz of gelatin. I want to be able to taste the cake as well. And will use more strawberries. Thats the wonderful thing about cooking, you get to make it the way you like it.

This was absoloutely FANTASTIC! Many requests for the recipe, and people keep going on about how great it is. With the strawberries being mashed, the topping did not look very good, so I cut it in half and stacked it as a layer cake, covered it in whipped cream and topped with sliced berries and shaved chocolate. Looked beautiful. Will deffinately be making this again soon.

I'm a bit surprised this has gotten so many 5-star ratings. It's fine, but it's a mix cake with mashed strawberries on 'top' and the berries don't even look that pretty because they're ... mashed up. Again, the taste is good, my 4-year-old loves it, but this isn't award-winning. It's just good. If you're lookin for a good cake that's super easy and a little change of pace, then go for it!

I have to agree with everyone that said it tasted like yellow cake with strawberry jam on top. Now, that's not a bad thing but I couldn't see what the gelatin or marshmallows added to it. It was a quick, easy dessert but nothing special.

Most of the cake stuck to the pan, so it looks horrible.  The taste is just OK for me.  Can't tell that there are marshmallows in it, and I don't think I like the geletin.  Won't be making this again.

I followed the recipe carefully and was rewarded with a flavorful cake; however, I cannot give more than three stars because I was so disappointed with the texture and appearance of the cake.  My version did not emerge looking nearly as fresh and appealing as the one in the photo.  Instead, I got a gloppy, glue-y texture ( If I ever make it again, I'll reduce the amount of the marshmallows).  The texture issue might just be my own personal preference, because my family didn't complain about it at all. Mind you, no one clamored for more cake, either. Also, the berry layer emerged from the oven looking discolored, congealed, and (to me, at least), very unappetizing.  Again, the cake tastes good, but I do not suggest choosing this recipe for a special occasion dessert, where visual impact is important.  Finally, the cake just doesn't keep well.

The flavor on this was great!  Kind of like a jelly filled donut.  I added some extra marshmallows to completely cover the bottom of the pan in a single layer.  The only complaint I have is that the middle of the cake stuck to the pan when I turned it "right side up" so I was stuck trying to piece it back together before I served it.  Thankfully I just made it for my husband, who doesn't really care how things look as long as they taste good.

WOW this was delish!  I really didnt change a thing other than I didnt have yellow cake mix, only butter white.  And I did add a whole bag of marshmallows!  YUM!  I was afraid I added too many bc while looking at it cook, it started bubbling up a little on the top.  But it turned out great!  It took about 45 min til done.  Next time because I loved the strawberry topping, I will add double the strawberries.  The 2 cups of strawberries just made a thin layer.  I saw that others liked it warm and others liked it cold.  I didnt get a chance to eat it warm so I will have to try that next time.  We just ate it cold with lots of whipped cream on top!  SOO GOOD!  This is still great even a couple days later!  A favorite dessert for sure!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  UPDATE:  I have made this again and I loved the way it turned out better than my first attempt.  I used a pint of strawberries, which pretty much results in the 2 cups the recipe states.  I smushed them really good with a little sugar to make lots of liquid but still leaving in chunks of strawberry.  I used cherry gelatin since I didnt have strawberry.  I think any flavor would be great!  I only added a small 3 oz package and it was the perfect amount.  I think the 6 oz. ends up being too much.  I used closer to the amount of marshmallows this time, maybe 4 cups.  I did eat this warm and it is my favorite!  Even tho eating it cold is still good as well!  With extra whipped cream! Great recipe! So easy and delicious!

I love this cake. With whipped cream on top it's like an awesome strawberry shortcake. I followed the recipe exactly. I did spray the pan w/ cooking spray but a small section in the middle still stuck to the pan. Oh well.

Wow! This cake is delicious and so easy to make! Great way to use up overripe strawberries - a 1 lb. carton was just the right amount. Chop them up a bit then put in the blender to "crush." I sprayed my baking dish with Pam but the jello still stuck when I tried to invert. Then I remembered a tip from the aspic and jello-mold days of yore: soak the pan for a minute or so in a jelly roll pan of hot water and it'll pop right out.

Very, very sweet. I found it to be very easy, but way too sweet. Only about half of it went at a large party. Instead of marshamallows someone suggested I use cream cheese instead. I'll have to try that next time.

I thought it was just okay.  I think if the cake was made from scratch rather than a box mix it would be much better.  This is a good recipe if you have strawberries that are getting soft and on their way out because it killed me that I used so many fresh starwberries for this!

I made this cake yesterday.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used sugar free jello.  I was testing it out to see if I could make this for company, and it turned out utterly delicious.  I'm having trouble staying away from it!  My husband loves it too, and he is a little picky.

Yum!  This cake came together so quickly!  I refrigerated it for ~4 hours before it was served.  The topping was very much like refrigerated strawberry preserves, I wish I'd taken it out to warm for 30 minutes first.  Had a few raspberries on hand and tossed them in too!  Yum!  Great with whipped topping or ice cream.  Save a few berries for garnish.  Will certainly make again!  Thanks parealtor313!

This is easy. It looks, smells and tastes good.  I was disappointed in it, I guess I thought I would have a gooey marshmallow layer, but the marshmallows are absorbed into the cake and it is a big fluffy cake with baked strawberry on top. I needed ice cream with this b/c it was too much cake for me.  Made as directed, others really liked it but it was not 5 stars for me.

This cake was super easy, super quick and really tasty. I didn't use 3C marshamallows because I had only 11 large marshmallows in the pantry left. :) I divvied it up and it was fine. I understand it adds a crunch layer, so when I make this cake AGAIN (soon), I'll make sure I have enough marshmallows on hand. I don't think it needs anything like cream or ice cream to make it go down. it's fine as is.

Made this today..YUMMY!! I did use parchment paper and that worked very nicely. I am going to make for a potluck lunch at work.
Has anyone tried this with chocolate cake? I am going to try that the next time I make this.

even sprayed pan, still stuck real bad.  Most of the 'topping' seperated from the cake, had to peel off the pan, ruined apperance & made look unappealing...but still tasted real good, loved the strawberry.   Prob. next time (definately will be a next time), I'll do like some and leave in pan & serve out of frigerator with strawberries on the bottom.

I don't understand how this recipe got such great reviews.  Maybe if you reduced the jello to a small box rather than larger 6 oz.  It was too geled in the strawberry layer.  Strange texture.  Won't be making this again.

Very good! Of course, when I flipped it upside down into another baking pan, it fell apart a little. I just covered it in whipped cream. It tasted great!

Sorry, I don't understand why this recipe got so many great reviews. I followed the recipe to the letter. The strawberry top with the jello in it had an odd texture and tasted like something that you might get in a cafeteria. I'll opt for a more traditional strawberry shortcake next time. If you do make it, add a dollop of whipped cream on top when serving--it helps contrast the gooey strawberry top.

I am giving this a high rating even though my cake did not turn out at all; some of the cake was still delicious.  I strayed from the original recipe, so I do blame myself. I used almost two containers of fresh strawberries and mashed them. This seemed adequate for completely filling the bottom of a 9x13 (not only two cups like the recipe calls for). I also used a little more marshmallows, maybe a quarter of a cup or so. I used a glass 9x13 dish and let it bake. About 35 minutes into it, I checked it. The cake was already getting really brown, so I quickly pulled it to put a toothpick in it. The cake was still very loose in the middle, so I stuck it right back in without even using the toothpick. I put it in a little longer and tried again, but this time I used a toothpick and even though the cake was not solid, the toothpick still came out clean...I figured it was done! I mean, I didn't understand it, but the cake was pretty brown and the toothpick was clean! Well,  not only was the cake not done, but I was missing the cake all together! There wasn't enough cake for strawberries. I did try the part of the cake that was done (and it was absolutely delicious!), but most of it I had to dump :( Well, you live and learn, I suppose. Anyway, my advise, don't go crazy with the strawberries, no matter how tempting it may be (or at least use a bundt pan to ensure more cake to strawberry ratio) and make sure you bake all the way through no matter how clean the toothpick is...LOL

Made exactly as directed and the cake was excellent. My husband was a little leary of it when he saw me putting the marshmallows in the dish (he doesn't care for them) but when it was finished he loved it as well as everyone else. Thinking of trying with other fruit/jello/cake combos.

Definitely recommend using fresh strawberries and experimenting with the jello flavors.  I make the yellow cake from scratch using David's yellow cake recipe on this site.  I love eating this with a little bit of vanilla ice cream on top.

Made as written. Warm or cool, taste is really very good. Definately nothing to look at.  Serve it to someone on a plate with cool whip, whipped cream, or ready whip, looks much nicer. Will make again as written. I forgot about the marshmallows being in the dessert, never noticed them.

Such a simple and delicious recipe! This was such a moist cake!! I cut the calories and fat more by using Betty Crocker Reduced Sugar Yellow Cake Mike and Sugar Free Strawberry Jello. The only thing different I did was added a splash of vanilla extract to the cake mix. It turned out soooooo good. Definitely making this again.

Simple and tasty.  I only had about 2 oz of strawberry gelatin, so I also added a couple ounces of cherry and it turned out fine.  Made it in a bundt pan and used almost a cup less minimarshmallows too.  Had trouble with the cake itself sticking, so I lost the delicious edges of the cake.  Still tasty & different.  My husband liked it a lot! Next time I'll use a square, rectangular, or round pan, though.  Might try it with peaches, too!

I only gave this 4 out of 5 because my husband really didn't like it, my son & I both loved it.  I think I will change it up a little bit and not add so much gelatin to the berries.  I used two 3 oz packs and the first pack seemed to be enough.

I made this for Sunday dinner this weekend and the entire thing was gone before bedtime!!  I was afraid the strawberries would turn brown when baked but the cake was beautiful.  Even my picky-eater, 3-year-old grandson loved it.  Will make this again for sure.

I was very disappointed with this cake. It turned out too sweet, for one thing. I'm not sure of why the marshmallows are in this recipe. Probably won't be making it again.

Very easy & oh so good. Followed the recipe, in my opinion if you don't follow the recipe how can you rate a recipe. I let the cake cool in the frig & then frosted it with cool whip. Took it to a cookout & everyone loved it. By the way had no problem with it coming out of the pan nicely, I used a 9x13 pan, the recipe didn't call for a bundt pan.

This recipe is simply the best if you love strawberries.  You can make it just the way it's written and it is awesome.  Brought it to work today for a birthday, and I had rave reviews.  Don't be intimidated by turning the cake out of the pan.  I greased it slightly with a little butter and ran a knife around it.  Make sure it is totally cooled down.  This cake is definitely a keeper!!!

First of all this recipe is very easy and quick to make.  I did not crush the berries, just finely diced and layed in the pan.  All I had was sugar-free jello, so that is what I used.  I used a vanilla cake mix made the way I always make a box mix - with 2 cups water, vanilla pudding mix and 4 eggs.  It baked beautifully in 40 minutes and after sitting for 10 minutes, I flipped it and it slid right out.  It is very pretty and makes a great presentation.  The strawberry part is a little tart, but I think that will go nicely with the addition of a little sweetened whipped cream that I plan on serving with it.

This was really good and easy to make.  I only gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons.  1 - it really needed more than 2 cups of strawberries, IMO.  It needed at least 1 more cup of smashed berries to cover the bottom of the pan, maybe closer to 2 extra cups.  I wanted to have plenty of berries.  Also, while it's ok with the yellow cake mix, it would really be better with a scratch cake.  I hadn't used a box mix in at least 20 years, and there's something in the flavor of yellow cake mixes that I still don't care for.  Since I wanted something sweet, really quickly, decided to try it, and it was ok, but still, could be better.  I'll try it next time with the cake from another upside down cake recipe.  Still a great idea and people really enjoyed it.

I made this exactly as written.  It came out of the pan easily which I was a little worried about.  I can't taste the marshmallows at all.  They completely melted and you'd never know they were there.  This is tasty, but I don't know if I'd make it again.  There are too many other ways to use strawberries.

My daughter loved this cake, but most of us adults thought it was too sweet.  I used half the amount of Jello and served with Cool Whip.  Next time I may use fewer marshmallows or omit them altogether.

This was a great and beautiful cake.  I baked the cake in 3 7-in round pans and layered them.  I topped with Extra Creamy Cool Whip.  It turned out beautiful and delicious.  (check out the photos for this recipe, mine is included) I used frozen strawberries and chopped them in my food processor; they were a little juicy when I put them on the bottom of the pans.  I then sprinkled each pan with the dry Jello and followed with marshmallows. I used a little more berries and marshmallows than called for so I had a good layer of each in each pan. I then poured in the cake batter.     I do have to say that when baking I had to have faith that the cake would come out as well as the All Recipe members said in the reviews.  The cake bubbled and looked very odd when baking, but in the end it turned out great!  BTW, I did not spray my non stick pans with any cooking spray and the cakes came out of the pan fine.

This was a wonderful cake.  I had no problems with the recipe as written.  I did not spray the cake pan and it didn't stick.  My husband gives out very few 5 stars.  This was a resounding 5 star from him and also from me.  Thanks parealtor313 for the wonderful recipe.  I can't wait to take it to our next pot luck dinner at church.

Very good!!! I bought two 3 oz. pkgs of strawberry gelatin because 6oz just seemed like alot.  Once I poured the first pkg in it seemed like more than enough, so I didn't use the other one.

Made this cake for dessert today.  It's wonderful.  I didn't have a yellow cake or a white cake so I used a strawberry cake mix(had one on hand) and it turned out really well.  Tasty, but not too sweet.  Put a little cool whip on top.  Will definely make again.  Very quick and easy to make.

Oh, this  was   a  great  cake  to  make,  I  made this  yesterday  and  I  may  have 1-2  servings  left!  I  made  it  with the  three cups  of  mini  marshmallows  but  I  have  to ask,  why?  A  lot  of  people  couldn't  even  tell  that  it  was  in.  When  I  make  it  again,  I  may  try  it  without  marshmallows  and  a  different  type  of  cake,  we'll  see.  A  GREAT  cake  now  matter  how  it's  made.

This cake was FANTASTIC!!  THANK YOU!!  i did not crush the strawberries, instead I quartered them.  I used Sugar Free Jell-O and it turned out & tasted FABULOUS!!  I also used an extra cup of marshmallows...still PERFECTION! I think I will try this with Raspberries or Mandarin Oranges - - then you won't have to crush them.

This topped the chart today for our Mother's Day celebration.  I followed the direction of one of the other reviewers who cut the cake and half and made it into a layer cake.  I frosted it with cool whip and it was amazing.  Very tasty!!!

So yummy, very easy to make. Everyone loved it. I used French Vanilla cake mix, it's what I had in the cabinet. It still worked. Definitely will go into my recipe rotation.

This was really good, but a little zingy with the jello. I might put less jello in next time. Topping with whipped cream from a spray can helps balance out the taste though.

This cake is really, really good.  I have made it twice now and the second time i used a lemon cake mix.  The next one that i bake i think i'm going to add pineapple chunks!  Such a versatile recipe, you can do just about any fruit you like.

I substituted David's Yellow Cake from this site for the box mix because I refuse to buy box mix. I skipped the marshmallows because I didn't have any. I did not miss them.  The cake recipe and this strawberry recipe I think would make two 9x5x3" (rough measurement) pans nicely. I only used one and had extra batter and a layer of strawberries that was a bit too thick. Halving it would have worked better. I didn't think I had enough batter to do a 9x13 pan.  I might cut back on the jello mix next time as the strawberry mixture is WAY too sweet for me. Then again, the two 9x5x3 pans may solve this problem.   I can only give this 2 stars as the ultra-sweet-artificial flavor of the Jello mix completely ruined and overwhelmed the fresh, tart, sweet, juicy strawberries much to my dismay. I don't think I will be making this again, rather looking for a recipe that better highlights fresh strawberries.  My cake came out like photo #8, but I want it to look like #3.

Just made it and it turned out great! I wasn't too sure how it would turn out while I watched it cook- but it was perfect. It tastes amazing to eat it while the strawberries are still warm! Fun and easy to bake!

I made this cake for my family last night and it is wonderful. I used the butter recipe cake and left out the marshmallows because i dont like them. Also after i crushed my strawberries, they were still pretty dry so i added just a sprinkle of water. I topped mine with vanilla ice cream. It would be great with whipped cream also. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for a small group, and everyone thought it was good...the only problem I had was that the toothpick came out clean, but when I cut into it, the middle was still unbaked.  Next time, I'll bake it longer (although the top was pretty brown as it was).  The taste was good though.  I don't know if it will go into my regular rotation of desserts, but I'm glad I tried it for something different.

I used frozen crushed strawberries. We all loved it!  I only used a 3 ounce package of strawberry gelatin by mistake but it still tasted great. I added i can of drained crushed pineapple too. Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this cake for my nephew because he loves strawberries, he loved it and so did the rest of the family.  I was a little skeptical of  the ingredients since I dont like marshmallows or jello but you really could not tell either were in the cake at all.

I have made this cake a couple of times now and each time it was a big hit. The last one I made was with blueberries, so I changed the jello to a mixed berry and used a french vanilla cake mix instead of the golden. It turned out wonderfully.

What a pretty cake.  It deserves 10 stars for presentation.  It didn't go over too well around here.  The cake itself was good but we didn't groove with the strawberry topping. Tasted too much like a box of strawberry jello was dumped on top, go figure.

This was fun to make with my hubby and step-daughter.  It tastes better after its refrigerated.  If I make it again, I'll add a little sugar to the strawberries if they're tart.  This will be a good holiday treat because of it's color, but it's not going to enter my normal dessert rotation.  I'm just too much of a chocolate gal!

LOVE THIS CAKE!!!! It was so easy and delicious! I didn’t have any mini marshmallows so I cut up some of the big ones. I also used Strawberry Crush soda instead of water in the cake mix. I thought it would add more strawberry flavor to the cake. I know that I will make this cake again soon!!

I made this as written for the most part. I read a lot of the reviews  and added extra strawberries. This is delicious. I took the advice of a reviewer and sprinkled sugar before mashing. This was a great suggestion.  Next time I will put in a smaller pan, as I like my cake thicker.  Other than that,  I will make it again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My family and friends loved it.  I would say 4 1/2 stars because it did seem to need a topping.  We used whipped topping.   Ice cream would be good too.  Other than that, it is a great summer dessert and I'll take it to other functions.  Next time I might add some walnuts or pecans for a little bit of crunch.

I was excited to make this recipe but I was extremely disappointed. I absolutely agree with others that it tasted exactly  like strawberry jam smeared on cake. The jello was very very sweet. Too sweet! I should have listened to my instincts. 6 oz of jello? If I try this again, I will only sprinkle a very small amount of jello over the strawberries, less than one ounce. Or perhaps omit it altogether. Also, nobody could even taste or noticed the marshmallows. I suggest omitting those as well. We ended up scraping all the topping off the cake and ate the plain cake with cool whip!

My mother in law used to make this cake and it was amazing! When she made it, she used frozen strawberries and let them thaw completely. She mixed the jello into the thawed strawberries so there was plenty of juice/liquid to absorb the jello. She also added more marshmallows and topped each serving with a dollop of whipped cream! Ahhhh the wonderful memories this brings back! Can’t wait to make this cake again!

It was a hit and a great recipe to use if you have a lot of strawberries that need to be used.  Easy, a little tart, so I recommend the whipped topping or ice cream.  Great recipe!

While the recipe is great as is,  it's even better if you use a different cake mix.  My favorite so far is using a Lemon cake to make a Strawberry Lemonade Cake.   I've also used Chocolate and it tastes very similar to a chocolate covered strawberry.

I thought this was a delicious summer dessert! I covered a 9X13 Pyrex with foil and lightly sprayed it with cooking spray (the kind for baking) then added the strawberries with some sugar to make a juice before adding the Jello. I found it was best to refrigerate the cake after baking and then flip it out of the Pyrex and the foil was much easier to remove. I decorated with additional strawberries and some blueberries.

I made this cake just as directed.   It was very good.  The strawberry, marshmello & jello made  kind of a sticky texture on top that I was not expecting.  That being my only complaint it was very good with cool whip topping.

This dessert tasted amazing!!!! My husband and I loved it! I read that some people said it didn’t have enough strawberries and I had plenty of them to use so I used 4 cups. I used part of a 3 ounce package of strawberry jello and a 3 ounce package of raspberry jello because it was all I had on hand. I mixed the powedered jello in with the strawberries to make sure it was mixed in well. The raspberry flavor gave it a tartness that I thought went well with the sweetness of the strawberries and marshmallows. I really wondered how it was all going to taste in the end with the jello and marshmallows but it was SO GOOD! I’m definitely making this again.

I made 1 change and it turned out great. I had no jello so I used sugar and unflavored gelatin.  Next time I will try it with the Jello but it was delicous and my finicky husband and grandchildren loved it! Will make it again.

I did not makek it exactly as written. I used the suggestions of a few of the other reviewers. I used almost 3 cups of strawberries on the bottom to completely cover the pan. 3oz (I would never have used 6) of gelatin covered this perfectly. The cake out very strawberry shortcake-like. My husband lost his mind. I had to hide the cake. This cake would do well at a potluck. Due to the moist nature of the strawberries bake a couple of minutes longer than suggested.

Made this just now using almost exact ingredients.  I did use only 3oz of Jello as others suggested. I decided to bake it per the time on the cake box vs the suggested time so as to not overbake. My total time was 29 minutes. It was moist & perfect. Very easy & yummy cake. Topped it with cool whip. Will make again for sure & likely mix up the fruit & jello just to experiment. I used a glass 9x13 sprayed with Pam. Came out very easily. Thx for such an easy, yummy cake.

Surprisingly good. I'm glad the marshmallows aren't evident in the final product. Very sweet, but my whole family liked this recipe.

I made this using a gluten free (GF) cake mix. The volume of most GF mixes is less than a regular cake mix. I will bake it in a 10” square pan next time, or use 2 boxes of GF mix. It was delicious.

My family liked but not loved the cake. I was underwhelmed. I followed exact recipe. First, do NOT mash your strawberries if you want a presentable cake unless you are making for Halloween and present as a blood and brains cake.  Marshmellows for me, did not raise to the top nor become 'crunchy' and that was the part I was looking forward to.

Made it for a family dinner. Everyone loved it!  Make it one day, cover it, put in refrigerator and serve it the next day.  Sooo good and fresh tasting.  Don't change it.

This was the first time I have ever baked.  It was for a dinner party.  Fabulous, delicious, beautiful...served it with vanilla ice cream.  Nobody believed I had never baked.  Fruit is interchangeable so there are lots of options.

We enjoyed this desert. The strawberries were cut into small chunks sprinkling them with sugar to help bring the juice out. I wound up adding another cup of berries as they did not cover the pan bottom. Another cup of marshmallows was added as well. I used a potato masher on the berries which worked well. The dessert was done in 40 minutes in my oven. The only issue I had was what to do with it when it had cooled? I could not think of anything to turn it out on so left it in the baking pan. We flipped individual pieces over when serving. I may cut back on the jello next time as it seems like a lot however the strawberry flavor  was not overly artificial. I will defiantly make this again and recommend the extra berries and marshmallows.

I omitted the marshmallows, but otherwise followed the recipe, which came out very well. I will make this again, but will increase the amount of strawberries  by another cup or so.  I topped the finished dessert with whipped cream.

The only thing I regret is NOT taking a picture of this awesome desert BEFORE it was devoured!! Some of the comments were ‘amazing, delicious, refreshing...’.  So the cake really was all that...  I did not make any changes  to the original recipe and  we experienced a lovely and refreshing cake.. my friends all want the recipe and i am only too happy to provide it.  
I will be making this cake again and again... also using some variations of fruit during the upcoming summer months.  Thank you for this wonderful twist on an ‘upside down’ cake..  
ps...next time I’m taking a pic!!!
5/10/18  made this amazing cake again for Mothers Day weekend. And now I’ve got proof!

I just made it this weekend, the flavor is really good however I would change a few things next time I make it.  First off I'd mix the strawberries and jello together and let sit for a about 5 minutes; next I would bake it for about 35  minutes or until center is set.  I followed the baking time and the top was overbrowned, I had to lay foil over it for the last 10 minutes.  I think the cake was already done well before that.  It was still good, just next time I'll make these adjustments. :)

It was very tasty, but the marshmellows created huge bubbles, I had to open the door a few times & stab them so it didn't overflow. It said bake for 40-50 mins. It was done in 30-35 mins.

This recipe was awesome! I just made this today and it turned out beautifully! Next time, I will add a little lemon juice and a splash of vanilla to the fresh sliced strawberries just as a preference. I mashed them slightly and used about 2 teaspoons of sugar.

Despite all the great reviews, I thought it was only average on flavor.  The large packet of jello seemed like a lot.  There wasn't as much  cake as I would have liked.  It wasn't bad, just not great. It was easy to make and smelled fabulous while baking.

I will definitely make this again. I had a little challenge of keeping the strawberries from running off the top when I flipped it, but just quickly placed it in the fridge. I took it to an extended-family dinner and it was a huge hit with whipped topping. I made it two days in a row since it was so popular!

I actually made this with a white cake mix ( my preference) and in a Bundt pan. It turned out very good, everybody loved it. I also served it with freshly made whipped cream!!

I made it with frozen strawberries, it turned out okay, but I think next time it will be fresh berries. Tastes really good, not sweet tasting at all.

This is definitely a sweet-tooth lovers cake!  I added more crushed strawberries to completely cover the bottom of my 13 x 9 pan and I made  the yellow cake from scratch.  The cake was moist and delicious, although way too rich for us to have more than a couple of bites.  My husband took it to work the next day; one of his coworkers accused him of trying to kill him with sugar (smile).

So good so good so good!! I didn't think this recipe was going to work.. I used big marshmallows, didn't measure the jello, used a homemade cake recipe and had to mix marachino cherries with the strawberries because I didn't have enough of them... no worries! It was absolutely wonderful.

I wish I'd read all the one-star reviews before I decided to make this!  But the picture looks so good,  strawberries were on sale,  and the reviews I read said it was easy and delicious.  If I had time to make something else before tonight's gathering I would.   I had to drain off 1/4 cup of liquid before I dared to turn it onto the serving dish -- and discovered the strawberry topping  is unappetizingly pale. I can only hope it doesn't taste as bad as it looks!

I made it the day after I read the recipe.  I had a lot of frozen raspberries from the garden.  I used about 3 cups of defrosted mashed raspberries, unsweetened.  A small box of raspberry Jell-O.  The top looked like it was getting too dark after about 30 minutes (my oven is OFF), I lowered the temp and increased the time an additional 10 minutes.  I did line the baking pan with parchment paper, bottom and up the sides.   It was really good, both room temp and from the fridge, with some whipped cream!  This is something that I will be able to bring to pot lucks.  I can see why some of the reviewers repeatedly made this cake........ I will too.

Just made this and it looks beautiful!  My nibbles taste amazing!  So I am a cook from scratch kinda girl and decided to make homemade yellow cake batter.  I also used raspberry jello instead of strawberry. It smelled awesome cooking. Can’t have a piece yet, it’s for my husband’s birthday tomorrow. Will update then, might get another star.

I made this and it was good, albeit super sweet.  I prefer deserts to be more savory, than BAM! sweetness!   So, 3 stars because I don't regularly make store bought cakes, made this to accompany a cookout I attended.  I should add again this is a super sweet desert, definitely not diabetic friendly.  Also, I felt like I wasted so many delicious strawberries for a desert that was just "good".

Made it just as in the recipe and it wasn't as I expected.  The cake part is a little dry (for me) and the strawberries with the jello didn't seep through the batter as I thought it would.  I don't have much luck with cakes anyway, so maybe it was just me.  Maybe with ice cream.

I made this without the marshmallows, using frozen strawberries and white cake mix. I know it's not even the same recipe but it was delicious just like that.... i used what I had... frozen strawberries, strawberry Jell-O and white cake mix. Delicious.

It was very good but I think it needs more strawberries on top and next time I won't mash them all; will eave some mashed and some whole.  Great with vanilla ice cream.

This is a very easy cake to make when you have strawberries that need used up. My family loved it too! I did make a small change.  I used 1 packet of plain gelatin and 1/4 cup of sugar instead of jello. This is pretty close to the same as using a 3 oz packet of gelatin minus the artificial flavoring. I thought I had strawberry jello in my pantry but didn't. The substitution worked perfectly.

I made it for the first time yesterday .  I followed the directions except that I only used 3oz of jello because that was all I had on hand.  It was moist and delicious.  I was afraid to turn it over because it was for a party so I just covered in cool whip and put a spoon in it.  I'll be making it again:)

Although flavorful it did not turn out as planned. 1. It stucked to the pan so we had to just slice it like regular cake and turn upside down as individual slice and 2. The strawberrys were not quite enough. ..perhaps extra cup would make the difference. I followed recipe exactly so I am not sure what went wrong. However the cake is easy and taste amazing!

Very easy to make and quite tasty considering how simple the ingredients.  I only used one container of fresh strawberries, but think it would be even better with more.  I also used only about 3/4 the bag of jello per other reviews, and would use all of it if added more strawberries.  I am thinking it would tasty if you made using strawberries and crushed pineapple.

Made this for a family get together and everyone loved it. I used about 2 1/2 cups of strawberries  (don't measure until crushed) and added fresh sliced strawberries  to the top for appearance once it was done baking and flipped. Will definitely make again.

very disappointed in this cake. I agree with others who said it was a waste of fresh strawberries. The jello made it taste artificial. I thought it was an easy recipe, that is why I decided to give it a try. I usually make my own strawberry glaze, and thought this would be similar, IT WAS NOT. Once I began to sprinkle the Jello over the strawberries I knew it was a mistake, so I only used about 1/3 of Jello. The cake was not pretty, I would never take it to a gathering. I'm not sure how it got so many good reviews. I was expecting more of a fresh strawberry taste with all those strawberries. I think it tasted more like Little Debbie Strawberry rolls, so if you like those then its ok. My kids ate it with whipped cream, I didn't finish my piece. Maybe without the Jello it would be better. I will not try it again. I'll do the extra work and stick to my own recipe.

Followed recipe for the strawberries but changed a few things. Made yellow cake from scratch so it left me with 3 large egg whites, I made a thick and fluffy meringue that I covered the cooked upside down cake then torched it to a nice golden finish. Used a 9 by 13 baking dish added double the strawberries. I got to try it before the family polished it off and then went to garden to get more strawberrys so I would make them another.

As a proficient baker, I was very unhappy with the end result.  Followed the recipe to a "T" & the cake was okay at first, but after a couple of hours, got very, very soggy and gloppy.  I had to throw it away.  I'm sorry, but this was a waste of time, effort & money.

The kids love this, the adults love this. It's a great snack cake/ dessert without being overwhelmingly heavy. I used the 3 oz.  Jell-O packet, sliced the strawberries and 'muddled' them with the powder, and chilled the entire thing in the pan after baking to firm up. I also don't bother with flipping it out of the pan - just flip when you serve!

Very simple to make. I would suggest maybe two cake mixes as one didn't see a lot  to cover all the strawberries.  I fell asleep and forgot to flip it over and it wouldn't come out of pan once it cooled.  So I just put frosting on the top and everyone loved it.

This cake was delicious!  I made it for memorial day so I added some blueberries to the top left corner and whipped cream stripes going across the cake.  I would say make sure you measure the strawberries after they are crushed, I measured before and after, there was a considerable difference so I adjusted accordingly and had the right amount.

Made this for Mother's Day and it was a hit. My grandson had two big pieces which is unusual for him. Only thing I did different was I used only one box of jello cause that was all I had and it still turned out yummy. Diffently making again and again.

Great recipe !!  
I bought a large container of fresh strawberries and after crushing them,  decided to use them all which resulted in a nice layer of berries in the bottom of my 9 X 13.  
Turned out wonderful !   I will make this cake again,  and I will always use more berries than called for.
Thank you so much for this recipe !!

This was a very easy recipe. Since my husband puts strawberry jam on cakes anyway this was a no-brainer! I think I'll try it with raspberries and chocolate cake next time.

I crushed the strawberries in the food processor.  Added sugar free strawberry jello directly to the strawberries and stirred.  Only problem I had was the cake stuck in places when I turned it upside down.  Maybe I needed more than 15 min. cooling?  It is delicious and I would make it again.

Ok.  Not great.  If I make it again - many more strawberries are needed.  used unflavored geletin - which got hard after a couple of days in the refrigerator.   Maybe would be ok if you expected the whole cake to be gone in 1 day.

I made it with white cake mix and whole eggs and about a pound and a half of strawberries, which I combined with sugar, as I had seen in several reviews.  I baked it in two 9 inch round cake pans and it took about 37 minutes to bake.  I thought I could stack the layers, but that was a mistake.  The top layer split wide open.  Still, We couldn't wait till it cooled to try it.  It was delicious warm, but no doubt will be even better cooled.   Next time I'll do one layer.  Some thought the jello was too sweet and/or too artificial tasting, but we thought it was fine.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  Where did the marshmallows go?  We couldn't even tell they were there.

Update...I was right, it really was better cool.  It was delicious!  But sadly, it is all gone.  We had it for Mother's Day.

I thawed frozen strawberries added a little sugar and a splash of vanilla and puréed them...I proceeded with the rest of the recipe! It's really tasty! However I think I added a little too many mini marshmellows-they float to the top and form a crusty chewy layer interesting texture... I will tweek the recipe again with something next time I make it :)

Easy cake to make and the family loved it.   Took it to a pot luck dinner, adding a dollop of whipped topping for looks to each square as it was cut.  Went over well.  Will make again.

I made this and the picture is deceptive it doesn't have the fresh look as indicated. I brought home from work potluck 3/4 of the cake. Was a waste of good money and time. Would be better if just bake cake then pour fresh sweetened berries over top!!!!!!!!

My family loves when I make this cake. At least no more than a few hours. Definitely disappear over night. I normally make it for special occasions and I never seem to get any of my creations.

I made this exactly as instructed and it was not only delicious, but easy!  Served it with real whipped cream.  Everyone loved it. I think I may try it with white cake and blueberries next time.

I just really wanted to love this cake. But, alas--nope. I made it exactly as written, no adjustments. What I got was, well, a white cake topped with jello. The flavor was not bad, but how can you argue with the flavor of strawberries? The marshmellow stuff was odd as it came out of the oven, then it did disappear into--yes--the jello stuff, apparently. All I can say is I'm not sorry we tried it. Nobody wanted any of it again, that's very telling.

I used a strawberry cake mix instead of a yellow cake mix. Make sure you let the strawberries sit for a while after sprinkling the the release the juices. Came out great. I'll have to try it with yellow to see the difference. I normally make my cakes from scratch instead of mixes, will try that also.

I loved this recipe! But I do agree with some of the other reviewers that 2cups of crushed strawberries is not enough. The only changes that I made were that I added 3 1/2 cups of crushed strawberries, and to the cake 1 tsp of Madagascar vanilla and lemon zest. It was fabulous!!

Was dissapointed. The cake did not cook fully in the middle, and the edges appeared burnt. I prepped according to recipie, won't make again. A great idea, but I'll stick to strawberry short cake!

The jello made it too strong tasting.
I lightly sprayed my glass pan  and it did not stick at all. I would omit the jello completely and instead mix the strawberries with a strawberry glaze. Will not make again.

I made this more because I was intrigued by the marshmallows. It was surprisingly tasty but not nearly as delicious as I thought it would be. It was very good when I added vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup.

This is a variation of the old Pillsbury Strawberry Shortcut Cake that has been around for over 30 years. The original was a made from scratch cake. It called for mixing two 10 oz. pkgs. frozen sliced strawberries with juice, thawed, with one 3-oz. pkg. jello in bowl. Let sit while you prepare cake. Then you put only 1 c. marshmallows (I used 2 c.) in bottom of well-greased 13x9 pan, mixed the cake, and poured it over the marshmallows. Finally, pour the strawberry mixture evenly over the cake batter. Bake about 40-50 minutes at 350°. It did not call for turning the cake out of the pan.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the instructions exactly.  The strawberry topping with the marshmellos, jello and berries tasted like a cake with jam spread over the top.  Definitely not a keeper.

After reading the reviews I had very high expectations. After making it, I agree it was good but not great. It doesn't exactly have great visual presentation either. I followed many of the suggestions for adjustment and was glad I did. I will keep the recipe but not as a family favorite.

The cake turned out great but, with the marshmallows melting when heated I found it hard to tell when cake was done. Not enough to deter me from making this again-----as I will in 1hour.

I love strawberries in everything, but this strawberry upside down cake was terrible.  The strawberry part was like rubber with the jello in it and the cake was very heavy and didn't rise.  I followed the recipe exactly and I think the amount of jello may be a mistake.

Taste great and was very moist.  Mine didn't turn out so pretty but I think that's because I didn't have a flat platter and didn't center it very well so it kind of crunched up.  But who cares?!!!  I wasn't entering it in an art competition.  We gobbled it up so fast that no one would have known if it had looked pretty to begin with! I will definitely make it again!

Tried this recipe yesterday for a pot luck.  Washing and hulling the strawberries took the most time.  But otherwise pretty easy. I did not like the taste of the cake at all.  I wonder if a white cake would have been better, it LOOKS like white cake in the picture and not a yellow.  My husband liked the cake very much, but was surprised it was strawberries and not cherries.  Another person mentioned also, they thought it was cherries.  I won't be making this again.  There are others out there that are better.

This was pretty good.  It was very moist and my company really liked it.  It needed a little something more but not sure what it is, but still it was good. We put coolwhip on the top of it.

The recipe as is gets 3 stars because it seemed too sweet & messy flipping on the platter.  I will try again though using a 3 oz package of jello.

This cake is really good.  I used strawberry cake mix in exchange for What it called for.  I also used strawberries that were already in sugar that I had in the refrigerator.  So Yummy!

I found this recipe for my daughter to make for a school project.  She needed something this color and texture.  When we looked at the ingredients I was pretty sure it would be uber-sweet and not to our liking. Boy were we wrong! The two of us cut the shapes for her project and afterwards licked our fingers and WoW! we ate every scrap and scraped the pan.  We made it for a second presentation and decided it was not fair not to make one for ourselves so we finally did..  The cake has come out every time perfectly. This cake is such a treat-even for a grown-up(not at all what I was expecting) The marshmallows bubble up through the cake making it super moist and the berries and jello make a gooey delishious jam like topping. Don't forget the whipped cream :)

I used half blueberries and half raspberries (3 cups per previous reviews) and raspberry flavored gelatin.  You couldn't really taste the blueberries, but the cake was delicious! It could have used more fruit than even the 3 cups. Next time I will add whip cream, which I think would make it taste better.

This was so good!  Perfect summer dessert and I think I like it better than the normal strawberry shortcake.  It does need to be eaten pretty quick though cause after sitting in the fridge for a couple days the strawberries get kinda mushy.

I made this cake 3 times since I got the recipe last month.  It's easy but tastes really special.  It comes out of the pan much more easily than I had initially expected.  Lots of compliments, highly recommend.

It was good, not a 4 or 5 star but still good.  This definitely needs Whipped Cream or Vanilla ice cream.  Best eaten warm.

We didn't have yellow cake mix, so I used chocolate--the cake was devoured.  I used ripe juicy strawberries, and sliced them instead of mashing, and used only 2 cups of mini-marshmallows (that was all I had).  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  It is not gorgeous, but the taste makes up for it.  My family loved it.

This is wonderful!  Easy to make.  I did not mash the strawberries; just cut them up and layered the bottom of the pan (at least 3-4 cups).  I will definately make this again.  My family loved it!

AWESOME!!!!  EASY!!!!!!!   I made a 8 x 8 cake because there was only going to be 5 people -- everybody loved it!   I also used a small snack size all natural strawberry applesauce ( = 1/3 cup of applesauce) in the cake mix to help make it lower fat. It was soooo easy to make.  Awesome to make after strawberry picking!!! Thanks so much parealtor313!!!

This cake was way too sweet! I used fresh strawberries and followed the recipe without alterations. I do not recommend using 6 oz of strawberry gelatin! The gelatin gave the strawberries a fruit roll-up type texture and the sugar from the gelatin along with the marshmallows was over powering with sweetness. Not even whipped cream could save this recipe. I gave it 3 stars since my co-workers ate most of it, but I feel they were just being polite.

This is so fast and easy to make with an awesome end result.  I used strawberries, blueberries and rhubarb.  I did mash the strawberries, added about 1/2 cups blueberries and cut up rhubarb which I parboiled with a about a tablespoon of sugar.  The blueberries added a little more color when the cake was turned over.  I grow rhubarb and it was in season.  It really added a lot of flavor.  Topped it with whipped topping and it was delicious.

I have made this cake several times and it is a hit everytime. It is so easy to make and that is always a plus in my book. I sometimes add blueberries to it but I think it would taste wonderful with other fruits too!!

I made this last month  for the first time and served it to my family and grand-daughter. They are my critics.  If thet like it I keep it.  Well needless to say I am making it again for another get together. It is delicious and so moist. I did not adjust the recipe at all and I serve it with whipped cream. TRY IT YOU'LL LOVE IT !

This was okay. I had no problems with it sticking(and I used a bundt pan). I think I just prefer my strawberries uncooked.  We had no problems making this disappear! Try it!

Vivid appearance and very easy to make.  Agree with reviewers who suggested adding a little sugar to strawberries for added liquid to soak up the gelatin and making layers, stacking and topping with Cool Whip.  Also, might try it next time with orange gelatin paired with mandarin oranges and pineapple.

This was very easy to make...even after having 5 pina coladas! It was a little "rubberish" from the gelatin...I think. Was not the prettiest either. The kids liked it though.

I was a bit hesitant after seeing that half of the reviews were not happy with this recipe.  But overall, it turned out just fine.  I did use parchment paper to line the bottom of the pan and I sprinkled a little sugar on the strawberries.  I also did not crush the strawberries completely- just enough for a little juice.  The cake was a very golden brown before it finished baking.  But it didn't seem to affect the taste.  Wish I could substitute something else for the marshmallows.

This worked for what I made it for, but I don't think I'll make it again. I had some "too ripe" strawberries that I needed to cook with, so this recipe served it's purpose for that. I think I could have done without the gelatin and marshamllows though. I don't think they added anything to the flavor and gave the cake a gummy consistancy that was a little weird - not to mention the fake strawberry flavor that was not needed.

AMAzING. Everyone loved it. Doubled the strawberries, used lots of Pam to grease my glass dish. Used 1 1/2 large bags of mini marshmallow and topped it off with trader joes vanilla cake mix. AMAZING

SO I think I did something wrong because the cake was done on the top and really mushy at the strawberries. It was not fluffy. I think my strawberries  had too much liquid in them, which soaked into the cake and made it dense and mushy. One reviewer said to make sure the strawberries had a lot of juice but you need to be careful with that! I will try again but use some sliced and mashed combined.

Delicious cake.  I baked this in a 13.9 inch pan with a yellow"pudding in the mix" cake-mix to spread on top of the mashed strawberries, jello and miniature marshmallows.  Baking time was 55 minutes at 350 degrees F.  I was able to easily turn the cake over on a flat dish which came with my microwave oven.  The cake is long so I was lucky to have a dish it fit on - but it slipped right out.  It's delicious!

Fantastic recipe and so easy.  I divided it into two 9 inch pans and did not need as many marshmallows b/c of the size of the pan- only 2 C.  What a great summer cake to whip up!

Quick & delish! I'm not sure what purpose the marshmallows serve other than sweetening the strawberries so I'll probably skip them (& the extra calories) next time. I love the idea of tweaking the traditional upside down cake and may branch out to other berries or fruit in the future. This recipe has opened a new door for me, brilliant!

This recipe was even better after it had been refrigerated overnight.I just gave the strawberries a while in the food processor, and they were nice and juicy. Since I couldn't find a 6 ounce (170 gram) package of strawberry jello, I got two 80 gram packages and used it all ;) I made my own cake mix from scratch (see Socttley's Basic Yellow Cake Recipe on AR). Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was a good recipe.  I used a French Vanilla cake mix, and added the zest of two limes for flavour (to make it like a Strawberry Daiquiri cake).  The marshmallows completely disappeared on me though, no crunch or anything.

I wish I would have added some sugar to the strawberries.  It was too tart for me, but my husband like it.   The topping could of had a little more moisture to it too.  I will make again, but will add sugar to the strawberries and not had the full box of jello.

Yummy with vanilla ice cream -- we're going to try different fruit/gelatin combinations after this success. My favorite part was the marshmallows that floated to the top and formed a little crunchy crust. My strawberries were still a little tart, so we used a bit more marshmallows than called for and it provided the right balance of tart vs. sweet. Fun recipe!

I made this a few weeks ago for a family dinner.  It was awesome.  I lined to bottom of the pan with parchment paper.  Let cool for about 15 minutes, then flipped.  Came out PERFECT!!  I then stored it in the refrigerator.  I served it cold that night with cool whip.  But it was even better served heated in the microwave for about 25 seconds with cool whip.  Either way it was great. Just depends on your tastes!! I can't wait to make it again!

Cake was excellent. You can also make it in a smaller dish for a thicker cake, but I would suggest using a little less on the topping. I will make this again in the future! Thanks for sharing :-)

The strawberries I had were hard and had no juice in them so the berry layer was not good. I used a butter yellow cake mix, but a white mix should have been used.  The cake collapsed when I removed it from the oven.  I used a metal 9x13 pan and wonder if I should have used a glass pan instead.  I believe if you had fresh picked ripe strawberries this cake would be very good.  I will not make this cake again.

Okay but not great.  Followed the recipe exactly and used fresh strawberries, pared them and put in a bowl with sugar to get juicy.  The cake did not have any strawberry flavor, and the topping was pretty but didn't have any strawberry flavor either.  It was pretty but disappointing.  This cake tastes like something from a mediocre restaurant, the recipe needs some work.

Made this for the Memorial Day picnic and it was enjoyed by all.  Very good , moist cake.  The marshmallows get soaked into the cake batter and create a dense, flavorful cake.  I took a poll and we decided on 4 stars.  Will definitely make again, maybe with blueberries or raspberries.

A neighbor brought this cake over for a BBQ this weekend and it was wonderful.  Then she told me how simple it was, and I could not believe it!  I would never have guessed that there was jello and marsh mellows at all.  I plan to add blueberries and make this a festive looking 4th of July dessert!

I made this for our Memorial Day picnic and it was a huge hit!  Eveyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe.  Thanks for a quick and simple way to use our abundance of strawberries.

Very good.  The marshmallows give the cake moisture and sweetness which nicely offsets the slight tartness of the strawberries.  But I agree with others who have said you need a dallop of whip cream, and also, it looks better served individually.

Was good.  Cake was perfectly dense and moist.  My girlfriend adds an extra cup of strawberries and says it makes a huge difference.  My husband loved it but I will not make again.  Just didn't do it for me.

Hah! My son told me, "I'm not going to like this" because he hate strawberries...however, he LOVED this desert! My oldest would have eaten it all by herself if I let her! I cannot wait to make this for a get together.  So simple and great tasting!!

This was a very good, easy recipe. I have never been a big fan of yellow cake mix, so next time....and there will be a "next time", I think I will try a white cake mix. Thanks so much!

I made this for Mother's Day a few weeks ago.  I was very easy to make and everyone loved it.  I had to cook it about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  It was not done in the middle.  Other than that, I recommend this recipe!

I am rating this 4 stars because I didn't think it was very pretty when I turned it out upside down on a platter. I followed the directions to the tee. I think that if I had used white cake mix instead of yellow that the red would've shown more true and would have been more appetizing. The strawberries faded into the yellow and it was a weird bergundy color. As for flavor and consistency, I really enjoyed it. The marshmallows and jello make it a rich strawberry shortcake. It definitely should be served along side some whipped cream.

I consider myself a good cook but this did NOT work for me. I followed the directions exactly and it fell apart.  The ONLY thing I did differently was using a bundt cake pan. Maybe I will try again with the 9 x 13. I really wanted this to work!

I know that I'm in the minority here, but this just didn't knock our socks off.  It was fairly easy to put together and tasted OK but honestly it's not something I think we'll have again.  Def needs whipped cream topping!

Nice cake. I had to bake longer than the listed time but it came out okay. I didn't have strawberry jello so I used cherry and it tasted fine. Refrigerate leftovers; it's actually better the next day.

Yum, yum, yum!!! This cake is so good....I have made it twice in the past 3 weeks. The second time I forgot to add the marshmallows and the strawberry goo did not seep into the cake as well, so DO NOT forget them!!! Both times I used a scratch made cake and added the batter to the berries as directed in the recipe. If you like strawberries, you can't go wrong with this one!! *Update* I have made this too many times to count already!! My family loves it!!  I also did a brownie version which was delicious...just replace the cake batter with brownie batter and bake until set. Delicious!!!

Yummy cake but fresh strawberries are expensive where I live so not worth the cost of the berries. I'd just as soon eat them plain and that's better for me. If I had an abundance this could become a favorite cake though. Update:Tried this with free mangoes today and it is killer. Liked it even better than the strawberry cake so all is well. Can't wait to share it with the family at dinner tonight!

This was excellent and very easy to make. It tasted like strawberry shortcake. I made it by crushing strawberries in mini food chopper. It was delicious and tasted awesome with some whip cream.

This is SO good!  I lightened it up for my diabetic husband by using a 50% less sugar Pillsbury yellow cake mix and one small pkg sugar free strawberry jello, but left in the marshmallows.  Be sure the strawberries have released their juice.  We topped with sugar free cool whip for an almost guilt free summer dessert.

I saw this recipe and had to try it!  First time I have ever had strawberry upside down cake and it was delicious!  Very easy to make and fun!  I will make this again and again!  Can't wait for my children to be old enough to help mash up the strawberries!  LOOOVE this cake!

I took this to a dinner on Saturday and everyone was skeptical but as soon as they took that first bite they were hooked!!! I agree with DJRM77, it does need whipped cream on top, or even ice cream.

I made this cake yesterday and it is SO GOOD!  I did not make any alterations and it turned out great.  We ate it with some whipped topping but it would also be great with ice cream!  This one is definitely a keeper.

A very good recipe! It, however, could use a little dollop of whipped cream or cool whip. I took previous reviewers suggestions and put a couple tbsp. of sugar on the sliced strawberries, to let them get juicy. I crushed the strawberries and only used a 3 oz box of strawberry gelatin. I had no problem with the cooking time for the cake - it came out perfect! I just want to add, however, that the cake, by itself, is not visually appealing.

I used one 3 oz package of strawberry Jello and 1 package of unflavored jello since I didn't want the strawberry jello flavor to overpower the strawberries.  This was a perfect combo.   I don't see the need for the marshmallows since they floated to the top of my cake batter.

First off, let me say this was too easy for the awesome results!  I'm a 37 year old male, and not too experienced in the 'desert' category.  Not only, did everyone love it, but they all asked when it will be served again!  I  think next time I'm going to add more marshmallows and experiment with the jello flavoring, and maybe add some pineapple or a different berry along with the strawberries.  Thanks again!

Ok, Not sure about this cake. Is it better when it cools down? Boyfriend even said don't try this again. Maybe had to sweeten strawberries before putting in pan.

Easy, easy, easy.  The sweet and tangy taste is perfect for summer.  I probably used closer to 3 cups fresh strawberries because I got carried away when slicing them, and I added about a tbsp of sugar to draw out the juices when mashing them, and it was delicious!!!  I can't wait to try other berries.  Oh, I didn't have yellow cake mix but I used a french vanilla cake mix and it was fabulous!  Everyone raved about it.  I gave them an option of whipped cream or ice cream.  It was great either way.

Unfortunately, this cake is not good at all. I wanted it to be so badly since I had everything on hand and I love strawberries! Reviewers here said they couldn't notice the marshmallows or they thought it would be too sweet. However, it was really sweet and the marshmallows were unappetizing and the gelatin slightly added to the flavor. I did make slight adjustments: I added more mashed strawberries and less gelatin (not a huge fan of gelatin). Out of 15 people at the party I made the cake for, 1 person tried it. Thankfully I made back-up brownies!!!

This was yummy!  Can't bring myself to give 5 stars on a recipes that uses boxed cake mixes.  I made my own cake batter from scratch and then followed the rest of the recipe as is.

Cake has a very good taste.  My problem was that I couldn't get it out of the pan, so we ate it more like a spooned dessert.  I greased the bottom of the pan, which the recipe doesn't say to do, so that is probably why I had problem. I used a butter recipe yellow cake, fresh strawberries that I slightly sweentened the night before and sugar free jello.  I may try again in the future w/o greasing the pan.

I just made this and for me personally, I thought it was actually kind of bland. I followed the recipe exactly. I made it for my husband and his friends. These were a bunch of soldiers and they loved it and said it was amazing so maybe it was just me? It definitely wasn't bad, I was just expecting more flavor from so many reviews praising it so highly. Either way it was easy and a way to use some of my fresh strawberries. Maybe I will like it better tomorrow once it's been refridgerated.

This is a very delicious cake and right on the money.  We loved it.  I used the sugar free gelatin and it was perfect.  Top with light dreamwhip and I used a white cake mix with egg whites and it was light and delicious.

First of all, the person who took this photo must be a professional Food Stylist, because my cake was nowhere near as appetizing in appearance.  The recipe was very easy, and it took 50 minutes to bake. I actually had no problem with the sides sticking, but even after spraying the pan with cooking spray, the middle bottom section stuck to the pan. I was really nervous while the cake was baking, as it looked like Mt. Vesuvius getting ready to erupt, and I had neglected to put a drip pan underneath it. Fortunately it did not overflow, although it did have its moments. I am not going to show my family the entire dessert tonight---I'll cut slices and put whipped cream on top of them. I did, because the cake was so ugly, taste-test it, which I normally don't do. Topped with the cream, it was delicious. I think I may have been too generous with the crushed strawberries---a bit too much liquid trying to rise to the surface.  For those who do not like marshmallows---they melt into the topping---you don't even know that they are there.  I will make this cake again, but I think I will halve the recipe. I don't want to have soggy leftovers.

We really enjoyed this dessert.  I sweetened up the strawberries and mixed the gelatin into the mashed strawberries before spreading into the bottom of the pan.  I ended up using the whole bag of marshmallows.  The end result was great!

I made the fresh strawberry upside down cake for our evening meal.  I am now a great success as a cook.  My husband is a big fan of strawberries.  I couldn't keep him out of it.  He ate it before our meal.  This is so simple to make.  It will be a good dessert to take for family dinners.

I agree with the reviewer 2 slots below mine that says that this cake needs whipped cream or ice cream to really be enjoyable.  I made it for a dinner and it was okay fresh out of the oven - not phenomenal or anything.  Then, because strawberries are a fragile fruit, it REALLY didn't last.  The reviewer two below says you really have to MASH the strawberries, maybe I didn't mash hard enough - the next day I have mushy strawberries and not the tastiest cake.  I wonder about  serving it chilled.  But it definitely needs whipped cream or ice cream or something.

It tastes incredibly yummy. I made some modifications due to lack of ingredients and other users recommendations. I used (1) box of pineapple cake mix and added 1 t. almond extract.   Also, I used frozen fruit instead of fresh. I would not recommend using (2) whole cups of frozen fruit. I will try only using (1 1/4) cup next time. I would only reduce that since it ended up spilling over-even after it cooled. I realize some of that is due to it being frozen but reducing the amount should fix that.   I also mixed the gelatin with the fruit prior to adding them to baking pan. Other reviewers pointed me in that direction and I am grateful- it was solid advice.   I also used the bunt cake pan another user recommend, I loved that idea. It worked out great in practice and I would recommend others to do so too. Just follow the box directions for temperature levels and baking times consistent with bunt cake. I believe mine was 350 for about (1) hour. However, I have a smaller oven that is a little on the hot side.  I read that other users said the cake was not very pretty. I made so many alternations to the recipe I do not feel it is fair to judge my review as far as appearances go. That being said, this was the most unappealing, not burnt desert I ever made. LOL. I feel that the above version, I altered was ugly due to #1 over abundance of fruit and #2 I mixed strawberries with blueberries; thus, it looked a little cryptic in color. Nevertheless, it really did taste amazing!

My family enjoyed the cake, but not as much as others I've done.  Like others stated, I think I'll stick with strawberry shortcake.  Word of warning...this is a very sweet cake (of course it is, look at the ingredients!) so unless you have a giant sweet tooth, you will probably want to make something else.  Neat idea though!  Thanks!

Made this for dessert after supper and it tastes wonderful, but in the looks catagory it won't win any prizes.  Most definately does Not look like picture. In fact, looking at it is really unappetizing. So very glad it taste better than it looks. Will make again and hopefully it will look a little better next time.

This sounds so good, but I don't like marshmellows.  Is there anything I can substitute?  I'd really appreciated it and idea, because this sounds delicious!

Delicious and so easy.  I chopped strawberries instead of crushing otherwise didn't change a thing.  I did only cut out 1 piece at a time and topped with a dollop of whipped cream.

It just doesn't get any easier than this. My hubby thought it was "one of the best desserts" I have made from this site. That being said, he thinks anything with strawberries is the best thing I have ever made. The kids enjoyed it but said it wasn't their favorite. I thought it was okay. I'm not sure I like the cooked strawberries, but that's just my opion. It was a fast and easy recipe for a weeknight and I'm sure we will make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Although my cake didnt turn out like the picture, it was certianly delicious! It tasted like a strawberry shortcake. I used large marshmellow that I cut up, because I didnt have miniature ones. Still tasted great! I will make this again and again.

Tasted Great. Presentation wise thats another story. I looked thru the pictures and the one by Luvmy2kids looked amazing. I have no idea how hers turned out that way and mine was a sloppy mess that could not even be cut. (see my photo) I cooked it until the cake was medium brown so it was not an under baked issue so I have no idea what happened. In my case it would have been better NOT flipped upside down and just dug out with a spoon. With all that being said, we all liked it alot. It is something I think I will make again just not flip over. Thanks!

Such a great recipe. It's even better when layered and frosted with whipped cream. Let chill for several hours. So good and I received lots of compliments from my guests. Have made this twice in the past month.

YUM! My five year old grandaughter made this for my birthday (with a little help from PopPop). It was delicious and so easy, even a five year old can make it.  We are making it for our church's valentine dinner this week.  I can't wait to take the credit for making such a great cake!

This sounded very strange, but everyone liked it.  I added extra marshamallows to cover evenly.  Used a 9x13 pyrex, sprayed, and it came out perfect.  I liked it warm and also cold with cool whip.

This recipe was great!! I had a mixture of fresh strawberries & frozen sliced... I don't think I had enough of the jello mixture though maybe next time I will double it and add extra marshmallows.  It tastes like a yummy shtrawberry shortcake.  I served with cool whip topping.  Next time I think I may try the earlier suggestion of slicing it in half and serving as a layer cake.  Great Recipe.. Thanks for sharing

I made this for my boyfriend's family - I'm a teenager trying to cook more. It was absolutely amazing. My boyfriend's mom can't stop telling everyone about how great it is! I've done Pineapple Upside Down cake before, but this is unique. It tastes great, although I'm going to put in more marshmallows next time (couldn't taste them much!) GREAT RECIPE! THANKS!

very tasty, the 'real' strawberry flavor came through.  i checked it at 38 minutes and it was done, perhaps could even have gone 35 minutes for a nice moist cake. next time, i might let the berries sit a few minutes before adding the remaining ingredients to let them draw even more juice.

Tastes like strawberry shortcake. I used half the amount of jello and 2 cups of marshmallows.

It was really really good.  I used more strawberries than the recipe called for.  I had a lot to use up before they went bad.  It turned out great!  It was a fun recipe for my 3 year old to help with since the first 3 ingredients are "dumped" in.  I will definately make this one again!

I did cut back on some of the marshmallows, and it was still good. I was totally suprise on how well it tasted and how moist it was. I will make this for our fourth of july gathering.
